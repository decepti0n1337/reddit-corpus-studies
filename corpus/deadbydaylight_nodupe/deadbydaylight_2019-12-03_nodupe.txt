Just long enough to avoid the crows
---
---
---
Then it's on to the next like your boy jay-z.  I got a million lockers to fit in.  Choose one.
---
That outfit reminds me of Kane from WWE.
---
Maybe BHVR can tell, but as a killer with lag I can tell you survs don‚Äôt know shit about lag switches. I suppose it should be obvious to an expert but I don‚Äôt know if BHVR has anyone like that
---
He‚Äôs looking at it
---
I check profiles each game.  SWFs (generally 2-3 man) are almost every game.  It's fairly rare (maybe one in 8) for me to get a match without some form of SWFs.
---
What is toxic gen rushing? Isn't the goal of the survivors to get the gens done as soon as possible? ü§î
---
Both
---
Lol ILY
---
was it hot? did you like watching?
---
Archive challenge? I did that to get that one and it worked :)
---
New game mode. Four survivors running to beat the shit out of the Killer. The killer has to do things to get away while working on things and not getting beat. Survivors get downed but not hooked. Survivors can pick themselves up as if they had no mither or unbreakable.
---
There already downvoting wow bro. Your the hero we need!
---
I wish everybody could get out of this "us vs them" mindset. This happens whether you're survivor or killer, no need to go into the comments and be like haha salty killer mains because it's just literally a thing people do not "mains" of a certain role.
---
Hm. That gave me an idea.
---
O h wow they want people that are barely into purple ranks to go against tank 1s? Thats kind of harsh.
---
Are there certain callouts for each map? It all just seems random to me. Obviously there is basement and there‚Äôs always a big house (most of the time), but I‚Äôll usually just say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in basement‚Äù or ‚ÄúGo back to the first gen we did‚Äù, I don‚Äôt really use perks to communicate though.
---
Check out my other post about the Bioshock Chapter for the Killer idea. Personally I'm more proud of that lol
---
I apologized profusely after I finished the first 4k challenge, so I can only imagine how bad I‚Äôll feel completing the one you did. I felt so awful about being sweaty, but sweating your balls off is really the only way to complete that kind of challenge.
---
All I got for a reply so far was a "yikes" lol.  Lq dogshit killers at their finest, prob save the shit talking about me for a discord I can't reply to so their feelings stay safe.  Safe space lq crybaby killers show up Aids with their downvotes!
---

---
That'll show me!
---
Huh, I thought I had a daily to kill a survivor by any means as the doctor and the hook kills didn‚Äôt count
---
&gt;O h wow they want people that are barely into purple ranks to go against tank 1s? Thats kind of harsh.
---
If they make things more stricter than this, queue times will be even worse than already are. There will never be a solution to both issues (unfair matchmaking and queue times).
---
&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;*We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here‚Äôs how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;* If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor‚Äôs rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)
---
 
---
&gt;* If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
&gt;* New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing.
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule. 
---
&gt;If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other

---
thank you for your support, I'm not losing my trust in people completely.
---
Oh no.
---
Oh no, he's cute.
---
Where from ???
---
So your just biased then?
---
It's almost always better to go directly for the guy you see sitting behind the tree, rather than pretend like you don't. Worst case scenario for doing it is he somehow unhooks the guy and gets away. Worst case scenario for not doing it is the other two survivors just finish the gens and leave.
---
I guess it never came to my attention
---
Dead Hard, Self Care, Spine Chill, Adrenaline/Lithe
---
What is this thread?ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Idea for key nerf!!
---
You have to open the hatch slowly with key charges, kinda like an exit gate, so you can still 99% it, but gives killer higher chance to not allow free wins.
---
It's leaked for the second Rift
---
When did I get pissed and message a killer? You obviously confused me with someone else. Clean your glasses jit
---
Oh sorry
---
Great cosplay!
---
I remember playing it on a PSX demo back 1998 with my brother, and we both would always get to this glass demon boss right before the demo ended. Never had the chance to fight the damn monster.
---
Shut the fuk up ya squinty-eyed hillbilly-myers ass bitch
---
K so it means just no gate can be opened. You can kill them all before it happens just no gate opened
---
The fact that most skilled survivors don't fear skilled killers should tell people there's something wrong with game design.
---
Maybe he pulled his cord then, the timing was too convenient for him crashing. Sadly it didn't count as an escape.
---
Warehouse parties are all the rage these days
---
got baited by the title... where is the long shot?
---
Then I'll get what little karma I can before it's removed lol
---
I got a 4k after someone broke my Haunted.
---
I barely black pipped but it was funny as hell to down everyone with in the first 2 minutes.
---
Well mods should stop being fat
---
Me as Forever Freddy beating the shit out of gens when Thanatophobia and Dying Light has snowballed.
---
OK, I laughed.
---
&gt;Maybe he pulled his cord then, the timing was too convenient for him crashing. Sadly it didn't count as an escape.
---
The same thing happens when survivors pull the cord if they are about to be sacrificed. 
---
I was 1 obsession kill short from completing my challenge and guy "DCed" on hook. Didn't count towards my challenge. 
---
When they hit "leave game" on hook, it did count.

They play the game to have fun or to win. If neither of the two happens, they leave. Too bad DBD is not really a game where you can concede at any time, such as magic the gathering or chess. Here nobody cares that you leave early.

The sad part about this is red ranks bullying baby bubba who shouldn‚Äôt even be in their game but okay ranking system
---
Oh, I didn't know that... Guess I'll just never get Adept Hag, lol. Thanks for the reply, though.
---
the latter
---
also gives you access to the next level
---
Does PWYF work with Billy Saw speed. He hits like 300 or so percent with both chainsaw speed addons.
---
kinda OP but ok   
---
why run borrowed time when you can just full heal ppl 
---
3 unhooks is a lot too, like that's probably above average saves for a game even if you're being fairly altruistic
---
We need swim team speedo Quentin.
---
Does spamming the attempt escape while on the hook mean "come get me" or "killer is here"?
---
Who does this exist for
---
To atone for your sins, you must host 3 farming lobbies for survivors
---
When they come together they create voltdweet
---
It's more like the killer is trapped there with the survivors when good swf comes to play....
---
Devs are working on it I guess, balancing takes time. Years apparently, lol.
---
Are they really?! Thank fuck!
---
Running meta isn't toxic. It's running meta. Noed isn't meta. It just rewards you for playing poorly.
---
You should do dead hard, it'll look pretty darn neat.
---
i had a huntress for 5 games in a row but it was the same person lmao
---
yeah i always see people getting hit by the killer and crawling out at the exit gates on youtube and stuff but i can never find exactly where to stand, im always just a few inches short or escape prematurely
---
It's not bullying if it's completely out of their control. They have zero way of knowing what rank killer they are vsing.
---
Makes sense, thanks for the reply! :)
---
I run spine chill, self care, dark sense and empathy/dead hard (depending on how I want to play that game)
---
No, DC'ing helps me find another game instead of wasting time playing a match I'm obviously not enjoying. Not that I have to justify anything to you or anyone else, but I don't DC from every game because I don't get tunneled every game. It's a few times out of dozens of matches, if that. And I have 3k+ hours in the game, so I don't need any advice. I'll take my downvotes now.
---
Fair point! :)
---
Read it? I experienced it. I'm reranking back to red and doing it again.
---
Thanataphobia should replace sloppy and then also bring nurses calling for 1 of ur least used perk
---
&gt;I support both sides getting progress when stuff like this happens.
---
I have a feeling devs struggle to fix stuff like this (differentiating crashes from quitters or people that force a crash). 
---
I also support both situations counting towards the progress of whatever challenge the player is working on.
---
Glad I have other cool things about me like
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
tbc
---
I‚Äôm not quite sure yet. 
---
I think the most interesting would be a ruined version of the Captain‚Äôs ship, perhaps washed up on an island.
---
Thank you
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure a doctor with the green range add-on could stand in the middle and be able to reach all 3
---
This will be outdated tomorrow
---
The general consensus I've seen is to spam it when the killer is nearby
---
Please explain to me how a high rank survivor can intentionally join the lobby of a brown rank. Blame match making, not the survivors.
---
The counter is not to get caught twice.
---
&gt;So what, is he the newest automatic DC flavor of the month?
---
Not really, DC of the month has been Spirit. 
---
From what I've seen the "forever Freddy" build is DC inducer because it is boring. Some people DC against Freddy because BT doesn't work against him so Freddy players can camp at will. It varies from survivor to survivor, you just came across a 4-man that didn't want to deal with Freddy for whatever reason.
---
Bad thing all of her perks are Hex. All of them will usually be destroyed in the first minutes of the match. I've only had 2 games where Devour stayed until the end, but I still can't get Merciless Killer.
---
I'm probably just bad at killer, though. I usually take 8 goddamn minutes to get into a lobby, then I don't play them that much.
---
cool, i was just going under the idea that BHVR wouldn‚Äôt add a water element to the maps
---
I should also explain my build I run Slippery Meat and Up the Ante to boost kobe chances. If no team mates are around I attempt the kobe, if they start running to me I stop my attempts then let them get the unhook. I have Kindred so they see what everyone else is doing and see if the killer is a threat.
---
[This is the one I used.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/599901077877424148/651043395791355915/Patrick2.JPG)
---
They fucking delete mine
---
Yes but this is a very competitive game with a very competitive community most what people talk about nowadays is balance this game being spontaneous won‚Äôt make it scary and just cause the devs want it doesn‚Äôt mean the community wants it
---
my main thought was someone like trapper, his mori is really boring and kinda basic, if they added more then he could do something cool like place a trap and put you head first into it
---
because legion is bad
---
They act as if they have never escaped before, must suck to suck.
---
Yet infinites have been shown to be a purposeful game design. 
---
You don't even need balanced landing for infinites found in iron works ect.
---
Keep your eyes hereee
---
Who tf uses botany over self care? You can heal yourself with botany. Use bond. Its better than either of them.
---
Its ok because everyone agrees rank doesn't matter and rank 1 games are not as much fun. Most killers aren't good at high ranks and so everyone plays the best killers and everyone uses Ruin and BBQ and Pop goes the Weasel so the games take forever and usually somebody gets tunneled or proxy camped so every survivor has Decisive Strike and so don't worry about rank at all
---
It's when you are not literally standing next to  hook, but patrolling a few meters away. You need to be at least 16 meters away so you don't lose points.
---
Same reason we will probably never get chucky they are super small
---
The Devs are trying to silence me when I find a weird exploit in what they define as "griefing" in this game. Me trying to save my teammates and force the killer to tunnel and focus is apparently griefing. The killer's job is to kill after all it would be a shame if someone either forced or stopped them.
---
I'd rather the survivors also get a game breaking offering that's super rare.  
---
Besides isn't the point of moris to establish the fact that killers are killers and not just subservient slaves to a god that demands the suffering of random people through continueus pectoral penetration via rusted meat hook
---
dang that‚Äôs real scummy. but it‚Äôs not franks i am literally running out with the item and it‚Äôs gone when i get to the main screen
---
I'll surely try some more games with her to see if things work out! If not, then I guess I'm just moving on to another killer. Thanks for the motivation!
---
I was the same, thanks! :)
---
Solid rebuttal
---
Even competitive implement luck if you know the outcome every time and base it solely on skill it will become very boring. A lot of what they call 'balancing' is actually causing less balance in the game. It's their game and how it was described if they don't want it then they're not a part of the community it's the whole point of the game.
---
Do 2 gens and run around the killer. It should start a chase and you just walk away until it ends and repeat
---
Freddy Ghostface Demogorgon and Pig are all better than Legion so Legion isn't at the top of M1 killers
---
not really. do you really need to be healed constantly? +thana sloppy meta is common af. you are wasting time
---
When I see a hidden offering I usually close the game and restart, cause I don't want to play vs a mori. If I missed the mori and a teammate or me gets moried in game in an unfair way (not on death hook), I always DC immediately.
---
This is by far the best one I've seen.

There is a button dedicated to inverting the camera and you're accidentally pressing it.

Please don't do this to me, it's nearing 2 am here ;\_;

If I‚Äôm gonna be honest I basement camp with insidious Bubba just to get some salt. It‚Äôs fun to see people‚Äôs reactions and I sometimes get 4Ks somehow.
---
L-M-N-Mori-Key.....
---
Yeah, took me longer than I'd care to admit.
---
Exactly! He and wraith both have a basically identical moris with zero personality and nothing unique to their kit or lore unlike every one else.
---
Survivors disconnecting when they get downed thirty seconds in.
---
Survivors disconnecting against killers they don't want to play against.
---
Survivors disconnecting when they can't find Ruin.
---
Like... what's your point dude? Both sides do it.
---
introducing: dead by daylight, battle royale
---
I like dem chunky
---
Except if you waste time running over to the other side of the map, see he/she's camping then turn around and run back you've wasted a third to half of their hang time.
---
How does iron will help? The description doesnt look like much but a lot of people still run it
---
Ugh my phone camera hates my TV üò™ I swear she has brown hair
---
Ghostface is next.
---
That's not a conversation. He's trolling you and you fell for it. I try not to engage them.
---
Yeah, that'll happen with overly altrustic survivors/randoms.
---
Thankfully my friend got hooked first, and told me, so we just did gens. After he died, Bubba hunted someone else, downed them, camped them.
---
This person though said that its too hard to get even 2k as killer so they do that as Bubba to rank up.
---
Most people don't understand how to play Legion, or how to use his add ons in synch with his power and perks.
---
They just see 'o0o I can go over pallets!' And then loudly proclaim he sucks.
---
What is entitled is expecting players to participate in an obviously unfair match with toxic sweaty losers "wHo JuSt WaNnA pLaY wIf DeRe FwIeNdS"
---
Wait im missing two of my completed dailies now
---
Quentin is based off a real human being, so it's very different.
---
My most terrifying matches are if i play AS the pig.
---
I almost always get jumpscared by that one Balanced Landing Survivor whilst trying to check gens. Because of the camera view they literally jump in your face
---
You're twenty minutes late. 
---
I'm not paying for those.
---
&gt;Or maybe that‚Äôs teamwork? 
---
Teamwork of assholes. Those two are not mutually exclusive.
---
Imagine being this much of a baby. 
---
Also if you DC while a killer mori's you they get the kill points anyway and bonus points for you bitching out. You're literally giving them more points at the cost of your own lmao
---
Ghostface is either the biggest memester or the most toxic asshole. There is no in-between.
---
\~  11:00 AM EST
---
Not really. there‚Äôs the trailer and there‚Äôs the in game.
---
points for youu‚ô°
---
Its not confirmed, but its probably tommorow, and I think its at 12pm eat.
---
Lol outside of pre-nerf Nurse, Spirit, and maybe Freddy on the right map, killers at Red rank are gonna have a hard time.
---
That wasn't toxic. You needed to do that to escape
---
Ghostface, walking down to the basement: "Why do I hear a Heartbeat?"
---
&gt;Its not confirmed, but its probably tommorow, and I think its at 12pm eat.
---
It is confirmed.
---
11am or so Eastern.
---
By that logic, the same teammate can farm you twice, so there is no counter to any killer gameplay.
---
Just play doctor and keep everyone in madness 3 for the entire game bro
---
trash talking makes the dudes with the little peckers feel big
---
Ignore the braggart, my dude. You're one tier from the top tier.
---
Hey look a clown
---
I approve of this
---
A lot of game trailers that don't use in game footage look very different to the actual game. Been like that for as long as video games have existed.
---
I don't know why people think mori's save time. They really don't. The animations are so long they take about the same time as it normally does to pick someone up and carry them to the nearest hook. Depending on where the hook is, hooking them could even be faster. The only real benefit of the mori is the early kill.
---
I like it, keep up the work op
---
You can, either it's a bug or you accidentally accepted them.
---
BBQ
---
Fuck
---
Faces are hard.
---
And so are roads apparently, BAZINGA.
---
Everyone.
---
Wow running no Ed omg noob killer
---
BBQ to get more points to get ruin back faster
---
Seeing very similar posts 4 times in a row isn‚Äôt fun for most people. This is quite clearly oversaturated
---
Yep it bugs out and deletes two. Thought they‚Äôd fixed it but clearly not.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs why I added the giving flair to the kill thing cause 9 times out of 10 the saving time but doesn‚Äôt apply

More specifically it's suppose to emulate the scene in Halloween where Michael corners Laurie in the closet and she stabs him in the eye with a hangar to get out of it. Kinda neat
---
[removed]
---
How have you lived this far in life?
---
Well yes, they can farm you twice, but in a normal match you can put on ds and/or unbreakable and you can use these perks in the case of your teammates' stupidity.
---
If the killer has a mori in this situation, you are dead instantly without any counterplay. There is literally nothing you can do to prevent this.
---
It means that they prestiged a character before a specific date that was pretty early on. They have this gold glowy cosmetic instead of the bloody ones, which is no longer available.
---
fun for you but not the person who's sitting on hook or any teammates who try and save
---
Do you think shit talking can win arguments or convince anyone?
---
He DC'd before he knew there was BT.

I just hide until I get called out by the crows.

Yeah idk what happened to her in the game

Nancy?

Next thing you know, we‚Äôll get Carl and people will be complaining he‚Äôs too chunky in-game.
---
Not on console bud.
---
Ah yes, this is what I thought. Unfortunately.
---
How can you use know and no. Without noticing
---
He means further down the bloodweb because you have plenty of points.
---
not the same thing though. this character looks nothing like the trailer. the oni looks just like the trailer.
---
Twas a joke lmao
---
Dont worry rank doesn't matter anyway
---
Spot on
---
AHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAA GOT ME BRO THATS FUCKING HILARIOUS GOOD ONE
---
nah they look alike
---
Fuck is your problem nigga damn
---
There is an easy fix for moris. 
---
Mori should only be active after survivor is on death hook. At that point its a reward for a job well done by the killer. 
---
Keys should just be removed from the game. It literally just gives survivors a free escape that the killer isn‚Äôt realistically able to prevent.
---
You are not providing any argument to prove your point. You are just a reaching "cry baby" repeatedly. How is that convincing in your simple mind?
---
One side is a lot more bitch made in this subreddit there buddy.
---
If wraith is M1 and has stealth what makes that different from Ghostface and Pig. Ghostface has stalk for insta so he probably isnt really M1 but then so does Myers and he's M1. So you tell me
---
Patrick?
---
Sure I‚Äôm down to see it! Always fun to see those puny survivors get wrecked!
---
Were they share played? If they were go onto it friends account and activate primary console
---
I‚Äôm reporting you for making crutch perks!!!!!! (This is a joke just in case you 5 year olds on reddit start acting stupid)
---
you know you could just always... not farm
---
i don‚Äôt get how tru3 is so fucking brain dead when it comes to this. for someone who played the game for as long as he did, how the fuck can you think *wraith* is better than every killer but nurse, spirit, and ghostface
---
Completing the epilogue only grants you access to the next Tier of that Tome. 
---
Therefore, you can always go back and do previous challenges and even wait to claim them to stockpile BP and Rift Fragments to redeem later.
---
I sent one in, just wonder how long they‚Äôll take to get back to me. Hopefully I won‚Äôt have to buy them again in the end.
---
Needs more bags under his eyes
---
I'm sorry for your loss, I wish you the best of luck with that,
---
Damn.. homeboy can like... get it
---
DEVS PLEASE DELETE YOUR TRASH  OF A GAME OF THE INTERNET PLEASE
---
Do you think killers should be able to tunnel and camp?
---
Next time someone posts one of these I'm going to kill someone
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter to me
---
The DC cause Freddy
---
billy
---
Ruin. Especially with demogorgon lol
---
...you should reread your title, it's toxic af.
---
Like fuck you devs for making a broken ass game fuck you killers are fucking op asf shit
---
Landing/ getting hit by cross map hatchets is always fun imo. Takes skill from the killer. So I always congratulate them for the hit in post game.
---
A ding ding ding, meeting shall come to order!!!
---
Try me
---
get a new pc? hehe
---
Shut up
---
Dog shit ugly lookin devs
---
You can hide from bbq. Its actually a weak perk on freddy if you are facing decent survivors. Now thrilling tremors on the other hand...
---
"Only flaw"
---
It should be when you're good to get them, tbh
---
I'm not good at it either but I only saw one mistake
---
I literally did in multiple comments. You just don‚Äôt agree.
---
Mayhaps, those same gods are in 40k too though.
---
Devs dont know how to make a game. I can make a better game than this dumb shit
---
It‚Äôs Susie bruh
---
You won‚Äôt know there isn‚Äôt noed until the end of the game. While more often than not you won‚Äôt run into it, not doing totems is a risk you take to gamble for gen pressure. Idk why you wouldn‚Äôt do totems even in general, with or without ruin. It‚Äôs free BP. It‚Äôs free emblem. It‚Äôs free getting rid of potential noed or potential Thrill if it‚Äôs in play. 
---
There are other secondary objectives like healing as well that survivors also ignore in favor of gens which is a risky play but of course there‚Äôs a failsafe for that too.
---
unfortunately
---
What he said
---
You literally cant read.
---
Yeah so if they made mori's only work on death hook it's barely different from just straight up deleting them. Ebony's are OP tho, I'd change em so green is now purple, but still just one kill, and Ebony lets you kill 2 people. You're still halving its usefulness, but they wouldn't be useless.
---
It's a relatable "experience" but get your head out of your ass. Lol
---
Dude I‚Äôd be seriously interested in paying you to make some, is it alright if i dm you?
---
Sorry your legion pic looks like triggly puff.
---
can't really afford that right now I am planning to in the future
---
Devs suck my dick you ugly buns
---
just don‚Äôt play the game /s
---
I mean, I think it's like if everyone installs a brand new part on 4 different gens. I've never understood what they mean by toxic gen rushed meant, being a killer too.
---
You didn't. "Cry baby" is not an argument.
---
One can dream
---
You said that SWF are survivors ‚Äúeasy mode‚Äù then compares killers not wanting to face SWF to survivors not wanting to go against nurse/spirit but no one is asking for nurse/spirit to be removed so asking for SWF to be removed is entitled
---
No no no, of all the things Survivors do, ‚Äúgenrushing‚Äù isn‚Äôt a thing that‚Äôs toxic. That‚Äôs the whole point of the game. Is it toxic to simply hit and hook survivors?
---
No RNG?  In DbD?  You'd probably best look for another game, sir.
---
lol yes, as in its your "right" to turn off your computer at any time when gaming, The very Same yes.
---
 No one can literally stop you from dcing... but you Will be Punished if the game wants too is the point of the post.
---
oofer, I spent the rest of them and didn't get Ruin, got tier 2 BBQ tho lol
---
Good Point
---
I always saw the moris as a nice reward for killers to give them a break. Cause when reaching your skill ceiling, playing killer can become more stressful than playing survivor.
---
Maybe moris should be a holiday offering instead if a year round thing
---
Maybe we could get both, Chucky could sit on Leprechaun's shoulders.
---
I would understand if he would of at least of waited a second to see if he had BT and then proceed to go about his DC'ing business, personally I would definitely much prefer having someone unhook me regardless of them having BT or not than simply hitting the second phase, at least there's an additional chance of getting away safely.
---
Ghostface hadn't found either of them while they were arguing over who got the hatch. They honestly could have split to opposite sides, worked on gens, got at least one done. Instead they did nothing and got one of them purposely killed just so one might escape. This was almost as bad as someone refusing to unhook another survivor just because they found the hatch.
---
Am i the only one who doesn‚Äôt really care about this chapter?
---
I‚Äôve ran several internet tests and even went Wired Ethernet instead of Wireless. I have 15 Ping and very good download speed.
---
Every other game I will skip backwards 3ft every now and again. It sucks in chases, because Killers have told me ‚Äúit looks like you dead-harded backwards into me‚Äù
---
Servers are shit right now.
---
Its bull shit how you dont receive anything for reaching rank 1. I just grinded my ass off out here and didnt even recieve a clothing piece or achievement. Bruh
---
I don't understand what that means but thanks man &lt;3
---
I know, it just seems to be popular on Xbox. And all the fricken time they tell me "Well I got this many kills so I think it's good." But I just want to know the general consensus is on it. I don't do it, unless you're being toxic in which case I only kill that one person, because it's not fun to go up against
---
I normally just lead them on. It makes it so much funner
---
What's Patrick holding there?
---
Anybody else forget what day of the week it is?
---
It's meant to be the aluminium bat cosmetic but it looks more like a balloon
---
It‚Äôll pop back up eventually
---
That's just make survs stop playing for the holidays
---
You aren‚Äôt reading then because this is the first time in all my comments in this thread that I‚Äôve called anyone a crybaby. You‚Äôre just ignoring what I‚Äôve said before. This is going no where so take care.
---
Seriously crying about this? C'mon.
---
..... Decisive strike always has that bug when they are hooking you it takes it away...
---
by... any... means....
---
I know people payed like hundreds before for it right? Orrr.. And they're going to put it into the game now for how much? I'm just curious, I didn't know anything about this at all obviously
---
Ok. But it didnt work. Soooooooo. That's why I asked
---
Hook, mori, bleed out, anything that gets them out of the game
---
I sacrificed the obsession in my last game and it didnt go up
---
Oooo this is a good point. Survivors have ultra rare items/add ons but they don‚Äôt have ultra rare offerings.
---
I got some moris left...
---
It‚Äôs show time
---
So talent. Much skill.
---
Tao killers one price
---
I love these, thanks!
---
I think they animated her trailer similar to Japanese animation purely for advertising and theme reasons. Even Adam and Spirit look mildly different because of the same reason.  Also several of the characters look like the cheap version of their trailers. 
---
Stranger Things is the exception because it HAD to be and because the actors likely agreed to it as well. I don‚Äôt think the actor for Quinten agreed to have their likeliness used, and don‚Äôt forget Quinten is based on an actual person, where as Yui isn‚Äôt.
---
Yeah, let's go with that. A balloon...
---
That's not a but
---
Then just use an ivory mori or let them bleed out on the ground
---
Yikes dude. Hopefully you don‚Äôt run into him anytime soon lol. Yeah it‚Äôs that already trash talk culture on Xbox mixed with DBDs very ‚Äúexpressive‚Äù players which just creates what‚Äôs shown above. 
---
I wish I could post multiple pics on Reddit. That‚Äôs only 1 of the 3 survivors who messaged me like this after that game.
---
a lot of the challenges are broken, were supposed to be fixed today, apparently not all were
---
Fine, dildo. Dildo, balloon, same thing.
---
Barb
---
Haha nice
---
Lmao the no mither makes this so much better.  16?
---
Do explain to me why key ends games early when they are designed to work ONLY in end game.
---
Ooh should I tip my fedora for your feels fella?
---
Lmao awesome
---
Gotcha, thanks for explaining!
---
Lol no one needed this salty comment
---
Well sure but docs is probably easiest and his is 30
---
Lucky you
---
Because it‚Äôs only for sabotaging hooks or traps, not for repairs so it doesn‚Äôt have much of a use.
---
I'm a female so maybe read and you won't fail at trolling next time.
---
Meme aside, I think that's the exact reason why the cap is there. So you can't level up a character from level 1 to 50+ in one go. The devs want the grind to be there.
---
I have pc Xbox and PS4 and bought dlcs on all 3 sadly
---
It's for sabotaging, the other one fixes generators 30% faster without add-ons
---
There's a reason for it. It makes it easier for them to detect hackers.
---
Depending on the match and how said teammate has done so far I've actually just started to DC. If they've been even remotely decent I hit that disconnect to give them a chance because I get tired of being slugged and left to bleed out or get put in a repetitive cycle of one of us picking the other up only to be downed and it continue with the next person.
---
This single image has improved my entire day :')
---
Didnt realize i was talking to a retard. The new rank reset hasnt even went live yet. So the previous months took red ranks to green ranks such as 12. After rank reset on green rank you go back into the grey ranks. 
---
You obviously dont know what the fuck youre talking about, but yet have the dumbass urge to speak about shit you know nothing about.
---
Go read a book and educate yourself, you spend too much time on reddit lmao
---
but I thought that was changed a while back to be during pick-up due to killers picking up and dropping survivors to prevent getting hit by DS...i could be mistaken but I thought that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs *supposed* to work.
---
Can I buy some? These are amazing.
---
Lmao how.  True is entitled at its worst.  Every fuckup is the game/lag/servers/anything but me, otz is at least willing to give credit to the other side.
---
I'm a survivor main who watches them to see how to outplay, and all I see that Irish bb girl do is blame everyone but the man in the mirror.  Imagine waking up to go to a job where you hate everything and everyone.  That's true and it's why he plays nothing else but dbd.
---
is mayonnaise an escape? :(
---
You're telling me to give mercy while playing as a killer. That's an oxymoron and a half. I'm not going to play out the game longer. If I was a survivor and I was put into that situation, I'd want them to finish the game so I can go on to the next game and have a better chance at winning rather than play a match where the killer pity fucks me and pats my head.
---
My favorite two bois are right next to each other as well
---
U delete your last post bb?  Too harsh huh?
---
true
---
I know the wiggling cause him to move to the side in the end but he‚Äôs dumb for wasting time attacking those after picking you up. He should of forced them out before picking up.
---
Ruin, bbq, m&amp;a, enduring
---
PGTW, bbq, enduring, spirit fury
---
As a killer player it is not rare. It might be rare to you as a survivor but the question isn't how rare it is to individual survivors, it's how powerful it is. As a killer I've been fucked by keys one out of every 10 or so matches. It's ridiculously irritating how often it happens. Moris are really bad but that's not an argument against dealing with keys, that's an argument for dealing with Moris.
---
This is my favorite one so far, great work.
---
Lmao IDGAF about your gender, you're no different than anyone here just bc of genitals princess.
---
I see you also follow r/forhonor
---
Honestly he really just needs unique add-ons and not copy-paste Billy stuff. Literally 5 add-ons are usable and thats it.
---
Unban Glen_0ck
---
Lmao the r word, stop trying to use it you fucking goof.
---
There's such a thing as looking behind too much. Survivors just run into stuff.
---
Well I've never heard of someone with a fucking neckbeard called 'Sarah' what even..
---
Looks like samuel l Jackson in django unchaining
---
I dont think there will be a DBD 2 since dbd's concept is all built upon itself and trials, such all the updates that release are what draw people back and forth. As long as they keep up the content im sure there will be fans but i dont think it would last very long if they stopped updates. 
---
Unless its a new game with new mechanics, i dont see them as having anything to continue with game wise to make it DBD2 and not some new license.
---
Yes but if you‚Äôre right by the hook the hook animation always trumped the DC animation.
---
No, the hatch spawns when the number of completed gens is the survivor number + 1, so if there's one gen and three survivors, if just *one* has a key then they can all escape instantly.
---
He's just a troll looking for attention, just called him out on something else and here he is trying to start conflict elsewhere
---
I second this, in lower elos the killer queues are long. In higher elos there are way more survivor players so the queues are much shorter there. But if you play during peak hours, late afternoon queues should be pretty short for killers in all elos.

Its squidwards nose
---
I think McCote said they‚Äôll keep updating the game for the next 5-7 years
---
According to toxic idiots it's "Just kill everyone at 5 gens"
---
That's AMAZING!
---
I felt the tension from seeing a Skeleton Watchguard just by reading this
---
Would love to play against this killer just so I could have MORE things to worry about other than "Is the killer nearby? No? Gen Time!" 
---
Man, this game really needs new stuff. Love your idea
---
Probably has a 2 inch willy :)
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking about the killer. I‚Äôm asking how it‚Äôs toxic for players to use their flashlight? Like the flashlight has very few uses, and that‚Äôs the most important one. How is it toxic to use a flashlight for literally what it‚Äôs designed for?  What mechanics are in the game that the devs feel should deter survivors from using flashlights? There aren‚Äôt. Because it‚Äôs not toxic. 
---
Camping will actually cause you to gain less points towards a pip. I‚Äôm not saying any camping is toxic, but it‚Äôs acknowledged that there is incentive to not camp because that *actually* makes the game horrible. Flashlights don‚Äôt.‚Äù
---
You‚Äôre not interested in changing your mind. Bye.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt pip up for playing against absolute potatoes. Safety pip makes complete sense
---
Really!!! Wow. I must‚Äôve missed that.
---
Both are just as annoying.
---
So legbeard, that's the term right?  Apocalypsemuff?  I don't get your roast beef over me assuming your gender.
---
not facecamp, but waiting for the unhooker, i can be really far but its still camp as long as i intercept the unhooker
---
This is the best thing I've seen all day üòÇ
---
Just win the game then keys aren't a problem duh
---
"R word" "goof" so I'm talking to a child who thinks its cool to run their mouth on reddit and go onto multiple posts looking for conflict with different people. Niice. Also i like how you didnt mention anything about my last comment since you know that you were blatantly wrong and just made yourself look dumber

That makes no fucking sense. So, you actually don't want survivors to flashlight save? You think that that's toxic? Holy shit. That's delusional.
---
2 inches might be too generous lmao
---
There are some instances where you cannot hide from bbq, your genny is against a wall, its on the wrong angle, there's no lockers nearby etc. but I do agree thrilling tremors is very powerful, or discordance. In any case, Freddy is still gonna come over there, fuck your genny up and you will be left there doing it all again
---
&gt; supposed to creak every now and then to just constantly sound like grinding metal
---
Wait... that's a bug? I honestly thought it was intended cause it literally happens on every match I've had there.
---
I laughed to much for this
---
No, it isn‚Äôt your fault. But why would you be rewarded with something that in theory signifies skill/increase in skill when you‚Äôre playing against people who are way below your level? It makes no sense.
---
Enjoy life
---
her nose seems off
---
The main problem with  camping and tunneling is that it makes the game boring for everyone. The other survivors can complete objectives without pressure, the survivor being camped and tunneled isn't able to participate, and the Killer is just standing there most of the time.
---
However, there is really only a problem when it is non-strategic.  If you hook a survivor and notice that other survivors are nearby ready to unhook, it isn't a terrible idea to stay in the area and try to root them out. Also, I don't have a problem with chasing a survivor that was recently unhooked if its the only survivor you see. The problem is with people that go into a game ready to camp and tunnel no matter what. 
---
This is non-strategic because as soon as the survivors realize what is going on, they will punish the killer for it by completing generators and escaping. The only time camping and tunneling will get a decent amount of kills is in the early ranks, when survivors don't understand their role, and don't have the perks necessary to punish camping and tunneling. You will almost never get a 4K with better survivors. In fact, I bet the only reason people will tell you they are getting a significant amount of kills per match is because they are not maintaining enough PIPs to level up and play a better group of survivors.
---
Even in games where the killer gets 3 or 4 kills, camping and tunneling will result in fewer blood-points in all categories, even in the sacrifice category. What good is getting 4 kills if you are only earning 15,000 blood-points? The killer could get twice as many points in the same amount of time if they don't stick to a strategy of camping and tunneling.
---
Oh okay, I'm quite terrible at the game. Rank 14 at the moment.
---
I'd rather see memes that are actually good than ones that require little to no effort. 
---
For example:
---
Memes with this template get annoying fast. https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e59g3z/this_is_my_first_ever_attempt_at_making_a_meme/
---
You beat me to it.
---
I have never once pipped that way as survivor ever
---
Holy crap those are amazing!! Is it alright with you if I use the small Shape as my background??
---
Yea its just a waste of a perk because good killers just counter it
---
More importantly we get our lost exclusives back!
---
Xbox here . Rank 1 killer
---
Toxic 90%of games
---
Shit talking ('gg ez' 'baby killer' etc) 20-30% of games
---
On which platform?
---
PC, you?
---
Also PC.
---
It isn‚Äôt mine
---
Almost never
---
I thought toxic gen rushing was mainly a thing back before killers could damage generators. Survivors could simply get several gens to 99%, forcing the killer to patrol the whole map, then begin setting them off one by one.
---
It doesn't matter if they're different art forms, most games have some form of final concept art that the model has to live up to. If a 3D model uses incorrect colors or leaves out details then that has nothing to do with "portraying a feeling".
---
When Feng Mins default hair looks like it's made out of ramen then that's not to evoke emotions, unless it's some kind of joke. In that case it's not just concept art but it's her in-game portrait and the result looks nothing like it.
---
....thats what i said tho, but im not here to argue both the bullshitery Red mori and keys possess, they are both bad.
---
Im just question the "early" use of keys
---
It's like ""Oh i finished my homework 30 mins before class. I DID IT EARLY"
---
Says the person with their head in their ass.
---
on ps4 its backwards xD
---
That really sucks. I honestly feel bad for a lot of killers, unless they're camping hooks, tunneling etc. It takes so long to get in games the last thing you want is toxic survivors.
---
Well that's good to hear.
---
Nice. Maybe I'll play with you sometime, if I haven't already.
---
Looking good, feng
---
She had a few opportunities to escape, this was a pretty ballsy play just to be toxic
---
That‚Äôs not how anything works. At all. And if so, NO GAME lives up to its concept art.
---
That's in the stats yes. But the number of times it happens is not nearly enough to skew the data to make it irrelevant or inaccurate. Maybe once they start issuing penalties for DCing up front next patch, but during the time period these stats were recorded, there's little reason to suicide on hook instead of DC
---
That's part of my point. Not getting all the perks you want to level 3 by the time you hit level 50 is both RNG and part of the grind. It's meant to be there. It's part of the chance and part of the grind.
---
They weren't below my level, rank 7 was their highest. That's a stupid point to make, they were at nearly the same rank as I was but still bad because rank matters less on survivors because they can be carried to higher ranks. This SWF happened to bully their way out of low ranks and weren't prepared for a killer with skill. Also, pipping doesn't signify skill, it's shows if you've won or lost and how well you did. That doesn't always correlate to skill.
---
So that's the thing, I started playing around May or June. So things like that, the amount of pallets that used to be around the map, and being able to permanently destroy hooks are before my time. Which is why I might not know what it means to me.
---
Quit whining, Red-rank
---
Kyf is your only option
---
Maybe lighten up a little.
---
Oh you're so special and different. I didn't care about Stranger Things. Can I join your club too?
---
Damn your survivor games must really suck if 3 gens being done is a rare occurrence for you.
---
Custom games with a friend
---
You‚Äôre literally arguing against yourself at this point
---
Wrong. You lose. Bye-bye.
---
I was doing alright as a killer, trying to do some games as survivor while learning but also trying to contribute but thats just not working out for me
---
Around 1 every 4 games for mild, 1 every 10-15 for teabagging flashlight dancing Neas.
---
Monitor and abuse on legion makes your killer instinct radius/terror radius 40 meters when in chase which helps a lot with finding people. Even the brown add-ons for duration and detection range help a lot and I pretty much use them always since they're easy as fuck to get and I have 30+ of each
---
Yeah I am screwed tho, today is the last day before the dlc comes out
---
custom games pretty much, against good players. practicing against new players like yourself willn't help much.
---
Such insight.
---
Exactly! SHUSH OP
---
Thank you! Ill try her out, the thing is im decent in chases and looping its just taking me longer than id like to admit to get comfortable with the controls and  actually accomplish anything. I guess ive got alot to learn
---
If you facecamp you generally don‚Äôt pip
---
Good luck with that!
---
Nice link
---
Toxic behavior that takes a lot of skill is okay?
---
There is a sub for that
---
I appreciate that so much! But im on xbox, maybe ill try pc soon though haha

Yeah. There is a completely separate subreddit for killers but it's barely used because people would rather just use the general Dbd subreddit. Making sperate ones seems to be pretty useless.

I know, but for some of us, a survivor disconnecting from the game (on hook or not) with no penalty can ruin the game for us. I hate camping killers like everybody else, but in other situations, this ruins the game. That‚Äôs why they added the disconnection penalty.
---
Yeah. you can still do them after the rift closes for Lore and bloodpoints but you wont get rift shards if it is completed after the rift
---
BEHAVIOR FUCK YOU I WILL FIND U IF YOU DONT NERF KILLERS
---
Oh thanks guys
---
Fucking ugly nerds
---
I wish a friend would play with me
---
No one should ever be able to dc in general,it hurts more then it doesn‚Äôt.
---
I feel you bro. I can handle almost anything in-game but post-game toxicity really gets to me.
---
I used to exclusively play killer but switched for the shorter matching times. I recommend trying survivor because it's surprisingly fun and you won't get the short end of the stick toxicity wise. You can even be nice to killers in the chat, they'll sure appreciate it.   
---
(Though just the other day I got another survivor repeatedly say "fu\*k you n\*\*\*\*\*" to my Claudette after a game where THE KILLER WAS AFK until the gens were done. Sheesh, how toxic is that? Slurs should be a bannable offense.)
---
I'm surprised nobody recommended this, but just close the post-game chat. Seriously, why torture yourself. You do it by clicking the "&gt;&gt;" to the right. I think it will stay closed until you exit the game. 
---
A better way is to modify the settings file so you don't have to click to hide it every time you boot the game:  
---
%LocalAppData%\\DeadByDaylight\\Saved\\Config\\WindowsNoEditor\\GameUserSettings.ini  
---
Change the line  
---
ChatDefaultVisibility=True  
---
to  
---
ChatDefaultVisibility=False
---
There you go! Quality of life right at your fingertips.
---
True, I just mean that how hard you camp should determine your penalties. If you face camp each survivor, determined by distance from hook, you shouldn‚Äôt gain blood points, de-pip or even get soft bans at some point. Queue timers don‚Äôt always work but proper implementation on toxic players could calm some games down.
---
Get Hall of Fame dick from a minor league dude?üòâ
---
There should under no circumstances be a "free DC". I know going up against certain types of killers isn't fun but at least last as long as you can if you've got a complete face camper, waste all of their time by waiting out the whole hook progress, you get points for struggling on hook. Also, it gives your team more time to get gens done if you just wait out the facecamp.
---
Fucking trash game worse devs than any other game ive played
---
I just want to play the fucking game, not stay on a hook for two minutes, de-pip, and leave with less than 5k bp.
---
Yep
---
Change your attitude. Flashlight saving is not toxic.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs been buggy af for quite some time now. I also submitted a support ticket about it and didn‚Äôt get a reply. 
---
The weirdest - and most annoying - part about it all is that it only ever seems to not work/grant the bonus BP whenever I have the full four stacks. Everything lower than that seems to grant the bonus, but yeah, full stacks grants nothing and it‚Äôs pretty heartbreaking lol.
---
No one should get a free dc. Only dcs that makes sense are when you have a conflict in real life not game wise.
---
Are you okay?
---
hes been repeating the opposite for wraith for a long time.
---
I mean I wouldn‚Äôt mind that but generally if you face camp one, the rest bust out the gens and escape before you finish least thats how it should be handled. He should get barely any points
---
I only do that to toxic neas that send hate messages after they die or t bag after every pallet drop. They deserve that form of punishment.
---
I play as both survivor and killer. I know he problems both sides face. So, quit complaining and try playing as a survivor atleast once.
---
Change your attitude. Anything that is annoying is toxic.
---
There's the Looking for Group posts on xbox, and r/dbdlfg as well. I'm on xbox and mostly just play solo queue, but I'll play some KYF if you need another person.
---
surviving 8mins a game
---
Isn't the post-game chat disabled on Switch?  
---
I would expect it, Nintendo are quite anal about avoiding toxicity.
---
Still a better job than bhvr
---
Imagine constantly hearing "pizza time" repeated like the seagulls from Finding Nemo.
---
r/unexpectedjojo
---
Nice! Thanks a lot for responding :)
---
I get the rant. It‚Äôs fair to be upset. But Lord, has this subreddit turned into an echo chamber. We know toxic survivors suck, but can we please not see 1000 posts about it?
---
Could have cropped the meme
---
Huh, interesting. What platform?
---
You're supposed to draw over the picture. Regardless, looks like a REAALLLYY drugged up Nancy.
---
When I first started to watch I assumed the guy with the flashlight was clicking it at the Bill trying to use him like some blood sacrifice: "Please Mr. killer, take the Bill. Spare me!" Turns out it was just some lag.
---
Imagine being this mad over the  booty dropping lol.
---
Yes father ‚òÖ~(‚ó°Ôπè‚óï‚úø)
---
You even have a watch!
---
Why does nea look like she wants to kill everybody within a 5 mile radius from her
---
You can always put your own spin on it.
---
Spine Chill and Alert have 2 completely different purposes.
---
Excuse me while I fucking die.
---
I am way too happy at the fact you noticed that detail!
---
Unfortunately you have to add it to the map by being close to it just like any other trackable map item. Left behind may be a better perk if you want to more reliably find the hatch if you're willing to give up the perk slot
---
Let's get this bread, my Quentin brothers and sisters.
---
Myers with that beard and I will never loop again
---
I had this exact decision come up today. Then I remembered my active rift challenge was hook survivors during endgame. At least I explained it and said I was sorry in post game chat. They didn't mind too much.
---
don‚Äôt be foolish. why would they put a motorcycle in a game where you run around? clearly that‚Äôs was something no one thought would‚Äôve be in the game. the oni looks great stop trying to be a smart boy.
---
Hundreds for a horrible recolor of a horrible skin? Must be nice to be able to literally throw money away. I wouldn‚Äôt even pay the standard they charge for this.
---
No? Then we still have a problem.
---
PC, NA.

why is legion's cheekums so big
---
Ok, thanks.
---
myers had a beard on the remake:)
---
We know. It‚Äôs posted about 100 times a day. It is what it is. Stop playing then because there‚Äôs always going those toxic players... both on the survivor side &amp; killer side

I‚Äôd argue they‚Äôre both information perks to tell you where the killer is. Alert shows you where he is, spine chill tells you he‚Äôs coming. I prefer knowing where he is when I need it instead of knowing where he is when he‚Äôs across the map breaking a pallet
---
I love that Pig is *big chilling.*
---
Just because you play to win, doesn't mean that you should stick to the meta like it's gospel.  I would say that I play to win, but I go off meta all the time.  Players get so used to the usual routines that you can hit them like a freight train with a off meta build just because they're not prepared for it.
---
For example, a team kitted with Iron Will, bt, and ds with some Inner Strength and Spine Chill can be caught blindside by a Ruin-less Plague.
---
This reminds me of that one CSGO meme.
---
i just survived 8mins a game cause if you do that it is 2 games per rift for a grand total of 20 games per level
---
Of course, the world always needs those with boomer mentalities.
---
Free. IIRC It was to stop scammers and to stop people from selling cosmetics at high prices.
---
Also currently I'm green rank killer. I'm red ranks every season for both survivor and killer for years now just havent played to much this month.
---
Teabagging is in almost all games, if it hurts you that much maybe you aren‚Äôt mature enough for the game
---
You ok hun?
---
i dont get how teabagging is bad. just play with them. just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks, and gives you too hard a time than is worth it at higher ranks. just play for fun. i'm rank 17 (maybe 15 at most) and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ them, i just hunt and hit them ONLY if they're not injured. for perks use BBQ, Ruin, Nurse'sCalling, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i'd never play any other way.
---
Yea I haven‚Äôt played today but decided to run unbreakable from now on tbh
---
Yeah, I get that. Got the game around 3 months ago but this month just can't find the time.
---
Every few games I get told to kill myself and messages on my steam profile telling me that I'm a tunneling and camping piece of shit though I didn't, ain't my fault you run INTO me lol
---
That's easier for me as killer
---
Beep boop updoot
---
True, but there is definitely a market for those sort of skins. I really don't have sympathy, but I understand why some are salty I should clarify.
---
That sucks. I always try and be a respectful survivor because I know others aren't sometimes.
---
Because the rules of the game is that the survivors do 5 gens then open an exit gate to escape. In what world is survivors escaping before 5 gens get done and a gate gets opened not ‚Äúearly‚Äù? 
---
Multiple survivors can escape via hatch beginning at 3 gens completed. In what world is 3 gens ‚Äúendgame‚Äù?
---
Yup yup, that's what I'm working on currently too
---
Jesus Christ dude I‚Äôm not even going to read that.
---
It has to do with the lore. The entity feeds off the survivors emotions and it's the killers job to toy with them as long as possible then sacrifice them to please the entity.
---
They don't want to admit they're wrong so they try to think of stuff others will hate but it most of the time ends up being funny. Never went in a profile to trashtalk anyone though so idk
---
Ah yes Patrica
---
i‚Äôm tired of you liars. saying ‚Äúohhh she‚Äôs fine‚Äù that‚Äôs a d*mn lie. as someone that‚Äôs is buying her i have my right to my opinion to this character model. just cause you think she‚Äôs fine don‚Äôt mean anything when you‚Äôre not the only person looking to buying her. i‚Äôm tired of you people bs. ya smart a comments are just as dumb. quit trying me
---
Yeah I get that. I'm not too bothered if I escape or die as long as I am having a good time. I just have more fun when I play with friend most of the time. Although I once got matched with 6 other Steve Harrington's in one game. That was fun, too bad the lobby was glitched.
---
I get that these are supposed to be cute, but for some reason that demogorgon looks downright cuddly. I wish someone made a plush of that.
---
Yeah, probably right.
---
Yep. 4 man SWF playing toxic?. If you can get desperate you can just camp em. You know the person on hook is screeching for help on comms and they will 9/10 always try to get the save regardless.
---
I don't advocate for camping ever normally, but sometimes you gotta fight fire with fire. 
---
I think a lot of the time killers vs SWF and often don't realize because they just play normally, but its the toxic crews that make it obvious that we all remember.
---
Am I the only one who things that "We're Gonna Live Forever" should be buffeted to be as useful as "Barbecue &amp; Chilli"?

Add ons don't matter too much at your rank.
---
IDC about keys during the gen phase but if I close the hatch and they open it back up it's bullshit if one person escapes through hatch during gen phase and I close it gates are powered I hate that
---
I still run both. Good combo.
---
No, it doesn't.
---
Sans and pennywise for dbd
---
You may have made a mistake here. I slightly disagreed with him and he hit my DMs harassing me like a KKK member but with even worse grammar.
---
i don't know if it's obvious, it wasn't for me, but you gotta learn that you can and sometimes *should* cancel your frenzy. i used to just stay in it and hope i'd find someone, but if i hit someone and can't see/hear anyone else then i'll usually cancel or double down on the same person. (mechanically it's pretty much the same, it just makes it easier to keep following them after the cooldown.)
---
similarly, killer instinct is a great tool for getting a general idea where everyone is. the annoying thing is it's impossible to actually tell how far away they are, so that's the kind of thing you have to weigh up when it comes to terror radius perks and add-ons; whether you prefer to know who's immediately nearby or which direction everyone is in.
---
honestly, much as i love them, legion's actually a pretty average m1 killer outside of frenzy. people think of them as quite fast, but (and i say this never having played her) i *think* they might actually be less mobile than spirit, so you may notice that. something i'm personally trying to learn is playing mindgames and getting better at closing loops, because that's especially important when you have less power to fall back on.
---
and when all else fails: run fast, stab lots
---
Then keep safety pipping and stop complaining. If you want to pip, play the game in a way that helps you do that.
---
I'm just making a comparison since theres no way they would make a high def face in a game that's meant to be pretty low resolution. And like the other guy said no one expects everything that's put in ads or even trailers. And yes the oni looks great  hes a bad ass and I wanna big smash some baby dweets.
---
unless you're ghostface. by all accounts he's having a great time
---
I knew it
---
As soon as DC punishments comes, all survivors will start freaking out. It seems I was right
---
I'll only teabag at the exit gate if I want the killer to hit me so they can get more bloodpoints. A lot of survivors do that and a lot of killers don't realize it
---
Dude it‚Äôs just a fuckin rant post, who gives a fuck. Go back to insidious camping in the basement, let the players who actually have more than 2 hours in the game have their fun
---
I thought it was a guy but I think I'm remembering the remake instead.

I thought taking off your pants was more of a Myers thing

As though a bunch of weeaboo Killers don‚Äôt DC for literally everything.
---
And, shocker, I didn‚Äôt DC, even in this shitty situation. I haven‚Äôt purposely DC‚Äôed in a very long time, but being in this situation definitely tempted me.
---
At least a Killer can lobby dodge if they see someone who decimated them in a previous game, or just played like an asshole. As survivor, I don‚Äôt have that luxury.
---
Or maybe don't post extremely common stuff. It's why seeing iri emblem posts get annoying after some time.
---
The fuck do you mean "cheesing wins". You win or you lose, it shouldn't matter how. At the end of the day, if you won, you should get a pip, if you lost, you should depip, it the journey shouldn't matter if the end result is perfect.
---
Strategy noted
---
No noed tho. You would be exposed, and that jake didnt get downed instantly when hit either. No noed
---
In the double-digit ranks, it's about 1/3 toxic teams, with a few more solo sweatlords. The rate seems to depend on who you play, though. Trapper gets more respect than Wraith, Billy, or anyone used with a Splinter.
---
Just like Epstein, ornaments aren't going to hang themselves.
---
Iron Will alone is a top tier perk and criminally underused.
---
Why pay money for DbD2 when the original would have like 30+ killers by the time it could even release?
---
Huh, that really sucks. What platform if you don't mind me asking?
---
Yeah, but you can't rank up as Killer because you can't play.
---
For context, he opened a chat with me before the match started and sent this. He played Bubba on the game and the match was relatively normal so I thought he was just memeing as he shook his head whenever I looped a pallet he refused to break. Then a Meg broke his totem and she was face-camped to death. My question is how people can find playing like this fun?
---
To his credit though, he did let a different Meg go during end-game although I don't see why.
---
Yeah, i get that, i‚Äôve gotten quite a few messages about why i was throwing up on them and i just said it‚Äôs what i have to do.
---
I mean you‚Äôre taking way too far for really no reason.
---
That perm is impeccable
---
What can i say other than delete this
---
Aannnnnd the laziest post of r/deadbydaylight goes to....
---
That's, like, your opinion.
---
If you're so bothered by someone calling out a salty, entitled survivor **who is literally suggesting people break the rules**, then maybe that's a you thing more than anything.
---
C H O N K
---
That wasn't the full outfit. Thanks for the feedback!
---
Unfortunately, the game is balanced around average kill rates and seemingly ignores the impact of SWFs, so a truly optimal Survivor team is anywhere from virtually to actually invincible, depending on what you brought.  You can counter individual aspects of what you see, but Killer has 4 perk slots with which to counter 4 sets of 4, and one must be Ruin.
---
*Find Release*
---
So only 2  survivors in ur example then. That scenerio looks pretty end game to me.
---
These are so adorable!  
---
I'd also love a perk icon pack in the same style too \^\^
---
Thanks to you all. I went on to jakes bloodweb then will work on tapps next!
---
In front of this, I would DC every time just because it would freak me out
---
Well when it's swf and you're getting shined every which way by flashlights, I can see how it can be seen as toxic, especially if they're hardly doing gens and wasting most of the game to bully you.
---
You‚Äôre doing more crying than OP did at this point
---
Empathy is your friend for this, or aftercare, to keep track of when theyre gonna go down and be ready to hook em.
---
üòÇüëç
---
Same reason people dc when they are the first caught by the killer.
---
Thanks, I'm kinda new.
---
Especially against a basement build, that requires a but of knowledge to try and pull off. Didnt bully anybody. Just hasn't played killer in awhile.
---
Where's Oni and Yuri?
---
I'd buy them.
---
Imo it doesnt really favor the killer. All it does prolong the game slightly. But a longer match means nothing if the killer can't get hooks due to constant blinding.
---
good add-ons on the plague are the ones that increase effectiveness. What it does is when you vomit on a survivor it quickens the time and amount it will take for them to become broken. If you run the two best effectiveness add-ons you can usually have a survivor hit the broken status with one charge of her vomit.
---
cuteee
---
It doesn't
---
I'm rank 11 killer and my average survivor matchups are rank 6 (basically red ranks)
---
Well he didn't *need* to. If he got hit, he could have literally run straight through the Trapper. Killers don't have collision while they're wiping their blade. Still entertaining to watch though.
---
Which is bullshit
---
Thank
---
How is any of this crying?
---
I called out OP on their crying post. (No crying here)
---
Someone tried calling me out as a camping killer. I replied that I was a survivor main. (No crying here)
---
You said I'm taking this "way too far for really no reason." I told you that was more of a you issue than anything else. (Still no crying)
---
Now you say I'm crying more than the post... Because in your mind there's been any crying on this comment chain?
---
You're an odd person with a strange view of reality.
---
Also - This post isn't crying either... How very odd.
---
Apples are some of the best for her, they‚Äôre pretty much necessary to use Corrupt Purge unless you‚Äôre at Rank 15 or something
---
Dont fucking save them. Go do gens and escape. The killer WANTS you to get pissed and to go save.
---
I want to see this from Ghostface's POV
---
It‚Äôs not the mori, it‚Äôs the reasoning
---
Congratulations but
---
*There is another Yoda Meme*
---
I mean that does work, the hatch is completely random, and does take effort to find for all parties. It also has a ton more hurdles to get to for the survivor, whereas for killer it gets progressively easier to use a (Ebony) Mori as any braindead killer can easily win a 3v1 or 2v1 etc. with needing a fraction of the hooks/downs to eliminate survivors.
---
How about people here stop pretending that the hatch just auto spawns in front of survivors for all of them to jump out every game, we all know that rarely happens, but because it happened to you in that one killer match, it is now broken.
---
I agree with you, it‚Äôs a game if you can‚Äôt handle it don‚Äôt play. I played since release and I honest don‚Äôt take the game serious anymore. I hook people and kill people as killer and do gens and loop as survivor. I like to meme with both killer and survivor but people take the game too serious and that‚Äôs what is wrong with the game.
---
Small group here but I prefer Premonition way more then spine chill. Spite the cool down I just like knowing where he's coming from
---
I already had 3 before the update, it did count. It just didnt show me the golden icon or let me collect it, instead i already had the BPs+rift fragments already added. It's likely what happened to you.
---
I had a man yell at me and threaten to report me for "pallet camping". The man was going to report me for looping ... like i'm sorry for not letting you kill me.
---
There are some knobs to balance here probably but I think the idea is sound. It likely wouldn‚Äôt address the whole slugging for the 4K issue we see with the hatch now, but realistically I dunno what would.
---
It takes two to tango. Why isolate each side into separate groups? Its important that if you exclusively main one side to at least hear what the other side thinks on matters. Even if you disagree, you can never have too many perspectives.
---
Yes... Anything within the game mechanics and not on the reportable list is fair game.
---
And yes, being camped sucks. And yes, you're allowed to rant about it. Your suggestion to DC hits up on the whole "reportable" aspect of not allowed though. Makes it worse than the camping, as ironic as that is.
---
But I feel you on the frustration aspect, and I respect the step back and acceptance that people get to play how people want.
---
Hopefully the rest of your night is better. &lt;3
---
can i use that blood web thing and level up and bypass some bullshit queue? or do i HAVE to play the killer?
---
You‚Äôre over here crying about OP and how he didn‚Äôt like the way his opponent played. It wasn‚Äôt crying until you had your tantrum calling him an entitled hypocrite, how you and everyone else can call him a bitchy little crybaby, that translation that you posted to OP and someone else. Why are you so upset?

The hex symbol isn‚Äôt on the screen? Noed had to have been destroyed.

Actually, it's more:

&gt; Look at this guy thinking his fun is more important than his opponent's fun. And he's suggesting to DC, which means he thinks his fun is more important than his other survivors' fun as well! Seems like he's nothing more than a hypocrite who doesn't care about anyone else.
---
I'm still curious about what it looks like for the surv tho. I had Decisive on Unnerving once, tiny ass bitch. Imagine that with Overcharge
---
You keep using that word, "crying." I don't think you know what it means.
---
Calling OP out isn't me crying. It's me calling him out.
---
Because killer memes are so much better? Honestly I'm getting tired of seeing memes of survivors bad killer good or killer used this perk so they deserved to lose. Like just stop. using perks isnt unfair or toxic they have a purpose some are better than others and some are annoying but still from someone who plays both. killer mains and survivor mains seem to act like children who sit here and try to justify being an ass because the other person was using something that was implemented into the game. Like for fuck sake if you dont like no ed then cleanse yes its annoying but it's still a way to get rid of it. And stop complaining about survivor perks being strong it's getting annoying
---
I would personally slug the key user any chance I get once the hatch spawns. If I notice they are trying to get multiple survivors out, keeping survivors separated is what I would aim for. It also depends on the stage of the game, how many gens are done how many hooks does each survivor have, who is dead, what killer am I, what map is it? etc.
---
If slugging is out the question I would focus more on the other survivors technically, worst case scenario just that ONE survivor gets out and either I close the hatch or 30 seconds later nobody else gets to it because I occupied them. If it's at the point where all 4 are going for hatch, I admit defeat at that point simply because I was losing that match already as it's 5 gens done, 4 people alive, maybe I can get 1 if I don't get greedy.
---
I have nothing against survivors bringing good stuff, even though I'm saying I think the 2 are unequal, I personally don't have a problem against Mori's either, I will get salty in the moment if I'm the first survivor dead 2 minutes in the match(Actually had a match like this recently where a ghostface facecamped me in basement while a Meg did a botched hook save and I died instantly from his Mori, the cherry on top was because I got downed from his exposed status because I stopped to stare at him for 5 seconds and somehow fail at revealing him) I'll just go to the next because that match was nothing anyway, inversely at least in key matches that I "lose" as rare as they happen I still played practically a full game and had my fun out of it regardless, I'm not one of those people who need a 4k 2pip every match to have fun as killer.
---
actually it‚Äôs more:
---
&gt;Look at this dude wanting to have a fair game. That‚Äôs pretty fucking scummy ngl
---
It doesn't reward you for playing poorly. It punishes survivors for genrushing and ignoring totems.

---
Get nae naed
---
They make the emblems so that you get them by actually playing. Tunneling and camping won't get you there, so it's an attempt to prevent those. But of course every other match involves one of those two.
---
She's not exposed though...
---
It‚Äôs silly. People already get worked up about echo chambers... so they want to make official echo chambers, lol. 
---
It seems that this sub is biased towards whatever side you don‚Äôt like, based on the complaining I see.
---
Even Killer mains think noed is trash. If you have to rely on noed that means you played bad

I'm not going to play worse so the enemy has a chance. I'm the killer, I'm going to try to kill the survivors as fast and efficiently as possible. The pip system doesn't recognize the fact that winning fast is still a win. A wins a win a loss is a loss. Survivors can do all of the gens and escape in about three minutes. It's also bullshit when they win that fast and safety pip rather than pip.

Thank you!!

Because I'm understanding that you're implying camping is unfair, hence my comment.

He didnt he was a rank 16 killer
---
You job as killer is to prevent generators being completed and the escape of the survivors.
---
Your job as survivor is to power Generators and escape. Totems are not a primary objective. With out perks you dont need to do totems.
---
If you fail at preventing Generators being completed you are playing poorly. Now the gates are powered and you get the ability to one shot. This means you are rewarded for playing poorly. Just like DS rewards survivors for playing poorly.
---
I mean at that point that is 2-3 purple/red rarities for just an item, it isn't cheap and the risk of losing even part of it let alone all of it vs. what it can do seems fair to me.
---
er... no? i‚Äôm not implying camping is unfair. might wanna take a look at the first comment of this thread
---
It‚Äôs pretty good on the switch. Matches are usually instant for survivors and 1-5 mins for killers. The game runs well overall just doesn‚Äôt look as good as the consoles or PC.
---
''i PLaY bOtH SiDES''
---
You're one of the most obvious survivor mains I've seen on this subreddit lmao
---
Freddy... Maybe. I've not mucked about with him much, but the only time he gives me trouble is when he has fake pallets (forever Freddy as well). Demo, definitely not, demo you can hear coming a mile off and never really get caught out by his attack unless he was going to get you anyway. Ghostface isn't really an m1 killer, neither is pig (if you are chasing for hits more than stealthing for them, you are playing them at their lowest potential.)
---
Legion is quiet, hard to see, injures players and gives loads of information (the only way to have a chance as killer is to know where people are and what they are doing). That being said, the upcoming nerf might destroy what little viability they had left with the sloppy butcher/mend time debuff.
---
Just go play killer for a bit and then come back. You will understand. And I don‚Äôt mean at rank 20.
---
Sorry sir, heres my injured bum. Please smack away, your feelings as to how the game should be played matter more than my fun.
---
I always farm if one person dc‚Äôs immediately
---
I couldn't agree more.
---
Imagine even caring about getting into a match with someone "famous"
---
Understand what?I play killer.In a ratio 70-30.What is there to understand?That sometimes you lose?And you feel like absolute shit?Yeah I know that feeling.But why blame the other party?
---
All I got from this is a survivor main who thinks killers should just let survivors be toxic af towards them with no repercussion

You mad yet?

Any advice on Tome 2‚Äôs challenge for ‚ÄúDrop 15 pallets in a chase‚Äù? 
---
I‚Äôve done several games and only have the 2/15 done.
---
I feel like if the survivor starts spamming it instantly it means they‚Äôre camping, but if it‚Äôs been 20-30 seconds of them just sitting there and then they start spamming it, it means no one is coming for them. At least, that‚Äôs how I do it.
---
Lmao sure with a cherry picked circumstance like that. In reality it‚Äôs just impossible to take someone‚Äôs word that they ‚Äúweren‚Äôt actually camping they just saw someone‚Äù
---
In my opinion, an m1 killer is a killer that has to play the survivors version of the chase game (run at them and m1, no powers, no stealth, no bypass.) Survivors can loop them, abuse good pallets/windows, all the stuff that suvivor mains think is fun (and it is, I would like the game to be like this if the gens didn't pop so stupidly quick).
---
Claudette pulled off some Dennis the Menace shit on that Trapper.
---
Then enjoy your ultra rare match.
---
Thats the worst one. I cant hear the fucking thing and im stretching theb i miss it
---
I actually like Kate mains j haven‚Äôt seen any really toxic Kate Mains.
---
Glad you're looking for advice :) My advice typically is if you're trying to RUSH doing that objective, so keep that in mind - it's not exactly "team friendly"
---
My advice for that one would be to instigate chases. I'd bring a good exhaustion perk (like Lithe or Balanced Landing) as well as Windows of Opportunity (this let's you see vaults/pallets in the area - it's a Kate Denson perk). 
---
So make some noise at the start of the game to get their attention and book it to a pallet. Don't worry about stunning since you only need to drop the pallet. Make sure the chase music is going off and toss that sucker down and start looking for the next pallet/jungle-gym node. If you're focusing it like this you'll probably get it done in 2-3 games depending on your skill of looping the killer.
---
Wait... So you're unhappy that I called out the person who DCs because they don't get a map that is optimal for their killer choice?
---
And you think that calling that out as complaining or whining is somehow wrong? You'd just ignore it and let them continue?
---
What's your goal in all this? Like, really...
---
It's cause we suck too much to even try being toxic, lmao.
---
i think you will have to update them because of the new chapter coming tomorrow. not trying to say anything rude, its just I realy want to see the oni in your art style
---
I've played with/against Monto and his gf, played with Puppers, faced survivor Zubat, faced huntress Ralph, faced Bubba ScottJund, played with/against Vincent Vega, faced survivor Cahlaflour, faced survivor JenDenise. You eventually just run into them over the course of playing
---
Understand that gen speed is a problem, here is a [video](https://youtu.be/niONqC9GMXk) of gen speed being a problem. Of course it‚Äôs not an excuse to be toxic but when the game sets you up for failure and on top of it survivors use all the crutches to make it even worse it is frustrating.
---
Isn‚Äôt Oni one of her ancestors?
---
There's nothing wrong with noed. It can easily be countered with detectives hunch before all five gens are even done. And Mori requires the killer to have hooked you already, so not really op unless they tunnel. The whole complaining about keys and noeds is dumb, imo.
---
As well as the aforementioned killer rank wait time relation, the time of day you play also matters.  There's more survivors, proportionately, the later it gets at night.  High rank killer times around midnight can be nearly instant, but low rank ques during midday last forever.
---
This is fact
---
Thank you üòä
---
Gotta have somewhere to fit that big smile of his
---
Uh, really? Calling out Ruin mid chase is toxic? Using Object of Obsession for location callouts is toxic? 
---
I play both survivor and killer rather evenly (usually if I'm alone I play killer) and honestly I hope you're joking. People communicating and using perks to benefit themselves isn't toxic. I can't even be mad if good, non toxic SWF groups do really well against me. I'm a killer, with a special ability, and the ability to knock down and even sometimes outright kill the survivors. If they can evade me long enough to get rid of Hex totems and call out my location via a perk that actively allows me, as a Killer, see their location as well- then by all means, props to them. 
---
On the flipside, if my team is struggling with skill checks, and I get chased and call out a hex totem I saw- why the hell is that toxic? Because I'm trying to give me and my team a fighting chance?
---
It really is dumb
---
So it completely negates killer perk status effects, AND it gives you extra bloodpoints for no reason? That's messed up.
---
My job is to kill survivors and it shouldn't bother you how am I going to do that. 
---
Noed or better say the possibility of noed forces survivors to cleanse totems and if they refuse, they will face consequences.
---
well... It‚Äôs not exactly whining is it? you‚Äôve called this post whining, and this comment whining. There is a massive difference between complaining and whining
---
Excuse me but he applies 0 gen pressure taht game.He would have lost either way because doctor is a pretty bad killee but he made a lot of bad calls and then complained that about gen speed.
---
Yikes this sub has so much blind rage sometimes. This guy downvoted to hell even though he‚Äôs RIGHT. There‚Äôs no exposed symbol at all the guy is fine
---
oni: "you are one hawt fortune cookie"
---
Like so if everyone escaped you get extra points?
---
He‚Äôs playing legion though?
---
Short answer: Yes. 
---
Long answer: It‚Äôs not really a binary of ‚Äúnever ever tunnel and never ever camp no matter what‚Äù or ‚Äúalways hard tunnel and always face-camp‚Äù. As a killer there are moments where you need to patrol, or need to clear an area before moving on. Depending on how many gens left, you‚Äôre actively giving a kill away. 
---
Imagine the exit gates are open and someone is on a hook with at least one survivor alive. Would you just walk away to the other side of the map or check the area? If you see scratchmarks or hear more sounds of injury, why would you not stay around? 
---
And on tunneling, there‚Äôs a big difference between ‚Äúdrop everything and kill one guy‚Äù and ‚Äúkilling off the weak link‚Äù. Being tunnelled the way I see it is a means of a killer admitting they are feeling too pressured/out of control of the match‚Äôs speed. 
---
When I play Killer I assess how long my chases are or how fast people are doing gens. If the gens are going slow then I can take my time to let people go or intentionally two hook people and just meme for a bit. If he gens go by fast because the survivors are playing much better then I‚Äôm going to capitalize on any mistakes they make. 
---
Deeper Answer: Play Killer More and see how that logic works.
---
Please no, not again
---
Except, if you get Genrushed and then sac everyone at the end of the game if your anywhere above brown ranks you depip. You still technically lose. Your job is not to solely sacrifice. Your comments just keep proving you are low rank.
---
Had to make a reddit account and stop lurking just to say that this was supposed to be a lightning round 20 min commission, didn't know what oni looked like, and I forgot what I was doing halfway through...
---
Oh I just assumed it was the doctor video since it has the same title.Legion is even worse but Ill see if he played better than what I expected.
---
right? i have been trying to show people but i'm not huge in this community so no one believes me
---
I think Ebony Moris are unfair, but I also see them as the only effective way to deal with Decisive in almost every game. Yeah yeah, you can tell me not to "tunnel", but the fact that it practically makes survivors invincible for 60 seconds, long enough to start and finish a chase *against someone else*, long enough to do a gen 75% of the way, and long enough to get picked up if you're slugged (unless the killer spends the whole minute just sitting next to you, in which every other survivor can pretty much finish up 3 gens).
---
imo Moris and Decisive both need to be changed, because it ruins the flow for both sides of the game. Keys are another issue, but not on the scale of DS and Moris.
---
Maybe Moris could be changed to keep Yellow the way it is, Green to a single survivor that's been unhooked once 2/3 gens are done, and Pink to a single survivor that's been unhooked without any gens done. Decisive could be changed to only last 45 seconds when in a Killer's Terror Radius, and 20 seconds when outside of it. Possibly even keep the 60 seconds, but only when on Death Hook.
---
i know right? i have been trying to show people but i'm not huge in the community so no one listens to me
---
Why say that like it‚Äôs a bad thing?
---
I already finished them üòÇ
---
You really just used the term "ge rushing" yup, you've lost all your credibility right there.
---
It's an unfair advantage, and the games not designed for it. You know it's not designed for it because the devs have said that they dont want to add voice communication, and there is a reason the survivors cant communicate very well.
---
Complete 4 generators in a single trial using dark sense. Even without dark sense in one trial? How am I gonna do 4/5 gens? What if I get chased or hooked and two are finished? This one is almost impossible
---
Imagine thinking moris are less bullshit than keys.
---
There is no "deserve". If he killed, as long as it is not cheating, it doesn't matter how he did it. Same with escaping. Just give your team some time if that happened to you.
---
Multiple times the survivor was close enough to the exit and the trapper missed and they could‚Äôve ran out even with being hit
---
The only problem I can see with this idea would be reworking the ‚ÄúWhere Did They Go!?‚Äù achievement, because if it was a 1-man per key, without bringing them in, then this achievement‚Äôd be even rarer than Left Behind.
---
still looks good
---
What counter is there to a mori?
---
So it‚Äôs accurate then?
---
i'm well aware that moris are easier to use than keys, i'm saying from the opponent's perspective, there's not much you can do to counter it for either of them. in both cases you're kinda just at the item's mercy.
---
Looks great!
---
I‚Äôm proud of you ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
‚ÄúThanks for the medkit, bitch!‚Äù
---
How many memes about slugging the second to last survivor are you gonna post in one day? How is this not considered spam by now
---
One of chilledchaos's friends
---
That video shows me that he needs to shut his mouth and play the game, rather than casually walking around and talking the whole time not focusing.
---
Perhaps patrol the gens once and awhile? Or maybe pay attention to the 300 gen pops that happen instead of tunneling one person around the map for 3 minutes?
---
Or how about running some decent perks that actually help him do something in-game? Or maybe not keep taking survivors to the basement?
---
It took him forever to make his way to the exit doors at the end because of his casual "I don't give a fuck anymore" attitude. 
---
I can find about 10 things he could have been doing better to improve his gameplay, but sure we can blame the gen time. Though not sure how that explains how in like 70% of my games we cannot finish more than 3 gens, but ok.
---
Ya know, for all the "complaining" this sub says survivors do, I never seem to see that here. Huh.
---
ah i had no idea. thanks for letting me know
---
That‚Äôs not even cheating. Noed is a perk implemented in the game. Tunneling is literally a good strategy that survivor mains bitch about. That‚Äôs not unfair, it‚Äôs strategic.
---
Hmm ok well it didn't turn gold or anything maybe it just wasn't obvious about it but it did allow me to go past that node
---
Joey listening to X Gon' Give It To Ya whilst stabbing you
---
Okay, I‚Äôm not on PC so I don‚Äôt have dedicated servers, we still have people who lag switch. I didn‚Äôt know I was talking to the one and only Master of Lag, forgive me lord. Shall I bow down at your feet, for I am a mere peasant compared to you. Clearly I know nothing, truly you are the only one who actually knows. The rest of us savages only wish to know what you truly know.
---
Ah thank you, so it must have just not had the golden visual appearance then when I "claimed" it
---
He‚Äôs doing it because he depipped after a killer slugged his friend and killed him. He‚Äôs still salty about it. That‚Äôs my assumption.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who saw something completely different.
---
I posted a more lengthy change in this post but the way both are just feels bad from the receiving end. Putting the moris on death hook wouldn't make them useless because ebony you can still mori everyone green still has its restriction and yellow has its. I like your idea with the keys but imo they are just too over powered rn. No tweak would make them function similarly and people be ok with then them. I'd say revamp the end game and remove keys altogether.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs just cause since you passed the past limit it kind‚Äôve didn‚Äôt register that you had already completed the new challenge so it just needed a quick reboot! Have fun!
---
I'd love the thing but it needs a rework, that's way too strong against solo queues and fucking useless against SWF.
---
How about it's killer power is a short transformation, say 60 seconds, with a large cooldown. You take on the form of one of the survivors, cosmetics and all. Maybe you can only injure them in this form for balance sake. So you'd transform, bamboozle a surv and then change back ASAP to carry on the chase and go for the down.
---
Thank you sir! This sure took a while to get the clips and edit, but it was worth it haha
---
If you are rank 6, and your friend is like rank 17. You will not get a rank 17 lobby. You will get lobbies rank 1-rank 12. You can‚Äôt just do an swf with your low rank friend to get in a low rank lobby. It will match up with the highest rank person in the group.
---
Oh I‚Äôve got atleast 50 more
---
And Olsen's address book!
---
"massive difference"
---
The one word is literally in the definition of the second word.
---
And yeah, DCing because you got a map that may not be optimal for your character of choice is childish.
---
Why wouldn't it? It would eliminate a random escape by chance. Atleast this way you can say well he deserved to get away from me. Instead of well he found the hatch before me. Slugging for the 4k has to do more with points I think rather than getting a 4k. The way killers have it now 3k and a hatch escape could be a black pip.
---
Ding-dong any opinion opposite to upvoted in top is wrong.
---
Prove me wrong. From my experience both are not fun, but at least you can expect mori, while keys are unexpected in 90% cases.
---
I agree, I don't think that keys and Mori's should be in the game as it just makes it one-sided and unenjoyable for the opposing side.
---
He patrolled the gens. The gens pooping is exactly the problem we are discussing they go too fast. He didn‚Äôt cause one person around the map for three mins if you pay attention it‚Äôs two different Claudettes. His perks are as good as they get for slowing down the game. The basement is the only thing that gave him momentum and a kill. At the end two survivors had adrenaline its game over after that he was trying to find the one injured survivor. If your team can only fix 3 gens your bad lol. I can solo three gens through ruin while my team farms some one off a hook. In the video he specially mentions this. You just be allergic to gens.
---
I barely know him. All I remember is he is a friend of chilledchaos. I will take any bit of happiness I can get in this world. Sorry if this interfered with yours.
---
I agree with everything  expect  the final, hatch race is kinda killer favoured because of speed(and even faster  if you have killers like Billy or legion) and even the second chance is really hard to get and is mostly RNG
---
Yes i have like 16 left and about 100 of the common version. Being p3 lv50 is expansive
---
At this point, you‚Äôre nitpicking what I said.
---
Also, the ACTION may be childish, but the complaining is inherently not done in a childish manner, so it‚Äôs not whining.
---
It is! Combining it with the chewed pen is a nice combo.
---
Sounds about right. Every single post he makes is about how it‚Äôs toxic to slug and on all of them nearly everybody disagrees with him
---
I honestly dont remember, had this music file download on my pc like a year ago and thought it would fit for a hitbox montage lol
---
Great, I know more about the old servers any way. I had monstrously bad lag back then and you would be surprised how many people called lagswitch. 
---
I didn‚Äôt know you console users didn‚Äôt have dedicated servers yet. 
---
But yeah, lag switches and normal lag are identical, only you think of normal lag as 150ms, some people get 1000ms upwards, and at that point there isn‚Äôt a difference
---
6 posts in the last 12 hours about slugging the second to last survivor to get the last one. Just sad.
---
It‚Äôs 1400x2488, and took me around two days.
---
I mean that's awesome and all but we should be able to stockpile or at least earn capacity upgrades. Log matches, flag unusually high amounts, something besides this.. it's painful.
---
No I don‚Äôt play survivor a lot

I‚Äôve been trying to get screencaps petting the crows with all different characters I‚Äôm so happy others have this idea
---
Yeah... he should have done that
---
Don‚Äôt forget the one that he posted yesterday(doesn‚Äôt appear on his profile for some reason) about saying that in tru3‚Äôs chat and people getting triggered
---
What about the oni?
---
So you are implying that ranked system correctly represents how good was the player during the match? In that case why doesn't it gives a reward for players who ran the killer for the whole game and got camped in the end? Why doesn't it reward 4k in first 60 seconds of the game? Why doesn't it reward people who got camped while gens were done during that? Ranked system is broken and it only shows that the player did as much objectives as possible. The old one was better, at least for killers, as it directly showed the effectiveness of a killer by giving him rank for kills.
---
And yes, I won if I downed all 4 survivors with noed while all gens have been completed. And it is their fault, unless I am playing nurse or spirit, which are my least favourite and least played killers.
---
this is fucking blessed
---
Half glass full type people here..
---
could be used to punish whiffed attacks at people who vault windows,  you could quickly turn around after they dink the wall and stun them but the downside would be you'd need to slow vault as to not activate it prematurely. Also if the killer is carrying a teammate close to a wall you could vault a window he walks past to get him to drop the survivor
---
I don't care about NoED. It can easily be countered
---
Tunnelling OTOH is unfair. Do you exploit the weak ones IRL to get advantage in real life? Because that's what you're basically telling us.
---
That you have no hesitation to use the dirtiest, most scumbag tactics on the weakest person to win. You may not be a killer in real life but your rotten personality showed through and through here.
---
I had a Claudette literally spirit phasing everywhere today
---
250k. During the only triple BP event, We're Gonna Live Forever (pre nerf) and a couple party streamers burned. That was a good time.
---
how is teabagging warranted and non-toxic here? regardless of if the killer deserved it, i have a hard time seeing teabagging as anything but an intent to be an ass.
---
Doesn't matter to me
---
My point was that you get to know how to track survivors after playing killer for a while, They could also have BBQ and didn't see anyone, leading to thinking that at least 1 person must be nearby.  
---
  
---
Also, after you hook someone and they get unhooked 10 seconds later, you assume that they will get unhooked in the same amount of time again.  
---
There are a multitude of reasons why a killer might stick around the hook for a while longer. It's a risk/benefit thing. If you guess right you get to find someone easily, if you guess wrong, you lose precious time that the gens might be getting done during.  
---
The point is that there's multiple reasons why a killer might think a survivor is nearby, if only a hunch. You can't prove what they were thinking, but that's a moot point isn't it? The point is that it's likely and very possible.
---
If you can get a 4k with just NOED, those aren‚Äôt very good survivors
---
Yeah Dedicated Servers are only for PC. I thought everyone got Dedicated servers too, but no it was only for PC. Kind of a downer actually. Though apparently dedicated servers have their own issues so eh, pros and cons. 
---
Whenever I have issues in a game I start recording it, and I can usually tell if it‚Äôs on my end or a killer‚Äôs/survivor‚Äôs. It‚Äôs not always a guarantee sure, but I think I‚Äôve gotten the hang of telling the difference.
---
Dbd is not real life bud, tunneling doesn‚Äôt show anything about your real life personality. Tunneling isn‚Äôt unfair, bring BT and DS to counter it. Hitting a 1 hit survivor instead of 2 hit is what everyone would do unless they are worried of what other people think of them.
---
New here eh? Lmao kidding, but seriously feelsbadman. Ranking system sucks
---
Had one huntress that let me open the gates and leave, got them again the next match and we immediately recognized each other by nodding in agreement, they killed my teammates and gave me the gates again
---
Bloodpoints are shared between everyone, survivors and killers. You can level a killer to 50 and might never have played him. In fact, lots of people have done just that in the case of bubba!
---
This meme is a thing of beauty
---
Do you have the template good sir?
---
Pop goes the weasel...Let's see, Gens get done before you get to them to kick them most of the time so no.
---
Thanatophobia....you need to be lucky enough to find survivors all in close proximity and hope they dont run healing perks
---
Sloppy butcher....Countered by inner strength and survivors just not healing at all
---
Ruin gets cleanses
---
Corrupt intervention lasts so long
---
Surge?, Yeah...No
---
You have to snowball, know when to make the right play, For example, You see multiple people?, time to slug, take every advantage you get because at red ranks people don't give you much, Don't go with a chase too long, if it takes more then a jungle-Jim loop-length and you're not sure if you're gonna get them give up on them...or stick with them so they dont immediately go work on a gen when you leave!... I dont know how to pressure gens, I'm sorry but I said what I could about it
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll look into it
---
Keys and Moris are both stupid and both should be changed. Noed is unhealthy for the game imo.
---
Honestly I don't mind, games all about the fun! And then there's the meme builds...
---
Could you give advice with the grab survivors challenge
---
Something I‚Äôve learnt in red ranks is that there‚Äôs just some games where you do everything right but still lose. The survivors are 100% efficient on comms, gens are spaced all over the map and windows are in the right place for a near infinite!
---
Good work! That's super impressive
---
I mean... It answers itself no? "How are the crows?" Startled!
---
It honestly depends on the killer. While many killers are viable, some just don‚Äôt have any gen pressure. Who do you play mostly? Btw if you didn‚Äôt add that last part you‚Äôd be getting flamed in about 5 seconds
---
Chewed pen might as well be a hyper rare add on cuz I see it maybe once every 5 new webs if I‚Äôm lucky.
---
Body blocking would make me mad too. Not enough to try to hunt someone down though lol.
---
God damn that‚Äôs a lot, also when/how did it get nerfed?
---
Salty killers? Or just logical thinkers? Strange how out of all of your posts there‚Äôs only been 1 or 2 people in the comments that actually agree with you that slugging is toxic
---
i knew that it was fucked, but in all the time i played this game the worst was that when they played SWF, atleast ONE of them was close to my ranke, but in this case it makes no sense at all.
---
[here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ1oBNsl09g)  is another good example of gen speeds. Homie gets off 8 uses of pgtw, has short chases, and swing chains and they still almost get all the gens done. Like how much more pressure can one be expected to exert?

Who dcs against a wraith lol.

Just some thoughts of my own. I probably don‚Äôt have the balance right but I thought it would be fun to make up. I imagine the Nostromo as a map and the hooks could be made of the extruded drool aliens use and look like ‚Äúcocoons‚Äù or ‚Äúnesting material‚Äù. I would love this.
---
The Mori could be a facehugger/chestburster animation?
---
Thoughts?
---
Lol why are you so hung up on a post get off your period
---
ive done 2now
---
I have 30 of them, And I don't feel like using any, every time I go to click on one I instead play the game addonless, that chewed pen us fucking sacred.
---
Applying maximum pressure to survivors, don't let they get comfortable. Slug if you need to, the more you make the team occupied with something other than generators, the better. Of course, you can always use ruin, but I would recommend trying without it, you will be a much better killer. Try discordance, corrupt intervention, pop goes the weasel, surveillance and even surge (even if it's not that good). The rest I would say will vary depending on the killer you are playing
---
They say it‚Äôs based on the highest rank (as in ‚Äúbest‚Äù player) in the swf, but that‚Äôs horseshit. Sometimes you might, and if you aren‚Äôt a fourman it‚Äôs pretty common to get high rank teammates. And then in endgame you see it‚Äôs a baby huntress with nothing but lullaby or some shit and you‚Äôre like how the fuck did you get here lol.
---
A thing of beauty
---
Spirit late at night when the sweats are on. Im trying bily but hes not working out for me too much
---
yeah you can usually tell if its the killers lag or not, but determining if its a lag switch or if he lives at mcdonalds is another story, so they cant dish out perma bans if he could be inno. Hence the serious consequences, they really shouldnt risk it
---
These are so cute! Good job
---
I was expecting the hatch to be right next to the hook lol
---
The mask was homemade, using a Hockey mask, and a ton of paper mache! It's very accurate to the game, and took me a while to make. I can post pictures of it if you guys are interested.
---
Don't worry it's already in motion!  
---
They will refilm the whole movie and put Freddy make-up on Quentin so he also looks horrible just like in the game.
---
Nice
---
Apparently ur a fanboy so I will just agree to disagree with you, since we are apparently speaking two different languages here.
---
1. You're the one trying to nitpick between the two definitions. I'm just linking what those definitions are.
---
2. The complaining is 100% done in a childish manner. It's "If I get a map I don't like, I'm taking my toys and going home!" There's not much more childish than throwing a tantrum over an online video game.
---
Honestly as a billy main I feel like he gets slept on. His gen pressure is insane, he can end chases really fast if you know what curve is, and he‚Äôs one of the few killers that actually takes some skill. I may not be the greatest billy, but I know he‚Äôs one of the best (and IMO THE best killer)
---
Imagine running that with no mither....Infinite unbreakable!
---
What's it do?? I don't use ghostface much
---
isnt the challenge easy because u just have to deplete the key with an attachment? the tuffer part is getting to the challenge on the web
---
Just went against a GF with this. Two people immediately disconnected and then he marked a survivor and hooked them and I had to save them but they got downed again. I escaped tho because he went to patrol the exit gates after he closed the hatch and I opened the gate as he was heading to the other one.
---
oni mah boy too
---
Maybe he was a really good wraith
---
Complain about one at a time, we have had nerfs to BNP two times and both instaheal addons while mories have gone unchanged, I really don't want them to make keys from a situationall clutsh to a almost usless thing before mori get's a change.
---
well they didnt..."screw"...up the pig's newer weapon
---
the best in the west
---
Used to give 200% bonus blood points at 4 stacks. They reduced it to 100% around the time killers got BBQ. I can see why it was nerfed but they need to add something additional to We're Gonna Live Forever to make it similar to BBQ.
---
Better than playing against a really good nurse.
---
I love these lmao good job
---
You can get if first try! I did it 3 times in a row because I kept forgetting to select the challenge.
---
Equip NOED and BLOOD WARDEN, then kill 2 survivors. If the gens aren‚Äôt done become friendly with the last survivors and let them get 5 gens while gaining their trust. 
---
Finally as soon as they pop the last gen smack down one of them and chase the other, and wallah. Open the gates and hook em
---
The worst thing is  that it feels like there is 0 communication between devs and players. Like literally 30% of the survey was about how we like the skins, and more 30% about the recent crossplatform playing.
---
I prefaced this question with "would the game benefit from" as in is that kind of gameplay healthy with the extra offense against killers and also specific defense against it in the form of anti stun perks for killer.
---
He‚Äôs cute ngl.
---
200% was balanced IMO because survivors tend to make less bloodpoints than killers most of the time and also because WGLF has no aura reading ability like BBQ does
---
I rolled the dice, I payed the price
---
One thing at a time, please, first it was BNP and mori, nobody complained about insta heal, Only BNP got nerfed, then it got nerfed again, then insta heal and mori was being complained about nd they nerfed both instaheals but nothing for mori. I just don't want them to nerf keys first.
---
Fuck leatherface
---
Oh yea it's super easy but it kind of hurts data based on key frequency when players are encouraged to use them right now
---
no need to change your mind because you‚Äôre absolutely right
---
1. i‚Äôm taking the definitions for what they are
---
2. it is not, it does not say ‚Äúmap they don‚Äôt like‚Äù they say ‚Äúmap that is not fair‚Äù. it‚Äôs totally different if they, say, dc because they hate Autohaven or whatever, even though it poses no disadvantage or advantage. i get what you‚Äôre trying to say, but it feels like you‚Äôre trying to stretch things out of proportion to fit your viewpoint.
---
i‚Äôm just gonna fuckin move on now, because, believe it or not, i‚Äôd rather do other things than argue about semantics with a stranger on the internet
---
Faster recharge on his night shroud, can‚Äôt remember if it‚Äôs considerably or moderately tho.
---
Ok,  I do see what you mean as, but in my opinion, ebony mori is more annoying for me as you get hooked once, and then if you get farmed or have a healthy survivor take a vault when the killer is coming, and you go down and die can be frustrating. Sure it rarely happens but when it does, I just die inside. Keys on the other hand, feel more balanced as you need to keep it the whole time and can't take a med kit or tool box but if you managed to live till hatch, find it, and have the key, it feels quite nice. 
---
Sorry if I said something wrong as I have only recently returned to the game.
---
I see what you mean all i guess a better way of describing it would be. It would feel less like you lose to a coin flip and more so you lost because of the game. People will always be salty in this game sadly üòÖ.
---
Yeah maybe a token system or something
---
The one that‚Äôs winning is wrong and I hate it. 
---
This is the reason why it‚Äôs fucking hard to trust that signal anymore lol.
---
Yea this was my general Idea of the power where, it has a short(3 Second)animation of transforming so the Survivors got the time to Get the F out. Also the Transformed Human can be random out of the 4 but can never be injured(So the Killer can never be a Injured Survivor).
---
I also agree with the cool-down of the power. but Sadly the Thing would never stand a chance against voicechat.
---
That guy is kinda cringe bro
---
Love your build
---
&gt;  In that case why doesn't it gives a reward for players who ran the killer for the whole game and got camped in the end?
---
It does. They get points for evading the killer though a long chase.
---
&gt; Why doesn't it reward 4k in first 60 seconds of the game? 
---
Because you weren't chasing anyone. They came to you and died. You didn't instill fear in the survivors like the Entity wants you to, thus the entity is displeased.
---
&gt;Why doesn't it reward people who got camped while gens were done during that?
---
You get bonus points for the killer sitting on top of you, and you get points for struggling. In the meanwhile the killer is losing points.
---
&gt; I won if I downed all 4 survivors with noed while all gens have been completed.
---
If your above brown ranks you don't You literally can not get enough emblems to do anything above black pip if you dont win any chase, and get gen rushed and only hook people at the end of the game.
---
I am starting to think winning to you is just killing at least two survivors. Its not. The game is about making points. If you are playing Killer, your goal isnt to kill the survivors. Its to score points, by making the game as hard as you can for the survivors. You can still pip even if you only hook everyone twice, and don't sac anyone as long as you end chases quickly and slow the game down enough. The game isnt about killing people. Its about pleasing the entity.
---
I guess but if you destroy a team and don‚Äôt have to do that I don‚Äôt see why you shouldn‚Äôt pip. That‚Äôs like saying I destroyed some ranked 20s while being a rank 20 so I shouldn‚Äôt pip. I understand how pipping works it‚Äôs just dumb
---
There‚Äôs really no good reason to DC, man. Besides, if enough people report you for DCing, you can get a small ban. Not to mention that you don‚Äôt even get any BPs when you DC. It‚Äôs just losing, except you lose a little extra.
---
Yea mad confusing for me too. I think the confusion is what made it enjoyable for me.
---
B E E G B E E G G H O S T I E
---
They are **literally** DCing when they get a map that is not optimal for Huntress.  That's not "Map that is unfair", that is literally "Map they don't like."
---
Jesus fucking christ, why are you defending a DCer?
---
&gt; Except that they have said they're working on a better communication system for solo queue survivors.
---
Great Sourceless claim bud.
---
Cmon man, every Good Killer has a group of Survivor complaining about it.
---
This guy wishes death upon you and not just you but 40+ more people because he doesn‚Äôt like what you play. 
---
Jeez either it‚Äôs a kid or a grown man with severe problems...
---
Yea really sealed it for me. Never experienced anything like it!
---
Those perks still are useful no matter what you say or think. BT gives an extra hit and gives a head start to get to a pallet or window and try to get away from the killer. I‚Äôve saved so many people with borrowed time and sometimes the killer starts going for me instead of them because they get a head start. DS could be countered by slugging but then people can just bring them back up unless the killer is standing by the body waiting for the timer to be over. Then the killer wastes time doing that which allows survivors to do gens. If you use a good strategy that some people don‚Äôt like, that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre an ass in real life. My friends who play dbd tunnel sometimes and they‚Äôre some of the nicest people I‚Äôve met. Your strategy in games doesn‚Äôt show your personality.
---
Shit memes*
---
This is amazing!!! Must have taken you a while to make plague so props to that. Def saving this post for the future. Do you also have a twitter that I can follow for regular art and other work?
---
I love killers who hunt and kill, but don't camp... you'll always get more points hooking us multiple times!
---
Survivors, if you're gonna teabag, that's the killers' signal to take you down and kill ya!
---
Looks good lol
---
Literally no one has asked for it lol
---
And you my friend just earned iridescent in gatekeeping
---
I feel you, playing hag or legion the corn field hell is just awful.
---
I mean, noed on bubba? He is an instadown killer,  so I see really no need for noed. I'm not defending the guy but he wasnt in the wrong when it comes to noed.
---
Not at the generator
---
I mean theres always gunna be small optimizations you couldve done in every game but the point is if he was 90% of the killer cast in that match there wouldve been 0 chance he could exert enough pressure to even have a chance of winning.
---
This just makes all of these perks really situational and not worth running
---
95% move speed
---
Thanks, i added lightborn because survivors are more willing to stand still for their vitamin bonk if they think they're blinding you
---
Now we just need the Oni!
---
Garbage Garbage Garbage
---
The actor actually responded to them to give them the go ahead
---
I don't see the NOED in the post? Or am I missing something?
---
No, I still see why you wouldn‚Äôt pip. The game wants you to kill them all, but not too quickly. You have to manipulate them a bit. Think of it as a nice mug of hot chocolate. Drink it to soon, and it‚Äôll burn you. Drink it too late, and it‚Äôll just be glorified chocolate milk. You have to be in charge of the match and force/mind game survivors into playing your game.
---
For me it's come and get me .
---
*struggles when picked up*
---
Of to the hook with you too then.
---
What do you consider 'losing' as a killer? I feel like killers always get high points just playing normally.
---
This is a tier 3 yikes
---
It‚Äôs not wrong, it‚Äôs just what the action has turned into now and people need to adapt. They‚Äôve found it easier to utilise that action as a symbol of desperation to other players to come save them whilst the killer is gone than just to use it as a warning signal. 
---
The game‚Äôs changing, players have to change with it. It‚Äôs neither wrong or right, it is what it is.
---
Honestly, If im slugging to get the 4 man and they dc, the fact they rage quit brings me more joy than the 4 man.

I'd just run him around for a good few minutes and bring an instant flashligh

---
Give me your gambling license.
---
Players do have eyes, when you‚Äôre sneaking and within the area where the hooked player is, you can tell a killer is just camping. Silence is as valid an action to indicate a killer is camping, if people decided that was what it was now going to be associated with and spamming attempt unhook button indicated the killer was no longer within the area, come rescue me.
---
I find this question rather redundant as naturally if players were already using the button to indicate that, silence would be the action to tell them not to come. I‚Äôve seen players already do this in matches and utilise the signal to great effect, hence why it‚Äôs now going in this direction. 
---
It‚Äôs neither right nor wrong, there are more players coming into Dead by Daylight now and if they‚Äôre now using the actions differently and in this way, trying to act like an errant principal in the school-yard stating ‚Äúnoooo that‚Äôs not the way the game should be played‚Äù is only going to yield negative results. People don‚Äôt like to be talked down to if they choose to throw a spanner in the works and change gameplay and trying to point fingers and state ‚Äúyou‚Äôre wrong‚Äù over something like this is rather arrogant.
---
I‚Äôm fine with however it‚Äôs going to be used in the future, I‚Äôm an open-minded and mature player like that. Having to explain it to people who just want to yell and downvote is pretty eye-roll inducing if I‚Äôm honest (not even specifying you, all you did was ask the question, but I do get bombarded just even discussing this in general and that‚Äôs not exactly the smartest way to discuss anything.)

You're the one who's bad at trolling. "Get your head out of your ass" lol what?
---
Still, how would insidious be any stronger than just cloaking and waiting in the same spot?
---
I meeaaaannnn.... survivors can't use the key for hatch until it spawns. Which is when the number of gens is more than the active players, unless it's the final survivor at which point you already won why does it matter if one got out?
---
So it's not really them avoiding gens at all.
---
Your quotes not in there kiddo.

Maybe yeah, could shke the meta up a little bit if noone is taking self care or nurse's calling. Oh well, fun brainstorming either way :)

It‚Äôs just a meme yet you guys are so sensitive about it. You not being able to take a joke about the meta is toxic as it is. But I‚Äôm done I don‚Äôt really care. I find these memes funny and whether you do or not doesn‚Äôt really affect me in the least. I don‚Äôt have time to respond to everyone butthurt about a simple meme. Just watching the backlash over these posts is worthy enough to post them and making me want to post another rn but I‚Äôm trying not too. The fact you don‚Äôt see how butthurt you guys get isn‚Äôt being toxic is hilarious in itself
---
Its a build i came up with so i dont blame you, normally i only run Franklins &amp; NOED in slot 1 &amp; 4
---
This is honestly the best view. Keys have variables people refuse to look at.
---
holycrap ilove this
---
It's not toxic, the survivor just doesn't like the fact that they're slugged and didn't bring a perk to counter a situation that they don't like for some reason.
---
Sure. If you want it to be worth it, then it‚Äôs worth it. It‚Äôs all personal preference. I for one am going to wait until they eventually start working on cross-platform progression.
---
The subreddit for killers is usually never used. I was just looking it so OP knew something like what he was mentioning already exists, but is pretty useless.
---
Feng low-key looks like Edna from Incredibles
---
Ok then! :)
---
Its not toxic its actually needed on many killers in order to get momentum going.
---
Points pretty quickly become irrelevant once you gain choice builds and addon sets. Prestiging is useless nowadays, so once you get perks you want KEEP THEM. Unless of course you want bloddy cosmetics, then go for it some of them look awesome. But the point is points aren't a good way to measure success. Pips, and general match feel are better markers.
---
The fact that you didn‚Äôt automatically choose BBQ shocks and appalls me. Always. Pick. BBQ. One of, if not *the*, best killer perks
---
Nobody Escapes The Vibe Check
---
It would of been better if you drew it invidible.
---
I definitely feel as though they really aren‚Äôt equivalent. Ebony Mori ends the game super quick, like it can easily reach end game in record time. It gives the Killer a huge advantage. Now that I‚Äôve got some Killers leveled, I‚Äôll hop on Killer and offer one up when I‚Äôve been playing Survivor and other Survivors annoyed me or something. I know it‚Äôs gonna be an easy game and I‚Äôll kill everybody. Don‚Äôt pretend you‚Äôre not using it for an easy game. 
---
The key on the other hand feels more like a safety net, I‚Äôm saying this as a solo player. You don‚Äôt have a huge advantage by having the key, but you can turn the game around if everything else went to shit. Relying on other Survivors can suck, so having that to fall back on is nice. You‚Äôre not guaranteed the hatch, you still have to find it. At the point where the hatch spawns, either the gens have all been repaired or enough survivors have already been sacrificed. So the game has already reached near the end anyways, versus the Mori bringing it about in half the time.
---
I really don‚Äôt get how anyone can say they‚Äôre equally as sucky for the other person. Okay, sorry you didn‚Äôt get a 4K because someone had a key? I definitely see Mori‚Äôs being used more often than keys anyways. I‚Äôve rarely seen it used in game by anyone other than myself. Maybe I don‚Äôt play in high enough ranks or invest myself enough in the meta, but it‚Äôs just odd to me that Killer mains act like victims. Killers usually feel like they have the upper hand to me, I don‚Äôt get complaining about a survivor having another chance to escape.
---
A check rooting its power on vibes. You are animated by the power of your Vibe Check when the Survivors are on the verge of escaping.
---
Once the Exit Gates are powered, if there is survivor remaining on the Map, this check is applied to it.
---
While this check is active, Survivors suffer from the Exposed Status Effect if they aren‚Äôt giving and your vibing  is increased by 2/3/4 %.
---
https://imgur.com/a/cSB8ah9 Here's the link to them! If you want to use them in-game you will have to resize them!
---
You are correct
---
It never happens when you want it to and happens when you don‚Äôt. Story of my life.
---
The hell is wrong with that guy?
---
There are ways to circumvent keys though. Unless you're completely oblivious to the survivor having it or how/when the hatch even spawns, you can completely plan around denying a key escape for multiple survivors. For an Ebony Mori or even an Ivory Mori, the gameplay doesn't have to change at all, a killer will get access to them through their normal gameplay loop to start using and it's on an individual survivor basis, unlike the opposite where survivors still have to all collectively be doing their job if they want several of them escaping through hatch on top of then looking for and each individually beating the killer to said hatch.
---
I'd immediately let the other survivor go after a play like that. Hecking bamboozled.
---
Guy had the Trapper Puppet on his hook. So while I was hooked I angled it so it looks like he's presenting the text.
---
They gather around the campfire.
---
The thing i don't understand about this argument on keys is the probabilities.
---
Note: This will be a long comment.
---
Keys are compared to that of an ebony mori, thus meaning that the key has to be of equal or greater power than the ability to kill every survivor after their first hook. So let's look at the requirements for both and how frequent each is in play starting off with the item of the topic.
---
Keys have a few requirements in order to use them to escape via hatch. 
---
1. The number of gens done has to be equal or greater than the number of players in the trial. Fairly simple.
---
2. Green keys can't open hatch while purple and pinkish can. Understandable.
---
3. A key has to be brought in or found during the trial. Alright.
---
Now let's run these through a standard scenario that people tend to use against keys which is all four survivors escaping via hatch cause of the key. Now lets look at what had to have happened for that to go down and what would've most likely happened if a key wasn't brought in.
---
All the gens had to be completed with no survivor deaths. Already a red flag that the killer wasn't doing all that well if not even a single person has been killed by this point. A key had to be brought in or found, if a key was brought the killer would know and could take action against it. If a key was found then that implies the Survivor either is running plunders to increase his chances or got lucky with an incredibly hard find given all the other options they could've gotten. The survivors then had to either coordinate via comms if they are swf or run around like headless chickens and slowly gather eachother so they could all escape via hatch which would if the latter would allow the killer to get someone with the time being wasted. Eventually if the survivors had found eachother and hatch and the killer still hasn't found THEM then they could all escape via hatch. This is a lot of "ifs" on a supposed common occurrence.
---
Now lets talk about that last part, how common is it? Well in both my time playing killer and survivor seeing a key is incredibly rare. Like you can go days without either. Normally when one is chosen its by a swf which should tell the killer the situation. Now I can't speak for pc but xbox I can say that all 4 of the survivors escaping via hatch is incredibly INCREDIBLY unlikely unless the killer is farming or has been doing poorly. 
---
Let's also run the same situation without the key. All the gens have been done, all the survivors are alive and there's no key. It's likely the killer would at best get two kills but that would also require a fair bit of throwing on the survivors part. Yea, it'd more than zero but if all four survivors are alive by the end, it's pretty fair to say you have lost that match. It's a key situation.
---
Now moris. Like keys they aren't uncommon per say, hell on some killers they're downright abundant. In this scenario a killer has brought an ebony, the most likely mori that would be brought.
---
The survivors see the hidden tile and can assume that the killer had brought a mori as shrouds would be rare and few. What can they do? Well they can play more stealthy to avoid a hook but most likely a hook will happen at some point in the trial unless the killer is doing poorly. Well now each survivor has been hooked. To be fair lets say this is by 3rd gen done which again is pretty poor amount of hooks. Now each survivor can be picked off. So one by one you down the survivors and proceed to kill them. Each time increasing your pressure as less survivors mean less progress in gens. So by two kills let's say a gen has been done. Those last two have to complete a gen or if one brought or found a key then find the hatch. So they choose the latter and begin running around the map, the killer who is also running around can easily spot one and down them, thus killing them. Now the hatch is open and whether or not you find it first is not really an issue as you already got the 3k and you'll most likely get the 4k but that's a 50/50 on who finds it first.
---
From this we see that moris are a definite while keys are situational. If anything, a key can be considered a pseudo counter to moris because if the hatch is closed it can be reopened if found. 
---
Every situation brought up about keys are either a situation where the killer has done poorly or the killer has stomped and is upset they couldn't get the 4k. Either one is heavily reliant on the killer because THAT is the power role. Memes aside, the killer is the person who decides how the game will most likely go. If they do well the game will end quickly and they'll get the 3k or 4k. If they do poorly they'll most likely get 1k or possibly 2k. No matter what the situation, you SHOULD be getting kills. With or without a key being in play.
---
I would like to hear any counter claims as I do want to understand why people are so against them. But so far I've heard only situational remarks about their op capabilities.
---
Ok but why does it actually look like he does in the game
---
Can do, is there any that you want me to do?
---
oh ok. thx
---
Your first argument was literally complaining that survivors are angry at you for playing dirty and they should just take it.
---
It's not even a good strategy as you get punished had you were facing against a SWF who's willing to block for their friend one after another. 
---
That means the only people you grieve are single players who have no decent means to defend themselves as they have no idea if their team will have BT or that the killer won't further tunnel them post DS. Let alone reliable person who'd body block. 
---
As I said, you are exploiting the weak who can barely defend themselves. The fact you have no remorse or hesitation to do this so you can win says a lot about you.
---
I usually have a good idea where the killer is coming from giving game sense. Ghostface hooked someone by the shack and Spine Chill turns on shortly? Well I have a pretty good idea where he's coming from.
---
Luckily I already got hag with the special edition on console

Pfffffft have you seen Springwood hook spawns? I got 2 behind the school and 1 in the parking lot.
---
Yeah, what this person said!
---
All good, happy to help :)
---
Maybe he didn t hit anyone yet? But he had the speed or something??
---
Yeah i get what you're saying about the shouting down, i honestly like to discuss things vs argue, clarity oveer agreement, but this is reddit so...
---
But my point too is that since new people are coming like you said, we should at least encourage the dance that makes the most logical sense, which to me is dancing when camped because it does vary.
---
New players that haven't been on reddit will just hang on the hook naturally, so i see it as the default action, whether or not there is camping, to not dance.
---
So unless pre-established i dont think they will even know that its a signal (either way) and likely just hang.
---
In a game moments ago, my friend was hooked and as the pig came back in stealth to camp, she began spamming to signal, "do not unhook, killer nearby". I watched as the dwight continued to ran at her and farm her. so survivors wont always be able to see if the killers there without risking more.
---
And with this thought, if a stealth killer per say, is camping and the hooked surv see this, the survivors wont waste time checking to focus on gens if shes signaling.
---
I dont see just hanging there at all as a valid signal unless the group of survivors knows, which is difficult with the lack of agreement. im not saying the concept is just Wrong, but i do see it as the illogical choice.
---
Nah you can see the trapper hitting someone at the very start of the clip and wiping the blood off his weapon.
---
I just saw that. Maybe They destroyed it or prevented it and saw he had it in end game chat. Idk
---
Das ist gut, ja?
---
1) it still doesn't give you as much rewards as if you were doing different things
---
2) So I should be given the biggest reward for letting them repair all gens and then killing them, because I let entity to savour their hope and then despair
---
3) The problem is that it doesn't reward you as much as you would be rewarded for good chases, despite you would win a lot of time in both cases
---
4) Winning for me is 4k only, no matter how I achieve this result. I don't care about ranks, despite me being in red ranks most of the season. If noed will help or will ensure my 4k, I will take it. Same for almost any killer or perk. I do not like using addons above green rarity, mories or spirit/nurse because playing with it is boring for me most of the time. 
---
"About pleasing the Entity" no, the game is about fun in the first place. Lore-wise yes, about Entity, but I don't think ANYBODY plays killer because of that. If the game is about hooking all survivors for 2 times and letting them escape, then I'm not playing killer anymore. But at the moment the game is about killing survivors, at least this is the most satisfying and enjoyable part of killer's gameplay for me.
---
Give the birb the scritches she deserves
---
When I say being cheated out of an escape is when you are winning pretty hard as killer and there are 2 survivors left and the person you caught DC's so the other can escape. Or the more likely scenario you have 3 people killed with 2 or 1 gens left and chasing the last guy only for them to stumble upon an escape. Atleast if they leave via exit gates they beat me. If they leave via hatch 9/10 I feel like I lost to rng. 
---
I guess i agree with what you say about moris but for me i feel like they should be mainly cosmetic and just a cool way to kill someone or everyone. Cause as they stand now I could be found first hooked, sandbagged then moried and my game is over in 2 minutes after waiting for a game for 15 minutes. 
---
I also agree the end game is pretty terrible rn. My suggestion was (though I know unlikely) to have it so when there is one survivor left the follow happens:
---
- The survivors aura is revealed
---
- A timer starts (1 minute?)
---
-Chase happens if the survivor outlasts the killer in this time either the exit gates open or they just outright escape whichever is more fair. 
---
That way you get another chase and its more or less on the player who wins and less on rng.
---
If she stole them, the pallets would slam her while leaving! Help pigyy!!
---
Cloked Wraith
---
I was complaining about survivors constantly bitching about perks, moris, and strategies. I never said they‚Äôre angry at me at all.
---
Good as
---
That doesn‚Äôt allow you to heal yourself, it‚Äôs still a good perk but not better than Self Care
---
short answer no
---
long hopeful answer? Devs are talking about a form of cross play, expect it in 20 years
---
Heil, mein Entity!
---
They are incorrect. Once you have obtained the perk at level 1 you will find tier 2 and 3, regardless of having the teachable or not. If you prestige, or play a different survivor however it wont show up until you get the teachable.
---
Hook Dancing.
---
If Hook Dancing means: Killer Camping
---
- If Killer is nearby / sees Dancing: Killer gains new information.
---
- If Killer is away: Killer gains no information
---
If Hook Dancing means: Killer Away
---
- If Killer is nearby / sees no Dancing: Killer gains no information
---
So your choices are:
---
1. Dance when Killer nearby: Killer gains info
---
2. Dance when Killer away: Killer gains no info
---
Why are y'all voting to give your opponent more information?
---
-----
---
&gt; But Desdomen! A camping killer is going to feel pressured if you start Hook Dancing and they realize the other survivors know they're camping...
---
No... No they won't. A camping killer isn't going to suddenly stop camping just because you're wiggling your butt off. They're gonna sit there and continue camping no matter what.
---
Your options are [Give the Killer information] or [Don't give the Killer information]
---
You have to become one with the C H O N K
---
Are you sure? I haven‚Äôt seen it so far, maybe I need to level up more.
---
It so much better than Self Care. If you want to heal yourself so badly bring a med-kit otherwise find another survivor or just do gens injured. Stop wasting so much time healing yourself.
---
Oh yes, that's a heavy nerf and unfair to BBQ especially when it first was at 200%
---
Blood webs are entirely RNG based, so yeah you just gotta keep trying. I was in the same situation as you, but with David. Found it, just took awhile.
---
I'd say Ghostface, Legion, Doc, and possibly trapper are having a great time. Rest not so much
---
No sloppy or No mither? 100% bonus bp in the survivor category? idk about you man, but that seems too op really.
---
I like your style friend.
---
Yet with iron will you are still one hit, with self care you don‚Äôt need to rely on someone else and you can heal yourself. As I stated before, medkits only heal you for a limited amount of times while you can heal yourself forever with self care
---
Uninstalled. Too frightening.
---
Micheal, clown , hillbilly is a maybe. Demogorgon is a maybe Leatherface is probably just hungry. I'd say the rest after that is just there.
---
Just be aware of your surroundings and the direction the killer is most likely to come from, it's not that hard to break Los from the gen either.
---
Ok ty
---
Shut up noob its used this way since 2016 now go back to your ps4
---
I don‚Äôt really use her but do you have good gen showing perks? Also if your really strugling I suggest trying to find 3 gens close by each other to try to defend so by late game they will have a tough time finishing them. Pop goes the weasel may be nice for that strat so if you down someone you can just hook them then find the gen most done and wreck it. But maybe check out some YouTube vids of people who play her and try to mimic their playstyle
---
Just in time for tomorrow
---
That was a hell of a read. Time to kill myself
---
Laurie best survivor.
---
Self Care loses more games than just letting others heal you or just doing gens injured. Self Care is my favorite perk I like seeing when I play killer because it means my chances of winning are drastically better.
---
If you're on xbox, I have a group of people who help one another practice. With looping, objectives, and killing if need be!
---
Ugh this makes me nostalgic for talking about Dead By Daylight with my roommate. This makes me happy. We moved away from each other like 8 months ago. Miss em.
---
if they gon' make them free, can we at least earn them (except for the people that already have them??)
---
I know how to be aware of my surroundings but given the scenario I sill just like premonition more especially on maps like the game. All in all I don't run any of them anyways
---
But then we get Amanda's cute stun noises, I see this as an absolute win.
---
You are bitching about them not liking your scumbag playstyle aka tunnelling. Whether they are angry or not is irrelevant. They complained because they feel you have played unfairly and that's a valid complaint if you tunnel them.
---
Meanwhile, you complain that they complain. Why should they just take your BS while you can continue your scumbag playstyle and still bitching about them anyway?
---
Clown isn‚Äôt T H I C C enough
---
Quality shitpost
---
Of course. How foolish of me of ever thinking she wont get away.
---
Yeah YouTube would probably be a good start. I'm like super new to dbd so I actually have 0 teachable perks. My only slowdown perk on her is the one where gens are frozen for 120 seconds at the beginning of the game.
---
Sometimes no one else can heal you, and once the killer spots you, you are one hit instead of healing yourself earlier and actually having a better chance.
---
You face camped my game. Not much of a meme build. Just lame and boring to play against after waiting for a game.
---
I did this two hours ago for my challenge to heal 10 survivor health states. Needless to say, I got 9 out of 10 in a single game. (Could have done all 10, but the killer pushed us out into the fog).
---
Very handsome indeed
---
The more hatemail they send, the smaller their penis becomes
---
Shit, I should've used invisible ink
---
Personally I‚Äôd like to keep tremors, it‚Äôs helped me in a lot of situations and it fits my play style, but I can see why I should take it out, I‚Äôll definitely experiment with getting other perks instead of it in the future!
---
Legion "Cosplays" in a nutshell.
---
9 hours 20 minutes
---
Drawn by Shadman
---
She‚Äôs one of my favorite killers, definitely worth. Most fun in my opinion.
---
That‚Äôs actually pretty good
---
I like tremors too, it‚Äôs a really good tracking perk but bbq is just better overall plus them blood points. But that‚Äôs imo
---
The lashesssss lmfaooo üò≠
---
You can thank r/forhonor for that..
---
Tremors is amazing for Freddy actually, it helps his teleportation if anyone he‚Äôs the one it‚Äôs made for lol.
---
Google my man? :D
---
It increases you movement speed by 7% in the vicinity of the killer when he is carrying another survivor, and it grants the survivor an additional 20% faster wiggle speed (stackable i think lol)
---
So it is perfect for blocking hooks and if you get hit i counts towards mettle of man
---
This together with the general fix of protection hits it will now be easier to trigger mettle of man overall and might introduce some sort of a "tank" playstyle
---
Definition of Strategy: a plan of action or policy designed to achieve a major or overall aim. The aim of the killer (goal of the killer) is to kill the survivors. It says nothing about ‚Äúdefeating your opponent fair and square‚Äù. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs fair or not? It‚Äôs a strategy as long as it‚Äôs a way to kill survivors. Doesn‚Äôt have to be fair to be a strategy.
---
It said they had noed
---
That cosmetic is one of the best in the game IMO, nicely done OP!
---
Replace NOED with Surveillance. Being able to know if a gen you just left is being worked on is invaluable, and you're playing an insta down Killer already. Don't rely on NOED.

In my experience, repeated little attempts that don‚Äôt go all the way up = camping killer and going all the way up but not actually attempting = no one is coming for me, someone better come right now
---
Your overall aim wouldn't work if you strategy involves cheap method. If you build a house using cheap method you get punished for it.
---
Here you want to win using the dirtiest tactic you can use. Don't expect survivors to like it and not flame you for your play style.
---
Fav survivor skins: Jane-Red and white striped shirt with the jeans or the blue dress with thigh high boots. Steve-Scoops Ahoy.
---
Fav Killer skin: Hospital Gown Myers
---
thank you so much!
---
Was looking for this for a long time. Thank you
---
Nah, definitely intentional. Just the devs having a bit of fun.
---
I think the best change to red mori is that it works like devour , after certain x hooks you can kill everyone . It‚Äôll be like getting hooks rather than just tunnel the guy to Change the game drastically plus they should give more bp if my change is done
---
My genuine advice is to use her perk Infectious Fright with Whispers (Only at rank 3 mind you) if you constantly find yourself having a hard time against survivors who cleanse. Infectious Fright will tell you if anyone is in your terror radius by making them scream, you just have to do a quick spin around to check. Whispers will light up when a survivor is within a certain distance of you, letting you waste less time on scouting for survivor.
---
I'll let you know now that gens do get done fast in DbD but you can lessen the effect this has by spreading your pressure and ending chases quickly and nothing does that better than experience. It may also help you to watch good killers and while I may not know of any who play plague, Otzdarva is an educational killer who streams on twitch and uploads to youtube and can most certainly help you improve. Also, while I'm no expert if you ever want to send me some footage of you playing for more in-depth help I can try and point out things that you may want to improve on or tricks to learn.

Happy cake day and same

Blame the devs on that not the killer m8 , if the killer wants a 4K it‚Äôs fine for what they have to do . It‚Äôs bad game design
---
Oh wow I didn‚Äôt even realize my cake day! Thanks!
---
Yes but by default they will not know that hanging and not dancing means to do gens is a big point too, hanging is what new players will likely do. Spamming dance is not normal and thus can interpret as something is wrong.
---
Its all meaningless unless we universal agree but that's impossible, i agree.

This is the real definition of cursed

The Oni is coming out? Well swell, it‚Äôs 2019 and I‚Äôm glad he feels safe to come out if he wishes to :)

Could overcharge + ruin work? Might replace NOED with overcharge
---
You can call it whatever you want.
---
Doesn't stop it from being scummy. Doesn't stop the victim from retaliating in return.
---
Let me put it in simple term your brain cell can understand: you don't win an argument easy by punching someone in the face. Sure, they will shut up for few seconds. But then they will clobber you in return.
---
You do unpleasant thing to something, you better get ready to accept the consequences.
---
Whenever I get a nasty message on PS4 I always just reply with ‚ÄúSorry about your small penis.‚Äù or ‚Äú#StreamYouNeedToCalmDownOnSpotify‚Äù They usually stop after that. I become friends with one lol
---
yes
---
The leather outfit for pig is my honestly my favorite outfit in the game after Susie
---
The bitch kept struggling for the minor wiggle bloodpoints most likely
---
I‚Äôd take out node for nurses calling or Thani but I just thing nurses calling is fun and strong too
---
 If someone was following the killer around for a flashlight save, it means that he was not doing gens which when coupled with the fact that player is most likely SWF and telling his friends via voice the constant play by play of what the killer is doing.  If you actually tried to chase the killer and do a flashlight save, your team would know all this. But sadly, playing as a SWF  devoids people of all this information.  
---
Using a Mori takes that fucker out of the game so he can find something else to talk to his friends on comms about.
---
See How I rewrote what you said in the killer's favor easily?
---
Just saying just because people don‚Äôt like the strategy you use, doesn‚Äôt make it even less of a strategy.
---
It‚Äôs surprisingly chill. Really takes the edge off and makes it less frustrating. Obviously it hampers your abilities and makes you die more, but you don‚Äôt care as much about dying
---
*distant piano*
---
That‚Äôs true. Nurse‚Äôs calling is the best perk on ghostface since you can people healing and they won‚Äôt know you‚Äôre there if you are in night shroud
---
That doesn‚Äôt even sound worth it in the slightest to be honest.
---
But it is less of a strategy if you suffer the wrath of those you victimised.
---
If you can take the anger by all means. But obviously you can't. That's why you're bitching now about survivors bitching that you use scummy tactics.
---
Don't expect it to end as long as you employ those tactics.
---
its 2 unbalanced and boring, like the killer can literally just spam Q and win.
---
No problem. They do say that with time comes knowledge, I'm just glad to help where I can. I think everyone can do well as killer with some practice, sometimes it just takes a helping hand to know where to start improving or simple things that may help. I hope to see you getting 4ks in the near future!
---
Eh, don‚Äôt knock it till you try it. But it‚Äôs not for everyone. I only do it occasionally when matches get frustrating. Besides, you asked, I gave an answer, no need for the downvote haha

Lmao what are survivors gonna do? ‚ÄúSuffer the wrath of those you victimized‚Äù bruh

Bruh, on PC they can jot down your name and block you. Or worse, doxx you.  On consoles, they'd complained at you, you know, the very thing you are annoyed about.
---
I find it amusing that you don't even realise what cause you your problem. And it's all preventable on your side just by playing clean game.
---
I seriously think they should rework the bloodweb, teachables and the shrine. I have a couple of friends who stopped playing and won't come back simply because the grind is too much, not because they don't like the game.

SrPelo :kappa:

a lot of killers act like pricks and close the hatch right in front of them a lot of times cant say I really blame them

---

---
And Most of them already play DBD xc
---
Yeah well, it's never going to work.
---
You want the game more fun? Stop making their game unfun by tunnelling.
---
But I don't think you are capable of that. So enjoy more whining from them.
---
Know that Your unhappiness is entirely a by product of your action.
---
I was trying to figure out what butch female there was in the game till I saw this comment
---
Daym gg ez baby killers
---
Yes and no, with how fast gens go, if the killer doesn't tunnel you then you can hop on a gen and the game will be over before he gets back to you anyways unless your team are potatoes which does happen. Additionally it's not that hard to loop while injured especially if you have dead hard which in some cases makes it better to stay injured (after all why heal against Billy when you have dead hard? You can dead hard an insta-down while full health.
---
If we assume that you are right and self-care puts you in a better position, you are still screwing your team over as self-caring takes significantly longer than the time another survivor wastes healing you is or by just bringing a medkit.
---
It's a shame really. A lot of players don't feel playing after someone leaves or loses connection. But hey, might as well.
---
It‚Äôs never going to work because they constantly bitch about every single small advantage. As long as tunneling is still an effective strategy then everyone will still do it, no matter salty survivor‚Äôs feelings.
---
Whenever I see farming Killer: "Do you come from a land down under?"
---
My friend group calls him Neigh Neigh.

---
I'm only aware he plays Fortnite and nothing else... although how did he react on DbD? Did he liked it? Or just meh?
---
And you think it should still count as a escape? So you also think when survivors disconnect it should count as a sacrifice?
---
Honestly don‚Äôt even know. Thought I was playing a bit of hide and seek with him behind those trees (the last place I saw him). Then he disappeared, and I panicked. Then he vanished in front of my eyes. And finally, I was dead. 
---
Seriously wonder what he was seeing on his screen.
---
I'd suggest against this change, overcharge doesn't do much as it isn't that hard to hit and also encourages unhealthy generator kicking.
---
You‚Äôre only talking about facing against billy and using dead hard in that situation. But any killer can insta down you with no self care. Just run both perks and that‚Äôs it.
---
You are what you eat
---
Nope. You are responsible for your own action.
---
It always intrigue me whenever I encounter people with high degree of sociopathy and inabiliity of self refection.
---
I'd ask that you see yourself in their position but I don't think you are capable of that.
---
Don't expect others to be nice to you when you can't even be nice to them.
---
I just feel guilty, so I decide to farm. Might as well get something out of it
---
Counters Noed speed and most importantly it's a very strong tool to easily loop for a few until out. Can also counter bloodlust Tier I.
---
Also, I remember how badly you could abuse when endgame collapse was not even present.
---
That pig is looking so cute! I need to boop her snoot now
---
A good conection... ok thanks :)
---
Gotta look tough online to cover up those self esteem issues.
---
This is a test
---
Make sure you get yourself ruin on plague the first thing you do at the start of a game is find every survivor and make them sick. Dont waste time chaseing them at the start. Once you got everyone or at least 2 persons infected start to down them. The great thing about plague is the survivors ether dont cleanse and its like you have noed all the time or they decide to cleanse and make you a better type of huntress.
---
I mean, I see why this would be nice but with buying the two (or more) characters from the dlc it isn't quite the same. In a way you could also consider buying the dlc as to buying the alternative outfit choices that come with it rather than just the characters.
---
How do you not understand that dbd is a game and doesn‚Äôt reflect on real life. Just because I play a certain way in a game doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm a sociopath. The game is literally about killing others, why would I take other peoples feelings into consideration when I‚Äôm literally trying to kill them? Doesn‚Äôt make sense.
---
Looks like this one is... One for the Ladies~
---
Tunneling is just a scummy tactic used by killers who aren't good at the game. You go for the person just pulled off the hook because you're afraid the two hit survivor may actually evade you. But keep telling yourself what a genius tactic you have.
---
Technician or brand new part
---
You Guys are trash at making a game
---
Steve looks like hes saying "Hey demogordon, Hook me, if you want to hear me sing"
---
Uhhhhh, I play survivor and am okay with however the killer plays the game. I get more upset at survivors disconnecting than anything, but at the end of the day I can remember it‚Äôs just a game. 
---
I know there are absolutely toxic players on both sides who DO like to cause people misery, but this is an asymmetrical game that favors the killer and just because you like to go after the easy target? Suddenly you‚Äôre on the same level as Jeffery Dahmer or Hitler or something? I highly doubt it. 
---
I love the game in it‚Äôs entirety. I have several clips saved of me getting mori‚Äôd that I send to the killer after the match because it was awesome as hell. I dunno, I just think people should enjoy it because it is just a game at the end of the day. I don‚Äôt think we should psychoanalyze people based off of a video game play style (because if that was the case, I could do the same thing to you with the way you deal with conflict). Some people sure, but you just have to remember those people are more insecure than you. Also, the block feature is a godsend when dealing with toxic people.
---
Wtf
---
This challenge was available for quite some time now. Pallet objective that shares it's name with a new perk. Like that guy said, maybe a very thin coincidence, but I feel like somebody knew what they were doing here.
---
Lmfao I honestly was dying while making this
---
slugging for the hatch makes sense if u ended the game too quick or had dcs and know ur behind on points. As to extending the game what if ur slugging people who are dead on hook only so u can hook everyone 2 times, then kill everyone dead on hook, or just to simply spare said person? Are those acceptable to u.
---
BEEG Yoshi
---
I started playing DBD on the switch, it's pretty fun. I started playing The Trapper so I wanted to try him out on ps4. It's fun to play as him when you actually get people trapped in your traps.
---
Unpopular opinion but just kill me unless the hatch is right there. I just want to be in my next game
---
I don't think they really had a choice at that point.
---
My apologies just continue sucking ass at the game then lol
---
I mean competent survivors are gonna work through gens with no slow down perks. Really the game starts when you start hooking people
---
Found the salty killer main.
---
is this ironic?
---
Well thats fine, but i really have never ran into someone doing that, thats the best possible way, but most of the time i just get slugged by a GF for him to just bm me

---
Hell yeah man.
---
Like I said you use yourself as barometer of what's okay and not okay instead of looking around and see what others say and try to put yourself in their shoes.
---
I don't think you don't understand what sociopathy is. Yes, high level sociopath are more likely to be psychopath but they are not the same thing.
---
Sociopathy is one inability to sympathise with other people's feelings or consider their feelings but then they wonder why people don't like them. Many people in society are highly functioning sociopaths who are good at their job but awful at personal relationship. Especially when it doesn't benefit them.
---
You are annoyed that people complained about what you do to them. I suggested you don't tunnel them as that will reduce the amount of whining from them, which will lead to happier game for them and yourself. 
---
You refused it flat out but still insist on others on changing their behaviour while refusing to change yours. That is why it'll never work for you. You can't ask others to change when you refuse to change yourself.
---
I don't think giving the option to have a fifth perk to killers, while also making your hex (aka big OP perk) easier to defend and harder to cleanse, is a great idea for balance
---
This has as many conditions as the tomes
---
Fair enough
---
The new chapter come out tomorrow?
---
Guess am getting the switch
---
Inner strength but you enter your rock house
---
that's gonna (or require to) change how the customization menu works.
---
as for now each survivor have a 3 different part of cosmetic and each are on their own without any lock feature. if they want to implement this. they need to re-code or add a new function in the menu module
---
These are fricking ADORABLE!!
---
We are the Q&amp;A for DbD, didn't you know? :D
---
Check the shrine each week, you can use iridescent shards to buy perks you dont have!
---
"1 ft. guarantee"? does this guy know what "ft." means?
---
This pretty much sums up survivor mains.*
---
Oh wow thank you!
---
I did every killers portrait, they‚Äôre just not in the picture. If you mean why don‚Äôt I own them, I‚Äôm not a bubba fan lol. Might need to get Freddy for bloodwarden soon!
---
Trump firmly believing Spirit has counterplay even though literally every single other major DBD streamer proving otherwise just shows how right you are. The dude is stubborn as fuck and believes what he wants to believe, despite his self-proclamed open mind.
---
Challenging but you'll have an easier time by taping a small piece of paper to the screen where a cursor would be, to show where your axes will roughly go.
---
It takes longer to get the perks but at least you get to save money so that‚Äôs the positive.
---
You can just play the game and level up your account level to earn shards. Then buy the killer that way for free. Or use those shards to unlock the specific perk in the shrine if it pops up. The licensed killer can only be bought for auric cells though I‚Äôm pretty sure so if the perk you want is on a licensed killer the only way is to wait until it‚Äôs in the shrine and by it wit shards.
---
I wasnt even toxic tho xd
---
Its 5Head words
---
Didn't he just claim ghostface and wraith were top tier killers? I like wraith an all and hes underrated but without addons he struggles after the first hit, he just has no map pressure at all. If survivors actually wise up and pay attention hes just an m1 killer with no power
---
Ahhh damn and no one needs to be a bubba fan he‚Äôs just special to me. 
---
Short Story is that he‚Äôs the main slasher that for me into horror movies/Slashers so I have a big love for Leatherface.
---
Will the Christmas winter event also happen today with the new chapter update?
---
DIO
---
I‚Äôll defeat you with my star platinum ORA ORA
---
Imagine a full team of self care. Why cant I go up against these survivors?
---
Lol
---
It won't, he doesn't own the rights to his likeness, it would be like if you messaged BHVR and gave permission
---
Then I would like to hear your explanation why NOED is unhealthy for the game, out of curiousity because I can't really get behind that thinking
---
The best killer in the game is still the best killer in the game no matter what build you use lol. She ignores everything survivors have and is limited only by the user's skill.
---
Ah I see, he‚Äôs certainly a classic. A lot of my friends who play DBD also say they‚Äôre not scared of most killers but are always scared of him for some reason lol
---
Ywah. I was trying to get some heals and safes
---
Its 2000 for most perks, 2700 if its the first time that perk has been on the shrine
---
If you're not on console, you could also buy any non licensed killer with shards, meaning its generally best to buy liscensed killer perks from the shrine but, unless you really need a perk, waiting on doing so for non-liscensed killer perks
---
Also the shrine changes later today I think, you. may want to check it soon
---
Facecamping since there was 2 gens left
---
I think a lot of people would say Meg as her perks are very solid and beginner friendly
---
ghostface stalk is useless at high ranks. change my mind
---
I didn‚Äôt know that‚Äôs how he played it, but thanks for the attack
---
There is the charity case or other dlcs that has stuff like that.
---
its almost like reddit isnt a single person and different people will find out about a meme over an extended period of time which means a meme that's old to you is still fresh to someone else
---
Don‚Äôt care, didn‚Äôt ask
---
Plus you‚Äôre a drawer
---
The new way tru has played ghostface and wraith is good and all until a survivor has spine chill and sees you coming a mile away never giving you that sneaky first hit. If killers start to play a stealth play style more than a chaser play style spine chill will be in every build in place of perks like borrowed time because it would never proc if killers are stealthed anyways.
---
i got a game like this w a bunch of new players one time when i brought a tuft + tombstone, unfortunate for them lmao
---
So u can‚Äôt even kill a survivor with billy. Lmao pretty sure u also run ruin.. that‚Äôs so sad dude your real problem is relying on sweaty builds instead of improving your skill. If u really earned red ranks u could kill survivors with a no perk billy easily..
---
Report him to the support just to be sure!
---
Basically he‚Äôs come to the conclusion of this: Spirit, Nurse, GhostFace/Wraith.
---
- Spirit has counterplay and anyone who actually has brain cells will know that this isn‚Äôt true.
---
- Ghost Face and Wraith are tied because he uses strong builds on them, when the build is viable and not the killer itself. It‚Äôs like saying Hag is top tier because of Make Your Choice and Mint Rag. 
---
A lot of people know this is bullshit and are explaining why, but others are just straight up attacking the guy. So while attacking him is inexcusable, his opinions are very out there, and his evidence for these opinions doesn‚Äôt make too much sense.
---
Why is it important to say OC
---
Tte damned thing of it is I've been buying every perk in the game to find a viable build with him but can't and I think that's the biggest kick in the pants to people who want to learn him. I  think because the most of what he's supposed to do, he can't necessarily do well is a big knock back to his playing numbers. His beginning perks aren't good by any means which nails him even further back and against a competent survivor group he can't seem to keep up with his shred only ever being good for mind games and not continuous hits which sort of sucks. Demo is by far my favorite killer on here because of his design, his chase music, and his animations but I don't think there is a complete build for him that allows him to cover all bases. He always seems to be missing something and his teleports take too much time to set up in an adequate fashion that won't have them cleansed within about 20 seconds. This further adds to the question of how he's supposed to be a map control killer if that map control doesn't last for more than thirty seconds. It's like they tried to implement an idea with him but the devs just didn't finish him up in a timely fashion.
---
At least he bothers to actually prove (or try to) why he believes he is right. Instead of just saying "no u wrong"
---
I got rep for not being shit.
---
They played like shit and 3 of them tried to unhook next to me. I downed all of them (billy...), and the last guy that got unhooked tried to hide next to me without iron will......
---
Apparently I have wall hacks.
---
1) wiggling gives points, if you didnt know that.
---
2) breaking free gives points.
---
3) so many killers out there will carry you to the hatch just to hook you next to it because this game is full of toxic asshats.
---
4) if you want to let them escape, them breaking free doesnt hurt that, in fact survivors run faster than a killer carrying anyway.
---
I don't know if it like hurts your ego when they escape or something, but if you actually intended to let them go it shouldn't matter how they did.
---
If you like it, go for it. My reasons for buying a cosmetic are A) I enjoy how it looks, B) I want to support the devs, or C) both. Really just depends on whether it‚Äôs worth it to you üòÑ
---
If you can't see keys in the lobby you really need to get a pair of glasses dude
---
Its still a Cosplay. Simple or not.
---
A fellow P3 Kate, I tip my hat to thee
---
I love this explanation, cause I too don't need to get a 4k or a 2 pip to have fun, hell I've been in purple ranks for a while (although I've been to 1 consistently before so I call myself a red rank) I prefer having fun over sweating and tend to give the last person hatch. But yeah I guess keys only really make me mad when I've had a string of bad games, and at that time I tend to do the *reasonable* thing and do something else. Ty for not taking my question as an offense, which happens commonly on this sub.
---
Fungoose makes great use of it at rank 1.
---
Imagine having to go against someone with ruin, pop, survilence, and corrupt intervention and then they still have another perk slot
---
Fellow Vommy Mommy i see
---
I‚Äôm not sure a winter event has been announced officially. I‚Äôm guessing it will come but probably near the end of the month closer to the solstice.
---
well it's not completly useless. just way better to go for sneaky hits
---
On console, dont know what that means for me tho
---
Link to original video or gay
---
Level up hag if you haven't already, you need ruin.
---
Repost
---
Ahahahah happens so much, i get called trash all the time and get reported sometimes for using perks they dont like. And i love especially when im hooking someone and they unhook right in front of me. Usually i down both but slug the one rescued so that he can still play a bit more, cause of that i get called camper xD 
---
I think the litle kids from COD are starting to play dbd
---
*He stalking there*
---
Yeah but mate you got to remember Fungoose has 8000 hours I believe now in the game and he uses math and always know when to go for hits. 
---
He‚Äôs like a fucking robot lol. 
---
But regular players aren‚Äôt on the same level as goose.
---
Then it just comes down to this magical thing called ‚Äúopinions‚Äù. Just because you show your ‚Äúfacts‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean you are obligated to change your views. I have barely watched this guy, but I still think it‚Äôs annoying how shit on he gets.
---
trust is good not trust is better! Last killer i played against, carried me trough the entire map just to close the hatch and mori me.

Fucking hell I feel bad for all u peeps getting betrayed
---
i wish my brain worked the way his does, its crazy to listen to him! he predicts everything
---
We need this built in-game. Looks so clean.
---
Lol yeah the guys a fucking computer and brilliant lol. I love his little rapgod moments.
---
I like the idea of someone claiming this isn‚Äôt yours as if it was a masterpiece of artwork. Take my updoot though
---
No reason to. The devs really need to give an incentive. Double BP or something when that perk is run.
---
Ew
---
the pig is super cute! great work
---
A lot of killers will only grant mercy to those that concede. The ones who still have fight left in them get an honorable death, the ones who concede get a mercy at the cost of their pride, or at leas that‚Äôs the idea
---
Sure, keys need to be looked at, but considering the survivors have already lost instaheals, BNPs and now Balanced Landing, maybe, just maybe, Moris need to be on the chopping board before Keys do.
---
Imagine being salty at a Halloween costume.
---
You should only care if you want the bloody clothes or you are a completionist, otherwise there is no reason.
---
The only benefit you'll really get is a cosmetic for each prestige. 
---
I'd say for most it's not really worthwhile doing it unless you are really into the cosmetics
---
It's like .5% increase per prestige, if you like the bloody cosmetic and will use it then do it, otherwise the change is minimal and you have to reearn everything.
---
Are there also some for survivors? Looks sick dude.
---
How much do you play the game? (this is the only question that truly needs to be answered)
---
Do you want to prestige all the killers they may have your bloodweb filled with perks you don‚Äôt need? 
---
Do you care about the cosmetics? 
---
If you play it a lot then leveling won‚Äôt be bad but if you don‚Äôt spend a long time playing the game it may be in your best interest to just not prestige other characters.
---
So because I have spoiled sight I have to lose? Thanks man, I guess I'll join colorblind camp and will give up on this game until there are more opportunities for people like me to actually enjoy the game and not struggle  through it..
---
Have you ever heard about something called copyrights?
---
Congrats man. I got legion two days ago and played three games of him, he's tough to do well with - especially without thana and sloppy lol
---
I don't run noed when I play killer for one big reason. Against dumb survivors, they die before end game anyways. Against smart players, they do bones before end game.
---
Do bones as a survivor, try for 2 or 3 a game. Most of the time you'll find them just walking from gen to gen.
---
What do you mean? This tweet is literally from Kyle Gallner who [played](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_(2010_film\)#Cast) Quentin in the remake.
---
Yeah after tony stark. But he can be called whatever. Now there should be a tony the tiger killer though ;)
---
I struggled trying to convince a baby Jake to let me take them to the hatch yesterday. I carried him away from the basement, literally any hooks and he just didnt get it. Poor thing.
---
Until the game messes up and you load in with your dailies gone. 
---
(Just shit talkin, it‚Äôs happened to me and another person recently lol)
---
It's almost like it was the only exhaustion perk with a really good passive effect and totally warranted a nerf.
---
5 blink nurse survivor
---
It‚Äôs impossible to tell an honorable Killer from a troll. I‚Äôve been carried to hatch a few times just to have Killer veer to the side and throw me on a hook.
---
b-but... n-no ruin!!!1! /s

That‚Äôs the risk you run if you concede defeat. Some will take pity, others will stomp you further into the dirt. Such is the nature of multiplayer gaming
---
I wonder who your main is hmmmmü§î
---
Peace god ‚úä
---
Oof that is a total bummer, I'd file a complaint and be like "I want to speak to the manager!"
---
if you play a lot you might as well prestige because eventually you'll have many bloodpoints that you can't really spend on anything that's worth it. I have all killers P3 with all perks and now I'm P3'ing my survivors because I have to find a way to spend bloodpoints once I hit the cap which is 1 million.
---
Yes, he does not own the rights to the likeness of Quentin (the character)
---
Damn bruh if you can send me a DL link I‚Äôd get that in a heartbeat.  I could photoshop them myself but I‚Äôm too lazy :P
---
You got whispers tier 3. Whispers is good on pretty much anyone, but with ghostface being a stealth killer it could help tremendously.
---
This is too true... and now with the Archives letting you bank more BP, it is especially gratifying. I am so beyond ready to see my Scoops Steve lifting pallets back up.
---
dont be afraid to just use them and practice if youre gonna go down anyway.
---
I just think noed is just has no place in the current game. All it really does is slow killer players‚Äô growth because they don‚Äôt have to learn the killer they‚Äôre playing or general killer things to do decent-good. 
---
It always feels bad for the solo survivors because it‚Äôs not likely they‚Äôll have the time to go around to find and make sure all the totems are done.
---
Now with the egc if killers need help late game bhvr can just tweak the egc there‚Äôs no need for this perk anymore. So I think they should just rework it at some point along with ruin but that‚Äôs another topic
---
Got me there
---
I want to do the same thing with the survivor portraits, once I do that I'll probably share it on r/PerkByDaylight so people who want it can have it, I'll reply to this again once I've uploaded it :)
---
I deliberately skipped trash perks just because of this. Didn't unlock Third Seal on Hag, levelled Hillbilly only to 30 for Enduring etc...
---
It's still a huge fucking grind, but sadly good perks are scattered between so many killers,often 1 killer having 1 great perk that you really want and the rest of it is meh. 
---
I still need to level my killers to actually GET those teachables in their Bloodwebs, and it's going to be an even bigger grind than getting the teachables....
---
I honestly think we should have double BPs active all the time...with how many characters we have now in game it wouldn't even be broken. Or allow us to sell back all the useless crap offerings or addons we get when levelling...
---
Ye
---
But just imagine if Pig actually held a sword... I want a gladiator.
---
This was hard to watch lol. From you just running straight into the killer to bubba 360ing himself I just can‚Äôt.
---
Kate Denson
---
Yeah you're right. Spine chill isn't a bad call either for killers like him who rely on their surprise stealth attacks in the early game
---
My depression in it‚Äôs true form.
---
Schweet, cannae wait !!
---
7 hours and 7 minutes
---
Jeff?
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAH NICE!!!!!!
---
I started playing in summer 2016 and spamming "attempt escape" always meant the killer is camping so \*shrugs\*
---
I take it someone else saw what's going down in r/forhonor
---
He was BMing.
---
And it looks fuckin great
---
Awwwhh XD
---
Dayum, where's the info for this?
---
From my experience, both. I try to inform others in the pregame lobby to no avail. People either spam it when the killer is gone or don't do anything while the killer is camping them...
---
.
---
I legit use black wards to protect my chewed up pens
---
Well the game typically releases updates and cosmetics at that time
---
Thanks!  I seriously look forward to it
---
you in us or uk etc..?
---
Yui no &gt;:)
---
SD &gt; Chibi
---
Sorta upset that Dead By Daylight hasn‚Äôt gotten their own Funko Pop lineup yet
---
I require more teabags.
---
Good tip if you're going for future BP. My goal was to get all putrid serum asap, so I had to redeem for rift fragments right away.
---
As you get into higher ranks, there can be many opportunities where doing a gen is more important than wasting time healing, especially if you're running something like adrenaline.
---
I'm new to this game, but on Xbox One S...lol ...my god, it's so difficult playing with xbox remote...the bumpers are so hard to press whereas on ps4...it was so smooth...It feel like my right bumper is starting to break...a bunch of extra clicks I hear in there when I press it haha..
---
Did he camp and have noed, or are you just lying?

Pre workout give me strength
---
US but the timezone doesn't matter when it releases in 6hr 52 min
---
Discordance (preferably tier 1), bbq, whispers, and pop is my preference. Pop can be changed for really anything though, as billy boi is one of the few killers who don't really need slowdown perks.
---
Just prestige ur fave survivor maybe, I got Dwight p3-50 for the clothes n achievement, and also leatherface p3 cuz I feel like he probably won‚Äôt ever get other cosmetics
---
And sing the campfire song?
---
hey, I just bought the game yesterday and I wanted to know... who are the best survivors for beginners? I'm actually playing Meg and Nancy, but I heard Claudette is noob friendly. What would you say?
---
As somebody who has activated Mettle of Man multiple times thanks to inner strength and detective's hunch, I am glad this perk is useful again without tipping the scale unjustly.
---
i totally agree on the selling thing.
---
there needs to be a mechanic added to sell those useless offerings/addons

Patrick Star
---
Legit had a game the other day where I played as huntress - got a 2k and a single pip and the guy who died first was still messaging me like 3 games on about how I‚Äôm trash at hitting hatchets lol
---
How about uncapping the fps?
---
Claudette is due to her self care ability u can heal yourself and she has abilities to heal people faster Nurse and Wraith is non noob friendly Trapper will get u a lil more knowledge ur killer will become better over time and exp....PS DONT BE A CAMPER
---
There are Steam Achievements for this actually. They're called the "Adept" achievements.

I have my fps uncapped and antialiasing disabled, they wont bannyou for those either, but uncapping your fps will result in instability and some more glitchy weirdness. In a previous ptb the game was completely unplayable with wildly unpredictable movement and constant desyncs, but they did fix this, just keep in mind that they are not liable if you experience new problems.  I might be mistaken but I believe uncapping your fps causes a window in Yamoka estate to not function properly if fas vaulted.

I really like how Laurie is giving off killer vibes with that DS

There are no downsides to rank

Pip up? Go against better players and feel better

Nice work bruh, that Huntress is just too precious &lt;3

I'm just tired of that bullshit, stop being entitles pieces of shit which tell others how they should play.

You only need to unhook one now.

Pro tip, don‚Äôt even worry about walls, just look slightly upward

I hate having toxic teammates because I‚Äôm always scared the killer will take it out on whoever they manage to grab first (usually me) ü•∫

See I knew some person was going to comment and be like ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter, you just shouldn‚Äôt care‚Äù which, tbh, is not a solution to the problem. I understand what you‚Äôre saying, but I‚Äôm sick of that response, to be quite honest.

Too much work for a pretty pointless game mode that will just hike up Q times.

There‚Äôs certain times at the asylum, the swamp, and at Coldwind that I absolutely cannot get to the basement. I see the basement hook auras and I always walk the wrong direction and I can‚Äôt get down there in time. For instance at the asylum and the swamp I‚Äôll be inside one of the buildings and I‚Äôll walk the wrong way. Of course the entrance was probably behind me so I do a complete circle and then they wiggle off. At Coldwind when it‚Äôs inside the house I can‚Äôt find the entrance. Is there any other way to get down there aside from just learning the maps? It‚Äôs very frustrating when it happens that‚Äôs for sure.

But it is the Point of this mode to have no/nearly no CD

no you can wait for it to be in the shop

welp https://imgur.com/9Uxs1wK

But it can forever, since the game has over 150 perks in total
---
You forgot the observer! &gt;:(
---
I hunt after these like theres no tomorrow. I have 170 of these, but so far i'm getting lots of wallets
---
I don‚Äôt think there are any Quentin Mains

Pretty good, but why is he using a dildo as a weapon?
---
Thank you, that‚Äôs a really constructive answer. I appreciate it. 
---
I thought about posting this users thumbnail because I was angry enough to put them on blast, but when I simmered, I realized I didn‚Äôt want to be as terrible as him lol.
---
Why did i have to click the "i am over 18 button" to veiw that?
---
Lol yeah, same.
---
i found it funny, but the truth of the matter is, a gen that regress to 0%  when you pop it, it's a gen not worth kicking imo
---
No, when presented with evidence you don‚Äôt have to change your views, you can just stick your head in the sand like he does. I personally don‚Äôt believe saying (essentially) ‚Äúhey let‚Äôs discuss this and then show me your point of view‚Äù while then proceeding to act like you know better, even against a lot of valid information, is mature at all.
---
I tried to watch his stream a small handful of times, and to be honest I just couldn‚Äôt do it. He‚Äôs gotten the reputation he has (talking about people ‚Äúshitting‚Äù on him) because of his attitude/point of view on things and how he reacts when people present him with evidence that supports he‚Äôs wrong. If you like the dude, kudos to you then, but I personally just can‚Äôt support people like that.
---
He has three eyes though so his Nick name should be neigh neigh neigh.
---
MonkaEXTREME
---
you should make a twitter and follow dbd
---
i just think of it as "how much do i want those cosmetics?" because who knows what your bloodweb will look like after. you might not see any perks or add-ons you like for ages, especially as the more teachable you have, the more dilute the pool becomes.
---
to be fair though, during an event like this one is probably the best time to prestige if you're thinking about it, lots of points available in the rift and lots of players farming means it shouldn't take all that long to get back to a decent place
---
I think the biggest problem with NOED is it requires no skill or effort for a guaranteed kill. Adrenaline u had to either be hooked or escape injured. DS u need to be tunnelled and hit a skill check. Neither of these guarantee an escape either.
---
NOED = 1 guaranteed kill even if u were afk until the gens were done
---
No the point is that both sides are more boosted, so this would be just faster. Maybe it's better when they add 25% more movement speed for both sides in general, but it's better for the killer so he can protect gens better

I can do that! I made the files large enough to be printed on bigger things, but was a bit afraid to be going overboard with the options since the site has A LOT lol  
---
Either way I'm gonna enable a few for huntress now ;)
---
I love how yesterday David started flaslight clicking after disarmed my trap and right away stepped to the other one. (Insta DC). Or Claudette that dead harded into a tree and DCed. True play of the game.
---
So you impose your own rules onto others and call them scum when they don't play the way you want? Seems pretty scummy to me but what do I know ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

I actually thought of that a long time ago too. Bhvr buff calm spieir like this
---
OP refers to URF mode of LoL. And the whole point of this mode is to spam your abilities, since they have low or no CD.
---
This is just a buff in the wrong area. Solo-que survivors have a bad time because they think 'win' and 'escape' are the same thing (I don't, I'm solo-que, and I have tons of fun as survivor). Perma-semi-ruin won't do shit against good players since ruin at the moment only hurts peeps that can't do great skill checks (all it takes is practice. I have a shitty monitor and shitty frame rate, I only miss 1 or 2 ruins a gen, and I'm not that good at all.) An extra perk slot (freed by perma-semi-ruin) wont do a thing.
---
It's a nice concept, but this game has glaring issues that honestly might be unable to be reigned in. SWF is no longer the problem it once was: good survivors have enough practice that any m1 killer is fucked in lobby, and the skill gap between 'good' and 'bad' survivor is insane for a game that shouldn't really have one, since it's mostly just based on what tiles you know to run to and when to throw down pallets (pretty much instantly is good enough if your team is doing generators).
---
Doesn't look very consistent. I prefer the default ones.
---
Very spooky ! Would love to do a legion cosplay next halloween, simple as it is, its still looks dope!
---
On the other hand i pl√°n on buying ps4 pro in near time and dont want start all over. But, theres still hope because devs asked this question in survey.
---
Damnit...
---
ohh which ones? Ash and bubba judging by your flair?
---
Is camping toxic? Slugging is very similar!
---
No way, Legion's the one that's gonna be in my nightmares lmao
---
Why are people so toxic on killers clearly doing dailies or learning etc? Save it for assholes instead
---
Indeed, I'll make them when they are live tho!
---
Right? I struggle to think of games that rely on sound more than dbd.
---
I know, that one legitimately creeps me out lmao
---
Yo these are absolutely adorable, would you mind if I used some of these for my twitch emotes? I'd love to give credit where credit is due or whatever you got in mind, if need be üëÄ
---
Either that, or they should give us more secret offerings so they actually ARE secret.
---
Legion looks creepy.
---
Oh man, Plague was the hardest one. She has so much detail that's hard to simplify, I'm glad you appreciate that one lol
---
Funny story, I bought this game for a friend ages ago, we loaded into his first game and he got onto a gen, he asked "whats this heartbeat mean" before getting chased for 3 secs by a p3 trapper and IMMEDIATELY got moried.
---

Toxic killers and toxic survivors*
---
The thing is no one use it. It waste time and survivors can just run to the other side of the Map, almost every GF in high rank will stalk 1-2 players per match and thats it
---
*boop*
---
If you say toxic killer, you get downvotes. Do you not know this sub?
---
Brush has definitely been an inspiration! I hope I don't seem like a copy though, I'm trying to be my own :')
---
As trapper im many times in situations: cant go pick up trap because its too far away and do it mean lose.
---
Cant reset trap because doing that means i will lose. Survivor gets trapped and escapes on first attempt. But once i get one in basement and trap it right i can get 4K with only one gen left to be done. 
---
Id change trapper by having all His traps with him like Hag does. This would be enough. Or make the jaws bigger as it was before.
---
nice guide thank you

Erm the hatch is completely random you cant find it every time its not bullshit just because they happen to find it first.

What about the entity
---
Mmm fun to be randomly moried without me knowing they had a mori the thing is something like that would be too powerful to not tell people they are probably fucked unless they help their team mates.
---
I'll give u a example I played a game with my swf 2 noobies that I just mess around with body blocking stuff like that. But games where we know it is a mori I usually try to get the killers attention unless the 4th random is better at looping than me if the killer is smart and ignores me I take hits for my friends and rando just to deny the killer of the mori more.
---
My point is moris have a playstyle to deal with them while not the best it's not fun to play against moris
---
They already are ;)
---
Quentin in dbd looks like a little gremlin compared to the actual actor
---
Yes
---
Sorry, I thought it'd be no harm done to use an artwork someone else made as a display picture for a network that connects people with each other. It's not like they're uploading it to a social media platform and pretending it's their own work. But does that mean that all the people with, let's say for example, anime profile pictures, should've asked for permission of the artist too in that case? I know the way I write it down now makes me sound like a smartass but I'm genuinely asking.
---
Wow. You really are. Reddit strikes again. Why am I here?
---
Yes because if I complain about one thing that‚Äôs literally the only thing I dislike.
---
Oh my God I want somth somth like this 
---
How did you do that?
---
Yeah, that's the lore, but when people saw the teaser, many thought It was spirits dad
---
Love this!
---
I gotta agree with your tag
---
very much appreciated
---
I need wholesome challenges in archives, thank you for the the post.
---
I think you completely misread the post lol These perks would be remotely but the effects would be applied to all survivors and killers allowing them to pick other perks without compromising their ability to use perks they actually want. Every survivor would have borrowed time, A weakened spine chill, Unbroken and adrenaline without selecting them (becomes they would be removed) allowing them to pick perks they actually want while the killer would always have access to those perks allowing them to be more effective at keeping up a chase
---
Snowball gotta be a killer
---
Imo definitely swap noed for whispers. If you know how to use whispers it is an amazing perk.
---
Yea that's true but I like this too
---
How would 2 killers with ruins work?
---
well shit then XD
---
No. I just want to feel like my decisions matter in this game. If a nurse blinks at me I will know she's blinking and act accordingly. It gives me the sense that my decisions can matter and sometimes they do. With a spirit if she stands still then I  have to guess and pick an option at random. There's no skill involved and there's not even the illusion of choice. If the spirit fucks up then I won't feel skillful at all because I know that the spirit is just bad and my skill has nothing to do with it.
---
Yeah why does my nose always get itchy when I‚Äôm playing dbd and specifically doing generators
---
That makes more sense now my apologies friend
---
Here it is,  [https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/comments/e5foel/official\_art\_killer\_portraits/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/comments/e5foel/official_art_killer_portraits/) , download and info is in a comment I made on the post. No similar official art exists for the survivors unfortunately so no survivor portraits ;-;
---
which is why as a killer main I dont run it XD
---
Yeah there was no NOED up (he didn't have the exposed side effect and the Trapper hit someone earlier without it popping up) so OP could've just run out without issue.
---
Fnaf has a awful fandom, andawful recent games. And I hate the jump scares format the game has. But I have to admit, thematically it really is pretty damn cool. And the lore is not bad at all imho. I wouldn't mind it, but the devs said they don't want to do now human killers (I think the demogorgon was an exception)
---
Seems you forgot Freddy does really well without add-ons since everything he needs is in his base kit
---
The DbD cast has been looking more and more different as the days go by, from a Doctor, a Samurai, and a Lovecraftian creature. So adding a corpse in a robot suit wouldn't (and shouldn't) be a big deal since it spices up the cast, sure he's from Fnaf, but gatekeeping can only take you so far.
---
I love all of these so much? I want stickers!
---
4hours 33 min
---
I just wonder what the ability would be
---
No worries, The term "universal perks" sounds a lot like how they currently are in which any survivor can use any characters perks lol It's all I could really think of before my mind wandered off
---
Yeah man, time zone is a bitch
---
Damn nice work!

Perfect tru3! U say your opinion, someone disagrees and now u act like a lil kid. I even tell u  y rankin system is bs.. now u act like a kid, because u was so proud about your worthless rank!? Your kills and perks/addons show your skill not your rank.. grow up! if u can t handle opinions delete your reddit account or git gud idc
---
Face camping warrants an action that for some reason makes people irrationally angry. Why people act like teabagging ruins the game and makes it impossible to play, I have no idea, but face camping ruins games, teabagging doesn‚Äôt. If you escape fade camping you‚Äôre fine to show the killer they sucked by doing a few squats. Maybe you have a hard time because you face camp?
---
nice :D
---
Easy DC.
---
This exactly, I wish I had thought about that before going on a several hour long bender trying to find official survivor art that wasn't cosmetic related.
---
I watched on of his spirit games the other day on yt, and usually he does pretty good against them but you could see this spirit was on a whole different level and she shut him down every encounter and there was nothing he could do about it
---
yess
---
You know, while i'm unsure in changes being made to spirit, I can 100% see your point there. I gotta agree with you, the player agency is the biggest issue with her.
---
Must be the stress from all the daddy issues

Ahhh right, thanks for clearing that up. üòÅü§™
---
Put...put your dick in it.
---
'most likely'. Too much of watching streamers, eh? A minority of survivors play swf and even then only a minority of them use flashlights.
---
I believe this was the first one on this sub-reddit (some one correct me if I'm wrong please) https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e4yojb/quite_a_few_people_doing_this_on_rforhonor_and_i/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

---
Its like complaining about fucking Chainsaw XD

Y'know facecamp is not okay but Noed is just part of The fucking game XD

I Dont like taking noed but if its true that it makes survivors mad im gonna take it even on fucking Billy XD

Still

Nice jukes

Quentin is not ugly enought, 0/10
---
The other guy said it was 6. Make up your mind!!!
---
I honestly feel like the mixing in ranking was better, just because it gives a chance to new players who are trying to play a game that was recommended by their friends.
---
Last time I played wraith I sat in basement and felt depressed while a Nea was clicking her flashlight at me ;-; I've never felt such depression before
---
Its a possibility. A very unlikely one.

How tf did he get moried on his first chase
---
Why is it pointless? The game has no competitive mode, the only reward is having fun so how would a game mode about having fun be pointless?
---
That would be ideal but the fact they haven't for three years gives me doubts.
---
Pig buff is just her throwing the traps on top of survivors mid sprint
---
Yeah I'm a xbox controller player on my xbox and on pc...the right bumper and A button will wear down on your controller if you are really putting in the hours. I have gone through a couple controllers already...some pc masterrace type folks might give you a hard time about looping but looping is a lot harder with controller than with keyboard.  With controller, looping is more about deception, cleverness, really knowing how the killers operate and some luck.  Changing direction at the right time, using the corn and environment, urban evasion after a run and direction change etc etc.
---
At 180ish you'll have all perks at level 3
---
Reduces the recovery time for his power by 8 seconds, so from 30 seconds at base to 22 which is pretty significant. It stacks with the yellow and brown versions as well.

---
if you happen to get lucky with Yamaoka Estate ( or have the offering ), you can put traps in the bamboo bushes or whatever those are. the bushes are near hooks, but also gens which makes it really easy to catch people off guard.
---
These look amazing! I love the Jake, perfect look haha. Your art is always awesome to see around!
---
My only regret is I can't use them as character avatars because console player.
---
I thought a good idea is to make a bookstore. Everything is 10x more expensive, but you can buy what you want when you want
---
If you look closer, the Jaw comes from a piece of totem, the mask looks like it's made of wood or cardboard, it's full of pieces of glasses, the eyes are hold still by the wire and there's a piece of doll...
---
My theory is that it resembles the trapper by using things from all the killers, the totems from the hag, a piece of doll from one of the nurse's patients, the wire in the eyes as if it's the thing the Doctor has to stop his own eyes (if you look how it's placed), the pieces of glass inside the meat that reminds me of the Spirit and that Jacket that I can't really tell from where it comes from...
---
It‚Äôs all about having fun
---
Well someone give a screenshot of a civilized talk between him and someone else. Cause that seems too understanding and good to be true
---
Or not tying RBT timers to gen completions so that being gen rushed as Amanda doesn't basically end the game and so that endgame you still have a power.
---
wait, do they work together even without "stacks" in the description?
---
Moris didn't have the hook requirement at first.
---
he needs add-ons rework. Only couple are good
---
Imagine if that downed person also had adrenaline lol
---
Holy fucking shit this happened to me the other day. I've always had good Clauds on my teams, even if they're immersed, able to do gens fast and even occasionally flashlight save. But this one fucking gal kept blowing up gens and vanishing while she got the killer on me, we could have easily completed multiple gens had she hit any skill checks.
---
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
Yeah that works a lil better than mine
---
Those where dark times.
---
lol ok sorry
---
If i was using a space for skill checks, i would never ever post it anywhere üëÄ
---
They're not new, you unlock those by sacrificing the original 4 survivors 25 times each. So there's a Leatherface skin for Dwight, Claudette, Meg and Jake.
---
You have to hang a lot of (25?) of each of the 4 og survivors in the basement to unlock their face as a mask
---
Yea, I don't understand the logic of those other two.
---
*"I prefer to waste the last fifteen minutes of my time by DCing and getting zero BP.  That'll show the killer for slugging me!"*
---
You have to kill a specific survivor an few times. Don't know how often to unlock it.
---
Yea true...and I'm just gonna switch the RB to the RT  since it's not as fragile...maybe the left side too.
---
Leather face has four different faces, each of the original survivors, that he gets after doing some challenges afaik
---
Oh.. I had no idea lol thanks everyone
---
Thanks!
---
*Talks in a soft voice* Oh My God
---
This is why spine chill is a part of my base kit no matter what

Replace killer with survivor, then you're good. üòÜ

Sociopath, not Psychopath. No one ever mentioned beating up anyone other than you, btw. Besides, your reaction is quite telling. If you are raging like this in online environment, it's likely you do the same IRL. The difference? You can't get away being awful to others IRL so you have no choice but to moderate/hide your awfulness.

I'd disagree on the third seal being a trash perk, it's situational for certain, but it does have uses.  Honestly this applies to most of what I see people refer to as trash perks.  Doesn't have to be great 100 percent of the time to be good.

To be fair the Tomes are helping a lot with this, since you can get a ton of BP for the first two levels not including Daily or just match EXP. I know I've gotten a ton of characters leveled up faster in the past month than I usually did.
---
I still think that they should cut the BP cost of everything in the bloodweb by half when you're unprestiged and under level 41, though. That'd drastically help, and you'd still have to continually buy items at regular price to continue playing the character.
---
Keep it up amigo.  In a month you'll look back and cringe at how bad you were.  This isn't mockery - it means you're getting better.
---
I watch saved videos of myself sometimes to look back on what I did right or wrong, and it honestly helps.
---
Still frustrating that I'm not as good as some players, but it feels good when you start looping killers for one or two minutes.
---
Feels bad when you get downed, wondering why no gens were done though l.  Only to have your answer when you're hooked, and see all your teammates crouching nearby, eagerly awaiting their delicious farming points.
---
Probably higher rank killers like me are just waiting for Oni
---
Right now his chainsaw is almost unusable in a chase without pwyf making his red rank game play very difficult. He is basically and M1 killer with no power in most situations
---
Take out half the people in the game and it's most impossible to win. You aren't halfing its usefulness... Your barely reducing anything. Half the time when a killer has a Mori by the time 2 survs have been moried they will just slug the first until they got the fourth. Delete all moris except ebony and make ebony give you one kill, it will still be OP and deserve to be removed. Either that or make them nearly useless... That's what they did with instaheals, even the basic ones that weren't broken and should have been made pink...
---
Imagine sharing an oversaturated Halloween costume in December.
---
Gotta find the link to the q&amp;a where that was asked, but I believe bhvr said "no non-humanoid killers". As in, no spiders, sharks, or snakes as they stated the models would be difficult.
---
They don't want to do non-human killers in terms of needing a weird rig or animations, like a big wolf for example, that'd be a weirdly shaped killer and would need a LOT of very custom animations. Demogorgon was the exception because Stranger Things is hype af for a lot of people and also because it was licensed so they would have a better budget to work with.
---
No Mither, Adrenaline, Self Care, and Solidarity = braindead survivor build
---
Those aren't teachable perks, those are the characters of the game.
---
Level 50 on spirit huh.
---
Level up some free killers like Billy for Enduring. It‚Äôs a way better perk than NOED, and you can use it throughout the entire match. NOED is just not a very good perk imo
---
Entity: He‚Äôs to dangerous to be alive!
---
i'm levelling Ghostface at the moment and i will literally just bee line Pen, Address Book or Brown items. I'm getting really unlucky on perks but got BBQ3 so i'm drowning in bloodpoints at least
---
Dwight, 43 drives a Ford Flex
---
Not even a little bit is that what's happening, that's not how plant sex works. However, the existence of blossoming flowers would lead us to believe that Momma Entity is gettin' a lil *hot and bothered* in the prime fall season.
---
:O FINALLY!! This is the pack I need!
---
Honestly I hate people that spam the *attempt* button bc usually it means "I'm getting camped don't come" but now it means fuck all when it used to give good info
---
Glad I could enlighten you!
---
Lol why is this guy so confrontational. 
---
Okay boomer...
---
Absolute units
---
I'm mostly indifferent on the FNAF, tbh.
---
It's not that I don't want FNAF because "FNAF sucks! It's terrible, and I don't like it!", but rather if we're going to go into the realm of video game horror characters, there are so many other ones I'd rather have.
---
Just off the top of my head for Survivors, I can think of Jill Valentine/Leon Kennedy/those Biceps with a body, Isaac Clarke, Daniel from Amnesia, James Sutherland, and Miles Upshur.
---
Likewise for Killers, I'd rather have Wesker/Nemesis, The Regenerator, a Grunt from Amnesia, Pyramid Head, and Chris Walker.
---
I mean, don't get me wrong; Scott Cawthon seems like a cool dude and he's probably a ton easier to work with than most of the giant publishers, but FNAF is still extremely low on the totem pole. 
---
I'd definitely look forward to the perks Springtrap brought, and he'd **have** to be a stealth killer to bring the Jumpscares that the game is known for, but Springtrap isn't even on my radar of characters I'd ask for in this game.
---
Ghosty I told you to stop eating McDonald's
---
That one was easy, the 2 safe unhooks at egc was what was gatekeeping the rest of the survivor challenges
---
because it‚Äôs a douchebag move to say the killer had noed when in reality she was just trying to deny him the bp for the hit
---
Oh! I won't ask about the funeral, but everything's gonna be okay, just keep going üíïüíïüíïüíï
---
Handsome Squidward in the background.
---
Bro wtf? Talking like that to other people was never even a slightly decent thing to do. If it was for you, then you probably weren‚Äôt the best person, nor did you hang out with the nicest people.  If people are becoming more kind now, then I‚Äôm glad. This shit has never been okay. People like you just always got away with it, and believe me, everyone‚Äôs relieved that you can‚Äôt anymore.
---
Should I buy ghistface instead of bubba?
---
or just have the torso piece automatically put on the head piece and the same the other way around
---
Yeah, you are right. Freddy doesn't need add-ons to go against average survivors: there are a few killers like that (ghostface and pig, in my opinion (seriously, don't use pallet-ambush attack, it never works on good survivors). But average survivors are only average for so long: in a year, no-one will care about the Freddster because the average survivors skill level will have gone up once more. It's like billy: everyone used to complain about him, me included if I'm being honest. Now, no-one cares about anything but the insta-saw exploit because we all figured out how to loop better and apply pressure to the killer via gens.
---
Also, Freddy is really fun and I love when a gen explodes when you fake teleporting to it. But still, good survivors. (Although the fake pallets are really amazing against even the best, but that is an add-on).
---
Oh damn. Poor girl(and I know)
---
Just hug the walls as tightly as you can, other than that I don't really know what to say
---
Nothing toxic here
---
Buy Bubba for BBQ, it will reduce your grind in half.
---
For perks or for play? For play, I‚Äôd recommend Spirit and Ghostface (or wait for new killer who looks amazing). For perks, Bubba and Meyers.
---
Some people really arent serious. Music &gt; heartbeat
---
Yeah I agree
---
Oh...wow...thank you for your insightful intelligence oh wise one üòí You really showed me ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
De-pipping
---
Mori balances the game against toxic swf.
---
Periodttt
---
It looks way better than the current artwork
---
But you still grind the same amount, just at different periods of time
---
Buy bubba for perks, and buy spirit because she is a very good killer. But I will also recommend Demigorgon. Very fun killer with very unique builds to pull off
---
It might be, but its uses are so fringe and situational,I don't need perks like these saturating my Bloodweb and giving me less chance to get other powerful perks. I can always pick it up later when I want a specific build on a specific killer, but right now I just want to have a good selection of good perks on most killers.
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far...
---
I don‚Äôt know why you say that ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not on console‚Äù because console players can buy non licensed killers (and survivors) with shards.
---
the tightest 3 gen in history would be funnier if the gates are right behind you.
---
You ready to add two more in just a few short hours?
---
This is really good
---
I miss old Mettle of Man. Yes it made it too easy, but I get protection hits that give me a score event and no perk credit. It‚Äôs too buggy.
---
S M O O T H
---
I got my 4 kill Tier 3 achievement the other day and was so happy. ... The survivors were not.
---
Again im gonna repeat myself. Im not a toxic fucker like these kids in games alright? Bruh. Im saying that theres a difference between a hate in real world and that in a game which just a few kids thrash talking to you because theyre anonymous and wouldnt say that to you face to face
---
spirit is free, you can get her with shards. 
---
if he's looking for two characters to actually buy with money, i'd say bubba for bbq and myers for save the best for last and because he's fun af.
---
I already know most of the comments are people that hate True
---
Thank youuuuüíóüíó
---
Love the new tenacity buff
---
To get a hit you just have to get hit near a non-healthy person outside of 20 second intervals.

What do u need for evidence!? Don t u play in red ranks.. compared red ranks survivors are more boosted than killers but it‚Äôs a fact that the all good rank 1 players can agree that the rankin system is trash and needs a rework. Less boosted noobs in red ranks could make it less sweaty.. I m sorry that u think that only your ‚Äûopinion‚Äú counts tru3 but in reality we call it Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect
---
Does anyone know where to find the full pictures of these without any text on it or maybe just the dead by daylight logo? I only seem to find trapper and billy.
---
I‚Äôve just got 10 survivors to go to get all teachables, then it‚Äôs P3-50.
---
Where‚Äôs the oni ?
---
Maybe a UI bug, restart the queue or the game, shouldnt take more than 5 minutes
---
Meanwhile I think the funniest part is that they called Hallowed Blight "The Purge" event
---
if what you mean are there ignorant people in this world who have no prerequisite knowledge about any given subject yet still act as if and believe they are right? fuckin everywhere
---
What game mechanics can you think of that are not explained anywhere in the game other than you find out yourself (the hard way)?  :D
---
I ask this because I didn't know unactivated Demogorgon portals are invisible and thought it was a bug when he came out of one suddenly.
---
If we get a s-s-s-sneaky snake, we need to get Samuel L. Jackson as the Survivor.
---
I have had it, with these mother fuckin snakes, in this mother fuckin realm!
---
Menacingly
---
I can only imagine boil over being useful if you‚Äôre down close to the basement and the killer can‚Äôt see the hooks down there so they take you somewhere else.
---
He did like it. Hes still learning it.
---
im guessing this was after they cleansed it(or preemptively cleansed it)
---
Sure buddy, it's blue... So how does it feel like living in the Land of Make Belief? Everything cosy? Are the pineapples still pink and the pink unicorns still brown as well? Good to hear! Have a good one now, and don't forget to take your medication, you seemed to have skipped it a few times!
---
yeah he'll write the other person as self-confirming, an opinion confirmed by himself as well. In long long circular paragraphs saying the same thing
---
but funi baby yoda
---
Finally, some good fucking food.
---
The art I used I found by searching whatever chapter the killer was from and just clicking around in google images until I found a blank version of the art. Some I couldn't find a blank version for but only needed the face of the killer so it didn't matter
---
Once they push the update out the download will start if Steam is up and running or if your console is ins stand-by modus. Can't pre-load it I'm afraid.
---
I like the first one better be cause it requires work to activate

Thanks for that i actually grab a survivor one matched before i unlocked the challenge becauSe he was triying to rescue in front of my eyes
---
I could hear her footsteps too. But you can't say that here. It doesn't fit the subreddit narrative of "omg spirit is actually Hitler".
---
The oni. Releases in December.
---
You know, not everyone of this game sit on forums or reddit. It is possible that a fair portion of survivors simply don't know about that thing. And yeah, I rarely see killers giving hatch even if survey not struggle. Not that they should, but still.
---
*waits for the next survivor hate train to pull into the station*
---
Shut up.
---
Based on your profile history, you don't seem to have any original posts.
---
I'd love to see you try to make a mask like this.
---
You probably couldn't even do it with a paper plate.
---
I didnt thought of that
---
At that point I'll just run a full healing build.
---
my dude if ur depipping because u don‚Äôt slug for hatch, ur doing something very wrong.
---
I get how it‚Äôs supposed to work. I just don‚Äôt see it working often enough to run it.
---
This skin is the reason as to why I got superseded for 1 week. I just had to tell the Michael Player how sexy he was. Sadly The Concept of Context is impossible to grasp for Sony
---
Gee I wonder who you main
---
I think the plague is underrated and fun to play.
---
Fast vaults, flashlights, hatch spawn (survivors to gen ratio), sabotaged hooks/traps respawning timer, bbq locker hiding.
---
Here is how I play:
---
I pick up the slugged guy as a survivor. 
---
I don't care if the 4th survivor gets hatch. If anything this will help by slowing down the pace at which I reach red ranks which is nothing but longer queues.
---
Are just as loud about this in a real world just as you're on reddit? Probably just as much as these toxic kids online compared to what they do in a real world (nothing). Cuz theyre little shits when they are not anonymous. You can only report them there and it would get them banned tops. But wouldnt change any real problem about hate speech we have in real world. 
---
I cant believe you just cant take some random shitheads throwing swears at you over internet. They are anonymous your rambling will do nothing and youll not stop them that way. You all are basically saying you want things to change but all you do is report some idjits in dead by daylight game.
---
It‚Äôs really a shame that he‚Äôs so bad in game. They didn‚Äôt do him justice.
---
RIP your flashilight though ;)
---
Because I thought that each challenge was solely for one side or the other to complete.  Isn't that obvious by my question?
---
What's the symbol?  They each say either Killer challenge or Survivor challenge, one or the other.  None of them say, Killer and Survivor.  Well, I've not seen any...
---
Theres never been any news of any DBD player ever getting banned for custom icons as far as I know
---
That's why I have it binded on mouse ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Running unbreakable instead of DS on Laurie seems like a really good move.
---
Those were endearing bagz
---
There is no reason good enough to be toxic. Don't be like him
---
I would do this, but the game has no way to adjust in game sounds. Chase music is absurdly loud for no reason, and whenever you are injured or dying, there is crazy loud "you are dying now" music. The in game sound is already fighting itself, i don't want to add more to that.
---
I play on PC and I dabble on ps4 as well
---
THEY DO THAT SHIT EVEN WHEN I HAVE WE'LL MAKE IT
---
Tbh I just take my chances, since I usually give the hatch anyways
---
Matchbooks and Address Book to tide you over until Chewed Pen?
---
Could someone tell me why self care is not good anymore? I just noticed pro players stop using it.
---
You could try downloading the beta on test server, maybe that would reduce the download size by a significant amount and just patch stuff that was changed after beta.
---
I never tried this with this game so I'm unsure if it will work here, no idea how they're patching the game but this stuff often worked for other games.
---
Nice. Do you find it any easier or harder on PC. Visa versa
---
This is the way
---
I think people have had problems with spirit for a while now, but besides on console people didn't see her as much till nurse got nerfed. It went from aight that's bs but there's next game to oh look spirit for the 5th game in a row and I think it's just eating at people more now, but to be fair it dosnt always seem like spirit is as good in the 1v4 aspect unless she slugs and atleast for me I don't mind not knowing when she uses her ability so much just because I kinda like the guess game but I don't think she shouldn't get a penalty after using it like other killers who have movement abilities.  For example: Billy is harder to turn and can bump into things for long staggers, if nurse dosnt land a hit it = a stagger, legion coming out of his/their ability, all of these creates counter play for the survivor.  Even killers that teleport have a counter, you can hear and see Freddy using teleport,same with demi and hag traps can be seen to be avoided,  crouched over, or destroyed. I would just rather her not be able to mindlessly use super speed to close distance without any hindrances,  some could say her not being able to see you kinda is a shortcoming but not really if you have a good headset plus she sees scratchmarks,  ig you could always stop running to throw her off but that's just slowing down which will in the end just give you less distance
---
It's just the name of the build that the community has given it. It's more like, "Seriously annoying skillcheck Doctor."
---
But yes. It runs Overcharge.
---
Just don‚Äôt slug for the 4K and learn to not gaf about pipping or that extra 500 pts... please
---
I‚Äôm not surprised by your ignorance, to be honest. It‚Äôs no wonder our politics have become what they have. We‚Äôre just surrounded by people who pretend like nothing means anything and there‚Äôs no use trying to implement any change in current events. That‚Äôs really sad. Especially considering every monumental historical event has literally originated from pushback and protest. But, bringing awareness to hate speech won‚Äôt change anything, right? Hmmm, I think you don‚Äôt have any idea what you‚Äôre talking about, dude. 
---
Your complacency with anonymous hate is exactly why we have this problem, because others have it too. And it‚Äôs NOT. OKAY.  Got it? Good xxx
---
You are nitpicking and biased. I win, bye bye
---
Overcharge, Unnerving, Distressing, and Huntress Lullaby is my build.
---
Lamo there‚Äôs killer and survivor mains arguing with each other and then there‚Äôs shit like this. I love this sub.
---
I'm not defending anyone, simply explaining that point arent always incentive to stay, having fun is. And I disagree. I can think of lots of reasons that justify a DC.  
---
Penalties for DCing probably wont do much other than increase queue times.
---
I do slug for the 4th but I usually start looking for the hatch at the 3rd confirmed sacrifice. The slugging only happens when i happen to find them first (as i search along gen routes first). Bad mechanics through and through
---
Nope dude only because I use language u   connotes with toxic bhvr doesn‚Äôt mean I m that kind of player.. to be honest I was that toxic cunt 2 years ago on console that‚Äôs y I got banned and can t show u my  compilations. After the years break i picked the game up on my shitty laptop again this month.. I m already in the red ranks (only rank 3 atm) and still need most perks.. with controller and less than 30fps against pc players wtf!? I only can proof that rank with around 100 hours playtime atm but I should be rank 1 soon again.  I think that should be proof enough for the stupid rankin system.. I hate dedicated servers but maybe it is the fault of my old laptop.. I‚Äôm still happy that it should be finally possible to punish dc s.. so plz stop with your premature judgment, I didn‚Äôt dc in years! BTW I think tru3 is a very good player and I have nothing personal against him but his opinion is worthless because of his bias..
---
why is there so much nsfw on that sub. its odd
---
Rin be like: Teabag again BiTcH
---
lol she's for baby killers who are bad at chasing.
---
Black pip unless you slug for the fourth, I'll edit the rant
---
Wow thanks so much! I didn't think about downloading the beta server but I will for sure try downloading it now that I got nothing to do!
---
I bought the game for two friends... One of them I got into a solo match to give him the gist of the game. My poor friend kept blowing the gen up every time with normal skillchecks. 
---
His motivation for the game went from extremely excited to dead in a couple of solo rounds. I can't bring myself to make him join a normal match, because I know he's gonna hate it.
---
I‚Äôm gonna try waiting for someone I know to dress up as the legion (I‚Äôm a Susie main but legion keeps getting nerfed please help)
---
Rank rewards you with nothing (apart from maybe less braindead teammates in red ranks as Survivor) and you get a minimal amount of extra BP for the last hook anyway.
---
Dude really... I mean its just a kid saying youre gay and you like it in the ass. I would really take that with a grain of salt and ignore it. Its just a game. Dont go insane over it and dont let it get to you.
---
Tell that to the sweaty killers running the game an extra 4-8 minutes while they look for the last guy
---
Short spam killers camping
---
Long spam means come get me
---
&lt;3
---
I see that 420 in your shards....Nice
---
hello gamestop yes i would like a big yoshi
---
Hahaha!
---
I disagree. I play her like legion, spreading damage and discord amongst the survivors. Do you cleanse and anger your teammates? Or suffer the penalties from my perks? Do you infect everything you touch? Do you repair gens your teammates infected? You can tunnel as the Plague, but you can tunnel as any killer. It‚Äôs more fun to play then against one another.
---
Pretty sure thats her dad but I am also keen to play as oni. Not sure on the time of day they release things though
---
Got reported and accused of cheating for similar situation, only I was a killer. I swing at this girl hopping over same pallet, down her... Then magically teleport away from her behind a rock. Like, it's the first time I was so visibly confused by what happened
---
All I can really say is that they are different.
---
I find that the survivors I have encountered on ps4 aren't quite as up to the task as the ones I have played with on PC, but on the flip side, the killers I've played against on ps4 are a little but easier to play against
---
I've heard in a couple of different streams with good players, that self-care is a bit useless now. They all feel you can get the same amount of healing with a med-kit. So, instead of putting on self-care, they can use some other perk that can help them escape faster.
---
boomer bill mains unite
---
I browse TV Tropes from time to time, and a lot of stuff they put on is flat out stupid. This takes the cake.
---
You can still pip as Killer without getting a 4K, even at red ranks. You need a minimum 13 points to gain a pip, 3 Iridescent and Silver Sacrifice will give you 14 points.
---
Because that‚Äôs what the Doctor uses
---
It's mental how triggered people get over tbagging, you would think that tbaggers murder babies according to the narrative on here.
---
The killer: *looks at me within a 36 meter range wanting to kill me*
---
My Spinechill:
---
Yes it is
---
10-4 boomer
---
Me: unhooks Nancy and motions for her to get healed
---
Nancy: no run across the map for a locker
---
Slug!! U need a minimum of 10 hooks to get the adept. Use strong add ons and apply constant map pressure, slugging helps.
---
healing barely wastes time. if you‚Äôre healed by another survivor, two others could be working on generators for those 16 seconds. if you self-care, three others could be working on generators for those 32 seconds.
---
being fully healed can allow you to stay in chases for much longer which allows your teammates to do generators and wastes the killer‚Äôs patrol time.
---
Nice work, the original portraits look like the killers are going to get their license printed
---
But what did it cost?
---
Well yes but it's also undeniably boring for a lot of things in dbd.
---
Do it again.
---
Why do they say that keys are op?
---
That's assuming rank 20s actually don't die before hatch spawns which usually happens with obvious traps
---
All of the new survivors are loud af
---
Its just that the fnaf fanbase is kinda cringy and I don't want them ruining this game
---
Because rank is very important.........
---
Omg I'm making this my wallpaper.
---
It‚Äôs on sale right now for PC. Let‚Äôs make the jump together brother
---
I love how the comments immediately bait out the angry killer mains and ‚Äúpro‚Äù survivors ‚Äòget gud‚Äô
---
Ok I made a poll[here.](https://twitter.com/ferrariF1fan_/status/1201858270174097408?s=19)
---
I only farmed 300,000 last night I probably should‚Äôve save up before
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs pretty crazy. I get that it‚Äôs not cool for no reason but still. It does nothing whatsoever to the actual game itself. Also it‚Äôs entirely warranted if the killer is actually toxic and makes the game garbage by face camping and that‚Äôs when I‚Äôll teabag.
---
What are the people being slugged doing? It isn‚Äôt that hard to recover then crawl away from each other so the killer can‚Äôt camp them all. 
---
Slugging is so far down on the list of annoying things it doesn‚Äôt even make the top 15
---
Ranking system is the worst
---
They added that passive because BL was useless overwise. The thing is that it's the only exhaustion perk that is completely useless on some maps (eg. shelter woods) and not very useful on others (eg. Gas heaven).
---
I don't think it needed the nerf as much as some maps needed to be fixed.
---
Making no sound while falling is completely useless when you still make a huge stomp sound when you actually hit the ground. They should also completely remove stagger now instead of reducing it since it's a one time thing.
---
yep this happens to me every time i play against pig, i‚Äôm also on ps4
---
We'll Make It in a nutshell.
---
i run decisive and object of obsession on her solely to do generators. the killers just ignore me and assume i‚Äôm wanting to waste their time
---
It should be free if you bought Michael everyone should have a sexy pant less Myers

I reccomend Meg, she isn't that noob friendly but in the long term it will serve you a lot and you will not have to level up another character
---
On console you are running with a joystick which makes it basically impossible to run loops as tight as you can on PC. Thats why killers seem to catch up to you faster.
---
whenever i play as a male survivor they just feel slower. is there a reason for this?
---
Sometimes, if a survivor loops perfectly, the best thing for you to do is go find another survivor. If you know that survivor is going to take a lot of your time, then you wouldn't want to chase in the 1st place.
---
Pretty sure its approximately 2 hours away
---
... like i said, she's for killers who are bad at chasing and need to slow the game down. same with legion. typical thana, dying light, ruin, pop build. no one's impressed lol
---
So it comes out around 11 or 12?
---
hmm okay will try that next time, ty
---
There's aggressive banter then there's excessive personal shit like that has nothing to do with trash talk but just being an asshole who feels consequence free...agreed ya gotta steal yourself to it as it's hard to eliminate...but should we not also strive to punish or eliminate those players from multiplayer gaming whenever and however we can and fight to good fight to get the morons out of the game?....absolutely...nothing wrong with sounding off in the idiots ...they think because they live in their moms basement they can do anything they want.  Karma will get them one day...or already has.
---
Hahaha love this xD
---
now p3 them all
---
Maybe its cause I've been playing games a long time now and grew up with halo and cs so I've become desensitized to tbagging but yeah, it doesn't do anything. If people get irrationally angry over it they probably need to take a step back and chill out.

Wait you can use addons??? Fml almost got all of them and i would only bring the 3 perks.... And best tip just keep playing some took me 2 games others took me 10+.

---
I think DBD is to the point where there‚Äôs almost an overload of content to learn for new players... there‚Äôs so many killers that you have to learn to play against each differently. Pair that with the abundance of perks that they have to learn to understand like Noed, Ruin, Bbq, Knock-out and Devour Hope. They literally have to watch like 20 Monto or Otz videos before playing the game in order to understand how the game actually works and how each killer and perk work. Worst thing is that there‚Äôs no casual matchmaking and ranked, you either leave your friend to play by himself or drag him to red ranks.
---
Yes on console 
---
Left stick is going out 
---
Replace the analog stick or buy a new controller
---
Usually whenever people say "got bored so I made this" they didnt actually make it
---
Honestly, not enough people pay attention to the offerings to make a difference imo.
---
Looks like how it always does on Switch lmfao
---
Dont sleep tonight
---
What build?
---
the jacket is blue like Myers utfit ? :)
---
It‚Äôs and actual strategy and not an asshole move. If you weren‚Äôt meant to body block BHVR would just turn off collisions, Myers while stalking for example. Good luck out there in the fog friend. üëç
---
Well it's your fault. Never corner yourself
---
Being honest I would much rather have it be just the passive ability than have the 150% speed boost
---
big egos can‚Äôt even take video game humping.
---
Body blocking is 100% a legit tactic for both survivors and killers and important to learn when and how to use it to your advantage.
---
No bc then people would dodge as u explained urself and plus people could bring builds and items to counter exactly that killer. It's a hag? Bring flashlights. It's trapper? Bring small game and OoO and fuck all his traps all game long... It's any killer that can't do much? BRING HADDONFIELD AND BL so no never make this a thing
---
That's awesome
---
pn PC and no way to tell sadly.

yeh but why play a game where you get face camped? i'll take a 10 min penalty to not Q to avoid the same killer.

Swap Adrenaline with fixated. Trust me.
---
I‚Äôm the same with the numbers!
---
How did u do this?
---
I wholeheartedly agree. In fact, I think you've summed it up wonderfully. In essence, the game is very simple. However, it's all the content that a new player has to sift through and remember, that makes it super unbalanced at the start.
---
I do think that they should start considering a more casual route. The challenges that come with the tomes are fun, but they really impede players from giving it their all in a round. Also, it'd be fun to do rituals with casual players, since you aren't forced to leave them and wait for better ones to come out.
---
i do this when it's safe. y'all should too.
---
Is there a way I can change my Spine chill icon to this?
---
Console and PC? I‚Äôm used to PC getting it first. Also, HELL YEAH.
---
i never once said show us the killer we're going against, just their steam name. i've gone against the same killer over different periods of the day and its always the same with this person, literal face camp...
---
yes, it‚Äôs written in the post.
---
Fragrant tuft with Judith's tombstone. If you manage to get max stalk on at least all the survivors, you get the option to mori throughout the entire match(or what's left of it due to the time to set it up.) Hence the name "Forever Mori Myers." It's best used with perks like play with your food(to gain some speed due to myers slow ass), Noed (for the end game for the 5% speed boost), Ruin(to slow the game down since it's gonna take FOREVER to get max stalk), and I guess thanat or another slow down perk since ruin can get cleansed so early. it's a very tough build to pull off. most of the time you wont get tier 3 until they're at the open exit gates waiting. Or you're very lucky and get potatos and they let you stalk them to max.
---
I can hear the BOIIIIIIIII from the demogorgon
---
Have fun chasing survivors while I easily 4K and enjoy myself.
---
That's not true. Analogs are actually very good for movement.
---
It's a build. I run it sometimes. I don't see anything wrong with using synergizing perks and addons. 
---
Gens are too fast, what if slowing the game just a little bit isn't enough, why are killers not allowed to slow the game down a whole lotta bit?
---
Amazing!
---
Thats dream goals
---
Swing chains, Ruin, PGTW, Thana, Nurses/BBQ I  would imagine, You basically grow a 3 foot beard trying to do one gen
---
ggsüíñ
---
thank you for being nice, i‚Äôll practice!
---
Awww, poor baby. Salty about nothing but a leggit strategy for a bad killer. Do you need head scratches? Or a cookie?
---
yea I think its like 2ish hours
---
Agreed, love his theme so much, I hope they don't make his release leave a bad taste.
---
It would be kinda fun if there was some kind of party assist like fortnite(forbidden name) has, where a friend can help you do a challege.
---
okay, thank you for your tips.
---
To get protection hits you literally have to be glued to the injured survivor‚Äôs back when you get hit, I‚Äòve been farming WGLF with protection hits for almost a year now.
---
Oni doesnt stand a chance against ace are you kidding me that man is to charming.
---
i thought it was unfair because i just couldn‚Äôt move at all, i was hiding behind a wall by the gate and had open space to run behind me and to the right and left, so when i couldn‚Äôt i was salty. but i get how it‚Äôs fair, and i will try harder to avoid it and also to use it.
---
Great title though
---
Know when to give up on chases is fundamental !  I know for example I had a game last night having been chased by the killer from Killer Shack, into a jungle gym, then into the cow loop whilst my team did 4 gens, The Killer DC‚Äôd because you have basically thrown the game away
---
Thank you and honestly it made my day lol that he couldn't find me the whole match there were some close calls but spine chill is amazingly helpful when used right.
---
The only down side is i didnt pip cause no chase points which is bullshit cause if the killer cant find you the whole match you should still be rewarded for it.
---
Kinky might try this at the next family gathering
---
This was possible, veeeery long time ago
---
Does botany help with the self care reduce healing by 50% or does it not affect it?

Ah yes, I also like to oblit the rate.

Everyone just needs to be Ace
---
He facecamped during the game, and had noed, we cleansed, I was stating that if you facecamp, and on top of that have noed, I will be toxic and fuck with you, not manipulative at all
---
It's your prerogative if you wish to save them or not. If you found them to be toxic and generally not nice, screw them
---
Thank you for nipping this in the bud, Spongebob meme floods are the worst.
---
But there‚Äôs no Killer to wield them all.
---
i know that now, i was upset without reason and people pointed out how and why i was in the wrong and i accept it. i didn‚Äôt know body-blocking was considered a valid strategy, but now i do and now i can learn to use it and to avoid it and so i will never post something like this again. because you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs whining. but trolling doesn‚Äôt do anything dude, except make you a troll.
---
Well my post kinda lied i actually saved one and then bodyblocked him so the wraith could get him thats toxic right?
---
Lol stop being immersed then. I have no idea why people continue to sit in corners, it gives the killer free hirs
---
Head On is the perk with chest hair.
---
I totally understand this kind of thinking, I've got a friend playing on PS4 while I'm over here on PC.
---
She got Freddy over the summer, after the rework, but didn't want any of his perks. She finally got the point where she didn't have a choice, it was giving her 3 teachables and 1 perk...she was telling she was going to quit using him, and I was going "That's silly. Just buy Remember Me, and maybe Blood Warden, and be done with it."
---
Still a struggle to get her to get those. :P
---
Oni‚Äôs bound to fix that with his quiet-ass terror radius music
---
Like... can people look at the new section before creating a thread? This has been asked about 10 times in the last 24 hours. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO SEARCH!
---
What time does Oni Release today?
---
He did have noed, we cleansed it, my title says facecamping+noed=toxic claudette, clearly I was messing with him, there is obviously gameplay here that you didnt see
---
I mean, yeah, but it's Karma too. Maybe he'll think on it next time he's being toxic elsewhere. Probably not, but just maybe.
---
Botany doesn‚Äôt stack with We‚Äôll make it sadly. Since healing bonuses can not exceed 100%
---
i love this. i require more
---
Last night they had the core of a sick rig on sale for 514 on Amazon (3800x msi gaming pro carbon and a Samsung 970 Evo 500 m2)
---
Awesome!
---
Then what's the need for those If you wont show any evidence of it?it just feels stupid at that point. Also it's not toxic btw. If you wanna be toxic talk to rank 1 neas.
---
Meme floods like these are only welcome if they last a dat
---
So am I! How did I not see this until now?
---
That's really weird. Haven't had that happen. Wait you weren't camping were you?
---
very cool, may I ask what material is it made of?
---
Thanks! Yep, being unable to test it I just gave out the idea. Someone said the survivors lack interaction with the map, and I thought this could be beneficial to both survivors (as now you have an incentive to walk the map, stealth your way) and killers (as survivors can't PVE gen rush without being out there in the open). Thats basically the idea of the Hex:Ruin, of course, but the survivor version.
---
also wasnt camping, was running a PWYF bubba build
---
It‚Äôs amazing isn‚Äôt it.
---
Are you rank 15-20? Saw that you play on PC, hardly ever get matched up twice in a row with same killer
---
You've gotta wait for another hour my dude.
---
Never did the bounce cuz none heals in reds
---
SmoothSkin
---
IKR?
---
The only addons I want are own and address book. I don‚Äôt even know what to bother with otherwise.
---
Having them change to the skins you use is such a good idea too, siege does that when you buy elites. It just adds a fresh look to the menu and makes it feel less plain and repetitive I would love this to be a thing!
---
Breaching into red is definitely a matter of time. Getting R1 and keeping it is the difficult part as long as you go out your way to safety pip every game.
---
It kind of worked?

Great job mods. This is great, I'm sure there'll be a lot of them so now it's more organized and it's easier if you want to look at all of them in one thread.
---
PSA to new and learning Survivors: Healing directly under the hook may feel unsafe, but if the Killer isn‚Äôt around it is often the safest and most efficient option. If you notice a status effect for We‚Äôll Make It pop up on your screen (a little person holding a hook) then you will be healed in a matter of seconds, likely before the Killer can even make it back. Don‚Äôt run and hide, it just wastes time.
---
Wow Very nice !
---
You can but the whole reason I personally avoid doing this is bc the Anticheat can pick it up and ban you for it, and BHVR said they will not undo bans issued for this.
---
What do matchbooks do? Are they brown?
---
I feel this on a spiritual level.
---
Then I am glad they are extending the range. I always use hook rescues for WGLF. The bonus points are the best.
---
botany helps reducing the time, yep - hence why some people run that combination
---
it looks so much better !!
---
Whats so special about it ?
---
Silence you'll break the summoning
---
thank you, i‚Äôll watch some streamers to learn better strategy. i‚Äôm a noob/scrub still and had no idea body blocking was considered good play lol
---
A wizard is never late
---
I've had custom icons for a while now, no bans have been issued.
---
And i've read up on that, seems like pure fiction
---
You weren‚Äôt totally wrong.
---
It‚Äôs iconic that‚Äôs what.
---
No one wanted to see those anyway, so thank you.
---
When using No Mither, why do you start out in the injured state instead of it just applying the broken status effect after you get hit the first time?
---
If you get camped you'll be dead and out of the game in less than 10 mins so what's the difference? You don't even know if the killer will camp you until you're in it.
---
Ur in red ranks lol. You might not have to worry too much about escaping since you can still safety if you die but that killer needs to 3K at best in order to safety. So of course they‚Äôre gonna play sweaty.
---
You put on the two addons that reduce repair speed while in the dream state.
---
For perks, you use Dying Light, Thanapobia, Ruin etc. Anything that will slow down the game as much as possible.
---
I haven't gone up against it yet myself, but it seems awful to play against...
---
That looks crazy good
---
Fuck Wendy tho
---
Haha, makes sense. What platform if you don't mind?
---
How do you see which killer it is?
---
Read the title and thought this was the card fight vanguard subreddit

Lol. I can try posting a new png later today :D

A lot of people have the custom icons. I even have some friends who use them. But I remember reading a post on the forums where I think it was Peanits who basically said ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt going out of our way to penalize you for it but if you get banned by the anti cheat we aren‚Äôt going to undo it‚Äù

---
You hold down the ps button to bring up the side screen , you scroll to the game your playing, then you go to currently playing with. You can see who your teammates names are in lobby so the person that isnt your teammates is the killer
---
Okay and does it stack with we'll make it?
---
I want some of these! ahhh
---
Meyers reminds me of prof Snape :D
---
The Anti Cheat doesn't check the folders with icons, because it obviously gives no advantage and isn't considered cheating.
---
Honestly dude. I remember is beta when it was always Trapper, and therefore small game was op and the best perk in the game. Then they added wraith and suddenly the cast was doubled overnight. I remember when I got serious about playing the game a bit after nurse was added, and wondered what they would add next as far as killers. The slow addition of killers is really deceiving, and before you know it we have tons of them. Dbd really is a horror fans wet dream, with well known killers and truly creative original ones too.
---
Uh, I mean
---

---
Also wanted to add that the Offerings would make good tea kettle.. things... that keep heat off surfaces.. i can't think of the term. for hot things.

So you see player name but not which killer they're playing as?

---
Dying Light
---

---
Ruin
---
PGTW
---
+
---
Yellow rope
---
Green rope
---
OR
---
Swing chains
---
I get that points become irrelevant for you as a player, but what I meant is that it's a good guideline for me as a survivor because that's the info I can see at the end of each game. I can't follow the killer and see how well they're playing the whole time, but at the end of a match, even those that let survivors leave always end up with tons of points as long as they hook a couple survivors several times, without the need to camp.
---
I play as killer occasionally, usually for dailies and funsies, so I don't experience several losses in a row. And because I mostly play survivor, I make sure not to camp and not to tunnel, basically avoiding the stuff that frustrates me as a survivor. It's not complicated.
---
Anyways, overall, I think there are just things that make the game fun for both sides and that's what I try to strive for as a player in general. I'm usually more mad at bad survivors on my team than the killer, but campers are just frustrating because they sap point opportunities for all players, themselves included. Tunneling doesn't bother me as much unless it's camp and tunnel combined. That just feels shitty.
---
Ultimately, a good game to me is when I can look at the point tally and see that most players got about the same amount of bloodpoints. Everyone participated.
---
That makes sense. De-pipping several times in a row feels bad.

---
claud is cuteüíñ i like it!
---
Yeah it can be a bit tricky when I'm after something specific but I like having access to everything
---
I know this is asking alot, but is there a way you can make it match the icon background? I'm using the Galaxy Icon Pack
---
I'll get there! At least with the killers it's worth leveling them all up!
---
afaik - Yes, they do - but only when healing others.
---
Ace looks weird
---
Same as fuck
---
How do pig traps interact with the exit gates like sometimes their head pops if they leave and not other time
---
If you can show me where to get the icon pack files, I can see how they are made and make this one similar so it'll work.
---
Okay thx man
---
the spirit can find players thanks to bodyblock? everyone rages. Wraith can 'cause he's cool and y'all are fine with this. Since she cannot anymore, he should get the same treatment tbh.

We know very little yet, other than that BHVR is being careful not to call it a buff/nerf and that they aren't anywhere near ready to start teasing details. 
---
People have already begun wild speculation that they're going to eliminate his ability to 3-gen stack and mess with skill checks because survivors find it annoying but no one has any actual solid info.
---
Thank you, I knew there was some other perk that did something that I couldn't remember. That's the one.
---
Woah so with a green medkit speed addons, botany and we'll make it its like a 3 second heal right ?

It's just boring, gens take 10 years.

You did this for one round and think it's enough of a sample to conclude that killers are nerfed compared to survivors? It sounds like you guys just worked well and the killer hardly tried.

---
Are you asking because you a genuinely confused about the perk's mechanics, or you asking a rhetorical perk balance question?
---
If it's the first, No Mither's description is: "You are affected by the Broken Status Effect for the duration of the Trial". So that's that.
---
If it's the ladder. We don't know. The developers have made it clear they see No Mither as being "hard mode" for survivors, so they've intentionally designed it to be seriously underpowered.
---
sadly they didn‚Äôt have mercy on my Patrick Myers... ;(

Yeah, but what's a special occasion? I tend to do this and don't know I should have used it until the match is already over haha.
---
Then they cant blame you for hiding in a locker for 2 minutes
---
I mean in a way you still are, because you'll still have +33% when you're not at +100%
---
I can't unsee that foot now üò¶
---
Sadly not
---
because it‚Äôs a huge waste of time, especially if the killer is using slowdown like sloppy. you would be much more productive doing a gen or almost anything else. plus, there‚Äôs so much better healing options. bond or empathy, inner strength, pharmacy, anything that wastes less time.
---
Yea I‚Äôm so hung up about it. Maybe the fact that they were toxic was because they were acting like killers couldn‚Äôt be toxic
---
Can we talk about how sick Bill looks
---
The killer challenges have skull icons.
---
The survivor challenges have gears icons.
---
The killer/survivor challenges havelike, a swirling entity icon. 
---
This is extrememly obvious by looking at the context of the missions and what they say to do, and using your human pattern recognition to notice that there are very few for both sides. 
---
Also, another way to seek them out, is that they often occur at a crossroads between killer and survivor challenges that intersect.

There are more results simply from searching "self-care" but I am too lazy to grab them all at the moment.
---
He do be vibin‚Äô tho
---
Okay I can see how running particular addons is considered toxic, but hooking people? How is this toxic lol? And I mean, if the Spirit is red rank she took these addons thinking she‚Äôs going into a game with other red rank players and the powerful addons are supposed to help her in a game against the survivors who are competent and coordinated. How was she supposed to know you‚Äôre bringing your 20-19 rank friends with you?
---
Just reading the challenge should give it away. If it‚Äôs something that can be done by both sides, it‚Äôs a challenge that can be done by both. If it‚Äôs something only one side can do, it‚Äôs for that side
---
you? too lazy to grab links? are you feeling ok bud?
---
I think it goes by preference or by your gameplay style. Watch some vids about each of them and try to find one that you like. I bought the Hag for example bc I liked its gameplay, later bought myers and spirit and didnt quite like them
---
the trade off is that most maps (besides Hawkins, Game, and Haddonfield) don‚Äôt have as readily available of usable areas for BL whereas there‚Äôs always tons of lockers and vaults available for head on and lithe
---
I believe this is possible on pc. I dont play on pc but ive heard you can check your recent players on steam and just look to see your 4 most recent and obviously the one thats not a survivor in your lobby is the killer.
---
Yeah. You have to specifically like, down all remaininf survivors, open a gate yourself, then go hook the others and hope no one gets a lucky hatch spawn or they crawl out the door without you noticing
---
no im rank 2. seems very common in my ranks..
---
There are many perks that could better fill the slot for better use, the time it takes is quite terrible compared to other healing methods and the generator progress you lose, and the same thing can be accomplished with a med-kit which doesn't take a perk slot.
---
&gt;you? too lazy to grab links? are you feeling ok bud?
---
I often don't use the search to grab links, just keep updating my comment every time a new thread about the same subject is made.
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand the post at all, the spirit being sweaty in not the problem. The spirit being toxic and repeatedly hitting someone while they are on the hook is. Did you even read?
---
[https://we.tl/t-T69qiC4NAt](https://we.tl/t-T69qiC4NAt)
---
The speed is pretty slow, and actually extends you're hitbox upwards. Never self care against a huntress, she can get a chunky hit off you by the pixels around or above the cover. It's just depends on a person playstyle, however I use iron will.
---
My school got canceled, perfect timing for the chapter
---
No it‚Äôs not very common
---
Hahaha so damn true.
---
A lot of people are giving you crap here but here's some info to help in future games. After the killer hits you you no longer collide with the killer. So as long as you're full health they can not body block you. This includes hits that do no damage "Man of Mettle". Basically only hide in places that may get you blocked when full health.
---
Body blocking is only really seen as unfair when survivors block other survivors on purpose or killers hold the game hostage by locking you in a place forever.
---
A killers wet dream
---
Oh I thought smacking people on the hook is like a metaphor for uhh I dunno throwing/hanging on the hook. Like to smack a person on the hook=to put a person on the hook. Lol idk English isn‚Äôt my first language and it made sense to me. But yeah hitting a person on the hook is pretty shitty. Don‚Äôt see why she would do that against an opponent who most probably wasn‚Äôt even that challenging to down in the first place. Sorry for the misunderstanding.
---
I think it'll drop in one hour
---
You can't link progression between systems but on the 10th of December the Nightmare Ed. is releasing for $39.99 containing all Expansions *(only the Oni one you'll have to buy still).*

here is an Amazon Link: [Dead by Daylight: Nightmare Edition - Xbox One](https://www.amazon.com/Dead-Daylight-Nightmare-Xbox-One/dp/B07NMVVWZL/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=Dead%2Bby%2Bdaylight&amp;qid=1575384902&amp;sr=8-5&amp;th=1)
---
Yeah, the sale was on Wensday, and it says one week only, and today is Tuesday, plus there is 10 more hours on the shrine of secrets
---
Imo, there is no win or lose when it comes to killing and escaping. The only win/lose situation is your pip and ranks. If you depip or rank down(or up in this case", you are losing, but if you can manage your rank and keep going up(or down in this case) you are winning. It's not always about killing and escaping, it's what you do, how much of it you did, and how good you did it
---
I would buy Freddy, a really good killer
---
Updoot
---
The horror!
---
For the newcomers: you need to get chased and run to the other side of the map, if the killer follows you great, if not its do and repeat.
---
Wait really? Your problem with keys is the aura reading ability? Are you serious right now?
---
Yeah, that art has always been weird for me. I think this one is better: https://media.comicbook.com/2018/09/dead-by-daylight-shattered-bloodline-1134596-1280x0.jpeg
---
Have an upvote.
---
Haha thanks. Have a good day and hopefully your friends rank up soon so it‚Äôs not so painful. And that the Killers you meet will be more benevolent than this Spirit.
---
Jake in the game looks nothing like the way he looks in the intro cutscene
---
I guess it's a little of both but it just doesn't make sense to me that you start the trial injured before any sort of interaction with the killer. Did I trip on a stick and slam my head into a rock before loading in? Am I supposed to think there was some behind the scenes interaction between the killer and myself where I was chased, injured, and escaped with nothing to show for it? I don't know, stupid question I guess but hey, this is a "no stupid questions" thread.
---
Yep.
---
whats yours?
---
I love you so much &lt;3

---
Because people don't like watching other players not play in an 'optimal' manner.
---
It boils down to the biggest critics treating their fellow survivors like units in a RTS game and getting a tad pissy when those units don't do what they're 'supposed' to do.
---
"Healing yourself? Cease and desist you idiot, I command that you spend the game injured so we can rush down gens and exit the game in less time then we spent in queue!"
---
All it boils down to is this, if you enjoy the perk, keep running it. People give self-care users so much shit for running a 'useless' perk, meanwhile I see stupid meme bullshit like Head On or Diversion get plenty of praise even though those perks will probably provide even less use  than self-care to the team. 
---
Mathematically you're not hindering your team by any sort of significant degree, if it all
---
* 1 person self caring = 32 second heal time = 32 seconds not on a generator
---
* 1 Injured survivor + 1 other survivor = 16 second heal time = 32 combined seconds not on a generator
---
It all evens out in the end. And if you use Self-Care &amp; Botany knowledge together than it's even less of an issue, plus then you negate most healing speed debuffs when you heal others.
---
Glitches every time I play against him.
---
So that‚Äôs what it looks like from the other perspective, we see this kind of thing happen from the killer side but it‚Äôs fun to see what the survivor is thinking in this situation. Thanks for sharing, and next time, just leave. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
It will do one or the other, not both. If you take a hit the pink medkit has no effect. It's still nice bc if the killer hits you within 8 seconds you get a free hit, if they don't hit you for 16 seconds you get a free heal
---
Hatch doesn‚Äôt appear until a certain criteria is met. But sure, i could care less about keys. Hatch escapes should only work for 1 guy not a whole team, but that is something i don‚Äôt think will change.
---
Nope 5th

Carter's spark
---
I know what you are talking about - as far as I know it only refers to other people using WWMI. Maybe they have changed it, but a few months ago it still stacked.
---
Got this shirt around Halloween, its so fun
---
BBQ is fine as is.
---
learning the maps is of course valuable for a multitude of reasons, but if you're not sure where the basement entrance is I would suggest taking a few seconds to find it *before* downing + carrying a survivor.
---
You are right on the first one and it does do both effects.
---
It should be in like under a hour.
---
spirit fury cam in once
---
I feel for you.
---
Why don't you first learn how to counter something instead of complain? not trying to hate, but these posts doen't have sense
---
It's entirely based on time played like you said, not skill
---
2%, which is normally going to be 1.6 seconds.
---
Spirit if you want a really strong killer but she is kinda hard to use and she is getting nerfed today (she will still be amazing, just even harder to use).
---
Freddy if you want a really strong killer that is also easy to play (not nurse/spirit strong tho).
---
Oni is coming out today and if unchanged from the beta he is really strong in the right hands.
---
The other killers you don't already have are just a matter of preference.
---
Why would you use the medkit and enter the locker? and it wouldn't be enough for MoM to kick in anyway, especially on this version
---
and you can't tank a hit with it when you're Deep Wounded
---
the real question is when are they gonna fix no mither still giving blood to the oni
---
Note that you can still use the hatch with an active trap.
---
Dwight with Bond is imo the best starter, especially for solo queues.  Use it to find your teammates and do objectives with them.
---
Ugh, that's 8pm in germany.

Supposedly in ~30 minutes the next Patch will drop and finally implement the long awaited punishments for D/C'ing.
---
I say supposedly because while the patch notes indicated in the PTB it was implemented, I saw zero indication within the PTB environment it actually did anything. This could possibly just be because it's only intended for live servers. 
---
Still, we'll find out soon enough. Even if it's just something like a timer that starts at 5 minutes and keeps increasing it will be a godsend.
---
That fire up tho
---
I run in either a duo, a three-man, and occasionally a four-man. The duo is most common. We all go out of our way to *not* be toxic though. None of us run super meta perks beyond me running Adrenaline for the rare chance I'm alive in the endgame (very rare). None of us even really use flashlights since we go for hooks rather than saves since one of the gang is a baby potato who still fast vaults while trying to be sneaky. We just do the gens and try to have fun. No super meta builds, no bullying, just trying to play the game.
---
Removed for oversaturated content
---
I think they should maybe merge WGLF and we‚Äôll make it, but that‚Äôs another thing. While BBQ isn‚Äôt the best tracking perk it‚Äôs extremely useful for finding survivors
---
iM gOInG tO RePoRt yOu
---
This is the one time a killer can complain about gen rush.
---
idk, i had to too
---
That's because most Spirit players just respect the pallet, and if you drop it they either phase walk you or "mind game" you by standing still at it until you do something then phase walking. Basically dropping a pallet on a half decent Spirit is an invitation to a game of chance.
---
No wonder he‚Äôs not catching her, he‚Äôs not running it optimally
---
Quite understandable...
---
Which version of Coldwind? If it's not in the shack then in the Thompson House it's under the staircase, in Fractured Cowshed it'll be in the small room off the main shed, in Torment Creek it's in the silo, and in Rancid Abattoir it's just beside the cattle run in the abattoir.
---
For Asylum and Swamp I'd suggest looping the area *before* you pick up the survivor. Minimal time loss, and if you're lucky another survivor might arrive to pick the downed one up (yay, two for one!).
---
I was just giving some reasoning for why I did this, normally I would have just ran out the gate, but since they played like that, I messed with him
---
&gt;besides Hawkins, Game, and Haddonfield
---
And Crotus Prenn Asylum, and Ormond, and Springwood, and Red Forest, and Backwater Swamp...
---

Ok fair enough. Trapping the exit gates is douche move to be fair

&gt;#CHANGES TO EVENT COSMETICS UNLOCK
---
&gt;In the latest Dev Update, we announced our plan to unlock a large list of exclusive cosmetics to all players on PC and console. According to the feedback we received, we decided to review the unlocking process for the following cosmetics:
---
&gt;* Hound (The Huntress ‚Äì Event Mask)
---
&gt;* Untamed Donkey Jacket (David King ‚Äì Event Body)
---
&gt;* Pro-Pain Hammer (The Hillbilly ‚Äì Event Weapon)
---
&gt;* Free Song Bird Slip Dress (Kate Denson ‚Äì Event Body)
---
&gt;As it was mentioned by many players, these cosmetics were earned during events and were representative of the player's dedication to the game. The way these cosmetics were stored created an issue where a loss of progress was possible, we've since switched to a more secure method of storage for event cosmetics.
---
&gt;At the time of the announcement, last month, we had no way to isolate players who had earned these cosmetics. Since then, we have found a way to isolate the players that have played the event and will be able to restore these four cosmetics on a large scale, only to players that earned them during the events. Keep an eye on the news, this will happen Soon
---
Dope! Definitely the smarter choice here since unlike exclusive codes, these cosmetics were involved in black market trading for real money.
---
Should've looped better you DC pussy.
---
Everyone and their mom DCs in this game.
---
That's my beef. I could farm, but in the same amount of time I could actually play a match normally and enjoy myself instead of mechanically walking around and ticking boxes for points. I'd honestly rather actually play the match and get less points than just using twice as much time to go through the motions.  
---
I've **RARELY** agreed to farm as Killer, but I always make it clear that I'm not interested. As Survivor, I think the one time I've ever intentionally D/C'd in my life is when we had one D/C and I was on my last hook and the Killer just refused to sacrifice me despite the fact I was essentially AFK. Just kept insisting I wiggle off his shoulder. I got so frustrated after like the third time the teammates healed me up and he downed me/picked me back up and just stood there waiting that I just left. Like take a hint.
---
The only thing Michael is pissed about is that he can't kill them himself.
---
Some killers play like if they stay in rank 1 they will get rewarded or something, I would honestly rather play low rank killer and let all the potatoes escape after having my fun than have to sweat my ass every game just to be rank 1 and not get any reward

I think Jane is a survivor with at least to viable perks, besides that I agree with the first post, go based off what perks interest you the most that way you can later unlock them for everyone else. If Kate is a dlc, I'd get her, but it's been so long since I've gotten a survivor. I don't remember who is dlc and who is free.
---
Yo why‚Äôs Adam looking fresh as hell though?
---
This is bad advice if a killer uses their sound.
---
Slenderman's mutated cousin, Streched man.
---
This all looks extremely yummy!
---
OMG they didn't nerf the sh*t out of him!
---
I was walking and texting, here's what I meant to say and I think you knew what I meant:
---
Slugging and not chasing someone *is* toxic  but putting pressure on others isn't toxic, standing over them and following them doing Nothing is toxic
---
Weird, he just reminds me of daddy üçÜüí¶
---
Dope! Definitely the smarter choice here since unlike exclusive codes, these cosmetics were not involved in black market trading for real money.
---
No, because its specifically his portrayal as Quentin in the Nightmare on Elm Street movie, he doesnt own the rights to Quentin so his word doesn't just hand wave to make it happen.
---
I don't even tunnel, and still get pissed off at D-strike. The perk lasts way too long for it to be considered just "anti-tunnel"
---
Playing duo survivor really is a pain I understand, because the other two will mostly be playing like it‚Äôs free for all or something. Like this Nea pair where one got hooked in the basement and someone popped haunted grounds, and the other Nea just full sends into the basement where the spirit is without any borrowed time... I honestly wonder how some survivors are purple rank
---
Add some flashlight clicking to really make them go "nope, fuck you" and it's big brain time!
---
The fact that it's so split makes any arguments for one side pretty wrong lol. Realistically, spamming it could just send the wrong signal to your team if they think the other way. Either way, what happens depends on the skill of your teammates.
---
I'm gonna be honest chief, I think you forgot to add them. I don't see a single word.
---
Heh, at the same time I wouldn't call playing spirit with pink add-ons "sweating." Shoot I main hag without using add-ons or moris and really only care about the most coordinated swf teams.
---
Shit!!!
---
Have you heard of our loud, lord and savior, Bill?
---
UNLEASH THE CHAPTER
---
To be honest i sort of like how the original pictures look so realistic. Like its kind of unnerving looking at the legions because you can see the details. of the paper mask
---
I absolutely understand it, as I'm in the camp of 'I wanna p3 everyone, yes...EVERYONE. Yes, even you Quentin.'
---
you are absolutely 100% correct in the idea of 'bloodweb saturation'. But the 'solution' I had was to find someone I wanted to P3, someone I was gonna play and play, and play no matter what.
---
For Survivor side, that wound up being Bill. Bill currently has every perk on him, at their highest rankings. so no matter what, I can do any Survivor challenge with him in regards to perks.
---
On Killer side, I waffled for awhile. I started to REALLY play around the time Piggy was getting introduced (though I had been playing off and on since that previous August), and for a little while I was maining Bubba. I found him relatively easy to use, and I wanted his Survivor Face masks, so he seemed like a good idea at the time (I did thankfully get those, and then moved on). So right now, my main is Freddy, who has....most...of the Killer perks.
---
Which is annoying. He's P3, but like the Killer challenge with Unnerving, I had to go through 3 bloodwebs before that finally showed itself. Which is annoying. so yeah, I get the whole 'it's polluting it'. Best advice is just get who you want as high with prestige as you want, then just gobble up perks like mad.
---
same logic applied and gets downvoted...sir you forgot this is reddit...IQ means nothing here.

Yes, it was on the BHVR twitter. Also, the official patch notes and release information were released this morning.

good reply üëç

I like how the new change to deep wound was clearly addressing the Legion+Nemesis.

Can someone copy and paste the patch notes in the comments. Can‚Äôt open it.

Can someone copy and paste the patch notes. I can‚Äôt open it right now.

ds 1 feels like it last 10 seconds and ds 3 feels like it last 10 minutes

It also means borrowed time can work against Freddy again so that‚Äôs a plus
---
Wait wut, update goes live in 15 minutes but DLC is being enabled hour later?
---
Bruh I'm so happy you changed your mind about the one off comic you did and kept going, I love this. When I get paid, I wanna buy stickers of my favs, if u do the new survivor I'll buy that too

Yay!, Freddy no longer gets to fuck you up if you have borrowed time
---
No more Nemisis plus legion!
---
**Moderator note:**

&gt; Please use the pinned Megathread.

Well I think Borrowed still interacts the same, borrowed still only activates while in Terror Radius.
---
Great change

Side note: That also means BT will work on Freddy now.

https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/108852/steam-patch-notes-3-4-0-chapter-14 direct link to patchnotes, but too much and cba with the formatting, sorry.
---
I copy pasted this from the FAQ of r/PerkByDaylight :  
---
Can you get banned from using custom icons?   
---
Yes and no. BHVR(creators of dead by daylight) won't go out of their way to ban you form using them, while EAC (easy anti-cheat) can ban you, if their anti-cheat get's triggered. That is why we recommend you only change the PNG files and nothing else. But rest assured, as of the moment there is no reports of getting banned for changing the icons.
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that allowed Killers to hit Survivors through a hooked Survivor.  
---
If I'm reading this right, smacking someone on the hook is back! While it was fun never having to worry about hitting the wrong target when someone goes for a save, at least now we will get that satisfying 'squelch' when need to vent some steam on a hooked survivor.
---
well, calculation can help. when did you roughly start playing?
---
I like then both, but just leveled up feng and find alert really nice.  It is fantastic help to stay out of the killer's way.  Seeing the killer is across the map gives you assurance to finish a gen or go for save.  Plus in the 4 seconds after they break a pallet or stomp a gen you usually see which direction they are headed next, letting you know what part of the map is more likely to be safe for the time being, or if you need to hide/run
---
That's the thing, idk which perks I should get
---
Bruh I get like one escape in 10 games I can‚Äôt even comprehend this
---
I‚Äôve gone against my fair share of spirits and I can definitely tell you that this one was sweating. There was a Bound envelope, a bloody party, an escape cake and she brought a hollow shell. And she still played that as if there was 2gens left. I was even wondering to myself ‚ÄúDo you even care if YOU get bloodpoints?‚Äù

---
    Misc LOD fixes and improvements.
---
thanks
---
Exactly. The haters are still going to hate,  unfortunately.
---
I'm only green ranks (just got to rank 12 after a long losing streak that kept me trapped between 15-13), but sometimes other survivors make me question my sanity. It's one thing when they're babies (because matchmaking is broken, and we've been paired with infant survivors many times.), but there will be 10-8 rank players doing some dumb shit that makes us both go "WHY IS THE RANK 17 BEING SMARTER THAN YOU???" while we suffer the consequences of their actions.
---
&gt; Updated several Killer perks with the Undetectable status effect: Insidious, Beast of Prey, Dark Devotion and Tinkerer. 
---
Dark Devotion sounds really nice now. I wonder how Undetectable works with Spirit's phasing?
---
Wow really? Original content? Sure.
---
&gt;Can someone copy and paste the patch notes in the comments. Can‚Äôt open it.
---
There is another thread specifically for patch notes, people will probably post over there. This thread is here about Release Information.
---
it's always been this way...
---
You'll still be able to buy Yui and Oni in the in-game store with Cells or Shards before then, but the DLC itself won't be available for a bit.
---
This is dope! Wish I played on pc so I could change them :‚Äôc

thanks mods. i got really tired of seeing them
---
He seems fine to me too, but I heard somewhere that he's supposedly getting reworked soon.
---
Demise of the faithful and curtain call. 2 DLC packs I'd recommend if you don't currently own them. For the survivors I mentioned earlier.
---
A few more hours and every DC will get bans... just wait for it it's gonna be a glorious shit stom on this subreddit!
---
So did they changw anything with legion and nemesis? Cant see anything here
---
Any word on possible changes to Oni and Yui based on the PTB?
---
Like August of last year when it became free on PS+
---
Unless it's good players in which case "THE GENS COME FIRST!"
---
Ty for info ;\]
---
Test your controller. Change the struggle button input in the options. See if it's the button.
---
I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as bad as people think. If you have survivors who can keep up a good chase, the game should still go at a decent pace. It‚Äôs just a different style of play.
---
[Part 1/3]
---
RIP me, chose the wrong thread to comment in. 
---
&gt;    Fixed an issue that allowed Killers to hit Survivors through a hooked Survivor.
---
 &gt;   Fixed an issue that caused downed Survivor auras to be visible to The Plague when using the Black Incense add-on.
---
Still my favorite add-on for her, just no longer a free infinite range Deerstalker. Oh well, enjoyed it while it lasted.
---
&gt; Deep Wound timer will no longer go down when Sprinting or while Mending.  Deep Wound is no longer connected with the Killers terror radius. 
---
I hope this doesn't mean what I think it means.
---
Yep I am very happy about this. Mostly because it means that I'm getting all my event cosmetics back since I was one of the ppl who lost em
---
Oh. Uh... thats too long to calculate. Is there no time tracker on PS4? cause there is none in dbd
---
[Part 3/3]

KNOWN ISSUES
---
    Multiple strings have the incorrect localization in Russian.
---
Ah I gotcha, completely forgot you can buy DLC pack lol
---
I thought he had noed so you couldn‚Äôt let him hit you otherwise you would go down
---
That insults weaker than your dads pullout game.
---
I have it. I play this game everyday.  Survivor wait time is around 2 minutes and killer around 5-10 min .
---
The player base is really active on the switch still
---
Visit r/shittyrainbow6 these memes are everywhere there
---
Well yes actually even if I don't think they would put him in considering all the other killers where originals one but it can be
---
Had my first ever 4 man DC yesterday when I used prayer beads spirit for the first time before they rework them. Then got messaged ‚ÄúLol wasted add-ons‚Äù by one of the survivors afterwards as if I cared that I used 1/13 of my prayer beads when they‚Äôre being reworked today.  Can‚Äôt wait for the DC penalties!
---
Either you're really good or theyre really bad, franklins doesnt win games on its own so you mustve just slapped them about afterwards lmao
---
What makes no fucking sense? DID I SAY I dont want survivors to flashlight save? I SAID annoying little SWF dick head squads that are INTENTIONALLY trying to be asses and NOT DO GENS for 3 MAN flashlight ambushes is dumb as fuck...The only thing toxic &amp; delusional here is you.
---
we are getting bill's sweater for free? fuck yeah!!!
---
I thought that was the Korean Donkey Jacket they were talking about, unlucky :(
---
You're most welcome!
---
Designed like this as people were able to hack the game and get basically unlimited BP, it was initially hard capped at 500k until they upped it to 1mil
---
F
---
There are none
---
They basically deleted it.

oh man survivor mains were screaming so much about new Legion being back. sorry guys, you can't play victim anymore
---
I wonder if they're gonna refuse to give it back if their method messes up and misses someone who actually earned it like they did with Legacy.
---
Canvas I‚Äôm pretty sure
---
Deep Wound timer will no longer go down when Sprinting or while Mending. Deep Wound is no longer connected with the Killers terror radius.
---
not to be rude but as killer I love when that happens. I wouldve gotten the NOED challenge prior to update if it was equipped. Meg was hooked and Jane just ran in the exit gate
---
I'm gonna miss my big cap for ace being rare
---
yeah I completely understand that. i‚Äôm an xbox player so I didn‚Äôt even think about the whole hacking part which I should‚Äôve.
---
i‚Äôve tried to find out before and as far as i know, there‚Äôs no way to find out. you can only really
---
guesstimate
---
Ha. Should have known one of his haters would post it on here.
---
Yeah there isn't one on PS4 which is why I'm trying to figure out like on average how long it takes to get to a devotion level. Figure that would be the easiest way to check.
---
It's okay OP fuck em
---
Still no dedicated servers for console :(
---
I like the small changes made to Oni. It‚Äôll make getting demon mode slightly more difficult, but you also don‚Äôt totally lose it when you pick someone up, meaning you don‚Äôt have to slug everyone now.
---
This has turned into a difficult situation...
---
Wait they actually brought back moon walking legion?
---
looks like the terror radius doesn't affect mending now.  They can just sprint or start mending to stop the down timer.
---
Ah you're the asshat that called someone who got trash talked's title toxic. No wonder you act like this
---
Should be live in stores in 1h from now.
---
there are people here genuinely giving advice and tips. if i hadn‚Äôt come here to complain, i wouldn‚Äôt have known a lot of what i learned from this post. so meh, lesson learnt tho.
---
This is good. All of the Huntress gods deserve their unique mask. Turning it into Frosty Eyes 2.0 would have been such a joke.
---
that's when you start slugging. Been playing since 2016 never had an issue with flashlights. If anything flashlights were so absurdly more oppressive. If you're not braindead flashlights are useless now
---
Yes it also means legion has no power
---
Same but like I said for xbox gamepass. Tbh I didnt even know about it until my friend told me
---
sad
---
This is definitely a nice surprise, wonder if it's because if BHVR charged $$$ for a Bill Cosmetic, they'd have to re-negotiate their agreement with Valve and this is probably the easier option?
---
I don‚Äôt see a trio of well dressed multiracial people watch them whilst repeatedly squating/spinning in a circle whilst spamming a collection of mixed flashlights ranging from high end flashlights to Tesco own brand flashlights.
---
Yeah, i'm experiencing a problem. I can't move my Trapper Patrick post to the megathread. Any help?
---
I was actually wondering when this was gonna get the sticky but apparently the Patrick meme sticky had priority over actual game events.
---
Yea it can be used only once.
---
I love the lights. I'm going to do the same thing I think!
---
This is a bait. Ignore it.
---
more bt buffs epic, why are bhvr so committed to having deep wounds and by the same please give legion his own mechanic sperate from bt
---
These are so good! Keep it up!
---
happened once I died 10 seconds after this.
---
For some reason all of the after-ptb changes were shoved to the bottom, so scroll down.
---
Ata girl nothing is honestly more annoying then that
---
Poor Dwight though
---
it means he has the same power as before this patch and post-nerf. which was always no power.
---
if survivors wanna sprint around to avoid deep wounds instead of doing gens that's fine by me
---
Not gonna lie, my hook-blind ass is a little grateful if that's the case.
---
DCing survs has plagued this game for a long time now. Hopefully today's update helps.
---
Well i appear to have started a shitstorm, im posting this because a lot of u guys seem to directly attack him because of his opinions this subreddit is very bad for it.If u disagree with him just day so.dont make an hour long post on reddit about why hes the plague of yhis community
---
Oh my gosh. Watching a claudette trying to self care with sloppy when the team gave the killer an easy 3 gen strat drives me up a wall.
---
Stealth is kinda hard to do currently with all the new killers and perks but Nancy has a great perk that allows you to walk faster when you aren‚Äôt injured and Jane also has the perk that gives you no scratch marks when finishing a gen
---
We live in a society
---
Good thing y‚Äôall got all them exclusives
---
Ah thanks!
---
I'll be frank with you
---
And now I'm being downvoted, isn't that cute?
---
The update will be pushed ~50 minutes form now, the DLC can be purchased and hour after that.
---
bait? my friend it is pure epic truth. ya'll were screaming bloody murder about old legion being back
---
especially you!
---
Didn't happen
---
It really adds a level of ambiance when playing DBD.
---
Me and my friend got the game on pc 2 days ago (i used to play on ps4) and are still relatively new, the 2 other survivors just afk'd from the beginning of the game. Is this a common theme in the game
---
I got another question haha
---
 If the window to use DS runs out and I hook the survivor again, does it reactivate when they get saved a second time?
---
David be lookin like a snacc.
---
The update is actually available now.
---
So glad they listened and fixed the issue!
---
Everytime i try to have fun with a non meta killer i always get the most boosted survivors that rush the gens so fast they depip
---
This. He has the right of publicity and can choose to lend DbD his face. The studio doesn't own the face of the actor, just their role.
---
Noon EST
---
BAM BAM!!
---
Kyf.....
---
Sadly this meme was a fail
---
Yes it reactives even if you pick survivor but he decide to not dc you and keep it he can.
---
45 minutes from now
---
There‚Äôs definitely nothing wrong with the tracking on bbq. It definitely gets the job done. It has its own counters so it‚Äôs not broken. 
---
WGLF and WMI would be a nice touch together. Maybe give the heal speed buff a delay after you get the safe unhook so that way you can‚Äôt just rip the survivor off the hook and speed heal them before the killer has even walked away.
---
So weird I have 42,000 shards too. Been saving for chapter 14 and elf Dwight lol
---
You are correct, pardon me.
---
Wheres janes ass, i demand thiccness
---
The bbq event ended the month before ps+ could get it for free from ps+ subscriptions. Dbd was only free during the month of August iirc.
---
I‚Äôm sorry chief, don‚Äôt see anything there. I might be blind
---
the patch notes page or release information page?
---
ps4 update should have hit at 11am est but hasnt yet atleast not for me. the dlc will drop at 12pm
---
Haha love that!
---
My jeff post got remived, yours might to...
---
thats the dlc unlocking the update is at 11am
---
Some redditors downvote everything without particular reason. Now i‚Äôll be getting ready to be downvoted too!
---
I hope so because this is an issue even leading up until rank reset
---
The whole point of this game is to literally play the victim.
---
Kudos for sticking with the BPS instead of an Ebony with that lineup.
---
thank you for the advice! i had no idea about the colliding! and yeah, the body block upset me because even after he appeared he didn‚Äôt really hit me. just kept me there and stared, let me heal, and then hit me again before hooking.
---
How long is it, 40 seconds, right? Anyways when sloppy was on, I didn't bother using my self-care unless I was at least 80% healed.
---
One time I unhooked a David &amp; followed him for so long that he used Dead Hard to get away from me because he had No Mither.
---
Slugging is just a sneaky way to block the hatch. unless you see the last survivor you can't either put him on pressure or chase him. You are just forcing him to choose between ignoring his teammate and suiciding while saving him, since you are nearby waiting for him. That's toxic!
---
Downvote is not an escape.
---
All we need is Freddy now
---
I also added the Yui portrait just now but I can't decide which one to use, yet: [https://imgur.com/a/UKLlbJd](https://imgur.com/a/UKLlbJd)
---
Well I have both of those cosmetics and I got the game from Plus so maybe PlayStation had the event  at a different time?
---
you are confusing the subreddit with the game, friendo
---
just got the update, dling now
---
Nefing both oni and legion? What the actual fuck bhvr? And people wonder why survivor queue times are so long...
---
I thought the update was meant to be out now on ps4?
---
Patch notes page steam
---
I love these portraits! I wish I  could use them plus idk how to use them.
---
Update just came out on ps4
---
I didn't downvote you bro/gal. Wasn't trying to be a piece of shit. I just realized immediately after posting.
---
I see a small handfull of AFK's that don't stay AFK. I assume it's somebody going to refill a drink.
---
I just want my favorite ugly boy in the game
---
IIRC Valve is very easy to negotiate with and it doesn't take that much for them to approve of things.
---
I still don‚Äôt have it yet. üò≠
---
In my case they were afk the full game and obviously died on the hook
---
Try a restart maybe
---
Ah my bad then, I guess I just wasn't playing then. Cheers!
---
Imma start livin by that motto too than smh
---
I was thinking they did a good job on the tweaks. He'll still be strong but no where near as beastly as he was in the PTB. Let's see how this plays out
---
Did anyone do spirit or ace?
---
Me too! I only play on switch. But he seems fun to play with. Hopefully soon
---
What if someone's team is slugged and they are the first to be hooked? Should they not try to try to escape? There are just too many grey areas where punishing someone for this would not work.
---
Agreed, kind of hoping they try and test Dedicated servers but I know that could be a disaster too
---
i mean, its behaviour. i think people had a good reason.
---
When even the achivments are bugged, you know its bughavoir on the job XD
---
They really needed to shit on console players so hard wow
---
I should probably play survivor for once to understand their mechanics better. Thanks!
---
So instead of working around the whole nemesis and legion combo that was about to be possible, you literally nerf the lethality of frenzy even MORE somehow? Wtf  are you doing to my favorite killer.
---
So what, I use my power and do nothing now?
---
Cool story.
---
I'mma head on out.
---
That‚Äôs what I been saying honestly ppl will just close app no way they can track this at all without them dedicated servers or there will be a lot of false positives
---
This isn't a nerf, this is to prevent scummy players from abusing Nemesis and just following someone until they are downed.
---
Hi just to clarify some things :
---
   
---
DISCONNECTION PENALTY FEATURE - TESTING
---
As of Thursday, December 5th, we will be testing a new feature on our Dedicated Server enabled platforms (Steam, Windows Store and Switch‚Ñ¢). This feature is designed to penalize players that are disconnecting from matches.
---
Users who disconnect from matches will be prevented from joining a new match for a predetermined length of time, which increases after each instance of disconnection. Our objective with this feature is to discourage players from quitting games and will serve a double purpose of excluding users who are already in a negative mental state from re-entering matchmaking until they‚Äôve had a chance to cool down.
---
The system will also apply if one or more players in a group has an active disconnect penalty, preventing the entire group from joining the matchmaking queue until the penalized members have either cleared their penalty or leave the group.
---
The incremental penalties will decay naturally over time, starting after the most recent matchmaking ban has completed.
---
Oh. Ok. Gotcha. It's been a long time since then so I was just going off what I could remember. Good to know though.
---
BHVR: So, how should we have our game handle lag? I was thinking players with high ping should stall and actions shouldn't have a delayed reaction so they don't benefit from said lag.
---
Dave Richard: Dio.
---
BHVR: Sorry?
---
Dave Richard: The killer will be Dio if he lags. ‚úãI have spoken.
---
it was less than 3gb for me on ps4
---
Even if you hide from the BBQ and hide in a locker, guess where she goes next .... reloading !
---
On Xbox you can use the app so see how many hours you have on a certain game. Maybe the PS4 app has that too
---
You mean you‚Äôll now more consistently be in the place you should be instead of going against people you shouldn‚Äôt be with. I‚Äôm happy for this change, because I really don‚Äôt like playing with low rank survivors/killers, it doesn‚Äôt feel rewarding escaping against a Huntress with &lt;100 hours who has never seen a survivor juke a hatchet. The thing I‚Äôm worried about is potentially seeing more derankers/match throwers during reset.
---
You don‚Äôt hear the vacuum sound when you‚Äôre in the Spirit‚Äôs terror radius so would Undetectable mean you can always hear the whoosh?
---
Worded great, thank ya friend lol. Theres just so much that goes into everything with a game like this and its infuriating to see people boil it down to "Well the actor said yes so where is the change??"
---
Not anymore

Helps with what, its not like suicide on hooks dosen t exist.
---
PS4 player here and wish we had that info as well. 
---
I do know that at the end of last year, I got an email describing my PSN‚Äôs stats and playtime for various games and such for 2018 so maybe we can expect that this year as well. 
---
I also started in August 2018 and by January 2019 had accumulated about 700 DBD hours, for reference. I am not sure how accurate that is for 2019 though, as I think I may have played even more frequently this year. Been regularly playing about 15 months and about to hit Devotion 6. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
This gets posted everytime a new chapter comes out. Its not original
---
So... Legion is worthless now?
---
Reading trhu all your coments is geat, but i just now relised. That they also sent me to the swamp. Atm i was like.. F
---
I don't know, but they never were worth it anyway, a shirt with and without scratch marks is barely any different.
---
Hasn't it been months since this was mentioned?
---
Flashlight is forü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (mostly)
---
I laughed
---
Ikr? People overreact just because they can‚Äôt slam all the gens in 5 seconds
---
You say it‚Äôs still in testing then if that‚Äôs the case your patch notes for ps4 is wrong as it says Feature - Disconnection Penalties: Players who disconnect early from games will receive temporary matchmaking bans, with the duration escalating for repeat offenders.
---
one second is a long time for something like that.
---
Well yes but no. Some Legion players used Dark Devotion or Tinkerer to benefit from the lack of terror radius when chasing someone in Deep Wound and it made for some fun games against them, albeit a bit annoying. Yes this change was needed in regards to Freddy, Undetectable and the new perk but it still nerfs Legion nonetheless.
---
*no0b3 enters the chat*
---
It‚Äôs not supposed to be used in chases though.
---
A survivor help me get my bear trap challenges, had a dc &amp; sacrifice so i let them finish all the gens and go
---
‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ MORI ME ONI ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§
---
lol no
---
they nerfed legion into the ground then pissed on their grave because of survivor main screaming. bhvr were not going to just bring them back
---
This didn't age well
---
Maybe she has the perk that let's you heal in lockers lol?
---
holy fuck that is broken
---
how is that still in the game
---
Honestly, that kinda annoys me too. Especially since they went back on their word. I love the the David jacket, but there was no way for me to even buy it, which annoyed me, because you could still buy the other Lunar event cosmetics.
---
Even worse is that iirc, you can buy ever Halloween cosmetic, none of them are being locked away.
---
Honestly, I think the best thing to do is atleast make those cosmetics buyable. People who had it beforehand got it for free and for two years while people who have to buy it pay real money and get it wayyy later.
---
Ik but it‚Äôs still annoying when it happens
---
They won't be DCing for long lol. New update will see to that.
---
I still don't get that.  Why would you give up about 20K BP so that someone else can get an extra 5K?
---
Lmao, so after purging the content I'm not sure how many people will partake now. 
---
I mean, whatever I guess. Heres mine:
---
https://twitter.com/BunBoiArts/status/1201588153540321280?s=19
---
I disagree.
---
After looking myself I see that I posted the wrong image. I have a version of this with and without the words because of how my editing software works. My mistake mate.
---
His face isnt owned by the studio
---
They hire people üëå
---
Not op, with the amount of books and time it takes to wiggle out, this combo will almost never work.
---
Eh, all I see is bullying a baby Killer :(
---
The Xbox dbd community is either toxic as hell or extremely wholesome. There is no in between
---
I was so disappointed when I saw that.
---
It is a nerf. Yes it was needed to prevent exploits but it still hurts Legion.
---
Demogorgon didn‚Äôt change
---
Your flair is hilarious since this comment is definitely a whine.
---
it used to be like that but they fixed it a long time ago lmao
---
At the very least you‚Äôll get sacrifice points.
---
Thankgod!
---
I've played so much Bill and his plainness has super bugged me!
---
okay, as much as I agree that spirit is really annoying, this is just overkill
---
The Deep Wound changes just fucks Legion over even more. BHVR really just need to bite the bullet and rework their ability to something entirely new. Deep Wound will seemingly never work fairly for either side at this rate since there will be a way to exploit it. First it was moonwalking, then it was Undetectable/Oblivious exploit, i imagine at some point this new change will be exploited by survivors to where they won‚Äôt have to mend and just make Legion an objectively worse Plague
---
like 10 minutes ago
---
Oh, good to know. Its been a while since i tried.
---
So wait, this won‚Äôt be available for other consoles as of now?
---
A. You shouldn't be doing it with the killer around. B. They buffed the cooldown. C. Stop whining.
---
Dude they should pay you for this and make it default
---
I agree. Which is why he really needs a speed buff as a bandaid fix until he gets the Freddy treatment
---
You mean Scott created a situation in his video about something true didn't say to do against spirit, he even said specifically NOT to do that thing in the video. The overall argument i got from that video from Scott was if you did Tru3's strat that you would waste pallets, of which - against an actual good team, is false as by the time you've "wasted" all of them all the gens are done.
---
I could dive into a debate about how spirit has counterplay but ill just get comments that have no meaningful message.
---
Yeah, red really sets the tone.
---
ooh right theres a new penalty for dcing i forgot about that
---
Well according to the devs the dc time out is not out and is just in testing starting December 5th https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e5ivpk/release_information_340/f9k1e8i/?context=3
---
it couldn't be used in chases anyway. but now if the killer notices someone trying it they have much less time to complete it
---
Mom says it's my turn to post this next!
---
The oni nerf was small and needed, AND they buffed him at the same time.
---
Stop. Whining.
---
lol dont pretend old legion didnt get nerfed for a very good reason. 
---
behaviour has also had a history of interesting balancing choices, so people being worried that old legion might return is warranted. They let Freddy have the oblivious status so the bleed out timer would drain while in chase for several months and there was nothing the survivor could do.
---
Will there also be an incremental timeout penalty for lobby dodging? This is needed for PS4 especially. You wait 5-10 minutes (at best) for a match...then the killer quits the lobby because they don't like the 'look' of certain survivors. Lobby dodging is as bad as DCing. As survivor it is insanely infuriating that I cannot play a match in a game that I have paid for because the killer decides that they don't fancy it...with ZERO punishment to them. Essentially I am the one being punished and if you thought the grind was bad before for the tome imagine only being able to start 2-4 matches per hour (and then getting camped/moried smh).
---
Don't get me wrong, I get more than enough 'ez' messages after killer matches after some flashlight clicking dickhead has run me around a little...so I do understand the temptation to refuse to start the match. Maybe it doesn't have to be a timeout but you only get to quit x number of lobbies per day before the timeouts start? Then you don't have to play against a full toxic SWF if you chose not to, but ultimately there will be consequences if you continue to enter lobbies and then quit them?
---
PS. This will probably get downvoted to hell by every killer main...I'll assume every downvote is a killer main who only wants easy 4K matches...let's see how many there are ;))
---
This is Amanda's version of slamming the gate on Adam
---
The banner with all the survivors in their sweaters looks so cool to me
---
Same I lost power though :(
---
Maybe if you're a survivor.
---
Or maybe remove the fucking struggle, make it automatic so people can't kill themselves
---
Anyway it's annoying in general, adds nothing to the game
---
I'd rather have them put skill checks in struggle phase, just remove the mashing
---
&gt; B. They buffed the cooldown
---
it's the exact same at tier 3 which is the only thing that matters
---
&gt; C. Stop whining.
---
TIL not wanting survivors nerfed is whining
---
okie
---
He's holding the camera dont worry
---
Did the same with 100k yesterday
---
Shutup and take my upvote!
---
No problem, I hope you'll get many hours of joy out of this game \^\^
---
boil over helps the killer most of the time. honestly i would love to have every survivor waste 2 perk slots.
---
Oh, shit! Bill's sweater will be free????
---
Haha took me a moment. In all fairness a crucifix is not the first thing I think of when it comes to Freddy. Taking up insomnia is.
---
Yes, that's how it currently works.
---
Are the killers not victims of the entity?
---
Yeah but you can't flashlight blind a spirit while she's doing phase walk.
---
ooh decisive is better than what i said haha
---
Oh my god I forgot about no trap trapper.
---
Haha.
---
Hm, Leonardo Da Vinci, wasn't that Ezio Auditore's friend?
---
Yes but shes also pretty much impossible to blind while breaking a pallet
---
Yep. I‚Äôm fine.
---
Here‚Äôs the original comment in question: ‚Äúlol they fucking nerfed By Any Means Necessary. How dumb‚Äù
---
That doesn‚Äôt sound so chill and ‚Äúun-extraordinary‚Äù to me. But whatever. We‚Äôll just pretend you‚Äôre right.
---
Have a swell day.
---
its really weird too because her name isnt even Yui Kimura. It's Kimura Yui. Last name is the name you address people by in japan.
---
Uhhhh idk I'm just a dumb freshman :P
---
If you're toxic you should be the female pointing ;)
---
Bills Christmas sweater is free? Yessssss
---
I know some farmer's down and let people struggle off to get the struggle points, but it's still annoying to be slugged and handled like that without some indication of a farming killer (hitting objects, spinning, etc) since you think they're just being a dick. End game trolling is annoying more than anything else since usually you know which way the wind is blowing (win, tie, loss, etc), so it's just a frustrating issue of just getting it to end.
---
yes i have at least 20000 shards im definently prepared for it
---
Here is the best ghostface advice I can give, play him how he wasn‚Äôt meant to be played. Use his power to his his terror radius. Quick gen grabs. Use it during chase. Survivors will constantly look behind you to make to see where you are since they don‚Äôt see your red stain.
---
Do not. I repeat. DO NOT use stalk to expose the survivors. It‚Äôs pointless. They‚Äôll just loop you till it expires. 
---
Run the power recovery add ons and GG. You‚Äôve got a powerful killer. Play smart and good luck mate. He‚Äôs my faves.
---
big brain plays rn
---
Ghostface memes bother me specifically largely because revealing him is still buggy as fuck, and even if I don't reveal him, if my camera touches him for a single second he gets an audio cue that he's been revealed and turns around to spot you, even though you can't ever reveal him when he's stalking.
---
I'm exposed sometimes without spine chill just because Ghostface stealth has no downsides (see: slow Pig, slow EW1 Myers, Wraith needing to uncloak) to his movespeed and getting to approach a generator from any angle without any noise to lean and expose a survivor, or because he camps a hook in night shroud.
---
But when I actually spot Ghostface first I could teabag him at that pallet for decades without getting exposed if his reveal mechanic actually worked as advertised, not that I do, but I *could* without every getting exposed for it.
---
Another cool build I like to run is Quick and Quiet, Lithe, Urban Evasion and Dance With Me.
---
Makes you vanish from the killer, its really fun.
---
Level 1 Billy??? How??
---
Also..don‚Äôt use NOED. Just get good at the game.
---
Honestly at this stage I'd rather just be able to buy them in the Store like they're planning to do with shit from the Rift pass.
---
Maybe i'm missing something but it just looks like she's looking to the left.
---
o
---
Then it‚Äôs a gift from god
---
Stubborn pride is OP as shit, also vore killer vore killer
---
good...spent alot of time with the game open in AFK....some people are not noob dumb fucks and actually know how to use a fucking flashlight...its not good for the majority who dont know how to blind the killer. Use your 'brain cells' and learn to admit when you are wrong instead of spiraling down into further stupidity.
---
I mean, it depends on how long you ha e on the hook. If you were literally just placed, you're damn right I'm destroying that totem. Just in case noed is a thing.
---
Hey now maybe someday I'll want to be the most inefficient healer ever! (Maybe they'll buff them, who knows)
---
Yes, there are two parties that have an ability to ban you and they have no idea what the others will do.
---
it's not like anyone went down from frenzy except new players anyway
---
I admit it: when I give them the bounce and I don't get one back I get a little sad lol üòî
---
It is especially since head on increases your chance to be tunneled
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
If you're tight on money, please remember that you don't NEED to buy them. Be smart, I don't want anybody to run out of money at the end of the month :')
---
Same
---
It truly is. I just switched from Xbox to PC and Xbox seems unbearable. For the most part i've run into some pretty cool players on PC.
---
I even played as nurse last night, I could hardly land a hit but two of the players actually stopped and said "good try!" And "you'll get used to it, let me know if you want to practice"
---
Xbox I probably would have gotten "gg ez baby killer. Git go0od" etc etc
---
10/10
---
No people just been complaining about her face for no reason , she looks good .
---
Thanks for your reply! but if you're going to comment, can you atleast give a suggestion, or read the entire thing? I just posted this so it would be difficult to read in 3 minutes :)
---
Thank you for your input though, I will lower the percentage.
---
Because hardly anyone plays both sides. Hey good on both sides and you‚Äôll achieve enlightenment, AKA. This game is not meant to be balanced, it‚Äôs not competitive, it‚Äôs a party game.
---
Thankfully means the epidemic of hook camping Freddies tunneling unhooked players should be stopped, or at least lessened. People will now have to actually play the video game.
---
I fear it may be OP going cross eyed.
---
Wait, the dc bit is only for pc?
---
I've played it daily since launch without issues on the Switch, it's been great to have the option to play portable. Wait times are similar to other platforms. They just added Leatherface to the Switch version so now we're only missing Freddy, seems like they're doing pretty well with Switch updates now.
---
It just means you can't do it in a chase
---
I said easily accessible, there‚Äôs plenty of opportunities to get caught far away from the BL loop locations on the maps you mention and get downed before you have time to get there. unless you‚Äôre just always lurking near those central locations and wasting time not doing gens
---
I agree 100%. It just shafts new players.
---
Yeah I felt like it was just OP trying to get in for a popular post or some shit.
---
Okay.
---
I used a Hockey mask from Amazon as a base to build on, I then used EVA foam to create the perfect 'flat' face that Legion has, then I used a thin layer of paper mache on top (To match the mask description and look).
---
The reason it looks bumpy, is because I used paper towels for the paper mache. Since that's what his mask is made of in the game.
---
Ghostface's crouch is useless (I know, it can be used so you don't trigger crows), nothing compared to Pig's where she hides her TR and can ambush. I think it's fair being slow. Give it a buff so it's faster, I don't care. But instant crouch? nah bruh
---
100% believe that.
---
&gt; That doesn‚Äôt sound so chill and ‚Äúun-extraordinary‚Äù to me.
---
you must be remarkably sensitive then. how do you even make it day to day?
---
probably because i dont understand what youre complaining about. 
---
no survivor worth their salt was asking for legion nerfs after his big nerf. That was just behaviour making gameplay consistent.
---
"oh man survivor mains were screaming so much about new Legion being back. sorry guys, you can't play victim anymore" 
---
your exact words btw. I mean, this 100% comes off as mocking survivors that didn't want old legion back, because you think they're trying to be victims by not wanting uncounterable killers in the game.
---
Why would you use noed on him anyway lol
---
Im new to the game, whats wrong with collecting the bp‚Äôs?
---
That ain't the Susie mask we know and love
---
Put ghostface in the background stalking then ;)
---
These are pretty cool. Favourite bring the Winter Sweater and Meg/Dwight screens. They should definitely consider making these as loading screens.
---
Yeah hopefully
---
It‚Äôs not his build he copied it off someone else.
---
Not on console tho, only from December 5th on.
---
Yes..
---
MAD GRIT INTENSIFIES
---
True true
---
Wait it‚Äôs free? Are all Christmas skins free?
---
Never thought I'd see Steve in official artwork, either, but that's pretty sweet.
---
I was mocking people for acting like bhvr was actually going to let that go through, and I was right to
---
i was not mocking people for not wanting old legion back
---
i know that distinction is hard to see for people who live and die via self-imposed victimhood
---
All except Susie
---
Same, I only hit red ranks recently and thought I'd be playing with the 'pro' players and got a little worried that I'm not that good of a player myself.
---
Turns out that often times red rank players can be as potato as rank 20s.
---
 I still have far too many matches with people slow crouching around in the corners while the killer's floating around the hook.
---
I have it on goof authority that depsite him changing the channel name the devs know who he is. Biker is a piece of shit who cant manage 1k views per vid. His channel is full of bots. Thankfully the YT persons know exactly what he is like. This same piece of poop tried to make pornos also. look it up..VR porn where he could prey on vulnerable women. He also stole that domain name for LY. As bad as the devs may have been biker is x50. The guy is a loser.
---
Bought it now, she has a different color shirt and logo on the back of the jacket.
---
but if they utilize the mechanic that gives them "less urgency" then they aren't contributing in any way to the team
---
....why does it matter?
---
this is possibly the best icon pack i've ever seen. Gonna be my first too
---
Imagine defending a teabagger
---
Console players had the chance to get them.
---
this is a killer main subreddit. that's why
---
Why does anything matter? ü§î
---
Will this ban effect those that are DC‚Äôd  because of the servers. I‚Äôve been DC‚Äôd a number of times and I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the servers that are dropping me.
---
Why I main Freddy
---
I feel like slugging is just part of his style. It would make sense to lose all that momentum to just stop to pick someone up. He's a good slugging killer with the best map mobility in the game. Letting him keep that mobility after stopping to pick up a survivor seems kind of broken.
---
No they're not. They already stated that was not meant to be included in the console patch notes. It's been removed from the notes now.
---
Anything does matter why?
---
Even if it‚Äôs second book, if you just got put on imma break that totem first just in case. But in your case yeah if they let you hit struggle while they broke a totem that‚Äôs just a crappy teammate.
---
Where did I defended him?? My first sentence was T-Bagging is toxic get your head out of your ass.
---
The only thing making him somewhat strong, STBFL, has been completely removed, same with sloppy.
---
ü§îü§îü§îü§î
---
Ik they have stated this to me
---
As a killer, and as a survivor, its shame shit.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e5k6cc/so_im_looking_to_do_a_stream_for_dead_by_daylight/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
You literally compared using a tactic to win the game to actually taunting! And I‚Äôm the one who needs to get my head out of my ass?
---
Thankfully? I actually hope they fix that as well. No reason a killer should counter an entire perk by just existing, especially a perk designed specifically to punish a killer for going after the unhooked person.
---
at least you photographed horizontally \~
---
jesus... Let me explain slower ig.
---
Items in the charity case, the DLC pack filled with streamer exclusive cosmetics (https://prnt.sc/q5ormx) gives you the same exact cosmetics as the ones you had to use codes for.
---
You own the hexy jacket from the charity case so you have it. well people buy the streamers codes still for thousands of dollars just bc its a different rarity. 
---
The exclusives (aka the inclusives now) are ultra rare to avoid ANYONE selling or buying the codes. the whole reason why they gave them away was to stop scamming.
---
Dude, they are pinned to the top of this subreddit
---
Oni hitbox still broken 
---
All you need to know
---
It's pinned to the top of this sub..
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/108882/release-information-3-4-0
---
Because why take extra time and effort to change something trivial as rarity when it isn't harming the game in any way.
---
*laughs in spirit fury + enduring*
---
Not seeing anything about the Mettle of Man changes, did that not make the patch?
---
What do you mean?
---
oh right, i forgot about that. i assumed they where not going through with that part. they just hate legion.
---
Get just one of the DS or head on - both will do the same if chased after a hook. Instead get detectives hunch as last perk for finding totems easly
---
And then I kinda wonder why you don't account Crotus Prenn Asylum, and Ormond, and Springwood, and Red Forest, and Backwater Swamp as well because imo it's pretty easy to abuse BL on those too.
---
I mean, I'm sad about BL nerf too, but changing helluva ton of maps to nerf BL indirectly instead of just nerfing BL sounds kinda like bananas to me.
---
This is going to blow your mind but I'm from the future, a future where Tru3Ta1ent thinks Wraith is the 4th best killer.
---
How are you crawling so insanely fast...?
---
Same happened to me, got hooked in the basement and flew to the sky. Got unhooked and fell down to hell https://i.imgur.com/h5KJl4o.jpg  
---
But apparantly i was just standing in the basement all the time since the killer downed me after a minute or so again.
---
If its they just got hooked sure. But if they are about to hit struggle you need to save them. Because getting to struggle on your first hook because you hung there waiting to be saved counts as your second hook so you effectively lose a hook for the game. Having 3 hooks effectively can make or break a match
---
What are you high or something? I said they both are problems. 
---
That **doesn't mean** I am comparing them. Rin needs to have a cue for her phasing phase. That fucking thing is broken.
---
boil over is one of the worst perks in the game
---
Buddy: Hey, the killer's not running after me, he's just standing there for some reason.
---
Me: Wait **WH-**
---
*EW3 THEME*

I don't know if you're serious or not, but if you are: ABSOLUTELY!

You compared teabagging to a in game that I thats inane
---
the players who supported the game early are the reason newer players have a game.
---
Ooh I want these.
---
Dike
---
Fix your broken record.
---
I already told you i didnt compared, I just stated they both are problem.
---
"yoooo which survivor can wear the pig mask!"
---
"wait"
---
lol, at this point Legion should be allowed to Park everywhere
---
And here we see people shitting themselves in attempt to attack Tru3 like dear god people shut up and stop watching one video and then jerking your own ego with all your survivors friends
---
dope
---
One word: incompetence!
---
That explain everything!
---
He moistures them with the tears of his victims.
---
&gt;the survivors being scared of legion in the sweater banner üòÇ
---
Looks much better.
---
So if you keep running you'll never go down? Yeah sure that's fair.
---
Poor Doc, I actually feel bad for him :/
---
Doesn't change the situation for freddy and bt, bt still only activates if you're in the terror radius.
---
Yes, Legion is still trash.
---
So perfect
---
That and if they start working on a generator it should deactivate too and I think an argument can be made for if they heal a health state
---
Leader is such a nice perk to use when the bloodwebs refuse to give me self-care! Lol
---
Uh, no. All you have to do is not run in for a save as your being chased. If you don't get BT applied it's because your team farmed you
---
Always respond with the "You died to a noob, what does that make you?"
---
lmao hag already had frosty eyes
---
They specifically said only dlc that came before stranger things would be on sale.
---
running DS instead of unbreakable on Bill.
---
Sounds good on paper,yes,but people can abuse bt to body block the rescuer or get to the door
---
Cause its new and moar monei for them
---
But he does it anyway to piss off the entity
---
Yeah they mixed it up with the plague.
---
This has been happening to me and my pal too
---
So yesterday I was in a 2 man SWF and I had a match against a Wraith with a Terror Radius at Red Ranks. The guy is running Distressing, Clownphobia, and Sloppy Butcher and is applying pretty much zero map pressure. He's completely blind and often walks right past people crouching in corners, and despite running an anti-heal build he never injures anyone.
---
Match ends and he complain in post-game chat about "shitty two man SWFs." We see that he's a streamer so we pull up his stream to watch him play. He played AWFULLY and there were so many times that he'd make a bad play it was actually comedic. And every time something bad would happen he'd immediately start bitching about how "toxic 2 man SWF keep telling each-other where I am and genrushing." [Or maybe it's because you walk into every pallet stun, apply zero map pressure, and don't try to injure other Survivors when you're running an anti-heal build?](http://objection.lol/objection/19292)
---
To put into perspective how little this man was doing he was running both a perk and an addon that gave you additional Deviousness Bloodpoints and he had like 4000 Deviousness by the end of the match. In addition his stream only had two viewers when we checked it out (IE us) and he was filming on a crappy Walmart webcam with a horrible Walmart microphone. Guy look like he was in the early years of high school and had the most deadpan expression while playing except for the occasional moments that he'd rage when he got pallet stunned at a really obvious safe pallet. Names all his streams "A Creative Title" as well: literally all of them. Man I wonder why no one watches you play. ü§î
---
Damn didnt know that thanks
---
Yeah but the assholes on this subreddit don‚Äôt know how to be a respectful human instead they live their life attacking people over opinions but we will never come to a day where this subbreddit isn‚Äôt filled with people who have to bitch and moan about people‚Äôs opinions at any chance they get just look at the comments prioritizing shitting on Tru3 over his opinions and then acting all high and mighty
---
This addon is beautiful and at the same time the rarest to pop in the bloodweb, same with the tar bottle for Trapper. PRAISE this addon
---
I don‚Äôt think a hook was the only thing Dwight was on
---
Claudette accepting that award is hilarious to me idk why, it's like she became the leader of some cult.
---
I can‚Äôt at the moment; but maybe sometime else? My GT is the same as my reddit name

survivor mains: killers dodge lobbies11!1!1!!11!!!1!! TOXIC!

also survivor mains: wtf why can't i dodge lobbies because i take a video game too seriously and don't wanna play with lower ranks
---
Same story. What's curious enough is that I was supposed to struggle on the hook but I didn't and it wouldn't let me die.
---
i legit just posted about this too lol. i hope its just a bug that can be fixed and not intentional. i might have missed it in the notes if it was intentional but either way it pisses me off because, like you, i dont know if im in there with a bunch of nubs
---
same, on the new map. no idea on the other ones

Yes she is. Lol after nurse nerf she is the best killer

---
Now you gotta unlock all of them for every character
---
Wheres ash?
---
I stoped using ds because 1 min is way to short, tunnelimg killers usally slug for a while. I seriussly have no idea how you down hook someone else then down the same person again and they get DS witouth it being tunneling. The surv have to be really bad or he is purpesfully getting downed to use DS wich is just a waste of time on the surv side.
---
I feel like for Mori you should have to accumulate hooks to use them, like you can kill one survivor for every 2-3 hooks, sort of like Devour Hope
---
And that makes it okay to insult and shit on him and harass him? Ok gotcha Chief
---
It's fun to meme with, but near impossible to actually stalk with.  
---
The eye is naturally drawn to him once the pants are off, ITS TOO POWERFUL. ;(
---
Yes but if the EAC wasn‚Äôt checking all game files, they would probably say there isn‚Äôt an issue. What Peanits said is that these cosmetic mods carry a risk of triggering the EAC and If that happens they are unable to undo the ban. Meaning the EAC can and at some point probably will ban somebody for cosmetic modifications eventually
---
You aren't accomplishing anything if you are running around the entire map to prevent deep wounds from going down.
---
imagine being so fucking entitled you think something you can get for free with shards should also be on sale despite being just released
---
Kate looks fucking beautiful
---
Ok cool
---
You missed in the patch notes. It was a bug and now its fixed.
---
Base torso, logo changed from pink to gold...
---
I didn‚Äôt see it could be paid with for shards! Calm your jets, I thought he was going to be AC only. :(
---
We're not getting DC penalties on Console yet. It was a mistake that they put that in the patch notes and have already removed it.
---
They‚Äôre literally pinned at the top of this sub
---
For a bit, like later today?
---
So why would Peanits warn against it saying you run the risk to trigger it?
---
Yeah but still deep wound isnt a threat anymore all you have to do is run around to either find a safe spot or a teammate so they can patch you up faster.
---
assuming just makes an ass out of you. because i dodge on both sides and could give a fuck less if a killer dodges when i play surv lol
---
Re read your comment you were clearly comparing them but let‚Äôs not forget you also started bitching about Spirit on a completely unrelated video
---
no u
---
all bhvr originals can be purchased with shards and always have been
---
Xbox always has it's charms but it does it obnoxious at times. I try to play fair and nice as possible but people will be people. I got called toxic a for looping the killer xD which I still don't understand how trying to stall and survive is toxic. What do you think of the nurse so far on PC?
---
What platform?
---
The shear amount of brainlet from this Trapper.
---
That Autodidact and Solidarity tech is real
---
wow toxic lobby dodger smh
---
You are a rodent alright. Annoying af
---
and EAC told us that they don't care about shit that doesn't affect gameplay. so far there were 0 bans for it. you can reach out to them for an unban if that ever happens.
---
Actor is not the one who decides that though
---
I didn‚Äôt know it was originals only
---
Survivors nerfed by adding one second to an already useless perk, LOL. Meanwhile adding a buff to BT.
---
Black Friday was last Friday
---
Myers is one of the most versatile killers in the game. Which is a bit annoying when you consider how many other killers are stuck with specific play styles.
---
Except, they can‚Äôt lol. BHVR has said they cannot unban you for this.
---
Take of noed for an aura reading perk like nurses or bitter murmur
---
Pantsless meyers is bae
---
Lol first time adding an exclusive to dlc and it‚Äôs absolutely lame. Wouldn‚Äôt expect anything more
---
Lol that is brutal, but given that the challenges are so ridiculously hard to complete, we all should all trust no one. I'd probably just msg them and admit you're a horrible manipulative monster who used their trust to backstab them for your own gain. Put a few cute emojis in the message, perhaps a "sry lol", and move onto the next challenge. üòà
---
(No judgement from me, I think the challenges have led to some really funny posts like this one, and I'm loving the chaos)
---
Did this in Xbox but I went ahead and bought the cells and it let me buy him anyways for some reason.
---
Was not expecting these so quickly  :D
---
Bruh they  could make it not tick down when in like 10 meters of the killer
---
Quality read.
---
Wanting to have a fun fair game against regular players instead if sweaty swf players with commodius toolboxes and a key isnt toxic
---
You can no longer jump on a generator while the killer is nearby chasing someone else before dealing with deep wounds.
---
Also makes global terror radius not halt deep wounds most notably Legion's iridescent pin.
---
Love the insults bud 
---
Also I love you using the name I picked for myself as an insult? Like I‚Äôd be offended by being called a rodent? XD
---
they did rework the bloodweb in September with the stranger things chapter. Level 50 used to only have 2 perks per web, of which you could only select 1, with the entity eating the other one. there‚Äôs now 3 at level 40 and 4 at level 50. It‚Äôs helped somewhat
---
um excuse you everything is toxic
---
why would you be able to purchase licensed content for free?
---
Agreed
---
Still its dumb I understand the mending part but all that's going to happen is survivors will run around not helping their team and legions power is even worse now.
---
I'm crying tears of joy
---
Anyone see news for ash? I guess it's coming later???
---
New chapter new bugs just happend to me
---
That's good, I always wondered how the nurse felt on console compared to PC so it's nice to know it's not just gossip that she feels alot different between the two
---
That‚Äôs exactly it. I don‚Äôt tunnel or camp, but survivors feel untouchable with Borrowed Time that they unhook in front of me. At least with Freddy I can punish it
---
thanks for the quick info!
---
Oh thats funny, waist-ed that septic. To be fair, in the heat of the moment you didn't look at the locker.
---
legion isn't even a killer anymore they're just a nuisance
---
I actually tried this a few times, but everything I heard was more insults or replies like "i wasn't playing the full strength, tryhard" etc.
---
Lmao, I don't even have to go to the zoo.
---
yea good fucking luck finding anyone on here that knows who Loleriz is
---
Yamaoka 1 has never been enjoyed by either role and now they just made a second one. Great. 
---
Literally Swamp 2.0.
---
I feel you man. I can't see anything on this shitty maps. Haven't they learned anything since the last Yamaoka map? Its dark and has too much grass its ridiculous.
---
I have a rule when I play SWF as Laurie: if I run Object of Obsession I don't tell them. At all. I just run around and act shocked when the killer shows up and ganks one of them and then laugh post-game
---
Nvm my man I got all of them on the older list
---
I don't know if it's just me, but it seems a little darker than usual.
---
No we have to go do it on the outside of the map...
---
&gt;To trigger a Protection Hit a Survivor must be within range of a "Survivor in Need" which translates to being close to an Injured Survivor.
---
Can we please just get hard numbers on this? We talking 5 meters? 10 meters? 15 meters?
---
For some stupid reason I keep on getting autohaven wreckers, so Im not getting the map
---
Never said it was.... just stating somthing about him, why get so defensive and jump to conclusions?
---
Glad I am not the only one getting this shit
---
Not an insult, just offering my condolences to your suffering ego. Do you need a hug?
---
Its unfortunate, but button mashing tends to wear down controllers, this is probably the problem and why I think there should be some kind of change (maybe holding the button)
---
Hate that they did that. Im rank 1 survivor and I dodge lobbies with rank 20's (those are quite common because of the new swf system) so that I could do challenges. Guess I'll have to get destroyed by killers now
---
"OOOOIINNKKK!" (With every hit)
---
Huntress, trapper, and spirit have no fuckin business being this damn cute. Take my upvote, lad.
---
That‚Äôs what his entire tweet was about im just telling you that because it seems like no one else on this damned reddit gets that
---
I really wouldn't mind that, would be a very interesting meta shift haha
---
Honestly I would‚Äôve pulled the trigger a long time ago if they had cross save progression. I‚Äôve been playing DBD since it was free with PS+ and I‚Äôve progressed a lot for survs and killers. I really hate the idea of having to start all over again and buy the dlc again.
---
I play Red dead 2, my A button is basically toast.
---
Alright sorry i didnt take an english major get off my back jesus
---
Yui just looked mildly inconvenienced when Oni is smashing through that wall in the first banner lmao
---
Maybe the monitor too
---
I‚Äôve got the same issue and restarting did not fix it. I don‚Äôt see the dlc in the Xbox store either.
---
I hate this sub
---
I think it might be because the posing and her face seem a little awkward? idk.
---
It showcased how god awful the matchmaking system is, which the devs probably didn‚Äôt like. I wish they‚Äôd keep it in though, it made it easy to dodge lobbies where I was matched with rank 16-20 teammates (and I‚Äôm rank 3 lmao).
---
I thought you were "Solzec" (-__-)
---
Im aware, i was just mentioning that. It's just some progress lol
---
Blood Warden buff idea.  Increase the timer to 3 minutes.
---
Button mashing is probably one of only a few occurances where I'd say playing on pc would make a noticable impact on game enjoyment, to be able to use  a macro would be HUGE
---
Patch notes: *all characters have had their eyes forced open. Don‚Äôt ask about demogorgon or nurse.*
---
Not when you‚Äôre mid pickup animation.
---
Eh id play the new survivor every time a chapter comes out if they had something unique about them. Killers are fun and exciting becasue they bring a whole new way to play the game but survivors are just reskins.
---
another yamaoka is another map that's unplayable for me because I have bad eyesight
---
Why is it not Aaron tech it's the same thing
---
He‚Äôs a better Billy, and Billy is already high tier. I think he‚Äôs going to be the 3rd-4th best killer in the game. Just my opinion

I know, I held off for months for this very reason. Honestly, I wouldn't have done it if I mained survivor. Not much difference there. But if like me you play a lot of killer as well, let me tell you it's so worth it. It's like a different game.

....Am I not supposed to use Nurse‚Äôs Calling on console?

lol people did not like this. Here‚Äôs an upvote

It is already available on the store

That is enticing. Maybe I‚Äôll make the jump and just be a killer exclusively on PC.
---
Bill bill bill bill bill bill nye the science guy
---
Yeah!! He's super cool.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to get home then!
---
I honestly don't give a shit, you can get better stuff from in-game store.
---
Dota and CS are their most profitable ones
---
When I play killer I chase flash light clickers for a little while to see how good they are. If they loop me for longer than I‚Äôd like I go pick of the weaker survivors.
---
Yeah like hour ago. Restart steam.
---
It's a shitfest though. Being hooked makes your screen pitch black and you can't see shit until you get picked up by him again and sometimes you can't struggle while he carries you.
---
Reading the official statement it seems weird that people always paraphrase to ‚Äúthere is no way you can get banned‚Äù and yet that statement kind of makes it seem like there is a way to get auto banned for it.
---
Is this what the inside of David King‚Äôs head looks like?
---
Probably to level up the new characters faster
---
Dead Hard nibbas be like:
---
Yo why am I still getting hit?
---
I think they made a good decision not releasing the 4 Event cosmetics to everyone as they were earned in game. 
---
All the others were given out for free and were never sold or available to purchase in game or by BHVR so if anyone bought them from third party sellers that‚Äôs on them.
---
That just sounds like the new prayer beads with extra steps
---
Smudge chill
---
Yup. This has to be a joke, at this point. They act as if DW not being tied to the terror radius is some sort of buff, but it does absolutely nothing. Survivors will just heal DW as soon as they're not being chased. No competent player would attempt to do gens while bleeding out.
---
I‚Äôm happy they found a workaround for the Nemesis Legion/Freddy Immunity but in Legion‚Äôs case they‚Äôre still in a rough space. Losing on-hit effects for consistency is one thing but there are just so many drawbacks to this power. 
---
The fatigue is still too long for a non-lethal power, the addons for such are still too lackluster even in the strongest combination, it doesn‚Äôt combo with any on hits, Frank‚Äôs and Stab Wounds Study are still counterproductive addons. 
---
The pins finally being functional is good and the increases to duration/vaulting is good but the power itself is still bad. 
---
I‚Äôm just gonna main Oni at this point because there‚Äôs really no reason to even use Feral Frenzy. At least with Oni I can actually have a useful and fun power that threatens people.
---
I would recommend trying the game on GamePass PC (I think the first month is $1, then it's $4 per month). The Steam version is the way to go if you were to switch for real, but at least you could try it out relatively cheap and see how you like it. Jump in a few killer matches and give it a test drive.
---
I‚Äôm happy because I wanted to do a concept art trapper outfit forever but the white mask just doesn‚Äôt look as good as the ultra rare, now that I have it I can confidently say I am looking good. üòé

---
Repair the generator in the upper level of the shrine.

Only the frost eyes,. unrelated to the pack.
---
I find myself walking towards him more often than I should, so yeah, [that's pretty true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb2JwokdvKE).
---
How about fixing the underlying issue of bad matchmaking rather than just arbitrarily removing something?
---
I would too - exactly because it gives more benefit. And that's the reason it is nerfed.
---
They see waiting a couple seconds longer as a problem but they don‚Äôt seem to care about killers dodging lobbies on platforms without dedicated servers.
---
In the store? Lol, it's an update, use the options button on the game icon and then look for updates
---
that's most of the chapters there's really no point of buying full chapters besides the first couple of licensed ones
---
That's actually hilarious looking. Nice job
---
Yeah my A button on Xbox gets smashed during struggle.  I am sure that space bars and X on PS4 get the same treatment.  It would be nice if they removed the mashing.

Yikes 20 downvotes for stating facts. Some people are just too dumb to check, unlike you

I should‚Äôve played killer when I had the chance during their Free weekends. I played survivor with one of my PC friends and the performance overall was so much better compared to my ps4. I could actually see far in the distance and quite clearly. The framerate consistency is my favorite thing about it.
---
It's always been like that tho I think Yui has one of the better ones I like the gold logo .
---
They seriously still haven't fixed Trappers Bear Traps? It's been a bug for the past 2 updates, and it's still not even in the "known issues" category despite everyone mentioning it on the forums.
---
Same :/

Oh okay then, thanks for responding

I mean considering how little rank matters in this game I don‚Äôt think lobby dodging should be a thing rn. If they made ranks harder to gain so that they were better indicators of skill, then at that point they would need to either fix matchmaking or allow lobby dodging. Source: Im a potato about to reach red rank.
---
Mhm, should obviously crouch behind the massive obstruction, break line of sight, and let her come to him.

them
---
Nope. Killers typically get shafted when it comes to the bonus DLC cosmetics, and most killers get nothing at all. I think Doctor and Ghostface are the only ones that get anything.
---
mousepad
---
Ps4 lobby
---
Thanks for the answers! One follow up question on the first point. I generally feel like the only way I will catch up on most survivors is to have them deplete their pallet count. Is that a pretty normal mindset to have? I usually leave them alone after they stun me unless they just happen to have not run at all.
---
What a story
---
This is true af why would u even take your fresh install friends to red rank...
---
the update and getting the DLC are two separate things
---
Lol. Love the art style, capital work
---
All the exclusives starting with the curtain call chapter have been like that
---
I love new_chapter.png meme.
---
That‚Äôs so strange. Like I‚Äôve restarted my PC as well but still no update. Maybe if it was that bad they took it offline?
---
The Doctor: kaaa.... me..... haaaa.... me.... *giggle* HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Why would they? People still seem to buy tons of Legion cosmetics (given how frequently they release them. They wouldnt if nobody bought them. After Halloween theyll also get new ones for Winter), even if nobody seems to play them.
---
Outfits are spoilers lol?
---
Who is the voice actress for the new survivor? How does she sound?
---
Tell that to Cloud and Zack. Their swords were gigantic compared to that dagger.
---
To some people
---
Rly doubt it!! That would be op as hell but who knows
---
Sometimes it's just nice to do everything I can to help my teammate succeed. It's not like I do it every time slugging occurs or anything, plus I've been playing this game long enough that I basically have what I want on it and losing one match's worth of BP isn't going to set me back at all.
---
Think it was referring to endgame killer saying Claudette is toxic not the Claudette actually being toxic
---
Do you know what "GeForce now" is?
---
In a match last night I had the gates spawn on the same wall not too far from each other, and the hatch spawned right next to one of the gates. I felt bad for that group of survivors.
---
how else do you think SWF should be managed? low ranks are going to play with high rank friends sometimes
---
BHVR can't unban you when EAC bans you
---
EAC can.
---
Nah, it‚Äôs just rare to see. I have it and I can tell as I approach most people they aren‚Äôt even thinking about the possibility when I approach them while healing.
---
I think it stacked 2x Max during the ptb

Legion only exist to buff BT repeatedly.

It‚Äôs because the preschool takes up a huge portion of the map and landmarks only get one hatch spawn. Maybe they could add another spawn point just under the hole in the floor but I argue that it wouldn‚Äôt change much in practice.
---
JESUS THEY ADDED LEADER FACE TO THE SWITCH VERSION, IM SO FUCKING HAPPY. BBQ HERE I COME
---
Ever since the store was implemented you don't really get the chapter exclusives that we used to have.
---
Before we used to have whole outfits as exclusives for that chapter now not so much.
---
Feng's bun cardigan and tracksuit for example
---
Yea I know, it was in the ptb but not in the live version now
---
Uh... I wasn't aware you could sacrifice survivors as a survivor
---
If people don't care about the sentimental value then they shouldn't complain since there are a bunch of other cosmetics available. If they do then they understand why giving them away would be stupid.

If your using it for wiggle in lasso etc you can change it to a hold in settings.
---
**LAUGHS IN HILLBILLY**
---
Yes this is how swf matchmaking works
---
because no one cares if you upvote something and you making a reply saying that you upvoted it serves nothing to no one. It‚Äôs just an attempt to  make you feel good about yourself because you did something nice, but it‚Äôs ultimately useless. it‚Äôs like those people who would go out and specifically look for minorities and be nice to them because they want to feel like they‚Äôre good people when in reality they‚Äôre more selfish than the rest of us.
---
and the idea of telling someone what you upvoted something is stupid. that‚Äôs what the upvoted are there for, to tell someone that you liked it without having to make a reply telling them that.
---
This gave me a good chuckle. Noice.
---
I don't see the problem here
---
Probably SWF.
---
Honestly just make BT it's own thing again without deep wounds. It worked just fine.
---
The rank 15 was better than the ranks 5, that's nice
---
That Jane is too adorable! If I were on Xbox I would be using that all over the place! üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
---
Fair points, no hard feelings bro.
---
Yeah, matchmaking is tragic. I do PIP with randoms, but then the game isn't enjoyable at all. If i wanted the grind, i'd play NBA2k lol. But i think they're gonna rework the rankings within next couple patches.   
---
BHVR released kill ratios, average is nearly 70% red ranks (50% being 2kills). I believe that is a bit too high. All other ranks were hovering 55-60%. That used to be red ranks in May. Something to think about before saying "survivors have the edge" (Looking at Tru3 with this statement).  
---
I haven't reached Dedicated servers yet as im Xbox One, so cannot really comment on that.
---
BTW i run, inner strength, Iron Will, Spine Chill and Lithe. I gotta say, im surprised how good this combo works. Meta perks are boring and so uninteresting to play with, and against for that matter. I hate them, but i see the reason they are being run by people.
---
They have been maintaining the same pace for nearly two years ever since the clown‚Äôs release and have a publicized roadmap detailing this trend.
---
Maybe farming XP which is awarded by time in trial and is used to finish rift... wouldn't be surprised if someone set up a macro to just keep joining matches and afk'd from the game completly.
---
Whilst that is true, there's also not much reason to not mend in that situation and the time it takes to mend has gone down. You can safely sprint to safety while the legion runs off somewhere else, mend and then work on the gen you just ran to.
---
I miss the slugging. There's a half dozen survivor perks that are slugging based, and only 1 (Unbreakable) ever gets used. Maybe would have made their use a little more justified.
---
At least they get more blight outfits which are way better imo
---
Pc or Xbox or both? :S (asking)
---
*‚ÄùYou better not shout, You better not cry, gonna post Halloween stuff during Christmas time!‚Äù*
---
By nerfing legion's frenzy/deep wound they've buffed Borrowed Time, GG BHVR.
---
No doubt, it's so much better. Full disclosure though, the wait times for killer are much worse on PC, while survivor wait times are better. But it can be brutal for killer, like 20-30 minutes brutal...

Context: Playing on Yamaoka‚Äôs Estate with the perks break out, bond, self care and mettle. Got downed in Yamaoka‚Äôs house with the basement by the demogorgon who picked me up. Couldnt wiggle because the indicator didn‚Äôt show up and the screen then shifted to the skybox and a model of my character falling (Dwight). Did not go away when hooked again but to other players i appeared normal.

Oh absolutely. If they just let you stay on the hook for an entire phase, they are just shitty teammates.

Uh.

The video speed is increased, watch the egc timer, it doesn't go down that quick if someone is downed.

##The Legion (2.00)
---
###Primary Weapon: Knife
---
###Power: We are One
---
The Legion can see all lockers within **56 meters** by **holding down the Power button**. While hovering their reticle over a highlighted locker, they can send another Legion member to it by **tapping the Attack button**. Up to **3** lockers can be occupied at a time. With the Power button held, The Legion can also switch to a different member by **holding down the Attack button** while hovering their reticle over an occupied locker. Upon switching characters, the previous Killer uses a smoke bomb to cover their tracks. The Legion must wait **60 seconds** before being able to change characters again. If a Survivor attempts to open a locker with a Legion member inside:
---
- They're attacked, putting them into the Injured state.
---
- They're afflicted with the **Deep Wound** status effect.
---
- Their location is revealed to the **active Killer**
---
- The Legion member who attacked them drops a smoke bomb, and vanishes.
---
A Survivor can ensure a locker is safe by standing near it and listening for breathing that occurs every **7 seconds** when a locker is occupied by The Legion.
---
###Power: Feral Frenzy
---
The Legion has a **power gauge** that builds up over time. Once the gauge is full, Feral Frenzy can be activated by **tapping the Actions button**, causing the power gauge to drain over **12 seconds**. While Feral Frenzy is **active:**
---
- The Legion is granted a **10%** speed boost.
---
- The Legion can't put Survivors into the Dying state.
---
- The Legion can quickly vault over obstacles and pallets.
---
- The Legion's Terror Radius is increased by **12 meters**.
---
Striking a Survivor while Feral Frenzy is active applies the **Mangled** status effect. Striking the same Survivor twice results in an **extended recovery cooldown**, and ends the power. **Feral Frenzy** can be activated every **20 seconds**.
---
###Perks
---
_Perks remain the same, except Iron Maiden is replaced with Hex: Anarchy._
---
**Hex: Anarchy**
---
You have cursed Survivors with a totem that punishes cooperation. If two or more Survivors are repairing a generator or healing another Survivor, their progress is slowed by **10/20/30%**. This effect is disabled if the Hex: Anarchy totem is cleansed.
---
She may have also been trying to get maximum "unbroken" emblem points for escaping healthy.
---
So ace, Jeff, Quentin are all Dwights too?
---
This is cute, and I hate to be that guy, but I‚Äôm assuming they all do close their eyes (even the doctor somehow), that‚Äôs why you see their eyelids and  blood vessels when you start to gain your vision back instead of permanent darkness. Those lights are no joke. Don‚Äôt look at the sun. Eyelids are pretty thin and weren‚Äôt designed to block bright light (that‚Äôs why people cover themselves with hats or their arms or sunglasses etc to sleep during the day outside/with the lights on).
---
However, technically, Legion might be the only ones able to simply close their eyes because most of their masks (except Joey‚Äôs I think) are designed like Inuit snow goggles because of their slits (which traditionally are meant to prevent snow blindness, which is from the reflection of the sun on snow a highly reflective substance) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_goggles
---
And actually this is only slightly correct, the legion masks are actually poorly designed and don‚Äôt have slits like in panel two but two tiny holes that are about iris sized, oh well, enjoy that info about eyelids and olde timey ski masks if you wish.
---
Oh and without near-constant lubrication, Doc‚Äôs eyes will eventually dissolve/desiccate from being exposed to the air constantly like that.
---
What you talking about man? All we do is restart steam and it in the DBF store page. It's 6.99 in freedom units.

---
Injured or dying?
---
It's a weird feeling because I know some people that spent 500/600$ to get those exclusives and now we all have them for free...
---
To be fair, they went back on their word when they said these exclusives would be free originally. The former exclusive donkey jacket (which we all get) is pretty nice, you should try it out.
---
You should check Bill and make sure you have his teachables and he‚Äôs level 40.
---
For the first one, injured
---
It wasn't just that the wiggle bar disappeared, I couldn't do anything while being carried. It happened right after the update so I'm gonna assume it's a bug??
---
She don't even look close to the same ignorant af .
---
I think there are a lot of similarities between all survivors if you look at it like that. There‚Äôs the ones from rich families, ones that ran away, ones that are smart, ones that chose a different lifestyle then other intended for them, etc.
---
Ah ok, I would‚Äôve been surprised if they were actually trying to promote slugging lmao
---
Yes, it's a bug. Happened to me earlier as well.
---
Why haven't you added the skyrim meme yet?
---
He wasn‚Äôt a baby killer, he knew what he was doing
---
I had this happen just now. Got put in the basement first hook and screen went crazy, had to sit and wait out both phases  (I didn't even hit x to struggle but it still kept me there) and then I died. I hope this gets more traction.
---
Since when was DW ever supposed to be a threat of going down? It's a form of game slowdown, as a perfectly healthy survivor can be hit once by a sprinting killer who can quickly vault anything and then have to heal twice to get healthy again. In addition, the sprinting killer who gets one hit will also get an instant wall hack as to where other nearby survivors are hiding. Basically, it allows the killer to dramatically slowdown the game by forcing multiple survivors to have to heal multiple times. 
---
I really don't know how you're playing Legion if you think people should be going down to DW?
---
This exact thing has been happening to me. I dont know what the cause of it could be because it happened in multiple games, whether It was in the basement or somewhere else, strangely enough I haven‚Äôt been able to wiggle every time it‚Äôs happened so far, I don‚Äôt even struggle during 2nd phase. The game just kind of paralyzes me after my first hook until I‚Äôm dead
---
It's been a bug for a while. It doesn't happen often and I'm not entirely sure what causes it or if it's just random but it prevents you from wiggling and self-caring.
---
quality over quantity
---
Yeah I know but I was like ‚ÄúIs that a perk? I want that perk...‚Äù

I‚Äôm that guy you can‚Äôt find crawling through the grass haha.

Spirit looks like she's bald
---
Happening to me right now on Autohaven in the basement. Got unhooked and healed too, but I can't do anything.
---
This is exactly what happened to me about three minutes ago. I'm seeing a lot of threads on it already. Hope it gets looked at.
---
How tf was this a long shot? 20 meters at best, also, you saw his aura.

It doesn't stack. Devs confirmed it.

That wasnt my point I just personally dont wanna see the little kids invade this game as well
---
BILL'S SWEATER IS FREE!
---
He's discount Billy now. Yay balance
---
There is also a bug were you cant wiggle on the killer's grasp, the bar won't even show up, PS4 btw
---
I didn't know they changed him like that and got him + some cosmetics.... Oooooooof. He seems worse. Much worse
---
It‚Äôs an exclusive, devs have given all of them out for free to get rid of the exclusive black market.
---
Never corner yourself , specially vs instadown killer. And bobyblocking it's used a lot from both killers bad survivors.
---
Killer do it to block windows/pallets and survivors to protect a teammate
---
**Nerf**: They removed the ability to quickly turn around during an attack (was mostly used after a charge), now breaking pallets with your power takes longer, the attack hitbox is thinner, you get stunned for 1 second after a charge (was 0.5 seconds), downing a survivor with the power active reduces your power bar a little, your passive power gain stops at 98% (so you need to collect a single blood orb to activate it).
---
**Buff**: He no longer loses power bar after picking up a survivor, but the power still shuts off.
---
 **Neather Buff or Nerf**: They rebalanced a little how he gets blood orbs.
---
In my opinion this makes him a lot weaker, but we will see after people figure out how to play him or give up trying.
---
Make it happen bhvr!

I love the new chapterd the queue times of survs go from twenty minutes to two

it's a fun game. I'm glad you decided to get it. just be wary, the community can be toxic at times because the rainbow six community came to this one quite some time ago. the reddit dbd community isn't terrible though. you should learn the basics by playing the tutorial! I'm sure you'll enjoy the game lol
---
They released all the formerly rare cosmetics on console and PC because console people never had access to the codes. And people are selling these cosmetic codes for ridiculous prices and scamming people.
---
Never assume, i was not saying that my point about him means he in anyway deserves the attacks he recieves... i was mearly posting my observation on truetalent.
---
Yeah? So what?
---
Thanks for your motivating answer :-) what I also really didnt like was that (i think) this killer had no Terror radius while invisible, I think theres a perk to avoid this, do u know where i can get it?
---
I'd much rather the Event stuff (which I've personally missed out on due to other commitments) be available in the Store, so at least then if you REALLY want them you have to pay for them.
---
Dude I think you're kinda contradicting yourself. Why would you need only stagger effect if it isn't the very thing that's busted on such maps? Many people me included already run BL with other Exhaustion perk combined simply because of the stagger effect. Dead Hard and then proceed to looping the dropdown spot for example.
---
I don't specifically say BL was too much busted, I personally didn't have too much issues with it. I didn't even have too much issues with Haddonfield. But I get the reasoning behind the nerf and in the end stagger effect was specifically the reason people hated BL on some maps for.
---
Still, I wished stagger effect to be nerfed not completely removed. Maybe they want to re-introduce it with a separate perk in the future who knows.
---
I found reg spirit map dark as hell even though nobody brought fog addons
---
yeah, too dark man.
---
Ok thanks

Level 392 rank 19 killer?

---
It's not about the bodyblocking. It's cause even a blind person can find people using spirit by bumping into survivors. How skillfull right? Phase into nothingness and by luck just hit a survivor.
---
Now she can't anymore, but it is now that we're going to distinguish good from bad spirit players

Yes! Sometimes that happens. I know because I might have been that nurse.
---
Ok so no wall bump stun, thank the fucking lord. I think some of these changes are fair. Pallet breaks in PTB were way too fast and his recovery after dash was non-existent so those changes are fine. 
---
The one that upsets me the most however is the flick change. They made his skill ceiling way shorter and neutered his dash heavily with this change. This is the one thing I want to be reverted.

It really is. Not a big fan of the original spirit map either

---
Pallet destruction is a pretty essential way to catch survivors later on. If youre chasing someone that drops them pretty frequently, it is worth chasing them for a little bit and just destroying a decent amount. 
---
Generally doing this creates "dead zones" where you can chase a survivor and basically guarantee them going down since they have nothing to loop around.
---
i dont honestly understand why people like this skin his standard skin looks so much better
---
You can still flick it‚Äôs just not absurd
---
Running DS and then disconnecting when killer slugs you.
---
It that a galactic infinity gauntlet for oni
---
It would only work that way if one side has significantly more percentage of bans. If both sides have similar percent reductions in players queuing then matchmaking should be the same for players who aren't getting bans, while having less quitting in those games. In a perfect world people will actually avoid quitting now and truly toxic people just ban themselves out

Same. Id take a corn map before either of those.

Thinking about it, I wish I could understand BHVRs idea of exclusivity. They want to keep certain event items exclusive, but they choose the least worked on one and release the other amazing ones into the store. The BP items, which usually are exclusive in other games, are going to the store 6 months after it ends. 
---
The steam code items are also releasing for free too, even after people bought it off the black market, because they dont want exclusivity.
---
Yet, the halloween events have 0 exclusives, and are able to be bought whenever? Its really confusing.
---
Also, I didnt know theyd be releasing another Donky Jacket for David, thanks for the heads up!
---
It really depends on where the person is addressed, of course. In Japan, when saying a full name, it's always last name first. But in the west one would just address them first name first, which is what they went for here, probably.

Focusing on improving it or scratching it as a whole is still focusing.

Well if you charge into a wall what do you expect to happen, you slam into it for a second or two and then you keep going after that.
---
You already couldn't.
---
im not sure what this dude is talking about, there is no stun for hitting walls.
---
No....
---
Lettme guess you think gen rushing (aka the survivors single objective) is a bad thing?
---
It‚Äôs been awhile I can‚Äôt remember all the perks, this was like 4+ years ago at least. 
---
If I remember correctly NOED was one but essentially it was like playing against Myers. 
---
Except Myers hadn‚Äôt been released yet.
---
You‚Äôd be playing the whole match and everyone would be like ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the killer?‚Äù Then everyone just starts dying.
---
Please for the love of god fix the basement bug
---
Gens will always get done fastest in the early game when no survivors are injured, hooked, or being chased.  Once someone is hooked most groups will slow down a lot as they switch from doing gens to saving each other. Don't sweat losing 2-3 gens early on. As long as you're not getting stuck in super long chases you'll do well most of the time.
---
Pretty sure we haven't gotten them yet
---
This just happened to me
---
thank you
---
I wish there was a perk that was just the stagger reduction without the speed boost. Idk you guys let me know what you think but I'd run it
---
If someone doesn‚Äôt want you to heal them, maybe do something more productive and less of a waste of time than chasing them?
---
Repeated DC offenders should only be matched with the same kind, I think other games do that. This way MM is not hurt, but they get a taste of their own medicine.
---
If the screen went black instead of white it woulda been perfect!
---
This happened in the new place so it must be a glitch that came with it. I was like this the entire rest of the match even after being unhooked and hooked again.
---
He is full of shit.  He simply waits for you to stop typing, disregards whatever you said, and simply types his next thought.  I've seen it in his chats.  It's like he's just waiting for his turn to speak again but any words you say to him are put in a vacuum and ignored.  I was a massive True fan for years.  But I unsubscribed from his channel a couple months back because he has just become way too full of himself.  He's arrogant beyond belief and thinks he's always right.  And he does complain way too much to the point where it just annoys you watching the man.
---
Screenshot attached to it is all wrong somehow but I got it and I'm happy! Onii-Chan is a lot of fun.
---
Wrong, if you‚Äôre a good looper and Legion wants to tunnel you it‚Äôs hard because you would be bleeding out now as long as you‚Äôre sprinting you won‚Äôt.
---
Big nerf to Legion‚Äôs pressure.
---
Did they just change this or something? Idk how i feel bout this feature tbh. I know it sucks when i play with my friends who are low ranks &amp; i'm a purple rank. Get the other high rankers messaging my low rank friends telling them to "leave the lobby" lol kinda fucked up. Like let the low ranks play you might be surprised lol. Honestly i just get happy to even load into a lobby cause sometimes it takes awhile which i hate.
---
no
---
The DLC did release today so you were right
---
I was saying as in both sides perspective , me and my swf tried 4 commodious with the fast addons and we were against a hilly billy , we won in 8 mins while the billy got 5 hooks

A particularly nasty add on would be like Freddy, where all active portals spew when the Demogorgon moves, so you can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs the one your at.

Scratch that. He's discount Bubba.

How does this have anything to do with dbd
---
So no more passive static charge? I guess it depends on madness increase, but it looks like a nerf.
---
No. Two different things entirely. Especially with DS rewarding you for ‚Äúnot playing well enough.‚Äù The killer is made to eventually be able to catch a survivor after long enough, hence why bloodlust occurs and windows get blocked.
---
Just had a similar thing with pig xD
---
I've seen him clickbait title videos "Countering Spirit" and you watch and see a player that whiffs on EVERY phase, manages to lose a survivor WITHOUT Iron Will, AND procs a NOED down with 4 survivors up at the endgame.  Yeah man, ummm that's a bad Spirit.
---
Means nothing if you are hosting someone not in the same country.
---
Ah ok this has to be it then. Thanks!
---
Congratulations
---
Timing and practise is the key. You'll get used to the aiming after trying a few times. The best time to try for the flashlight save is when they pick up a survivor.
---
6v2 mode when
---
*that wasn't very cash money of you*
---
I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs waaayyy too early to know if he‚Äôs garbage or not. I‚Äôve played three games and he‚Äôs very hard to use at the moment.  I can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs a ‚Äúme‚Äù thing, or if what I‚Äôm trying to pull of won‚Äôt be possible, ever.
---
Yo is that meg in the last picture with the leather/fur looking jacket? Looks like she has a Kate biker hair cut, or is that someone else?
---
i can‚Äôt get over that Ghostface just backing away in pure fear
---
If they are going to remove Treatment mode its gonna be a Blast! (ba-dum-tss)
---
Seriously, this stance switch to be able use your power is very bad design. As Doc main I've used to it, but in current state of game it is a huge hinderance. Removing stance dance, adding TR-wide attack, keep his stance from Treatment mode as default gonna be such a great changes. Beeing able to attack after shock without changing stance is a huge step in right direction.
---
Problem is you're playing on a console. PC master race
---
A good killer can dodge most flashlight blinds without losing you. There are some exceptions to upgraded flashlights. The best trick is to hit them when they‚Äôre stuck in an animation. Picking up a survivor, breaking a pallet, etc. these are set movements that force the camera to be in a specific place. Keep practicing and you‚Äôll figure out the timing. Good luck.
---
looks like someone leaked doctor changes early rip
---
even if it were? would it be my fault? No, it's the matchmaking fault
---
Nice dude!
---
Devs probably got the aproval to make the cosmetic, but didn't finish the art banner on time to be approved
---
if oni is discount bubba he must be the cooler bubba then
---
Unfortunately I need the one where they are already carrying a survivor.
---
The devs man....
---
They are the real MVPs
---
If you are playing swf and they are going down tell them to run somewhere open and be near them while they are being chased but try not be seen. Also add double battery to your flashlight so you can keep trying.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with them?
---
There should be just 3 gens. The killer really didn't chase anyone ?
---
And yeah, the people who say Discordance stop gen rushing are stupid or don't understand the core mechanics.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
I do like how you seemed fine with it you realized you fucked up
---
I finished the challenge thanks to your advice friend, I had to make a great sacrifice but it is done, thank you.
---
I think with all the stealth killers available it‚Äôs nice to see the exact opposite charging around the map. Glad you‚Äôre enjoying it! My gf is currently playing against him on Rotten Fields with a Yui gang as I type this and he seems terrifying.
---
I may be mistaken, but I've seen devs with modded perk icons, so this should be safe, I think.
---
He's losing his power after picking up surv and has to recharge to 100%, He now only doesn't lose like 50% of his blood progress after pickup.
---
He facecamped because he got outplayed, this was red/purple ranks
---
This is one of the most cringe things I‚Äôve seen on this subreddit, and there‚Äôs a lot of cringe on here
---
BILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HIS SWEATER IS FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
He‚Äôs got a steep learning curve for sure but I‚Äôm having the most fun with him, even more so than my huntress. Only got him to level 16 right now but I haven‚Äôt lost a match yet. Haddonfield though is a nightmare as always, I‚Äôm glad that if you pick up a survivor while in his rage mode he doesn‚Äôt lose all of his gauge and he seems to have a very quick walking speed as well.
---
The more perks I get for him I‚Äôll mess around with him more, but he‚Äôs quickly turning into a new main for me.
---
Unfortunately people will just Suicide instead. People don't want to be forced to play a game they getting griefed in by other survivors.
---
You rooted for The Devil‚Äôs Rejects too, didn‚Äôt you?
---
Rip Balanced Landing, time to ditch that...
---
Damn I wish the screen went black instead of white!
---
Then it might be a glitch that came with the update as a whole if it happens in other maps.
---
Even though most of the Onis I go against as Yui don't seem to understand how to use his power, i've gotta say, he's a ton of fun to play as!
---
they are random on most maps, but on badham they spawn in the basement a good chunk of the time. that‚Äôs the only one that‚Äôs reasonably consistent I think.
---
You could if someone else blocked the killer from breaking the pallet
---
Too big, too thick, too heavy, and too rough, it was more like a large hunk of iron
---
Yeah it‚Äôs sanctum, the new map.
---
*she
---
The chases are great. It‚Äôs nice being caught off guard and feeling a lil scared again. Lol Loving his chase music and unique terror radius (although I am still getting used to estimating how much shit I am in based on his music. I always think he is further away then he actually is.) Downside? Oni in the wrong hands is a tunnel machine. 2 DC‚Äôs out of 5 games because Oni was on them like stank on my ex and wouldn‚Äôt let them go for all the borrowed time in the world. Blood orbs make him a blood hound.
---
Me with second wind and then they decided to self heal in front of me before actually letting me heal them
---
^ This
---
Fuckers on the internet selling items for up to $1000 dollars. Hopefully we keep this a bi-annual thing so that future event and dlc cosmetics aren‚Äôt worth as much as a used car.
---
This seems to be way more widespread than I thought....
---
It's only true on certain maps. Even then,  om those certain maps it doesn't just spawn in those places,  but it usually spawns in that area. On inside maps (The Game,  Lab, and Lerys),  hatch only spawns on the bottom floor. On Haddonfield,  it usually spawns on the streets. On Preschool,  it usually spawns on the streets or in the preschool basement.
---
Its not a nerf if they said it was broken and not supposed to work this way ( flick and insta pallet break )
---
Did you record the whole match?
---
Because his play says he is either new to Trapper or he is a green rank Killer.

Because of lobby times I have only gotten to play him in 2 matches today but great googly moogly demon rushing around the map is a blast.
---
deep wounds didnt do anything anyway. honestly dont see how this is such a huge nerf to legion. survivors cant do gens, cant heal, cant cleanse, search chests without mending first. legion still wastes survivors time with the mending.
---
There was counterplay. Nemesis only triggers on Blinding or Pallet Stunning the killer. Don't blind Legions and drop Pallets earlier so you wouldn't stun. Look! Counterplay. 
---
Beast of Prey needed counterplay added to it, because it was a guaranteed down in 27 seconds after the stab. 
---
But to nerf Legion into the ground over multiple patches and then completely negate the one benefit they were getting is a bit extreme.
---
Damn my poor peripheral vision and lack of awareness in my surrounding headass
---
He recieved a rework a couple months back (after waiting a long time for it) you fall asleep passivley over 1 minute if you're asleep then you get the oblivious status affect so you dont hear his terror radius but instead his lullaby, freddy now can hit you straight away and puts you into sleep, he can also teleport to generators and place dream snares down which lowers your speed and he has an add on that can change dream snares to dream pallets.
---
fuck does that mean?
---
they loud af tho
---
exploit nemesis to its fullest potential
---
Imagine complaining about the devs supporting the game you play with new content lmao
---
These really are so amazing. There's something about your art style that is just  perfect, especially given the juxtaposition of the horror theme with these cute Lil dudes :3
---
Paging u/HappyNorskChinchilla...
---
Let the rampant speculation begin! Being able to Exhaust survivors is pretty powerful, I'll be interested to see if reversed skill checks are a good replacement.
---
g-g-get me out here
---
Thanks for the tip
---
Watch other people play. Puupers and otzdarva are both good. 
---
But generally it's gonna be trial and error. 
---
You'll have ok games when you start playing killer until you find a killer that fits how you play.
---
Survivor just takes time to learn but it helps watching how other people distract the killer if you are unsure how
---
Was this after getting hooked in the basement? Happened to me twice so far.
---
Does that mean Freddy's perks are unavailable or are they global perks now
---
Hmmmm...
---
r/amitheasshole
---
do u know what community ur talking to lmao
---
Honestly it's just practice, you can watch some youtubers like fungoose, otzdarva, or ohtofu to help you learn basic looping on both sides and how to play certain map tiles. Aside from that you just gotta take your lumps and learn from experience.
---
Yep it seems to be pretty common cause another person in the same game got the same bug
---
You're a fucking 4Head
---
How does it do anything less than before? You still have to mend before working on objectives.
---
I leveled my Laurie and Bill for this reason; it's like having a 5th perk
---
I'm gonna play survivor and try to record that. I'm curious.
---
I am bad listener too ;-;
---
T-bagging and running known infinites is toxic. So is ganging up on the Killer to make it impossible to keep a Survivor hooked.
---
never mind that got fixed
---
When funny things started to happen. I was the last one alive and the killer downed me next to the hatch. The killer went over the ledge instead of picking me up so I got to escape. Funniest moment ever.
---
Ohhh can‚Äôt wait for this new update!
---
I‚Äôm saying that I try to play the game, but it forces me to dc.
---
Hell yes! Give them time. üôè
---
it‚Äôs like as loud as the terror radius when ur close to killer you should be fun
---
Will you be penalized? Who knows
---
Im concerned if it counts me as disconnecting if I need to close while the game is loading due to the infinite load screen which still hasnt been fixed. Its not as frequent but I started this game in Summer 2018, a year and a half on and it still exists.
---
You can‚Äôt exploit nemesis. Deep Wounds is Paused if you‚Äôre sprinting, regardless of the killer‚Äôs terror radius.
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt teabag me or my ancestor ever again.‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm not saying I ONLY need the stagger reduction I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs busted to have both the sprint and stagger reduction but it would‚Äôve made more sense imo to only leave the stagger since now it‚Äôs pretty shit without it and removing the sprint wouldve been an understandable nerf without making it almost entirely useless
---
Ok hop out? You get hit by a 1 shot?
---
I wonder if this happens for PC only or Console too. Haven't played yet. Gonna play on my switch rn tho cause my game is updating for my ps4
---
So buying just the cloak is more accurate to the movie, the mask was more like the original non buyable one in the movie and the original knife was the one in the movie bc the buyable one is seraded lol
---
Idk but I said it out loud and my laptop just started floating
---
Alright well thanks for the tip
---
It‚Äôs random but there are locations on certain maps where the hatch spawn in most common
---
Haddonfield : The street
---
Preschool: The boiler room
---
Cornfield maps: The excavators 
---
Every other map: The killer shack (I‚Äôve seen this one quite a lot and is usually the first place I look)
---
They made a massive rework of Freddy during the 3 year dbd anniversary which entirely changed his power.
---
Prior to his rework he was considered the weakest killer in the game with good reason
---
First big change is that they massively overhauled the dream world mechanic.
---
- Freddy can now interact with survivors regardless of there dream state. Awake survivors can only see him from 32 meters away. He also has a normal T.R while survivors are awake
---
- The dream world now has a timer of 60 seconds. Survivors passivley fall to sleep over 60 seconds. They can also be put to sleep immediately by Freddy by being hit by him.
---
- Survivors can wake up through - All failed skill checks, Intractable clocks found throughout the map which gives an extra 30 seconds before the 60 second dream timer starts again &amp; the survivor Wake up action which takes longer every time its done to you. 
---
- When a survivor enters the dream world, they hear the classic dbd Freddy lullaby meaning its difficult to discern distance with Freddy. It also applies the Oblivious status effect meaning T.R based perks no longer work. Perks such as BT.
---
- Freddy power allows him to place Blood pools which can only be activated by a sleeping survivor.
---
- If a survivor runs over a blood pool, they are slowed by 15% for a few seconds and cannot fast vault. They also scream while activating it.
---
- Freddys blood pools can be placed freely without requiring to slow down
---
- Freddy also has the ability to teleport to generators. By looking at an unfinished gen, he can initiate a timer of around 5 seconds where he will teleport to the gen he is facing. This is his main power and requires time to charge.
---
- Freddy has an add-on which converts his dream snares into dream pallets. 
---
- Dream pallets are manually placed by Freddy in areas where pallets are either destroyed or would normally spawn. 
---
- Only survivors in the dream world can interact with the dream pallets. Throwing a dream pallet down results in it exploding in blood and doing nothing.
---
Seriously, why would you not mention what the problem is?
---
It worked that way prior to an update, so it's a nerf.
---
It just happened to me
---
I was in a blank void
---
And I was struggling without even pressing any buttons
---
https://m.imgur.com/r/aww/Gv7zPOB
---
There was a post on the forums talking about this and I just went there to mention this post and it has been erased for some reason haha. Maybe they're trying to cover up this leak or something.
---
see the key part tho is avoiding the situation where you need the hatch breh
---
Read the patchnote
---
If your internet connection or PC is crashing on a consistent basis maybe you shouldn‚Äôt play an online multiplayer game ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
it took me a while because i didn't care for the game for a while. at 50ish hours probably i started watching dbd youtubers/ twitch streamers and simply watching them and seeing tutorials by them made me better. playing both sides helps too because you will see what survivors do wrong or right. killer is difficult at first and when you get into rank 13ish you'll see survivors looping and chases get really hard. i recommend watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ) to help you with looping (though you likely won't see many survivors try to loop for a while.) if you want to learn to loop as a survivor, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPr_bQdVkj0) will help you out.
---
tldr; watch yt tutorials, watch yters in general, keep trying to play killer and get better at it to get a better understanding of the game.
---
Ancestor + Incest = Ancest
---
From the leaks.
---
&gt; Deep Wound timer will no longer go down when Sprinting or while Mending. Deep Wound is no longer connected with the Killers terror radius. 
---
People were claiming the old legion is back. In PTB, you can just equip Beast of Prey and/or Nemesis. Once you are undetectable/survivor is oblivious, you just die to the timer even though Legion is right behind your ass.
---
Now with the change, terror radius doesnt affect the timer and therefore, the old legion is once again dead.

It was. You had to bring a Mori basically every match because of it but on console not alot of people knew so it wasn't that bad

It acts like legion‚Äôs iridescent button addon, as soon as you phase, the sound affects the entire map, whether they‚Äôre 32m away or 82m away.

---
You can wear charms on the survivors and hooks.
---
No, it is normally heard only if Spirit is in close proximity.
---
Now everyone hears it.
---
It wasn't that good before, and now it is even worse.
---
Your argument of "didn't do anything" is amplified when it is now unconditionally worse then was before (cant even get STBFL stacks anymore).
---
This is a huge nerf to an already bad killer. They need to rework Legion completely. Acting like it's not a big deal that Legion has been so horribly nerfed helps literally no one
---
Saturating it with low effort garbage
---
We have rift quests to do... we don't need a new killer for a while. We didn't even need GF
---
That's literally what I experienced as well. Like wtf do NA players really suck that Bad compared to EU?! xD
---
it's global sound cue now, normally with spirit you can hear the sound emission when she starts if you're out of her terror radius when shes moving closer to you.
---
now it's a global sound cue so if you're on the other side of the map youll have no idea if shes coming towards you or is nowhere near you
---
What the fuck even is that weapon, it looks like its about to blast off and try to blow up the deathstar
---
Seems to be official changes. Similar to how the leak of GF and Ash perks. 
---
New feature of Static Shock and Static Blast with Static Blast having a cool down. Seems to be an entire overhaul regarding his treatment mode.
---
you guys are way louder than you think you are
---
Where does it say about the DC changes?  Am i being blind i thought they were suppose to go live today.

Survivors don't need pallets anyways with current gen speeds.

There's plenty of PERKS that would count your standing stillness. You've mention nothing of the perks the Oni had???

It's available when you log in meaning no need to purchase it or anything

nah not really. maybe instead of hiding ranks to hide how broken matchmaking is they just removed ranks completely id be a little less livid with them. :shrug:

That's actually a cool idea! Unfortunately redbubble doesn't have that option :(

No I already got spoiled long ago when ptb came out
---
Sent my good sir
---
Legion is bae plague is neh
---
 [d/c]
---
Freelc
---
They changed the interval to 3 seconds in the patch today :D
---
Less mend time, no stacking or stbfl, and now you can just keep running the edge of the map until you're safe.
---
All this power does now is give survivors a tickle and a free speed boost to go heal far away from the killer. Legion still has no way to end chases effectively and his detection power is only useful in tickle mode.
---
Mending is barely an inconvenience, it makes leatherface seem good by comparison
---
Definitely a fair change. People can theoretically never have to mend if they just keep running around, but honestly, I'd love it if survivors wasted that much time.
---
too much work for them

Oni is a pure unit his power shreds survivors and it is easy to get it charged 10/10 one of the best killers in game
---
-Breaths in- BILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL'S!
---
I'm sure they are working on it! But yeah the matchmaking balance is üòî
---
It feels like BHVR actually hate the killer that they have created
---
Leaks by daylight? Or something else? Sorry, I just wanna know as I‚Äôm trying to save up shards to get some of the stuff, and wanna know if I need money for any of it
---
ive had this happen to me twice and it was against a Freddy and Hillbilly, it seems to be related to being basement hooked
---
He used to be, Freddy now is awesome
---
**NONE OF THE DOCTOR CHANGES ARE ACTUALLY LIVE, ONLY THE TEXT WAS CHANGED**
---
This is the updated text for one of Doctor's Addons. For reference, [this](https://imgur.com/a/NaIKqk5) was the old description for the addon. The numbers were literally there before, why did they go out of their way to REMOVE information from the game that's frustratingly difficult to decipher?
---
Ah yes, the BVHR special: a cool down
---
ok good
---
They should probably stop nerfing strong killers till the weaker ones get some attention
---
Exactly that‚Äôs what I meant, if they let you hit struggle that‚Äôs just crappy.
---
Yeah basement is broke right now on every map
---
All the scratch marks and huff n puffs
---
After I watched painreliever on youtube
---
its happened to me twice against hillbilly and Freddy, seems to be basement hook related
---
*CLANG*
---
The thing is, [THE VALUE WAS ALREADY GIVEN TO US BEFORE](https://imgur.com/a/NaIKqk5). This means someone actively went and decided "they don't need to know the actual number value, let's just give them another generic vague description of a number".
---
Just to give a counter argument. These people bought the game to have fun. If they're not having fun playing the match, because its a killer with some pretty nasty add-ons or whatever reason, then they have to stay and try to play the game when they're not having fun? 
---
Its selfish to dc dont get me wrong, but you aren't often going to see people sacrificing their time and fun when they can simply dc and move on to the next and try to have a fun experience.
---
ah okay thank you
---
Said every rabbi ever
---
Rip my girl susie, i actively feel punished just playing legion now.
---
Ummm...it's really not funny
---
This is god!

No,  it's not broken. It's just another killer buff :D
---
Rng has always existed
---
K I'll delete
---
What a shitty way to live your life.
---
They are in tune with survivor mains, that is for sure. I don't blame them. That is where the $ is. A balanced experience really isn't necessary.
---
Youtubers wont post the game where they lose, silly! For example Monto. Did you ever see him getting less than 3 kills as a killer or dying as a surv? It doesnt mean that he is a God btw ^^
---
I got excited for the static blast but saw no button prompt. Pretty good job as usual
---
No. Shit tome challenges, buggy as fuck game but hey now you‚Äôre punished if you disconnect due to being stuck In a wall or something.
---
It‚Äôs almost impossible to get out currently on a one on one with hatch. Most killers find it before it opens anyway and once closed, if you dont have a key you‚Äôre basically fucked. The only way you can escape is if the gates spawn at complete opposite if the map without any way to see the handle from far away which rarely happens. It‚Äôs so stupidly one sided that I just put myself in a locker and wait for my death.
---
When Legion was first released, the Deep Wounds timer would tick down when you were not in a chase with the Legion. That meant that Legion could break chase by the simple technique of looking at the ground. Chases only begin when the survivor is on the killer's screen and begins running. Now the survivor had a nasty choice. Stand still and men, allowing Legion to get close and M1 them, or keep running until their Deep Wounds timer expired and they went down. This was referred to as the 'Virgin Incel Killer' technique (only not really).
---
no, hidden behind a wall, no noise
---
This is the kind of stuff I like to hear.
---
I just played the new map on the switch &amp; i know what everyone is talking bout. That map is DARK AF. &amp; worse bc i was on switch haha.
---
I havent heard of Monto. I only watch No0b3 and HybridPanda. Now that you mention it though.. everyone has their bad rounds. So you're right.
---
If you skip to 1:36 you‚Äôll see the cosmetics.
---
https://youtu.be/B2PUfrSA-Zw
---
Yeah seen videos of this. Pretty good map design so far.
---
What do you expect though when the maps are designed by people who dont know their own game?
---
That's not the issue in question. The issue is sometimes dbd will boot you regardless of internet connection. Just bugs out sometimes.
---
That's stupid. Cosmetics shouldn't be permanently unobtainable just because you started playing the game after they came out. Whiny brats on this fuckin sub man :/
---
This recording gave me virtual AIDS
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ OP? Bro ghostface has no map pressure only a fear factor of uncertainty.
---
Same thing just happened to me on Xbox One... screen turned green then after a minute it was just me falling through the map...
---
Low effort? They designed and modeled an entire new killer and survivor. They made three unique perks for each of them. They created sounds for the actions that each character brought with them. They designed a handful of add-ons and a whole power for the killer and gave it animations. Not only that but this is something that you could get for free if you play enough since they came up with the entire concept from story to personality. That is not low effort.
---
While he may not be a nurse or spirit in terms of power, for you to call what the devs did low effort is simply distasteful. Learn to appreciate those who provide content for something you paid for instead of being a whiney bitch, honestly.

what do you want then? They're not going to ban for that ever, nor are they going to remove the struggle option

I wouldn't mind if they made it so that the struggle phase is automatic and you have to wait for it to run out

What about the challenges that need basement hooks?
---
At least the killer gets points/ bbq stacks/ other perk triggers now. Instant DCs dont get you shit.
---
It happens on PC, but if you can somehow get out of the basement, and fall back onto the stairs - it breaks you out of the green screen, I had my friend guide me out of the shack in hopes it would fix it, and I ran back into the basement and it fixed it. Happened again in the next game.
---
funny the penalties aren't even starting until the 5th
---
Not rly people will just start suiciding on hooks
---
Haven't seen it from the survivor side just been messaged after every basement hook
---
hillbilly with a bat

Doctor: Are ya ready kids?

Holy shit i just patched, and this happened to me. Hahah
---
Everyone is going to be in red ranks in a few months and low rank queues are going to be so long. Pipping is a joke it‚Äôs so easy. I intentionally go in to screw around with friends and somehow pip even when we don‚Äôt touch a gen. I‚Äôm disappointed I‚Äôll never go back to green ranks, that‚Äôs where the most fun is.
---
I‚Äôm curious how this sub can simultaneously complain about how NOED is too OP because it‚Äôs too much work to track down the totems *and* that there‚Äôs not enough totems on the map for Inner Strength to be worthwhile.
---
Either all the totems are consistently cleansed or they aren‚Äôt.
---
And let‚Äôs be honest, Inner Strength (like Self-care) should only be used as an alternative when you can‚Äôt get someone to heal you.  It‚Äôs one of my fav perks but at max I use it twice a game; but those uses were the difference between getting hooked and getting out once we‚Äôre down to final gens.
---
He can‚Äôt be a good killer, and he can‚Äôt be a bad killer. There‚Äôs a grey area somewhere, and that‚Äôs where I operate.
---
Hope it‚Äôs lime green, cause I like my survivors bitter ( had to do it).
---
So they nerfed the legion for cOnSisTanCy. What the actual fuck is going on with the balance team??
---
70,000
---
Love this song
---
If people don't want to play, they won't play. Even if someone saves that survivor, they'll probably just dick around until the killer kills them. You can't force people to play properly if they don't want to.
---
King looks hot!
---
Otzdarva, Ohtofu, Tru3ta1ent. in that order. 
---
Ohtofu puts out only one or two videos a week, and he‚Äôs nice except for he loves him the word Dude. Tru3 is good at the game but he gets reread annoying after a while. But him and Otz break down the game into theory and skill and how you do it. You really get he play by play analysis of what they‚Äôre doing and they do it for max optimal action. 
---
Otz and Ohtofu are killer exclusively. Tru3 is split evenly, in a literal every other game. Monto is 1) annoying and 2) plays a lot of survivor.
---
Rework legion, pls
---
in all fairness i played several days of the ptb and never ran into this once
---
Damn. Doctor getting no love in the comic or the comments.
---
Knowing where the totems can spawn mitigates a fair amount of its usage, its a good perk but both head on and decisive strike are vastly superior, escaping the killers grasp is much better than finding a dull totem
---
Just experienced this myself first time playing against the Oni and I got basement hooked on Gideon Meat Co. figured I'd come on the sub to see if anyone else is having the same problems
---
No he wasn't, as soon as you learned how to use the delay to your advantage he was the strongest killer in game, with infinite aura reading once you where a sleep.
---
What most people did with Freddy is rush a survivor and then trail him you needed to sleep them from a distance and by the time you where close they would fall asleep and you had an insta hit. If they ran out of your TR you had vision on them, and coupled with "Insidious" or "Monitor and Abuse" he was impossible to get rid of.
---
It's true he was bad at ambushing survivors but his skill set was made especially for that not to be his playstyle. Now he's just a generic killer with fake pallets and blood puddles and while the pallets and teleport are good that doesn't diminish the fact that he is very boring now and in a regular chase is nothing more then an M1 killer.
---
fuck, too true
---
B L O A T F A C E
---
I immediately thought of the voices from the samation parody‚Äôs when reading this.
---
Hate the game, not the player. Blame the devs for not removing collision.
---
No Pyrocinical i dont want raid shadow legends
---
What, i updated the game and i don t have the sweater. Is this some cruel joke?
---
Wasn't exhausted. Literally every time I tried to use it, it wouldn't work.
---
In time, i imagine the reason why we didn't get it this update was due to all the other cosmetics already being announced before Deathgarden announced they would be shutting down. Most likely mid chapter or next chapter we'll get it since all the pc players got it already
---
You won't if it's a genuine D/C that's why they are putting it only onto dedicated server platforms because the system can read what kind of disconnect it is , you will be fine
---
People in the comments need to relax. Not even a day in and everyone has already made up their minds on whether or not this killer is garbage. People said Demo was shit/god tier on live release, but now that the hype died down the common consensus is high-mid tier.
---
Maybe survs will actually start playing instead of DCing as soon as something goes wrong.
---
@blinkingbat I love it. It would be 100% better with Susie though! :D
---
Yes, he has a sprinting attack like Hillbilly. Your point? Almost all of the killers share similarities with each other. Creating an entirely unique power that doesn't relate to others is hard when you've been updating the game for two years so of course there are going to be things that overlap.

you and the 300 other people who have posted about it. it seems to be related to being basement hooked, map and killer don't seem to be related
---
You spent all that time typing and still couldn't answer the question. What a twat.
---
How's legion after the latest rework btw?
---
For a second I was confused and thought Bill had a Hag skin
---
Amazing how this isn't just common practice by now. This isn't me specifically trying to shit on bhvr, lots of devs fail to do this but everytime it *is* done it's met with huge praise.
---
- Wtf  are you doing to my favorite killer.
---
BHVR: "Yes."
---
An A for a neigh?
---
Happens on PC, as well.
---
What a coincidence that every killer now seems to be taking everyone into the basement right now, regardless of where they were when downed. 
---
Abusing a glitch, it seems. Pretty damn pathetic, if you ask me. Everyone taking advantage of this should be punished.
---
Just a fleshwound
---
Thank you! Ill try to check them all out!
---
I don‚Äôt have a picture but it‚Äôs basically the same as the original top but her back logo is gold instead of pink
---
No.
---
How do you guys have the same name?
---
"Bloodthirsty Sword" from the demonic force costume, first purchase I ever made in this game, the whole thing just looks so badass. A sword broken in half still has a sharp edge I guess : p
---
Could just be a bug then on the devs part
---
Not even going to explain why old freddy wasn't the "strongest killer" in the game.
---
Literally.
---
I'm probably losing it but Jake kinda looks like Brendan Fraser there. Just reminds of him I suppose.
---
So fuck everyone who started playing the game when it was actually popular I guess. God forbid someone owns a cosmetic that you got years ago D:
---
No the event cosmetics are not being released any more. These are just the giveaways from irl events.
---
For all I care you can keep the Oni, Billy is superior in every way. I'm glad I grinded my Million points up front got him to 40 to unlock his skill and I'm never touching him again!
---
What is that?
---
So you're implying that OP's team wasn't actually facecamped, and the killer didn't have NOED, and OP just made the whole thing up to justify the "toxic" play made at the exit gate?
---
That's why I like Otz, he actually still posts games where he loses.
---
Also ScottJund recently did 2 hours of Spirit games straight with no cuts other than lobby/queue between games to show the overall power of the killer. He wins most but not all of them.

No, they are talking about traps being sabotaged and the trapper becoming an M1 killer because traps were gone from the game if sabod.
---
Yeah, I think it's best you shut up because I heard more intelligent banter come out of peoples assholes!  
---
Bye now!
---
I mean I'm equally a survivor and killer main and I understand why someone will tunnel the "easier" survivor. And that's because it's your job as killer to get the kills and gain an edge. The potato might not be good at running loops but the skill ceiling isn't too high on gens. I don't typically camp the hook and if I've made it back and found the poor sap oh well hopefully they have ds. I'm not going to abandon chase so he can go work gens. I feel the same on unsafe hooks, it sucks as a survivor if they don't have borrowed time but I don't blame the killer for going for the easy down. Anyone that thinks the killer has to abide by some unspoken rules is delusional. If they camp punish them and knock out 3 gens. There are counter plays to everything and no not everyone will survive, but you can punish killers once you adapt to their play style.
---
&gt; they wont upload a game wherw they are being tunneled or camped on the hook (99% red ranks games)
---
Red ranks solo queue player here and that's nowhere near 99% of my games. I'd say maybe 25% and that's being generous.
---
Because at rank 20 killers are stronger, and at rank 1 survivors are...
---
Overprotective great great great great great great grandfather time
---
And if they‚Äôre having fun with Oni? More fun than they would with Billy? Should he be dropped anyway just because one‚Äôs stronger?
---
thanks for testing the new disconnection penalty feature!
---
From what I understand the problem was that people lost those cosmetics and behaviour couldn't find a solution other than just unlocking them for everyone. 
---
Yea it kinda defeats the purpose of making the cosmetics tied behind grindy challenge walls just to hand them out, but it makes sense why it was done. In any case, it is what it is. Most likely once every platform they want to put dbd on is finalized then event exclusives will be just that
---
Have the same problem on xbox. yellow medkit with 16extra down to 25% after one heal.
---
It be like that sometimes
---
Says the one who thinks Old freddy was better than Nurse. And says current freddy is a generic killer.
---
Oh yikes, a "okay boomer" person.
---
Well, now you're definitely not interested in discussion... I guess you can take a report for the insult and making me waste my time. :)
---
that's fine. even that would be better for the team
---
It was apparently a bug,  so they removed it
---
Fully agree, he's just a Billy that can't charge around all the time atm. He looks good but looks don't get hooks!
---
Is seven minute video enough to report of nothing happening?
---
Lunar new year cosmetics?   
---
Previous christmas cosmetics?   
---
Everyone has them at all times, regardless of having the game installed during that time, or having played during those events.   
---
There is no purpose to having anything exclusive in this game anymore, as it will be given away to everyone at some point, whether that's event items, IRL items, or even the rift/battle pass.   
---
If a company does it once, I can assure you they'll pull the same shit twice, and three times, too.
---
I think hes fine now that he can't 360 flick your ass after moving at hillbilly speeds.
---
I knew it was happening so I remembered which hook I was on so I could try and guide myself out when saved in case that fixed it.
---
However it stayed as it was for myself. I ended up in the middle of the map and only knew when the Killer was picking me up again.
---
Did ya get em?
---
I got made fun of for being a blendette that uses urban evasion :( I just want to crouch fast pls leave me alone
---
The only way I found to fix it is if you're with a SWF. This seems impossible to fix if you're not alone. The only way to get your camera back into the game is to fall. Dropping down from the ledge onto the basement stairs will fix it.
---
All i am saying is that they use PTB to test if everything is all right , but still somehow we get bugs like this on live servers
---
Yeah, and demon strike when it finally hits has so long of a cool down that by the time you can pick them up 3 more hooks are done.
---
Running neither on Lauri, because I dont have her.
---
It reminds me of Peanuts
---
Yup, I play on Console Nurse is practically dog shite here... Every nurse game is a field day of points and one frustrated killer!
---
The strike still breaks it
---
Yeah, honestly, BHVR hasn't a clue on how to balance things.
---
She was hooked in the basement when her screen went completely white. Then went black with the hud. Was like that until the killer found her and picked her up fixing the bug.
---
but no accessibility features
---
people are saying he sucks?  he was barely changed
---
They could be doing tome challenges that require basement hook or downing close to basement.
---
On PC he is a machine. I've only escaped once out of my 7 games played this morning, every other time it was an easy 4k with 3-4 gens left.
---
Sounds dope!
---
For all I care you can play the weaker killer, it's better for the survivors that you do.  
---
Facts might not be fun to hear but at least they are facts.
---
Honestly not sure haven‚Äôt given them a spin yet. I do think the faster vaulting/movement in Frenzy will be nice but I‚Äôd like to see Legion receive a rework as even a good killer will suffer playing them against decent survivors. I‚Äôll be mostly bouncing between Huntress and The Oni but I‚Äôll be sure to see if playing as Legion feels a bit better now. Personally when I‚Äôm playing survivor the need  to mend isn‚Äôt at all threatening and it seems like most Legion players can‚Äôt keep up enough pressure to get hooks let alone kills. When playing as Killer it seems like a lot of work when I could just cross map with a chainsaw and one shot someone instead.
---
I've played 10 oni games and seen only 1 yuki :(
---
Running the edge of the map until you're safe? And not work on gens? This is bad for Legion how? His power locks a survivor out of performing actions for 8-12 seconds and gives you the opportunity to apply it to multiple survivors. The "tickle" is also a near-unavoidable health state change. How are they "basically a powerless killer" when their power literally applies pressure?
---
Claudette revealed herself by going back and for vault. She was my obsession and I farmed her for remember me perk. The other guy thinks I was friendly or something and came to us. I catch the other guy and let Claudette leave... cause she was done like me.
---
pls gife
---
you had a different version, thats the exclusive (aka the inclusive) version, it was given to everyone after todays update.
---
PC In game bug in basement: 
---
twice now on different maps, since the update when I get hooked in the basement on my first hook I glitch into this cloud realm where I can't do anything. The first time, I was unable to see and move again until after someone unhooked me AND healed me. The second time someone came and unhooked me, but didn't heal me so I was stuck in this limbo in basement where I wasn't hooked. couldn't use my medkit, and because I wasnt healed couldnt see/move. eventually Oni came down, found me and hooked me again at which point everything returned to normal for my struggle phase on hook.
---
This did not happen at an in between game though when the doctor hooked me in basement. Only seems to be the first hook, not the second. I have some footage from my twitch I can upload to show once I gather it.
---
Is anyone else experience this? how would I report this bug? it has never happened to me during hundreds of hours of gameplay until today when the update came out :/
---
First clip: clip starts after hook so you can see it fix itself after being healed - [https://clips.twitch.tv/KnottyGorgeousLapwingFeelsBadMan](https://clips.twitch.tv/KnottyGorgeousLapwingFeelsBadMan)
---
Second clip: me getting hooked. it stayed like this after getting unhooked, until Oni came back down and rehooked me basically - [https://clips.twitch.tv/UglySuccessfulMangoWOOP](https://clips.twitch.tv/UglySuccessfulMangoWOOP)
---
but no colourblind options
---
lol sad
---
From what I'm reading on here, yeah.  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Oni is just a worse billy honestly. I‚Äôve played a bit on multiple maps but he just feels weak IMO fell free to disagree
---
Noed activates once gates are powered
---
I got told to kill myself by 4 people, fuck off by 2 and another called me a lazy n-word.
---
This isn't gonna work.
---
No they aren't they're doing the rift challenges to put people in basement/Monsterous Shrine challenge.
---
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm eons late to the punch, but I had fun making it
---
Studded Jacket: **My goals are beyond your understandjng**

i agree it is frustrating, but game design is complicated, things that aren't present on the test build can make their way to the live build

People freak out over any changes that come to killers, i think its 2 early to decide if it was a good change or not. but i think its more fair then it was in PTB
---
If you buff killers to beat swf solos will get destroyed, the answer would be buffing killers and solo players so they can be at the same level as swf. At least it‚Äôs what I think.
---
Wait you dont need end game collapse for archives? Where you need 2 noed kills
---
That doesn't seem to be working, I'm aiming at the face, the light changes but I don't get the points for killer blind and it doesn't count on the challenge.
---
The end game collapse starts as soon as all 5 gens have been repaired, not when the doors are opened.
---
In other words, a Survivor has to be beyond incompetent for Deep Wound to even matter.
---
First game against was funny. 1dc, 2 died, I was down second time and he wanted to give me hatch But I gave him the free kill since he was so kind to give it to me
---
It was a "bug" and now they fixed it, shittiest fix ever honestly
---
except its the same speed as pressing space.
---
Which one?
---
I am so sorry üò∞ i normally don't ask people for help so I guess I just got lucky. 
---
Did you offer to let them kill you in return? Maybe that would help?
---
It doesnt, only when gate is opened?
---
Use blood warden with noed, you can snowball really hard
---
It's a great time for killers to complete the basement challenges.. but you literally are dead if you get hooked to the basement. Nice view though, like after death
---
A majority of survivors are solo players. Balance around SWF and it screws over that majority.
---
&gt; Am I missing something?
---
just ideas for how to go about said perfect balance
---
I did, doesnt work
---
I‚Äôm well aware of the facts- only about four killers are actually really strong. The rest aren‚Äôt. But it isn‚Äôt about that- it‚Äôs about who you find the most fun. I main Michael not because he‚Äôs a strong killer (he isn‚Äôt really- he isn‚Äôt bad, not by a long shot, but he isn‚Äôt strong)- I main him because he‚Äôs a lot more fun than Spirit, Nurse or Billy to me. 
---
Actively discouraging people to play who they want and instead playing the much stronger killers is a shit way of doing things.
---
Flair checks out.
---
It's just standard Covering Your Ass. He doesn't want to be held liable for promising it if some freak accident occurs with another company's software.
---
Lol I got pulled off the hook and got double downed by him when he was even that close he sprinted back and just double whacked us
---
So BhVR Interactive when is Console getting those dedicated servers?? 
---
You guys said late summer, that time came &amp; went and now stated late fall? 
---
Would like some update info please?
---
You can bring any obsession perk for the challenge.
---
Lol I play with low lever Myers with not really experience yet, depip... I try my best killer where I got most matches 3-4K‚Äôs and now üò¢
---
Yep. The person who called me a lazy n-word said that only gay slur lazy n-words offer free kills.
---
Oh alright thanks, i was assuming it would be somthing common that happens because I've only been playing the game a bit later after the stranger things update.
---
Just downloaded the update on PS4 was on 14/15 iridescent emblems. Got 3 in my first game (against the Oni) still on 14/15. Has anybody else had anything like this happen?

I'll be happy when they get Naruto a male voice actor.

again
---
*brings flashlight*
---
I will t-bag on their graves, INNOCENT BLENDETTES FOREVER!
---
why rework killers when you can just nerf them to shit
---
Now the other guy wants to report me cause I was "friends" with said Claudette who did nothing -_- he is gonna write a ticket. What should I do?
---
I like how when people cried for nerfs it was ‚Äútoo early‚Äù and survivors just needed to ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù but its fine to call for buffs straight away and that‚Äôs fine
---
Isn't Feng Korean? I'm not going to pretend to know anything about Asian naming customs but that might have something to do with it.
---
My only complaint is that survivors don‚Äôt greet me with the booty bounce dance at the start of a match. Why most high ranks be so prude? :c
---
RIP my frames on the new map then.
---
What lunar year/Christmas cosmetics are you talking about? Every item on the list is from a code from a convention thing, one sweater for a free character, and the glowing eyes that they give every original killer.
---
And now they've just given them all for free?

---
The addon changes are interesting though. It's actually a good idea to run the status effect ones as you can inflict them more than once per frenzy now.
---
She is Chinese.
---
I know. It‚Äôs so absurd
---
Yes, let's make killers stronger for SWF so the solo players can eat rocks and die every single match because they choose to play alone.
---
Deliverance would be perk to be able to escape.  You're going to have the same people who DC just suicide by hook which only benefits the killer.  At the moment, a DC benefits the killer in that there are 3 people but it hurts the survivors in that there are only 3 people.
---
&gt;# If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
mass boycott. just dont play until its fixed and they will fix it faster. no sense in playing a game so broken when you are basically dead on first basement hooking.
---
It deactivates the power and he loses part of the gauge. Some of you people will never be happy. He already has to injure someone just to get his power at a reasonable rate, whereas Billy can do everything he does for free. Good god.
---
You know it's a Spirit,  she's not moving. Why use the perk when it's obvious she's phasing.
---
If you play oni too, yes. On ps4 my frames are lower than my self steem
---
Lol God that sucks for them
---
Look at the back of the jacket... One has a giant "sausage" the other is blank.
---
Id buy one ngl
---
I had to quit the game because once I got to player level 10 and below I was told to ‚Äúgo die in a house fire‚Äù because I used urban evasion, but I appreciate the support &lt;333
---
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK? Just remove Legion at this point, honestly.
---
I luv the devs. Free cosmetics, finally excellent new survivor perks, and they redid the tome 3 challenges ahead of schedule.. it‚Äôs like Christmas came early this year tbqh
---
Queue times were already a disaster thanks to dedicated servers and crossplay lol
---
The thing is he's just a weak billy... there is noting new or innovating about him. His perks suck except for Nemesis maybe in certain situations or with certain builds. But on the whole he's just a Billy that can't charge all the time.
---
He looks great, but looks don't get hooks buddy! His charged attack takes to long outside charge, obstructs vision like you can't believe, has a CD that makes survivors have time to reach the other end of the map.
---
If I know I'm playing against him I'm not even afraid since you can simply sidestep to dodge him since they took his flick attack function away.
---
Unless he gets a buff to his attacks during rage, you'll just play mediocre games with him. Nothing more.
---
Hex: No One Escapes Downvote
---
When all generators are completely or the endgame collapse is in effect, gain 8% movement speed. All survivors suffer from the voting status effect.
---
*"Don't test me, bitch" -reddit user*
---
Voting status effect: Survivors who suffer from this status effect slowly are downvoted to hell. Every 15 seconds doubles the number of downvotes applied. Killers who have the voting status effect applied gain upvotes. Every 10 seconds the upvotes double in number. Gain double of each effect if all generators are repaired or the endgame collapse is in effect.
---
Don't let people kill your hype, Oni is still a legitimately strong killer, just not quite as scary in relentlessness and explosiveness as he was in the PTB. I'd say he's comfortably Billy tier, and possibly stronger with add-ons than Billy is with add-ons.
---
Consider watching this VoD: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/516550048, and also keep an eye out for Zubat to stream at some point, who should also be able to show that Oni is still brutal, just not brokenly so.
---
I play on console too, but since the most of the community is on PC, it's stupid to evaluate killers based on how they perform on console. 
---
But on console even Nurse is better than old freddy.
---
What were the changes?
---
Because the SFW is an extremely small player base that's why there's no point
---
It‚Äôs always when I have We‚Äôll Make It
---
Good. I want shorter queue times on survivor.
---
how did the actual game feel?  going by actual score everyone was fairly even, and at least you killed 1.  killer can't expect 3-4k every match, even against same ranks.  you should feel good imo
---
Yup
---
I'll lose a lot of games I'm sure, but I'm still excited to play him
---
On pc with Q and E steering + mouse, he can pull easy 180s around loops like nobodies business. Sounds like he sucks for consoles but is quite good on PC.
---
But there is no way to tell who is *purposefully* abusing the exploit. Not to mention there is literally a tome challenge that makes you hook survivors in the basement.
---
Saying people should be punished for this is just ignorant.
---
Oh yeah that makes sense
---
That‚Äôs cool and all- but what if someone has a different opinion than you (shocker) and simply enjoys playing Oni more?
---
I honestly love the way both play, but in my opinion Oni has better mobility than Billy has without any add-ons. Add that to the fact he can Insta down multiple survivors and he is a complete beast. Idk if he is above or below Billy but it‚Äôs a pretty close one between both. He gets his power fairly quick in order to keep pressure and he basically has instant chainsaw (that also has a lunge distance) if you don‚Äôt charge your attack for more than a sec.
---
What happened: So I was playing on Gideon Meat Plant, best map lmao, and Oni tries to put me on the basement hook... Except I start falling out of the map for some reason.
---
In the end, he did get me and for some reason, the game instantly killed me when I went on the hook for the first time
---
I had a sky view and next game completely grey one
---
Wait what?
---
The ones rewarded from grinding is not being released to everyone.  They just put out at note that they could fix it to those who lost it.  If you click the link it doesn‚Äôt show those being given out anymore.
---
I got an idea: I'll be a p-3 blendette and bring the least "meta" perks. *Equips no mither and all self healing perks*
---
Thats a Texas size 10-4.
---
Yeah and you had ample opportunity to answer your own question before coming here. Sounds like I'm not the only twat here then.
---
what an absolute unit
---
Big brain play.
---
Join the republic, we have cookies... And Darth Monto
---
I would really see you prove that claim, Because on console nurse is so easily dodgable that if you get hit by her you must really be new at this game!
---
People really need to use ‚Äúgiven name‚Äù and ‚Äúfamily name/surname‚Äù when discussing these things. In Japan, they don‚Äôt say their ‚Äúlast name first‚Äù, because it‚Äôs the name that comes first, the first name. It just so happens that in Japan, first names are the ones you share with your family, and last names are the one your parents choose for you when you‚Äôre born.
---
Yeah that happened to me too
---
Oh really? Then i don't know what this guy is complaining about then
---
W h a t
---
I‚Äôll admit I was ignorant indeed, because I don‚Äôt play killer and I don‚Äôt care about the challenges, so I wasn‚Äôt aware there was a challenge like that. Oh well.
---
I swear I never passed rank 4! Short story, one of the longest times I was chased by the killer, no gens got done. When I then worked on a gen, THERE WASNT EVEN RUIN! I didn‚Äôt know what to feel.
---
Are you talking about the christmas items?

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e5mw2b/i_love_this_new_glitch_dlc_1010/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
What does my name have anything to do with that?
---
Mend time nerfed, deep wound nerfed (for the 4th time), no more synergy with STBFL and Sloppy, yeah, Legion's officially an M1 no power killer now.
---
His power needs either a huge buff or a complete rework. He‚Äôs probably the game‚Äôs worst killer atm
---
Hopefully
---
As a previous Legion main converted to an Oni main I have no Idea what to do with my Legion
---
Opinions don't matter, facts matter, opinions are like assholes everyone has one, but unlike assholes you should reevaluate and study your opinions all the time!
---
Timed cosmetics and items are a staple of any online game now. As a dva main in overwatch, it sucks i can never get the nano cola skin, but that's just how it is. 
---
Even cosmetics create a sense of urgency and a must play feel, if items just show up later, even for a price, it removes the must play and must have feeling, also it devalues the event cosmetics for people who care about that kinda thing. 
---
Unfortunately you just have to accept you can't have them. Just because your a devout follower and player of the game doesn't entitle you to anything.
---
except a few, but yes. Overall, if you got all those cosmetics legit, your account would be over 1.5k easily... sucks for my fellow exclusive owners
---
Yeah it's really fun for new killers to play against SWF players with 500+ hours.
---
Damn, if it‚Äôs actually a thing I will try not to. It‚Äôs a shame one of the challenges is basement hooks but I can get around that
---
I think he should be able to use the dash outside demon form (without the insta down, obviously). Imagine this, he sheathe his sword, starts dashing and peforms a slash at the end (like spirits post phase attack). Not saying its a great idea, but thematically it would be awesome
---
First person view at barefoot myers stomping a gen/pallet though üëÄü§§
---
I learned killer way before survivor but yeah watching tru3talent taught me a lot
---
Yea hopefully, they said they no longer want to exclude certain platforms so I imagine that the Meg mask will be coming sooner or later
---
You went in heaven...
---
I‚Äôm a rank 8 ps4 player, and i disabled the messages from strangers, i received hate messages almost every game, regardless of my play style.
---
Hooked on my first game made me fall endlessly through the floor without being able to struggle or do anything. Then someone managed to unhook me and I continued to fall through the floor endlessly without being able to do anything :)
---
I'm in the same boat, as I really just found the game this last June. Was so excited to have the hound mask, though I understand the complaints from older players.
---
Still, if their goal is to move away from exclusivity, let newer players buy them, earn them in similar events (maybe the currency can buy the older cosmetics or new ones), or even release slightly different variants so the originals are still unique while letting those designs go to newer players as well.
---
I agree, but he really feels awful in many moments. His power barely helps in chases and is only good for catching survivors off-guard, which would happen rarely when people get used to him. 
---
Also, His hitboxes are a fucking nightmare
---
*annoying
---
Well you are. I already know about not being able to use the perk of I'm already exhausted. I wasn't exhausted. The perk wasn't activating, but was still causing me to become exhausted. Maybe instead of being a fucking prick, you could actually answer people's questions. But instead you just act like an obnoxious jackass. But hey, I suppose you really couldn't help yourself.
---
Keep in mind buying the store set gives you an extra piece of survivor clothing for the new survivor.
---
Nevermind, the opening line of this reply speaks for itself.
---
Personally I can't wait to try playing the Trapper on it.
---
Or you know, just upvote without feeling the need to tell him.
---
This might happen, for a while, then they will learn, i hope.
---
Ash would be money as he is licensed.
---
What
---
We just got ghostface. Hes a short boy.
---
I mean, yeah
---
I played around 20 games on him and he feels mediocre. If survivors play carefully and hide when you are in ability, you barely get any chances to do anything to them. Without an ability he is just an M1 with huge ass and in ability he can be easily juked.
---
But if you manage to snowball survivors with 1-2 demon modes, then you will definitely win
---
You could open the gate yourself to trigger the collapse.
---
Iron Grasp and Agitation are about to become S tier perks
---
If majority of survivors are solo, nerf SWF then.
---
If they're in such a minority then nerf it.
---
Demogorgon finds inner peace
---
Honestly the worst part of the key is that if there are 3 survivors alive and 1 gen left, but they have no chance of getting it done, If one person takes hatch w/ a key, closing the hatch POWERS THE FUCKING DOORS. That is just such bs its ridiculous. Went from a 3/4k to 1/2k, even if only one person gets the hatch.
---
Oof I got my bbq skins back within 2 days of writing a ticket
---
He bought the bundle any ideas why it may not be working
---
Sure you know where all totems spawn on the Game. I bet you will die first before you run all possible places. That is just some bullshit you talk. Knowing possible locations on 30+maps vs knowing the exact place is not even close in favour of the second.  And it seems you forgot what we were talking about. It is what supports better the  Inner Strength perk, not what makes you escape the killer. Being healed by finding totems does that though. Finding no totems  will make that perk wortless
---
Wait can you?
---
WE DEMAND THIS TO BE THE FACE OF SPINECHILL. ü§£ü§£
---
Easy lobby dodge /s
---
Some people haven‚Äôt even got responses lmao
---
I've stayed, and half the time the tunneling pigs only get the person they tunnel, no more.
---
Lmao i was trying to make the survivors think im friendly and make them open it buuut yikes.
---
So if someone is hiding from legion but not mending the timer still goes down? Even if legion is next to them?
---
Killers got a quitter bonus. Not as much bp as thry could get, but they got something for a survivor dc
---
Idk what you mean, I‚Äôm just saying what I see in the picture
---
ok. is there anything that will please any of you?
---
Wait this actually almost made me downvote just to be funny but I didnt wanna fuck up your karma lmao

Yeah, seems like you have to be really careful unhooking people. Kind of like with leatherface although oni can just swoop in if you dont pay attention.

When they crouch and do a point emote close to you it looks like they are booping you on your snoot
---
We deserve this in the next update devs
---
Oh my bad. Guess I got the whole gamer thing mixed up with Dva.
---
Every new chapter is a buggy mess lmao
---
Most fun killer honestly
---
Does it power the doors? I thought it just closed it and the rest had to finish the gens
---
Why are you playing demogorgon on the ptb?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxETJaRed4E
---
I personally never run dead hard or bt, and always run two perks that go together and an exhaustion perk and bond or iron will
---
That's not heaven, in the heaven you can see clouds. This is just plain light blue. I've also seen it grey and heard of green one
---
How have you never looked into a bright light? Not even at your doctor or the optometrist? Because if you had, that pattern of blood vessels seen when Killers are flashlight blinded would look very familiar. That's not the eyelids, that's the blood vessels *in your eye*. The fact that you see that actually clearly shows that the Killers are *not* closing their eyes. Bright light filtered through the skin of your eyelids will become much redder and more diffuse, without the clearly defined blood vessels. And while the eyelids are thin, they are plenty thick enough to protect your eyes even from directly facing the sun when they are closed‚Äîlet alone some measly flashlight, no matter how "odd" the bulb may be.
---
Be "that guy" all you want, but make sure you actually know what you're talking about first.
---
He's a good killer, yes.
---
Got it, thanks. I'll keep an eye out
---
Deep Wound was a mistake, BHVR just won't admit it.
---
I literally just did the same thing!
---
I‚Äôll have you know I have a full time job and other hobbies. I just happen to play too much for my own good lol
---
I know it's not youtube - but I like to watch Zubat's past broadcasts on twitch and can vouch that he's pretty damn good at both surv and killer.  Anything other than hatch escapes are quite rare when he is playing killer, even against all rank 1's.  The thing I like the most about him is that he's very relaxed and doesn't make a lot of excuses for mistakes or even complain that much.  He just plays the game and comments on things when he sees fit.  
---
For youtube though - I dunno .. Tofu?
---
Dude NEVER let a survivor go in a situation where they were holding a game hostage.  What message does that send?  What they did was bannable they didn't deserve shit.  I'd have slugged and bled them both out for wasting my time like that.
---
Probably had Whispers or you did not hide nearly as well as you think you did
---
I also got a few day ban when I got them back bc they saw I did the p3 glitch lmao but that really sucks for people who‚Äôve yet to even get a response :/
---
Man if only you could not click on the post.
---
Jesus, this is literally going to be every other post for the next two days isn't it? This is only the 20 or 30th time I've seen it in the last 15 minutes on this sub.
---
You'll get it eventually. I just didnt run ruin and let gens get done. I actually got this challenge and 5 survivors in bear traps on Hawkins, of all places.
---
You must have patience, they are looking into it this very moment I‚Äôm sure, but game development takes time, so once they find a solution we will see the patch as quick as they can manage.
---
Nah, a lot of them are definitely doing it on purpose. I ask the killers if they know and they always confirm they do.
---
So not even yourself? Got it.
---

---
Lol I've played the same huntress using this skin twice and she lag switched both times if we finish 2 gens before being hooked
---
Demo is fun to play and fun to play against. He takes a bit of learning!
---
happened to me in a MacMillian Map aswell
---
They say it's rolling out on the 5th but only for PC and switch.
---
That's true with any killer
---
if he's camping hard enough, you won't get the unhook while awake
---
Well rn I‚Äôm running Ruin to... you know... Sloppy so that people stay injured for long so I can get those blood orbs quickly. Plus if survivors all group up to heal someone off the hook I always find a BUNCH of orbs lying around which punishes them for being altruistic. Nurses will be nice for you to keep pressure when not in your power mode.  Now for the 4th you could either use his actual perk Blood Echo because if injured survivors have no way to sprint burst you or dead hard you once you hook someone it makes them easier to catch. Or you could use Infectious Fright as well, it can really come in use sometimes when you wanna use your power for survivors nearby, so basically slugging or just to hit multiple survivors to build up your power. And finally STBFL for an easier time hitting multiple people or Barbeque. When using his power, you wanna do it mostly when you hook someone and maybe BBQ towards survivors with it. If you have stuff like Monitor and Abuse you will give them a fright. Because not only are you coming fast, their reaction will be slower due to them only hearing your terror radius late. And yeah... that‚Äôs it. Idk what the meta perks with him are yet but these are pretty solid for build.
---
Now watch him whip!
---
he's much too weak and not at all fun enough to make up for it imo
---
Nopers
---
At least hook suicide gives you more points
---
We fucking get it already. Six of the last eight posts in a row are the same exact thing. They know it's a bug everybody can stop posting it now.
---
Well, I'm satisfied. Just hoping they'd do more maps
---
Tofu plays dead by daylight? Wasnt he a fortnite streamer?
---
A lot of them ‚â† all of them
---
There is just no pleasing some people. üòî
---
Addons Im not sure, maybe the ones to pick up your blood orbs with a faster walking speed. And to drop  more blood orbs, but also for his wrath to last longer
---
Keep trying you will get it! I did it on wraith w noed, bbq, nurses &amp; blood warden
---
Normal price.
---
# IF THEY DID THAT, THEN THAT WOULD DEFEAT THE PURPOSE  OF GIVING THEM BACK
---
$7.99 for the chapter
---
Ok. Nobody cares.
---
It's just disheartening to hear what amounts to "maybe in a week or two" when it's an issue that makes the game unplayable. Players will definitely be abusing this - and guess what, now you can't even disconnect at that point if you don't want to be put on a matchmaking cooldown.
---
625 is not even close to what you get for someone dying on first hook (taking into account 2 hits, deviousness from using power, hook, sacrifice, struggle phase, and chase points). And they're still jipped out of potentially hooking someone 3 times.
---
It's not the first time the PTB killers seems strong and before release they get Nerfed already though. If he still had his dirty flick attack so you didn't just have to sidestep to avoid his charge he wouldn't be so bad as he is now.
---
Just start mending
---
Not every time. Played a swf about an hour ago, 3 of us got basement hooked. This didn't happen.
---
I mean you still have to mend before you can do any objectives.
---
IMO this is a buff in *some* ways because typically a lot of legions would run distressing or M&amp;A for killer instinct, so I would often just...not mend because I'd always be in TR...lmao
---
He's fun to play as but I struggle around the lower green ranks with him, even with a power based entirely on giving you pressure, I can't keep enough. They split up and it's hard to manage
---
Lmao true. Sorry bud, I didn't realize. But I looked and it's definitely true. 
---
Noting that I also couldn't wiggle one of the times tbag I was picked up either.
---
You‚Äôre actually so right I don‚Äôt know why they didn‚Äôt do that. You can‚Äôt blind something with no eyes lol
---
reminder to anyone who's changing their name to oni-chan: I'm stockpiling moris
---
Already seeing alot of her.
---
"Come out, come out, survivors! We have a surprise for you"
---
Okay then.
---
see i thought you were talking about his traps moving a bit sometimes after you set them
---
Omg i want it ü§£ü§£
---
I personally think oni is better then billy but that could change since it‚Äôs the first day
---
Why, just fucking why?
---
A nerf wasn't already enough but now you're making deep wounds even more of a joke than it already is?
---
It's like BHVR has something personal with us Legion mains
---
The problem is if you punish via D/C the kids will still D/C via hook suicide.
---
The easiest fix is to make the struggle phase automatic to where you can't just suicide.
---
Thats because its the first day and people likely want the achi. Shes just new and shiny at the moment...
---
No
---
1 or 2 weeks ::D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D
---
The problem wasn't that they were no longer in the match, it was the way they left. Letting themselves die is fine by me. 
---
It was bullshit doing the sacrifice 15 survivors, and every game someone would quit. Not anymore.
---
This bitch needs a fat nerf lol fuck those add ons. I'm a killer main and refuse to touch them.
---
But she was the one who first gave in... so I though like... "Ok I'll kill you... wait you are my obsession... I can farm remember me so the other guy won't get out when you die." then the other guy showed up... and I though... "Never mind the last one showed themselves."
---
She has shit perks but the weebs will be out in force playing her.

Well Nurse still is better, especially after the prayer beads nerf

Good survivors make average killers look like potatoes.

You get it for free

It‚Äôs free you have it

Or bitter murmur

If she gets some more"normal" cosmetics, I'd definitely play as her.
---
Are you kidding me.. I JUST started maining them and I JUST realized how fun sloppy butcher, third seal, thanatophobia, and the pin that makes survivors broken. I'm real sad
---
I am so fucking pissed. This is the change we waited for so fucking long???????? RUNNING DOESN'T CAUSE DEEP WOUNDS TO GO DOWN?????? THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE DOING 99% OF THE MATCH!!!!!! MENDING TAKES 12s AND FRENZY HITS DON'T EVEN COUNT AS NORMAL ANYMORE!!!!!! For the love of God devs just sit down and give my mans a proper rework. These &lt;&lt;balance tweaks&gt;&gt; are bullshit.
---
Stop posting this its a glitch i saw 7 posts about this so far
---
You were close enough!
---
Now I've got that damn song stuck in my head
---
How?
---
Console problems
---
Is it for console too?
---
1: Reduce DS timer to 20 seconds
---
2: Pause DS timer in a chase
---
It's really not that hard behavior
---
It is already in your inventory
---
No ash? Fuck then ash deserve his own conceptual art because he is the Best surv
---
I think that‚Äôs what they mean by ‚Äúthe way we stored these items,‚Äù they don‚Äôt have issues with newer cosmetics because they‚Äôre in the store always now. And they don‚Äôt say this fix is coming immediately, so maybe they‚Äôre looking for a way to cash in a bit as they return it to those who lost it instead of giving it to everybody.
---
But BHVR themselves said they don‚Äôt want exclusivity in their game. If this wasn‚Äôt the case they wouldn‚Äôt allow blight or year-of-the-pig cosmetics to be purchased after their respective events. I‚Äôm don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm feeling entitled for these specific outfits only because they released a statement that they would be released and now it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre taking it away. I understand something like Legacy because the grind was extreme and it stands for being with the game since the **very** beginning, which is a meaningful message. But an event doesn‚Äôt seem to hold the same weight imo...
---
You get hooked in the basement, your screen turns grey and you fall through the map, well for everyone else you're still on the hook but your cam is in the ground and you literally can't play, nor can you kill yourself since the game autostruggles for some reason
---
Insidious iron grasp agitation ruin pls
---
So there's a new and exciting bug.
---
Oni kicked a gen. On the other side of the map I fell over and everyone got exposed due to Devour Hope. There was an illusion of me being carried/dropped by Oni.
---
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK
---
That‚Äôs odd. If it does the pulse and you hit the face. I‚Äôm assuming you do it straight ahead of them. Hmm. What color flashlight and addons? Also, if you‚Äôre a bit slow, a killer can move their camera and not be ‚Äúblinded,‚Äù even if it‚Äôs almost complete (like an almost done wiggle bar). A great practice place is when a killer is breaking a pallet. It‚Äôs pretty easy to keep it pointed right at them as they do. Should give you a sense of timing.
---
Nice! I did not because I was busy playing the game. Just don't scroll through new or dislike me
---
Meghead ass.

You gotta love it when that happens
---
Are you fucking kidding me? A week or two?
---
It literally breaks the game, and people will be punished for disconnecting.
---
These fuckers dont deserve any money
---
You love to see it
---
Can't you just slug so they can't DC via suicide on hook?
---
and the guy literally said "I have repired she has only idden, and you have helped her escape and she was not going to repair me just so that you kill me and she escapes"
---
"and in my video it looks like you help a killer helping a survivor and hurting another one you'll see who takes the ban"
---
Green flash light, with Odd bulb(The red one) and yellow accuracy increase forgot the name.
---
MM CD is live on thrursday, not today
---
As a demogorgon main only play him if you're good with placing, timing and map knowledge, if you aren't then just don't play him and even as a semi good demogorgon you will still lose if the survivors are atleast decent
---
Is it meant to be that white wtf ?
---
I hate when they do that. I'm usually the injured one tbh. I always run behind the nearest wall/rock/cover to heal
---
Legion still too op plz nerf /s
---
How considerate of her to move that pesky pallet out of your way for you LOL.
---
Have you tried playing Civ6?
---
If you were going to just throw out any possible explanation, why did you ask for one?
---
Survivor breathing and grass shuffling is very audible to the killer if the killer is paying attention to that type of stuff like they should be.
---
You're a saint to forgive that type of scumbaggery.  They both deserved to die in an unfun game for what they pulled.  Hiding for 20 minutes is cancer.  They were trying to make you quit the game.
---
Honestly it would probably do good to take a break from the game until it‚Äôs fixed, again BHVR is going to be doing their all to fix the game so we can enjoy it properly, but all we can do is wait, and that is the unfortunate reality, but chin up, soon we‚Äôll get past this and it‚Äôll become a distant memory while we enjoy our new content. However, what I find more disheartening that so many people aren‚Äôt even satisfied with that. Good luck out in the fog if you choose to persevere.
---
They testing your loyalty to your main
---
All female survivors tend to be fairly popular, except Laurie.
---
Pretend I gave you gold, because that was beautiful
---
r/dbdgonewild is going to have a great time
---
They are trying to cover it on the official forum, any thread mentionning it is stealth deleted.
---
I'm more talking you get teammates who hookicide. It screws shit up and can't be stopped.
---
Because lightburn is a dated mechanic that should honestly just be removed.
---
Strange, that spirit skin looks like leatherface....
---
(In all seriousness though I don't really have a problem with spirit)
---
I don't like the one that lets you put a dowmed pallet back up again, and the one that makes you move faster around a carried survivor (who will also have their wiggle meter increased) seems like it will be broken in SWF. The one that stops bleeding is shit.
---
Just happened to me two games in a row doesn't let you struggle or anything
---
Steam has no preventatives for people sharing names, rather they have a 'tag' that identifies one account from another (for friend request purposes) and people can change their names as much as possible (AFAIK)
---
Good build. That should be pretty quick. Hmm.
---
&gt;If he's AFK what does it matter that it take 7s. ?
---
Imagine not to understand what I meant when I said that. 
---
&gt;he could constantly see where you where!
---
Why does it matter if you can see a survivor if you have 0 chase power? A average survivor could loop him for 1/2 gens easily. A very good survivor? Could loop him for 5 gens so easily.
---
If they‚Äôre literally facecamping yes, that‚Äôs the same with all killers. The abusive Freddies I‚Äôm talking about were not facecamping, they just patrolled the hook like crazy. At least four times I was able to get BT unhooks and three of those times they ended up just hitting the saved survivor and taking a free effortless down. If he‚Äôs camping it‚Äôs obviously not easy, but now if you DO manage a good unhook, the rescued survivor isn‚Äôt 100% guaranteed to be fucked because Fredward wants to circle the hook like a shark instead of using his amazing powers to find and chase survivors.
---
Happens to everyone who gets hooked in the basement. Killers know it and abuse it. Game is literally unplayable right now and BHVR said it wont be fixed until 1-2 weeks from now. I think its a promo move to make us play Deathgarden
---
But they already do that.
---
It looks like their getting rid of his two modes, and he will no longer passively increase madness in his TR like he did in treatment mode. Instead, you'll probably press ctrl to release the static blast in your TR to increase madness and weed survivors out.
---
you can have same names on DBD (steam), me &amp; my Brother did this idk why
---
I feel this so strongly, are you okay lol?
---
HUNTRESS IS SO CUTE!! I love them and will protect them with my life
---
Unbreakable boi
---
Oh right, i haven't been hooked in the basement yet so will be lovely to see that when I get it XD
---
No. I'm not buying a game lol. I'll just play something free to play or something I already have
---
yeah i already replied, correcting my dumb ass
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e5nc1k/new_bug_where_you_get_transported_to_the_shadow/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
And I wouldn‚Äôt mind that because I hate tapping
---
Oh I didnt know cause I'm a Consle pleb lol.
---
I'm a simple man, you basement hook me I kill myself.
---
I love the attention to detail. Im super into this
---
This happened when I got unhooked
---
I was never planning on using that perk anyways. Just slapping someone with the bleedout timer and waiting for them to get downed isn't how you're suppose to play them. The bleed is only suppose to be a hindrance and to get in the way of the survivors objectives. I'll also only ever use the power if I know there is more than 1 survivor in the area.
---
Can only use it once, though.
---
Nah spirit, someone got this in my next game against an Oni tho
---
why doc got short stories for his addons
---
What's the double blade bug?
---
Ok first of all the oni's attack isn't the same sound as a trap it is actually two metal spoons scraping against each other.
---
Second, did you bother to look what perks he was using to see if he had whispers or spies?
---
Oh yeah? I think its fine bc you only get a few of them every 7 or so bloodwebs
---
I dc‚Äôd from a match and got no ban?
---
I think people are getting a wrong impression of Oni because he actually requires some mechanical skill to play well. Sorry, but many of the popular streamers do not often possess such skill, nor does the average player, and so Oni might seem underwhelming.
---
Check out this VoD: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/516550048 - he's clubbing people. And keep an eye out for ZubatLEL to stream at some point too, who should also be able to show that Oni is still brutal.
---
First few days everyone will be, after that she will equalize with other survivors.
---
Stop shilling. It‚Äôs absolutely unacceptable to ask people to deal with a bug of this magnitude for a week or two, especially when you‚Äôre threatening to give them escalating bans for disconnecting.
---
You literally can not play once you get basement hooked.
---
he‚Äôs not weak at all and he is a pretty fun killer because of his pounce
---
Maybe i‚Äôm just playing devil‚Äôs advocate, but why is it fair that people are still able to unlock the hallowed blight/catalyst &amp; year-of-the-pig cosmetics when i earned them through their respective events. Idk maybe i‚Äôm just SOL but i just wish i had a chance to get them as well.
---
Probably never because they can't make matchmaking too wide otherwise people bitch about it being unfair.
---
I actually haven't noticed that yet. Are you sure it's not because you're using the Iridescent Stone addon? When it resets a trap, it tends to move them slightly.
---
Actually it happens more often than you think, about 3 games in 10
---
Really? Damn, I'm on xbox that really sucks. I'm tired of having people leave killer or survivor. Just ruins the fun üòë was really looking forward to that update. Thanks for the info
---
Well its not going to be funny (if it ever was) now that I explain it... but it was just a dumb "Dad joke" e.g. If you were to say "I'm aware" and then I take it as you're saying your name is "Aware". A more common one, as opposed to the above, would be "Hi Aware, I'm Dad!"
---
Best. Patch. Ever.
---
I think he‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt really think Demo is meant to be a stealth killer, considering that when he bursts through a portal it makes a big mess. The undetectable status is just an extra bonus that punishes survivors who aren‚Äôt observant. 
---
Demo is really really strong when he‚Äôs defending the last 1 or 2 gens. Like I‚Äôve had games where I got genrushed (I don‚Äôt have Ruin unlocked) by SWF groups. But as so as they hit the last gen there was literally nothing they could do, Demo has really good close range control
---
Need a ***CLANG*** sound effect when a survivor is hit with this sword
---
Yes but with that perk that makes people louder you can easily hunt people down.
---
Yea just sucks when he‚Äôs legit patrolling the hook
---
Doesn't Francis have distortion? This seems like a fairtly important stealth perk
---
Oh god inverted skillchecks will be so awesome and horrible.
---
Okay well I'll just play something else for 2 weeks xD
---
Jesus. 150 ping sounds like heaven on PS4.
---
Can I ask you a genuine question. If it took 5-10 minutes minimum at peak time to find a lobby and then the killers on PC master race lobby dodged you so that you couldn't play the game, would you feel a little annoyed that you were just sat there hoping that someone else would give you permission to play the game that you had paid for? I imagine you would, especially since you don't play killer as often.
---
Now imagine you get dodged 3 times in a row. Would you start to feel a little exasperated?
---
If not, you have the patience of a saint.
---
I've had it before where I have managed to get into two games in an hour and a half. All because the lobbies were dodged. It starts to get a little boring. And then throw in a couple of moris for those games and hey ho! The killer base has stopped me playing as a survivor. At least with SWFs you can still play the game.
---
&gt; The easiest fix is to make the struggle phase automatic to where you can't just suicide.
---
yeah, this is something i said elsewhere. but i think the issue is that bhvr doesn't wanna force people to sit around doing nothing until someone else does something for that person (i.e. unhooking them). and ofc there is always force closing
---
Lol i see threads constantly complaining about the matchmaking pairing up players with unfair rank differences.....    then if they make the difference smaller people will complain about the wait times....    choose 1..
---
That only has 3 stacks tho and against some killer perks, is drained very quick. It‚Äôs not reliable enough
---
+1
---
You must not have played the new map... very dark and tall grass literally everywhere. 4k'd a group of reds on it, but it was way more difficult than it should have been
---
No one thinks he's bad? Not anymore anyway. Stats released recently show he's the second best killer apparently.
---
On of the ingredients is mercury lol
---
Look how they massacred my boy. Why does BHVR hate poor innocent Trapper?
---
Everyone's hiding and Bill's in the corner like "I don't give a fuuuck."
---
Yes but the game is completely broken now, so don't know how long you will find lobbies
---
Tunnel* autocorrect üôÑ
---
The annoying thing about flashlights is how they make you drop survivors... Most of the game stuff makes at least some sense, but "I cannot see, better drop the person I'm holding" never made sense to me. I didn't even realise that was how it worked the first time I got blinded with a survivor on my back and I was bewildered
---
Well if your trying to play killer everyone probably is rn
---
Since so many people like it, and a few are asking me if I sell them on... I might sell them for 25-30 bucks on Etsy. 
---
Since the inside of the mask isn't pretty, and it's kinda hard to see (Especially in the dark.), I'm gonna make it pretty cheap. If people like the look of them though, I can make em xD
---
That‚Äôs cuz she just screams decisive strike
---
they are not giving away the event cosmetics.
---
Same happened to me mate lol
---
I only play ghostface when i have these add ons. And its just like every other bar add on, same as spirit, oni, and plague. It allows them to use the power more often (which is the only thing ghostsface has going for him btw) its nice not having to wait 30 seconds to get my power back.
---
The thing is, I can easily get pallet blinds and shit, but for some reason when going for the holding a survivor blind with that build, it either does the pulse and doesn't count or I can do what I just did with a very cooperative Myers and shine it right in his face and nothing happen, the Myers even confirmed he was blinded but I never got credit nor did it pulse so, I have no idea if this is bugged on PS4 or there is something going wrong.
---
Teabagging is basically asking for it, and im a survivor main
---
No it has no texture but ivory would be sick
---
Sorry for my delayed response!
---
After the BBQ event, bhvr decided to make future exclusives purchasable because they wanted to push to reduce in game exclusivity. Thats why the blight cosmetics are earnable and purchasable. While I don't like the idea of buying cosmetics that you should earn, I understand that this is to reduce overall exclusives. I feel bad for anyone who put money in the grey market to get a cosmetic to have the same cosmetics just be free- but thats a bad investment on their parts. I respect bhvr for not making bloodletting or former event items free as well, as those were either sold or earned prior. At the very least, we all get a ton of cool cosmetics for free like gold feng. So thats cool.
---
And yeah, david had a former korean exclusive jacket. Its surprisingly nice
---
Damn, I don‚Äôt play for a year and he becomes the best?
---
#Vibe Check
---
Everybody gangsta until the big boy materialises behind u and grabs u off a gen
---
At your own risk, people get banned for this kind of stuff too.
---
first one
---
Don't care
---
Except not letting BHVR put Bill on console at all for the first two entire years lol
---
I didn't say "all", hence why I used " a lot". I know about the tome challenge and I'm glad I don't have to do it.
---
Eh too early to tell imo but he seems pretty balanced nothing is really unique about him but design and the way he gains his ability
---
Hahaha, people just can't wait to complain about something not working.
---
Yup same here
---
What are you talking about, none of these were event cosmetics
---
This looks like those toy miniatures you get to paint at hobby stores
---
That is not true, some of my friends had to make new accounts just to play again. Dont risk it unless you dont care.
---
i tbag every spirit, she isnt fun for the survivors and most of the time i feel like the players playing her dont deserve to be in red ranks, so i just tbag and bm till i die bc i get "mindgamed"
---
Yes. I will also nod my head at them. Don't teabag if you can't handle the consequences
---
I tunnel anyone i want....    am i supposed to hook every survivor equally so that everyone is alive 90% of the match and can get gens done within 7 min?
---
I havent vsd any one good at the game with him yet so i havent been able to say. But Yui on the other hand seems ok just had a ghost face that didint break pallets so i was able to go around reseting them and my team was able to use them. Im going to try run a mettle of man &amp; breakout to see how that goes. But onis actually scary to go against after seeing what he can do on the test server but now its just waiting for people to get good with him for him to become a threat
---
That‚Äôs fire
---
And neither does anybody else about you posting this for the 35th time.
---
Yea though dc bans are a thing random dcs are just gonna hurt the community especially if you get longer and longer bans with each dc
---
I‚Äôm in purple ranks for survivor on pc and all my queues are almost always &lt; 30 seconds, I‚Äôm not sure why its different if you‚Äôre playing survivor too.
---
On killer I usually get 5-10 minute queues at yellow rank, but thats probably less matchmaking and more the distribution in how many players want to play killer.
---
Why be toxic and stay just leave you lucky he didn‚Äôt have franklins
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be
---
Legion Changes - Deleted from the game
---
Your on a hook in the basement what more is there to that match?
---
I was hoping this would be live by now
---
brain so big they had to enlarge the head just to make it fit in
---
Not unless it makes sense to tunnel. I'm out to maximize blood points and pips. I can kill any 1 survivor by throwing a game and that is what toxic players want you to do.
---
Most toxic players are usually not that problematic out of position so I'll just kill the weak people on the team first.
---
I feel like playing a game and losing rank and blood points is a waste of time so I only tunnel *bad* toxic players because I can still win the game doing it
---
I guess someone at bhvr really hated playing against legion
---
It is when we're just dicking around and not being tryhards about it.  Especially with challenges to do.
---
Survivors: Wait... That's Illegal.
---
How would they know it's SFW? Communication isn't done through the game so exactly how do they nerf it?
---
Aight
---
You‚Äôre right, I apologize. DC bans don‚Äôt start until the 5th, and I don‚Äôt value the overwhelming negativity I see on this subreddit, but I have to agree that it is unacceptable.
---
A couple survivors did this to me on console and they texted me to quit when I finally got them both I slugged them and let them bleed out them they called me a camper so I told them who‚Äôd I camp no one was gonna pick u up if I had left . Some survivors just love to complain no matter how u play
---
**This video is private**
---
Well it aids for survivor. I'm absolutely sick of never being chased by ghostface's. They just hit you off shit so you feel like you never even played the game. It's really really unfun.
---
Even bhvr forgot plague
---
Downvoting....    sick of seeing this being posted 100 times already
---
He problably ran off after somebody right after hitting you lmao
---
Yeah lol. He got a major re-work and plays totally differently now! You should check him out, he's a nightmare, pun intended
---
LOL, not worry about it? You have video proof they were holding the game hostage so that's it.
---
Yes because Demo is cool and there aren't enough of them imo. 
---
I went against a Demogorgon with Knockout once; I thought it was a pretty cool build because it made it even harder to tell where he was and where was safe to go
---
Happens with a lot of games,updates change things and sometimes some bugs go unnoticed,I'm sure they'll fix things ASAP
---
Who lives in a madhouse, making you scream?
---
*Herman Carter, shocking-pants.*
---
Completey insane and jolly is he
---
Weak sauce
---
They can tell who's doing a DC on purpose VS unexpected server or internet issues
---
I cracked the fuck up reading that one, it‚Äôs so simple but so mean, I love it
---
Pantless shirtless Myers
---
It's a joke
---
The devs actually said they're fine with custom perk icons IIRC. That being said that could change at any time but as it currently stands it should be fine.
---
I kinda dislike him now since ptb. They removed the one thing that made him useful: his demon strike lunge. Well, they didn't *remove* it, but they made it to where you have almost no control when you are doing it. The flick is gone, it feels really bad when playing him knowing he was so good before and now he's probably mid tier from that one thing alone. Hoping I'm just wrong about his viability and need to adjust, but he feels bad compared to ptb imo.
---
yup same thing here
---
He is weak. I don't know why survivor mains are so insistent otherwise (oh wait, yes I do)
---
He was decent. Yes the 7 second delay was an issue (Range addons were good since you could start the sleep transition from very far away and they were already vulnerable by the time you caught up) but OG Freddy mains focused on the long game. 
---
During the 7 second transition Freddy could mindgame with the glimpses. Being asleep means you work at 50% speed at the VERY MOST, + Freddy knows where you are outside of the terror radius. 
---
Waking up means you fail a skill check (Which alerts Freddy who will likely re-sleep you) or have an awake survivor manually wake you. There's no notification but your aura does crouch in a distinct manner, and a decent Freddy will often check or glance at survivor auras to see who's doing what. Someone being woken up means I will rush over there as fast as possible to re-sleep the survivor, and try to sleep the other survivor too. 
---
Freddy had a small terror radius (IIRC it was 24 meters, 16 meters with M&amp;A, and 0 meters with M&amp;A + Red Paint Brush) and he can use this to his advantage to constantly juggle targets and otherwise "ambush" survivors trying to self-care a skillcheck to wake up or are in an area away from loops looking for a generator or other survivor because I didn't even hit them yet to deny the self-care wakeup. The dream world was also much more obnoxious with the fog and mist, and Freddy's small stature combined with the small TR made him pretty sneaky. 
---
Yes he had major weaknesses like being unable to defend totems and hooks but to be fair you shouldn't be camping with Freddy anyway, although I often returned to the hook to re-sleep the unhooked survivor and rescuer since with OG Freddy you wanted 2+ survivors asleep at any one time.
---
Freddy's "endgame" was to stall for massive amounts of time. Yes he was only an M1 killer but he was good at getting that first hit, and when survivors are ground to an absolute halt (Both from dream world stall + Freddy's tracking allowing you to always be after a survivor and harassing people off gens) no real progress can be made as you get pallets dropped (I didn't ruin Ruin or Enduring Spirit Fury). It's only a matter of time until all the pallets are gone and several generators are left.
---
Freddy had to be played very unconventionally but I liked how I COULD afford to disengage from a chase if I think the survivor is wasting too much time. Other killers, it feels like you have to a commit to a chase even if it ends up being all 5 gens because otherwise all your effort was for nothing. With Freddy I could simply run away and go after someone else (The survivor has to find a way to wake up or might move to a dead-zone) and come back later, and I still was being effective since everyone's making very little progress on their objectives and I am slowly hooking other survivors.
---
And thus an addition to r/Animemes Oni-chan is hungry.
---
So spine chill or premonition? I've had good results with using both. I like premonition since I'll know which way the killer is coming from and will be able to circle around on them. The cool down time wasn't really a problem, but if you're in a chase premonition goes off which seems counter productive. It'd be nice if they made it only activate out of chases. Spine chill is always on, but unless you're playing in close walled map you won't know which way the killer is coming. You could start trying to move away, but could end up closing the distance especially if killers are running a small terror radius
---
KINDRED THO
---
Oh noooooo hahaahhah
---
Deep wound timer now doesn't run down while survivors run. But, judging by your flair, you're probs a troll ü§°
---
It doesn't matter if you're "being tryhards". Either you're just LETTING the killer kill you, which isn't fun, or you're playing at a higher level than they are and that's not fun either. 
---
When I was a new killer, it was always best when I played against people near my experience level.
---
Just run Spine Chill.
---
Now you see the Killer looking at you can know when to stop healing.
---
On the PS4. Just happend to me. On first hook in basement, screen went white a bit and then black and the camera was in the sky. When unhooked, it showed me in falling animation until the killer hit me and hooked me again and everything went back to normal.
---
Yea I can vouch after I got to purple ranks game searching has been longer but not 45 min it went from like 10 seconds to a min or two
---
The new map is so damn dark. Give it the lighting of the other yamakoa at least. Map us already hard enough to find people on
---
Before Oni release: "omg I can't wait for ONI to be released! I'm so gonna main him!"
---
After Oni release:"he looks so out of place. Oni is annoying. Etc."
---
Man do I love this community!
---
Yeah as a survivor main I see what everyone is saying, I‚Äôm very very new to the game so I‚Äôm just trying out different killers atm. I‚Äôm not good by any means so I think that‚Äôs why I get people being toxic too. I try so hard not to be toxic, I don‚Äôt tunnel, half the time I‚Äôm in the match to just be friendly haha
---
HE CHONK
---
I was never gonna use this perk build anyways since it seems really boring but the fact that they nerfed legion more even after the on-hit changes has me kind of appalled
---
It's almost like the deep wounds mechanic was a mistake.
---
Sorry I just don‚Äôt think of it as a way of saying thank you. I‚Äôll give you my item though if you are the mvp if the team.
---
I'm not saying toxicity can't warrant toxicity, i'm saying teabagging is still toxic, even in the cases where it might be justified to be toxic back. It's like giving the middle finger, it's still rude even if it's warranted.
---
And for the record i've never facecamped and I don't tunnel. If i'm that tilted, I usually just leave the game instead of doing either of those.
---
what are you going to do with that big stick oni-chan
---
People who play characters they enjoy that are weaker are the people that come these forums to ask for builds because they don't understand how to make a shitty character good... and half the time the correct build on a killer doesn't take away that deep down it'll always be weak character that will never amount to anything much.
---
That sounds like a bug. Bummer man.
---
and they made the time to mend smaller for that reason too? So it ruins the one "positive" you are talking about lol
---
HUHUHUHUHUHUHUHUHUHUHUHUHUH
---
HUHUHUHU
---
Yeah! Half the people teabagging aren‚Äôt even good. I don‚Äôt mind as much if they‚Äôre amazing at looping, but they‚Äôre not!
---
Yeah, I don't care if people play Billy or Nurse because they take actual skill.
---
Lol second post about it today therefore flooding maybe I‚Äôll post some more
---
Shut up baby, I know it
---
Because why waste money on bug testing when your consumers are going to buy the DLC at full price and bug test it for you?
---
Want devs to stop releasing buggy shit?  Stop buying buggy shit.
---
same
---
I'm just telling you my experience learning killer. It absolutely sucked playing against SWF teams, whether they were tryhards or not. I think its just better when people play with other people at their own skill level. I'm sorry you feel you should be able to play with killers far below your own experience level to have fun.
---
what do you mean?
---
THIS. The amount of survivors I‚Äôve already had ratting others out, it‚Äôs so unfair. As a survivor it‚Äôs happened to me a LOT so I will always go for the snitch.
---
I've only been playing since the month of September and the devs seem to have made multiple bad decisions during that time. How has anybody been playing for years not quit yet?
---
oh you're right i missed that. that's a very weird choice
---
Best feeling when they aren‚Äôt even good to back it up
---
Don't fret ragequitters and DC-ers now get bans! You won't be seeing them for a while after they do! It'll take a little while to filter out the shitlords, but after that this game will become so much better!
---
thats very sweet of you, but people will BM you if you play spirit, playing her will get you lots of hate since soooo many people hate her.
---
She is 2 easy and wayyyyyy 2 unfair. If you want to play a easyish killer that can do well in high ranks, i suggest Billy or freddy. Billy is a lot harder to learn but he is so much fun, and everyone loves him
---
Oooh I‚Äôll make sure I don‚Äôt buy any toxic outfits for my survivors then...
---
I love when you miss two Skillchecks in a row because your a smooth brain and everyone stops working on the gen to point and bounce at you, and you have to respond with your own Bouncing Bow to accept that your brain is like that of a Koala.
---
id take a god nurse to a decent spirit any day
---
I understand that point, but when it takes longer to get into a killer game than it does a survivor game then it would suggest that the 4:1 ratio doesn't really come into play.
---
Can't say I've suffered with queue times on RL. But again, understand your point.
---
it doesn't need to affect the game for it to be toxic though.
---
It's just REALLY upsetting when you genuinely try your best, but get completely outplayed and the whole time the survivors are clicking flashlights and teabagging constantly. It doesn't have to affect the game to be bullying. Then of course they FINALLY leave the gate instead of taunting you and it's all "gg ez" "shit killer" "what an idiot" in the lobby chat immediately. It's just.. sometimes it's just a bit much if you're already sensitive to esteem issues you know?
---
No worries, it's my bad for not putting /s
---
I just can't get behind a killer that can win by standing still.
---
If your goal is to get better you'll only stagnate playing agasint the same skill level.  If you don't play against better survivors you'll never learn how to beat them.
---
I'm not talking about a rank 4 v rank 20s here, but frankly the game no longer becomes fun to play past rank 10 from a casual point of view.
---
Yeah that makes sense. I‚Äôm just really petty and will happily throw a match to annoy someone who‚Äôs being toxic üòÇ
---
Its literally one guy saying it...
---
Sometimes DS doesnt even make an Obsession. I have had times where I pick someone up because there are no Entity Claws and they DS me anyway.
---
If they just removed the sprint burst part and kept the exhausted part I'd be fine with it. Otherwise having Balanced be passive + you could run another exhaustion perk would be absurd.
---
Yeah! I‚Äôm a surv main and I genuinely hate seeing people do it because I‚Äôm worried the killer will take it out on the whole team.
---
Ace is for true gamers
---
I love the theme, but I do wish we would go back to our roots and make a serial killer more like in the slasher movies (trapper, Legion, etc)
---
just a tip: if you want to make this face \&gt;W&lt; you have to add a \ before it :D
---
Reddit formatting is wild
---
how can anyone lagsswitch now when dedicated servers are a thing?
---
it's no different then people typing mean things in the post game chat. It's intended to cause a reaction, and it does. Actions mean things, even if it's "just hitting the crouch key".
---
Should it affect you? not at all, but not everyone has a thick skin to that stuff. Instead of "just ignore it", why not ask the people acting that way "just stop being rude" instead?
---
Nurses calling, ruin, BBQ, the last perk can be pretty much anything like discordance, sloppy, deer stalker, HG to cover ruin, tinkerer could be somewhat good on him. Oni is pretty much Billy if he used some kind of slugger build imo
---
just out of curiosity, what platform are you on?
---
That‚Äôs a really good way of thinking actually. They want your attention to be annoying so it makes a lot of sense to just ignore them
---
Not a big nerf he is one of the strongest now but i guess spirit and freddy are still in a better position we will se in the next weeks when people get used to him
---
I don‚Äôt mind him I just think they need to fix the chase music and his sounds, so overwhelming
---
I said this before he came out the moment I saw him and I'm not the whole community wtf..
---
There's a difference between playing against better players within your own skill bracket, and playing against 4 man SWF teams that deranked from 1 to 14. 
---
Look at all the SWF squads that used to be on Twitch bullying new killers. Do you think those killers "learned" anything playing against those players?
---
I don't understand why killers would DC at all even a bad game gets you some BP and if Survivors don't want to DC they can always let themselves be hooked and throw the game that way. Then they get reported after the game is over and maybe even get a penalty that way... This Ban system can only make the game better imho!
---
Wait I don't understand, how does it make it even worse than before? They removed the reliance on being in the terror radius and now you have to be sprinting or mending for it to go down. That kinda seems like a win to me.
---
Lmao maybe cool it.
---
Because disconnecting is like a virus.
---
One person has players disconnect him when hes winning, so when hes having a shit game he decides to disconnect too, then he affects others and so on and so on.
---
The game was allowed to get into the state that its in because devs were sloppy with punishments.
---
I think a lot of people are salty because the general rule in DBD is that you‚Äôre allowed to lose but you‚Äôre not allowed to win. Oh no if you have a good start the opposing side will disconnect.
---
ManüòÇ people are too creative in this community
---
This changes nothing as everyone would be flagged.
---
Clicking on the game in the Xbox app, I saw a line of text above the play button that starts the update. Something like "update available". My friend and I downloaded the update but can't seem to join a match for some reason, fyi
---
Happened to me and my friend as well. I managed to guide him out of there even though all he saw was falling,but he couldn't do gens.
---
Yeah. Balanced Landing is usually really good (Haddonfield, The Game, Hawkins) or complete dogshit (Shelter Woods, Autohaven maps, coldwind farms, and some MacMillan maps). There didn't seem to be an in between.
---

Yeah I‚Äôll give them a go! I‚Äôve played some billy and I did really enjoy playing him. I like Michael too. Yeah I hate going against spirit if I‚Äôm honest, I‚Äôve been playing her also to try and understand her mechanics better so that as a survivor I know how she works (if that makes sense) so I can counter her better.
---
I had to check my graphics settings i thought they got reset to ultra.

No. The maps just really fucking dark.

Twitch is cancer, for every game.  Don't get your impression of the game or the people playing it from twitch.  They're dicks on purpose because that's what attracts viewers.

Two question where‚Äôs ash and WHY doesn‚Äôt all killer have a Christmas sweater like Demo and ghostface he can even wear his over his cloak and the clown could have one huntress aww that could have been awesome but sadly no
---
I wish there was a option to skip the video so it goes straight to the game. Or at least load the game while the cinematic is playing
---
You need to be in front of the killer, the flashlight is not supposed to work from the sides.

I just wasted 15 bucks getting the three newest killers because I don‚Äôt play enough to get the good perks on them. :(

I think it makes you the obsession post you using it if you aren‚Äôt already
---
Great...more bugs....now I gotta download the patch to fix those bugs on top of the Oni update that's 12GB that will take 6 hours to download . Smfh
---
It doesn't change Legion at all. They were gonna mend in your face if you were gonna insidious them to death, or they were gonna run from you anyways when you tried to m1 them. I'd argue it's a small buff because you have to mend or run before continuing the objective instead of sitting in a killers terror radius doing a generator.
---
cause it is. Don't get me wrong it was a good concept they went for but they overdid it with the nerfs because they got PTSD from old Legion's whiplash.

When a baby Dwight sandbags another baby Dwight
---
oh yea thats really smart, that works with almost every other killer. she is a special case though, she is entirely luck based.
---
Survivors cant see her, or even know when she is using her ability so you are at a loss constantly. I suggest just dropping her and learning billy/mike since those are both good choices! i suggest Ghostface, he is basically a much better version of mike
---
Did you read the changes? Nemesis can‚Äôt cheese. If anything Legion‚Äôs Power is worse.

if you are playing to win? BBQ. you really dont need Arua reading if you just go to the damn engines.

I played as Wraith yesterday in the Suffocation Pit of the Macmillan Estate and had a similar situation. 
---
I was trying to do the rift challenge of hooking 2 survivors during the endgame collapse using NOED. I had spent too much time preparing to beat this challenge, using the silent bell and generator monitoring add-ons, and burning the offering that removes two chests from the map. I memorized the characters that I would be facing in the lobby, as well as the items they brought in, and the offerings they made (all of which were just for blood-points). I thought this would be a good match for everyone--they would get a bunch of blood points in the objective category, and my play style of chasing each survivor twice, hooking them, and allowing others to rescue and heal them would give the survivors plenty of blood-points in boldness and altruism.  They would all get some survival points for wiggling and struggling, and two of them would probably get a lot of survival points.
---
Once the trial began, I set to work optimizing my chances of completing the challenge by making sure everyone would be on their last hook when the end game collapse began, and heavily patrolling generators so that three generators next to an exit gate would be the last ones remaining. The trial was going well, I had two survivors who would be dead on their next hook, and I had just downed the other two survivors--a Nancy and a Lorrie--and put them on their second hooks away from the three generators I wanted to save for the end, while easily patrolling those three generators. After a minute the other two survivors--David and Feng--finished the fourth and next to last generator. I stayed in stealth to keep my terror radius suppressed, turned and faced one of the corners next to the exit gates so the survivor's spine chill wouldn't light up, and didn't move so my shimmer wouldn't tip them off. I was hoping the healthy survivors would save the hooked survivors and finish a generator. Apparently I had freaked them out once too often during the trial with my sound-less bell, because they let the Nancy die, and Lorrie was not long for the world.
---
All of a sudden David's icon showed that he had escaped. The hatch had spawned right next to a generator he must have been working on (at least I hope that was what he was doing rather than rescuing one of the two hooked survivors), so David decided to use a key he found in the only chest that spawned, and yeeted out. I don't blame him. Fortunately I found the hatch in about three seconds, and closed it as the entity was lifting Lorrie's body into the air.  The Rift decided that Lorrie counted as an end-game sacrifice. To my luck, Feng had apparently heard the hatch as well, because she ran up to it about a second after I had closed it, not realizing I was standing on top of it cloaked. Needless to say, I got my two end-game sacrifices, but it was almost ruined by a stupid key.
---
thanks for the response. i'm also on PC, and have come across a few rage quitting players (on both sides), but definitely not the amount that you have, and i play a few hours a night. i wonder if maybe it's a regional thing?
---
I did this when I was doing a challange to heal myself 10 times. I ended up looping the other people.
---
Hm, alr
---
not the nemesis message, the message that the rest of the changes were shit.
---
His better then before. I played him 3 games today after the update and I went against SWF, 2 legacy, and rank 1s. All my games I end up with 3-4Ks and pipped on all of them. People can disagree with me but legion is doing just fine right now. Addons: broken effect and extra duration. Perks: ruin, thanphobia, bbq, pop goes the weassle are great you can also switch BBQ to dying light for even more slow. This is what legion is supposed to be, someone who is annoying to deal with and make the game go on for a Good amount of time
---
if anything that makes Haddonfield fair
---
I'd offer him a drink for banishing whatever the fuck ghost girl that was.
---
**Legion:** *"What is my purpose?"*

**BHVR:** *"You buff Borrowed Time."*

Well regardless of anything else you said people can still DC all they want on Console because we're not getting any punishments anytime soon. Those were only for PC and switch which have dedicated servers. Xbox and PS4 haven't even been announced when they're going to try dedicated servers on. So for the moment people can still DC to their little hearts content.
---
I‚Äôm blue
---
it's a dedicated servers issue
---
I had one on the Coldwin Farm map with the Silo as plague, where the distance between gens was less than 25 meters, and I could Vomit on all three of them with out moving with ease, worst yet, a corrupted pool in the middle.
---
Sadly the hatch was in bum-fuck nowhere and they plundered a key.
---
How do you define a toxic player? 
---
I hate mori‚Äôs and iridescent addons too but i dont think killers/survivors should be punished for using an item in it‚Äôs intended way.
---
When I'm playing survivor, no I can't. When I'm playing killer, yes you can. And through walls too.

They nerfed her Balanced Lansing perk but she‚Äôs still too strong! üò§üò≠

Which map was it? I think I had one of the MacMillian Estates and it was fine on my launch PS4. Maybe even the bug is RNG? I‚Äôll probably run in to another basement hook eventually as I‚Äôm trying to get the stupid flashlight save challenge.
---
Of course. I was just using that as an example. But even excluding Twitch, there was tons of people with 1000+ hours who would derank as low as possible. I had about a dozen friends start playing the game and quit because they were sick of playing against people **way** above their skill level. That's not good for the community.
---
That's because the game doesn't see killing the survivors as the only goal. It used to be the only goal, back in the day with the victory cube, but the devs didn't like the gameplay style that it incentivized so they changed the goal to reflect a more balanced playstyle. You, as a player, get to either see ranking up as a win or getting kills as a win, but the devs have decided that getting kills is not the only goal anymore.
---
I was once told this only works if the dlc was bought via the playstation store... not if you buy it through the game or with shards or cells.

Not sure how true it is.

But also go to the psn store make sure you downloaded the chapter

"Deep Wound timer will no longer go down when Sprinting or while Mending. Deep Wound is no longer connected with the Killers terror radius."

---
Nah it's fine the way it is. It speaks volumes how some samurais valued honored in the past, In a war torn era.
---
I was hoping someone would put a berserk reference
---
I'd honestly rather them give numbers for everything. There's so many places where they could expand on information, but they don't.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
- How long does it take to heal another survivor?  
---
- How long does it take to cleanse a totem?  
---
- What percentage does the drainage of the Flashlight's battery decrease by using the Low-amp Filament decrease?
---
These are just a few examples, and I could keep going. I just REALLY wish there was someplace in-game I could go to find these numbers. Having to go to an external source to find exact numbers is incredibly frustrating. They could easily put these in the tutorial or something.
---
Yeah that‚Äôd be really cool changes must be made
---
I see, i'll reainstall, i think my xbox app bugged :(

I dont believe they can find a form of nerf legion again he is trash in all the possible ways

Monitor and abuse is good to jump scare people due to the smaller terror radius

Ah yes, enough bp to buy 1 addon for the Oni, that changes everything
---
As somebody who has dealt with video game code, it is incredibly difficult to change anything without something messing up because if you change one thing then something else gets messed up and by fixing stuff and adding new mechanics it creates new openings for problems. The Devs do a great job so I know it sucks to hear but try and be patient.

I don't think BHVR having a dc penalty is saying something about the playerbase at all.  Most games I know have one in place BHVR is just slow on adding one

Change.org anyone?

Yes but it also causes someone to be the obsession, which is the part that is important, because to a killer that means "at least one player has decisive" if they aren't running any obsession perks themselves
---
The game before this I crashed after getting hit by the new killer once
---
The whole power isn‚Äôt going in the trash, not everyone will be running the whole time, you still have to do gens and by then you will have to stop and mend. Barely anyone ever gets downed from not mending, tons of people would get downed from nemesis legion and it would be broken and unfair. You said it yourself that one perk makes him broken, this is BHVR‚Äôs fix for that.
---
Boil over and flip flop
---
*determined noises* 
---
*Can't move kanabo*

^^^wahh
---
And instead of, you know, addressing the problems these addons/perks create with the power and giving the guy a proper rework you give him a big nerf instead, while already not being OP.
---
Just Freddy Krueger now, or the nightmare.
---
My point is that the developers disagree with you about what constitutes a win. Some people think a 4k is a win and some people think a white pip is a win, but they cant both be right. As for killers being weaker I personally think the game is fairly balanced nowadays and the recent kill rate stats released support my opinion. If you think that a 4k is the goal and a win then I don't really see why you would care if you ranked up, higher rank just means harder matches and fewer 4ks.
---
it‚Äôs a new skin for the entity i believe
---
LOL, I'm sorry üòÇ.
---
You finally managed to kill all survivors. congrats
---
That‚Äôs 100% false.
---
My team were real good sports when I explained what happened, but even still this was definitely a new one and yes, it didn't stop until I inevitably died.
---
I‚Äôm not saying all of that in a combination isn‚Äôt toxic. I‚Äôm saying teabagging isn‚Äôt. Especially after face camping or killer toxicity that actually impacts the game.
---
IIRC Adept Min used to be Adept Feng, but it was changed. I could be wrong tho
---
Absolutely. I laugh when I see that little horsey in the corner of my screen.
---
Same even after getting unhooked
---
They really shouldn‚Äôt have removed the ability to see survivors' ranks.
---
Nah def think you should she don't look like this old white woman üòÇ.
---
when he injures survivors, they drop blood orbs. Oni consumes the blood orbs to charge his power. once activated it last for about a minute (i think) and he gains the ability to dash around the map and utilize a 1 hit down attack. if he picks up a survivor, it cancels the power until fully charged again
---
I've seen the shadows completely darken a survivor who was wearing regular cosmetics (not dark or light). Also, the doors regularly spawn on the same wall really close together (I know other maps do this but I've been seeing it a LOT on this map)
---
Thats just bug abusing. Whack
---
December 11th
---
When a survivor is injured they drop blood oni has to collect a special amount of blood until he can use he's power. The power makes him one shot and dash around the map
---
This happened when oni picked me up and hooked at base. Also my friend bugged when he hooked at base.
---
Legion need the right perks and addons to win. You need to slow down the game as much as possible with him (ruin, thanphobia, dying light, pop goes the weassle). His still doing Good and many of his addons got a much better effect then before also they buffed his vault speed
---
No, but you leave a blood trail, which is similar but less obvious.

WTF is this post formatting. . .

---
More or less Oni works like this.
---
At the start of the game he is a normal M1 killer with 115% movement speed and nothing else.
---
When he hits a survivor, he gains around 50% of the charge for his power. 
---
While the survivor is injured, they leave blood orbs which the Oni can use to track and collect from the survivor to fuel his power.
---
Once the Oni power is fueled full, he can activate his secondary form, Demon Rage
---
During his rage form, he can;
---
- Do a dash that allows him to sprint as very quickly across the map with limited turning. He can hit you at the end of the dash to insta-down you.
---
- He can instantly down survivors if he lunges while in this form. 
---
- His lunge also allows him to break pallets alittle faster.
---
- He can hit multiple survivors at once with his lunge.
---
- He has an extended lunge. Of which I am not exactly sure. 
---
- He more or less becomes a tier 3 Myers with the ability to dash similar to a billy.
---
- His power only lasts for around 60 seconds and is drained for every survivor he downs. 
---
- Once fully depleted, he returns to being a normal killer and requires blood again to charge up his power.
---
Should have fixed that huh. Oh well.
---
Im having it too it just insta ruins the game as most killers are putting people in there rn for the mission and you can't do anything after being saved.
---
So that‚Äôs why I had a teammate earlier who was wandering around aimlessly in the basement before disconnecting. I wondered what was going on.
---
Uh didnt he just get a huge addon buff? The buttons now apply their status effects when you attack them once instead of twice
---
The problem is that this &lt;&lt;fix&gt;&gt; makes deep wounds completely obsolete. Literally run and you don't have to ever mend and just stop to do it when you want to do a gen or something. It takes less time now to mend anyway and even less when with others so it's even less of a threat and more of an slight inconvenience. Plus, you can't use all the on hit perks you could before because his FF attack doesn't even count as a normal hit anymore.
---
Cosmetic team is not the same team who does bug fixing .

I think they just didn't put him the banner. If you look at last years ugly sweater banner people were missing. I just don't think they had enough space.

As a killer main myself, I get joy from the salt. I cant understand these rage posts. Dont let them get to you, hombre.
---
No. Her bestial roars and grunts are better imo.
---
my queue times have always been garbage so I see no problem
---
In my experience it's basically one part timing and 12,000 parts luck, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, and if you have high ping like you have a friend from another country you like to play with, flashlights are useless items that do nothing
---
Got hooked in basement and ascended to the sky.
---
These posts are getting annoying really quick...
---
Yeah, i actually got rehooked and if the killer grabs you, you come back.... Only to be hooked into oblivion again... And i don't need to spam the button to struggle, i Just stay there in nowhere land Just dying
---
That is SO not the point. The point is they don‚Äôt care about fixing bugs and keeping a healthy player base, as long as dumb people like me and you keep buying cosmetics.
---
Nemesis isn‚Äôt one of those perks though, whenever you get stunned the obsession transfers over to the survivor that stunned you and they get the oblivious status effect for a certain amount of time. If legion can just chase you the whole time while you rapidly go down, thats completely broken. This is a good fix for that so it can‚Äôt be abused. PS when you say &lt;&lt;fix&gt;&gt; it‚Äôs supposed to be ‚Äúfix‚Äù unless you know that already.
---
I was thinking the giggle could add to the cooldown after landing a hit. That being said huntress feels balanced enough.
---
It was their first time using icons and they were banned. I know them, they would risk all their hard work on the account. They thought it was safe.

You're looking good in that sweater, sir!
---
Yo, calm down.
---
Good god the darkness you've witnessed...it scares the Entity itself!
---
So I was solo queuing, and this Bill suddenly wanted to team with the killer, against me. I haven‚Äôt bm‚Äôed anyone or had any kind of toxic behavior against these guys. I messaged the Bill asking him ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù, and his reply was just straight up ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù Then told him he was ruining my, and potentially other people‚Äôs experience. He knew that, and it didn‚Äôt bother him. I get people are toxic, but this is just next level for me.
---
Go into game files on Steam and delete the intro video file
---
Ohhhh that makes sense! Yeah I absolutely will hahaha. I‚Äôve had so many friendly GFs that I wanna do it too
---
Thank you. It‚Äôs just so annoying to destroy a swf, then they tell you that you‚Äôre trash because you didn‚Äôt play by their rules.
---
Thanks! :D
---
Thanks. So while he is in Demon Rage, is a normal m1 a one shot or just when he uses his dash?
---
where do you see that its free? i cant find it
---
I agree completely, also if they are going to ban people for DC then they have to ban for tunneling and campers. Fair is fair.
---
Exactly and if people wanna go out on first hook so be it, it gave me a few extra seconds to maybe finish a gen instead of immediately DC once they hit the ground..
---
Any examples of this? And yeah, tone or known bias will have an effect on how your statements are interpreted.
---
This sub has a strange hate for tru3 and love for otz.
---
I personally like them both. They're both good players that are enjoyable to watch.
---
How do I link it on mobile?
---
well the hitting changes where the only ones that actually did anything, DW never did anything.
---
I‚Äôd say as popular as about Jane maybe? She has a lot of cosmetics that mix well so the fashionistas that play Jane will probably also pick her up.
---
He‚Äôs arguably the best billy on the game currently. Like, seriously. Go watch a video of him playing billy, it‚Äôs magnificent and truly shows why he‚Äôs a top tier killer.
---
I'm on xbox and everyone seems to know
---
Ur talking about the DW timer tho.
---
Everything in this comic is awesome
---
Because of this I‚Äôm planning to not do basement hooks until the hotfix
---
Love the reference :)
---
try using a cable if you‚Äôre using wifi
---
He seems to have a steep learning curve and might be more difficult on console as controlling killers powers on a controller is pretty difficult and once people get used to him he'll be even harder to use, i haven't played him yet but from gameplay I've saw my assumption seems correct.
---
Unavailable from what i've seen though you can get them through the Shrine still.
---
if u/blinkingbat makes Susie legion adorbably, I think I will be content for a very long time. :)
---
It‚Äôs way to far to use a cable cause it‚Äôs all the way outside and around the corner
---
I don‚Äôt understand BHVR sometimes.

no?
---
Mmmmmmm saaaalt
---
That's a very good idea. It would be nice if they added some sort of mechanic that would increase your survivability if the killer is face camping. Maybe even the odds of you getting off the hook are increased and you have haste for a little bit to get out of the killers striking distance
---
Also glad they finally replaced the CG opening as I got bored seeing the same one each time the game loads.
---
When you say you're not high, but the police officer knows you're lying.
---
It replaces Exhaustion, So this is a big nerf
---
As reference, what rank are you ?
---
You are playing a frustrating, already toxic to face killer and add Franklin's and a Mori on top of that. Yes. You are toxic. I play both sides equally, by the way. I only ever bring Franklin's if there's a key and save my Moris for toxic SWF I've had multiple run ins with.
---
I dont feel like you enjoy playing this game at all by looking at your ranking XD
---
Tru3 constantly complains about the other side while Otz points out even the imperfections in his own side which is mainly killer. Plus Tru3 isn‚Äôt compassionate at all while Otz is caring and makes a ton of explanation and build videos. That‚Äôs why we love Otz
---
Oh man, I love to run Stake Out as my 4th perk and the "Calm" add-on makes me drool
---
Resources are given to the teams that generate revenue over retention. Business 101.   Keep buying shitty cosmetics, and they will keep cranking them out faster than you can consume.
---
examples of the same criticism?
---
Playing Franklins is not toxic in anyway people just don‚Äôt like the perk. 
---
2. The Mori well idk it sounds like everyone got a fair game. And well you have your reasons which they don‚Äôt know. 
---
But it could be perceived as toxic but since I see your side of the story I don‚Äôt perceive it as toxic. 
---
Lastly who cares, you don‚Äôt think think your toxic, I don‚Äôt think your toxic just move on and continue to use Franklins Demise if you so well please.
---
if survivors can lift pallets up killers should be able to hide in lockers!
---
So survivors getting a win for doing jack shit is good same with the killer getting hurt for something completely out of there hand that‚Äôs good
---
The doctor cant close his eyes they are pulled open forever
---
*50,000,000
---
(Sorry, the last zero on the right hurt my ocd cuz it wasn't there)
---
I would say yes do to he‚Äôs super good once you get a handle to him and I‚Äôm on Xbox and I main billy and he feels a lot like Billy‚Äôs lvl of difficulty to learn
---
Again, only had spirit for a few days and only had an ebony. Wanted to try it. I wasn't using op add-ons, just charge speed.
---
I see you are a low rank survivor. For your level, this is probably accurate.
---
I think it would be great but you could only use frenzy to injure and not do deep wounds. It still wouldn't down you if youre already injured
---
And my post about a week ago gets 400+ upvotes lol
---
Gg man

Frenzy is a power attack, so it is normal that you don't just apply effects directly through your attacks, just live every other killer power attack. You can use the pins to give them status effects tho.

#**[Subreddit Update - Rule 8: Oversaturated Content Addition - Tier Lists](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dr1zmk/subreddit_update_rule_8_oversaturated_content/)**
---
Or touch my fucking totem.
---
True literally plays both sides
---
LMFAOOO
---
The changes woulda been fine if they didn‚Äôt Buff Borrowed Time again as a result of Legion‚Äôs power being fundementally broken.
---
Oh that‚Äôs better than I though ngl
---
Tru3 just whines about everything in general
---
Im talking about playing legion here
---
When your outside the spirit‚Äôs husk terror radius, spirit sounds like a vacuum when she‚Äôs near
---
Moris are stupid, but not toxic.
---
Toxic is an attitude not a build.
---
If They're good enough to counter DS
---
Wait is the oni on regular now?
---
Can't they just for once take a 3-4 months release break and just fix everything that has been a mess for a while now: maps and totem spawns, bugs where killers or survivors get stuck (happened to me on both sides), disconnects, matchmaking ...
---
If it is just their addiction to sweet sweet money, I can promise I'll buy a useless cosmetic each month, but just for once polish what you have instead of crapping out more half assed content
---
Have you tried using a wireless adapter with 4G connection and a usage plan on ? I used that when I was studying and lived in a sort of a dorm with shared internet, as long as you keep it to strictly gaming you won't use up your bandwith quota. I managed to get around 70-90 ms with that connection which was pretty damn solid compared to the crazy pings you could get when people started using torrents etc.
---
Yet he complains more about killer perks and builds and barely talks about survivors, the only time he really does is whenever he misses an attack he always says ‚Äúah dead hard‚Äù which isn‚Äôt really even a complaint.
---
I fucking love the chuckle and hehe
---
They do it with every rework they do. I swear it's got to be on purpose at this point
---
I don't agree with DCing, but Franklin's isn't fun. You buy that item with bloodpoints and get it smacked out of your hands. It's like if flashlighting a killer made them lose their add ons.
---
Hold on let me go through this backlog of words they said. Its right behind the list of every shit I've taken
---
I assumed yall watched their videos so I made the meme. It appears none of you do and y'all just bitch over people you've never seen
---
In that case you lose as a team. 
---
Win as one lose as one.
---
Oh yeah this made me angry, as much as i wanted to uncensor his name, but it‚Äôs against this subs rule.
---
Really liking the chase music as well
---
For some reason the download wont work for me. It worked for the big pack of everyone else but sadly not this one
---
I would personally have tunneled you out the game

Didn't read one sentence.  But that's a healthy rule of thumb
---
I‚Äôd do it in a heartbeat with cross progression, can‚Äôt be bothered buying all that dlc/cosmetics again...
---
actually unplayable
---
Plus in my opinion, it's a waste of a perk slot. Unless there's a key, it's not much bang for your buck.
---
What I meant is there‚Äôs 1 router that everyone connects to
---
Rework it. That‚Äôs the easy solution that they won‚Äôt follow through with.
---
I don‚Äôt care what the rework is, just as long as it‚Äôs better than it is now and doesn‚Äôt include deep wounds.
---
Is that the same as the one that YouTube guy created? It sounds familiar.
---
Why does huntress look like that picture with the caption "I hope mom and dad don't find out"
---
Perfect expression I had when a salty killer said using spine chill was cheating by abusing an "OP" perk.
---
Yeah i wasnt aware it was so prolific all of a sudden. Guess a decent chunk of  the map is an instant kill zone for now
---
a killer shouldn't need addons and other perks to make his kit viable
---
Monto streams, so you can watch him get those 0 kills there.
---
I just started recently and have only been against it like twice so I'm not sure if it's bad or not, but what I can say is that Michael Meyers is worse
---
Not sure, i think i was hooked with another person one time and he Also bugged so i think its all of them.. I got hooked on the first one and maybe the back one
---
Itd be nice if people took 1 minute to check and see if there 6,439 other posts about this bug
---
Yess finallyy
---
Just happened to me as Yui on the PS4. Don't have any clips to share, but it was also in the basement.
---
Wait, was this removed intended or is it a bug ?
---
By all means you could complete the rift, spend 1000 cells for premium then get 1000 cells back from the premium track.
---
Im always put on back hook when it happens to me, not sure it happens on every map or not
---
Right? I was just about to post this, too. So weird that they got rid of it out of no where when it was super helpful.
---
Dwight tries to impress Meg with his Xmas tree decorating skills.
---
Yeah. This was cornfields. Happened on other maps too though.
---
Initially it's just black screen. Then it transictions into the fog.
---
Ahhh 3 gen strats always make me smile as a killer. I always say ‚Äúoh you dumb fuckers‚Äù
---
Platform: PS4
---
I've played three games today with the new survivor Yui, and in all three games when I get hooked the second time I can't struggle at all.
---
In the third game when I was hooked in the basement the screen went white and then it just looked like I was infinitely falling through the sky. Other survivors and the killer seemed to be able to interact with me, because I was unhooked and healed, and then downed and hooked again, but on my screen I was just falling with nothing but the sky anywhere on my screen.
---
It‚Äôs really cool seeing licensed and original characters together in the same banner. But the downside to that is, of course it happens and Ash isn‚Äôt on the art :( they really had to do my boy like that
---
What a nice family picture
---
Plus 3 gen situations are always in survivors hands.
---
Zubat is pretty godly but I just don't enjoy his streams so I watch his YouTube
---
They decided to not release it to everyone and the reason for that is well people earned them do it didn't feel right to give it to people that didnt
---
this seems like a big bug lol
---
Why, I would figure more would play Micheal, hes basically impossible to get away from
---
The optimal strategy is to avoid this situation. This is a situation where survivors should not win and it is 100% their fault if this situation comes up.
---
I would upvote this twice if I could just because you used the format correctly.
---
Reselect the character
---
That‚Äôs exactly whose fault it is
---
I don‚Äôt see the difference after the first hour it was evident it was widespread
---
The first thing I thought of when I saw Susie and Joe:
---
"Prepare for trouble"
---
"And make it double"
---
It is my understanding that you need to buy the DLC from the xbox store, not the in game (auric cell) store for your DLC to be available to multiple profiles.
---
His charge seems too strong. That's my main issue.
---
Who said it should be fair? 
---
Survivors have to suffer... that is the design of bleeding out to death. Nothing fair or enjoyable for the survivors, of course...
---
how is teabagging different than flashlight click spamming?
---
Frank be lookin SEXY
---
They test these things more then you know. Some things slip through. It just happens.
---
What happen there (i think) is that after the pallet is up there are a few seconds when she cant Trow it,  giving the killer the chance to hit her
---
u could have just said that. u could have just said thats what u experienced. u could have made it simple and save urself from the downvotes. but u had to go &amp; make a comment abt na vs eu. now everyone hates u
---
Most recent one I can find that shows the average party size
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/community-community-data-requests
---
Practice is Custom Games. I can easily blind a killer at a pallet, but timing a flashlight save is hard. Most competent killers pick up survivors facing a wall.
---
DS existing in a game is it working. As soon as the killer sees an obsession they have to entirely change the way they play. No one runs moris unless they're really pissed and decide to make peoples live shitty. The timer is a buff if anything because instead of non-obsession survivors having to wiggle to 35% or obsession survivors being juggled, they just get it or you have to leave that survivor alone to do whatever they please for a minute. Not to mention the fact that enduring used to be a hard counter to DS that no longer works.
---
As for the ten minute average. True, I can't deny those numbers. But, you can't deny that the fact that things like keys and toolboxes change the game dramatically. They are the most powerful items in the game and the side with the most powerful items in the game is the clear most powerful side. Moris are strong, but moris dont matter when you don't have enough time in the match to chase and down the same survivor twice because of perks like BT and items like insta heals give the survivors so many second chances that you can't get them again.
---
Yeah
---
Some people may have just logged onto reddit to post it and not realized that. They make memes and jokes about it and it‚Äôs different for each person. Then you make memes that you repeat over and over which makes it unfunny.
---
Good ol blood warden
---
In that case was a nerf
---
Wat... that‚Äôs their whole reasoning behind them actually giving cosmetics away. This company is so ass backwards sometimes.
---
You need to absolutely pickle a guy. Like a full force Oni making a survivor do a back flip.  Just straight up pickle ‚Äòem.
---
raid shadow legends tier 3
---
I don‚Äôt see the problem here
---
Oh shit yeah DD builds are so hot right now
---
Honestly, it should be something like Dota‚Äôa bloodseeker ult.
---
You move ‚Äî you start to receive a LOT of damage. You have to wait it out, but by doing so, Legion/Blood-seeker is going to kill you.
---
I've just played a game as Ghostface and saw that nobody wiggled too. They told me they could not even struggle when hooked. Felt bad for them :(
---
Actually its Endgame Collapse and great timing. But i'll love to use blood warden someday :)
---
It's dumb and ugly anyways
---
Wonderful news, the Calm addons already have that effect.
---

Happend to me aswell.. fucking hell!
---
They didn't hook anyone in the basement if they did.
---
Did they fr nerf oni?
---
I just got this.
---
Couldn't see anything even after I was unhooked so i had to dc.
---
Another bug that happened during the match was that I couldn't wiggle.
---
He needs a buff. Make bleeding out while in chase a thing. Problem solved

It seems to be tied to the basement, and killers seem to have noticed and are actively exploiting it.

Sweater time babey!!!

Would be nice if people would check which dimension we were actually in.

How would they know if you did it or it's an act of god
---
Me in the bright white Nancy sweater
---
Won‚Äôt people just get themselves hooked?
---
That's pretty true, but when they keep going back for the items I just find it funny, like oh you want me 2 slap it out again? Ok!
---
this subreddit is filled to the brim with entitled survivor mains, OP. you will never get anything other than hypocrisy and screaming that even being on the map is unfair
---
Yes but now Doctor is going to be popular! :D
---
On the Release date of Chapter 14, Basement basically immobilizes you somehow. Not sure how it happened. it seems other people can see me but I'm stuck in the "Void". Also Michael was rude, he didn't know what I went through :(
---
It's very niche but I've managed to reset pallets at least once in a match.I'd say get the DLC even if its for Oni only,survivor is pretty much feng but better imo.
---
Let‚Äôs hope so. If this works out anything like the Freddy rework, that‚Äôs one more killer you‚Äôll be seeing often in red ranks. Killer reworks lately have been pretty successful.
---
Ohh I agree. I misunderstood you I apologize.
---
To my knowledge the devs said they know the difference... but only time will tell I guess.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt really make sense. The time Rin‚Äôs father murdered her was around modern Japan I‚Äôm assuming, so if she had a brother it wouldn‚Äôt really make sense for a samurai to be killing people in modern times. Making the Oni a relative of Rin makes sense because back then samurai were common and it wouldn‚Äôt be weird. It‚Äôs hard to explain but I think you get the gist.
---
You said you bring moris to swf but it is not ok if they do it for a challenge? That a little bit hypocritical.
---
For the initial hit. Still has to chase, still has to m1, still an m1 killer. Why do you think 'dont heal against legion' is a thing? It's the same reason plague isn't viable: she only works if the survivors cleanse or suck at loops. Otherwise, it doesn't matter if they are a one-shot: it takes too long to get the m1.
---
That's like wanting legacy to be purchased. 
---
Besides, you're getting a plethora of FREE COSMETICS with this update (cosmetics people PAID for) so I really don't see how theres a reason to complain. Enjoy what you have.
---
Flashlight aiming is weird in this game, (and i'm usually very decent with headshots in shooter games) but I learned to aim at the front of the upper torso, they're still blinded with this. It helped me, I was always aiming directly for the head and couldnt get it.
---
I specifically chose to main Bill because he doesn't have any cool cosmetics. If I prestiged Nea or Claudette, I wouldn't use the bloody cosmetics because I think there are better thiggs than their default skins. I wanted to prestige bill because he had no other cosmetics. Well shit.
---
No, they're giving all the *exclusives* away. The point is that anyone could have earned the event cosmetics, and so they are granting those only to people who earned them and then had the cosmetics disappear from their account.
---
That shows that roughly 50% of players play solo and 50% play in groups. So you should have some form of a group in the majority of your games, no?
---
Killing by any means doesn't mean you have to bring a Mori. They could bring rancor to kill their obsession or an ivory so it's not really an excuse for an Ebony.
---
They have done this by making more recent event cosmetics buyable via the shop.

Type of Bug: Ingame

Bad Killers don't get to red ranks, friend. 
---
It is pretty easy to be boosted to red ranks as a Survivor, well, SWF exists. As Killer, it is kinda hard to be boosted. If you abuse something, sure, like Legion's Infinite Mend a while back; not normally though.
---
Because they are purchased through a currency same as last year, whereas the summer BBQ was a limited time challenge
---
yui perks are alright imo, i really like break out and any means necessary is fun to use, luck break is ok, i think it would go well with quick and quite for jumping in lockers since you wont leave a blood trail
---
It doesn‚Äôt annoy me
---
It looks fucking awesome tho
---
Well thats the politest reply I‚Äôve ever seen on reddit.
---
I didnt mean to sound rude but ive experienced this already and its game breaking. I dont know how on earth they can let it go on for a week or two. Not when players currently have challenges to hook survivors in the basement as well!
---
Im hoping that was just a pr blunder and this will be fixed in a few days. With all the money BHVR has been raking in recently they can not let something so gamebreaking go on for so long.

i kinda like it to be honest

I‚Äôve been trying to learn how to flashlight save and I haven‚Äôt saved anyone yet. on the other bad side I get killers to be toxic against me for even trying
---
Does the link not work for you or won't the download start? I tried to test it and I didn't run into problems, so I need your help for a bit!
---
Now get rid of letting people suicide
---
this post literally disproves itself. good job
---
I'm pretty sure the reasoning for the other cosmetics were people selling them for alot of money I believe Aces Thailand hat was around $1000
---
Because hallowed blight cosmetics were made buyable AFTER bhvr decided to stop doing exclusive cosmetics. Its completely fair. Every event after the summer BBQ has been buyable.
---
Oh, I just love it. Especially with Unbreakable and Tenacity, it is absolutely wonderful.
---
Oh yea didn‚Äôt see your perks
---
Before Ghosty boi I was a diehard Legion main.... come to our side, much better....
---
Will forever be funny to me.
---
okay. so you don't have anything. you're just another perpetually buttmad tru3 fanboy
---
Then its time to buff every singel killer but Nurse. Trapper get gen rushed without ruin because he need to spend time to setup traps also 1 survivor can Always follow and disarm all his traps. Wraith is easy to loop and need to sometimes spend alot time chasing a survivor and while he pressure one gen Another gen will get repaired across the map. Same with leatherface and The pig. Also dont forget many maps favors the Survivors  more (autohaven, torment creek, yamamoka). The killer need to find a survivor which can sometimes take up to 30 seconds which is a lot of time if you dont have any perks like ruin. This is why killers got so many perks that let them slow down the game just a lil bit or else they would get crushed by a optimal team
---
No, it isn't.
---
I didnt really intend on being toxic to him but idk i guess thats how it turns out
---
best news out of the entire update!
---
How about this, this should be the default Michael skin and you have to buy the jump suit
---
Just happened to me, ruined the rest of the game for me
---
same but when i got downed it fixed but it was too late as of course i was in my last hook
---
i asked and OP just attacked me lmao
---
Its Alright, Mister Ghostface Sir.
---
Has to be a lesser one or there would be no need to use therapy.
---
I played the game myself it‚Äôs just a stupid joke. Lol. Don‚Äôt know why everyone‚Äôs panties are in a knot. Same people downvoting are the same people upvoting reposts. Lol dbd retards.
---
the cooldown
---
I'm sorry but when it comes to taking games hostage for 20 plus minutes there isn't a single defense for that ever.  Just don't man.
---
maybe he had the basement glitch where you cant see anything. just dont hook people in the basement until they fix it
---
me too. i‚Äôm glad for the change. i saw one too many legion mains excited to abuse nemesis
---
I haven't been on Reddit today, I'm kind of glad its happening to others it may get fixed in a few weeks
---
This update was the nail in the coffin for Legion. No more STBFL. No more no TR meme builds. It‚Äôs was fucking difficult to get a down with his power before, now the only thing you can do is hope the survivor‚Äôs shift key breaks.
---
I don‚Äôt think removing Sloppy Butcher from Feral Frenzy was a bad change by any means, but sacrificing STBFL powerhouse Legion took away the last thing that made using his power feel, well, *powerful*. If there was more reward for getting Feral Frenzy hits, say a temporary and progressively larger lunge similar to Michael‚Äôs Tier III, I think Legion would feel so much better to play.
---
It's trash
---
Wow i didnt knowbthey added two killer matches
---
Luckily this style is great to be sloppy with, so it's a good way for me to unlearn perfectionism and be quick for once :')
---
Lesser cooldown for therapy? I dig.
---
It is more reliable then rancor and gets them more bloodpoints. If you want to complain about moris and franklins then make a post about it but don't say that this person is playing the game wrong for doing stuff you do too.
---
BHVR: Are you sure about that?
---
There‚Äôs not much. There‚Äôs a difference between teabagging and a combination of all the things you‚Äôve listed.
---
Have you seen that new 5th of July Billy skin coming out?
---
idk man, I had 3 people use the pallets I raised
---
It's more fun than any other perk I run.
---
Fuck sweaty perks, not everything has to be meta 
---
You can get rank 1 survivor without any perks at all, so just run the fun shit (and ds because fuck killers and it's meta as fuck)
---

BHVR if you're reading this, please make the We'll Make It buff symbol cover half the screen, thank you.
---
Happened to me as well
---
The stop bleeding is just a counter to Oni and that's it lol.
---
If you read all my comments you'd see I said everyone should play with what they want and how they want as long as they're not doing anything that's a bannable offense. So please shut up.
---
So basically they are just making him even more annoying than he already is.
---
I don‚Äôt know, exhaustion was only tier 3, and you likely knocked down anybody you tier 3‚Äôd. Once they get off hook, the first thing they usually do is snap out of it, and there‚Äôs no guarantee that you weren‚Äôt preoccupied while they did so.
---
This (while gimmicky), is at least persistent for the majority of the match given that you can‚Äôt drop from Tier 2. And I wouldn‚Äôt underestimate how badly it could fuck up survivors, it‚Äôs a small change, but some players don‚Äôt even watch the tick, they look for the success zones and use muscle memory. This‚Äôll fuck with that pretty bad, not to mention if it‚Äôs on trickier checks like DS or  overcharge, and that‚Äôs before unnerving presence/distressing
---
You have the timing completely off. Older events are exclusive. Every event after the summer bbq is not exclusive. So it's silly to compare the two.

Oh that what it was. I was on death hook when it happend
---
Meh maybe if killers weren‚Äôt so weak they wouldn‚Äôt dodge, I‚Äôve been lucky so far no dodging.
---
But the question is why aren‚Äôt they? Why do people *not* feel cheated now when event cosmetics can be purchased? Why does someone get to purchase Hallowed wraith while i‚Äôm sucking the titty milk from a plant to save money? Why would someone feel cheated now if i had to buy the pro-pain hammer while they earned it for free?
---
Well, what exactly are you doing? It has to be healing other survivors, it has to be with a medkit, you have to be running botany, and you have to do 2 full states in a single trial.
---
who's to say legacy has more meaning than an older event cosmetic? You're being super subjective here. You also never participated in these events so you can't have an experience with how difficult or easy they were.
---
I can tell you now, as someone who has put the time into every event cosmetic; the older events were much harder. These new events; cosmetics are essentially just given to us lol. 
---
Anyway, you're not entitled to cosmetics that you missed out on. Enjoy the new unlocked cosmetics though. And as I've said before in a prior response; your timeline is off when it comes to how bhvr treats exclusives. They phased out their old exclusive policies by making newer event cosmetics buyable in game to make future events more inclusive. The only reason they were considering making former event cosmetics free was because they didn't know how to distribute a few lost cosmetics and figured it'd be easier to mass give them out instead, before coming up with their current fix for that.
---
Yup.
---
new meta. yui cannot gott basement
---
seems to me like the ghostface got outplayed, and then assblasted when his one victory blew up in his face.
---
Not all of them because people cried that they grafted 200 hours during an event for some so now you can‚Äôt have them because you didnt buy the game earlier.

&gt;And TBH, the fact that they even need to try shows theirs some serious gameplay issues they're not addressing.

No it's just because you're a salty survivor main who can't adapt. /s
---
Freddy is a big one for me. The Freddy's I have gone  against recently have said in the end-game chat that their whole purpose in queuing is to tunnel and face camp survivors because "survivors are entitled" and they "love to hear them whine."
---
Like.. why? They don't get bloodpoints, or interactive gameplay. They just sit there, staring at survivors for half their games. The only thing I can imagine is that they get an honest perverse thrill, and jack off just thinking about face-camping those "entitled" level 7, rank 18 claudettes.
---
You're the guy I was waiting for. Some guy/gal always comes along to correct "that guy". Bless you.
---
Did you wake up in Skyrim
---
Eh, F, by honestly I was gettin nemesis for rancor, spirt fury and enduring just for a fun build on Legion (although it works for any killer) the old legion thing would of just been a meme XD
---
This man is a god walking among men
---
Sorry doctor
---
7 for killer 8 for survivor.
---
As the other person already mentioned (thank you btw!) I simply sped up the footage because it would have been way too boring to watch me crawl around in normal speed. :)
---
The original clip was 2 min long for reference.
---
Don't forget that some players still have to hook people in the basement for the tome, yikes
---
As a fellow PS4 player, I must warn you. Demogorgon really suffers on the console with frame drops and stuttering issue. Even if you were to enjoy his power or a perk build, just know the PS is gonna be fighting you the entire time.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs because Otz seems like he tries to listen to both sides and can agree and disagree with many different points, while Tru3 calls anyone who doesn‚Äôt agree with him sheep, drones, pathetic losers, etc. Being arrogant and confrontational all the time tends to make some people not like you.
---
It was intented, showing the player ranks was actually a bug.

uwu what's that in your hand

Is there anyway to do this stuff on console? I'm in love

It's updated now
---
Cosplaying a locker. Pretty original.
---
You specifically listed diahype, ohmwrecker but then listed streamer exclusives again. What streamer exclusives are you talking about?
---
I‚Äôm not sure what you mean. His vault speeds were increased and his feral frenzy speed was increased too.  The only thing that could be considered a nerf is the fact that feral frenzy isn‚Äôt considered a basic attack - which is good, cuz it shouldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a balance that makes sense - feral frenzy is his power, it‚Äôs not a basic attack.
---
Are there more changes or are these all?
---
I love me some gwen stefani
---
Yes it's her top the back has a gold logo instead of the pink one .
---
every dbd streamer: "It's ANII-CHAN not ONII-CHAN"
---
This is apparently a new glitch happening, I think its only if you get out in the dungeon though
---
Not sure how fast they will fix this but I'm staying away from survivor for a while .
---
Ah, thanks dude. The nerfs don't seem too damning.
---
... that‚Äôs actually a great idea lmao. Be like a survivor but inside a locker walking around, pair up with someone as killer to pose for photos.
---
Oof, I don't know how I could fix that, apologies!  
---
Good luck on your new mission though!
---
thanks! \^\^
---
I have to say I quite agree with you.
---
How does that make them backwards?
---
I've found it helpful to not even start looking for the hatch and just run to one of the exits and wait at the lever to immediately start opening it as soon as the killer closes the hatch. Depending on the killer this can work quite well. I'd say most of my escapes in 1v1 situations like these were through exits, not the hatch.
---
But I have to add that vs roaming killers it's very difficult to pull off, for instance Billy or Spirit. Legion as well or Huntress with her range. Vs the rest you should stand a much better chance!
---
No I like it especially the jean top with the leather skirt is cuteeeee. If anything they need to fix that kate ponytail it's so bad .
---
Thanks man, i didn‚Äôt even notice the difference. Figured it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to ask and be sure. üòÅ
---
Hmm, uninstall and reinstall the dlc is my final guess
---
Thank you! But also thank you for still making such adorable icons!
---
2v6 mode confirmed? thinkingemoji
---
Just play better ^^^/^^^s
---
The killer must know about it then. They are aiming to put everyone in the basement. -_-
---
If someone else is hooked, YOU see everyone‚Äôs aura, if YOURSELF gets hooked everyone else sees the auras of everyone.
---
Haven't you heard of the deep wound changes? Also that speed increase is pretty useless considering that his power now basically does nothing. Don't get me wrong I was a Legion Main before, but all of these recent changes just completely destroy the few builds that were reliable on them.
---
Pretty certain its gonna be an AoE similar to Clown's bottles, will spice up the gameplay a bit and possibly give some more zoning potential.
---
The Scrapped Tape will also put shock blast bombs on survivors, which sounds infinitely more useful than it's current iteration.
---
Its also a challenge though my dude, so maybe not
---
If I'm reading correctly, Static Blast is replacing the passive madness buildup he has right now, so instead of standing in the area of survivors and them eventually going mad unless they leave (which they likely will), you instead nuke the entire area with a heap of madness at once, so they are way more likely to advance madness tier than the drip-feed he has now.
---
This explains the change to Calm. In which case a cooldown IS needed or you could just Perma Madness III everyone on the map all the time which would be ridiculously overpowered.
---
Still haven't gotten the event cosmetics yet
---
I've never seen someone so assmad
---
Hey, that movie was filmed at my uni.
---
That‚Äôs awesome, I wish they gave voice lines to other characters like Steve. Imagine him saying ‚ÄúAhoy, Ladies!‚Äù
---
Those are streamer exclusives. If you need more, look towards the H2O Delirious trapper mask and the Bryce McQuaid meg shirt.
---
yup it irritated me so much lol hopefully they fix it soon

Yes. It‚Äôs a known bug. Check the feed of this sub, it‚Äôs everywhere.
---
I was playing as Legion last night and a survivor spawned nearly right behind me. I downed them and they disconnected almost right away. I then got a message a little while later saying "Seriously, Legion is such a shit killer, learn to play a better one." 
---
Like should I have let him go or something? The game started, I ran around a wall and he was literally standing right there.
---
They held back on releasing those to all players and leaving it for those who earned it. 
---
They also found a way to restore it to those who lost theirs
---
It's a much larger midriff with some of her other clothing options though.
---
Me when a nea is crouching towards me
---
Tunneling and Camping are legitimate strategies of the game, though.
---
They might not be good strategies, but they are. The only reason those two don't work is if the other survivors are smart and work on gens.
---
I don't camp or tunnel if I can help it, but if I'm at the hook, turn around and see two people nearby waiting for the save? You bet your ass I'm not leaving that hook.
---
Damn, is it a new challenge ? It came at such a bad time lol.
---
Lol I said its red and purple ranks, I dont need your validation, it happens
---
this whole game was a mistake
---
Wtf I knew they were gonna mess with him but he‚Äôs pretty much unplayable now, look at how they‚Äôve massacred my boy
---
I'm noticing a distinct lack of a time-travelling britt in this format
---
Its not completely new but it is a challenge to hook people in the dungeon
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true, hence why I think there should be a change to the hatch game, like giving the left behind perk the option to open back the hatch with a progress bar. Would make it more diverse and fun and would give survivors an actual way to use stealth skill to escape.
---
Honestly yes the should. They made a commitment to play the match when they searched for one. Just because they‚Äôre not doing well they can just leave ruining the game for everybody? Including the other survivors. The killers have to deal with gen rushing, t bagging, looping survivors pretty much every game. So they decide they can finally use their good addons and offerings because they decide they wanna have a fun game and suddenly 3 dcs and a hatch escape. The killer bought the game to have fun so are you saying a killer should just dc when they get gen rushed or people have adrenaline.
---
That "out" is going to bother me. In case you can't tell, it's a supposed to say "put".
---
Doesn't this mean that the Mending can go down if you aren't in chase within the terror radius?
---
Oh really...I hadn't heard of that. That is a good solution if so!
---
anyone knows if behaviour is ok with this? I love them and im using them right now but i dont want to get a ban or something if they dont like us using another images
---
Oh boy it's smooching time
---
which console?
---
What would be so wrong with making Any Means Neccesary nearly instant? It would give you a potential double palette stun every minute and a half, provided the killer is dumb and takes the bait and doesn't break the palette first. It wouldn't exactly be oppressive compared with other perks like DS.
---
The only time I've ever thought about disconnecting is when 3 gens popped in the first two minutes and I hadn't seen a single survivor. I still played that game out though.
---
They actually are starting to punishing it today

My apologies! I probably should have checked before posting. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs known though.
---
Why does it make sense for his ability to be able to trigger perks that say triggered by basic attacks. It‚Äôs not a basic attack - feral frenzy is his ability.
---
thank you, and you probably know this by now but wiggle doesn't work most of the games, the bar just doesn't show and when you get hooked in the basement is basically game over because the whole screen turns white/black/green/etc

There‚Äôs a button binding that inverts your camera controls.  Pretty sure your just hitting the button it‚Äôs bound to.

Go to the button layout section of settings to find it.

don't know then. on PS4 the big button on the center of the controller inverts the camera and I have hit it a few times on accident. probably something similar for you

if you hate slugging for the 4k then tell bhvr to add an actual condition to the hatch
---
No worries :)
---
Lol I remember that. I also remember fast vaulting into lockers repeatedly as it seemed to somewhat fix the issue. Or at least that's what some players said to do.
---
If you get hooked in the basement, this happens. Every map. Game is unplayable.
---
hey man if you wanna DC thats completely fine. Just don't come at me with salty messages. The situation behind this meme though was when I played Mikey with vanity mirror(see 32m when stalking, but can't go past tier 1) I would hook one surv that happened to be next to my hex ruin. Every surv trying to rescue him would loop me around him without leading me away and would end up trying to unhook while injured ultimately switching places with the hooked surv. At the end they were all injured STILL trying to loop me around the hooked victim and even attempting to get my hex. Eventually I killed one, and downed the other three( Trying to get my hex/hiding around the hooked victim)
---
And then the three dc when i pick them up and I was perfectly fine with being on my way with my merciless, 25k bp, and pip. Until... a salty surv had to message me telling me how im bad and a noob for camping? As if im suppose to willingly let someone run by me or let them escape a chase all cause they're near the hooked surv and risk losing my ruin? I didn't even tunnel nor did I TRY to proxy camp they just didn't do anything to lead me away. None of them being chased left the hooked surv and if they did another surv would try and run by me so I switched targets they all came one after the other basically.
---
But yeah I truly dont care if u dc or not just don't throw salty messages my way all cause you couldn't cooperate as a team to rescue someone or actually lead me away/give a reason to leave the area of my ruin. It wasn't like I spent more than 10 seconds not chasing someone and just waiting it the proximity. hense my 25k and merciless
---
Happens any map if you get basement hooked.

NEA!? I fucking knew it!
---
where can I report a bug? falling through the map once placed on a hook
---
I'm saying things off the top of my head. I watch tru3 and I agree with a lot of what he says. If I say something close to what someone else has said its probably because it's a logical point to make and seeing as we both play killer and survivor I tend to think a lot like tru3 when it comes to balance.
---
Well we all know she is the real killer and likely entity incarnate.
---
I also had a 3 man insta dc cause I was playing freddy with slowing the game add ons. I said nothing at all to the three dc and still I got salty  messages about how I shouldn't run those add ons and I'm a noob and more surv bs.

I'll try that in a second
---
I had this happen to me and some people have said that they can‚Äôt play with the screen like that but I was able to use sound cues to know when to start the struggle phase and got all the struggle points. Does it stop others from being able to rescue you off the hook though?
---
*gets sent to oblivion if hooked in basement making survivor unplayable* ThAnk YoU BhVr!
---
That's pretty much what I was planning on doing
---
Idk.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter what platform, if I was PS4 or PC (I‚Äôm XB1) I‚Äôd still. And if my teammates and I had quad toolboxes then I don‚Äôt mind the killer dodging, I might do the same if I want a chill game. Or I‚Äôd play a Mori, or the Ruin/NOED combo, it‚Äôd be ok if the killer did the same (even though Moris need a nerf). You‚Äôre asking for a quick game, so it‚Äôs not the killer‚Äôs fault for helping that game go quickly. 
---
If I get dodged 3 times in a row because we‚Äôre a SwF, but we‚Äôre playing no items, then I‚Äôd be a lil pissed. But it is what it is. People don‚Äôt want an unbalanced game that‚Äôs on the other‚Äôs sides favor from the start. 
---
If people want a fair experience I can‚Äôt really blame them. But if it‚Äôs a SwF, whether with items or not, eventually as killer I‚Äôm gonna say fuck it, and throw on insta saw Ruin NOED Billy or Spirit with good addons (Prayer Beads removal still doesn‚Äôt change the fuck she‚Äôs pretty damn strong. Just sound whore, Ruin NOED to win). If they‚Äôre using toolboxes, a Mori regardless. Hard proxy camping and tunneling (within reason. If the smartest move to 4K is to tunnel, then it is what it is.)
---
It was tilt-inducing for some, kinda see why they removed it.
---
Ditto. I'm currently floating through the map with my hand in the air.
---
Yep - basement is bugged - encountered it as well.
---
Hag is the strongest of those 3 killers, but Doctor's rework does look like it's next on the list. If not a Legion rework first. This is more a matter of who you think you'd have more fun playing because Devour and Monitor are both great perks. Just keep in mind Hag is a 110 movement speed killer. I wouldn't really consider Clown if you already have PGTW because he isn't good in his current state.
---
Lol it legit already has a condition be the last one left
---
thanks for the answer and the portraits too! I'll use them then, it helps to change the game vibes a little and the portraits somehow remember me to Paper Mario
---
Seconded.

Art

Anyone else having a basement bug?  Falling into the map on first hook in basement.
---
Now they can enjoy getting face camped in the basement
---
Imagine being hurt by somebody once then thinking that every random individual afterward has some correlation to that. You got mental issues kid lol
---
you cant do crazy flicks as well  anymore with his power, and it seems like hes a bit slower entering and exiting his power as well as when he hits an object. i still think he'll be a solid killer, maybe not nurse/spirit level but probably freddy/huntress level
---
Cool

Hag is prob best

---
Remove Deep Wounds from the game. Watching BHVR fiddle with it is fucking embarrassing.
---
u may be right i just booted back in

M&amp;A is good on any Killer, but Mikey and Amanda can make extra use of it in specific builds. It's not necessary though.
---
Personally I'd hold onto your cells if you're willing to grind shards; since you could unlock one of them for free.
---
If you absolutely must pick one of these three though, I'd pick Hag. 
---
She's not my favorite personally, but some people really enjoy her and she's one of the strongest Killers in the game. Hex: Devour Hope can also be a really fun perk if you get lucky with it.
---
I‚Äôm not hashing out ideas. The premise of balancing in this game seems to be based on solos, not groups. That‚Äôs what my post is about edgelord.
---
The sucky part is that my team could still heal me and stuff and he legion could still hit me and get his skill off.  So he would hit me then chase all the other players.
---
Yup. Had to sadly dc because it wasn't gonna fix itself. Also, can't wiggle when getting picked up which totally isn't fair.
---
Stop being a baby Feng and actually look at the link you doofus. None of the cosmetics listed are event related.
---
I'm 'avin' a giggle mate!
---
Yeah, Steam has their weekly maintenance, just like every single week before this one. Blows my mind how this comes as a surprise to every dbd player, every week.
---
No Problem. I don't usually get far enough to basement anyhow.
---
Not really. I always see dumbasses who get injured and automatically want to heal, when we‚Äôve gotten nothing done. Especially if someone is chased. I keep doing them gen just so hopefully they take a hint, but they just run off for someone else. And all that just for them to go down in 20 seconds and the killer to 4K. If you‚Äôre one of these guys, take the hint 
---
And if the killer is running a Sloppy Butcher, Thana, etc combo, don‚Äôt fucking heal lol
---
YES ! I would stay in a locker up until crows showed up and it would fix half the time. What a time it was to play killer you could probably hit rank 1 super easy during that time.
---
Good grief. Guess I'll just slog through Killer queue times until they fix it then.
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
Implying people only DC because of poor balance.
---
Boy, I once chased a survivor for 20 seconds, downed him with BL, and he DCed before I was wiping my blade. I was Trapper, and hadn't actually placed any traps yet.
---
Platform: PC
---
When I level up my bloodweb in a lobby, it won't actually level up or go off of my screen. I'm unable to close the bloodweb or do pretty much anything without force closing the game or just letting the match start. The issue may be more broad than just leveling it up, but there's definitely some problem with that and being unable to leave lobbies under certain circumstances. All of this has been when I'm on survivor, haven't tested on killer. Anyone else having issues?
---
What are you even complaining about rofl
---
Ooh, that explains some post game chat.

---
Damn, that was slick, nice job!
---
If it wasn't free, it would have been one of the only cosmetics I'd pay auric cells for.
---
Mine only fixed itself after the killer came and downed me again. From the looks of the other posts, it works itself out if you manage to fall. One of the most irritating glitches I‚Äôve ever experienced.
---
Well. You can't prove that they are abusing it. But its suspicious how many people started running Iron Grasp + Agitation since the bug has been discovered. Thats all I can say
---
I usually like this because the last survivor can come revive me :)
---
The survivers would play better if the killer would. If there was no camping and tunneling there would be no rage quitting
---
my idea is just simply to make his addons better since most of them might as well not exist at least half of them are pointless
---
yeah a random rotation when nothing has been released for awhile would be cool. And just show the most recent cutscene for a few weeks when they do release new stuff
---
Did they really nerf it bc of legion
---
You have issues with Clown and Legion? Unless you're saying their too easy in that case I'd agree with you. If I see a Clown its almost certain I'll get out same with Legion.
---
Lowkey hope they keep him shit so I don‚Äôt have to see him at all. But all the other killers that need buffs should get them
---
Yeah, I tried to stay around long enough to see if something would fix it but after awhile of seeing New falling, i noticed the game just went quiet lol. So i had no choice. I wonder if the survivors i'm playing against for killer arw experiencing it
---
Basically their solutions have been perks + the Emblem system to try and encourage/discourage certain playstyles.   BBQ and Chili for example gives the Killer incentive to try and focus on hooking everyone once instead of tunneling.  4K quick stomps won't get a pip at higher ranks.   Borrowed Time and Kindred help to try and combat campers.  Decisive Strike helps against tunneling, etc.
---
How do you acquire the free cosmetic?
---
Idk I just think it's weird that 9/10 survivors would farm at the exit gates and now they do it 1/10
---
Oh hey I didn't realise you were into DbD. Love seeing your DnD art and this Oni doesn't disappoint!
---
Relatable
---
I hope for more bill cosmetics one day, it‚Äôs weird sweater but I‚Äôll take it, I would wear it personally.
---
Actions ingame wouldnt really be considered but aftergame chat &amp; DC frequency would be the main factors
---
Great comic but... you can't see when you close your eyes, so they would just be blinding themselves to avoid being blinded.
---
Wait you can actually hold the button to launch attack?
---
Been playing her all day, she's awesome
---
Well that's pretty fucking terrifying.
---
i think a cool solution would be to make it so the next X (could be an increasing amount, say, 20k, 50k, 100k, etc.) bloodpoints they gain are gained at half rate. So essentially if you were to gain 15k bloodpoints next game, you would actually only gain 7.5k, and it would continue applying every game until you had gained 20/50/100k bloodpoints that way
---
I just got him prestige 3, I really wanted to stick with him after his first 2 rounds of nerfs but come on BHVR. Just give him a Freddy type rework already
---
/s
---
Yeah I figured out. Everytime I did it the med kit ran out on the 2nd heal. Thanks for the Help tho! Much appreciated
---
Man I had a camping bubba last night and then when I was the last person he downed me and just revved his chainsaw for ten minutes while I bled out. I really wish toxic attitudes like that were somehow reported and looked at. It just makes the game not fun at all. Camping is one thing but this was a whole other level of shittyness.
---
God that Hag is cursed
---
They gave out a lot of the ones from conventions/codes, but not ones from events that had gameplay required.
---
Also, Bill's Christmas sweater is free for everyone.
---
If no ones gonna say it. Quentin actually looking like a damn normal person instead of a meth head. Lol
---
You can still be rescued, but you can't move after you've been rescued (in my experience, it may not always be that way), and unless you have DS you're either on struggle or dead.
---
Your objective in a chase is to stall the killer while your team does gens
---
If your team does gens then there will be no issue with used pallets
---
I've never encountered a camping Freddy. I've got a camping Billy, Bubba, Pig and Legion and thats about it.
---
I've only had a flashlight work one time; it was at a nice crucial moment but still, just once. There's something someone isn't telling me about how to use it
---
I agree with everything here, except legacy. My reasoning for this being that you had earn them and couldn't buy them from the page or the developer. I think the people who grinded to get legacy should be able to have that skin as a form of accomplishment.

I‚Äôm a killer main at red ranks I‚Äôd say I get a dc once every 10 games I think you‚Äôre really overrating how many people quit most people aren‚Äôt bitches.

But its only 6 dollhairs. Surely you can beat up some kids and get the money.
---
Once ur rescued you still have the grey screen, you cant move, you cant do anything but stand there and wait to die. So yeah it makes the game unplayable
---
They reworked the deep wound mechanic, I'm not sure what motivated the change but it wouldn't surprise me if legion gaining an indirect meta and buff was a factor.  Poor legion :(
---
Joey too
---
iirc it's about 17m. I don't remember where I heard that though so feel free to not believe me.
---
 [ONI DETECTED ONI DETECTED ONI DETECTED ONI DETECTED ONI DETECTED ONI DETECTED](https://youtu.be/7Ftuxj-8xJo)
---
Except he was actually buffed in every department outside of his Deep Wounds.
---
Yeah, I wish to have more monstrous killers in the game like demogorgon. All that roars and hissing is awesome and terrifying
---
Chibi Amanda looks so innocent! Love these :3
---
.. But it's a buff. The three legion mains I've talked to have either said the changes are a buff or haven't changed him much at all. The new killer perk also works into his kit, note to the memes that were made just a week ago.
---
Even ranks being gone I'm fine with, as long as we can see their character's level/prestige. I've seen too many Yui players today that only have 1 perk slot.
---
It's the shittiest players, and I swear to god they all follow the same playbook:
---
&gt; Teabag &gt; get chased for less than 10 seconds &gt; get downed cause I'm a dumb bitch &gt; **DC**
---
Poor doctor
---
I think you're onto something. Sprinting depletes the bar really quickly, moving depletes somewhat quickly, standing still depletes normally? Like they're really wounded badly
---
Agreed, but Legion isn't one of the Killers that really needs to rely on addons.
---
He's still going to be a weak killer and a noob stomper sadly.
---
Poor Hag, her eyes are made of mud.
---
Dude this is such crap. All you're doing is justifying why people are allowed to be sore losers/pathetic punks. "Oh clown with a Mori isn't fun, better break the fundamental agreement of play because I am obviously more important than the other 4 people in the match!"
---
Get outta here with that weakness. Toughen up and deal with it, it's ridiculous.
---
But Rin killed her father?
---
But you can buy legacy accounts online, and if the devs truly want to stop people from getting scammed, they would remove it too. Legacy accounts were the second most popular external dbd product besides skins.
---
P.S. I'm not saying that people with legacy don't deserve it, because they absolutely do. However, this enforces the double standard that BHVR has set up for themselves.
---
# NICE
---
Not for ps4 :)
---
Out here doing The Entity‚Äôs work! Excellent!!!
---
I like these! The song choices, I feel, capture the descriptions of their tapes. I get the energy from Susie's, the EDGE from Frank's, the depressing and gloom from Julie's, and Joey's is nice to relax to (or stab a lot of people to)  
---
Good work!
---
Rework might not be the best title, more like adjustments.
---
It's hardwired into his build, He needs to follow injured players to gain his power, If he doesn't find someone when an unhook is preformed it's a common strategy to go back to find the 2 players- Though he can track the unhooked one with his power which leads to direct tunneling encounters. Very poorly designed, Not to mention they removed kindreds ability to see stealth killers as if it wasn't to prevent the worst kind of gameplay strategies. At least they buffed it via global activation but now camping is actually a bit more effective since the only defense vs a hard camper is gone
---
I hope they just keep nerfing him to the point that they just turn them into a survivor.
---
Next patch notes:  
---
Removed Legion's feral frenzy
---
Removed Legion's ability to quickly vault pallets
---
Removed Legion's knife
---
Wait was Interview Tape also changed? Gonna miss Railgun Doctor if they removed it.
---
No trappers just over performing soon to be nerfed üòÇ
---
It says "BHVR I love your game but please don't put me through that again."
---
The Static Blast name sounds fucking awesome, but its function sounds just like the static field. Does this mean the static field is going to be separated from his terror radius?
---
Spirit should‚Äôve just waited since killers close it faster than survivors can jump in.
---
This is too goddamn adorable
---
Gimme love, gimme dreams, gimme more chewed pens please.
---
Your moms biased
---
Sounds about right
---
What is this free Bill cosmetic and how do I obtain it
---
Again I agree, they do have a double standard, but you couldn't buy legacy from BHVR themselves. That was my point, I was excluding the secondary market.

We can tell you don't

At red ranks. Where people know how to play the game. Go to Brown Yellow and Green people DC left and right.
---
Well its a lunge attack. You just move a bit faster during the swing and the weapon hits at the end
---
It's only for those who are hit after the first, so the max of 3 survivors get a debuff for 60 seconds. Still decent with the Broken / Mangled, but not a game-changer.
---
If we ever a get 2-killers mode i can see these 2 appearing together very often
---
What's the matter Oni-Chan? Or pattens are not home. :)
---
Don't worry, the devs said they'd fix it in ONE TO TWO WEEKS :))
---
lol u gotta be able to pay for that. sounds like u dont make minumum wage
---
maybe theyre going for the adept trophy
---
It says Static Blast is the size of his terror radius. It's possible they might be removing his passive madness gain in the terror radius in exchange for making him able to do a "Shockwave" style attack that zaps everyone inside his terror radius. Which would make him more entertaining to play as, and hopefully fix that annoying gripe where survivors can juke your shock by running directly into you.
---
By any chance, did you get hooked in the basement?
---
Or people who dc to make the last surv get hatch.Happened to me more than once.
---
I wish I could buy wm but at the moment dr appointments come first üò≠ and its 7.99 on psn

Happened to me when I got hooked on the basement
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs to prevent you easily farming the achievement. Which sucks.
---
*harder oni-chan harder!*
---
I want to say the deep wound timer only
---
Pauses while you‚Äôre mending and NOT sprinting. But I‚Äôd have to double check
---
Just had this happen too! Was hooked in basement and went blind
---
Haha I didn‚Äôt know this was a thing but I will start doing it.
---
Rip
---
Ive been booted from a few matches but ive never dc'd
---
She does.
---
It might be because console has no dedicated servers. Hoping they implement them soon.
---
2v7 mode confirmed.
---
Really? I'd been getting timed out from games unexpectedly recently, and I still got penalized.
---
Im in the basement again hipe to god this dosent happen
---
This just happened to me as well, basement has to be avoided at all costs now it seems
---
2v6 mode confirmed
---
I has muscles?
---
I feel we should at least be able to see the level of the character. Rank can stay gone, I don‚Äôt really mind that, but level did nothing wrong. Yeah, people might dip because I‚Äôm a Rank 7 running a Level 9 Yui, but still.
---
old ladies have money in their purses. just putting it out there :)
---
Poor Doctor...
---
I got him, played about 3 games so far. His strength (at least what I‚Äôm picking up on him) seems to be in tracking people. So perks going toward making them bleed would be a great investment. 
---
His secondary bash is good if you have enough time to whack em, but I‚Äôve been getting slippery people, quicker than my draw back with him, which is frustrating. But when you get a good whack, I took out two people at once. 
---
The demon dash is good, especially if you get them by surprise. Make sure you bash at the climax. Especially after the last gen pops, demon dash to the exit gate and whack a Claudette. (I love Claudette as she was my previous main, but going against so many is getting ridiculous on ps4 tonight.)
---
Overall, he has a little bit of a learning curve, but amazing potential once you get the right perks. 7/10 is what I‚Äôd give, would recommend if you like a billy that can track blood better than most.
---
If I could actually get a game, oce wake up pls I wanna play ;-;

It coagulates instantly into blood orbs 4head
---
Some background: there is a new bug when you get hooked in the basement and then saved, you'll "fall" forever. Also, you'll only see a purple sky. But to the other survivors you are still in the game. So my SWF buddy went to the basement to guide me by shouting which direction the exit is.
---
We laughed so hard, and managed to escape.
---
I don't know if a bunch of people who are voting are at work and therefore not looking for and upvoting posts about it or what, but it's so prevalent that I can't believe it hasn't gotten more attention (read: be the entire front page). It's 100% reproducible, and yet BHVR refers to it in the most vague way possible on its known issues and I don't think we're getting a bug fix today.

nah I got u man wasnt coming at u or anythig was just giving my feedback on DCers and the inspiration behind the meme really

Ah okay... weird.
---
&gt; The DC penalty will have no direct effect on anything.
---
The time it takes to down and hook the survivor is already more than we're getting right now on average for a DC, and for killers they'll get more point and for sure hook and such.
---
It's better.
---
It's not perfect, but it's better. DCing is fucking dog shit and anyone who does it is a fucking entitled twerp. Suiciding on hook is ALMOST as bad, but not quite. Fuck people who DC, and I wish they would keep logs and actually look to ACTUALLY give bans and such, cause they definitely don't.
