Hhhahah. 
---
---
---
Fuckin neoooow
---
Why you say that
---
Nah. Game's over at that point. People would stop leaving the last hooked survivor about five seconds after the patch notes dropped, then you'd be fussing about them camping and downing you as soon as you got off. It's time to go into the next match at that point; doing otherwise wastes everyone's time.
---
Never knew this thanks! I usually just fake the direction I walk in. Count in my head and dash the other way xD
---
damn you beat me with 1 minute
---
Myers walks at 105 in tier 1 and at 115 in t2/t3, and then there's Burger King Myers but let's not talk about that.
---
Weren't Remember Me and Alert just on the shrine a few weeks ago?
---
i'll take Remember Me, i already have Alert and Monitor &amp; Abuse andddd what's that other perk?
---
Every facet of a killer is important add ons included, sorry but you wont see many if any killers without add ons unless they are doing dailies even then they may run some. 
---
[removed]
---
That I did not know thank you 
---
Who create this ?
---
Finally, Wake Up! We haven't seen that perk often enough at all!
---

---
sigh 
---
finally, something i can get down to
---
Yeah that was my first thought 
---
I chant for haunted grounds every time wanting to see how shit goes
---
Wake up ! from Quentin.
---
Really? Or because this sub is no place for your negativity 
---
Devs talked about this recently. 
---
You know what will happen if they allow the last survivor to attempt to escape? The killer will sit in his face until he tries. Nothing will change. 
---
Not saying I don't enjoy these memes, cause I do, but unless you already have a bunch made, you might run out of quality content to post every day.
---
Ufffffff
---
I believe the OP is the artist. Just check out her/his history. 
---
No... decisive strike is obviously a crutch perk as it gives you an easy second chance to prolong a chase after getting knocked down from the killer winning the chase. It rewards you even when you lose the chase just like how NOED rewards you for letting survivors get all the gens done. And insta heal is just self explanatory...
---
Lolssssss
---
Unlucky. 
---
I really appreciate the game that the developers managed to create, but I've been playing for a little over a months and haven't seen or heard anything to convince me that they are actually competent, especially with the way Legion was introduced.
---
So basically we just have one piece of info we've had for quite some time now. Cool. 
---
What?
---
I‚Äôve been thinking about getting clown. He looks funny af and is actually a really good killer when in the right hands. I been a wraith main just because everyone has him as a bottom tier killer. And I think his bell is really cool lol having no terror radius is awesome
---
I made it. :D But my friend only wanted Feng's cosmetic though. 
---
Do you like it?
---
Yeah, then you add in Iridescent Head and it just becomes unfun
---
Yeah, 360's suck.  A couple tips for that:
---
* Your lunge homes in a little.  Plus, while you attack, your weapon sticks out in front of you, even if you turn.  Combine these two and if you see which direction they spun, you can quickly turn that way and maybe even get a hit in.
---
* Building on the last point, 360's only really work if you're right on top of them, so I lunge 99% of the time.  From there, it's just a matter of following blood/scratch marks/moaning noises right to them.  You'll still lose plenty of people tho, there are a lot of hiding spots.
---
* Tbh I don't know which ones are unsafe either, I just chase them down, and if I feel like a chase has gone on too long, I just drop it and head for a generator.
---
A tip I forgot for my last list:
---
* BBQ is good, but don't overestimate it.  The aura read only lasts 4 seconds, and only works cross-map.  By the time you get there, they can easily be gone.  Instead use it to make informed desicions about what to do next.
---
I believe I said this in my last post, but this game is hard for killers, especially new ones.  Unfortunately, there are toxic groups out there who play just to bully killers.  Don't give up, and don't let the bullies get to you.
---
It's the Unbreakable avatar for console since they don't have Bill.

Teabagging doesn't happen that often and even then it's only really done at exit gates or when a Survivor is cocky (and they usually get punished for it).  Farming teammates is no worse than a support/other teammate trying to take farm from your lane and feeding the other team kills.  Disconnects and AFKs happen regularly enough in LoL as well.  And again, you can leave the lobby shortly after the end of a match.  You don't need to sit there and talk with people.  
---
With DBD it's forgettable and easy enough to move on, not to mention it doesn't happen _that_ regularly.  Half the time "farming" teammates are just stupid players who don't know any better or are playing poorly, and non-asshole Killers tend to go after farmers instead of tunneling/doubling down on folks unhooked right in front of them.   
---
Most of the "toxic" elements in DBD aren't even toxic, toxic has just become a blanket term for anything deemed anti-fun such as using certain perks or Killers or items.  This community is full of folks with victim complexes on both sides of the aisle which woefully exaggerates the perceived toxicity.   There is certainly toxicity to be had, but most of it is easily ignored or dealt with.  In comparison LoL is full of filth that you have to regularly deal with and it's much easier to have one bad game ruin it for the rest of your play session.  
---
I‚Äôm aware they‚Äôre both tactics, doesn‚Äôt mean camping at the end game isn‚Äôt toxic
---
they did? It worked in kyf tho 
---
maybe he whatched somd sexy content of myers on a porn site ... üòè
---
I agree that there is no reason to let you try. Once they do the killers will just wait till struggle phase before they go kick the other gens/pallets and such. Plus if you succeed what then? You may hop off and on the off chance they don't wait the brief second of invulnerability and possible dead hard you are going right back up.
---
Why do you think it's an exploit? Is just a mechanic, like breaking pallets or vaulting windows.
---
I want more !
---
liar!
---
Parkour billy is both hilarious and impressive 
---
But now that I think you could just look up instead of dropping the Meg. Would save you time.
---
Instablinds haven‚Äôt been a thing in well over a year. 
---
just played 3 min ago no problem here :(
---
Ok. 
---
Been thinking of doing something silly like this. "Work" on the gens with survivors and anyone who blows it up gets stabbed, then resume work. :3
---
Thank you very much! XD
---
I heard that the licensed character is so hard to get any new cosmetic.
---
Dude that is my wife as well. Plays a sneaky Kate, fully immersed. Bitches when other people do the same lol
---
Why is this not the most upvoted post in this sub?
---
Yes but the thing people don‚Äôt seem to realize is not all totem spawns are going to be good. That would be bad game design as hex perks are high risk high reward and making every spawn good would ruin this.
---
Yeah. The swf arguement does make a good point but swf can make any killer and match useless and unfun. 
---
If you are the last survivor and the killer knows you can KOBE or Deliverance out why would he walk away. I mean, there are no other survivors. He would just obviously stand in front of you, auto sacrifice makes thngs faster.
---
You're not thinking long term OP.
---
I do :)
---
damn im on vacation i need monitor :-(
---
I'm exagerating on purpose
---
Yo, I can't wait to use this skin in online matches! Thanks 4 leaking!!!

I watch tru3 and puppers

puppers is papa

No one said anything about '  teabagging an inch away from the exit ' where the fuck do you see that? They were ALL far away and none of them did that Jesus Christ..
---
a man of culture, except noob uploads every 829493 years 
---
r/dbdgonewild probably?
---
Apparently this new cosmetic set comes with a new mori animation, you get to strange a survivor with a roll of Flex Tape.
---
true, still Love this cunt 
---
I get all the disconnected folks while playing Leatherface. Idk why. Maybe it's the usain Bubba build. 
---
Cool idea actually. :D
---
My mistake then, I‚Äôve just seen far too many people that talk as though they still exist and assumed. 
---
That's just a situation where im not against it I wasn't literally talking about your game specifically
---
Love it
---
as do i uwu
---
You mean 7 times, those angsty teens can‚Äôt even stab right smh
---
A game mode where the killer has to complete objectives in order to kill themselves while survivors attempt to stop them in any way possible with all their available tools
---
I can do this all day. 
---
Understandable
---
Then you get hooked and see them all urban immersing around.
---
Shrine fuckin knows the only Quentin perk I want is pharmacy
---
Pigs who do the gens with the survivors ü§†
---
I didn't mean open I meant the siren thing that goes off and it's fine by me to camp when the exits are unlockable but not face camp out of spite just because you couldn't get 1 kill so you have to play toxic.. 
---
Welcome to solo.
---
All the survivors are potatoes, unless you are the killer. 
---
They don't need remove the struggle phase auto sacrifice just the attempt escape one, the killer might have event items to grab or pallets to break or any other extra point things that could pull them away.
---
This, there‚Äôs some YouTube videos showing the timing with each flashlight. It‚Äôs hard to get right.

Everyone should care about the other side having fun. We‚Äôre a small community, comparatively speaking. The game should be enjoyable for as many people as possible to keep it alive. 
---
By the way, ‚Äúenjoyable‚Äù does not necessarily equal ‚Äúwinning.‚Äù I have good games all the time where I ‚Äúlose‚Äù but I had a blast. 
---
Ah, ok. No hard feelings lol.
---
I didn't, I wouldn't doubt it if the survivors where memeing though.
---
https://youtu.be/2dq-b8KzI1E
---
I didn‚Äôt see the flair so I got excited. This is fine too.
---
I'm talking about FACE camping if that's your 'move' then you're not going to get a lot of points from one person your just going to make yourself look amateur and no one will enjoy playing with you.
---
One of the reasons I‚Äôm maiming spirit right now is that she has so many different loadout combinations you can run that play differently. I go out of my way for pink and purple add ons on her
---
Legion is even better for BP IMO. Though people hate him more it seems
---
Everytime i play with my rank 10-15 friends I equip OoO because it triggers killers so hard, guaranteed to tunnel me.
---
Sally has a dangerous thigh game with that dress
---
You can grab them as soon as they reach for them it's not difficult? Way better than standing with your face embedded in theirs like an asshole.
---
I thought you used to be able to?
---
The wiki is not ran or maintained by the Devs. Perhaps if you‚Äôre going to hold something in such high esteem, you should verify the veracity of your source. 
---
For honor is not dbd. Gameplay is different, I shouldn't even need to point that out.
---
I've seen more Michael's, trappers, and wraiths then I have seen nurse, hillbilly, and legion. "That makes a statement to where they are". What kind of logic is this? You see less of them so they must be worse (they arent) and even then, your personal experience doesnt equal what everyone experiences. Also this talk about how huntresses ability is easy to avoid shows you just arent a good huntress player or you just haven't went against a good huntress. A good huntress player makes it to where her ability is borderline unavoidable with aiming and planning ahead. Ducking is a way to try to dodge her hatchets, but an actual good huntress player who has spent time learning her won't have this issue where ducking is an actual effeciant way to avoid her hatchets. By open fields I mean where there are no pallets, vaults, etc. Meaning there are some things like rocks in the way, but it is generally an open field where any killer can score hits. Some autohaven wrecker maps have some of those areas. Difference between clown and huntress is that it can be a hit for clown and a down for a huntress. Timing your hatchets and reading your opponent eliminates most of the counter play to huntress that you mentioned
---
Yeah me too i just bought it now i just need Discordence and BBQ and Chili
---
Saaame lol
---
Haha 420 is da weed drug and 69 is the decks. This has been posted like 30 times before, and it wasn't even funny to begin with.
---
R/scp might love this
---
The guy in the back looks awfully similar to Tobuscus
---
Oh okay I didn't know but in this game no one taunted and still they decided to turn toxic
---
I‚Äôm more than happy to knock down an injured survivor that was unhooked in front of my face. I‚Äôll gladly deny points to a teammate who is sandbagging like that, especially since I know they won‚Äôt go do gens anytime soon. Once the guy is back on the hook, I just go find other people though
---
Oh hai 106
---
"Your life matters," implores Claudette while David wrestles the katana out of Spirit's hand before she could finish the seppuku
---
At least I was close
---
How long does it take for other killer's taught perks to appear in the bloodweb? I'm on level 50, haven't prestiged yet, and I keep getting useless add-ons in the bloodweb, no new perks so far. The bloodweb has already been renewed like 10+ times. 
---
Not terrible, but we did get remember me not too long ago, M&amp;A is really nice but the rest is eh... 
---
Definitely not. But I was thinking, I have these 2 teachable perks I don't care about, and they keep appearing in the bloodweb. Maybe I should get them first before any new ones appear? It's kind of stupid if it works like that bc it's almost like the game forces you to teach perks. 
---
Yes, that's what she does.
---
I‚Äôm really liking the new nurse reserve blink. A much needed change. ^^^^/s
---
Pretty new, 6 hours logged according to steam, but I love the game!
---
I agree with all of your points in this but I find it hilarious that you said OP ‚Äúgets personal very quickly‚Äù after what you wrote in your very first response. He was only responding in the same kind of way you wrote to him. 
---
I play with music blasting; I run premonition so it'll catch killers without me having to hear out for them. The only counter to this is Michael but honestly he's just going to jumpscare me regardless whether music is playing or not. I find it a much funner experience with music.
---
Only as survivor, tried a couple of times as killer and is just to distracting to focus.
---
Nice. You are going to have a ton of fun with it!
---
360s are way stronger on console, poor killers cant flick
---
This could actually be a pretty good format for the sole reason of Brooklyn nine-nine being dope as fuck
---
im very close to getting all survivor perks and its so addicting
---
you should always get a perk every bloodweb. that way there‚Äôs no chance of it appearing in a later bloodweb and more chance that you‚Äôll get the perk you want. also, getting a perk asap means the entity will start taking away add ons sooner which means you‚Äôll level up faster 
---
It is the 13th of every month 
---
Being able to unhook yourself just to let the killer hook you again 5 seconds later is not worth it.
---
I knew chapters but didn‚Äôt know paragraphs was the official term. Either way not sure why I‚Äôve been downvoted to 0 for it.
---
I can‚Äôt play without music anymore tbh. Game feels overly bland when I‚Äôm not listening to something in the background. 
---
So you want infinites? I... don‚Äôt... what the fuck? 
---
I wouldn't buy perks from the shrine unless they're from a character you dont own and dont plan on getting, honestly just level them up to unlock teachables, you're eventually gonna get tired with the character you're using anyways and will play with others, so you might as well.
---
I don‚Äôt think it works if you‚Äôre working on the gen, you gotta los it with the hook
---
Accurate. Except for me, the thir1s panel is a hooked survivor.
---
Devil's advocate: they don't have to take your feelings into account when they decide to leave.
---
No, it's the discount Amazon Box. They couldnt get the rights and licencing for the real deal.
---
As someone who actually plays and understands killer and how the game works, it‚Äôs true whether you like it or not
---
Mike is annoying early game and endgame but if survs set up correctly hes an easy escape
---
Lmao this happened to me yesterday. As I was midway cleansing a hex totem my teammate popped another hex totem. I saw the hex Ruin symbol still up on the side of the screen so I assumed my teammate popped either Devour Hope or Third Seal. As soon as I broke it I ran for a second and then immediately stopped when I saw the exposed status effect on the side of the screen. I just stood in that one spot for about six seconds lol. 
---
What does SWF mean?
---
There is nothing wrong with this game. Huntress's hatchets work fine. There is no war in Ba Sing Se 
---
i‚Äôd run spine chill instead, it‚Äôll counter myers a bit. but i just find it impossible because i can hear injured survivors better so i can heal them, or hear injured survivors and down them. 
---
Is this loss?
---
Does that mean people who think Legion isn't ok think balanced means "I never get hit and can run around dropping pallets all day, and if I screw up I just shank a bitch to get a fourth chance"?
---
wtf
---
Yup, but at what time? Or is it random?
---
I usually do, but I have to mute it as soon as the game gets intense. It's also really distracting if you're as blind as me when playing as killer. 
---
(My personal fav is Another one bites the dust) 
---
ill be on facetime so i can hear someone , and have one half of my headphones off
---
And waste your items and add ons and offerings and everyone‚Äôs time and anyone not on your team and the name of Narnia because you don‚Äôt deserve that or anything but a swift removal from the game. As soon as servers come up though they‚Äôll be able to ban for DCing so have fun getting perks banned for being a giant wuss
---
its actually not reportable if you do it for 2+ minutes if someone down there has an activated rbt on, scummy but not technically holding the game hostage. after all the rbt timer is 2 minutes and a half.
---
i always try to put music on but turn it off soon after because i play the agro when im survivor so others do gens
---
Is this loss? ;)
---
honestly
---
stand in the center of the stairs, don't move, and if you hit someone your collision is removed for a bit yes
---
this is some good bait
---
What would they call him?
---
My favorite was when I won the hatch standoff while blinded. While I chased her to hatch and she threw the firework so I was blinded but at the moment I was blinded I rushed forward mashing m1 and somehow I caught her jumping into the hatch. Boy it was good.
---
If you play killer, Leatherface is essential because of BBQ and Chilli, as others have mentioned. If you have it at tier 3, and you get all 4 stacks, you can get 45k+ per game. Shattered Bloodline is also good, for Spirit Fury, which is one of the 4 best killer perks, and  Flesh and Mud is good for Ruin.
---
That's when the killer must go Plus Ultra!
---
mm me too he‚Äôs a big papa
---
So? At least it gives the survivor a choice and gives Killer more blood points so who cares.
---
Double Insidious Leatherfaces, beaten by 7 claudettes with flashlights.

---
Nice flair. 
---
MEG MAINS UNITE!
---
SPRINT BURST ACTIVATE!

Billy/leatherface team lol billy gets the downs and LF camps the hook. There would be a lot of annoying killer teams going on lol
---
It's a 100% chance of showers today! üòÇ
---
I just looked up some videos. That looks insane. Also looks like it requires a fair bit of skill / knowledge of which spots you can pull it off. Do you need to run speed addons?
---
Sounds right :D
---
wow sorry people are being so rude to you
---
I don't see the big deal. They should have just finished the gens and left if they weren't interested. Or even DCed and moved on to the next game, whatever. There's no reason to get pissed about it.
---
True, they can choose not to learn and become better players and avoid every hatchets game, but it doesn‚Äôt affect MY feelings lol. Hatchets are a fun time addon, not for serious. But I still get quick decent points for DC games. I just think it‚Äôs damaging to the game to have all these babies running around with their trigger finger on the DC button the instant something goes against their favor. Same with DCs against legion, doc, moris, etc.
---
Grow up and git good!
---
This is weirdly cute, nice stuff.
---
That's how I play standard :)
---
There's limited time to grab from a rescue, and it only happens if the would be rescuer is an idiot. A good Survivor will bait a hit and get the save, or draw the Killer's attention so someone else can get the save. The only way they don't all escape is if the Killer camps or the Survivors make a mistake.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Me: on second hook in basement vs Freddy
---
Claudette: runs all the way across map to me only to get inside a locker right above the basement and stay in it until I die
---
Spectated that dick afterwards looking for the hatch while the last survivor is being chased even though there was only 1 gen left they could‚Äôve been working on
---
Different game
---
Two people kill themselves on first hook
---
Me: gets chased for 10+ mins thinking how have no gens popped yet
---
*gets downed* see Claudette walking around the edge of the map doing nothing
---
Messaged them after ‚Äúwhy tf were you not doing gens‚Äù ‚Äúwas looking for the hatch‚Äù THERE WERE STILL 5 GENS &amp; NO RUIN bitch why do I still get baby survivors at purple ranks
---
*England* being the code name for Freddy's DLC is clearly a reference to Robert Englund, Freddy's original actor.
---
Face camping is often a deterrent to other Survivors attempting to make a save, and it prevents them from blinding them for a save.
---
I watch the simpsons lol
---
Face camping when there's no need to is in no way non-toxic.
---
Gens are done, face camping is a deterrent to rescues, stop being a salty baby.

well, farming completly Breaks the game for everyone who wants to have fun, so I can unterstand their anger, but maybe you should have just finished the game and moved on?
---
Just heal yourself it's not that hard
---
Basically if the killer is bad be extra careful or cleanse totems 
---
either bad, or just preparing for Endgame 
---
That's my point they WEREN'T attempting to. They were all injured and the doors weren't open at the end they were stood which he could clearly see. He decided to stand in my face because he couldn't catch me the whole game and it pissed him off and it's his own fault for making the dumb decision to carry on chasing. It's a typical childish killer that has to turn toxic in order to get a kill.

Dwight got trapped in a locker and suffocated, has been a stress induced hallucination the entire series.  I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs not what happened in the manga, that plot twist is easily one of the best moments in DbD history and the reveal was one of the most terrifying moments in the entire series.
---
Yes
---
Oh, so all those people in the post game chat were just inviting me to play the new game mode with them.
---
No, and yes.
---
Doctor to find them, Legion to kill them.
---
I always do this thing where I carry the last surv to a hook, usually he just accepts his fate and doesn't even wiggle. Then I  just walk away from the hook and get him to the hatch. 
---
I get so much love in end-game chat after that, haha. 
---
Have they EVER put BBQ and Chili in the shrine? I looked in the last year and they have never put the perk in shrine.
---
True, thanks.
---
1. No you don't, it's just rng. Try another box.
---
2. It only opens the hatch. You can add add-ons to it that lets you see certain auras.
---
I'm glad you like it. :D
---
Ik what you mean, I figured they'd be the hardest but they were the two I did the easiest. Meg and Quentin were the two hardest for me
---
Thank you!
---
How do you have a choice to go up against a SFW? By disconnecting?
---
I'm battling their disconnect with my disconnect?
---
OP you have fine taste in memes
---
I didnt mind meg and quentins is like running a survivor with no perks his 3 perks are... ok
---
I think there was a video on youtube from 2 years ago of like an enormous amount of survivors but I can't find it.
---
Skeleton soldier is pretty damn good
---
Devil's advocate: I don't have to take survivor's feelings into account if I wanted to unplug my internet, wasting their add-ons, items, and offerings, when I have a bad game.
---
No. That makes me an asshole. Disconnecting just because the opposing killer is using stuff that **the opposing killer should have access to** makes them an asshole.
---
Doctor is a good purchase imo. He isn't that strong meta wise I guess, but he triggers survivors so badly it makes up for it. Not to mention he's one of the best consistent blood point farming killers in the game. 
---
Yep. We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever and No Mither together are pointless. Can‚Äôt take hits for teammates if it knocks you down on the first try, and unhooking makes you way more vulnerable to the killer circling back. 
---
Twice. Last time was October 2017.
---
Only idiots DC mid animation lol. Most just force quit when hidden offerings are shown or as soon as it loads to screw everyone. 
---
Killers idea of balanced is "never have to worry about pallet loops and I can down them without trying".   :\^)
---
The clown tries to use his toxins to end it all, but Kate noticed and uhhh(shut cant think of a way to use her perks) stops him?
---
Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop! My fianc√© got it for me once I started playing DBD
---
YouTube, I would sat brickyorchids vids on how to play each killer, even though I don't think he posts much anymore of dbd
---
just dont buy legion dude we dont want another one out there
---
Yay, just means I can be tea-bagged by four people instead of tunneled by one.
---
I play a song while waiting for the game to boot and to load into a lobby. Somedays I end up cutting the song early, but most often I end up in a game with about 30s left for the song, so I just play it out. 
---
I could give plenty of examples where Tru3 has felt Empathy for farmed Survivors in front of his face. Depending on the situation, he'll do one of the few. If he's doing very well, he'll hit the farmed Survivor and leave them on the ground and deny them their extra safe unhook points and chase after the farmer. If he's doing badly and needs to get rid of somebody, he'll gladly just rehook the farmed person. Not every Killer has to play by specific rules. You gotta do what you gotta do.
---
Depends, who do you plan to main or play more in particular? Among the 3 you said I'd say Pig (Surveillance and MYC are all-around amazing) or Spirit (Spirit Fury is awesome and good on most killers once it goes rare, Haunted Ground is good, but situational, and Rancor is as well.)
---
Survivors egos are so fragile. *Oh, I died? Well, it‚Äôs definitely not because I got outplayed, that‚Äôs impossible... So it must be hacks! Cheating! EZ ban for killer, GG.*
---
Facts 
---
Weeb Nurse is the best Nurse
---
yea, I remember there being a ton of gens needing to be done, and survivors connecting into the middle of said game. 
---
If you're stupid enough to unhook the survivor right underneath the killer's nose, it's not the Killer's fault he just downs the guy again.
---
If you unhooked the survivor and the killer wasn't there, how is it tunneling if that's the first person the Killer saw again?
---
If you run into two survivors, one injure and one full health, why the hell would you chase the full health survivor when the biggest momentum swing in the game is getting that first survivor killed?
---
sally got leg wtf

Hag is fantastic when you start liberally using the traps. You don't necessarily want to trap every objective, just random points in the map survivors won't recognize as areas for traps.
---
Also, get discordance ASAP because in my honest opinion, it is the single best killer perk in the game.
---
im with the other guy, spirit sounds like the best option here
---
Hasagi
---
Angry pug, zubat lel, noob3, monto, puppers
---
fair point
---
Maybe you weren't fully blinded, it depends on the intensity of the flashlight (+add ons) how fast you are blinded. Flashlights have a gradual animation so it doesn't mean you got 100% blinded.

---
you know whats up
---
go up to them, touch their butts, and just let the almighty auto aim guide you, don't lunge
---
I tend to look back during a chase and end up being stuck.
---
The only downside would be if the killers team up and tag team a survivor. Like, idk if it would spawn new strats since going into a jungle gym is just doom when they split up. I know there was a glitch where tru3 spawned as Myers and one of the survivors glitch spawned as Nurse, albeit it was more 2v3 and not 2v8, but the survivors were wrekt.
---
My personal favorite troll is to load up as Legion and then moonwalk the entire game.
---
Not when I get a hit, not when a survivor is bleeding.
---
The moment that game starts up, S all day every day.
---
you're proving my point by saying that
---
Good. Stuff like this only happened to me when I was using NOED.  
---
Oh, I thought you were talking about botched stealth attempts. I‚Äôve had that happen to me a few times lol. I usually only peek in vital moments. Basically DH or not around the pallet or do I need this locker?
---
i always put game audio as a priority if im in a chat party
---
This + Pebble makes survivors OP.
---
Nice lagswitch right there
---
Demi/Noob3 imo Monto is annoying 
---
are the pigs addons "crate of gears" and "bag of gears" still bugged and not working properly? never heard of them getting fixed. I just know that they don't actually slow down getting the traps off.
---
monto is pretty loud but i like him
---
Aight thanks
---
thank you atleast it isnt part of the adept is like certain objectives like
---
Laurie hitting ds
---
David getting 4 stacks
---
Adam getting all 4 or 8 stacks I forgot
---
quentin opening a gate 
---
etc
---
Hey if they're playing Claudette in Gideon and you have to basement chase... it is another kind of torture for a killer. They are ACTUALLY invisible.
---
Unfortunately, no NOED on my Level 3 Hillbilly, lol
---

---
Dang, I used a splinter to play as Myers and loved it. But with student loans I feel bad shelling out for it when I got payments to make (got the game as a gift for helping someone shift houses)
---
A) Right off the bat you could see all three survivors going for the hook, with one plainly out in the open and a second right behind some cinder blocks.
---
B) "Find the Exit", so there's literally no other objective for the Killer to go for.
---
C) We're only seeing your side of it, considering you have DS and we don't know if you looped him for 5 minutes or even had a flashlight.
---
I still look at Shrine updates when I‚Äôm not on the game, even though I have all survivor teachables (apart from Tapp‚Äôs and Jeff‚Äôs). I have half of the killer teachables, but each week I have all of the perks available on the Shrine. Force of habit form before I started levelling everyone? Easy honus bloodpoints for me I guess.
---
I think I was in your match lol. Was you playing as a Claudette ? And was it on the map ‚ÄúRed Forest‚Äù ?
---
Yeah, that would be awful!
---
Distracts him with her ASSets.
---
 ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I think it goes both ways. 
---
You can have a killer that can‚Äôt get past green ranks, going up against a team of normally rank 1-2 swf.
---
I‚Äôm actually glad for rank reset. I ran out of my good add-ons for Freddy and now I‚Äôm getting rocked every game. Feels bad.
---
See, you might have gotten acknowledgment for these speculations if you had lead with them. But instead you started off with your silly(and literally incorrect) negativity about whether or not anyone wanted this ship.
---
In-depth story analysis ain't gonna save you from that.
---
Oh YES
---
Legion is only mid tier (at best) because their time to down sucks.  But Legion would be completely broken and overpowered if they could down folks faster without addons. 
---
Morf, Panda, and Vince are probably my favorite folks.
---
I do enjoy watching Tru3 a bit as well. He's always been pretty cool to me and was very encouraging when I first started getting into the game.
---
Puppers and Cahla are sweethearts. Lefty and Josh are solid killers.
---
#Dead by Daylight player count drops to 0
---
Yeah yeah keep justifying your toxic tactics.. and actually if you read my post before it clearly says it's nothing to do with dying it's to do with people ruining the game by resorting to being toxic. 
---
DING! DING! DING! DING!
---
We have a winner! 
---
Wtf did I say that was different than the top comments? What is this subreddit?
---
why not?
---
I suggest practicing more with the chase. You seem to be the immersed type. Honestly, sometimes you have to led the killer to someone to save yourself. Esp. When you wasted the killers time for 3 gens. Youre helping the team. Once you heal up you can try to get into another chase for the last two gens. There is a plan to all the madness.
---
Again, why?
---
You act as though he *has* to give them a chance to get you off the hook, when he flat out doesn't.
---
absolutely not 
---
One step ahead of that! I'm playing on Xbox, and I have my privacy settings set to where only Friends can message me. Most they can do is scream loudly at themselves, which gives me great joy to think about.
---
Survivor! I prefer playing the scary way haha
---
Not sure yet, I want to get everyone to 50 before I decide on a main, although of the 3 I've leveled, I liked Doc.  I think I'll play a few matches of both Pig and Spirit to see which one I like more.
---
maybe, but depending on how the game went, he might have been fed up with this guy 
---
Some survivors are also having troubles not just killer 
---
He did see them and knew where they were but my xbox captures go only to 58 seconds so believe what you want but that's how it was :/
---
Anytime I see this kind of comment it makes me sad.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
There are people who actually believe Legion is fine because they can't play killer properly and Legion is the only character they don't rage-out playing.
---
Hahaha.
---
Jesus,great event BHVR has.
---
That's a shame
---
Yes due to him having no map pressure they could never have justified making him 110%
---
they dont ruin anything by Camping in this Situation.
---
And it doesnt need to be justified cause there is nothing wrong with it
---
When the gates are powered there's nothing wrong with camping, if the killer leaves you are pretty much guaranteed to escape.
---
If you do trapper and pig combo,than all survivors who get the reverse bear will die because the jigsaw boxes won't spawn in
---
like this whole cry-post
---
Cool reply. You didn't really tell me how I was moving goalposts. I don't think I was. I said it's pretty hard to chainsaw decent survivors. And you said that LF can easily get insta downs at all ranks. Actually, what you said was "moving goalposts" or changing the topic. I didn't say it was hard at all ranks, I specifically said it's hard to chainsaw decent survivors. They'll loop you in a way to if they're gonna get hit, they're going to make you m1 them. 
---
Far from ‚Äúnothing‚Äù, it‚Äôs still very annoying
---
Try restarting the game also if steam try restarting steam as well or clearing cache or however if you can on steam 
---
She sings you the song of her people
---
With exit gates open he'd be stupid to leave.  What you want him to do, go in the corner so you can be saved? I'm a 50/50 survivor killer,  but even I understand end game tactics. Cry me a river.
---
Fed up because you can't catch anyone in fair play? That still doesn't justify face camping. That's like saying it's okay to DC because you had a bad game..
---
leatherface basement security isn't fun or funny. Just creates a boring fucking game and an excuse for the killer to derank.
---
Daddy Myers for sure
---
The unfortunate downside of licensed killers.  
---
Most killers run noed so I never see my adrenaline as a crutch, it‚Äôs more a little sprint boost so hopefully someone can get a gate while I get one shot by the killer.
---
OMG, I MISSED THAT.
---
No its not equal with a DC....
---
Ans Camping doesnt need to be justified cause its not against any rules
---
What if pig and michael because they wouldn't have a terror radius
---
In [this picture,](https://i.imgur.com/GGFXrHr.jpg) I'm being facecamped by a cloaked Wraith. You can clearly see my teammates "rushing the hook."
---
In [this picture,](https://i.imgur.com/HGS23UA.jpg) I was vs a Trapper. He was nowhere near me, there was no terror radius, he'd fucked off a loooong time ago. None of them came for me until I was deep into second stage -- hell, none of them left the house before then.
---
Sometimes killers are assholes. Sometimes survivors are stupid. Sometimes both sides suck equally.
---
I used a survivor pudding right after getting BBQ tier 2 on P1 Huntress, and this same thing happened to me. Really sucks when that happens, especially when you use a good bloodlines offering. 
---
Really? You can do that?
---
No they could have ran off and escaped without helping while he camped and it would have still been fair it's not about escaping it's about not resorting to toxic behaviour.
---
I think off the bat I can just say he's securing his kill. Gates are open, games's over. You were just the lucky survivor to get chosen.
---
Read what post? The title? The title is you whining about how killers say they don't have a choice, then  a video **showing us a situation where the killer didn't have a choice**.
---
 
---
The moment the killer went after Tapp, Jake would have pulled you off, and it would have went from one sacrifice to zero.
---
Are you **really** complaining about how the bad man stood in your bubble instead of sitting 5 feet back? Are you **really** that pathetic?
---
I'm a rank 7 (1 tick away from 6) killer and never knew that.
---
Drift King Billy is where it's really at.
---
Face camping is different from camping
---
It‚Äôs just a bit shorter than your base TR. honestly it‚Äôs about 12-16
---
if I get in a Situation like the Wraith, I would Camp as well
---
What does that matter in this context? There‚Äôs no functional difference at this point
---
We're talking about face camping not camping. Then go look up the bannable offences targetting is one of them.
---
Honestly I don't doubt that 
---
*Schizo. If you're going to insult me be intelligent enough to spell it, otherwise it's just embarrassing. 
---
So, let's go over the option list, because you still don't get this:
---
1) He chases after Tapp. Jake gets you off the hook. Tapp goes to the nearest Jungle Gym, blinds the killer with the flashlight in his hand, and escapes. Killer gets no kills.
---
2) Killer leaves the hook out of his own volition. You get pulled off the hook, Killer has to track you down and try to catch you before you get to the exit. Killer gets no kills.
---
3) Killer walks back 5 to 10 feet. Jake has Borrowed Time. Killer hits you, you make it to the exit gate, Killer gets no kills.
---
4) Killer walks back 5-10 feet. Jake doesn't have Borrowed Time.  You get hit and get rehooked. You still bitch about a camping killer because the killer has no where else to go.
---
5) Killer walks back 5-10 feet. Jake pulls you down, Jake gets hit, gets hooked, you leave for exit gate. We miss out on this bitchfest because you were skilled and got out. Goody.
---
6) Killer smacks Jake/Tapp and gets two hooks. Now he has to patrol two hooks and potentially lose both of those. 
---
7) Killer goes apeshit and manages to get every survivor on a hook, because the people looping him all game suddenly get collectively hit on the head. 
---
Guess what? There's only about two of those 7 options that are actually likely to happen that work out for the killer, and you're not able to understand that the Killer was only doing what they could to get that kill. 
---
Get over yourself.
---
facecamping is still just Camping, you genius.
---
Ans how was he "targetting" you? I think you mixed something up
---
Apparenlty there's a bug so I could be wrong 
---
"Damn, why do all these killers keep dodging my SWF? We just want to play a game together!"
---
Can you please buy leatherface in 4 days?
---
Wanting one kill = entitled
---
Demanding that killers play a certain way that increases your odds of escaping but also creates an insanely small chance that they get 2K = not entitled
---
Lmfao okay üëå 
---
Maybe it just needed a restart. Still bullshit that I'd be 11 away from that 4th token but now I'm 66 away. Fucking makes me not want to play this game.
---
How is it different in this scenario, though? He's not going to let you off the hook no matter if he's right in your face or 10 feet away. 
---
I would still shit my pants
---
This is amazing, please make more!
---
Already got him, sorry :(  has BBQ ever appeared in the shrine before?
---
Will they ever buff Quentin's/Tappd perks?  
---
You keep saying this, but never explain it other than "It's toxic and bad, don't do it".
---
they didn't attempt understandably because he was embedded in my fucking face like a piercing. No I'm complaining about toxic attitudes that make the game less fun I've died plenty of times and still had a great time but every now and again you get shitty killers that face camp out of spite or survivors that bring killers to you ect.
---
They're not going to change this. As mentioned by previous players, most survivors would hang/resist out of spite to prolong the game. Not to mention that not everyone runs deliverance. The circumstances that you use to justify the action isn't beneficial in the long run.
---
Furthermore, killers would just sit there and wait for you to KOBE. Some will miss, yes, but once players become accustomed to this playstyle, we'll be back to players struggling and prolonging the game.
---
Also, this is such a niche scenario lol I wouldn't waste energy to request something so low-impacting.
---
I hate to say it but whenever I see a pig as the killer I always hope they are friendly, Amanda to cute to want to loop. 
---
You don‚Äôt post this here. Go to r/coldwindfarm 
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking. He is either taunting (for those that don‚Äôt see the difference between this and just camping, you gotta be kidding..) or is actually AFK/bugged
---
Is it still buggy I thought they fixed it? :l I remember some walls would turn a weird rainbow texture too
---
I play killer at rank 20 just for fun and because I suck as killer. I was a wraith, and we loaded into Lery's (OH BOY I LOVE THIS MAP AS SURVIVOR I KNOW EVERY CORNER OF IT). So, I should explain, when I play killer I usually just clown around and not kill survivors as long as the work as a team and the game is fun. So I proceed to down survivors, bring them to the middle of the map, then go collect another survivor. Keep in mind, I NEVER HOOK A SINGLE PERSON, like I said it's just for fun and I'm giggling like a school girl. sneak attacks with wraith are so fucking fun, especially when you know the map. I collected 3 survivors, let the 4th heal everyone. Then I start downing them and dribbling so everyone can wiggle out. Eventually, I get bored and just continually ding dong my bell until they open the door. 
---
Long story short, they accused me of cheating. It was an SWF they thought it was suspicious that I kept finding them. Like WTF you were so damn predictable, I know this map very well, and no one even attempted to loop me. Funniest part is one of them was a twitch streamer that claimed to be good at the game. Sometimes... I just don't know about people. 
---
I said face camping and targetting. For the 1000th time.
---
No one DC'd either so wtf
---
Overcharge was just like two shrines ago.
---
It was after the event hotpatch so I'd assume it's still that way
---
Literally making stories up seems to be your profession..
---
Not sure!! All I did was googled silly myer and got this. 
---
Communication in a team based game isn‚Äôt cheating. Dead By Daylight is described as a 4v1 game. Just because you aren‚Äôt a good at Killer doesn‚Äôt mean the other team is cheating. You‚Äôre bad. Get used to it.
---
What rank?
---
Yeah. You could **run around** with an axe as him. They really fucked that up.
---
Most killers do not run NOED 
---
Are you an Anime Studio?
---
Because someone's been Triggered!
---
yeh you right!
---
Thats why you always keep placing your traps 4head
---
An ideal build for a general killer imo would be ruin, bbq, nurse‚Äôs, and a flex slot that could go to enduring/ spirit fury.
---
Why discordance over any of those? And I‚Äôm not set in my ways obv so please try to convince
---
Enjoy your hour wait. :D
---
Just got mine about 30min ago.  Now it‚Äôs time for a break. 
---
what a savage
---
"No one wants to play with you"
---
/game has a random matchmaker where people can't see who the killer is until after the game is already over/
---
Ok.
---
I haven't had any but my biggest issue is lagging in chase :(
---
Nah, it only takes me like 10 minutes max to find a game. (: Just don‚Äôt like having to find a new Killer just because I‚Äôm rank 1. Lol
---
Well then
---
1. When running around a loop, keep as close to it as possible mast the time you can run while touching it and you won't loose momentum.
---
2. They had a huge pallet change a few months back, so it's good to try and learn where they spawn. A good perk for this is 'Windows of opportunity' which is a Kate Densen perk, if you don't have her you can buy her with either money or the in-game currency 'Irridecent Shards'
---
3. If there is a hex ruin, it's normally faster to just work through it rather then gen tapping or looking for the totem, most maps the totems are obvious so just have a look around while moving about.
---
4. An extremely common setup that is fairly good is: 
---
D-Strike
---
Adrenaline
---
Any of the perks that cause exhaustion (personal preference is balanced landing)
---
A perk of your choosing, normally this would have been self-care, but after the healing speed changes it's not worth it, bond is helpful.
---
Good perks can make or break a match.
---
5. You can only Vault through a window 3 times while in a chase. Keep track in your head, after it's blocked I think it's 40 seconds until it's unblocked (40 seconds is probably wrong)
---
6. Keep looking around while on a gen, even if you aren't in their terror radius. 
---
7.
---
Those are the survivor basics, I'm gonna include a few tips on how to survive against specific Killers.
---
The Trapper:
---
Think of places where you can easily run around without the killer getting you, now assume The Trapper has set traps there, if you walk slowly, instead of running you'll notice it say *Disarm Trap* at the bottom of your current. Disarming a trap will cause a load noise event and tell the killer someone was there. Don't walk in a chase, you'll just have to hope he didn't set any where you are. The window at the killer shack, and one of the corners there are really popular spots to place traps.
---
The Wraith:
---
There isn't much to say about him, when working on a gen just keep turning your camera to look for his shimmer, you should be turning your camera to try and spot the killer no matter who it is though.
---
Hillbilly: 
---
I'll be honest, I'm not to sure how to survive against Billy. When they charge there saw you want to keep an eye on them and see how close they are, you can try a quick switch in direction when the start there sawing. An example of this is, run in one direction, as soon as they start sawing run in the opposite direction, but then immediately turn back, because at the start of the chainsaw sprint they flick, which will let them turn extremely well, the fact opposite direction will make them use there flick and at most ranges they won't have enough time to fully turn back.
---
Nurse:
---
She's a hard one, on PC, she is a lot harder to beat then on console. Th main advice for beating her is to break line of site, because of how slow she is (She moves at 85% speed a survivor does) she has to use her blinks to find you, you'll have time to get away. If you can't break line of site, get as far away as possible.
---
The Hag:
---
The main thing against her is that crouching will not set of her traps. Also you can use a flashlight to break traps by shinning it on them for a few seconds.
---
I know there are a few more but I've got stuff to do, so I'll edit the comment later with some more
---
Definitely should waste time during the Chase to set up and beforehand if you actually want to be effective which takes MORE time because she's 110% speed.
---
Survivors using No Mither can also recover from the dying state. That sounded like a fun gameüëç
---
I just got my last coin. According to Steam, I played for 57.0 hrs past 2 weeks. 
---
I meant the downvotes for my comments. I'm saying that I don't understand why you or somebody else downvoted me asking you a question. But, whatever man. I'm just gonna say I don't understand the difference and agree to disagree.
---
I noticed that as well, I'm just ready for the event to go away 
---
A long one.....
---
"You're fine you're fine. Don't tell mom!"
---
Why does the function not exist in the game then? Do you think the devs meant to build the game with voice comms in mind then just forgot to put that in?
---
Wait hold up what. First of all, I do agree. It's not cheating. But you do realize why we have to use third party software to communicate right? They intentionally didn't add game chat for a reason. It takes away the fun. "Oh found ruin, he's chasing me, oh it's hag, let's all go body block, Im gonna flashlight, where are you guys, he's at the gate come get me." These are all common things my squad and I say. And I will say it kind of takes the fun out of being scared that the killers coming, or desperately searching for that hatch. I would prefer a proxy chat but people would still use 3rd party software, so I guess that's here to stay. Is it game breaking? Yes, but it's allowed so we do it. Getting raped by a 4 man swf legacy team with adrenaline, ds, borrowed, and self care doesn't mean "he's just bad". Of course that's an exaggeration but that doesn't mean he's bad. No one's bad for using perks in the game, and I think you should consider his point of view about how boring swf is. It's metagaming in a horror game. It has its pros and cons. Well there's my rant.
---
Who is faster, a mentally challenged man with a lump, an overweight old man, or a teenage track athlete?
---
Homeslice
---
It's usually because they don't get a lot of kills. To answer your question.
---
r/depressionmemes
---
Subbed thanks
---
She can kill you instantly ? Wat ?
---
hmm...I heard a certain Sarahnator6000 got a Bit upset about a certain Wraith 
---
The Story Of Feng Min: Across distances far and wide, her Alert senses kept her focus on the prying eyes of Doctor Herman Carter, Monitoring her every move, waiting for the chance to Abuse her lack of focus. The devious Doctor would instill a fear into Feng, one she would Remember him by the longer they stayed around one another. Eventually her last generator was powered but would she ever escape the hellish dream world or could she power through to Wake Up by the campfire for another trial? 
---
We will find out next week. 
---
Very engaging game mode
---
Iridescent hatchets. Doesn‚Äôt kill you instantly, it just puts you in downed state which is still very, very strong.
---
I‚Äôm emo and I need this in my life right now. 
---
That sounds a bit too easy I'll take it
---
I think it happened to me once but I just thought it was a glitch well wow
---
Oh please. LOL and Dota are basically the same game
---
It makes me sad as a rank 2. Its normally a rank 6 killer which further pushes my point of pips dont mean skill.
---
I am gonna swap for Lithe but sadly will prob wait for it to pop up in the Shrine. Had tons of fun with it in KYF
---
I have nothing against him but not a huge fan of Monrovia overall. I enjoy Noob3 and True quite a bit. Tru3 plays well enough on both sides and shows how far you can go with good fundamentals.
---
Pipping on legion just means they were bad.
---
sorry T.T hands are tough for me
---
They gave us a mali flag. I read somewhere that mandingos founded mali but im not sure about it being right. Anyways i also read that they were cannibals but we already have a cannibal, so im thinking maybe like a zulu warrior or the mali legend of some trickster thats been around for 100s of years. Maybe just a witch doctor. Its not easy searching for legends and monsters from mali. 
---
Great point! Seems like that was also the gensis of the tradition to use country names as the code for chapter releases, what a neat little peak into the BHVR dev team :D
---
There should be a bigger punishment for in-game dc's, and survivors who stick around should get a quitter bonus too
---
‚ÄúWho‚Äôs your daddy?‚Äù That games hilarious
---
Wish I could upvote a comment a dozen times. This is actually their *second* cry post about it. And this one's even worse, because there's now video evidence they're just being a salty baby.
---
Yeah, rank does not at all determine skill. Getting rank 1 killer is so insanely easy. I think camping should be on the devs. Like, it's so unfun for both sides honestly. They should change it somehow.
---
No, you can't think of any valid points. What you do is say "Oh I can't be bothered to argue with you because *whatever the fuck*". You can't provide any argument so you just back out before anything is said. Fucking dimwit.
---
Yikes. That's happened to me a few times but hasn't happened as recently. The last time was maybe 2 weeks ago.
---
the doctor and pig should also be steel
---
The hag should also be fighting
---
Good one?

Steam has VC so is it really 3rd party ;)
---
You don‚Äôt just die!?!? That is truly hell
---
Nope.
---
----------------------------------------------
---
What happens is that survivors typically time the blind so that the end of the pickup animation coincides with the last microseconds of the required time to blind. This gives them the best chance of being able to blind the killer while also preventing the killer from having time to look away.
---
However, spamming the drop button causes you to drop the survivor as soon as the animation ends and if the survivor didn't time it perfectly ( and I actually mean "perfectly," down to 1/10 of a second) the killer begins the drop animation before the blind goes off.
---
Here's a visual for what's happening (each dash represents 1/10 of a second, { and } represent the flashlight blind beginning and endpoints respectively, and x represents when the killer regains control:
---
*- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - { - - - - - - - - - - X}*
---
In a perfect blind, the } would line up with when the animation is complete and the killer has control. However, if the blind occurs like this:
---
*- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - { - - - - - - - - X - }*
---
Then the killer is able to drop and the game registers it before the blind goes off (ping also contributes here)
---
Some killers try looking up, but that only works if the blind is mistimed and leaves room for more than a 1-2 /10ths of a second (like this):
---
*- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - { - - - - - - X - - - }*
---
It is an exploit, yes
---
Is it out on vhs üìº?
---
So what if you get facecamped? So what if you get proxied and hard tunneled? It‚Äôs happens, get over it. 
---
See? It‚Äôs not fun to go against those things or a good swf and it isn‚Äôt quite fair to tell someone to suck it up and suffer so you can have fun. 
---
If people wanna lobby dodge then so be it, most people just dodge swf because of the toxicity anyways not the extra challenge/technical ‚Äúcheating‚Äù
---
What physics engine?
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday on ps4, I felt completely useless towards my team, couldn't heal or do gens. Restarting my game right after seemed to fix the problem
---
I think they were a kid after all however maybe you're right but the amount of times that killers do it and try justify it because they wasted most the game chasing the same survivor it's hard to ever know :s
---
Fanfics please 
---
Wait, all Survivors are the same speed?
---
`using sprint burst with any other exhaustion perk is kinda worthless`
---
next map is the Jerry Springer set 
---
oh jeez. it seems you've spelled killer wrong, because I can only assume those crutches are ruin noed and bbq

I actually do need to get better at chases against certain killers, but my biggest problem with other people passing the killer off to me is when they do it when I have absolutely no time to prepare for it, or they've wasted all the good pallets in their trek over to me. I've gotten better at looping killers at jungle gyms and t-walls, but at Rank 1, it's somewhat of a toss up of whether or not I'm going to be able to mind game the killer long enough to make it really matter, especially if it's a 3+ blink Nurse who knows what they're doing.
---
On my journey to Rank 1, I was usually the designated killer looper, making them waste all their time while all the gens got banged out, and causing the killer to lose. This not only became harder at around Rank 3, but it's infuriating when you've led the killer on a chase for five minutes across the entire goddam map, and only one gen gets popped, either because survivors can't hit a Hex skillcheck, or they were dicking around looking for items, hiding in lockers, or totem hunting ineffectively.
---
Looks like a great band/album name
---
Lol where did the reddit name come from? Ans i saw your signature on the drawings :D
---
The pain of being a licensed killer
---
I just started playing this game, and as a scared lil shit who mains meg, I feel like I've been personally attacked.
---
Its literally one of the top upvoted posts this month
---
The real tips
---
Freddy+anyone. Being invisible (even to aura detection perks) and the ease he has at putting people to sleep essentially turns him into a walking BBQ&amp;C for his partner lol.
---
You are still playing unethically. It's not the farmed guy's fault that he got farmed. Don't punish them regardless of how the game had been going for you 
---
Tldr
---
I managed 6 and on starting to think the event is cursed
---
Daddy Myers
---
I would actually love this.
---
Something very similar was posted awhile ago but it was less intense so... eh?
---
Thanks for explaining so the survivor has to be completely perfect for it to count as a flashlight save. 
---
But can I be banned for it? 
---
That's fair, although it's unknowable when it could appear in the shrine. If you aren't adverse to getting the dlc I would recommend it, at least when it next goes on sale (Especially if you ever want to play killer). Both Feng and Doctor are fun characters with a couple decent perks. Doctor is particularly good for farming blood points with the right perks.
---
Behavior: *Gives Feng event skin so everyone will play her.*
---
Also Behavior: *Puts Alert on Shrine.*
---
Ugh, I feel completely ripped off. I only ever get 891 BP for struggling, but you got 892!? Literally unplayable!
---
I got fengs and huntress never plan on playing ace if they had done feng+pig+Adam I would've been happy lol
---
I swear I‚Äôve replied saying the exact same thing earlier today...
---
When the exit gates are powered and open you get cases like these where the killers best option is to defend the sacrifice. If the killer had indeed left to go proxy it‚Äôs quite likely that the guy on hook would‚Äôve been saved and everyone would‚Äôve gotten out. Facecamping at least secures one kill while leaving to enter chase with another survivor means that the hooked survivor will be saved all for a gamble that you can catch a second survivor before he makes it out. 
---
Especially in a scenario like this or as you‚Äôre talking about, if none of the four survivors have died yet then proxying is worsening your chances of getting even one kill, not bettering your chances of two. Swf or not if you aren‚Äôt there when that save is made because you‚Äôre proxying then they‚Äôll body block and that kill is as good as gone.
---
In tier 1, yep. And it does it while moving, something Insidious cannot.
---
Is it how he looks or how he smells?
---
Must be the baby rhino right?
---
Some people on here have said it could have something to do with a vampire.
---
Another person suggested Jack the Ripper but; personally I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll ever add him considering he‚Äôs a legit serial killer. I feel like it would cause a lot of shit for the company 
---
But what about autoditact?
---
Yeah I guess you‚Äôll never know unless you remember his name and ask him!
---
Its a reference to the baby rhino vid i think, freddy tried twice to hit through the window then just vaulted.
---
If I fumble and miss a hit, assuming the survivor has vaulted a window or thrown down a pallet, sometimes I‚Äôll just turn my camera and give the wall or the pallet a good smack just to express my frustration. Sometimes, if I trap someone in a corner, I‚Äôll just stand there for a bit and see what they do. If they entertain me, I‚Äôll let them go. If they‚Äôre boring, I‚Äôll give them a good slap. Another of my favorites is, as the Hag, placing a ton of traps around something just for shits and giggles, and standing nearby with Insidious to give the survivors a spook. Sometimes they‚Äôll see me, we‚Äôll just stare at each other, and they‚Äôll trigger the explosion before running away. 
---
I do a lot of dumb shit as the killer, but those are some of my favorites. I often do dumb shit if the survivors seem more laid back and willing to goof around a bit. 
---
Trash DS player gets lucky a few times against a survivor main meme building on leatherface*

He should've brought Hangman's Trick.

---
Yet when survivors do the same thing only in game they get flamed for it. 
---
You can‚Äôt defend one while fighting against the other.
---
Solo surv is a thing and you have to adapt.

Ten outta ten.

Decent chance it is Toby though idk if he ever did anything with Jontron.

Legion was the Kenya chapter. That is, Kenya was the codename for their files. 
---
Why dose Meyer's perks seem to conflict with one another?  Dying Light is incredibly useful, but the others seem more like 'grief the obsession, do nothing to the obsession, leave the obsession. ". If you are lucky enough to find them early on, and just keep' playing' with them while all the other survivors get free gens. 
---
Except Dota2 is a lot more toxic.
---
Were they in the basement locker? üòÇ
---
It‚Äôs all survivors can do to dodge aids lol. Killers can dodge stuff they don‚Äôt wanna play against in lobby, survivors don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre up against something super annoying until they get in game 
---
It happened to me today... we were against huntress, after completing gen I go for the chest in the basement and she appears out of nowhere right when I pick up my brown medkit and.. insta downs me with a hatchet, yeah. I think she had perk that gives alarm when someone in the basement because she went in other direction but headed straight to basement when I got there
---
My only words i love it i can die happy now
---
I don‚Äôt think so. Personally I can‚Äôt do it but I think it‚Äôs just about knowing what you can launch off 
---
I would think so. They were doing Pizza Dwight which is a meme game.
---
Once in 2017. 
---
Do better the rest of the game so you don‚Äôt have to facecamp to secure a kill?
---
Oh yeah i completely get punishing survs for being idiots and insta saving while you‚Äôre still there, I‚Äôm talking about the people who will face/proxy when there almost nothing by(i.e) corner of the map where the gen is already done. I just don‚Äôt get how people find it enjoyable
---
Omg isn't that from RE5? I love beating them up lol but in a game like dead by daylight they would be creepy and terrifying. They remind me of all the amazon cannibal tribe horror movies they're usually really good at hiding and creeping up on victims slowly which is what scares me about them.
---
Both true statements.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/alez72/year_of_the_piggie_fanart_for_the_moonrise_event/
---
It's a grind. You just have to stick with it and you'll see progress. I'm 96 hours in and I still run into the occasional beast of a survivor/killer I just can't doing anything against yet. Game takes serious dedication.
---
No this is real you can kill yourself that‚Äôs why they put flashlights and noed and decisive 
---
Wat. Top right.
---
Pug as a survivor : teabags non-stop, makes fun of killers
---
Pug as a killer :
---
Oh I see, he‚Äôs stalking lol
---
How long have you been playing? I know when i started playing it was a good game if you get 10k as a survivor for the first bit of playing, it also doesn‚Äôt help when you come across killers who derank from red to grey just for easy kills. Just keep grinding and figuring it out- also what do you play on? Console or pc?
---
the valentine day one I think that shows the wraith and nurse as a couple 
---
The BPs don't make you a good player, you got to learn the basics first and then you'll get utility from the perks. Because believe me, if you struggle now without perks, you'll use your perks in the wrong way it's going to do you more harm than good.
---
What are servers? All I know is being connected to someone in China or Mexico so that I can get frozen dropping a pallet, and they can get a 4k with noed. 
---
The killer has a set time to do gens and the survivor blind and block the killer etc
---
it's the same reason we love the huntress
---
Yeah if a killer doesn‚Äôt want to deal with a 4 SWF that‚Äôs understandable considering it‚Äôs always a toxic game- but in Ps4 lobbies everyone loads in at the same time  even if it‚Äôs solo‚Äôs and it‚Äôs annoying considering the 20 min wait times :/
---
Pick meg? Bitch needs a shower.
---
Psssh you guys all play without sound. The real challenge is playing without sight. 
---
K
---
That‚Äôs on the devs for their solution where they forgot that killer queue times are so short (especially on console) that there‚Äôs no reason not people not to dodge if they even suspect swf.
---
I enjoy kittychipz, Jendenise, Cahlaflour and CrunchyEggrollzz 
---
they were a ***meme team***
---
Fuck I can‚Äôt forget Monto 
---
Oh I see, you don‚Äôt want to save your teammates but you want them to save you?
---
Also r/foundthemobileuser 
---
I spy a Pauly fan also that wouldn't happen with an actual game mode since it would be supported unlike when you do the double killer glitch
---
okay that locker thing was a bit bullshit :(
---
Hey survivors... Stop dc'ing every game.
---
Not with the pink hair and the mask she looks *EPIC*
---
you can literally just browse for a second and find it.
---
It's been brought up before, but I think that it is more likely a coincidence.
---
Why would they name it after the original actor who is not the likeness in the movie it is based on (we got the remake instead) as well as spelling it wrong.
---
Though it is always a possibility.
---
Actually it should be negative 2, so therefore all survivors have a .5 meter terror radius.
---
"Online Services" they call it. The servers that you connect to that have your save data and some other info
---
That's playing on ez mode. Fuck that. 
---
Killers enjoy the view too much lol 
---
Exactly. I don't know why people are trying this hard. 
---
They probably dont want to save you because you went down before a gen was started.
---
I mean I know this is a shitpost and all, but truth be told this wouldn't be bad for a mayhem mode. Basically, The entity cokes up both teams and you all have extra speed ( including Billy) , less cooldown time and can bring 8 perks from your inventory all boosted to level 3 with all items, add ons and offerings at your disposal before the game so you don't have to waste your items on this garbage.
---
#DEVS GET ON IT, I WOULD PAY GOOD CELLS TO SEE THIS CLUSTERFUCK 
---
Because it wasn‚Äôt obvious enough... 
---
True. Lol
---
Can't wait to kill all the foreigners with this epic skin
---
¬´¬†Kill yourself¬†¬ª when your alone in dbd
---
Done and dusted
---
This is beyond science
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know that there‚Äôs anyway to effectively get more people playing killer. A large amount of the community seems to be here for SWF making killer a lot less enticing for a majority of the player base. Perhaps a BP increase could help in finding middle ground for activity on both sides but at the same time it could incentivize more toxic gameplay from killers with the bonus of a fuck ton of BP. It would be hard to implement but I wouldn‚Äôt be against something like this.
---
This. I changed my main survivor from Meg to Nea just because I got tired of Meg getting all the shit cosmetics and think Nea's is better.
---
Meg is ugly as fuck and has shit cosmetics. Neon hair nea/feng is the way to go unless you wanna be pizza Dwight or one of the thicc bois
---
Not since the latest patch made me fucking deaf
---
Demi, is that you?
---
Either you blinked or the survivors suicides because nurse literally can‚Äôt catch up to them
---
Well, because naming the folder Englund would have given it away. Its a cheeky little joke if anything at all.
---
it‚Äôs good, I got it and it‚Äôs not a popular meme for me!
---
I did and cant find it anywhere
---
Roses are red
---
Violets are blue
---
I touch my bing bong
---
When I think of you
---
No, we love the Huntress because she has thicc thighs.
---
Great ideas, but with the hatch aura, out a time limit on it something like 60/40/15 seconds to balance it out. And not put the killer at a complete disadvantage
---
I fucking hate the corn on coldwind, especially if I am playing against a Claud. Those shits are invisible
---
When survivors disconnect in game, not only do they screw over the remainign players by making it harder for them, they also waste the time everyone spent queing and starting the game.
---
If i as a killer dodge the lobby then the only time wasted is the time spent clicking the find lobby button.
---
To imply that it's the same is asinine and just shows you have the typical toxic survivor mindset.
---
Well if she had used Prime, this issue would have been avoided
---
^
---
Yeah, it is. 
---
First Party would be if the voice comms were built into the game itself. 
---
No. The auto sacrifice speeds up endgame, its why the hatch exsists too. At that point youve lost and the killer is right there. It sacrifices you to stop wasting time
---
As all things should be.
---
Lol you're probably right. 
---
It literally says it twice in the bottom left
---
Don't be dissing Radical Larry 
---
I just played against a trapper on coldwind that thought i couldn't see him through the walls üòÇ
---
Makes sense for me; if people see a random survivor lighting up, they'll usually just head towards em.
---
And when you have found those other people, you have to wait 7 seconds to attack them. His power is just a combination of Wraith and Doctor (who are already bad killers) except worse. At least Wraith's and Doctor's abilities help them in chases. That's why Freddy is a bad killer.
---
especially with bbq and chili. getting 50k every game isnt even that special.
---
Lagswitch. Not particularly the dev's fault, and they've taken some pretty good steps to try to prevent it.
---
That is fine. I meant tunneling them right after they got unhooked when they can go for the rescuer. 
---
I bought the  pebble w weeks ago and I still haven't found it in my bloodweb
---
How do you farm BP with dr.?
---
I really like this. Good job!
---
a good billy can cause havoc
---
*Twilight Zone Theme plays in the background*
---
Isnt it better to throw a hatchet cuz you can normal swing right after? Fudge on twitch will always throw a hatchet over  just a swinging and I think that's why....I could be wrong tho
---
I fuck with this. lol
---
i agree. started doing some adept achievements on new killers i bought while they were on sale. leveled them to 15 for the 3 slots. at lvl 15 i had pretty much no addons and suboptimal perks (because few killers have 3 good teachable perks). it was hard, but i did it.
---
good addons and perks make it easier, but its definitely about experience/getting good ^^^and ^^^luck
---
ANOTHER LEGION BAD POST
---
That imagery sounds hilarious and I now have to look up videos of this travesty.
---
I literally just watched this, it was perfect. 
---
Dayum I see you in almost any legion bashing/shit talking post, I think you need a break from dbd or something mate
---
This was one of the funnest SWF groups i played against too, they were pretty nice folks
---
It's just a communist box. 
---
I loved this squddetted, they werent toxic and thus deserve credit for being good folks
---
In a few hours i think?
---
Why do they call 'em crutch perks. I thought it was clutch perks because they help you out right when you' re gonna die. (Adrenaline, Borrowed time, Dead hard, DS) 
---
It gives me 14 üòù
---
The fact that killers can't even attempt to mindgame survivors because they can see them through the slits in the walls is stupid and needs to be changed.
---
Keep him as is just remove the moonwalking exploit by either slowing or stopping the bar in his terror radius.
---
I see you Know your Judo well 
---
What an epic gamer you are 
---
That would be cool, and make sense. Not the oldest killer in the game, but damn the literal 'oldest killer by far' if they're going by the Cain = First Murderer approach. I like it.
---
I can sum up 90% of post with the same name, Get hit from far away, lag back from window pallet ect, or a dumb bug everyone has seen before. I honestly don‚Äôt even think the ‚Äúpretty good job so far‚Äù meme is even funny anymore Bc the person who started it is a shitty pedo

Oh yea 100%, it‚Äôs basically like playing duos with 5 gems and a decent to good killer. You better believe after that first DC the 2nd rando will go down within 20 secs and kill themselfs on hook

After youve played the game enough you learn to expect nothing from killers or other survivors.

Doesn‚Äôt remove franks mixtape, or the fact that it requires literally no skill to down someone and he cannot be outplayed. Moonwalking is not the only issue with legion and I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs not even if the highest priority to be changed.

I‚Äôm not corn blind as killer 
---
The frame rate normally dips when a survivors 360's on console. In the corner the fps is like 10.
---
now this ones spicy :ok\_hand\_emoji:
---
That shouldn't change though. If you make Legion require skill he will be garbage he's already not a good killer.
---
&gt;Meg is ugly as fuck
---
Niqqa what 
---
&gt;I‚Äôm the pig 
---
&gt;but I‚Äôm the pig!! :,(
---
I‚Äôm dead, that was adorable 
---
That's not tunneling tho
---
If I'm close enough to be able to choose who I go after, that means they did a greedy unhook. And I feel bad for the guy, but it's more efficient to go after the injured guy than the healthy one.
---
So fuck off with your made up rules killers must obey. I'm here to kill, not help you escape
---
Because killer doesn't exist?
---
That's why queues are long. No one is playing killer. So play killer.
---
If Claudette was a Loli we would have been banned long ago
---
Well If he's constantly telling me where he is, why would I not go after him lmao
---
That's what the perk is used for anyway. To tell the killer where you are
---
Here, buy some new cosmetics. 
---
Sincerely, BHVR
---
You misread. That says some*thing*, not times. lol
---
This game isn't really a bastion of high-end gaming talent in the first place.

There's a game in this bug.
---
-no0b3 2018
---
See fights between megs and neas but the real winner is Kate 
---
To be fair, it's very possible that they tried to work out an agreement with the license holders and were unable to do so. They did say a while back that they would try to get some licensed cosmetics out
---
...but then again, they also said we'd get console optimization in December so who knows
---
Yeah the idiots DC, then the killers step up the tryhard in a 2v1 with 5 gens.
---
Freddy doesn't need a buff. Fire up is a good perk. T H E R E  I S   N O  W A R  I N  B A  S I N G  S E
---
Hmm well if you were just hiding at the end oh well
---
Yea and you are a dick head, why would anyone listen to you?
---
I have friends who love it.  I love empathy: I just feel it's a bit stronger and has no hard counters.
---
He is talking about M&amp;A + Myers. Then tier 1 has no TR and tier 2 has 8m.
---
Nah I'm going to pass, I'm not gay
---
You do understand that furries are worse than everything and what I am don‚Äôt matter 
---
You can catch people while moving slower by taking more optimal routes then the survivor/cut them off.  Also with bloodlust you would eventually become faster, so it is technically possible to catch people using no blink nurse.
---
That being said, of course it would take ages and be very impractical for actually getting any kills.
---
Nice Guy Mikey
---
I did hide towards the end,  when she was hiding. Her and her friend hadn't even attempted to save us other two when we were hooked. Another reason,  I didn't rush to her. Sick of dying to save team mates who won't do the same for me,  hence me dying while she t bagged the hatch.

Yeah I was mad when I posted this, because we already deal with killers be,  surviors shouldn't do it. But, ya know. Ya live &amp; ya learn,  getting closer and closer to only playing this game with a whole swf team. 
---
Oof, sorry about that, i'm dumb
---
All my IRL friends know I go by 'scathykitty'... so I didn't want them to find my reddit.. initially only use reddit just for reading. But I didn't expect I'll be posting alot of art here (since DBD). Now I kinda regret for putting a different name üòÜ
---
Buy monitor and abuse from the shrine, it's the best perk on Myers. Also, replace play with your food with sloppy butcher and you're good to go. 
---
You hear me 
---
In before people start telling us to git gud against abilities that literally ignore game mechanics and that fun shouldn't be a factor since survivors apparently are not supposed to have fun according to many people here.
---
Hah imagine using hex ruin because you can‚Äôt end the game before the last gen
---
Yes, because the killer should be able to dodge swf but ig I should just be forced to play out the third iri head huntress game in a day
---
Imagine thinking ruin and bbq are crutches
---
That's a really stupid statement. Entitlement is on both sides, sorry to let you know. 
---
Nah, I‚Äôm having a blast i just dc vs legion if I get them more than once a day until it‚Äôs fixed 
---
Legion isn‚Äôt simply not fun, he completely removes any fragment of fun from the game and is pretty well guaranteed two kills with no skill needed to obtain. 
---
Then you add franks mixtape on top of this and chases last 20 seconds with no counterplay whatsoever on a killer who‚Äôs power makes the game even worse of a m1 simulator. 
---
Legion should be temporarily removed from the game until they come up with some sort of a fix as honestly, the killer is game breaking in many ways. 
---
I...i stand corrected
---
Tier 1 Myers would have essentially no terror radius, tier would have an extremely small one. 
---
*running around pallet for the tenth time*
---
Whaddya mean that this doesn‚Äôt require skill?
---
And what of the people who paid to get him or used shards? Just a waste for however long it takes them to rework him while they still go make new killers?
---
They won't do that. 
---
Seeing the killer is arguably more useful than seeing an injured teammate
---
Pig traps go on your head, so no,  trapper traps, yes
---
r/whoooooosh
---
i burned out the mouse wheel connection by rebinding struggle to it. im definitely going back haha

---
Nice
---
Hey I do dead by daylight videos on my channel.
---
My channel name is Thetype2show check me out let me know how it was.
---
Wake Up has been in the shrine at least every 3 weeks. What the fuck is this Quentin, go back to bed and let us get good perks.
---
Lines are hard for me haha, maybe for something like this you could like do the pose urself so you get a idea of how the body parts look, idk if that made sense, like take a picture of urself with your hand in that position 
---
Fucking Wilson. Always butting in. 
---
Lol
---
I‚Äôd go leatherface for BBQ. You can get all the other perks from the shrine at some point. BBQ has only been on shrine once... and will probably never be there again. 
---
It‚Äôs pretty much the best killer perk. 
---
You can't sell a dlc and remove it a few months later. It's common sense. You have no idea what you're talking about some of us like Legion and would be pissed if they removed him for months.
---
Technically speaking, I think he has a sliver of one at T1 with M&amp;A but it is incredibly small. Bringing Dead Rabbit eliminates it entirely, and leaves the T2 radius super small as well. 
---
Harsh lessons is probably one of the most needed perks right now.
---
As a Killer main, I welcome perks for Survivors to deal with Tunneling.
---
Getting in a locker isn't a juke
---
North Hem. 20-21 March, South Hem 21-23 Sept.
---
It is not an EU thing, nowhere it is spring in February
---
Grants the points the killer already has earn but you don't let him get the rest he got thanks to Adam.
---
Then what I am don‚Äôt matter 
---
Come play 1000 games on PS4, then tell me most killers don‚Äôt run noed.
---
IMO a crutch is something an unskilled player needs to win, not something every player needs to make the game playable
---
Maybe you just need to think of a different tactic when playing on Coldwind? It would be boring if you could play the same way on every map so the corn and walls add a change. I'm 50/50 survivor/killer and I dont mind it.
---
It gets frustrating but you dont need to win to have a fun  game.
---
I play alot of Legion Main these days, already have all the perks, Legion needs adjusting imo, but lets see what you got.
---
&gt; a lot of time will be spent running around M1ing at default speed. 
---
No Thanks Sir, it is awful to spend most of my time running around M1 at default speed. 
---
ALSO, Nah, I rather want control over when I want to run, "oh sorry you gotta hit a gen more to run fast"
---
&gt;I feel, since Frenzy isn't something you'd be using every 30 seconds anymore.
---
Thats where you are wrong, kiddo. It's way more fun to zoom around. Change my mind.
---
These suggestions would just neuter the Legion, making him even more unfun to play as as he already is.
---
#Dead by Daylight player count jumps to Infinity
---
FTFY
---
Spurs from the shadows or sloppy butcher for noed and pwyf and you're pretty decent 
---
"There there, I'm sorry for brutally stabbing you, it's gonna be okay."
---
This would be the most practical thing to do as a killer if survivors could use deliverance when they're the last ones left, and yet it gets downvoted... 
---
I knew the first subreddit already, but that second thing scares me.
---
Ew1 has 8 meter meaning M&amp;A gives 0m TR while dead rabbit removes 4m from EW2 only it doesn't effect ew1
---
:(
---
I think its hilarious plus teaches survivors not to be so altruistic all the time.
---
No amount of perk pimping can make me play that ghoul Quentin. 
---
Oh. Maybe you talk about the climate more than the official dates?
---
I mean, it is supposed officially the seasons start the same dates here (Spain) and there (Ireland). But I must say is quite "hot" here these days that the weather seems to be also "springly" XD
---
Why would you enjoy removing mind games from jungle gyms? It just turns it into a run around until bloodlust loop 
---
It reads as very unfun to play on both sides.
---
Could use some better explaining...
---
1) how does it teleport? Does it just pick spots based on where the player is looking?
---
2) is it standing on the ground? Flying a little up? How would it see people on maps such as the cornfield maps, without having huge advantages from being high up and seeing from afar?
---
Overall interesting concept to have a killer that‚Äôs mobility is restricted like this but I think the community wouldn‚Äôt like it much because it changes the game too much.
---
 Take legion for an example: he broke the typical rhythm of the game (looping vs mindgaming) and there‚Äôs still uproar from the community even today. Similarly, it would be the only killer that doesn‚Äôt have any form of melee that they are consistently using (even huntress uses melee a decent amount). 
---
Onto the topic of how it changes perk meta. The style of the killer makes a lot of perks obsolete if chosen against this killer... to list some: basically any perk involving a chase, DS (assuming killer can just teleport to the hook?), lithe, iron will, etc). Along the lines of perks some killer perks(especially those that are already good) would be incredibly overpowered due to the range of the weapon and ability to go through walls, such as nurses calling, BBQ, discordance, surveillance, make your choice, etc.
---
People would probably also be pretty upset because the killer basically can full map hook camp, totem camp, etc.
---
Again, interesting concept but brings up some big concerns 
---
It can shoot through walls, so just aim at the gen on the other side of the map, click and expect something to happen. He is able to move only while carrying a body. He cannot apply gen pressure, that is his weakness intentionally. But he can down people fast.  Also, use many detection perks. Example ‚Äî BBQ and chili, Iron Maiden etc. Then you can shoot at people with almost 80% chance you get them. 
---
His one add on makes him able to 100% the gen (even the working one) in 50 seconds (if it is the last gen, it will close the gates again). However, he won‚Äôt be able to shoot through the gens to hit survivors
---
Balanced, Urban, Lithe &amp; Self Care :O &lt;3 
---
Really good cosmetics all her cosmetics are good even the ones where it just changes the basic clothes 
---
The squeak when she's hit by a pallet.
---
If you swing a weapon through an open window its not going to hit an invisible wall...
---
In that case it sounds rather boring. The meta would be as follows: Pick a spot, take a shot at each gen, switch locations, take a shot at each gen from a different angle, repeat. No counterplay, no actual interactivity with the survivors. Just shoot blindly until you down someone, if youre lucky a survivor crosses your line of sight and you get some free damage if you can aim properly.
---
I mean that you play differently. Instead of getting baited into a loop, you have to change the way you play and try to catch survivors off guard and not allow them to get to the loops. It is definitely possible but not easy and sometimes you'll find that you only get 1 or 2 kills. 
---
But if you want a 4k every time you play then sure, delete every mapa apart from your favourite one ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
A good billy can rev and loop circles on coldwind. Like a vhainsaw derby. 
---
this is a very good idea and would love if they would put this into the game. your backstory and perks were very detailed and creative, good work
---
See also; this is why there are mo long ranged killers. The game has no balance for them.
---
Nah just get the first hit, move to another survivor, then come back to the area. stick Nurses and Monitor and abuse on and catch them healing.
---
One of many possible tactics.
---
Again, some maps are gonna be better for some builds/killers than others. That doesn't mean they should be deleted. 
---
Killer/survivor mains often overreacted and throw around terms like "DELETE THIS" "OP" "NERF THIS" but maybe you just got outplayed. 
---
The game isn't perfect but if you're only ever gonna want matches in which you get 4k, dont get looped and down everybody on the first chase, you're just setting yourself up to get annoyed.
---
Chill a bit, play some offerings to avoid Coldwind for a bit then next time you get it, maybe you can just try and have fun.
---
I miss the Freddy meme : (
---
They had the original idea to just let it be shut once. The survivor would then need to do a generator to open it or have the key.
---
The nurse is a thing too... 
---
Also do it if you're last alive and get hooked (unless it's hook 3). Just tap space casually and you get like 40 struggle points, even though the hook automatically sacrifices you.
---
r/woooosh
---
Then the killer turns away, and hooks your ass anyway, then proceeds to stay around the hook until you're dead.
---
Naturally, the SWF whines big time in post game chat that the killer was camping, without realising he just didn't leave the hook because he could see all three of the dumbasses loitering around it.
---
Yeah totally, "camping".
---
Bold of you to assume Sally didn‚Äôt end up with Rin 
---
I don't use NOED, you Decisive using salty survivor main :)
---
People still cry whenever they lose.

How I felt exactly!  This game caught my attention before any of the big names,  back when it was just trapper,  hillbilly and wraith.  When it came to console, I bought it immediately and I was hooked
---
I don‚Äôt know, people are downvoting all of the answers on this post..
---
Thanks. I hate it
---
I tried Wake Up yesterday when I did the Adept Quentin perk.
---
You start opening a gate and the survivors seeing your aura bolt towards it with the killer in tow.
---
I don't recommend this perk.
---
For German, look up on Facebook and search for DBD groups
---
How do you main bill? Do you like exclusively use his perks
---
There still would be no counterplay in chases...
---
So was playing a three man SWF while waiting for my friends to go out and I can go back to killer. We have one random, we are 30 seconds into the game he goes down to bubba. Fair enough, I go to grab him but turns out bubba is camping him in the basement with insidious, Random kills himself on hook but not before I get far enough down for the fat cannibal to fill his pants with piss in excitement, chase me up the stairs and out the door like the Texas chainsaw massacre before downing me. 
---
I DC out of it because I already know what the plan is gonna be. Does that make me a toxic DCer or am I in the right on that one?
---
Lore checks out, this is now canon. 
---
I spent the entire duration of my Tier 3 Myers chasing a Claudette through a cornfield, and still didn‚Äôt get her. Every time I‚Äôd get remotely close she‚Äôs shatter my ankles into splinters and my frame rate would drop from 15 to 5. I hate the corn so much. Still killed 3 out of 4, but I never managed to down that Claudette.
---
It was said by a dev a while ago in a stream, so not just a rumor
---
The amount of BPS and puddings i've lost to infinite loading screens, the game simply crashing or only 2 loading in the past 2 months are insane.
---
It sucks
---
As sad as that is, thats exactly right
---
This pretty much ignores all of the game's mechanics. No thanks
---
‚ÄúEat this my child, you are safe now‚Äù
---
‚ÄúThank you i owe you my life‚Äù
---
Yesterday I sprinted straight out into blood lodge to grab a lantern and only JUST noticed the leatherface charging at it and stopped, just to have my friend sprint straight past at it and go down instantly.
---
All I seem to play against at low ranks are Myers, Spirits and Leatherfaces 
---
I main Claudette but okay her more like a David since I do SWF and am the most experienced so I have to be tunnelled then heal everyone when I have a second 
---
Tapp has the best perks out of the 3 of them, but they're not great perks
---
I never realized just the wheezing could sound so creepy.
---
I've never really caught an Insidious killer by their breathing, that's neat.
---
We're actually some there do just fine without ruin, imo the game is perfectly playable without it.
---
Of course you go up against a team sometimes there will win, but it's actually okey to lose once in a while and accept that there's better players. 
---
But the fact that the game is perfectly playable without ruin kinda.... ruins your argument. 
---
Happens every god damn time as a solo player. 
---
I have probably been misinformed, I did think when you said they had tier 3 perks the killer has either been really lucky in bloodweb or somehow de-ranked all the way. 
---
I think a time out for repetitive disconnects could work. However people re-joining could cause issues, say the killer is snowballing a team then suddenly someone re-apppears in game and finishes the last gen or makes a clutch save out of no where, you would get a lot of killer mains being mad. 
---
Yea de-ranking to 20 just seems mad to me, it takes ages and is a game really fun if all your doing is trouncing people? Furthest I go back is on the cusp of 11 so one game takes me to 10, and even then I have fun de-ranking letting survivors play the whole game as I protect the chest in the basement as bubba and dump any unruly souls back at the top of the basement stairs rather than hook them. 
---
The biggest issue is your right it probably wouldn't take much for them to try and sort the problem but they don't care. I have lost all faith in the devs as I play on console and have, like many others, been desperate for bans to be implemented. For months/probably years they have said it's too difficult and involves discussions with Sony or Microsoft then when a game breaking bug comes out that meant you could abuse the bloodweb farming an item over and over or even prestiging characters without any of the work... poof.... bans are a thing. Basically the game is designed around the grind and it's a way to keep people playing and hopefully buying dlc etc so the devs get money, you take away the grind then more people will get bored and leave quicker so magically 2 days after the glitch is found they figure out how to do bans. It is a joke and either they need to be more transparent when they do their weekly streams or they are just lazy people who don't really care about the game experience and are more bothered about producing new flashy content to make them money. Worst of all with every dlc or event update loads of new bugs are introduced to the game, I have never played a game that has had so many game breaking issues that aren't sorted within days. 
---
So to sum up it would be great for them to do anything but just like toxic play and the hatch standoff to name a few other issues nothing will be done because frankly it appears as if behavior doesn't care.
---
Its not a bug :/
---
Most survivors are in at least a duo group, and OoO is a very rare perk in general, even rarer among solos
---
I consider it a likely scenario, and if I‚Äôm playing wraith I want the guy who deletes my whole power ASAP.
---
*Scratched Mirror Myers intensifies*
---
What rank do you play at? I‚Äôm not saying this to boast, but I play around 2-3 and occasionally even 1, and the games fly by almost always without fail. Whenever I don‚Äôt have Ruin, I lose. There‚Äôs a rare case where I don‚Äôt, but that‚Äôs the exception, not the norm.
---
As a fellow new player that made it to rank 10 with only 2-3 killers beyond level 2, I think the answer really is to just accept that you're going to get crapped on. At this point I just set personal goals, like practicing Nurse teleport and hitting x amount of people or hitting x amount of hatchets, and go from there. Fresh killers like you and me aren't exactly good enough to go against red ranks constantly, so why worry about rank?
---
Bitch you don't tell me what to do, you are just hook meat.
---
&gt; If they let you see the killer I wouldn‚Äôt dc in games I‚Äôd just dodge.
---
If you knew the killer then survivors would have an ungodly ammount of control in the game.
---
See a trapper? everyone takes toolboxes
---
Wraith? everyone brings flashlights.
---
Survivor dcing is in no way comparable to killer dodging, you're incredibally neive if you think it is
---
I feel you there, my friends all moved onto Overwatch, hahaha, and it's boring playing solo. I just wanted to check and make sure you were speaking from a place of experience, because it feels like our experiences don't line up.
---
Like, for example, I played this match yesterday that I quit and realized afterward that I just like... Don't even feel like playing Dbd anymore. I ran into an SWF, and I downed someone immediately, but of course, they had DS and ran off.  I grabbed their friend, and their friend had tier 3 boil over and that wouldn't be an issue, except when I got to the closest hook, it was sabo-ed in front of me, and the path to the next closest hook was filled with 3 other survivors teabagging in my way.
---
I just realized like, 'Cool, I hate this game &amp; SWF can literally fuck off.' They weren't even GOOD players, given that I downed two of them before any generators started as a tier 1 Myers, but DS &amp; communication/coordination is such a pain in the ass.
---
Thanks, now I can P3 every killer
---
De fuk? He's free stoopid. jk I play on ps4
---
But then you rank up and everyone gets really sweaty and half of the perks in the game are a liability.
---
Congratulations, you played yourself.
---
At this point, the meta is just seeing how many crutches you can stack.
---
I definitely agree with Nurse. I have to disagree with Hillbilly. I still feel like Nurse is a bad addition to the game
---
Same,  well rank 10 now I guess.  But I only play billy when I get a daily and I‚Äôve already gotten rid of one. 
---
I play leatherface, Trapper, hag, pig, and Myers. 
---
I‚Äôll do some other dailies on occasion but not a big fan of billy. 
---
Having a bad day, maybe. But when this is the playstyle, then everyday is a bad day.
---
I have so many questions about what I just saw.
---
yuck
---
A clown with good aim and especially any decent add-ons.. I could see it..
---
I miss when it affected snap out of it,  and when nurses calling worked with snap out of it.  Ever since legion and deep wounds came out they redefined what a healing action was because they don‚Äôt want mending to be healing. 
---
Cmon man we all know it‚Äôs healing lol.
---
Imagine if the Legion could drop pallets and blind survs with the flashlight. Ooh, and I thought it couldn't get any worse. 
---
Because it's totally a "Killer Main" issue.
---
then he moved onto naruto's son.
---
Holy shit, I didnt think it was Jon at first but the closer I looked the more Jon it looked.
---
Don't main anyone at all. Switch between a few that you like. Thats what keeps the game fresh for me.
---
The five I switch between are Billy, Wraith, Myers, Huntress and spirit.
---
What does Joey look like anyways, is he as handsome as his Joey counterpart (a.k.a Joey Tribbani
---
Oh fuck dont get me started on how salty these fucking survivors can be. One time i cleansed ruin did 3 gens BY MYSELF and managed to loop the killer a bit when no one else did shit and died on their first hook. Killer slugged the last guy so i jumped in a locker to hide for a bit before i try to sneak away and the slug literally followed me no matter where i went and gave away my position. The mother fucker had 6k points in the end game lobby and was mad the killer didnt let him live for ratting me out. Jokes on you cunt bitch i double pip'd.
---
Obvious tips, don't go through tall grass. If you are not a chase and are moving to a new generator, look around common trapping spots. For example if you are passing by the killer shack go and check if the window/pallet/corners are trapped. It will help your teammates, and you. You will gain intel where he likes to place his traps, and then you know if a place is safe to loop or not, which should help with your trap paranoia. Disarming traps wastes his time (unless he has the "traps open every 30 seconds" add-on)
---
If you see the trapper at the start of the game, run into the opposite direction from which he came from. He most likely trapped that side. Something I like to do as Trapper is to go around and force survivors to go towards the direction I trapped, so keep that in mind. But I rarely ever see Trappers do it when I play survivor. 
---
Everything else is looping. While trapper is by no means the strongest killer, he should never be underestimated, can't tell you how often I went from 1 hook after 4 gens are done to a 4k thanks to my traps.
---
Accept that sometimes you will run into three traps in quick succession and die. 
---
Mad? Not at all, rather dissapointed about that pathetic attempt to hide your inexperience with incoherent replies.
---
But as I already predicted that anyway...(Wow even a second account for the classic up-/downvote).
---
So...What's your point again? Besides of "your grammar sucks, you don't understand my opinion reeeee" ?
---
How can a person actually give a that long but also useless reply lol. Is that the way you usually attempt to discuss? If that's the case I've already recognized the issue here anyway.
---
But you Sir, are an rare species here in this sub. In regards to relevant topics, we usually have the folks who like to have good discussions and the biased moron's who're not here to have discussions of any sort but rather to enforce their mostly very questionable opinion upon others (or simply shit on those who don't share said opinion). You're obviously not the first mention but the curtain you attempt to hide your lack of selfesteem and crippling depressions behind combined with cocky, incoherent replies...You're an elite troll sir, and I respect that.
---
But it's quite long ago that I had the honor to talk with one of the higher rank trolls who're actually also in having multiple accounts to vote 'emselfes up and others down. I haven't missed that to be fair, but it's really refreshing to not just have good discussions or talk to people who suck bricks in their free time (instead of their own dick).
---
Regardless my lovely fat e-girl, thanks a lot for this beautiful discussion, I've gained a lot of insight from this :^)

Every maps has 5 totems. Whether or not those totems will be hexes depends on the killer's perks.
---
He's black, and he's got some badass smokey eyes to make it look like skull eye sockets when he's wearing his bandana mask 
---
Rank reset is something every game has
---
Implying keys aren't already useful -- OP even? 
---
Depends. If you're after perks: Hag (Ruin), leatherface (BBQ), spirit (spirit fury, haunted grounds), clown (bamboozle)
---
If you want a fun killer: Myers, doctor, pig.
---
If you want a good killer: Spirit, Myers, hag.
---
If your wifi sucks as killer, you don‚Äôt feel it, but the survivors sure do. So it‚Äôs a killers benefit to have shit internet. 
---
Only playing a certain character 
---
No you do feel it 
---
Unless the totem gets cleansed in the first 15 seconds of the match like it always does. 
---
Would have*
---
Not true. Ive had people who leave as soon as im about get hooked so i instantly go into second phase. I mean giving us the chance at least should be an option.
---
I personally have good internet but every once in a while, all the survivors in my lobby start teleporting, so I figure it‚Äôs host ( me ) connection that is lagging 
---
Rank reset is so fucking annoying for me. I get rank 1 killer no problem but because I rarely play survivor I end up with the dumbest teammates in the omniverse and can never get out of rank 10 unless I grind. Rank reset should only set you back five ranks, not ten.
---
Pure rank 1, i occasionally go rank 2 from losing one big time. But otherwise rank 1 Killer and Survivor.
---
When they pop the gen right in my face I take it as an insult for some reason.
---
Happy cakeday
---
I have good connection usually but some survs warp so fucking much I legit can't even hit them before it calms down and they start running normally again.
---
This. It might as well have been Frank just getting a dark impulse for the fact one of his 'friends' got hurt. That his little group got targeted. There isn't really anything that supports a canon relationship, Julie was using him as a free ticket out of snoresville.   
---
I stan JuliexSusie
---
Would be cool to have a bot mode to test killers 
---
Imo, it's so easy going rank 1 nowadays that you don't really face that good survivors or killer very often anymore. Alot of players are just relying on their perks to carry them, that when they go up against good players they don't know what to do against them. 
---
I'm definetly not a good player, don't get me wrong. I just truely believe that you learn how to play the game, by not relying on perks. 
---
I don't run Noed, Ruin, Decisive, Self care and such for that reason.
---
And sure it takes a while on that learning curve, but after i stopped i can see a huge increase in skill rather than relying on something to carry me.
---
Watch Monto, but Just a lil bit
---
Hag and Spirit are by far the strongest DLC killers, no argument to be had.
---
My personal favorite is the Doctor though, I would recommend any of those 3.
---
Id like to think so. Not really hardcore playing myself and would have about 10k in a little over a month minus 2 purchases from the Shrine. Just depends on how often you play if you get enough shards.
---
Yes please
---
These are so good. I loved the bit at the start, where Claudette confused him with a survivor.
---
Whose mic is trapped in the spirit realm? Are you playing with Rin?
---
Happy cake day!

The difference is really whether you leave "legally" or not. If they leave via the menu that's just as much of an option that they have access to. If you manipulate your connection as killer or survivor then yea that's a big jerk move.
---
(There's also the semantics about if a ranged killer really &gt;(should have access to) one hit downs.
---
The holiday as in Valentine's. The one we are talking about.
---
Did somebody say MONITER AND ABUSE?
---
Literally this : https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a5xe93/best_thing_ive_ever_seen_in_this_game_this_wraith/?st=js34iet7&amp;sh=6863cc08
---
ok
---
No idea why you got downvoted. It‚Äôs disgustingly bad
---
You guys are honestly delusional and should start getting over this shit. Legion is objectively mid tier, the only thing that is actually OP is Frank's and Deep wound study (cold dirt can be pretty strong too but only if paired with one of the forementioned perks). As a solo surv main i statistically win 70% of games against him, and the reason of that is because his power, despite "breaking the basic game mechanics" (nurse does too but since she's an old pillar of the game no one complains about her anymore and people just learn to deal with her), prolongates chases by a good amount of time, and even if he just chases you until your bar depletes and u get downed, that gives other survivors plenty of time to work on those gens (unlike a Billy who chainsaws you in 5 secs). What you fuckers should complain about instead are a couple of his add-ons but people are appearently too stupid to realize what is actually wrong with a killer and just spit out the same generic complaints like fucking sheeps (but then again you have add-ons that LITERALLY break the game like iri hatchets or tombstone and no one gives a shit). Perhaps is the fact that he's an easy killer to play that gets you mad? That's actually pathetic, sometimes people forget who is supposed to be "the power role" in a assymetrical horror/slasher game.
---
Git gud.
---
Why are people against you?
---
Tbh, I started playing Nea because No0b3 mains her. And honestly, I don‚Äôt think she looks ugly whatsoever. I like the way she runs both healthy and injured. She has nice cosmetics and she fits my playstyle. 
---
Just reminiscing about that one time it didn't spawn directly in front of a survivor
---
If you played everyday then I would say yes.
---
Ladies and gentelmen, this is why cleansing 5 totems isnt viable
---
Please don‚Äôt tell me you sweated on a memeing SWF
---
I found myself in the same route as you, I'd spawn in and go to a gen within 5 seconds.   
---
That was my first mistake.  
---
As killer the only hint of where survivors will be in the first minute are doing gens.  
---
So crouch around the map ([Urban evasion](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Urban_Evasion), if you have it). Familiarise yourself with the map and where some pallets are.  
---
**THEN** start doing a gen, by this point someone else should've made the mistake of starting a gen straight away.  
---
Giving you time to either finish a gen or go for the hook rescue to get yourself more BP's by unhooking.  
---
Hope this helps.  
---
**J**
---
The cat seems to be confused by your empty perk slot and is clearly telling you to pick Quick &amp; Quiet. OR the cat is telling you to play killer instead and murder all Kates.
---
I feel this as an Australian
---
I looped pug for 3 gens and he goes this survivor is trash and shit and isnt good...idk how anyone enjoys watching him 
---
At the end of the post you asked if this is the first time we are getting cosmetics based on holiday.  My response is about that, which is what we are talking about as well. So yeah just about any holiday they have ever made a cosmetic for is free game in the discussion now.   
---
It‚Äôs really scary actually. Insidious Billy, cloaked wraith standing still, Myers breathing etc. 
---
If you‚Äôre asking if I made it the answer is yes, but if you‚Äôre asking if I want to wear your face the answer is still yes :)
---
Elaborate.
---
Buff Billy
---
Assassin‚Äôs Creed had you slashin twats up as Jack the Ripper. It could be a Ripper inspired killer though...
---
Thirded
---
She wears baggy ass trousers though...
---
Unless Killer is Spirit, Huntress, Clown, or Frank.
---
That's actually a lot that have Mommy problems now that I think about it
---
All females run the exact same way
---
Please don't
---
I plan on playing lots of Nurse when her Valentine skin drops today :(
---
They do not. Of course they all feel the same, but their animations are definetely different. 
---
Yeah, my doctor used to be unstoppable with it Haha. Maybe OPü§îüòè but he was fun
---
how did he get up there
---
I'm rank 1-5 on PS4 and I can tell you that I mainly play Myers and hunterss or any killer I have a daily mission for but the only thing I've ever camped is my ruin totem.  I only did that once tho
---
Who cares about the bloodpoints? He just put his friends in a 2v1 situation. What he should've done was tell his friends it was an Insidious Bubba and then they could do gens as fast as they can while he's on the hook giving them a much better chance to escape.
---
Nea has nice cosmetics abd shes the best looking out of the girls
---
You can't get LF with shards, otherwise it'd be the first or second I'd recommend too.
---
I'd consider Spirit pretty fun too once you get the hang of her mindgames. And Hag for similar reasons but I'm probably a weirdo in that regard.
---
Legion gameplay?
---
You're brave to post this here. Legion punched every person in this subs mother. Twice.
---
No, the CD is 10 seconds for shot, plus two three for the reload
---
Yeah I also got them. No flex, just a grind 
---
Yeah I guess the doctor doesn‚Äôt need more tracking but it was nice to have a Build thanatophobia was actually decent on.  Once sloppy butcher got reworked it became pretty insane though. 
---
XD
---
Took a second, but yes it's glorious
---
If your wifi sucks then don't use wifi, use an ethernet cable.
---
Ah, all I really remembered was mommy‚Äôs sword and those eyes.
---
No idea why you are being downvoted, this is the right thing to do.
---
I never play survivor and I find it easy to escape most games. On PS4 it‚Äôs basically 4K or 2k. Nothing in between and the gates are never open on a 4K.
---
Some people live where they don‚Äôt have access to their Ethernet cable
---
Did you mean: *allegedly*?
---
People in the post game chat will report you for breathing, ignore them
---
It's really just experience and intuition. There's only so many places for a survivor to hide so there are certain patterns of searching that can "flush out" a survivor. Also, sometimes you'll need to go low profile to bait the survivor into a false sense of security, let them come out of hiding on their own. Getting some high ground can also help depending on the map.
---
honestly, its so scummy to play killer with horrible internet. 80ping to 340. oof
---
I PE‚Äôed Tapp during the double exp event just for the achievement, no one else is prestiged though. 
---
So it turns out I don't know how to spell.
---
A powerline adapter would come in handy there 
---
Got myself the platinum trophy couple of days ago :)
---
It does?
---
That part was hilarious! I was just like "aww...  poor reject nea"
---
Looking at the after match lobby, all of their levels were different (which is usually a telltale sign of a SWF). Besides, none of these were safe hook rescues, except maybe when Nea got Quentin. Either way, RIP.
---
Buff Legion
---
Its apparently more normal than I thought lol
---
That was not the origin of the meme. It was the devs embracing it
---
That's where you have all the trophies/achievements yeah? 
---
How did you manage the one where all survivors escape through the hatch? Playing with friends?
---
Clearly the nurseüò§üò§
---
Yes play with a 4 man squad, also managed to do it with 3 man and a random once. It's a very fun achievement to get. Recommend the game map since the hatch is always on the lowest floor while the exits are always on the upper floor so the killer will not pressure you really since he will be guarding the exits. Have one guy with a skeleton key (with add-ons) and one guy that gets rid of all the totems.
---
This isn't OP's first post like this. He has also asked a similar question on r/Paladins and on this subreddit months ago. No kink-shaming and all that bullshit, but wtf.
---
Can you  not  make them so damm cute, I can't look  at pig the same way anymore.
---
Ninja Run trope, nice
---
No0b3 
---
Description of the Hooded Leather Jacket (base cosmetic for Julie and Frank): "A couple that shoplifts together stays together."
---
from the game I could see this accomplishment being due to a combination of efficient routing, extremely dumb plays on the survivor's part, and people memeing. 
---
Definitely Hallowed Blight Huntress. 
---
...
---
o.o'
---
I completely agree with you. Disconnecting only benefits the killer by giving him one less person to worry about.
---
Hahahaha I had the name before the tackle, as if he wasn't a dirty player before lol
---
That's 6 whole bloodpoints if everyone brings a party streamer!!!!
---
What's so ignorant about it?
---
Nerf is not the solution, an actual rework is better. Just because a character takes skill, doesn‚Äôt mean that character should be on a completely different level of power compared to another character. It‚Äôs a PVP game, so it‚Äôs my belief that your advantage should come solely from your own skill, not your character. If it were a PVE game I would understand making hard to learn characters OP and easy characters a little weaker, but it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a PVP game so their priority should be keeping the game as balanced for both sides as possible so that the main deciding factor is in fact your skill. 
---
What killers would you run M&amp;A on? I‚Äôm a new player that is just now leveling billy. 
---
Remember Me doesn‚Äôt seem like it has too much utility other than keeping gen rushers around a bit longer. Is that incorrect? 
---
It would just bring back final hook camping. I get you‚Äôre upset, OP but in the long run as a killer it‚Äôs judt needlessly wasting their time especially at the endgame. 
---
same, no need for it otherwise
---
Its not really a secret info, survivors always mention this gamemode in post-round chat whenever i play killer.
---
I almost didn‚Äôt hear it but just as I touched the gate I was like waaaaaait what is that? Aha. She was there the whole game, I only heard her blink twice. She got 0 points lol.
---
Yeah but as soon as they drop the patch where you can attempt killers are just gonna sit there and watch. They‚Äôve talked about this on stream and they won‚Äôt do it for said reason.
---
*but then tunnels in wraith*
---
He just jumped...
---
I've gotten adept achievements for killer even if survivors dc, still counted as a "kill." But yeah i'd rather no one dc'd that'd make for a better experience for all.
---
This deserves so much more credit then it has, I hate how some people hate legion so much that they downvote great fan content as some sort of act of protest. 
---
**The limit of the function that gives the active player amount in Dead by Daylight does not exist**
---
who gave you the permission to leave? The gens dont dismiss you **I do**
---
&gt; do something "special" for opening it
---
You have to have your buddy DC in order to instantly spawn it, i'd count that as doing something special, but maybe that's just me.
---
It suprises me that people actually get this scared vs Huntress, but then again you‚Äôre probably a Meg main. 
---
No offense ;)
---
But alert only works when the pallets are broken right? That's like 7-8 times that the perk would be used. I feel that it's not worth a slot then. Or am I missing anything?
---
If not my wifi, it's my PC :/
---
*seeing the killer only when he is breaking pallets. Empathy atleast let's you see injured people getting chased always. 
---
That's what I literally said before, I made it MYSELF, in PAINT, with a screenshot I found on google. I didn't see those "just girly things" on dbd so I thought it'd be funny. So it's NOT a damn repost.
---
Pallet looping doesn't require skill either unless you're brand new
---
I had one where I was literally stuck in one spot right out in the open. I could spin in a circle but couldn't move. Then a teleporting killer appeared in front of me and downed me. He messages me talking shit for sucking as a survivor, and I said he had quite possibly the worst internet I have ever seen. His response haunts me to this day, "free bloodpoints are free blood points, it's easier to play killer with my internet." It baffles me that people actually enjoy playing a game where you just literally have to hit a person who can't move. 
---
If they wanted the BP, they wouldn't have all disconnected at the end.
---
Can concur, that's what got me through ranked gaming in my student flat during uni.
---
And yes, there were other buff killers too

alert is basically a no risk medium reward version of OoO (high risk high reward)
---
you are the kiler, you are making the rule.
---
I'm working on getting every achievement (PC, lacking 4) and prestiging all survivors and killers, just because i have nothing to pour BP into otherwise, my main survivor has all perks and so does my main killer so why not go for it.
---
Even if you're not good at looping, you should be able to finish gens by simply doing them when you're not in chase.

don't forget guys, less than 40% escape rate, killers must be op.

It be like that sometimes.

Strangers at a campfire...Hi and good luck :D

That's why they tunnel and shoe glaze lmao. So you don't heal.
---
Thrill of the Hunt + Distressing + Ruin + another perk for a little bloodpoint farm build. 
---
Iron grasp + monstrous shrine is the beginning of a basement build. Maybe with Insidious if you want to be a cheeky camper.
---
Dying Light (preferably with a single person mori to knock the obsession off immediatedly) + Ruin + Thanataphobia + sloppy butcher to make a slow game for survivors. 
---
Play with Your Food + Ruin + Sloppy Butcher + Monitor and Abuse (if you grab it from the shrine) + a lery's memorial offering &amp; scratched mirror add-ons can give you a nice jumpscare myers build.
---
That‚Äôs a lot faster than I expected
---
abuse my pp
---
8m is nothing. That's like lunge distance
---
Well getting lots of BP is a reward for being good at the game, so not sure what you are expecting?  
---
6 meters not 8 in tier one.
---
I have like 8 killers at prestige 1, 2 killers unprestiged, but at level 50 and 2 survivors unprestiged, but at level 50. For the killers I'm only interested in their bloody weapons and for survivors, I'm not interested in their bloody cosmetics at all. It's such a shame to prestige em because it removes all their perks
---
Spent ages levelling the doctor at the weekend to get monitor and abuse for Michael and it comes in the shrine a few days later. I hate my life.
---
The one time you start off in the killer TR and it's the one that is probably making his TR huge with perks/add-ons? That's... About right.
---
Offerings don't affect the adept achievements. They can be buggy, but usually it's with killers because you need a certain amount of bloodpoints for the killers' adept achievements. I'm not certain if you need a certain amount of bp for survivors' achievements?
---
Stupid Licensing
---
Using WiFi is probably definition of lag switching.

Thanks

Can Freddie see your location when you are in his dream? I have had multiple different situations where Freddie knows exactly where I am no matter how far away is went from him.

2 of those perks are part of my "screw me team" build: left behined, sole survivor, self care, unbreakable
---
Is Miss Piggy viable in high ranks? I like playing as her, but if I'm gon get bullied, might as well start learning nurse...
---
Some rank 20 killer downvoted you because you hurt his feelings. TOXIC SURVIVOR REEEE
---
You don't have to wear the prestige clothes, those bloody soaked clothes are mostly for show.
---
I would just level up a character you don't play. That way you don't lose all the good perks on the survivors you do play.
---
I usually don't care enough to do it myself, (and instead play a toxic build against them lol) but I don't blame killers who do it. They're in the game to have fun and if they've fought a lot of annoying, toxic SWF groups in the past, of course they're going to avoid any SWF groups in the future. 
---
At least they disconnect in lobby and not in game. Still get to keep your offerings, right?
---
Never said it wasn't.
---
No problem. It seems ridiculous to do things that obviously annoy the other player and assume you deserve to be treated like anyone else. Plus I like the feeling of "good on ya, killer. You won this round"  
---
Good news is, I don't have many purple flashlights, so the chances to be "toxic" are few and far between. 
---

Really...?

You're just jealous ._.

Yes, he can see your outline all the time outside of his terror radius when you're sleeping.

---
I didn't get one for Legion when I got merciless with his only 3 perks -.-
---
That sounds nasty with NOED ü§î 
---
WELL... maybe you're right then. We'll see what he have to say üòÇ
---
also i'm really bad at editing i just got inspired to make a shitpost : (
---
The hatch spawns when the number of generators completed + 1 is greater than/equal to the number of survivors left alive. For example, for the generator to spawn with all 4 survivors left alive, all 5 gens have to be completed. For 3 survivors alive, it's 4 gens -- 2 survivors, 3 gens -- 1 survivor, 2 gens.
---
If you have a key, and the hatch has spawned, you can find the hatch &amp; then get a prompt to "Open Hatch." It basically allows multiple people to escape through the hatch before all gens are completed.
---
Why kill yourself irl when you can kill yourself in a game
---
Nothing probably LOLLL. He's literally selling these shirts too, which, by the way, is illegal
---
I‚Äôm not sure what to say. We used a lot of Dwight pictures to base it off of. https://imgur.com/a/nKLL2LQ/

No it‚Äôs not lol there are videos of it happening

Bankruptcy is a legal status of a person or other entity who cannot repay debts to creditors. In most jurisdictions, bankruptcy is imposed by a court order, often initiated by the debtor.

---
Gen tapping 
---
When that happens your connection is the issue because you are the host to the lobby. Not the survivors 
---
Adept huntress isnt hard at all. Bring insta down hatchets with the +2 ammunition add on and you're guaranteed to get it eventually.

Step 1: Find killer

Step 2: Loop Killer

Step 3: ??????
---
Step 4: Get facecamped for being ‚Äútoxic‚Äù

Step 5: Profit

Just let the killer hit you, works 110%! trust me fellow survivor main
---
ive done this before... and i love it
---
Most killers do, nothing to see here
---
Time to gen rush!
---
There‚Äôs not going to be a Valentine‚Äôs Day event, they are just releasing skins. They would never run events back to back 
---
You know that the killer is the one who host the lobby. 
---
Oh, that makes sense. I always forget that you can just release skins without an event lmao
---
Local bing bong boi goes from low tier virgin who cloaks s and decloaks slowly to Top-Tier Ultra Instinct chad who fucking teleports harder than the nurse

If you were the killer it‚Äôs your WiFi you are the host

Was that the game i was in? An ace with OoO? And he insidious camped and complained we were a 4 stack but we werent

Look into powerline adapters. Might be an easier option for you.

There are people who are bad at playing as survivor even at devotion 2 and 3.
---
Powerline adapter.
---
I really like this except the only problem would be almost everyone runs self heal now or a team medkit so with the increased healing speed all it would really do is make injured survivors heal faster if they get away because they‚Äôll just quick heal themselves
---
I used to be a nea main but then I switched to qt feng
---
I bought Legion day one and I would love it if they would just nuke the fucker out of the game.
---
I‚Äôm petty about it and will struggle until they‚Äôre almost to me and then let myself die. I‚Äôve been hanging on the hook for ages and you just dicked around while someone else got chased ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
soooooo, you apologise for killing? okay...
---
But I would always Kill the farmer first 
---
It isn't ass
---
The fuck you on about? Flashlights are really good at annoying the killer. I feel obligated to run Lightborn or Franklin's every time i see one.
---
Also you must be new. Flashlights used to be OP, there is a very good reason they were changed.
---
They wouldn't do this. No incentive to buy leather face then
---
I called for something similar a while ago, to have people whine it was a BBQ nerf (it isn't)
---
Though I agree 100% on suggestion I would say for the baseline on survivors it be a safe unhook (not just unhook - so hook farmers wouldn't be rewarded).
---
The rework I wanted to WGLF was - You die on the hook 15,20,25% slower. This is doubled if the killer is within 32 meters of you.
---
Little goober that's your punishment for playing dbd on console
---
but if it's so bad as mine was , you'll not have fun
---
I always get jumpscared by those filthy mud witches. 
---
I really like the basis of what you said, but think it should be more simple.
---
* Keep the "charging frenzy" part.
---
* Keep the part where the terror radius is increased in frenzy.
---
* Remove Deep Wounds entirely.
---
* When you hit, but not down a survivor they suffer from *Mangled*.
---
* It takes two hits to down a survivor.
---
* You can now see scratch Marks in Feral Frenzy.
---
Now Legion's power has two uses. You can use it when they are around to try and Mangle as many as possible, you can try to get a free down with it, or you can gamble and try to get as many as you can Mangled and then go for a down.
---
They‚Äôve said on Twitter that they‚Äôre working on a solution for it. 
---
Nah looks fine.  Thanatophobia is a joke which is why the meme is off I'm assuming.
---
You have to look past the "What could have been" factor and stop giving these guys your time and money.  Cut the game out of your life.
---
O I N K
---
On xbox its nothing but spirit, myers, clown and huntress.

---
I think they meant they are now on minute 45 of the match, but didnt leave the first time they saw the mend timer at the beginning of the match. Pointing out how long games against legion can take.
---
To be fair he'd just be trading his PC nurse games for our greatly increased Campers with NOED lol.
---
Just gotta get the timing right, this tutorial helped me https://youtu.be/pshlJLOeX7k
---
Lmfao.
---
New ship: Legion with Satan.
---
Its an okay perk without the bloodpoints. It's easy to bait out so its only *really* good on hypermobile killers i.e. Nurse and Billy.
---
And yeah, what i mean in my second point is the BP gain part of WGLF is baseline, and the perk itself gets changed.
---
More bloodpoints is always a good thing, makes the community less toxic.
---
Ah didn‚Äôt know that was a thing lol :‚Äô) But it‚Äôs okay! Thanks though, I really love Legion
---
I main Leatherface/Trapper. He is really fun.
---
His addons that increase his terror radius make the chance of spawning in his terror radius even smaller since they make his terror radius smaller in punishment mode (and he spawns in punishment mode)
---
When you play both, there's no longer toxicity remain 
---
Which means understanding for both sides
---
I just added your first point to the OP, and I really like the idea for the second perk.
---
Huntress should Dom them.
---
If you know your personal internet connection is truly that bad then it is BM as shit to subject a lobby of four players to that shit and insist on hosting games as a killer.  I've had games where you physically can't run forward you nurse blink backwards into killer back through window vaults, get frozen at hooks and windows and gens.  Physically unplayable horseshit.  If your internet is that horrible just play survivor.  
---
I KNOW I SHOULDNT EXPECT IT, BUT IF I WAITED ON A LOAD SCREEN FOR 10 MINUTES AND IM THE ONLY SURVIVOR WHO SPAWNED KN THE GAME THEN WOULDNT IT MAKE SENSE TO FARM OR PLAY ABOUT FOR A BIT INSTEAD OF BEING ON MY DICK IN 5 SECONDS FLAT AND HOOKING ME? LIKE COME ON, THATS A WASTE OF 10 MINUTES FOR BOTH OF US
---
Yeah 3 times already.
---
I do billy and nurse. My first killer that I grinded out was good old Leatherface for BBQ, but to me at least it's more of an M1 killer.
---
THE ONE GAME I DARE TO TAKE THE FUCKING ESCAPE CAKE OFFERING THE KILLER DCS AFTER 1 MINUTE
---
Honestly Kindred only works beginning to mid game or in the very rare situation that the killer is camping. Otherwise, it has very little use and if you're on coms or you already have other survivors working on gens and only one leaves, it's implied that you stay and he/she unhook.
---
Yes.
---
The problem with this game is you can't do anything without the other side getting upset. Killing is tunneling, defending is camping, using pallets and flashlights is toxic, etc.
---
Everyone's really childish for a game intended for mature audiences.
---
Pick your poison I say
---
There was a guy who used a lag switch against me and a friend. And he admitted to using it because we gen rushed him üôÑ we still won though, lag switching and somehow still couldn't kill anyone 
---
I WOULD HAVE JUST KILLED HIM, AND APOLOGIZED AFTERWARD THAT HIS TEAM WAS DICKHEADS.
---
I'm sad bill was so mean to the spirit &gt;:(
---
You forgot no mither smh
---
It's even a nice shade of salmon
---
Everyone is bitching about legion in game, but their design is easily my favorite. They just have so much fun potential fan content.
---
CONSOLE WAS SO BAD I BOUGHT THE GAME AGAIN ON PC AND NOW HAVE TO GRIND FOR TEACHABLES AGAIN
---
they're not bad if you can use them well, and if the killer doesn't spam drop every time you try to save
---
Hey now hey now, red rank  console has a lot more to offer than simply camping insta saw Billy's, I take offense to that!  We also have camping noed Billy's, camping noed Clowns, camping noed Wraiths, Camping noed Leatherfaces, Proxycamping noed Spirits, Proxycamping noed Nurses, Proxycamping noed Legions, Camping noed Pigs, Tunneling noed Freddie's, proxycanping noed Doctors. There is no shortage to the wonderful cornucopia that is red rank killers on Console.  A rich woven tapestry of sportsmanship and skillful play.  Shame on you sir.
---
Wait what? Dwight from the pizza place... LOOKS LIKE DWIGHT FROM DBD?!
---
What‚Äôs worse is that you had the Halloween items which meant he was so unaware he couldn‚Äôt see you in one of the most flashy items in the game.
---
Not true. Simply not true.
---
Yea, because most people are not quiters and like a challenge, but it is unti fun for survivors. This is why I hate Billy probably more than nurse. Just coming from across the map, bam, GG. Or if you get caught doing "bad" gen, he just walks next to you and GG.
---
Imagine being a cruel murderer that tortures other people in sick games to spark their hope of survival but design the games in a way so they can't survive, but some people on the internet draw you as a cute piggy so you can't be taken serious anymore.
---
I swear if saw was real you'd be all dead.
---
Okay
---
LEVELED HUNTRESS AND CLOWN TO 45 EACH AND STILL NO BBQ ON EITHER 
---
I swear to God the game follows my leveling. I did hag 2 weeks ago and then we get ruin. I just finished doctor on Sunday and now we get m&amp;a. Next week if enduring shows up I'll know it's true. 
---
Dwight does that all the time ingame. The nose is off, the hair is off, the shape is off. Similar ‚â† stolen
---
I'm gonna get my diaper changed and learn some shapes and then you're so getting downed by my NOED.  
---
If only 1 of the survs is lagging it ain't my net
---
Yeah that's pretty lucky! Unfortunately I'm only proficient with like, 2 killers, so an accident like that make me lose some of my mind lol
---
so is Remember Me. Alert is nice too
---
Yeah duh lol
---
also r/woooosh to everyone who downvoted that dudes post
---
actually it is. You are the host. It's all based off your internet.
---
Yeah, well, fuck. 
---
For apologize for doing what the KILLER is supposed to do.. You know.. KILL. 
---
yep 
---
Those are definitely pretty meta builds, you can't get much better (without dropping WGLF or BBQ for the farm, that is). Borrowed time was nerfed but it is still pretty annoying, just make sure you can get away safely when you use it.
---
I play killer, so i am more help on that side, perks you should look to get are:
---
Surveillance: Lets you track what gens are getting done
---
Discordance: Lets you track the most important gens to check
---
Pop Goes the Weasel: Lets you bust gens WAAAAAY better
---
Spirit Fury/Endurance/Brutal strength: Because fuck pallets.
---
Bamboozle: Because fuck Windows.
---
Save the Best for Last: Lets you get REALLY fast chases if you don't chase your obsession
---
Sloppy Butcher: Because Mangled is a very good effect.
---
And if Nurse's isn't doing it for you, try running Stridor or Bloodhound instead, they do the same thing, just differently.
---
Once you have all of those, you can pretty much change your build around however you want.
---
*pallet-stun noise*
---
Whenever I see someone get hooked, I continue to work my gen and I pray that they get the person.
---
They don't.
---
The hooked person dies first hook.
---
I get hooked.
---
What are they doing? 
---
**Sabotaging Hooks across the map**
---
If you have shithole internet, play survivor. Simple as that.
---
I'm glad lol cause I struggled so much until I gave in to comment on here. Thanks for the heads up!
---
*graoo~*
---
I was rank 1 before reset and playing 3 person SWF (all rank 1s) we went 4-1 (W/L) 
---
Already close to rank 8 so it's not going to last long. Before reset we had about a 1 in 5? chance of all getting out so we weren't amazing Rank 1s.
---
It's likely to be lopsided games where it goes 1 way or the other rather fast for a few days. There are some amazing killers out there.
---
Oh, there was no self caring. Just him, in a dead sprint, hauling ass and ducking behind a truck. Bitch wings the hatchet straight up almost, hits an entire survivor length above him and downs him.
---
Remember me isn't that good, if you run it then you adjust that they will get all the gens done and you will need more time. It isn't that bad but there are just so many other better perks to chose from so its not worth 2k shards.
---
 ***Speedy runner***  
---
***Speedy driver***  
---
***Push it push it power and go***  
---
***Speedy runner***  
---
***Crazy driver***  
---
***Feel the passion you got inside*** 
---
Played a 600 ping game last night cause why not. Turns out the killer was playing off his phones wifi hotspot just to get that last event coin.
---
The hatch spawns with at least 2 people left 3 gens done.
---
But gets opened when there is only 1 remaining. So it is not doing nothing special.
---
Yes, it is just you. 
---
Window misses should stun the killer, reducing incentive to swing through.
---
Lmao, I had a massively long game as Legion today too. It was on The Game map and the survivors had worked themselves into a 3 gen setup. It was real rough on them. Someone ended up d/cing and I was like, 'if I wasn't getting like 50k for this match I would leave too.'
---
Such build is pretty good but still you then rely only on the end game instead of game as a whole, if they'll destroy your totem, you won't down anybody, not load up your remember me enough and/or having obsession unlock the gate makes survivors get s big disadvantage.
---
I think I'll drop Borrowed Time for Self-Care. Wouldn't Bond be better though, since it would also help with getting gens done faster? The Self-Care heal takes a long time
---
built in fire-up lmao
---
Real men only need three perks. 
---
Wait, am I reading this right? Are you suggesting it takes only TWO frenzy hits to down someone? If so, you just made Legion 100x worse to play against and insanely OP. I don‚Äôt understand why they would change targets when they can easily down someone mere seconds after hitting them the first time. 
---
This sub doesn't seem to like a lot of people. Anyone with friends, slightly worse connection or even developers of the game. People should remember the point is to have fun while you play as killer and as survivor. Don't camp if you hate when people camp you. Don't tunnel if you hate when people tunnel you. Don't croutchspam after pallets if you hate when killers do it to you. I could go on but my point is an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind (or in this case, being toxic because others are only makes the community worse). I play SWF with that mentality. I play to have fun with my friends, not taunt killers. That isn't fun. (And I'm not directing this at you, more the people you mentioned in your comment) if you can't accept that because you're salty then you should really get a grip.
---
This is me I have exactly 3 brain cells when it comes to those damn lanterns
---
I think I'll definitely switch Nurse's Calling for Enduring. Of the chase helping perks Enduring seems like the most impactful vs vaulting faster or destroying pallets faster. Nurse's Calling just seemed really good on Myers with Monitor &amp; Abuse but I guess it's not that necessary, I can just try to listen for them.
---
Dat Wardrobe though.  Her cosmetic game is fleek af.
---
Imagine waiting an entire year for a UAV perk to go on the shrine and then you give up and buy leatherface and 2 days later it‚Äôs on the shrine
---
M&amp;A is good on Myers
---
Nice image persistence. 
---
20 feet? Oh nooooooooo, that's soooooooooo long, I toooooooooooooooooooooootally feel for your immense struggle.

Only now am I realizing the icon is the Doc's face.

I always thought it was a mushroom cloud for some dumb reason.

To me it looks like The Nurse has her tongue out and is disgusted with this gift of getting to dance in an empty circus tent. Wraith should try harder next year.

---
in all seriousness, though, great artwork!
---
I'll have like mid tier ping, say around 120, but as soon as the game fucking starts, people start lagging around the map, the load on someones internet is greater once it has to load all the things and not just some people in one screen. sometime their internet can handle it, others it can't. 
---
It sucks we can only run 4! It makes it really hard to choose but I guess that's half the fun. A different build I've thought of would be something like Hillbilly with Surveillance, Pop Goes the Weasel, Hex: Ruin, and Discordance but I'm a long way from having all of that
---
No, you guys just get mad when you get caught
---
Looks like you got the in the spirit of fun meme 4 man.   I got the nastier variant of this yesterday with a 4 man last second switching to brown shirt Claudettes with instaheals and crackers.  They tried bm'ing so hard but I played them merciless as fuck.  2 of them dc'd lol. Spent a good while teabagging the obsession with my trapper.  They were so scummy lol.  Love it when they queue into you expecting to bully and you quickly establish that that shit will not be tolerated. 
---
Freddy w/ Remember Me, Dying Light, and Thanataphobia with ivory mori and 3 second dream demon = gates literally never opening. That's a fun meme build imo
---
Wait, wouldn't Play with your Food stack with the engraving speed boost? Oh, Entity help us!
---
Almost all shrines suck
---
Story of my life lmao
---
SPIRIT MAINS RISE UP. 
---
RIN WILL WIN. 
---
First of all rank doesn't matter and you can get to rank 1 with any killer. A tier list in DBD at least for killers should be based on how effectively they can get a 4K IMO
---
DARN
---
As the poll creator, I must remain neutral.
---
**AS A DIE-HARD WEEABOO I MUST PROTECT RIN AT ALL COSTS AND MAKE HER THE CUTEST, MOST DEADLY KILLER EVER**
---
You can say so with every ivory mori+op addons. Plus, you need to tunell one person a lot and if you want that remember me 5 tokens you can't kill him. With ivory mori+op addons you will probably win the game before the gates open. 
---
Spine Chill isn't supposed to be used for the boost, that's just an extra effect, it's used to know when the killer is looking at you
---
My issue is, DBD has many players. Us veterans with at least 150+ hours KNOW you can get hit through a window. So unless all these people are baby survivors and I'm just suddenly bad, why am I getting hit 15 feet away from the window and THROUGH pallets? It's obviously an issue now where it wasn't before, if nothing changed then people wouldn't be talking about it. 
---
Happened to me few times this week: 
---
Wild Feng coming for unhook: " Don't worry buddy, I'm coming, you gonna be alright, I'm gonna unhook you, heal you, we gonna do a gen together, and escape... Uuu a totem, gonna cleanse it first". 
---
When killer sees I'm in second stage, comes back to tunnel me and GG.
---
It‚Äôs really just for the outfits. It says you get better items more often but it‚Äôs almost unnoticeable.
---
No Frank's No Noed?  I call shenanigans on this Kangaroo court!
---
Just happened to me today. Survivor was running for the exit and I got two hits off on her. Except when I go down to pick her up she‚Äôs already running through the door with only a limp. The other survivors then teleported as they were evading me to go to the exit. I only got 1/4 and almost destroyed my controller.
---
You mean Hag...
---
Ya that's what I figured. A lot of rank 1's disguised as rank 10's for a bit haha. 
---
thanks!
---
That is your connection. You are host everything runs off the host connection. 
---
Well, technically we're talking not exactly about the designer of those torture games but rather about his accomplice...
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want 115 movement speed because it‚Äôs awful to spend most of my time running around m1ing‚Äù is honestly the dumbest excuse I have ever heard for a buff I have seen in my life, you do know his movement speed is 110 right? So you‚Äôd rather run around at 110 movement speed in a chase than 115 because it‚Äôs long to run around M1ing people
---
Think about it though, you can't entirely plan for Thanatophobia's effects, while people run self-heal, that means they have to waste a perk slot on Self-Care, when there can be a few other perks now that could go on that spot, if they aren't running self-care, they're carrying medkits, and that means not carrying a toolbox.
---
Thanatophobia could make for some really fun risk vs reward, bring toolboxes to rush the progress and risk getting fucked up without self-heal, or bring self-heal/medkit and have slower generator progression? 
---
Maybe bring self-heal and a toolbox but then waste the slot of perks like Borrowed Time, Leader, Sprint Burst, We'll Make It, Decisive Strike, etc.
---
There is a lot of potential in this, I feel.
---
Lantern would make a bit more sense...
---

Rainbow six siege joke: The Huntress is The lord Tachanka of Dead By Daylight
---
This is so sad. Can we get an F in chat? 
---
I think reaching red ranks is very doable, even as a new player but during some matches you can basically hit a brick wall because most players already are using a min maxed builds, items, addons and can easily capitalize on their strengths.
---
But for better or worse the ranking system is basically a mirror of hearthstone's and in order to rank up you just have hog a bit more activity than your team mates and even if you don't survive you rank up.
---
probably more than half the time I can't survive a trial
---
Oh no I know, it‚Äôs just a piss off when you‚Äôve had a decent game and the internet decides to crap out at the last second. 
---
Ruin and Nurse's is toxic?
---
Not every ping indicator will show high ping until just before you load into the game or during the game when the host internet starts getting spikes. 
---
lol , by not fun i meant literally .
---
they can't move that much other than being stuck around doors
---
Because the killer is the host
---
Ardetha and Rhyaree are fun streamers to watch
---
So tell me, when 1 surv's ping is spiking, buy literally everyone else has normal ping, how in the fuck can it be MY net?
---
Being the host doesn't mean the surv's connection is irrelevant.
---
I'm pointing out the glaring weakness of this game, lol.
---
I don‚Äôt have any info but I would wait before you buy Chapter 10
---
How about something less disrespectful
---
She ain't even the creator, just the side piece 
---
WHY THE HELL DOES IT STILL TAKE DECADES TO GET INTO A GAME! IM ONLY RANK 5 AND I STILL CANT FIND A GAME AND IF I DO ITS A KILLER THAT FACE CAMPS AND OR HAS POTATO WIFI
---
*Hits someone who is far from a window after a vault, while still standing at the window*
---
Guess I'm actually a survivor complaining about hitboxes.

The legion are bully hunters.

This is too cool.

A MESSAGE TO SURVIVORS THAT LIKE TO THROW AROUND THE ACCUSATIONS OF CAMPING - IF YOUR STUPID ASS TEAM HAS BEEN ROUTINELY UNHOOKING YOU TEN SECONDS AFTER I HOOK YOU, I'M GOING TO PATROL A BIT BEFORE I CHECK GENS. 
---
P. S.  THANKS FOR BEING SALTY ABOUT THAT CHAINSAW SPRINT ACROSS THE ENTIRE MAP OF FIELDS THAT DOWNED YOUR TEAMMATE AS THEY WERE TRYING TO UNHOOK. 
---
yea, probably comes march early the ptb and 2 weeks later the final version
---
My bad. 
---
Of the five items in the game, flashlights are weaker than toolboxes and medkits (usually) as well as keys in most situations. The only thing they are for sure better than would be maps. 
---
The only prestige that gives you noticable advantage is Claudette P3, anything else is just for looks.
---
Is your flair the frenzy breathing?
---
The only thing we know is that this killer is the oldest tondate and that it has to do something with the flag of Mali
---
yes
---
And here are the item decriptions: https://i.redd.it/1ib3e9qo9dg21.jpg
---
Well you're literally saying someone killed themselves on a lighthearted post.
---
Not featured because dedicated servers are expensive. They are implementing them though so I am happy about that.
---
It doesn‚Äôt get rid of brown items. The only thing prestige gives you is a Bloody Cosmetic. 
---
My guess is Plague/Witch Doctor.
---
Exactly, if that means reduced use of Frenzy, then its a nerf.
---
If you read the OP, you have to "charge" the Frenzy first. It would be a slightly less powerful but more "utility" version of EW3 really.
---
The only post I‚Äôll upvote of a filthy quentin lover
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been there man. I dropped a pallet in front a doctor and I watched him glitch through it, grab me and then end up on the side we started. I try to play survivor now more so as to not ruin game for everyone lol.
---
&gt; He is definitely simple, but relies on mindgames. he is the most underrated killer imho. His power allows him to:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Force an early pallet drop
---
&gt; Mince any survivors out of position
---
&gt; Control hook and totems
---
&gt; Force bad decisions
---
&gt; I would really like to see minor QoL tweaks but other then that, he is solid.
---
Copied and pasted from another reply.
---
Good choice my man good choice
---
I love it
---
Pretty much. I'll generally go after the rescuer if given the choice, but if I come back to a fresh rescue hook with nobody in sight and find the injured survivor right around the corner, well, sorry buddy. 
---
I was considering to prestige all killers that have good rare add-ons to increase their chances, but... that'd take like forever. Got P1 on my main survivor a while back and got sidetracked with getting all my low-level chars out of no-perks range and trying to get BBQ on every killer.
---
Throws 10 pallets at me within a minute, decisive strike, dead hard, lantern, gets surprised if I make sure he dies first.
---
Another Doctor would be disappointing tbh
---
That's was great. Keep it up!
---
Wow! V ery trad of you!
---
I did it for the achievement the first time. But, now that I have most of the teachable perks unlocked I feel like I have to go for P3 or I'm wasting my bloodpoints, because I can hit 50 with a char and only have tier I/II perks, and usually no BBQ. So, if I'm going to invest more bloodpoints into getting better perks at level 50, I may as well get to P3 before doing so.
---
Yeah. Because someone literally did. He was my friend. What do you want me to say, 'sorry I went on the internet today'? I get that it's light hearted, but I'm not here to be an asshole, and that doesn't mean you have to be one
---
Fucking brilliant.
---
Well the Devs said it should take 25-30 hours to unlock 1 character so, if that is true, it'd certainly be possible to be ready whenever a new Chapter comes along.
---
The problem is people have already developed meta builds that include self heal, or worst case scenario they are in swf and just quick heal then jump back on gens. The reason being injured works now is it actually wastes some time healing but if they can heal super fast they have no reason to stay injured and you will never come across injured survivors so the struggle to down them will increase and every chase will have to be a full chase
---
Yeah, I usually run Bond. Though I also like Aftercare, though it's slightly more situational. 
---
Template?
---
Crap, I actually kind of want M&amp;A. But I want to save my shards for unlocking killers (and Doc is not first in order)... ;__;
---
If your house is old and has bad wiring like mine, that might not work. I tried that and got terrible speeds, worse than my wifi. 
---
I ended up moving my machine up a floor and connecting it through ethernet.
---
I play on wifi too, and as long as not all of my shitbag flatmates are downloading porn, the quality is impeccable. 
---
There's a trick to that: you have to disable autoconfig, so your wifi card doesn't check for new networks every ~10 seconds, which causes lagspikes. If you're on Windows, the command for that is:  
---
&gt; netsh wlan set autoconfig enabled=no interface="&lt;name of your wireless interface here&gt;"
---
Doesn't an ethernet cable stop being effective once it exceeds a certain amount of feet?
---
Not really worth the hassle, but if you have nothing better to do go ahead. Did P3 for Nea, then didn't bother ever since to do it for anyone else, those cosmetics suck anyway.
---
Leather face or the cannibal for bbq and chilli for bp and it‚Äôs a good perk
---
That's not antifun, you just need to L2P in those cases.
---
If you are getting hit by cross map chainsaws, then you should probably start playing with sound. All you need to do is hug the end of a wall.
---
And if you got caught doing a gen with no windows or pallets nearby then you fucked up and are getting punished for it. Respect the killer and start leaving before he's on top of you.
---
Antifun is taking away tools from the player so they can't have fun. Like pallets and windows (survivors tools for extending chases) being near useless against the Nurse and Legion due to their powers.
---
The future for console looks bleak, the player base on xbox seems to be stagnant and shrinking. Honestly would love to see massive updates to fix the game rather than adding new content, and as fun as a new game mode would be that would probably kill it on xbox as I doubt the playerbase is big enough to support two separate game modes.
---
Nicely done! 
---
Don‚Äôt worry, survivors are getting it to. During events more people play survivor and then once they end a lot more people play killer. 
---
The reset may be a part of it but it isn‚Äôt the main reason.
---
Both
---
Who's Sam again?
---
FUCK
---
Okay how about you peep literally any DBD montage video where they show 5 + minutes of shots that should have hit but missed instead by some kind of fucking magic
---
&gt; Even so, me not playing killer all the time doesn't change the fact that the hitboxes are a legitimate issue
---
This is true. Like Huntress hatches literally flying through people's bodies and doing nothing
---
Someone else already explained, but I'll explain how it turned out in my game: there were 3 generators in a triangle on the bottom floor of The Game, which is a pretty small map. I could easily walk between the 3 gens with very little time spent to do so.
---
Their only hope was to bait me away from the generators and to the top floor, and bless them, they tried, but the bait was too obvious. What made it worse for them was that I was only trying to get my BBQ &amp; chili stacks, so I was guarding with a 3 gen strat &amp; wouldn't hook anyone but the survivors I had left on my 4 stack, so it lasted a solid 40 minutes until someone d/ced, I gave someone else their final hook, and I caught my two survivors for my 4 stack. I just wanted my stack so I tried to let them leave with lanterns, but one of them didn't rescue the other, and then when I downed the last survivor and brought him to a lantern, he panicked and ran off and escaped without it.
---

I know the joke kind of sucked this time, but I think the template was pretty good. Tomorrow's will be the best so far though. ;)
---
What if you don't want to play survivor, killer lobbys are way faster than survivor lobbys.
---
Damn a little overpriced honestly in my opinion 
---
*over a pallet
---
Oh, but of course. 
---
Aww, I like Legion. My complaint is actually that he's not a very strong killer. I played Legion up to rank 3 (no frank's mixtape or stab wounds studies, only used one mori, ranking up was based on having a lot of 3 and 4ks &amp; not just stabbing people, and I don't moonwalk), and when I switched to trying different killers because I wanted variety and it felt like SO much less of a struggle.
---
SURVIVORS! IF I CAN TURN AROUND FROM THE HOOK AND SLAP YOU ACTOSS THE FACE WITH MY MASSIVE COCK, I‚ÄôM NOT GOING TO IGNORE YOU AND WALK AWAY!
---
I love when I do shit like this and the killer shakes their head at me.  "O......K.....?"
---
"Us veterans with at least 150+ hours" xD
---
Just put it on hold on a function key.
---
I play both pretty equally. And hit boxes are fine. You fucks are literally the most entitled trash I have ever seen
---
Proving your points with facts such as live video footage shouldn't be an out-of-the-norm thing. I'm telling you their is video out there proving these issues to be true. But you rather avoid that proof to try and seem right. I've been agreeing with your complaints as killer all the while trying to get across that survivors also have shit they deal with. It doesn't have to be a case of, "Only this side has it bad and the rest are just pansies," which is the narrative you are trying to push. 
---
If you have to ask "is this guy lag switching" he's not. I've seen lag switching in For Honor and once you've seen it once, you KNOW what it looks like. 
---
Bad Wi-Fi is not like lag switching at all and if someone mistakes it for that, they've never seen a real lag switcher.
---
No blighted bing bong? :(
---
I still fucking love the wraiths smiley face on his big toe with legacy 3 
---
Wanna hear an example of a genuine survivor issue to disprove you creaming about my bias?
---
Survivors are almost always the victims of patch bugs. That is a fact.
---
That hit boxes are fucked for survivors is a lie
---
I wish I wasn't on console so that I could actually play nurse, because her outfit is neat-o.
---
From the wiki page:  White Ward will protect any item in the survivor's possession upon death. It does not protect the *specific* items equipped upon beginning the trial. 
---
it's a Witch Doctor
---
10 bucks for a full outfit? Nah seems pretty standard to me. It could be much worse like 20$ only bundle or loot boxes. Any game that has reasonably priced direct purchases get support for me.
---
Ight I'm done with this discussion because I've been the only one backing up what he's saying and offering outlets to prove what I'm saying is true while you just say "I personally haven't had an issue so you're wrong," with no evidence other than that you said so. Whatever my man your loss
---
Try running kindred.
---
No mither auto unlocks resilience, dead hard, and with iron will you are a God.  I think the perk is pretty bad, but I have definitely gone looking for trouble so my resilience is active.
---
I came for Skeletor. 
---
~~^(I cum for Skeletor)~~
---
sure, that should be nerfed.
---
Any Ideas?
---
If anything is more closely resembles the reference he posted. But you have fun believing whatever you want, buddy.
---
Not necessarily. If they have a bad or slow connection TO the host, that can lead to them being laggy through no fault of the host.
---
I can have the best connection in the world, and if your internet is slow as shit, well. I'm in for a bad time, regardless of my fiberoptic godly internet. 
---
Must be a big with the recent patch. Had a game where teammates removed their traps, then ended up dying to an invisible bear trap 
---
wow just irl money, thanks EA very cool!
---
It makes perfect sense. As the survivors draw near to death they get scared which causes the debuff. Once the survivor is dead the fear is gone as they no longer are there to be fearful. 
---
Another factor could be everyone wants to play Wraith/Nurse bc of the skins.
---
It really doesn't. Literally everything matches up. And even then. The reference is by the same artist- and it's not referenced, it's traced. 
---
There‚Äôs, like, at least 100 Pig fuckers here and they‚Äôre scattered around the globe.  Jigsaw (and his gang) haven‚Äôt even killed 50 in a career spanning 15 years.  How‚Äôs he supposed to get to all of us?  Besides, we‚Äôve got David Cameron on our side!  I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs got secret service bodyguards or something.
---
good point just sucks I cannot get it with shards I have like 50k lol
---
Even those who follow you backwards are in for a bad time against a team that knows their map tiles well.
---
Oh alright thanks for your reply
---
You monster, you pretty much gave Wraith 10th degree burns! light hurts alot
---
It takes practice to get good on it.  I play on xbox and was convinced I sucked using her because she sucks on console but I normally get 4k now with her.
---
Naw that'd be wack. If they already missed the window swing why punish em further?
---
Be sure to have ps4 identified as primary (could make a difference who knows)
---
I KNOW I'M SO SORRY! I love Wraith but he kept picking people up right in front of me...it was too tempting.
---
You realize the survs McDonald's Wifi can CAUSE HIM to have a bad connection to the host in the first place, right? God you people are morons.
---
Yea true, but I'm still surprised I even managed to hit those. I never get flashlight saves, I'm god-awful at them. Used to be good but then the pickup timing got buffed...
---
To reduce incentive in the first place.
---
Mali is likely because they code name chapters as countries tho 
---
If I have all-seeing on wraith I go out of my way to hit up corn town. Survivors are never prepared for the bing bong blitz.
---
Darn
---
Most of the context is summed up in the picture. I used a burning splint for the meme. And this guy doesn't seem to understand how killer offerings work.  I'm still being messaged how I'm "bad" because I used freddy, but the funniest part is being congratulated by the rest of the team while this golden little salt mine just keeps spewing.
---
Also, yes. I fucked up spelling weakest and also got the offering name wrong. Oops
---
That‚Äôs the hard truth. I‚Äôve played with people who have a connection so bad that they‚Äôre either using a lag switch or just have the worst internet in the world. Just because you want to play killer doesn‚Äôt mean you have to ruin it for 4 survivors. I suggest most people with internet that bad use lag switches though. I played a game with a legion who had such a high ping that it didn‚Äôt let anyone mend and we all bled out (I have the vid if anyone wants to see).
---
&lt;3
---
Eh I'm not sure that's a solution. If someone looks in range to get smacked the killer should be allowed to to for it without a random stun fearing them into not swinging. 
---
But that's not proving anything! It's a completely spoiled sample!
---
I fucking do not understand how you don't get this.
---
Going on to youtube and finding a 5 minute montage of hits that should have missed does not prove that there is a hit box issue. It shows that sometimes *for some reason* there are hits that happen that should not have. That does not translate to there being a hit box issue for devs to fix.
---
those hits could have been for other reasons like lag switching or latency and it's going to be an insanely small fraction of games/hits. You don't push fixes for shit like that
---
I wouldn't say nerfed is the right word. It's just a highly effective use of the mechanic that is very easy to pull off and the only counter is literally No Mither (bar having a big patch of tall grass you can use to hide the blood). It needs something about it redone so it isn't as easy to pull off for following someone for 10 seconds for them to go down
---
Unfortunately, I do not have any ideas. 
---
I thought it was the worst one yet, the spirit joke was just not funny
---
by the sound of the gen, the bill definitely was just trying to get the gen finished (it sounds nearly there)
---
Firecrackers people! 
---
I thought the eyes were mouths with demon tongues coming out for a short time. 
---
Looks cooler actually, I like the woodcut feels to it. Well done OG artist and OP.
---
It's a 1x use perk that guarantees a tunnel and/or juggel and takes up a slot from a better perk. Fuck DS.
---
In the same vein tho, fuck noed too. It should scale. 1, 2, 3 or 2, 3, 4 on insta downs. Shitty killers running baby noed shouldn't be rewarded for doing jack shit.
---
Because countless footage showcasing a point isn't bullshit. I'm ignoring it because I'm done yelling at a brick wall who can't hold an L
---
When they posted the picture that let us know they codename every chapter as a country (Freddy being England, Legion being Guam I think) every chapter was a folder and there was a fuck ton of folders (they blurred the ones we don't know about). You can find the picture around this sub.
---
I USED TO MAIN SURVIVOR AND I THOUGHT KILLERS WERE ALL WHINY UNTIL I STARTED PLAYING KILLER AND IT TOTALLY CHANGED MY PERSPECTIVE ON EVERYTHING. SURVIVORS KNOW JACK SHIT
---
Just play normally and get your bp.
---
the dead guy is sure, but his team mates have witnessed death, and are more fearful because of it
---
Thanks! Hopefully next weeks shrine gives us another interesting story to tell. 
---
This is the devs fault and dedicated servers need to become available ASAP. 
---
nice youtube profile pic. i really like that scp
---
Just play nurse but you use the BP on others?
---
they just increased chest rarity drops so it‚Äôs fairly easy to find one now, especially with plunderers. I usually get a pink item 95% of my games 
---
Naked and ~~Afraid~~ *Aroused.* 
---
I just get them to rank 30 so I can get all the teachables then I move on.
---
Fucking up a killer just to get slugged from NOED is kinda our fault for not cleansing totems as the game progresses. I usually won't pop last gen until I think majority of totems are gone. At least we can use the DS whereas breaking totems ahead of time just out right disables that perk before it can happen
---
A life saver in most situations.
---
I'll never forget the children trying to tell me that I sounded dumb for calling it abuse instead of abuse.  They're different words!
---
My fuckin life playing solo. Although in red ranks, seems like people actually want points so they will save me. 
---
This guy makes more content like this on his channel that you can view [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDqItEHKH4HaV_cMsBP-hCw?)
---
Legion, he cant even see scratches
---
Honestly it even freaks people out on killers who can get around pallets too. One of my last Legion games was just bulking through every pallet and to see Susie Naruto Running at you only to have the pallet just explode is a great feeling. 
---
Just play nurse and use BP to level up Doc....easy no?
---
But... that doesn't make sense. Wouldn't they be just as afraid of dying, especially since now their chances are even less they'll make it out alive with less people in the trial? I would say that the effects would be exacerbated by the fact that one of them actually did die.
---
If you time it right its real. It's obviously better with addons, but I do it all the time without. It's especially a thing when they decide to wait behind the pallet (usually to heal).
---
The reason I don't mind when a new killer gets carried by NOED is because while learning the game, they should be able to have a moment to enjoy themselves and feel powerful. Yeah it can suck on the other side, but at rank like 8 and below killers usually ditch NOED for dedicated builds which end up being more scary at most times
---
A Dwight instead of a nice "killer" huh... Not sure how you cleansed all the totems and did all the gens... but alright, man.
---
WHAT DID YOU SAY? I CAN'T HEAR YOU!
---
The legion (Julie)
---
I‚Äôm merely saying why the perk works the way it does. That‚Äôs what the devs intended so who knows.
---
It use to apply to dead people and it was very antifun so I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs why they removed it
---
Who else read it 2 ways 
---
I know, but the countries' thing doesn't seem to really correlate with anything or if it does it seems to vague to be useful.
---
source, info?
---
You don't even get rid of brown items. At about level 40-45, all bloodwebs look like the following, regardless of prestige
---
* 16-18 mix of Common/Uncommon
---
* 6 Rares
---
* 2-3 Very Rare
---
* 0-1 Ultra Rare
---
and that's it. Doesn't matter if you're P0 or P3
---
It's like Maui had an overinflated opinion of how great he is and thought he didn't need the help of others despite reality, it's like a meme-metaphor or something
---
I wish there was a new game mode. Would be so dope
---
source, link? ;)
---
Bruh I have a friend who tried to play Freddy with us on KYF and we just name him "Meta Freddy" cause he would down us through walls.
---
Either do what the other guy said and play nurse and use the bloodpoints on doc, or play Doc and focus on shocking a lot before you try to kill, you will get a ton of points.
---
But if you really want to derank, just don't hook anyone.
---
You get 1 shot on DS and it doesn't rely on your teammates not fucking up. Noed cleansing relies super heavily on swf, and fuck off if you're in a random. Half your squad may be dead from stupidity by the tome the gens are done.
---
Now, I'm not saying get rid of noed completely, but it and DS both should scale with Level. Maybe make the skill check for DS suuuuper tiny at lvl 1.
---
this is one of the best uses of that dream thing ive seen. wow
---
The reason why BP gain is slower for survivors is 
---
A: You‚Äôre splitting the work amongst yourself as a survivor and thus also splitting the rewards
---
B: The adjusted BP gains are an incentive for people to play killer because it‚Äôs the more difficult role and the role that tends to be constantly in demand.
---
If you want more BP then go play killer, you‚Äôll help the queue times and the incentive does what it‚Äôs supposed to. If the BP gains were even between individual survivors and the killer then the queue times for survivor would get even worse than they are now, and you can kiss swf goodbye between the 15 minute wait and the dodging.
---
I'll never learn 
---
Is that Frank or Joey trying to get that kiss with Susie?
---
Nope. I've never done it and never will. If you don't care about the (imho shitty) cosmetics, then there is no reason to reset the already crazy RNG grindfest that is the bloodweb. Don't fall for it.
---
A lot still run self heal and just have one as a designated runner to distract you so they don‚Äôt need to worry about it. And with swf they are coordinated enough to quick get heals between gens and with those healing buffs it would take them seconds. I‚Äôm just saying if you made those specific changes to a perk the perk would be relatively useless due to survivors just super quick healing and never being injured
---
20% is about 4 seconds iirc (from sloppy)
---
the heal buff is to make thanta not insanely overbearing on killers like legion/nurse/wraith/hag who can spread injury's very very fast, and every second they take moving to a spot to be healed (SC or teammate) and are in the heal, is time they are not on a gen (bonus if its regressing) which is an improvement over the survivors who never heal more than once or twice a game due to adrenaline covering them, since thanta forces a heal every time they are hit due to the penalty which wastes far more time than sloppy could ever hope to.
---
right above you if you didn't refresh
---
Unless you've got a video there's not a lot that anyone can help you with for that. Might have been a hell of a lob could be anything.
---
Thats why i always go to burger king to play dbd
---
This is the optimization station
---
Some days are better but last night I waited roughly 15/20 min for three matches and all three had the killer DC in the lobby. I played almost an hour without ever finding an actual game. 
---
Hoping dedicated servers help bring the game to a new level cause I enjoy playing when I actually get a chance to lol
---
This doesn‚Äôt solve the biggest issue with legions power, the fact that you cannot counter their power at all. Once they are fully charged they will still get a guaranteed down, they just have to work for it a little bit more. 
---
Sorry, but I had to come back to laugh at your assumption, cause its wrong xD
---
80 to 100 ping is fine. anything above that is the issue.
---
Well done, now the hard part: Getting back to rank 20
---
His standard lately has been sloppy/nurses/discordance/ruin. Nurse‚Äôs is an incredible perk too. I would just say if you ever unlock legion, it‚Äôs definitely a perk worth giving a shot in any build. I really think it helped me hit rank 1 (with primarily Freddy, yes Freddy) more than anything else.
---
Shoot, looks more like Julie. Probably why Frank is crying so much.
---
Maybe he should play survivor and not a killer if his internet is bad. It ruins the experience for everyone because they are the host
---
I'd give the hatch aura a timer of like 5-7secs to balance it so a stealth pro (like myself) can't just finesse their way to the hatch. Give the killer a bit more of a chance. Other than that, I think the devs should really consider this character. Great work~
---
Why tf are you running bamboozle on huntress 
---
This is amazing. Thank you for your art üíô
---
That is patently untrue. Even if it didn't provide bloodpoints, it would still be one of the strongest killer perks. Even if it only revealed one survivor after a hook, it would *still* be good just because the information it provides is so valuable. It's also healthy for the game due to the fact that it discourages camping and tunneling.
---
Wut?
---
I mean, body parts can't say no, right? */s*
---
Sounds like murder
---
The whole match was a disastrous camping affair for me, but fortunately the killer was nice in the end to the guy who really needed the coins. PSA: Claps are for Camping. Was the pallet thing a lag or i-frames (temporary invulnerability state during an animation) thing?
---
Legit every map I find (Without perk assistance) is a Rainbow map. It's not that bad since you have more room for addons since it tracks anything you find.

You should keep making more videos like this one!
---
I don't see how that could be super unfun to play against if it affected everyone including in death. It's unlikely you'll keep everyone injured all the time, and if anyone is not injured you get 8 gen repair/2 healing seconds of extra time or less... so basically no affect at all, considering fucking up a skill check adds 5 seconds by itself. It's all mental - THE BAR IS RED IT'S MOVING SO FREAKING SLOW I GOTTA GET RID OF IT!!!!!!!!
---
Underrated comment
---
Yeah except the ping is displayed in the lobby so they have a whole 55 seconds to bail when they see it's high
---
XD why is huntress and wraith on the same level wth 
---
Thanks! glad you like it!
---
What? Nurse is C-tier without add-ons??? Huntress is F-tier??? Don't tell me it's a tier list for PC.
---
Please change flair to shitpost
---
Dude, possible empty folders on a troll tweet are meaningless, I'm sure they have thrown around a lot of ideas, whether or not they eventually appear is another thing entirely. My favorite Spaghet monster might be one of those, but he and I will only meat in my drams.
---
Have you ever needed to explain to one of your friends what a killer does? Well with this tier list you can know ahead of time how hard it will be to explain to your friend the details of each killer!
---
Useful huh?
---
I was dying laughing trying to do anything, two of us ended up escaping and we all had a good laugh in post game chat!
---
Ok, I feel you. I'm a killer main. 
---
But I swear is there a teleporting hack for killers? Because this one time I played survivor and I was at Myers' neighborhood level, and you know how the houses are setup with one main staircase leading to the second floor, and a loop up there and whatnot. 
---
I was chased by the killer to the house. I ran up the stairs ready to jump out of the window. I NEVER took my eyes off the main staircase, (the only way to the 2nd floor, right??) I saw his red stain at the bottom of the stairs but he left the house. Next thing I know, I'm heading towards the stairs to go back down and the killer is RIGHT BEHIND ME. I was like???? Did he come through the window? How? 
---
Dont get it
---
I've actually done this before, but only because my internet was down lol. Survivors seemed to be playing just fine though and one actually made it out. I didn't see any lagging during Chases. Lucky them I guess 
---
The Pig's weapon is fucking large
---
Super balanced but just a little too boring to make a post about it tbh. Honestly if alert affected vaulting and locker opening as well it wouldnt even be that insane. Strong, sure but not insane. 
---
Max length is 100 meters or 326 feet for CAT-6.
---
I was so happy for rank reset, because I wanted to get some fresh killers that I haven't played against 100 times. But the I get teammates with urban evasion afraid to do gens. Jake, I died I can see you urban evading in the corner of the Game not looking for the totem or doing gens or anything useful. 
---
The best part is where Busta Rhymes scolds him and calls him a stupid motherfucker and Michael just walks away.
---
This is actually hilariously true. 
---
Well considering this game was not made in 2019 and now that it is 2019 they are implementing them. 
---
Ohhhhhh
---
It makes the game even more of a m1 simulator, no one wants that. 
---
If they live on the other side of the world and did not leave with a high ping killer it's on them as there is a ping indicator. When it shows a good ping but then when you start loading into the game it changes its on the killer.
---
I‚Äôm definitely not ‚Äòagainst‚Äô it. Just trying to see how it would make sense. Granted, no, not all perks make sense, not even by a long shot. 
---
Alert makes sense because you see the killer when he breaks something, as that would create a noise and it‚Äôs like echolocation in a way. 
---
The only problem I see with this perk is that using it ALONG with Alert means you‚Äôll always know exactly what the killer is doing in a chase even if you go out of sight for a moment. You‚Äôll know if he is or isn‚Äôt vaulting as WELL as breaking, and you‚Äôll know for a moment which direction he‚Äôs going in so you can counter 
---
As a survivor, I‚Äôd love that ability idea, but it would also make it wayyyyyy tough for killers. Maybe one like this would have a cooldown, or doesn‚Äôt work within a certain range. *shrug*
---
Guessing this is based on how powerful the killer is combined with how much effort it takes to play. Obviously Huntress requires good aim and Wraith without addons is pretty hard against good players.
---
how big is it supposed to be 
---
Amanda because she wears shoes and get are disgusting. Sorry op
---
Yeah well this post doesn't need you telling everyone someone killed themselves does it? It's a lighthearted post and you're going on about how your friend killed themselves and it ruins the mood. How about you just keep it to yourself? Nobody cares lmao. 
---
Daddy Myers and mommy huntress 
---
Really wish it were the Nurse and Doc...
---
Cannibal: Is able to charge up a chainsaw attack where after activation the Cannibal will move forward in a side to side chainsaw sprint. This sprint only lasts for a short time. While in this sprint if the Cannibal hits a pallet they will end the sprint and break the pallet, if they hit any survivor they will instantly down them, and if they hit an object they will have a tantrum where they frantically swing their chainsaw around in place. The tantrum can still down survivors. While charging the chainsaw the Cannibal will suffer a movement speed penalty. After the sprint the cannibal will be unable to interact and will move slightly slower for a short while.
---
I do deliverance nowadays. It has come in soon clutch when it works it really is awesome. Off the hook straight to the hatch one game with a camping LF! 
---
He creeps
---
He zaps
---
He vaults
---
He sleeps
---
He pirouettes (does a delicate dance with a chainsaw)
---
She ghosts
---
She kidnaps
---
She traps
---
He sprints
---
She blinks
---
He bear-traps
---
Puke face
---
He predators
---
She lumberjacks (yes, she can!)
---
&gt;P3 Legion
---
You disgust me.
---
I‚Äôd just prefer a rework of his power at this point tbh. He basically nurse for people who suck at playing nurse, but extra annoying because you spend most of the game in a mending state. 
---
Lol I don't even know how to lag switch üòÇ but I've definitely been accused of it! When are we getting those dedicated servers.
---
Tell me your secrets, I must know.
---
I wish they had done a three or hell even 6 coin to just get pig as a killer if you didnt have her already. rather than the cosmetic for huntress 
---
It's called freedom of speech. Also yeah, great advice to tell strangers to shut up about their dead friends. You should be a therapist.
---
Finally someone who gets it!
---
THANATOPHOBIA IS BAD EVEN ON LEGION. 
---
An extra 4ish seconds per gen is not worth a perk slot. 
---
And to those who say ‚Äúit deters healing‚Äù. That is false. Survivors who are injured and see thanat debuf will WANT to heal, to remove the debuf. 
---
How is hag so high? You put down a trap and when someone trips it, you teleport to it
---
I personally prefer Hag x Bubba. I feel like that would work out alright.
---
I'm sure it's coming.
---
Hag or spirit
---
dwight wishes he could have a body like that 
---
Invisible killers are nutty. 
---
Off topic, should I pick up m &amp; a from the shrine?
---
1875
---
No you don't get it, it's larger. 
---
He looks like someone tried to sculpt the real Quentin out of melty ice cream. 
---
&gt; Are you allowed to just get in game and dc for 2 pip loss? 
---
No, and you can get banned for doing this. First offense, 1 week, then 2, then 3, then 4, finally perm.
---
You can either run Wraith and hide in a corner watching Netflix, or play Bubba in basement with Insidious and protect your chest. Both are pretty easy to depip.
---
It‚Äôs the only item that generates a ton of points just for walking around. Can be used to find hatch, totems, gates, anything
---
Thanks I'm not here to be a therapist though. I'm just saying you don't need to tell everyone your friend killed themselves on a lighthearted post joking about the term 'kill yourself'. Go take it somewhere else. 
---
/u/DetectiveCookieh
---
What happens when you run out of traps, the illusion that appears startling survivors, and the movement speed nerf after coming out of the trap. Barely placing her at B tier.
---
She isn't really high. All the killers on her tier have relatively simple powers to explain. 
---
Haha, Button is **actually** terrible. Not only is it not useful, it actually *hinders* you by making you think people are nearby. I ran it once and never again.
---
I will try this out tonight!! Thanks 
---
She definitely could have downed me a few times! 
---
I've had mixed results with Kindred. I still get left into 2nd state at purple ranks. I think a lot of solo players just lack game awareness, honestly. When teammates actually utilize Kindred, it works wonders though.
---
No YOU don't get it.  The point is that the weapon is big
---
Where did the kids go, Sharp Hand Joe?
---
Legion is legitimately the first killer I wouldnt mind if they just completely removed them from the game. Awful design. Awful power. Poor conception all around. 
---
13-7 are the worst ranks, easily. I've encountered very little salt at rank 1 and 2
---
you just need to kill all 4
---
Really appreciate being part of a meme, thank you! :D
---
Would‚Äôve loved if you could credit me for the cosplay pic in the corner, thank you so much c:

(Ps. Dat adorable little Amanda in the dress in the other corner is based of my Mama ‚ÄòManda cosplay that egyptianweeb drew on insta :3 )
---
THIS THREAD IS FUNNY AS FUCK, BUT LET ME THROW MY TWO CENTS IN HERE
---
I FUCKIN HATE IT WHEN KILLERS CAN SMACK ME WHEN IM LITERALLY 3+ FEET AWAY FROM THEM! LIKE WTF MAN I WAS NOWHERE NEAR YOUR BITCH ASS
---
I played (tried to anyway) an 1100 ping game last night, it was absolutely insane. I've NEVER seen ping that high. It was partially my fault üòÇ i guess both the killer and I have garbage internet
---
LOADING SCREEN FREEZE? APPARENTLY THIS GAME HAS ISSUES WITH OVERLAYS. I USED TO FREEZE ON LOADING SCREEN OFTEN AS A KILLER, BUT SINCE I DISABLED STEAM OVERLAY (AND MADE SURE NOT TO HAVE DISCORD OVERLAY ENABLED AS WELL), IT HASN'T HAPPENED SINCE. IT WOULD BE WORTH TRYING IF THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE FOR YOU.
---
He's saying this is the straw that broke the camels hook. 
---
I feel you deeply on this one, got to rank 3 playing him the way he's meant to be played but its been a struggle. I love their design and aesthetic not to mention their playstyle is hella fun but god theyre so much more work than every other killer I wanna main them but it feels awful when you're up against people that know how to abuse you. 
---
Upvote cause happens too often, and cause J cole
---
I love myself Phantom of the Opera references
---
So sorry for your loss
---
PLAY SPIRIT. STAND STILL AND WATCH THE SURVIVOR RUN PAST YOU OUT OF THE CORNER OF YOUR EYE. GRAB THEM AS THEY UNHOOK. PROFIT. 
---
Those damn survivors...always breaking my goddamn hooks
---
Yeah, the killer ones are a lot harder. You don't need to double pip though, it's enough to kill/sacrifice all four. I don't play with Mori's but that should make it easier, some people here confirmed for me that killing is enough and from my own experience even DCs count as kills toward the achievements. Now is probably a good time to try since the rank reset was today. In my experience on PS4, sooner or later you'll come up against 4 survivors who are not playing very well, no matter at what rank you are. With Myers you can pretty much just ignore Dying Light and play with the other two to get their benefits. I found him to be one of the easier ones because a well timed Tier 3 with altruistic survivors can do some serious damage regardless of perks. Good luck. :)
---
I mean its hard but they are achievements, every player has to get them for each character. I stopped caring about the killer ones, only way is at rank 20
---
that's not complicated at all lmao
---
Isn't that solo already
---
i got all 9 coins like 3 days ago... rip my life

If your wifi is bad, don't host the game? 
---
It affects the people connecting to you which is inconsiderate tbh.
---
Wait until dedicated servers in the summer
---
Thats not true, I've had games where I killed all 4, but didn't get a merciless victory, so I didn't get the achievment and I've had games where 1 escaped and I still got the adept achievment
---
Also, if you only need to kill all 4, it's still way harder than the survivor one since a draw is when 2 survivors die and 2 escape. With a draw, there is already a 50% chance for the survivor to get the achievment, but a near 0% chance for the killer to get it.
---
Not only that, but killing 3 survivors, wich is seen as a victory, still doesn't guarantee you the achievment, but again, 25% chance that you were the survivor that escaped in that match
---
Thanks to that SNL skit I know how to pronounce that word lol
---
If only we had a way to stop them from doing that. 
---
No problem ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I agree they should be hard. I didn't say killer achievments should become easier, I said that survivor achievments should have been harder
---
It's a bad map for a lot of killers :(
---
Don't let that stop your fanfic or whatever though! If you want Pharah and Mercy to smooch I won't stop you!
---
Yeah so "pretty much" exactly the opposite of what the guy you replied to said. Nobody tells this guy he's a pathetic loser who shouldn't even be finding an injured survivor near a hook unless he's a scumbag camping patrolling POS, let alone not going for the weaker one because maybe you don't have a soul made out of fuckign worms crawling through shit, but "pretty much agreer with that guy who's a total asshole ven though I'm not" really sets the tone of this subreddit.
---
How? My killer lobbies take upwards of 10 min but surv take several seconds
---
Insta-bought Wraiths. I love him.
---
haha, cool, I'll have to look that up, gotta love SNL! Thanks!
---
As far as I know, you need the double pip, the achievment says as much. Usually when you kill 4 people, you do get a double pip, but I've also gotten the achievment on trapper with only 3 kills
---
The haunting is much harder the Freddy‚Äôs power because you have to understand how to mindgame.
---
no, he was dead in the first one, when SACRIFICE was released, he was cannonically dead.
---
How is Buba in the same tier as Amy and Rin? He just swings his saw and yeets everyone to the ground
---
But did you get it??
---
I have this and still get lagged games. I blame Century Link. Garbage company.
---
Nice.
---
I like this.
---
People hate legion because theyre bad and having a hard time learning the new killer

SITUATIONS LIKE THAT SUCK, BUT FARMING FEELS LIKE A WASTE OF MY TIME JUST AS MUCH AS WAITING FOR A 10 MINUTE LOADING SCREEN. ID RATHER JUST CONSIDER IT A SCUFFED GAME AND MOVE ON
---
Her brown clothes w/ dreads are much better camo tbh...
---
Why do this has not upvotes?
---
I mean, recently I found the person who got unhooked crouching behind a wall when I came back to the hook because I heard their injured groaning before anything else, but ok. 
---
Also, did you make a burner account to just reply to my post, or just to post this without risking karma? C'mon pal. That's a little silly. 
---
Why, devs? Why!?
---
I did, just in time! Brought BNPs, Claudette and party streamers to the last 2 matches to tip it in my favor. üòÇ
---
Meta
---
LMFAO i reverse dbd?? Tbh that actually sounds like a lot of fun. Like you gotta run around and sabotage shit before he could get to them and use it on himself
---
IF neither of us popped the generator,  we know it was one of the randoms. If one random or my friend is on the hook,  and I do not save them that means the random did. üòÇ Trust me, I pay attention to who does what on my team. 
---
Yeah, because that's how humans solve stuff. And I'm pretty sure people do care, at least those who have empathy like all humans should have. Yes your freedom of speech protects your right to be a douchebag, that doesn't mean you have to take any chance you get at being an edgy troll.
---
Also it's always interesting to see people like you reinforcing the correlation between online harassment and mental health. No surprise the suicide rates these days are higher than ever. Congratulations on being part of the problem. If a loved one of yours ever does take their own life, I'm sure there will be many loving, caring strangers telling you to shut up and that no one cares. Because that's what people do, right? Probably part of the healing process
---
How is it nerfing feral frenzy?

ENTITY TOOK PRAYER BEADS AND TWO SURVIVOR PUDDINGS AWAY IN A BLOODWEB. IVE NEVER FELT SO HURT BEFORE
---
Also the fact that I am having to argue someone over how I go about dealing with this tragedy says a lot about your character.
---
Man you camped the fuck out of that hook
---
You said from the first instance but you can‚Äôt see much at the start of the video. Can you give a time stamp for the best view?
---
The suicide rates would plummet
---
Why would borrowed time be there
---
I swear that that's exactly what I also did. Except a red envelope since I didn't want everyone else to fight for lanterns. Last game turned out to have FOUR envelope offerings. Lol I still got camped but hey, I got my coin!! Congrats to us hahaha
---
Nea is the worst killer, she can‚Äôt even hit survivors and she can repair gens, that‚Äôs the opposite of what a killer should do
---
If someone‚Äôs having fun, is it really a game of Dead by Daylight? 
---
The killer radius should just pause the timer. I know chase already does that but any heartbeat really should.
---
You are literally seeking sympathy otherwise you wouldn't have commented in the first place
---
Play whatever you enjoy is all I can say. Play around with all the killers you can and go from there. 
---
My two faves are Wraith and Huntress. I don't use the coxcomb because i want my prey to know I'm coming for them, and the hums help me relax to better get those sweet headshots. 
---
Pig should definitely rank higher.  She effectively has 2 completely separate abilities and they both have a bunch of little nuances that you MUST know or WILL die (if your trap is on you can‚Äôt leave through the exit gate but you can leave through the gate, your trap‚Äôs timer is paused while in a chase, downed, or on a hook but doesn‚Äôt pause while you are healing, getting healed, or checking boxes, while crouched Pig moves slightly slower than a survivor‚Äôs maximum sprint speed but faster than their crouch speed and cannot perform normal attacks but she may still break objects and vault windows, etc).  Her powers have a shitload of rules and exceptions to those rules even without any addons and, having explained several of the killers to my brother who doesn‚Äôt play this game but likes to watch me play, she was the one who I had to answer the most mechanical questions about.
---
Am I the only one who looked at the bottom and thought, invisible and hatchets
---
Cuuuuute D:
---
Well I think that at least Feng player jumped in his chair a bit :D
---
Sometimes I get bored of "core gameplay" and I will stalked one gate to NOED survivor with Wraith at the moment he starts opening it. I know him hearing that DING DONG after chill game makes him uneasy at least or stalk with Insidious/NOED Nurse from outside of gates xD
---
I only got to 8 but i was super close to 9
---
Complete wrobg order of Text in thats meme.
---
You are literally retarded. I don't need to seek sympathy from strangers on Reddit. I have people for that. I commented in the first place because I was scrolling thru my feed and decided to say a little something in awareness of the real issue. How are you getting so blindsided?
---
With plunderers I get a rainbow map at least once every 7 games
---
"CAN YOU HEAR ME, SURVIVOR WITH THE THREE DCS?" (ACE COMBAT 7 REFERENCE) 
---
I did the same and I didn't receive the achievement the first time I tried to get it.
---
I'M ACTUALLY HAVING A REALLY GREAT DAY AFTER DE-RANKING! ALL OF MY GAMES HAVE BEEN SUPER FUN WITH NO TOXICITY. PLAYERS AND KILLERS ARE COMPLIMENTING AND ENCOURAGING EACH OTHER. IT'S VERY WHOLESOME.
---
Even with Ethernet my internet is garbo half the time. But I'm in a rural area and my ISP is Suddenlink so that probably has a huge effect on it.
---
1:48 and 3:52
---
At 3:52 you can see the others acting perfectly fine followed by the switcher not.
---
I HATE THIS CANON AND LORE UPDATE. I DO NOT SEE SENSE TO PLAY DBD NOW.
---
This relies on the assumption that the killer has the perk without actually being able to check. Regardless, walking in a different direction still shows the killer the general area where you are, hiding in a locker takes time, however small it may be, in which you aren't on a gen, hiding behind a gen does work, but again, the killer only needs to get *one* proc in order to get milage out of it.
---
No you don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs a tier list for fully explaining a killer‚Äôs power. They just need to explain how it works, not how to be really good with it
---
It'll be 16m, because M&amp;A increases terror radius while in a chase, so base 8 plus the extra 8.
---
Where the FUCK IS MY BBQ AND CHILI?
---
Once it finally comes out this sub will be like "FINALLY, SOME GOOD FUCKING FOOD!" 
---
my favorite part of that whole animation was the fuckin-  "me too-- ME TOO!"
---
I have no problem running from pig until I get a pallet stun. Then I want to stop running away. 
---
You are though and lmao I think others are gonna see you seeking sympathy actually. 
---
I don't know about stronger, but Mikey was part of the inspiration.
---
I'm not sure how? If you have any specific examples I'd be glad to hear them.
---
Get trapper and instead of trapping gennies trap pallets. I love surprising people. Last night i got 4k with trapper because i hooked one and the other 3 all got in traps. 
---
That is in your own control. It‚Äôs called getting better at the game. Stop bitching and practice since this game caters to rank 20s enough anyway
---
You as well! Idk if my survivor rank will be 1 but I‚Äôm hoping killer will!
---
I always thought crutches were something that helps new players, but holds you back overall, since eventually you'll want to get rid of them. DS is a crutch since it helps you escape after losing a chase, but you would have avoided losing the chase if you brought something else in that spot (Dead Hard, Sprint Burst, etc). NOED is a crutch because it requires the survivors to activate all the generators before it does anything, and you could have done better by running something like  Enduring or Bamboozle to win more chases or Sloppy Butcher or Ruin to slow the game down.
---
Smh ez dodge because you know you didn't read my comment right lmfao. Just go take your life shit elsewhere and not on a lighthearted post. 
---
...what exactly was their joke?
---
can‚Äôt be in chase if you grab them 
---
but you cant jump in this game
---
Wait no
---
SAME. THAT GRIND ITSELF BURNED ME OUT THEN HAVING THAT REALIZATION THAT AN EVEN BIGGER GRIND WAS AHEAD OF ME BURNED ME OUT ALL OVER AGAIN. I FEEL KINDA DUMB TOO CUZ I'LL EVEN HAVE LESS TIME TO PLAY THIS GAME IN THE NEXT MONTHS, AH WELL ON TO THE NEXT ONE
---
This is absolutely fantastic! Great job! I wish this was a real DLC, I'd buy it in a heartbeat! Definitely reccomend you show this to BHVR! Make your dreams a realityyy~

This actually excuses the vertical filming too.
---
(It also was a good answer. I didn't expect that.)
---
Killers are the host. If they have bad internet, it affects the match for everyone. If you know your internet is bad, why put others through it? 
---
Instead of downvoting me, you could look into getting a better ISP or (as I've already said) wait until the dedicated servers are up if you want to play killer.
---
Haha! Do you read what you write? Especially that last piece of advice, that's the kind of quality idea that people spend years working towards a psychology degree for. You are way ahead of all those squares! You really should consider becoming a therapist, comes with a nice salary
---
Here's how to fix the Legion. Just remove him from the game. He's boring af to play as killer and as survivor. 
---
Never would I have dreamed of such a crossover
---
Trapper requires the explanation of how to escape the traps, their interactions when the trapper steps in them, and that they can be disarmed or saboed. 
---
Clown throws bottles that explode into mist that blurs the screen and slows. He can charge them and doesn't slow down. That's it.

You did this wrong.   You are supposed to farm karma by posting them one link at a time as their own post.    Now someone unscrupulous individual (totally not me) can use an alt account and post them up.

I FUCKING KNOW! I WATCH THAT LIFE TOTAL JUST PETET AWAY WHEN I'VE RUN TO THE OTHER GODDAMN SIDE OF THE GLOBE!! WTF YOU MONSTERS, HELP YOUR FUCKING TEAMMATE. I'M THE ONE WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE BLOODTHIRSTY ONE YOU SOCIOPATHIC LIZARD TWATS!!
---
Freddy is totally fine though. I even wrote a pretty comprehensive guide about playing him, he can kick ass at any rank. 
---
Well, the second blind attempt wasn't exactly necessary.
---
I had a standoff at a pallet with a freddy because he knew that if he took the loop i would be able to unhook my teammate so it ended up being me beaconing him to follow me and he just kept shaking his head and looking at the ground. It was pretty funny. 
---
FILTHY RICH YOU MAD MAN
---
Yup, I‚Äôm a rank 1 P3 legion. And I‚Äôve never moonwalked, I also have 0 progress to that ‚Äòdown survs with feral frenzy‚Äô achievement. 
---
Those are both just inefficient methods to play
---
these new pig buffs are crazy
---
Oh, awesome! Thanks! Better spend them soon before I forget again. :) 
---
I do not think Mori works for the adept killer achievements. Just 4K on hook.
---
P.S.S. Where do I go to make a petition to for this skin?
---
Just wait, 3 games later it'll get worse
---
This makes me so angry. What an asshat! He messages you to talk shit knowing full well that his internet is awful and is willing to abuse it to get an advantage.  I can't stand people who talk shit when the know deep down that their success has nothing to do with their skill. 
---
I got to rank 12 in 5 days. I've never played the game before then. Once i got to twelve i kept deranking because survivors at level 12 are really good. 
---
well guess why P3 Claudette. She. Did. 
---
I don't really have a main, I play all killers equally. Also, I rather spend my good addons on some good/fun builds, so thats why I haven't gotten around to completing the adept achievments
---
I'm not really conplaining about the achievments being too hard, I wanted to point out that the survivor achievments are a joke compared to the killer ones
---
10/10 save. Reminds me of my friend who did the samething to me but with fire crackers. Somehow she hid in the closet and of course me and the killer didn't notice and all of a sudden I'm free. Shame I left her for dead afterwards.
---
Yes, I agree....pip with killer is way to easy. Even matches where i play like crap I still manage to pip somehow when my all logic I should depip.  I always find the post about not pippin from people amusing and a bit perplexing.
---
i don't think so, but what would the power be? i don't think pet AI would work so no SCP 049 stuff
---
I know Disconnects work for the achievment, I'll just check the wiki, should have factchecked before making this post
---
Alot of people derank, play with friends, or use second accounts. It makes the game really unfair to new players. 
---
As a killer, I'd recommend patrolling your generators to find people. Also play wraith sense he is the least mechanically difficult  killer to play as. He isnt goid st higher ranks, but he is fairly easy to learn the game mechanics on. 
---
As a survivor start with meg or claudette. Sprint burst is a great perk to run away from killers. Self care helps you heal yourself. While learning. Of you hear the heartbeat, hide. If the killer cant find you, he cant kill you. 
---
I'm sorry your game experience is hard right now, but I promise the game is alot of fun once you learn more of the mechanics. 
---
You need more upvotes.
---
who is amy?
---
I find Michael to be extremely easy to explain. He levels up and becomes stronger, but his 3rd level up only lasts a minute. Not that hard to explain. ALSO SHIRTLESS MICHAEL DAMN IT
---
Don't worry I'm now using Ethernet
---
Amanda
---
I fucking hate him so much lol
---
This is exactly why I bought Myers. I can't wait to start building him up to be a creeper with no terror radius. idc if I don't get 4k; I want them to be scared. 
---
&gt;level 1
---
I feel your pain
---
You're actually so right. Shame things won't work out so well for you though. Especially when you're bitching on a subreddit post smh. 
---
The idea that an OP killer is allowed to exist because bad ones are completely irrelevant confuses me. Bad Legions just walk around without using the ability, or use it at terrible times, but they dont get the same pass? Either theyre both bullshit or neither are, Im not going to give a grey area because one side gets dumpstered more often over the other. 
---
I think out if Franks tape, Legion is fine where he is in comparison to the payoff they get in chases. A good nurse can end a chase in about 15 seconds, and is guaranteed that down(at least in my games, I do not speak for newer players), Legion is also guaranteed a chase, but outside of the tape, it takes much longer. I just dont get the idea that you not being able to break a chase means theyre broken. 
---
You never truly can end a chase with a good killer, Legion just compounds your losing chase over time.  You see the wound meter go down with each stab, it feels like theres nothing you can do, but its just the same situation youre in with other killers, you just get to endure an extended chase with multiple hits instead. But youre still stalling just the same. Legion chases arent over instantly like other killers, which in my eyes is what makes or breaks balance here.

I‚Äôm still a fairly recent player to the game, but Hag never fails to make me jump. And playing against Myers and the Pig is always nerve wracking as well.
---
Hmm that's strange... I don't believe I've said 'shut up' even one single time...
---
Oh yes the survivor ones are simple. I would have preferred them to be harder. But that's just how it is with survivor. You could keep going in games and do nothing, wait for the other 3 to do all the gens. Sooner or later you'll get an escape. You can't rely on anyone else but yourself as killer.
---
As a killer the red ranks come way too easy and as a survivor I can barely make purple ranks :(
---
That window fake was pretty beautiful 
---
hahaha I'll post the new ones individually 
---
There are far fewer browns in a P3 web, and I do notice there is a chance of there being multiple ultra rare items. This ends up making the blood webs cost a ton. 
---
I P3'd Tapp because I like him a lot but dislike his lack of outfits. And trying to get all perks has been a massive chore. I end up playing my non prestiged characters more just because they have perks. 
---
If you are able to get BP quickly and you like the cosmetics, go for it. If you're already heavily invested into a character then I wouldn't. 
---
He shouldn‚Äôt be able to vault that window? What does that mean 
---
Expensive AF, but I mean shit that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre for... 
---
I find the 25ish ft cables are good enough most of the time. You must have a big ass apartment my dude 
---
There is no denying that the killer is less fucked by high ping games but they still get fucked.
---
Yes I'm sure I had a disconnect or two while doing the adepts and got the achievements.
---
Don't get me wrong, I get stressed playing killer too hahaha it's just that I often try to get myself in the "I could've done something better there, a better player could've won" mindset instead of blaming the game or the conditions (except bad maps, some maps just suck tbh), which may just be more damaging to my self esteem sometimes, but it keeps my opinions more objective, I guess (sometimes hahaha).
---
And in the case of your match, I would've just gotten Tier 2 as fast as possible and slugged. If they were playing that cocky, I'm sure a decently placed Tier 3 could easily end the match, or atleast apply crazy pressure. But I can understand if even that experience of survivors not really giving a fuck is what makes you annoyed, which is ok, but that's just how online games are sometimes.
---
SWF just being cocky and playing like that is not what really pisses me off, it's when they play immersed and seem to just want to get the gens done as quickly as possible, and even when you get into a chase with someone, they're not bad to be playing immersed and will abuse any broken building or window set up. That's when I'm like: "ok, you guys play like that, but I'm sure if I tunneled anyone you're gonna act like I'm a monster". But those teams are so rare that I don't really mind.
---
I find Spinechill to be a trap talent. It makes you play too scared. Every time it triggers you'll be hiding, whereas probably half the time the killer isn't even going to chase you. 
---
I like to play stealthily, but I find a build that focuses less on avoiding the killer and more on losing them works better. 
---
I use Urban Evasion, Lightweight, Quick and Quiet, and Iron Will. 
---
That way you can get more work done. It also wastes a ton of the killers time when they chase you only to lose you.
---
I stopped playing for about six months after the summer BBQ event and I think it has something to with it.  Your comment is very telling in how much this event was garbage. 
---
But you asked if I could say anything other than that when I never even said those exact words so I'm pretty sure you're the one who isn't aware of what they're writing. This is the second time you've stated something incorrect, can we make it a third?

Thank you very much for the enthusiastic comment. I have also posted this concept on the DbD Fan Creations forums, but it didn't get much attention there. I really hope BHVR reads this and likes it enough to contact me about implementing it in the game. Really that's all I want + credit for the idea, Like a name drop or something. Maybe if they do a Fan Creation Contest, with "your killer idea in the game!" as the reward, this one could have a chance.  I'm glad you enjoyed it, and honestly didn't know anyone else was reading it still since i submitted it before spirit came out. Your comment reminded me of why I submit these ideas, and made my day.

FUCK-TOILETS THATS GOT ME ROLLING!
---
Bro, I've legit seen people write gay fan-fic of the Columbine shooters.
---
The internet isn't afraid of anything. 
---
Y'know, that makes more sense. I have 2 or 3 so far, but I just thought it was bugged. Can you down anyone so long as you have two survivors affected? Do you need to down them via bleed out or can you hit them?
---
Happened to me with Feng a while back. I just closed the game and reopened and it was fine. 
---
I think this tier list deserves to be on the tier list
---
Object of obsession is a survivor perk 4head

Woah that looks really cool

I've only played against one clown. The same person twice. And all they did was chase us and throw bottles, never hit anyone either round. :-P

YAH THE LAST 2 DAYS, THIS HAS BEEN BAD I HAD THE SAME KILLER DO THIS 3 TIMES IN A ROW LAST NIGHT ON PS4, I REPORTED HIM BUT HE WOULD WAIT 30SEC TO A MIN AND THEN DC! I QUIT BRINGING ANYTHING IN FUCK THESE KILLERS ON PS4 THEY ARE ALL TRASH! RANK 1-6 KILLERS!
---
Lol, congrats man!
---
Maybe you can‚Äôt, but this bill certainly can.
---
Im usually a Myers/Hag main; I‚Äôm trying to level her up but this is what the bloodweb gave me :(

Huntress is BAE!

Just practice lol.  You have to get better at predicting where people will go and it still can be challenging because people play differently against nurse.

I'll sign any petition that also demands Bob Ross cosmetics for the Trapper &amp; Doctor. They get the wig AND weapons that are large paint brushes. 
---
I'd sooner be groped by a 1000 maniacs and give birth to their collective child than go near that thing.
---
I'm not bothering to argue because i've seen people like you before. I could give you 100 reasons why Hag is one of the best killers in the game but you'll cling to your *muh 110% bed killer* and never let go. I'm not arguing with someone like that, because theres no way to win.
---
Nope. That got fixed.
---
why the fuck is this a thing HHHHH
---
ANSWER THEN
---
I played three games and got three messages complaining about me lag switching. Figured it was best for me to just not finish the event. Ended with 6 coins, which is all i needed anyways.
---
After making survivor 1 enter the deep wound state you specifically have to down survivor 2 through deepwound who you already put into deepwound from a different frenzy.
---
So to play it out, you deep wound survivor 2 and leave. Your power charges back up again you do another frenzy and deepwound survivor 1, and find survivor 2 healing up, so in the same frenzy you return to survivor 2 and hit them, causing them to go down.  
---
Hope that clears it up a bit? Sorry, it's a little hard to explain.
---
The tier list of all DBD tier lists or the tier list of all DBD tier lists excluding serious tier lists?
---
Hitting a survivor should result in the killer being arrested.
---
That shit's illegal.
---
This mode only appears for Legion mains.
---
Thanatophobia means fear of dying, not fear of the dead, so it *kind of* makes sense. Necrophobia is the fear of the dead. But yeah, Thana needs a buff so that dead Survivors work, too.

Wut does frank look like
---
The Huntress will obviously win, have you seen those legs?
---
Why don't you just deal with not getting 3 or 4 kills every game and just allow yourself the chance to get better by playing more skilled players? Rather than de-ranking just so you can win win win?
---
Playing killer rewards great BP whether you get zero kills or 4 kills. Stop being a baby.
---
And you do not NEED certain perks. Try playing with no perks for a while instead. Challenge yourself and have some patience.
---
Look up "Lightburn". You're welcome.
---
You are a killer so keep on killing
---
I'd much prefer it if it was removed altogether with injured perks/after 30 seconds or so, I'd use resilience a lot more if I didn't have to listen to the music for half the game unable to hear anything 
---
I rather get no clues with pride than knowing the fact that I didn‚Äôt deserve the kill and they might have been innocent and didn‚Äôt deserve what happened to them.
---
Sorry about your loss bud. They're in a better place
---
"Jesus Christ, what did that Survivor eat?!?! Owww!"
---
Well you mostly just pray for BHVR to add it.

Doc, c‚Äômon man!

                                     -scout, tf2 
---
I got ya. Good info. I guess I know how I'll be playing as Legion next time. 
---
Oink Oink
---
The only bells I will be dinging is the ones at CHURCH
---
How much is it again?
---
You didn‚Äôt even mention the Void. The Void is where survivors (maybe killers idk) go when they have fully lost hope, a hollow shell of what they once were.
---
if i ever play killer, and some asshole comes up trying to sacrifice their teammates, i will tunnel that cunt so hard their head will have a permanant hole in it.
---
I picked up Bloodhound on Legion and definitely do not regret it.  I don't need an exploit to keep the pressure on.
---
Lol I like to be a friendly killer sometimes too. Just get some points and help some peeps out by having a relaxing game.
---
Garlic knots. Wings. Refried beans. Beer. Cheeseburger. Beer. Spicy nachos. Extra cheese. 
---
And beer. 
---
D a r n
---
I have 400 hours and I'm basically still in the womb as a fetus.
---
If you down someone you deserve the kill. It's their fault they didn't know where hatch is/didn't get there in time 
---
That's the thing though. I use bloodhound to back up and "break" the chase and simply look at the ground if I can't figure out where to go. The perk simply enables this shoddy tactic
---
But they both knew. Claudette would have survived without Nea but in a dickish way. Idc about kills. I prefer moral high ground but I just don‚Äôt t know what was the right thing to do.
---
&gt; They can leave the match ASAP (dc or suicide on hook) and start another match instantly and get points there.
---
Or and here is an idea, the KILLER can DC too and save EVERYONE the time. 
---
Them hosting is going to do nothing when my internet is being horrible. 
---
spot on
---
I am aware mate, this game is 3 year old and dedicated servers are about 6 months away, which is still a super long time. Player hosted matches are probably the worst way to experience any game.
---
Please and thank you. I don‚Äôt need the chorus of drums in my ear, especially when I‚Äôm not in chase. 
---
You don‚Äôt speak for everyone, just saying.
---
By far the best add on in the entire game, it turns myers into an almost entirely different killer who can jump scare the fuck outa everyone!
---
Put me in that Rin pool pls.
---
escape plan, ds, and then your pick for two other cancerous perks! \*become a cunt for only 3000 iridecent gems!\*
---
For gameplay, definitely Spirit. For perks, I'd go with Clown.
---
Read the people‚Äôs names. This guy asked a simple question. Downvote the other guy.
---
Breaking out the fresh memes!
---
MY EYES, IT HURST!
---
There are so many nurses that don't know how to blink, I have countless games that you loop for all 5 gens. Find a nurse who can tho, F
---
I feel that safety pips should be removed or make it harder to get at red ranks. Most of the time i play killer without add-ons and i get to rank 1
---
reminds me of that key and peele episode
---
Nothing will ever beat ‚Äúmy dad works for Microsoft you‚Äôre getting banned‚Äù
---
Wow that's the best leak so far 
---
Good to know 
---
just had a legion game where the exit gates were open, but he was camping laurie. jeff and i kept running towards her and then away when he started chasing after us, going back and forth to try and distract him but he always kept going back to her. eventually jeff died for her and then they had a hatch stand off. sad. : (
---
Who is this?
---
Nothings more spooky than when you‚Äôre playing with a rank 20 friend who just got the game and the killer runs the loop perfectly. It was at that moment I realized running no perks or items might not end well. 
---
YOU KNOW WHAT, IM GOING TO BE THE ONE TO SAY IT, FUCK YOU BEHAVIOUR FOR THAT GOD AWFUL EVENT, 100 GAMES MINIMUM TO COMPLETE JUST TO GET THREE COSMETIC SETS? 
---
DID YOU DECIDE THAT INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY PUTTING EFFORT INTO NEW COSMETICS THIS EVENT YOUD JUST MAKE A SHIT GRINDY EVENT THAT MAKES KILLERS LOOK LIKE ASSHOLES FOR SIMPLY PLAYING THE GAME?
---
AND OF COURSE YOU WOULD RELEASE TWO REALLY NICE LOOKING COSMETICS THE DAY THE EVENT ENDS THAT ARE CELLS ONLY, I DON'T EVEN WANT THEM BUT FUCK ME YOU WOULD THINK THIS WAS A FREE TO PLAY GAME.
---
Greatly reduce the skill check success zones and increase the miss check penalty and this could work.
---
Because it's part of today's rotation. There are a few select realms it'll choose from and both these maps are standalones so the chance is higher, I guess?
---
It's pretty unoriginal though. I would rather they make killers like the Huntress. She's well thought out and original.
---
Oh okay, that makes sense
---
So I can have fun playing without having to derank. Also if it didn‚Äôt reset literally everyone would be at rank 1
---
High rank in general*
---
Maybe an alternate costume for nurse or doc.
---
Clown also has a limited amount of bottles that once he throws he has to reload by fully holding down the reload button, and releasing too early will cancel the reload. During the reload he hasn‚Äôt reduced movement speed and can‚Äôt attack survivors. His bottles also make survivors scream and give a visual notification to the survivor‚Äôs location upon the survivor entering the gas radius. Survivors are also unable to fast vault when inflicted with the ‚Äúintoxicated‚Äù effect, which is the effect applied when the survivor is effected by the gas field. The ‚Äúintoxicated‚Äù effect last several seconds after exiting the gas field, and the Clown himself can‚Äôt be effected by the gas field that spawns from his bottles.
---
Where'd you get this from? I thought Survivors turn into Killers when they lose all hope like that, and killers turn into Survivors.
---
Nah there‚Äôs an invisible wall. Sometimes the brick doesn‚Äôt even load in but you can‚Äôt run out
---
Look it up. That‚Äôs not how it works at all.
---
"What better laboratory than the blood-soaked battlefield?"
---
[D A R N](/intensifies)
---
I know I'm host as killer, it was just unusual to get messaged that
---
It would be nice if they try to put fear in actual death. To punish having dead teammates more than injuries ones. So you will run to heal yourself as soon as possible to avoid death.
---
Oh no not my address!!
---
The description makes Frank's perks sound like they would be fun,gimmicky perks that can have a huge payoff. Got any ideas as to how they would act?
---
Or the literally hours of clips of people clearly not getting hit and then going down?
---
The obvious fix for this is to halt the deep wounds timer when mending. Killer wants to drop back and lose the chase? No biggie, just stop where you are and start mending.
---
Would lose the ability to corner camp people though, which I kind of liked. Like if they run into an area of the map where they can't go anywhere else without running by you (e.g. the exit gate areas on the Game), you just stare them down while they bleed a bit and then restart the chase when they're one-shottable. Feels like more pressure on survivors to be smarter about pathing, which is a breath of fresh air.
---
I did look it up, that's how I got that information. It was either from a dev stream or the wiki. Where did you get yours?
---
Legion doesn‚Äôt need a nerf, he needs a rework. No matter how bad he is he‚Äôll be cancer to play against because of his power 
---
P3 Claudette. P3 Claudette was number third in the voting.
---
Multiple different websites. It may have been an early concept or idea. Idk.
---
Happend to me a couple of days ago. I was so paniced because i had just bought all the dlc and did not want to loose it.
---
I need to do this, Im exhausted from getting hate messages from both killers and survivors.  This game has the most toxic playerbase I've ever seen. 
---
*heavy breathing intensifies*
---
Why not?
---
Something loopable?

So I found this (I don't take any responsibility for any viruses): https://xpexplorer.com/windows10_dpi_blurry_fix/ 
---
It will let you have 125% scaling outside the game. You will still have smalls icons but the bug will be gone. I use 125% outside of the game so this fix is useful to me. If you use 100% outside of the game then this fix won't do you any good.
---
I guess we have to wait till the devs implement some form of UI scaling.
---
What bugs me about these adepts is that DCs don't count for it. I think they should. It's not fair when a survivor will DC to deny you a full victory or a mori or whatever. They should count.
---
Basically, it‚Äôs dumb that if legion doesn‚Äôt have a stroke irl mid chase that you‚Äôre gonna go down no matter what 
---
Huh that's weird I haven't played The Game at all today
---
Jeez, I have to do that 25 times? Screw that
---
Huh. Well it‚Äôs whatevs. It‚Äôs not game breaking... just slightly frustrating on top of reset. 
---
What's worse is when it happens while you're running Kindred. You can give your team the benefit of the doubt if no one is running aura perks, but when you know they know where everyone is while you're on the hook but no one comes for you? Sux
---
Pretty sure they actually do count
---
The Neas are loose again.

Mad Grit: It takes four attacks to down you. But when you are downed, you are *broken* for the rest of the match.

*It all hurts the same, y'know?*

---
Imagine getting rejected by the Legion lol. Tiny knife looking ass.
---
This inspires me
---
I have no problem, just was curious
---
Playing jumpscare Myers in Lery's is the best. One of the funnest 4k's I've gotten.
---
Both my mains in one picture :)
---
 Mad Grit you pretty much nailed how I imagined it, wiggle out faster with a debuff.    
---
 For Discordance, I think it'd have to be changed pretty hard for it to work for survivors. My first though would be that generators hinder killer aura reading, but that'd be a pretty hard gen rush-y counter to bbq so dunno. Not entirely sure for this one!   
---
 Iron Maiden makes you enter lockers faster (similar to how killers open them faster), and similar to stated above I imagine opening them gives a killer stun. Maybe even keep the exposed status for exiting.   I didn't think super hard on the perks outside of general ideas of what I wanted for them, so anyone's guesses are as good as mine! :) 
---
I wanna see the guy‚Äôs faces. Who cares about Julie when you got edge lord Joey?
---
Well it's probably weekly instead of daily. I wasn't technically wrong - I mean, today's rotation would also be part of the one for the week, right? Either way, my bad. Unfortunately I'm not finding a source for how often it is. I am pretty sure it's weekly though.
---
Thanks but I‚Äôm uninstalling. This game is complete horseshit with the double standards for lobbies. I had yet again 5 matches in a row where I was the only one who repaired a generator and had to run for my life while everyone else did nothing or disconnected. I‚Äôm consistently getting over 5k points, sometimes 9k for a match while others are getting zero or a thousand. And sure enough when I went to play some killer matches, the survivors were expert navy seals 1, 2, 3 generators. 4, 5 bam. Then came the teabagging, pointing, refusing to leave. The survivors I play against are all getting well over 15k points compared to the couple thousand points that the survivors I have to play with earn of any. Must be nice to constantly get handed a great team. This game is pathetic and the players are toxic trash bye.

I understand that. However the more you play a map the better you'll learn it!
---
How do you do that?
---
You are right don‚Äôt worry. I understand that this game is addicting and people want to play it as much as possible but with that being said, how can u even play with a high ms? Kinda unplayable. Kinda pisses me off when I‚Äôm waiting for lobbies forever and I come across a 314 ms killer... people shouldn‚Äôt host games if u can‚Äôt handle the host. Instead of blaming a fellow player I‚Äôd rather blame the company for not giving us dedicated servers tbh.

Iron Maiden: While in a closet, the killer's aura is revealed to you. When you leave the closet, the killer receives a notification and your aura is revealed for 6 seconds.   
---
*They're coffins. Don't you get it? But they're *our* coffins.*

Discordance: Every time you perform a cooperative action, the killers aura is revealed for 1/2/3 seconds. Has a 60 second cooldown.

*Fuck him. We're all that matters.*

Wow they specifically stated on release that over time cash-only cosmetics would be purchasable with iridescent shards, thanks for being upset that the developers are trying make money S-Rorvik very cool!
---
If someone DCs during a mori it doesn't count for dailies and I am fairly certain that if they DC when you're playing tombstone Michael it won't give you the achievement.

He attac

No wait, he just attac

Charge and movement speed are always useful on her so they're worth what they are.

I posted something similar to this that was deleted even though it wasn't against the rules, the mods are just cancer
---
JESUS CHRIST WHAT THE FUCK
---
This is the single best thing I have ever seen on this sub! Would you kindly take my upvote?
---
Merciless in this case means killing all four survivors. (They haven't changed the terms since they changed to the emblem system, unfortunately.) Did you kill all four? If so, it might be bugged.
---
As for double XP... it's pretty much only when the devs want to do it. They don't like how it messes up the "bloodpoint economy". So there's no news on that. If they tell us there will be one it usually gets updated on the upcoming events sidebar here though.
---
according to someone on this stickied post a stream confirmed they are: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aq84e1/tragic_love_opera_collection_now_available_on_all/
---
What exactly that means isn‚Äôt super clear to me, to me it‚Äôs like saying someone in a soap opera is with someone else, I‚Äôm also unsure why people keep saying Reddit did this. I rarely see fan art of Wraith x Nurse (Wrurse? Naith? Sallip?) usually Wraith x Hag (Wrag? Shojomo?) but maybe I‚Äôm not lurking the right subreddits.
---
This is basically me. I always get berated on end chat accusing me of lag switching even though I turned off wireless and shut down all other programs that eat the network. This is why we need dedicated servers and I'll be able to play killer again.

upvoting for the good vibes, man, keep it up

Yeah that sounds about right. It'd be nice if everyone just tried to learn the maps though.

It depends on what killer you play.
---
If the killer is very tall like Michael or Wraith it's easier to see through corn.
---
It‚Äôs a link to LMGTFY or ‚ÄúLet Me Google That For You‚Äù for ‚Äúhow to take a screenshot.‚Äù Maybe you could figure out that I did this quickly on my phone so I could collage it (without watermark) and get it out to everyone ASAP. I know how to take a screenshot and you‚Äôre welcome.
---
hahaha, nice
---
I find that it would be great if you had someone to work with you, keeps the killer from checking since they rely on finding gens to hope to start a chase.
---
This kind clears up the age old question of  "do the killers know of eachother's existence/do they interact?"
---
Shadowborn helps a ton 
---
Very interesting ideas. Discordance would lowkey be great early game if you had a partner with you.
---
I know that feel too well.
---
Also it seems like a lot of my Legion games...if 2 people are left, Legion always fucking downs both of them and leaves them to slowly bleed out or just go afk. Wtf 
---
Also great to know, cuz sometimes that was confusing me too since I didn‚Äôt see me or the rescuer with Borrowed Time. Double thanks!
---
Personally, I like the medical option. It gives me an alternative perk to run instead of self-care without dooming myself to having to solely rely on chest rng or my teammates help. Plus, it also just ties in with the perks lore from the movie. I'm not super for removing it entirely, but your option two isn't bad for people unlike me who just use it solely for chest search speed. 
---
cute
---
You don‚Äôt need Merciless for the Adepts. All you need to do is kill all four Survivors. I‚Äôve gotten multiple Killer adepts even though I only got a Ruthless because I killed all four Survivors. 
---
I didn't even notice that. It's great!
---
I use Devour Hope alone with Spirit. I've intentionally ignored them cleansing my totem so they think I have Haunted Grounds. One person even ran straight back to my totem after realizing their mistake lol. They don't realize what hit them and I get at least 2 moris and I've 4K'd twice with Devour Hope.
---
I got the game 'cause I got Legion. Now I mostly play them when I re-vs. a swf who thinks they're hot shit and tbag. Have fun with this mixtape, bitches!
---
The real question here: Whose eyes are that? They're greenish or blue, as far as I can tell. Dwight or David?
---
Both sides are sadly way too easy. I‚Äôd love a new rank system that really projects skill and not matches played. 
---
You can farm it pretty easily, despite what the achievement says, you don't need to hit 25 different survivors, maybe not the same survivor twice in a row, but you can do it between two survivors easily.
---
tetris 99 or dbd for the switch .............
---
hahahahaha
---
Dude I kept telling my friend that it should come out. FINALLY I CAN SHIT AND PLAY SHIRTLESS MICHAEL
---
Is this runs smoothly ill.never play it on ps4 again. Handheld will be amazing!
---
I think its one claw that's upside-down and twitching randomly at nothing during the survivor's struggle phase on the hook is dumb.
---
Gameplay wise yeah but graphics wise no
---
Neat! If I were there I‚Äôd definitely get one.
---
Yes plz! 
---
I think they did a pretty good job so far.
---
I was hard-stuck at rank 12.  Then I learned how the pipping system worked.  Rank 1 a week later.  I wasn't suddenly better - I just understood the system rather well.  Do you want to know more?
---
They should bring cross play now
---
fucking awful
---
the sub will be flooded with nintenyearolds crying about balance, about the awful 5-10 FPS, complaining about difficulty, complaining about everything
---
greedy greedy devs continue to try to screw every drop of money out of this game while completely giving up on bug fixing. 
---
Cross play plz
---
No no it's not that they're afraid of the dead, it's that they're afraid of dying, and having had a teammate die should logically have a permanent effect on the match. After all if a teammate dies your odds of survival drop, they don't rise, so removing a debuff makes no sense.
---
I‚Äôm an achievement hound with most games. I‚Äôm going to get Myers to P3-50 after I get Evil Incarnate because I actually like his bloody clothing and it‚Äôs the only other cosmetic set he has. I‚Äôm planning on prestiging all of the licensed Killers just so I can have another set of cosmetics for them. 
---
Topless Myers for smash
---
Dude don't try and bring facts to this sub lol
---
Mori counts. You just have to kill all four of them, it doesn't matter how you do it.
---
Yeah, I guess so. :/ 
---
I just don‚Äôt like the place. Rip me. I like the swampu chan map. She covers me in her loving weeds.

I would get the amibos and get dbd if my cousins didn‚Äôt lose my goddamn switch:/

"I don't like camping" is not relevant.

Well it makes sense, cause they‚Äôre just teens

Gl playing the nurse with JoyCons 
---
hahaha
---
Got fucking destroyed by survivors swf deranked people yesterday 
---
But we can‚Äôt get dedicated servers
---
Green Medkit heals faster than Self-Care and I believe you can heal 2 times.  With Botany Knowledge you can heal 3 times and for even faster.  Next time you run self-care try to keep a mental note of how many times you heal yourself, it won't be a lot and if it is a lot, then that's a huge chunk of time that could've went to the completion of a full generator.
---
Freddy's power: You're invisible, and can't touch anyone unless they're asleep, and you can put them to sleep. Your power slows them down by a significant margin when they're asleep, and you can see survivors' auras outside your terror radius. Boom, done. Not that hard.
---
Oh yes please!
---
* heavy breathing gets faster *
---
Bruh
---
Can't wait to play this at a smooth 15fps 
---
Freddy puts you to sleep which slows down actions like healing, repairing, sabotaging, and opening gates. He can track you from a certain distance away if you‚Äôre asleep, he isn‚Äôt always visible during the transition (I think that‚Äôs true without addons), and he can‚Äôt interact with you if you‚Äôre awake outside of putting you to sleep. The exception is if you‚Äôre in a locker in which case you‚Äôll automatically be put to sleep. You can only wake up from his power by missing a skill check (healing yourself/generators), having someone who isn‚Äôt asleep wake you up, activating adrenaline, being hooked, and being picked up off the ground (unbreakable, no mither, other survivors). 
---
Saying Freddy pushes a button is like saying spirit is wraith but faster and sees less. Remember it‚Äôs not about how good they are or anything, it‚Äôs describing how their power works
---
Crossplay

15 FPS on the go!
---
Good to know it works for adepts!

Welcome to the world of salt Switch players.

Let‚Äôs hope they get optimization for console before you have to suffer through it.

Is your killer running Hex: N.O.E.D.?
---
Learn the signs!:
---
* Below-average performance
---
* Not running Hex: Ruin (as killers other than The Hillbilly or The Nurse)
---
* Running Hex: Ruin as either The Hillbilly or The Nurse
---
* Rank 9 or worse
---
* Playing The Trapper, The Doctor, or The Nightmare
---
If your killer meets one or all of these criteria, you better cleanse those totems!
---
(This public awareness campaign funded by the Foundation to Unpower Crutch Killers N' No One Escapes Death)
---
Since this thread is a baby and I'm confused, can some people please clarify some things
---
First of, is switch as powerful or more powerful than xbox one, ps4, xbox one x or ps4 pro? Because if not that's going to take more optimization then what consoles have been getting. Second of, if switch is less powerful how is the system going to handle a game like dbd?
---
Crossplay PC Xbox Switch and I swear to god PlayStation you pretentious dicks, I wanna get in to games faster 
---
What about women?
---
It's for every killer. The conditions are the same - kill all 4 survivors. Back when the victory cube was a thing (and survivors just had to get 10k BP to pip) a merciless only popped when you killed all 4.
---
Why the hell would they port this to switch when it runs like shit on consoles and the devs don't even care? 
---
This will not go down well at all...they can't even optimise *decently* on Console and they think they'll do well on Switch? They're ridiculous.
---
Legit wondering how the game will even run considering how the Switch doesnt quite have Xbox or PS4 specs and even those consoles struggle with running the game at a stable framerate.
---
&gt;Legion's Lawyer
---
I don't think Legion needs a *rework* per say. I don't think their core concept is inherently flawed. Their addons do need a MASSIVE rework as that's easily the worst part of their entire kit. I've written my shpeal about baseline Feral Frenzy does less then baseline Carter's Spark.
---
Exploit needs a fix, Purple addons need nerfs, base ability needs buffs, and Legion actually needs a reason to break pallets.
---
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK ???!?!?

ugh is it gonna be a special ed. like xbox/ps4 of are we gonna have to buy everything like on pc for a cheaper price?

I think a biker Dwight is enough.

I think you mean Mobile Dead by Daylight
---
Removed - Please use the Megathread.
---
I wish that they had cross platform progression, that would be amazing
---
Yeah, but if one of my mates‚Äô life‚Äôs were taken by the hands of a killer in a freaking closed location whew I result to still be at, I would be definitely more scare than dying than before...
---
So I think it just should have work on dead survivors from scratch.
---
Uh the switch is nowhere near a one x, or a regular ps4. The switch isn't powerful at all. The game more than likely will run like trash on it.
---
Feng's pantsu plz
---
If the game runs like ass on the original Xbox and PS4 I have no idea how they are going to make this work.
---
Your upvote gives this idea the chance of being noticed by the devs, so I'll gladly accept it lol
---
I'm just being hopeful, I really hope the downscale in graphics help the fps.
---
lol they can't even make it run well on current gen consoles. 
---
Doesn't the Dark Souls remaster run at 30 FPS when it runs at 60 FPS on all other platforms? And it doesn't even have the updated effects?

Guess we'll see how this turns out.
---
In terms of raw performance, Switch&gt;Base Xbox&gt;PS4&gt;Xbox One S&gt;PS4 Pro&gt;Xbox One X.
---
So to answer, your question...
---
*OOF*
---
Dwight confirmed for smash
---
Make Your Choice and Nurse‚Äôs Calling are both great. When someone gets unhooked, you can zip over and down them both, especially if you‚Äôve got speed add-ons. One-shot the healthy survivor, and easily find the injured one. One hook becomes two and the snowball begins :)
---
Better than I could do I guarantee you
---
I had a nurse game recently where she was chasing a survivor (my buddy), and right as she downed him the first 3 generators popped almost in unison. It was absolutely brutal. 
---
Nintendo and Toxicity are not a good mix.
---
A dev said they'd like it to be canon, but it's not canon thus far.
---

---
If you wanna be an absolute legend, Become a Switch Nurse Main. Achieve a godlike status.
---
motion controls with the joycons ?
---
Still misses the flashlight save
---
I'm getting serious Phantom of the Opera vibes here.
---
720p 14.95 fps here I come!
---
It is less then the PS4 Basic let alone PS4 pro.
---
Whatever it runs on the PS4 Expect about 10 less frames on the switch at least.
---
It isn't. I'm probably going to get downvoted by Nintendo fanboys but the truth is it's not as powerful as ps4 or xbox one. 
---
Give us DBD amiboos!
---
No.
---
Me too bro, me too... 
---
This is going to be a trainwreck. Didn't the devs admit **on stream** that DBD would never run decently on a switch?
---
The game on switch looks like a kids drawing, **and I play on console**
---
Its being released late 2019. I have a feeling theres no way the P2P connections this game currently works on will work on Switch so this is probably going to be post dedicated servers.
---
Of course that still means Nintendo's dedicated servers so good fucking luck with your 300ms constant and 15 fps.
---
They will likely need dedicated servers up and running before this becomes a thing.  Both because of the way data is sent, and to make sure shenanigans arnt involved.
---
You forgot that if the timer reaches zero if you are in a jigsaw box it will not kill you until you find out if you successfully found your key.
---
So if you're out of time don't stop the box, its a hail mary.
---
There are already killers that can counter palates without completely ignoring them 
---
Facecamp simulator: mobile edition!
---
say what you will.. I‚Äôm buying this
---
The concern here is that, according to the notes, the Devs had tried a killer that can steal or otherwise look like a survivor. That killer was originally Legion
---
It wasn't fun. At least, again, according to the notes. Thus why the current Legion has his mini-billy powerset as opposed to the ability to swap identities.
---
My second concern is the ability to damage survivors while in 'shadow' mode. Is this a very visible creature roaming around, or is it invisible a la the Spirit? If the latter, I'm not a fan of being able to damage a survivor where they have no recourse and no chance of dodging or spotting the incoming danger. 
---
To the Spirit's credit, this was handled by having the survivors be invisible while you, too, are invisible. It made the swing a work of mind games and guess work.
---
The Wraith, of course, must come out of his spectral mode to bash.
---
Nah, ACE
---
"Just because you made something doesn't mean you made it."-You 2019
---
It's low effort but he still made it.
---
Id be hyped, but not when I hear how terrible console is treated.
---
BTW: Clown for Smash.
---
Does this mean we can get Ace in smash?
---
If it runs better on Switch and when it releases we still don't have console optimization I'm gonna cut Mcote's Mcotties with a rusty knife and feed them to a random street cat
---
But this isnt during a chase so it doesnt matter
---
Idk, if I had teammates dying left and right I‚Äôd be fraud I‚Äôm next.
---
another reason we need dedicated servers
---
You must be fun at parties
---
Id pay $1000 for an ace amibo
---
Why are playing on wifi wtf, get wired my dude
---
Just how mama used to make it...
---
:D sweet now i can play it while the tv is on
---
Servers? Sure.
---
Don‚Äôt get your hopes up with the optimization pass, this will look like shit and run like shit
---
Licensed Nintendo killer when? 
---
Waluigi next DLC killer confirmed.
---
Exactly. Classic mod power trip/karma whoring
---
I was making a comparison. It does matter.
---
remember when people said this game wasn't coming to switch... lol
---
&gt;Yeah well this post doesn't need you telling everyone someone killed themselves does it?
---
Yes it does
---
&gt;Nobody cares lmao.
---
No we do
---
I mean, I'd buy it and I never buy skins. 
---
Cheeky bastard
---
Kinda hype but I know it's gonna run like sheit.
---
I can't tell whether or not he got it... too smooth a reference, must... give... recognition...
---
I FUCKING HATE WHEN I SPEND MY LAST 2 CURVING ADDONS WITH MY BILLY BOI AND THIS FUCKING GAME GIVEME LERRY
---
I HAD A TRAP ON MY HEAD AND I DIED 0.00001 SECONDS AWAY FROM THE EXIT WITH THE PIG STARING AT ME.
---
That's how The Fog works.
---
DbD barely runs on a PC, oh nonono 
---
Traps don't tick down if they're put on after all generators are done. It just prevents them from leaving.
---
Dced as they thought it was a Mori how sad for them lmfao 
---
But if u look into Ed gain, most of Texas chainsaw massacre is made up
---
Never played before, but I love what I've seen from the game so far. I've heard bad stuff about the console ports, but hopefully the dev will have fixed that by the time fall rolls around.
---
Swap brutal strength with whispers.
---
Tjat way you won't have a bad time with the hatch.
---
I didn‚Äôt forget, all that goes under the ‚Äúetc‚Äù category.
---
But yeah, tons of rules, which is why I think she should be high A tier if not low S tier.
---
This was my most anticipated thing for the Direct!
---
Ryan: Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?
---
Kevin:......me 
---
im still angry that i lost it tho lol
---
He has to rev up his chainsaw and release it when fully. He runs slower while charging. He can cancel out of a full charge by pressing the attack button but this causes him to stop for a moment. When activated, he charges forward with his chainsaw. This charge ends after a few seconds. If he touches anything while chainsawing he throws a tantrum where he slows down to a crawl for a few seconds. If anything gets close to you while throwing a tantrum it takes damage. 
---
It's easy to pip up on both sides
---
The thing I'm hyped for is the POSSIBILITY of Dead by Daylight amiibos. I'll buy them all. 
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Well Im sure say  xbone and ps4 are easily capable of running dbd it‚Äôs just devs don‚Äôt want to optimize it.
---
Yes, but calm spirit should stop that. The music adds atmophere and makes being injured feel more dangerous and vulnerable - calm spirit should allow you to have a clear mind and allow you to think clearly - i.e, no dramatic music.
---
XBox One S is not better than base PS4.
---
Please use the [Megathread.](https://redd.it/aqchce)
---
There is definitely a lot of nuance
---
Well at least pig will let me play a game before she kills me.
---
Hag just wants me for my body it's disgusting.
---
Do I have to explain the rest? They kinda just wana dismember before the first date I'd like to think I am a man of class.
---
EASIER TO MAKE MONEY BY RELEASING IT ON SOMETHING ELSE THAN TO ACTUALLY FIX THE BROKEN POS
---
Spirit butt
---
I guess Ochido has another way back into the game. Like a rat crawling in through a hole in the wall.
---
Broke - Nurse main on console
---
Woke - Huntress main on switch
---
Why? I think it‚Äôs pretty cool. Even if I was killed in the match, I don‚Äôt hold a grudge against the survivor because at least someone is getting points. Plus it‚Äôs pretty awesome when you‚Äôre the survivor getting those points. 
---
I like to describe whispers as ‚ÄúMarco Polo‚Äù because it‚Äôs exactly what it is. Besides, Calm Spirit isn‚Äôt used often so I doubt many people will run it. It‚Äôs not really a ‚Äúmeta‚Äù perk like Adrenaline or Self Care.

Ha, no. Just get very creative with ideas I like, but that creativity dwindles away with disinterest fast, so I need to write it down quick. I've also got posts about a killer idea people seemed to like. If BHVR is ever hiring on the creative side, I wouldn't mind getting involved, but that'd be me reaching out to them, not the other way around. 
---
I‚Äôm kind of excited for it! But like what everyone has said, I hope it run decent and there should be a way to import our save file from ps4/Xbox! Because grinding and buying the dlcs and cosmetic that we already have, will be a waste of money. 
---
Easy there fanboy, they‚Äôre so close I just put them close together.
---
I knew somebody would come in here whipping their duck out and screaming that X console is better then Y console. You can keep your pants on.
---
What if.... And i mean IF.... it somehow run smooth compare to the ps4 and the xbox?
---
Also, you've got to remember that this sub is usually for people dedicated to the game. What they consider easy, is hard for most. While I don't find ranking up to be a testament to my gaming prowess, there are definitely bumps along the way. Also, there was a time that I thought it was near impossible to get to rank 1.  I just thought I was a natural born killer and hit a wall real hard. It makes you learn the game, though. 
---
hey wait that was me
---
Warframe devs have always strived to keep the game running well on everything. There's always bugs but until recently they were even making it work on old pcs running xp. Dbd is a completely different story.
---
When you're a potato and you want to play on a potato.
---
Apologies if this has already been asked or addressed, I‚Äôm going to scan the thread right now but maybe someone has a quick answer - will we be able to transfer our account data (DLC‚Äôs, perks, cosmetics, etc.)?
---
To mee it seems like they both are gonna dab... sorry ill go away now
---
Nurse to a Dwight "would you kindly hand me my axe" as he hides inside a locker
---
Precisely. 
---
As a tangent, ever want to jump-scare a survivor? Pick up Insidious as the nurse. When you are sure that the survivors are going to get the gate open through the normal course of game-play, teleport behind one of the gates. Stand still and hope it's the gate they pick.
---
Then move forward as they start squeezing through or turn around to go find injured friends. You won't catch them unless they panic, but it's an awful amount of fun to see the sudden mouse jerk and head jiggle.
---
This is probably the most accurate chart i've seen. Good job!
---
Is that a T H I C C Meg he is carrying
---
hahahahah 
---
killers cant bitch vs swf since they cant voice chat w/0 3rd party 
---
Oh fuck that's gonna be hard for me cos I suck xD
---
Can they make the game perform well on their existing ports before they put it on another console?
---
One FramePerSecond Man
---
not upvoted enough :((
---
imagine caring about rank
---
That will be a realy cold day in hell
---
Any ideas if voice chat is going to be available?
---
Release Date: Fail 2019
---
That many references nearly needs licensing
---
I'm ignoring your transparent, comical attempts to spin "only shitty killers camp and camping is shitty and boring" as high minded discussion about perks. If you're not going to acknowledge that that bit was irrelevant, like a grownup would, we're done here.
---
&gt; They said it works on shitty killers
---
They said it *only* works on shitty killers, which is false. 
---
&gt; Besides this one particular edge example, BT is almost exclusively useful only against people who tunnel and camp, aka people who aren't that good at killer.
---
Powered exit gates isn't an edge case lol. Every killer will see powered exit gates eventually and therefore every killer will tunnel and camp and therefore BT is good against every killer at some point. Every killer has to learn to deal with BT no matter how good they are whether camping and tunneling is boring or not.
---
If the Switch works like I think it doe, like an incredibly underpowered PC, this *could* happen.
---
Yep
---
Of course. Booty hairs and all
---
Get ready for 5 fps and killers with bad wifi...
---
Credit to /u/ZombieHuggerr for this marvellous meme template
---
I hope they get Panic Button to do the port. They did the Lord's work with Warframe.
---
Worst event since I‚Äôve started playing, didn‚Äôt even come close to getting the first cosmetic.
---
It should be out after dedicated servers right?
---
Hopefully that won‚Äôt be the case. 
---
I don't even like the new nurse skin
---
I love the switch and Nintendo but I realize it kinda sucks for games not specifically designed for it, unfortunately
---
Strap yourself in.  DBD pipping system is based on medals.  There are four categories in which you can receive one of four medals: bronze, silver, gold, iridescent (or no medal).  These medals assign points, so another way to think about it is that each category gives you points depending on how well you did.  Max points is 16 (if you maxed every category).  6 points is a safety pip (+0), and 9 points is a pip (+1).  Basically, you can't crush one category and pip - the game wants you do go do other things.  A general thing to remember is that JUST doing gens or JUST being in chase all game does not significantly help you pip - you want to spread things out over categories.  For this reason, the most important thing to do (especially in the early game) is go finish a gen by yourself.  
---
  
---
The categories:  
---
Lightbringer, unbroken, benevolent, evader  
---
Lightbringer  
---
The key here is objectives such as generators, totems, and exit gates.  In general: do gens.  Doing gens is critical because it gives you two things: points towards this category AND progress toward the end of the game where having more people alive will help everyone get more points.  In general you want to aim for completing at LEAST one generator solo.  More about this at the end.  
---
Unbroken  
---
How long were you alive?  Whole game and escaped without being downed is iridescent (4 points toward pip), escaped but were downed (3 points), died but were alive for awhile (2 points), died relatively quickly 1 point), died super fast (0 points).  
---
Benevolent  
---
This category is a little hazy, but you earn points through unhooking and healing others.  You want to unhook people and you want to do it safely.  
---
Evader  
---
Another hazy category, but the idea here is twofold: be in chases that you escape (easier than it sounds, just be in a chase for 15 seconds and break line of sight for about 5 seconds), and be near the killer while not in chase (closer and for more time is better).  
---
HOW DO I PIP?  
---
Pipping is relatively easy when you understand that you need a little bit from each category for at least 2 categories...My rule of thumb is to do 1-2 gens, unhook AT LEAST one person (2 is preferable), and to spend some time around the killer when they're chasing teammates or be involved in some chases myself.  Ideally you will get your gens earlier, hooks middle/late and chases in between.  **If you can do ONE gen, TWO hook saves, 2 totems, and stay alive for at least 5 minutes (9 minutes is better) you should be good to pip, as the other stuff will happen naturally.**  You will start to see how doing these things will make you pip, and there will be times when you're at the exit gate with NOED active, you realize you've pipped, and you go back into the game with a low probability of escape.  Understanding the pipping system has lead me to go back into games more because I know anything more I get doesn't matter for pipping - I've already opened the gate and in my book, I've "escaped", and I don't mind dying on hook at that point.
---
Yeah, they optimized (huh finally) it for the switch
---
Why would this version not have bans like the other console versions? 
---
perhaps for you as you don't catch the reference
---
Thankd

God id love to play as huntress on the toilet

Wtf why?? Why vault through a window if they are close enough to hit you through it in the first place?

It‚Äôs coming in the summer, same time around dedicates servers
---
That‚Äôs amazing!
---
Happy Ruin and Distressing Skillchecks
---
In the official forums they said it will run on 30 fps. Im gonna take it with a grain of salt
---
Warframe runs great on my Switch. Sure the resolution is a downgrade, but other than that I play at work on break all the time and it‚Äôs a good experience.
---
The pro and the X are not even close, the X is miles ahead in terms of hardware, you can watch all the videos about this on digital foundry youtube or just look at RDR2 on both platforms, the X makes the pro look like an old generation console.
---
Also, this is coming from a Ps fanboy, anyone who thinks the Pro and X are equal or about the same is just desilusional.
---
WAH so hard that all the FPS runs off the screen!
---
Oh wait..
---
Closer to a VERY powerful phone.
---
This is really good.
---
I just spam [INSERT DROP BUTTON HERE]
---
People see red ping and leave, most of the time. If two people want to have red ping in one of my lobbies I'll drop the lobby and rehost since they fill so fast
---
It actually looks optimized on the trailer, good job bhvr!
---
My god are you dumb. I've never said the One X was less powerful. I just corrected your list. Did you take your meds today? Have a good night, to quote you, Enjoy the Xbox Schlonng, lol
---
It does on the app but im not sure if the app will support vc for dbd
---
Aye! First; maybe we can SWF! Add TwilightSworn (me)! Second; Settings &gt; Account &gt; Privacy &amp; online safety &gt; Xbox Live privacy &gt; View details &amp; customize &gt; Communication &amp; multiplayer &gt; Friends Only (if I remember correctly)

If you don't find the hex totem after 15 minutes you're legally allowed to uninstall
---
They got a big sack of Nintendo money.
---
I feel as though the original idea for the character in "Darkness Among Us" was Frank, but then someone suggested Jeff and then they said screw it and made the legion.
---
Ever since the legion update, PS4 has crashed so much more.. 
---
Just earlier today i tried to let a survivor repair some gens for hatch cause all other survs rage quit on hook [thanks rank reset] then outta nowhere GAME FROZE, BLUE SCREEN, DO NOT PASS GO, DO NOT COLLECT 200 BLOODPOINTS
---
no one thinks the switch has as good as specs as a ps4 or xbox. i mean look at it. it is as thin as a phone. however for its size it is very capable. with proper optimization there isnt a doubt in my mind the switch could run dbd but there lies the problem
---
The fuck are you on about? I have played Warframe on Switch and it‚Äôs an excellent port that looks and runs extremely well. Stop spreading lies
---
Thank you, I‚Äôve played games on both and tbh I like the PS4‚Äôs games a lot more, but this guy is just fucking stupid lol
---
*intense phantom organ tune*
---
Yeah I just think maybe they should fix what they‚Äôve already shipped out before porting to another console. Kind of annoying that they‚Äôve prioritised the switch over fixing the other editions of the game on console
---
uhhhh lol
---
and here i thought it was gonna be  survivor sided win, boy was i in for a shock
---
Playing against a smart pig still terrifies me. Hearing the terror radius is pretty scary... but not hearing it is even worse...
---
&gt;1. She has insane map pressure due to her traps, chases are initiated with one trap being popped.
---
Her traps that are nullified by crouching and/or flashlighting, also she can only teleport from a certain distance.
---
&gt;2.She has insane snowball due to her teleports, she can bounce around the map downing a bunch of survivors if your web is set up right.
---
Pretty much what I said for the first one.
---
&gt;1. When unhooking, the Hag either trades, or the survivor has to crouch to the hook and crouch back, wasting tons of time, and gives the Hag time to come back to the hook and punish the unhook.
---
Crouching does waste time but urban evasion and flashlights counter this.
---
&gt;2. When in a chase, her traps have little counterplay. Chases are entirely dependant on the Hags skill with placing traps, not the survivors.
---
True, but she requires extra time to even set up her traps and if she misses an area and then find a survivor she's fucked until that survivor goes into an area she has trapped, wasting more time. I will agree that if her traps are good she excels in chases.
---
&gt;3. Her small terror radius and height allows for good ambush, especially with Monitor and Abuse.
---
Her terror radius is a benefit, but her height is not. For example, on coldwind she can see even less in the corn than normal killers. M&amp;A does wonders for her though.
---
Is she viable? Yes. Is she good? Yes. But it requires lots of setting up and more work on her part to properly get her traps good and ready when they can simply be crouched over or burned. Maybe not mid chase, but survivors can probably stealth around otherwise.
---
If I gave up as soon as them made me drop him, than yes, it would've been!
---
SURVIVORS ARE SO ENTITLED, I GOT LOOPED ON THE SAME WINDOW FOR FOUR GENS AFTER MY HEX TOTEM WERE CLEANSED 30 SECONDS INTO THE ROUND. WHEN I HOOKED THE FIRST PERSON AFETR FOUR GENS AND GOT CALLED A CAMPER WHEN SOMEONBE TRIED TO INSTA-SAVE AND I NOTICED THEM. I ALSO GOT CALLED A TUNNELER WHEN ONE RANK 19 SURVIVOR WAS PLAYING BAD AND RAN INTO ME UNTIL HE WAS DEATH HOOK.
---
And I never said you said it was les spowerful GOOD GOD CAN YOU FUCKING READ?? I was disproving that they aren‚Äôt close but I guess that‚Äôs too hard for you. Good god, do I have to spell it out??
---
HUMMING BEGINS WHILE SHITTING
---
His ability can be used in a way that feels pretty bullshit for both sides. 
---
When you chase someone hit by Frenzy, their timer doesn't go down. However, if you aren't technically in a chase according to the game, the timer goes down. Players exploit this by getting far enough away from the deep wound survivor, but still follow them and simply wait until they're forced to sit and mend or otherwise bleed out. Almost 0 opportunity for the survivor to get away from a Legion using Bloodhound. 
---
No, I meant nobody joins my lobby for 10+ minutes. 
---
I have 200mbs internet, so I'm not worried about hosting but it's odd to me that it takes this long
---
You will never be good enough for condescending redditors to take your advice seriously, just ignore it, according to them nobody is good at video games anyway.

Oh ok it‚Äôs fine

---
I'm also garbage as killer but I've had a 4k! You can do it, buddy!
---
Jesus Christ you need to loosen up a bit.

on low ranks only.
---
Dead by daylight doesn‚Äôt deserve to be on the switch. It‚Äôs a glitchy mess filled with incompetent devs. I‚Äôm very worried.
---
Neat but, couldn't you have just *not* commented?
---
How is clown bad?
---
or if another person buys Freddy and plays the tunnel game instead of being effective at using Dream state.
---
It's also a business strategy not to buy/invest in dedicated server on launch since you don't know if the game is going to click on the market. Servers are expensive as sh*t.
---
But...nah.
---
me on mcdonalds wifi while playin this on my nintendo switch
---
What did they port it to ? 
---
Jokes aside portable DBD would be pretty sweet.
---
She had to, you were T-Posing she knew you were dangerous!
---
&gt;but the real ~~winner~~ runner up is Kate
---
FTFY, Meg mains unite!
---
Completely unrelated but okay
---
&gt; They shouldnt do this till dedicated servers are a thing.
---
Says right on the video "This fall", the servers are coming in summer which could be as early as June or as late as Sept. . 
---
I'll "release" how dumb I'm being? lol. I'll ask you to do the same, the base PS4 is much stronger than the One S. Every graphics comparison for the last 5 years prove it. Sorry that caused you such pain.
---
Nea's face is that of a goblin.

*T*hats an *I*n*T*riguingly *L*aughabl*E* question.
---
Nah, DWIGHT
---
They must be laughing all the way to the bank at this point.  The console versions mostly run like shit but that doesn‚Äôt stop them from releasing subpar killers and cosmetics and charging real money for them.
---
Maybe focus on making sure your other ports work properly?
---
