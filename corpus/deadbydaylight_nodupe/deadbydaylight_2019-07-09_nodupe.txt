You really are.    As I stated before. It‚Äôs essentially having 4 survivors with No Mither.  Which is a lot better than insta downing projectile attacks.  Which 8/10 survivors agree with.  It‚Äôs so strange to see how many people doesn‚Äôt see this. I see almost everyone in red ranks holding that big ol broken symbol.  Then you get the one goof who goes and cleanses and then that‚Äôs all of the other 3 that‚Äôs pretty much dead instantly.  Where as everytime I see all 4 stay broken. It‚Äôs usually a 4 man escape because they know what‚Äôs going on. 
---

---
You‚Äôre literally taking away half of her power by only letting her use the other half. 
---
I‚Äôm used to a lot of DBD bragging from the toxic side.  This ain‚Äôt no toxic debate.  Just a friendly one.
---
---
---
You do want leatherface because he has BBQ n Chilli which will cut the grind out of your game exponentially.
---
A nerf isn't enough honestly. They are cancer and just need to be straight up removed.
---
Lol I have a large group of gay friends that play this game you‚Äôre not lying. ü§£
---
Lol no your just bad. His power gets turned off after 2 seconds, and his lunge distance is the SAME as every other killer. He can still get looped around and makes noise even when he has no terror radius. 
---
He cant remark you. Your just dumb.
---
Yeah.
---
You don't prematurely just camp a pallet period it's a stupid play.  Just forces it down immediately and wastes it.  Be in position to loop the pallet not to just immediately burn it.  Pallet Campers kill more survivors than the Billies do.
---
Tecnically you get better items on the bloodweb once you prestige, but i don't see that much of a difference honestly.
---
Yeah, they need a way to be balanced and breakable, I just think the random spawn and search is a poor way of implementing them.
---
Hell if i havent been hooked yet and someones on their last hook ill take a chase and LET the killer hook me so the desth hook people can do other shit.
---
No it doesn‚Äôt
---
I just think they shouldn‚Äôt be random, there should be at least a bit more skill than ‚Äúsearch and get lucky or don‚Äôt‚Äù.
---
Its when you are in the same game as someone who doesnt want to die, its illegal and you should hate yourself.
---
What is this Galaxy thing?
---
If you have dying light never ever ever go anywhere near the killers terror radius.
---
thanks! i prestiged my jane to lv1 and all i got was a bloody shirt and regrets. i dont think im gonna p2 her anytime soon
---
From my experience it is impossible to break his stealth while he is stalking behind an object. Most ghostfaces will also continually stalk and hide so you can never fully reveal them.
---
Well yeah it's a friendly one I hope I'm not coming off as toxic lol none of my previous comment was sarcasm 
---
But idk man to me it just depends on how the game goes, there's times I've avoided cleansing and there's times I have. Times I've been wrecked by her and times I've dealt with just fine. I guess in my opinion there's no set strategy, we could debate which one works more often but to me it just comes down to how the game is going. Yeah if all my teammates are riding the broken symbol I wont fuck them over, otherwise I don't see the issue really since there are various ways to avoid the corruption 
---
To each their own though
---
Assuming that the person doesn't get immediately downed after already taking a single hit, I'm usually able to make it just in time and haven't had any problems. Unless it is rank reset, survivors are usually able to buy at least enough time for me to make it over.
---
I use bond in normal gameplay in more than half my builds and just have not had as much use out of it as I have had with empathy when it comes to flashlights/sabo. I do think bond is better under normal circumstances though.
---
If they reworked it so it makes the obsession change the way the new ghostface perk does I wouldn‚Äôt mind it
---
She doesn‚Äôt bully 9 out of 10. That‚Äôs blatantly false.
---
I can get the name confusion but their masks and color schemes are different. Deathstrokes is half black and half orange while Deadshot's is all gray with a red eyepiece.
---
Where do you find this format what is the meme called
---
So you made a claim based on what I said, thereby putting words in my mouth.
---
Now you agree that this is fine? Lots would disagree with the current state of the game
---
Ahh ok, It kind of felt wrong leveling up a person I wont use. Thank
---
only thing you can really do is run ruin.
---
I feel you, they could use a rework like they did with the end game collapse. The thing is I personally have no suggestion on how to improve them.
---
He doesn't move at full speed, which is why people are downvoting you.
---
Nah, there‚Äôs a new season, character and a ranked mode now. Most of my friends list has people playing Apex right now on PS4 btw. My group switched to Apex for a while because dbd was so dead trying to find killers at night. With the new killer we‚Äôve started playing dbd again more because there‚Äôs more killers but we switch to apex now and then when it gets slow. Also still waiting on dedicated servers or dbd because this shit is so annoying right now. :(
---
You're the minority, its a trope that survivors are toxic on this sub for a reason, the survivor role has generslly been the strongest throughout the games history and they are notorious for coming up with rules that the killers must follow, the game is much much more balanced now but there are still a lot of players here that played in the dark days.
---
Very important to not lump all survivors into the profile of toxic survivor, toxicity is very common from survivors but its not fair to treat them all like they are cancer, for instance, i flex which means i play both, i have been high rank on both since release and im never toxic unless its retaliation and even then i see myself as petty when i do it, a lot of players have lower standards.
---
They are lucky
---
Look up Zoe.EXE. League of legends youtubers make meme montages and id really like to see more dbd meme montages.
---
Thank you for explaining it to me. I was so confused
---
&gt;So you made a claim based on what I said, thereby putting words in my mouth.
---
You stated 90% of the time Hillbilly would win, I gave a rhetorical question about the other 10% and answered it with my next question. Never did I say "You said" or called it your point.
---
I disagree with SWF existing as a whole, but it does, so I agree with nurse existing against it.
---
Idk man, only comments i've gotten on my profile is copypasta and one guy giving me a thumbs up
---
Yeah but pig was way too overpowered so BHVR nerfed her again to make games with her even remotely bareable üòÇüò•
---
And I was just stating that the point seemed meaningless. It stated players. Killers are players. Thus killers would be included. 
---
I don't think it's a fair statement because they were being specific. I don't think it's a fair statement because there is no reason to not include killers. No one honestly thinks killers would magically be exempt except people who perpetuate the them vs us mentality that infests this game and causes people to act like children.
---
I was just trying to say it nicer then I just did.
---
End of summer
---
I love it!
---
Let small game keep track of totems!
---
Good Trapper is scarier than Michael because there goes my loop.
---
Lol yeah i described it as "being in the same game as someone who doesnt want to die" which these days probably counts as tunneling.
---
I think you're doing a pretty good job so far!
---
Gens get done in 80 seconds. 44 if 2 on 1 which, considering survivors spawn together beside them is pretty likely.
---
By 90 seconds 2 gens are usually done. Mishandling a chase has nothing to do with it.
---
Hooked one survivor in the basement, checked one of the lockers just in case because I saw that the chest in the basement was open and the match had just started. Found another survivor and hooked them. Opened another locker and there was a third survivor there. Fourth guy just gave up.
---
I‚Äôve got a few strats for a few killers.  But taking a year long break from the game kind of destroyed a couple of them. And yeah of course it all depends on the killer and their own unique play style. And of course if they‚Äôre running Thanat that‚Äôs sure to throw a few buckets of gas into the fire but I feel like if they‚Äôre not running the add on that shows aura everytime you throw up then you‚Äôre mostly safe.
---
You don‚Äôt get anything different or extra special, it‚Äôs just all the same bs like any other blood web, I prestiged 2 of my survivors to P3 and was disappointed. I will not be prestigeing anyone else, it‚Äôs a waste of blood points!
---
One of my mains. How dare you!
---
&gt;instead of blocking and taking aggro:P  
---
What, did you think survivors unhooked others so that they could live?  
---
Hah no, BP is where it's at...  
---
;-;
---
On a town map, there‚Äôs only like three killers I wouldn‚Äôt say this to. Otherwise, there are fewer pallets than there used to be, you don‚Äôt need to break or force down every single one with optimal positioning, the loops take 10-20 seconds max with proper pathing, and a lot of them you can mindgame for an easy hit. 
---
So yeah I‚Äôm saying if you don‚Äôt do those things, you could be a better killer.
---
Thats dwight you heathen

100% using glacial for spirit. It fits her aesthetic super well
---
I play with headphones and still rely on spine chill.
---
Oh yeah you reminded me when so fought a scratched mirror Myers on cold wind farm, he camped me once exit gates got opened but my teammates unhooked and he kept overestimating lunge range so so got out.
---
Is that the spirit in the background
---
No
---
What do you mean will it be replaced?
---
Where he is stating an opinion and expecting us to care without a proper explanation.
---
This Dwight I had in a game yesterday did this to me 3 times in a row. I got off the gen and pointed away.
---
He left.
---
Then I got hooked because I was stupid enough to think his run scratches would keep me safe.
---
Tier 1 Myers is immune to detection perks and Wraith and Ghostface can be seen
---
I've played the game for over 250 hours. Admittedly not as much as many people here, but I can personally say that I can count on two hands the amount of times I've had actual hackers or lag switchers.
---
I never really use it but since all my friends are rank 18-20 I usually play in low ranks. I‚Äôll take it as a luxury to teach my friends to do gens if a killer is camping
---
ur telling me the final girl trope wouldn‚Äôt outrank dead police officer???? you need to watch more horror flicks my dude
---
I just googled "women yelling at cat meme" and found a blank.
---
Quit trying to escape and only work on getting a pip every game.
---
I made him use his chainsaw on the tree that I was running around. I guess the emblem system doesn't count that but it was very effective in evading his attack and pissing him off.
---
Ruining the game experience *intentionally* for others like that - if you have any proof of it, you could get them banned, even if only temporarily. If you google "dbd game rules" you'll find the official thread on it.
---
They should just make thrill of the hunt passive. Then if they get broken it's my fault not rngs.
---
People who don't rebind their action key:
---
[Me:](https://cdn130.picsart.com/269292153017211.png)
---
yes.
---
He was number one eh?
---
Can‚Äôt hear it.
---
Nah I've seen what my friends can do with freddy but they play him very differently. Most killer mains try to play 5 diff killers and play them all the same, camp and tunnel and then complain they get crushed. Freddy is hard to play but when done correctly, yields good results.
---
Would Feng Min have made more sense?
---
Ahhh so typical! What a hypocrite! Had a basement blocking Dr. Last night at Macmillan estate where it‚Äôs the big factory and the basement spawned there. Kept 2 people in there all game until the end. We all reported that pos and he was only able to get 1 kill and depiped. 
---
Sad part was he was a rank 3 on PS4 and went back to a 4, dude was straight trash.
---
But I have a macro for my spacebar. MWAHAHAHAHAA!
---
I know I can get a bloody skin option, but would it be more of an overlay on my DLC or a total replacement with the default skin &amp; the blood on top of that.
---
I think the vomiting sounds are hilarious tbh
---
If everyone has the same character, cosmetics, and steam name, it severely fucks with the status display in the bottom left, causing statuses to display on different people and other buggy shit
---
Goro Majima next killer confirmed?
---
Imagine having sex with the clown and he fingers you with his cut fingers instead of his'
---
I remember when 420 shards were a decent amount both as a meme and economically
---
So theyre going back on a lot of their promises lately.
---
And just like a super rare Pok√©mon, they are either Uber shit you just try and find for the novelty, or god tier gold that everyone wishes they had
---
She survived one movie in DbD Canon. After the arrived in the Entity's realm that everyone has delt with the same stuff. So everything Laurie has delt with tapp has too. It comes down to their skill set. Tapp is a detective and a police officer with combat training. Laurie is a badass teenaget with no training not does she have a consistent of a combat record as a police officer would.
---
Bring Ebony Mori.
---
To be honest your argument is completely invalid, the amount of time it takes to clear 4 totems is how long it takes to complete a generator and undeniably you get more points for the totems. Secondly that's not accounting for how much points and emblem score you get for escaping in the situation they have NOED when you otherwise wouldn't.
---
I was giving some leeway. Even 80s is often too long. That's why I mentioned 60 in most cases.
---
It is a whole new item. You can have both.
---
So in the first 60 seconds of the game all killers need to find and down someone?
---
Queue times are bad because of amount of killers not the amount of players.
---
Well tbh it's not really a legit strategy hence why tunnelers can't even admit being tunnelers.
---
How about OG Kate's Voice
---
1k IQ
---
That's understandable, the only way to currently get around that is using thrill of the hunt which helps in like 90% of games, especially if you're playing someone like nurse, billy, legion or spirit who can move very fast
---
How did u meet them, discord? I want!
---
yeah but I want to know the source of the cat part on its own lmao. The woman screaming is an old meme from one of those house wives shows. i wanna know what cat that is jaja
---
Yes it sounds ridiculous.
---
They spawn right next to gens on some maps. I just stopped using Hexes.
---
It let‚Äôs me... hit survivors.
---
It's usually a strong start. You get one person off the gen to save while you chase another one. Max of one player on the gens while the others heal up and you chase someone else. A decent players can do it pretty consistently.
---
Bro everyone is complaining but I play as both killer and survivor and I‚Äôve adapted to every map, the only problem is every other person is bad and dies before I do, leaving me alone to find the hatch, or some dickface saves me in front of the killer. And for some fucking reason my highest level killer is level 30 and the lowest kill count I‚Äôve gotten is 2 so far yet about 99% of the time I die because of another survivor being idiotic or just generally bad luck and being the only survivor chased for the whole match
---
Ace is daddy and so are you
---
Its not immune to spine chill.
---
How to make it?
---
Skydancer tech?
---
*year and a half
---
Ima leave ASAP when I get to rank 1 I‚Äôm rank 2 with 0 pip at the moment
---
idk why you‚Äôre gunna include tapp‚Äôs other films but not laurie‚Äôs. thought she was ‚Äúqueen‚Äù. if we‚Äôre going off age, tapp is old and he probably has htn or asthma or some shit. laurie can survive an unstoppable killer, tapp is just another dead cop
---
Old post I know but how is BBQ n' Billy nowhere near as strong as it used to be? I thought it was never nerfed.
---
Unless you mean survivors can run Distortion or use lockers to block auras.
---
Trapper doesn't need a buff. Just because he is c tier, doesn't mean he isn't viable at all. People like otzdarva play him to his best and enjoy it, even on red ranks.
---
And as someone mentioned, he is the face of dbd , so they'll obviously give him the skin, plus that he wears a mask, wich opens way more creative ways to design it.
---
How'd you buff them to deal with such a powerful tool like communication?
---
completely dependant on the gen spread, at least when theres more your always checking multiple gens quickly, if 2 are on one side of the map and 1 is on the other, you cant check them all and you insta lose
---
You want to down someone in the first minute and hook them. Until then, there are three people on gens. After the first down, at least one person needs to go unhook them. Two people on gens (max). In the meantime, I used BBQC or patrol the gens to find someone else and start chasing them. One person on the gen and that's only if one person decided to go for the save, which in a non-swf setting, is uncertain.
---
I think they learned their lesson and make better loops, and hopefully increase the size of the map. Doctor with max terror radius can almost reach around the whole map, and with snipe doc you can almost hit the opposite side. But from what we've seen, the yellow house looks better from a graphical side, so visually it will improve significantly.
---
Playerbase is fine, it still occasionally hits number 1 on twitch, and is usually around the top 8, if that says anything about it
---
I did report him. I messaged him about it and he apologized and seemed nice tho. I felt bad but who knows maybe that‚Äôs what he wants me to think.
---
If you are on xbox, why would I search steam? I was just unaware that xbox had the rank 1 achievement since ps4 doesn't have it.
---
You shouldn't, I think it uses the backup save. My friends and I have seen it before and haven't seen any problems after it.
---
The only way you are finding and drowning someone in the first minute is if they screwed up really bad and it's a small map.
---
Oh my bad sorry
---
It doesn't matter. He knew what he was doing which was unfair for everyone.
---
"His lullaby tells you where hes coming from." 
---
No it doesn't. It just tells you hes in the area.
---
You're welcome.
---
0 of either of those in 2k+ hours
---
when you hit them and Make Your Choice instantly runs out making you only injure the Feng Min that if you downed earlier would've won you a 4k but you have to settle with a meddling 3k.
---
Hey I‚Äôm a rank 8 also, and I play on PS4. My tag is ralucatosa ü•∞
---
No they are player controlled
---
Is his name Nurse or Spirit?
---
Depends on rank but anywhere from 5 seconds to 3 or 4 minutes typically
---
After Ghost Face came out as a Myers/Pig hybrid, it‚Äôs not surprising. Just seems a bit odd that it‚Äôs not a bit more unique of an ability for Freddy. He‚Äôs done so many cool things in the movies to take one of those powers.
---
The entity is pleased. Merciless Killer
---
Well then Story needs to be renamed because that‚Äôs not a tortoise
---
So does xbox have the rank 1 achievement? It's weird they wouldn't make console achievements consistent if so.
---
steam name: cucklord ([https://steamcommunity.com/id/IAMMANDARK](https://steamcommunity.com/id/IAMMANDARK)) incase you cant find it.
---
rank doesnt matter.
---
swf or kyf.
---
current rank is 8 with over 1.1k hours
---
What about Jeff and his loud ass screech when he gets hooked
---
Didn‚Äôt he do that on purpose? The Jake knew he was dead and tbagged for fun.
---
Good morning crew let's get this putrid serum
---
No the entity takes them from there realm and after the match it throws them back home
---
they all made a deal with them to do its bidding from what ik
---
Fair, fair
---
this cosplay looks just normal enough to warent people really wondering why you have blood on you lol
---
How the heck do I effectively reveal Ghostface? I feel like half the times that I'm starting directly at him, nothing happens and I get exposed and downed. Other times I reveal him without even trying. Super frustrating.
---
Yeah that's what I'm saying. The fact that it is still happening. And make it to where the map kills you now. Used to atleast maybe you could find the other door or the hatch when it glitches out. But now if the game screws up, you lose, killer wins always. Gg.
---
Let the killer know what kind of fanboy you are by console exclusive sweaters and shirts. Black and blue Ps logo, Green and white XB logo, Red and white Switch logo. 
---
PC can have a cosmetic also but not play with console. I do not want mouse and keyboard nurse, billy, or survivors against me.
---
The fuck am I then?
---
Yup, hoped that bubba got banned. In the beginning of match I worked on a gen then a Dwight started walking into a wall and then 3 seconds later Bubba was there and after running I saw him chainsaw nothing then air as downed and teleported back.
---
Fast recovery boio
---
There would be a million issues with killing kids.
---
It's supposed to be killer sided, it's literally Killer against 1 survivor. The hatch is meant to be a tiny chance of escaping
---
I'm saying that's how you generate pressure and good killers can make that happen often.
---
It wouldn't let me play. I straight up could not click any of the game modes :(
---
You gotta place them in the most aesthetically appealing locations. Your true power isn't your traps... it's your sense of feng shui.
---
r/dadjokes
---
If you don‚Äôt cleanse all game, you‚Äôre broken all game, so down in one hit, and infect whatever you touch, so somewhat easier to track. I‚Äôm not quite sure how good a strategy that is?
---
You're talking about a 1 in 10 game maybe scenario. Go back to watching streams.
---
Spirit for killer, the survivors are all mediocre. I would save for perks in the shrine of secrets opposed to buying a survivor with shards.
---
So, fuck exclusives, but only if it's PS4/Xbox. Cool.
---
Everyones talking things relevant to Dbd when im like "Man the ending of Fresh Prince was bitter sweet".
---
Don't bother with down votes, prayer beads are op as fuck and have no counterplay
---
Yeah that has happened to me as well. It's such a dick thing to do.
---
K, thnx m8's
---
Yeah, saddly
---
*give me a borgar*
---
1 in 10 lol. You and I must have very different experiences playing killer at red ranks.
---
It looks like me when My mom beats me
---
Do totems spawn side by side in your games or something? If you go for totems right out of the gate by the time you finish running all over the map and clearing all 5, 2-3 gens will be done by the time you are finished possibly more depending on map size.
---
Personally I enjoy watching good killer gameplay on YouTube, players like Tru3, Tofu and ScottJund. For survivor I think Puppers has some of the best. I like seeing skilled killers that can explain their thought processes during the game and are generally knowledgeable without being arrogant or obnoxious about it.
---
Hag
---
I actually had this issue the other night.  The worst part is I was running play with your food. I was just as frustrated as they were lol!
---
The hag is fun to play imo
---
One time I was trying adept trapper and I got one hook before the gens were all popped. No add ons or anything.
---
After that I downed a Claudette, Ash ran into an obvious trap he should‚Äôve seen, another Claudette vaulted into a third trap, and the injured Meg vaulted right into my arms.
---
P.S. End Game Collapse still works on survivors in bear traps :))
---
Someone needs to Zubatlel cat this...also Unlucky
---
That actually helps you can see the claws wiggling when you're chasing the obs.
---
If you have so many negative things to say about the game why still play
---
Dollar store Jesus is here to part the Gulf of Mexico
---
P3 = prestige 3= Claudette with long hair covered in blood. She's very hard to see.
---
They made it 128 meters so that it's easier to code, at least more so than unlimited. There's also no map in the game that's bigger than empathys range so it never really got nerfed
---
Locker
---
O_O That's what that means?! I literally thought BHVR just stealth added the obsession wiggle to make obsession icon look a little more interesting!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jrv7TQYg5U
---
this guide might also be good, tells you about common loops. I'm still super new, but I feel like knowing how to waste the killer's time/making the best use of your time as a survivor is a major part of being a survivor.
---
that's a threat, report that and get his account banned from PSn
---
Notice how the character slide to her when she pick you up.. that because in her screen you were way closer then what  you saw. Dedicated server might help a bit but if a killer have a higher ping in a dedicated server it will still do that.
---
Bill. I can't imagine anyone not wanting to sleep with Bill.
---
when you hook someone, they get unhooked and you chase the same person and re hook them.
---
*has flashback of all the times I died to huntress
---
Thanks, im just asking because i recently came back to the game and wanted to get in touch by this subreddit
---
I think the demigorgen would be cool. More of a planted killer who sends his halves to down the survivors then finishes the job himself. Could even have an "otherside" like freddy's dreams.
---
:&gt; its nice as one of the other survivors cos you know you can do unsafe gens since someones in chase :&gt;
---
I know this is odd, but this seems like Dwight main thing because I‚Äôve played with a few Dwights and most of the time this happens
---
I expected a shitpost
---
on PC what button do a lot of people use for dead hard? E is too hard to use during chases, especially if I'm strafing with D. So far I'm using a mouse button but it feels weird.
---
As a Feng Min main I can honestly say this is true
---
Both of these killers are focused on slowing down the game, but the Pig is generally considered to be better than the Legion, and she's more fun too. Legion is actually pretty boring to play as, and doesn't feel as rewarding. The biggest problem with the Pig is how RNG reliant she is.
---
Yeah no doubt! I've seen that wiggle soooooo many times but I've never really put any thought in to it. As killer or survicor I don't run obsession perks very often so I've never really paid attention to it.
---
I'm at 16 on console. You have no idea...
---
Wow, you really just prove yourself as a gay guy. I'm wondering how many time you gonna SLAP yourself each time you respond to me? :)) I feel really bad for you too snowflake. Did you look at yourself yet?
---
Nah, I'm way more excited for the Freddy rework
---
If you tunnel you're losing time on gens. More tunneling, more gens done
---
Tanks man
---
double blood point event. We got the birthday on top this year with the cakes.. I got like 8 characters to 50 who I don't play which is nice.
---
My nurse has like 40 lol... I don't know how to play her, but one day!!
---
Point 2 doesn't really matter if you just memorize totem spawns, point 3 doesn't matter if you commit to gens (which you really, really should).. you also left out point 4: there are so many safe pallets that anyone with halfway decent routing can run the killer around for several minutes.  It's definitely not a killer sided map.
---
Wise decision
---
pretty safe bet since they get massive influxes of new and old players the events for Summer Winter Halloween etc will be in every year.
---
So she can eat him out nice
---
Oh ye they will have a great time
---
For a hetero ship i choose claudette for a gay ship i choose david
---
Not to rain in your parade or anything since I‚Äôm new too, but I got all 4 on the red(whatever it‚Äôs
---
Called I can‚Äôt remember) as a killer, I was using Ghost Face and I felt proud and you should feel proud too because getting 3 is just as hars
---
I'd buy this for Claudette lol
---
Yes
---
Context: Going directly from crouched to sprinting will not consume sprint burst, allowing you to use it on demand.
---
I just wish the maps didn't all look the same
---
Translates to ‚ÄúI turn you into a cured meat and then I stab you to death‚Äù
---
Omegablink considered fun LUL
---
Yes. If they aren't running prayer beads then they're relying on scratch marks and character sounds. You can stop your marks by not running, and you can prevent noise by running iron will. 
---
When it comes to a pallet? You kinda play a 50/50, pay attention to the sounds, if there are prayer beads (which make spirits haunt silent) they will not see scratch marks so running in an unpredictable way might help. 
---
If the spirit is playing mind games with you start changing up your strategy, if they make a wrong step in the mind game they're punished hard. 
---
Hope I helped.
---
I mean they could've went to them earlier and partnered up and if they finished what Netflix wanted they would announce it then to build up hype instead of waiting a year for it like what epic games did because soon after they released a demogorgon and chief Hopper skin in fortnite.
---
I‚Äôm on console and now I‚Äôm scared
---
Hook
---
That very well could be the case, I dunno though, stranger things just wouldn‚Äôt fit well imo
---
Doing the same thing.
---
The gameplay for Mortal Kombat 11 looked great too. But execution and what‚Äôs being shown in bits to be cherry picked for an E3 presentation are 2 entirely different things. Dead by daylight is surprisingly taxing on consoles as is, anyone with a PS4 will know it revs the fan like an engine because of how taxing it is and poorly optimized for consoles. Now look at the switch which I own and see that it fails at the most basic of tasks without being on a taxing game. MK11 constantly crashes in certain areas and is a nightmare because of how the switch uses mainly WiFi and peer to peer connections and anyone who wants a wired connection need to buy an adapter to use one. 
---
The switch version will be a disaster. There‚Äôs essentially 0 friend system on the switch so good luck playing with friends. Voice coms are out the window very few switch games support chat and only with using the phone app. The frame rates on PS4 and Xbox one are pretty bad in some cases and make playing killers like nurse a hassle and using killers like huntress or doctor just frustrating because of how their power slows down or slugs the gameplay. 
---
I would not preorder it if you‚Äôre seriously considering getting the switch version wait because I highly doubt it will be properly optimized for the switch.
---
How are you going to improve if you don‚Äôt even try to play against it?
---
Whenever I play killer, I spend about 10s in a chase. If I land a hit or am close to landing that hit, I go with the chase. If neither, I stop the chase and go onto someone else. It sucks to run into smurfs or against a survivor you just can't hit, but take the loss and move onto another survivor. In fact, it causes a lot of disruption as 1 survivor wasn't doing a gen [and now has to go find one] while you stopped the other survivor from working on a gen. Hence, it may turn into an advantage!
---
Probably identity v gamers trying out DBD
---
True. Her traps seem very reliant on rng. I'm only level nine and I need to hit sixty or so before I get my first new killer so I have some time. I'll think about this. Thank you!
---
Oh lord
---
Would be nice to have some variety though as a demogorgon looks badass but I think it's a game rather than chapter
---
Meg heads when they hear a heartbeat
---
Thanks to you and all these new wave players who suddenly decided to make the meaning the opposite of what it's ALWAYS been, I am now constantly unsure whether it's safe or not. You don't get rescued if you're flailing your arms, because I assume everyone is using the original meaning. And if not, who cares, you can die. You don't just get to change the established meaning of something and expect it to go your way.
---
Once you learn the maps and how to exploit their shitty design it‚Äôs not hard to last more than 60 seconds in a chase against an M1 killer
---
Why still play? It‚Äôs literally there in my title that I took a break. Just came back to see if I‚Äôm still having fun or not.
---
Oh interesting
---
Noed should only get nerfed if adrenaline does and vice versa. Fuck both those perks
---
Oh yes very good choice indeed
---
I've tried enough times to know I don't want to play against them any more, and shouldn't really have to when it is preventable.
---
seems like everyone's brainless then.
---
Yes I love it when that happens
---
Yeah, that's the one. Before, you could only really hide from it by crouching behind a gen, and you could be seen anyway if the killer looks closely.
---
The lockers (and distortion as well, to a smaller extent) have dropped it from the god-tier status it had before.
---
'Nowhere near as good' is a bit misleading on my part, but in my opinion, it isn't *the* perk to have these days. It's still very good, but an argument can definitely be made for dropping BBQ for a different perk, especially discordance.
---
Cha cha real smooth
---
Also an important thing to know is: there's no right or wrong way to play the game just have fun. Honor codes don't exist rather then when someone wants to be toxic, if there camping keep the killer there n wiggly arm mode activate so that your team will hopefully work gens. If I get tunneled I try to waste as much as the killers time for my team
---
dual monitors is just for being able to do multiple things at the same time i usually have discord open on one screen and a game on the other as as for differences dbd js basically the same on both (minus the obvious things ofc!)
---
I feel like claudette and dwight would just be nerdy and cute together and dwight is most definitely a bottom not a top which is why david would top
---
Except then they just tell their buddies in discord where I'm headed. I think it's the combo that gets me the most. I often deal with one or the other without too much extra trouble. But I just seem to be running into a lot of uber coordinated groups with a smurf lately.
---
I‚Äôd say Freddy‚Äôs fake pallets are better with the fact that you can trick a survivor into playing around them instead of the pallet just vanishing when close, but then again you gotta be asleep for that.
---
The moral of the original story is that slow and steady is bullshit.
---
In that story, the cocky hare takes a nap, sleeps longer than anticipated and allows the tortoise to win. As the winner, the tortoise is charged to warn the animals of the forest from danger.
---
Some time later, from the top of its tower, the tortoise sees a fire starting. By the time it takes the tortoise to make it down its tower, the fire burned the forest and all the animals with it.
---
Hang on - you're going to claim that you're judging them off their skill set after arriving in the entity's world then go on to claim that Tapp has more of a skillset? If you're going to move the goalposts then no, they both have exactly the same skillset - fixing the generators, using medkits, and getting tunneled by Legion
---
Ah. The penguin belly slide technique. Truly a master
---
It's the same way with killers that understand the maps, where the most vulnerable spots are, taking advantage of certain gen spots and dead zones.
---
Hmm makes sense
---
I mean, the best way to learn how to play against higher ranking survivors is to play against higher ranking survivors. If you want to climb the ranks, the survivors are inevitably going to get better, which means you‚Äôll have to as well. If you keep playing against potato survivors, your skills aren‚Äôt ever going to improve.
---
The issue with this seemingly minute change is, you can no longer rip people off of pallets. If you hit someone and they drop the pallet on the wrong side. You can no longer rip them off as they go to vault to the correct side. The number is small but has an actual impact in practice.
---
hahah yeaaaah, that choked me up a bit too, watching Will stare at that empty room - memories of the family activities just an echo in the past.... :(
---
In my opnion those are the two worst killers to start with at least on the turns of fun the hag, Doctor, Ghostface, and last billy are the funniest to play
---
Well, then. I want exclusive cosmetics for the PS4, Xbox, and PC versions of the game.
---
Remember, saying toxic is itself toxic
---
I think Kate would have to be daphne instead tho, also nea would be scooby
---
It makes her far more difficult to go up against for sure, but you can still hear her footsteps and see grass moving when phasing, you just have to pay close attention to your surroundings. 
---
That, and perks like iron will and spinechill counter her nicely too!
---
Survivors decide where to run though. You have to create dead spots or have an instadown to keep them from the safe spots.
---
Yeah whenever i play KYF its just memes so my killer main friends can test out new builds the devs should definitely include a quickplay mode and a rewards system in future updates
---
I think this is the first time I've seen two people get screwed by this glitch. I really hope they fix this soon.
---
Had a game with a Jane the other day whose name was DBD-is-trash and she got hit by it.
---
If everything is toxic, it‚Äôs all fair.
---
Yes, this image was taken seconds before he was grabbed off a gen
---
Wait, I think I was doing this before the patch. I thought it was a well known trick? Was I mistaken? And is it a bug or feature?
---
whats that mean? Is it just cosmetic?
---
Loving the art style its cute!
---
Is that a Bohemian Rhapsody reference
---
1. If you have more than 100 hours in the game it shouldn't be hard to find totem spawns, it takes me like 120 seconds to clear all totems.
---
2. I would say that a little over 1 gens worth time would be worth to get rid of such a "drastic" and "overpowered" "game-swinging" perk.
---
3. If it's always a lose-lose how do I always play around it at high ranks and still manage to escape like 66%~ of my games, even when it's not there?
---
4. Killers can't even play around adrenaline it's also a "lose-lose" and have to just get hit in the face with a perk that wastes about 30-40 seconds of killers time, usually on every survivor.
---
5. if it's such an overpowered perk you'd think that it would be used at only the highest of the high ranks right? (since survivors are so good at those ranks). So how come at rank 1 only 6% of killers use it? hint (it's not as OP as you think it is)
---
cross platform on consoles only hopefully
---
This isn‚Äôt even true. My SWF has a rank 2, a rank 3, and two rank 4s, and we have been getting matched with 7-8. However, rank doesn‚Äôt even necessarily denote skill, just an accumulation of points that translate into pips, that can be obtained by doing a lot or by doing the bare minimum. Just because a survivor has a red rank doesn‚Äôt even mean they‚Äôre good. A lot of purple to red rank survivors are absolute trash.
---
How is shaking your head no and hitting the the hooked Survivor once toxic?
---
No one gonna bring up the fact that the hook is through her neck lol
---
Yes it did but it looks  like a very short game and it's in pixel art so I could imagine they would get BHVR to make it more 3d and stuff
---
Bug because you aren't supposed to be Able  to have it while running
---
It's a sign that we could potentially get Cross Play between PC and Console
---
For killers, I can imagine Huntress, and maybe doctor
---
Survivors Claudette, Ace, Kate, Adam, Jeff all seem like they'd be decent matches
---
But obviously the best answer is Dwight and Locker
---
I have unilateral deafness, so I have to be extra eyebally when I hear a heartbeat.
---
Kind of both excited because he was a killer I wanted to play because I'm a huge fan of the NMOES series, but also fearful because I mostly play survivor and he looks like he's gonna have to take some getting use to to go against now. I have a feeling people are gonna complain enough and he's going to be nerfed shortly after release just like what they did to Ghostface.
---
Interesting. Well, I'll remember that and not use it so I don't get used to it once they patch it
---
Why she sad:(
---
There is zero correlation between the day the ranks reset and the day an update happens
---
especially the sniper huntress kill it all
---
No, but I've had more than 1 occasion where I hook a survivor, leave to go grab someone else, and next thing you know someones sitting at a pallet instead of going for a save or trying to get away. I've had a ton of mind game kills because people try to just vault pallets back and forth, same with windows. Also get Myers to T3 from people just waiting for me to come at them to drop the pallet
---
How come sometimes with Doc on console everything goes fine. Plays fine no issues.  And sometimes the framerates so God damn awful I can barely go around a loop and recognize what I'm looking at?
---
I try to imagine there is like a crosshair in the middle of my screen and then kind of aim at him. The camera is kind of wonky. When you stare straight at him when standing still, the camera actually kind of tilts downwards/upwards. You need to train yourself to find what the game considers the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù camera positioning. You have to reposition it to be level and then aim. It‚Äôs very unintuitive but I break him out somewhat consistently now.
---
The first movie was like, the only good one tho. The rest were so cheesy and cringey.
---
Thank you for the reply!
---
While I am sure many people ask for it the large majority isn't warranted or deserved. I haven't gotten so much hatemail in a game since I mained AA tanks in battlefield.
---
I dunno man. I still like BBQ is god-tier on Billy. At least at my ranks I hardly ever see anyone run distortion.
---
Dio Brando Killer when?
---
Vaporizing Freeze those Survivors. Disrespect the Entity and Mori anyway. Call everyone a monkey.
---
It's not that Stands showed up, it's that Hamon was so violently cancelled.
---
I...uhh...huh, sometimes I surprise myself with stupidity. Thanks!
---
You act like a mobile game can even compete with literally any other device version and still maintain performance integrity. It‚Äôs just absurd.
---
There are a lot of artists on various websites (twitter, etsy, and tumblr, sometimes you can contact someone on Patreon) that have art commissions open. It‚Äôs worth a look.
---
I'll get on it
---
not necessarily no, statistics show that the number of swf is relatively low. also its better for a swf to go against a lower rank killer that knows what they are doing. while it sucks to get a swf in red ranks (i play both sides and i know the feel) its worse when its a red and purple with a green rank bullying a green rank killer. swf should not be given the option to bully and should be averaged with a lean towards the lowest rank. 
---
source for swf stats here: [LINK](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests)
---
note that as someone who plays both sides i do play swf with my friend (just 1 typically rarely are 4 people on at once) I am rank 1 they are rank 10. we mostly face rank 10-15 killers with the rare 7 popping up. most dont know how to moonwalk or effectively counter loops which i was forced to learn in my rank unless the killer is smurfing. I am usually decent in chase (tbh im not the best i will get downed) and can get a few gens done with fewer pallets wasted in a single chase. If the killer doesnt know to leave a chase after a certain point then my presence has messed their entire game. 
---
My opinion is that ranking should lean on the lowest survs rank. the killer skill cap is far far higher and harder to learn than the survs. A surv forced into a higher ranking game will have a better chance of learning to loop and evade more than a killer forced into a higher rank will learn how to counter.
---
i hope im not coming across as aggressive, just trying to explain my standing and reasons why.
---
[removed]
---
Well Freddy is being reworked into an entirely different killer very soon (Few weeks? PTB is tomorrow) if that counts.
---
that‚Äôs a much better ship
---

More like 1 meter, to be honest.

Nobody.

Footsteps cant be heard over gen noises, and not every gen will have a sufficient amount of grass to let you react to her.
---
I'm at 6570 shards and level 44 3/4, about how much longer would I need to play to get Kate?
---
It‚Äôs not on their Wikis, it‚Äôs literally just matching skins and a dev playing with the character models. A lot of characters have matching skins. But also, please consider, everyone, they‚Äôre two fictional characters that don‚Äôt exist, which means you can ship them with other people regardless. It‚Äôs really not that complicated.
---
This should be a quintin outfit, then he would be worth playing
---
You nailed it. I said back when I first got DbD that Killers can't really do anything on their own. Their gameplay is predicated on punishing mistakes Survivors make.
---
Perfect Survivors will evade every trap, never be seen, and rush gens in about a minute. Coupled with the fact that most Killers have no way of covering several gens at once (especially with the map size) and SWF's voice chat not being accounted for by the design, Killers are almost all helpless in a theoretical "max skill" scenario, with the best they can do being delaying one group of Survivors by predicting which gens they'll target and posing a threat in that area (but by necessity, not another area in that case).
---
This type of situation is why F13 and White Noise 2 give their Killers teleportation skills.
---
I'd like to note that an interesting band-aid fix would be a multiple-Killer mode, but it's really a core mechanics issue.
---
As a trapper main i approve. Basement hooks are so deadly with the trapper if you boobytrap the shack.
---
It literally has the same function as NOED, just temporary
---
Same.
---
Woah woah woah, are you saying that you can't finish the tutorial because EGC takes out the survivor before you can?
---
Yep
---
I would say shit, but these arguments are all the same, so nah. Believe what you want.
---
Another possibility is that one creepy dude who was in the hospital who attacked Nancy. I think having the demogorgon and the upside down would be the best option.
---
hi, at the time of posting this i will already be dead
---
oh they did. I was at a restraunt on main street after a con let out. "youve got something on your shirt"
---
They probably didn‚Äôt realize the fact that just because it‚Äôs ‚ÄúCaNoN‚Äù (which I mean ~~totally~~ overwhelming amount of evidence am I right? üôÑ) doesn‚Äôt mean it has to be for everyone. Especially in their art. Also poor sally (¬¥¬∞Ã•Ã•Ã•Ã•Ã•Ã•Ã•Ã•œâ¬∞Ã•Ã•Ã•Ã•Ã•Ã•Ã•Ã•ÔΩÄ) make sure to give her my number yo!!
---
I came onto this thread looking to see if it was a bug or not. Its been making my games so unbalanced, I've been having to go wayyy easy on the survivors and drag it out or they just dc early on in the match. Its consistent with every game too and every killer I've played.
---
lets go outside and throw the ball around champ
---
Yeah, but it does lead to that survivor having a terrible experience in the trial because they can't do anything but run for their life the entire time.
---
PrEtTy gOoD jOb So fAr
---
I can't say I'm surprised, but holy shit, how has this not been fixed? EGC has been out for literally months.
---
Thank you for having common sense and understanding where I‚Äôm coming from lol and absolutely, I think she wouldn‚Äôt hate you ; )( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Working on a gen in the game map, heard a huntress slowly approaching so I hid behind some boxes that were close to the gen, so you could probably turn from the gen to look at me. Huntress runs over, kicks my gen and while she's doing that I creep up behind her, she finishes her kicking and manages to turn just enough for me not to body block her. It was probably a good thing I moved when I did cause she immediately went for the boxes before leaving the area. I went right back to the gen. I was rank 10 at the time with a rank 9 huntress, and for most of the game I basically was in very obvious hiding spots, or managing to avoid her hatchets. I lowkey kind of bullied but I didn't mean to.
---
I genuinely think she DCed just to make sure I didn't get escape points, because she DCed right as I hit the exit gate.
---
That'd be the best option but i dont think the devs would do it cause it would lose them money
---
my go to now is spinechill, mettle of man, sprintburst and selfcare
---
For some damn reaso, whenever my brother plays Warith, he gets a 4k. I absolutely hate it as well, he shouldn't get them. It is so frustrating as well, as he plays without camping, or being toxic. The worst he does is accidently find a survivor that is injured. I know this is an accident, as he doesn't know how to follow scratch marks. This is like, rank 9 as well.
---
They said in the dev update that they match swf with killers with the same rank as the host of the swf. So the rank 11 invited them, its honestly really bad game design
---
Thats oddly vivid, yet accurate
---
Just hit the survivor when you hook them.
---
Any time I think survivors are going to be teabagging faggot who think they control the game, I dodge the lobby. Just because they think they are that good I'm not doing it. I'd rather not sweat out the ass.
---
It be like that sometimes
---
That is DEFINITELY a relevant factor. I've seen some decent SWFs up to 3 people at around Rank 15, but I'm STILL tilted from yesterday's 13+ 4-mans. I don't know the exact mechanics of it, but SWF is for sure more toxic than solos of the same level. Maybe because they expect to win, or rather, explicitly set out to.
---
Gen rushing is also a sign of toxicity, which is odd because you would think that's just normal gameplay.
---
Goodnight sweet prince
---
This was like my second game ever with trapper I‚Äôm not familiar with all his stuff. I was in the mindset of see thing hit thing
---
It doesn't matter if the pig gets hit with a ds if the survivor has a RBT
---
Thanks, yea he seems like he could be a lot of fun
---
To be fair I was kinda careless myself lol I stepped in one too
---
 Ah it‚Äôs no problem! And... (‡πëÔΩ•Ãë‚ó°ÔΩ•Ãë‡πë)üíñ I‚Äôm flattered lmao...
---
While cloaked, you have no Terror Radius, nor do you emit the Red Stain. However, you are not entirely invisible, as you still shimmer a bit (like the Predator). While uncloaking, survivors will see you fade back in, as well as hear the loud clanking of the bell. Your Terror Radius and Red Stain will not appear until after you have uncloaked completely. 
---
I'm no Wraith main, but typically if I ever play him I usually just get right up on their asses, then uncloak, or try to uncloak around a corner and use the speed burst you get for a second to get a hit in.
---
Agreed! Decided to play Leatherface since I've been seeing if he was any good or not and it's with him as well. It's been happening every match so far. Been getting gen grabs way too easily as of late. Guess it's a visual bug ‚Ä¢~‚Ä¢
---
r/cursedimages
---
I use a side mouse button, but I've seen some use Left Alt.
---
Pretty much every new killer is a mashup of older killers
---
I‚Äôm with you. I love playing as the doctor, hag, and Myers but feel like I can‚Äôt at higher ranks if I‚Äôm trying to win.
---
Cosplay on point! Even got the finger guns, nice job!
---
I'm still waiting for the Xbox One X enhancements they teased.
---
Just look at the names
---
My Bloodweb‚Äôs been trying to get me to play Leatherface toxic af, but I refuse. It gave me NOED 3, Insidious 3, Monstrous Shrine 3, etc. I guess I have to unless I want to deal with the constant insults. I haven‚Äôt built up a thick skin to them yet, despite being a killer main. I‚Äôm honestly too nice to play killer.
---
Omg look piggy got silver!!
---
I‚Äôve deranked from the Killer leaving. Why does that happen?
---
Old MoM wasn't balanced but as a killer even _I_ see how big of a nerf that was
---
The fact you‚Äôre getting downvoted is hilarious to me
---
I don‚Äôt know what to say. I just want to thank our lord and savior, John Kramer, for this amazing award.
---
Damn
---
Yeah perk feels unusable now. Hopefully once the bad taste of it is gone they take a second look at it.
---
Myers and spirit are fun during rank reset tho because new players can‚Äôt figure out how to counter them in 5 seconds. Like literally with spirit just crouch a lot and with Myers stay in crowded areas so he can‚Äôt see you easy
---
I love wraith je tries his best
---
Same
---
Okay. Devs need to buff shitty killers to make them be the power role. Not nerf survivors.
---
r/cringepics
---
Bought it
---
"Don't move! The Huntress can't see us if we don't... Move..."
---
Also as a Billy main who also sometimes plays
---
Huntress, the perk didn't bother me all that much unless I was having a one-off and playing Myers or Wraith
---
RIP all the console survivors who never had to deal with a PC playing Nurse. haha
---
Timer doesn't go down in chase so that doesn't matter..
---
From where?
---
Playing on The Game gives all killers built-in Bloodhound and there‚Äôs plenty of spots to cut through. 
---
Hillbilly has the top floor which is very open for moving around the map and Huntress doesn‚Äôt especially struggle on that map in my experience.
---
BHVR‚Äôs store for DBD
---
Will there be any way to transfer our account over to the Switch once the game releases? I love the thought of being able to play DBD on-the-go, but I don't see myself buying it again if I have to go through the grind once more.
---
Would speedwagon be the survivor
---
ü§§ü§§ü§§
---
Why yes it is
---
Unless you have Iron Will, pray. That‚Äôs the best way to get away from a GOOD spirit/nurse.
---
Yea I'm just saying there's no point in chasing a Survivor with a bear trap on so you'd never need to worry about ds.  Unless you were going for it on purpose.
---
I mean I agree with that. Not sure what you were expecting here.
---
I‚Äôm actually rank 1 both survivor and killer.
---
I‚Äôve beaten red rank nurses with omega blink. Stop whining and get better at the game
---
If you‚Äôre in an open area, go ahead and uncloak begins them but if you are in a populated object area, it may be better to uncloak around a corner or from a spot they need to run to and go from there.
---
I just recently escaped from rank-20 hell when I found out that I‚Äôm very good with Ghostface, so not really. I‚Äôm also at rank 16.
---
I think that‚Äôs what bothers me the most. I shouldn‚Äôt have to wait till rank reset to play like half the killers lol
---
I am talking about the killers not survivors
---
New killer: **La Chancla**

Missed on purpose Kappa
---
That's just logical to do
---
Exactly, this isn't a hard concept. If you'res CLEARLY trying to be seen and just teabagging or spamming their light at me, you're a god damn distraction. It's really damn transparent. Why the fuck would I chase you and not look around for the other player?  Plus, half the time the person trying to taunt will just end up getting too cocky and will give me a free hit on them anyway when they get a bit too close.
---
So sad
---
Just did a daily, didn't care to win. One minute and a half chase, 3 gens popped. It literally takes zero skill to hold down a button and hit a skill check.
---
Petition to give trapper 3 traps at the start. Would be cool for trapper to actually summon traps instead of walking and then dropping them, or make the speed faster and quieter like how they buffed hag and her power.
---
I was once in a lobby where this one prestige 2 or 3 Meg was named ‚Äú1 Camp 1 Derank‚Äù. I was Ghostface and never camp, but I was just terrified by that. I‚Äôm only a rank 16!
---
Sorry to be the tard here but what is tunneling? I've always heard the term but never figured out what it is.
---
To beat a spirit, you need to out mindgame a spirit. Play her mindgames as mindgames, it's the only way. 
---
Against a nurse, break line of sight. Especially during a blink. If a nurse loses you midblink, it stops the chase right there.
---
Once both gates are open in a match, the chest in the basement respawns with a loaded AK-37, which kills the killer is 90% of the magazine hits them.
---
If the Killer dies, they lose half their rank points, the survivor who killed them gets double his rank points, and gets 8K survival points in an event called Hunted No More.
---
Perfect idea
---
I used to play rank 1 and learned that fun isnt allowed there. I've begun hovering around 10. Still get the occasional try hards, but if you're just there to mess around and have fun, it's a great place.
---
This is a Shitpost, right?
---
Just Disconnect
---
Gens can get done too fast, this is the biggest problem this game has.
---
Thanks. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for just a spot to casually play and mess around with different perks.
---
I recommend the wheel mouse click button
---
You still avoid the 5% regression you wanted counter play there you go
---
It's always nice. I feel like I can actually enjoy the game there instead of every other game being flashlights and squadettes. No problem

That‚Äôs bc survivors are not op as much anymore lol learn to play
---
Id buy it
---
Seagulls are far more fearsom and horrific than any zappy boi or spooky hillbilly. If you think the Hag‚Äôs morning is gruesome, don‚Äôt stand too close to the seagulls.
---
What do you do to stay there just throw some games here and there?
---
Dunno bout the servers, but the chapter should be out in 3 week or so
---
Which is the opposite of balance, only the already high tier killers are unaffected while the shit ones took an extra kick in the balls from every survivor every match.
---
*Everything is legal in the realm of the Entity.*
---
I misread, what do you mean by home? Their realm?
---
Freddy is really good against low ranks. Hes generally considered the worst killer, but hes getting a major rework soon to make him much better (hard to get worse)
---
It would probably be better if Bites the dust wild be called "Bites the Dust" for consistency sake, unless we put in "Sheeru Hearta taku" and "Stray catudes"
---
Its when you focus one survivor just to see them dead. Ignore everyone else and only get that one player. Dont worry, youre not the only one to ask this question.
---
I tend to play the game normally but nicely, but just dont kill anyone. They all get an escape, everyone gets some bloodpoints, and they feel like they earned it instead of farming. Though the occasional ggez almost dissuades me from doing it sometimes.
---
Hey so I‚Äôm fairly new at the game. I understand that every character has 3 specific perks that are teachable to other characters and I also understand that you can unlock the teachable perks starting at level 35. However, my question is whether or not spending all of my bloodpoints on a single character is a bad choice? I have a meg Thomas at 28 and everyone else is at 1-3. Is this a bad move for the long run?
---
And that's why they're incredible! He says stuff like "DON'T DREAM AND DRIVE" and "YOU FORGOT THE POWER GLOVE!" or "WELCOME TO PRIME TIME, BITCH!"
---
Yeah, I think only Azarov Final resting place annoys me.
---
Oh right
---
Good point though. While I do like not dealing with a random sprint burst while in chase survivor definitely takes more focus now and for me is basically hopeless if we see a legacy anything. #Buffweakkillersinsteadofnerfingsurvivors
---
Cool, makes sense. I‚Äôm set to only receive messages from inside my friends list so no worries there lol
---
I'm talking about how the actual perk works. Billy and Huntress are unbothered because they rarely use their basic attacks which is how MoM used to gain tokens. Also Huntress is not high tier by any means. Myers is a much better killer than Huntress
---
Put your foot in the trap and thats me. I am baby trapper with 0 trap awareness
---
They both touched kids tho, one just more clear than the other
---
I should honestly do that, but I've made a few friends through online games like that so I probably wont. What do you play on?
---
Are they doing liscensed characters?
---
You can be a part of my pizza squad anytime.    ;)
---
Silent Wraith is so damn fun, but if the match is not in the game or lery's you'll never get a gen grab.
---
The recent dev update said swf will be matched by average rank soon.
---
If you want it to be
---
Moldy Electrode should just be baseline because you can actually shock most gyms and the shack properly without breathing down their neck. Also if you need to run distressing for half of your power to be slightly more effective, that‚Äôs still a design flaw of the character. Plus distressing doesn‚Äôt help your actual shock therapy so you‚Äôd still need addons for it to not suck.
---
Perfect list, Ino ly think Neansjould be higher because... you know, evading from the cops and stuff, she very likely has experience in... you know... evasion... lol
---
You know, I was perfectly happy *not* imagining that.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox. Funnily enough this was the first game that ever caused me to adjust my settings
---
Yamaoka is a nightmare if you're facing a smart Trapper.
---
Games STILL feel like this for me.
---
Just gen rush 4head
---
I just downloaded it and played it here in the US. Just Google Dead By Daylight Mobile Android download. You'll need to download the APK and the OBB
---
He's fuckin' Bill, dude.
---
Try out the add on that gives survivors the mangled effect every time you sneak attack them. Use it with windstorm and use enduring &amp; spirit fury. Tends to work real well. It‚Äôs like having a constant sloppy butcher without using a perk slot
---
Attacking and assuming rank in this game is just weak. You can drop from rank 1 to 20 by not playing for 2 resets and hit red rank easily by playing nonstop for a week or so and not even good games just consistent play. 
---
If killers getting to one shot everyone and move faster because they let all the gens get popped isn't undeserved then idk what is.
---
You may pip but you're still sacking your pip potential and bp earning by being the dedicated totem guy.  
---
I was already pointing out your hypocrisy with that statement (no counter to Adrenaline).
---
I not only see it in my games rather frequently but also different red rank streamers/youtubers that I watch.
---
Haha. Makes sense. I'm on ps4 or I wouldve sent mew a friend request. Maybe if cross console ever gets added though. Hope rank 10 works out!
---
Soon, they said when dedicated servers are in they will add a queue lock to people who DC.
---
I am rank 6 survivor on the console. Every game now is just us doing gens and avoiding killers, and that is boring af.
---
The fun part is getting chased
---
Yes I am pretty sure the devs have said on stream that the entity takes them back to there realm so Myers goes back to his world huntress goes back to her world and so on only to be called from once again for a new match. Although I guess the ones that are tortured prob do not get that special treatment
---
Highly doubt dedicated servers are coming with the mid update.  As for the timing, probably 2 weeks.
---
More and more games seem to be going that way so hopefully this one will too. Thanks for the advice!
---
Tbh the survivor would probably be like a Indiana Jones type or something
---
He said in the video that he likes to miss on purpose if he knows they're gonna get trapped.
---
üòÇ
---
If you think killers need a nerf then you haven‚Äôt played this game
---
Someone suggested that the person who cleanses the totem is ‚Äúcursed‚Äù and therefore they suffer from the effects of the Hex at the expense of lifting it from everyone else
---
Who even heals up these days. The issue with a rush meta is that everyone just plows through gens and hopes adrenaline will carry them out the gate.
---
No problemo. I hope cross console just becomes a thing that all games do. It would really bridge the gap of the stupid console war and would allow more people to play together
---
This killer was playing with 0 Volume, you can easily hear a downed survivor on the floor moaning. You don't need to look around like that, and with Head phones the moans are Crystal Clear where you are.
---
I'm crazy, so I get every killer :D
---
Would also help queue times here I would imagine
---
Guns are boring maybe force them into a guillotine somehow
---
Oh definetly. On more games than just DbD
---
Mine?
---
Agreed. Here‚Äôs to hoping
---
No, it's not a bad idea. I am not a veteran by any means, but Meg has really good perks: adrenaline and sprint burst. By leveling her up right away, you can have her perks be the first teachable perks you get and makes it more likely for your other survivors to get them in their bloodwebs since Meg's perks will be the only other perks you can learn.
---
Although, to be honest, it all depends on what you want to do at the end of the day.
---
Spirit's looks hella sick
---
Again you only play survivor so I won't argue with you any more since it's like screaming at a brick wall.
---
And again again NOEDs reward is deserved because the survivors discarded side objectives to focus on generators which they ultimately got punished for.
---
Comment thread Closed
---
I can even hear him saying it.
---
"I see tis, as an ahbsolute **win**...
---
Otz is so great
---
Just wanted to make sure it won‚Äôt detriment me later on. Thanks a ton!
---
I got that for my boyfriend last year and it took forever to get here.
---
Way better than I could ever do. I dig it.
---
With spirit use iron will or be unpredictable to outmindgame her. With nurse break LoS and pray she makes a incorrect prediction. You cant beat a good nurse and spirit is similarly difficult.
---
I mean they didn't tell you to "kill yourself Nword" so I'd say that was pretty tame trash talk for post game. But maybe pc post game has just jaded me where anything short of a kill yourself or a racial/homophobic slur doesn't even register.
---
I think they meant you can only loot once
---
...did you read his post? He thinks the weak killers need a buff rather than nerfing survivor perks.
---
Sexy Grampa
---
Why do I always lag when activating bloodlust?
---
I'm a survivor main and I still think this. I always counter it just by destroying the totems.
---
 It HaS a BaTtLe PaSs ThAt MeAnS iTs FoRtNiTe!!!!!!!!!
---
Insanely good
---
Bruh, trapper with no upgrades can only hold one beat trap. The fuck
---
The best times being Rank 20, Stay in those Ranks, you won't have fun moving up.
---
6 to 10 is chill. Lower than 10 is half tryhards that deranked for ez wins half potatoes and half swfs with some rank 1s with some rank 20s
---
So the fixed it? it's been non-functional for a while
---
Killer mains only read what they want to read. 
---
Nothing they say or think is truly based on reality.
---
Console? Basically the game has a set number of things preloaded but too many lags you out. The solution is to have some stuff not pre-loaded, but when that happens there‚Äôs gonna be a little lag and for some reason bloodlust is one of those things. At least that‚Äôs what McLean said on stream a while ago, I can‚Äôt say whether it‚Äôs right
---
Someone got into peoples heads that cleansing vs her is bad because of Corrupt purge‚Äôs lethality but in reality that‚Äôs why the devs made Iridicent Seal and other addons that give you corrupt purge because people would rather play No Mither than play against running to an open pallet or window like the Huntress.
---
It does seem to imply you have a lot of underlying baggage.
---
Seeing as how I don't know you though, whether you have baggage or not is none of my concern. Have a nice day venting on reddit.

---
Not that much of a disadvantage between the two, unlike most console shooters and similar genres.
---
Killers on console are at somewhat of a disadvantage compared to killers on PC, but survivors are basically the same on both platforms.
---
If they see you then wait until you can bodyblock a pallet, if they don‚Äôt then I cloak around a corner. If they‚Äôre in the open then uncloak as close as possible and watch out for 360‚Äôs
---
Depends on the ping, if it‚Äôs a high ping game already (and sometimes it‚Äôs a lot higher in game than in the lobby) combined with the stress Doctor puts on consoles it can create a lot of lag. Bane of my existence as an Xbox gamer
---
But the poor map design though
---
Robert England Freddy killed kids not rape them if I remember.
---
Remake Freddy raped them and sometimes didn't kill them.
---
That actually sounds cool. It would be really cool to actually have an end. Not many play Dead by Daylight for the story so I don't think people would be mad if it ended. I do think it would be cool to have an end. Probably not anytime soon though.
---
Nerfing survivors just makes the already strong killers even stronger for no reason.
---
This is so true for me, but mainly because the add-on display screen will shut off my PS4 via overheat. I have to dash back to the controller in time to hit the PS button to avoid the crash.
---
Oh okay thank you for clarifying
---
Put him on one side of the screen, it‚Äôs a safety giggle shape. Anything in the ‚Äúnose‚Äù of the goggles won‚Äôt detect him, and anything outside won‚Äôt either. Look slightly to the side
---
If anything its a cool concept
---
Are you on PS4? I think its only a problem on PS4.
---
How you gonna put Tapp over Laurie?
---
It‚Äôs like a 1% bonus or something. McLean said on stream that the bonus is too small to detect
---
How do I disable certain tags in the subreddit? I.e. how do I block 'shitposts'?
---
Lmao that would be funny as hell
---
Ah ok! Thank you
---
R1 Plague here. I've basically got her maxed and have played many hours with her without using addons. I find great success with Thanata, pop, ruin, and bbq. I don't think she really needs chase perks because of the broken status effect she has, and if they cleanse you already are a more powerful huntress. Knowing your mindgames and hiding your red light are key. Knowing when to commit to a chase is also key.
---
I'm the kind of player that has 186 salty profile comments because I play "scummy." In my opinion, I think that a killer should do whatever it takes to get the most efficient 4k barring exploiting and hacking. That's just me.
---
Freddy ptb is tomorrow. Released a week or two later
---
I see survivor I chase survivor, most of the time it doesn't even register which one it is. If it's you multiple times in a row that just means you're bad at stealth.
---
How many totems spawn in total? Is it different depending on the map?
---
Agreed. Killer‚Äôs apprentices usually last awhile.
---
Why is Jane lower than Dwight?
---
1. 5 generators
---
2. Accordingly the road map it definitely isn‚Äôt planned for this year.
---
100%, reminds me a lot of the objective markers in Overwatch which later got their own opacity slider
---
You aren‚Äôt coming across as aggressive to me at all, and I actually agree with you for the most part. 
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main myself and definitely agree that if my friend (green rank) and I (red rank) are playing SWF we should play against a red rank killer.
---
? It's just an expression. I don't care about karma, I just look at it in principle, little kids hitting a button because they disagree.
---
I personally think the current recharge rate is fine  I feel when I get it back is relatively convenient.
---
Cause her inhumanly gigantic ass would slow her down.
---
I didn‚Äôt think someone could assume so many things in one sentence
---
Quick &amp; Quiet and Iron Will
---
And Jeff‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt?
---
PC
---
Hey 4 is really close to 5. You kinda sound like a prick.
---
Sounds neat I feel like that would be a really big event though. Seeing as the current lore kinda is supposed to let there be a reason for endless games but I think it would be cool.
---
That beard helps with being aerodynamic
---
Saw a few comments here about Iron Will but why Quick and Quiet?  Just hope they don't really find you essentially with that perk equipped?
---
Yes. I even see it as a survivor as well. Ps4
---
I'd use it just for the extra BP. I'm never gonna be a low rank killer, I recognize that
---
I see this repeated a lot on this sub and my tinfoil hat conspiracy is that it's always vommy mommy mains peddling it to make survivors in their games stay loud and exposed.
---
K o b e
---
Just like NOED. Yet only one of them got nerfed.
---
Is there a way to post pictures in ‚Äúcomments‚Äù?   I‚Äôm sorta new to reddit.  And if so I can show you that Plague is one of my Level 1 killers.  If any killer I‚Äôm a spirit main. But mostly I‚Äôm a survivor main.
---
When you flame somebody for just trying to correct them
---
I‚Äôm not sure how other game modes work. It‚Äôs how the game has always been, and BHVR devotes their time to new releases and patches instead of adding new game modes.
---
I don‚Äôt play overwatch, but that could honestly save 20% of my rage towards this game.   The rest of it comes from other players XD
---
Yes it‚Äôs doing it with EVERY aura. I‚Äôve seen them through Gens and even HOOKS from across map.   I saw someone on my totem yesterday too.
---
That‚Äôs straight up fucked
---
okay, but tell me why you look like Puppers when he cosplays as Ace.....
---
Alright well I do not have Iron will yet but I will get here soon hopefully
---
100
---
I don‚Äôt know what you mean the guy claims that it would be stupid to nerf killers. Why would he want that if he was a killer main?
---
You're using noed tho. You deserve all that and more
---
You can fast vault into a locker or over windows and pallets while Spirit is phasing and you can somewhat counter them, bonus points if you put on Lithe and haul ass away from immediate danger
---
If you scroll down on the right side of the screen you'll see text saying "Don't like memes?" and then below that it should say "Equip Hex: Memeless Mode" you should be able to click on that and you'll be good.
---
Even if the player isn't quite as good as some others, they can still be entertaining like HybridPanda. He's not necessarily going for a 4k every game, but he laughs off the mistakes and plays really nice towards the survivors but still has fun and that makes it fun to watch.  The biggest no-nos for me personally is attitude toward the game and other players.  There's a certain popular twitch streamer (he plays survivor) and is generally just very rude for the sake of it and isn't open to any form of criticism.  That makes it unwatchable for me. 
---
Overall for making content that I like to see, I would say be good at the game. If you can't be good, then be funny. If you are spiteful/seem to not enjoy playing, then it's not going to be good regardless how skilled or funny you are.
---
Yep makes sense but at times Spirit just comes out of nowhere when I am working on a gen or healing an ally.  With a Nurse though its not enough to just crouch behind a barrier, so you just have to hope there is a jungle gym of sorts to run through right?
---
It‚Äôs fair in my opinion. You get to put people in exposed while in NS and your terror radius and stain are immediately suppressed as soon as you use it. Also, the survivor who knocks you out of it is shown to you, it‚Äôs basically a win-win. For how many uses it has though, Night Shroud cooldown is pretty fair

Greens
---
And honestly he doesn‚Äôt require THAT much to be infinitely better than he is right now. Make Moldy and Maple Knight base kit and take out the slowdown during charging. 
---
Take out Scrapped Tape effect, the cone to a ring addon, and change it to Basic Attacks on Survivors in Tier 3 are afflicted with either Broken, Blindness, or Deafened until they Snap Out Of It and bump the rarity from yellow to green. 
---
Easy.
---
it‚Äôs just super toxic. get out before you binge and play dbd for weeks
---
I am getting better at the mindgame aspect with other killers but against Nurse/Spirit I need to practice that as good players really tear any team I am with apart.
---
This would be amazing but Kate=Daphne
---
I think it's more of the fact that I stated I was new and just misstyped the # as I wasn't really focused. Still I appreciate the correction no need for anyone to get mad at each other. I appreciate the sticking up for me as well! So they don't plan to add more game-modes yet? That's sad :(
---
As an ace main, you're breathtaking! Great work.
---
Okay sorry I was just trying to make sure you had your facts right. I don‚Äôt want to anger anyone.
---
What is the best way to break line of sight against nurse?  I came across a really good player that just knew where I was going when going through a jungle gym with windows pallets etc.  Have yet to get Ace yet but heard good things about Iron Will so I will try that out when I unlock it eventually.
---
Is two weeks straight too late or do I still have a chance
---
Best reply right here lol
---
If your account gets restricted, the logical thing to do is to make another one. Weird concept, I know.

DBD in 1 image
---
What does Lithe do and thanks for the suggestions.
---
Whoops forgot the question mark
---
What's amazing to me is how people post this exact shit dozens of times a day.
---
There should be a beach based map with seagulls instead of crows and one of the "walls" could be the shore line.
---
I feel like if there is a real out cry they might I still want a legal mode where there are two killers and 6-8 survivors.
---
Lithe is a Sprint Burst that activates when you vault a window or pallet. It's a Feng Min teachable
---
Well that is definitely a good step
---
Although I very much appreciate that (expessially a good company) just worried about future playability. Then again it has carried them for quiet a while now.
---
Also would be fun! Or kinda like Friday the 13th where you can "fight" back?

Shirtless David cosplay when?
---
Xbox survivor main. I usually appear offline but will get the invites. I play casually but I always at least try to win. This game is a lot of fun as long as the teammates aren‚Äôt purposefully dumb. Add me
---
Murdockter
---
That‚Äôs the entire purpose of the flashlight ? What‚Äôs the point of it being in the game ?
---
It's a dumb glitch were you can't leave
---
Forget about it, move on and get better so you can punish swf with the nurse.
---
Getting salty and trying to camp toxic survivors will only hinder your development as a killer. As well as using Noed. This is the reason you see so many shitty killers in red ranks it‚Äôs because they rely too much on noed and camping so naturally they‚Äôll be shitty at chases and make poor choices throughout the match. 
---
Also they watch tru3ta1ent. His shitty biased rants make his viewers believe that they‚Äôre victims and that survivors are worse than Hitler so they result to camping and using Noed. I will get dowmvoted for this but I really want people to wake the fuck up, tru3 is the most toxic streamer in DBD and he claims he isn‚Äôt, and it‚Äôs a fact that players with a little bit of experience stop watching him because he‚Äôs not that good. He‚Äôs average.
---
As an ex nurse main I promise you it‚Äôs part of the game. Move on to your next match and think about what you could‚Äôve done better.
---
Tip: Face an obstacle nearby when picking up a survivor so that they can‚Äôt reach your eyes with the flashlights. (You can‚Äôt blind from the sides)
---
And look up as soon as the pick up animation is complete.

---
I'm sorry, I can't hear you over every hook on the map being sabotaged to 99% at once.
---
Great!
---
I wish they would have a group of developer *purposefully* get to high ranks and play regularly. Or at least hire someone to do it. They need to understand what its like playing at higher ranks.
---
Hmmmm you seem to have more killers rules, so inta heals are not the equivalent of noed ?
---
No map pressure at all
---
But you claimed that killer mains only read what they want to read so why would he want to read that?
---
I say, that‚Äôs my baby and I‚Äôm proud
---
I would...definitely not buy this game again, but a rework would be fantastic. At the absolute least, they should try to phase in an alternative style of gameplay.
---
I do agree with both of your points, though. Ideally, Survivors' objectives will be dynamic, not just something no-skill and easy to rush through.
---
And emblems seem...disastrous currently. With their 16 additional XP and associated low BP caps.
---
PS4-bustinout20. Want some people to just chill and play with when my normal SWF buddies aren‚Äôt on.
---
Insta heals don‚Äôt bother me, when I play killer. I‚Äôm used to adrenaline and things of that nature. The only other rule I can think of as a survivor would be, to not body block hooks. Because. That shouldn‚Äôt be a thing.
---
I hope you enjoy your ban /s
---
So a m1 killer that gives survivors 99% of an item and then they play regularly idk man
---
I feel like tactics such as Gen rushing are viable, it‚Äôs definitely frustrating as a killer but a well organized team takes skill. It seems like there‚Äôs always 1-2 forheads on the team that drag the other two with them
---
please put more effort in next time
---
Great Job buddy!! Welcome to the club!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ80PbfYwtU
---
But yeah, I always did my best to avoid camping or tunnelling, gave the last Survivor the gates, and then two consecutive toxic SWFs hit me like a ton of bricks and I've kind of gone sour on the game as a whole for now.
---
no, you cant hear me cuz im using iron will and calm spirit
---
When I win with 4-5 occasionally 3 gens almost every game, I think I' doing it right
---
Hiding from the killer? No way!! Almost like he was avoiding you so he wouldn‚Äôt get killed
---
This sprint burst upgrade is our of control!!
---
And that's why I hate SWF now.
---
I wouldn't even call that camping as it doesn't make sense to let them off the hook ^^^^^haha scott free. If I see someone heading/around the hook, I'm going for them
---
He looks like young Eric Foreman from That 70's Show and it upsets me every time I look at his face
---
I don't use adrenaline and even if I did I would have to work for it. Next!
---
It's super safe for survivors to loop around. 3 pretty safe buildings + killer shack. If you are not a potato, m1 killer is gonna cry a lot. Hag, spirit and nurse can do something about that map, every other killer is fucked.
---
Well people post it because it‚Äôs either unfair games or too easy lobbys that people play against so they just want to complain with others who‚Äôve shared this experience
---
How dare you take this footage of me playing Survivor without consent?
---
Dead Hard and Ruin
---
This isn‚Äôt a tracing, I have multiple steps of my progress for the picture. I just joined this group so I never seen the image you are referencing. If you could link me I‚Äôd love to see it!
---
If there isn't a wall nearby just slug them and guard the body. If they want to be all over you fine make them pay the old fashioned way. Also Franklin's helps.

It was perfect in its second buff with safe hook rescues that‚Äôs where they should of left the perk
---
as a new player myself (grabbed the game+a couple packs on steam sale last week),thank you for that tip.
---
Probably the 3 and the 20 were a SWF and it balanced out to get you. They need to lean swfs like that towards the higher rank, not try to balance out in the middle.
---
*Lunges*
---
‚ÄúMusic chime plays‚Äù
---
Okay but why
---
Tbh depends what type of hiding, if youre sneaking around the killer and still doing stuff than its fine but being a p3 claidette and sitting at the bery corner if the map waiting for someone to open the gate...
---
It‚Äôs not really skill when the game spawns two survivors together right next to a generator across the map,
---
NOED - You know why.
---
Hex: Ruin - You know why.
---
Urban Evasion - Can be useful, but god when teammates overuse it I want to die...
---
Sprint Burst - Same reasoning as above.
---
TLDR these are not Perks I'm picking for the health of the game, but because they annoy me and I'd very much like to never see them again lmao.
---
I mean we don‚Äôt know the situation here OP could of assumed that he never saw him the whole game he was hiding. But I see what you mean.
---
That sounds amazing would love to see it, but what would happen if he got in a locker with a survivor when teleporting?
---
new spirit skin: the passed gambler
---
Her face is me opening the fridge to find out were out of string cheese
---
Decisive Strike, I dont care what version it legitimately rewards fucking up either by you ( the old version) or your team (the new one). And for killers probably NOED although I think the term " reworked so hard it only has the name in common" is a better way of putting it. Make it a totem like ruin but have it make gems slower for each unfinished gen. Let killers slow the game down and give survivors something to do besides gen rush.

depends. can you just stop playing or do you have to force yourself?
---
WHY DOES THE LAST PERSON THING I'M GOING TO UNHOOK THEM IN STRUGGLE PHASE WHEN THE FUCKING WRAITH WHO IS SITTING NEARBY HAS FUCKING NOED, THUS DENYING ME THE HATCH, JUST FUCKING STOP TAPPING FOR A SECOND, BUT NOOOO, YOU GOTTA FUCK ME OVER CAUSE I COULD ESCAPE, BUT YOU DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO OPEN A FUCKING DOOR OR ANYTHING WHEN THERE WAS 3 ALIVE, WHAT THE FUCK
---
I like this idea, but I think it would be cool to have Dwight's physical appearance be tampered with by the entity, like spirit or trapper
---
That‚Äôs probably your best bet
---
Huh, what if I'm a rank 4 but have never seen this map as 'super safe'??? idk maybe it's a console thing but we are just not the looping kind
---
Huntress is more then capable
---
Green ranks are more laid back but you still play against competent survivors. Purple &amp; red ranks usually have sweaty survivors running meta perks
---
Stray Cats a neat idea
---
I do think it's an amazing idea, Scooby Doo is my favorite cartoon so I'd love to see this!!
---
It depends on the killer
---
I normally play a couple hours in a day before needing a break. I can play like that for about a week before I need a hardcore break. The only time I will play hours on end every day is when there is an event or Bloodhunt.

Franklin's demise for killer, nothing is worse than being screwed out of something i spent bp on. if you want my item sacrifice me, dont use a stupid perk to steal it
---
dead hard for survivor, unlike every other exhaustion perk it doesnt need anything to proc it(or you can actually run if compared to sb) and unlike any other exhaustion perk you can fuck it up and still get use from it(cuz lol iframes). i feel it gives way too much for what it is if used properly.
---
Why would you do that to your friend? Poor guy has no idea what he's in for.
---
If I made a game and spent my working life working on it the last thing I'd want to do is play it on top of that. Balancing  had hardly been bad lately
---
I'm not surprised you were banned, your not entitled to be in their chat
---
That‚Äôs also what I‚Äôve been doing so at least I know it works. I just like to play the game without trying too hard and just have fun, I‚Äôm not noob3 caliber but I‚Äôm definitely better than most players I‚Äôve encountered
---
Couldn't have said it better
---
Never use something you'd get salty over if it was used on you
---
Just stop playing please killer queue times are so long why waste lobbies if you dont enjoy playing
---
Summarized my entire post in a nutshell
---
Or maybe just dont do things to get it restricted to begin with...you know, like an emotionally stable and well adjusted human being.
---
Nothing wrong with a Deliverance Kobe right in front of a fellow survivors face
---
I had a game earlier today where a swf got my net down for quite a bit (it wasn't the service provider I checked and no one else said their net was down and it's not a small service provider) and usually it's only down a few minutes. They were the kind of swf that tbagged at pallets and it was sorta funny when it happened because I was kind of expecting it seeing as I slugged one of them because I saw one of their scratch marks and they seemed like the extremely salty type of SWF.
---
Just dont kill 3 or 4 mans with flashlights lol
---
Hard on "Very rare Jane Romero Perk"
---
Badham is awful for killers, if you got Balanced Landing you don't need pallets and even without it you can run a killer around for ages.
---
just know you're always gonna have rough matches no matter the rank or how you play, good luck in the fog.
---
Solo survivor is awful. The game would be dead
---
For me, it's people who can hold againts the killer for some time, knows the loops and how to exploit them, don't play immersed are not afraid to stay injured, can power through ruin.
---
As I said, if you never reached red ranks with a killer, you won't see an issue. You have to play as killer and see how much bullshit where is in a game.
---
That's a fairly large oof
---
Hey I bought this game for summer sale and im still pretty new but ive done some research. I was wondering if anyone had any tips for pig and just some of your personal builds. Also what is tunneling?
---
Feng mains are scumbags 100% of the time lol
---
The biggest buff I desire as a red rank trapper player is the ability to reset traps without having to pick them up. If they want me to walk all over the map to collect my traps fine, but please just let me reset them without having to set another down first. It's just so dumb.
---
I mean learn how to play. Nurse should have no trouble killing  everyone. She ignores all mechanics
---
atm i only stop playing when im tired really. I think its because i just started playing though since i have a habit of doing this with every game and then playing only every now and then
---
Imagine doing gens in 2019.
---
yeah, it‚Äôs also actually really nice that he‚Äôs as good as he is. he can make reliable tier lists and offer good information for newer players (like myself). I usually watch his second channel on YouTube because even if I don‚Äôt have the same kind of perks he can use, I can see what higher level killers do that can be cheeky
---
Otzdarva is a fucking treasure
---
I use a side mouse button as well. You want to have it on a button that you can hit without using the fingers you need for WASD. Since you need left pinky for sprint, that pretty much limits you to left-alt, or a mouse button. Another option is to bind it to spacebar, and rebind the skillcheck to a different button.
---
I‚Äôm down to get my ass kicked! Add me! I always learn more from a hard killer because you look back and go ‚Äúshould have done that‚Äù and it improves the next match. Sometimes it‚Äôs shit luck. But you can always improve  I think.
---
so many times I've gotten kills like that, I think I have at least 4 separate screenshots from games where I've just sat in basement as they file in and give me a free 4k.
---
I was playing Doctor and had what must have been a group of 3 or a group of 2 that were both red ranks. I got destroyed and only managed to hook 1 guy after the last gen popped. Instead of just escaping, all 3 of them swarmed the hook and I didn't give it up. 1 would try and bait me away from it and others laid in wait for the save. That didn't happen. It was a long and drawn out process but I eventually slugged all 3, killed 3, and the last crawling survivor got the hatch because I lost them.
---
I would normally never camp but today I played a few games with people who turned out to be higher ranks, I am hovering around 11-10, and I only manage to get 1 kill or 2 if I'm lucky. If it wasn't for me feeling like I was being bullied by a coordinated team, I wouldn't have to camp for one lousy kill.
---
You are correct, why the downvotes? Do survivors not have to work for adrenaline? 
---
What's with all this NOED = Adrenaline false equivalency? NOED is given to you if you are losing whereas survivors need to be winning for Adrenaline to ever activate. They're literal opposites. Adrenaline is insurance while NOED is an entire gameplan
---
Yeah man and I‚Äôm down for playing against you as killer or playing as survivor and learning more together. Sounds like a lot of fun. Add me gamertag in post.
---
Alright mate where you from I‚Äôm currently staying in the Middle East for work
---
Huh okay with regards to Ace.  I know what you mean about Rank 20 survivors as I have been playing a lot of survivor so far but whenever I jump over to killer I get 3k-4k fairly easy so far because they play so weirdly that its either really easy to track them or they do the stupidest stuff that just makes you think why did you just run right in front of me.
---
Oh welp looks like I am going to level up Feng Min after Meg I think her name is
---
&gt; my friends on Xbox could join my SWF lobby on PC
---
=
---
&gt; they are not allowed to queue to go against non-PC survivors
---
And why would you be allowed to queue against non-PC killers?
---
I hope cross play doesn't happen 'til there's equal framerates on all platforms (which will probably never happen).
---
Monto would like to know your location
---
This sub legit needs to chill and change.
---
Yeah it's been there for the past few patches.
---
I‚Äôm in the USA, Northwest. With the time difference we probably won‚Äôt always be able to link up, but I‚Äôm a night owl (it‚Äôs about morning for you now right?). So depending on when you play we can maybe work something out. I play in the morning a lot sometimes too if you are a night owl as well.
---
I‚Äôm sayin
---
Removed - Please use the weekly Campfire Meetings thread or r/dbdLFG
---
Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe . sorry i just to lol !
---
I just hate Adrenaline because it ALWAYS loves to proc right after I down a survivor and before I can pick them up, usually with the entire team injured and all 4 have it. Usually the one downed might be the McLoopyPants who managed to loop me for 5 gens, FINALLY downed the fucker, and ZOOM! off he goes. 
---
I vividly remember a Doctor game where this happened, and I was so pissed I simply rushed over to the exit gate, opened it to start the collapse, and faced a wall while 4 Claudettes were flashlight spamming and teabagging for 90% of the collapse. 
---
In terms of my reply I was just bringing up the "You deserve it for running NOED" remark. I don't use NOED besides on Freddy for end-game builds because I hate the aspect of dedicating a perk slot for end-game when you could use a different perk for an advantage throughout the game and not hit end-game to begin with. It's a perk. I don't see anyone as deserving of something for running certain builds besides Old MoM + Decisive + Deliverance + Dead Hard with an Instaheal. That shit was cancer but I found out the joys of the One Punch Freddy build which countered it.
---
I mean, Ryu sucks in street fighter v ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
They should rework it, getting an extra hit in any scenario is near impossibly hard to balance nor would it ever feel fair.
---
No. For me.
---
This was the first vid I watched of him, and I'm glad to see him on reddit so soon.
---
He is pretty chill, and quite adept at the game.
---
Brave of you to post a screenshot with NOED in it
---
But if they did that, newer people wouldnt be guided by their better friends any more because they get killers, which are definitely too skilled for newbies. I Think its pretty good as it is ;)

What was her rank? Maybe she was a new player. 
---
I just started out 2 weeks ago and have to say I was pretty scared to do anything in the beginning.
---
Doing gens and not hitting skill checks made me feel like an idiot and i got flamed a lot for it.
---
What's the link for your steam profile?
---
I don‚Äôt really mind about time but he thing is about if it‚Äôs playable mate :/ as a lot of people can‚Äôt play Over 200 ping and I‚Äôm pretty sure there is a subreddit for swf and kyf
---
No.  If anything, the best way to level up your characters is to focus on one at a time.  Get Meg to level 40 so then everyone else can learn her 3 unique perks.
---
Mine??
---
If you're doing Meg for Sprint Burst, just be aware that both Lithe and Sprint Burst are exhaustion perks so you'd have to wait for the exhaustion to wear off
---
That‚Äôs the plan
---
She‚Äôs dummy thicc and the clap of her ass cheeks keeps alerting the killer
---
SPOILERS: that's what happens to every character when you Prestige
---
I‚Äôm a rank 2, she was in red ranks!  I know stealthy is a playstyle and that‚Äôs completely fine. But to not do gens is another thing. To watch us die on hook bc you‚Äôre so scared.... freaking sucks.
---
deliverance on Claudette... no she was not a new player
---
That‚Äôs just a lot of stuff. Killer perks that affect all survivors are also issue
---
Don't think so.
---
I dont think this is what you should settle on, it looks like 2 layers of yellow spray paint, and it's not even translucent
---
It is slightly annoying that I have to walk at times with Meg if I want to save the sprint burst for after a gen is done or the killer begins chasing me.  I will keep that in mind thank you.
---
Pigs rise up!

Ok guy

---
I mean yeah, you can't really say any other killer has a power which benefits them in pretty much no ways.
---
Spirit is stressful for me at high ranks so I have to derank to get kills or bring a full ez win build. In lower ranks it's way too easy to get kills so it's boring. There's never a middle if you aren't a god
---
Sry dont know what deliverence is ... ! Only played Claudette and dwight so far ... hehe
---
See, when you play against potato players, all killers are viable, amazing even. Playing a trapper against SWF should be classified as masochism :(
---
It's been like that since day 1 man. If you guys wanna flail your arms, go right ahead. Were gonna assume you mean you are being camped and we will ignore you.
---
I'm rank three survivor and got into a game with two rank 20 survivors and a rank 16 survivor with a rank 12 killer :( I feel your pain
---
The game will probably be heaps better by then so it‚Äôs really the greatest gift!
---
Why are the signatures different from spirit and these. And why is her style changing so fast.
---
not cleansing is how your whole team dies instantly
---
Sometimes. Keep in mind she can see scratch marks, bush movement, and hear sounds when in haunting. Something many players don't realize at first is that she still has collision in haunting, which good spirits will use to search for you in a loop.  
---
  
---
It's less about technique, and more about mind games. If she phases at a loop she will likely try to find you with player collision or swing for the pallet. Sometimes you can just start walking directly away from the loop as soon as she phases. It's only really worth doing if you are close enough to another loop, since it doesn't buy you a lot of time to move, but it can work. Usually it works at a thrown pallet, since generally survivors try to vault the pallet and make her guess which side they are on.
---
You shouldn't be trying to lose her entirely during a phase, unless you are running a build to counter her. If you want to try that run Quick and Quiet, Dance With Me, Lithe, Iron Will.
---
Not even stalking, i just browse new and remembered the name.
---
Also let trolls troll? Nah.
---
I really didn't like Will this season not gonna lie. He felt so needy and the fact that it took him so long to accept that the others were growing up was just childish. I don't care if you've almost died on multiple occasions, chill TF out son.
---
What happens if you message him?
---
Fr it was you?
---
Oh he just stays quiet, hasn't talked to me ever since the strawpoll went live
---
Yes, a group they routinely ignore. I've watched vids with true explaining the things he's said to devs only for them to make excuses.
---
FOOKIN Y E E T E D
---
Look at this guy, having friends.
---
I could see them sort of make this work with the canon by doing this with his lore or bio or whatever that explains how there‚Äôs a Dwight killer on the loose, here‚Äôs an example of what I mean
---
Example
---
*As Dwight whimpered with a hook through his chest, he thought something... something vile. He envisioned himself, being removed from the hook by the entity itself, as it gave him a strange object, sharp enough to cut through flesh and blunt enough to maim. He couldn‚Äôt help but imagine how amazing it would feel to take revenge on the many monstrosities within the Fog... but he knew inside this wasn‚Äôt right, this would only bring him to lose his mind faster... but it was so tempting he grabbed it by instinct and not by choice. Finally he woke up back at the campfire, feeling... emptier than usual.*
---
Basically, I‚Äôm saying the instinctual rage in him separated from him and is now serving the entity, while the original him deals with the same old stuff, but with an extra spice of having to evade himself since there‚Äôs a killer Dwight now.
---
Ideas for his abilities
---
Broken hook weapon (uses it like a sickle)
---
Instantly downs survivors who were on the hook. (doesn‚Äôt work if 3 seconds pass after they escape hook)
---
borrowed time is ignored.
---
His heart
---
Reveals survivor‚Äôs auras as (reference to his ‚Äúbond‚Äù perk) but it only works if the survivor is performing any action (with nearby survivors, only one survivor has to be performing an action) excluding hiding in lockers and vaulting.
---
works for 5 seconds on survivors who just got out of a chase regardless of wether they are performing an action (does not require other survivors to be nearby)
---
The pulse is around 3 sideways lockers long. (I don‚Äôt know how long a meter is so I can‚Äôt specify the perks he has that affect his heart)
---
Has a cooldown of 3 seconds.
---
Is one of the slower killers and takes longer to get out of pallet stun but makes up for it with a flashlight immunity.
---
Perks (none are teachable)
---
**Bait enthusiast**
---
in exchange for borrowed time functioning properly and thus negating his weapon‚Äôs gimmick, he gets a 10% speed boost for 3 seconds instead. (15% at perk level 2, 25% at perk level 3)
---
Description explains how enraged he feels knowing someone has rescued his prey yet glows with excitement knowing they just fell into his trap where he gets angry and thus faster, and thus can catch his current target much more easily, as if the hooked person was just a worm waiting for fish to bite.
---
**Heartfelt presence**
---
His heart gains an increase in range but takes longer to recover from cooldown.
---
Description has something to do with him feeling someone there, except this time he‚Äôs the one hunting it.
---
**Replacement required**
---
Can replace sabotaged and successful sacrifice hooks (once at perk level 1, twice at perk level 2, three times at perk level 3. Takes 2 seconds to repair)
---
Description brings up how he learned to fix hooks to outsmart the wisest survivors who expect to use the removed hook locations to wriggle out of his grasp if they get caught.
---
Yes! This would go well with my idea for a pirate captain killer with a first mate survivor where the mutiny went horribly wrong and the ship was beached on an island in the fog.
---
I heard this picture.
---
credit to u/littlefirespade for the haha funny epic xd sound effects, the gameplay was me though
---
*accidentally*
---
My favorite part is when he was trying to save face after getting spun by saying "sometimes I miss hits on purpose". Sure you do buddy lol
---
That's shitty :/ Sorry I can't help. /r/giftofgames would also be a good place to request
---
Agreed but all the homo here lol
---
Yeah it sucks, thanks for the referral I'll check it out
---
Enjoy it until the green ranks.
---
I had fun at first, too :(
---
Seems like you‚Äôre dozing trying to type this comment.
---
but the homo makes it *gay*
---
As a killer who farmed during the blood hunt event and accidentally sacrificed someone because I forgot he was already hooked twice.. sorry :( it was an honest mistake, come back! üò≠
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor
---
it literally ruins the match for all 4 players? One person doesn't get to make any points by altruism or gens and the other 3 dont get to be chased. 
---
Also tunneling just straight up doesn't apply as much pressure as switching targets.
---
Ahhahahha wtf that waa funny üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
When does it stop being tunneling? 
---
Like i‚Äôm new to killer so i can‚Äôt tell if i‚Äôm being toxic. If a survivor gets someone off the hook and i go in to hit the survivor that was just unhooked is that toxic? I‚Äôm just trying to finish them off so there‚Äôs one less person faster. If i go for the other one it will take longer to get another hook right? 
---
I guess if everyone‚Äôs all grouped up and you single one out multiple times that‚Äôs tunneling but idk if it‚Äôs a choice between who i‚Äôve already hooked and someone who i know will run me around for 5 minutes ima go for the one i‚Äôve hooked
---
"job".
---
we esports now
---
i mean its pretty good so far, the only thing that‚Äôs odd is the run lock for both killer and survivor and some features aren‚Äôt implemented yet
---
Pretty much all of these.  The nerfs you're calling for are nutty man.  Communication is a big advantage but swf groups in general are far from unbeatable.  Communication won't make a shitty looper any better at chases.  Like it or not man they're a big part of the playerbase and they aren't going anywhere.  Better to just work at playing more optimally as killer rather than getting this bent out of shape over them.
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main but I do play killer. I solo queue survivor to rank 1 every reset and get to red ranks as killer (I typically only play Huntress and Clown so it‚Äôs hard to consistently hit red ranks because I‚Äôm not great). My SWF as a separate queue was meant to allow SWF to still be in the game but to even out the playing field for killers willingly going into it, that‚Äôs why there is separate proposed changes. I‚Äôm aware that generators are the only objective but it doesn‚Äôt make it any less frustrating playing killer and getting 2 kills and barely getting the 0 pip because Ruin was cleansed in 23 seconds and generators were finished in 4 minutes. While I don‚Äôt want to punish survivors, why should they punish killers? Playing very optimal as a killer, unless you‚Äôre playing Nurse or Spirit (maybe Clown if you‚Äôre good at looping) you only do well if survivors mess up. If nothing else, why should survivors have all the power?
---
Dying light and insidious. Because they both promote unfun ways to play.
---
WGLF and self care. Both not bad perks in general, but the amount of waste these perks create. All the hook trading, or plain farming in hope to get stacks. And all the sitting in corners self caring against sloppy butcher (i like to run empathy, so i see that quite often)
---
Definitely The Spirit if you‚Äôre looking to have lots of success with your games.
---
How is that a spin at all? The Jake just ran forward. Youd have to have a stroke to miss that hit
---
Im having the opposite problem honestly, i havent won many matches as a survivor lately.
---
Well, the description says she is hard. Maybe not that hard? I play as the Huntress often.
---
Hey, if you t bag, I won't feel remorse as I watch you struggle on the hook.
---
Dude could have escaped via hatch if his teammates dipped I think
---
Spirit requires mindgame knowledge and you'll have to get used to predicting survivor movements
---
As Michael Myers (or in general) how do I counter flashlights? I've only started playing a few days ago, and I've already noticed a trend where if the survivors open the escape, they'll just stand there at the very exit and spam me with their flashlights until the timer runs out. It's fucking annoying and makes me want to just disconnect.
---
His best add ons are the ones that decrease re-appearance time, and the one that increases his running speed while cloaked (windstorm?).
---
The running speed gives him much more map pressure than usual, and combined with a faster re-appearance it can be the difference between catching a survivor before they make it to a mega loop or having them vault before you‚Äôve even uncloaked.
---
Obviously the results depending on whether you use the yellow, green or purple add ons. For the sweaty red ranks though you‚Äôll want at least green.
---
Make your choice is good on him as its easy for him with the cloak and these add ons to catch survivors unaware after an unhook. BBQ also works well now due to his increased speed.
---
Maybe she is, maybe she isn‚Äôt. Regardless that‚Äôs an disrespectful thing to say either way.
---
I don‚Äôt play killer, though. Well not very much. I‚Äôm not having issue performing. I‚Äôve got red ranks and maintain it every reset. The question isn‚Äôt being answered, though. Why should the survivors control the game? Any of those changes would help, I didn‚Äôt call for them all to be added next patch. The vast majority of matches I win aren‚Äôt because I had great generator pressure. I play Huntress and Clown so they‚Äôre only good for looping. So are you suggesting that the game is in a healthy state and that SWF should just be ignored even though it‚Äôs problematic?
---
Ye sureee! I have another idea: in the survive with friend queue the survivor can not move. They just spawn and wait for the killer to Mori them. Maybe now you will get 4 kills. Ah also the lobby time as killer as so fast right now that we really need a double queue! (That was sarcasm if someone couldn't understand).
---
The real problem in this community is that everyone thinks he is a pro player, and every time he lose a game he always blame other players and game mechanics. When you play as killer and survivor you  have to keep in mind that you are not supposed to win every game you play and you are not the strongest man alive. I'm red rank survivor and red rank killer, i'm not a really really good killer but I can get anyways to rank 3/4 and a thing that I can say is:
---
Swf or not, if you can't get 3 and 4 kills playing as a killer before rank 10 you are just bad. Anyways 2 different queue will only remove swf from the game, so a lot less people are going to play survivor and the game will just die. You will be surprised to know how many player play with at least one other friend in lobby.
---
Maybe shards? You play like 3-5 games to level up, get from 100-600 (I forgot the actual number...) and most cosmetics are well over 10k shards. On paper it seems easy to get but matches take a while and not that many of us can actually make a career on playing Dead By Daylight, nor do a lot of us want to. And yes, there are what I like to call the "Smash Bros cosmetics" that are literally the same character but with a few different colors but I mean... really... ? So maybe give us shards, an idea would be like;
---

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk
---
Why does this game take longer than any other to download updates?
---
Y'all just gonna ignore the missing heads?
---
You don‚Äôt play killer??? You just said to me you get to red ranks as killer!!! What‚Äôs the truth?
---
Good for you
---
You do have a point with this but some of your "tips" in the comments are just plain bad takes. The Killer needs more time no matter what and BHVR needs to work on that if we ever wanna leave the Nurse / Billy / Spirit Meta - but a lot of Killers even in red ranks are still losing because they simpley cant pressure, that is true.
---
You don't play killer much, yet you're calling for a sweeping list of oppressive nerfs for survivors that you're convinced killers need to have any chance at swf...what am I missing here.  If you played more killer you would realize how absurd your requests are.
---
Do swf groups have a clear advantage with communication sure they do.  Does this mean survivor needs to be nerfed into the stone age to play against them.  Not one bit.  Play more killer dude.  You'll see how unnecessary and unbalanced this would all be.
---
FORWARD AERIAL
---
The game started as a quite small project by quite small company. They didn't have budget for several game modes.
---
Adding new modes now is too risky I think. If new mode end up being unpopular, that's a huge waste of resources. Add to this new bugs (not only in new modes, they'd ruin "classic" mode as well). And playerbase is not big enough for several game modes (just search this subreddit for posts about lobby times)
---
Doin the lords work
---
I had around 1500 on PC and have been playing it on PS4 since The Pig released. So that‚Äôs an estimate. Also, again, these changes are not all meant to be implemented together. It‚Äôs individual ideas. If you‚Äôve put any sizable amount of time into the game, you‚Äôd know how unbalanced it is at higher levels of play
---
Ye I'd go ahead ignore this dude, do not get self care. Its garbage and teaches bad practice. There are plenty of posts on why that is. In short, time spent healing yourself is time not doing gens. It's time someone else is being chased it's time youre making the game essentially a 3v1. Get confident playing injured.  Take bond empathy to find others to heal you. Do not take self care.
---
Just to fuck with him, I figure.
---
I'll COMPLAIN about NOED all day because... you know... it sucks to go against, who here will really deny that?
---
BUUUUUT at the end of the day, as annoying as it is to hear...
---
"Just cleanse totems bro"
---
"But that takes away from gen time, even if they don't have it!"
---
This is why it's a perk, it punishes survivors because they failed to do an additional task, it's made to have survivors either have miserable lives after gen rushing, or slow down the gen rushing (which is fine by me). I still hate going against it, and will never run it unless doing a late game build (Which I never do). But at the end of the day I mean... I get it, especially at high ranks.
---
Mmmeehhh
---
I said rarely play killer. It‚Äôs not that hard to climb as killer. It‚Äôs just hard to stay in the red ranks, especially with Clown and Huntress
---
Because choosig a character make you act a certain way.
---
So cold as ice
---
Lol True talks just as much shit about killers that resort to using NOED as he does swf.  You definitely can't put that one on him.  He think's it's a crutch too.  He does not promote its use.  And to call him the most toxic streamer in dbd is absurd.
---
I'm... assuming this is a joke, but yes, they disconnected.
---
It‚Äôs not a sweeping list of oppressive nerfs. They were individual ideas, not a large set of nerfs intended to be packaged together.
---
I downvoted, purely because of that feeling of absolute disgust I got when I looked at this image.
---
Same as my rules but I have another survivor rule:
---
Maximum of 2 meta perks (unless I'm being boolied too much and I get mad lol)
---
https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us
---
Mine???
---
What do you mean it would either get people to relax and accept the game‚Äôs not always about beating people? I mean isn‚Äôt that the point. And I‚Äôm asking sincerely because I want to know what you mean fully.
---
*craps on the killers head*
---
I have bond on Dwight. Cause I saw a video on YouTube about having bond, it does help a lot to see where your teammates are to quickly fix gens together. üòä And tbh when I am injured I rarely heal or try to "get help" for healing. I mostly just go fix gens or even unhook people while I'm still injured. üòÅ Thank you for the advice btw!
---
He isn't wrong.  You're still a new player but if you chose to really put the work into learning Nurse she destroys survivor teams, swf or not.  There is exceedingly little counterplay to a good Nurse.  Best killer in the game.  Not as easily learned on console but still entirely possible.  I've played against them.  Frames have gotten better with the new engine so she isn't as rough for console as she used to be.
---
The only thing this guy does here is bitch about NOED. Perhaps we should ignore him?
---
Haha no it wasnt a joke. I'm a noobie. I thought it means disconnect but I wanted to ask here to be sure. Why people do that.. üòñ
---
Flair checks out
---
i had this happen to me when i was playing pig and never again.. just went back to my usual main :c
---
NOED doesn't counter gen rushing it often causes it.  Killers that run it typically make terrible decisions during chases like overcommiting as well as not pressuring the gens.  They often do this because they know they got that free instadown and haste coming up so it removes the urgency for them to make optimal decisions midgame.  Also survivors that hide all game don't run adrenaline.  They're more likely to be self caring in a corner they urbaned too while the grown ups are on the gens.
---
Hahahahaha üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Thank you!üòä I'll definitly do that! I been playing some of the killers as well yes. When I first started I didnt know that the Killers get to see where the gens are. Now I know they seen that due to play as a killer as well. I also check YouTube Videos. To see others their gameplay I learn from that as well. But I'll for sure check on the Killers their perks and addons. That's a good one! Because some killers can instantly kill without putting me on a hook, I think I read somewhere that's due to a perk right? ü§î
---
At higher levels all i see are billys spirits and nurses who have little trouble in those ranks
---
Had a game 2 days ago. Downed one if them and others were swarming the hook that felt like i was in a family reunion on thanksgiving. And this was at the beginning. At the end Claudette escaped through the hatch.  Nevertheless it was so satisfying to kill people who come to bodyblock
---
Yeah thinking about it now what i said was alot but my point still stands lol
---
Wow that's good!
---
That doesn‚Äôt even make sense. 
---
When you gen rush, you don‚Äôt do totems and Noed activates. 
---
When you do totems, you‚Äôre not gen rushing and noed doesn‚Äôt activate. 
---
Tell me again how noed cause gen rushing?
---
I didn‚Äôt say they were made by different people? I was just curious ,_,
---
I agree, based on his perks, David was injured before coming to the entity's realm but too proud to let anyone treat it. That gives him a huge weakness that nobody else has too.
---
Ground control to Major Tom~
---
Love Otz. I've been following since his Dark Souls days. I thought he was pretty alright then but he's definitely grown, I think he's gotten way better over the years and I'm happy to see the community he has no. I feel like it's genuinely wholesome, especially how he gives information for new players.
---
It's broken because you can pair them with infantry belts to get 3 instant hatchets.
---
It's a shame, i'm a huntress main too and have those addons piling up as well.
---
Or maybe they nerf this ridiculously unbalanced perk?
---
Re read what I said it makes perfect sense and I spelled it out verbatim.  Knowing that they have the safety blanket to fall back on when they lose the gens most killers that run it don't feel the urgency to make optimal decisions in regards to chases or map pressure.  They will tunnel a long chase while multiple gens pop instead of being smart about choosing when to commit and when to break off a chase.  They'll often engage in overly long chases they have no business being in while the survivors they haven't lifted a finger to disrupt simply crank out gens unattended causing a genrush.  NOED is just lazy designed perk that teaches the worst habits to killers.  Those of us that play without it demonstrate better decision making on average during the game.
---
There are some killers who can kill you due to their power or an addon (Micheal Myers / The Shape); some perks who activate that power (e.g. Devour Hope) or an offering (Memento Mori).
---
Also, watching streamers helped me a lot too, especially learning how to loop the killer. Also it helps to watch some ‚Äûbuilds‚Äú videos (e.g. Monto) to get an idea of which perks work together
---
You don't get any bloodpoints you earned in the match and i think you lose ranking aswell but not 100% sure. But both are no big deal to most players. You can always try reporting, doubt they'll do anything about it tho.
---
Found the rank 20
---
At the moment yes. His personality promotes a toxic fanbass. He himself isn‚Äôt using Noed and doesn‚Äôt camp but if you look at his chat you will find so many absurd people acting like survivor mains killed their mama or something.
---
I don‚Äôt dislike tru3, but he is ONLY playing this game as a job now, he is absolutely sick of it and it shows.
---
Still, wtf else could she get as an iridescent.
---
Who said that? Iirc stats showed the opposite
---
*grabs them when they try to unhook*
---
Honestly I'm not sure what the actual definition for gen rushing really is, but I've always referred to it when they spilt up with a plan and always kept me stretched thin before completing like three gens at once. Also when they rush the completion of the gen as I'm coming right them. I think gen rushing is supposed to be cheating or something, but to me it looks like completing the objective in a cautious and timely manner
---
At some times of year, on Belfast I've seen so many seagulls BRUTALLY ATTACKING PIGEONS for no reason?
---
Glad I helped.
---
Also the stance that the huntress is in, her back foot should be further back and she should have a more active stance, she looks so unanimated right now, no human would swing an axe with that form.
---
That looks really nice
---
+1 respect from me
---
"Claudette, he's right behind you- Oh God she has air pods in, she can't hear us, oh fuck-"
---
Just because gens are free doesn‚Äôt mean you have to ignore totems. 
---
I‚Äôm talking about what you do as a survivor and you keep pushing the ‚Äúkiller is overcommitted‚Äù thing. 
---
It‚Äôs not the same, I understand what you mean but it doesn‚Äôt encourage gen rushing, it leaves the other 3 survivors alone. It‚Äôs their fault for not doing totems too.
---
well yeah, because one was built from the start knowing players would be in groups, communicating and they balance the game accordingly along with balancing from the top down and a real MMR ranking system
---
and the other had it shoe horned in, with devs that still refuse to balance around it and force the killer to play the game within the boundaries of how the game was originally designed while the survivors are not.. which makes it too easy and not fun.. unless of course you just like not having a challenge and stomping someone.
---
üòä Thank you, I will check those videos. I wanna learn all that there is to learn about the game. It's such a fun and good game. ü§©
---
I only play because EvOLVE shut down.
---
Hmm okay! Thank you for the information. üòä I wont report tho, I'd be so sad if I lost my account, can't imagine doing that to someone else. Not even for camping or disconnecting.
---
As an italian, i proclame, PIZZA TIME
---
-rep tunneler and camper- claudette with twitch in her name and who was always near the fucking hook
---
Its simply way to op and 0 fun to play against. Eboni mori is already really cringy and makes people not want to play because anti fun and feels like youve already lost unless killer is outright bad. This addon would need a strong overide like hags iridescent such as you absolutley can not have more then 1 hatchet or severely increase windup time to have any semblance of balance. Like a ha i got you out in the open you die because im good. Not just ive got 3 insta down hatchets that are simply going to wreck you and theres nothing you can do about it. Huntress is already a t1 killer and the only thing that really stops her from being top killer is lack of mobility.
---
It decrese qhen people doesnt wake up, which everyone is saying that waking up is useless, so prpbably more than 1 person will be asleep, 1 person asleep is 15% faster recharge
---
Honestly, I just hate to play against iridescent, it's just... not fun. I wouldn't disconnect because of that, but as much as I hate people that disconnect, in this case, even I can't judge them if they would do that because of this.
---
Actually, Jakes are the ones that do gens together with Tapps and Quentins
---
He's actually pants at using a killers power properly, but godlike at playing killer in general. I don't understand.
---
I never knew this was a thing tbh. :0
---
Alright kid. NOED doesn't really need a nerf (Aside from the speed boost cuz idk why is that a thing). If you and your teammates don't cleanse totems then don't be surprised that killer has NOED.
---
Hey I know that killer, I've played Survivor with him quite a few times.
---
I mean true but with ebony moris I use it after 2 hooks unless I really need it. What else would she have as an iridescent.
---
in most of my games I leave the 3rd one on the floor and just hang the 4th, but its far more exciting this way, isn't it? I see your point tho
---
It's the only good cosmetic for Jake in my opinion and I am trying to get shards to buy him
---
Mine????
---
The Photoshop / whatever editing on Feng's head is too obvious, you cloned one blade of grass  two times.
---
I do totems man.  Everytime I see a dull I take it out.  The fact that it is physically possible to take them out doesn't make anything about the perks bad design in rewarding a killers poor play any less true man.  The perk is essentially training wheels.  It's good for killer just starting out that want to learn the game without any of the stress that comes with having to pressure the gens, but those that continue using it up the ranks grow defendant on it.  They are especially susceptible to swf groups who have a totem counter in their party chat anyways so chances are it won't proc against them.  Learn to play without it and you're better able to deal with a coordinated swf group.  Play aggressively and aim to end every game with at least 1 gen up.  Don't gameplan for failure with your loadout.
---
Can I get some examples?
---
It can take a killer 60 seconds just too get a first hit. This advice is not strong tbh, If you play trapper or hag, you hav too spend the first 69 seconds just placing traps, which makes this moot.
---
Just check out some of the patch notes over the last few months or so
---
Billy jake? Cause of the eye
---
The best thing to do is go for all of the teachables that you want. Generally this means (in no particular order) Claudette + David King + Meg + Nea
---
After that, you can continue to go for more teachables, or prestige your characters. It's really up to you.
---
Most are going to use it after 1 hook. Granted its much healthier then when ebonys first were available. She could have one that inflicts all status ailmemts or something as well. Though tbh she isnt a killer that really should have a strong iridescent. Like the nurse and billy. Theyre already top tier powers. Nurse iridescent is a joke tbh. Billy, honestly i barely even remember if he has one let alone what it does. This addon is already hella busted and has no severe downside like anyone elses that cant easily be made up for. To be fair idealy what hers should be is something similar to nurse perhaps to see the trajectory or something. Possibly inflict mend status or something if theyre uninjured. But as is with the belt being easily available this addon really is 0 fun to play against especially if its a good huntress.
---
Bubba's in a pretty good place right now honestly. If you're in the open with no windows, his chainsaw has no real counterplay (except spinning around and hoping he loses you). I just run bamboozle on him to remove the window counterplay.
---
You might say pallets, but they're not hard to mind game. Let them drop it, run around as if you're going to let them loop around it, double back and start charging the saw, break the pallet. Usually that ends with them being right on the other side of the pallet as it breaks.
---
Ok
---
New update - Survivors can now crawl at immense speed. They can also throw down pallets and if the pallets stun the killer the survivor will be put in the injured state
---
Oh la la
---
Oh man I remember my first time playing Freddy, I actually got him along with the others around the second week of playing. Getting a 4k for the first time is very thrilling haha
---
Hmm very nice
---
Ye that‚Äôs true
---
Had this happen to me twice before as well on console. So odd lol
---
Well we don't know ranks so hold your horses
---
Yes absolutely
---
Yes that‚Äôs very good I agree
---
Daily sacs. Sorry
---
You look like the son of Ace Visconti and Shia Labeouf
---
Oh ok
---
After a certain amount of time a person can be matched with everyone
---
Leatherface is by no means as fucked as every other M1 killer such as Amanda, Wraith, Trapper. Leatherface has instadown power, and with addons his chainsaw is quick and has lunge.
---
Again as I said in my comment a full team of premade is strong in every game you play. It's not a thing of dead by daylight is a thing of videogames in general. Play at your best, change you build around what you see in the lobby for example: you see 4 meds put Franklin, if they had insta heal they will waste a lot of time running around the map at the end of the chase to get them back. Run ruin, cause they could be coordinated, to try to slow down the game. If you see that 4 swf join your lobby maybe put a green Mori so you will get a kill pretty fast and they will help to slow down the game too. Maybe for that game think about playing a strong killer like nurse, spirit, billy, etc. If you want to play something else maybe you will do in the next one. And again keep in mind you are not supposed to win every game you play. And when you play don't get baited. I mean there could be the guy good at chase that find the best spot in the map and start spamming his flashlight and t-bag you from that spot to make you chase him. Stay calm and use your brain, if you are a survivor in a god spot leave him, even if he made you salty and come back for him later. Also if you don't have good add ons and perks then don't complain in the post lobby if they had. As I said the war against swf in dbd started bracause every bad killer wants to win win and win. And again a good team of full premade is strong in every game you play so we don't need to destroy a game to let every brainelss player win.

Has someone who was raised in an English seaside town, I can say that seagulls would be a lot worse than crows.
---
Citation needed.
---
I run Spine Chill with all of my builds and the amount of games it has helped me win in EGC is greatly notable.
---
Not really. Just stand still at a pallet until the survivor gets spooked into either leaving the loop or running right into you. 
---
Injured survivors are helpless without Iron Will and have no hope of partaking in any mindgames, let alone winning them.  If they dont run, they are sitting ducks. If they do run, follow the scratches and they are finished. Seriously, the difficulty people speak of with the Spirit is way overblown.
---
Ive started pre setting up my nea and showing like basic dwight then switching last second. Because i often run flashlight with pink nea cosmetics or sometimes med kit toolbox. But i completley get this. Tbh i wish at some point we would be hidden from killers so things like this arnt necessary
---
It's been hard for me to justify coming back since Deathgarden hit. I by far prefer the theme of dead by daylight. But now that I've played an asymmetrical game where the killer is actually terrifying, going back to DbD just makes the flaws super obvious. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Sadly it's something that's a problem with the base concept of the game. People can only run at set speeds and run for specific obstacles to buy time from a melee killer. It creates a polarizing scenario where if the obstacles are too thick, the survivors can keep running more or less indefinitely and the only counter is to gamble on a mind game. But if obstacles are reduced, then the killer just wins outright due to being faster. It's just a timer until they hit you.
---
Meanwhile Deathgarden, you need to play stealthy because the killer is as mobile as you (more or less based on situations), and primarily uses a gun. Meaning IF they find you, you nee to break line of sight or be gunned down quickly. Despite this, a scavenger's high mobility allows them to feel they have a chance despite the killer holding the power. Similarly, there are far fewer situations where you are safe to taunt the killer. There's no "I can take another hit" or "This is only my first hook." Every time they catch you, it's a rush to escape.  
---
Sadly, these concepts just can't come to dead by daylight. They'd have to find a completely new approach. If they can find a way to make killers feel terrifying and in control, I'll gladly come back since I really prefer the horror theme. Until then though, I just can't enjoy anymore.
---
Gotta assert dominance over the killer somehow
---
Mom was right
---
Against the majority of bad players this works sure, but for the good players you have to mindgame expertly
---
&gt; The ability to heal yourself without have to carry a medkit is unbelievable strong.
---
yeah, maybe against M1 killers. you know what's better? Doing Gens. The time it takes you to self care you could nearly complete a gen.. and if each of you nerds that were self caring would have spent that time doing gens , the doors would be powered and you could escape. 
---
Pluse /u/seabassspring is right, it teaches bad practices. do you know how many times I laugh seeing people like you waste time self caring against killers like Myers, Billy, Leatherface etc.. killers that can instantly down you.. so rather then knocking out a gen.. you wasted a minute running around looking for a place to hide from the killer and then spend 40 secs self caring up.. so that next time the killer finds you.. he can just instantly down you again. Solid game sense and thinking there. lulz.

My first ghost face Moro was on a jake

Rank doesn't tied to hours played. You can take a break for a couple of months and end up at rank 20 (lowest) with 6k hours.
---
Ssst don't demotivate. üòä
---
To be honest its likely some kid was playing on someones account or something and the person was probably watching and laughing their ass off.
---
CAMPER TUNNEL BITCH EZ GG BABY KILLER
---
What‚Äôs up my dude
---
Facing a wall or facing away from where survivors likely are (i.e. the center of the map). If you know someone's around sometimes you can bait them out by standing over a downed survivor for a second or two, earning you a free hit. Survivors actually have to hit a pretty tight timing to get a flashlight save, so get in the habit of looking straight up or down as soon as possible when you hear one so you can avoid improperly timed flashlights or drive-bys on your way to a hook.
---
There's always Lightborn and Franklin's Demise as an option, but personally I think they're overkill once you learn how to play around flashlights. I believe it's ScottJund who says players that swarm around with flashlights waiting for a teammate to get downed are like their own built-in Ruin; they're not on gens, they're following the Killer around accomplishing little unless they hit a very specific timing. Once you learn how to punish that you get a fuckton of momentum.
---
As far as getting annoyed at teabags/clicks in the exit gate: if it really tilts you, you don't have to deal with it. Unless you really need the hit points just wait out the EGC timer. They'll be forced to leave, you'll deny them their teabags and you can alt tab and watch a video or something in the meantime.
---
Weve done a pretty good job so far.... thanks dude. I remember this being a bug a long while ago. You could leave the map and fall down and land somewhere randomly in the map lmao
---
What‚Äôs the incentive for prestiging?
---
are you on PC? Steam\DBD might be down or having issues. If you search that error on Google most people blame steam. give it a bit and try again?
---
I never dodge lobbies no matter how toxic survivors look. I just being Franklin's if y'all are trying to flashlight bully me :)
---
Did they recently add these in? Or is this a fluke?
---
So if the survivors don't use up the items the killer is justva normal m1 that gives survivors items at the start?
---
Congratulations on getting to rank 16 mate. 
---
There is someone on YouTube called hybrid panda give him a watch. Especially his shrinewatch videos as he uses certain perks and explains what they do. He is really entertaining too.
---
Jake please take out your got dang air pods she's right there she's gonna clobber you turn aroun- Oh there he goes. Seriously tho, this is pretty great haha
---
Unironically, that's not very cash money of you. This game CAN be fun, but is toxic 90% of the time, and usually just results in a lot of frustration, unless you play so little that you stay around rank 15. 
---
He'd be better served spending his dosh on r/HuntShowdown, r/Minecraft, or r/Terraria.
---
This may sound stupid, but iv'e been playing killer a lot on console at the moment and i always see people dropping bodies to counter Decisive. I was wondering if this is a PC only thing as i haven't been able to do it on console and I've spammed every button when carrying a body. Can anybody help me out?
---
What is prestige in first place, never heard about it.
---
can't find it guess I'm mistaken then thought I remembered them saying that in a video eh oh well
---
When the seagulls cry, there are no survivors
---
MINE!!!
---
Seagulls are the true evil ever try to fall asleep when they are around?.
---
I'm a rank 1 pig main and I usually double pip. i don't bloodlust camp or tunnel. pig can get a lot of pressure going if played right
---
Thankyou! And I will give him a watch on YouTube!! üòä
---
have you tried getting good?
---
Or just don't super impose it over everything. It could just be an aura that's especially bright and then fades
---
If you can get a group together its fun to do a Sabo only game. Everyone uses a combination of No Mither, Empathy, Sabotage &amp; Dead Hard/Resilience/Breakdown/Deliverance/Borrowed Time or something like that. Bring a tool box &amp; maybe a distance between the hooks offering Then all you do is Sabo the whole game, do no generators at all &amp; see who lives the longest. There should be no hooks so the killer will have to leave you to get yourself up multiple times, if you go down near the basement you're screwed though
---
Yea, just gotta give the survivors some very dangerous totems to go after.  Ruin+Thrill+Devour Hope means you know they will give you all the time in the world to build those stacks up, either from you catching them on gens or catching them on totems.
---
Alright, but the same thing happened on the 6th.
---
Anytime mate. When I started playing at the beginning of last year I watched him and learnt a lot. noob3 is good also. He will show you how to loop a killer and frustrate them.
---
Hahah I will watch Noob3 also then üòÇ Cause I do mostly get caught by the killer. Sometimes I am lucky. But I need to learn to be better at running away üòã
---
quentin main here ) :
---
Welcome to survive with friends groups, where others can be red ranks while that one or two will be either rank 17 or rank 19. It's quite broken, however, the devs said that they're working on a rework for the broken matchmaking, so lets hope they can finally find some solution to this issue!
---
Haha yeah that's always a problem at the start. The best advice really is never throw the pallet down untill you need it. Haha
---
This needs more jpg!
---
it's because he plays without strategy.
---
But I don't want to motivate if they were rank 20
---
LOL good then I do that advice well enough üòÇüòä
---
yeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
---
Ahw why not? If this person is a noobie they did very very well!
---
There‚Äôs a reason they added that the killers can now open the exit gates as well it‚Äôs so the survivors don‚Äôt have gates 99‚Äôd since it can be powerful since there is no time limit in how long they can take to save a teammate
---
That‚Äòs a new Killer called The Crapper.
---
I wish someone would send me that on console.
---
"Cool kid now go cry to your mom to buy you another game."
---
I want to say that to a toxic survivor so badly
---
Ok Dwight
---
Gotta get those adept achievements
---
Well that is true... You have a point
---
If your speaking about characters it's just if you want the cosmetic items, but I've heard a lot of people say you get a higher chance for rarer perks and add on's and i'm almost 100% sure this is true. But if you mean account level it allows you to get more iridescent shards at the cost of more XP per level and you get an extra devotion number next to your level.
---
Mine?????
---
Console fps yes, valid point(unsure if they fixed that yet). Controller vs mouse in DBD doesn't give much of an advantage. I could be wrong but I don't see any way that much could be had. Correct me if I'm wrong though.
---
All my mishits are on purpose, I want survivors to think they are playing against baby killer, then all four of them escape and they STILL don't know I am a hardcore pro in disguise who decided not to disclose his identity.

For killer I'd chose hex ruin. As simply just extending the game for a totem perk is ehh. With so many people running it and me not wanting to tap. Sometimes its a bit frustrating getting non stop skill checks and having my greats mean nothing because of an occasional miss. Id much rather just see longer times on gen and this perk removed. And i hate seeing teammates spend 20 minutes finding the totem or it gets destroyed the first 30 seconds. There is no in between. Secondly id choose barbie que and chili. Namely cus of rank 1 billies and nurses just simply getting to auto jump on you. To snowbally for my taste. As a rank 1 i generally always clear totems as i go to stop no ed. And if teammates gen rush their fault for being stupid.
---
For survivors honestly id like to see wglf go. I hate wasting a slot as it has no practical use other then bp. Id much rather see teammates run something to help us. Second id chose any of the useless default survivor perks. Like left behind were gonna make it ill get hate for this but premonition dejavu. Simply cus i hate these waste of perk slots showing up in my web.
---
Yeah i play on steam and dont have my profile on private really funny how much salt you get
---
ü§óü§ó
---
yeah and they're slow... he needs to be fixed like hag was, im not saying as strong as hag but damn he's average right now even with M1 perks
---
Her sword is bent and her feet are atrocious, 1/10
---
Something like that happened to me yesterday.
---
A prestige claudette got unhooked by another prestige claudette. 
---
The injured one ran directly towards me while the other one pretty much escaped in the 'smart direction'.
---
I smacked the injured one and didn't even bother picking her up (because of DS - fuck that perk).
---
Fast forward and she was flaming me for being a "cancer killer" that tunnels.  
---
I asked her what she would have done if she would have been in my position and she responded with that you aren't supposed to go for unhooked injured targets and it's toxic to do so.
---
Like anyone plays them.
---
petition to make this an actual thing? i like the concept

---
I'll also give you a tip to help you memorize each map. When the game starts, you can see the name of the map in the corner. Everytime you start a match, read it out loud.
---
Are we in the same games or something? I'm exactly the same... like teammates you know running is faster and he's not going to see you from 140 metres away right?
---
WGLF is now safe unhooks so hook trading is slightly less common
---
I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre getting downvoted because I think you have a point.
---
r/suddelynemo
---
Ormond is one of the most recent maps and they are adding loops from Ormond to other maps so they must think they are well designed. Killer have no chance to mindgame the new loops. Big maps are bad for the game as well, it's imposible to control them for killers.
---
If I'm killer and 1/4 survivors disconnects I'm only gonna kill one person... Then I'll smash pallets if they wanna do that... Or put the controller down
---
Or huntress or billy, yeah.
---
Pc survivors would obliterate most console killers too.
---
Don't get into a habit of playing too immersed. Yes that style has its places but for the most part it's boring and you'll never get better. What you want to do is make sure you learn maps and loops so you can get better at chases and looping killers. It's keeping killers occupied in that way that really helps your team. Chases, gens and safe unhook/healing teammates that will help you rank up the quickest and rank up.
---
Because he knew that if he hit him he might have run to another direction rather than in the trap
---
Hey dude there's a guy on your left!
---
Thankyou for the tips! ü§ó Can I ask what is immersed? Lol, I aint english I dont know what that word means.. üòñüòÖ
---
Mine??????
---
Otz has the biggest brain in DBD
---
Stay low ranks my friend. Youll know nothing but sorrow at higher ranks
---
I like how I did that earlier lmao
---
Oof.. why you demotivate me like that üòÇüò≠üò≠
---
So, no examples, then.
---
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on~
---
For killer i simply chose not to tunnel and camp. Sometimes when im feeling really nice ill never hook someone whos on last hook. Extends the game sometimes too and fun for everyone. &lt;i dont really care about pipping on killer necessarily as its incredibly easy. And saftey is almost always guaranteed unless i get steamrolled. It happens&gt;
---
For survivor, this is a rough one. I wear bright cosmetics as i refuse to play immersive. My general build is dead hard, self care, borrowed time, and some random decision perk usually. Adrenaline if i get tunneled several games in a row or sometimes resilient. I dont play in a toxic way as survivor. No teabagging sand bagging etc. Im usually more then happy to take agro for a struggling survivor.  I cant really set many limitations on myself  to much as at higher ranks its a terrible curse that im always the runner. So yes i will pallet stun and flashlight. Its their choice if they want to keep chasing me instead of going for easier pray. Im the noob3 of trhing to be gen jockey. Even if i try it fails lol.
---
Haha maybe youll enjoy the pain like the rest of us
---
HAHAHA.. Maybe I will üòèüòÇ
---
At the moment since the Ghostface DLC patch I've seen more and more instances where red ranked survivors invade lower rank killer games. I think they team up with friends on rank 20-15 smurf accounts and in that way sneak into the queues not made for them.
---
Time is everything to killers. Yes self care has its uses but I agree with whoever said it encourages bad practices. It takes too long and can end up helping the killer because people prioritise self caring over more important things like safe hook rescues etc. Look for teammates to heal you, take a med kit because that is much faster.
---
I did this yesterday in front of two teammates who were coming to rescue me, 4% kobe
---
That‚Äôs a textbook meg
---
Upvote this guy. I couldnt put it any better lol.
---
Haha no worries. It just means playing too hidden or stealthy. Crouching around the map the whole time. Like I say, there are times for it but learning to be good at chases and loops is much more effective in every way.
---
Next time bring "Franklin's Demise" and make 'em drop them flashlights as well, that plus the madness will have 'em in tears by the end!
---
My little Jake is so precious
---
Golden
---
Oooohw ok! Well I dont do that! üòä And thanks for explaining.
---
It becomes way easier as soon as you get good with a killer. I leveled up my hillbilly (first killer) to lvl 36 in like 15-20 hours. And at higher levels it doesnt require that much more BP to lvl up. Barbecue and Chilli is the best perk of course because it gives BP.
---
That wouldn‚Äôt frighten me, they look boosted af and are probably way too predictable lol
---
My first 4K was with wraith
---
Daddy hit me.
---
I'm assuming it's the pallet near the boxes machine in The Game. You need to do the gen on the other side to open that door. That map is full of traps.
---
Poor Hag.
---
If I see 4 flashlights, i bring Franklin's Demise no matter what ;P
---
Dwight is made fun of because in the trailer he hides in a locker. Also he just has that noobish/scared aesthetic.
---
Queintim mains Unite!
---
The dropping bodies to counter DS is an old strategy. The way DS works is now you get off the killer's shoulder before they are able to move.
---
IIRC, dropping on console is O (or B).
---
Jeff is trash all he can do is make logos
---
Are you my boyfriend because he just started playing a few days ago and basically hasn‚Äôt done anything else
---
It‚Äôs really frustrating how the devs don‚Äôt SEEM to care about console whatsoever. Bringing out a switch and mobile version before they even fix main issues on console. People always talk about the framerate but I think queues are 100 times worse
---
The rarer perks/addons is a very minuscule change (like 2% or something). Prestiging is all for cosmetic purposes. For me personally, I just like maxing things out.
---
Holy shit, I‚Äôve only been playing for about 2 weeks that‚Äôs an amazing idea
---
‚ÄúNo point in it other than to be a dick‚Äù It does help you to juke a killer if used correctly.
---
I purposely don‚Äôt go beyond 5 to avoid this.
---
15,16,16,17 I‚Äôm level 14 killer
---
Been playing about 2 weeks. Not gonna lie they weren‚Äôt very good or but I‚Äôm sure they were just messing around and having fun. One sent me a message in Japanese. Pretty random
---
Congrats, welcome to the most toxic survivors you will see.
---
For killers: Monstrous Shrine beacause its really useless no one would even notice if it magicaly was removed and Furtive Chase because it has very high requirement, can f*ck up easily, and gives poor reward.
---
For survivors: Left Behind and Up the Ante because both are useless. Or Maybe D-Strike don't get me wrong I love D-Strike but I find it hard to go against it when the exit gates are open and especially they got unhooked near the exit gate
---
I‚Äôm deranking rn lmao
---
Allow me to disagree. According to BHVR themselves, the game is built to prevent one side from dominating the other one too much. If Survivors are too good and manage to fix all the gens, they still have to open gates while the Killer has Rancor, NOED, Blood Warden and other perks to secure at least one kill. The same goes for too good Killer matches: if the team is screwed, the last guy still has a chance to escape. If there were no chances at all, even more people would DC, because "why bother?". 
---
&gt;in most cases the last survivor remaining was being a litttle pussy in order to gain that status
---
I have seen many ppl who do exactly what you said, but that's not the majority really. People start running around the hook like mad and half of the team gets hooked before you finish the first gen. You cannot stop them from ruining your game and just watch their status icons change.
---
Probably has his Messages disabled too right?
---
 What would be nea‚Äôs mori tho , more importantly whats her power
---
When I see a survivor unhook another survivor that is afk, I let them run away so they can have second chance because it was unfair of that huy to be afk. But now every time I do that, survivors think I'm trying to be friends with them and they stop playing normally which makes the game stupid. So when I do it I take the afk 1 away and leave the other one so they don't become friendly.
---
Correct.
---
Hate that if you are gonna be a bitch atleast own up to it and take the hate
---
This bitch empty.
---
**YEEET**
---
4 claudettes in general makes me wanna kill myself cus on my screen i cant make it brighter to spot them easier. The map is always dark for me.
---
Survivors is ez, just run one million of unmindgameable safe loops
---
Still waiting on that example...
---
I kinda agreed until you called DS a nerf
---
That's why I really liked the idea of a 2nd objective and I loved the cancerous nectar thingie last halloween. It made games more mellow and more interesting, I could try out so many new perk builds both as killer and as survivor and still everyone got lots of BP. They should include something optional like this again.

---
I appreciate the serious nature of the game. Friday the 13th is a bit more relaxed with the costume choices and such. But i think its nice they are trying to keep it fairly serious
---
Why would you give up your best perks just to get rid of a counterable item?
---
Exactly.  
---
Do nothing - they complain.

Do anything - they complain.

There's no way to win.

haha glad you liked it, dude.

They are supposedly going to be enforcing a time out for dcing with the servers coming up. Or so iv been told
---
No you're breathtaking! ha, thanks!

Family sharing is not bannable. What likely happened is that your 'brother' cheated or exploited in some way resulting in a ban. In which case nothing can be done to get back into the game.
---
If this is your first perma ban, you can buy the game again with a new steam account to continue playing.
---
To each their own I guess. I like hiding much more than being chased.  
---
Although I'm excited for the pallet change. More but unsafer pallets would turn chases a little bit more into actual displays of skill, rather than just being a carousel of sillyness.
---
Whatsup, I've played against you as killer before too. I'm usually playing Huntress, ign Karambwanji
---
3 years later and survivors are still seething over NOED.
---
*AHEM*
---
Cope.
---
Why is this so funny? üòÇ
---
Then you get the game
---
Well that joy lasted long :D
---
Sneaky stabby, basically. Just duck behind low objects and utilize your leaning. Leaning can make or break your match

Tbh ruin is great to slow the game down a bit.
---
In my experience Jake players are the people who always try to bait and lead the killer into chasing them and then they try and go for radical jukes and top level massive brain plays. And about 94% of the time it doesn't work and they're on a hook within fifteen seconds.
---
Sword and feet are my only weakness ;-;

Ah, the old "my brother did it" bullshit.

You don't have to stick with others, when your team is bad  and ignores you, you can heal yourself. you can't find anyone to heal you? Heal yourself. Your the last Surviver? You can heal yourself. You can carry other items like a box to get the time back you "waste" healing yourself.

Next hooked survivors will be able to escape through the exit gates. The ultimate survivor buffs are approaching.
---
Tldr
---
Nice
---
it was red- purple ranks i was rank 2 dont know the killer rank
---
yea.
---
This meme made by killers who use ruin
---
Adrenaline is the equivalent of noed. If they nerf one they need to nerf the other and both need nerfed, reworked, or removed i don't care which they choose.
---
Yeah the xenomorph dosnt have eyes. Therefore flashlights wouldn't work on it, which means he has an advantage against the survivors. And because he has some power over the survivors he would just be removed from the game after a week
---
NOED for obvious reasons, and Rancor because it‚Äôs obnoxious. 
---
Urban because I hate immersed survivors, and Object of Obsession because I think it‚Äôs completely anti-fun.
---
this guy camped and tunneled
---
How the fuck did he get there?
---
true.
---
I don't even know, boy then just vanished
---
As a killer main, this one does not speak for us 
---
A killer claiming looping is toxic is the equivalent of a survivor saying mindgaming is toxic
---
They‚Äôre both tactics to win chases
---
like doing the objective, right ?
---
If it takes longer than 90 seconds to just injure a Survivor than ya, that's a problem of yours. But against decent Survivors, there are few loop tiles that are very mindgameable and most killers don't have much real anti-loop potential. You cannot say that a Killer is bad at chase's when they're on a map like Autohaven that have mostly unmindgameable loops and there's a lot of pallets.
---
No he doesnt, "stop the chase am search someone else" guess what happens when you do that, you loose more time and when you find another survivor they will also run to the save spot, then what??? Stop the chase again and waste time again to find another who will do the same thing??? You see where this is going?
---
Yes, but that‚Äôs different then looping the killer at a truck loop,
---
I can see the inspiration now that it's pointed out - but I don't understand what that has to do with the story given.
---
and in that day, screamfan84 who never played killer on high ranks (at least it looks like it) learned that gen rushing isnt the killers fault but the survivors being in control, as always, the killer is supposed to take the reactive role which should be the opposite way around but it is like that
---
I still do this bullshit all the time too ü§£
---
It is good and enjoyable, when you can play.... everyone is hellbent to play as the killer tho
---
Hahaha yeap!
---
Love it
---
Ok, I'll be on pretty much all day.
---
;u; I‚Äôm a Jake main and I spend the whole match doing like 96% of the gens.
---
The word toxic gets used way too much nowadays. Don't like something, it's toxic, disagree with someone or voice an opinion, you're salty :P live and let go, he won't rank up much with that mindset
---
same, ur gamer tag?
---
Basically. Though if youte lucky, you may be able to do it with something as simple as some tires or something like that
---
But then you'll know which one is which. Unless there are several in one match. But a ruin/thrill combo. You'll know.
---
Would be OP with devour hope, especially if trapper managed to block it off
---
Why female survivors are so mean?
---
Hes probably new. Looping feels toxic to new players because...well the concept is kind of dumb.
---
Then you get used to it.
---
Clown is especially rough. He feels unfair to play against in a chase but is literally one of 3 killers with absolutely no map pressure. If you buff his gas, it will be frustrating. He's kind of in a weird balance dead zone.
---
I truly believe that M1 killers have unwinnable maps against good survivors. Playing Blood Lodge and Temple of Purgation feel extremely frustrating due to the size and the number of un-mindgameable loops. They're basically fields of pallets that you have to eat through if you don't play a meta killer.
---
New killer: the madre
---
weapon: la chancla
---
ability: whenever you fail a skillcheck she teleports behind you and starts screaming at you, chancla in hand.
---
PC too. Sometimes I even see the outline of the hairs/top of heads of killers and survivors from quite far away, usually behind a point of light
---
*cries in meg main*
---
Mine????????
---
My gamertag is ColvinClan4444 (sorry I know stupid).
---
hex:ruin, takes you a long way
---
I love how people still use the "killers don't need 4K's" argument when you can literally depip with a 4k at red ranks. The game is pushing killers to have to play for a 4k just to have a chance of "winning."
---
If someone Kobes right when I get there I‚Äôm not coming for them next time, especially if I came across the map. It‚Äôs such a waste of teammates time.
---
There was an attempt
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Yes devs pls just change this. "The Ghost Face" just sounds dumb. Why not remove the "Face" bit. The best name for him in my opinion is "The Scream", though.
---
I dodge when I see 4 toolboxes, ain‚Äôt worth it
---
It does not. You can put your addons on in whatever order you want.
---
Hex Ruin will slow the game down....just a little bit.
---
As a nea main i‚Äôm- 
---
Uh
---
Well, i certainly don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm the best... but I do really piss off the killer, so you might have a point
---
HUNTRESS GET YOU IN MOOD
---
SHOW LEG
---
They dont really need to put a ptb on consoles, i mean performance wise PC is way better, mouse and keyboard gives more control over your character and PC has a more legit tier list.
---
What a fucking moron
---
Pros for Mist as a Survivor: Easier to hide/less chance getting seen  
---
Pros for Mist as Killer: Hide traps as trapper/Hag, harder to see as Pig/Ghostface/
---
Dull totems and chests are where it's at.
---
Do you have the pink hair on Nea?
---
Guilty as charged, officer
---
Personally I don't even see it as looping actually I don't what that I just thought it was oh I better run my ass of here or I'm getting stabbed
---
Oh lord no, everytime I hear that hum I let myself die, put myself out of my misery
---
Same, idk if it‚Äôs any different on console than PC but I feel like survivor hitboxes are huge. If I‚Äôm anywhere in the radius to do a 180 or 360 I‚Äôm getting hit whether they‚Äôre looking at me or not
---
A little tap tap tap-a-roo
---
Very Rare btw
---
Very Balanced btw
---
*yes*
---
maybe I already am
---
Moris are dumb tbh
---
I don't know what he means by a "legit tier list" all characters are the same.
---
Counterpoint, Claudettes
---
No, the onus is on you because you stated the original sentence in question.
---
IKR. And then they write something dirty and inappropriate about you and your mom connecting it somehow with you using NOED.
---
Me too, its this random stuff that's got me going. With the base meme templates.
---
I think they need to focus on fixing the game before porting it to any other platform.
---
LOL
---
Without Iron Will, probably not.
---
Not without them messing up at least.
---
How are a speed boost, instant up/heal situational? The only times they're not useful are when the killer is afk or farming with you.
---
I hope they fix dedicated servers and we can have all those lag switchers get bullied by rank 20s
---
Mother Daughter Ring remove the new scratch marks, not Prayer Beads.
---
yeah there are some annoying bugs on pc like the one that doesn't let you escape as survivor and the one that freezes you in place and doesn't let you grab as killer, but iam guessing that they have a team for each  platform console and pc and mobile
---
Meg. A runner should be fairly good at running from a murderer.
---
Because 90% of the time when gens pop you're at full health and the killer isn't chasing you... Pretty self-explanatory
---
Every Jake I see runs slippery meat and tries to kobe, and none are successful.
---
I mean I already play as Ace based on his lore and cosmetics but since Bill is coming to console and his lore is pretty good I'd say him
---
Jeff (Blackmetal outfit). He‚Äôs me and he‚Äôs my main because of that.
---
Feng Min, cause we are both gamers
---
This is basically correct, but applying map pressure is very difficult for certain killers, especially due to the existence of safe loops. Hopefully the pallet update will make the game more interesting!
---
tbh head on stuns me when iam 1000 miles across the map and doesn't work when iam in front of the locker, its a really weird perk. but fun to use.
---
Should somebody call you an ambulance?
---
I know this feeling
---
As someone who has played L4D on XBOX since 2011, I agree. Bill will be my new main when he comes out.
---
Her cooldown was reduced from 20 seconds to 15 seconds, you can't hear her phasing sound while in her terror radius and her phasing sound isn't directional anymore and they made Prayer Beads one of the most OP add-ons in the game, because it removes phasing sound entirely.
---
Just a question, what rank are you? Sounds like that might be the problem.
---
Genfix* and Chill
---
Yh I can be rly dumb sometimes
---
the biggest issue? controls.
---
also, once it comes out for real, people will just play in on PC using some android emulator and it'll be full of people that can actually control their characters, which you'll have problems with
---
Yep but I feel we are going to see a bunch of baby bills after awhile because that's kinda how it is on PC
---
some characters are harder to use with a controller
---
for example, nurse is god-tier on PC, but she's almost unplayable on console, because controls don't allow you to use her potential
---
also, doctor is shit-tier, but consoles want him nerfed
---
You should get Leatherface, Hag and Spirit. 
---
Leatherface : weak killer, but he has Barbecue and Chilli and Franklin's Demise, which are really good perks, especially the first one. 
---
Hag : strong killer, she also has Ruin.
---
Spirit : strong killer, she also has Spirit Fury and Haunted Ground.
---
yeah i forgot to mention that and the emulation will bring a lot of problems, but i think it's (mostly) gonna be mobile players, i thought all of them are gonna be new and will crouch across the map but most of the survivors i played with were actually pretty good. and some of the killers were pretty good and got a 4k with these shitty controls lmao.
---
*sees a pixel rustling in the grass*
---
Oi, mate, what the frick? All I ever do is gens. This is unacceptable.
---
Pretty sure she ain‚Äôt got that Asian or Korean race.
---
yeah, only skilled killers run NOED amirite ?

so accurate it hurts
---
Nurse is fine on console. Just takes more practice.
---
Apparently, Entity likes Spoopy Spirits with Prayer Beads.
---
If they fail the attempt just let them go to struggle
---
Dwight because I know 100% if there was a murder running around I would be in the locker until he was gone from existence
---
Are you also standing stationary next to an exit gate 90% of the time it pops? No? Then the speed boost is still usefule for cutting time spent getting to an exit gate.
---
Lagswitching has been on ps4 since i started. Its just funny when the game crashes bc of it or killers talk mad trash avout how good they are when they do it XD
---
Fucking genius
---
No clown I‚Äôm the picture. 
---
He must be too T H I C C to fit in frame. 
---
Still though, great comic, very enjoyable.
---
I still see it all the time, that's why i said hope for a stack. As in hope the killer does not tunnel. But even then the unhooker ends up down very quickly. If they changed it to only count while outside of terror radius i feel it would be better.
---
Not to be judgy, but I said lore. I know Dwight is known for lockers, but his lore doesn't say anything about that.
---
No. Mostly those ones that annoyed by fast gens.
---
It's funny to see former Dark Souls streamers switched to Dead by Daylight and still kicking as much ass as they used to.
---
Thank you! You must be the clown main, I will draw him in the next DBD comic.
---
well i would want to be someone like meg (she is speed) but remembering how angsty i was a teenager and all the stupid shit i did to my hair... am nea
---
How's the quality of the shirt? The fabric looks a bit cheap but maybe only because its new. I wanted to buy one too but I'm not sure about the quality
---
Imagine you are an actual murderer that is intelligent and obsessed with jump scaring people and you will be a pro in no time
---
Good question, maybe an AoE effect, so that your hatchets only have to hit ~1m of a survivor hitbox to register a hit. 
---
Since huntress already has questionable hitboxes sometimes why not double down.
---
That‚Äôs just being petty
---
 Several addons do make a difference such as the order of a Long Life Battery and Low amp Filament
---
If you put the filament first you get less usage time than if you put it after
---
Have you not played in a few months ?

He and hag used to have 4 second setting animations, which waste a lot of time, they now have 1.5 second animations to lay their traps, the trappers in particular is a completely different animation.
---
It‚Äôs alright. My shirt was wrinkled because I had it sitting in the bag for a while. I actually originally bought this for someone else but we aren‚Äôt friends anymore so it‚Äôs mine now lol
---
no way dude, pc and console ports cost money, the mobile version is free. and so far the only purchaseable stuff are characters and cosmatics.
---
That's not what I'm thinking of though. I remember that change. This is something different. Picking them up requieres you to look at the traps directly and often janks the camera around.
---
Yeah but he is a big muscle boi
---
F
---
So the food is not only cold to the touch, it‚Äôs rotting. Great.
---
It‚Äôs fruit of the loom shirt brand 100% cotton if that helps
---
I'm on Xbox too. And I really like playing the doc build with bbq and distressing cause of the BPs. but half the time it's barely playable and the other half is completely fine
---
You aren't friends anymore? Now i wonder how long the shipping time was lol
---
Yeah. It was about a week I believe.
---
The biggests and best if tricks!
---
The teleport has a 5 second channel tho, so it's gonna be easy to counter. I actually think it'll be exciting because he'll be unpredictable, most of this game has become stale for me so this might freshen things up.
---
I was really hoping for a plague main to answer, imma edit that in
---
Meanwhile I don't give people the hatch anymore because last time the survivor was salty he didn't get to keep his item (downed him while using Franklin's Demise, was carrying him to the hook but the hatch was nearby so why not...)
---
YEET BREATHTAKING
---
Yes, I have got it used on me multiple times
---
if something is harder to use, it's worse, as you can't get the same amount of value from it.
---
Depending on how you take what I say you may be happy or not.
---
It looks like a quick sketch someone would do after encountering it once to show others or make a story. More of like way back then.
---
I do like the drawing for that matter it‚Äôs like if you saw the nurse back then that‚Äôs how she would‚Äôve been drawn as if she was a urban legend or a myth. Nothing in old detail since you had a quick look and survived to tell the tell.
---
I honestly get a grab bag with people who play Jake. I had a pretty good and altruistic Jake who would take hits for people coming off hooks because he didn't have BT and would run off in a different direction and lose the killer out in the cornfield. And then in another game I had a rank 4 Jake DC on a spirit because she looked at him. And then another who killed himself while I was running over to save him on hook cause it was literally the start of the game. Most of the ones I get do kind of stay away from the other players but stay on gens or will come over to heal teammates.
---
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I would never have noticed if it weren't pointed out though.
---
Ranking up isn't so great. You'll start facing more and more experienced killers with top tier perks.
---
One of the best things you can do is not to waste pallets, only using them for absolute necessity. You can usually run several loops before using a pallet and if there is a vault nearby you can loop almost indefinitely.
---
I wanna see where he says that about tea bagging that sounds hilarious
---
It is when it also comes with a free pickup from downed state/free heal yeah absolutely.
---
"In gaming, a tier list is a list that ranks all characters in a game based on the strength of their fighting abilities, as well as their potential to win matches under tournament conditions, assuming players are of equal skill."
---
Does nobody look at the picture their all dressed as the L4D characters if they don‚Äôt get cosmetics I‚Äôll eat my own hat
---
There was no announcement about it, but if i would have to guess, i wouldn't see why console players wouldn't get them.
---
this is bang on the money.  
---
Lobby matchmaking annoys me the most but they are rolling an update for that this summer
---
Pig is so much fun on lower ranks but I was having a lot more trouble right around rank 12, got to go well outside her perks to maximize her abilities. Still gonna invest in those sweet new outfits when they drop later this month (hopefully?)
---
No, it has also been reduced against pallets
---
just found out they are rolling out a matchmaking update at the end of summer which should help with long waiting times.
---
Nurse is objectively the best killer. Yes, she is harder on console, but she is still the best.
---
I'm not sure what that nerf to those characters were.
---
feng
---
She looks crouched like any other survivor but her camera view drops straight to the ground like she becomes an ant. So if there's any grass at all she is completely blinded.
---
it brings a lot of new players in, and welp, not stack? are you crazy? imagine queuing into a game and having 2 perks less and you and the other guy took the same perks.
---
and if you made it so you can see perks of the other killer before match, imagine those arguments about "which one of us takes ruin?"
---
There are a lot of problems with this idea and it's even worse, as it doesn't seem playable at all. 2 killers can just chase one survivor and there goes the entire fun part of the game. puff, gone. one goes one way, the other goes the other way, survivor has nowhere to go and he gets hit by both killers at once. fun chase, 11/10
---
lol, very blunt.  
---
I'd say it's worth it if you like horror games.
---
I accidentally downvoted this after trying to read this
---
Lol xd
---
I‚Äôm going to try Dwight. The curse as an in-game challenge.
---
I'd like to thank this sub for introducing me to some of the worst memes I never knew about
---
Damn that last one got me XD
---
I wouldn't mind if like every two minutes they would reset. But at the very least let the man carry 2 traps at a time in his base kit.
---
they nerfed the damage of things that had auto-aim
---
This is so true. I dont enjoy killer as much as I did when I first started. I find it more boring and not as challenging as it was (dont reee at me killer mains I like a hard challenge). Then when playing survivor it's either you have so much fun and the game is awesome or everything works against you (hit through pallets, tunneled, etc.). There are such extreme highs and lows that I question why I still play because more and more it's mostly just lows.
---
I never saw a nurse that haven't been destroyed on console, nor have I seen a video of a console nurse main killing everyone at high ranks. please link me with such video
---
what does this mean??
---
Could you at least try to diss me? I mean I labeled the reasons why. Or are you to uneducated on the topic to simply have a discussion? I did explain why it can‚Äôt be on other platforms even though it is a multi platform game. But you seem to go for the guy with less explanation then me. 
---
Also if anything you‚Äôre more of the Dumb Cunt.
---
I think you mean my teammates not committing to a good match because they are too busy rushing hooks and getting downed.
---
He would be even better if he couldn't be affected by his own traps... Just why ?
---
I definitely think a map that's like sunset and completely different feel, instead of farms and rocky flat land
---
Were there any luck offerings? I might be wrong but I think the end screen only shows what they brought not what they left with and/or used in the trial. There are treasure hunter survivor builds and I have seen clips of them pulling great gear out of chests. I don't think they were cheating or hacking as others have said sometimes survivors can just really cordinate well and bang out gens quickly.
---
&gt; In addition, Dwight would vault palettes rather than break them.
---
Yeah, no.
---
seems quick to me
---
Dont cleanse she is op after she gets vile purge. If you dont clease she is just gonna be a m1 killer
---
Thank you, my friend!
---
You've got to consider the perks as a whole rather than individual situations in a vacuum. Adrenaline is just a great all around perk that's virtually always useful when it activates.
---
Thank you xD
---
They aren't really even reworking it honestly, they're adding 4 more alternate versions of the map, with the landmarks in different areas and a different layout design, along with changing pallets for all maps, giving less very safe pallets and in return giving a lot more unsafe pallets to make it more skillful to play and not just pallet looping.
---
Approximately 1 gen
---
What the fuck
---
I sense your passion and love in creating something like this and with such detail. I appreciate you and pretty good job.
---
You don't get the new math and numbers behind it. They stated it multiple times how it works now and that it is a little more effective against pallets now but it only affects pallets and no DS stun anymore because they changed the way how DS works before
---
Thank you, I‚Äôm so glad you liked my art!
---
No, it‚Äôs bugged so it takes longer too end the stun then before.
---
My favourite build to tun is
---
Nurses Calling
---
Franklin's Demise
---
BBQ
---
Whispers
---
Essentially creating a build to track people before and after being hit. Franklin's delays the game as the survivor is forced to go back for their merit (assuming they have one and don't have self care) or find a teammate, giving away both of their positions.
---
Epic
---
Will the Switch version have the ability to link my character progression from Xbox? Also will there be crossplay between consoles?
---
Natural selection
---
I don't know why I got a downvote for this comment. People from here really get so salty if you suggest NOED, even just on a particular build ?
---
This...this is interesting
---
Comin from a gal with an art degree id say your doin ok, you seem pretty good for just starting, my only advice is just make sure you heed what your art teacher tells you, i didnt and couldnt figure out why my art turned out wonky and once i listened to her i got better, keep it up im sure itll be college material soon! And then you'll have those future class mates jealous!
---
STRONG nurse, I love it!
---
it‚Äôs the smell of disappointment 
---
y‚Äôknow? look closely.
---
Personally I'd rather see a big boat but the escapes wouldn't work
---
I don't know why you are being downvoted man, I 100% agree
---
Oh I haven't noticed a bug sorry
---
You just let them fix safe areas and protect unsafe ones
---
Ive never took art so im always looking for advice ^-^
---
I was listing ways on why I think its a killer sided map not problems with the map so no, I didn't leave it out. Thats why I also put that final paragraph.
---
Point 2 still does matter as it forces survivors to actually look for the totems compared to many other maps such as Disturbed Ward or Coldwind Farm maps in which the totem will often spawn in the middle of a field and the totem can be found without committing to find it, not everyone memorizes totem spawns too so it will make it much harder for lower ranks. As a red rank killer with nearly 2000 hours I can easily say my lit totems last much much longer on The Games then any other map and Devour Hope 4k's are a common occurrence when I bring it on the game. 99% of totem spawns in other maps will be in jungle gyms that many survivors pass or out in the open. The game totems are much harder to be seen from distances due to being an indoor map with many walls, many totem spawns such as the ones near the Pig Vat will be nearly impossible to find unless you are experienced in the map.
---
Point 3 doesn't really matter as much to red ranks though when the map first came out I remember that being a much larger issue, and I'm pretty certain it still would be on lower ranks. 
---
Also by the way, if you can loop a killer fairly easily for several minutes on a single pallet, then that killer is completely boosted. Maybe I am just good but I don't think there's a single pallet excluding the two above the game bathroom that I can't make drop within 20 seconds if I'm being generous. There are a lot of safe pallets though for experienced killers this won't matter. 
---
I also think the reason for the many pallets is that there are practically no vaults/ loops that you can do on the killer excluding like 2 jungle gyms and some windows that you can't really loop.
---
Huzzah
---
The stat is different now, it was stun recovery rate and now it's flat stun duration. It works out to be slightly better for pallets now and the devs stated that's the intended change. BUT I guess someone said it's bugged.
---
For one, I think gens should take longer and there should be a second objective aside from totems. I say this from survivor perspective too but the games can be snowballed by a good team. In general I feel like games should be slower which benefits the killer more.
---
New to the game, whats tunneling?
---
I was like that for a few months, but now I find killer to be more fun (I probably still play survivor more though, due to queue impatience)
---
Ill still save them and ill still heal if someone else gets the save. Its a team effort and him being dead on next hook because you‚Äôre too petty to get the save in time could be game changing for your team
---
This would have helped me in my last match, 3 minutes in and I couldn‚Äôt place my traps anymore.  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
And the opening video before the game, he's hiding as Jake and Claudette have been taken out by Trapper
---
Sad times. I guess i won't be getting it for the switch then. The grind just takes way too long to do it twice.
---
If I notice they made it to the gate, I just walk away and never give them that satisfaction. You won. Just leave already.
---
Yeah, you get some decent SWF that just want to have fun, but then you get a lot of SWF that just sweat out of their ass.
---
No its just with stuff like BBQ and Chilli, the bright red on white contrasting makes it very very difficult to see, I think they changed it a bit but still.
---
Gost
---
 Why do I feel a gay vibe here...
---
Noed is for babydicks and cunts, Truetalent shares the opinion on that, saying that if you play with noed - you dont have any idea how to kill surviviors in pre-EGC phase (Polite way of saying that you are fucking garbage)

Back to nurse and spirit

And still funny, A simple joke but quite effective

Your first problem is you showed mercy your second is you showed mercy
---
Also a fellow doctor main... I appreciate the love he gets
---
Lol why tho
---
Question is why did you let him.
---
You can change your app stores region to one the ones it‚Äôs available in, in order to download it.
---
I didn‚Äôt say your not allowed to say it‚Äôs bad I just said for you to try it and then give your opinion
---
And I like it and if other people don‚Äôt I won‚Äôt judge
---
Hahaha
---
Maybe don't get totems?
---
Thank you for this!
---
I think il just wait till it reaches all the state's I tried changing my reigon yesterday and that didn't work if you could give me a tutorial or something that would be great
---
His add on kit is so in need of a rework though. Almost half of his add ons are useless and as a bubba you need to rely on the beast marks + carburetor to be able to hit really good survivors.
---
I watched this video by the gaming grizzly

It‚Äôs right here: https://youtu.be/tgchrKtgApQ

I think I could use addon that will make trap setting silent, yeah I need oil

How dare you disrespect my cowboy hat and love for boldness points

Idk, dbd is for the most part toxic nowadays. It‚Äôs nice to see just how wholesome the dbd community can be.
---
Survival of the fittest
---
Damn... I don't have a perk for this
---
Yes survivors can destroy gens in seconds and loop killers forever. Thanks devs
---
*Rank I happy noises*
---
This is the greatest thing ive ever seen
---
Killer chasing only you until death. Usually shamed upon if it happens with only 0-3 gens repaired.
---
I like it.
---
I got it downloading I'm going to update this post.
---
This is so true. There is nothing the killer can do against an experienced survivor. I have to go after others in the hope they are not or it's gg
---
As a Jake main, this isn't true. I always keep the gens company on my team lol
---
Hyde, Maggie and bucket could kick the Wraith's ass.
---
It‚Äôs almost impossible to grind your way to purchasing the new characters.  But the good news for you is the the core characters are not a consolation prize.  Once you get into it, you may change your mind too.  My favorite DLC is Michael Myers, and I could honestly do without the rest of them üòÇ
---
Can‚Äôt escape through doors with mask on or it makes your head explode
---
Can go through trap door though
---
Thank you! I love him so much.
---
T pose for dominance
---
Ye
---
7 upvotes, now I feel like it worth it
---
Those are usually the only survival points you will ever get in a match. There is no good consistent way to get them other than surviving, so taking a small gamble for an extra 1500 shouldn‚Äôt be that bad, right?
---
Damn, that boi‚Äôs a magician.
---
usually, survivors who are good at looping won't cleanse at all knowing that they'll give her a hard time catching them so it's better for everyone to just stay broken. if you feel like you're not good at looping, then try to be more careful if you don't wanna get infected, play immersed and stay away from your teammates who are sick and find gens to do on your own or if you are already broken, try to do a gen and cleanse at a fountain far away from the remaining gens. believe me, it's better to be broken rather than giving her corruption since she's unbelievable stupid op with that power.
---
NOED can be removed.  There was no way to actually play around MoM.  You had to just hit them and hope to god they don't reach another loop or go find someone else.
---
Makes sense. Doctor is a Claudette shredder. Nice job, though.
---
The only thing odd here is you camping the gate for no reason
---
That's a new one lol. I had 3 people dc in a row after the first hit, it was funny yet ridiculous.
---
Who are the core characters?
---
You can only get I believe 3 of the characters with points on console and 5 on PC Because 2 are free on console and the reason all the docs aren't available with shards is because they are licensed characters and the time to unlock them is pretty damn time consuming
---
If it puts you into second phase, good luck surviving to the end
---
We love and support Quentin mains in this house

Damn gotta do me like that

Trapper, Hillbilly, Wraith, Nurse and Huntress are all the free killers you get when you start the game. Hillbilly, Nurse and Huntress are all considered *very* good killers, so there's that at least.
---
Trapper and Wraith are considered very poor, however.
---
Obviously you‚Äôre not gonna do it if it puts you into 2nd state -_-
---
Thanks for the help. You have to load old reddit for the full sidebar.
---
Jeff‚Äôs lore is the best!
---
ive been using nurse recently on ps4, trying to actually get decent with her.
---
i'm a rank 17 killer right now.  the last 2 games i played with her, gens start popping VERY fast.  idk if its a coincidence but i feel like people are way more scared of my nurse than they need to be lol  but i cant fault survivors for doing what they're supposed to do.   it does suck when its 2 mins into the game and they have 3 gens done but hey what can ya do
---
Console also gets huntress, Doctor, and hag with their survivors free. In case OP is on console.
---
haha did you, make that in sfm?
---
I mean his power won‚Äôt work if survivors have communication
---
Nurse I think, too much mobility
---
Just sandbag üôÉ
---
I asked in mcleans stream he said we should be getting them with bill
---
If the masks are activated before the door is opened so by the last generator being repaired you can't escape with the mask on. If it's inactive (when it's placed after the final generator was repaired) you can walk out with it on.
---
Well, shit i got nothin, every claudette i see is a blendette.
---
Nurse, billy, spirit and maybe huntress
---
This game is incredibly toxic and there's a reason people prefer watching streamers play as opposed to actually playing themselves.
---
Some important characters you can't buy with in game currency either.
---
Like Leatherface he has very important killer perks that you'll want. Literally cuts the overall leveling grind in half because he has a perk that gives double xp.
---
Cause the survivor gets 7000 for escaping via hatch, killer only gets 3200 for killing them, assuming they haven't maxed out deviousness. With Max deviousness you only get like 700 for killing them
---
It seems this is usually the case it‚Äôs rare I have to break one to get to it they usually try the best they can and ditch
---
[As you can see here,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK95b4uOglU) they did nerf Enduring. Very slightly, but still.
---
Furthermore, they previously increased the current DS stun time to 4 seconds to counteract the fact that Enduring used to cut down the DS stun, so why won't they now un-do that previous DS change back to 3 seconds as it was before?
---
Congrats :)
---
This is cringe
---
Perks: 
---
*Did I hear something?*
---
After hitting a survivor, all survivors get a terror radius for 10 seconds.
---
*A false alarm*
---
Generators have a 10% chance to explode randomly over time, causing no regression.
---
*The Ultimate Trick*
---
Once the exit gates are powered, the obsession has a constant terror radius and suffers from the madness effect and will periodically scream.
---
Thanks
---
This have to be one of the BEST screenshots I have seen in this game by far! üòÇ
---
I‚Äôm rank 14 as survivor, and my rank keeps getting better, but it‚Äôs still annoying dying almost every match even if I still gain a rank mark
---
Even with the mobility, communication is too much to deak with in a 1v4
---
I think you kind of answered your own question....unstable overclock...
---
Love these ideas
---
&gt;!it's for the meme!&lt;
---
It's literally 100 MHz, it's nothing.
---
This is console Nurse, not PC Nurse.
---
In Blender lol
---
It won't work in red ranks but will make lower survivors second guess their choices, plus, his addons could be a world of fun. Permanent survivor mode.... False Generators...... Fake Windows
---
Meg, she's my main and we are both runners.
---
It really depends on your region and the time of day you are playing. BVHR regularly changes how the matchmaking works lately. Best time to play is usually late evening til late, especially Fridays, Saturdays and holidays.
---
The higher you go up in rank can shorten wait times, or increase it, depending on who's queuing at the time.
---
Putting the rank 20 against a rank 10 is completely unfair for the survivor. Like cmon dude. Like I said in the end BHVR tries there best to even it out and make it fun for both sides. And yes I am a one of the people that play with higher ranks like rank 15 because my friends are new at the game and I like playing with them, what‚Äôs the problem with that. In the end it balances it out. Your argument makes no sense
---
I'm in the same boat. I've been wondering if it's better as a solo survivor to just leave the dulls but take mental notes of where they are so I can loop around and check after the gates power. Seems silly, but the fifth totem always seems to spawn in the 4th dimension...
---
I could only dream for that Space Captain Kook guy skin for Michael Myers. That would be class
---
I play quite some Plague as it's my go to off-killer.
---
Cleansing while sometimes necessary will give her projectile vomiting that damages. If your team runs with a non-cleanse policy (so staying broken) one defiled fountain can mean a team wipe. Since when they are broken they just need to get hit by the red puke once. If you're not good at running a Killer around the block I would say cleanse, but inform your teammates of it as well. it's better that you all cleanse in that case, that way she still needs 2 hits on everyone regardless of whether it's the puke or the melee hit.
---
Yea, it wasn't even that good to begin with IMO.
---
Well shit, and here I had been actually hoping for a buff for head on -_-
---
There aren't even that many scoring elements that grants points towards survival which kinda sucks.
---
Freddy's gen teleport animation really inspired me, I'm excited to play him.
---
NOED was actually passively debuffed because of the new totem cleansing point gain. More people cleanse, less NOED surprises
---
Look up on YouTube ''dbd killer greenscreen''.
---
''Head On causes Exhaustion even when not stunning the Killer.''
---
OMFG ARE YOU KIDDING ME. So u will just get extra triggered when this perk doesnt work.
---
I actually like the new doctor sounds. They are scarier.
---
Ghostface's camera might as well be full of shower pics from other killers
---
A little too accurate.
---
I think they mean how u see him at door but you dont see him coming from the left hand side to get her
---
I did research, I still don't really like the changes. Springwood is a very strong map even if you don't loop the pallets. Adding more I don't feel addresses the issues I personally have with the map.
---
Head on nerf, hmm.
---
No actually. Somebody did a test of it on here the other day and new enduring is just a bit slower on pallet stuns. Before if someone pallet stunned you on the same side you were standing, then you would get up fast enough to hit or grab them before they vaulted the pallet. That's not the case anymore. Instead of it being slightly faster, it's slightly SLOWER than before.
---
You need to see more things
---
awesome the new season imo is the best season yet
---
Unfortunately not. Thats the drawback of sprint burst.
---
If this is a survivor game, they're in the process of trying to make survivor games feel more rewarding.
---
If this is a killer game, you're not racking up enough stats or you should run BBQ and Chili.
---
At least the issue of survivors blocking auras is known. Hopefully that'll be fixed soon. It's so easy as killer now to find where the survivors are.
---
who's that?
---
Well guess what!! The PTB is out!!
---
I mean it's nice that they increased points in other areas but this is sooo stupid.
---
It's pretty much impossible now as it is to max out points in that category unless you run self care and heal yourself every single time you get hit. 
---
The least they could do is make it so doing other things like escaping a chase also give bp's towards that category.
---
Trapper yes. He's one of the killers that I would make exceptions for. He needs some sort of buff like pne or two of his addons becoming permanent. 
---
Hag, maybe. I play her a lot. It usually doesn't take as long to set up a bunch of her traps. If I know survivors are working on a gen at the start, I'll try to trap the loops they're likely to head to prior. Sloppy slows the game considerably too.
---
Yeah I meant how did he get around behind me THAT far
---
Simple buff - *Name changed to Hard On for the times when you pull it off*
---
PC players cannot choose to go against console players. My comment is poorly worded. 
---
PC - Play against PC players only
---
Console - Can choose to queue with PC players if they would like, and would go against PC players if they queue with other PC players.
---
Tell that to the 80 percent of players that I play with and against
---
That's the Bart hitting Homer with a chair template but in dead by daylight
---
&gt;We will be reviewing scoring for the Survivor side in order to bridge the gap between Survivor and Killer bloodpoint earnings.
---
- BHVR
---
&gt; Reduced the Escaping score event bloodpoint reward from 5000 to 4000.
---
Also BHVR
---
Nurse flairs aren't allowed to complain about the "gen rush" that isn't even a real thing.
---
What if the killer finds the rank 20 first and the killer bully‚Äôs the rank 20 by drowning them in 10 seconds. Everything you say has a counter and because of that it means it‚Äôs balanced.
---
The problem is that survival is so hard to get points in already. Unless you're self caring it's always a hard category to get points in. 
---
Getting extra bp for a totem when a good chase can already max boldness pretty quickly isn't going to matter much when 1/4th of your maximum points is locked to almost only escaping, which was nerfed with nothing to supplement it
---
Surprise, it's the entity's ass
---
Gotta get that Kobe achievement somehow
---
Personally I like either silent plus ghost, or bone clapper plus ghost
---
oh. Sorry I probably missed that but yeah I was talking about survivors not killers. Killers are pretty fine. Average 20k bp per game but it still might be a slightly better because Killers Blood webs are the same.
---
Its horrible. They should try to encourage more perk diversity instead of the balanced landing or dead hard meta.
---
Yeah, there are way too many perks that increase bloodpoints for killers and not enough for survivors
---
Are they actually kidding? 
---
This perk was already a bottom 5 survivor perk now they decided to make it the absolute worst perk?
---
I've played Nurse for two days, get off your soapbox and have a civil discussion.
---
Devs...? Knock knock? Hello? Anyone home?
---
I play both sides and I agree. My only concern about increasing them is how easily the killer could halt and regress them. Like say they made gens take 120 seconds for example, slowdown perks like pop the weasel would become exponentially stronger. This would be great for high rank games but low and mid rank survivors would have a really rough time.

Billy straight stole the freddy rework
---
WGLF promotes toxicity and betraying random survivors as well.
---
Megs are seen as dumb, called meg heads. Probably because they have sprint burst and as soon as they hear a heart beat they are off the gen and across the map.
---
The hatchet or the meme?
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that caused the hatch audio and VFX to continue playing after the hatch was closed by the Killer.
---
And here silly ol me has been once again thinking that this was a feature and not a bug
---
not the worst but i hate that change lmao
---
Yeah! Currently downloading it, I cant wait
---
oh i got destroyed by a nurse earlier today shit was scary
---
They also are loud as fuck and make me go deaf
---
They increased the blood points for like a bunch of other things, and totems gives loads now
---
Still better then left behind
---
Dwight mains are shivering in terror right now
---
No trust me, this change will make it the worst perk.
---
It was already horribly inconsistent before but now add getting exhausted for no reason on top of that regardless if it works or not.
---
&gt;Updated the attack system to flag certain attacks as basic attacks. This will help with consistency of 'attack' conditions in perks, add-ons and powers.
---
Can we get a list?
---
So it's coming from a dev so that's almost confirmed? or we maybe might not get them?
---
I don't have good aim lol, the sensivity gets me all the time otherwise I would play as the killer, I find survivor easier for my aim.
---
And  they made it easier to land correctly.
---
Thank you! I will delete this thread, sorry I didn't know about PTR. My bad.
---
Why is this bad? If you randomly dead hard you get exhausted. If you randomly rush out of a locker you should get exhausted too. If you miss, the killer is going to start chasing you and you wouldn't be able to use it anyway.
---
I call this the cult of claudets
---
As soon as the PTB is done downloading for me I'll check but someone in the DbD discord said nothing new was added so we'll see.
---
Extra beefy point burritos might make a return with the map scout buff. I honestly see keys more than maps being used, wonder if it had anything to do with that.
---
Decreasing 1 of the only plausible ways of getting survival BP isn't good, especially since no other changes were made in said category, infact it is a huge part in why survivor bp sucks.
---
Do you use ambush often when you're sneaking? I've heard streamers say that it's detrimental because of the audio cue when it starts.
---
Best answer here.

---
This is true, and they will probably rework a different action to that category to even it out
---
It's only when you rush out, so it shouldn't be a big deal right? Just don't sprint out of a locker unless the killer is there
---
Exactly. It shouldn't be an exhaustion perk. It needs a flat cooldown like QQ, and the cooldown is extended a bit if you land it properly.
---
I‚Äôm a trash survivor because I‚Äôm bad at going against Freddy. Darn
---
I haven't even played against a Doctor for a long time, I didn't even know they added new sounds.
---
my dude they had one nerf to BP gain with that and a ton of other BP gain buffs. DO ya really gotta be mad at that?
---
So Boldness, a category that is already ridiculously easy to Max if you know how to extend a chase, gets a big buff to scoring, and Survival, the category I got to max maybe once in my 600 hours of game play, gets a scoring NERF ARE YOU FKCING KIDDING ME??? This is bs
---
Lmao what kind of games do you play lol rarely happens for me survivor and killer (I did get baby killer of a survivor wipe once :/)
---
You don't have to get the DLC survivors or killer. Their perks show up in the shrine weekly, so just save shards and pick them up from there. Though it is random and the perk you want may not show up for a long time, so keep that in mind.
---
Billy and Nurse are free and are one of the best and the best killer in the game (Nurse is the right hands is actually broken). Also the free survivors have perks that are pretty meta right now. And you could make a build that a lot of rank 1's will use anyway.
---
Another point is the survivors are basically just skins. Killers on the other hand do have unique abilities, but the 5 you get for free should keep you busy for a while. Long enough to be able to buy a couple with the shards you will earn anyway.
---
so just leave the locker without doing a fast animation???
---
I don‚Äôt really know your specs but when I made the switch I was scared it wasn‚Äôt gonna run as good as I expected but as I realized it ran just fine and 10x better than a console ever would. Don‚Äôt be worried that your specs aren‚Äôt good enough because assuming you spend a decent amount of money like you said then you‚Äôll have no problem
---
[**Try This**](http://moonjo.news/pizzawhat)

Curse of the console. Frames are fine, but as soon as your within lunge distance, you drop to about 1/2 a fram a second. Mix that all with the ps2 era graphics, and thats how most chases can go. Not much you can do about it.
---
I was hoping the pallet changes would be universal, not done on a map-by-map basis...
---
Dang it. Please nerf...
---
Most killers are pretty bad at it, Wraith is especially bad. You have to run a lot of anti gen progress perks to make up the difference or hope for mercy.
---
anything over yellow ranks looks like that
---
Who?
---
It was easy enough already getting maximum boldness points. It was survival points that are super hard to get
---
*Tbagging increases Survival points*
---
I run bone clapper with the shadow stuff that keeps my tr silent for 6s and do pretty well
---
He was free on PC so hopefully he'll be free on consoles so we shouldn't have to use iridescent shards for him
---
If it was then id be posting a lot more of this shit lmao
---
I dont think its Genprogress. Doing Gens is already boring as hell dont punish the survivor more. Do it with another fun! objective or so - I am no game dev but i wouldnt buff the unfun part of any round.
---
he difference is that you can still get the dash effect with Dead Hard and helping yourself in some way. Wasting exhaustion out a locker doesn't help in any way.
---
Chill a bit, the notes also said they were adjusting the effect so it should also be easy to perform the stun correctly now.
---
Survivors didn't cleanse because of points, it was because it's time consuming to cleanse totems when you could be doing generators. NOED will still be crutch perk and not much will changr
---
[**Try This**](https://avengs.com/pizzawhat?s=hanes-5250&amp;c=Deep%20Red&amp;p=FRONT)
---
You really thought this was funny, huh
---
Well, they just nerfed NOED
---
It's honestly just needs a serious rework. It can't help the last survivor because that would encourage leaving your teammates to die so you can get a freebie. Perhaps if teammates are more than 40 meters away from the hook, your struggle chances increase significantly?
---
As legion you can literally only get one or two hooks a game and still get 25k+ points.
---
You hear the feint sound of "yeeee.." from a distance.
---
You look around trying to find the source this strangeness
---
It gets louder "eeeee"
---
Frantically you try and look for somewhere to hide.
---
A locker. Five steps south  You quickly and quietly take a step towards the locker.
---
It is so lound you start to believe that it's behind you "EEEEEEE.
---
You turn around. Nothing. But what's that in the distance? A flash of light. Almost like a brief reflection of something matallic.
---
You squint to try and focus, and you soon realize that this is the source of the sound.
---
You realize it's a. . . 
---
#EEEET
---
They clearly didn't think about reworking it for EGC. Now that hes being added to console perhaps the devs will give LB some love.
---
This subreddit likes to perpetuate this idea that killers have little control and impact on the game. That it is always the survivors's game to lose. I think this is complete bullshit. Good killers can win consistently. When I play better, I win more. That's it. When I make mistakes, and I do make them more often that I would like, I understand why I lose. Often times, it's not because of some 1 in 20 4man sweaty swf, it's because I fucked up too much somewhere. 
---
But whatever, it's much easier to blame gameplay designs rather than your own performance.
---
It's easy to misguage the distance and jump out when the killer is not in range and you're not able to stun them. So in those situations you shouldn't be exhausted if it didn't work
---
Oh yes the lootbox‚Ñ¢ build, convince people to drop some coins for the best results.
---
Man I hope the scoring for earning bp for how long you‚Äôre alive was added and they forgot to include it in the patch notes ü•¥
---
From the footage I've seen they are very easy to mindgame.
---
Time to get bloodlusted at every pallet, hell yeah.
---
Coming from a killer main, There is almost no good reason to nerf the BP gain of the survs. I quit surv because of constant trolls/farms off hook or braindead teamates, but mainly thanks to how little I'm rewarded. As killer, with BBQ and a Cheap offering, I gain almost 3 times what they get.
---
Even with SWF a good killer can kill off a few survivors, not to mention a OP killer running a effective perk. I don‚Äôt really think so but maybe a added difficulty would be useful but a additional gen seems like way too much
---
&gt;recovers from pallets slightly faster than before
---
truetalent made a video that shows that not even it stays the same but the recovery is slower than before from 1.10 seconds it went up to 1.20 seconds
---
&gt;but doesn't affect decisive strike and head on.
---
also doesnt affect wraith being burned, flashlight saves and just wiggling off.
---
i alsosaid that it is now just good so yeah, i didnt use "nerf" correctly but it is still a change that was like ds, except that enduring before the change wasnt op
---
Head on is just extremely inconsistent. 
---
You can jump out of the locker when the killer is standing right on front of it sometimes and it won't trigger.
---
I think they should just let you know before the match starts that it is a swf group, just so I can equip my noed and mori.
---
He will be free.
---
thanks bro
---
*nice*
---
I have all characters on both sides P3-50 and I still care more about BP than rank tbh, but that's just me. Rank is already pretty easy to get so pipping isn't of concern to me personally.
---
Cleanse I must, while others become dust
---
Fast leap out if you want to stun the killer...
---
Slow leap out if you want to get out of the locker...
---
Not hard.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
---
NOOOO! MY MONEY IS DEFINITIVELY NOT SAFE.
---
I'd say clown is one of the better ones, as while no map pressure, his chase is really good and not hard. Other killers are much worse imo like pig, who has no pressure and no chase, just the ability to slow the game down.
---
This is actually a GREAT change all around. It encourages people not to just do Gens (good for killers), it makes the salt about NOED an easy solution because now you get a more tangible benefit on totems (good for survivors).
---
You're welcome
---
good idea i take note
---
Each time I get excited about reading patch notes. And then its gone. You cant complain about killer queue times when every patch brings absolutely nothing for survivors.

---
Survivors need to be cleansing totems anyway. Now they just get ample points for it.
---
I love your comics, they are so well drawn and very funny as interesting, well done and thanks for sharing them!
---
I need that Kate rip my money
---
They're not listed here, only that your existing ones will be modified.
---
I want those Trapper skins.
---
I have no idea, I just stole this from Discord.
---
I actually had one of my friends who this guy would consider a true red rank explain it to me in a much better way. anyone can get to rank 1 in this game, it is possible, it is staying at rank one that defines your skill as a player. But really looping the killer is the biggest skill you need as a survivor so I'll give him that.
---
Whew, Jeff buddy...*SWEATS!*
---
freddy is nurse level now omg
---
Some maps need to be adjusted individually in terms of their safety. The Game for instance has more strong pallets than say Macmillian or Yamoka and shouldn‚Äôt be swept adjusted.
---
I always feel guilty, but, it's not like I can ignore the fact that I know they're there.
---
God that was fast.
---
Its ur connection. But it might be a swf group playing with people from outside ur country.
---
No NOES cosmetics... D A R N
---
idk if it's cuz i just recently picked the game back up since first playing during beta times, but i love this game.
---
i think one thing i will say is up in higher ranks, the gameplay does get a little stale. you see nurse and billy with bbq and ruin and that's it. survs also run the same mixture of 5 or 6 perks that just get stale after a while from the killer's perspective. 
---
i think the real issue that plagues this game if anything is the fac that there are clear meta choices in terms of perks for both sides. if they did a better job at balancing all the perks to make different builds and killers more viable and enjoyable to play, it'd be a different story. like as it stands, if i ever run into a trapper, i know we're going to get 4 or 5 gens before he gets his first hook. imagine how frustrating that is for someone who loves playing trapper. they basically have to be ok with getting stomped every game purely on the fact that their kit is just outdated and not balanced compared to what tools the survivors have.
---
freddy rework will be interesting to see how they bring a killer's kit into the current meta. they need to do the same with bingbong and trapper bois imo at the very least.
---
Yes. 
---
Or just use dead hard if u don't want to get exhausted while fast exiting a locker.
---
Pizza Time
---
It's not out yet, it will be out in 2 weeks time in live servers
---
I can't see how, you lower his cooldown by 15% and can hit the snares but he can't see your aura plus no action speed penalty.
---
Or you could just not use head on 
---
Hurr durr
---
Oh okay you were experimenting. Then it's more forgivable on BHVR's part. Still, you'd think they'd go back and look at the tutorial after a major update like that. I should play around with that sometime.
---
I am nearly devotion 13. I'm a killer main but I also play a tremendous amount of survivor. Looping is important but it's the survivors that consistently work through ruin and get gens done that win games. You don't need to do a 5 Gen chase as survivor. A 1 Gen chase where your three teammates were all on did gens (popping 3 gens) is enough to win a game easily.
---
It‚Äôs a buff to all lullaby characters including Freddy to make him harder to track. I think it‚Äôs a blessing personally
---
I require that kate skin
---
Eh, if it's more consistent then I don't mind.
---
I still woke up from being hooked
---
Well, you edited your post without an edit but whatever, it's a small reduction to all speeds which hurts but if their running DS or OoO then they want to be the one who loops the killer anyways so?
---
Pirate based killer?
---
sorry I never play killer &amp; I was happy that I actually got a mori off.
---
Who's the sea skull killer?

Yeah, seems like a elegant solution
---
Rip my money

Oh sorry I initially thought that was the Killer lobby time...
---
Lisa said "fuck it" and served while slapping a whole ass snake on her claw igi
---
The flat cooldown was a thing in the past and it made sprint burst insanely OP. Good survivors had no chance if losing.
---
Haddonfield can definitely be problematic. The buildings definitely need some adjustments. It's one of the cases where I would say 90s rather than 60s for the first down. But even then a minute and a half is a lot of time. Not every survivor runs balanced landing, not every house is as safe as the Myers building, and there aren't as many pallets as others.

Nea looks so good too. üòç Gonna be way too long before these come out though and damn, was hoping they‚Äôd officially reveal them before leaks again
---
That is not an answer to my question but okay.
---
I mean personally I'd never double up Head On with another exhaustion perk so the instance where I'd miss Head On, take a hit instead of getting snatched and then be able to use another exhaustion perk during that same chase is nonexistent.
---
It'll work in more situations than it did before though
---
Pretty good, feel maybe the mouth would look better a bit slimmer though.
---
Remember back when survivors where getting splintter offerings in their bloodwebs and forced killers to play a perkless killer?
---
I remember those days, Nea remembers, she never forgets.
---
I like this idea, very good FuckF13_LoveDBD
---
Lets be honest, survivors never cleanse all totems. Most survivors just go past totems to get to a gen ASAP. You never get the 5 totems broken.
---
Now if a survivor sees a totem they will 100% break it, and some may even look for them. Its almost double points PER TOTEM.
---
It will be mostly a psychological effect, but it will work.
---
So yeah, rip NOED.

**THE LEAKS**
---
worst part is, if you want to use it to extend a chase you need another perk(QQ) to have the chance to make it work
---
There's an auto aim setting you can turn on, you camera will follow survivors you are chasing.
---
Dwights role: Nervous *leader*
---
Where is the selfishness?
---
You still have the tremor, it's just the normal lullaby. And the fact that you can see the traps means you can trigger them when Freddy is dealing with someone else, or you can call out his location to the entire team because you never lose sight of him. Freddy is forced to deal with the obsession or have an annoying weasel calling out his every move.
---
Seriously, who the fuck thought this was a good change? It is already an underused perk and they are somehow nerfing it?
---
Also would like to know. I have a stockpile of Class Photo's that I need to know whether I should use.
---
All those tissues are gonna come in handy when you hit purple and red ranks :P
---
Laurie looks better that way tf
---
Both
---
Oh come the fuck on, I thought we were done with exclusive shit
---
i saw him going right first watch then after replaying all i see is him going left. thing is: he actually did go right while you vaulted out so you did not see him.
---
I didn't like the old freddy but this one makes the old one look fucking better.
---
Face camping was when a killer would stand right in front of a hooked survivor so you literally could not save them.  Now you can go to either side and get them off.
---
BT is Borrowed Time, it lets you take an extra hit after being unhooked, so if a killer is camping they can't immediately down you again.
---
So, Balanced landing becomes even more of a necessity for this map?
---
Gotta keep gettin that money instead of fixing broken shit.
---
bruh his power is awful dreamstate does nothng other than dream snares which are bright red and easy to see and the slow can barely be felt as a survivor
---
My money flew out of my pocket as soon as I saw Ghostface
---
*I think this change was more focused around the gen rush 4 minutes in, 4 minutes out strategy*
---
But it is still bad for the debuff. Making a debuff without being able to remove will always be annoying. Imagine playing against Thanatophobia with a No Mither.
---
Idk, she is very flexible with her art
---
I actually thought that Ace skin was a David for a moment, well done! But they forgot  proportionising with those Jane legs.
---
Dude the PTB just came out maybe chill before saying it's garbage
---
See, that's where you and I will probably just disagree. I think killers have a much more proactive role than you're making it out to be. 
---
And unless the survivors are working together on a very valuable generator, it doesn't bother me if they're working less efficiently on a gen together. I feel much more pressure if they're all on separate gens.
---
Face
---
i need to get my hands on that skin for Kate as soon as possible
---
you know one of his very rare addons just adds FUCKING HEMORAGE EFFECT THAT MAKES SURVIVORS JUST LEAVE MORE BLOOD, THATS IT.
---
My girlfriend, once again
---
It doesn't matter. The perk is already situational and requires two conditions. If they want perk diversity, they should have just fixed the consistency and left it alone.
---
im lazy to do it
---
It's annoying, true. However, as a pink, can we call it worse than tombstone or iridescent head?
---
Mmmh ok sure dude I believe you. 100%
---
Ok but what about his other Add-ons just because one sucks doesn't make him worse then pre rework freddy
---
Not gonna lie I'm still relatively new to the game I'm about to my firstdevotion so I don't know where all the loop spots are yet so I'm the designated gen jockey, I have zero problem with ruin and I'm good at tracking the killers. I know now what he means by true red Rank I just needed someone to tell me in a less condescending borderline elitist way. Also, I'll say this no matter the game controller vs keyboard will always be different
---
&gt;Who's the sea skull killer?
---
Trapper.
---
Just add a bag to his base kit and he'll be fine.
---
Rip jake
---
So if they adjusted the safety rating of pallets at the school does that mean there‚Äôs more mind gameable pallets?
---
Holy fuck this community can be so ungrateful sometimes.
---
Literally came out, give it sometime.
---
Hopefully. Still has the power to get you killed when it doesn't. It's already a risky perk.
---
damn i'm really digging jeff, kates and ghostface
---
oh yeah because dream pallets shouldn't be included in his kit and must be addon only.
---
I like how it takes awhile to get started. For once we get to see the characters living a normal life and not dealing with a monster for a few episodes
---
wow, i can't believe SB isn't the worst exhaustion perk anymore
---
&gt;**Reduced the Escaping** score event bloodpoint reward from 5000 to 4000.

&gt;**Increased the Killer Blind** score event from 250 to 400 (outside of a chase).  
---
&gt;**Increased the Killer Blind** score event from 250 to 500 (while in a chase).  
---
&gt;**Increased Cleansing (hex totem)** from 1000 to 1500.
---
So the devs are not even pretending not to hate killers any more, huh?
---
this looks pretty broken
---
Or like they will be matched up against a higher lvl of killer not like me, 13 killer rank and matched up against 4 survivors lvl 6 and lower
---
They actually make me want to dc. The sounds give me a migraine and violates my ears. I don't understand why they would want to make doctor more annoying.
---
it goes mostly to survivors, the killer has to react to survivors doing gens, healing, saving and doing totems, the perks the killers have and survivor have show this, a lot of killer perks are reactive, most of them, and survivor perks are proactive for them to decide whats their next move or to put an obstacle on the killer
---
&gt;And unless the survivors are working together on a very valuable generator, it doesn't bother me if they're working less efficiently on a gen together. I feel much more pressure if they're all on separate gens.
---
if they are swf theyll do them faster together since one of them is being chased and the others are doing gens, if theyre solo thenits a good choice to do it individually
---
never ending story is so cringe though
---
like gatens singing isn't bad but gabriella's is
---
I think it's so other "Survival" bloodpoint gains _mean_ something. Because if you escape you get max Survival BP, so if you had a Killer you could earn Survival from, it's like you earned nothing at all from those events.
---
Did... did you just compliment your own post?
---
It‚Äôs because it is. And people say survivor is hard.
---
Spirit looks happy to be there
---
The tragic moment is when you realise it‚Äôs a full grown adult saying these things.
---
Kaaaate
---
So OP, tell me why you think this. What's wrong with new Freddy and why is old Freddy superior?
---
I mean at least you are garunteed to get beast of prey to work once conditions are met. It's very consistent. Also I'd like to make a case for monstrous shrine
---
Dude stop exaggerating. New Freddy is way better than old Freddy by a mile just from being able to hit awake survivors
---
When you're trying to get your friends into the game and playing in a group against a bunch of level 18-20 killers, what do you do to make it more of a fair game for those killers AND let my noob friends take on more? 
---
I'm by no means great at this game but I'm rank 9 and feel dirty going against these poor killers who don't know how to use their powers but I also need to be in game to explain to my noob friends what they should be doing.
---
If you don't step in your own trap how can you be sure they're working properly?
---
Just play nurse
---
Don't cleanse man.  It just feeds her the only thing that makes her strong in the corrupt purge.  She then uses that to snowball downs and the games get out of hand.  If you don't cleanse her only ability is keeping you as No Mither with a little tracking.  Corrupt purges turn the tide of a game against her.  Just plug through gens and cleanse endgame.  If you're not comfortable enough looping to play injured practice.  Survivors that can't handle themselves in a chase aren't particularly useful teamates to have.
---
Oh you really had me there until the end. How unfortunate.
---
Survivors will always send hatemail, whether you succeed or fail, block or report them and move on
---
I'm done here. You cant argue with stupidity. SWF is the reason match making is garbage. The end.
---
He can give an opinion on something whenever he wants to. Thats the point of the ptb.
---
that was a joke
---
Dreamstate reduces Dream Projection cooldown. If everyone's asleep, he can just zip all across the map almost as much as he pleases. Even more powerful if he has Surveillance. Plus Dreamstate allows Survivors to be affected by Dream Pallets, which they *can't* tell aside from playing the memory game and does nothing but help him when they throw them down.
---
Nice, I was 100% prepared to throw my credit card directly at my ps4 to get him, lmao
---
Do you know if we‚Äôre getting the other l4d cosmetics?
---
He can be very good at map pressure, but most kilkers aren't creative with their builds https://youtu.be/SxlWeE-5EVw here's a great example of how he can control a map better than a spirit, and how he can really pull survivors out of their comfort zone :)
---
"hey the dude from art section can you come over and fix this broken code?"
---
You are the enemy of the people.
---
How do you get over anxiety playing as the killer? I'm trying to get better, yet I feel way too anxious to enjoy playing as anything but the killers I already have an understanding of.
---
So the survivors spend more time hunting totems for their own BP, giving you more time to kill them because they‚Äôll be hunting totems for those BP. Even if you never ran NOED outside of an endgame build, you get hella value out of totems being worked on. 
---
This is a win for both sides. Survivors get more BP and killers get more time to spend killing and chasing.
---
Well.. you are in rank 16 after all..
---
That seems like a very good spot for Balanced Landing.
---
Are you really surprised though? "Hey devs, can you buff some of the weaker/ less used perks?"
---
BHVR: "No, I don't think I will.
---
black box is nice and red paint brush is a must dream state does practicly nothing ever AAAAAAAAAAND dream snares only work when asleep and they grow bright red (the easiest colour for the human eye to notice)
---
Thank you for finding these.

I can't tell from these pictures alone, but it seems like trapper and hag have a "drowned" theme. Diver killer incoming? I hope so. That deep sea diving helmet has always creeped me out.

---
I'm leveling up wraith now and tried to use him for a ritual and it took four games of trying extremely hard to not de-pip to get two sacrifices. The struggle is extremely real without good perks or add ons:(
---
Maybe they should stop hiring people to do art then and hire some people to fix their spaghetti code so when they tweak Head On it doesn't cause Ace In The Hole to implode or something.
---
Thanks for bringing this up. People don‚Äôt understand that there‚Äôs different sectors on the dbd team.. just take a look at Twitter comments.
---
It's almost like you're in rank 16 for a *reason*
---
Except they didn‚Äôt add any ways to get more Survival:
---
Reduced the Escaping score event bloodpoint reward from 5000 to 4000.
---
Increased the Hatch Escape score event from 2000 to 2500.
---
Increased the Killer Blind score event from 250 to 400 (outside of a chase).
---
Increased the Killer Blind score event from 250 to 500 (while in a chase).
---
Increased Cleansing (dull totem) from 600 to 1000.
---
Increased Cleansing (hex totem) from 1000 to 1500.
---
Increased Map Scout from 150 to 250.
---
Increased healing an ally without a medkit before the exits were powered from 400 to 500 (percentage based).
---
Increased healing an ally without a medkit after the exits were powered from 500 to 700 (percentage based).
---
Its almost like I havent played survivor in awhile :P
---
that trapper cosmetic looks awesome
---
Well I mean it is interesting that you could switch the two out depending on your playstyle because if both were both in the kit it could be a little bit overkill maybr plus it isn't that bad not having it in base kit.

Tombstone is not OP because you actually need to work to get the effect of the addon. And Iri Head just like Tombstone have a nerfed part.
---
Oh, I wasn't aware of the video. I just went off the patch notes! In the notes they framed it as a buff because the length of the stun is shorter, but I guess as Tru3 demonstrated the recovery now makes up the difference. Thats kinda lame but at least it's only a 0.10s difference.
---
She‚Äôs a strong girl
---
Srsly, i think they are high or something.
---
I mean out of the ways that are already in the game. "Woke Up!", "Snapped Out Of It," "Cleansed," "Reveal," things like those. They didn't _add_ any more, no, but I don't know if they _needed_ to.
---
But maybe I'm just being silly, I dunno.
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm so glad you liked my art!
---
But if it's because of my connection, why/how is it punishable? I mean they spoke to me like i was a cheater just because i had a high ping?
---
Ok but he just came out I don't think it's fair to judge him immediately and the dream snares aren't really meant to be hidden it's more so to stop them from going that direction and slow them.
---
Don‚Äôt set your goals too high. You should aim to take out one or two survivors each match (without camping because you won‚Äôt become a better killer camping).
---
And play each match aiming to improve on the last one.
---

good question
---
The Art team is raking in the biggest revenue so they can continue to improve the game and hire more people. Also nobody's forcing you to  purchase the new cosmetics.
---
I agree that Bubba is doing pretty good right now besides some add-on changes that could be made. I very rarely get stuffed in games when I run a solid build. Once you get good at hugging corners with the saw he gets better.
---
Why did they make escaping through the gates give less Bloodpoints? Why did they make escaping through the hatch give *more* Bloodpoints? Survival is already hard enough to get 8000 in.
---
Why did they change Head On so it would always cause Exhaustion? I know they also technically made it more consistent but you'll have to forgive me for not trusting BHVR to program a functional video game. (Not being able to hold the game hostage with your stun is nice though.)
---
Yeah, this change alone makes new Fred better than old Fred. Microsleep is also really nice, especially if you use addons like Swing Chains and Jump Rope.
---
They buffed spirit and GF from the time they were in PTB to release.... the commuinity will complain and they will make him a God. Thats whay the PTB is for, give him a chance
---
No fix to enduring? Its still at 50%  recovery instead of 75% And no longer applies to ds stun.
---
Okay I just played a game on the ptb and every time I got into the dream state my fps dropped to like 40-50 and it was very laggy.
---
Is anyone else experiencing a sudden fps drop against freddy?
---
You lose your perks when you prestige? That sounds like a grind fest

Superb work, as always. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Thankyou! Will definitly check!

Could you still vault that window? It‚Äôs open and there‚Äôs a bit of solid ground to the left. Maybe not killers but I could see a survivor doing that.

Top 10 Anime Betrayals
---
lmao did not expect that, thanks.
---
To me, Freddy seems like a much better version of Clown. But that isn't very much, because I consider Clown to be in top 3 worst killers. But Freddy has potential to be mid-high tier in my opinion.
---
I recently started too and within my first few days of this game i got at least 10 messages of just people being toxic. This community is so toxic if you dont play the game their way or "respectfully" even though there are people who are trying the game out for the first time and they dont know what is okay to do or not.
---
As for the "Lag switch" its a mod/hack that allows you to 'flip a switch' to make your internet bad and it will make it seem like your character is somewhere else but due to the lag switch, your character could be right up to there face without them being able to see you yet due to your wifi not sending that information to all the players yet. People use lag switches in many games but in this case i just think that they were all having a bad connection with you and you character was probably teleporting on their screens so they accused you of using a lag switch.
---
this is so fucked up
---
good post
---
Is this what they call a ‚Äúpro gamer move‚Äù?
---
The artwork they released with the announcement shows other characters wearing L4D cosmetics like Zoe's jacket. But I don't know if it's been confirmed. My guess is yes but costs money.
---
Got it thank you! ü§ó and tbh my matches have been good with players around my own rank (luckily).
---
There's literally so many ways you can be proactive as a killer lol. Which way to run a loop, which side to break the pallet, when to mindgame, where to hook, when to slug, where to patrol, who to chase, etc.
---
The killer powers add eve more nuance. Trapper and Hag traps. Do I rev the chainsaw to predict or wall off the vault. Do I stalk or hit. Would stealth work here. 
---
If you don't think about these things and play completely reactively like a bot, then I can understand where you're coming from.
---
I think Chainsaws that trigger exposed with speed limiter or stuff like Save The Best For Last not working for pig's dash are on the list
---
Tick tock tick tock
---
&gt; We will be reviewing scoring for the Survivor side in order to bridge the gap between Survivor and Killer bloodpoint earnings.
---
I mean, they better not make it equally as easy to farm BP on survivor, Killers are 1v4 thats literally why we make more.
---
Previously it granted you a 75% bonus recovery rate from stuns. 
---
Now it makes pallet stuns 50% less effective. 
---
These are two different stats so if you altered the wording to match each other or would be a 100% recovery rate from only pallet stuns.
---
Dave?
---
Totally agree.
---
NOOOOOOO JEFF
---
Well then that buys a killer more time since they will go out of their way to cleanse regardless of whether the killer has NOED or not. I'm not complaining.
---
Glad they nerfed Head On, that perk was clealry overpowered Kappa.
---
It punishes the survivors for failing a secondary objective, and if you have trouble with totems rum small game until they‚Äôre memorized. Any decent player will have totem spawns memorized just from repeated searching. It really is a ‚Äújust cleanse totems‚Äù thing, same as with killer it‚Äôs a ‚Äújust protect gens‚Äù thing. That being said I do think adding a totem counter to small game would be a nice buff and not too intrusive
---
Thanks‚ô•Ô∏è

---
Old news.
---
All I know is, my ass is bringing a flashlight every round now, 500 BP for a blind during chase? Sorry Freddy but you‚Äôre getting blinded at every pallet during this PTB
---
Close the chat window and keep it closed. When you see survivors rapidly crouching, remember that they're bowing to you as a show of respect. Check Steam profiles and don't hesitate to dodge lobbies that look unfair. If 4 people spawn in at once, their profiles show thousands of hours on DBD, and one or more of them has a flashlight, this is a team that a *new* killer never should have been matched with, and getting humiliated by them will only make you feel like trash.
---
I see more people bitching about complaints then people bitching about freddy
---
As backwards as it sounds, if you really want your friends to get better and the killer to enjoy the game then sandbag you friends. I say this because if you're boosting your friends up without proper experience they'll get crushed by a decent killer. So they need to learn how to run. 
---
For the killers sake it gets him the chance to chase you who is likely much better than he is and then he gets the choice to break off for someone else when you start sandbagging.

Yeah this seemed a bit weird to me.  But I'll happily take 1000 bloodpoints for doing a dull totem.  14 seconds well worth it!
---
omg I love it
---
It's actually quite brilliant when you put it that way. Both sides win.
---
bruh how doyou fall asleep when there easy af conditions to remove sleep or reset the timer
---
woah woah woah
---
... why is that not on by default?
---
Accurate
---
In the next patch they‚Äôre changing matchmaking to do more averaging for SWF groups. You will be more closely matching to killers less tailored to your end instead of the far reaching side of your lower rank friends. 
---
In the meantime I‚Äôd suggest just running dumb builds or off meta perks and just goof off too.
---
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs actually 1%, devs won‚Äôt give specific numbers. But McLean did say that the bonus isn‚Äôt worth prestiging for. The problem is that the grind used to be fine but there‚Äôs too many perks now. They‚Äôre actively looking into ways to cut down on the grind, including removing perk tiers
---
Yeah, survivors get much more BP and Killer gets more time. I think its a good tradeoff for both sides.
---
One of the conditions can just be be straight *removed,* one of the conditions get worse each time you use it, and one of the conditions get worse with addons. I can also see some Survivors not even bothering to try to wake up because they'd think it's a waste of time.
---
Nea‚Äôs Mori needs to be buffed.
---
When mori‚Äôing a toxic survivor it prompts the automatic disconnect and uninstall of dead by daylight, and two man are sent to that player‚Äôs house for a frontal lobotomy.
---
The problem with ebony mori is that when I use it in about 60-70% of the games survivors either dc or kill themselves on their first hook. That's actually not fun. Therefore it only finds use if I'm encountering a toxic swf otherwise it's just a game breaker.
---
The dream snares are not very effective during the chase because they have the same slow as the clown's bottles.  
---
While clown can use them during a chase to slow down survivors, freddy cannot and his snares are easily avoidable.  
---
The dream pallets are not included in his base kit wich is stupid from the get go and you can only use them via an addon and it replaces the snares wich is also a stupid idea.
---
Speaking of addons, the black box is just useless because why would you use that if red paintbrush makes everyone asleep? Also the Z block only gives hemmorage effect for 60 seconds only if a survivor steps on the snare, AND THATS A VERY RARE ADDON.
---
Well while you are right that it would be stupid for an artist to fix the code, the problem is that the executives of Behavior prioritize the wrong things. It‚Äôs why DS and Freddy took way too long to fix.
---
The max for Survival (and the other categories) is 8000 pts, not 5000.

---
Laurie. She would liveüòÇ
---
This is more points for survivors for doing things they can do. Plus if survivors are off cleansing totems scattered about, that gives you more time to kill them. This is good on all ends.
---
Yeah i dont think thats a good idea a nurse that can see you at all times? No thanks
---
And they made landing it easier.
---
"Horror". Well yes, but actually no (especially at higher ranks)
---
Ill check when I get home. I haven't looked in a long time.
---
It should be, yes. More pallets should allow you to play around them to get hits in.
---
I completely agree, but it would look kind of weird if I did.
---
That's not actual power on the survivor's side it's just buying time so other players can work on the objective
---
Why highlight this change ? Its reduced but they increased a ton of other stuff like totem cleansing and flashlight blinds
---
For starters there are 4 safe pallets there and t can be reached from anywhere on the map.
---
Increases to bloodpoints gained in like six separate areas? What are you even on?

---
Terrible optimisation and awful file packing, F13 had a similar issue where you'd just be downloading completely new builds of the game instead of just the necessary patch files.
---
I thought they were going to adjust the pallet/loop spawning algorithm, then quickly adjust each maps "budget".
---
My guess is this is an early test of the idea, plus I think they have to design new tiles for the shorter loops.
---
As such, I think the changes will come in batches. For example; all the Macmillan, Coldwind and Autohaven maps will get them in one patch each.
---
53. I only started playing back in June
---
How many times did it download MB it verifys the file then starts downloading again.
---
Why are they downvoting, it‚Äôs like they didn‚Äôt read the patch notes
---
It felt really boring
---
I knew it looked off. I knew it. No way was it ‚Äòbuffed‚Äô or whatever they were making up. Maybe they meant to, but of course it‚Äôs broken.
---
Guys.
---
I think this person likes the doctor
---
I still think that they should bring back the thunder striking sound effect when getting hit by the axe like it used to on launch.
---
That or make a skin for Huntress that's like Thunder from killer instinct and include that as part of it.
---
Man it was scary getting sniped by an axe back then.
---
lol true
---
I fucking hate these devs honestly.
---
=D I troll the killer
---

---
Sorry I didn't wipe my eyes up and down the thread for your girlfriend's mediocre fanart
---
Clown's bottles slow Survivors by 5% and Dream Snares slow Survivors by 15%, IIRC. They're supposed to be used mid-loop to optimize the loop for the Killer and make it harder to use and slip up as a Survivor. 
---
Dream Pallets aren't in his base kit because I feel like a killer with _3 different abilities_ is just too much. It's a little annoying, I'll agree, but I can see the reasoning why. The Dream Pallets addons are easy to get anyway though, so I don't worry much about that.
---
Black Box is good because the obsession **cannot** wake up. Ever. With Red Paintbrush they can still wake up, just not via failed skill checks. Black Box gives you a permanent buff to Dream Projection and makes that Survivor _always_ susceptible to the dream-related penalties (no terror radius, affected by snares, etc). This gets even worse for the Obsession when you pair it with an addon that decreases Dream Projection cooldown or action speed in the dream realm.
---
Also yeah Z-Block sucks. It _super_ sucks. It should be a common or uncommon at most. But whatever, he still has _19 other addons_ to use.
---
It‚Äôs Reddit. 
---
I‚Äôm not worried about ‚Äúvotes‚Äù from nobodies. Lmao. 
---
It‚Äôs the mentality of finding something to complain about no matter what.
---
Damn, majority of these look sooo good.
---
Nea looks like ass tho.  Ew.
---
Except in a single chase u can make two hex totems worth of boldness without a single pallet stun.
---
A bunch of hair customisations were changed at Ghostface‚Äôs release- most of them were severe improvements.
---
&lt;3
---
Cleansing gives points in the boldness category. They reduced survival points, very hard to get before, harder now.
---
It might help not to play at 144p
---
Ace, trapper and hag are def my favorite of these. Hag been needing some good ones for a while
---
Yeah, I know this. I‚Äôm asking if there were any changes in the PTB.
---
God forbid she try to have fun with the shitty, buggy game amirite?
---
I agree. I guess I‚Äôm just disappointed since I was expecting it to look completely different due to how they kept not showing it.
---
Thank god Head On got nerfed, WELL deserved imo absolutely the most broken perk in the game c:
---
My pc is bad. I can't play in higher qualities. But I could something before the update, now it's just a white cloud.
---
Why aren't we PC players receiving Ace, and Feng Min for free?
---
The fuck is with your textures?
---
Don't know if he was thinking of the Tunneling part...
---
*in Monto's voice:* That hag is a potato
---
Freddys power is objectively worse than clowns, the only thing that puts him above is his teleport. How did you come to that conclusion?
---
Because if a Trapper is right on you not swinging he's super obviously trying to herd you in a direction. Into, say, a trap.
---
Low quality. Sometimes it happens after I played a game and I join another one, I don't know why
---
I‚Äôm only a month into the game and I don‚Äôt really see a problem tbh. Lvl 20 isn‚Äôt that hard to get and by then you should have a good amount of perks. 
---
And the way I see it, perks don‚Äôt make or break your experience, most of it comes down to skill. Now of course that isn‚Äôt to say they don‚Äôt help because they definitely do
---
As it should. I‚Äôd rather prefer map by map basis in terms of judging so that way some maps don‚Äôt feel like auto losses for either side.
---
Aw rip I thought you were gonna dead hard the entity for a second...
---
I've got 384 hours but I thought I had way more
---
Not op but, 
---
Dream snares do very little, you have more opportunities to wake.up now, sleep means less, teleportation has god awful cooldown...
---
Old Freddy could mindgame like a god if you learned him. Everyone who's bad at Freddy never shuts up about the seven second transition, when you can actually use it to your advantage in a close encounter/proc it from far away so it does t matter. He also had great stall, which is damn near gone now, and was very unique. New Freddy is an unoriginal, boring combination of the hat and the pig.
---
If only they'd bring back an option to enable old Freddy. A killer has never been deleted like this before.
---
Ooooh good luck finding a killer game! Literally everybody will be queuing as Freddy lol
---
It's not much of a time sink between 4 people. If the team works together it's pretty easy.
---
Damn, that Ace skin looking fine.
---
ITT: No one talking about Freddy lmao
---
Depends on how u define tunnel tbh. If i had a penny for everytime i've been called a tunneler when all i was doing was looking for survivors just to find my previous hook being shit at hiding or standing in the open, id be rich
---
The best of this is that Huntress hatchet starts shaking afterwards
---
Ah, the current PTB?
---
That I‚Äôm not sure about- however, there‚Äôs no mention of cosmetic changes in the current PTB in the patch notes. They mentioned them the previous time, so this would lead me to believe there aren‚Äôt any changes.
---
heal others with a team mate, 2x bp and bonus on top
---
It's almost as if people have different opinions and once things actually change, the less vocal minority will speak up to not lose what they had worked and improved on for almost two years!
---
I‚Äôve heard a 25 say the exact same thing. Salt isn‚Äôt restricted to age it‚Äôs just more common when you are younger. For me I‚Äôm just a salty mess.

Get used to it and quit your bitching. God this sub is going downhill more everyday
---
Because everyone plays against Freddy, Doctor, and Plague every game. They aren‚Äôt the least played killers. No sir.

Bad games where you (or your teamates) get steam rolled, camped, rushed, looped or tunneled make you feel like shit.
---
Good games where a few make it out, you kill most of the survivors or had thrilling chases make you feel kay.
---
But then there are those games, those few games where you go head to head with the killer or with a squad of survivors, those games where you only survived barely, where someone threw away their survival points for you, where you were able to get all the hooks on the survivors, where you barely were able to close the hatch before the last one escaped, where they got you with an unexpected mistake from the killer that allowed you to slip by, when the survivors made a mistake that made them snowball into onblivion just seconds before they completed all gens, where you swaer you almost shit your pants when the killer surprised you off a gen, when you know you jsut made a survivor shit itself when you insta-down them out of seemingly nowhere.
---
THhse few games are like crack and that is why we keep playing.
---
Well done dude! Any post on this reddit about killing a SWF will always get my upvote lmao
---
over 1k

It gives the killer precious time which could be difference between winning and losing (I'm talking red ranks btw)
---

I wanna see this

Because the console version included the DLCs for them, but it was twice the price. 20$ PC and 40$ Console.

Hmm. I got it on Steam in October 2018, and since then I‚Äôve accumulated 431 hours. However , I first started playing in October 2017 on PS4, and did so until I got it on PC- and since there‚Äôs no way to check PS4 hours, I don‚Äôt know my ACTUAL amount.
---
The problem is that I could see before the update. Now it's just a white cloud
---
with level 20 you have nothing at all to compete against stacked survivors. 
---
But you only have a month as you said, give the game 200 hours, rank one on surv and killer, play both, not main one and you will see the problem easily

Yeah I know
---
Oh I believe you on it. Just explained why it was considered a buff, because that is what we were told when they made the change. They sold the change to us as an actual buff, but it really wasn't XD
---
I believe the locals call it a 'brain fart'
---
Even MORE ghostface skins? Yes please
---
Oh really? Huh. That is a little strange then.
---
Freddy is going to fluctuate in power throughout the match, and I'm not sure how that makes me feel.
---
You can't teleport to completed gens, so you get weaker as the game goes on and can't use his teleport in end game.
---
Your power gets stronger the more people are asleep, but only stays at max power until someone gets hooked or dies. You get weaker the more people you kill.
---
Not sure how this will play out in the long run.
---
Lol
---
Oh. I did forget about bloodpoints!!
---
 That's how much I care for them. Bloodpoints don't affect gameplay at all.
---
The good question (for me) is... will we get Adept Bill, Taking One For the Team and Left For Dead achievements along with Bill on consoles? I asked to BHVR and I got no answer. :(

I liked not hearing the Huntress lullaby so loudly when playing as her

Plus they are changing hiding places too, probably to offset the point increase
---
At one point I thought I was dead, then I thought I could get the hatch, then this happened
---
Clown's bottles slow by 15% and his best add-on increases the slow to 20% which is a luxury Freddy doesn't have. As is snares feel totally pointless just makes him an inferior clown. Pallets are nice though.
---
Ooh, gotcha.
---
That's seriously so said. I even said: Ahhhwwwww. When it closed in front of you. I hoped you would dive in üòÇüòÇüëè
---
If you cut that corner tighter you might have made it. :)
---
yeah a common addon that makes the dream snares more useless just to gain extra 200 bloodpoints.  
---
Also its not 5% on the clown, its 15%.   
---
" Intoxicated Survivors will suffer from impaired vision for **4 - 4.5 seconds** , reduced movement speed (**-15¬†%**) and involuntary coughing for **2 seconds** after leaving the Gas Cloud. "  
---
And the intoxication effect can further be increased with addons.
---
Well this game got you literally hooked (pun intended)
---
Even though it was nerfed the difference feels so minimal tbh

4 people working on totems and no one on generators

Apparently they may have changed Kate's p3 hair, but that's just me reading some of the comments on the PTB post.
---
no read the post again I'm asking if we'll get the cosmetics not bill
---
Probably meant that every other time, the surv made it just past the exit so the hatchet bounced off and didn‚Äôt kill them.  This time they threw the hatchet just a few seconds too early
---
That's still 700 more bp
---
I think about that all the time
---
I thought the 'ace skin' was a David skin

##no problem dude
---
My man, stop focusing on his very small handful of bad addons and think about his good ones. Paint thinner, Red Paint Brush, Black Box, Swing Chains, Jump Rope, Prototype Claws, _basically_ everything else besides Kid's Drawing and Z Block.
---
The game seems to auto detect the texture setting, it always looks like my friend is playing minecraft.
---
People play killer more because the BP gains are more plentiful on their end. Look at how clogged queues get during bloodhunts and events. People have been noting the disparity of BP gain on survivor end for what seems like ages and they‚Äôre bringing it in line a little more to make people happy and yet here you are disgruntled because, what, there were t more survivor perk buffs?

Whoever your dealer is, link me in cause whatever you‚Äôre on must be some good stuff.

When you miss the tier 3 skillcheck 5 times in a row
---
I also dont see a problem. I have a little over 500 house and play both killer and survivor, and i believe that skill is a big part in playing. Sure, some perks are necessary, but you definitely need skill to put those into work. Depending on how you play and what killer you are, you can win games with bad perks, if you have ruin
---
Darn, a game might last more than 5 minutes.
---
Not just that they slow down the same, or more with the clown. The clown's effect makes it harder to see, and the effect lasts WAY longer than Freddy's shit snares. Heck, if you try to re-place any snares around the map before a chase, survivors can just trigger them and laugh as they disappear without a real consequence. The same kind of shit I do to hags once I know they are in a chase, pop all their traps and laugh.
---
I understand but this means that the 75% enduring only affecting pallets is bugged. Its at 50% like old enduring but you only recover from pallets instead ds/head on etc..
---
And then there is that game where a bubba face camps you in the basement on your first hook with a fully charged chainsaw.
---
So far from what I've played I have to agree with you. I loved old Freddy and you could tell the people who bitched about the 7 seconds never actually learned him and used him effectively. He had an amazing ability to stall the game and had a lot of mindgame potential. This feels like a rework meant to attract lazy players who didn't wanna give old Freddy a try. I'm not saying old one was perfect or that I won't change my mind about new fred, but for now I don't like it. Especially his new add-ons, most of them are a fucking joke (very rare add-on gives HEMORRHAGE for christ sakes).
---
Clown has 40+ bugs at the moment, guess why. 
---
Even if Clown's power would work properly, Freddy would still be better because of his superior map pressure and better perk sinergy.
---
underused doesn't mean is not overpowered under some conditions

She's more like an angry undead, to be fair. The Crow was obsessed with revenge, and revenge was necessary for him to rest. When Rin is angry about circumstances of her death and kills whatever breathes.
---
A certain streamer I once watched occasionally was running Plunderer's and Ace in the hole, I suggested Pharmacy in chat and people in chat went wild, shitting on the perk, even the streamer who's supposed to be an adult whined about the uselessness of a green medkit when you can selfcare... It was then I realized I should do something else :D
---
Hope these might help people who don't have access to the PTB or are still waiting for it to load!
---
Only 588 hours huh?
---
And he loses that teleport to any gens that are blocked or once all are powered, he can't tp anymore XD So if gates are far apart, having that useful across the map TP, nope, none of that for you! Or if a gen is blocked and you find a survivor that you are chasing towards it, can't TP to cut the survivor off. I know the second one is a niche case, but it does happen and it's a bit of utility his power lacks.
---
Sleepy Boi is back!

I believe they added more bloodpoint scoring events in the survival category though but I'm not sure

---
Clowns bottles also slow by 15%. While I can see how they would be effective they are a bit meh. It takes a good couple seconds to charge the dream snare and when it does you have to place it correctly. If you in a tight loop you might have to fidget with the placement which loses you time. I don't think the snares are that good for pallet loops as much as window loops and choke points and even then they seem to be better at tracking than actually slowing down survs.
---
Kobeing on your own without deliverance is so much more rewarding though, I‚Äôve only ever done it twice and it‚Äôs the best feeling in the world lol even if I die, I‚Äôm just pumped about kobeing
---
People really be complaining about nothing when they buffed a shit ton of other categories that make this gap up/give even more BP.
---
True unless you start chasing one survivor that high rank and the loop you forever. But yeah find the weakest is good.
---
You lose everytging when you prestige. That's why I said I use it as a reset especially for any new unlocked perks
---
i would honestly rather have seagulls than crows
---
I don't think restricting gameplay/hours spent is fun for anyone tbh

No because then you‚Äôre nerfing both sides for literally no reason.

Wait! Are you saying that there might be more than one opinion within the DBD community!? That the people who constantly called him trash aren't actually the same people who complain about the rework!? IMPOSSIBLE! I cannot fathom there being any complexity to this issue :V

---
Thank you for this.
---
I like Freddy rework alot, but his addons could use some work.  
---
For example, block addons are straight up trash now, and they could be something like " slightly/moderatly/considerably reduces the time required for survivors to fall asleep passivly,  
---
They are either hit or miss. But applying hemmorage for 60 seconds on purple addon is just lazy design imo.
---
Self care shouldn't be a 30 it isn't that good you heal way to slow
---
You are a good person. Normally I see SWF groups exploiting the matching system with an early rank lobby host specifically so the advanced players can humiliate less experienced killers.
---
The best way to teach your friends is probably to play the killer in Kill Your Friends, where you can go easy on them, see firsthand what they're doing wrong, and give them real-time feedback over Discord. Maybe consider playing Huntress as an M1 killer; handicapping yourself with slow speed and an increased warning radius should make it less easy for you, so you won't have to go quite as easy on them, which might make the time you spend teaching them a bit more fun for you.
---
But if you're set on teaching them through public matches, my best suggestion would be to just play super stealthy and hang back to minimize interaction with the killer while acting mainly as a coach and coordinator. Honestly, just having that level of coordination &amp; direction from an experienced player will give them such a huge advantage that they should be able to easily win any fair match without you ever performing a single interaction. If they're successfully following your directions without making major mistakes and the killer is still doing well against them, they probably got matched with a more experienced killer than they fairly should be, in which case you might start becoming more involved.
---
i recognize this art style a lot  for some reason
---
Ah well, thx for the answer.
---
YESSS! Chrome Ghost Face!
---
So after using my downed self as bait to hook two others then myself, my friend tried his best but killer as being a dick and hooked my friend few seconds before I died so he got his three chances and freaking Kobe'd. And I got to watch him farm with the killer
---
These animations are bright sheesh, they could make them less noticable.
---
You got me
---
Good bye build i like running! Hello stale meta! Nope to this!
---
Darn, no one might escape if the game last 5 minutes more.
---
Why does the sidebar picture for the Hillbilly say "The Crooked is Enduring?" He's the Hillbilly, and yes one of his perks is enduring but I don't get it. 
---
Also why is there no Pig sidebar? oink oink??
---
&gt; still wouldn't beat things like sprint burst or self care. 
---
By seeing those two perks I see you've been playing a long time ago and you have no idea about the current game
---
I don't approve the use of drugs, sorry :) 
---
More survivor perk buffs??? They did buff D√©j√† Vu and Calm Spirit in 2018 I guess, so maybe that's what you're referring?
---
Literally every patch has brought way more survivor nerfs. Its how it should be. But there also should be some quality of life especially to solo survivors.
---
Officially, no.
---
Technically, currently, yes, but it appears to be a bug exploit, so there's no telling when it may get fixed. If you hold down crouch when pressing run, then let go of crouch while continuing to hold down run, you will not trigger a sprint burst. You can then briefly let go of run and press it again without hitting crouch at all to go into sprint.

---
Its not meant to be a "nerf", its more more a way to give more options. Instead of using a strong perk like self care, you can use 2 or 3 weak ones.
---
Idk why they're stubborn with making perks good. So many perks both killer and survivor need substantial buffs or full on reworks buy instead we get changes like:
---
You can more reliably waste your head on and become exhausted more often.
---
Territorial imperative has a slightly shorter cooldown.
---
Left behind is just 3x more effective, never mind the fact that we somehow made it even MORE useless with the EGC.
---
They should really just overly buff perks and tweak it from there. If the meta perk pool was more than like 7 perks for either side then we wouldn't be running into the same survivor/killer builds all the time.
---
Survivors are blocking the generator aura and it's a bug the devs are trying to fix
---
Yea it was an example. I'd agree with you on that. Maybe like 23.
---
For me i don't get no red light to indicate how close the killer is which just messes me up. Im not sure if this is a bug or if they just haven't implemented it into the game yet
---
Its the opposite. This would create wayyyy more viable builds and viable perks.
---
That‚Äôs not the issue...
---
1. Self care sucks. 
---
2. Why would I want worse options? I want my ruin, I want my BBQ, I want my good perks.
---
I‚Äôve drawn the conclusion that both of you are wrong. Zigor is wrong because performance and a tier list aren‚Äôt even related to a ptb on console. Consoles deserve a ptb because a lot of people are console players. It would be a good idea. This ‚ÄúShadow‚Äù guy is an absolute fruitcake. He just handled it in the worst way possible.
---
So much salt here. There‚Äôs legitimately shitty things you can do but it‚Äôs still a game and meant to be fun. When someone does something nice and the opponent recognizes that why are people mad?
---
Those 2 perks are still being used by plenty of players.
---
How many times is this bug going to be posted before Behavior fixes it?
---
Its huntress's mother
---
You can't have a discussion with the survivor hivemind circlejerk on this sub. Nurse bad, games should be 3 minutes maximum, killer should afk in corner.
---
Nice comment nigga
---
U too
---
Ps4. Exit gate didn‚Äôt trigger cutscene of me escaping and died by entity
---
U three
---
So they're adjusting the perk to work as intended.
---
But even if it doesn't work as intended, you are now exhausted. If they were going to have it work as intended why nerf it in the first place? This is just another dumb unnecessary nerf. It's not buffing it at the same time because they're making it work like it should have months ago.
---
U four
---
Thanks for the post, gonna have to start stockpiling red paint brushes
---
Stop commenting on your on post
---
Not even to mention they decided to give Freddy a channel and an arming delay while clown can just yeet a bottle on your head.
---
Example:
---
Ruins: cost 25
---
BBQ: cost 25
---
Bitter murmur: Cost 9
---
Coulrophobia: Cost 8
---
Hangman's Trick: cost 8
---
So you can still decide to go for your good old BBQ, but some other killer can choose to run 3 weak perks instead of it.
---
If they won't go into struggle it's common decency to let a fellow survivor give it a try, change my mind.
---
These are nice skins but are they also a clue to the next chapter? When a chapter releases they sometimes put out skins matching the new killers theme right?
---
I‚Äôll say this in the simplest way possible since you don‚Äôt understand. 
---
Why would I give up one strong perk, for three shitty perks? I wouldn‚Äôt. Anybody whose playing seriously wouldn‚Äôt either. Chalk the idea. It‚Äôs bad.
---
So, using the constructive criticism in this thread, i attempted to make this look better to about the best of my abilities.
---
[https://imgur.com/S0gv1XO](https://imgur.com/S0gv1XO)
---
As a newer player who bought nearly all of the dlc's I already felt like i could get double points for every match and still have to grind forever to level up... this is dumb.
---
Yo, you asked so I answered. There is no need to be toxic. I just answered your question.
---
There are certain conditions like the lockers in the cabins where a surv can stunt the killer and restart a chase 
---
I've been stunned in those situations by swf a lot of times, even when I wasn't straight in front of the locker but around
---
woo hoo more Jeff cosmetics if any survivor deserves more I'd said it's this man
---
some of them can be much more powerful or just powerful on swf
---
I am not sure where Freddy belongs in tier list, I just said that he has potential to be mid-high tier.
---
I liked that though. The absurdity of that number during that critical time made it fun. Also the singing was better than expected.
---
Damn. I knew there was a good title somewhere but couldn't think of it lol
---
when you can‚Äôt counter a killer so you call them broken..
---
most Jake mains just hide in a corner all game with iron will
---
That Billy is, not that good. LOVE the weapon being a deer leg and that beard looks great. But that shirt, shorts, and freaking sandals (!) just don't look like they fit. Rather hard to see a theme with those cloths outside of "old man at the beach", who happens to have a deer leg and a chainsaw. "Backyard cookout" maybe?
---
Really wish Billy had standard cosmetics with a Head, Body, and Weapon instead of Torso, Pants, and Weapon. Seems to be a real limit to making his looks compared to other Killers.
---
‚ÄúIt was a axe-ident!‚Äù- JonTron
---
Did you report him for the swear? I looove doing that when they try to be toxic
---
I thought they learned with the useless Pig add-ons that "Increased penalty" is a shitty add-on.

On topic:
---
* "Sky Captain" Ace - Looks pretty badass. Finally a skin that doesn't make Ace look like a child molester. 8/10
---
* "Disgusting dress no Claudette main is ever going to wear because they'd rather be stealthy" Claudette - Disgusting dress no Claudette main is ever going to wear because they'd rather be stealthy. Basically just a remake of the dress that came out with the suit for Jeff. The hair looks okay at least. 2/10
---
* "Another long distance runner skin" Meg - Another long distance runner skin for Meg. The hair looks okay and I like the Bluetooth thing in her ear along with the single braid and cornrows but the skin itself is boring. 3/10
---
* Hippie Nea - Lord only knows this is going to be the new Pizza Dwight: just a bunch of Hippie Neas huddled around a barrel fire. Jokes aside it looks nice and (excluding the shirt) we finally have a skin that isn't bright Neon bullshit for Nea. Probably the only pair of ripped pants I actually think look good. 7/10
---
* "Punk Rocker" Kate - Daaaaaamn girl you lookin' fiiiiine! I might actually have to play Kate now! 10/10
---
* JANE ROMERO *JANE ROMERO* **JANE ROMERO [JANE ROMERO](/intensifies)** - 9999999999999/10 because it's Jane Romero. Jokes aside I like the Summer Dress look but I think it has the problem that all of Jane's cosmetics have of only looking good when paired with themselves. (Especially the body cosmetic which I don't think you can make look good outside of equipping them with the ripped jeans.) That being said I like the look of the pants they look cozy and can fit her dress cosmetics well. Still a 9999999999999/10 because it's Jane &gt;!but if I have to be honest it's about an 8.!&lt;
---
* Casual(?) Jeff - It's uhhh... the jacket is nice? I know this skin is going to be Purple and cost $10 but I feel like this should be priced at a Yellow. (Like $3.) It's just really ugly imo, especially his beard. 1/10
---
* Summer Billy - Finally a skin for a more casual Billy! I really like more comedic/casual skins, and Billy really needed a more simple skin as opposed to all his cosmetics that add disgusting beards which don't fit his model. 9/10
---
* "Islander?" Trapper - Really weird. Doesn't fit my taste. Props for a unique style though. 4/10
---
* Nintendo Switch Trapper - So this confirms my theory that the Nintendo Switch Exclusive skin will be available on PC too, akin to what they did with Joy in the Switch version of Payday 2. As for the skin itself the mask is the only good part, and it looks meh overall. 3/10
---
* "Girl Scout?" Nurse - *Very* funky cosmetic. Like that we finally have a Nurse cosmetic that isn't a fancy dress. 6/10
---
* "Shaman" Hag - Woah this is funky! I like this skin a lot because unlike Hag's other skins it doesn't change her model too dramatically but it's still asthetically unique. Solid 10/10!
---
* "Shaman" Plague - *Woaaaaaaaah!* The hat and weapon look great! The body not so much tbh. Really love the style though and tbh if you wear the weapon and the mask with Plague's default body (or her P2 body, or some of her recolors) this could look really nice! 9/10
---
* [Chrome Claw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rhc0QaipX8) Ghostface - Great to see that Toastface is getting more cosmetics, and this one is really badass! Love the Chrome mask, love the more grungy body, even the knife looks great! 10/10!

I mean the rest of the BP gains were buffed but the "Survival" category is a joke alltogether. You literally only get points when you run out of the gates or when you face a certain killer and stop their power (like cleansing vs Plague or waking yourself up vs Freddy)...and even that only gives like 100 points ffs
---
Yea, once I even managed to actually stun the killer, clearly OP.
---
Eh, as far as the totems, maybe. I guess anyone who was gonna focus on finding Ruin was already going to regardless of the points, and if they waste time on dull totems, that is definitely in the killer's favor.
---
But toxic SWF squads with dedicated flashlight trolls are already the most obnoxious part of this game, so encouraging that is going to make playing killer even less fun that it already is. I know they're nerfing infinite loops, which is good for killers, but flashlight trolls actually bother me worse than infinite loop abusers. Survivors are supposed to be the hunted, not the hunters; at least loopers are staying within the spirit of the game. I can just go after someone else and catch them when they're not hiding in an exploit zone. But when you have a skilled looper with good aim following the killer around with a flashlight, you literally can't even play the game.
---
Oh well, maybe you're right. I have to keep reminding myself that, as much as the community likes to whine and the devs try to kowtow, this game doesn't really seem to have problems with balance at all. It has problems with matching. I've only played about 250 hours. Flashlights wielded by players at my experience level are not generally that big a deal. The real problem is getting matched with SWF commando squads who each have 3000 hours under their belts. And those matches will be bullshit whether they have a flashlight or not.

Its the worst exhaustion perk in the game no matter how you put it. If you honestly have a speck in you're mind that thinks Head on is a good perk then i feel sorry for you
---
Yeah
---
You saying he shouldn‚Äôt face camp is the exact reason your said he should waste every pallet I let‚Äôs everyone else have plenty of time to win
---
Pretty cool. Would like to see what it looks like when survivors interact with the last two!
---
Someone just stole my meme from my ig dbd meme acc and they put it on their reddit before me LMAO..
---
Noed means nothing it‚Äôs easily counterable
---
Oh, wasn‚Äôt saying everybody does. But I see a lot of toxic builds, playing against killers. They taunt, run overpowered shit and Mori‚Äôs and you don‚Äôt expect people to be mad? That‚Äôs my problem with it.
---
That's the whole point of the perk? You are supposed to be stunned. As for the zone, they said they were fixing the zone so it would be more consistent. You haven't answered why the nerf should be in place considering the requirements and risk of use nor why it is op.
---
Furthermore, if survivors are wasting time in lockers waiting to stun you, then they aren't on gens.
---
Devs shouldn't nerf shit until they nerf nurse. None compares to her.
---
I‚Äôm definitely getting that Kate skin but why is Legend Feng left in the dark yet again?

dude, learn to read, instead of reading what you want to
---
Is this the stylizing thing they were talking about? It... doesn't look that much more interesting visually.
---
Mhm. On one hand people from the art team don't do coding, but on the other hand upper management are the people who choose to hire artists over coders.
---
I agree, even before EGC, Left behind has been the most obsolete perk. Playing off of your idea, here's my rework suggestion.
---
Left behind:
---
*When in the downed state, if a survivor is not within a 15m radius, crawl and recover speed is increased by 20%.* (Don't take the numbers seriously since it's a rough draft idea)
---
This way, there's more cohesion with his own perks, especially unbreakable. Just like unbreakable though, if the killer doesn't sandbag even a little, the build is pointless.
---
Yep I did and I love it especially when it‚Äôs clearly a kid
---
Thank yoy
---
4000 after the PTB patch goes live T\_T.
---
The thing is, he only face camped my friend because he got run around the whole game, my friend wouldnt of ran him around for so long if he threw down every pallet recklessly. He only facecamped because he was upset.
---
Yikes.
---
what about double windows jungle?
---
Looks like a lot of summer themed skins which makes sense since we're in summer but you guys think they'll be part of an event and we can have a chance to unlock some before they're all cells only?

They did that?! Why?
---
I don't really know what devs, etc. do when they receive a report, but I really think you're fine. DBD is a wild game. I've got great ping and internet speeds, and yet sometimes I'll be the only one kicked from a game and luckily if I'm SWF I have them say that so I don't get a bajillion reports at the end for DC'ing.
---
I can kinda agree, I haven't really played recently. But your post is not very clear on what it is trying to convey.
---
You don't understand the idea at all =/ When you go to a super market and the candies cost only 5 pennies, are you going to say "Forcing people to buy candies make me want to stop going to the groceries store!!!!"
---
Dis you shut down your computer without closing the game ?
---
I can't help but god same, I go full potato against him. Hate that fucker
---
DS and freddy took way too long to fix because bHVR were coming up with a new killer, a new map and a new survivor every 3 months while also fixing bugs and balancing other stuff.
---
Ok Mr/Ms game journalist
---
?
---
I love it
---
Lmao that‚Äôs how I feel too 2 years went fast
---
Well billy isnt just in the last image, he's also in the first image as well, in the bottom right corner
---
This concept is so good. I only don't like the part where he's able to vault pallets, it's too much like legion. Otherwise, the perks and ability are pretty solid ideas! I assume the ability could be used midchase, and that alone leads to some really good mindgames and shenanigans!
---
A minor addition to his kit that I'd think would be amazing. (This is with the idea he has no terror radius in a locker) If a survivor is unlucky enough to open a locker F.Dwight is in, F. Dwight grabs them by the scruff of their neck, and puts them on his shoulder.
---
ik this will sound weird but he's just a M1 killer, yeah, i agree his power is quite difficult to deal with since he's an anti-looper killer but think that he lacks mobility and his power cannot help him at all to put enough pressure so try to make a lot of space between you 2 in a chase, allowing your team to do gens. Calm Spirit is also a good counter but i don't recommend this perk since it's complete horse shit and you die faster on the hook
---
I thought that was it, but after checking, I am not playing PTB :(
---
They‚Äôre called TL walls. 
---
If the killer plays bad, you get three free fast vaults on each window. 
---
If he runs the tile correctly, you either run away and try to find a pallet or take a hit and then find a pallet.
---
ARE THOOSE SEA RELATED SKINS?

They buffed a lot more perks than those two in that patch... Recently they also closed the gaps in the jungle gym area of the farm maps which blocks more killer los. Locker blocking aura reading was another survivor buff. We won't talk about how mom ruled the meta for the couple of months. It's like you have a selective memory...
---
It is possible, It was around a week ago but I do recall equiping the blooded knife at least first
---
How are we supposed to know what you'd like, you can browse everything in the shop yourself to see everything.
---
But I guess to answer you're post my favorites are: Blighted + open brain doc, toxic nurse, miner trapper, blighted wraith, bear head huntress, Joey legion, the fancy outfit spirit launched. Then summer camp Dwight (yellow t shirt with hat and shorts), the lunar new year ace david and feng, and sam axe shirt for ~~Bruce~~ ash.
---
Red lol. She is the Queen of 3k 4k Dark pips. Her Moris from helmet pops LOSE you hooks and hits which fucks your chaser/malicious/devout emblems. I only play M1 killers too btw, you'll never see me touch Nurse, Spirit, Hillbilly or Huntress. Amanda is by far the worst killer to play in red ranks. Her stealth ability is garbage, you barely use it at all it only slows you down.
---
What's the point of a perk if you're not going to use it?
---
That has absolutely nothing to do with the cosmetics. Different team entirely
---
I think they'll be free too , they were free on PC why wouldn't they be on consoles
---
Survival time in the trial gives you survivors points and wiggling(even if you dont manage to escape) gives you survival points. You could also just struggle on 2nd stage to get around 800-900 survival points, but that's not really in your control wether your teammates farm you or not, but nevertheless, theres still other ways to et survival after the mid chapter patch rolls in.
---
Oh my bad then. I don't really play the PC version so I didn't realize they were free cosmetics.
---
the thing is that all that is done because the survivors did something that makes you have to make a choice
---
&gt;who to chase
---
you cant choose that unless there are 2 or more so it doesnt always happen
---
&gt;The killer powers add eve more nuance. Trapper and Hag traps. Do I rev the chainsaw to predict or wall off the vault. Do I stalk or hit. Would stealth work here. 
---
im talking about basic killer gameplay, cuz if you play nurse you assume the proactive role
---
yeah, it's just the way the buildings are arranged, like the school can now be right next to the killer shack or the houses are on different parts of the map
---
# MY PP HARD
---
Dude this perk blows 90% of the time.  Wtf would they nerf it?   Deez dudes are doo doo.
---
Also, what if I'm not trying to stun the killer, but instead he is looking away and I want to use my "dance with me + qq"? I have to become exhausted to use those too...?
---
Couldn't they just fix the perk first so that it actually stuns the killer? Like 90% of the times it doesn't even work and I have 4s awkward stare with the killer until he slaps my ass.
---
:(
---
Should I perform a Mori?
---
... really. The problem with ruin is that it is boring and frustrating for survivors? Nah man the problem isnt even ruin. The problem is that survivors only have 1 objective and get to set the pace of the game because of it. When they can just focus down gen after gen after gen the killer is forced to stop that. The strongest way is ruin. Honestly it has nothing to do with pressure either. Ruin helps keep the rest of the team from getting every gen done while the killer ramps up his pressure. That first chase needs to end early and he needs to get onto the next one immediately or the game is not gonna go well at all. If you get run around for any decent amount of time and the survivors are intelligent you can lose 2 or 3 gens from the first chase alone. I play survivor and killer and I've had that happen on both sides. 1 hook 3 gens. Game is more than halfway over for us survivors and the game barely begun for the killer. How is that for frustrating? Why do you think killers DC when ruin is gone immediately or those 3 gens pop 80 seconds into the game?
---
We won‚Äôt know for about 7 hours!
---
Same, and now I play a few matches per day MAX. Its just not the same anymore lol
---
We trendin now boy
---
Shut down pc without closing the game is same as closing any software without saving.. you Can call the support theyll give you some bloodpoints..(only one time per account)
---
It's light blue background with white text. Colorblind people exist, I am one of them.
---
Alright thanks
---
They're adding survival points for time alive in the trial, for trying to wiggle out even if you dont manage to escape. I think in the end, if you manage to escape, you'll get more than 5000 points.
---
Reduced BP for escaping? Completely unwarranted Head On nerf? No new additional scoring events for Survival?
---
Why BHVR.
---
And more points for totem cleansing isn‚Äôt the magic solution. It simply wastes far too much time to cleanse especially if you‚Äôre solo. That is why it will never be the secondary objective BHVR wants it to be.
---
yoooo that plague skin though
---
Really nice post.
---
I think so. I'm not sure if "all conditions are met" needs the killer to be within range or not. If it's not a condition that needs to be met, this nerf is even more stupid.
---
It will always have these few survivors that seek the challenge of playing survivor
---
[Peanits on official forum](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/570067/#Comment_570067): ‚ÄûQuick note: The exhaustion change might not actually be in this build after all. This was originally a side effect of the new way it worked; since it creates a lingering effect, it would activate regardless of if the killer was in the area or not (since the killer could be outside the area and then walk into it). This is removed in a later build. It seems like that change made it into the PTB version, so there's actually no exhaustion if it doesn't stun after all.‚Äú
---
In theory, yes. In practice... not really. It just looks like they added more pallets.
---
It's iridescent hatchet.
---
Just as freddy is about to hit the ground
---
*cut to a slim man in a bright-green bodysuit*
---
Wanna munch ?
---
Making the walls on farm maps not see through was actually a killer buff though... 
---
The survivor buffs aren't anywhere near the amount of survivor nerfs we've had during last 1,5 years. And why would be talk about what mom was? Its deservedly so nerfed to ground and the topic is this current patch anyways. You can list those rare survivor buffs from the last half year but the reality they are nowhere near the killer buffs.
---
That Kate one is *so* sick
---
I think this is the GREATEST Anime Betrayal
---
Don't know about survivors but as killer I think Legion has some of the best cosmetics in the game, the black Frank outfit in particular is really good imo and the Susie outfits too. Other than that I really like a lot of Wraith's cosmetics.
---
It feels like BHVR is hesitant to give Feng new skins because of a possible "What is this, where's Bunny Feng, it's been years, why is it so difficult to make a frigging hoodie work, why even bother giving her outfits that are not Bunny Feng" backlash. 
---
Also, in an older Dev Stream, they said they're looking at stats and that they try to give more popular characters more outfits but let's be honest... some people don't play Feng because of the LACK of unique cosmetics, not because they don't like her in general. If Meg, Claudette and Nea receive new shiny cosmetics frequently, of course I'm going to play them instead of Feng. Not giving Feng more cosmetics is not helping, it's making the problem worse.
---
What else do you whiny children need? It's Freddy rework and you're mad it's not all about survivors. Pure entitlement.
---
Yeah, ill miss the OG addon. :(
---
so when's the PTB going to be available? I don't see it in the post
---

"A pirate's life for me."
---
Then like I said, spinechill will tell you if she's coming to you or not. That'll give you enough time to walk away and hide somewhere nearby.
---
Few of them remind me of a Caribbean/Pirates theme. I would love for them to shift to a pirate killer with this. But that's just wishful thinking
---
Alright bullshit, Freddy wasn't overpowered in any sense, yeah. His great point was tracking, it was what he was great at.
---
 His play style of switching between survivors and catching them out revolved around that. He was different, and unique. He had to be played a lot differently or you'd get shit on. Just the same to play against.
---
 "NURSE LEVELS OF OVERPOWERED" is such a stupid statement it goes beyond me of how you could believe that. He wasn't worse than LF either. He was a fine and balanced character, at worst a bit weak even if you did play him right.
---
 
---
With the rework it takes away all the uniqueness, changes his playstyle to the point that he simply isn't the same killer AT ALL anymore, and he's now just a Frankenstein kit of a lot of other different killers.
---
 He wasn't just good at one thing either, if that was the case you were playing him wrong. His point was to stall the game and slow it down for himself, bringing multiple people in dream at once was the go to. Chasing he wasn't good at, yeah but he wasn't supposed to fucking chase, at least not for long. 
---
 The 7 second timer was fine, and while sure if it was say after the gates were opened it could fuck him, otherwise it worked more to his benefit anyways.
---
wtf, i dont  like him, but i dont trust you if there is no evidence
---
I understand they buffed other things but still, with the way the economy works in this game there was no reason for this at all.
---
This community: 2 hours later and not a single comment about long demanded major Freddy rework. 200 comments about Head On.
---
Ahhh fuck all that trouble just for that, good try lol
---
WTF is that billy outfit? He always gets funny and derpy cosmetics, nothing really scary.
---
Also, lots of cosmetics have the same sea/jungle style. Curious if that has something to do with the next chapter? Or a summer event?
---
Post pictures of conversation to expose him otherwise without proof I can‚Äôt believe you due to playing devils advocate and not being a dumbass. If you can provide proof you have my full support on taking him down. Until then I‚Äôm gonna have to not condemn him by any means or tell anyone to not support him or his content.

Wraith came from Africa looking for a better life, his addons come from african culture and religion. Phillip (the wraith) didn‚Äôt come willingly to the entities realm so he had to be tortured to become a killer. Once he was finished the entity granted him the bell as a gift for becoming a killer
---
Wait how did Quentin die too?
---
You shouldn't balance competitive games after low ranks. As soon as the low ranks get better, it will be unbalanced again.
---
And here we have another patch without any SMALL buff to the weak killers/survivor perks. In other games all the patches have a list of small buff and nerfs, but this company doesnt give a fuck
---
lol It's just that the same people that complain about NOED being OP/crutch complain about how meaningless it is to take easy steps to prevent it. Wouldn't surprise me if many of them are also primarily SWF players - probably the biggest crutch "perk" of them all.

you cant just accuse people with zero evidence, i dont care what the person said in there thread, you need evidence, otherwise its all just empty words.

Honestly matchmaking just bones you sometimes and when it does you just gotta roll with it unless you‚Äôre playing even more tryhard than those guys. Or just say screw the whole game and just wander around not doing anything and just go next.
---
Why is this a bad thing? I'm 50/50 and rarely play NOED, but I don't understand this constant whining about NOED. I rarely see it come into play anyway, and when it does I'm more angry at survivors who run around doing nothing the whole game than I am at the killer who played a perk that we fell for.
---
Ruins is a badly designed perk, which happens to be pretty necessary for balance of the game since killers needs it.

Because its horror themed is a pretty popular game to stream, since a lot of people are looking forward on how to survive their own games and get better, as well as "just watch" but never try or buy the game for themselves because it seems too scary/tense for them.
---
Kate became Nea
---
yea
---
I'm so confused I was up against Billy boi and he hooked me first time and I went straight to struggle...this isn't normal right?
---
Not knowing what Gen Freddy is teleporting to makes it really strong. I think you should still be able to cancel the teleport tho.
---
Saved.
---
The way imagine it, they would crawl out of the exit suuuper fast. Sadly the animation wouldn't speed up, but it should still look hilarious
---
They even made Z block the most interesting add on ever. Bleeding while uninjured is the most coolest add on I've seen and i hope it gets slapped on to other killers kits. Not op but Its a cool niche and combine it with bloodhound it'll be more useful for tracking.
---
Yay. Though I'll probably rock the TSP most of the time once it comes out, Leather Pig should be much harder to spot, esp. crouched.
---
Y‚Äôknow chewing ice isn‚Äôt good for your teeth and is sometimes a sign of anemia. Might wanna go to a doctor, I hear Herman has some openings.
---
Never said you had to play her. Play billy.
---
Accurate.
---
Those all cane out a long time ago. Survivors get nothing new to improve the gameplay. No useful perks come out anymore, killers still get more BP, and survivors don‚Äôt get any new mechanics to use.
---
The 3 second delay happens when you fail a skill check in general
---
How long ago was that?
---
Maybe BHVR wanted to experiment what it would be like, so it's in the PTB where bloodpoints (and everything else) don't matter. So if it does truly break the game, now they'll know.
---
He's Soul would be Forgiven in Reddit.
---
How do i loop as a survivor, i‚Äôm a survivor main and i try to loop and juke the killer but they always seem to know my every move
---
I love this so much
---
Can you make the skin public? I'd like to use that ngl
---
Bloodhound meta hours (?)
---
‚ÄúCondragulations you are this leaks winner‚Äù
---
Pallet stuns are definitely not just a push of a button
---
I play her at red ranks, daily. She's good if you are. I do think there are some needed tweaks to put her in a better spot. I will say, that I couldn't imagine playing her without Spirit Fury/Enduring. That goes with most M1 killers though.
---
Wtf is that though?
---
I agree although I think it would be cool if Freddy had voice lines like Ash does.
---
That‚Äôs amazing
---
Feng mains are all the same. Every one I see they‚Äôre just like ‚ÄúWe want more Feng cosmetics‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Lunar Cosmetic doesnt count‚Äù. What about the rest of the characters who have been in the game longer and have limited cosmetics?
---
She deserves it.
---
fffffuuuuuuuuuuu lol
---
LOL you really think i downvoted you because you called a meme I created in 30 seconds bad? Ok buddy, sure
---
Yeah too bad it‚Äôs bugged right now.
---
We were already hyped back during the livestream.
---
Why does it matter?
---
I don‚Äôt like the hat but the coat for ace is sick!
---
He's about to have a golden experience with the killer.
---
If it's chapter based (doubt it is) maybe be seeing like a killer from the ww2 era 
---
Though if I had to guess, these may be to sorta tie into bill's look as he's coming to console in the mid chapter
---
Devs have proven to overestimate the power of status effects (other than broken and exposed). Just look at the huntress addons
---
I think you‚Äôre my new friend.
---
I've Just bought demon face... And that perfection is Just about to come out... But im fuckin' broke
---
Yes let‚Äôs nerf Head On it‚Äôs such a strong survivor perk pepega
---
I'll always keep Bunny Min in my heart but for BVHR to release any new cosmetics for her brightens my day. I agree lack of cosmetics for her will drive people away and we'll have to wait months for just one new set.
---
Now we just need scarecrow and jokeface and my life will be complete (in a very minor way)
---
Even though Jane doesn‚Äôt have much right now her cosmetics are very colorful and diverse imo
---
This is epic on so many levels
---
I don‚Äôt see what was wrong with the original
---
If you‚Äôre having issues playing AS doctor then you‚Äôre Xbox is old or damaged. Killer has no ping since they‚Äôre host, meaning it‚Äôs a hardware issue for you. It‚Äôs also not normal for doc to lag out the host, I can play him just fine
---
Yall know that book series the "Unwind" dystology?
---
Ya know the mercenary cop who gives the guy with the broken leg a ten second head start,then shoots him at the count of 3? Yea,you're that guy.
---
Was the predator rumors confirmed fake? because that is what they could be bringing together.
---
What?
---
is the black incense add on for plague good?
---
Oh wow I did not even know to look for that in the first place.
---
Tbh it was such a stupid perk in alot of situations.  The killer had to be in front of you when you start the animation  so it can create alot of situations where you should have hit the killer, for instance if the killer walk right into the locker , but because the perk only counts the stun during activation and not during the animation is felt consistent.  Now the killer will get stunned at any point during the animation , so if he walks to you and you jump out, and he walks into the stun zone , it will stun.  Instead of creating a moment where it should have but didn't.   It should also make it so the killer cant sidestep you and grab you from locker,  as your whole leaving the locker animation will stun.
---
Close, but [no cigar ](https://youtu.be/OChjVLHlkVE)
---
How is tbagging toxic?
---
Basically event based legacy like skins
---
Ohhh, sorry but im talking about freddy pre-rework
---
Thank you for not being one-track minded.
---
More Nea, Claudette and Meg skins...yay...
---
I think old Freddy with add-ons was stronger than this reworked Freddy (also with add-ons)...
---
I think it's the model of when a survivor is being sacrificed
---
Wraith buff when?
---
Me too, but a just spend bloodpoints in survivors. Dont know how im rank 10 killer with all of them being, like level 5 or 10
---
Streetwise is the 4th book

Freddy is a coin toss right now, I‚Äôm looking forward to the ptb. And I‚Äôm not really more informed on everything, just Freddy stuff. Check the flair
---
Love u
---
These are so so great! Could I have one, if they're still available?üòç I believe I sent you a message too.
---
Ohh, you‚Äôre talking about his rework. What I‚Äôm trying to say is that he isn‚Äôt fine in his current state (pre-rework)
---
Maybe they follow the idea that he take his cloth off the people he kill.
---
Do you mean skins that look like the legacy skins?
---
I don‚Äôt think they should do that. From what I heard it was a real grind to get them. And to have copies of them would take away from that.
---
I hope they add a "How's this for a wet dream" line to the snare, that happens maybe every 100 snares or so.
---
With an M1 Killer though? If you're not someone like Ghostface it's pretty unlikely they're going to catch someone out early, and even then they can still slam the gens because the M1 Killer can't get across the map quick enough.
---
If you say enough bullshit you're bound to say something at least remotely brilliant.
---
Yo devs, I'm gonna need that chrome ghostface mask added to the game immediately.
---
Plz and thank.
---
I love you,bro.
---
Different kind of listening my human
---
Basically with ghost face the bought the mask rights, and a bunch of costume rights
---
More or less BHVR can make any cosmetics they want for Spookyface
---
However with the others, they have to basically keep the killer looking movie perfect or they get sued
---
SCP 106 HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT ACTIVATE THE FEMUR BREAKER NOW!
---
Just like you should do to yourself in this sub
---
Unbreakable would‚Äôve been nice too
---
Not the only one.
---
The hatch thing is really good but the exit gate opening is basically "Wake Up"
---
And your point is...? Is the killer not allowed to camp to get one kill? I‚Äôm guessing you wouldn‚Äôt be the slightest bit upset if you got ran the whole game
---
No. All his perks were available from the start to all survivors.
---
Times I‚Äôve won by using bad/toxic techniques: 0
---
Times I‚Äôve been accused of tunneling for chasing a survivor: 17
---
Times I‚Äôve been accused of facecamping because I hooked a survivor and stayed on the map: hella
---
&gt; the sub is overwhelmingly survivor mains
---
I'm gonna have to disagree with you on that one, friend.
---
Franklin's is so much better than lightborn. it counters ALL items and forces survivors to waste time going back to find their item if they wanna keep it
---
I noticed that but was surprised about the amount of following this sub has. That's why my mentality is "new game mode, brings back old fans for big changes" if it goes well!
---
It may not be tunneling but it is definitely not smart... (borrowed time, decisive strike)
---
NP I had to share this moment
---
Oof can't argue with that, just was thinking "new game mode - more players - less playtime - better portrayal of what bugs are happening the most and where to patch things".
---
Mettle of nah and left behind.
---
Yeah, that's what they always do.
---
Is the first person David ?
---
How could you?! &gt;:v
---
Thank you so much! OW and DBD are my fav video games‚ô•Ô∏è
---
It gives you easy free first hits in chases tho so you should love it. Just chase the unhooker. And for the flashlights... that‚Äôs great too. At least they‚Äôre trying to get flashlight saves instead of doing gens
---
Oops my bad. In this case I agree.
---
when doctor thinks using unnerving presence, ruin and overcharge will actually make doing gens difficult
---
943 hours since launch in June 2016.  Looking at other newer players' numbers me feel like a fucking casual lol. 
---
I guess I tend to binge on the game for a few days or weeks, then drift away again when something else launches or updates.
---
Im excited to try out his new abilities especially because i feel like it represents Freddy a lot better. I do agree that just buffing him would be a great way of helping make Freddy more viable instead of hoping that his new abilities work well.
---
Predator won't be happening, since a Predator game is coming out soon.
---
One small step for man, one giant leap fo- well shit
---
&gt;that's because they decided to work on that particular generator and thus it was reactive on my part that they were downed in that spot
---
yeah. If you want it that way then survivors when they all are at peace and healthy are proactive, but when someone gets downed then they become reactive, that should do it i guess
---
I thought i read somewhere the trapper skin as a switch exclusive. I could be wrong dont @ me
---
Because that's the survivor I'm gonna P3 next
---
Not in a general sense but there are times when it is the right play.
---
I'm confused about what happens with Dream Pallet and Dream Snare...SOS
---
Its fine! You made some good points about the rework as well
---
Thanks.
---
focus more on creating distance than looping. he shuts down loops hard but with a good amount of distance there isnt much he can do
---
How do I get this skin
---
It's an addon because it's much stronger than snares. It's usually a free hit, while snares can still be countered.
---
I knew if I stayed the killer would down me so I had to let him get the hook, I wanted to blind him man
---
Where's this comment with download lol
---
Not this update obviously
---
I smell a Summer Event!
---
For real! No one left behind
---
You are still getting value out of the effect, you get more distance even if you don't make a killer miss a hit. You get SOMETHING for using it.
---
When you miss head on, nothing happens. No value at all.
---
Nice another cool Claudette skin which everybody is gonna ignore in favour of their default ninja one.
---
It‚Äôll never be the real legacy, if any thing recolor of it, it‚Äôs more like a prestige 4 skin, legacy players will always distinguish themselves, mainly because legacy will remain on pc, and the new ones won‚Äôt come to PC. 
---
I don‚Äôt wish to devalue legacy, I wish to implement some type of newer model for consoles, much like a collectors edition of a game, it‚Äôs sought after but it‚Äôs still the same thing but with more. (Legacy = Collectors)
---
That's what I'd like to know lol
---
It‚Äôs an ultra rare it‚Äôs supposed to be strong
---
Nelson right? Lmao
---
AHHH. i‚Äôm always happy to see otz getting posted here. i used the build on my wraith and it is so fucking good. love otz so much, his 24 hour stream was amazing.
---
I use franklin‚Äôs on every killer I can. Not having to deal with self-insta heals and pallet flashes is a blessing. I hit a Laurie through a pallet and watched her stand still on the other side, with her flashlight at my feet.
---
They cant buff Freddy. If they did he would be a Nightmare to balance for low ranks. That was the problem .
---
I used to think Billy is better but now I can absolutely say spirit is better. A good team can destroy Billy because he can be looped just like any killer. You can't loop or counter spirit unless you are running iron will
---
Thank you! I love the Doctor too, he‚Äôs just perfect &lt;3
---
Thank you üòÑ
---
Bruh that isn't very accurate. Survivors do want something to do besides gens, but totems is not a solution. It isn't very fun to just sit there and hold M1 on a generator, why would it be any more fun to waste your time and lower your chance of escape to look for totems? Most of the time killer doesn't have noed, so you actively cripple yourself trying to cleanse all the totems, and in solo games unless you cleanse/see all 5 there is no way to know if all the totems got done. 
---
Devs have not tried very hard to implement an alternative objective, they did it for one of the events (Halloween?) and the survivor escape rate plummeted drastically (though that was also do to cosmetics, poor idea by BHVR).
---
Yeah, and that‚Äôs why I suggested that
---
Eh, add ons that cause the action speed to be slower, sleep traps and fake pallets will make dreaming meaningful.
---
Alright, I guess I‚Äôm really lucky
---
&gt;by pushing them towards emptier spots.
---
thats difficult, but you could do that
---
So Head On doesnt count? It gives a whole new mechanic for lockers, Breakdown is a really good perk for Sabo, Distortion completely counters BBQ, Mettle of Man gives you a free hit if you are the altruistic sort. Killers get more BP because they do more things throughout the game. Did you not read the patch notes for mid chapter? Theyre buffing the hell out of survivor BPs
---
You're just grasping at straws here. Bye
---
It's hard to go wrong with 4 meta perks.
---
&gt;Save
---
Many thanks
---
Huntress addons are certainly a mixed bag, but there are some good status effects in there like the brown addon that causes exhaustion for 30 seconds which shuts down most of the exhaust perks for survivor. Or the hindered debuff to make survivors run away slower.
---
Mh, that's terrible.
---
That was the whole point of Hex: Ruin, and we see how that's served us.
---
Do you need me to call an ambulance?
---
Wow pro scientists move
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Use David or Meg. David has We're going to live forever which gives you more bloodpoints and dead hard which helps you escape death
---
Meg has sprint burst which can easily get you out of a bad situation and put distance between you and the killer, adrenaline is amazing for clutch plays
---
Ignoring all other survivors to focus on one of them until they are dead.
---
Are you a Nea main or are you just trying to get urban evasion
---
Well, when I do turn around to skedaddle out of there you can see the Billy's aura in the distance because of my alert
---
Alright
---
Mh, maybe you're right :/
---
Queue times might be shorter if survivor blood poins were buffed to the same level as killers', incentivizing people to play survivor.
---
Pig has RBTs that delay gens, Wraith has movement speed addons. Against a good team, or two people on one gen with Prove Thyself, gens don't stand a chance.
---
Is there really no way to tell between hex totems? I thought if one had black smoke at the bottom it was Haunted grounds but I've been wrong before
---
But why this happen so often to dbd, but I never saw that much happen with other games?
---
Im rank 8 rn, and survivors are already making me want to kms. Hopefully I get stuck here so it doesn't get any worse
---
I would love to see that endgame chat
---
Alright, I'll try!
---
claudette looks great, nea is... her beautiful self, gothy kate is best girl, jane looks amazing, nurse looks interesting, hag is kind of a mess, plague looks interesting,
---
Updoot for tyler alone
---
Head on never works, breakdown doesn‚Äôt give enough for a perk slot, lockers are a better bbq counter, have fun trying to make protection hits work for mettle, and killers getting  more bp is how long queue times are made. And most of the actions they are buffing either don‚Äôt happen frequently, aren‚Äôt done at all, or the gain is too small to matter much. Also survival BP is still a joke.
---
Yes omg I put off playing killer for so long cause I've had such deep anxieties about it
---
In the PTB I have seen people using Head On and it also seems to hit a lot more often than it used to. It seems as long as Head On is primed its pretty much impossible for the killer to get them out of a locker unless the survivor just doesn't hit the button at all. 
---
IF this proves out to be the new rule for Head On, being almost impossible to stop once it's primed and hitting pretty regularly, then the nerf won't really hurt the perk.   
---
It's a pretty big IF, but could happen.
---
I love the Meg skin tho
---
If you need to just kill them, just use stalk increasers and tombstone piece, just watch out to avoid running out of stalk juice. that way it's easier. you can also bring a mori (even a yellow one works here), rancor and maybe even devour hope.
---
Head on nerf lol. Smh my head
---
You receive a one week stay at an all-gay getaway at ormond resort for two
---
he was buffed at the ptb and then nerfed 1 week later
---
THE JEFF SKIN IS LITERALLY EVERYTHING I WANTED
---
Yikes
---
...then how does the killer kills? I could just stay in a corner and let people die
---
I think you‚Äôve done a pretty good job so far
---
probably
---
\*\*The Entity\*\* is trying to incentivise you to become suicidal by choosing to stay in the trial.
---
Thank you very much, this seems really helpful.
---
No mither, Resilience, dead hard and iron will
---
I literally took this screenshot on the second day I ever played this game.
---
And here I thought Nea would be the one yo get a Chloe skin
---
The did say that, but not in the notes. They also said they are planning on making more changes before the PTB goes live, so here's hoping they add those other events before the end of it.
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt pay to much attention to the top. Lol that‚Äôs my bad your right. This heat and manual labor is killing me today haha
---
mhm. if they made good cosmetics people would literally play them more. viking jeff would create 50 jeff mains
---
Every time i get invited to a party its with some kid who makes monkey noises everytime he gets in a chase and gets downed.
---
That's pretty much my exact build and it works perfectly for me. So yeah I think it's a good build
---
dArN
---
You're right
---
I don't use spirit fury/enduring, that's pretty much a must eh? Nor do I use ruin. I have attained red ranks on her without those 3 top-shelf perks sooo I wouldn't say I'm not good. I used to main her, it's just extremely frustrating "winning" matches with 3k 4k to only see Brutal Killer dark pip galore. I have a much easier time holding red ranks with Legion, Freddy, Wraith, Myers.
---
Her problem is RNG. If you don't get 1-2 helmets on before they clank the first gen you're in trouble. If they get their helmet off on the first box you're in big trouble. She is pretty powerless once you get 4 hooks, her stealth is extremely niche.
---
Saw the same thing
---
You forgot the shot post flair
---
Say, completing a generator, or beating skillchecks could slow the addiction down, so if the killer does nothing then Survs just easily get gens done and leave.
---
Ifeel u
---
That's actually what they did. This isn't the only change to 4headon.
---
That one time you don't use Tenacity on Tapp and this happens:
---
Im sure that killer was a dev
---
Lol I don‚Äôt even play Billy but I really want that skin just because it looks so funny, I‚Äôm laughing so hard at his stupid flip flops and beard

They have separate store banners in the files so I doubt it

What a surprise, Billy's skin suck.
---
Apparently the only 2 good ideas they got for him was the rancher coat and the scarecrow.
---
It honestly feels like its the only playable thing rn
---
I just don‚Äôt understand these devs at all.
---
I think Dwight, meg, nea on survivor side and huntress,wraith, legion on killers
---
Ahh sorry ! Yea anyway still, I agree with you Xd
---
Don't take it to heart. Every single one of those points was rightfully yours.
---
BHVR vastly overestimates how good these effects are.
---
Using Quick and Quiet has allowed me to get several stuns mid-chase using Head On.
---
Those nerfs were barely nerfed and if anyone bothered to read, they were supposed to be on the ptb in the first place
---
I just listed a bunch of new perks that help with other playstyles and you complained about them all. We just had an event where survivors were able to get fireworks which people dont get often.  From my experience, the reason survivors dont get a lot of points is because they spend half the match immersed. 20,000 BP is easy to get if you actually do stuff and not hide behind a rock
---
This looks awesome
---
Or legion who has one add on that does anything significant and it's ultra rare.
---
Anybody else bored of Megs skins ? I get they try to fit the lore of the character. But feels like 90 percent of her skins are work out clothing. All feels the same.
---
Then the nerf to escaping is premature.
---
These are all awesome.
---
Aww I feel bad for laughing so hard, but yay for altruistic squad. My friends roast me all the time for going back to save people, even if I have to die. üò©
---
May I ask what perk that is?
---
That's a lot of shaman / sea refuse looking skins. I wonder if that's a line connected to a new killer?
---
What the fuck is the point of nerfing the survival bonus?  What possible logic could have resulted in someone thinking that was a good idea?
---
This meme gets me everytime.
---
Diver killer with a spear gun that once hit the survivor has to loop around 4 objects to free themselves or slowly be dragged back to the killer.  Once spear is attached the killer speed is reduced to 40% until the survivor is dragged back or breaks the line
---
They really need to work on Haddonfield soon, because the Myers house needs to look like this pronto. It's way way way too ''lived in." for the original Halloween Myers house.
---
Based on RadiantSpark's "logic", you are correct.
---
Stealth works fine as long as they don't run Spine Chill. If you can't get a helmet on before 1st gen, you either need to work on your mindgames or maybe you just got a bad map.
---
As I said though, Spirit Fury/Enduring makes her almost A tier in my book. I couldn't imagine playing without Ruin for her. I use Ruin/PGTW/Spirit Fury/Enduring
---
That's such a Meg thing to say.
---
You couldn't have tried harder? Basically copied my post lmao.
---
FUCK HER RIGHT IN THE PUSSY
---
Everyone be talking about Freddy, but I be wondering: 
---
*Where is my boi Bill for my console gamers?*
---
He got killed on Haddonfield and probably came to rant.
---
You didn‚Äôt answer his question.
---
Black Box is about to be nasty
---
What do ya think about the Freddy re work
---
Geez... It's fucking buff to the perk, did you readed the other change? You can apply the stun to the killer during the entire Head ON animation now. What matters if you get exhausted when you don't stun the killer? Only bad players will rush out of the locker without the stun
---
ngl the lighting is kinda off
---
Holy shit, i actually didn't know
---
People wouldn't have forgotten about it if it didn't *suck*
---
They still feel pretty satisfied if they felt the need to teabag in the first place. It‚Äôs easier to just go up to them and hit them out. ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Why would I when I technically wasn't camping.
---
thats good to know thanks :)
---
Shhh, you insulted his noed. nerf borrowed time. Camping is legit.
---
Another cheeky MoM nerf in this patch.
---
I somewhat recently stopped running tenacity and unbreakable:(
---
And people have complained ad-nauseum during events when additional objectives were added. Do we really want this to turn into another F13 where we creep around playing scavenger hunt for 10 minutes "finding parts" before we can start working on the generators? Bleh.
---
60 seconds s too big gap when rounds usually 5-12 minutes
---
We all did it man dw, dead hard is fun though! Just practise and practise and you‚Äôll eventually get there.
---
lol it‚Äôs not a buff
---
Why are you so mad?
---
His snares just slow like a clown bottle except the slow effectiveness cant be strengthened with add-ons
---
I assume dream pallets don‚Äôt actually stop you
---
Ooo, these are really good. Jeff is my main survivor and I've really been wanting more stuff for him. The "Mad Max" looking Trapper looks great too, and this is the first Hag cosmetic since the red dress that I'm 100% on board for.   
---
Though if I'm being honest they're all great
---
On his own? No not really, but if you put on a gen
---
Protector builds or stuff that'll give you speed bonuses you stand a better chance.
---
Please change the batteries in your smoke detector.
---
it's stronger than the docs because they stay up and the docs is an addon effect, not his primary ability.

Bring play with your food so you can gain 15% extra speed. Judith's tombstone will slow you down a bunch so you'll definitely need it if you want to catch survivors. Ruin and Corrupt intervention should work good together. Last perk could be up to you.
---
I didn‚Äôt mean chase them. I meant it‚Äôs beneficial to hit them once if you‚Äôre already close enough while they‚Äôre getting unhooked so they have to mend through borrowed time while their trap is ticking. Then chase the unhooker

Well yeah but it‚Äôs still not unique. The idea exists already, it‚Äôs just better. It has a unique feature.
---
It's SUPPOSED to take 1 second but right now it's bugged and takes 
---
1.2 seconds.
---
Bamboozle is op
---
Wait isn‚Äôt that basically tenacity with a ‚Äúshit my teammates are too busy doing gens to care‚Äù requirement
---
Dead hard is a great perk, except most of the times is just doesn't work.
---
The killer mains are crying for buffs too after like one game.
---
You're god damn right. However, I do play a ton of survivor more now that i've convinced with friends so really i'm playing both sides.
---
Yes. I had it happen to me. I was the forever asleep obsession, someone DSed and turned into the obsession and I instantly woke up.
---
It's like trapper. It's a power you use before the chase, not so much during.
---
... medic quetins rise up?
---
Hex: Devour Money
---
They made it much easier to land however.
---
I'll have to agree, to an extent. I mean, he's now a normal M1 killer, so there's that, getting rid of all the ways in which having to put survivors to sleep before being able to interact with them could screw Freddy... but the snares and dream pallets seem awfully underwhelming chase tools, and I would argue the ease of getting the first hit in with the dream transition mechanic is more powerful than either of these. I would also argue that his dream wallhacks were on-par with the generator teleport in terms of powerfulness, though I do think the teleport will be more consistent in impactfulness. His add-ons seem rather mediocre, where original Freddy had some very impactful add-ons: Class Photo, Pill Bottle, Masterpiece, Sketch and the Blocks enhanced his base gameplay significantly, and then Red Paint Brush and Black Box as well as the Dresses, Swings and Ropes lent themselves to some more specialized strategies. Crucially, most of these actively changed his gameplay, whereas most of the new add-ons are passive. The new Class Photo seems awfully underwhelming, too - so survivors will preemptively leave generators for a handful of seconds every minute or so, if he teleports? I don't see what powerful effect anyone could see in this. There's not even a husk! New "Z" Block and Pill Bottle are a joke. I guess the new Ropes and Masterpiece might be good, to actually make being in the Dream World kind of oppressive again? I dunno, old Freddy with add-ons seems decidedly stronger to me than new Freddy with add-ons.
---
And then as far as personal preference and "killer personality" goes, I enjoyed the aura-reading ability a lot, both because it made tracking easier, and because it opened up some strategies I enjoyed (especially slugging). He also had an innate end game strength, due to survivors having a harder time breaking out of the Dream World without generators to miss skill checks on, and due to gate-opening speed being halved as well as his ability to slug and control survivors with his god vision. Class Photo + NOED often enabled easy wins. Now he actually gets weaker as the game progresses, gradually losing generators to teleport to, and losing that ability altogether in the end game. The Dream World  is less menacing now. Before, most of the time you wanted to not be in the Dream World, given the 50% action speed debuff and the fact that Freddy can see you. Now there's no real urgency to leave the Dream World - the opposite really, considering that being in the Dream World means you can pop snares/fake pallets while Freddy is otherwise occupied. The reduced cooldown on generator teleports might change things, but ultimately, what really does Freddy achieve with that? He will have to commit to chases if he doesn't want to merely drag out his inevitable defeat, so if there's no reliable in-chase value he gets out of gen teleports (and I can't see how that could be reliable), he doesn't really benefit from the reduced cooldown, as he will still only really want to teleport after ending a chase.
---
Ever since dedicated servers were announced, the date for those has always been summer 2019. Where did you get early 2019 from?
---
Ive been watching streams and he seems balanced and fun now.
---
i want to think that the make your in-game cosmetic contest winner is that swinsuit feng or the cafe surfer one so for every fellow feng main dont worry just yet... wait for the winners reveal
---
Once they add better party management for swf I might play with my friends more because they usually just give up during the long queue times and the re-inviting nonsense
---
A mori won‚Äôt work for the achievement.
---
Queue times are longer for killer since you need 4 survivors for each killer player
---
Are you saying Pig and Wraith make this easier or are you saying they don't stand a chance?
---
Any coordinated swf trying to win will probably get a few escaping even without Prove Thyself. Very rarely will I actually get a sweaty swf that aren't just messing around though. Most teams aren't that coordinated at all and it makes the game a joke tbh.
---
Prove thyself only shaves off 4 seconds and only if they're with someone else. 3 if its with two others. Its just like if they were working on it alone.
---
I've had that happen in basement only once. Everyone just started walking into the basement while I was still in there while I grabbed them off hook. There was only one player trying to do gens while the other 2 tried unhooking the first guy who was hooked
---
Not saying your wrong on it being a calculated wrong (it might be) but that's 30% of different things. Unrelenting is 30% off a missed swing whereas enduring is supposed to be 50% off of a pallet stun. They aren't the same thing.
---
Is it just me or do the graphics look really... crisp?
---
Play With Your Food
---
You either forgot you have been hooked already or you were the last one hooked. If you are hooked as the last survivor, it instantly forces you through the phases to kill you.
---
The current way to counter decisive is to count to 60 after they get unhooked, the perk only works if you pick them up within a minute of being unhooked. So slugging (leaving them in the dying state on the ground) is the only way currently of avoiding it.
---
yeah is he even real? it looks off, like uncanny valley off.
---
Y'ALL WE GOT A NON-ASHY CLAUDETTE WITH MAKEUP I'M SO HAPPYYY
---
So, Ghostface being detected by downed or hooked survivors isn't a glitch?
---
Understood  :) thanks
---
This format needs to be used with all of BHVR‚Äôs amazing decisions
---
Alright this is dope you've created the characters in a different and believable image keep doing what you do
---
feng will win the cosmetic contest for sure so expect either cafe surfer or a bikini feng
---
Dead by daylight Nightmare on elm street chapter really makes you feel like Freddy.
---
Thank you!
---
I highly highly doubt this information is accurate and I'm of the belief that you're pulling these numbers out of your ass. I'm saying it's easier for them because of things at their disposal. What about Killers like Trapper, Myers, Ghostface, Freddy, Leatherface, or Doctor who can't do shit when the map is about 20 million miles wide and tall? And I'm probably guessing you're not at Rank 1 where every Survivor just sits on gens entire game.
---
Please no.
---
We‚Äôll just pretend that never happened, ok?
---
Literally am about to get the perks for a really strong freddy build and boom, rework that takes away the ability to keep track of survivors... rip
---
Legion
---
oh ok thanks!
---
1
---
LMAO
---
That‚Äôs kind of a broad question, but the most important thing is knowing which loops are safe, semi-safe, and not safe. The safer a pallet is, the less mind games are required to loop a pallet you‚Äôve thrown down. Other than that, you gotta practice faking going for a vault or abusing the killer running around a longer part of the loop to run to a new one.
---
Okay!
---
This happens to me way too often and makes me lose quite a few chases. They should have fixed sprint burst and dead hard in one go... The problem is that I activate dead hard , get exhausted, and still get hit when im supposed to be invulnerable.
---
leatherface, 90% of the time his power hurts him more than it helps him
---
Legion for me is a maybe but it's a toss up between Leatherface, Doctor and Ghostface sorta because his ability I dependent on if the Survivors are slightly aware or not. Leatherface is just weak besides his camping abilities and doctor is kinda did not dependent same with GF
---
I‚Äôll admit that inflicting exhausted can be very good, even more so at high ranks where dead hard is more common. Mangled can be good on certain killers but the actual benefit that you gain by inflicting it is very meh imo.
---
If an add on made the snares inflict exhausted I totally think that would be worth a very rare.
---
He got hit by the hatchet, causing him to not leave in time thus leading to his death via the end game collapse
---
Yeah, now thinking about it, his power is really bad
---
Baby hand lmao
---
Just requires getting better at the game, you get more points for ending chases quickly and preventing gens from being done. You‚Äôll lose points each time a survivor heals and when you stay near a hooked survivor
---
i made a steam group that i will use to distribute the lastest versions of the perks and add-ons , and to make the download link easier to find.
---
I will eventually add other variants of the pack. &lt; [ttps://steamcommunity.com/groups/Nebula\_Perks](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Nebula_Perks) \&gt; and add h to the link
---
leatherface
---
good new everyone peanits confirmed that that exhaustion bs wont actually happen
---
Doctor and gf are way stronger than bubba
---
Just happened now on another game where i stood on a hill with one person hooked and another running around apparently im proxying from 30m because im trying to find the other person
---
oooooooohhhhhhhhhhh I forgot what the collapse looks like because it literally never happens when I play lol
---
Whos crying for a nerf? I havent seen anything on reddit and the dbd forums are full of people crying for buffs (as usual)
---
except you can be grabbed out of the locker mid animation, even with the conditions met, so its not risk free at all
---
I will eventually add other variants of the pack. go to my profile to go to the group (links are removed) [https://steamcomm](https://steamcommunity.com/id/EvaZioN67/)[unity.com/id/EvaZioN67/](https://steamcommunity.com/id/EvaZioN67/)
---
Or just... Don't tunnel? Run MYC? So many better options than complain about a perk you can literally ignore, compared to a one down for failing to protect gens.
---
Maybe you‚Äôre not playing him right, you don‚Äôt need iridescent king to do well
---
If you are on the same map and in the same match and hook someone a second time at ANY time you are camping, tunneling AND a try hard sweaty  /s
---
One change the snares with the pallets, the other one it's a farm add-on: you get more deviousness points everytime a survivor walks on a snare.
---
So they are useless together.
---
It's not in the patch notes, but they wrote it in their dev update
---
But if NOED isn't even there, you wasted your time entirely.
---
As a Trapper main whenever I see slippery meat I actually just think, you were waiting for this moment weren't you
---
In-game name. And no I play Valkyrie Meg
---
Its not in the patch notes, but they did say they were adding it in their dev update
---
Ah thank you. But i don't think you can change a title on reddit sadly
---
Holy shit, that's painfully stupid.
---
Yup
---
But I dont use obsession perks and I get picked as obsession many times. Also DS picks a random obsession.

Do you want me to link my steam achievements lol. I've been rank 1 on both sides more times than I've counted.
---
I'm asking myself the same question.
---
Yes, they do.
---
Don‚Äôt tell me this is a real thing.
---
In 3 years of playing I‚Äôve learned they really only listen to killers. I‚Äôm still pointing at crap like this and saying ‚ÄúSee! Told you so..‚Äù to the neigh sayers that the devs are killer bias. Yet I‚Äôm still ‚Äúbad‚Äù, need to ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù, and stop being an ‚Äúentitled survivor‚Äù.
---
I get toxic as fuck back and show 'em how it's done.
---
Yes. They‚Äôve started temp banning on console for dcing.
---
If the survivors DC early in the match, you are absolutely an asshole for going full try-hard.  Still legal and not reportable, but doesn't make you any less of an asshole.
---
Have you tried kyf?
---
*dwight falls down*
---
Welcome to MINECRAFT! Start digging!

Well I mean, how else are they supposed to make money? Of course it's only smart for them to make more cosmetics for a character that most people play, because at the end of the ~month~ day, they still have to pay their Bill's and everything.

"You're like, entitled to your wrong opinions man"
---
Love that response. I'd be dumbfounded if someone said that to me lol
---
&gt; I don't really know what devs, etc. do when they receive a report
---
[I do.](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71c0DL1veGL._SX425_.jpg)
---
Why are you like this?
---
Running DS increases your chance of being the obsession. Some other very good perks have that effect as well.  
---
I play killer a lot, and it‚Äôs very rare none run obsession perk, and almost everytime the obsession has some.
---
Wait wait...You did this with wraith and only his perks and there were no gens done...holy shit those guy suck what rank are you
---
Someone is extra large mad...
---
Wait.... tru3 or freddy
---
That one guy out there who hates playing against trapper; just you wait bich
---
Reduces action speed of survivors in the dreamworld.
---
2 people, 10% per person, 44 x 0.20 = 8.8 44 - 8.8 = 35.2
---
Nurse probably.
---
tbh i expected bloodwarden.
---
Leatherface you have to be a complete idiot to go down to his saw he also has no map pressure
---
Thank you, I now know that I should use up all my blocks (except for the black one) before the update is live.
---
Yup just something to eat up my precious blood points on my blood web when I don‚Äôt want it or have ever used it!
---
They added an end game timer once the exit gates open to keep people from fucking around and farming blood points or just to hide from the killer to make them mad.
---
If they had shitty teammates and were just a flat out potatoes or they had enough balls to run no mither
---
She younger than that..
---
Yeah that sounds right.
---
Holy shit I thought that the unwind series wasn't that popular nor would I see it refrenced.
---
Risk/reward. You risk possibly wasting your time in exchange for getting rid of a strong end game perk. The alternative is rushing through gens and getting stomped in the end game.
---
I don't hate it, just odd to me. As far as the story itself I've also been having a lot of issues actually playing lately. Certainly tiresome.
---
I put them on every time I start getting more slugs and as soon as I do no one fucking slugs me then I take them off and its slugs galore &gt;:(
---
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
You mate are part of a big problem here
---
This is why I have no mercy or forgiveness for survivors anymore. The whole lot of them are shit, even the ones you're nice to.
---
Still going on with this, eh?
---
Going after someone who was just hooked isn't necessarily tunneling, braindead survivor main argument to imply that. And yeah there's counterplay for it, no shit. There's counterplay for noed too, but somehow that's unfair?
---
I do still hope some spots remain semi bad as that is suppose to be the risk although no matter what ppl will remember the spawn locations
---
Nurse is the way. At first its frustrating but when u get the hang of it toxic swfs are gonna die
---
It's bhvr
---
Yea I mean if you count Jane's porno screams
---
Screaming? Good, cool. Screaming so loud it eclipses every other sound in the game by 20dB? Bad, poor design, universally reviled by audio engineers and people with functional ears.
---
4.2 means he will be as faster as survivors
---
I do have a question though. The killer powers and favours/offerings are single jpgs, how am I meant to apply them?
---
How dare you have a brain!!1!!!!1!11!
---
Black Box will be annoying and all the block addons are useless
---
got it fire the fucking art director and hire some more technical development.
---
No moris, I've been using garbage offerings as a joke (like the "slight lessens the fog" offering) or no offerings, since nothing matters in the PTB.
---
No friends.
---
The true conditions for the hatch are:
---
The hatch APPEARS after
---
Number of gens done=number of survs alive +1
---
So if there are 2 survivors left, you need to have 3 gens complete before it appears somewhere
---
This means to get the achievement on Xbox requiring everyone to escape through hatch, you need 4 (survivors alive) + 1 generators on to make it appear, so... all five
---
The hatch OPENS after there‚Äôs only one survivor alive or if you use a key. If the hatch has not appeared yet, but there‚Äôs only one player alive, it automatically appears and opens
---
You can escape through the hatch if not a single gen has been powered SO LONG as you‚Äôre the only survivor remaining
---
Going full try-hard and killing the remaining survivors aren't necessarily mutually inclusive
---
I try to not let it bother me.
---
One thing I do is if a killer is especially toxic, I just ask them WHY they are being like this.
---
The responses I usually got were rather remorseful in nature, so it's a good idea to do that. For example: You have just been tunnelled all match.
---
"Why did you tunnel me? I wasn't being toxic..."
---
This is low rank but I'm low too I have like 60h
---
I mean they've stuck mostly to her character theme of a runner/athlete. 
---
They could give her some pretty stuff or out there stuff I suppose, but she's had plenty of skins now. It's time for her to take a break and let other survivors get some looks.
---
One day we might get workshop integration.
---
*One day...*
---
No, not really. Ive hooked people, then hooked another, then go into a full chase with the first guy from healthy state just to be hit by ds. It doesnt happen often, but it definitely does happen.
---
Come on now, its not that hard to find people to play with
---
So that Red Trapper skin is the one that‚Äôs probably exclusive to the Switch for the time being right? I remember seeing something about that on this sub a day or two ago
---
What does Mike Tyson bring with him when hiking?
---
**Bear Maith.**
---
better be able to get the meg one with iridescent shards cause the current ones you can get with iridescent are sooo ugly
---
I don't care about that. If someone unhooks another person right in front me, I'll go after the unhooker because I don't want BT or DS to steal my momentum and it'll probably give me another BBQC stack.
---
Yup.
---
He's much faster when he possesses somebody.
---
Well, yes I know that the dev update did have that written. But the question was if it was implemented in this update already.  
---
It is, however, the just PTB patch so things are still very likely to change.
---
&gt;But why this happen so often to dbd, but I never saw that much happen with other games?
---
Because in other games, the new content files aren't straight up PNG files (screenshots). You would need specific render softwares and knowledge to handle these softwares to get a potential leak. On top of that, not many game developers allow their whole public to have access to a game build before its release date.

Is there any way Amanda's letter on pig can be useful with another addons?

Yeah and I get why, SWF groups are always toxic as fuck.

SSSSSAAAAAAAVVVVVVEEEEE MEEEEEEEE
---
What if someone (not chucky) disconnects while in the doll?
---
I'll have to test the friendliness of randoms in the post-game chat then. We'll see
---
But that's survivor points per game. What's the survivor ratio to killer points per hour? A killer is in the game the entire time, if a survivor dies early they can get out and get into another game. So is it possible they are just balancing BP/hour instead of BP/game?
---
They're literally fighting for their lives, what does it matter if they see you?
---
now that's just dramatic...
---
Oooh, I see, thanks. Also gf leak was released in the official patch not in the ptb, his model and even atuff
---
What happened?
---
&gt;No moris, I've been using garbage offerings as a joke (like the "slight lessens the fog" offering) or no offerings, since nothing matters in the PTB.
---
Don't know then. 
---
Some people have being DCing upon coming across a Mori because not only it is boring, it serves no purpose to testing. You can't truly know how weak or strong the new Freddy is if you remove survivors earlier rather than hooking them 3 times.
---
PTB?? If so, only played freddy. If not, I don‚Äôt blame them.
---
I use him occasionally.
---
He is better at patrolling than most m1 killers like trapper or cannibal but it‚Äôs not substantial.
---
Lol. Play killer. All you hear is DUNNDUNNDUUNDADADUNTUHTATATATA. And a few screams here and there.
---
If the survivor impressed me, a.e. actually outsmarted me.

---
I mean I agree with you. If you don't want to be exhausted, don't sprint out of a cabinet. As long as they make the perk more consistent and have it stun when it should, this is a non issue
---
I just hate Claudette
---
i was having a terrible day then i saw this post and i'm so dang happy
---
Oh yea, I was wondering. Does the Obsession change normally with the Black box? Or what is the logic with ds etc? Any ideas?
---
Anything but red ranks.
---
If I completely obliterate a team (like if I have 5-6 hooks before a gen even gets done) I usually let everyone go
---
What? What about the next chapter? They have to make concept arts for maps, characters, and powers. Yeah. I never said Behavior shouldn‚Äôt sell skins. I‚Äôm just saying that the argument that artists don‚Äôt work on the  code is stupid. More skins, the more Behavior has to invest on people making the 3d model. How ducking hard is that to understand?
---
Depends on what killer I am. If I'm Spirit or Nurse and the game is basically over immediately (e.g. two quick hooks, a DC, quick basement hook) I'll usually go easier and let some gens get done. 
---
Other than that, it's entirely up to the survivors. If I get teabags and *clickclickclick* a whole bunch then I have no remorse with slugging and tunneling. If they play normal or are being funny I'll usually chill.
---
Too bad teabagging and flashlight spam is omnipresent in higher ranks. Not sure how the survivor experience is, but goddamn, killer can be miserable sometimes.
---
I guess it would just be treated as if the survivor had gone AFK in the doll.
---
Chucky will continue draining power over time, eventually gaining a permanent body.
---
Not a great solution for now, but with Dedicated Servers coming soon, the devs will be able to implement a "reconnect to match" button.

Be brave little one.

Have they reworked fredy or could he alwaya did this ?
---
If they earn my respect or pity, I let them live.
---
Players that are better than me and not toxic? Check.

Baby Dwights being farmed by their red rank friends? Check.
---
People who looked at me pleasingly after I caught them fair and square? Check, but give me an offering to be safe.
---
I‚Äôm gonna take a wild guess before I look and say that meg claudette and nea all got new skins.... like always....
---
And the music for that matter
---
Sooooooo goooooood hahaha
---
Claudette‚Äôs a sweetheart. Be better
---
Listen to the scooby doo theme while playing
---
In a survivor body, Chucky is a normal M1 killer with the agility of a survivor.
---
Until the Doll is sacrificed, Chucky is kept in check by the Doll, since it can still harm him and the survivor trapped inside will be dead set on putting their old body back on ahook.
---
Once the Doll is gone, though, Chucky is unopposed.
---
Obviously you gotta learn to play nurse and kill people like this.
---
Assert your dominance.
---
I have this one friend who‚Äôs extremely toxic and always says killers complain and that they are babies, and I normally keep my mouth shut but I feel like this post is literally every survivor I‚Äôve ran into that‚Äôs toxic/whiney and sounds like something he‚Äôd say.
---
Nea looks a beach bum hippie on her new skin with the hat. the rest of the skins look okay but they need to update the models on the survivors.
---
They are looking more and more off with each new and better graphed skins they get.
---
&gt;Isnt Tapp supposed to be getting a blue policeman uniform? Or did i dream that?
---
These cosmetics are from 3.1.0 build. The cosmetic you are referring to are present on 3.0.0 build (current live version). They will be released in the 3 weeks (one collection every Wednesday).

Well ok, she just seems to be the hardest survivor to play against (non dlc wise).

killers act like they don't know what these things are üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

This is pretty much what i meant. I think the perk could be fun and I would love to meme around with it and q&amp;q, but pretty much everytime i tried to use it it ended up not working even if i met the 3 second condition and killer was literally right in front of locker. I havent used it since the first 3 weeks Jane came out bc of this, if they fix that i wont have any issue. I mean it still would just be a meme and would be the worst exhaustion perk but itd at least be functional
---
It is when you are a Sociopath.

Leatherface.

well sure, but those levels are nowhere near comparable to the dbd screams lol
---
now if you wanna talk about release apex legends drop music volume levels, that's a different story...
---
How dare you be a smart killer and outsmart them!
---
No, I don‚Äôt think so. But I could be wrong, someone correct me if I am.
---
to be fair, as a killer main. i think his ability to hit you into the dream state is a big too much considering how much already puts you in the dream state but otherwise, i think freddy is perfectly balanced ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

---
Feels like you are asking what you can do to get sparred. Most of the time i spare people for reasons outside of their behavior, i just feel like it.
---
But last time someone made me spare him, it was a dwight. For the whole game he went easy on me. No hard loops or anything. At the end there was only him and a nea left. He just stood there crouched against a wall and looked sad. I was the pig and i decided to crouch with him. then we walked together around the map crouched. he pointed where nea was and we t bagged her together. Then i let both of em go lol
---
I followed a twitch streamer who is on PC and devotion 15.

Dead Hard is actually bugged on the PTB now, sometimes when trying to use it, it will literally do nothing but exhaust you.

Eh, it kinda sucks when you get a 3-4 man squad all camping the hook, bodyblocking and bullying you when you're like in your third game ever...

Ehh it depends on where the totem is (also that‚Äôs why I hate Lerys it‚Äôs to confined it makes killers suffer because it‚Äôs got windows galore and survivors can‚Äôt find totems
---
What is a Dream Pallet? I didn't see a description in the patch notes. I know Freddy places them, but what do they do and what are the conditions on placing them?
---
Really? I thought they were changing totem locations on all maps. Damn, Badham is getting as reworked as Freddy
---
Ah! I see. So the benefit is you're basically a better legion at that point permanently able to vault windows and pallets.

I like it! That's brutal.

It's a harmless fun perk as it is. Most times it's probably a wasted slot. I've only seen it work once and it was when my bf was playing the killer. He had no clue why he got stunned. I told him I think she bumped you with her big booty. Then she teabagged going up the basement stairs and he downed her.
---
Feng Min and David are tied for the least amount of cosmetics for characters released before the cosmetic shop (Kate and Clown's DLC). I think they both need love. Sure, Feng Min just got one, but it sucks that she only gets one seemingly every 6 months. I don't get why they keep making Meg, Claudette, and Nea cosmetics constantly, don't they get enough new outfits?
---
"You didn't let me do the thing that is advantageous to me and does not help you at all. My fun was thwarted."
---
I wanna see someone make those faces.
---
I hope there‚Äôs more to this.  I prefer to play survivor but the BP difference is insane.  My time to play this game is limited so I end up playing killer to earn BP so I can kind of keep up with all the new killers/survivors and their teachable perks.
---
Easy 25k + 4 stack BBQ every game.  Meanwhile as survivor I can get stuck on generators all match or get hosed by teammates and finish with 12-15k as survivor.
---
Fungus Mungus.
---
I have two methods of trying to deal with salt that this game gives me.
---
I mostly play survivor, but when I get a shitty game I stop and take a minute, probably browse pinterest/reddit and doodle a little bit before attempting to get back into the game. It calms me down from the anger I just had to deal with.
---
If I keep getting shit on that day in survivor matches I just switch to killer, I'm not super experienced with killer (rank 14 killer in comparison to my rank 6 survivor), but apparently hate fueled rage makes me actually go after survivors and actually get shit done as killer.
---
Nea really does look like shit all the time huh. Meanwhile, peep that fuckin Jane skin tho.
---
New irridecent head buff looking neat.
---
&gt;**Hatchets** will now cause survivors to *FUCKING DIE* on hit
---
Teleport looks like something out of a horror movie and the looks of the powers are nice. 
---
Well done BHVR, Just wish he was like the doctor and could use both powers at once/have two stances.
---
It'd also make a lot of sense, given the sleepy/tired theme
---
Bottom left is when I nut.
---
fuggit dude let them camp the hook. that's the benefit/curse of playing against swf groups. they usually are pretty bold and altruistic; so you can count on them basically being stupid in order to save one another. use it to your advantage. if they camp the hooks, swing. take the free hit. so the surv wiggles free. chase em down. let the other survs take the hit for the others. just keep chasing. spreading damage around is better for you anyway since it means the survs need to spend more time off gens in order to heal back up.
---
Sigh *unzips*
---
What in the hell purpose does the kids drawing have. Why would Anyone use it?!
---
Rollercoaster of emotions (literally)
---
Thank you!!
---
Basically any year old
---
Red paint brush/jump rope combo looks interesting.
---
Where are all the dwight skins?!?!
---
So its available now?? Hot damn. Thanks dudeface.
---
&gt;Damn. Totally looks like you could jump it.
---
Here is a closer view (unless you were talking about something else)
---
[Closed window](https://i.imgur.com/u40nBc5.jpg)
---
Well you dont have to actually talk to them, just ask if they want to test freddy with you
---
Is that still possible after the functionality improvements?
---
From a certain height like the factory in Macmillan estate then Yh however when jumping from the tug boat or porch roofs then it‚Äôs a joke. I‚Äôm mainly referring to when a killer is carrying you and skips the stairs for the basement as with the already broken wiggle mechanic, makes it even harder to jump free
---
Bill Cypher for next killer?
---
Rule of thumb: If you do anything that doesn't let the survivor win: YOU are the piece of shit.
---
I know that now, I'm just saying I've kinda of a trauma from bodyblocking and hook camping, so I can understand when people complain about it. I know it's an ineffective strategy, but all of them also managed to escape because, again, I was new and they easily juked me.
---
Who‚Äôs the real stealth killer? Wraith or Claudette lol
---
Well, it is the same thing with Speedlimiter for Billy and LF - The Padded Jaws for trapper. Just something to hinder you for more BP.
---
"all addons"
---
Swing Chains: Am I a joke to you?
---
Damn I was really hoping we'd get Classic Freddy with the rework
---
Dear BHVR:
---
BLINDNESS AND HAEMMORHAGE ARE GARBAGE.
---
Nah I'm done
---
If they are not assholes I let them go most times as I don‚Äôt wanna rank up
---
The outcome of a goofy comment, fueled by coffee, too little sleep, and a lot of DbD gameplay binging.
---
I hear Jeff bridges
---
Felt it was needed since it was dbd themed :p
---
With that healing change came a huge nerf to slugging. All map rng changes have been in favor of survivor. Besides it's not like every time one side sees a change the other needs one too. Then it wouldn't actually balance anything.
---
Idk how long it takes to bleedout from it, but it's paused when in the killers terror radius, and the killer cant see the progress of the bar.
---
I‚Äôm sorry let me just let you get 10 feet ahead of me
---
Wonderful as always!
---
True I tried to make it as dark as possible. Still need to improve the lighting a lot thougj. Hardest part of sfm ;)
---
I always see these weird issues and lag problems on console
---
Your matchmaking must be rough
---
I hope dedicated servers come sooner for you guys, pc isn't so bad at least in my area (NA East)
---
Eh, I like that part of Trapper. It means he can't place traps in critical walking areas without having to respect them himself.
---
It would make Basement Trapper(which is basically already how you play him according to a few high level Trapper mains) stronger because you can have the killer shack basement fully kitted out with 3 traps and not have to worry about placing one after hooking.
---
By Basement Trapper, I don't mean a meme like Basement Bubba, I mean just literally normal Trapper meta perks plus you guard the generators around the basement.
---
It might be super confusing for survivors. First you can wake up, then you become obsession (you ds or some other reason) and you cannot anymore.  Pretty interesting anyways!
---
Shoulda hit him with ‚Äúmy lobby, my rules‚Äù
---
HAH relatable. 10/10 meme!
---
You might have been playing against people with object of obsession on constantly, which is quite popular now because of GF
---
People use head on???
---
I love this.
---
if someone rains on my parade with another screenshot of this type of meme already being done i'm gonna cry
---
I take credit for the Mori-er

---
Imagine being on your first hook in basement and the Claudette finally comes down, she opens the chest which is fine cause you have enough time before second stage, and then, SHE JUST FUCKING LEAVES.
---
^^I ^^died ^^on ^^that ^^hook.
---
It's already like that in the current version of the game I think.
---
I like playing against him tbh it‚Äôs fun and no one plays him in red ranks üòî
---
I take credit for the Mori-er üòé
---
Black Box went from being a piece of shit to being one of the most powerful weapons in his arsenal.
---
flair checks out
---
Or possibly there are players from both sides just like in the actual game.
---
Wish I could use more than 15 perks.
---
Let them post salt. If you're a killer, don't care what they post. They can say anything they want, and it just makes them look like awful people.
---
One thing I don‚Äôt understand is how for survivor, WGLF gives you a max of double bp if you get 4 saves or take hits, but the only bonus it gives Is points. BBQ&amp;C gives a max of double BP if you hook all 4 survivors at least once AND gives auras after hooks?? I don‚Äôt get why the most meta killer perk also rewards you with double bp but some random survivor perk that gives double bp if you save 4 times gives nothing else.
---
Also when I play killer (rank 3 rn) I consistently get a 4K with like 27k points and black pip,  but if I hook a lot and get less points I double pip? And as survivor there‚Äôs no way to double pip unless you either farm or your team does nothing. Because maxing gen points and chase points in the same game as well as saving teammates is so  rare. (rank 1 survivor 1K hrs btw)
---
They changed it for survivors.
---
Why does your game look so colorful?
---
CALL MY NAME AND SAVEEE MEEE FROM THE DAAARK
---
i dont think they did
---
My blood points üò¢
---
Top one betrayal in general
---
That... is genius.
---
Huntress Lullaby with Unnerving Presence on and bringing a Game map offering is peak Doctor
---
Well i am done with this game until the archives arive, i hope they will be good.
---
When I come down to the last survivor, if I haven't been body blocked or flashlight spammed, I'll down them, pick them up, and drop them at the hatch/gate. Or if their team was shit and they actually tried
---
‚ÄúBuT yOu CaNt DoWn PeOpLe iN fReNzY sO iTs UsElEsS‚Äù
---
Yeah I hate when it does that
---
I kind of want to combine jump rope with either red paint brush por black box now, black box obviously with STBFL and they are making slow progress anyway.
---
When i play killer i would actually prefer that because then i can bait pick ups and hit other survivors while someones downed and not have to worry about gens getting rushed.
---
I'm really liking that Trapper
---
and yet it's still happening. "why do survivors get a heads up when im teleporting? i should be able to teleport them and instantly hit them dammit!!!1"
---
&gt;Paused in terror radius
---
Thank you for the reply.
---
Why is this not stated on the power in-game? That is one of the most unintuitive aspects of the power.
---
When you think about it, it almost like an entirely new chapter release on console...
---
Would it be too strong if it worked a bit like Bloody Coil where stepping in a dream snare would injure you as well as make you bleed? (but couldn't down you)
---
By the way, blindness does NOT block the dream clocks. Just like Pig Jigsaw Boxes and Plague Fountains.
---
omg
---
It needs to be paired with someone to mask the bell sound, either the one to make it silent or the one where survivors can't tell the distance.
---
You may catch someone off guard with this but mostly you're going to be chasing like all other killers and the add ons I mentioned before are MUCH stronger for that.
---
Spirit is worst to play against, doctor/legion is worst to play as
---
Hillbilly was called "The Crooked" back when the game was in beta. Most people aren't aware of it now.
---
As for the pig, you'll have to ask the moderators about that.
---
Making it actually work as originally intended with an unnecessary nerf.
---
He seems really fun to pay and I can't wait...
---
Kinda nervous about being survivor now but agree I play him for awhile, we'll see
---
On the other hand:
---
&gt;Increased the Killer Blind score event from 250 to 500 (while in a chase).
---
Guess I'm flashlight blinding at every pallet now.
---
Let‚Äôs look at what new freddy has
---
-map pressure: his teleportation works well with bbq and tremors
---
-chase abilities: pallets and snares
---
-better stall: he no longer has to manually sleep everyone to slow down the game
---
New freddy should go "Ah Ah Ah" everytime he gets stunned by a pallet, that would be so symbolic for his buff Lol
---
Mending is a slight inconvenience but doesn‚Äôt impede the game much.
---
At base, no perks, no add-ons, Legion is easily the worst. Their power actively impedes chases. Survivors can easily get away, juke, or hide from an approaching Legion since their terror radius will give them away. Legion can get a much easier first hit at the cost of losing more distance. Its not ‚Äúfree‚Äù. Most survivors will know not to group up or to split up once they know its Legion, which works to their advantage and not any Killer‚Äôs. Survivors get all the gens done more efficiently/quickly working on their own.
---
Legion may as well be an M1 killer. Legion actively encourages a play style that is detrimental to their goal as Killer by having survivors avoid grouping up.
---
Loading screen will only say the first few times you face that killer. And if splinters were nit secret, people would know who they're facing. If they dc, they are just being a baby.
---
There are still other perks that can aura read... Just Freddy is given far more map control that he doesn't need to slow jog from one of of the map to the other until the area disappeared
---
TIL, thx for the information. The pig complaint was just griping from a pig main, no real issue there.
---
Is than an Adam skin for Leatherface?
---
Blow a skill check or juke him (no aura read) and get to someone who is awake or your alarm clock. Or adrenaline.
---
Wow buddy that was a great response
---
That Ghost Face looks AMAZING
---
He's better in literally every way than before besides the aura reading. His biggest issue was generator pressure but now with his teleporting ability he finally can put pressure on gens
---
Its an add on he can use that lets do that in tier 3
---
oof
---
i have literally not seen anyone using it in any of my matches since it went live.
---
Yeah there is an ultra rare addon that makes michael able to do that
---
ok thanks
---
I guess it really depends on what's your style? I personally think Nea and Feng (although she has few) have some good ones for the female survior, while Dwight and Ace have some of my favorites for the males, they all have at least 1 or 2 items I like though.
---
Doc's suit skins (especially the purple variant), Huntress' miss kitty, and all of Legion's are pretty good. Again they all have at least one cosmetic you'll probably enjoy.
---
It‚Äôs not really new is it?
---
Why is the last line crossed out?
---
ez dc
---
You do get alot of blood points for opening gates. The most risky thing you could do is open both the gates by yourself. You'd get alot of blood points that way although the killer will most likely find this out when they notice that a survivor is still in the trial.
---
I mean, it would still be balanced if they added sprint burst, borrow time and decisive into it if you get caught right? /s
---
If one hook = 1 stack.  One gen should count as a stack.
---
I have literally been getting hints non stop about what killer I am going to face and I have 4days and 8 hours game time and still it tells me which killer I am facing, plus even if they knew who they were facing they don‚Äôt even get to change perks to counter the killer they just know what they‚Äôll have to do which is only a slight advantage. I don‚Äôt care about the people who disconnected it‚Äôs their choice to disconnect I just think it‚Äôs rather ridiculous how when a swf disconnects before a match even starts the killer loses all add ons and offerings.
---
if they did, they won't be anymore
---
it‚Äôs just a bp farming addon now, like padded jaws, speed limiter, the beast soot, etc.
---
He is kinda hard to play at high ranks I can usually do pretty well with him though most people would rather play nurse, billy, or spirit because of the speed of the games :/
---
I can only speak from other games but I‚Äôd say just wait
---
Complaining about a straw man on the internet because a perk no one complains about is being changed makes you look much less entitled and whiny, that's for sure!
---
What's wrong with showing a little mercy? I've let plenty of people escape through the hatch. If I racked up a ton of bloodpoints and enjoyed the match a 3k is enough for me.
---
Why are they discouraging escaping?
---
If they had teammates who dc'd or killed themselves and they dont wiggle i give hatch
---
You dont have to let them go but would it kill you to let them get a few points so they dont depip from a game that was lost from the start
---
Left Behind is 100% a dead perk slot now. Like at least before EGC theres a chance a killer is super paranoid and is camping hatch so you can get that last gen super fast but now theres literally no reason for the killer not to instantly close hatch as soon as they find it, causing gens to no longer be workable. If you bring Left Behind theres like a 10-30 second window its even available to use before it gets completely deleted. Even with the considerable generator repair speed it gives you I don't think thats enough time to do a full gen. Its so bad now and not fitting for Bill's character anyways. The only way its tied to him at all is that &gt;!his death in L4D revolves around being the only person left in their little "trial" and having to finish off a generator restart to save the ones he loves.!&lt; The way it works in game is much mroe likely to be well everyone else is fucking dead lmao. You aren't so much "Left Behind" as you are the Sole Survivor, which is another perk entirely.
---
I think a potentially good change for Left Behind would be for it to cause one exit gate to instantly open when the Killer shuts the hatch to trigger EGC. I think it would still be super niche enough to not get used to the point of being meta breaking but would be better than being completely useless. Its still not thematic either but what can you do I guess.
---
With what feels like more flashlight warriors, I been running this perk already üòé
---
the entity: ok killer now remember that i feed on emotions ok? that means you gotta toy with them, let them feel hope and fear, draw it out and give me a good snack
---
killer: ok
---
killer: *kills everyone before they even have the chance to feel any strong emotions*
---
entity: displeased
---
killer: surprised pikachu.jpg
---
Most of the time it‚Äôs the survivors fault when the killer 3-gens them. If you did all the generators on one side of the map meanwhile all the killer has to do is read a newspaper and wait for someone to show it is really nobody but you and you‚Äôre team‚Äôs fault
---
Wow...what an asshole.
---
Yeah I love leatherface i play him most at the moment
---
They can't do the bunny skin because it fucks with their code too much. So a dev told me.
---
Thana is good on Plague too since everyone is broken. Glad I could help!!
---
You understand that the killer does more work in the trial right? He should consistently get more BP. Also, everything i listed is viable. Im sorry the devs havent made an invisibility perk that lets you fly onto buildings away from killers and insta heal yourself.
---
Give credit or delete it is not yours
---
At least on console we will have Bill releasing.
---
"No I don't think I will"
---
So I played 3 games this morning.
---
1st game ghostface. I'm on a gen another survivor goes down. Ok. Finish gen and they get pulled off. Awesome. They go right back down again. Dammit they're being camped. That's ok I have borrowed time. I run over there take a hit and A GOD DAMN CLAUDETTE PULLS HER OFF RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. Both me and the other survivor goes down because claudette is an idiot that pulls people in front of killers without borrowed time. Killer hooks me and goes into night shroud immediately after like an idiot so I reveal him. He didn't like that. So he went behind a rock and waited for me to unhooked knock me down again. And again, however before the final hook he did teabag me for a minute so I could know his full displeasure. That ghostface was an ass but I think I'm still more pissed off about that stupid claudette more than anything.
---
2nd Game Legion. I unhooked a survivor in front of him with borrowed time so I became his target. Hooked me and just stood there repeatedly hitting me while the other survivors got 4 gens done. Good teammates. Couldn't have saved me but they did punish the killer so good on them.
---
3rd game Legion. Sandbagging followed by a 'soft patrol'.
---
Biggest problem is I've only been playing for 3 days and I don't have the greatest perks.
---
you could say that effect on that rarity of an add-on causes bloodpoint costs to be
---
**too much for zblock**
---
that actually sounds pretty fun ngl. I'd rather go around trying to find parts than hold m1 and do an occasional skill check until the generator is complete
---
a lot of these look great and remind me of deathgarden!
---
I don't play this game, can u explain why u fucked up? Isn't it the point to kill all the survivors as the bad guy?

Not OP but I'm using this next time tbh üòÇ
---
The problem with most exhaustion add-ons is they aren't nearly as high rarity as they need to be. Huntress being able to completely invalidate a perk slot by hitting 1 hatchet that has a gray rarity add-on is pretty dumbo imo.
---
I‚Äôve tried to be civil and objective but you are just constantly jumping to conclusions and stretching everyone‚Äôs words. No one is trying to be invincible, and the fact that you are so gung-ho only proves how much of a 4head you are.
---
‚ÄúHow dare you outplay me and counter my perks. You are inferior for this. I am clearly the superior gamer here.‚Äù
---
I KNOW!
---
Generator teleport?
---
It looks so lifelike, im gonna have nightmares for the next week now.
---
Speed Limited is great if you're the sort of person that really only cares about bloodpoints and doing dailies. I use it every time I have a "Hit/Down 3 survivors with Hillybilly/Cannibal" dailies. Super fun tbh.
---
Why do survivers lose items and perks when a killer DCs
---
&gt;4 days and 8 hours.
---
it is until you come to this sub and realise there are 50 different rules made up on the spot or youre """""""""""toxic"""""""""""

---
Okay well I‚Äôm not rank 20 so no point in debating killers who have no perks or add ons. If you want to talk like that then 95% of killers are shit. Legions power only impedes chases if you‚Äôre dumb and use it to chase an injured person. Otherwise his power guarantees a first hit no matter the loop. Then you can use his power to hit other survivors nearby or chase the injured guy if he‚Äôs in an unsafe spot. You say people at the edge of the TR will just run away but with the speed and duration of Frenzy you will be able to catch up to them.  Also not sure why you mentioned hiding against Legion when his power gives him wallhacks. You‚Äôre not hiding from Legion once he stabs someone in Frenzy. 
---
‚ÄúLegion may as well be an M1 killer‚Äù
---
Yeah that‚Äôs exactly what he is. He‚Äôs an M1 killer who has a free first hit, decent tracking, decent game slow down (whether because of mending or survivors healing), and he‚Äôs one of, if not the best killer at punishing survivors who group.
---
I‚Äôm not trying to convince people hes a top tier killer, I‚Äôm not trying to say that he‚Äôs Nurse or Spirit tier. But Legion definitely has enough going for him that he‚Äôs far from the worst killer in the game.
---
No the survivors were good sports
---
Funny how someone downvoted me even with the ‚Äú/s‚Äù added, how dumb can you be
---
Will say tho, all the ‚Äúrules‚Äù each side are stupid. This killers ‚Äúrule‚Äù is just as dumb as ‚Äúkillers who use NOED are pussies‚Äù ‚Äúnot letting the last survivor go makes you a dick‚Äù and ‚Äúno tunneling/camping‚Äù rules. Let people play how they want.
---
Im saying this as a survivor main btw
---
Well the Killer gets bloodpoints If someone dcs. The survivor not .
---
Freddy is getting a rework so that could be interesting
---
The devs are DEFINITELY not killer sided.
---
Yeah, a couple of days ago someone posted about it along with a picture of it happening. I have no idea if the devs acknowledged it yet or not, but it‚Äôs at least known of here in the sub. Didn‚Äôt see it when I looked through the patch notes either
---
No ones reading that
---
Fun
---
Sorry about that I was referring to when he downed the survivor and the entity grab him. I just never seen that yet so far.. barely started playing
---
Yea. Like an improved version.
---
wow you sound pretty good for someone who has only been playing 3 days
---
RIP in the chat
---
I think this kid accidentally stumbled upon this sub. It's best he return back with his own kind
---
Dude I‚Äôm a Freddy main but current freddy is bad, he‚Äôs hard mode.
---
I run self care, bond, lithe and premonition.

I‚Äôm just a poor Dwight~

I need no sympathy~
---
4 + 19 = 23 
---
‚Äî&gt; 23/2 = 11.5 which is basically your rank.
---
I wished SWF Matchmaking always worked like that tbh..
---
warframe has a 8 dev team, they don't work over 40 hours a week on their game and still provide accurate time's for their releases or just release it when ready. They don't take good feedback from players on the PTB
---
Idk. This sub doesn't take jokes/sarcasm well.
---
Oh my God, Kate and Jeff!!
---
It just turned into an annoyance when you litteraly hooked someone and they basicly almost force themselves into you and you get DS'ed, because clearly I tunneled them there.
---
I've watched streams of this for around a year now. I already had a knowledge of the basics and what NOT to do. Though playing and watching are completely different experiences. I got to rank 12 pretty quickly but there's only so much I can do with limited perks and limited map knowledge. I currently run Iron will, borrowed time, small game(I hate NOED), and spine chill. I have no exhaustion perks because I started leveling Jake and now realize that was a mistake and I should have started with Meg. Or have gotten bond from the shrine. Or maybe I should abandon my team and replace borrowed time with lightweight.
---
It was just a mistake, he got killed by the community but then regained respect with his humor and empathy. That stressed might have been caused by what he was doing right before the stream, as a game director he has a ton of work to do
---
Please someone please tell me why does No Mither tell the killer that I‚Äôm running it... then he just avoids slugging me.. whats the point.. i mean we‚Äôre already sacrificing being healthy.... i would rly love to know why that‚Äôs so
---
also Warframe isn't made by ubisoftand its 14 devs my bad

I straddle between red/purple rank most of the time, I just run a build that plays best for my specific style. I don't really follow a build (that I know of) and it works for how I enjoy to play the game. You could have the most meta build ever and still not make it to red ranks if it doesn't match how you enjoy/productively play the game.
---
I use Lithe, Self-Care, Spine Chill and Urban Evasion.
---
killers at high ranks will gladly eat pallets with enduring since its better than getting possibly mind gamed by the survivors for respecting them, dont know why you are getting downvoted
---
She's the hardest to see, yeah.
---
As a solo survivor I wish I could use more than 5 perks because I‚Äôll run Bond or Kindred.
---
Idk, it might be implemented in a later patch
---
He is fun
---
I still support getting a safety pip for Escaping or getting a 4k. If you do either of those you obviously deserve to at least get a safety pip none of this entity displeased bullshit
---
If its in front of me ill down the unhooked to deny the saviour points. Then ill chase the savior.
---
I highly doubt they‚Äôre just 14 considering the amount of players playing it and his quite good success by being a f2p. Maybe they were 14 in the beginning, but handling a f2p game and releasing content in time isn‚Äôt something that a 14 people team can handle
---
Not surprising. It was an overpowered perk with no drawbacks that got dumpstered.
---
I play solo from time to time.
---
I run Plunderers, DS, BT, and Ace in the hole if games are chill.
---
If I see a ton of sweaty killers I will put on Dead Hard/Lithe and Deliverance over AITH and plunderers
---
Haha very funny... You know this post that u reposted from my ig acc is mine right?
---
Yes, clown has more mobility but also adds the skill shot, aka the Yeetability, factor. 
---
The window change though really made Clown's gas meh for chases in that regard.
---
I‚Äôm rank 3 right now. I‚Äôm using Dead Hard, Iron Will, We‚Äôll Make It and DS. When you start going against purple rank Killers it becomes easier to rank up to be honest as they‚Äôre good enough at the game to not feel the need to tunnel and camp.
---
Dont have to be a Sociopath to hate people, humans do a good job of being garbage.
---
also what kind of game director doesn't play his own product the Steam where he went to korea to play against pros proved that he doesn't play his own game. One year of insta-blind flashlights till he played it then removed them 3 months later and the hag buff 5 months later
---
What about the killer that drops you next to the hatch and then closes it?
---
And yet another rule was added to the Entitled Toxic Survivor Rule Book.
---
Look it up
---
He can still delete pallet loops with them.
---
I was diagnosed lol. But yeah, we all suck.
---
Rank 1 survivor and I play solo 100% of the time. 
---
There really is no magical build. I swap between my Nea and Dwight. Nea has Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, Spine Chill, WGLF. Dwight has Adrenaline, We'll Make It, Balanced Landing, Decisive Strike. 
---
I just always make sure I am doing something and am never idle. It's very rare that I lose rank, I will at least black pip cause I'll survive long enough while kiting the killer, rescuing/healing, and doing gens. 
---
At rank 16, you should be able to pip even if you die.
---
That *would* be huge if being asleep actually did anything, they keep saying that the lullaby make is harder to notice him coming, but we all know that's bullshit, they were (again) afraid of making a strong penalty for survivors, they really should've though, waking up is easier than ever ...
---
Scott‚Äôs tots
---
Cause indoor maps are to small and not accepted by most of the community
---
Because I suck at killer so it hurts my pride less
---
I think besides lore, it's also a gameplay thing. Remaining asleep gives you the lullaby, which is harder to determine distance with (or even notice, often he's right ontop of he and I had no idea he was so close) compared to the TR heartbeat.
---
Toying with their mind just seems too similar to Play with your food. I really like on your knees. I feel like barbed wire would be better if it gave the survivor the broken status effect for 10/20/30 seconds. Not too sure about know your way around, I don't like it. Seems too similar to detectives hunch. Knack to survive seems pretty strong. Improving I like, but might need some numbers tweaking.
---
I think it‚Äôs because we deal with mostly out door maps
---
actually your right its 127
---
guess what behavior has?
---
It is prob that ya colour blind, I also cannot see scratch marks(tho I never could with any killer in the first place)
---
Well he went against people who play it every single day tryharding, when MC just plays it occasionally since he works on it. And we all know devs aren‚Äôt rank 1 players, maybe just a couple of them are really good but it‚Äôs totally normal since as a game dev you don‚Äôt have much time to play your own game. And btw, since they work on their game all day, it‚Äôs quite normal for them to get away from it, it would just annoy them in a long term
---
freddy mains rise up
---
This might be true. i indeed would enjoy indoor maps if well made
---
23rd.
---
&gt;The Nurse, Billy, and Spirit are the most viable killers for Rank 1 SWF matches which is just mindboggling because ITS BORING playing against the only killers at high rank that can actually be threatening so I  Depip just so I can see a different Killer.
---
I mean, you comment later in that same paragraph that "their \[sic\] is no point to rank up and just to face those Nurse/Spirits that will stomp you." So why on Earth would any killer at rank 1 seriously play any killer except the top 3 when if they play anyone else they get stomped? Why?
---
When I'm about to go on death hook, I just alt tab and look something up quick as opposed to watching Kate being sacrificed for a good 10-15 seconds. For me that's often when I'm most salty if I was having a really bad game.
---
This for the most part. While I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs the worst in the game, so many of the hits they gave him just doesn‚Äôt make any sense considering you can‚Äôt down people with FF anymore, and deep wound doesn‚Äôt decrease within the terror radius. 
---
The dumbest hit in my opinion was the loss of his power on a missed strike. I cannot even begin to think why that‚Äôs a thing. So what if you hit them again, it‚Äôs not gonna down them. In fact, it isn‚Äôt going to do anything at all. You still have to exit your power to do anything, which means going through that stun. 
---
Long story short, the balancing in this game is completely ass backwards at the end of the day. Not just with Legion, but in general. Killer, killer perks, and survivor perks get hit unnecessarily hard because the vocal majority bitch until
---
it happens. The developers alone don‚Äôt seem to know a thing about balancing at all really. Most of the balancing in this game is done with low ranks in mind. Name one other game where every balance patch is primarily decided by the lowest rank of its playerbase, I‚Äôll wait.
---
They look great, but again I feel like some are receiving more skins than the others. I'm still waiting for the Feng bunny hoodie... it has to be released one day, right? (Also I hope that when it launches it'll be able to get with iridescent shards, too many skins are money-only and it's getting really frustrating now.)
---
And when it does it‚Äôs pretty cool
---
It‚Äôs about 100
---
But considering it is split into multiple teams (people working on death garden, people working on the mobile version ecc..) they don‚Äôt have the same potential resources like warframe team.
---
And also 27 people can make a huge difference
---
I made a joke and got 46 downvotes wow
---
Top-tier shitpost
---
Well I just feel like everyone is good at killer except me because every killer I face at rank 6 gets at least 2 or 3 people. But then when i go against rank 15 survivors its just like nope , 4 man escape. I thought killers were supposed to have the advantage lol
---
Do easy bloodpoints count as fun
---
Oh fuck you had an opinion on this sub...
---
You brave, brave soul
---
You made Mr Bing Bong happy
---
I would like a university style campus map that is about 60% indoors, 40% outdoors. Indoor areas could include lecture halls, gymnasium, cafeteria, classrooms/labs, etc. Outdoor areas could be things like parking lots and sports fields.
---
He‚Äôs about as much fun as watching paint dry.
---
proportions
---
everyone that downvoted can't just see that this is ironic I guess
---
Why the decrease in bp? Really dont get it
---
\- dude gets unhooked;
---
\- he pretends to be a sandbag and lets you smack him;
---
\- he has protection from borrowed time, so he lets you hit him another time;
---
\- then he DSes you and runs away.
---
Only thought is "WTF?"
---
I do like your feedback a lot. How would you fix/change the other perks? I can always edit it with your help and maybe get this more noticed.
---
There are plenty of ways to counter camping unless it's leatherface.
---
&gt;actually need to die
---
Lmao
---
So a ghostface map?
---
gg ez
---
Ok calm down there angry killer main. You can pair this with some addons to make being asleep something bad, and falling asleep by default makes you able to be snared.
---
Its 160+ Look it up
---
It is?
---
Survivors need a peek that is good and also boosts the blood points their earn, just like BBQ
---
nurse has very rare addons that remove her blinks lol
---
I liked him the way he was because when you are colour blind and cannot see scratch marks the aura used to help me so much to point me in the right direction after I smacked a survivor and most of the time lost them.
---
I‚Äôm a rank 4 I was just messing around ;(
---
Bodalicious definition make em boys go loco
---
I'll be honest I have no idea what your asking, that they should play different killers or not to?
---
You bing binged them right into the dirt where they belong
---
They both can. Clown is still fundamentally worse because bottle recharge, Yeetability factor, lower quantity, window vault issues (Freddy pool animation denies window vault like doc shock).
---
use a broken addon, expect to get hate. Dunno why you think you're in the right.
---
Yop, only in some Countrys but you can download an App called tap tap (from Google) and with it you can download dbd
---
They're not great, but overall all the add-ons except blocks are acceptable, the block are utter shit though. 
---
-Sheep,Cat,Unicorn blocks are all useless, as they apply a status that hinders survivors outside of chase, even though the addons proc in chase (duh), if their timer was going down only while outside of freddy's terror radius they would be ok (same with Legion's addons, but he has even more worthless ones rn)
---
- Z block has a cool idea, but Hemorrhage is the worst status effect in the game, making it literally as bad as all the other blocks.
---
160? For real? They were about 100 just a couple of months ago wow, they‚Äôve been hiring a shit ton of new devs good for them.
---
I've legit been waiting for this.
---
Yeah, I only play solo. Started reset at rank 12 I think, hit rank 1 couple days ago. My build is sc, dh, we'll make it and ds. I'll always start a match and head straight for the nearest gen or if it's a map with a choke point (azaroths) I'll go to the other side where everyone hasn't spawned and work the opposite side. Chase and altruism are the biggest things to really focus on. Me personally, I'd rather die knowing I pipped than, escape with a black pip or a -1, so anybody hooked after the gates are powered I always go back for. Just save people and heal them up quick with we'll make it. Use dh to give yourself a couple extra steps to a pallet and extend a chase. Ds is pretty situational now, I hardly have to use it but I keep it on deck. Good luck
---
How about... 20/30/40 seconds

I guess so I tried to make it look ironic as possible since technically it is but hey what can you do

Not all heroes wear capes
---
So he kills my nightmares? So... he's.... the good guy?
---
Also I see what you are saying with toying with their mind but a lot of perks do similar things. Same things with know your way around. They might have a similar effect but have different uses. Maybe have know your way around activate when you finish a gen in the terror radius of a killer. And only show pallets and vaults. Maybe give you a short burst of speed.
---
Definitely Bubba. Without addons, his power is nearly impossible to use effectively against a survivor who has even a slight idea on how to play.
---
Claudette has so many good skins. Yet all I see are unimaginative Blendette losers.
---
but they focus on adding more content then fixing what's in the game already as they have only a couple fixes in this update but the bug where you walk out the gate and cannot escape has been in the game since the nurse update
---
Good job wiki writers
---
I really love this! The only thing I would say is Jane and Jeff are super skinny compared to in game.
---
I scared my cat by accident yesterday and I imagine this felt similar
---
he knew she was too far gone for shock therapy
---
You do realise that a killer's power (a part of it atleast, as we're talking about Freddy's dream world) should also do *something* without addons ?
---
Smol Myers
---
Something like Davy Jones? Or Ghost Pirate? Or Blackbeard?
---
‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you a little tall for a teenager?‚Äù
---
They note that they did tentatively try to fix it, meaning that they still don‚Äôt know the main cause but they might have figured it out. We gotta play once the patch is released and see if it still occurs
---
imagine ruining an entire game for 3 other people just because the killer is using an add-on you don't like.
---
For some killer players letting someone go is not uncommon and especially if they are running low on time before the End game collapse as a "will they make it in time?" Show
---
Since clown can reload his bottles whenever it isnt much of an issue at loops since he can just hit the survivor if they attempt to abandon. Freddys pool also doesnt cancel vaults.
---
Its more like a legion map i think
---
i mean to be fair, that hook save WAS a pro gamer move
---
No.
---
Because I'm easy game, easy go \~
---
Ranked high, ranked low \~
---
I've had an idea of a large indoor mall map with the survivor I've been thinking of. Doing gens could raise the metal gates in front of shops and allow more loops and mindgames for both sides.
---
ughh it hurts man it hurts when it happens :(
---
You're the kind of person that keeps this game fun
---
Ping:69420
---
This looks so satisfying.
---
Toying with their mind and Know your way around just need total overhauls imo. They're not unique.  
---
Knack to survive, well, avoiding hits as a survivor is probably one of the strongest perk effects possible. Just becoming injured isn't really too hard to do to activate the perk, and an insta-heal IN PLACE of a hit, let alone just avoiding the hit, is super strong. Personally, the way I'd have it, would be 'upon taking a hit that would put you into the dying state for the third time, you instead become broken for the remainder of the trial.'.
---
... that wasn't nice :c
---
Yeah, since you put a lot of effort to reach that gate and then you just die. Finding bugs like this is a torture and I know what they‚Äôre going through since I am a developer too. Tons and tons and tons of tests and searching and headaches and rage crisis. You can‚Äôt even immagine
---
The schizophrenic nature of these changes is really apparent. 
---
Which is it devs? Do you want people to hurry up and play? Or do you want people to linger around and make games longer?
---
The problem is that you could use an exhaustion perk, then get a stun for free. It prolongs the chase. If it was a "one and done" perk maybe, but people would complain about it being another pre-nerf DS get out of jail free perk.
---
How have you guys not fixed the pip update error yet...? I genuinely don't understand.
---
Fixed an issue that could cause the End Game Collapse timer not to be slowed when the last Survivor in the match was downed.¬†
---
Can we change this back? If youre the last person in the game and youve been downed, games over. Youre either about to crawl out, get hooked, or BM'd by the Endgame death. The timer not slowing down didnt really help or hurt each side, it just ended the survivors suffering quicker.
---
Outside of very specific circumstances like waiting on DS, in which case someone else is still in the game unhooking you, its just too much of a specific scenario to drag out the end. Just let me go.
---
Man how dare you not let him use his deadhard, just let him use his perk ya know? It's not like killer perks can be ever countered. Ahem spiritfury, totem perks, BBQ, or the other half of the perks lol.
---
It looks like a T-pose there.
---
Then let me put on my thinking cap.
---
we have broken sprint burst, broken blood warden, broken gen auras. seriously
---
It's broken. Same thing with Iri heads. There's basically zero counterplay and it's a waste of my time
---
I‚Äôm stealing this one, lol
---
Pretty punchable face indeed
---
I wonder why
---
it be nice if they use player feedback as bug test Wednesday or Thursday most of the bugs players put just seem to get ignored, and ayeyyeyeyeye sameem tryna be a game developer too but im somewaht rusteh
---
What? Did you say the n word?
---
They want to add BP for surviving time and some other things.
---
I was watching Tru3 earlier and survivors can pull a fake pallet but it vanishes. Idk about the snare
---
ik devs suck at balancing but when they actually put months and actual time and effort into their reworks they pull it off pretty well.
---
Soüëèüèªgodüëèüèªdamnüëèüèªstupid. 
---
Why the shits do they nerf a perk that doesn‚Äôt even work half the time because their hit regeneration is garbage
---
I let him.
---
Noed on Ghostface?
---
They don‚Äôt ignore it that would be dumb, they just put it somewhere and focus on already known problems. It‚Äôs like a reversed pile, the make the pile smaller by removing the old ones and at the same time the pile gets bigger because of new bugs
---
Um. The dream state doesn't slow down action speeds (without specific add ons) anymore, and the timer to get put to sleep is like a minute. Survivors can wake each other up, and the alarm clock increases passive sleep. I don't think hitting people is "OP" but I'm not a rank 20 survivor, so what I think doesn't really matter.
---
/r/hitboxgore
---
Well the game has like 4 pallets on it with no vision easily my least favorite map.
---
Anyway the game goes~ 
---
Doesn‚Äôt really matter to meeee~
---
To Me~
---
Yeah it‚Äôs saved me a 4K a couple of times. Survivors almost got door open. I didn‚Äôt have time to stalk them
---
You're complaining that you only see the same killers in matches at rank 1, then say that you depip just to go against different killers that also won't stomp you (translation: that they're easier for you to win against). My point is that you're a hypocrite; it has nothing to do with what killers should or should not play. 
---
My question to you is this: Why on Earth would any killer at rank 1 seriously play any killer except the top 3 when if they play anyone else they get stomped? They're not going to take the L and play a killer that does not have the proper tools to go against good rank 1 survivors just because you find going against the same killers boring. Much like you don't want to go against killers that stomp you, neither do killer players want to go against survivors that can stomp them without taking in the proper tools.
---

###Pre nerf: 75% boost to stun recovery rate
---
Math for stun duration: *(Stun Duration) / (Recovery rate)*
---
2s stun, 175% recovery rate AKA 0.75 increase to the base 1.00 recovery rate.
---
(3)/(1.75) = *1.714s stun*
---
###Post nerf: 50% Pallet stun duration reduction
---
3 - (50%*3) = 1.50s stun duration
---
No recovery buff, so 1.00 is default
---
(1.50) / (1.00) =  *1.50s stun duration*
---
New pallet stun duration is *supposed* to be 0.214s less than the previous, a small buff.
---
The Enduring change was written in the patch notes as a buff (0.214s) and on the perk as a buff towards pallet stuns but a nerf towards other stuns. 
---
**HOWEVER**, this is not the case. Pallet stuns seem to be lasting around 1.84 seconds now. This  is a 0.13 second nerf from before and 0.34 seconds slower than it should be. The perk description is not correct.
---
The real stun duration reduction seems to be about 39%. Even less than Rank 1 enduring says it is.
---
Remember Pearl's trip to New York lol
---
So i get punished for not getting caught? Sick.
---
Nice work man
---
&gt;Sick perk that gives double BP 
---
*WGLF*: Oh okay. Fuck me I guess.
---
Ugh that Tropy is a nightmare to get if you‚Äôre soloing. I managed to snag it last double bloodpoint event when a farming Piggy just let us do whatever after we gave her the eight hook points she wanted. 
---
Either way, nice work!
---
There will be as stated on the roadmap.
---
disconnect lol it screws the whole team, and the killer as well.
---
Also a killer main, as nice as this idea is in theory, it would never work because different people have different standards of what falls into the category of being toxic. The other thing is that sometimes the toxic thing to do really is just the smart thing to do at that moment - a survivor standing at the exit gate my be getting ready to bodyblock for a wounded team mate who might not otherwise make it, and a killer standing by a hook may be taking advantage of survivors not working on gens. Then there's the nebulous realm of deciding what's tunneling and what isn't, and you've got a whole new problem to deal with.
---
Beautiful
---
I mean I KNOW how he works, so there's a fun game of "alright, he stabbed me and I know there's like a 70% chance he'll leave me alone".
---
But to be honest, he's about as 'fun' as anyone. Very few of the killers have EXTRA fun than the usual fun.
---
That's a feature, not a bug - the devs made it so that you can't communicate in SWF. /s
---
IMO no mother needs a re-work and is a very low tier perk. Running no mither is in many ways just a challenge for the survivor using it. So yeah no mither works that way just because developers decided it would be too strong and being injured at the start is already an alert the survivor is using it.
---
*sips white russian* interestingg
---
^eeeeeee
---
How about a school map? The unique thing about it is there would be less pallets than usual, but more hiding spot than usual. For example, you can hide behind desks in the classroom
---
Lol people get salty because they Tbag at the gate, have many chances to leave but they end up dieing because they were rude, but they call you rude....just because some pig players are extremely good, and they know how to play by the objective(Killing), doesnt mean they baited you for dead-hard. Just learn how to use dead hard correctly. And those bills should've known that killer hitboxes are so broken that they would've gotten hit from afar anyway while using deadhardüòÇüòÇ
---
lol that would be comical
---
Impossible to get multiple head ons in a chase. Even a complete idiot wouldn't get stunned again in the same chase vs the same survivor.
---
I love how you went back regardless!
---
And you get the game on top of all of that
---
But you fucked up so good üòÇ
---
I don't think the entity's realm exists at a certain point in time so there's really no telling how long she's been in there. I might be wrong though.

Why are you downvoted all the way for making a joke but everyone else isn‚Äôt?
---
Some "leader".
---
The block add ons made me laugh, the brown one is better than the purple one. But seriously, a purple addon that gives hemorrhaging....are you fking serious?!
---
I also feel like if they get mad, say we bully them,  when they CLEARLY Tbag us, and heal infront of us, then they are painfully hypocritical, and entitled survivors :p
---
But thats how salty survivors get when they lose even tho they can just play another match and see if they get lucky. üòÇ
---
They'd get a non-directional warning they're within his teleport range, and if he picks their locker, he emerges from it automatically with them in a chokehold.
---
The state of this sub when you get downvoted for telling the absolute truth. The herd of yellow/green rank killers complaining about flashlights when in reality you as a killer should be glad when someone brings one. Out of items, only map is more useless. And then the guy agrees with you and gets upvoted (as he should) but the initial ignorance towards your comment is really infuriating because these idiots are the loudest and spam entire sub with "FlAsHlIgHtS oP". People bodyblocking while you're carrying a survivor? LITERALLY FREE HITS YOU DONKEYS. You won't see a single red rank killer complaining about this stuff.
---
Thought the same thing.

I almost feel like this could be a new copy pasta

I know, the nerve of some people countering things like pros, and not letting the survivors win,thats not nIcE-
---
Yep SWFs know how to do this really well. DS isn't as bad as it was before against solos, but it is annoying for sure against SWF who know how to use it.
---
It‚Äôs nice that the rework is actually giving Freddy his strengths. The whole point of Freddy is that he is immensely powerful but is very limited by rules to his power. Old Freddy has all the rules but none of the power which made him useless
---
A map where the survivors need to use their wit to survive, sounds fun.

No, it will be released sometime in the next three weeks. Most likely Dwight/Huntress this week, one Pig/Tapp set next week then the other Pig/Tapp set with the blue cop uniform the week after
---
Yeah even though thats the objective of the game. Dont let them get out, catch them and basically take home the gold. But survivors get salty bc we follow the objective of the game üò£üòÇüòÇ
---
He's only asking for buffs on the snares, because right now they suck.
---
to be fair, I think that's a cool effect. Just not "very rare" worthy imo.
---
That's from the End Game Collapse, when the hatch is shut or the gates are open the timer starts ro go down, when it ends the entity basically goes "fine I'll do it myself" and sacrifices them there. In this case he went down just in front of the exit line when it ended
---
Spirit, she's great, enjoyable and has good perks.
---
Got Cha it‚Äôs timer for the end of the round.. that‚Äôs cool though. Thanks for the reply
---
No Mither Huh?
---
Fools.
---
If you get baited for dead hard, you're a goat.
---
It makes sense in a way, but it is a penalty he has exclusively, which is super rude. And he could pick up his set traps more easily if he didn't get caught in them.
---
I hover around rank 4 solo and use a similar build (except I use bond in place of IW). Bad team mates often make me derank more often than killers from DCing and leaving me no chance, making horrible hook saves, not doing a single gen, etc. I would recommend to OP to remember to always be productive in some way (doing gens, healing others, saves, looping the killer) and they will likely at least black pip.
---
Newbs then?
---
Suggestion* idiot
---
Spirit by *far*. Unlike a few of the other Killers, it really feels like the sky's the limit playing as her.
---
I feel like if you waste dead hard, you‚Äôre an idiot.
---
Look into Feng Min. She has some nice perks that are easy to understand.
---
Friday 13th flashbacks
---
I feel like survivors make dumb ‚Äúrules‚Äù like this for the killer because they feel like they‚Äôre individually supposed to be on a level playing field with the killer. The game is balanced towards being 1v4, not 1v1.
---
Oh let me guess, your gonna say I‚Äôm toxic because I wouldn‚Äôt listen to your post?
---
If you DC for any reason that isn't the Killer straight-up hacking, you're kinda a bitch.
---
i still feel that way even after playing for over a year and a half, dont worry about all 4 survivors escaping, you just move on to the next game, i see players who've been playing since beta and still have rough games or matches with no kills.
---
Hello Mr. krinkle
---
I based it on the meme + Dwight sort of being the face of Survivors, but Jake is definitely a more evil person.
---
Right, but the killer obviously exploiting a broken addon is fair game lmao
---
Welcome to the game friend. Killer is unplayable now it‚Äôs so easy. I used to be a killer main but zero skill needed is zero fun to play. I understand you guys have been hand fed your entire life so you expect the same. It‚Äôs sad. I prefer to earn my kills and skills, not have them handed to me on a silver platter.
---
You haven't even touched upon the strongest perk in the game. This perk counters NOED, Devour Hope, Chainsaws, Green Vomit, Legion, Bloodhound and Slugging. No Mither really is too versatile. To balance this out, I think it would be a good idea to make it so that you are able to mori No Mither users without any pre-requirements other than downing them. Definitely upvote so BHVR sees this and can implement it in their next update
---
Excuse you
---
Completely agree. Surviving as a survivor and killing as a killer should at *least* guarantee you don't lose rank.
---
You mean Joey?
---
Isn‚Äôt that what you‚Äôve been saying to everyone else who disagrees with your post? Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong
---
If you can't understand why people would discuss killers at their base you're not really capable of having this conversation tbh.
---
If you know that you randomly have a massive advantage or disadvantage, winning and losing is much less about you, and therefore means much less if you don't know which you had.
---
But toxic people don't care about the context, so I fear we'd just get rage about losing a complete mismatch and mockery from winners of an utterly hopeless match.
---
Not to mention, if you get hit by head on, you'll make sure it doesn't happen again
---
I think it's Savage when I get gen grabbed. That's one thing I've never dc'd for. I gen grab with spirit without her prayer beads and so far everyone's been a good sport. I've only used them once but I think they heard all those yamaoka weeds rustling cause they had ran off Everytime I got to the gen.
---
Good job buddy.
---
It's not a nerf if you don't sprint out of a locker unless the killer is there. The "less bloodpoints for escaping" and stuff is the real head scratcher since I thought they were making survivor point potential closer to killers lol
---
It's more about timing, and they are both compatible in comparison.
---
Stun duration and missed attack cooldown are the same thing in practice. A timed pause before you can attack.
---
And if 30% is enough, then 50% is more than enough, with a huge margin of error that makes the comparison simple.
---
We didn't lose anything, on paper. If we lost the ability to take the stun and give a hit, then the perk is bugged and will hopefully be fixed.
---
So they need to make a Trapper dressed in red with slightly better mechanics?
---
I know you‚Äôre being facetious, but this actually genuinely sounds like something BHVR would say, especially after they just shit on a terrible meme perk.
---
Only when they‚Äôre clearly wrong and sound stupid, Maybe if you read it unbiasedly you‚Äôd take notice, Such a pity.
---
Hidey Ho! Has a few problems. Since it's a perk then every killer can use it, most of the killers as simply too big especially with their weapons to fit in one and even if they weren't how is the huntress supposed to refill on hatchets?
---
Yes, yes I do
---
Probably between 16-20 hours, depending on queue times.
---
What drug are you on
---
Absolutely, I agree. Just seems like (with no actual evidence or proof) there must be some things that can be agreed upon and implemented. Or if certain situations like the ones you mentioned can happen accidentally, they influence the rating less than "blatant" offenses? I dunno.
---
I just bought Jane for 9000 shards and put over 1000000 bloodpoints into her so I could get her perk as a teachable and then put some more bloodpoints into my Ace so I could get the perk on him
---
Timestamp might be nice
---
Jason got destroyed,had a good laugh from this.
---
except BBQ &amp; Chili has a very powerful side effect, while WGLF just gives BP
---
Yee
---
Idk, I see more GF than anything, hovering around rank 5-4. If I could get more exciting games I could tell if GF is good, but my teams are always boosted and the killers are just as stupid.
---
Being in a 1v1 VS GF, I can say he is the #1 most scary to face alone with a closed hatch.
---
It's a little complicated but why not both? Cooldown + a short exhaustion (15s) so you cant instantly sprint burst away after the stun.
---
I just tried that game and it‚Äôs hilarious how bad it is x)
---
Hey I built this app!  Thanks for your review!  Hope you are getting some good use out of it :)  I built this for that exact reason.  So glad that you are finding some cool builds with this.   Appreciate the post!
---
Poor Jason, I love that part too!

Chase starts at 3 min 32 second mark, lasts until the exit gate.  8 min video total length.
---
Eh, I‚Äôm sorry but half of these ideas sound absolutely ridiculous. Wraith is fine the way he is and does not need a nerf, Trapper does need a change since he is literally one of the weakest killers in the game but not what toy suggested, Freddy is getting reworked, the best thing I can tell you to against hag is just crouch and or find a flashlight, the only thing that really makes Myers op is tombstone, if your gonna do that to billy to it to LF which is already a very weak killer, and I really don‚Äôt know what to say about that nurse idea

Mother's Shrine sounds like a better version of Territorial Imperative.

---
So you can read what happens at the end of Legion's power and understand how it works. Because it's not free. It comes with a stun at the end and you lose information while it's in use.

Welcome back, on this episode of, ‚ÄúSalt by Daylight,‚Äù we have lucky contestant number one! So speak up chap, what makes you salty?

‚ÄúWell I tried to use dead hard, but it was a bait, and they hit me anyway.‚Äù
---
Have you tried, *getting good*? It‚Äôs this wonderful new perk where you learn how to play and stop relying on peer pressure forcing killers to play poorly because you‚Äôre bad! I recommend it to all the boys and girls of Reddit. That‚Äôs all the time we have for today, folks! And this was...
---
*audience shouts*

*SALT! BY! DAYLIGHT!*

Originally the idea was to make a no mither build and reach red ranks with it and part of that was sabotage. Sabotage is pretty worthless though and you're better off using a toolbox instead if you want to get rid of hooks.
---
I do like Lithe and the idea of Alert though.
---
I hate survivors
---
He's the only one I allow to boss me around. He points and I obey. Gotta have the beard though.
---
ion even know man
---
That's fair. I figured he still needed some kind of edge, but didn't even consider a Survivor might open his locker, so I hadn't thought to say that. Good idea!
---
Not interested in reading that bud, Try to narrow down to 3 or no characters, Preferably ‚ÄúNvm‚Äù or getting lost‚Äù
---
Much appreciated
---
Right survival is nothing compared to just touching some obj when it comes to pipping
---
No problem
---
This is a really in depth post, glad to see you actually put effort into this
---
Oh noooo that is pure heresy.
---
Everytime I see that pallet down I ask myself why is down already.
---
Spirit too op
---
This better means that David and Jake stuff are next in line.
---
What's wrong with that? We need better killers so we don't have to deal with Billy and nurse all the time
---
She literally looks like a disgusting greaseball but thats how she always looks
---
Absolutely
---
A gentleman and a scholar. Good day! :&gt;
---
I know how Legion's power works. I think you need to think about the mechanics of Legions stun. Every killer has a cooldown period after hitting a survivor. Feral Frenzy allows you to hit survivors without suffering from a cooldown animation, making is easy to follow them and then get as close as you can before cancelling the power and entering the stun. I personally see this as a positive because you not only get to choose when your stun animation ends, but you also do not proc a speed boost on the survivor. Mechanically, Legion doesnt gain a stun from from feral frenzy, he delays the stun that every killer gets after hitting a survivor.
---
I mean ya'll are licensed but I feel ya. Ya'll deserved old badass 2018 Laurie, hospital gown Laurie, and hell even H20 Keri Tate Laurie.
---
Not really, just beat her at mindgames, she's the best when it comes to them. If you outsmart, you won't be complaining anymore
---
Lmaoooooo
---
The only comparable thing I can think of that's fair is the Overwatch system, where people give out 'Team Player' and 'Good Sportsmanship' awards at the end of a match. That way there's no fighting over what the algorithm should reward or punish as it's decided by the players who were in that game. Probably easier to implement too as it wouldn't require tracking of inputs and game events. Maybe also tweak it so that people with lower reputations have less impact on the system.
---
I love this! It‚Äôs perfect!
---
He's getting a rework because he fucking sucks
---

Oh, no, no.

I got called "a fucking awful killer" told I "should go back to survivor" and thanked "for the free win, what a waste of time" by one dude on my first ever game as a killer.
---
You can't win reguardless of winning or losing apperantly.
---
Legion has an on-hit ability. M1 Killer is a term thrown around for killers who are denied using their power in chase or whose power doesn't harm survivors, so their primary method of hitting survs is getting looped and hitting M1. The M2 never comes into play. Hence "M1". Legion's power both harms survivors and could be used in a chase, but it is incredibly detrimental to use in chase. Therefore, playing them without the use of their power becomes preferable more than half the time you play as them.
---
This is gold
---
He really doesn‚Äôt
---
legions frenzy can help you track survivors, once you apply deep wound on a survivor legions Killer Instinct will activate which will show locations of nearby survivors who dont have deep wound applied to them, theirs also add ons that can show survivors locations from a farther distance, his frenzy can also be good to catch up to survivors to body block them from pallets or windows.
---
We can assume the other actions that give points will equal over 1000 if you play the game correctly, and if it does then I‚Äôm fine with it.
---
It incentivizes people to actually play the game instead of playing selfishly so you can escape.
---
Yep.
---
Not OP, but every survivor gets a stacking action speed debuff for each currently sleeping survivor, regardless if they're awake or not (I.E. if you're awake and all three allies are asleep, you'll take the debuff three times too). Also it's Very Rare now.
---
He got a rework because he was garbage. He sucked. Now he's good again and you're calling for nerfs, idk about you but I'm sick of Billy and nurse. You gotta figure out counterplay first before you call for nerfs.
---
Pretty much
---
Cool, and the upstairs window is still open? So that house is even safer for survivors now, even with the other door being closed.
---
Now this is an epic meme
---
Good to know where behaviors focus is
---
Black Box plus Dying Light
---
Not a nerf, go check the post I just made a couple minutes ago ü§°
---
Hey you found nockoff dbd
---
I think if nobody is within 8 meters of the gen, he should teleport instantly.
---
But they should increase the teleport time if someone is within 8 meters
---
What is the counter play for being pulled in half way across the map? If you get away and have nobody around to snap you out he can find you immediately and you also doing everything slower than a melting stick of butter rolling down a hill
---
How is it nearly every person complaining about the Head On change completely ignores the patch notes that come after the line that makes them shit their pants?
---
It literally talks about how the skill is now much easier to land and from what it looks like   this actually holds true.
---
Remember since doctors weakness is apple so don‚Äôt give him any since he‚Äôs a daddy XD
---
I‚Äôm Rank 1 P350 Legion too so I‚Äôm right. Did you get to Rank 1 with no perks or add ons btw
---
Yep and it's unblockable by the blindness status effect like jigsaw boxes and plague fountains.
---
Jake is just a loner tho, if anyone is evil it's meg.
---
Ngl was pretty easy to do for me
---
I am terrible. The most joy i get is from whipping hatchets at people. Just enjoy what you do and the rest is easy.
---
r/unexpectedwitcher
---
Omg that‚Äôs hilarious
---
When they call you bad
---
But that means they got killed by a ‚Äúbad‚Äù player
---
if something like that happened i'd buy darkness among us at an instant
---
Hope you get some better games in the future! 
---
Much love and gg &lt;3
---
I didn't say there was anything wrong with it.
---
They are and have been. This is not in anyway a NOED killer lmao, we only cleansed in case of NOED. NOED needs to lose its speed increase or unlimited exposure OR have a timer before it begins. All these killers out here camping only the latest hooked survivor until NOED kicks in smh.
---
I‚Äôd say something like it‚Äôs out in the open because the grass kind of obscures it, but that spot is actually cancer
---
I‚Äôm 13 and it‚Äôs true the kids acting they know everything and all the messages are painful too :P
---
Absolutely not
---
Good news for you, there‚Äôs an add-on that does exactly that.
---
Ok but what if you think they have devour?
---
Played the Dude card on him.
---
Its amazing üòÆ
---
(He needs some vaseline on them elbows xD)
---
This, a million times this. I love spirit!
---
He definitely wasn‚Äôt the worst killer in the game I have no idea where you got that from his power is way to good dude. I‚Äôve gone against 4 Freddy‚Äôs in the past 3 days using perks to drop their terror radius down to 2 meters combined with his power he‚Äôs ridiculously strong
---
ngl I feel it too...
---
1. The perk opens up the back of the locker in a kind of portal to the basement, so there's room.
---
2. Two buttons.
---
It looks broken, but it isn‚Äôt. Trust me. I just made a post and I hope it opens your eyes
---
If a Freddy has slower progression add-ons you probably will want to wake up with failed skillchecks
---
Unless your team is a pair of dipshits
---
I sent this to my boyfriend and [got this gem in return](https://imgur.com/a/AHNeevg)
---
Yeah, how dare you not stand still in the corner so that we, the true heroes of this game, can rush the gens and flashlight you freely! Toxic fucks like you are ruining this game. /s
---
tbh from what i've seen of hexy's stream, current rework of freddy is actually well balanced, no buff needed.
---
That‚Äôs a add on in his base kit there‚Äôs no point in leaving dream world
---
Okay did that, also double-checked the file to make sure vsync was still false, but it doesn't seem to be working. Still 60 fps in-game.
---
Unbalanced does not show something with too much power. Old Legion was unbalanced because he had no counter play but without some good add-ons or use of the exploits no one would call him overpowered.
---
What about the snairs? There really weak
---
Yes there is, the more people in the dream world, the quicker his gen teleport recharges, and when you‚Äôre in the dream world, you are affected by dream pallets and snares. Making loops much more difficult.
---
Even then, killers just swing. If the survivor jumps out and is downed there is no stun.
---
Hexy said snairs &gt; fake pallets.
---
Mori'ing in the exit gateway is the best part of this game.
---
Nice Jake outfit.

Stop. Not all kids are like this, can you imagine if you were a kid and whenever your peers did something stereotypical you and your friends start getting bashed? You can't pull the stay in your zone card because the kid zone is rather small and you only get bashed harder for being in the kids zone as a Kid, and when the people who belong in the kid zone go in the "adult zone" the kids who belong their get bashed. I get this isn't to be taken seriously but just be a little understanding please?
---
So guys, we did it. 
---
How, you must be the entity.
---
Lol you have 5 seconds to get away from the gen also dream pallets and snairs are cool but if you know how to loop they won‚Äôt really affect you
---
I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd even do that. I made them myself, so I only have the skins themselves as pictures.
---
You gonna be posting all the new ones ?
---
Ooff that stings. People have a hard enough time with survival points. It doesn't affect me much thoigh because I never get to escape.
---
Definitely leatherface for his perks. BBQ is such an amazing perk for both grinding and just play in general. Franklins is also pretty strong against bully squads with flashlights.  
---
My second choice would probably be Of Flesh and Mud. Hag has some pretty good perks - I love devour hope and ruin is super strong. Third seal is okay. Ace's perks aren't necessarily the most powerful but they have some good utility, in particular ace in the hole is good when combined with plunderer's.  
---
Thirdly... Spark of Madness might be good, mostly for the doctor and his perks.  
---
Generally survivors have a pretty strong perk pool without dlc. Most of the strongest perks for them, such as borrowed time, dead hard, adrenaline, etc are baseline. For killers, a lot of their perks are tied to dlc killers. And given that different killers unlike survivors actually change the gameplay based on your choice, I'd strongly recommend buying dlc based on the killer instead of the survivor.
---
I do have an idea of why this happened. I was awarded BP for completing games for the DBD PTB vanilla test. Maybe these awarded BP's did not count towards the 1 mil BP cap?
---
Whoa, this is one of the best concept of a killer that I‚Äôve ever seen on here tbfh. I kept hearing people saying they wanted Jason in the game, but never knew how he‚Äôd be able to work, like with his power and all, but this is actually super awesome and in depth. Well done! üòå
---
I mean, this happens once, twice and then you should know better than to fall for it again... either slug him if you think he has ds or go after someone else, if they force themselves into you it means they're not on gens which is a plus for you. It's honestly so easy playing around it.
---
You should watch tru
---
How long have you been playing?
---
The Jeff and Kate skins are Must Haves for me.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Is there anything you think is too strong? I'm always open to criticism.
---
In the coming days, I'm going to add the Survivor for this chapter concept. It's going to be Whitney from the 2009 movie as well.
---
Also, I went and edited the formatting to be easier to read.
---
If a particular survivor used Deadhard earlier in the match, next time they're injured and you're confident you'll get a hit, don't swing right away. Drive forward as much as you can into their rear bumper and make them think you're about to hit them. They'll use Deadhard and then you can swing risk free right after.
---
Pls god pls no
---
Its a sad day when a brown add-on is significantly better than a purple add-on.

Suppose this is the devs way of trying to make bloodhound meta for Freddy.

Jesus christ, its jason bourne
---
Hasn't the ptb been out for like 2 days. How long do people think it takes to get used to a killer
---
I took a 6-8 month break from the game and I feel refreshed and dont get angry anymore. Maybe try that
---
Bwaaaaaaaa haaaaaaa haaaaa haaaaaaaaa I trust my barber.
---
I like my food the way I like my survivors.
---
Kidney stone-inducing levels of salty.
---
I have NOED available to most of my killers but I have never used it. Seems too easy of a perk and I have had it used on me a lot. Its tempting on certain ones, like Freddy when he already has to pull someone in the dream state, and then 1 or potentially 2 hits before they get out, especially when so much of his own perks are built around the end game
---
I'd like to see David and Jake training Mewtwo and Giratina.
---
So on the second day you played, you had the teachables from 4 different killers on Myers all at tier 3? Do you honestly expect me to believe that? Why even lie? That's just pathetic.
---
And I have a enormous amount of hate,because that usually means a Derank.
---
You can do it! 
---
Just have fun and ignore idiots who tell you you suck.
---
The snare makes lots of bloodied arms reach out at the survivor when triggered.
---
You didn't reaaaally expect to pip with mori and what it looks like 4-5 hooks now, did you?
---
I watch both guys actually. True is usually on during morning/early afternoon, while hexy is more during evening.
