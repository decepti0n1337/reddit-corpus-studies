Then why did you downvote me for saying that I was honestly trying to understand what you meant? That was kind of lame and I was just calling you out for it. Anyways, thank you for finally explaining what you meant by your original comment.

Oh heck

Than I'd just level them all up for teachables and save shards for cosmetics.
---
Woah that‚Äôs smart
---
Your scarousal will get me to EW3 üíÄ
---
I wish. It‚Äôs for 4 days at the end of the event.
---
The thing is you need 4 random survivors who don't have a weak link and who manage to do saves without wasting time.  I'll take those odds a survivor any day.
---
All the ones I have scene on Amazon were like knock offs kinda and the images didn‚Äôt look to great. I surprised I didn‚Äôt see that one.
---
I read the first perk, and No.
---

---
&gt; Hope - this perk should also apply the Deep Wounds effect if hit instead if going down.
---
There are enough 2nd chances as it is, this is pretty much Old MoM but for end game (when it was mostly used) without requiring to get hit.
---
All of the other surv perks are fine.
---
&gt; Hex: Thrill Of The Hunt - this perk should also apply a 0-1-2% haste effect for each token. (just cleanse dull totems or the hex totem to make the killer slower again)
---
This would be pretty controversial, 10% increased speed at the start of the game is huge as hell. 
---
Other 3 killer perks are fine imo.
---
&gt; Run and Gun
---
This is just a situational sprint burst (like balanced) but without a passive. I'd just run Sprint burst and control my exhaustion to time it.
---
&gt; Walk it off
---
This should be 5/10/15 cause 30 seconds is a long time considering it is dead by daylight.
---
&gt; Second Chance
---
Another hook state is just too strong, 4 hooks to kill is stupidly op for survs.
---
&gt; Wiggle Out
---
Just a variant of Boil Over
---
&gt; Pasify
---
If you hit a survivor, chances are they are just gonna run and get to another loop, and after 10 seconds, they are already able to drop another pallet.
---
&gt; Tripwire Hooks
---
Surge is just a better version of this.
---
All of the other perks I don't see any issues with.
---
wait how did you get 2 killers ?
---
Yeah? Why?
---
do more totems, chest, sabotage, chase, escape. basically u need bold point, because u play stealthy with spine chill, u can do sabotage and totem to get bold points
---
The guy with the flashlight was annoying  otherwise not really
---
Yes. Just giving my opinion
---
Well given how the legal age in japan is 14 (i think dont quote me on that)
---
Look up next time mate
---
It used to be like that but they changed it.
---
This is the one right [here](https://www.amazon.com/Trick-Treat-Studios-Saw-Pig-Multi/dp/B00K88JNGQ/ref=sr_1_17?dchild=1&amp;keywords=pig+mask&amp;qid=1571615599&amp;sr=8-17)! It is 62$ but I love it!
---
Wait, it‚Äôs 14 in JAPAN?!
---
Well damn, I‚Äôve got some people to apologize to..
---
I never understood why people watch Nascar until now.
---
No absolutely not.  His actions didn't cause an "equal and opposite" reaction.  Your response was disproportionate.  
---
What you did was bodyblock him into a corner and hold his game hostage.  If it were any other killer this would have resulted in a ban if they recorded and reported you.  You got off on a technicality because you played the one killer whose power creates a countdown timer meaning it technically isn't holding the game hostage.  Any other killer you'd have violated the games rules with this petty display of bm.  
---
You do not get a pass on this just because you played killer.  It was scumbaggery on level 100.
---
Budding killer mains. I play almost exactly 50/50 killer survivor. 
---
Do not spend this much time on a Chase especially if you have not hit that particular survivor yet. 
---
This game is all about applying pressure as a killer. Right now you have 3 survivors doing gens and totems unchallenged.
---
Hope, Plunderers, and We'll make it dont need reworks, they're fine as is and serve their purpose well
---
Walk It Off and Pacify sounds broken.
---
Not every perk needs to be meta, many that people don't use have a purpose in certain builds. Theres def some that need help but they're not the ones you listed except maybe Slippery
---
&gt;violating the Hingle McCringleberry rule, there is a good chance they get re-downed.
---
&gt;
---
The what now?
---
From a balance perspective its sorta iffy but i think it should stay as it is now. However from a reality perspective it makes 0 fucking sense that it isnt directional
---
That's a feature of the iridescent king: Survivors can't drop pallets once inflicted with madness.
---
Yes please
---
To be honest I never was so excited for a dlc or mid chapter in my life
---
It used to be that way, and they changed it. If you hear her, just start looking around. It's not that hard.
---
They got fuckin clobbered
---
Yes my friend
---
Fornite bad
---
I just put on my totem build, it slows the game down a bunch, and since I‚Äôm using legion, it guarantees no gens done after 10 min, at least most of the time
---
Totems are for lightbringer, Not for the bold emblem? Or am I mistaken?
---
Sure but it'll cost you breaking every other sound for at least a week before it's possibly fixed or not.
---
Honestly I hear way more bitching from survivors than I ever do from killers
---
Very true

Yeah, the "Getting your money back" argument is debunked in a very similar way to the dumb fucking cosmetic pricing argument where someone would aggressively shout "ITS NOT 15$" about a 1188 AC cosmetic set when you can't directly buy a specific number of Auric Cells, so I'd still have to buy 15$ worth of Auric Cells. I'm still down 15$, and 412 Auric Cells will get me one piece of a cosmetic set that probably won't match everything else, and leave me with 12 permanently useless Auric Cells because of wack skin pricing.

3 Survivors dead with trapdoor closed as Nurse:
---
‚ÄúTrU3Ta1ent: ‚ÄúIs this geeg?‚Äù
---
As a console (ps4) player I can say, I have gone out of my way because if salt. (Mainly when killer intentionally tunnel. I can tell they tunnel when they see me and the one who unhooked me and literally runs past them when they are closer to the other and still comes after me. Like come on man I'm trying to have fun and enjoy the game but that kills it for me and it happens more often than not)
---
Oooooh, I get what you mean now
---
I haven‚Äôt had this problem because I don‚Äôt have friends
---
Persist! We are the good folk who encourage team play in a not so nice place!
---
My point is that the meme isn't relatable since legion isn't a strong pick people use against SWF. Would make sense with nurse or spirit.
---
I would be the first one on a hook so people like you will start working on gens.
---
It only affects a few killers, a majority of them will still be susceptible to OoO and even the stealth killers will be visible when not meeting the undetectable condition in their kit. I.E. Uncrouched pig will be visible to OoO. I feel like this brings the perk more in line with perks like TOTH being a double edged sword that can secure games or be abused by the other side albeit with a more limited range than TOTH which can be abused by any survivor where as OoO can be abused by only a few killers.
---
Its a joke dont worry my guy
---
Had a trapper ritual, so I played him some! I only have him at level 5 but I was careful with trap placement and I managed to trap people like 6 times (although something like 4 of those were with the same trap over and over - people didn't check the door of killer shack). I'm pretty proud of myself!
---
It‚Äôs not weird when it‚Äôs intentionally made to look sexy
---
Yeah, but it wouldn‚Äôt really be a big enough incentive for the survivors. They take 14 seconds to cleanse as-is. If they‚Äôre gen rushing, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd stop to look for totems. *Maybe* they‚Äôd stop and do one that they see (that they wouldn‚Äôt do otherwise), but I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôd move the needle.

Please tell me this isn‚Äôt satire and you typed this fully seriously.

Just a question: If I look in the direction of a stealth killer such as crouched pig, if I can't see her, can she see me?

There are event gens and hooks still but as far as we know the only thing it does is give bonus bloodpoints

It's not animations, it's the hitboxes themselves. They will always be a problem as the devs want it this way. These hits have always been like this since vaults got updated.

Oh
---
Must have been a high ping match.
---
Edit: hitboxes are definitely busted though.
---
No joke that would be a sick perk...but definitely have it be like 3/2/1 more gen and only 1 that can explode per trial, because sinking 80+ seconds into a gen only to have it blow would suck but be bearable, three times--which is FOUR MINUTES of potential time wasted--would be literally broken at lower ranks since randoms already suck at doing gens.
---
Add Ruin and--assuming it doesn't die in the first few minutes--you have 2 minutes into a gen that doesn't even count, it'd be bananas (unless they are so insanely lucky they manage to fix every single gen except the trapped one).

‚ÄúLike that‚Äôs ever gonna happen.‚Äù

Do y‚Äôall still think this shit is unbalanced? üòè

I wouldn‚Äôt do a 5/4/3. That would make it benefit survivors more at the first two ranks of the perk. If it was 3 and 1/2/3 I think this would actually be a really interesting perk.
---
Lol, I hate those survivors, I had one message me that I‚Äôm a baby because I didn‚Äôt save him and saying that this is a ‚Äúteam game‚Äù he died the first 2 minutes of match, and the killer went straight to me, so I‚Äôm like ‚Äúok, gotta get chased for a while, I can get him later‚Äù NOPE, I got chased for more than 30 min, and no shit he died on hook cause my other teammate was doing a gen and the other one dc‚Äôed, I don‚Äôt know how am I supposed to help my team if I‚Äôm getting chased lmao, toxicity these day is crazy

Way too stick like to be a pig. You should try wraith. That way you can just post pictures of the forest and tell us you‚Äôre out there.
---
Seeing how hitboxes are made. Its not the animation. Most hitboxes are done in cubes or triangles aor an ombination of both. They dont always follow the character models outlime but instead create an area of collision a few inches out and spikes in lag or delay causes them to not move quick enough
---
Just call me Jimmy Neutron.

Isnt this just a pixelated repost of someone elses art?

My impression precisely. As it's a new game, many survivors are not at that good level yet.

---
Ye
---
I swear to God the ping was green. Betwen green and yellow ping stuff like this never happen, and i can say if the game was laggy or not earlier
---
Tunneling against good survivors is basically asking to lose. Good survivors will still do gens and escape while maximizing your time on the hook. Killer is more per-occupied killing you while the 2-3 others are busy on gens. 
---
If the killer stuck you on the hook then went to get the other survivors. You'll, usually, get saved which requires another person then you'll likely will be healed. This whole process of save/heal wastes a ton of gen fixing time which is good for the killer to allow them to put more pressure to regress/chase. 
---
So a killer tunneling is, usually, shooting himself in the foot while also making it a "unfun" match for the tunneled survivor. The bad part is that not everyone prioritizes time on gens when new to the game so you end up being farmed/tunnelled while you teammates run around like fools wasting gen time making it worth it for a killer to tunnel. 
---
At higher ranks, tunneling may net you 2 kills against good survivors or it may waste your time more if the one you're tunneling is a great juker. So you need to prioritize when it's best to break a chase to go back to getting people off gens.
---
Noed on Billy. Big brain
---
just because the ping is good when you enter the match doesn‚Äôt mean something can‚Äôt go wrong somewhere along the way. It‚Äôs just a fact that isn‚Äôt a hitbox issue. Hitboxes are a fixed size. You can argue some are too large like healing hitboxes, but this just wasn‚Äôt a hitbox.
---
I genuinely don‚Äôt understand what people like you think hitboxes even are
---
How do you expect "play the game" when you use those combination on purpose because you know the other side won't have fun and will likely suicide?

 You can't play the game when all 4 suicide on first hook/dc in 40 sec in a match.

Dedicated servers mean it doesnt matter if your ping is good, if the killer has bad ping then its still gonna be laggy af

Remember everyone its not about winning its how youbplay the game. Games are meant to be fun if we win once in a while thats ok. Fun is more important so what if you dont escape. So what if you dont get a 4k. Winning is only a small part of the game and we shoudl appreciate all the funny times we have killed someone and all the funny times wehave been killed by sometimes. Games are about making memories not about a win loss ratio

Just make it a hex that multiplied by 1.25 1.6 2. It would take more time to look than it would to open so

Pretty much this,  I play both sides.  Yet when I play survivor I feel pretty fucking guilty when 3 gens pop by the time a low tier killer finishes a standard chase cause he didn't have ruin/ it blew up immediately. 
---
I play killer, and I feel pretty bad when i'm forced to down someone who got farmed so the farmer doesn't get points and rank up. I also feel bad having to slug the 1 I keep finding because the other guy is jumping between lockers all game waiting for the other to die or finish the last 3 generators alone

How do you even get more than one killer in a match?
---
haha outplayed
---
seriously, though. all killers have the same exact hit range regardless of their weapon. if this were a hillbilly swinging at you, it would have made a lot more sense. but since it was a legion it looked off. combine this with latency from dedicated servers and you can seemingly get sniped by clown knives, legion knives, freddy gloves etc.
---
the best counterplay would probably be to just assume they have the range of a hillbilly

Freddy is a fun and decently effective killer, whether you're using Snares or Pallets. Me, I like pallets, because I always enjoy that "Gotcha" moment when a survivor slams a Dream Pallet and eats a claw to the face. Kinda like when a survivor vaults a window onto your bear trap as Trapper.

Survivors can slowdown the killer by tagging a part of their body or something

In my mind it's a mix of freeze tag and Lazer tag in maybe 10-15min games

Or just accept its a game and that people are assholes online and just embrace it.

It's not about simply not playing the other side BMing or tunneling and all that is frustrating and makes you angry at the group in its entirety. The problem isn't that their mains is that the community is very toxic and the way the game is by forcing you to lose because of the actions of that other player the killer or just four the survivors is frustrating

---
They're four of them if they lost that's sad
---
As a survivor Franklin's is the perk I hate most as a killer I love it
---
Could work better on clown seeing as it‚Äôs toxic gas
---
Wanted to have some fun while taking photos! No problem!
---
Doctor mains will get mad at you for posting this
---
Fun means different things to different people. For some people the fun is in winning.
---
TL;DR?
---
This new killer is OP, he stole my toolbox then dropped it in a lake
---
I think the new purple is actually going to be as good as the old, and better in some fringe circumstances. Having endurance protects you from chainsaws, Devour Hope, etc. where the health state doesn‚Äôt. And since the syringe is now a delayed heal, they have to bargain on which insta you ran. If they guess wrong, you get an extra health state with the pink, or an extra 15 seconds to run. I think this is still a hard nerf to syringes, but I‚Äôm generally okay with that.
---
This sub has a pretty obvious killer leaning and DbD's playerbase is definitely not 4:1 survivor mains to killer mains
---
At least you‚Äôre an honest asshole :) 
---
(Not trying to be mean by the way)
---
Then i thinl they are the real losers. If youd rather lose everything to win then whos the real winner
---
I love when they Tbag at the gate and you have Hex: No One Escapes so you down then and carry them away then can mock them
---
Most killers I run into just slug you in that case. Except spirits, spirits will mori you if given the opportunity.

PC: Trapper is unable to vault windows with a trapped survivor on the other side. Additionally trapper can now step into his own traps immediately after placing, instead of having a period of time where he is immune to his new trap.

I wanna know more too, hell we don't even know if they're a guy or a girl or what
---
Was rewatching a game vs a streamer from his perspective earlier. 
---
"Of course she has ruin".
---
He was running borrowed time, unbreakable, balanced landing, adrenaline.
---
YES IT'S HOT GARBAGE
---
All I know of them is from what I've read in-game. It sounds to me like theyre a survivor who somehow managed to escape the fog and left behind notes and research to help others.
---
Lmao why'd you put tape on it?
---
You're actually not wrong. I would bet money most people who get offended by teabagging or "toxicity" as they like to use are also the same type of players. I would seriously bet money on that.
---
Probably not, but hey, take what you can get amiright?
---
*HONK HONK*
---
be nice to killers. i hate playing as killer to see someone t-bagging a pallet that they threw down prematurely.
---
Nah I get it. I play a bit dickish sometimes and if someone calls me out for it I understand completely
---
I‚Äôve also been experiencing difficulties hitting people. It‚Äôs like 369ing but much easier. Probs because of auto-aim
---
I just tbag back as ghosty to try and make friends, it worked once :)
---
Yeah I agree, there should be a shotgun on the map and any survivor can use it on the killer. Once used, the killer died and everyone wins!
---
/s
---
*throws 4 pallets in a span of 5 seconds then ferociously t-bags*
---
Simple but I like it :)
---
Lol
---
Then either buy it when you have hit the tier your comfortable with or, and I'm sure this will blow your mind dog, you dont buy it and it doesn't effect your gameplay at all

I really have no issue what people think after context is given, it's the internet after all you never know 100%! The part that got to me the most is "every female cosplayer" like holy shit that is messed up.
---
You got this idea from dead meat didn‚Äôt you
---
Legit when a dlc comes out, I just pass on the next time I want to order out or something.
---
I love it, only critique I have to offer is I would prefer the cuts on the mask to actually be into the material and now just painted on.
---
With that said it is fantastic overall.
---
Dude I would if I had the funds ;-; I did this as a special add on for my 12 hour stream on Halloween for my community and tbh I never had this much fun in awhile over making something.
---
Power seems horrible it could be tuned to be a lot better. Survivors don‚Äôt worry about being blind for the most part. 
---
Also due to my love of Pinhead they should save the engineer for him due to one of his movies of him being called The Engineer.
---
Perk 1. Could be scaled to not be op but it seems very op especially on Michael with M&amp;A
---
Perk 2. Just a no.
---
Perk 3. Also a no. 
---
Perks shouldn‚Äôt be on a timer to due something at least in my opinion.
---
NOED only activates if you failed to kill fast enough that the survivors got their goal. It‚Äôs not earned.
---
Niiiiiice. That was fucking satisfying.
---
That's kinda the point...and no one would waste a perk slot for it. The whole point is that the base game already goes by at lightning speeds.
---
There‚Äôs no ‚Äúwinner‚Äù or ‚Äúloser‚Äù, it‚Äôs personal preference.
---
In the same way that you find it meaningless to focus on winning, these people will find the game meaningless if they‚Äôre not trying their hardest to win.

Dead by daylight 2: Hillbilly Drift

It‚Äôs more accurate than Adrenaline, yes.
---
No real horror mythos about him but maybe a character labeled ‚Äúthe crooked man‚Äù?
---
The only other option would be to increase the time to 10 seconds per totem, but that seems a bit overkill considering there are only 2 exit gates and it would be easy to bounce between them with that much extra time. I was trying to base it on old Remember Me.
---
Almost has a Resident Evil vibe to it. Looks sick.
---
Theres a difference between trying and feeling like shit
---
The game currently suffers with a lot of killers feeling panicky and stuff because they feel like they have to do x y z just to please survivors.
---
Survivors then shit on them for one fuck up. Even though they still escaped
---
Google something like "[Ban reasons DBD](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system)" and laugh in their faces when they threaten to report you.

‚ÄúOk, nothing to see here, this person clearly has no idea how the game works‚Äù
---
I see that! Thank you!
---
I think think they want you to be able to spam click grab. That's why doctor is good at facecamping because he can go into his shock from and spam click attack and he will insta grab anyone that trys to unhook. the survivor cant fake out saves on him
---
Sounds interesting, could be really cool if done correctly. Thanks for sharing your idea
---
I'm calling it this now. I forgot all about that skit from them lol

Honestly surprised no DC with prayer beads

I love it, me and my mates have an awful survivor rate on it, generally one escapes but we get so into. It

It's so fun! Lots of neat rooms. Cozy

If you‚Äôre talking about how some Killers worry about what‚Äôs bad manners and what‚Äôs not, that‚Äôs a separate issue from winning / losing.
---
In fact, I daresay that‚Äôs a problem that applies more to fun-conscious killers than victory-oriented killers.
---
&gt;&gt;Survivors then shit on them for one fuck up. Even though they still escaped

This is also a matter of bad manners, not winning / losing.

---
Nah, that‚Äôs not tunneling though (though there are toxic survivors who will falsely accuse a killer of tunneling just because they‚Äôre no good at staying hidden.)
---
‚ÄúTunneling‚Äù is when a killer finds a group of 2/3/4 survivors and deliberately ignores most of them to focus down the one who‚Äôs already been on a hook.  It‚Äôs the killer who is able to get back to the hook before the rescuer and rescuee make a full getaway and make the choice to ignore the rescuer (the person who made the mistake of an unsafe rescue) to put the rescuee (who had no control)  back on the hook.  It‚Äôs the killers who find a survivor being healed after escaping a hook and chooses to ignore the healers to tunnel the one being healed.
---
Tunneling ruins the game for one player while also giving almost no benefit to the killer.  And yeah, you get survivors who will accuse a killer just playing the game of tunneling, but I don‚Äôt think anyone who can apply critical thinking is gonna deny that there are toxic killers and toxic survivors who are going to accuse others of toxic playstyles when it‚Äôs not really accurate.
---
I just watched the VOD. He lost because he made too many mistakes in chases and put himself in a situation he couldn‚Äôt recover from. The build isn‚Äôt god tier, but it certainly isn‚Äôt bad and it isn‚Äôt the reason he didn‚Äôt get any kills. He pretty much spent the entire time complaining because he didn‚Äôt have Stridor to carry him against the Iron Will users.
---
Some yes
---
Did you read any of my responses?  I fully acknowledged that what he did WOULD HAVE been holding the game hostage and reportable for said bodyblocking had he not been playing Pig.  I also already specified that he gets away with it on a technicality due to her trap forcing a countdown timer to force a death.  You literally went out of your way to spell out what I already acknowledged and specified previously.
---
The devs never intended the Pig up be able to body block a survivor to death to exploit her power mechanic.  Stop trying to legitimize it.  It was an oversight on their part.  And again doing what he did was not an equal and proportionate response to teabagging.  He should have just teabagged or nodded aggressively after downing them maybe even camp them for being douches.  But what he did was absolutely I defensible and not okay.  Again if he was literally any other killer it would have been holding the game hostage and bannable.  But he gets off on a technicality due to her ability.
---
Pretty sure the devs just keep saying they dont know how to make it work in game and are looking into it every time they are asked about it lmao
---
Literal pallets would work, as for windows, maybe have some displays that you can jump through?
---
Doesnt the battle pass return you what you paid at the final reward as a incentive to keep playing?
---
Unfortunately I've never met anyone who uses blood warden, so where as in that situation it might be useful, it's a very rare occurrence.
---
#*Oinks menacingly*
---
I love gideon's! It's one of my favorite maps
---
I used to watch him back when dbd came out, he didnt complain too much then but maybe I just didn't see it. I watched him coz I like his voice lol.
---
Awesome cosplay! Boop the snoot!
---
Good idea, or maybe counters to try out food kind of thing would work too
---
At this point no one should have an option to back out. Gotta go old school and physically pull the pull of you want to be a tool and quit
---
He complains about swf a _lot_ and does complain about other things a good deal, but if I played the game as much as he does I‚Äôd probably complain a bit too. He does have good advice and has good criticisms at times, it‚Äôs just not the content for everyone.
---
Yeah you right. Why the fuck Legion gotta break their fucking wrist everytime they try to slice you.
---
This is another one when theres two survivors left and four or five gens left and they hide forever to try and force the killer to DC out of sheer boredom and annoyance.

Yes, give her a nuke and make her attach them to survivors heads.
---
When shit like that happens makes me wish we had a perk to down other survivors.
---
I‚Äôve been doing the same thing, and I‚Äôve been getting the same kinds of responses! I couldn‚Äôt play killer for the longest time because first-person usually makes me nauseous and dizzy. But I‚Äôve been pushing through lately and have enjoyed being killer. I‚Äôve found the lobby wait times are less than a minute compared to those when I‚Äôm survivor, when I seem to wait five plus minutes lately.
---
Playing into my hand? What? Lol I don't really need attention or anything, and lets say the crop top was on purpose, it's a belly, not tits or ass out better than a bathing suit you see at a pool. I don't affect anyone in anyway negative way by posting this and was just someone proud of something I did for a first time. I honestly was extremely anxious just posting this over a stomach showing. After encouragement from friends I did knowing I be "shamed" over a fictional character cosplay. I can understand how you feel and I get it, but in all honesty let women and men be whoever they want and how they want. It harms nobody and it is a way to be creative and have fun! I'm sorry if I offended you in any way at all or made you disgusted or uncomfortable, I really hope you have a wonderful day and can understand  my view point as I did yours! ‚ù§
---
My main problem is how they keep focusing on putting out new content without fixing any of the shit in the game that's already there. Bullshit and overpowered perks, killers that are completely nonviable beyond rank 10, broken mechanics, things everyone's been complaining about for over a year that aren't being dealt with. That's my problem with BHVR, and while they're making good progress with the newest patch it's nowhere near the fixes that still need to be made.
---
which is dumb, because if the killer is just standing around watching someone on the hook, that's free gen time.
---
Now I want an scp killer. I don‚Äôt know who it would be, but I want it.
---
On that note, I also want a slender man asymmetrical horror game. I just want to play as some unknowable horror and eat baby dweets.
---
I had Botany and We'll Make It. In the time it took them to run the 16 meters to hide behind a rock I could have healed them twice at the hook.
---
She looks just like nea...
---
I mean my point is that you can be 100 feet below the window, animation will still make u get hit, i belive same now how broke deadhardis , got some clips of hit with exhaustion on start of dh , and it feels like u get hit only because the animation didn't started :O
---
It might be a weird coincidence, but it does look luke it's around the same places.
---
It‚Äôs latency, obviously the Killer will have no lag since they‚Äôre host. What‚Äôs happening here is complex but I‚Äôll just put it in laymen‚Äôs terms:
---
When you are running around as a survivor, you and the Killer see 2 different positions of where your character actually is. For you, you have obviously jumped the vault and have hit the ground already, for the Killer (since he has no latency) sees you mid vault and hits you in the back. 
---
The discrepancies are caused to latency, as the Killer will ALWAYS see you at a slightly later time in reality to what you are actually on your side. Dedicated servers will fix this. It‚Äôs quite irritating but once you understand how it works, you can better judge safe vaults and killers range. 
---
That‚Äôs why when you crouch behind a rock before the killer rounds the corner, they some how still saw you. As on their end, they saw you crouch behind the rock as you are slightly delayed for them.
---
its always fun when your about to prestige and you decide to use the add-ons and offerings you have been hording
---
&gt; I never see the "complaining" that he gets accused of
---
It's because of your first sentence, he's your favourite streamer. When you like to be around someone, you tend to not notice their flaws. You're more so just happy to be around that person. His complaining tends to be against his teammates not playing optimally, yet when someone points out that he's not being optimal they get banned from his chat. 
---
If you're dishing out, you gotta be willing to take some of that back. No one plays perfectly, and ignoring your own flaws while pointing out others is a great way to have people not like you.
---
YES THAT WOULD BE A VERY BIG WIN
---
That...was unintentional. 
---
Damn you now I can't unsee it.
---
Yeah, but she‚Äôs really funny. Didn‚Äôt follow anything about her on the Drag Race show, but found her on the Trixie and Katya show on Vice. 
---
We actually saw her show live and it was great (again, this is with no prior viewing of her past stuff)
---
Yeah, I don't want revenge or anything like that. Chat suspension is a great idea to me! I just want something done to prevent this. I have some really great moments in DBD but most of the time its a bunch of toxic people though. :(
---
Ikkk I hate it so much, I usually add a ton of friends (I play on switch) so most of the time someone I know will always be online so at least I can trust someone
---
Either way, she is now in my mind. Makes it way more bad ass lol
---
One question, how did you get that mask? I have been wanting one for a long time.

---
Her crouch speed should be faster. Bear traps should be based on skill checks instead of timers. She should have them activated by default instead of waiting for a generator. Her growl should be after the ambush, not before. She also deserves custom chase music/a panic theme for beartrapped survivors.
---
You can also mute chat btw after every match. 
---
But on console it‚Äôs different. I know Microsoft has a strict policy due to any kind of negativity.
---
Mate as someone who watches hours of tru3 content daily, he whines a fuckton more than you‚Äôre letting on.  I watch him bc he‚Äôs skilled, but beyond the skill his personality is hot garbage.
---
He was bad. He was annoying, and could gaurentee a kill, but still bad at actually winning.
---
I don‚Äôt fully remember from the top of my head, especially when it‚Äôs 4am in the morning for me, but I went to their support page, made a new ticket, filled in my information, explained the situation, linked their steam profiles, screenshots and my personal ID (you can find it in dbd options, at the bottom)

Thank you lol

It's not hard to turn an look while chasing someone. Also on the counter argument I would much rather lose the information of discordance while chasing that have sound effects hindering my ability to chase
---
Fuck yea!
---
No... I play Legion all the time without Ruin and I‚Äôm a rank 4. I have Fire Up, but no Ruin. Sometimes Gen-Rushing happens, but I have 500 hours with Legion and I know how to play them where I can keep a game in my hands. Even in a SwF, if I apply pressure accurately I can three gen them and push them to a point where two of their friends are on a hook and they need to decide if it‚Äôs a gen or rescue. These scenarios are often enough for me where I‚Äôll walk out with at least a 3k.
---
Yeah, I could, but that doesn't solve the problem. I don't care all that much that they said that to me. It's more that I know a few people who are new to the game and have been completely turned away because of similar issues so for those who cannot take the toxicity, I think something should be done.

It‚Äôs not what people say that turns them away it‚Äôs more of what people do.

It‚Äôs the constant harassment of either a survivor or low rank killer. That‚Äôs the true problem.
---
Paying to grind isn't really consumer but this is pretty OK I guess.
---
In the original quote, he says there is no Queen of Englad, whom does exist. Therefore, this meme is saying that Bunny Feng will be released. This is the prophecy lads
---
He had no map pressure and took forever to down. He was bad for the game, but he was still one of the worst killers, assuming no dcs.

So hag cosplay next is what I hear? Just wack a whole titty out. Or Spirit and make a medical tape thong!
---
I guess we can agree to disagree, having a 60 second timer and being fresh off the hook is already insane criteria to hit because there‚Äôs no guarantee the killers nearby or you‚Äôll hit the skill check :p

That‚Äôs true. But this is a fantasy post right? XD lol
---
Let me dream! Haha
---
His skin.
---
Killer queues are always awful because no one wants to play survivor. Give me a break.

For the most part, any survivor is just a re-skin once you unlock the perks that you want. Just because people are ace doesn't mean they're using his kit. :)

Of course. No need to thank me. You are welcome though

And then you will never hear from them again. It's just a useless system that achieves nothing to make you feel better thinking you told on the bad people. Lol.
---
Oh yeah for sure. I'm a survivor main and I just use perks I think are fun, not OP lol. Also, teabagging and flashlight bullshit just isn't my thing. I play to escape and help others escape but not be OP or an asshole along the way.
---
Yeah.. no....
---
But.. but pig is in a pretty good place atm. Traps disable the player and makes them play vulnerable. Sure the traps not working endgame is bad but other than that she doesn't 'need' a buff. 
---
Clown and Legion are the ooof killers. With Freddy existing theres no point in clown. Legions power works backward, being unable to down with it
---
Hol up, the killer is exposed? So the survs can fucking murder them?
---
Pinhead lol. 
---
I say this everytime as a prediction because I just want it to happen lol.
---
Vomit down my throat UwU
---
^(don't question me)
---
Ok, I've changed some of them
---
Hope to just being a 2% buff towards Haste (honestly was what i was gonna do originally).
---
Second Chance has been replaced with Not Today and instead increases the struggle phase time by 10-20-30 seconds.
---
Run and Gun is pretty much how you described it.
---
Walk it off has been adjusted to what you said it should be.
---
Wiggle Out is pretty much what boil over should have been.
---
Thrill of the Hunt imo should have been something like that from the start (instead of something to protect totems that still get taken out within a minute of the match) but I might end up changing it to 0-0.5-1%
---
Pacify would most likey be used with save the best for last to hit a little before a pallet and get them soon after with the reduced attack cool down.
---
Tripwire Hooks was meant to be like that, as kinda like a discount version until you can get the better one fron the shrine or through the killer.
---
What? I meant you can just see them
---
I‚Äôll just have to adapt to a spirit wearing headphones.
---
That's not what exposed is tho
---
IIRC it's already been announced but it's called *Back 4 Blood* so maybe they just skipped 3
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Edit: Nvm I'm wrong, but *Back 4 Blood* is a spiritual successor
---
Ive been a fan of samination since before he was dping dbd stuff. I used to watch him back in high school, so theres a little bit of a nostalgia factor for me.

Nope that mangled chain thing was all he had and it didn't add range.

all Versions are made by behaviour interactive

Ikr what a ***PIG***.

So when you‚Äôre exposed from haunted grounds spirit can just run up and kill you?

I wish she kissed you and did that during her mori OwO

Insta down you yeah

Big large oof.

Are you not entertained

I'm just playing XD

there are already ingame counters to that (lockers).

That‚Äôs fair. It already makes me feel a little better just discussing it with the peeps on reddit so far :) so thanks for that!

Sweet cosplay

üòÇüòÇ

I‚Äôm assuming you don‚Äôt understand how things work mate.
---
Well I didn‚Äôt mean it as you can kill the killer you can just see them, tbh I just got lazy with looking statuses up and assumed people would know what I meant
---
This joke is so old that the Crow of Judgement is hanging above it
---
This makes me happy. It‚Äôs nice to see new people enjoying the game and not being put off by salt/bullying, good change of pace! GL!
---
Thanks lmao!
---
Just don't make me remember the scaring that happened finding that sub..
---
It‚Äôs all fine man and they can do what they want and I‚Äôll be fine with it lol. 
---
We all have difference in opinions in just half this was civil, good day mate!
---
Or a random tree/hook
---
it worse with a claudette who completed her, full duration self heal right in front of me and also didnt bother to heal me. Us being both injured.
---
I wanted to put myself on hook. Thankfully huntress was more altruistic and gave me a lift
---
Leatherface, is that you?
---
Lmao of course! But hey if you‚Äôre looking for a rougher look you could always add scars/cuts/wounds to your stomach area to make you look roughed up! Stills looks great the way it is but it could work! :)
---
Great cosplay
---
I'm a small YT'er trying to get my stuff out there, thanks for checking it out!
---
Thank you so much!
---
Let me boop the snoot!
---
But overall a really nice cosplay. I‚Äôm curious about the head and blade. I think I saw you got it off Amazon (how much was price) but I‚Äôm wondering the story behind how the blade was made or if it was bought as well.
---
&gt; The reason it‚Äôs complained about is it spoils the game for whoever you do it to
---
I'm sorry, but this is just completely false and reveals nothing but a sense of entitlement. Part of this game is being chased and being at risk of dying. The other parts include generators, saves, heals, etc., but one part is definitely getting chased. Notice how you don't hear the same level of complaint if someone is getting chased all game and the killer never catches them. They will badmouth and bash the killer as being a baby, boosted, trash, etc., but will not have near the level of indignation if they don't die. Survivors will get salty if they die, particularly if it's in a way they don't find acceptable. 
---
That's not how this works. While this may be a video game, you don't get to dictate how the person you're playing against chooses to play. If they want to focus one person or not, it's their choice. You may have your personal feelings about the play being honorable or equitable, but that's where it ends. 
---
&gt; I like to try and make sure everyone has fun
---
And that's fine, but moralizing this, as many who criticize it tend to do, is pointless and just makes you look like a crybaby. Killers are there to kill, not to lead a tour guide or curate an experience. If you  want to personally play in a way that you feel is "fair" to survivors, then do so, but neither you, nor anyone else, can try to enforce that through social censure and shame to be the norm. 
---
And as always, it only ever works in one way. Killers aren't allowed to complain about survivors, despite having real issues in need of addressing. For example, killers can't comment or complain on the very real problem of tile strength because it's always responded to as "that's what the survivors have to have though. looping is how they survive just git gud", and while I may agree with that, there are far too many safe tiles, particularly when they spawn near each other. 
---
Furthermore, survivors are allowed to tell killers to break chase after a certain period of time, but killers aren't allowed to tell survivors to give up looping after a certain period of time. Why is it always in one direction? Why can survivors consistently neuter and emasculate killers by putting multiple constraints on them and telling them to just give up, but the same can't be done in reverse?
---
The minute we start having survivors give themselves up after running from jungle gym to safe tile back to jungle gym to killer shack with things like insta heals and lithe/dead hard/balanced landing is the minute I'll take some of the survivor complaining seriously. 
---
I play both sides, and have been rank 1 for a long time. As killer, I play to win. What becomes "necessary" to win is based off the gameplay of the survivors, and I don't intentionally handicap myself for anyone. If I'm in the area of the unhook and I find both the rescuer and the rescued, I'm gonna try hitting the rescued again. The faster they're out of the game, the faster I find myself in a stronger position. Don't like it? Tough shit. As survivor, I again do what's necessary to survive. If I get chased and focused, then I either have to be elusive and win the chase, or I get killed. The biggest issue with survivors is that they expect to get the "full experience" out of a match. Sometimes you're going to die first, and quickly to boot, and others you'll get all the way to the very end. You either get better, or you throw a temper tantrum and blame everyone else. Whatever choice you make, your personal complaints don't hold power to force someone else to make you happy.
---
A leatherface joke &lt;3
---
I think the shirt is a bit too small for u, but it looks cool though.
---
This is really damn good, nice job.
---
That's a rare situation though and honestly I don't really want 20 minute long games of little to no action with the killer struggling to find people at all. I remember the days of immersion and that wasn't much better.
---
In the end, it is hard to balance having a long, fun experience for a game like this.
---
I wasn‚Äôt in your game but it‚Äôs all good man, I‚Äôm sure if they knew the reason they would be fine! I hope your alright and you are able to get home soon as and safe!!
---
Why is Steve hated? I want to main him as a survivor but if that is the case..
---
If you had your shirt off it would‚Äôve been 11/10
---
But it‚Äôs still a 10/10 no matter if you don‚Äôt have shirtless Myers ‚Ñ¢
---
I get that. I'm not trying to criticize either I'm just genuinely curious about it because I guess I dont understand most of the jokes ya know?
---
Pretty good job so far... And in this case, I actually mean it! Easily one of the best killer cosplays I've seen!

Yesterday I did a SWF as Face Campsconti, I opened a chest and got a Skeleton key and we 4-man hatched on a poor killer. Plunderers and Ace in the Hole are pretty meme when they work magic.

At least you GET in games, takes me 15 minutes to get in one and when I do I die first hook

For messaging just make it to where they can‚Äôt message you there‚Äôs a certain feature on Xbox where you can make only friends message you.

For in game harassment no cure to that besides not caring.

 I have quit the game due to constant harassment but I‚Äôve enjoyed my time.

Sometimes I feel dbd is a better watching experience then playing especially as a killer.

Because people heard some ignorant say hitbox and like sheep repeat that. Even if it's not related to hitbox at all

Oh btw

I‚Äôd also like

Alien and predator

Especially alien now that we have demo lol

Just stood there and took it. Geez.

all the survivors swarm hooked survivor,guy downs them all,they get mad
---
He gon flash survivors
---
I'm over thinking of it's bad survival rate. It's entertaining getting scared at least cus I don't know where the killer is. I actually am curious if it'll eventually get the Springwood treatment with multiple variations
---
I hated this game the first time I played it then maybe a year or two later I redownloaded it and loved it becuase I understood the game mechanics more, you will have to take beatings on killer and you will have to deal with some shit on survivor but it‚Äôs very well worth it. As a newer player I though flashlights were INCREDIBLY overpowered but it was Becuase I didn‚Äôt understand them very well. Learn how to 360 learn how to do infinite‚Äôs at shack, bait killers into doing things and mindgame the survivors good luck it there and remember, death is not an escape
---
https://redd.it/ddj6nv

^ difference between latency and hitbox 
---
*the more you know*
---
It's a known bug so hopefully they fix it.
---
Just look around for Myers and mind your scratch marks when spirit does her thing
---
Its a glitch. Apparently there can be a bug in the code where it queues killers as survivors.
---
Yeah, I've started doing the proper reporting the last couple months to see if they ever do anything. That's all I've ever gotten from reporting people who help the killer, which they have listed as "bannable" on their website lol. They're pretty useless when it comes to proper community control.
---
Ima be real with you, that pig t-pose and dab is the best thing I've seen all day. Absolutely amazing cosplay!
---
I cannot explain why, but I want a werewolf monster that howls lol.
---
You mean "Their aura will be revealed", Exposed is a status effect that will put a survivor from any normal health state into the Dying state. (Healthy to Dying, Injured to Dying)
---
Am I a dick if I open a gate and just leave when someone is hooked? I‚Äôm new to this survivor business
---
yeah but how did he acknowledge me? sorry if I'm confused about something. do you mean another killer joined my game by accident?
---
Yeah also this game isn‚Äôt very casual friendly.
---
Probably my favorite thing about ghostface is that you can tbag players back, congrats on the 4K tho!
---
[**Godspeed you magnificent bastard.**](https://youtu.be/nWDCIbrKnwg)

And the. You down them as Ghostface and do the same thing

Only if it has a horrifying honk that happens upon seeing a survivor
---
And yeah, it‚Äôs so satisfying to do it to
---
Dont take winning so seriously. It's okay if they escape. It doesnt mean you're bad. Changs perks. Switch playstyles.  Focus on what you can change and you'll have a better experience mate.
---
Wait till the update drops in 2 days, everyone will be playing and you'll be able to find people at your rank
---
Because it's just four people laying down...?
---
It‚Äôs really quite a shame...
---
Reposti
---
That's kinda cool.
---
My point: I don't wanna waste my time, good for you that you win, of course just because you can, all others can amiright? But for most of us noobs low tier inferior life can't deal with such bullshit, even tho you manage to win, it will mostly not be fun, I would rather be in another match and lose to a fucking trapper than sweat my balls off expecting the spirit do a ton of mistakes to me win, the same way the Prayer Beads Spirit wanna have fun, I also want to, that's why I don't use meta shit or play squad, because that's not fun, if I don't do that shit with others, others can't do it with me
---
love the subject line. haha. that one survivor is so Boss that their quit means the match quits.
---
Hm? she could vomit at anytime but if anywhere, i'd like it to be not on the table, if it was my home, you wouldn't either most likely.
---
not really because I was afraid of getting reported for cheating
---
i need her child inside of my stomach
---
yes,another human player, its happened on other platforms as well
---
Badass! I‚Äôm being Piggy for Halloween this year so I love seeing some fellow Oinkers!
---
Reporting on console has no effect, at least from my experience. But if I were a survivor and saw that i wouldn't report you i would probably laugh and record it as like a funny moments thing.
---
Yeah I looked it up, I can‚Äôt really change it now unless I repost and like I said I got tired of going between the app and the web browser to look up specific status effects so I just went out on a limb and thought people would ignore it if I got it wrong because it‚Äôs a common sense assumption that you can‚Äôt go kill the killer
---
OH SHIT
---
Purely cosmetic according to McClean (Gameplay Programmer) on one of his streams.i swear it used to though because I'd always receive ultra rare perks first before common on P3 characters.

Hey man, survivor's have feelings too and probably don't get the best of times when having their skull smacked with a cattle hammer or hacked at with a spine.

Thank you so much! I may be an ass killer but I will try and boop you and fail miserably!
---
Same, however that would work
---
Happened to me a couple years ago when my wife woke me up in the middle of the night to tell me the baby was on its way.
---
Only thing I can offer is try to look for patterns. I notice that some spirits (mostly low ranking) fake phase much more than actually using their power.

It also isn't very competitive friendly.

Good to know also underage kids play a pegi 18 game

I always wondered why there was so many teabagging and dumb posts around all the time

What's the ideal way to play if you're using Pig? The way I see it, the RBT are just a short distraction. You're lucky to get just one sacrifice with it a week.
---
Thats exactly what im talking about

I 100% agree with him. End me reddit. ;c here it comes..... Nah jk jk I agree with him like 70% but now that I know you like ferrets it‚Äôs like .4% and now I just want PMs of your ferrets!!!! &lt; 3

I just want Pinhead but originality then a Gladiator.
---
Ok. So you are saying you don‚Äôt want to adapt to different killers.  You don‚Äôt want to change your strategy, and you even put yourself at a disadvantage by using lower tier perks, even though you know everyone else in the game won‚Äôt be.  
---
Sorry but it‚Äôs your own fault.
---
Try learning to change the way you play and learn tactics to deal with certain things.  Go watch some youtubers or something and learn.  Spirit isn‚Äôt op, she is just godly at mind games.  So you need to put mindgame her or play stealthy as hell.  I usually play stealthy against her. And very cautiously.  
---
I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt have fun against her, but I do, she constantly keeps the tension high.  Prayer beads or not.
---
I will admit though, prayer beads are strong, but I don‚Äôt feel they are op.  Honesty I‚Äôd keep them the same, however make the prayer beads also have a debuff so spirit can‚Äôt hear grunts of pain and such while phasing (while using the beads) 
---
That would solve many issues people have

In America is 12, so what?

Wtf is up with people? Does nobody else want the bloodpoints?

Can confirm, Claudettes are the most toxic molecules in the post-chat I have EVER seen.

Thats a fanservice I appreciate

This is very interesting. I‚Äôd have to test it before I did it tho.

Gotta give the boys what they want.... a fucking T-pose.
---
Very impressive, awesome job!
---
Please someone edit Deja Vu over this
---
Only if I was slim enough..lmao
---
No, if you don't want to stick around that's fine; as long as you're in the game there's a chance the Killer can deny you your 5k Survival points. 
---
That said, staying behind and trying to save teammates is more exciting and can be extremely rewarding when successfully pulled off.
---
When killers get special hooks that give them add ons, and don‚Äôt lose add ons when getting brutal killer, then we can talk about survivors getting BP boosts
---
If you don‚Äôt mind my asking what rank are you
---
Lots of cultures and urban legends to look at for original killers I think WWll and one are certainly cool ideas but it‚Äôs alittle overplayed in the ‚Äúhorror‚Äù department I would personally like more Canadian and American urban legends even Egypt is a cool place not visited much
---
Noed punishes not doing objectives and only works until it's cleansed

I love hyper altruistic SWF. They make using my power easy as hell and suddenly they‚Äôre trying to hook-save while injured and throw the whole game.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dkue0t/the_crossover_we_deserve/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Her entire power needs changes on how it works, I don't feel like a simple buff will be enough.
---
What I feel that needs changed:
---
+ Crouching movement to be faster
---
+ Rule Set No.2 or a slightly weaker version becomes base and change the add on
---
+ rework add ons so they're actually useful
---
+ In general adjust perks to work with powers again (Exposed maybe not but something like Surge? really?)
---
+ Adjust RBT mechanics so it's somewhat more likely to remove it on the second or third box and less likely on the first or fourth
---
+ Adjust RBT mechanics so it's not useless once gates are powered but not too strong to practically give Pig a kill
---
+ Let Pig Tbag faster
---
Sprint Burst works but I would run Dead Hard for the I-Frames but either one is grand

Ik I suck

Edit: do you mean killer rank?
---
Hell yea now we can sleep in peace tonight
---
Nah, couldn‚Äôt possibly be just a couple of friends wanting to play a game together.  Sure there are bully teams out there, but most would just be people wanting to play with friends and wanting to play well.
---
Yep it did
---
Because they like to act like the survivor rulebook isn't actually a thing they do.
---
Lol I understand.  I'm not toxic I promise.
---
Thank you!!
---
Sailor steves have a high chance of DC.
---
Thank you! It was a accident and I rolled with it :)
---
Sadly you're right but as you can see yourself, people approve it..
---
I would encourage this if the game became f2p, and for the amount of things you MUST pay in the store, even without counting cosmetics, is way too much
---
100~$ for the entire game if you want to have every chapter, which means, perks, that ARE fundamental for playing. No, shrine isn't enough. You know how many times BBQ came out in the last year in the shrine? 2 times..
---
So.. they should really make it f2p if even f2p don't make you pay this much for non cosmetics things
---
Hey atleast the legion part is actually true

This is amazing! Makes me hate the pig less now haha.
---
Footsteps
---
This bothers me too. They need to increase it.
---
Depends on the situation I guess. I would say I would get in the habit of staying knowing you will die to give you experience on how to handle these situations. Most of the time for me I have already at least got a pip so I see it as already "won" imo as bloodpoints are easy to get. I feel the experience of getting those close games where I feel achievement in helping others to far outweigh a few extra bloodpoints.
---
I bet you can still rock a pig cosplay!!!
---
RBTs are meant to slow the game down, not kill unless the Survivor screw around or you use add ons to make it more likely
---
&gt;Fashionable ~~Dwight~~ nea?

What I mean is you guys still using that number incorrectly.

In Japan you can't have sexual intercourse with a 13yo. You get jailed immediately

Is between the same-ish age. It kinda pisses me off when people say bs like that you know? In every first world country, you can have that kind of intercourse between legal adults. The end
---
That age of consent is basically between not adults which are counted differently

When a game is so poorly optimized like dbd it runs like shit on everything. It will run better (or perfectly fine) on a PC but usually unoptimized games tax the system more than needed.

Well it turned out great!

I keep getting a bug where if I trash a daily and get a new one, it changes that daily to get 4 chainsaws with leatherface lol

It is a fucking boring experience to play this map as an m1 killer(wraith main). You pretty much have no way of mindgaming most pallets, so you just have to eat them.
---
The only reason i dont absolutely hate it is because survivors tend to go absolute brain dead when they get this map for some reason.

He will appear there in about a day

Your objective is to not die.  Cleansing totems helps you not die.  Therefore cleansing totems=good

Just uninstall the game by this point

This subreddit is the worst place on earth

Can Autodidact also get this please?

I don't know why anyone would be against increasing survivor BP unless you don't play any survivor and you don't want them to have nice things.
---
I don't even care which side gets more BP, it would just be nice to not take 5+ games to get 100k BP when killer can do it pretty easily in 2.
---
Dwight
---
C'mon running head on, inner strength, quick n quiet, and iron will is fun
---
Nah I just do it to scare the shit outta the killer

Honestly with how fewer skill checks that bitch gives you it's need to work with medkits and self healing.

A house near us had a father that killed his family after he got fired. He then hung himself after. WILD STUFF.

This is one of those posts that made me laugh out loud literally, and not just some quick nasal exhale sound. The accuracy here is top notch. I‚Äôm a P3 Claudette main, and I never do this, but I do see it way too often and want to knock them down myself.

I play both sides and whenever I play killer, my main goal is to always be chasing someone or at least know where survivors are. And Ive checked all the gens, chased someone down, hooked. Checked the gens again and none are being worked on, person gets saved so I go back to see how many are there. And only the person who got saved is running away, everyone else is hiding. Then yeah I'm going to go for the one person I see and not waste time one 3 bendettes. So Ive been called a camper and a tunneler cause everyone but 1 person is hiding the entire game, so I find that 1 person over n over again. If I hook them twice in a row though n havent seen anyone else. If there is at least 3 gens still to do. I just leave them on the ground so they can be healed back up.

Who plays video games without $100+ headphones?
---
This is my friend and I testing this out in KYF. OoO is completely busted against Freddy when the user is asleep. This opens no opportunities for mindgames and I'm very glad this was only a KYF match.
---
I just want it to work with medkits so I can run both needles to get an actual chance for a skill check
---
Survivors also have human beings behind the screem but I guess its all about killers
---
Shes got the head out there
---
But can you oink like The Pig?
---
This has happened to me too. I closed hatch and Meg jumped through the closed door a good two seconds after. Me, her, and the spectators all saw and we laughed it off in chat.
---
just prestige 2..
---
meanwhile.. i don't have a single prestige char.
---
:&lt;
---
Ok, so other than some contradictory statements from your reply.  I apologize for going off track, I should have solely stuck to prayer beads. 
---
Honestly, I don‚Äôt care if they nerf prayer beads. I just personally don‚Äôt feel they are game breaking.   And I disagree that adding some debuffs to it wouldn‚Äôt help. I think it would.
---
All my opinion though so...  sure
---
People trying to be dicks is basically it. In SWF, it is a bait trick to get the killer chasing the best survivor at looping. In solo queue, it's just someone being a cock.
---
I‚Äôm aware, I play very gen protective, and I main legion, my play style is to slow the game down, that might be why it‚Äôs not such a problem for me although I see how it could be a problem to other killers
---
What tasks are the "survivors" going to complete?
---
Thanks, I needed this today.
---
I mean... you don‚Äôt have to play as the clown to level up the clown XD
---
IMO this will always be the thing holding DbD back. The start is horrible for new players and it‚Äôs even worse if you don‚Äôt start with friends since playing with randoms is such a pleasant experience most of the time... 
---
It gets better once you‚Äôre more experienced and learn how to react to certain things properly.
---
Pop is super good. But not by itself. Try and make a gen stopper build with it. Like Ruin, Overcharge and maybe thanatophobia. Anything gen related goes with it. And if you want a bit of an all rounder build you can just have overcharge and pop then some other perks you like.
---
What about Autodidact?
---
Don‚Äôt play him lol
---
Legit happened to me (I‚Äôm a killer)
---
Seriously, if your gonna use DS at least use the stun time
---
Yeah, I appreciate all the explaining you did but, I understand most of that, all I‚Äôm saying is what defines tunnelling? Is the killer being toxic and tunnelling if he hooks a survivor twice and eliminates them earlier in the match; or is it if he does it more then once and the entire match almost? 
---
Personally I don‚Äôt think the former is all that bad. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thanks.
---
Now after replaying it a million times when it was originally posted I'll now replay it a million more
---
Don't play him then, just level him up to whatever it is for the teachable. You're right, he isn't that great. Not that bad, just even that much worse if you're not good with him
---
Wrong even pop by itself is super good....
---
Unrelated to DBD but I just got home from my wedding reception. Tired and feet beat all to hell, but it was the happiest night of my life thus far. And dancing with my husband was the topper to it, it made me smile and still is right now thinking about it. I‚Äôve already watched the video like 4 times lol.
---
I don‚Äôt have the will to play right now. But I‚Äôm stoked for the Halloween event. I missed double bp a while back due to our honeymoon(we did it backwards I know) so I‚Äôm super excited to play again without worrying of plans and to expenses.
---
Especially with the voice changer.
---
People who aren‚Äôt privileged
---
Well it doesnt stop much if survivors keep tapping gens so you need something to stop the proggress made too. Unless you want them to be on gens you kick. Then you would run survailance and pop.
---
Autodidact doesn't affect flat out speed. It's like hitting a great skill check but the bonus is bigger (provided you have the tokens) so it does stack.
---
No but if you have AMC they're doing their annual fear fest marathon and every Halloween movie will be playing on their network from Oct 29 through Nov 1

Despite the fact a shitty Survivor match can yeild you 5k but a shitty killer match get net you atleast 15k which is a good game for a Survivor. Plus killers loose their add-ons so they can't just keep using shit like infinite tier3, prayer beads, etc indefinitely.
---
survivor perks are fine if you run the best (BT, DS, DH, Unbreakable) its still acceptable, survivor items on the other hand... instaheals or BNP are in the too sweaty section, heck even green to purple items will barely give non spirit/nurse killers a chance
---
Something we would have to work out. Looking for ideas. We don't want people to hurt themselves or others doing it. But we do want ways to slow the killer down if need be.
---
r/suicidebywords
---
I think a killer who could manipulate the crows would be cool
---
Just gotta turn your volume real high or use Stridor. I use decent headphones (definitely not audiophile quality but pretty good) and I almost never hear breathing unless they are injured. Footsteps I can hear pretty regularly no matter the terrain but I blast my volume quite high.
---
EDIT: a word
---
Too hard to google "l4d2 dwight"?
---
Fleshing it out actually. Looking for ideas. Repairing a generator is not exactly something we can replicate. may have to take a look at how Hide Or Die does it.
---
Clown is not bad, you just need practice. Anticipate the path of the survivor better so they will hit the gas during and unsafe moment of the loop. If you don't like playing him you don't have to.
---
I can tell you one thing, she has great internet
---
I would love this map but I can imagine survivors complaining since there would be little aid them in chase.
---
a killer walking into a match with add ons is guaranteed to lose up to 14k BP, while a survivor gets a chance to keep his items. My point is that killers don‚Äôt even get a chance to keep their stuff, while survivors can keep their shit just fine.
---
Clearly not. I'm poor as hell but still have a decent headset.
---
there are plenty of survivor posts, i‚Äôm sure one post about killers won‚Äôt do you too much harm.
---
It might be exciting for yourself as the survivor, but imagine the killer side of it. It is boring not finding anyone for 8 years.
---
Niceee
---
I don't get it.
---
Iron Will is good against every killer.
---
You have to try to get better at bottle throws to shut down loops as fast as possible with him. Save bottles for loops or bring extra bottles for Hail Mary throws. If you have trouble dealing with Exhaustion perks try bringing the Can that causes exhaustion for 30s. Also slowdown or expose perks are lifesaver for him due to no slowdown. Hopes this helps from a rare clown main.
---
Edit: Also be wary about reloading while chasing, it slows you down too much so if it‚Äôs safe, reload at loops or hooks
---
This needs to be the other way. Tbagging does nothing. 
---
However a killer that facecamps/legit tunnels/ bad manners survs actually affects gameplay and ruins games for the other person. 
---
But man tbagging sure does hinder the killer.

It's not worth MY time to get 2K BP for sitting on fucking hook because someone just hooked and watched me.  Nobody else matters in terms of my own benefit and I can see why people would just suicide or DC cause that shit is flat cancer.
---
It's almost like hardcore face camping should be punishable.
---
üò© Facecamp me
---
Idk why you're getting downvotes
---
If this is in Los Angeles I will pay whatever it takes to be part of this
---
Nah I'm not toxic like that. :)
---
We should get one of the special infected as a killer, like the Hunter or Witch. The Hunter would literally be just the Legion with the Demogorgons moveset
---
It looks more like your post is just advocating against increasing survivor BP because killers use addons.. 
---
I get that argument, but BP you earn as a survivor doesn't have to be used on a survivor so like.. if they buffed survivor BP then you could play a few games without using any items for some easy BP to put into whatever killer you want to play. 
---
The reason I think killers should earn more BP is to help keep the needed 1-4 ratio. With BBQ though you can EASILY earn 40k+ BP per game as a killer so I don't see any harm in making it easier to hit at least 20k per game as a survivor.
---
Like I said
---
&gt;BT is it's own issue that I'm not talking about here
---
$40 bucks doesn't get you good headphones lol
---
I mean yeah that makes sense.
---
It might be easy to have boxes with a code required.  Code numbers could be scattered through the area?
---
Dead by epic cosplay light!!! This is bloody brilliant mate. The wardrobe colors, the setting, the pose atop the tree stump. True attention to detail with the mask, outfit, and knife...wow,just wow. 
---
Even looks like you just sacrificed all 4 survivors and now you're posing in victory for the entity. This is amazing.
---
Sloppy Butcher will only help if you hit them down from healthy state or leave them slugged, thanatophobia is something that only adds a bit more time to gens and healing. Its a decent build, but not really optimal
---

Let me check my ever expanding data bank of hackers/hacking material. Ill get back to you within 47-49 business years.
---
I think the only problem would be every game would be 4 dudes with purple toolboxes or instas, plus stacked perks like it already is, just a bit more prevalent since it would take less time. It certainly wouldn't be a bad thing but it would be a little more annoying on killer side
---
Will sloppy work with feral frenzy?
---
No need I‚Äôll take one for the team for all of us
---
Nope, only if you have the addon
---
So do you main pig or just wanted to cosplay her?
---
Holy shit this is beyond parody lmfao
---
Aside from the general consensus telling you to play others and dump BP into clown..
---
Yellow feather + Flask of Bleach
---
Also any add-ons that grant faster reloading speed (5 seconds base, sucks). Try to keep one of the add-ons I previously listed (bleach preferably).
---
Also Otzdarva [Youtube/Twitch] has a very solid clown build hes running right now that's worth looking into.
---
Awe thank you so much! I can't take credit for the mask because I ordered it offline but everything else I put together! I made the saw with cardboard, fake blood and paint!
---
Aw darn, though it goes on till they heal right? So even if they get unhooked they'll have the mangled effect?
---
I main her! Still learning killer but she is def my favorite go to! Huntress would be my second in line tho!
---
Not a speed hacker, just the game glitching, unlucky for you. But this has been going on for a while now
---
I‚Äôd save that for a killer like the thing.
---
Oh really? I had no idea my bad
---
Oh shii.
---
FACTS. No ifs, ands, or buts about it.
---

---
*For $0.29 a day maybe we can stop stupid shitposts.*

This is good advice but Im getting bullied bc I dont have any perks or add-ons. Im still figuring out her power.
---
As with all things, not everyone's an asshole
---
The true terror.
---
Can never decide when to cleanse against the plague, especially when she can bring addons that trigger her spicy vomit.
---
I mean maybe if we were talking about making it easy to earn 100k bp per game, but i'm only talking about making it easier to hit 20k. I don't think that would break the game to the point where everyone is always bringing in ultra rare items.
---
Besides, as it is now if I wanted to, I could play 2 Spirit games with no addons or maybe brown/yellow addons and I shouldn't have too much of an issue getting 100k BP that I could dump into a survivor for some more items.
---
Absolutely agree. Cannot stand here and just get yeeted out of a game because someone tried to be funny with Head On. Well spoken.
---
Yep yep you get it
---
I'm just really excited to get more lore:)
---
Someone needs a nap
---
Being able to see things is an advantage.  Yes.  Survivors can see in third person that‚Äôs an advantage no?
---
I don't understand why you'd refuse to play a portion of this game's content. Even if they're rare low tier "unfun" Killers like Legion and Doctor do still exist, and due to the shear number of matches you'll likely play you're bound to run into them at some point.
---
As for high tier Killers like Spirit and Nurse when then you're cheating yourself even more. These Killers are popular for a reason and if you leave as soon as you see them you're going to be losing a lot of rank as well as items. And if you do it enough the game will auto-ban you.
---
That being said if I'm just dicking around casually with brown items / addons and I run into a fucking Plague I'll DC right then and there. It essentially feels like I'm already not playing when I play against Plague so I may as well just find a new fucking match.
---
Once in a while, the devs will have an event where you get double bps for a couple days.
---
Another way they could prob do it is so that the head and chest bunny cosmetic are locked together, for example you cant wear the bunny part without the jacket and vice versa
---
i set all my settings to max volume. I guess i have to find a way to make it higher.
---
Awe thank you &lt;3 came a long way from the original post!
---
Managed the achievement tonight.  Got a mix of ‚Äútoo new to know the game well‚Äù and ‚Äújust good enough that they‚Äôre bold but don‚Äôt have the skill to back it up‚Äù and wound up taking it.  Almost lost the last kill due to slugging the third person to catch the fourth since he was close enough to scream when I downed the third, but the third crawled super far away, found her with a barely visible sliver of her health left.  Felt good heh.  Thanks for the tips!

He didn't say "gen rush" but he's right, totems are an objective too, and if you skip past them you'll get punished. Has nothing to do with the killer, it's the survivors that determine if NOED procs.

---
You‚Äôre kidding right?
---
I went back and watched them recently. A lot of it really hinges on knowing stuff like old DS.
---
I like watching him too. But I personally believe its because he's so full of him self.he brings up the same things over and over again that are in his opinion wrong.(I agree with him 90% of the time but holy shit shut up about it.) Also he talks about other people having a god complex but imo he has one himself. But yes I agree,  he is good, he can be enjoyable to watch and he also holds him self together rather well when people are being toxic to him and stream sniping him. Which happens a fuck load when he plays killer. Honestly the survivors are nutty that he plays against and he gets potatoes when he plays survivor. That's my opinion anyways.
---
I‚Äôm a new player and I just wanna say that The Hag‚Äôs teleporting ability is a godsend. It‚Äôs helped me out massively. The Doctor is fun to play with but a little slow. I‚Äôve tried playing The Huntress a couple times and they both ended up in mass teabagging.
---
Mm, I think status affects get removed when they‚Äôre hooked
---
That hurt to watch
---
People tell survivors to always run iron will dead hard etc -just Incase- they face x killer -maybe-  in a match that would be annoying to face without wearing that perk, so I don‚Äôt see the issue.
---
I had no idea there was one coming so soon.
---
The halloween bloodhunt, October 31st into November.
---
Consider throwing Discordance in there from time to time. It‚Äôs great for finding survivors early in the match, since they‚Äôll often spawn together and work on gens together.
---
Except those perks and killers all function within the intentions of the devs. I guarantee how OoO is acting in the screenshot above is definitely not intended.
---
Sounds like someone here has a stomach fetish amirit?
---
Man I haven‚Äôt played against Plague in a while
---
From downtown
---
I am not a script monkey, but I would assume that they do not track those stats across matches (if that).
---
There is probably a reason why all Killer dailies and most achievements are basically the same format of USE ABILITY ON SURVIVOR 4 times.
---
They use things they are already tracking for BP gain and pipping that are relatively easy to track.
---
Adding other factors could require changing code that is working decently so far. And you don't change working code if you don't have to.
---
It‚Äôs worked this same way with wraith since launch.
---
i hate when a killer do this.
---
most of the time, it is just unnecessarily prolonging the game.
---
It‚Äôs like:
---
Loading screen...
---
*buzz of fluorescent lights*
---
‚ÄúNope. Fuck this.‚Äù
---
DC.
---
Actually maybe add the ability to appear as any of thevbase killers too.  For that first mindbender.  "Oh guys its a trapper"  "wait theres no traps. .... brp is that you following me?"
---
i play for fun and i‚Äôm not high rank so maybe my opinion is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù but. i think every killer gets just about even with the right skill, add-ons &amp; perks. 
---
you can really maximize their power. that being said, as a survivor i‚Äôm not a fan of going against the cannibal, spirit, legion or shape. i would put plague on that list but i‚Äôm biased since my love for her as a character definitely outweighs lol. i‚Äôd say the worst killer is trapper, he doesn‚Äôt have a good starting power in my opinion. his traps are powerful but they can be broken out of/disabled + it might take him a while to even set them up or get to a triggered one.
---
in conclusion: i love plague
---
Hmm, there's a David Cameron joke here somewhere...

Pig could use a little love. I like her base kit, since it has a lot of interesting mechanics, but it does fall a bit short of the mark.
---
What was the point of typing this out. 
---
Also, what was the point of posting this?
---
See, the thing is I could absolutely see spending that time on someone like Wings of Redemption, Low Tier God, or Dark Side Phil (Who think they're God's gift to gaming, can't accept their loses, constantly make excuses, all while being stuck at the DBD equivalent of yellow ranks)...
---
But Tru3 legit has the ability to back up what he's talking about, isn't anywhere near as toxic as them (Low Tier God is legitimately racist, was emotionally abusive to his girlfriend, and downright delusional). Also, the major point of contention that Tru3 has with the game is how horribly balanced it is (Which isn't a new thought) and how toxic the community is (also true).
---
Maybe it's just because I like to laugh at Low Tier God, but I legitimately don't see what the problem with Tru3 is.
---
But if I hook the other survivor, the chances of the remaining survivor getting the hatch skyrockets
---
A killers gotta do what a killers got to do
---
Last I read Cunningham won the liscence to everything in the first movie including the name Voorhees, but Miller still owns everything else including the now nameless hockeymask killer we know and love, then the appeals started?
---
I‚Äôve tossed ideas like this around, like a killer that could possess survivors to ambush others, but the problem is SWF would roll over killers that are built on deceptions like these
---
Whail Coordinateh
---
Awesome! Are you going to make a complete cosplay or just the props for displaying? These are great!
---
Better Plague than Freddy in my book. But I'm running OoO now, so eh.
---
It‚Äôs not about adapting it‚Äôs about having fun.  Omega blink nurse, forever freddy, and prayer beads spirit (or honestly just base spirit), are unfun to face and just a slog.  Why put yourself through the inevitable antifun and unbalanced garbage that those things bring?  I say the same about finding yourself on haddonfield against balanced landing or facing sweaty 4 man swf with OoO.  Video games are for fun and entertainment, and that‚Äôs what you should seek out when you play DBD.  The only thing I would ask is to die on hook instead of DCing.
---
Oink oink to you!
---
Likeleh
---
1) If such a Killer were added to the game, you'd have your power for one hit at the beginning of the match. The moment Survivors know that you could be any one of them is the moment they have a gentleman's agreement to stay the fuck away from each other.
---
2) In order to make the disguise of the Survivor actually work, you'd have to move at 100% Movespeed (being the slowest killer in the roster while transformed, Nurse don't count because of obvious reasons), and have an animation to sit on a gen to lure in Survivors. Sitting on a Gen waiting for someone to come by means that four other generators just popped while you did nothing to stop them.
---
3) Any SWF group would render the killer powerless simply because they could keep constant tabs on who is where doing what.
---
The idea isn't anywhere near as good as you want it to be, and would never function properly in the game.
---

Im far from being a good survivor. I can‚Äôt run jungle gyms because I panic too easily. I make mistakes all the time. But watching both OhTofu and Otz has helped me so much. This would‚Äôve never been possible months ago (took a very long break from DbD after it came out on consoles). This is an appreciation post. You guys taught me well enough to survive intense moments like this (and oftentimes I just die and that‚Äôs okay). All I can say is I appreciate you and your methods work wonders. I doubt you‚Äôll see this post, but thank you. &lt;3
---
As to why I didn‚Äôt just open the exit gate: I‚Äôm a solo survivor. I had no idea if it was just a tap or sitting at 90%. I didn‚Äôt want to risk it. He would‚Äôve just hooked me back to the basement. I also had to make sure he‚Äôd grab from the locker for my DS to activate. He knew I had Head On as I stunned him several times, so he was hesitant (or because he suspected I had DS). My intention was to lure him away as far as possible so the others could escape safely. Then the mindgame began. It wasn‚Äôt perfect by all means, but baiting a hit, using the barrel to disorientate the killer, etc. all helped. It was very intense and I enjoyed the rush. 
---
New players, don‚Äôt give up. Watch guides, streamers, etc. to get a good idea of what is what. It takes time, but it‚Äôs totally worth it. I encourage you to continue to play this game. Despite all its flaws, it‚Äôs very fun and rewarding. 
---
As for veterans, any pointers as to what I could‚Äôve done better would be appreciated.
---
if they ever buffed him i would love if some of his
---
add-ons were just a part of his power instead. i think his ‚Äúbing bong‚Äù noise (lol) shouldn‚Äôt give away his precise location, he would be so much better if you couldn‚Äôt tell exactly where he was coming from before he can even land a hit on you. i‚Äôd also love if he didn‚Äôt activate spine chill.
---
But it does. It saves around 1 1/2 seconds. Source: Me, playing 2 games; 1 with Botany and 1 without then using a stop watch to review the footage. You can't stack We'll Make It healing Speed past 100% but Botany and Leader still add to it.
---
That should come with also fixing and rebalancing the common reasons for DCing.  On both sides
---
Are you okay?
---
Only thing i can say is, you‚Äôre WAYYYYYYYYY fuckin better than me
---
I don't know why you got downvoted. This is completely true. Ive seen much better Ghostface costumes and it's not hard to put together. The mask is like 10 bucks.
---
I can't remember her wearing this in the movies, to be fair, I was almost throwing up from the gore
---
I'm not debating that part at all, I'm just saying I NEVER see Plagues, so the fact that you apparently see so many surprises me.
---
Nor me I was freaking pissed! I had thought I did so well that I deserved that 4k because I was playing Legion and I'm normally shit with Legion. I hooked the third guy and once I closed the hatch she legit just lept into it and I just started crying quarts I was so devastated !
---
Like they said before iron will is good against every killer.
---
I worded that poorly. What I meant to say is that there are better perks overall and survivors shouldn‚Äôt be obliged to use one specific perk

Sounds good right? Would satisfy low skilled entitled survivors right? Except that it means that the Spirit can go through you and beat you to loops much easier, go through your healing action and hit the survivor that you are healing, zoom past your body blocks and "tunnel" whoever they wish. What do you think would happen once those things started to occur Bricky? Do you think such people will complain any less? Do you think the DCs will stop?
---
Have you thought about that Bricky? Of course you didn't..
---
* Make Prayer Beads ultra rare and Mother Daughter Ring very rare
---
If this happens Spirit players will prestige her to level three which would give you the chance of getting Prayer Beads even faster and in more quantity. Most of all, is it going to stop such entitled low skilled survivor mains from DCing as soon as they get gen grabbed? No, Bricky, it won't. Because it's not the power that pisses them off - it's that they don't have the skill to outplay it (and that won't change with a rarity difference) nor do they want to be bothered with changing up their metas to bring in perks which help counter her. Even if Prayer Beads' rarity got changed, do you think they'll run Iron Will, Spine Chill, Premonition, Urban Envasion, other detection perks more? Because I think they'll still stick with their same exhaustion perks and second chance perks since they want their cake and want to eat it too.
---
Did you think about that Bricky? Offf course you didn't..
---
* Omni-directional pain grunts
---
So if I have this correct - rather than insisting that survivors use common knowledge and start to use Iron Will or Spine Chill more often, which hard counters Spirit, you'd instead make survivor sounds 360 degrees within a certain distance from a killer who goes blind when she uses her power. A killer who has to listen intently for the smallest of sounds to gauge direction if the survivor isn't running directly in front of them. Sounds, from a dev team, which you can flip a coin on the possibility of it being fucked up in some way patch-to-patch. Sounds which were just fucked up on the PTB just this past last week.
---
If Killers have problems hearing, the devs don't make the sounds louder for us. No.. we have to bring in Strider. When we want gens to go slower we **have** to bring in gen perks. When we want heals to go slower we **have** to bring in gen perks. 
---
Don't you find it a bit hypocritical to ask one side to bring in perks to counter actions, but ask for base changes for one side to counter a killer's actions?
---
Have you given one thought to that Bricky? Of fucking course you didn't..
---
* Delay to power recharge
---
This one is a doosy. She is tied for the slowest killer in the game - and that's not enough. She goes blind when using her power which no other killer does  - and that's not enough. Aura reading perks are disabled for her while she uses her power (the only such killer with that weakness)  - that's not enough either. She has a fifteen second cooldown - but that's apparently isn't enough as well.
---
So your bright idea is to give her some Nurse-like shit of an extra cooldown after she uses her power, followed by her regular fifteen second cooldown. Because that's gone over so well. Have you seen the threads about the Nurse on their official forums? Their mods were closing them down because their feelings were too hurt over people calling out their lies about only "reworking" her addons.
---
And do you remember that FUN TIME when the Nurse received a double stun and how well that went over? Did you consider any of that in "rework", Bricky? Fuck no you didn't.
---
Let me clue you in on something Bricky - survivors have perks that counter the Spirit, but refuse to use them as much as they should. They have stealth techniques and stradegies to use - but fail to do them when playing the Spirit. They have things to hide their auras, they have things to hide their footsteps, they have things to lessen their sounds.
---
When you have the tools to help you defeat a killer and fail to use them - that should be on YOU and not the killer. It is YOUR responsibility to ensure YOU are as prepared as possible to compete in a trial. And the killer is not there to make things easier for YOU, to give YOU a fun time, to make YOU more comfortable. He is there to kill YOU, to make YOU uncomfortable, to make life as DIFFICULT as possible so that HE can win.
---
Use stealth against the Spirit, do not be overly altruistic against the Spirit, and bring in Iron Will, Spine Chill, Premonition, Urban Evasion, etc. more to help you against the Spirit.
---
If you fail to do any of these three things, you deserve to get beat each and every trial against the Spirit. Each and every trial. And the killer should not be nerfed because of YOUR failures.
---
Blam, and it happens again, chill dude, I got no probs honestly, really haven't run into it but from seeing vids and understanding how the mechanic works new survivor objectives seem like an interesting fix in my opinion
---
You choose the role, you choose the dickin'.

Otz is slowly decending into maddness. Its just what DBD does to people. Hes becoming way less chill and forgiving of survivors in each video. Cant really blame him though its a stressful game to play at high ranks for long.

What if I play both?
---
IMO, I don't find it fun playing against the plauge. By no means am I calling her overpowered, I just hate dealing with the infection. First off, if you do the common strat of not cleansing, you're playing with no-mither the entire game. On top of that, due to vomiting and green sick gas, it's extremely hard to hide. Secondly, it's nearly impossible to not be infected for any significant amount of time.

---
I agree with you man, horn dogs we down vote you
---
One that the entire game is balanced around, yes.
---
Awesome run! Worth the full watch! But oooh man, the 3th time you ran past the hatch. Everything in my body were screaming! Get them headphones on! And keep up them good jukes.

Dear God, can't have that, right?
---
They, implying that I play survivor.
---
The punch to the face after is the flashlight blind and teabag
---
Wow you are such a fucking liar it‚Äôs actually insane. All your drawings are sexualized, other people have commented about you over sexualizing the character and they also get down voted to shit. Your bio is advertising your stream and you say you got ‚Äúlow self esteem‚Äù awh. Literally another female cosplay we streamer screaming for attention then denies it. Enjoy your fucking virgin army this is actually really sad and pathetic that you lie and can‚Äôt just admit what you‚Äôre doing. Women like you embarrass me.
---
The only wat to use a flashlight
---
They're downvoting you because you sound like a cunt, dude. Maybe stop being so antisocial?
---
"No! We already gave you that sailor kid to eat"
---
It‚Äôs... it‚Äôs actually not wrong

Watched without sound first, and caught myself saying "We're blasting off again!"
---
The only thing that sucks about gen speeds is how my matches are litteretly 60% of my lobby loading time and i barely got anything out of the match. It truly fucking sucks

Nice costume. That pigs head is fantastic. 
---
I envy people who have others to celebrate Halloween with. It‚Äôd be fun to dress up again. Hope it‚Äôs awesome. 
---
(I‚Äôve been following this sub cos I like the look of the game and want to play when I can actually afford the things I need to play it).
---
Exactlu. She isn't op at all, but she is so unfun and exhausting to play against because there is little to no counterplay to her, and because you have to rely on the competency of your teammates.
---
I haven't read her backstory for awhile, but wasn't there a *little* implication that the sword her dad used was slightly cursed?
---
Shityy or annoying personality? Interesting, I dont pick up either of those vibes when watching him, everyone has their own taste though.
---
In my opinion, beginning to counter spirit should start with counting in your head 5 seconds when you see her stand still and phasewalk. 5 seconds is how long her power is without add-ons. Maybe add a few seconds if you think she has an add-on.
---
Amazing. And if Oicmorez is correct. How is this not being looked at years ago? I just don't understand the community/dev interaction? Are they in their own world not fixing things that turn the game into anti-fun?
---
Yeah that's obvious,
---
But what I meant is that there realyl isn't anything bad with all of the killers gettin' their own music **except** for maybe those 2.  
---
And Identifiyng the killer could be one of them.
---
P3 stands for Prestige 3. After level 50 you prestige your character and start again at level 1. Prestige 3 is the level limit for your characters. M1 means ‚Äúmouse 1‚Äù and refers to the killers basic attack. If a killer is called a ‚Äúmouse 1 killer‚Äù then they are seen as a killer who only uses basics and not their power. Wraith is considered a m1 killer because after you uncloak then you must basic attack to kill.
---
Hyper defensive comments like this and being so adamant in your us vs them mentality are why you got down voted. Not because you said something against killers.
---
Please, game optimizations before anything else. I'm literally posting this in every reddit so our voice is heard. Literally just want things to FEEL correct and other anti-fun problems to go away. I'm posting this to call out for help, I love the game and I want it to succeed. I would just love these fixes because one small anti-fun/bullshit interaction ruins so much so quickly.
---
Pretty much all killers are strong.  Decent add-ons and most killers are good unless you run into strong red rank loopers on a bad map layout.
---
Thank you. This is very helpful. Are there any other common ones you know of that you could tell me?

I mean I did look at sizes and I did look at the models, it was one of those where it was a bit false advertising. I am sorry you dont like me to the point you have to be rude. It is my first cosplay and I am really proud. Tbh it's people like you who make me extremely anxious to the point I worry about how I dress let alone going outside.  There really is no need to be so judgmental. I really hope you have a wonderful day or night whenever you are, I mean it, everyone deserves good days.

Ooo- object of obsession
---
Mom- mettle of man 
---
Ds- decisive strike

Pwyf- play with your food

Stbfl- save the best for last
---
You will learn most of them through experience in the community
---
It depends how you look at it. On the first hand if one survivor spawned into the game, proceeded to touch a gen, then went on a search for ruin and spent 45-60 seconds not on a gen is it worth having? If you didn't have it that's a gen being completed. Sometimes they spawn on it and its gone instantly, you will likely lose the game, but your perks and play have nothing to do with a failed totem system. Corrupt Intervention is the only perk that can be a substitute, on bigger maps it might even be better than ruin could be and often leads to survivors rushing themselves into a three gen situation where perks like pop goes the weasel can make an unwinnable game a 3-4k game.
---
I‚Äôd rather lose items and addons as survivor if it meant better bp gen
---
It has to do with risk and reward, things that provide no real risk (infantry belt+iridescent) but massive reward are inherently bad for competitiveness (balance). But things like myers stalking ability are a valid risk (wasting time in chase and pressure) for a valid reward (the ability to one shot). Billy is similar, you risk taking a much more difficult m1 (the chainsaw), which has a lot of skill expression in landing consistently and effectively against strong loopers, for the reward of the insta down.
---
It has to do with the risk reward balance being out of wack, theres no increase in skill expression in insta heals from normal heals but you yield massive gains. Theres no extra skill expression in huntress when she puts on infantry belt+iridescent head, similarly.
---
Those are definitely my two worst maps as survivor lol I‚Äôll have to keep that in mind for the next time I play there
---
I never said I didn‚Äôt like you, I just think you‚Äôre a liar, period. Nothing more.
---
SWF= survive with friends 
---
BPS= bloody party streamers 
---
BT = borrowed time
---
DS= decisive strike
---
OOO= object of obsession
---
Just pop the traps and be the bait. Let someone else do the rescuing.
---
Cyperess if im correct.
---
What exactly were you thinking? If you can think, if you don't mind me asking? Or do you only write down the bullshit thoughts to whatever you're reworking?
---
Aww that‚Äôs a shame although fun idea. You‚Äôll celebrate with people around the world. :D
---
I‚Äôll try catch it.
---
Being a Billy and not having good skill but having good skill on the chainsaw will only take you so far. 
---
Myers takes skill and the instadowns doesn‚Äôt happen all the time. 
---
Leatherface is a killer pure on more skill then any of those 2 which is why people think he‚Äôs the worst. Leatherface is based off your skill of map knowledge or pallet knowledge, being good at the game just in general, and knowing how to use his power right and when. 
---
Leatherface is also addon dependent and pwyf dependent. 
---
But they probably won‚Äôt touch these killers because their may be a huge uproar with the fans. 
---
Also most oneshot killers aren‚Äôt complained about. 
---
It‚Äôs mostly just billy complained about but not that much either.
---
Clearly you know you‚Äôre attractive because you post a sexy cosplay and then act surprised when people literally comment that they masterbated to this picture of you. ‚ÄúOMG guys total accident‚Äù
---
That contest winner skin will suffice for me but we do need our Bunny Feng!
---
Out of respect for your husband I wouldn‚Äôt post shit like this so other men can get off on it.
---
I assume your issue that you have with it is that you can't just buy the cosmetic, you have to pay money and you might not even get it if you pay.
---
That's totally understandable! You can wait to buy it, but I suppose there is the FOMO to worry about (idk how much that applies to this game on the killer side but i get it survivor wise) and it might be a lot of grinding for a busy person. Personally I like the idea of more tasks to do that can earn me back more stuff if I want to spend money but it's always good to hear the opinions of others :)
---
Nice you downvoted me. Very cool.
---
I think having to sacrifice a perk slot every game to avoid having a headache is much more of an imbalance than having an FOV slider.  Do killers suddenly become overpowered when they put on shadowborn?  (Hint: they don‚Äôt)
---
Yes, the tbag is a powerful ability lol
---
True, but you dont know how many games youve had where that was something that happened rather than swf
---
I mean I didnt mean to pose sexy? Am I supposed to be slouched? Twisted? I was trying to go for a more powerful overshadowing pose. And sexy? It's only a belly though?
---
So unpopular opinion but I have a love hate relationship with the clown. I love his design and animations and soundbites and everything but his powerset is ultimately undercooked.
---
That said! He can still be enjoyable provided 2 things, 1 people always underestimate him and will sometimes try to tank bottles which, if you're good at tailing in chases, is great for you. And 2, you gotta lean into the clowns core composition. He exists to break loops quickly. That's all.
---
Toss a bottle in the middle of a loop, not by the vault of the pallet, but opposite it so they have time to either be fully affected by the stun if they tank the bottle, or are forced to drop the pallet or break the loop and move on, opening you up for another bottle toss and possible hit.
---
End of the day, he isn't great, but can, in some cases, be very effective. Every killer is good if you learn their intricacies well enough!
---
Have fun, most importantly!
---
My husband is very supportive of me and my posts.
---
Lol i made that post as a joke and people honestly bombarded it with mixed opinions
---
I think I saw that ghostfaces soul leave his body at that DS lmao. He tried so hard to not get stunned by head on then got stunned anyway XD

That is likely the route all maps will take over time.  Swamp is next I believe.
---

---
Please tell me you aren‚Äôt this naive!! Oh my fucking god now you‚Äôre playing the ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to be sexy!‚Äù card. Stomachs aren‚Äôt attractive!! Omg! I‚Äôm actually done speaking to you. You‚Äôre disgusting.
---
You might enjoy my meme of him (the one he tweeted about) ;)
---
And that's bad exactly how? It used to be that if Freddy got everyone into the Dream World and had full Remember Me stacks you would be stuck doing a door for 100+ seconds, and people still got out lol.
---
A situation like that incentivizes totem cleansing, which isn't as common as people think and if the Killer runs Remember Me, it is a perk slot that isn't being used by one of the other meta perks.
---
In fact, I'd reckon most killers wouldn't run Remember Me at all and barely notice the difference.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs so proud of all the men jacking off to this picture
---
I wouldnt say how power is useless in a chase, there are cases where you can really fuck with people.
---
Petition to make a skin for him to dress like her
---
Gratz man. I know the feeling. I have been a survivor main since I bought this game last Halloween. Last weekend, I told myself, fuck it, lets give killers a try, and I always wanted to learn Spirit. And get 2 or more kills almost every match. Was rank 19 on Friday, am 14 now. :)
---
They could also just make it to were you need 3 hits (initial hit then two more feral hits) to down someone, this would make the add one that "greatly reduce deep wounds" to make the power down someone in one use (initial hit then second hit from feral" it sounds a lil op but with a few nerfs/tweeks I believe this would be a good balance to the character
---
If this is true ima be going full paranoia on gens against pig

Ok so a few things
---
1. You seem to be retreating from this a bit so I'm gonna just pose this as a direct question. Do you disagree with the notion that women should be allowed the freedom to wear whatever they themselves choose to wear? If yes then I guess we're done here, that's pretty much all I wanted I guess. If no then please explain how you're not just completely lying, because in case you've forgotten we're currently talking in a comment thread where you basically told a woman to cover up because she showed her midriff.
---
2. Being female doesn't make you immune from possessing misogynistic viewpoints, and "I'm a woman" isn't a get out of jail free card for when someone challenges those shit viewpoints.
---
3. I won't even touch that other comment you left on this post but... holy christ.
---
4. I doubt this was intended as "sexy", honestly. And the fact that each reply to a thirsty comment could just be summarised as "thank you", in my opinion only helps that point. She isn't leading people on by talking dirty or anything like that, she isn't pushing people to say more, she's just saying thank you and shutting the conversation down there. Maybe you could argue that she shouldn't reply to them at all but honestly A. If that's the best case scenario then I feel like this is probably second to that, and B. She's allowed to accept compliments and take gratification from them.
---

i just think it is not worth it.

wasting killer and both survival time time for the kill &amp; bp. or even pips.
---
just que again for more kill. you got another 4 survivors to kill.
---
most of the time, when playing as the down survivor, i wish i could kill myself in the dying state. i just want to take my bp for that match and leave asap.

You have it backwards!

Cute you are naive enough to believe that. I hope your husband finds a better woman then you.

Why is this comment beinh downvoted... As a survivor is see this happening so many times. You get hooked, killer walks away for 2 seconds and they unhook you... I mean come on
---
That one's called dedicated servers

Sad that he‚Äôs okay with this.
---
I once got 3k in a match, I'd hooked the 4th twice, put a ton of pressure onto him, chased him, had to have hit him 6/7 times, he escapes by the skin of his teeth (hatch), then gues what pops up in my messages, "gg ez".

Which perk was that?

Cream of the crop.

it is sad you take time out of your day to shame someone over a cosplay. We can be sad together!

Nice little snark remark, how about respecting people?
---
Ruin works against gen monkey survivors which just sit on gens but arent particulalry good at the game. I dont see the point in taking ruin on most killers
---
Not at all :D
---
Nice
---
I dc as survior and am a ruthless killer. Sorry.
---
Yes please... I might actually play pig other then dailies again.
---
Pyramidhead yass! üòç

OOO is a high risk perk to use, the killer can see you at more or less all times. 
---
The survivor cannot mindgame you whatsoever either
---
What does corrupt intervention do.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dkwotp/true/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
oops, i will edit that into the desc rn
---
Corrupt is half gen, 160 sec ruin. So ruin is better. If it stays more than one minute of course
---
Although I feel this game lacks jump scares because personally I rarely get killers without heartbeat
---
My blind ass read it headass horsrman.
---
It blocks off the three furthest gens from you at the start for 120 seconds
---
Thanks

I run both bc I'm really paranoid

Someone saying fuck you after a mori game is hardly that bad. If someone is pissy in postgame chat I dunno why you are speaking to them
---
We need somebody to do a full on Laura concept
---
Do you see her perks? She's obviously experienced. It's just the rank reset hit like a week ago and not everyone plays daily.
---
I personally prefer corrupt, because it guarantees  3 gens to be stopped from being worked on, so for first 120 seconds of the game, easier map pressure. Survivors could spawn on ruin and it could be a waste of a slot.
---
Its an issue with dedicated servers and the survivor escaping on their screen. Still you got a 3k i wouldnt care that much
---
lol
---
AFLAC!!
---
My two mains right now are Leatherface and wraith and honestly I have better games with LF than I do with Wraith especially as I climbed because wraiths power becomes useless vs survivors that pay attention.
---
Supernatural. Could be two survivors, Sam and Dean and a killer, perhaps a windeo or Yellow Eyes Demon or something.
---
Aesthetically, i love indoor maps, they are a site to behold when you have played on the more depressing looking maps (the farm maps and McMillan maps are so dull ). Gameplay-wise though i know my chances of surviving are up a rat's ass.
---
Lmao, Billy.. the new flight simulator. I'd play it.

Had this happen the other day. It is just a bug with the counter and I didn't have to do 6 gens.

See but thats the thing. Unlike Ash the entity would have to canonically like. Disable Dean and Sams fighting capabilities. They'd have no trouble killing something like Hag, Ghosty, Pig etc.

---
The rift itself is free, there is however an optional premium rift. 
---
And like u/Retro_Edge already said this premium rift gives you the option to get your 1000 Cells back.
---
It also works retroactive. So you can complete the free pass to the point where you would get all your cells back (I think this will most likely be near the end of the rift) and then activate the premium rift and gain every "missed" reward including your 1000 Cells, so you can make sure to just spend the 1000 Cells if you will get them back.

No one cared who I was. Until i put on the mask.

Let's go ahead and remove spirit but give the following killers these buffs

Nurse: Moves at 115% movement speed
---
Huntress: Hatchet windup is instant and she has crosshairs now
---
Hag: Now has infinite traps
---
Pig: RBT timer immediately starts when placed on a survivor, she can now collect the RBTs when removed, and they can't exit with them on
---
Legion: can now vault windows and pallets outside of frenzy at the same speed as survivors
---
Leatherface: has no terror radius
---
Billy: can move like a normal killer during his chainsaw sprint
---
Clown: also removed from the game
---

Idc which two survivors will get a place in dbd. Can be Harold from 1, James/Maria from 2 or Heather from 3.
---
But the Killer has to be Pyramid Head !
---
"Dad, please don't leave me like this! What if the boogie-man comes?"
---
The one everyone says. Pig needs rule set #2 in base kit. I think trapper should also be able yo carry 2 traps by default itll help his preperation times. Nurse needs to be changed some how for us console players cuz shes pretty booty. For legion i think they ahould just revert the feral frenzy run and vault speed it seems way to sluggish you shouldnt feel so slow when ur suppose to be sprinting. Plus it looks so weird when they vault
---
Were you in the midwest? There have been a shit ton of tornadoes in the arkansas and Missouri area tonight
---
Yeah, but it's always fun post-match to see someone talking shit and noticing they're using DS or NOED.
---
I happens all the time. It just feels like it never does when your the killer
---
It shouldnt ever hit them if they play right, its juts usually lag or them not dropping it fast enough gets you a hit.
---
Only once
---
You‚Äôre right, I was extreme confused about why someone would choose one of the weakest killers against a swf.

My issue is that you pay for a temporary progression system. Not only is a paid progression system weird on its own but the entire appeal of having challenges is thrown out the window by "Do it really fast or you wasted your money"

Ace is gorgeous. He can have a fedora. His smile is infectious.
---
I see it connect though, I've never had this problem on pc. For the most part hits on PC make sense.
---
Pallets and instheal
---
Its still plays a part in winning or losing. Theres are lot of pressure on killers to do well but also lose
---
They weren't playing right, I know a lunge when I see one because that's never happened to me before.
---
How could that even happen? There is only 1 unsafe window and occasionally a pallet.

---
And then I don't know who the killer would be, Bob I suppose. Windom Earle would be kinda cool too, but I have no clue what his abilities would be.
---
How much horse power is this?
---
Seth Gecko as a survivor.
---
Salma Hayek vampire as killer.
---
If you keep a snare up at your totem you also basically force them to spend time waking up before cleansing it
---
So the optional Remember Me perk becomes new meta. Full stacks. Plus the new unavoidable mechanic. Wake Up is now Meta. Both are now toxic because the other team blah blah.
---
Competent killers won't use it. Like the ones who don't need Ruin, or BBQ for tracking. But they knew they have you. You're not getting out. You're getting slugged while your team fails to open the doors now. If that door is opened, I would have Blood Warden. There's more than enough time, now, to set that up comfortably. 
---
This isn't Friday the 13th where you literally have a list of objectives that need to get done before you can leave. Call the cops. Find the batteries, gas cans, keys, and rotors and skill check repairs on multiple vehicles, wait out 20 minutes while Jason grows in power. Can't get anything done in time? You're dead.
---
There's already a problem finishing 5 gens if you're playing with an incompetent group, if anyone disconnects, if someone is running toxic and spoiling the game by getting the killer's attention purposely by slamming lockers or blowing skill checks near you. 
---
If you are bored with DbD, then take a break. Everyone does at some point. Right now, totems are a secondary, optional, unofficial objective. Clense for points, to go towards healing, and prevent NOED. All taking time away from the main objective of finishing the gens and powering the doors. 
---
The game works as is right now. 3 years in. That's a very long life span for a game that's not WoW or GTA Online. 
---
Creating new somewhat mandatory objectives, which if not completed will punish you, does not improve the gameplay or breath new quality of life into the title.
---
There‚Äôs a strict, consistent timing for that. You might‚Äôve just been a lil bit too late
---
Mindbreaker is even worse. How can the devs be so blind? Why would they nerf nurse and leave a perk like this in the game? Smh
---
So yesterday I was literally called "gen camper" for defending the 3gen survivors created themselves

Goddamn i miss that console. Pretty awesome tho

You go...
---
I had a survivor try to send hate for doing this at the end of the game when the exit gates where powered (100% did not hook camp before that). I just said "Dailies be like that," but I really wish people wouldn't  be so dumb about what happens when the gates are powered.
---
Yeah, I grew up with a wii so I understand
---
True
---
That issue will be resolved in the next patch
---
Someone's triggered i bet you put mori into game whenever you got rekt. Calm down baby killer
---
TOTS Studios H1 Mask, very affordable. Bear in mind though that lighting is crucial
---
killers like trapper need ruin to setup or else all 5 gens get done before a single survivor gets hit
---
This is way better than Amanda's boner into her stomach we did get
---
Bruh got me to thinking, what if we get a killer called The Pharaoh who has a Crook and Flail and is actually King Tut or Hatshepsut, or another Egyptian historical figure that died gruesomely or by betrayal or something of that sort. That shit would be dope
---
Real talk that show was amazing
---
Without ranked systems you would a lot more often get players who just bought the game when you've played it for thousands of hours. It wouldn't be fair and fun. I wouldn't mind for rank system to be hidden tho
---
Those are the ***C H A L L E N G E S***, not the Rift itself
---
I'm a huge stat nerd. I'd love for this to be a thing. I know it probably wont ever happen but that would be amazing. I would be pretty sad at the same time because if stats ever were to come out, it would have to start from scratch so my near 1000 hours wouldnt be tracked. But damn would I love that.
---
yeah and the only real nerf she got was her addons

her power is functionally exactly the same.

---
No offense, but a killer slowing down gens sounds like a good thing. As a high rank killer, gens FLY, is it so bad to have a killer in the power role that forces the survivors to slow the game down? I understand the counterplay is not fun, but like nurse, having a power role killer is important to the game imo, especially given how powerful the gen rush meta is rn.
---
people who main P3 claudette should be banned from end game chat and having an opinion in general
---
Hag, Plague, Legion, Doctor, Clown, Spirit can be bought with iridescent shards. You get them by leveling up.
---
When cosplay is better than actual character.
---
I never said anything about the them vs us mentality, i just said something about how this sub is heavily killer based, but go off
---
Also people accuse me of "being a survivor main", then here you are about a mentality barely anybody knew about
---
I am erected
---
I just don't like it when people call you names because they lose. It's rude and it doesn't encourage me to play the game.
---
Nancy played the chase extremly well but this spirit went for ZERO mindgames, aka her atleast 80% winning comdition. By the time nancy hit that stun she could read that spirit like a book it was crystal clear she would straight try to hit through that pallete. If she would have faked shit before it would have been much harder to predict if she went around or nah.  
---
AGAIN NANCY PLAYED THIS SUPER GOOD BUT:  
---
People will look at this chase again and be like AnD PeOpLe SaY SpiRiT iS tOo sTroNg... i hope ya'all dont take a below average spirit as measurement for how strong a killer is.
---
I'm talking about not being toxic without any reason. This post is more about toxic swf who play just to try to make fun of the killer rather than anything else. Just because this post is about killers doesn't mean killers can't be toxic or survivors perspective doesn't matter.
---
Get the fuck back to r/dadbydaylight I‚Äôll be seeing you soon.
---
I get what you are saying, but to be fair having a killer able to dominate this way is important for the game. People kinda forget how powerful the gen rush meta is rn. It takes 80 seconds to complete a gen alone. Game starts, each survivor goes to a different gen, if it takes the killer longer than 20 seconds to find some body, they have less that 60 seconds to down said survivor, hook them and find the next survivor. If the killer falters at any point- 3 gens pop and you screwed. I think if we go the route of nerfing spirit and nurse, the survivor side needs a look too. Either they add an additional objective that adds a light amount of time, giving the killer a little more leeway, or they introduce a ‚Äúcompetitive/ranked mode‚Äù where select survivor perks and item/addons are banned. Namely anything that increases generator repair speed. 
---
I get that people worry that a ranked mode would kill the game, as alot of casuals would stay in casual mode, but adding double bloodpoints, or auric cells as a reward would incentivize them to join in. Thats what alot of games do nowadays for their ranked mode. 
---
But, if we are going to nerf the only two killers that can beat a optimal swf team, we also have to look at doing something on the survivor side of things. You know what I‚Äôm saying?
---
So you ruin the enjoyment of everyone else instead? Way to be egoistic. Sometimes i wonder if i'm the only one enjoying playing against spirit. Especially when they bring beads. That and mirror myers are literally the only "scary" things the game has to offer. Also if you play for enjoyment and not for winning, why does it matter if it's a spirit? Spirit doesn't mean instant 4k or she is impossible to loop. Also personally i haven't seen ONE spirit using stridor since she came out. So just rock iron will and stop ruining games for other people. People like you should take the post to heart.

Check the key assigned, on PC its Ctrl by default.   Use that to put the portal on the ground.
---
To travel, you need to step on one of the portal, then look in the direction of another one in the distance. You'll see an arrow on top of the one you're aiming for. Then use Ctrl to travel.
---
Some tips : 
---
Before you "use" the portals to travel, they are invisible for survivors and they can't close it.  
---
While maintaining M2 for your charge, you'll hear a heartbeat if any survivor is currently on a portal (similar heartbeat you have when using legion power, showing nearby survivors)  It's pretty useful to guard hex totem without them noticing.

You understand the there are tournaments that use DBD, which makes it an e-sport...

I shouldn't have to run Iron Will to have a chance against a red rank Spirit but such is life.  Both sides experience this.  I'd almost be willing to bet money you're okay with that one though.

plus it's the best cosmetic in the game, the way the hair moves is just n e a t

Mindgames work on bad survivors or a mistake but if they are teching the loop perfectly like has been tested and proven and not taking a risk or making a mistake then all major tiles are safe.

---
Ruin feels just RNG at this point I'd use corrupt if I could ever get it for my killers
---
It depends on the killer. As plague, you don't want to take off enduring spirit fury but at the same time you can't run 2 perks like pop and corrupt, because you won't be able to use bbq. Other killers are also kinda perk reliant like Huntress with whispers and possibly shadowborn. 
---
My opinion is why you always need ruin is because at the start of the game you literally have 0 pressure. You have 4 people working on gens, compared to only 1 person working on gens when you have someone hooked, an altruistic person and a person chased. Every person misses a skillcheck every once in a while, and there is a chance that multiple people will get off gens to search for ruin. Using corrupt will make people super immersed and you can't find everyone at the same time. If you do succeed in finding a person that's hiding, the other 3 survivors will have already walked past you and will be doing gens without ruin while you chase someone. Ruin did it's job if you down a person while the perk is up, it's the time bought you need to get rolling an have only 1 person doing gens(1 on hook, 1 in chase, and 1 saving)
---
But kindred trumps any of the killers stealth abilities

Idk, i just know for sure there are more survivors than killers in the game (ratio 4:1). If this subreddit is killer sided, well, idk about that. Most people play both sides though (as me), and can understand both perspectives, which is the best way to see things. Regards.
---
Sebastian Castellanos and either The Keeper, The Sadist, or Laura Reborn from Evil Within. 
---
Also Beacon Mental Hospital could make a great map.
---
That would be amazing tbh.
---
This is why you should equip Spine Chill. This trickster won't be able to fool you.

Mhm, kindred's been like that since the beginning because I'm fairly certain it's original purpose was to be an insidious counter, the only thing that changed was going from  1survivor/all survivors/All survivors and killer within 8 meters of the hook to All survivors and the killer if they're 8/12/16 meters out. But it does specify on the perk. "Trumps any of the killer's stealth abilities."
---
Not gonna lie, I found the use of the word "optimal" to be a little bit ironic because you went into the match as a 3 perk killer.  Monitor &amp; Abuse doesn't do anything on Freddy because he doesn't have a terror radius he has a lullaby.  You might want to swap that bad boy out with something that functions so you can be an "optimal" Freddy.
---
I play both sides. I seriously do and this is just my experience so nobody get butthurt and offended if my personal experience isn't yours. Survivors are often more of an asshole when it's post game when you're a killer than the killer being a dick there but often times the killer has more agency to be a dick in game (not counting 3/4 man swfs)
---
If you're a solo survivor player like me you know the pain of getting bad teams and being camped, tunneled, and destroyed by strong killers vs if you're a killer main you know the bullshit you have to read if you sit in a post game after you 4k'd. 
---
I also think being a killer is more frustrating when you lose than when you lose as a survivor.
---
The powerful add-ons should feel strong but actually be quite fair that's why I like this nurse add-on rework bc her risk reward is actually present unlike before. 
---
You want 3 blinks? Well okay but now you can't go through walls.
---
You want more range? Okay well now you have a longer charge.
---
Things that make her more balanced bc imo only unfun nurse to play against was a nurse with more than 2 blinks and Omega range I personally never use add-ons on nurse after I learnt how unfun it was and just how often I'd never get a game but she still works.
---
That's how all killers should be ofc their add-ons can directly upgrade the power if you look at wraith but doesn't that question should lower tier killers be able to use add-ons to directly upgrade their powers and then why can't that be the fact for everyone?
---
Just a thought
---
i like how the trapper is looking back like he‚Äôs about to turn off the a/c just for your nightlight
---
This made my night a bit better! Doing a double shift for my job. Working from 3pm-7am, it's almost 5am here though so luckily almost done.
---
r/oddlyspecific
---
Bubba literally has like a 20 minute scene in his film dedicated to his poor table manners.
---
Only one doing gens. And getting trolled by r\*tarded swf when you froce through 1 gen and use lockers to hide(cuz headon) get gen to like 96% when killer kicks it everytime. While ruin is active.
---
P.S. Got bodyblocked and trolled cuz i refuse to give a hatchto some swf re\*ard  and try to do gen . Also other tactic make noise with shift and vault to keep killer on 1 side of the map. Getbkiller so pissed of by my toxic douche tricks that he ignores 5 generators with ruin(which you can\`t get cuz ToTH + hag tp addon). Get still trolled "cuz you did no work" see them get hit with no ed and die. Escape through a hatch XD
---
P.S.2. I think that all SFW should be marked with a icon in the beginning of the game.(if it would be to me, i would give a killer an auto ebony everytime when SWF group in the game. I hate those useless toxic a-holes. And i only play survivor. Can\`t imagine what it is like to a killer main)
---
&gt;Are they immune to getting hit when de-hooking someone? I'd hit them while de-hooking or just off the hook and they would just run away full hp.
---
The hooked Survivor is immune to damage until the unhook animation finishes so the Killer can't just smack them and they have zero chance to do anything to avoid it, hit the Survivor trying to unhook instead.
---
&gt;Also when carrying one they all just surrounded me and I'd not be able to move or hook and drop who I was carrying? What?
---
You can still hit them while carrying a Survivor
---
Again, Fire Up or NOED. Besides the first trap goes on totem anyway so not really setting up, if they‚Äôre effective Gen Rushing will happen regardless, without a Ruin to worry about you don‚Äôt need to guard totems and just look for survivors. If it‚Äôs a bad start and three people did three Gens, the likelihood of them three-gemming themselves is pretty high and you already have a hook. You can already turn the game around easily, if you‚Äôre comfortable leaving hook put traps around remaining Gens and guard the last Gens and the game is going to be yours. In their rush Survivors don‚Äôt realize they either crowd themself in middle or to a corner.
---
&gt;friends   
---
Friends was hilarious wtf.
---
How did the rest of the match turn out.
---
The aura reading capability of survivors is increased, only open-handed gives you it I think
---
I usually hear them because of the grass moving. You know it's different cause it doesn't match up with your steps
---
Rule 34: if it exists there is porn of it
---
It's not bhj, it's an antimeme
---
let's go one by one
---
Third Seal: For how long? Why is it even restricted this way (last x hit)? How much of a buff? 
---
Ruin: Yea, so when all 4 survivors have it, it's -20%? It should at least be radius-based
---
Devour Hope: So, after two token you get a movement speed whenever someone gets hooked. At three you get a permanent buff and at five you get another effect whenever someone gets hooked? This doesn't make much sense. Why isn't 5token something else, but permanent, or 3token also a hook based for consistency?
---
I hope you'll be up there again soon (not meant as a troll. I really hope you'll feel better again)
---
Corrupt. I don't trust totem spawns lol
---
It just goes back to what it originally was, but also lets you mend yourself
---
Shhhh
---
Dracula was my favorite character
---
Lots and lots of  balance changes to help out killer over the past year.  If you used to play a lot of killer you're in for a treat, it's got a lot more manageable than it used to be.  They lost nearly all their cheese and broken mechanics and they're about to lose instaheals shortly which will be helpful against swf's.  All they pretty much have cheese wise at this point is keys and Haddonfield.
---
henlo
---
It does function the same way, it's not like it's a glitch - Freddy has no conventional TR in dream so OoO works accordingly.
---
Not that I'd be against a nerf for the perk as a Hag main lol, but this isn't an accident.
---
This is so cool lmao I love it
---
Pretty good job so far
---
The perk has its downsides, freddy gets several unique advanatages given his abilties its not so bad he also gets some weaknesses
---
I don't think you can mod it via steam.
---
You can replace the files on PC tho
---
You didn't have too.  Anyone with arms and ears is going to 4K with all that crutch.  Pretty sure the devs would have made you uninstall if you didn't.
---
If survivors are decent is useless
---
interesting, I don‚Äôt think he has as much mindgame potential so it‚Äôs harder for him to get hits in even with this EW3. plus his power doesn‚Äôt give him any added speed so his map pressure isn‚Äôt as strong
---
Love these movies. This would be awesome.
---
Indeed. I do think that most Ace are either memey (but not toxic) players, just here for the lols, or very sweaty (but again, not toxic) players, because Ace is one of the best survivors in terms of noise, especially injured grunts, so it's a good pick for optimal players.
---
Pretty far so far
---
Wrong.
---
sooo the entire resident evil bosses line up lol
---
I would love Pig to get a little rework.
---
You don't get it , people aren't insisting on hearing your method, it's fine if you don't wanna say what it is. The problem is that you made a comment , showing it off and then stating that you'd rather not say what it was , effectively rendering the comment pointless in the first place , basically saying something to the effect of "Well I know this cool thing but I don't think I'm gonna talk about it" , are you catching my drift here?
---
doesn't stack
---
I have to disagree heavily
---
I appreciate what you want to accomplish in trying to extend games but this is unbalanced as all hell.  Good killers would steamroll survivors.  It just wouldn't work.
---
**If I ever see this in front of your house, I'm gonna knock on your door and leave a mean comment.**
---
Killer good survivor bad
---
Yeah. And those people who like to pay a full game and DLCs to only play one side are usually the biggest issue. You can't understand the other side perspective if you're a "killer/survivor main".
---
Having preferences is fine, but people should really give the other side a try. Also mandatory if you want to get better at the game, you can't learn how to beat the other side properly without playing it.
---
'cause it's Jane
---
I actually haven't noticed that much lag
---
I'd love that
---
A lot of it is the ‚ÄúPower Complex‚Äù that comes with the nature of the game. 
---
A lot of toxic players will act the way they do because they feel ‚Äòin control‚Äô over another person, much like a typical schoolyard Bully or manchild who is getting harassed by parents/friends/boss/etc
---
I‚Äôll admit, I had a period of like 3 months where I was always super toxic and tilted at this game back in 2017. I was so verbally abusive and mean/toxic to people because I didn‚Äôt like my job at the time, and just venting that anger out into faceless 3D characters was something that felt good to me. 
---
Obviously as time passed I realized that was a stupid and childish way to deal with my anger, so I quit my job and stopped playing DbD for a while. Came back to it after a few months, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve raged at a game/player since.
---
It‚Äôs safe to say anyone being overly toxic/vulgar/offensive is either a young dumb kid, or a shitty adult being shitty for no reason. It‚Äôs a Horror Video Game. If you aren‚Äôt having fun, don‚Äôt play.
---
Just like survivors are "obliged" to run Adrenaline, Decisive, Dead Hard and other strong perks?
---
Dropped pallet on killer immediately after I got picked up, body blocked as we were running off. Always a good feeling when randos help ^_^

thats not an attempt its an absolute win

Fair enough, I meant no offence
---
So I was really trying to be nice with the last response but honestly man how do you think this is a good idea?  Seriously man how? 
---
I'm already quite good at pressuring gens in my games and ending them with a gen or more up and now you want to give me the ability to face survivors who aren't even allowed to begin a gen repair until they find and install an item from around the map into it?  On top of that there's only 3 which means it's impossible for the 4th to attempt a gen without doubling up.  On top of that and this one is a doosie, the gas can counts as an item held meaning any item they brought into the match has to be abandoned in order for them to even be allowed to begin their primary objective and only means for a team escape?  If I have to explain to you how frightfully unbalanced for survivors this entire suggestion is I'd definitely question your experience playing this game.  This has fresh off the boat player written all over it.
---
Seriously guys can anyone here even imagine playing a Spirit or Freddy with this shit in place?  
---
There's your citation man.

I managed to get 3 dailies for trapper after clearing some clown one and it da changed them too
---
*God this perk build sucks*
---
They hate spirit because reddit told them to lol
---
Im not making a us vs them (2nd accusation so far) im just here to express my opinion
---
Savage.
---
Bruh this make it so it instantly DC's a player. Killer or survivor.
---
They said they only brought insta-heals cause of spirit despite the fact that they don't know what killer they go against.. They then told me they "wouldn't use insta-heals if it wasn't spirit"... of course(?)
---
As u/MollyTheDestroyer appears to be a novice Demogorgon, it might be worth clarifying that the "Killer Instinct" detection (what you're referring to as a "heartbeat") only works for *activated* portals.
---
If OP puts a portal near a Hex totem and never uses the portal, then they'll never see anything when they use Of the Abyss.
---
  I love how everyone is talking about the "us vs them" mentality you have and you actively continue to prove it. When people talk about gen rushing, camping or any other toxic behaviors that take away from the game. At least those of us who play both sides are looking at the devs.
---
Because most of us are fine with 4 escape killer games or being sacrificed. What we aren't okay with is the players of the game have evolved while the gameplay stagnated, the generators are NOT enough gameplay, punishments for overly toxic behavior is so mild it's insignificant
---
Camp hooks all game -4 chaser. Like no. That's why we say be decent to each other because the dev's are not decent to us. It takes them years at a time to address anything. Freddy has been broken since late 2017 and they JUST got around to reworking him. So if you could kindly turn down that self centered egotism, it would be appreciated.
---
The mask looks AMAZING! Every pig mask I saw online was really weird looking but yours is on point!
---
And you're hot. rly. I'd kill for a body like that.
---
*And I have weird lesbian feelings right now so I'm gonna just stop writing.* *^(ok bye)*
---
It's down to a person by person basis. As survivor you can tell when it's a new killer so I personally let them practice chases on me and give them a free hook for points. As killer for newbies I go for fun over all else and give them a chance to have that
---
I mean noed spirit is noed spirit...
---
Survivors without perks are stronger than killers without perks tho????
---
They have a bigger frame and clothes that don't blend as well
---
Just be a toxic tryhard, you're a killer act like one! You don't owe survivors anything! It's obvious they don't care about you...
---
Change that to 60% camouflage, 20% perks and 20% actually liking the character
---
SEXEH
---
When you don't have a dad and read these posts, feels bad
---
Im sorry but i do not speak aviation animal
---
You're here to be an asshole and start fights.
---
I absolutely LOVE doing something like that,I think this game could be so much more interesting if we have roleplay or even better,an actual roleplaying feature ingame!
---
Gameplay wise he's a crippled Billy, don't bother actually playing him and just level him up for the teachable perks since those are pretty good
---
Wow, some people are desperate for DbD porn.
---
There was just a rough, pen and paper sketch someone made in like 10 minutes and the comments are like **unngghhhh fuckkkkkk so hot**
---
I think it is for the majority of the time, assuming the ranking system is actually pairing rank 20s together.  
---
Many rank 20s are just experimenting with different tactics and strategies or just desensitizing themselves from the killers presence. There‚Äôs a learning curve.
---
First of all, rank doesn't matter, it's not corresponding with skill, so you can stop trying to flex your rank 1 at me every chance you get.
---
&gt; Most of the ones I play against are Russian, which is even worse, because you're in for an entire game of soft camping and patrolling.
---
Nice, just throw in some casual racism to validate your non-existing argument.
---
**HINT** Your nationality doesn't influence your playstyle.
---
&gt; If it's not a favorable map and I see Ruin, I just don't play the match.
---
People like you just need to get a lifetime ban. You ruin everybody's experience because you can't deal with a certain killer.
---
Here i have an idea. If you can't deal with the current meta, how about you stop playing the game? 
---
&gt; If you think these players aren't a problem, you are absolutely welcome to come play with me on the EU side.
---
Yep, i do think they aren't a problem. They are just playing the game, they aren't breaking any rules, they aren't doing anything toxic (atleast most of the time for me). The only issue i see is you being a little bitch.
---
Just FYI, i also played at rank 1, and i am mostly at red ranks on killer side. On survivor side i stay in purple ranks, 'cause i simply don't have the time to play that much. Afterall the current ranking system is more of a timesink than a showcase of skill. 
---
&gt; you are absolutely welcome to come play with me on the EU side.
---
I kindly have to refuse that offer, because i'm not interested in playing with somebody who DC's whenever he doesn't face a killer he doesn't like. I'm here to have fun and i can have it even when facing meta killers. :)
---
God, doesn‚Äôt anybody knock when I‚Äôm trying to *Self-Care?*

Thanks! Same im a prop maker too. It definitly isnt hard, but i want to keep it light weight. So probably wont add leds

Amos Burton from the Expanse as Survivor.
---
The Protomolecule as Killer.
---
Cant wait for season4.
---
You probably just ran into survivor bs, there's a lot of that in the game
---
If you wanna have fun, play survivor, if you want a challenge, play killer
---
*ggez bad boy I bet you pee pee on the fuckin rug lmao go choke on a piece of plastic you mutt*
---
Then everyone could see scratch marks just as well and they could be tuned to be not too strong. You're meant to be able to see scratch marks, that's why they're a thing.
---
Yeah, 20-30 seconds is my limit before I just move onto a new player. I‚Äôd rather pick off the easier/potato ones than spend 6 minutes straight chasing one good player.
---
Imagine whining that survivors are people too and then talking down to anyone who counters you by saying shit like "You don't know how to apply pressure." JUST IMAGINE BEGGING FOR KINDNESS SO YOU CAN BE A DICK
---
Probably a new Spirit player then.
---
You can try but it‚Äôs not gonna help when you go from Kill By Your Own Hand As The Cannibal to Downs With Chainsaw As The Cannibal.

Boomers be like

Same for me, first time I played it was rough and I totally ditched I won‚Äôt lie, but I got back into it and I‚Äôm really close to getting spirit level 50 but even then I sorta don‚Äôt know how to play her, I‚Äôm not a very good killer but I‚Äôm alright but the rank rises too quick and I‚Äôm either dominating or getting ran in circles all game.
---
I feel the same way but about legion (spirit is fine for me because I often run spine chill and/or iron will so I‚Äôm one of the lucky ones when I find her), sitting there bloody mending is so boring. All 4 survivors can escape so easily against him but it‚Äôs BORING and too long. I don‚Äôt DC but holy crap I always stop playing after I find one legion.

I finally got the Evil Incarnate achievement!!! I'm so proud of myself. I thought the hardest part would be getting Evil Within to tier 3 with both Fragrant tuft of hair and Judith's tombstone making it so much harder, but it turned out that the hardest part was actually trying not to accidentally lunge attack instead of quick attacking to mori survivors. Multiple times I've lunge attacked by accident, with one time even on the last remaining survivor. I dribbled him to let him wiggle out of my grasp but then he somehow just ran away and disappeared from my sight. I couldn't find him but he couldn't open the gate either and the endgame collapse got him instead. I was so mad and frustrated after that game but luckily the next game after that was when I managed to mori all 4 survivors and finally got the achievement üòä

I agree with you, but that's how society works, everyone lies to get what they want and the same girls that show their body also complain about being objectified. It's pretty stupid, can't do much about it, everyone is shy now and scared of reality. This cosplay was low effort low cost, but Hey, she looks sexy so gets upvotes gold and silver and all that shit
---
As a survivor main I never understood the logic. Like if we're all at the hook in plain site, what did you expect to happen? ...You see stupid shit more when you play from both sides.
---
"I agree with this man"
---
Where's ma Pig??
---
&gt;There isnt really any way to fix this either
---
Only if we had tutorials to hel- oh wait we do.
---
Sadly they're bare bones as hell and BHVR probably has improving them as a very very very low priority which means probably never unless enough people complain to get it done.
---
Sounds good in theory but how do you know if some punk won't blow the fun for everyone?
---
Harry or eddie would make the most sense since they are dead. Pyramid head would never work as a killer, far too slow even if they were to ditch the great knife, James would still outrun them with a light jog lmao. As for killer, I think something like the missionary/Leonard/walter would make more sense
---
Wow, epic. TY bhvr very cool
---
That picture makes my neck hurt
---
I hope you feel better soon
---
I‚Äôve been playing well over a year.  If you honestly think that the speed of games currently is in a healthy state I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.  Survivors could always go back to their items.  As it stands the role that needs to be more powerful to match a team of 4 just isn‚Äôt.  I‚Äôve seen the changes to try and ‚Äúbalance‚Äù and they are all very survivor-sided.  Obviously there would be more changes with a gameplay overhaul like this, but the current state is letting everything slowly atrophy.  Especially with matchmaking as it currently is and red rank survivors are consistently paired against purple and green it is a shitshow.
---
Facecamping would still be easily stuffed.  Just give survivors more time on the hook.  Items aren‚Äôt eliminated, but they can‚Äôt always be on hand.  Team coordination is more rewarded.  Obviously there would be more to these changes than what I would outline in a brief reddit post to share an idea.
---
I‚Äôm all for critique; obviously the idea needs work.  The toxic mindset though of ‚Äúthat would never work just force it in the current system‚Äù is detrimental.  I‚Äôve had too many friends stop playing the game because it‚Äôs either tedious and boring as a survivor or it‚Äôs a sloppy mess as a killer.  Again, if you are red ranked (which I assume you have to be based on how you say your games go) you don‚Äôt have a universal experience.  I‚Äôm just trying to generate dialogue on how to fix the current pace, because nothing the devs have done to fix it (which is exactly what they‚Äôre trying to do with perks like Thrilling Tremors and Corrupt Intervention) actually address the root issue: gens go too fast and games don‚Äôt last.  my proposal doesn‚Äôt remove the ability to do gens quickly, just to do all gens quickly.  If you‚Äôre going to take the time to comment you might as well actually offer criticism.  If you just think it‚Äôs a shit idea downvote and move on.
---
These posts fill my life with joy, thank you sir
---
Yeah he‚Äôs bad, probably the worst killer in the game. You can only use his chainsaw if you‚Äôre up inside the survivors asses
---
Genuinely sick of seeing this shit being brought up
---
Disguise killer will never happen because they will never work effectively. Stop. Just stop.
---
Really? All all Halloween movies after H2O are ass. Stoaked for a skin for Myers, especially since its from the original.
---
Criticism isn‚Äôt just saying line by line that you think it‚Äôs bad.  It is also critiquing and engaging with the ideas: ‚Äúthat wouldn‚Äôt work unless you changed this too,‚Äù ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not a good idea but this might be more what would work.‚Äù  I‚Äôm not exactly sure how you can cite exact examples either when the original idea is pretty vague because obviously it can‚Äôt be specific without playstesting.  It‚Äôs just brainstorming.  Your examples of how it would impact also amount to ‚Äúface camping would be bad,‚Äù which is not exactly specific.  Again, if you think it‚Äôs a shit idea just downvote and move on.
---
You have any idea how many people already suggested that?
---
I'm sorry to that one bubba I started a sabothon against. When I saved a few randos with hook drops they found toolboxes and joined in , then we all slugged out of the exit together.
---
Add in horseless and we got one spooky boi
---
What do they consider weakest killer and weakest map?
---
That's definitely just a you problem Bubba is OP af basically just a mindless 4K machine throughout all ranks....
---
Nah I'm just fucking with you that man is straight trash.  He's difficult to play and do consistently well with due to how ineffective his chainsaw typically is during chase.  It's really only strong in open areas away from all defenses which isn't super common to catch survivors at period.  
---
I'm always genuinely impressed when I face a good Bubba player.  You don't see it often since they're so easy to loop so I have nothing but respect when I face the rare one that takes control of a game.
---
Do it with Spirit and you'll reach frontpage. Nurse is about to get a rework so it's not the most hated character anymore (Spirit is).
---
Because that states that games Are Killer favoured at the Moment. Simple
---
This is the kind of meme you get right after you scroll past it
---
So many internet warriors here! I think y'all just mad because he gets paid to play the game and you guys have to work your ass off. May be wrong don't punish me warriors of the internet!!
---
That didn‚Äôt answer my question at all.  Getting one kill is still pretty bad, and they consider getting two kills to be a tie.  I‚Äôd be interested to know what an individual‚Äôs survival percentages are.
---
He needs a nerf tbh
---
You don't need to adapt when you play survivor, if you suck at looping you have the option to hide and sometimes is ever better.
---
Well. If the killrate is 51% the average survivor survivors 49/100 vs  the worst killer.
---
I told you exactly why it doesn't work and it was a hell of a lot more than just the facecamping buff you're offering up.  The gen pressure is way too impactful and free af, the absurd unbalance in forcing survivors to abandon their items to participate in gameplay, the fact all gen pressure killers would have a field day against survivors.
---
Your definition of criticism is telling me I'm supposed to tell you how to make this idea work.  I'm telling you that it doesn't work and why it doesn't.  I have absolutely nothing to suggest in making this any less poorly constructed a mechanic.  It's just a bad proposal and for all the reasons concisely specified.  It doesn't cease to be detailed criticism because I didn't tell you how to salvage this idea.  I'm telling you it can't be salvaged.  It's fundamentally flawed as a concept.
---
He was one of the first Dbd streamers
---
Play both sides and hate yourself, easy.
---
Yknow I hear Tru3 copied Ninja and wrote his own book, I found the cover art:
---
Tru3's new book https://imgur.com/gallery/4nQs2AW
---
&gt; it's not corresponding with skill
---
So a rank 20 is just as good? A rank 10 is just as good? I have my doubts.
---
&gt; Nice, just throw in some casual racism to validate your non-existing argument. HINT Your nationality doesn't influence your playstyle.
---
Dubiously noted. Strange how every single Russian profile has a massive amount of comments regarding tunneling/camping. Strange how there's a "typical Russian" comment in every single one of their profiles. But what would I know? I'm just a racist.
---
&gt; You ruin everybody's experience because you can't deal with a certain killer.
---
I can deal with Spirit just fine. I rather wouldn't. Again, you act like I DC against every single Spirit. If I did, I wouldn't have enough pips to be maxed out.
---
&gt;  I'm here to have fun 
---
&gt;  On survivor side i stay in purple ranks
---
Right. Casual, got it. You have 400 hours in the game. I should probably take lessons from you because in 2000 hours I probably don't know how to play against Spirit. I'm just a baby survivor who DCs when I don't get my way. I only run pink insta-heals and when I play killer, I only play Nurse/Spirit and lag switch if the game doesn't go in my favor. I blame a nationality that has absolutely zero reputation as toxic.
---
&gt; If you can't deal with the current meta, how about you stop playing the game?
---
I try but no matter what I do, I always come back. Again, I'm not sure why you think I'm not good against Spirit. I am. I know what to do vs Nurse too. Do I want to play against them? Absolutely not. Teammate lasts for a whopping 2 seconds in a chase? No thanks, not going to play this one out. I get hooked and see a gen tapping Claudette, somebody is already in a chase, and the other person is running around looking for Ruin? No thanks. I'll just go to struggle phase. Omega blink Nurse? Enjoy your DC points. Iri Head Hatchets? Nah.
---
&gt; I'm here to have fun
---
You nailed this one right on the head.
---
Yes but the devs are not known for their "balanced" updates. Scratches fade away and are faint unless in chase. So if the updated them in a bad way then it would be impossible to sprint in the map without being tracked
---
The killer I see the most is Huntress lol
---
I enjoy watching his streams, but he does complain a lot. Unless he pulls a 4k, he will almost always have something to complain about and it gets tiring.
---
There is nothing wrong with her, they haven‚Äôt toucher her since a small buff after release. If she was broken they would‚Äôve changed her, it‚Äôs not that hard to beat her it‚Äôs just about mind gaming
---
What's impressive about this? That animal has no eyes or ears?
---
I believe it's the d-pad?
---
Maybe dpad :/
---
Again, you‚Äôre not actually answering my questions.  I understand based on their claim how the fraction would shake out.  I‚Äôm curious what they consider the worst killer and the worst map to be.  When I say individual survival rates it‚Äôs not exactly a 1:1 because a killer has to kill 4 survivors vs. a survivor just needing to escape themselves.  I guess I also am curious how that breaks down by rank, once you account for the outliers in the 17-20 ranks, but I didn‚Äôt actually say that before.
---
I only know how to wave and beckon, if those are the ones you want on Xbox it's on the d-pad, think it's up and down.
---
Alright, I‚Äôll try that, thanks dude.
---
Thanks all of you, I‚Äôll try lol.
---
I was playing a game as a survivor yesterday, after playing a whole day as killers ( I was trying out Myers) and I had so much fun that game, it wasn't "get down and instahooked"
---
We actually had a chance to survive. I wiggled out from the killers grasp sometimes, and I got to use my decisve strike, and my balanced landing. My friend and I were laughing cuz he was healing and saw me look in like a Billy, going that fast running from the killer lol. After the match, I decided to message the killer "ggs, that was fun"
---
Little did I know he was toxic. It ruined that while match for me.
---
but what would be the point? do you think exit gate opening times are too short? just curious honestly
---
I'm currently learning Billy and honestly there are sooooo many perks I want to run that it's impossible for me to have space for all of them. Enduring + spirit fury, monitor + infectious fright, whispers, nurses, BBQ, ruin... There's no way I'll consider noed when it's simply redundant on him and there's already a ton of perks I want to run.
---
Think for accuracy to the movie, I am missing a pocket on the overalls and his hair needs a touch up properly. Thanks for the comments though.
---
Good idea!
---
I think you took it too personal.. I mean.. he also pointed out counters and how to play against
---
I'm not sure about collisions since BHVR coders are potatoes with arms and legs. I think spirit is fine as it is, the only thing I would change is prayer beads, that's it
---
Nobody said anything for over a year and only now people are crying and DC against her like crybabies, just because they wanna use the same perks they use for everyone else and they won't use obv good perks against her, AND every other killer able to hear
---
Still. I don't think you got it what bricky meant. He wanna make her slightly harder but still strong. I'm against collision change because would just make her buggy I think, except that I won't mind those changes. Ultra rare prayer? Good, idc, I barely use it anyway and perform just fine
---
Grunts Omni directional is okayish I guess. I mean.. I don't even use headphones to play killer, just tracking by prediction and scratch marks is possible. But still, I won't even touch that tbh, they fuck up sounds 9/10 of the time for Killers anyway..
---
Btw I think you've focused too much on the changes he proposed while he also said how to counter spirit 101 which I totally agree. As well I share the surprise with him, how only recently people hate spirit for no apparent reason after 1 year without any change.
---
Bubba kills to protect his family, it‚Äôs his job. Any outsiders are dead as far as he is concerned. He would not give anyone other than his family a shred of mercy. Wraith is purely a victim, forced to kill for the Entity. He never knew he was killing people and the most he did was murder his boss in a fit of rage, which was justified. He‚Äôs a poor soul who would probably let survivors go if he was able to.
---
Not gunna lie i'm a bit scared, he said at one point "if you are a very active player you can get everything back" does this mean it's going to be a hard/super time consuming grind? 
---
I don't mind grind but also have other commitments.
---
And what's wrong with mori's
---
Free gen pressure is not a thing.  That‚Äôs like saying you have free gen pressure now because they all start with no progress.  If you make something the new default that‚Äôs just what it is, and you can change balance of some killer powers around it.
---
You could have literally one survivor not use an item with the proposed system.  It would be a one-time initial investment, and it could be a thing to do besides hold M1.  I‚Äôd welcome the gameplay variety.
---
‚ÄúGen pressure killers‚Äù you mean all killers?  Because that‚Äôs what a killer does: kill survivors and pressure gens.  Hell, with gens not starting immediately you wouldn‚Äôt have as easy of a time even finding a survivor right of the bat.  No more loading into a game and Discord popping of in the first five seconds.  It would change the entire pace of the game.  You cannot just apply current meta concepts to it; of course they won‚Äôt mesh.  I had a counter argument for all your issues with it.
---
I‚Äôm not saying you need to fix any ideas.  I just cannot fathom why you would take the time to comment repeatedly if all you have to say is ‚Äúthat idea‚Äôs stupid.‚Äù  If you think it‚Äôs broken why bother engaging with it at all beyond voting?  When comment it implies you have some sort of interest in the post and idea beyond ‚Äúit‚Äôs shit.‚Äù
---
My general rule is that begging=50/50 chance, offering an item is a 100% chance.
---
&gt; So a rank 20 is just as good? A rank 10 is just as good? I have my doubts.
---
That's not what i said, read my comment again or watch the video scott jund made a while back ago talking about exactly that.
---
Short-version: People in Green/Purple Ranks perform usually better than people in Red ranks do, geez i wonder why?
---
Maybe it has something to do because red ranks are filled to the brim with elitist and pseudo pro's that DC everytime something doesn't go their way.
---
&gt; But what would I know? I'm just a racist.
---
I like the reverse victim card you try to play here, but that still doesn't give your argument any power. I've actually made it a hobby of collecting "tunnel/camping" comments on my profile, because salty survivors accuse you of that regardless if you did it or not. You want prove? Just watch ANY killer streamer or youtuber in existence and look at the post game chats they get. :)
---
&gt; Strange how every single Russian profile has a massive amount of comments regarding tunneling/camping.
---
That's what someone would call selective perception and it seems you have a very severe case of it.
---
Again: **nationality doesn't define your playstyle.**
---
&gt; I'm just a baby survivor who DCs when I don't get my way. I only run pink insta-heals and when I play killer, I only play Nurse/Spirit and lag switch if the game doesn't go in my favor.
---
Again trying to paint yourself as the victim, it doesn't further the cause of the argument and just shows your are as unreasonable and shallow as your pseudo arguments you've listed so far.
---
&gt; Again, I'm not sure why you think I'm not good against Spirit.
---
I never said you couldn't. I meant "can't deal" as in psychologically, if it upsets you so much you ruin everybody else's fun then maybe you shouldn't play it, it's that simple.
---
&gt;  Teammate lasts for a whopping 2 seconds in a chase? No thanks, not going to play this one out. I get hooked and see a gen tapping Claudette, somebody is already in a chase, and the other person is running around looking for Ruin? No thanks. I'll just go to struggle phase. Omega blink Nurse? Enjoy your DC points. Iri Head Hatchets? Nah. 
---
At this point you are just recking yourself, aren't you? As i said before, BHRV should just enforce harsher punishments for behaviour like that.
---
Let me take a wild guess aswell, you also DC if someone else DC's right?
---
And then having perks survivors can turn off.
---
Got a swf and killed 3 but one lived, it was a nea who was trying her arse off with attempting 360s, trying to juke me at every possible chance and failing miserably' but I am the definition of baby killer so I missed most of my attacks but still hit her a few good times. I downed her a few times but her team had to save her. She got out and tea bagged and in the end game chat she said: EZ BABY KILLER U TRASH
---
Like, stfu it wasn't easy for you, I could see the sweat dripping out of my monitor after that message. Hate people that say stuff is easy but they try so heccing hard.     
---
Sorry for rant  :„Äã
---
Ruin is better if it lasts longer than a minute, problem is that it can be cleansed whitin the first 10 seconds or survivor can just hit red skillchecks(i do that more instead looking for a totem)
---
Ermm ok bit obvious
---
Are you really asking that? i just explained it omfg
---
That‚Äôs too bad.  Without them giving us much more to go off of it‚Äôs not that useful.

I'm not going to go in circles with you on this anymore.  I've told you point blank why it doesn't work.  You are just looking for validation that your idea can work not all ideas can some are just objectively flawed to the core as this one demonstrates.  I'll let you hear it from the others though because you don't want to hear it from me and I sincerely doubt you are going to find many people to support your proposal.  Best of luck though enjoy your thread.
---
Bm when there's 4 of you vs 1 if me and I'm going to make sure you die. That will be my only goal for the rest of the match.
---
That's correct, your sensitivity is MUCH higher during the first second or so. I'm currently in the process of learning Billy so I'm no expert but from what I've seen so far it seems like moving your mouse during the half-second ish before your even start sprinting affects your start as well, presumably because you have some sort of angular momentum that carries over. So my trick that I've adopted to deal with that has been to lift my mouse right before I'm ready to sprint and then use hotkeys to turn.
---
He is basically the worst killer in the game, don't forget that when you play LF. On the other hand there is few mistakes I've seen from new LFs such as:

1. Relying on their chainsaws too much. Don't do that. You need to know when to M1 and when to use chainsaw. If you rev it every time, especially on the safe loops, around way to many objects and sharp corners you might end up hitting the object instead of the survivor and that tantrum fucks him over.
---
2. This is kinda correlated with the first one, due to the chainsaw usage on loops. Most LFs I play against starts revving chainsaws on the loops, knowing that they are gonna instantly break the pallet. But survivors who know this might loop you more than they should've. Best advice I can give is either M1 or act like you are revving your chainsaw, immediately stop and move forward, if they are not dropping pallets, you can at least get a free hit.
---
3. Also be careful when you use your chainsaw. You need to be on top of them. Also don't let go early thinking that you already revved it.
---
These are the most common mistakes I've seen when I play agianst LFs. About not finding people (reminder: he is the worst killer) one or two perks might solve this problem I think (you already have BBQ so another perk should be enough). I hope this helps.
---
Yes how dare he disrespect legion when legion is clearly the second best next to pig
---
Someone added to much blood to the web.
---
I know it's not THAT high but I've had people run into my sprints as high as rank 6-7
---
What's wrong with using it when you get rekt though
---
Because it's unfair and you can win without them
---
How many hours you got in game?
---
They do!
---
So running OoO just gives me a 100% winrate? Nice, i've gotta try that. /s

2.2 if you want to be more accurate
---
I plan on Streaming Myers dressed as Myers.
---
This isn't were I parked my car?
---
As I said, I have never played spirit, so forgive me if I type any mistake about her mechanics.
---
With that said doesn't spirit make a breathing sound whenever  going out of Haunting? I don't know how it works but certainly gives her a disavantage when she can be heard but she can't hear anyone. 
---
Spirit does have a very strong potential, I am aware, but she also can be fooled very easily, specially since she relies on breath to know where they are. Stridor would have carried, I can see that know, but that doesn't take out the fact that the perk build doesn't help at all with chases, specially whenever used with spirit.
---
I can see why Bloodhound wouldn't have worked so well, but wouldn't it help tracking survivors whenever not Haunting? Same for Predator, yes it is very weak, but wouldn't it help a lot while Haunting since it increases the durability of scratch marks and perfects the path survivors make? He could have a much better understanding of where they've gone to.
---
The perks don't even have to be these two very nooby perks, what about Contagious Fright? Barbecue &amp; Chilly? Bitter Murmur, since he's getting stomped. Nurse's Calling? Even though it wouldn't help while Haunting, it would be nice to know at least where they were healing.
---
There are a variety of other perks that, while they wouldn't do Stridor's wonderful job, they would help at least. Even though he was playing very poorly, if he had a stronger build in the chasing side of things he could've definitely got a different result.
---
Hahahaha! Oh man thats actually pretty funny.
---
I really like Tru3 and sometimes I'm glad these memes don't go too overboard with all the hate.
---
Of course I‚Äôm looking for validation.  That‚Äôs why people post brainstorming ideas.  I‚Äôm fine with people thinking it‚Äôs a garbage idea.  We won‚Äôt ever get out of the current state of decline if we don‚Äôt try and come up with something.
---
I‚Äôve heard it just fine from you.  You‚Äôve said the same thing over and over.  All I was curious about was why go to the trouble in the first place when a downvote says the exact same thing without giving the impression you want to engage.  Clearly the thread didn‚Äôt go anywhere so I‚Äôm going to respond to what little engagement there is.  If it was just to be condescending it seems like a waste of everyone‚Äôs time.
---
Not Asian enough...
---
Just Kidding 10/10!
---
I feel like spirit would slight possibility of letting you go mainly because hse just wants to get revenge on her dad
---
Yes, because killer mains cannot ever possibly be toxic.
---
I'll be honest, I read boop, snoot and hook using the same oo sound from boop....
---
But it singles out survivors instead of including the material in your comment.
---
Up on dpad is point 
---
Down on dpad for come here
---
It is truly a honor to see this for free.
---
I would upvote but 666
---
You didn't know how to do Survivor emotes so I doubt you have the experience to say that lmao
---
this
---
Can't survivors win with out adrenaline and that because if you going to call a Mori op then what about insta heals also other thing like that
---
Nancy‚Äôs groaning made this 10x better
---
Exactly but cool aesthetics
---
Exactly, inner strength is so meta right now it‚Äôs getting HARDER to find totems to cleanse lol
---
Mori isnt unfair, you're just bad.
---
.-. You my friend are delusional. Your opinion? You mean the opinion that "You didn't mention being nice to survivors so this sub is killer sided." 
---
No you see that is what we call instigating, grandstanding for survivor mains, or just flat out attempting to troll. Poorly I might add.  Or the opinion that it's okay to make the argument "Survivors are people too." And then go right into insulting killers. Genius. No really, fucking bravo man. 5000 I.Q. Nice double standard. Your's truly is the most pure way of thinking. I've been doing it all wrong. Man oh man, I thought asking people to treat me a certain way meant I should treat them the way I wanna be treated. Fuck me, how could I be so blind. Of course the answer all along was
---
Complain about how people don't mention being nice to me when they say be nice to other people. 
---
And when they acknowledge me, instead of treating them nicely like I want to. I'll just insult them for bringing up anything I don't like
---
Finally when everyone is mean to me. I'll say I proved my point and act like I won even though all I did was complain, insult, and cry about wait for it....A MEME
---
Help understand what happened, I'm not capable of helping BHVR fix their God forsaken game
---
When your playing with low ranks they will all be there trying to get the save instead of gen rushing one of the most annoying things about rank reset
---
Hey I wouldn‚Äôt complain for that as a cosmetic
---
If you're not going to agree with me don't provide valid criticism and explain to me why you don't agree just downvote.....your mentality if fundamentally flawed on how this whole system is supposed to work.
---
Yeah, honestly I play more killer than survivor but part of that is that survivor is boring.  You don‚Äôt have much to do.  I‚Äôd love some secondary objective to do.
---
He doesnt like doing it either look it up
---
Stop writing novels because I sure as fuck wont read all of that
---
LOOOOOOL

Everyone is saying iron will but tbh another perk that nobody is mentioning is spine chill. If you see it light up for more than a second just hide, works wonders

Oh boy...
---
Tru3 seeing a survivor: is this a streamsniper?
---
Not my fault you're to illiterate to keep up.

---
Real talk though what if shadowborn increased your screens brightness
---
imagine having friends to play with
---
I never asked you to agree with me.  You‚Äôre also clearly comfortable using the downvote button to disagree.  How is the system supposed to work, pray tell?
---
I'm done feeding you man.  You obviously cannot take criticism and came here looking for people to tell you how good your idea is.  Best of luck finding that.
---
Always curious about why Noob3 isn't seen as the toxic piece of shit he is, other toxic players get blasted but not this dude, is it really his ''hi cuties'' persona that keeps him safe from criticism?
---
Prove that your reductionist mindset is stupid? 
---
Chess is just people taking each other‚Äôs pieces until one person has no more. Simple. Finance is just people doing math. Cooking is literally just people heating up and combining ingredients. Racing cars is just people driving fast. Fighting is just people hitting each other until one person gives up. 
---
Do you need me to keep continuing for you to realize how dumb you sound?
---
Yes, this post is just about not being toxic to killers. Idk why the fact is just about killers is harmful to survivors just because they're not included. The fact i'm talking about killer perspective has nothing to do with survivor perspective. People in this sub is so one-sided that sending a good message to one side, automatically means a bad message to the other.
---
Just don't be a dick to anyone in the game.
---
Nice, when and what platform?
---
made with mematic
---
Thats a big oof
---
And? Quit being so sensitive. It's a meme ya big baby.
---
The games he doesn‚Äôt 4K are usually Brutal Killer and a black safety pip though. 
---
The ranking system forces or at least encourages try to 4K when 1 survivor getting hatch or DCing usually means he doesn‚Äôt pip.
---
I'm glad dropping my item and nodding actually works on some killers
---
This way cutie
---
Green would be a poor choice as it's the most "obvious" colour to anyone with regular vision - smack bang in the middle of what we call visible light.
---
The cyan nearest blue could be considered "close enough" to how regular vision percieves red, would probably work fine for prot- and deut- types.
---
As for pink, almost everything is pink for the tritanope. It's either pink, or it's cyan. You'd need to crank saturation and brightness so that a "red" gen doesn't look like a "yellow" gen, doesn't look like a white gen, and doesn't look like the terrain.
---
Again, I really recommmend working with someone to generate stills or footage to better illustrate the problem for people with regular vision.
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW2NVBvI9TA)'s a visual example of the He-Man Vision that tritanopes have to work with.
---
Obviously people think the idea is bad.  That‚Äôs why the thread has no upvotes and essentially no replies beyond your own.  I‚Äôve repeatedly taken your criticism.  I‚Äôve made it pretty clear I understand.  I brought up my counterpoints, but nothing more.  You aren‚Äôt feeding me anything.  I hardly think it‚Äôs a sin to hope for a response beyond one guy telling me it sucks.
---
r/murderbywords
---
Honestly i love the voices the trapper being my fav the attitudes of surv's and the killers makes me lol i get all of the jokes and they just make me feel very happy! not everyone is gonna love it and thats ok!
---
League isn't balanced though lol
---
i personally noticed he calls out baby killers and survivors and doesn‚Äôt enjoy bullying. i dont see him tbag or do other shit like that. i dont see how being good at looping and editing silly ways makes someone toxic. did he used to be toxic or something?
---
this is the daddy meyers we‚Äôve all been waiting for
---
Welcome to dead by daylight. Where the entire playerbase clearly was never hugged as a child.
---
Firstly Perks and items-offerings are different categories you can't compare them. You can win without noed, adrenaline if you play well but that's not the issue rn.  there's no op perk in the game but, im not saying all of them are balanced everyone can use any perk I don't mind. Yes, keys and insta heals are unfair just like mori's
---
Balanced? Yes. Fun to play against, interactive to play against, has any counterplay? Absolutely not.
---
Happy cake day
---
autism speaks
---
Not bad man.  Sounds like pretty sound logic behind the loadout.  I might take it for a spin myself.
---
DCing has been a really big problem lately and it's really tilting me.
---
I still do not understand why they aren't punishing people for DCs. If you DC because of your connect, a 15 minute wait isn't going to kill you, and I'd you're DCinf constantly because if your connection then you don't deserve to ruin the game for other people any more than people DCing in purpose and you need to fix your connection.
---
People DCing on purpose need progressively longer wait times, and potential lengthy bans for doing it often over long periods of time.
---
If someone is going to DC because they can't handle a match, then they NEED TO TAKE A BREAK ANYWAYS and it's so incredibly ridiculous that BVHR isn't doing anything about it.
---
U believe we not get points for DCs? Or is this only after the next patch? Either way it absolutely doesn't make up for the entire lost survivor, the time gained from the killer taking care if that killer patrolling that hook, or the generator and chase time that is lost, and absolutely none of this is made up for after a DC.
---
At the very least, I'd they're not going to punish the survivors, please oh please give some corrections to the game, like finishing a single generator or something like the old DC system uses to do for joining games. At least that is fixed and we no longer have to join into that mess, but it would at least be something.
---
If survivors DCing didn't so heavily favor killers getting pips and wins, this subreddit would have this issue, like many others that are currently really big glaring issues for the survivor side of things, mainstay front page constant topic tier and it would probably get fixed. 
---
It's ruined something like 50% of my games in the past day and it's extremely taxing mentally when you combine it with the other little issues that to unfixed time after time. 
---
I will absolutely never understand not punishing DCing. Even when it was P2P, but now with dedicated, it needs to happen.
---
I‚Äôm referencing tf2. He‚Äôs a boss during Halloween events.
---
Strider makes iron will useless.
---
I‚Äòm a myers main and let the last guy escape about all 3 games once lol
---
For the longest time, Wraith was my nemesis when I was a baby.
---
Probably wasn't the first time either.
---
That is deeply disturbing, well done!
---
Billy is easy mode against bad survivors. But so is Leatherface at that point. Hell, so is Wraith at that point.
---
That's not saying much. Bad survivors are bad survivors. Getting easy downs on them isn't saying much about the killer.
---
Good survivors can loop a mediocre billy fairly easily and avoid his chainsaw consistently by staying in safe areas and not running out in the open for long stretches against him.
---
A GOOD Billy however puts pressure on good survivors and makes them really work to survive against him.
---
And if that billy gets his downs on those survivors, he deserves them because he had to work for them through skill and strategy.
---
the sabo freak :D
---
Michael Myers and Ghostface approves.
---
You are now aware that tru mentions his 7000 hours every 10 mins *snaps*
---
Ya that's true
---
So 99% of the time only one surv will leave if that, doesn't seem that fair...
---
No, it will be a mess, seriously. Identity V has this system, and casual pretty much means you will be camped and nobody saves you
---
Bruhhhhhhhhh
---
What are you correcting, exactly?
---
Could just be a souped up gaming chair lol
---
Soooo plays the game smart, got it.
---
It‚Äôs called teamwork duh
---
Appreciated
---
I doubt Mike Myers would want to kill anyone, guys got an acting career to care about. Micheal Myers on the other hand would not give a shit who you were.
---
Well if they survive for 10 minutes they win.
---
Pretty much yea. Will give free hits when I can also
---
Its not our job to balance in the First place
---
Survivor hitbox is tendered as standing while working on generator. Yeah, definitely not a hitbox issue.
---
Fair enough.  I wish they would do a better job of it though.
---
10 minutes and no objective? You could do that ez pz in a real game where killer has full vision and perks. Would be the easiest thing ever in this mode
---
The killer doesn‚Äôt have full vision. And which side are you saying is easy for?
---
Name of the template?
---
Well, you can kill them...
---
No logic here plz. We have our own way of explaining stuff in his sub.
---
but you are still one of them.
---
I've been asking for a black leather skirt and a top for the Pig but they keep bringing other non desirable outfits for the other ones.
---
*laughs in Dream snares and Borrowed time immunity*
---
I always just assumed its because its 4v1, 16 perks vs 4 but I also got crapped on for explaining why I think the objective of killer is to entertain the entity so  what do I know ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
no. Totems aren't an objectives as long as survivors won't know the killer have noed.
---
It doesn't make sense if you use at least 3 brain cells. If you always consider totems as an objective then there is not point for killers to pick Noed since every totems will be cleansed every games. Which means killers have now 5 perks.
---
killers should have a CHANCE at keeping their addons, maybe not red and purple ones. but at least some of them. am i wrong?
---
Myers looks like Oscar from Shark Tale
---
Your 3rd is debatable post Freddy Buff.  Freddy deserves to be in the conversation of being on even footing with Billy.  He has insane map pressure and unlike Billy you can't take away his power through pallet looping.  His power can actually counter survivors midchase and force hits and immediate pallet tosses at loops.
---
and your point is?
---
Well I kinda meant when some survivors do it in combination with pulling off 360s and in general their goal is to belittle a killer that they have an upper hand against. 
---
No if you‚Äôre just trying to go places backwards, of course that‚Äôs not toxic.
---
And give him a headtaker!
---
Optimal swf groups will find your ruin within few minutes at most. Only on very few maps ruin survive more than 5 minutes. Even if they somehow can't find ruin, optimal swf can just work through it anyway.
---
Nice! That‚Äôs modified from the TOTS 2018 Mask, I‚Äôll assume?
---
I would do that to my mask, but... well, I lack the effort and skill. Yours looks so badass.
---
To do:
---
Steal Dwight's glasses
---
Tunnel the obsession
---
Slow the game down, just a lil bit
---
Butt dance with Nea
---
Eat a pebble
---
Become a cowboy with Jake
---
Hold a bbq party in the basement ( Streamers, cake, Frank's mixtape, red envelope, chili)
---
boob3 is toxic but he doesn‚Äôt enjoy bullying baby killers and survivors.
---
stop my heart hurts
---
Yeah I‚Äôm finding it really hard! It has made me go for killer as the wait times are shorter. I see a lot of people complain about queues for killers but that isn‚Äôt the same for me (though I‚Äôm rank 12 survivor and 15 killer)
---
If you think the main thing about feral frenzy is deep wound then you‚Äôre doing it wrong. Sadly the only good thing about frenzy is that it can locate survivors that DONT have deepwound yet, and also getting the first hit on survivors. His power itself imo needs a buff. However iridescent button is fine. If you‚Äôre trying to knock down survivors with the deep wound then you‚Äôre doing it very very wrong
---
had this last night, i had one hooked and they opened one gate, triggering end game.
---
The game still ended with 3 sacrifices and one injured escape because they thought ganging on a Bubba who¬¥s out of options besides camp is a good idea
---
They sorta do. There's people who purely play both sides to get the "whine pass" (telling you that they play both sides therfore whatever they're complaining about has to be 100% true)
---
Wow, thank you captain obvious! 
---
And survivors can escape via hatch if they sell 1 of their friends and do 4 gens, but there's an easier way everyone refuses to follow
---
Saw
---
Since when were you a comedian?
---
Sorry I value my time?
---
And then they run straight into the killer and go back on the hook and die...
---
Killer is more respectable? How exactly. This game really isn't hard imo, killer or survivor
---
They‚Äôre working on haddonfield right now
---
DC's are shitty and if you do it a lot screw you, but honestly there's not a lot of things to adapt to. Certain killer builds/addons are pretty much uncounterable
---
Real fun mind you. I love leaping into a gen room through a window and shanking wildly... Just a shame their power only stalls the game.
---
Now if they could do what The Plague does and go into a damaging kill mode under certain conditions, they'd be fine.
---
i agree with a lotta this, character wise Wraith would for sure but people that play as him? always end up BM assholes lol
---
.-. Ah yes, your time see. You're illiterate. Any normal person could read what I wrote in about 5 second. You on the other hand have the mental capacity of a goldfish, so I understand you being worried about your time. I would too if I were in your shoes.
---
&gt;  I've actually made it a hobby of collecting "tunnel/camping" comments on my profile, because salty survivors accuse you of that regardless if you did it or not.
---
I actually agree with you on this. I physically make it a point to not tunnel a survivor, but some people seem to think that even looking in their direction is tunneling. With that being said, there is still a Russian stigma. I saw a lot less tunneling/camping when I was on leave in the states.
---
&gt; That's what someone would call selective perception
---
Again, "typical Russian" is a thing for a reason. I don't see "typical Spaniard/Swede/German/British etc etc" on ANYBODy elses profile.
---
&gt; Again trying to paint yourself as the victim
---
It's called sarcasm.
---
&gt; shallow
---
Which makes you one to talk.
---
&gt; I meant "can't deal" as in psychologically
---
Then in that case, you're absolutely correct. A teammate gets downed in 2 seconds, another teammate is gen tapping, and a Spirit immediately returns to hook (or a Nurse that never leaves 2 blink range, which is usually a Russian, sorry again for my racism, but it's a pattern). Absolutely, I can not psychologically accept it. I'm not going to force myself to play against a sadistic soft camping killer that you cannot loop.
---
&gt; BHRV should just enforce harsher punishments for behaviour like that
---
I'll make you a deal. I'll stop DCing. Instead, I'll just struggle phase and give up. I mean.. it's part of the game right? All I did was try to escape the hook! it's part of the game! Just like playing with Prayer Beads, 3 blinks, and Omega blinks is part of the game. Just like soft camping is part of the game.
---
&gt;  Let me take a wild guess aswell, you also DC if someone else DC's right?
---
Not right away. If it's anybody besides Nurse/Spirit/Iri huntress the game is still winnable.
---
out of interest, which killer where you?

Well, it alll started a long time ago in a galaxy far far away....

i can't tell if you guys are trolling or actually serious if the latter then that is a little sad
---
She can still run into your body/see grass moving when you walk. There is no reliant way to countering a good spirit.
---
props for self-improvement, man
---
No he is toxic af I have seen him tbag sometimes but we love him
---
Shit like this is why I don‚Äôt give hatch unless it‚Äôs to baby dweet.
---
Lol ik, I‚Äôm just so tired of being gen rushed in 4 minutes and survivors saying ‚Äúggez‚Äù to probably not be worst killer in the game. And then behavior just sits back and gives not so good reworks to nurse and stuff when they should be focusing on a lot of killers at once rather than one at a time. Small buffs and nerfs can go a long way(like spirit, she needs a few needs and changes to make it more enjoyable for survivors and harder for the spirit to kill the survivors) but instead we get ‚Äúwell now nurse has to wait like a second to blink again!‚Äù Wow, what a change. I‚Äôll be over here losing my entire power for missing a stab, and only going slightly faster with my power and the ability to make ppl hold m1 for 3 seconds!! Yayyyyyy ‡≤†_‡≤†
---
Legion is my favorite killer lore and design wise, and his perks while they‚Äôre shit, given the right buffs I think they‚Äôd be rly enjoyable, his DLC came with Chonky Jesus as well as one of my favorite maps. It‚Äôs just sad he‚Äôs useless and infuriating to play as rather than against :/ more ppl need to show love to legion players for how much they tolerate. Normal killers can understand how bad survivors can be when toxic but as a legion, literally everything is against you and you‚Äôre given a non fatal power that hurts you more than it hurts the survivors
---
That screen is brighter than my future
---
You can fool around on small occasions, no one's gonna judge you for trying to have fun and not taking the game seriously.
---
Everytime i run CI, all 4 survs just go 100% immersion until the 2 minutes is up, and then the game starts.  Might as well have just extended the lloading screen.  I know i could use Whispers, but until level 3 and even then that feels like such a waste of a perk.
---
Legion has a perked designed around not letting people go and they think people who hide in lockers are cowards. I feel like they would be higher up.
---
The funniest thing is when Survivors say I bring DS to punish camping/tunneling killers... That always makes me laugh! The only thing DS does is make sure the next time the killer gets you he knows your completely defenseless, nothing more, especially if your the kind of DS user that uses it on before your 2nd hook!
---
I don‚Äôt try to down people with deep wound. I know that instinct is a really good aspect of ferel. I‚Äôm just saying that if an ultra rare is going to be focused around the killer instinct then up you shouldn‚Äôt need a duration add on and to announce your presence for it.
---
"you can tell this is one of the builds you guys gave me. If this were my build it would be good."
---
It‚Äôs good as it is.  I just think feral frenzy need some chases at base rather than the addons. He‚Äôs dependent on them already. You want to properly chain hits or have a cooldown that doesn‚Äôt last 10 years? Then you have to use rare/very rare add ons. And his fuming mix tape imo needs a rework, because you almost always should know where survivors are when it comes to generators, and you already have a tracking ability in killer instinct. So I feel fuming mix tape should be reworked to be a combination of all the mixtape add ons, kinda liek the Yakuyoke amulet for spirit but slightly better. Also legion needs a buff to his power. Imo he needs more movement speed in frenzy, faste rcault speeds in general, not too fast but just a wee bit. Make it so stabbing and missing just depletes the gauge a wee bit rather than getting rid of all of it. No longer make it so m1 depletes part of the gauge when out of frenzy, increase the duration moderately at base, the recovery rate should be increased as well. I could write an entire patch notes page for legion and how to fix him imo. His power ain‚Äôt lethal but you‚Äôre punished so often. Big sad face :(
---
Because people actually figured out how to play her correctly.
---
Anyone who claims they hate spirit are survivor mains who get molly wopped everytime they come across someone who's decent with her.
---
I like this just so I can finally get Tombstone Myers powered up before endgame
---
Imagine trapper and Hag against a group of survivors. Or maybe ghostface and pig. Those would be cool. Myers and ghostface is just OP
---
I mean that's kind of what combos are for? Combine Self Care with We'll Make It to heal others twice as fast and yourself at normal speed. While running DS you may as well have no perk in the slot.
---
I knowwww, happened to me once, after that I just throw broken keys away
---
My ass you are beating that build at red ranks.  I get what you're trying to do with the whole hey man a builds a build but if you are being honest you know exactly what that build is.  A guaranteed 4K Machine unless you were born without ears, eyes and hands.  Be real man.  That build is pure cancer and you know it.  That's the equivalent of Balanced Landing, insta Heal, 4 man SWF on Haddonfield offering levels of cheese.
---
Suppose that you were sitting down at this table. The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your ‚Äòleft‚Äô? Or the one on your ‚Äòright‚Äô? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute ‚Äòsociety‚Äô with the ‚ÄòUniverse‚Äô. The correct answer is that ‚ÄòIt is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.‚Äô ‚Ä¶Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there‚Äôs no choice but for others to also take the ‚Äòright‚Äô napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is ‚Äòsociety‚Äô‚Ä¶ Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of ‚Äòright or left?‚Äô! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who ‚Äòtakes the napkin first‚Äô must be someone who is respected by all. It‚Äôs not that anyone can fulfill this role‚Ä¶ Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the ‚Äòlosers‚Äô. In the case of this table, the ‚Äòeldest‚Äô or the ‚ÄòMaster of the party‚Äô will take the napkin first‚Ä¶ Because everyone ‚Äòrespects‚Äô those individuals.‚Äù¬†

Writting this on my phone, sorry for the editing or better said lack thereof.

I know it was sarcasm, that's exactly the reason why i said it.
---
Letting yourself die on the first hook right of the bat is still a dick move like pointless facecamping or tunneling, but atleast it has some value for your team, which is time. If you abandon your team and leave them to die you atleast gave them something to work with.
---
As a german (or rather austrian, but people don't care about details) i have to listen to alot of racist bullshit aswell. I speak german? I must be Hitler! I got literally a comment on my profile saying whatever i say is invalid because i am apparently german. And yes, if i make a mistake or a bad call it sometimes happens that it gets blamed on my nationality. 
---
I have seen it happen to germans, russians, turks, to the polish or the british, it doesn't matter. Now i don't say that happens often, but racists and racist stigmas don't care about what race you are. You are different, you are bad. That's it.
---
I think there is a reason why russians get more attention by things like that though. One of them being is that they mostly don't speak english and have a different writing system (cyrillic) so they stay in mind easier.
---
If for example the german kid called xXPussyDestroyerXx is being a toxic little shit you are more likely to remember him by name, than some russian which you can't read the name of.
---
Then it's always immedieatly the nationality, " oh that stupid russian guy"
---
Now i'm NOT accusing you for saying anything like that. That was just my take on how stigmas like that can form and why they are bullshit.
---
Since you like making deals so much how about this: we take our discussion to the PM's or steam because it seems like we are straying a bit off of the topic and i think something else than this comment section would fit this better.
---
Because the best way to play around her is to juke her by cutting back like nurse but you can bump into the bitch so it'll usually get you hit. If you try to make a hard left/right she can usually just find you...also Prayer beads
---
He isn‚Äôt toxic but seems to not play DBD as much and has been sinking into the lower ranks. 
---
It‚Äôs not that he enjoys getting baby killers, but him laughing at the terrible gameplay that ensues.
---
Stout Shako for 2 refined?
---
Bringing 2 healing perks against insta down killers is wasting 2 perk slots. I don't run decisive but it definitely comes in handy against tunneling killers.
---
Just go to the butcher smh
---
You're wasting your time with this dude.  Honestly so was I for replying myself lol.  I remember this one though he's absurdly biased and refuses to admit to anything being remotely unbalanced for killer including this build with Prayer Beads at red ranks.  You will argue for arguing sake with this one.  I recognized his name after posting and instantly regretted it.  I'd advise you to find better uses of your time.  You'll be busy with this one all night.
---
So we talking about a professional stalker here... That's great! I'm one as well.
---
Can you send me a domina pizza if you realy want to pay something ?
---
*stares in happiness*
---
Okay so a couple of things here. To start off with if you chase one guy off the hook all game and still don‚Äôt get that one kill you probably just aren‚Äôt very good  (to be completely honest). 
---
Notice I said I also base my playstyle off of what the survivors are like so yes if the survivors are very coordinated, playing in a different way is near impossible and really give that many shits about winning that day then I‚Äôll do it. However, my personal take on being killer is to just enjoy the game and try and let other people enjoy it too. As such winning is as much of a priority for me as everyone having fun (although I understand why it‚Äôs different for you). Although I am a spirit main so maybe map pressure without tunnelling is a little easier for me rather Th an say somebody who mains wraith (although I‚Äôve seen some good map pressure off of the occasional god wraith ahaha good on them) 
---
Yes of course being chased is a part of the game, never said that it was. In the same sense that eggs are a part of a cake but I still wouldn‚Äôt take a nice bite out of an egg and say it was a good cake. When I do play survivor I tend to enjoy doing a bit of everything, getting chased, doing gens, going for the save, etc so I try and let that happen for the survs when I play killer. An hey! Everyone is different so maybe not everybody cares about that but I personally prefer to.
---
No you‚Äôre not obligated to do anything as I‚Äôve stated numerous times, I‚Äôm simply answering the question as to why people complain about it. Which is that the game can feel unfair and like you‚Äôre being booted out when it happens. While nobody has to avoid doing it I‚Äôm just putting it out there that myself and many other killers do avoid it for that reason (aside from you toxic teabaggy douches you bet your ass you‚Äôre getting tunnelled off the hook if I‚Äôm close enough at the time smh).
---
Strong killer, therefore its a broken overpowered unfair mess of design
---
My rule for that and dc's is to let that survivor live and farm with them, might displease the entity, but I get my bps anyways and that person doesn't get a pointless and boring game
---
You can just screenshot a BDSM gay porn video for the doctor. They usually use that thing that let your mouth open.
---
That's not true. It's not like you are still having a challenge playing against them when they are bringing you to your last hook, I'll keep dcing lol idc
---
360 are not toxic either tho, it's just a last-resort trick to try and avoid a hit. Doing a complex moonwalk + 360 combo can sometimes be useful to confuse the killer and make him miss also.
---
Tomorrow then.
---
Damn thats nice.
---
Sometimes you'll even get downvoted with no replies for stating a fact that they dont want to accept
---
I do. :)
---
Also just because something is "op" it doesn't mean i can't have fun playing against something challenging.
---
But maybe it's just because im a very competitive person and playing against things people call broken or op and crushing said things makes it all the better for me.
---
I think spirit is perfectly fine if you take off her BiS add-ons.
---
Ever tried playing add-on less spirit? Suddenly she drops from S to B/ low A tier.
---
It would be a slaughter
---
I had something similar happen once with Trapper, I grabbed a survivor off a totem and she got stuck on my shoulder. Almost downed the whole team but one got away and picked everyone else up.
---
You haven't seen a pc nurse compared to a console one have you

We'll make it is a good perk. That's the only healing you need.
---
That's extremely situational, and she doesn't teleport. Much like the second(?) Movie with the house, there's trap doors that she uses to get around.
---
50+ games if ur bad lol
---
I legitimately don't understand why this subreddit constantly wants killers nerfed. The nurse is already the least fun to play killer, now this massive nerf is going to make her borderline unplayable. 
---
  
---
Fuck survivor mains.
---
You're oozing entitlement out of every pore.  They're just cosmetics my dude.  We aren't entitled to free cosmetics.  They're optional with zero impact on the game.  That's all this battle pass is.  Who cares?  If you're getting this bent out of shape over this I shudder to think what being in game in your lobby is like.

Untitled camper game
---
Billies always give me hatch
---
Yep i can understand especially beads spirit, however as a killer main when i play survivor im a spirit magnet so i learned how to juke/counter her mott.
---
1 murky is the max fog you can get,anything more is a waste
---
It's not a matter of it being too hard to play vs or something, it's just no fun at all to go against some things.
---
Can I win a match vs purple add ons spirit, instasaw billy with bamboozle, 3 blinks nurse, haddonfield with balanced landing, etc? Yeah, it's possible.
---
Will I have any ounce of fun during that game? Will I still want to play some matches after that one is over? Probably not.
---
damn nice job. I still have 36 to go... yet I have more hours in the game than you do XD
---
Hell yeah I'd Frick a
---
Wanted to pop back in and say that I had so much fun playing for the first time yesterday. I accidentally popped some gennies and none of my teammates hated me. I did have one instance of playing in a lobby with a lot of higher ranked people and the killer hunted me down and camped me on the hook which was a bummer, but also had a few escapes! I‚Äôve started as Meg because at my noobness her adrenaline perk is a+. Anyway! Excited to keep playing! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
My go-to for SWFs is Ghostface (hence the user flair). There‚Äôs something so fun about catching an entire group off-guard and slowly picking them out one by one.
---
Lol üòÇ ok
---
Alright you‚Äôve run out of meager counterpoints. Come back when you learn the difference between toxicity and playing optimally and/or meta
---
As long as it‚Äôs opt in, I don‚Äôt care.  I‚Äôd be okay with Xbox/PS/Switch crossplay if it helped wait times.
---
Get it girl!
---
So what the fuck are you on about then? Quit being a fucking victim because you don‚Äôt like what someone else posted.
---
üëå Dude
---
Well I'm not saying not to hope lol, I'm just saying that they're most likely not going to use this one, and if they ever do make her a custom chase it's going to he wayyyy down the line, like after this whole archives project gets settled in and maybe even in the next couple chapters more new killers are prolly gonna get custom chase music, also dont forget this is still just fan content, its the same thing as someone who's insanely good at sculpting and painting 3d models who makes a custom skin for a killer, like it's a far out there concept of fan creation that's gonna capture attention because it's never been done before, AND it's really good, ya dig?
---
Well it is obvious he doesn't understand how the pipping system works, considering he thinks there's a correlation between how many bloodpoints you get and how many emblem points you get.
---
With how often he proxy camps (I'm not arguing whether he should or shouldn't but it does directly harm your emblems) and how little gen pressure he keeps up a lot of the time, it's not surprising a lot of his games are safety pips.
---
It has some of the safest pallets, ideal for balanced landing and a pretty easy gen rush, from a survivor pov. From a killer pov, it‚Äôs the smallest map so less distance to apply pressure and survivors get confused a lot on this map. It‚Äôs a fun map Imo
---
&gt;  I speak german? I must be Hitler
---
Jo, ich lebe in Deutschland und verstehe.. aber das ist ein unterscheid (ich verstehe die erkl√§rung). Das ist extrem und nicht mein einstellung
---
I don't really think its a Cyrillic issue, I guess it could be, but I'm being dead serious when there is a pattern. This isn't a form of selective racism or immediately stereotyping killers under a nationality. Usually whenever I get tunneled/camped I like to read the profile comments, just to see what other people say (for fun and curiosity). Nearly every single time it's a Russian. I don't click their profile saying "omg I got face camped this HAS to be a Russian!". Nearly every single time they have loads of comments saying -Rep camp harder, -Rep typical Russian, -Rep camping Spirit, etc etc. I'm 110% not racist. I don't think Russians are bad people, or less superior in any way. I'm actually super fascinated with the country/culture, tried to learn the language (and failed miserably), but I am not a fan of them in DbD. It's a pattern that developed into a stereotype.
---
I think there's the conflict of what level of balance people want. Should killers 4k more often than not? If that is the balance people want, than there are a variety of underpowered killers. Is 2k the baseline for balance, as in, when equal skilled survivors are up against an equal skilled killer than on average 2 survivors should die?
---
Than I'd argue many killers are balanced, but then Myers, Spirit, Nurse, they're "OP". I'm on the latter end. If you build a game where a majority of your audience is "losing", you're not going to have a very successful game. I think many killers are in a good state right now, but there are some that are just very effective with the right combinations of perks.
---
On top of this, some are just unfun. I wonder what is the process of designing new killers. Is it simple, "oh this seems like an interesting ability", without thinking of how it plays again? That's how it feels like for nurse. The ability to teleport breaks every option the survivor has to fight back against the killer.
---
"now this massive nerf is going to make her borderline unplayable." That's not true, Nurse is still the second best killer probably. Also, I think you finding her unfun is more of an opinion, not something that's an accepted fact everywhere
---
that's incredible!!
---
We really do. It would make them fun to play.
---
*Heavy breathing*
---
Oh thank you!
---
Play as an online undetectable killer I guess.  The new update will add more of them.  Then OoO will give you an advantage and put the player(s) at a disadvantage.

You understand that people will just afk/suicide? It will only take a couple of seconds more.
---
Instead of punishing people for not wanting to play against certain things, maybe try to look into the main reasons why people disconnect?
---
Haddonfield is the most common reason for DCs for killers, maybe they should've had prioritised haddonfield over badham in their map updates? They are fixing instaheals, which are also a very common reason for killer disconnects.
---
Iri head, Spirit, instasaw, hostage doc and moris are the most common reasons for survivor disconnects, maybe they should be looking to fix those as top priority?
---
They are making a step in the right direction with nurse, who's one of the most common reasons for disconnects.
---
I 100% guarantee you that disconnects as a whole would be drastically lowered.
---
[This video](https://youtu.be/ywdsHP4tKdg) explains this topic way better than I can, I recommend you give it a look.
---
Optimal SWF usually know the spawn points for totems well and at worst they'll bring a map and mark it down for everyone.
---
Occupying 1 survivors time on an optimal swf group for at most a minute is waste of a perk slot. Even corrupt intervention lasts 2 minutes on multiple gens and allows you to get really early pressure.
---
On a normal swf team ruin might be worth it, but not on an optimal team.
---
9\10 replace the ace with a Claudette and it will be 10\10
---
I had something similar as killer. I followed a Meg through a window while she was crouching behind it, she then immediately vaulted to the other side while i pressed m1 as soon as i finished the vault while turning and for some reason my animation went from attacking to grabbing. This somehow completely bugged out the grab animation and Meg was considered to be on my shoulder, but not dying. I had the hooks lighting up but when i tried to hook her the animation would freeze.
---
Have barely ever watched Monto, what makes him toxic?
---
Sure thing, you have a good day aswell
---
If survivors aren't just standing still waiting to get hooked its toxic. Come on didnt you get the memo?
---
Killer gameplay is obviously based around getting 4ks. You effectively get punished if you get less than a certain amount of hooks.
---
The game is unbalanced on purpose. One side dramatically loses, the other has a tremendous victory. There is no halfway measures, trying balance it like that leads to boring garbage gameplay.
---
He has a cosmetic? What? Lol
---
Over under on amount of traps you had at that basement with that build plus NOED.  I'm gonna say 5
---
The fact that you would suggest a gun in this game and it would stun the killer for 15 seconds isn't the best suggestion. Imagine the massive stun with DS, Head on, then a gun in the back. You'd lose a gen or 2 if it's a swf.

NEW ITEM:
---
Hallowed Blight Memento Mori
---
Ultra Rare quality
---
a pumpkin shaped charm that allows a killer to kill survivors with their hand after one hook. Gain +100% bloodpoints for this trial
---
Because she is so common at High ranks you see her bascially every second game and she is hard to counter
---
Team Billy's blasting off again!
---
It's a common glitch with the trapper if you play using a "grab em, stack em, hang em" motto. Happens every 6-10 matches, have reported multiple times to no avail.
---
You don't remember how awfully boring release freddy was to play vs.
---
You'd get slugged all game with him hanging around the slugs and you couldn't really pick anyone up so they often just bled out.
---
Much like Legion, he didn't get changed because he was super hard to win against, his gameplay patterns were incredibly boring and non-interactive.
---
Survivors: Must be safe to go down into the basement because Leatherface isn't a stealth killer and theres no heartbeat!
---
*Me sitting in the basement with insidous:*

&gt;Me, with ~~20~~ 150 hours ingame
---
The Doctor doesn‚Äôt have great table manners? The person with one of the highest educations in the game doesn‚Äôt know how to behave while eating? You need to rethink that thought, buddy
---
People didn't realize how insane she was at first. No one knew the best builds, and big streamers + hive mind audiences tends to equal one opinion (in this case Spirit being bad) throughout most of the community. She also wasn't 60% of the killers you see past rank 10. People hate her now because you see her so much, prayer beads, and have you ever played against a Spirit? It's the most unfun, least balanced feeling experience in the game. I'd take omegablink god Nurse over Spirit because atleast the game's usually over fast. Also, atleast Nurse required a lot of skill. With Spirit you basically just need a good headset.
---
You've clearly never played her.
---
Also, she is far from being the "best" killer. 
---
Also, balancing the game based on what some YouTubers say is stupid. They only represent the smallest part of the smallest part of the player base. Now console is going to greatly suffer because nobody gives a shit about console.
---
I mean if they want to reduce killer queue times increasing no for survivors is one way to do it
---
Yeah there custom icons, just gotta search for the packs on the searchbar. It isn't a bannable thing but if for some reason you are unlucky enough to get banned, then bhvr won't unban you. 
---
As for the second question, you should set your graphics to the lowest possible option even if you can run on high without problems. 
---
It is literally a night and day difference, on high everything is really dark and can fuck you up as killer while looking for sneaky survivors. While on low everything is so bright that you should have no problems. The hair for survivors look like shit on low though, if you don't mind that, go for it.
---
Uhh gen rush is a thing and it happens when you don‚Äôt apply pressure.. you literally explained how it happens lol
---
I don't know why this comment is being downvoted.  Considering borrowed time only works in the killer's terror radius, it's true.
---
Hahahah what about you being my fucking therapist. You guys really got mad for real but i don't know why we are just arguing but you always trying to be salty go head my fucking dumb ass son
---
Something like this has happened to me before. But i was playing Leatherface and sitting in the basement. I was on the phone at that point. But all three survivors came down and started tbagging me and unhooked the survivor i had hooked. Guess who got the 4k.
---
Ah yes jake is cleansing rui-
---
\*exposed\*
---
ps4?
---
Yeah I'll leave that one for you to look for I reckon
---
Quite a lot of people, lol. Not everyone has a lot of money to spare on their hobbies.
---
&gt; It does effect people because I‚Äôm tired of being objectified everyday by men
---
So you blame other women for that? Not the people who are objectifying you?
---
This is bullshit anyway, If a guy cosplays with abs on show nobody bats an eyelid but if a women does it they are contributing to the entire gender being objectified?
---
Not everyone is a nun - Stop making people feel bad for showing a tiny bit of flesh, that is in no way sexual... It's her stomach..
---
Insecurity and toxicity are 2 separate things. Killers who frequently camp are either
---
A.New to the game and don't know what the fuck they're doing (Not toxic)
---
B. Facing a lot of altruistic players recently and taking extra precaution (Slightly toxic)
---
C. Facing a killsquad** SWF group (SWF brought it on themselves)
---
D.Unsure of their ability and therefore take any scrap they can (Toxic)
---
E. Going out of their way to harass and bully survivors (Highly Toxic)
---
** A killsquad is a full 4 man SWF where 3 people bring in a gen perk, ds, BT, and SB while the 4th usually best runner brings in OoO and feeds their team every move the killer makes or attempts to take up all their time
---
--------
---
Survivors who Tbag a lot are either.
---
A. Saying hello (Not toxic)
---
B. Attempting to get or maintain a killers attention (Slightly toxic if the killer ignores and you continue)
---
C.(This is from personal experience) Listening to music and dancing by tbagging when the killer finds them (Not toxic)
---
D. Just tbagging the killer to tbag the killer (Toxic)
---
E. Have become acutely aware that the killer is not having a good time, going out of their way to actively torment and mock the player. (Highly toxic) 
---
Not everything is so black and white. Intentions are what create toxicity not neccesarily the actions alone. Treating one like it's more severe just because someone gets removed from the game is again misguided. Sure it ruins the game for that person. But having even just one skilled yet toxic survivor can just as easily ruin the killers game. Both of these types of play can have severe mental tolls on either side. And just because one doesn't make you "lose the game." Doesn't make it any less mentally or emotionally damaging when you're consistantly on the ass end of it. 
---
Bottom line is: If your intentions are to make the game less fun for the other side for whatever reason. You're a cunt.
---
‚Äúsub-reddit‚Äù almost sounds like an insult seeing it hyphenated lmfao
---
Check flair
---
People not realising that The Game is heavily in favour of killers because of short sightlines, small travel time between gens and you can just let all the upstairs gens get done an really punish survivors trying to finish the downstairs ones, even with balanced landing this map is no Haddonfield.
---
Yeah that makes sense. I just started playing the game a little over a month ago so don't have a ton of perks unlocked yet.
---
Basically, to sum it up, it isnt that spirit isnt to powerful, it is that she is easy to pick up.
---
I have seen quite a few videos on how people wanna fix her. Frankly, I can agree on most, if not, all points made on people's personal fixes. My favorite list is:
---
1. Change prayer beads and the mother-daughter ring's rarity switch
---
2. Make survivors pains omnidirectional 
---
3. Make it to where you can't bump into a survivor while phase-walking
---
4. Have her ability have a 1-2 second cooldown before charging
---
This preserves her kill potential and map pressure, but makes it harder to play her.
---
Nice dude.
---
Got it, thanks. I just started playing recently so don't have a ton of perks unlocked for him and still trying to figure out what works good.
---
Where are babies grown?  
---
Where do you think sexuality comes from?
---
mo exceptions
---
Because with the right addons she has no counterplay
---
downvote cuz you didnt make the price 42069

It‚Äôs just a little fun/banter yet people get real sensitive over it

I have a similiar experience. I was stressed out a few years back because I over-performed in every sector of my life. Tried to get full scores on tests in school while working 25h a week on a job I tried to get a promotion (I did get it btw:D) while maintaining my relationships with gf. I played CSGO and tried to break it to semi-professional scene with few of my mates. All the stress went to the point that I slammed my desk on a daily basis, broke a mouse and I was toxic AF to random teammates and enemies, because it felt good to release the anger and it felt extra godo if I got someone else to rage because of me. I realized it was not healthy and I quit CSGO and went back to Muay Thai and gym lifting. Best decision of my life. I can say that at least I did not feel good about myself or my life at that point and I suppose that would apply to almost all of people who are toxic for no reason.
---
Did anybody say otherwise
---
Says the guy who doesn't use periods.
---
Tried scrolling past. It didn't work
---
I'm sure that could be said with any killer.
---
Well a lot of the time, it IS dead hard. He's still a nice ass killer tho.
---
This tier list is completely true, I play Legion and if someone REALLY wants to live, I will let them.
---
I had a really good game with my friend this weekend. We teamed up and got matched against the coolest Pig. Played boop the snoot and made friends. Offered my toolbox and at the end we let the collapse take us.
---
prove thyself doesn't save you that much time though. On a 2man gen you will go from 44 to 40s, and it requires you to multiman the gens instead of applying pressure on multiple gens.
---
Botany knowledge will also save you 4s, but per heal instead of per gen. Healing someone will reduce pressure, and probably gain you a lot more than 4s.
---

For a split second, I was wondering what would need meg's ponytail physics for here.

hours still matter like i said.you aren't gonna see a new person mind game and 360 a rank 1 killer.i never said it means skill but there is some skill implemented.i never said that a person with 200 hours can't get to rank 1

 Bro ... I was so excited, thinking this was for real!? üòÄü§®üò´
---
Take off huntress lullaby and put on Thrill of the hunt
---
Yes and that has happened.  I'm aware that it's heavily map dependant, but at least 70% of the time it works heavily in my favor and at least 40% of the time I get 4k.
---
Unfortunately I don't have it as her.
---
I know you're keeping the killer from the gens as I do it myself still toxic hi BTW two accounts lul

What

Going full Hex is a risk. I would recommend Ruin, Haunted Ground, Pop goes the Weasel, BBQ and Chili.

Two accounts? You dumb? Its not fucking toxic you spastic monkey. You dont know what is and isnt so stop saying shit that isnt true

Because.It's.A.Meme. Take your fine tooth comb and go read too deeply somewhere else or something Mr. Way too literal. "I am offended that you didn't specify, nyahhh." Like jfc it's a joke y'know heehee haha. Goddamn you fuckers are exhausting with how much offense you take to EVERYTHING "That meme didn't specify it wasn't about me. Therefore it must be about me." Go find a sense of self security for real. And next time you feel the guttural response to react to something like this. All you have to do is think "Well I don't do that, so it isn't about me." And boom you can enjoy jokes that don't specify they aren't at your expense because you will be secure enough to know they aren't. And you won't waste people's time looking like a fool.
---
*cough* the tiiiiiiiippppp!
---
This game also doesn‚Äôt play like a horror game at all. Even then, Ghostface, scratched mirror Myers, wraith, pig, are all more fun to play against. And while a single survivor shouldn‚Äôt be straight up stronger then a killler, they should be able to outplay them, otherwise you‚Äôre just telling solo survivors to get fucked.
---
As a console player myself, PC Nurses would destroy Console players. It makes more sense to do cross-console play but not include PC in cross play.
---
We actually need console crossplay. PC would be unfair I think
---
That‚Äôs kinda wrong because she did start out pretty bad. Her sounds were not omnidirectional so you would pretty much always know where she was her buff helped her a lot
---
The way I see it, if you're streaming then you're showing the whole world what you're doing in game. You don't get to be mad if the killer decides to tune in. It's like leaving cookies on a counter only 2 feet high, with a sign that says "Free Cookies!" And getting mad your dog ate one.
---
Then don't cleanse
---
I've never bought cosmetics before, but this I would have to buy.
---
Lord forgive me for what I‚Äôm about to do
---
.-. Okay and? I just hear complaining. The game is marketed as a horror game and yeah it doesn't play like a horror game. THATS WHY I LIKE THE ADD-ONS THAT DO. A survivor doesn't out and out DESERVE counter play. I don't think you realize who the entity is supposed to favor but it's not that baby Dwight. The killer is supposed to be intimidating, overwhelming, and ferocious. A survivor is supposed to be a bag of hope that the entity feeds on. Using the killer to build and extract it. So again. I see nothing wrong with putting that hope in Jeopardy. Say you escaped 3 times, you get confident. You think yeah I got this. And you go in full of hope and confidence, then the prayer beads show up and you get grabbed immediately, that's the entity cashing in on all that hope and making a 3 course meal out of your 3 course escape.So yeah, I am telling solo survivors to get fucked. Self included. You don't deserve anything against a brutal killer controlled by a fucking godlike being who's trying to consume your hope. Same that the killer doesn't just deserve to kill you, they have to earn it. That being said. You are 4 and they are one. The entity wants you dead and the killer every now and again does deserve to simply thrash survivors around like a wet paper towel.

This is pretty creative! Some little changes would probably need to be made, but I like it! :)

Jake is exposed.

The one with the clown is awesome and to bad it didn‚Äôt look like that in game, I might actually be scared a little bit, till then it‚Äôs bhvrs clown boy who doesn‚Äôt impress...
---
Tom Hanniger from My Bloody Valentine as a killer. Although Trapper does have an outfit based on him...
---
I don't get it..
---
Oh fuck I went against one of those when I was learning to play
---
Console, that makes sense thanks
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
You're bad, and everyone else on this thread is too, unless you're facing the 1% population of actually good survivors you can get 4ks all the time,  people just try to play him like other killers and when they fail they either blame the killer or gen speed, it makes me lmao
---
Dude there is a Blendette at 2 inches from your chainsaw at 0:15 and you just ignore her
---
Hmm I didn't start grinding the game until recently but I've had it for awhile so that makes sense, thanks
---
*freddy's eyes start melting*
---
So The killer is bad because you face bad players?
---
It‚Äôs a meme bro... everybody knows both sides can be toxic. Didn‚Äôt know we needed to spell this out for you
---
I'd like to watch that in r1 action. You know any killer main who streams and play Wraith with this build?
---
No refunds
---
Alright thanks mate. Also great costume.
---
/Franklin's
---
Ppl have been complaining about the prayer beads add on for a long time.
---
Wow, can you please calm down? They‚Äôre bringing up a question and asking to address a point and you‚Äôre going off on them. Seems like you‚Äôre the one taking offense here. Chill.
---
I'll make you happy any time of the night
---
This aint nothing special, just a mori...NOW clipping through walls or mori on the air now thats some high level shit
---
Again, I understand that it's hard for you to process that given your illiteracy, but I need you to understand not everyone is as developmentally stunted as you are. Some of us actually finished grade school and understand the sounds that letters make and can put them together without having to think about it. One day though. You'll get there. I believe in you
---
Whenever i bring We'll make it
---
Honestly I think the people who do sweat like crazy on both sides, killer and survivor, are making the rest of us look bad, sometimes there‚Äôs killers who just don‚Äôt care, and run hella crutch perks and offerings, and sometimes there are survivors who teabag and flashlight click for no good reason, it‚Äôs kinda embarrassing as someone who plays both sides somewhat evenly. But that‚Äôs just my 2 cents, and everyone has an opinion.
---
he's not wrong
---
advantage or disadvantage, i am playing around them. Not the game i initially planned. Deadhard, BT, DS, etc... you continue your game with some obstacles. OoO? nope this game is about me now homie
---
Wow you ran a loop and baited attacks.
---
you literally just made my point for me. this is great. i actually love you
---
A big problem was her MAPS.
---
They are TORTUROUS to play as a killer, because every1, and I mean EVERY1, immerses on those maps.
---
Also, way back when killers had a much less RNG in maps, so playing spirit meant you were most certainly going to get Nea'd or Blendetted all game long.
---
Learning huntress?
---
Lore&lt;balancing. I don‚Äôt care about the ‚Äúentity wanting hope‚Äù or whatever, I want a fair game for both sides. You can play however you want but I disagree with it.
---
Why distressing? I actually find it good in a lot of builds and killers
---
...It's true. Do you think it's impossible for something to happen to the hosts connection that causes a desync? That deserves a "bruh" if anything
---
You are wrong because this game is not of a genre that need balance, in the terror games the villains have the power not the victims
---
if everyone is telling you you're wrong, you're probably wrong
---
anyway, i am not surprised at all that you didn't have a real response because the truth was never a concern of yours.
---
Thanks, but I‚Äôm just kinda proud of it
---
Survivors still haven‚Äôt gotten their goal when NOED activates. They still have to escape. Idk how you don‚Äôt know about that
---
Wholesome.
---
you're the first person to call it out, good on you lad. this shit is insane, if u don't like the man or his content don't watch it. no need to come after him. if anyone did it to popular streamers like noob or jen they'd get clapped for being toxic, so why is tru3 the exception? he's a good person, he's fun and sure he has his downs but we all do. mans is better than half the players on this post for sure, and he deserves better than this.w
---
.-. Dawg what? All he's doing is complaining about the OP not being pin point specific. Lel. Also I have no chill I have too much ADHD for that noise, but nice white knighting
---
I know her buff helped her, what are you implying? I'll name drop both of the names, Ardetha and TydeTyme both thought she was shit even after her buff and spread said assumption across their audiences.
---
She wasn't really bad when she came out either, probably not top tier where she is now, but not awful like people claimed she were.
---
Or to have fun. Idk who's bragging though.
---
So much truth here
---
Doesn't help that BHVR breaks sound every six months making her much harder to play.
---
It doesn't fit as well as left behind, as left behind implies you are the last person
---
not the win or lose screen. Its the time spent. Playing that round even if I 4k or not, i still lose my time since i wont be able to have fun not being able to execute my plan. and being forced to play around the OoO .
---
That‚Äôs his old outfit. Super cool art though - the outfit banners always are
---
WGLF? Its ur bloodpoint perk its fine 
---
No Mither is made by the devs specifically to make the game in hard mode
---
Well, I was also agreeing with some of your other comments regarding toxicity being based on intent and rife on both sides, but sure. Boil me down to a white knight. Sounds great.
---
Myers
---
As the killer you are supposed to kill them, as the survivor you are supposed to escape. They were just salty. NTA
---
Fun what is this word you speak of some sorcery?
---
I only dislike against her since Iron Will and We‚Äôll Make It are useless and always some of my favorite perks.
---
And thats what i said to him. "Just playing the game"
---
Back when killers could lag switch still ahahaha
---
PLEASE bring crossplay
---
PC included
---
Fuck the whiners ohh nurse
---
Then go play a different game. Nuff said. This is dead by daylight. Dying isn't losing. And if you can't accept some things are gonna make you die fast. Tough shit
---
I main surv but when I have good humor to play killer the only killer I pick its nurse am I some sort of abomination?
---
That happened to me once. He had both add ons that let him have tier 3 infinitely, as well as the instant mori. Me and my 2 friends were on last gen then saw the 4th insta die. Thats when Myers showed up and chased all down and killed us.
---
Plus it's a group setting. Its like high school where that one kid was cool but when he got into a group of friends he'd be a dick to people
---
??? Maybe read and try to understand the comment first before you reply for the sake of saying something.
---
Eh, it‚Äôs just that a lot of survivor mains don‚Äôt like that the killer is supposed to be more powerful then them, and insist that we should play on fair ground.  Now, if there were 2 or more dcs, or if you wrecked them, you I should give the hatch.  But other that than you‚Äôre not an asshole, you‚Äôre good.
---
Rank reset at its finest, with new players meeting with salty long time players lol
---
Literally every time I get a survivor daily it just decides to switch to a Doctor/Huntress/Nurse etc. daily. I literally only have 3 killers leveled up because they're the only ones I'm interested in playing.
---
and I oop.
---
Now that they have the servers up are they going to start giving out harsher (or any) punishment to those who DC like this on a normal basis? I understand DCing once or twice could be a connection thing but people like this...
---
Oh nvm I did the same thing with nea and came up against someone called learning huntress
---
Considering I enjoy this game and put a lot of time into it, I‚Äôm not going to do that. Thanks for the suggestion though!
---
I love playing against SWF, because they tend to be dangerously altruistic. All the free points for me lol
---
okay.
---
This game have the double of survivor side maps and you dont see the killers bitching for that
---
True but 4 survivors who switch to toolboxes at the last second is gonna be fucking annoying either way
---
I agree but it won't stop me
---
Only way it should be reportable is if they admit it in in game chat, which some people are dumb enough to do
---
Reminder that PC should be included in crossplay, controllers should be given the option to only match with other controllers though.
---
people post this exact same thing every day but i have never seen anyone say otherwise
---
Clearly you've never played against a 3 blink/omega blink PC nurse before
---
*rake in the lake*
---
I mean borrowed time isn‚Äôt broken and I‚Äôm a killer main. It just punishes killers who try to tunnel or face camp, otherwise it‚Äôs useless.
---
Mories are for dailies and fun.  I find mories to be enjoyable.  I‚Äôm glad to pay the price of admission on either side.
---
Well I mean you jumped in like I'm going off and I'm really, really not. He's just harassing the op for not being specific enough and it's both funny and annoying. Like dude, who cares about the specifics on the wording of a meme? That seems like some base level pettiness
---
Bubba also kills to protect the basement.
---
The point of the meme is that both sides are toxic to each other.
---
So whats the difference between the tombstone piece (purple addon) and the whole tombstone (red addon)?
---
You gotta drop your item then not wiggle on their shoulders, that increases chances across all killers. :)
---
Why would you ever let them have the hatch -_-
---
Sorry, perhaps I was misled by the sheer amount of cursing you threw at them, but I could be wrong. This could just be how you speak to people who bring up points counter to what you want to address. I don‚Äôt know!
---
Yeah I know it does that's why I only said cross play and didn't specify.. In all fairness people say "unfair advantage" but you can use keyboard and mouse on xb1 (not sure about ps4)
---
The mentality behind "You don't like it? Go play something else." is selfish as fuck. You're allowed to enjoy the game, but speak out against balance issues. Yes. I said balance issues. Prayer beads is unfair, and let's be honest. Rarity isn't a counter balance to how annoying/imbalanced something is. It's the priority reason as to why Nurse is getting reworked/nerfed. You can disagree that you like how things are, but the community CLEARLY doesn't agree with you.
---
üôÑüôÑüôÑ you just said you face players that make those mistakes, also imagine thinking a killer with an instant down is worse than legion and doctor lmao
---
Play killer and get gen rushed
---
Play surv and get tunneled or have no one do gens
---
Must be the worst luck always getting sweatlords
---
you're really going to town making posts about things no one says today my man
---
(also, there are posts here where people literally ask for advice on how to genrush lul)
---
As long as you believe kill rushing isn‚Äôt real, I‚Äôm fine with that opinion.  (Slugging, tunneling, camping, ect)
---
As a hag main I can attest that I do show some sympathy, unless someone breaks my devour hope. I do let one person escape per people who DC though, only seems fair.
---
What do you mean?! They are both perfect, now excuse me while I go coughing in the corner
---
It's kind of a cute Family Guy style animation. I think there's so few things like it that we just appreciate someone making in-jokes. Though I agree some of the jokes are a miss for me
---
Stalking is really not his key ability and it's only useful when the survivors truly have no idea where you are.  His true strength is starting the game with no Terror or red strain and the ability to drop it again mid chase.
---
Marcus is that you?
---
Is Ghostface worth playing? I've heard he's a lot of fun but the difficulty for him keeps turning me away
---
&gt; Is this game new-player friendly?
---
not even a little bit

Have you not seen the live action cat in the hat? The man knows no such thing as ‚Äúmercy‚Äù.

Bootleg Cannibal
---
Being constantly chased by the killer and dying as Dwight
---
I fail to see how this destroys her. It would just make her more about reads rather than tracking, which is what she was meant to be.
---
Keep it between consoles then sure
---
&gt;I would say not Vigo but the person from last year's hollow blight. The guy who made the putride syrum.
---
But... The blight event featured Vigo as the man in the cloak that began experimenting with the Putrid Serum. He didn't make the serum; he extracted it from the plants during the blight. Dwight's event cosmetic is called "Vigo's Apprentice". 
---
I'm not saying Vigo will be in the Archives, I'm only clarifying that Vigo is indeed the man from the Hallowed Blight event
---
Kinda weird how triggered y'all are over a silly meme but ok
---
Must be a afk killer with no perks
---
I mean, I doubt the guy wanted to be on the receiving end of that either, considering he was on the windshield and struggling to hang on as is, a crash caused by the steering wheel veering off and the car slamming into a wall would've definitely killed him, even without the rebar spike head impale.
---
What if they have we'll make it?
---
Idk, I think I have a pretty good Surveillance Wraith build. 
---
Cannibal however....
---
Because people can't adapt even if she hasn't changed for over a year, ONLY recently people get pissed about her. because is too easy to rank up and find decent nurses, spirit and billy
---
We'll Make It hasn't applied it's healing buff to self-healing, either with a medkit or self-care, since 1.0.2. Just bring botany and a medkit, or inner strength, both save more time and are safer because of the speed.
---
They should get rid of both.
---
r/perksbydaylight
---
The biggest scare I've ever had in the game was patrolling a 2nd floor house in Haddonfield. I had absolutely no idea anyone was there, the gen was untouched, I was just dicking around. I move to walk past a pallet and a fucking survivor I did not see drops it on my face. It was so LOUD and I jumped like a foot and just stood there baffled as he ran away.
---
lmao I can say the same thing about survs loosing under a minute
---
I agree with most of what you say, but I disagree with some of your assessments. Intentions to be or not to be toxic matters, but doing things intentionally that can appear as toxic also matters. For example - You may think that your tea bagging to music isn't toxic because you don't mean it to be. But the killer doesn't know that you're doing. To them, it's just tea bagging and triggers the same emotional response.  
---
You may not intend to be toxic, but to the killer, you are. This is like your Killer's D example. The killer isn't trying to be toxic by camping, they are just insecure about their abilities to do well if they leave the hook. In effect, the camped survivor isn't really able to play and will consider it to be toxic. 
---
I also don't think that your Killer's B is toxic at all. In your B, the killer expects hyper altruistic players, this usually translates to 2-3 survivors hovering the hook. You can't expect the killer to charge across the map just because, especially if their BBQ didn't show anyone at all.
---
Yeah, exactly
---
You can let them die but it‚Äôs mostly boring for the both of them since it takes about 3 minutes or more to bleed out. Although, since they were camping the body you kind‚Äôve had a reason to not go get him. I would‚Äôve been bummed out too but you‚Äôre ok.
---
.-. Yeah I think you meant to direct that at me. And quite frankly I don't care what you think. Selfish as fuck, sure. Why not? But really prayer beads? That's what you're gonna call unbalanced? Why cuz you get succed off gens? Oh no. The entire fucking Spirit is unbalanced. Still fun tho. I don't care who agrees with me. 
---
Also, I saw you comment to the wrong person way to jump the gun tiger c:
---
The Joker
---
&gt;Pennywise from IT. Any of the losers as survivor.
---
The guy who lost to children? I don't think he's a good fit lol.
---
Doc + Nurse would be an oof.
---
:(
---
&gt;  because everything in the game could be looked at as ''fair" if you take in all conditions. 
---
But there were no conditions for old BNP or instaheals. I think you know that, too
---
I still run because most of the time I'm too scared to think about that.
---
Every patch* fifty
---
Lolol
---
I swear. I've gotten finger-wagged at so many times as Hag. Just crouch when you get near the hook or when you're being unhooked. Unless they're one of those sub-optimal Hags that drops a million traps around a non-basement hook then you'll be away from the trap shortly and you can resume running normally. I always leave hooks immediately after putting somebody on them unless you've got some cheeky idiot who's hovering in the hook area in plain sight, but it's silly to assume the killer won't use their power to potentially turn one hook into two.
---
Nice picks
---
Absolutely stunning and beautiful
---
How do you get your perks and such to look like that?
---
can confirm, I've had 3 passive wraiths and *been* a passive wraith twice
---
There wasn't anything you could really do. If you had tried to save them you probably would have died as well. It's just people being toxic that you escaped and they didn't. Don't sweat it
---
Then i can facecamping and tunnel because my job is kill right?
---
I really want Shaun of the Dead

The person from the Hollow blight last year was not Vigo.  Yes, the cosmetics are called Vigo's apprentice, but did you actually read the diary entries that chronicled the cloaked man's journey? 
---
Diary number 2: 
---
"I discovered a hidden laboratory while running away from a monster. Its stocks are uncommonly plentiful. I observed shelves of alkaloids, crates of silver syringes, piles of protective clothes and a journal signed ‚ÄúVigo‚Äù. Its pages are filled with notes on an ancient force that controls the nature of this place‚Äîthat shapes it. I also noted a few drawings of the growing cankers I've seen on trees."

Diary 12:

"I looked for Vigo. I shouted his name with no concern for the monsters lurking about. I need to find him‚Ä¶ I picture the scene, etching a canvas of wild lines in my mind, focusing on the moon and I know‚Äîsomething is off. I fed the dead rodent under my pillow."

Why would the cloak man go find a diary signed Vigo and later go searching for Vigo... if he was Vigo?

---
You got it
---
I see you've leaked the prestige 4 reward.
---
On killer, around 40h. I would play Billy or Bubba for a few hours each rank reset to get lost of points quickly, for the most part, but recently I started to actually enjoy the standard M1 two-smack chase from the killer's perspective. My biggest problems are two: 
---
1. Patrolling gens on many maps in simply unviable without a chainsaw sprint or such. It just takes too long to go from point A to point B. If a survivor on the gen starts running away in a straight line early, I can chase them, which will take way too long to catch up, or I can not chase them, but then they will come back and finish it as soon as I'm out.
---
2. Getting the second hit off when playing against good survivors. Managed properly, the distance that a survivor makes after getting hit is almost always enough to get to a pallet town or whatever strong/overpowered structure there is on the map (ironworks window, abbatoir window, the entire disturbed ward, that one balcony on Haddonfield, etc.). Hit a surv with BL and see them beeline for the swamp pier kind of thing. Leave them and they'll heal
---
Good news you replied this! Thanks! Now looking back, damn ive been hearing them! one  burst of "huh" i just ignored and thought it was me
---
&gt; Now, if there were 2 or more dcs,
---
I don't think so, when I get slugged I get pretty annoyed with the killer because I know they are just trying to bait out my teammate and avoid a hatch game.I don't expect my teammate to come get me. I usually try to crawl away as far as possible and hope I bleed out lol
---
Yeah you are right, because I don't play Bubba.
---
And insta heals?
---
Yeah I usually watch like CardBeard (who just switch to dbd from ow) and who‚Äôs pretty fun to watch cause he‚Äôs good with chat, and plays pretty well plus he doesn‚Äôt complain, tho he will get slightly annoyed with like instaheals or people just farming each other
---
Had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
the fuckin dog is the best thing I've ever seen
---
killer good survivor bad
---
so killers eat shit and expect you to fall for their bait but get mad when you don‚Äôt. what‚Äôs new here? you did right, don‚Äôt human centipede for a teammate if you know you can make it out alive. especially for a random AND the killer was slugging/ camping. nah. you get your hatch. if a killer is camping a hook, the other three should be on gens. slugging is not really any different.
---
You picked him up once, he wasted the chance, that's how I view it, blame the killer for this situation not yourself, the killer needs to get more skill if he has to proxy a slug to get a 4k
---
Take your salt elsewhere, I don't have time for it. Besides, that's different from a perk being busted.
---
Yeah I wasn‚Äôt expecting to get these spot on, but I def really like the idea of killers as survivors
---
Because people cant adapt and learn her counterplays
---
I almost never even use items or add-ons
---
?
---
What if I'm bi?
---
See, but that's why intent DOES matter so much. Because as a player who plays frequently. You start to see the intent. A killer who plays the game enough see's a survivor out t bagging in a circle clearly not paying attention to them they're just gonna go take the free hit. A survivor being camped may see erratic movement in the killer such as not knowing places to insidious or other things that can indicate they aren't really sure what to do and are just trying to figure out. So sure. To newer players it can look like everything is toxic, but to seasoned players it just starts to roll off because they can tell where the intent is.
---
Yes xD actually have done it before myself so I don‚Äôt rlly get mad if a low rank does that to me
---
Thanks, that  confirms you don't know what you're talking about LMAO
---
PC, the smallest playerbase, should not be the litmus test for balance.
---
Head On, DS and Quick and Quiet is such a fun build.
---
Except OoO clearly isn't intended to be able to do this exact thing right here, which is why it needs changing in regards to Freddy. It's busted.
---
Yeah I enjoy playing killers but hate the wait times. Wish the rituals were at least a little more balanced.
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
someone explain?
---
My favoriteeeeeee. I love the meme builds. 
---
I love totem protector builds, and it works particularly well on Spirit. Though, as some are saying, I'd pick up Thrill of the Hunt, just so you can know when a totem is under attack and then phase to it.
---
I would play killer more if the queue times weren't 10+ minutes
---
Bruv have you never played a game where every survivor brings a toolbox last second and the gens get done in two seconds
---
I think his snares are too strong. instant uncounterable hindered is not good design. this is why I only run epic blood pallets.
---
I mean, you tried once to get them back up. Billy could have hooked them and went looking for you instead of wasting everyone's time. When I'm slugged and the killer is just hanging around to bait out the 4k I'll crawl away from the other survivor to bleed out so they have a better chance at a hatch play.
---
I said it must have been a high ping match. Hitboxes should account for high latency, especially considering this game is P2P. 
---
I'm not blaming the vault hit solely on hitboxes.
---
That's true I was playing the shape today and I killed every one with in 2 minutes
---
And by the other guy‚Äôs logic every perk that makes generators harder are a reward for the killer not being able to keep survivors off of a generator like they‚Äôre supposed to. I could literally play this game all day. Both adrenaline and NOED are pretty op both can be played around and prevented especially NOED considering you can cleanse all the totems to make it never go off.

It blows. It's gotten to the point where I just dodge lobbies if I'm playing Killer and see a bunch of "FARM PLS" display names. I don't want to spend 10 minutes or whatever playing the game in the most mechanically stiff and boring way possible just to eek out an extra 10k points or so.
---
Hahahahahahaha
---
Love that edit XD 
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not a strong build, I am at red ranks though and beat it sometimes, the thing is though, there‚Äôs so much in this game that is very strong. Like eboni moris.  Or as you said, swfs on haddonfield with instas lol.   
---
BUT, they aren‚Äôt every game, and I don‚Äôt usually fight a prayer beads spirit often. Just like I don‚Äôt fight a mori often.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs harmful, yaknow? Sometimes we have goofy matches, as long as they aren‚Äôt every single match, we should just move on to the next one lol
---
Instaheals are getting nerfed in the next patch, which is a good thing.
---
&gt; There is nothing wrong with her
---
lol just lol
---
&gt;if she was broken they would've changed her
---
it took them 3 years to come close to balancing Nurse
---
&gt;it's just about mind gaming
---
yeah dude totally legit mind games with the killer who can hit you while invisible with no indication of where she is
---
thx you so much &lt;3
---
I don't know why anyone would want to play nurse. It's so annoying how she gets stunned constantly from using her power.
---
Of course. I try to remember the person more than the idea. But hopefully you can try to do the same, friend
---
Wraith was literally the first killer I went against. It was fast. For me.
---
Sounds got fixed which were giant buffs for her
---
Didn't they already change instaheals to be like a heal over time? Or am I just making that up having seen it in a nerf post somewhere lol? I feel like they changed something about them but I don't remember what.
---
original and hilarious
---
what are they doing to them exactly
---
I like the indoor maps because they're more rare to play on in general. When you get 10 matches of the Autohaven or CORN tilesets over and over it's nice to have some different scenery and atmosphere.
---
You already know the answer to your title and I feel like you're just looking for some circlejerk action.
---
I heard there was one made for the Hillbilly, but I think it suits the Legion more.
---
I was just talking about people who thought she was bad in the ptb. I doubt the reason people hate spirit is because she was decent when she came out and some people said she was bad.
---
"I dont think im smarter than anyone here"
---
Do you read your own comments?
---
You know what? Dont answer. End it here
---
DISPLEASED
---
I put "alien" for the last answer. I guess "xenomorph" would be the more correct answer.
---
Exactly. Plus it never goes where you want it to go, and you can't really gauge distance properly. She's the worst killer on console. No two ways about it.
---
**SWF BULLY FAIL TOXIC WARNING THUMBNAIL**
---
The killer has the right to slug, and you have the right to not pick up the slug up. Why should you just hand him an easy 4k?
---
I've had games that have last an extra 10mins because of this. Not anymore, either the killer's gonna hook them after waiting or he bleeds out, I get hatch and now the killer only gets 2 kills.
---
Rip...
---
Are we getting them tomorrow
---
Trapper just shines the flashlight and suddenly sees Claudette‚Äôs shadow.
---
*s-stay away. I have a cleaver...*
---
Wait what?!?! I was trying to get plague adept and gave up after a few days. Do you actually have to just M1 everyone?
---
She's incredibly good and will still be good after the nerf. I just find her annoying to play as. You can definitely gauge distance with her. I've seen it happen constantly.
---
Why because I'll embarrass you if we continue?
---
They‚Äôre also for killer who come across toxic people or want to have fun or are having a bad day
---
There's a new movie coming out, so he's pretty likely imo
---
You know, I just might after meeting you, I just might
---
*when you see Claudette squatting in a bush and find out that you're not the only Crapper*
---
This happened to me with a Bill last night. First person I've ever straight up camped on a hook. Flashlight, pallets, and so much teabagging you'd think his button was broken. 
---
When I did eventually get him - which wasn't hard - I stood there and watched him go down. He dc'ed right after.
---
The killers job is to kill people, as long as they haven‚Äôt left, the killer hasn‚Äôt failed yet
---
Bubba let his girlfriend go in that absolute horrible sequel
---
They really don‚Äôt. The only age you can use is the date they were created. So if you want to go by that that‚Äôs fine I guess.
---
Going by any other factor is the most stupid thing I‚Äôve ever heard.
---
‚ÄúLike I want to think this girl is hot but she‚Äôs 16‚Äù
---
*devs patch it where they hit backspace and hit 21 instead*
---
‚ÄúOH YEAH SHES LEGAL BABY‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs fucking stupid.
---
I pray to God everyday I‚Äôm not as stupid as people like you. Like holy shit.
---
pretty hard to find masks for killers who only exist in the dbd universe and aren‚Äôt main stream horror characters
---
It should be 24 seconds with Botany Knowledge and 22.5 seconds if you add resilience as well. Calculation is as follows 16 / ( 0.5 \* (1 + 0.33 + 0.09))
---
If I go against too many Freddy's, I start running Object and follow him so I can destroy his pools/pallets.
---
I just started playing the game Saturday night and have basically only played killer, got an angry postgame message from a survivor that I suck because I had to camp but I was honestly just trying to use them to bait other survivors. I didnt know it was such a no-no
---
I honestly don't see that much hate aside from a few trolls, just people meming. True's a super good dude but he does whine and complain a lot, that's just a fact, some people don't care and some people dislike him for it.
---
Um what? PC has a bigger player base than any of the console versions
---
If you balance this game around 4 OPTIMAL survivors, then the rank 10 and below unoptimal survivors are going to have a hard time. Even in the games current state, unoptimal survivors have a very hard time doing anything efficient with their time and usually get dominated by the killer. 
---
It's hard.
---
Yeah I did, I still need to get one for demogorgon
---
Try your best to not be the one in charge of the hiring process.
---
The fastest I've ever gotten a game was like 5 minutes. I've waited 15 minutes several times.
---
t i n d
---
Now that was digging deep into meme knowledge
---
I've noticed on this subreddit that "fun to play against" is synonymous with "shitty against decent survivors". Prayer beads spirit is extremely powerful, but it is hard for me to take survivors seriously when they screech about everything. Especially since this hate boner for the spirit is new, and she's had this add on basically since release.
---
LF is one of those killers I only played when rank reset rolls around. As others mention, he's not great, so it's not you. I leveled him for BBQ and even now, I don't play him all too often.
---
Were these the models from Amazon?
---
its usually never a problem with billy or nurse since they just fast protrol the map with their ability, but in my experience, every other killer outside of them just hover on that half of the map waiting for the pick up. i wish i had the option to just commit seppuku when slugged just to kill myself. nea getting mad in chat afterwards ruffled my feathers not gonna lie.
---
Yup.  It's amazing how fast they ditch gens when the third stack of Devour Hope happens, or when they can no longer get an audio cue from skill checks.
---
No kids will be visiting your house
---
Ok, I will note that down for the sumary.
---
Peanits already debunked this. They merely asked if they could share this on their social media. They're not gonna use it for the game
---
Ironic. 2nd post in an hour calling killers toxic. Toxic much? /s
---
I play a ton of Ghost Face but am in no way an expert. That said, here are some tips I picked up on the way.
---
Don't give up on the stalking. It's the most fun part of his power so it wouldn't be fun to ignore it. When they don't see you, it's easy so I'll focus on when they do:
---
* Leaning is crucial as it reduces stalk time by half.
---
* There's a buffer when being revealed, even after getting behind something. It's not lag, you just need to get behind cover sooner than you think or you'll be revealed anyway.
---
* You don't need to 100% them every time. Pick your battles and stalk what you can before turning your attention elsewhere. Just remember who's who so you don't lose your progress with a basic attack.
---
* Split your attention. Ghost Face can juggle survivors just by stalking them while chasing another. 99%-ing someone while chasing another is like a free basic attack without having to completely disengage.
---
* Power recovery add-ons are your friend. Easily his best add-ons as they let you quickly finish stalking someone you only partially stalked.
---
* Detection perks like Discordance and BBQ and Chili are a huge help to know where you'll find survivors for easy stalks.
---
Ghost Face's stealth is the other main part of his power and can be just as, if not more, powerful than his stalking:
---
* Going into stealth mid-chase can confuse the chased survivor into thinking you've left them or are still nearby. Use this to end the chase faster or juggle other survivors who think you're still in a chase.
---
* Stealth hides your red stain. Use this mid-chase for stronger mind games. Loops where you can use your crouch are even better though rare.
---
* Stealth counters Borrowed Time, one of the strongest survivor perks. Try not to camp, but if they go for the unhook in front of you, activate stealth to nullify the unhooked survivor's extra hit. I usually use this to slug because I can immediately chase the unhooker, forcing a third survivor to pick up the unhooked survivor. Just remember that you need to be in stealth BEFORE they start unhooking.
---
* Detection perks like A Nurse's Calling are amazing for stealth because a healing survivor is an injured survivor who doesn't even need to be stalked. Definitely one of his strongest perks. Exposed perks like Haunted Grounds, Make Your Choice, and Devour Hope are also great to skip stalking altogether and can quickly snowball the game in your favor.
---
Other than that, Ghost Face relies heavily on killer fundamentals like mind games, map knowledge, and game awareness. You have very little to help you in a normal chase so ignore survivors who run to strong loops, but be ready to mind game at the easier ones. Some maps have some cheeky stalking locations. My favorite is the Ironworks of Misery, where you can go to the second floor and stalk people from across the map with them none the wiser. Lastly, know who is who and keep track of where they are. Juggling survivors is vital to slowing the game down by keeping them guessing where you are.
---
Finally, I'll give one of my favorite builds: Rare and Uncommon power recovery add-ons, A Nurse's Calling, Discordance, BBQ and Chili, and Devour Hope. Definitely not the strongest build by any stretch, but I have fun with it. For extra fun, replace Devour Hope with Play With Your Food and focus on stalking.
---
Damn I didn't know Frank was gonna become a U.S Senator before he got taken by the entity
---
It's more friendly for survivors. You can either play with friends or even if you're not doing great, you have three teammates. Killer, it's significantly harder to get started. 
---
Personally, I started as survivor, then, after awhile, for the week or two before rank reset *that* was when I started playing killer to learn it, because the rank 20s tend to actually be where they're supposed to. But even before that, I had watched a lot of videos about killers and how to play them, which isn't friendly for new players and shouldn't be expected of them.
---
Huntress is one lucky gal
---
If I had a dollar for every 3-minute game I‚Äôve had the displeasure of experiencing, I‚Äôd have enough to buy every cosmetic in the entire game. Also, there‚Äôs only one possible way for a killer to win in under a minute, and it‚Äôs when all the survivors DC within that first minute. I can tell that you have, at the very least, a slight Survivor bias (and don‚Äôt you dare say you play both, because that‚Äôs not a valid argument), so do us this one favor; play Killer for an extended period of time without Ruin or any other gen-stalling perk. That‚Äôll make you reevaluate your opinion on this for sure.
---
And another thing, I bet you‚Äôre the same kind of guy who complains about things like NOED, face camping, tunneling, Rancor, Mori‚Äôs, and other ‚Äútoxic‚Äù Killer things. I‚Äôm not saying that they‚Äôre good things, but I‚Äôm saying that you would probably go out of your way to complain about those things similarly to Killers complaining about genrushing. Am I incorrect?
---
I've always loved how much slapstick energy they give ghost face in the movies
---
You forgot to mention that most of those have "try me" or something like that as names. 
---
It happens pretty often when I play killer and it always ends the same way.
---
I down them (no insta down ability) within 10 seconds and they rage quit.
---
haha truly pathetic xD
---
A trick I use to ensure my daily doesn‚Äôt swap back or switch up is to delete the one I want to change, log out, then log back into the game to ensure the swap stuck.
---
I enjoy Noob3 as he was one of the reasons I even got back into this game since I was unmotivated to previously given Im trash \*-\*
---
Great run. However, on console as killer, when a survivor does the camera swirl move the fps is far smoother. For killer its like trying to hit a rain drop.
---
They really don‚Äôt want to appeal to the entire player base with these perks do they
---
I would respond sometimes but some players rage
---
That's just my personal reason for not upvoting (didn't downvote either), call it a guide if you like.
---
The reference was obvious and not executed in a novel way. Plus I feel like people here are getting sick of Samination references.
---
so help me out, cuz I'm newer to the game. But if I play against a killer running BBQ and Chili, Ruin, Haunted Grounds, and Thrill of the Hunt, or one of those swapped with NoEd, or some shit, I feel completely helpless. I can't beat that, so if I get downed, I shamefully want to DC before I ever hit my 1st hook If I'm having a good day, I won't. But I've had bad days where I've said you know what, fuck this guy, he doesn't get to play either. Obviously, DCing isn't the answer. But is that kind of build considered pretty toxic? Or is it something you just have to deal with? It doesn't feel legitimate to me and ruins my game experience
---
The totems pretty cool, but jake is like the laziest character to cosplay as.
---
I guess you havent played enough against spirits, you should watch some spirit videos and youll see What im talking about 50/50 chances
---
We‚Äôre getting bonus bloodpoint offerings tomorrow as well
---
My man is having a mental breakdown over this on my DMs LMAOOOOO
---
It is real... It's **not** toxic. You are just playing the game. But it's real. It's not the fault of survivors all they can do is gens.  
---
If you think doing all 5 gens in &lt;5 minutes isn't a rush then... there is no changing your mind. But again, no one blames the survivors.
---
Insecurity overload.
---
I hate everyone who plays dbd including myself lol
---
Yeah the tome comes out with challenges for the blood points but the blood hunt doesn‚Äôt start until the weekend
---
EDIT: I see what you‚Äôre saying now, I didn‚Äôt know we got offerings for the event. Thanks for the info!
---
I actually make sure to down survivors who do that to their teammate just to punish them for it, cause when I play survivor I absolutely loathe when my teammates do it to me
---
oh Daddyü§§üí¶üëå
---
It‚Äôs possible to get the achievement while using her ability but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a lot harder, when everyone was sick it really fucked with the chaser emblem :(
---
One must simply love Brenda.
---
When I play killer I was a huntress main then demo came out and now I have to regain my aim
---
You literally let Platinum..Keeling die on a hook. 2nd phase.
---
Hard farming bp or Inner Strength?
---
He does mention it even when he plays survivor and the other times but you have your mind made so whatever. SWF is the strongest thing in the entire game. So what does killer have in their perks or weapons or tools to counter it..? I'll wait.
---
What‚Äôs with the glowy edge? Does the weapon have that in game or was it a request from the cosplayer?
---
Never realised how hot pig was until now....huh
---
That's not evidence because that's only people who have responded to that survey.
---
No but I had a locker to show him if he said he likes them
---
Lol That‚Äôs very false
---
If you want evidence.  Play as ghostface and chase people.  You have no idea where he is when he pops his power and you‚Äôre in a loop or chase. 
---
And if you want to break him out of it, you‚Äôll need to look behind, making your movement less accurate.  
---
You can also watch recent tru3ta1ent videos on ghostface.  He shows a good way to play him
---
Yeah, they're equally shit perks.
---
That tru3 build is probably the best way to play him though lol
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dl27yk/bloodpoint_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
haha yeah that's what I thought. Nearly 2000 thousand unique responses? Not evidence of anything!
---
your personal fee-fees? ultimate evidence
---
You've never seen Halloween or Stranger Things if you think a fight with Laurie or Nancy would be easy
---
I'm glad you think you won the argument lol keep thinking that's 100% evidence lol I won't stop you
---
As others have said it's a bug. I had it happen to me with Meg a couple nights ago on console. It was definitely interesting zooming around the map but I didn't want to take advantage so just ran up to the Killer and let them down me. After I got unhooked it wasn't there anymore.
---
Can you provide literally anything to the contrary?
---
Honestly you'd be surprised, there are a lot of really good nurses on console, and also a lot of really good survivors that know how to juke her. It's the PC Huntresses that would scare me.
---
Unga bunga
---
I've sworn off of using Ruin. Corrupt is better in every way and the only way it can be countered is if (A) SWF team decides to hide and wait out 2 minutes (which is pretty unlikely) or (B) the survivors stack on other gens which is a mute point because if you had Ruin instead of Corrupt they still would have gotten a gen or two completed during those first two minutes. 
---
It's honestly better to run Corrupt Intervention plus something else like Dying Light or Pop Goes the Weasel. Corrupt slows them down in the early game while Dying Light slows them down in the later game.
---
I Dont get it
---
I had it happen to me as Meg on Console a couple nights ago. I was definitely moving faster than Sprint burst.
---
I was with you until ‚Äúspirit‚Äù
---
She‚Äôs not op or broken at all,  maybe her prayer beads can get a change but she is a strong killer who doesn‚Äôt need her base changed imo
---
You: finds *one* instance of a shit killer
---
Also You: **GOT 'EM**
---
Yeah, a fraction of the community responded to that survey. That's it, nothing more. I'm not clouded with judgement and ignorance thinking that I'm right or your wrong. That's not clear evidence lol
---
I was going to say the same thing. Laurie will stab you in the neck with a knitting needle and Nancy will knock you down with her baseball bat
---
She is? 
---
Legion is Canadian, didn‚Äôt know Nurse was...
---
i would like to run corrupt and thanatophobia with ghostface when i get the perks.
---
Quick question about that: Teachables don't show up in another killer's bloodweb *until* you've reached the corresponding level it was unlocked on the original killer right? 
---
So for example, BBQ isn't available until 35 on Leatherface, so it won't start showing up on another killer after I've purchased it until 35?
---
Right? And god forbid killers get creative with their powers. Survivors will cry en masse to get them nerfed
---
Banned cause he lost all of his data on the game like all of the legacy outfits and shit and the devs didnt do anything so he hacked hia save files and got perma bannes lol
---
We get Elvis as a survivor then
---
Just thought I'd throw out some tips against Nurse, since you were almost on the money already.
---
Line of sight blockers are her biggest enemy. Getting into a jungle gym or building so she has to guess with her blinks is the key to extending the chase or juking. Out in the open, you're basically screwed, but you can even use L and T walls to confuse her. This is enhanced by:
---
Be unpredictable. Half of playing Nurse is seeing where the survivor is running and blinking to where you think they'll be (or close enough). There are two different styles with this, and it'll be interesting how prevalent they both are after her rework. Some people like to blink right on top of survivors, where others like to blink close to them and use a second (or third) short blink, as it's more manageable to hit survivors with the shorter time to juke. If you fake a vault and she blinks, it gives you a few seconds to pick a different direction, and gives them a second time to make a mistake with their blink.
---
Lockers with Q&amp;Q are awesome against her. Most of the way I lose Nurses is with that, especially half decent ones. The only time it's totally helpless is against a great Nurse. Those games I just try to hang on as long as I can and try to do some fun jukes, cause when they get two hooks in the first 45 seconds you know it's gonna be a quick match.
---
Totally agreed with Spirit though, I'll die on first hook if it's prayer beads. They shouldn't get zero points from me for using something in game, but I ain't gonna be miserable and stick around so they can use it on me.
---
You tried to help that's all it matters, no shame in escaping if you already know he's guarding a slugged teammate.
---
surprise : keys are the same for survivor
---
Should have gone for the other save though. . .
---
It could be a way to get out of a dangerous situation or hide... If you get hit from the basement, you could use those 4 seconds to get a safe distance away from the place for instance.
---
Nah my friend bought demo and got ruin on his 2nd bloodweb
---
&gt; If it stays more than one minute of course
---
You must be new. It is insanely rare at high rank that Ruin sticks around longer than a minute. And even then there plentiful ways to counter Ruin such as: BNP and/or a really good toolbox, survivors stacking on a single gen to brute force it, gen tapping, and finally survivors that are consistent at hitting Great skillchecks. 
---
Corrupt is better in every possible way. It's guaranteed to stay for 2 minutes. No fucking way to counter. Only things survivors can do is fuck off and work on another gen.
---
I would say both but I'm a survivor. Also maybe the one that blocks gens when you are holding someone.
---
The first time I ran across corrupt intervention, I stayed next to the generator and stared at it for two hundred years before it released. I was super confused, kept walking closer and further away to see if I was doing it.
---
I don't think you did anything wrong given the situation. But I personally always make a play and try to be the hero. I will intentionally get hit and downed to replace the other survivor. But I also genuinely don't care about surviving my goal is just points. And I majority not the time don't need to survive to finish with most points in the match.
---
What company is this?
---
i‚ÄôM PrEVeNtInG NoED FroM aPPeArInG
---
Laurie is the one person who could take Myers, and Nancy goes toe to toe with Demo rather early on in the show's history. It goes beyond armaments to "these two could literally kill a person with no effort at all"
---
I don't see many insta heals(They're consumable. You can't just bring one every match, because that would be absurdly broken. It's also why you aren't refunded it even if you do escape) - Borrowed time is only effective if the killer A. goes for the unhooked person and B. decides to continue chasing said person. If you hit them and then start the chase on the healthy target, the survivor is forced to mend for longer than the recovery of the hit
---
DS is in a similar boat. Unless you literally have nobody else to chase, DS won't be a bother 90% of the time. There's the occasional cheeky play(I.E survivors run to unhook when their DS is active after another survivor is hooked, and they use that to get both people away, but typically, the DS'er is going down since the stun lasts for 5 seconds, and the drop down and unhook lasts for 3, giving you barely any time to make it anywhere)
---
There will never be four instaheals in the game, and provided you aren't proxy-camping and tunneling, borrowed time and DS rarely plays a part outside of when exit gates are open
---
NoEd always plays a part. It requires no decision making, no calculation, it isn't a perk that will die 20 seconds into the game and the killer can do pisspoor and still get pay-off
---
If the survivors play it poorly, they get either none or bare minimum effect out of DS and borrowed time(If survivors drop like flies left and right, borrowed time will never be in effect because killers are in a chase, and DS likely won't matter either because there's a chase ongoing when the survivor is unhooked, meaning they have no incentive to go back to the hook anyways)
---
All of the survivor perks are conditional. This includes Adrenaline, which requires the survivors to do well, and for an already healthy survivor, adrenaline is a single use sprint burst that is hard countered by noed anyways.
---
Noed isn't situational or conditional. No matter what it does, it's strong. Either it buys you an absolute bare minimum of 70 seconds(Or 56 if ruin is in play. Each totem takes 14 seconds. Even if everyone cleanses their own totem, and leave ruin in play, that's 14 seconds wasted across all of them, where they could either be running to or doing generators) - This means that noed adds a 6th generator to the game to be prevented. Alternatively, it isn't cleansed and pretty much guarantees a down if you're in a chase(Or even often enough while you're not initially in one because the killer will patrol doors, find you, and since most pallets are likely to be gone, you have no way to defend yourself from it)
---
Ruin can be prevented with the removal of a single totem, and even gives an indicator of when you have the opportunity to remove it because it's lit up. Noed will give no such indicator, and even if you cleanse 4 out of 5 totems, there's a very real chance it'll still take effect anyways, meaning you wasted 56 seconds on literally nothing
---
Activate Windows Gang
---
Oh shit, so it's just a rarity thing? Well I suppose that's better.  Hopefully it pops up soon.
---
Oh yeah, I didn't notice that until now. Regardless, the heal speed is fucking amazing. Being able to unhook then heal in like 5 seconds is awesome. Also I'd love to use Inner Strength if it wasn't part of a $12 DLC. I doubt they'll ever throw it in Shrine.
---
Exactly! Just because they come off as timid, they most definitely are super badass
---
I feel like Unsettled Tom would‚Äôve been better.
---
Don‚Äôt have a cow man
---
You have to get better at finding them. 9 times out of 10 survivors spawn near the gens that are blocked off by Corrupt. Otherwise you just have to know survivor spawns on the maps and/or run Whispers or use a stealth killer. Boom. Problem solved.
---
SCRAPE AND LICK
---
 Its just a mori,it‚Äôs fun to use and they are pretty rare.
---
We aren‚Äôt assholes for using them,
---
Sure, the original is gif.
---
you can choose the "excited version" or "calmed version".
---
Someone still dc'ed...... jesus.
---
&gt; a fraction of the community responded to that survey.
---
A fraction? That's nearly the average daily user count
---
&gt; That's it, nothing more. I'm not clouded with judgement and ignorance thinking that I'm right or your wrong. That's not clear evidence lol
---
Then why did you initially say that this community is killer mains if you're not saying either of us is right or wrong? huh weird. seems like you're backtracking after being proven wrong
---
so you have nothing. that's what I thought.
---
Edit: TBF, it isn't veteran player friendly either lol
---
It isn't new player friendly, but I think lots of folks (me included) would be down to swf or kyf to get people used to it.
---
I don't care who I face as killer, if they wanna farm I'll just murder them as I'd do to anyone else. They learn real fast when you don't wanna do farming.
---
It's pretty accurate, susie shows mercy
---
Yes, well neither do you. Congratulations we both got nowhere with this conversation. Next?
---
Too much effort, they won't do that
---
I still don't like playing against him. It scares me every time when I hear his footsteps stomping behind me.
---
Ahh I swore there was video of an exploit in gameplay he was doing. But genuinely not sure if that was him
---
Cannot comment on that. Lol I am hiring 50+ people though cause of opening a new location. Because I am away from my PC at home I am bored on Reddit all day now lol can't wait to go home.
---
A 3 minute game is a very productive game for a survivor, if they could do there only objectibe in this gave within that time it ain't there fault. Yes it feels fast but whatelse are they supposed to do.
---
I recommend you take this to r/sbubby
---
169,479 people in this Sub and only 1,835 people took part in that survey... literally 1.08% of this subreddit community, you‚Äôve proved nothing. That survey was posted 223 days ago (so in March) which is before we were flooded with new players.
---
I know this is sarcastic but this post was more of a we are all toxic thing
---
Even worse is they put Quentin even lower on the scale. Quentin Smith, who managed to loop Freddy Krueger before DBD was a thing. 
---
Feng Min certainly isn't that hard to fight, and I assure you that Ace probably isn't gonna whoop anyone's ass
---
How in the world do you play against Ghostface? I cannot. I can get reveals just fine but then I'm out there and have to run away and...well, suck at that haha
---
You can assert through tears and clenched teeth that a survey of 2000 people in a sub that maxes out around 2500 daily users is meaningless all you want, my friend. at the end of the day it's just a game and your desperate need for survivors to be victims on an internet forum doesn't matter.
---
I've played Myers and I used those add ons at the same time, but for me it didn't work, I had unlimited, but the second i mori'd someone I lose the infinite. I play console if that maybe the problem, but if not, I would like to know why it didn't work
---
Id like it between consoles but i have absolutely no interest in crossplay with PC.
---
Nope. 360ing doesn‚Äôt work anymore AFAIK.
---
Here‚Äôs what I do, and this is going to come with map knowledge over time. When doing a gen, you always want to be aware of the nearest pallet or ledge. Keep an eye on that area and be prepared to run for it when killer gets close. I also recommend using Lithe or BL over perks like SB or DH, since they help with structures as opposed to just letting you maybe dodge a hit for two extra seconds. 
---
Most maps also have a big ‚Äúcentral area‚Äù that acts as a jungle gym. Keep that in sight. Run for it. Structures, drops and ledges, rather than distance, are your friend.
---
Thana is okay. It's better on Freddy and Plague but here's the problem: Thanatophobia is still easily countered. All it takes is one guy with a really good medkit or running We'll Make It and that's that. Thana got countered. 
---
I've tried it at high rank. I ran Swing Chains + Sloppy Butcher + Thanatophobia with Freddy and a Bill running around with a really good Medkit was still able to heal himself in about 10 seconds. Less then that with other survivors. I could have used Franklin's Demise, sure. But that would mean running 3 perks plus an add-on to slow them down and essentially take away the ability to heal. But all it takes is one guy running around with We'll Make It and Thana gets countered. 
---
I would suggest Dying Light or Pop instead of Thana. There is absolutely zero counter to those perks.
---
Shit I didn't even realize I was crying. And from your response before. I never said this community is killer mains. I said that Killer mains in general group up toxic people with just "survivors mains"
---
&gt; 169,479 people in this Sub
---
This number does not matter. it includes dead accounts and people who subscribe to the sub but don't use it. the average daily number of users matter.
---
&gt; That survey was posted 223 days ago (so in March) which is before we were flooded with new players.
---
most of which are survivor players if you bother to check the new players mega thread.
---
do you have any evidence that this subreddit is killer main biased?
---
Id love PH ability to involve creating a fog cloud around him that he can see through but survivors barely can and they get slowed down inside it
---
Gonna go ahead and assume it's Wal mart.
---
Multiple people have already reposted this there before I got a chance, even though it's my OC.
---
Personally I don't think it's high quality enough to qualify there anyway.
---
its literally replacing pngs in the dbd directory and eac doesnt give a shit about that, never in a thousand years will someone get banned for it
---
I'm just giving reasons on why she didn't get hate sooner like this discussion is asking.
---
The question is why do people complain about her now and not when she released or more accurately when she got buffed.
---
Especially if you aren‚Äôt even Asian. At least pick another white character.
---
I enjoyed this.
---
&gt;  I never said this community is killer mains. I said that Killer mains in general group up toxic people with just "survivors mains"
---
huh that's fucking weird because your direct quote is:
---
&gt; Don't think it's from the community (cough killer mains cough)
---
Wow, that‚Äôs just ridiculous.
---
Nope. 3rd party company that works under a huge company like Walmart though. But it's not for Walmart
---
as a killer main, i agree. 
---
i also think ruin and bbq fall into the "lazy killer" category as well.
---
Ash would absolutely be #1 it's not even close. His entire hobby is killing powerful demons and deadites, it's his destiny. A bar fighting drunkard, a metal-loving artist, and a TV show host wouldn't even register on his radar.
---
Have Zombie Ed as killer who can summon zombies onto the map to grab survivors
---
Second worst killer in the game dont use it
---
I agree but I‚Äôve played matches where my team finishes all 5 gens super fast and all survive only getting about 1000 score..I‚Äôve dropped rank because of it
---
I don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúadapt‚Äù to a shitter Pig who does nothing but camp and tunnel while you have RBT on, I need to find another match.
---
Fucking everyone already makes ‚Äúsuggestions‚Äù for dis guy use killers you fuckwad.
---
idea: Shadowborn could bump up the color contrast, or even just slightly highlight survivors.  Or they could make a similar perk that could do it.
---
or they could make some skins more visible.
---
Yes. Once again, I was saying that Killer mains in general, group up toxic people with just survivor mains. You obviously don't understand what I was trying to say
---
Love you too fuckwad
---
Ash would beat every single Survivor in the game without trying.
---
&gt; You obviously don't understand what I was trying to say
---
no, you're just lying about it
---
this is so pathetic. is this mick mulvaney's account?
---
just to clarify things I just blinded him once and I wasn't even near, he was still blinded for the entire match, and then he sent me this video, I did nothing special or toxic, the game just hates him
---
maybe make it so that the only way you can mori a survivor is if their on the floor and the bleed out timer is halfway. That way so it makes it exciting to slug and gives survivors a side objective of trying to constantly keep away the killer from slugging survivors. This also would give killers and survivors the opportunity to utilize those slugging builds/perks.
---
&gt;Insecurity and toxicity are 2 separate things
---
Obviously
---
I'm talking about when a killer is being toxic. Not when a killer is camping tunelling. Reread my reply.
---
You are needlessly expanding the possibilities. i was directly comparing teabagging toxicity in terms of distractions, to camping and tunnelling toxcity in terms of a killer deliberately making sure one survivor they don't like dies. I'm sorry, but it is a worse level of toxicity on the killer side.
---
Saying that, a lot of what you have said is true. There *are* different levels of severity and toxicity (as I see it). There is no way around that. Ruining someones game intentionally is different to taunting in a chase. Sure both could be seen as toxic... but one is really toxic, the other is playful and depends on how angry the killer is.
---
Sure there are loads of reasons and it isn't black and white. But in general - killer toxicity is worse. They are the power player and meant to control the game - and when they sacrifice their own game (which they often do if they have been in a long chase with stuns, etc) to make sure a survivor dies.
---
&gt;And just because one doesn't make you "lose the game." Doesn't make it any less mentally or emotionally damaging when you're consistantly on the ass end of it.
---
It does. It is a different level. Sure there are situations with SWF toxic teams being assholes the whole game purposefully. But a bit of distracting doesn't compare. Can you not see the difference in legitimate toxicity? One is sour grapes, the other isn't. To me that is true toxicity. I know which person i would rather spend time with. Even if you view them as the same just because the person is being somehwat of an asshat.
---
Have a plan of where to run, if you are working on a gen you should know where to go if he comes near.
---
Omfg. Moving on, I just looked it up and the average daily players in August 2019 is 19,000 so yes. That survey was A FRACTION of the the players. Goodbye.

Nurse can be juked. Use walls and corn.
---
I love how knowledgeable you are on the topic
---
I 100% agree I play a killer sometimes for bp and gens go by very fast but that‚Äôs the objective
---
Give Susie any excuse. She'll try to look all tough like she really has to think about it but is glad you asked so she doesn't have to stab no more.
---
Oh god don‚Äôt suggest people use Q&amp;Q as part of a normal build
---
RIP Baby killer. I don't know what's worse he/she missing two clear shots or extremely unlucky  part. As you can see when he opened that closet your DS was clearly out, due to stupid bug (apparently time freezes during animation which prompted the DS). Welp, what can I say, lady luck worked in your favor!
---
post evidence
---
Have the Devs said anything about the Daily Ritual bug that will change a survivor daily when done instead of rewarding it?
---
I don't even understand what you just wrote numbnuts.
---
Goodbye guy
---
And everyone else hates the 500+ hour grind to get all the perks in the game. People don't farm because it's fun, they do it because a 250k bp game saves hours of progress towards playing how someone actually wants to play. Not everyone has been playing for a long time, so even if you don't like it, you should understand the justification people have for doing it and you have to expect it in a double bp event.
---
The hardest choices require the strongest of wills.
---
It depends if you are playing for a team draw (not officially a thing in this game) or a solo escape. If you play with the team draw mentality than you should go for the save as there would be no difference between a 3k and 4K. If you are playing for the escape then camp the hatch. 
---
Either way your teammates should not have handled it so poorly. That demonstrates their inability to handle this game emotionally and that is totally on them.
---
It's okay, your mother will kiss both of us goodnight tonight.
---
All players of both sides I know are the most reasonable people in this fandom. I never here from them "bohoo killers are OP" or "suvivors are to powerful" - mostly players who only play one side do this.

Were you using Tombstone Piece rather than Judith's Tombstone, alongside Fragrant Tuft of Hair? Tombstone Piece depletes some EW when you use it, which means you can kill up to 3 people before you run out of stalk and can't get back to EW3. Judith's Tombstone doesn't deplete it, so is the one that potentially allows you to stab everyone.
---
You should play killer up to rank 1 and hang there for a bit, bonus points for any games at rank 1 that happen like 1-5 days after rank reset. Spirit and Nurse are definitely pretty powerful, but saying killers have the advantage hands down and a few are quite overpowered is a dead giveaway to spot people who maybe played to green ranks as killer once every season or so and decided they know what they‚Äôre talking about. 
---
No offense to you, but I don‚Äôt think you could find too many well respected content creators or streamers or whoever you hold in high esteem that will tell you killers have the advantage anywhere outside of green rank.
---
Not saying killers are underpowered or that nurse and spirit don‚Äôt need some tweaking, but saying all killers have the advantage and anyone other than nurse and spirit are overpowered is certainly a hot take.
---
is this Before the Storm? Still need to play that
---
"Hey do you ever use that flashlight to actualy see in dark place?"
---
"What are you talking about? A flashlight used to actually see in dark place? Damn that's deep..."
---
I don't know who's buying masks like that anyway except to giggle at them and use as a conversation piece, you can get a full Ghostface costume with a true to movie mask for like $35.
---
In the early morning it takes me around 3 to 5 minutes to find a match, at night it‚Äôs almost instant but in the middle of the day it‚Äôs kinda slow at around 5 minutes of waiting usually.
---
Happened to me with a Laurie before. First and only one I‚Äôve ever facecamped lmao
---
Ace that high? Dude was just a gambler from what i remember.
---
Hey frick you kid video games were just fine when unlockables weren't stuck behind a paywall such as the these stupid battle passes that fuckin Fortnite started I missed when you were able to just do certain tasks to unlock these things like in gears of war 3 you didn't have told a pay dime you just had to earn instead of just playing the game in general
---
considering how many people are downvoting, yes
---
Exactly and it frustrates me that it's been ignored for so long, they just release things to try and dampen the speed at which gens are done but that's not enough, survivors should keep doing gens and don't let toxic killers convince you that gen rushing is a thing, it's the developers that need to balance things out
---
You really can‚Äôt say about jeff. His body type can either be a hidden powerhouse or a strong-looking marshmallow
---
My friend and I both look similarly to him. One of us is a punching bag, the other could send some to sleep with a single punch.
---
Nah the survivor is stupid for calling you a pussy and the killer is even more stupid for it as well it‚Äôs his fault for guarding the person that is down instead of hooking and looking
---
Me: We should stop objectifying women in videogames 
---
Also Me: NAKED MEN YASSSS
---
Maybe
---
If you're not in a chase already, the best thing to do is take paths that won't leave you out in the open. Most of the time this is okay, unless you need to rush to make a save. 
---
Stay out of the map corners and edges while in a chase (or even when not in a chase. This is even more important when there are no jungle gyms near the walls. Run to the centre of the map when you can, as there will likely be more you can use there. If you watch the top streamers, you'll very rarely see them in map corners or along the edge of the map until they need to leave.
---
You might not like this option, but if you're being chased or stuck in the middle of nowhere, take the first hit to get the speed boost to run to somewhere better. Yes, there are some crappy areas where even the speed boost won't help, but if you stay away from corners and the dead areas on forest maps, you'll be good most of the time.
---
Work on gens in crappy spots only when you know the killer is occupied with other survivors. Running a perk like Bond might help you see what other survivors are dealing with. Always plan your escape route from a generator as you get there. You want a couple decent options to get out.
---
Consider running a perk like Spine Chill. It gives you a warning when the killer is looking in your direction. When it lights up for a few seconds, you know the killer is headed your way and you can get a head start on running away (or sneaking away if you're in a bad spot and figure the killer hasn't seen you yet).
---
Hopefully some of this is helpful. Let me know if you have any questions!
---
Do you main killer or survivor?
---
I don‚Äôt think he was a Baby Killer just because he missed two hits, which happens to everyone, even to our favorite streamers. And the lit barrel is a great tool to disorientate both killers and survivors. 
---
And yeah, I got lucky his first attack missed me. I knew there was a dead end and I was hoping he‚Äôd know too and baited his attack. What else was I supposed to do? Desperate times, desperate measures. 
---
Luck is always important, especially when it comes to intense moments which require high concentration. Or video games in general.
---
It's even better when it's your first hook for the match and you have Deliverance and DS at the ready.
---
Why aren‚Äôt ash and bill peak killed, one is a veteran and survived a zombie apocalypse the other kills demons and monsters

Everyone ‚Äúsuggests‚Äù ideas for disguise killers, fucking everyone. You nimrod.

Can someone give me a countdown/time when the event will be live? Or the time they usually bring out a new patch?

I tried to make a Nea version first, but her model doesn't have rig in the face, and Steve had, so I ended with this

You're not as smart as you think you are. Stop posting that like its a fact.

50/50 split :)
---
He‚Äôs a killer, his vengeance still burns till this day
---
Zoe as a survivor for sure!
---
I don‚Äôt even remember who Frank is.
---
But it's another survivor, they leave the lobby when I join
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
Completely agree. Moris need to be changed. They are the the most commonly used OP item, especially now that insta-heals are being changed. 
---
And yes, they are worse than keys, too.
---
Do you think this sub is killer main biased?
---
The issues with Spirit were overshadowed by the issues with Nurse, especially Omega Blink. The problem with Spirit is a lack of counterplay. You shouldn't have to take Iron Will and Spine Chill just to be able to play against her.  
---
In my personal opinion spirit just isn't very fun to play against. With no access to information there's not much skill based play from the survivor side. Sure you can make a good guess as to what she might do, but that's all it is. It turns every encounter into a coin flip. With normal 50-50s in loops you are at least making a read based on the other players position and movement.  
---
A lot of Spirits will use player collision and crank their volume up to the points where they can easily hear footsteps and breathing. At that point she might as well just be able to see you. She just becomes a 176%+ ms killer who's invisible.
---
It‚Äôs a MODification.
---
The new one or the old one? The old one would be painful as fuck
---
Do not harass or insult other users lmao
---
Noob here, what‚Äôs haunted grounds? What happens?
---
How do you play against the new Freddy as a survivor? If you see him while you're awake and asleep, whats the point of falling asleep? Is there any advantage to waking up when he can still hit you whether you're in the dream world or not?
---
We already have Bill so I think a Tank could be fun. He could have a bull rush ability like hillbilly that downs people.
---
You do realize that you tried to use the number of people who play the game daily worldwide to make a point about this particular forum, and then immediately admitted you were wrong to do that, right? Or did you forget already?
---
That's.... what I said, 45 percent of this sub are killer mains, meanwhile a rough estimate of in game numbers is 4:1, or 20 percent being killer mains, so actually the sub has a 25, not 20, percent higher amount of killer mains or players than in the actual game. That difference is probably higher actually, given how queue times for Killer have gone down significantly lately, meaning less killer players and more survivor players.
---
ghostface?
---
Balanced landing because it has more uses and you do not need to be injured.
---
Doo Doo Doo Doo *Doo Doo Doo*
---
Balanced landing without a doubt. It‚Äôs helpful on almost every map, and most killers bait out dead hard nowadays. Even when you have exhaustion, it‚Äôs still helpful, so it‚Äôs an obvious choice
---
I was playing against a Freddy this past week, and I was the obsession. I was not running any obsession perks, and as far as I could tell after the match, neither was he. One of the other survivors was running DS, which is likely why I was the obsession.
---
Throughout the entire match, my sleep timer would progress faster than everyone else's. It wasn't a lot faster - maybe 15 - 20%? Is this just a standard effect on the obsession, or is there something I missed that causes this?
---
Happened to me with a Steve. It was at the beginning of the match. He made one wrong move, got downed, and raged quit.
---
I checked his account, and he literally went to play Friday the 13.
---
I still think it would be awesome for ghostface to be able to hide in lockers, like how many times did he exactly do that in the films?
---
But this is completely irrelevant! Literally no one is talking about that but you **because it is irrelevant**
---
Is a gateau a map offering or some shit?
---
Never noticed someone posted it, seen it on Facebook thought it was appropriate, chill out lol
---
All I can think of rn is your attempt to divert my evidence by saying I was lying when you couldn't come up with anything to further the argument.
---
Telling them to get fucked the same way killer does vs SWF? aww man must suck for them
---
Was having rough killer games last night so I brought PB spirit. They just stopped trying. 4 man 5 gens. The only 'counter' I've found is iron will but even then it's almost up to chance.
---
Me too
---
Dweet would whoop your ass
---
I just like the animations

Your evidence? The evidence you yourself admitted was not applicable to the discussion?

holy fuck

Moris aren‚Äôt unfair, the same way how survivors have strong items/perks/offerings, killers have that same advantage too.
---
11am ET, usually.
---
you really NSFW this?
---
This but unironically, my last ten games I've lost because some fuck at rank 8 can't win without NOED and I will never let this happen again
---
i'm waiting
---
Because games should be balanced, not have one side guaranteed victory just because they chose a game-breaking character, as you get with basic competence with Nurse.
---
The most fun is running a shroud if separation so they freak out until they figure it out.
---
It's better to be awake for a number of reasons. First, you can't hear his terror radius when you're asleep, only his lullaby. The lullaby won't indicate the direction he's coming. Second, you won't be affected by his traps or fake pallets if you are awake. Also, if he is using add ons that affect your action speed while sleeping, it might be beneficial to wake up.
---
I‚Äòd spend my monthly salary for this
---
I agree 100% this play style makes him top tier even in red ranks
---
I've had mixed results. Depends on the Piggy you're dealing with and if you're the last one alive.
---
I'm seeing a distinct lack of body attached to this mask. Nice enough mask though.
---
I have like 30 ebony's across multiple killers, never use 'em. You get no points, no pip, and don't have to use your brain. 
---
I think people who get bullied bust them out the next game to feel better.
---
No. The evidence you think I used myself to admit it was not applicable to the disscusion. Please guy go back and reread everything we said because your def missing something from the conversation. And/or confused about something that was said. I don't think I can make you realize how delusional you are. So goodbye for good this time.
---
When ur in the dream world his abilities of dream pallets and dream snares are in play. Also he could be running an add on that slows down progression while in dream world.
---
It's not the "infinite loops", it's the stupid amount of safe windows. Not the same thing. If you want to see real infinites, go watch videos from 3 years ago.
---
That's true tho, I reckon almost everybody will buy it including me.
---
???
---
For those who dont understand he is referring to the iridescent head add on
---
She‚Äôs a lot more counterable.  A really good Nurse can probably fairly easily get a 4K but there‚Äôs a lot more risk when she blinks since it‚Äôll slow her down more.
---
/r/DBDGoneGay
---
Yesterday I had a match as spirit where I downed someone, and they left immediately. I was using two yellow add-ons, hadn't hooked anyone yet. Whats the point of playing if you dc immediately after first down? Like wtf?
---
Everything
---
maybe I am mistaken. can you post the evidence again? I'm willing to admit I missed something if i did. what was it?
---
It's an old anniversary event offering that's just like Bloody Party Streamers, it gives a 103% BP boost to all players
---
Farming **is** boring.
---
Probably Balanced Landing considering how you already have it (probably a better perk too.) Dead Hard can be really fun juking out the killer though, so I recommend trying it at some point.
---
Hook?
---
Damn, must be an old ass offering. The oldest offerings I have are BBQ invitations.
---
Falling asleep means you start seeing his fake pallets **or** start getting affected by his loop-killing puddles. It also makes you Oblivious to Fred - you don't get to see his Terror Radius, and any Terror Radius perks won't work (so if a sleeping person with Borrowed Time saves someone, *Borrowed Time will not activate* - even if Fred is literally right beside the hook). Being asleep means his teleport recharges faster, and he can use add-ons that slow your action speeds while asleep.
---
So yes, lots of reasons to stay awake. Getting hooked wakes you up. Not good. Failing a skill check wakes you up (depending on add-ons). Also not good. Having someone perform the Wake Up action on you will wake you up, but the time taken for the action will double every time it's used. So-so. Alarm Clocks wake you up and keep you awake for 30s longer than normal. Quite good, if you find your Clock fast enough.
---
Tbh, I don't know wtf a Tyde-Tyme or Ardetha is.
---
I love mori's. I know how surprised the survivors get when you do that after a 1st hook. I know the feeling of surprise and helpelessness.. Ahh, evil never tasted this good...
---
I don't know and I don't really care if it is or isn't, but acting like your ONE little survey from 6 months ago that only a fraction of the community responded to is some kind of factual evidence is embarrassingly stupid.
---
My dumbass never realized that skin was supposed to look like a jack-o-lantern

Bro, your mind is so big. This is the best meme on this SubReddit bar none
---
How is it irrelevant? There is a clear bias in this sub, the number of killer mains is hugely disproportionate compared to the actual in game numbers. Even if the number of survivor mains is higher, it doesn't mean there isn't still a bias.

In the past, the updates are usually live around 11 to noon Eastern. You can get a notification by signing up for the dbd discord, or following them on twitter or instagram.

I should mention that this year my pumpkin is about twice the size so I can be a bit more ambitious maybe do a few different perks or something :)

Yeah I saw this too. A Claudette spawned it but never actually moved, then eventually the match cancelled for the same reason.

Excuse me, there's an uncensored version and you're not just putting a link here?
---
~~putting it on the other sub would work too.~~
---
We honestly just need to call it something else. Rush implies that the surv is going out of their way to do it when really no toolbox doing gens is pretty fast. Don‚Äôt get me started on how often people pick a toolbox at the last second though.
---
Most killers don't understand how to maximize their pbs while getting a 3 or 4k. They think that getting a 4k is all that matters but at red ranks you still depip if you finish the game too fast (which is dumb imo). Typically the longer the game, the better experience it is for both sides. The same point can be made for survivors. They think that escape=win so genrush. Wrong.
---
Farming realy is boring. Fuck your farming, I play the game to play the game. Get yourself a game that gives your everything right off the bat if you want to have everything the easy way
---
Hm, yes that‚Äôll work, thank you :D

I'd align my opinion with the pros and say she's still #1 because she can still completely ignore even the most powerful loops, it'll just take a bit more skill to do it now.

Dead by Daylight Movie confirmed

Why is this game so expensive? I just bought this game and I love it but each killer pack is so expensive and now they‚Äôre adding a battle pass system? This game should be F2P
---
I want to say that I‚Äôm new and am a total noob
---
doesnt Change the fact that its boring af and more Fun to actually play the game
---
The difference between now and then is that killers learnt to play her, and has little to no counterplay when they know how to play her. That's why the spirit is seen as OP now and not a year ago.
---
That's a similar situation to what happened to pallets nerf a long time ago. You had something like 40 pallets in the classic maps (Coldwind, Auto-Haven, MacMillan), with double pallets at every jungle gyms, yet it wasn't OP because survivors didn't know well how to loop yet.
---
Once they became better, this then became seen OP and a problem for killers, and it has been nerfed for balance.
---
See, that's as simple as this, even if something is untouched that doesn't mean it isn't OP by today's standards when it wasn't OP before.
---
&gt; How is it irrelevant? There is a clear bias in this sub, the number of killer mains is hugely disproportionate compared to the actual in game numbers.
---
Because I was never talking about the comparison of real world players to reddit players?
---
&gt;  Even if the number of survivor mains is higher, it doesn't mean there isn't still a bias.
---
How does there being more killer mains on the sub than in the real world game mean there is a killer main bias in the subreddit when the subreddit still has more survivor mains than killer mains, pray tell?
---
&gt; All you did was post some BS survey that's as worth while as me making a survey asking people their favorite color and then you act all smug about it as if its 100% proven fact.
---
if you took a survey in a community with around 2500 active daily users and 80 percent of those users chose blue, then yeah it's a fact that blue is the favorite color there
---
do you have literally anything to counter me? or no?
---
(hint: I know you don't)
---
Lightweight, Iron Will, Urban Evasion and Quick and Quiet will effectively counter Nurse and Spirit. 
---
I run perks to counter the best killers. I‚Äôm not worried about the Wraiths and Demogorgons.
---
Prayer beads are the only thing remotely OP about spirit, change my mind.
---
There‚Äôs not much you can do except going out of your way to farm your teammates
---
haha uh oh someone is bigmad
---
Yes, many people, as you can see in an earlier reply in this thread - it also has a link to the official forums. 
---
The details have been passed to the team, we're now waiting to hear further.
---
Great, I hate farming my teammates, thanks anyway
---
i've also seen you in particular claim this subreddit is killer biased so oof my dood
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a shitty achievement, especially because the number is so high.
---
Not to flex bit over wasted a large portion of my life playing this game when I could've been studying and being productive (850 hours by the way)
---
First of all, your first comment in this thread is questioning whether the sub is killer-biased or not. To see if it is, we have to look at the compared groups. the groups available are: # of killer mains in game, # of surv mains in game, # of killer mains on this sub, # of surv mains on this sub. If this sub did not have a bias towards one side or another, the ratios between in game and sub groups should be roughly the same. They **are not**. This massive discrepancy is called a **bias**. Google a definition if you need one. It doesn't matter that the number of survivor mains is higher, there is still a bias towards killer mains on this sub.
---
If it glows it goes
---
yeah, you can buy almost all of the original characters with shards you earn by playing the game
---
WDYM? 500hrs is perfectly reasonable! What? Do you have a *life,* and *responsibilities* or something?
---
Basically. Always get people who act civil until one asshole comes along and is like "(something stupid) iS oP bHvR sO (other side) sIdEd NeRf (underpowered thing) AnD bUfF (overpowered thing)!"
---
I love how people disliked you for saying the truth. I remember when she first came out and was ranked C tier, then they changed one addon and suddenly she‚Äôs a god.
---
I thought I heard something about it being reportable to farm or something
---
Ya never thought of that thx man.
---
You really think you had the upperhand or something? Didn't know you were delusional
---
Also no dumbass I have a life to live instead of waiting all day for a stranger to reply.
---
Also you are a large hypocrite.
---
Yep. It‚Äôs amazing.
---
I crawled into its cage when it thought it‚Äôs puppies were still around (we gave them away.) this was the time when dog+bite human=needle. So ever since, it‚Äôs been dead and is just some bones and ash in an in-openable box we have. Ironically her name was kamikaze.
---
I fucking wished it caught your eye before dying, so you wouldn‚Äôt have to live to see the shit you commented. Fucking pathetic bastard. Then again you have a dad so you aren‚Äôt a bastard huh? If you were that dog though you would be a BITCH. I ducking despise you. I would pay to watch you suffer, but not pay to be the cause of your suffering. Unless I was requested to, I wouldn‚Äôt expose your killer if I knew who it was.
---

---
I think adding Chis Walker, Richard Trager, or the Walrider from Outlast would be so fucking cool to have in the game.
---
No i thought we got passed the point of being douchebag where we both maturely agreed we were both wrong with miscommunication, but then you proceeded to tell me I'm still incorrect; which how tf am I with clear evidence and explanation. And preceeded to be a douche and tell me my English is embarrassing.  So actually yes, I am bigmad you fucking douchebag. Good Day.
---
On PC my understanding is that 360s are having trouble because the dedicated servers are still not working well. that's different than 360s just simply not working anymore
---
The 3 year anniversary event. It didn't last that long IIRC so if you took a break around that time then that's why you don't have them / haven't heard of them.
---
Just 2999 more to go if you want a brown toolbox!
---
M e t t l e  o f  M a n
---
The 3rd anniversary
---
Yea that's why. I took a break for a few months so that's why. Thanks stranger!
---
oh no i am toxic af buddy
---
enjoy being wrong about everything
---
Bill might have him. Yeah Ash fights demons and all, but he does this with a chainsaw and shotgun, with friends. Bill killed a zombie horde alone with a bonesaw. Under anesthesia.
---
For Joker‚Äôs neutral special, he wields a gun.
---
"Thank you very cool" can do wonders.
---
you are doing mental gymnastics to act like there isn't a survivor main bias here lmfao wow
---
sorry d00d but there are mire survivor players in this sub than killer players
---
This makes me wonder. Do survivors carry the bloodpoints in their pockets like Adam carries his pebbles? How the hell do they hold up to 1 million of them? Is that why there's a 1 million cap?
---
survivor mains are such dishonest professional victims
---
Lmao üòÇ my friend said the same thing maybe throughout my school year I'll print more and more until I can get a brown toolbox
---
I've heard that its an hour a day thing, 70 hours total, for all 90 levels. You can just do the free path and see how far you get before buying the pass, you'll get everything retroactively
---
Alright then. Please explain to me what I'm wrong about then. Because you gave me the chance to explain all this mess.
---
I know it doesn't exactly excuse the amount of transactions this game has, but BHVR is  fairly good about putting everything but the latest DLC on sale regularly. It's pretty common for everything to go at least 50% off for major holidays and other reasons. 
---
They do allow you to to do purchase characters and perks for free with Iridescent shards, which if you don't have a burning desire for cosmetics, will quickly pile up and you'll have more than you know what to do with. So this can also be a way to dent the overall cost of the game, as long as you're okay with missing out on some very sub-par bonus cosmetics for buying the chapters with real money. And I'm talking incredibly minor cosmetic changes. 
---
For example, with the Stranger Things chapter, [this](https://imgur.com/a/iz8O5Pg)  is the 'bonus' cosmetic you get for Steve if you buy the $12 bundle. And that's about what to expect for all the chapters with this.
---
The battle pass remains to be seen on how awful it is to get to Tier 70. But at least the good news is, you'll earn back your $10 so it's a 1 time investment and then you'll just constantly get free cosmetics every new battle pass.
---
I like the legion
---
My counter is that thats not how facts work, but go on, keep acting like you're smarter than everyone else.
---
I have no disagreement with the concept of "If it's in the game, it goes." Especially when it comes to "OP" perks and add-ons. But there's the human aspect of this game beyond that which transcends the game mechanics. 
---
There are things that players elect to do for the sole purpose of antagonizing another player. That makes the former an asshole. The asshole might blame the recipient of said negative attention for reacting, but the asshole is the one causing unnecessary drama in the first place. It's in the game. You are allowed to do it. But people are allowed to react negatively to it as well.
---
After going five seconds of going through your post history, I can confirm that you aren't as smart as I though
---
I mean, you DO post on r/dankmemes so i assume your only quality in life is writing a lot and acting smart
---
Pornhub.com
---
&gt; video games were just fine when unlockables weren't stuck behind a paywall 
---
I'm not saying that anything needs something like the battlepass. And I also don't think that DBD will be better thanks to the battlepass. I'm just saying it won't fuck the game. It will have barely any impact on the game.
---
They don‚Äôt reward the killer in the end. You rank up and get more BP through longer games, ending them quickly just displeases the entity. It‚Äôs still kinda homo when you get mori‚Äôd
---
Bits and pieces goes on sale periodically and most of the killers and survivors are buyable through Iridecent Shards. The Licenced stuff is money only so those are more rare. You just gotta grind it out. 
---
Plus the battle pass Has a free variant that you don‚Äôt need to pay anything for, so that‚Äôs no forced money spent.
---
With Sprint burst ready too
---
ayy, it's ^(punishment) time
---
I recently started playing survivor more (doing my part to help the killer queues) and a bloody jake was fucking with a poor baby hag (rank 20, no perks) , t-bagging and flashlight clicking constantly, sandbagged the shit out of him and bodyblocked him whenever possible, and when he finally got downed, farmed him off the hook, dc'd when he got downed again because I stood in front of a pallet :)
---
Good question and it's the same question for the Pok√©mon series how tf does ash carry all the poke balls
---
Yeah exactly what I'm saying people constantly say that but it's not relevant
---
Using my own insults against me now. Yawn. Also upperhand? What are you an anime protagonist?  There is no upperhand. As for hypocrite, perhaps. But I don't even think you know what the word means based of your ineptitude to fully grasp the situation.
---
Explanation he probably got a perk then went for the iri box and he got lucky and got it, the pun comes in to play because the iri item is hidding in the box like it couldn't hide from him.
---
David's dick goes fucking flying
---
you're wrong that this community is killer biased. i know you're going to screech something about how you meant toxic killer community, but after the discussion shifted to the balance of the forum you de fact assumed the position that it is killer biased, which it is not
---
Quentin was no pushover- sure, Freddy stabbed him, but he definitely put up more than a fight. Laurie took down Michael twice in the original just by using her wits, quick thinking and what was around her.
---
It‚Äôs a guilty pleasure. The stalking murders are fun. But I just got Ghostface... now I can always be stealth man.
---
Now I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs become a cliche, but almost every survivor I encounter with Object of Obsession has disconnected on their first down almost every game I‚Äôve encountered them.
---
I have 2 cliches now that seem to be true more often than not. 
---
1) bubba will camp. 
---
2) Object of Obsession will disconnect.
---
haha "that's not how facts work" screeches the survivor main who thinks the subreddit is killer biased at a well done survey which proves otherwise
---
I wasn't planning on it since I know that certain person already is dead, so i didnt know playing as her mattered since I know how it ends for her ;_;
---
No mither + self care, iron will, and inner strength.
---
I hate how I can actually see the resemblance.
---
I feel like this should be Ochido. He is way more toxic but thank god behaviour banned him. Sometimes I still see his stupid fanboys with the P3 claudette and flashlight. In post-game writing gg baby myerino or something.
---
thank you
---
TBH I save moris for streamers. 9 times out of 10 they're toxic af and deserve it
---
I posted this about the killer,  and ONE team mate disconnecting for NO reason. Not whining about how they're playing or what they're running you dumbass. Lolololol. You're weird as fuck.
---
it‚Äôs legitimately uncanny
---
No, I thought it‚Äôd been resolved but it happened to me last night.
---
I literally said I was confused about that in my explanation. I admitted I was wrong and confused in my huge summary of everything that happened. Didn't you read it?
---
I main David King and get tunneled relentlessly every game. I think it become an issue of the killers ego at that point üòÇ
---
I have only played 80~ hours of DBD and so far I've mained Pig, but not ONCE have I ever played against a Pig.
---
^ This is my best guess as well. Clocks give you a 30 second 'immunity' window where the timer doesn't move. Whereas if you fail a skill check or have someone else wake you up, you immediately start another 60 second countdown to falling asleep.

You're not funny.

Gottem.
---
New players get bumped to the head of the queue - but bear in mind that 4 survivors are needed for every killer.
---
For the shortest queues, ideally you want to be as close to "prime time" as possible. What's your region, and what time of night are we talking?
---
Oh! Well, thanks for the mod anyways! :)

---
Memes, points, and to piss off killers
---
You'll get better at chases the more you do them. Just keep playing and practicing and you'll be fine most likely.
---
Seriously what now? Literally Once again, what was a wrong about? I proved my point saying that killer mains group up toxic people with survivor mains. YES, I GOT CONFUSED ALONG THE WAY ABOUT THE PERCENTAGE OF PLAYERS. But I was not wrong about my initial statement.
---
It's just experience. Check the looping guides [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d5elu7/guides_resources_for_new_players/) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqpGXoLSDNEUrBfACKnAhVA/search?query=loop) if you want to get ahead of the curve.
---
Don't lose faith!
---
So what if a killer just tunnels and camps so they can keep their add-ons?
---
Poor friday the 13th. Should've just entrusted the licensing to bhvr. Never played it but I heard it's dead, like a lot of cool looking survivor killer games lately
---
I play gf with noed but I still stalk ppl because I'm not a dick and only use noed for the haste
---
I've been hating myself since the beginning
---
Hey guys!  First time posting on Reddit.  I've started a food blog called Geeks and Gouda and one of the things I wanted to make for months now is a Survivor Pudding.  My husband streams the game a lot, so I learned about the game through him.  It inspired me to come up with this recipe and I wanted to share it with you guys.  (For the record, my husband is a Killer main who occasionally plays Survivor.)
---
If you're interested in more *Dead by Daylight* themed recipes, let me know!  You can check out the rest of the blog [here](https://geeksandgouda.com/).
---
Oh, I didn't  know that there was a pink one! Thanks!
---
You get a pass you're cool
---
This is why i avoid red ranks. All ridiculous add ons, 100% of the games. On both sides.
---
Okay, prayer beads are not the only thing remotely op about Spirit.
---
Your mind is now changed.
---
I don't break dull totems because it gives more chance for noed to spawn at a totem I know of
---
did you post it at r/DBDGoneGay or r/DBDGoneWild? if not PLEASE do it, cuz i'd love to get every version of this masterpiece
---
With how servers tend to be, might be a laggy nightmare.
---
The hag looks at the survivor when they trigger the trap and follows the direction they‚Äôre in for a couple seconds so when you teleport you‚Äôre supposed to be looking at them.
---
I'm sure some players would like that, but the devs have said they're fine with it
---
I felt that way too for a long time, especially when I solo queued. My best advice would be not to be afraid of getting in chases, and to always try planning your escape route where ever you are. The perk Spine Chill can give you an early warning when the killer is headed your way if you want a head start.
---
Youtube some looping tutorials, or watch some of the better survivor streamers. I'd recommend FunGoose - he explains what he's doing and dedicates the second half of his streams to survivor most of the time, and has youtube and VOD content on twitch. Puppers is a good looper too, but his content is more entertaining than educational.
---
&gt; I proved my point saying that killer mains group up toxic people with survivor mains
---
how? with what?
---
Ash is all sorts of badass, but literally all he can do is whatever is currently helpful for fighting deadites. In a one on one fight with another human being, no guns and without the chainsaw arm, Bill could take him. If we're going with them both having their preferred armaments, Ash would have to get within shotgun range of Bill who'd be packing two 1911s, and an M16
---
Lmao this is my go-to excuse. But I really just like the points after cleansing all of the totems on the map, and then having time left over to complete a few gens. That and fuck NOED.
---
Jake survived in the woods on his own.  Adam is a teacher and Ace is an old man running away from his gambling debt.  They need to switch.
---
That too, but I mean... I don't really understand what I did wrong, I just found a guy and hit him as a fucking Trapper
---
Or pig. Or T1 myers. Or a hag trap (with make your chouce, of course) or nearby demo hole
---
It depends on the situation, but yes it can actually be very difficult to facecamp a specific survivor when they have meta perks.
---
But I mean if you're Bubba going for 1k and you don't care which one you get, that's pretty easy.
---
Same problem with freddys bloodpools, on some parts of the map his pools spawn slightly under the map (example: parts of red forrest)
---
Sure it is, and so is grinding with no perks for new players. They also want to play the game, and just picking a different game that has better progression doesn't keep them from liking DBD. Farming will never be less boring for experienced players who only care about normal gameplay, but such players can at least understand the perspective of new players and help them integrate into the community.
---
Quinten got stabbed/tortured by Freddy and kept coming, risking his life to save his friends in Elm Street. Laurie has been tangoing with Myers for 40 years.
---
Most of the time they have a posse with them to skew the votes :(
---
I usually respond with "mad cuz bad" and most of the time get a death threat or just general toxicity. Makes my day :)
---
Apart from the fact that it doesn't work on T1 Myers, and in a patch or two's time won't work on shrouded GF.
---
And that doesn't change the fact that the grind for perks in this game takes a very long time for casual/new players
---
I was aware of the loading in thing, but didn't even think about it affecting the clocks. Interesting. Thank you!
---
This is too much of a serve, idk if dbd is ready
---
[Calm down son, its just a drawing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QmGe--FXqU&amp;t=19s)
---
Spine Chill really isn't that great compared to the other super-meta perks around atm.
---
In their blood. Duh.
---
One of my favorite moments playing a killer is when a cocky survivor who thinks he's good tries to provoke me but he ends up losing. So satisfying. Even better if they DC lol.
---
Well can‚Äôt argue with that
---
That's not what he said. He's saying on top of that here's what new lfs do. That being said I don't think he's the worst in the game. Clown doc and legion are pretty bad.
---
Stake Out, Self Care are useless. Empathy is ok if you don't have many perks available but there are many stronger perks. If nobody runs DS, there is no obsession and the killers knows they don't need to slug. DS is still probably the strongest non-exhaustion perk at rank 1, hence why so many survivors use it.
---
Now you just need to enable "lift z on layer change" cuz that line in the middle is driving me nuts ;)
---
An increase of 25% of killer players means there is an existing bias, the number of survivors being higher than killers doesn't matter, the sub has a higher than normal amount of killer players, which means it has a bias towards the killers. NOT in the sense that there are more killer players, but in the sense that there is a higher number of killer players than the in-game numbers would indicate, they are over-represented. The numbers you're insisting so much on are only important in understanding how they differ from in game.
---
Am I the only one that thinks those addons are stupid? I mean what are you supposed to do in a game in which you face a constant T3 Myers?
---
Ye, i agree by far
---

Why is this downvoted lol this is true

Ghostface is scarier than the pig. Change my mind
---
For me, Myers is the scariest. Ghostface stalking isn't scary, same with pig or wraith. But Myers suddenly appearing near the gen you were just repairing... Holy fuck

Fight fire with fire, or in this case toxic with toxic.

What software do u use I use Fusion 360 and don't think I have that option
---
Ya know what? I'm to defensive about all this and you're right. I was wrong about everything and your superior now. Sorry I couldn't come up with ANY facts this entire time you've been insulting me and trying to manipulate the situation and coming up with ANY excuse to justify your point. But I just realized we've been fighting for over an hour, and we aren't getting anywhere. And I don't need to explain myself to a complete stranger on top of a complete douchebag. So go ahead and be a narcisist trying to spin this around saying that "I'm saying all this shit because I don't have proof to my argument" but kindly fuck off and i will never talk to you ever again. Please, have a nice life because I won't ever remember you or this conversation for the rest of mine.
---
That's incredibly efficient, surprised you can do that. I have around 400 and have one p3 and still have one survivor to get to level 40.
---
Except Bill is out of his prime, he's states this multiple times. I'm not saying Bill can't handle himself in a fistfight. But Ash has shown that he's arguably stronger in his old age then he was in his younger or atleast just as strong and I ain't gonna talk weapons cause Ash packs Magic up his sleeve (Especially in the evil dead comics and games).
---
Learn English before you make an insult you fucking idiot
---
I know it's a popular opinion, but I honestly don't understand the point of rank reset. All it does is muck up lobbies every so often.
---
I'm not disputing that, simply emphasizing the relevance of the perspective of new players.
---
Laurie was a scared teen who barely managers to run away in like every scene. 
---
Steve and Nancy relied on 11 to take care of the heavy lifting. Dustin and those other kids were the brains of the operation. 
---
Not the least bit scared of any of them. You might be able to change my mind about Jeff? Maybe? But the man has put in time in the mosh pits.

Tapp/Ash/Bill are non-negotiable

Regardless it‚Äôs all so funny and silly to analyze.

Grinding hundreds of hours for perks isnt hard, so not sure where this whole "if you want it the easy way" mentality comes from. It's literally just a time sink, that's it. Theres plenty of people with tons of free time that still suck at this game lol

From this angle the shirt says Redditor

I had a guy who's name was toxic with a bunch of numbers and one who had tunnel me somewhere in it.
---
So me playing Freddy who always has Franklins on no matter what saw the teabagging pink haired nea with OoO flashing a light in my face ready to go and I went after her got a smack and she realized she lost the light so instead of running she picked it up which gave me time to recover and smack her again.
---
She and her friend left immediately and sent me a paragraph about how Franklin's is toxic and then the other just said "just keep the fucking light"

They are streamers that have a direct contact with BHVR. They can pitch their ideas, complaints, issues with the game and such.
---
After a PTB, they probably get listened a bit more than the rest of the community.
---
Better, shambling beartraps
---
Take it with a grain of salt since BHVR is always free to change things between events, but if they stick to tradition, expect the following:
---
* Every bloodweb generated after the event starts should provide at least 1 event offering. I might be remembering wrong but I'm fairly certain the offering is almost always generated, and then other nodes have a chance of spawning more offerings and the spooky items
---
* These event nodes are typically set at 4k BP to purchase making them helpful for leveling up just a bit faster.
---
* The other event items that can spawn are a 'Spooky Lunchbox' which is a yellow medkit with a neon glowing skull on it and a Ghost flashlight which is a yellow flashlight that puts out an orange ghost pattern if you aim it at a wall.
---
* If you burn an offering as a survivor, then anytime one of the special generators is completed, you'll get a hefty amount of bonus  BP. Generally around 4,500 each.(not limited by the 8k category cap so no worries losing out)
---
* If you're a killer and you manage to hook a survivor onto a special hook, you'll get a bonus 5,500 BP. Typically this bonus is limited to once per hook, so you'll need to accept the fact that some hooks won't be able to be used due to their location and where the survivors run to.

Oink oinkus basoinkus oinky oink?

She takes knowledge of how survivors play in order to mind game. You have to rely on Stridor and god forbid MAYBE footprints (Because she can‚Äôt see auras or survivors will using her ability). The rest is prediction. Remember how easy she was to counter back when you could hear her coming from miles away? She was C tier. Now that she‚Äôs had her addon rework, base sound reduction for a year, and people have learned to play her she‚Äôs suddenly nurse tier? One addon doesn‚Äôt make a killer broken. If that were true, Myers would‚Äôve been nerfed to oblivion 2 years ago. 
---
If pallets and vaults are still choices against a killer (Especially if there are hard counter perks like Iron will, Urban Evasion, and Fixated) they‚Äôre not OP. The end.

I think it's easy to learn but also the community is really hard on new players. I'm new to the game, started near the beginning of the season last month and got to red rank survivor and purple killer. Could of gotten further on killer but I'm just trying to unlock perks right now and didn't have a lot of time to play by myself. That being said the constant messages while playing either side is hard man. Its hard to try to play your best when you know if you do some asshole on the other side will just say you tunneled or got carried by your team or something.
---
Killer mains in this sub tell you they don‚Äôt care about being tea bagged and it don‚Äôt bother them at all but not stop post about toxic survivors who tea bag.
---
You can hear both nurse and billy quite easily, Myers can fuckin appear right behind you and you don't know it
---
People want to prestige for bloody skins, people want more perks so their builds have more variety and versatility, or they're trying to level up the newest chapter's characters to get them on par with the rest of their lineup. Thered tons of reasons people are thirsty for BP, and sure it can be easy to get a solid viable build, people generally want choices with their builds and what they do. If you only have 10 perks, that ain't as easy to do.
---
I don‚Äôt get the hate for NOED. I don‚Äôt run it personally but it‚Äôs totally preventable if you cleanse totems and it counters the abundance of adrenalines that every survivor runs. Why is NOED frowned upon but adrenaline is A-Ok???
---
I find that other teammates will usually dc from the game if one does so initially. Then it‚Äôs just a domino effect until all survivors dc. At first it annoyed me, but it‚Äôs kind of understandable as nobody wants to waste 15 minutes in a hemorrhaging match.
---
Same, people who farm their teammates get special treatment
---
Killer: The Thing
---
Survivor: R.J. Macready
---
Based on the 1982 version of the movie.
---
Killer could mimic survivors for a short time, and/or the crows on the map.
---
Stake Out is actually way more useful than people give it credit for. Combine it with Empathy and We'll Make It and you can make it to Survivors by the time they go down, get a token or two, save, 8 second heal, and leave with two "Fuck Ruin Free" tickets. Even if I had all the perks in the game, I would take Empathy over DS. Being able to infer where the Killer is at almost all times, as well as keep an eye on other Survivors and being able to help them faster is a big plus in my book. DS just doesn't fit the builds I want to play. After it's used, if it's used, it's just a sitting dead perk slot. Plus, playing outside of meta is way more fun.
---
Information all game is much better than a one-time use get out of jail free card.
---
Im main Ghostface :D, they Can just use OoO to fully counter me.
---
I'm not saying this is you, but does a person really need triple digit IQ to understand that getting hit and dropping a pallet at the same time is bad, or that using 10 pallets in the first minute is bad, or that using all the pallets in the same area in one chase is bad?
---
Just be chill. Vault some stuff. Take some hits. You can get hooked twice and still get away.
---
Im more interested on that name tbh.
---
ofc it does, but you dont need all of them or even many, to have a Lot of Fun
---
But Bill has also shown that he's just as well off now as ever, while canonically he died, he also died after fighting his way through everything thrown at him.
---
Ash may be better now than ever, but Bill never lost his edge, regardless of his grandpa comments
---
Sniper and DK Billy are terrifying in the right hands. Also spirit with the no sound add on is scarier than Myres and GF combined
---
Because some people are too simple minded to counter mind games. Prayer beads are the only thing that remotely need to be changed.
---
It's a hard counter for spirit / her ability which also means prayer beads. It's also a hard counter for GF, wraith and soon Myers. Which contradicts the statement made by the person I was answering to...
---
edit: I forgot the pig.
---
She takes knowledge of how survivors play in order to mind game. You have to rely on Stridor and god forbid MAYBE footprints (Because she can‚Äôt see auras or survivors will using her ability). The rest is prediction. Remember how easy she was to counter back when you could hear her coming from miles away? She was C tier. Now that she‚Äôs had her addon rework and base sound reduction for a year and people have learned to play her she‚Äôs suddenly nurse tier? One addon doesn‚Äôt make a killer broken. If that were true, Myers would‚Äôve been nerfed to oblivion 2 years ago. If pallets and vaults are still choices against a killer (Especially if there are hard counter perks like Iron will, Urban Evasion, and Fixated) they‚Äôre not OP. The end.
---
Youd have to make it a parkour type course tbh
---
I personally dislike adrenaline as well, I think they're both perks that reward playing poorly by basically handing you a free win no matter how poorly you play. I can understand at low ranks because the players are still learning but beyond rank 15 it's pretty inexcusable to me.
---
I'm joking :/
---
Balanced landing, hands down. Even without the sprint, the stagger reduction is huge and you have it immediately at level 1 with that perk. The stagger reduction alone allows you to use loops you otherwise wouldnt be able to. The other ones are only useful if you arent exhausted, BL is useful even if you're exhausted.
---
Warp Speed Wraith. *Breaks pallet in .2 seconds*
---
Hide. Avoid Los. When you get in a Chase and he has EW3, commit to a lot of actions like vaults and pallet drops (you could also hide in a locker, but that's just mean).
---
In all honesty though, those two add one make it so Myers can't really do anything for a long time. If there isn't 1 or 0 gens remaining, you probably weren't going to win in normal play anyway.
---
Alrighty :)
---
Ah yes, recognise the signs of her phasing! For example:
---
1. 
---
2. 
---
3. 
---
That's the problem people have with her against nurse. With nurse, she's extremely strong, but straightforward. You see her charge her blink, you try to dodge where she blinks, and you do or you don't, but you know it's coming. With Spirit, she can stand still and you have to guess whether or not she's phasing or if she's MinDgAMinG. If you  live, it's not because you outplayed her, it's because you won the coin flip.
---
The original video is from u/tatooti but u/okbuddydaylight comment inspired me to make this
---
What are you on about? I've watched plenty of his content, and from everything I've seen he just plays the game normally. It's not a crime to be good at what you do.
---
My mate plays legion, he uses a much similar build to yours, he's a rank 1 killer and survivor, I'd replace nurses for something else like pop or thrilling tremors, or if you absolutely need to, then use ruin, but otherwise this build should be fine,
---
Played a game with a DS survivor running sprint burst and borrowed time. Baby killer who only had noed and brutal strength, obviously new. Everyone escaped and the guy had the nerve to be a sore winner and say the killer was using crutch perks. Can't even imagine how delusional he must be
---
You still get a dick apparently
---
Maybe lol
---
What was the messages in dead chat?
---
Was it toxic?
---
People do this to me when I play Myers almost every game and I really don't get it
---
Good to know the game is matching me with players my level!
---
&gt; I think you took it too personal.. I mean.. he also pointed out counters and how to play against
---
I get that he laid out some counters to her and all, but with his proposed nerfs to her base he comes off as talking out of both sides of his mouth. I just don't like when people don't take strong stance against bullshit (and wanting a killer's base nerfed after a year of her not being changed at all is utter bullshit).
---
He should be flat out calling out these low-skilled entailed survivor mains for their refusal to adapt, their refusal to increase their own skill, their rule breaking, their refusal to switch out their own meta perks, and their refusal to accept strong killers. But instead he wants to negotiate with with the equivalent of gaming terrorists for what? To keep a portion of his audience from flaming him/stop supporting him?
---
Don't people like him realize that nerfing the Spirit will do nothing but empower these people to go on a DC spurt to the next killer who outclasses them? The next target could be Myers even though he's been out for 2 years and nothing has really changed about him. It can be anybody's favorite killer next.
---
You never negotiate with such people. You never give an inch cause they'll take a mile.
---
Forget "understanding" them, forget "working" with them. No, fuck that. What should happen to them is that they start getting banned for rule breaking and that's all. If their "fun" in playing as survivor is not wanting to increase their own skill enough to defeat a viable killer, then their "fun" should thrown in the trash where it belongs.
---
Too many times have so called killer mains given in to the demands of low-skilled survivor mains and it's gotten us nowhere. When is someone just gonna call it like it is - that such people just want easier games because they themselves aren't good enough, are too lazy to get good enough, don't want to be good enough, and want to hold high skilled players and the game itself back from becoming all that it can be.
---
Low-skilled survivor mains - I don't play killer to be your friend. In this game my rue is simple  - if it moves, it dies. My killers shouldn't be nerfed to placate your feelings because your feelings about my killer matter to me about as much as an ant's to a lion. I play to win and only to win. My pleasure is in destroying each and every one of you in the game and I'm great at doing it.
---
Get. Better. And stop trying to hold the game back by calling for nerfs to killers that are in no way overpowered.
---
And streamers - stop acting like this isn't a major problem in this community. Stop acting like if you just give up a little power to killers that it's somehow going to make things better. Stop pussy-footing around what's going on here. Take a side, and make a stand.
---
These devs, when it comes to the notion that all killers should be viable, are tone deaf. If you stand with low-skilled survivor mains in asking for nerfs the devs will go overboard EACH AND EVERY TIME. It'll NEVER be something that effects the killer in just a small way. And those same low-skilled survivor mains who you pitched your wagon to - when that killer becomes significantly weaker are they going to tell the devs "woah, you went too far there, buff the killer back up"? NO they will laugh and taunt you about the nerfs, while the rest of us will have to deal with a weaker killer because you streamers decided to play white knight. Then all your "I should have seen it coming" "why did the devs do this" will be a day late and a dollar short since you streamers helped the fucking shit get to this point.
---
STOP asking for killer nerfs. Cause if you do you're part of the problem, not the solution.
---
Are you sure you wanted to respond to me? I didn't mention legion or doc in my message. Those are counterable and if anything could use buffs. The only doc I don't like is 3 gen hostage doc that doesnt interact with you besides shocking you to tier 3 and kicking gens with overcharge unnerving.
---
&gt; But if you're going to disconnect because something's "a little annoying" well then you'd better get ready to disconnect whenever you get chased through an area without pallets, get found when your exhaustion perk is down, find an item in a chest you don't like, or when anyone misses a skill check.
---
I didn't mention this kind of disconnection. I don't mind those situations and I'd never dc for them because they are my own fault. 
---
&gt;The thing I don't understand about DCing against high tiers though is that if they're really that "OP" and "uncounterable" chances are they'll just kill you super fast anyways?
---
Yeah, but do I wanna go through the unpleasantries of that process while all along knowing I don't have a fighting chance? No, not really.
---
&gt;May as well get a bit of Bloodpoints instead of just leaving and losing everything, especially now that Dedicated Servers make you lose your items if you DC.
---
I don't really care for points, I want to have a fun match.
---
Idk. People on this sub live in fantasy land and think perkless Wraith is OP I guess. Even Nurses we‚Äôre getting destroyed. Killers need their perks far more than survivors.
---
Honestly, if you can hit R1 Killer, you can try it out yourself.
---
Im just saying, it's Ash's destiny to fight demons and monsters. He was literally born to do it, so he's naturally gonna be a tip top fighter. Bill had to be trained to be a such badass.
---
Voss water ?
---
But you agreed with the original comment, which is shaming OP for making a harmless meme. Its not OP's fault that people feel the need to come and make fun of Tru3, and not only that, OP hasn't even made a comment with him being rude to Tru3.
---
To be honest, the original commentor is attacking the wrong person, so shame on him honestly.
---
I've been playing for a while but what do the entity claw things around someone name do?
---
Does it show bad connection or something?
---
One time I did this, and when I went into spectator mode, the two remaining survivors were in the basement quietly switching rotating between two lockers. I watched this for ten full minutes before disconnecting and it still keeps me awake at night years later
---
It's because he really isn't toxic. He specializes in looping, so people often call him toxic. He never really shows him bullying people or even getting angry besides that one time with a Claudette but I feel as most people would get angry if you spent i think it was 3 minutes? Looping a killer just to get downed and see your one teammate hiding in the corner of the map not doing a single gen. 
---
He says he's toxic because using flashlights, insta heals, noed, Moris, etc. Are often called toxic by the community especially looping and pallet stunning. As far as anyone knows, he isn't toxic and has even cut down on what little toxicity he showed in the past to be generally more of a goofball type youtuber/streamer.
---
The one thing people often use against him is that he was banned twice though the first time was due to the devs refusing to give him back legacy after his account was struck by that bug that deleted all progress in the game. Then i believe his second ban was due to him hacking in more items for his videos such as flashlights and stuff like that, though I could be wrong. The first one you can't really blame him on but I get why people would be upset by the second one, though since then he hasn't done anything besides mess with perk icons which most pc players do and has become more or less like monto where he does perk builds or tries to have a theme for the video.
---
You still get bonus Bp
---
I mean, anyone can have fun with the base game (heck, I have fun screwing around as all dwights or all claudettes with my friends sometimes), but that doesn't change the fact that plenty of new players want to get to their preferred playstyle quicker by farming because of the nature of leveling in the game. I think the archives and buff to survivor points will help this, though.
---
I was making a joke about the Change my mind bit of your comment but go off I guess
---
I agree, at rank 1 adrenaline is always used whilst NOED is seldom used.. not generalising all survivors but it shows how bullied killers generally are in a 4vs1 scenario. NOED is taboo whilst adrenaline is meta, like wtf?
---
Getting what specifically?
---
So they were basically holding the game hostage?
---
Highly doubt his model would cause any clipping issues. The sides of PH's helmet are not wide enough to cause problems as it is pretty standard sized. The vertical part of the helmet would also not be a problem. In Silent Hill 2, PH is a projection of the main character, James, which makes him roughly about 5'10. Apply that to PH, and he would have no problems with windows as the very tippity top of his helmet would be as tall or a little shorter than the Plague.
---
I still wonder what the whole Konami claim is based off of. They suck, but are they notorious for rejecting licensing deals in the past? They seem to have no problem whoring out their characters and even Pyramid Head for money. Gray area for me
---
How dare him for not making a tactical disconnect to give you hatch. The "DC into Hatch Tech" is something EVERY DBD player should know and use the second the second-to-last guy goes down. It is literally the PINNACLE of high level DBD play. /s
---
In all seriousness I wouldn't be pissed. Depends if the killer was camping around my body or looking for you.
---
This is even better than I imagined it was going to be based off your previous pic, well done!
---
Thank you so much!!
---
As a survivor, I can average maybe 15k bp a match. When I play doctor, with BBQ and distressing, its 50k at minimum. Survivors could definitely use a boost to bp gains
---
You're supposed to end the game before he can stalk that much.
---
You can adjust in the settings to make it the past hour
---
survivors get crows that fly around them and caw if they don‚Äôt do anything for extended periods of time. are you just perhaps blind and/or deaf?
---
Never skip leg day.
---
Dude, stop. You can get a reasonable build for both sides by just leveling one or two characters. You don‚Äôt need every perk to play the game, and having lots of perks gives players who play longer something to do. I won‚Äôt farm during the event, even if the others do.
---
dead hard is primarily for making it to a pallet or window to extend a chase, not for dodging hits. they cant really bait you dead harding forward to slam a pallet or vault an important window
---
That rarely happens, not a big problem
---
If it take a minute to be cleansed, that's a minute that you had at least 1 survivor actively looking for it and not working on a gen. It's still useful since it does slow gen progress, and paired with perks like overcharge on Doctor, I get plenty of use out of it. Depends on your play-style.
---
Tyde Tyme is pretty much always wrong
---
The first haunted ground meme that made me actually laugh. Thanks for that
---
Well if you wanna go for a lore argument. Survivors should get just as much as killers, cause the Entity wants them to be filled with hope. What inspires more hope than becoming stronger?
---
If they don‚Äôt do anything. If they walk around they don‚Äôt get crows
---
Well I've don't the opposite and made 2 sci fi fan killers, heh...
---
Oh wait I forgot nobody cares
---
Konami went scorched Earth with majority of game titles and morphed them into pachinko. And it's not how wide, but how long the helmet is. Pyramid head is james' monster anyways.
---
Well fusion 360 is what you use to model, or create an .stl file. After that you use a slicer. I upload to Slic3r (a lot of people like Cura) and under settings there is an option; Printer Settings &gt; extruder 1 &gt; Lift z:   \[ 0 \]mm. you can change it to say 1 mm, and that would be plenty. You shouldnt do this on big prints though because it will add a lot of time!
---
Gotta use them now before the nerf I guess
---
A really disgusting build that I've not seen often is ghost face
---
Add One: Outdoor Security Camera, Ghost face caught on tape
---
Perks: Furtive Chase, BBQ, Ruin, Thrilling Tremors
---
If you want to be extra toxic throw on a Mori. I have run this build before and you pretty much always know where the survivors are if you play it right and find your obsession.
---
Person who has them is the entity if they move obsession is in a chase
---
Ikr
---
With that definition almost every multi-player game is an esport. And you couldn't be more wrong about me...
---
Punishing DCs won't fix anything, they will just suicide on hooks. As silly those situations are, I'm afraid they are here to stay.
---
You can't force people to play out the match if they don't want to, it's just how things are.
---
In my region nobody lobby dodges anymore. The killer queues are like 7 mins, so you can't. Plus I think DCing is **way** worse.
---
At that point you just start backing out of the lobby if you see more than 2 people join at the same time, especially if they're carrying items. 
---
Chances are, it won't be pretty if you decide to play against them anyway.
---
Just give it time I know it sucks now but when they are  done I‚Äôm sure dedicated servers will be really nice to have
---
Cause he's actually good at the game, people call him a killer main because he's a great killer, but he's even a rank 1 survivor, not only that, but the matches that he plays, he teaches you how to use a loop as both killer AND survivor, what "Killer Main" teaches you how to properly use a jungle gym? And when he's a survivor, he even gives you tips on how to loop certain killers. It's because he's not bullying yellow and green rank killers and putting on YouTube "360ing a A bAbY KlLeR in DbD" people hate him.
---
Which fog whisperers do that? I've only really watched panda and puppers and they seem genuine enough to not do that - I kinda assumed BHVR would only pick players who are healthy for their game to be fog whisperers
---
Usually reserve farming for early dc games.
---
I'd rather perish otherwise.
---
*haunted grounds goes off, sound of surv disconnect follows* ftfy
---
I don't know what is spot on, literally no killer thinks this. It's annoying, frustrating and probably shouldn't be so quick but no one blames survivors for doing the gens. It's just a odd out of nowhere generalisation.
---
I think you still get crows if you just walk around doing nothing for long enough.
---
2nd frame repeated : We all disconnect
---
Subreddit meta:Is there a spam bot filter for new posters? I convinced my wife to create an account to share a link, but it's not showing up. Is that normal?  
---
Edit: Looks like the common solution is to message the mods. Makes sense to me!
---
Every time üòÇ I can taste the salt
---
The absolute trifecta this lad has. I'm surprised he wasn't running Adrenaline as well. Honestly, meta crutches like DS, NOED, etc., just make the game so boring. Once you get better as Killer, you don't need NOED as you'll usually have about 2 people dead or near dead by the time gens pop and it's completely useless if you kill everyone before gens pop. For Survivors, just learning how to take advantage of the scuffed power roles can basically win the game without DS, Adrenaline, SB, BT, etc.
---
You tried to prove there isn't a killer main bias, I'm showing you killer mains are over-represented, aka there is bias for killer mains. If you can't connect those things together then..... whew boy.
---
I feel like if I say anything negitive I'll get downvoted to hell.
---
It just makes a feeling of progressing up the ladder. Otherwise you would get at rank 1 and stuck there as usually you would severely derank only by intention.
---
Still makes little sense, but the whole rank system of DbD doesn't make a lot of it.
---
if it were me they'd all be to the left bc I'm weak as shit
---
There isnt any way to punish immersed survivors without punishing people just trying to hide. Run tracking perks etc but this isnt that common anymore now end game collapse exsists
---
So you're saying no one plays it. I see. Sounds OP.
---
Bruh moment
---
Yeah they must have been moving
---
remove bleedout ?
---
Pig doesnt need ruin cause her traps kinda work as a sorta ruin on their own. 
---
Id say either sloppy butcher to work with nurses or just standard BBQ
---
Faith (Buffy the vampire slayer) for new survivor, The First taking the shape of Buffy for new killer
---
Suck it up buttercup, I shall edit the post though as not to be misleading
---
just have them keep brown yellow and green ones
---
There isnt any way for the game to know that youve just queued.
---
Sloppy would work nice yeah.
---
Then every hillbilly and bubba would have insta saw
---
If you watch his streams, there's a lot of trolls who try to point out his "flaws" when he plays survivor, when he plays killer and he's chasing somebody, the other survivors tend to get at least 2 gens done within minutes WITH ruin up. When he plays survivor and he gets chased and tunneled for a couple minutes, nobody gets a gen done, or maybe one gen is done. Whenever someone gets hooked and the killer is facecamping/area camping, especially in end game WITH no ed, people try to say he's a bad survivor because he's not going for the save, especially without borrowed time. Tru3 literally does everything that he points out his team-mates should be doing, the trolls in the chat deserve the ban when they try to point something out that's not there.
---
I love the twitchies

Oh...I just read this and I LITERALLY just got a 4k with Mori's for the new spirit skin üò¢

yeah were pretty toxic haha...

aight vro

Looks weird and underage
---
FUCK ME RIGHT NOW I BEG YOU DAVID
---
I hated the Gideon Meat Plant initially, but now I do really well on it, so I don‚Äôt mind it. Hawkins Lab is currently my least favorite map.
---
Thank you! I appreciate it.
---
I mean  yeah, how am i supposed to know if someone else replied and could help out with data or other shit. I currently have a life, i just dont like leaving arguments unfinished. Are all your insults life getting related? Cause it applies to you too then
---
A lot of problems right there:
---
Sony doesn't like crossplay and so far has only allowed Rocket League and Street Fighter 5 to have crossplay. I think that was because both studios had their own servers. But Sony is very picky. 
---
Secondly, you have the problem with inconsistent frame rate with the consoles hovering anywhere between 30-60-ish FPS. And the Switch can barely do 15 FPS. Maybe with PS5 and the next Xbox? Big Maybe? 
---
Thirdly, using certain killers (namely the Nurse and Huntress) with a controller sucks. So the instant a console guy using Huntress/Nurse plays against PC guys is going to be a world of pain.
---
*Ochido would like to know your location.*

In the Official Journals The pig sees someone in a locker, walks up to it, hears another noise and lets him go. So put pig in a "Maybe" category
---
Super harsh. But the killer main inside me agrees with you
---
Jean-Claude Vass Dass.
---
Make like a hockey stick and get the puck out, cry baby.
---
Lots of people don‚Äôt seem to get that this list is based on Lore, not the people who play the killers. I probably should have stated that but I thought it would have been more obvious.
---
thank you for your "feedback".
---
A whole 6000? Dang, maybe I shouldn't DC on killers who shouldn't even be allowed to host the game with their internet now
---
Ok. Iv'e def faced you before lol.
---
As a killer secretly NOED-ing the flashlight tbagger while his friends run away was the most satisfying experience in the game. I don‚Äôt care if i lost, i was a noob on my cousin‚Äôs ps4 anyways.
---
(I pulled people off the hook and lockers so it never procced)
---
Forget that, Sam and Dean would eventually kill everything and then somehow fuck up and unleash the Superentity knowing them
---
Now I know you have no idea what you're talking about lol
---
Yw. I‚Äôd delete this post and find some hentai with adults to make it genuinely funny. Other than that I‚Äôve reported this pic
---
Yeah but it just happens too often after the first hit
---
Same can be said about this sub and shitposts.
---
The bubba hit me one time after 20 seconds, he also has ruin. That means we have a 0% chance of victory, gg all.
---
Nah it‚Äôs fine. Not to mention, they‚Äôre always busy and probably get tons of messages. I don‚Äôt want to add to the plate. 
---
While this may be an appreciation post, it also serves as a showcase for new players. I know DbD can be frustratingly annoying, but as with every other game, it takes time. I feel like many players just give up.
---
Updoot for you wise one
---
They bury them near the campfire like squirrels
---
I like to run thanatophobia, most suvivors don't waste time healing if the trap is ticking.
---
Ah, so these lists are based on lore. Thought it was just random
---
You're honestly a moron. Where did I say that it's bad for survivors to do gens? There's a difference between saying "stupid survivors rushing dem gens," and genrushing exists (which you denied). I thought you were a troll, but you're honestly just dumb. Go play killer for a little bit and get into the upper ranks, then say that genrushing is a figment of bad killers imagination who can't apply proper pressure. Who do I blame for genrushing? The devs, not survivors, I genrush all the time when it makes sense to as a survivor, and I'm sure you've had matches under five minutes where people go down quickly and the gens are still done fast.
---
I really don't like how they neutered RBTs at the exit gates. They're not even reliable killers anymore, since no one will activate a generator if you're playing against a SWF lobby and you put a trap on one of them.
---
If there's too much of a wait after the trap-setting, the trap should activate.
---
I mean, farming is popular enough that there's people upset by its frequency, and enough new players find it viable. I'm not farming either, I just remember being a new player and appreciating being able to make some advance progress.
---
Nice try at hiding the mematic watermark.
---
The issue with Spirit and mind games is only the Spirit is capable of mind games, the survivor is running deafblind.
---
Rofl, gotta love it
---
The person who has them is not the entity
---
I‚Äôm new to the game and I had a face camping rank 20 step on his trap trying to hook me 3 times in a rowüòÇ
---
Just upvote it you don't have to say anything. No one cares that you upvoted, your just using that as an excuse to farm more karma, secondly stop calling it updoots its cringy and unfunny
---
Lol, because if you're winning you DESERVE to activate it. You don't deserve to get a 4k after standing on your ass all game doing nothing as killer, but you should get rewarded for running the killer and doing all the gens. Who tf thinks someone should be rewarded for doing bad?
---
  And also, if all 4 survivors are still alive by the time all 5 Gens pop, then you're just bad. Simple as that. Has nothing to do with balance.
---
Well it‚Äôs more or less expected to see a survivor with their learned traits.
---
Ya you to :)
---
If a group of people are trying to farm, and someone else doesn't want to, it's not like you're going to play a normal game anyway. If they stop farming, you're likely hooks behind, or if you're killer, it won't be a challenge. Forcing people to or getting mad when people don't is obviously silly, but it's worth being considerate to players in lower ranks that have a full stack of streamers and try to, because trying to play a normal game just frustrates everyone.
---
That is a completely wrong statement. Legion is not an m1 killer
---
Did you seriously screenshot your edit?
---
If I had to guess it‚Äôs Jendenise but I‚Äôve not watched her in some time so i could be wrong.
---
I don't mean the height, I am referring to how far the helmet sticks out forwards. It would cause clipping. And lorewise as I said it would make far more sense to take Harry since canonically he died, and the missionary since that's what killed him. We do not know the fate of James.
---
Good advice, thanks.
---
3.2k btw
---
I'd say it would depend on the killer and rank, perks definitely make a difference and killer definitely isn't easy in general.
---
i really wanna see micheal and ghostface race
---
Encouraging bamboozle and noed, says there's a lot of bad advice, ok
---
We need more killers like the doctor, who get benefits from the base mechanic of the game (big terror radius on doc) to make interesting builds, not the opposite, making most perks not work on said killer (plague with healing, this with stun resistance, legion with many, many things)
---
Yeet. Makes sense. I thought it was a bug honestly lol. Good to know
---
Okay, now make the same post in any other PVP multiplayer game
---
Go to Siege, league of legends, Apex, fighting game, sport games, card games.. anything pvp and online and try to make the same argument
---
Then come back and tell me if you became deaf for how loudly they laughed at you
---
5 what?
---
Bruce Campbell himself said recently that he‚Äôs up for recording more voice lines for the game- sooner or later, we‚Äôre gonna get some more I think.
---
Just a bug, don‚Äôt worry too much about it
---
Damn well played
---
Unlikely because thats a mod. 
---
Bill never had an alternative outfit in Left 4 dead or left 4 dead 2 (Not including the Beta but valve would never consider that)
---
So it's very unlikely bill will ever get a new skin unfortantly.
---
I can‚Äôt. Help me, o mighty Branflakes. I‚Äôm lost. The truth shall set me free.
---
You can just hit the survivor body blocking, You should be able to phase through her/him at that point. If there are multiple survivors it's even better since there are less people on a gen + free hits
---
Wow man, you come across as such a dick.
---
Body blocking is fine and always has been. Especially against a killer who tunnels 100% 
---
What I think they need to fix is some killers because they are too weak. 
---
And some perks because they are too weak. 
---
So buffs and reworks.
---
I think we‚Äôve all been there as killers at one point üòÇ
---
I don‚Äôt care, they‚Äôre dying now
---
Nothing more fun than rushing gens and stealthing to deny a farming killer their fourth stack.
---
Legion is the fastest STBFL stacker out there, as you can get 3 stacks form a single down and up to 5 stacks from a single use of the power + chase (when doublehitting with the power)
---
You can get all the stacks easily and then decide (basing on the killer instinct from earlier chases) if you want to use a regular m1 or their power.
---
Don‚Äôt call my statement, that is promoted by like every single red rank killer main that has ever tied it, wrong just because it doesn‚Äôt feel right to you
---
The girl I hooked told me that I was going to get banned and tried to play off that she messed up her Dead Hard, one of the dead teammates said I was going to get banned and that I‚Äôm a camping kid for some reason, and the Laurie that escaped only said ggez.
---
Yes you‚Äôre probably right. So then they bust out the ebony Mori and slaughter the survivors in the next game. This pisses off the survivors, so they bring in insta-heals and keys, which then pisses off the killer.... it‚Äôs a vicious cycle!
---
Theyve only just stopped swf having to requeue with each other, reforming lobbies is something else entirely
---
I mean I know you can hit them, but at the same time if you're about to get a kill  it's just kind of bullshit because your wiggle timer is still going and you're now in the recovery from the attack and the only way you can avoid this is with that legion perk.
---
*\*Its ok guys, he has BBQ that means he is not a baby\**
---
That‚Äôs what he wore in Payday
---
I know that already. I guess not having much to say, even you realize that I'm right then
---
(Nice edit. You called me dick, nice try covering that. Still, doesn't change much)
---
I literally just read it a few minutes ago because of another post and it didn't mention that. Just something about him starting to hear Whispers.
---
Darn you... that‚Äôs nice.
---
hope so
---
More than likely. Basically the only game I play.
---
Why? What did they do to deserve it more?
---
If you hit right after teleporting, you‚Äôll have next to no lunge distance, as she‚Äôs slowed for a while
---
Wait a sec with your hit unless they really are on top of you
---
Bamboozle shuts down terrible loops: FACT.
---
Bamboozle can end a chase sooner: FACT.
---
NOED is an insurance perk (as I plainly stated): FACT
---
I don't know what it is but the shitlords have clung to this idea that Bamboozle is bad and you should never use Bamboozle. And the reasoning is clear; the shitlords play survivor and hate Bamboozle because it takes away the mindless loop spots they love to abuse OR a shithead streamer stated that they hate the perk and the shitlords parrot that opinion.
---
Unless you decided to go across the map for the hook, you‚Äôve got more than enough time to slap a couple survivors and still get your hook
---
He also said he's back doing the voice for a new Evil Dead game currently in the works. Which I think is pretty nifty.
---
Yeah, they should remove all the cancer op stuff IMO.
---
They are shown to grow and shrink. You can see it in the show
---
I‚Äôll try our spirit fury, enduring, noed and dying light then. Sounds kinda fun. I‚Äôll replace noed with bamboozle whenever I get it
---
The head-honcho of the Legion gang.
---
Yeah, I heard about that- apparently he‚Äôs already recorded them all, and some of his voice lines include him berating the player for repeatedly pressing buttons that don‚Äôt do anything.

---
I find following the killer attached to the hip the whole game with that the equivalent of camping and tunnelling. One time they did it to me with the torch and I didn't fall for the obvious 'chase me' clicks and teabags and they escaped but failed to get gens done themselves or save any teammates or get any pallet stuns ect. then got mad and put 'LOL EZ'.. like um ok .-.
---
We need a new flare:

"Salt-Posting"
---
Not after tomorrow thankfully, I don't main him but I do play him a lot so I'm looking forward to that.
---
A whole 6000 I didn‚Äôt have before. Yeah keep DCing, see how far that actually gets you when they start to punish it. Maybe you should pay attention to ping before you start a match instead of complaining. Some people can‚Äôt get better WiFi in their area, I‚Äôm not going to tell people they can‚Äôt play the game because of it.
---
Ya'll just gave me a yeast infection.
---
Or you've downed someone and there isn't a nearby hook  because they've either destroyed the hook, or a kill has been made.
---
Survivors do have plenty of ways to interfere with the killer, sabotage the hooks or bring tools to fix gens faster, they've even got weird exploits they  can use that prevent them from being able to be picked up. I don't think getting rid of body blocking would ruin anything.
---
Do Myers next please!
---
I mean, you didn't even try and argue how I'm wrong. You just said post in another sub and get laughed out. 
---
Coming across as a know-it-all dick and proud doesn't make you right, it just decreases the likelihood of a constructive conversation.
---
Moris aren't for pipping; they were already nerfed after the emblems came out (unless they play normally and two hook before the mori, possibly hooking one more for the Devout emblem).  They're primarily an outlet for frustration and rage.  Or to get the strimmer.  Because fuck streamers.
---
"Remember that Quentin you passed by my dropped toolbox? On his way to the others to open the exit gates. But now he's probably already there and about to summon the end game collapse. If I had to guess your biggest mistake would be not stopping him! That or not picking spirit"
---
I think brutal killer so they don't focus on sacrificing 2 survivors via tunneling. I would happily accept this if it was implemented.
---
I main Bubba and I forgot that Franklin‚Äôs was a thing, switched out NoEd for Franklins and I‚Äôve been having more fun since. Even if I don‚Äôt win the game, they still lose their precious item that‚Äôs always with purple or red add on‚Äôs
---
would prefer the original
---
Killer queen has already touched whatever you used to hide the mematic watermark
---
Deadlight by dying daylight, luck is „Å∏„Çì„Åü„ÅÑ
---
You know it‚Äòs not gone after the 60 second timer, you can proc it again on your next unhook. 
---
And as I said, if you fail that skillcheck that‚Äòs on you. It‚Äòs something to learn about the game. Or should we give huntress a free aimbot cause she might miss??
---
Franklin's demise. When a killer hits you, you drop your item.
---
What happened to the Trapper's Ornate mask I had? I'm not sure how I got it whenever I first bought the game, but I guess it was a free cosmetic item. But when I tried equipping it today for some Trapper practice, I didn't have it. Where'd it go?
---
‚ÄúFranklin's Demise‚Äù
---
It makes survivors drop their items when they‚Äôre hit
---
Franklins demise, a killer perk that makes the survivor drop his item when he gets hit
---
If a kill has been made, that‚Äôs one less survivor able to body block, making it even easier to get past, if the hooks were sabo‚Äôd, slug and move on until you catch a survivor out in an area with hooks. There‚Äôs plenty of counterplay, so there‚Äôs no reason for a change
---
a perk that causes survivors to drop the item they are holding
---
If I have to use an entire perk slot just for one killer there's a problem. I constantly find myself using spine chill and iron will just for her. That's 50% of my perks just for one killer. It's crazy how some people still claim she can be maindgamed when its clearly a coin flip as someone mentioned above.
---
Survivors who block hooks nearly always give the killer an advantage, very rare it leads to a wiggle and even if it does everyones injured
---
That's fine then go for it it's freedom of speech man. I'm just tired of every comment on reddit not being original so I was hoping you would understand that, I'm going to be downvoted for this because people don't understand how the downvote system is meant to work but atleast I can hopefully have a civil discussion here
---
Yea its pretty crazy what you can do! One thing i started doing after a few months of trial and error was starting ALL of my files with 0.28 first layer height, 200% extrusion width. Saves a lot of time. Instead of keeping consistency with the rest of the layers and adjusting between every .gcode file with 0.12, 0.16, 0.28mm etc. layer heights.  
---
Also, use 0.04mm increments because thats what stepper motors use. Well i know at least my ender 3 does lol
---
Only at about 1,5k hr though. Across 3 years.
---
How so? As long as Pyramid head doesn't hunch over, the helmet bends at a downward angle which doesn't make it stick out, but rather flattens the shape a little. The reason it looks far in some pics is because PH is hunched over in them. It's certainly not enough to cause major clipping. I feel like you're reaching a little far there. 
---
Harry making more sense is just your opinion which I disagree with. James' status doesn't matter when it comes to DBD lore and what the Entity can do.
---
That comment "when double hitting with the power" just shows your delusion right away. If you're double hitting people with the power you're already playing Legion wrong. Just because Legion can stack STBFL the fastest doesn't mean it's best for him. The power if for getting chain hits and slowing the game down as fast as possible to apply massive pressure with mending. So why exactly would you m1 on someone with full hp when you can m2, apply a mend and completely cancel out the STBFL animation? It's completely irrelevant to Legions kit. 
---
Don't know who've you been watching but they're not giving out any good builds at all. The best perks for him are sloppy and thanata.
---
Didn't realize she's slowed after teleporting, good to know thanks.
---
I play Pig and I ALWAYS let the last survivor go. It's my tradition. 
---
The first game I played I managed to survive to the end with a Ghost Face and they carried me to the gate. So I've always had a soft spot for the last survivor.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 you could join the DBD community, theres always SWF teams there.
---
I'm saying the only streamer I watch is Otzdarva. Try it yourself; streamers aren't the gods of DbD.
---
If you‚Äôre the last alive and you boop my snoot, there‚Äôs a 100% chance I let you go
---
This goes the other way around too
---
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
---
Learn to loop.  Basic looping can pretty much make you loop killers for 5 gens at rank 15.  Exhaustion perk (dead hard or balanced landing) DS, Prove Thyself, and perk of choice.  I‚Äôd recommend unbreakable.  Rush those gens and rank up.
---
If for 10min they haven't touched a gen, it can be officially be reported for holding the game hostage
---
I agree with you, from what I‚Äôve seen!
---
Wtf why do you have 13 downvotes lmao. Reddit is such a joke sometimes
---
Who‚Äôs joe?
---
Deliverance, D-strike and sprint burst is a nasty combo try it out if ur camped. And save sprint burst till after your D-strike.
---
That's a valid reason...
---
Surprisingly no lol. Maybe he learned his lesson?
---
They always asked Michael we he kills, but never how he feels.
---
Learn how to loop. If you can you can end up looping a killer for the whole game. 
---
Take adrenaline to ensure you live just in case. 
---
Any other exhaustion perks up to you besides Sprint Burst. 
---
Also yes Decisive can very much help you if you are getting tunneled.
---
I mean you don‚Äôt have to farm blood points. Play normally as a killer with BBQ, offerings and using shards to buy teachable perks from the Shrine for some extra blood points is easily the best way to grind points.
---
Use whispers :)

Oh yeah, and I‚Äôm pretty petty about that sort of stuff lol.

Nah I‚Äôll just keep dc-ing lol. I never have to learn if I just never play against her 4head

So that killer should be punished for getting good. Nice.

It looks awesome! Keep it up!üëç
---
Good on you! I'm not there yet, when I play her I so far only pick up on grunts and sometimes breathing.
---
Legion buff: Survivors- will be able to mend while walking. Survivors mend timer is paused while in terror radius. Survivors outside terror radius needing to mend will have a fairly short time to so. 
---
Legion- after hitting a second survivor in feral frenzy the legion will be able to pursue the first survivor with no red-tracking-mark. Any attack against the first survivor during feral frenzy will be taken as one health state.
---
It was just a dumb joke that I made that went with the stereotype that Claudettes and Neas spam flashlights and tbag.

They can also spam the emote buttons as that resets the timer for crows,

If you learn to mind-game and end chases quickly, you won‚Äôt need ruin, unless you‚Äôre facing a really experienced and effective group

If it's safe get a save, if not secure your points

Reminds me of the time I was playing Plague and started puking on this Steve. He stood there for a couple seconds and then DCed lol,lovely game

Is this a consistent thing or just one match, cos if it's one match it might just be that the match rank is based on the tank you were at at the start of the match
---
Am husband.

Can confirm. 
---
Is delicious.

Honk honk
---
Hearthstone. 
---
Tell me why it'd be an issue to balance with all ranks in mind? Even with Ruin up at low ranks, survivors get pubstomped. Now, imagine that the repair process took even longer. 
---
What would you do to slow down the game?
---
Correct. So Spine Chill is actually getting a small buff.
---
Thats understandable, ive noticed that in alot of people. The footsteps aren't exactly loud but by hearing them it becomes even harder for people to escape you and is one thing that somewhat adds a higher skillcap to spirit
---
I just started using spine chill recently and it's definitely staying in my build from now on. It gives such good information and early warning of when a Killer is heading in your direction. I also like Claudette empathy perk that shows Survivor auras after they've been hit once. It tells you when they're being chased and where on the map they are so you know if you can safely stay on a generator or not.
---
There is no free win, your right. But there absolutely is counterplay. Keep in mind she is a 110% killer so she struggle to catch you outside of her invisibility, slow vault a window and make a break for it or double back and avoid her since she moves grass too, and you can use some stealth perks to make it harder for her
---
Watch the stream
---
You killed my hope for no shirt Myer
---
Danke
---
If you have NO fun playing dbd then take a break.
---
Fair. Meme builds tend to be more fun. 
---
(Spoken by someone who runs purely totem defender builds on killer lol)
---
Depends! If you play him right, he can be top tier.
---
The trick is to not waste your time stalking. Just use Night Shroud. You can sneak up on so many unsuspecting survivors! You‚Äôll be getting at least one Gen yank per game. Hit and run and keep them guessing. Just make sure you run a perk that protects your gens, like Thanataphobia or Corrupt Intervention.
---
As a bonus, if someone is looking at you, the game notifies you who it is and what direction they are looking at you from. So it‚Äôs a free chase/hit.
---
And if you do manage to expose a survivor, that‚Äôs the cherry on top! üëç
---
How?
---
bro what the fuck are you doing in your games where 10k is an actual goal you have to reach
---
I had a guy DC today because of make your choice
---
Man some people get real pissy
---
Happens to me as well, but I'm on PC, it seems to be a bug
---
Franklin's Demise is a perk that makes the survivor drop their item when the killer hits them.
---
Hot
---
Spoken like a true hero. Personally ran a dead hard gen rush build but purely ran the killer around.
---
People who saw are probably dead
---
Awesome, thanks for the tips. Survivor efficiency is definitely a #1 priority for me.
---
Look at your gameplay, if you're chasing a survivor and you pass by a gen that's clearly being worked on do you keep chasing the survivor or disrupt the gen? 
---
You downed a survivor what's the first thing you do, pick him up or disrupt a nearby gen?
---
Start playing more aggressively meaning tunnel a guy if you have to
---
And yet memes are never made about the multitude of games where there is no DC.
---
I keep an actual list of toxic killers and survivors along with what they did. Then during a killer match I go after them alone. I normally don't tunnel and never camp, (if I'm heading back to the hook and all I find is the person I just hooked I'll down them but I try to find someone else to hook). When the match is over and they're dead for certain I sometimes get a WTF message. I just reply with their offense.
---
With survivors if I see one among my team I don't offer much help and, if I know which gen they're on I'll run the killer right past it, often.
---
Over halfway through the list so far. Good times. Thankfully I don't run into too many truly toxic players these days, aside from when my killer rank resets and I get survivor's trying to show off. Tea bagging too much pretty much means there's a sign on them saying "kill me" imho
---
Glad I‚Äôm not going crazy, see a daily, do it and find out I no longer have it.
---
I swear to god we played the same "toxic" person. I'm not a great killer yet and he kept taunting me so I kinda left him alone and beat up the others when I could and just called him a dick after lol. Didn't get any sacrifices that game but still had okay points for a new killer.
---
*boop!*
---
Great work, love it. Whoever took the pictures did a great job, too, better than my work by a long shot.
---
Honestly, the rosy cheeks sell me.
---
You're a nice guy.
---
Map pressure.  Knowing when to give up on a chase.  Which gens to let go.  Slugging when there is more than one person in an area.
---
Pop goes the weasel and corrupt intervention are strong slow down.
---
pretty good job so far with these loops dude, however i see that youre flashblinding and proceeding to run the loops like normal, against a killer that has learned to use sound to track while blinded, this can only hinder you as youve wasted time getting a blind instead of getting some distance, id reccomend experimenting and finding out ways to use blinds to their full potential, but other than that it was pretty solid
---
Naw dude Bubba ain't so bad, look at Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
---
It was 20 minutes not 3. 3 or even 5 would be standard for him
---
Just a bit salty they keep getting nerfed \*insert thumbs-up\*
---
People can‚Äôt hear the sound if they‚Äôre in the husk‚Äôs terror radius. Whether she can be fooled very easily depends on the player, Tru3 lost almost every chase against the 2 Iron Will users and just wasted too much time trying to catch them. Using Bloodhound is just pointless when you can get everywhere quickly because it‚Äôs hard for people to hide from you. Also, SB kind of does what Bloodhound does but better because it also discourages healing. Predator doesn‚Äôt do anything against Iron Will because they just walk everywhere. Infectious needs SB for it to be good on Spirit, otherwise people will always be healed and it would take too long to down them every time you find them with Infectious. BBQ and NC, as well as any other intel perk would have been better than Overcharge. You should never use a perk that requires survivors to be winning if you‚Äôre using the second best killer in the game. The only perks in the game that help Spirit track in chases are I‚Äôm All Ears and Stridor, but there‚Äôs no point in using perks to help you win chases since you already get all of the information you need to end every chase quickly. The game could have gone differently if he had Stridor but it was on arguably Spirit‚Äôs worst map, he was playing terribly, and he was up against a really good team. He probably still wouldn‚Äôt have beat them if he had Stridor.
---
After being pushed out windows, shot stabbed incinerated t bagged 
---
Poor Micheal is getting on in years let him get the 4k
---
You‚Äôre either not understanding or taking it differently than what I said, it‚Äôs not a solid perk, the conditions you‚Äôre given are insane to hit and it‚Äôs not guaranteed. You‚Äôre not guaranteed to be unhooked twice. I don‚Äôt wanna repeat myself but again just agree to disagree lol
---
sorry but what is a gateau???
---
Thank god that one bug got fixed or else it would be stretching all over the map
---
Why not? It's a solid juking perk and can buy you a few extra seconds or a decent amount of the time to get to a pallet if you don't actually lose the killer. Not a great perk for beginners, but especially with Lithe and DWM or with Head On it can be useful and fun.
---
Can't be in two places at once.
---
Aww thank you q.q

my dude, why would you even play the game if you feel you cant have fun in it?

Has anyone else seen a ridiculous spike in hex ruin use? The last couple weeks I‚Äôve gone against it for I‚Äôd say 80% of all my games. Kind of frustrating and has been ‚Äúruin‚Äùing (haha couldn‚Äôt help it) the fun for me :(
---
Corrupt Intervention is an amazing alternative to Ruin. While Ruin can either be useless or very effective depending on RNG, Corrupt Intervention has a consistent effectiveness. If you have it, run it.

[An offering](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Gruesome_Gateau) they put in game during their 3 year anniversary event. It‚Äôs no longer available in bloodwebs but if you have some from that time you can still use it.
---
Ghostface came around that time also so people were able to stack up on them.
---
Well, didn't the clown just take that from a Jack-O-Lantern so isn't it just technically a regular Jack-O-Lantern? Not tryin' to be rude and all but I do think this looks good tho.
---
Yes but it is the killer's decision to slug. It is silly they got mad at you for not killing yourself, especially considering you tried to save once. IMO slugging is a viable stat and no one should be getting mad at anyone, but you were in the mood to flame, I have no idea why you would flame the survivor who had no power in this situation, over the killer who made the decision to slug.

In general, you'll get better at looping, mind games, and knowing how to play. Meta build, which is the strongest atm, tends to be some combo of adrenaline, exhaustion perk of choosing (sprint burst, dead hard, balanced landing, etc.,) iron will or self care. But I don't think you really need meta. Pick what works best for you and chose your own set that you like. 
---
For what you explained, I'd suggest adrenaline, decisive strike, empathy/bond (good info to know where people are being chased,) and then either self care for safety if you can't trust teammates, or another perk of your choosing. 
---
I'd say bring a key, but that's a stop gap really. It'll help you survive when you have it, but you'll run out of keys eventually. 
---
Also, feel free to check out /r/dbdLFG if you want to find people to play with. It's not that active, but I've found people before!
---
Susie mains are degenerates
---
I use alex on gens when shits hitting the fan
---
Oh no not furtive chase
---
Okay 1. why are they in Super Smash Bro's poses, 2. why does Plague have fingerless gloves
---
God yes. I'd fuck kate vigorously every fucking day. Also, mag is a pretty good warframe idk what you're smoking
---
That screws over your teammates who also don't cleanse.
---
quick, call an ambulance!
---
Guess we know who's playing doctor in the Netflix adaptation
---
I like when people through down a Pallet and start teabagging me while I‚Äôm Michael Myers. I just stalk the shit out of them and the stand there kinda confused why I‚Äôm just standing there staring at them.
---
It reduces your terror radius, Security camera let's you see people outside your terror radius when you down someone. It's the add-on that makes it good
---
Isn‚Äôt that the point of it? If you agree with something, you upvote and disagree you downvote? If I‚Äôm wrong I‚Äôll absolutely take it back.
---
I‚Äôm gay
---
You down and pick him up only to see a dick flooping around your screen on the way to the hook (like the charms).
---
Now if only i can find a plush demogorgon costume for my corgi in time for halloween
---
You can report them for it. As for what you're supposed to do, you can either DC and get on with a new game or, if you're stubborn/spiteful like me,  just pull out your phone and go on YouTube or pull out the Switch or whatever. If they want to sit in the game doing whatever, have at it. Plus, hey, they might see you standing there AFK and assume you're not around and walk up to you to teabag at which point smack 'em lol.
---
Freddy was always my enemy as a baby. For some reason, the buildup to you falling asleep (old Freddy btw) made me freak tf out and screw up really bad every damn time.
---
I‚Äôm a Myers main but I let people go have I been to nice?!
---
to me running against a killer with good add ons or perks basically just makes you want to uninstall but.. there are plenty of good survivor perks as well. if you just want to survive i suggest trying an exhaustion perk  (i prefer lithe/adrenaline) or something like deliverance. if you want to be stealthy try bond, spine chill, urban evasion or something of that nature.
---
eventually you‚Äôll learn to counter every killer, but it comes down to your play style. either go with stealthy (if they can‚Äôt find you, they can‚Äôt kill you) or aggressive (if they can‚Äôt catch you, they can‚Äôt kill you).
---
I mean whispers is definitely strong as shit, It isn't that it tells the killer that you're close (Which is VERY strong for gen patrolling and finding the last 2 players), It's also doubles as a way to prevent unhooks as it will trigger if anyone is near the hooked person, Thus allowing the killer to head back with the knowledge that a survivor is actually trying to pull an unhook. I would recommend a nerf tbh "Whispers triggers on Every survivor, Dying/hooked or not" this would give some counter play to it. 
---
(Personally i run it with doc and simply stay in punishment mode until it procs, Then i check the usual spots before going into treatment to find them, This way i can get a reliable proc on stage one while being able to capitalize on it)
---
I only just burned through the last of it last week. Had almost 60 on him
---
welcome to dbd.
---
Always a t.tv too
---
They don't call him king for nothing.
---
The lore everyone wants to know
---
I guess the only logical awnser would be that it would create too much noise.
---
I love deliverance when I‚Äôm playing solo. There‚Äôs been too many times where survivors didn‚Äôt rescue me on my first hook or didn‚Äôt rescue me until I was in second state!
---
Bro I'm sorry bro
---
I didn‚Äôt leave immediately because my friends were telling me to grab the purple flashlight i gave to my friend, wasn‚Äôt trying to be toxic
---
I mained Doc when I first climbed to red ranks. He isn't a top tier killer, but I think he's pretty solid. As a first note, you should get Ruin as quickly as you can. It's meta for everyone to run it at higher ranks except Nurse and maybe Spirit. Doc is weak on larger maps, even more-so than other killers. Then again Billy is weak on indoor maps. I'm just saying, don't sweat it if you have a bad game on Thompson, we all do.  
---
As for perks, if you don't have access to many teachable perks that's alright, there are a few neutral perks that are very good on Doc. Distressing increases your terror radius, which helps a lot if you are going for a Calm + Order (add-ons) build. Sloppy Butcher applies mangled to slow down their heal speed. This will help you juggle survivors. Since you have BBQ you should have access to Franklin's. I can't tell you how much time survivors waste going back to look for items they've dropped. If two or more people have items, it's often worth taking, especially if you don't have something like ruin/corrupt intervention to take in it's place yet.  
---
Strategy on Doc is much like other M1 killers. You don't have mobility, so you are screwed if the last three gens are spread out across the map. Use the info you get from the screams to keep track of their locations, and make sure they can't split the map on you. Once you do get someone hooked patrol the 3 nearest gens. Your huge terror radius will let you know if someone is going for the save. If you can chase the first guy that tries to go for the save, then a second guy will usually have to run from much farther away and waste a lot of time.
---
Add-ons: I like calm and order add-ons. Your terror radius is huge and inflicts madness quickly, which is good for find survivors and interrupting gen progress. This also gives you the illusory pallets and fake terror radius to work with. Another solid add-on is the moldy electrode. It has the best balance of range and charge speed for anti-looping. Note that shocking a survivor stops them from interacting with things like windows and pallets for 2.5 seconds.
---
Sure you can, if you aren‚Äôt a brain dead bot like the person you downed
---
Witnessed a Wraith bullying some baby survivors last night. I tried my best, I really did but lord they were just so new and so naive. Damn you Wraith! Damn you!!
---
I had a game with a guy who was obviously very new to the game, he ran me around his hooked teammate for a good couple minutes until someone went in for the save. I downed the newbie and put him on the hook and left so he could get rescued cause I felt bad for him but his teammies left him on hook until the last possible second, I assume to teach him a lesson lol
---
the things i have seen some people say about him on this sub baffles me
---
Because there's no need to? The fuck do you want people to make? "When no-one dcs in a match"?
---
dev should make borrow time version of slugging perks. like you heal teamates who in dying state and got endurance with terror radius. slugging style is worse than moris or camp
---
Playing Nea will **Considerably** increase your chance of being tunneled for the length of the trial.
---
Yup lol
---
I think it makes sense that the killer wins lower ranked games. They're supposed to be strong when it's a 1v4, with the survivors either being able to work as a team to overcome him, or know how to run solo to beat him.
---
As for the dailies, I feel that. Especially mori ones. I still get 'kill a person by your hand as blah blah blah' on a killer that I haven't leveled, and therefore don't even have the option to mori on.
---
The pip system has actually gotten quite a bit harder than it used to be. Perhaps it's still easy for the first ten ranks, but it's tougher to reach rank 1. Perhaps they need to spread power throughout the system so that more people are spread across the ranks, but I'm not certain how they'd go about that. 
---
It'd be difficult to do bot killers because so many of the killers rely on mind games and clever moonwalking to work correctly. I have always wanted AI survivors though, just to test new killer abilities, but as an interim, there's always KYF game mode.
---
I think youre right. I remember when you hit a survivor going up your camera followed to and that seems to be gone as well. Not sure why they would change it as it actually greatly effects complex hook rescues
---
r/cursedcomments
---
You just have to be able to look at it objectively after the match.
---
There really is nothing that is toxic, unless its personal attacks and lack of manners, which is usually a post chat thing.
---
Do whatever in the match you like, but be nice in the chat.
---
Ruin adds on average 45 seconds to every generator while active. Who wouldn't use it if it's so powerful? I personally don't, but still.
---
Only time I DC on first down is when the killer's ping spiked cus at that point I know the rest of the game is going to be bullshit hits. But since we're on DS now I dont do that and hate when other teammates do it.
---
I reached rank 11 and now see why everyone is complaining about matches around rank 10 lmfao
---
Wow! Thanks everybody lol so is this a hard perk to obtain? üòä
---
I changed it to that. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
Just crop it out please
---
That‚Äôs fair
---
Well yeah, rude people in the post game chat are degenerates
---
Agreed
---
Eh, DS is very situational as is. I don't think it needs a change at the moment, even if it isn't a perfect anti-tunneling tool.
---
Me neither
---
Dead Hard
---
It's happened multiple times.
---
Really?  I guess I never noticed.
---
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. I play both, although I do personally like DBD more.  Both are really fun to play. üòã
---
This list is wrong. I don‚Äôt see Dwight in SS tier
---
Nah we have to accept that he is never going back to the uncounterable in chase tunnel machine he was with his frenzy down spams.  That's dead and buried.
---
If we want to propose buffs for him obviously rework his addons because so many of them are useless.  Also base kit wise I'd be fine if he had faster frenzy movement speed since his ability is non lethal now and just used for first hits.  It could make those even more reliable to secure and possibly give his ability some viability as a map pressure mechanic to get from gen to gen a little faster.  Nothing insane mind you but enough to be noticeable.
---
Judging by the pictures he already has, I'm assuming he wants actual crappy looking costumes, not just something that looks remotely like them
---
And a bunch of extra stuff and he lied about it to get his fans to harass BHVR.
---
I'll be your dad
---
What‚Äôs happening Tuesday?
---
David is one hell of a fighter huh
---
Had this happen to me, pretty obnoxious and definitely uncool
---
Two words: Devour Hope
---
It requires you to hook and AND not camp the hook in order to eventually kill them all, hook all of them once and one of them twice.
---
Does OoO give a perk notification to the killer? Like how survivors can see that they are under the effect of unnerving presence.
---
That sounds like me but vice versa. I ragequit Friday the 13th and go to Dead by Daylight.
---
jesus christ calm down holy shit
---
youve repeatedly said you dont care and yet you had a thread go so deep you have to view it manually, and all youve done is insult him
---
Ah yes I'll be sure to kill all the survivors 40 seconds into the match. Had a game like this just today. Playing trapper on Yamaoka. Spawn in, put one trap and go patrol. After about 15-25 seconds i found someone. Gen is already almost done. Kick gen. Down one quite fast. Three gens pop at the same time after hook. Did you want me to destroy all the gens with my weapon then?
---
I accidentally farmed a dude a dude off hook when i was rank 19. When i tried to heal him and the killer inevitably came back he just stood there and died. I don't play survivor anymore.
---
It lets you see the killer aura when you are looking in their direction, in return it lets the killer see your aura at the same time.
---
What is it
---
nah i had the one on the bottom, one at the top and one window :D
---
They'd probably hire a petite asian girl instead.
---
What Hat?
---
I can see something in the window, but what killer is it?
---
Billy
---
Whispers does trigger on hooked and downed survivors FYI
---
r/SubsIWishIFellFor
---
Just because the game has a horror tag on steam doesn't mean it's not competitive Mario party.
---
**MHMM... THAT'S RIGHT... THAT'S ME BABY!**
---
Should I use keyboard and mouse or controller for either survivor or killer?
---
You do realize Stranger Things released on 17 September and it's now October right?
---
That the period of time that most players want to try the shiny new Killer ends probably a week to maybe two after the release?
---
I just think if the killer hooks another survivor while its active it should deactivate. On the flip side, the timer should work as the end game timer if slugged and last longer because the killer can still tunnel. If you're going to tunnel at least be bold enough to eat the DS.
---
gens presure is hooking survivor. because 1-3 will come to rescue ( if not SWF )
---
Not at all. I mainly play my prestige 3 lvl 50 meg. I‚Äôm a rank 11 and I constantly end up with rank 20‚Äôs. Most of the survivors I match with are all rank 16 and up to 20. Rarely get someone below 15
---
Two totems light up.
---
Once one of the two is cleansed, every survivor is exposed for I 30/45/60.
---
Once one is cleansed the other is returned to being dulled.
---
I don't get the point of these types of posts and this is the only comment that makes any sense
---
they havent confirmed or denied if it will work against myers or not
---
im hoping it doesnt because his t1 phase is already slow enough as it is
---
It was either adept Freddy before the rework, killing all 4 survivors by hand with Myers Tier 3 and grabbing 25 survivors off generators because they're all equally difficult imo. Freddy and Myers achievements were pretty hard to get because DCing is fun right? And grabbing survivors off generators was tricky because I didn't have enough scratched mirror add-ons for Myers and The Game or Lery's or Hawkin's offerings so I had to play without it and do my best. Another way to grab them off of generators was to play as Ghostface and that was really tricky to do because Survivors can easily deactivate my power by seeing a little bit of my character.
---
The ceiling hit just seems mad as hell tho cause nobody was moving. I was stood still across a loop from my friend healing myself and he, also standing still, threw the hatchet at the ceiling and yet it hit me? I don‚Äôt know how that can be connection but maybe I‚Äôm just not knowledgeable enough on game mechanics.
---
his power is made to counter loops. ignore his gas clouds and drop pallets earlier and you should be fine
---
For real?
---
You didnt i did, survivors will run full meta builds that save them a million times over with overpowered items and still have the audacity to complain about Noed
---
So nerf Ds again? No it‚Äôs fine as it is. Why don‚Äôt we start nerfing killer perks because their op. I‚Äôm sure killer mains would get upset. Ds isn‚Äôt op and it‚Äôs perfectly balanced as it is. If the survivor wants to be stupid and run at you just leave them on the ground. Simple.
---
Ghostface is great!
---
mate, i get where you are coming from but thats not the way to go about it, i saw what he posted and i saw you start a huge chain against him which devolved into name calling and him going "prove it" over and over
---
just disengage because all it does is kick up more toxic shitflinging on the sub, and it makes him feel superior because all you did was get mad and reject his proof
---
Yeah maybe that‚Äôs all it is as an example I watched a video of Montos where some of the hatchet misses made me question how they didn‚Äôt hit! I do feel it‚Äôs gotten worse lately though but maybe it is just me!
---
For the record I stated why others would DC, I just alt tab and sit on hook because the world was nice enough to gift me two monitors from thrift stores for far less than what they are worth. 
---
I don't blame anybody who is not allowed to play the game to DC. I don't blame them when it's a 4 slug game, I don't blame them when it's instadown hatchets as you can sit in match for 2 minutes being unable to play assuming you are hooked and face camped. You can't make people waste their time and there is no other way to quantify that.
---
I mean some killers will wait out the timer as it is now, Wouldn't they just benefit from this via shorter wait time? If anything it should deactivate once another survivor is hooked (I thought about "when they are put into the dying state but after an unhook it's common for both survivors to go back down).
---
I see.
---
Sure why not.
---
Am I the only one that remembers that this is the Tom format, not the Mike Wazowski format?
---
I‚Äôve noticed that the only dailies that don‚Äôt change are the ones that are character specific (ie. escape one time with Nancy or open a gate with Jake). Every other daily changes, so I don‚Äôt bother with those anymore.
---
I didn‚Äôt either bother hooking one Bill bc they were so toxic. Just downed them and stood over them til bleed out.
---
quac
---
Alas poor burrito you shall be missed, but damn that was lucky you or someone else found that key in the chest earlier!
---
U guys got the devs to nerf the worst killer in the game, is that not enough? And btw I‚Äôm not complaining about killer nerfs I‚Äôm saying I have met people who want killers in general to get a nerf and it‚Äôs aggravating also I made other points in the original comment
---
My friend insists on flash lighting as the killer is running towards him and it makes me want to die every time I see his aura doing it while I'm using empathy. Then he says flashlights are broken. Lmfao.
---
I love commenting just "ok" because that is all I honestly can think of to say to these kinds of posts
---
That was some serious vectoring
---
Now that sends a clear message. 
---
"I don't care about the points, I just want you to suffer." Lol
---
30 seconds isn't enough to discourage tunneling.  This would just make slugging against it a more viable strategy with little downside for killer.  Decisive is largely a non factor for killers that don't tunnel.  It only feels a bit cheesy if they make it all the way to endgame with it but if it comes down to that situation you essentially lost the game anyways so it doesn't effect much.
---
Oh I know what you mean dude, my gf is constantly complaint about the same problem dude!
---
Change name to DCifubad 
---
Always dc
---
I am the hero dbd needs /s
---
kbm for both
---
This comment makes me lmao
---
Tbh.. Without a video this is very hard to make sense of what the heck you're explaining. What it SEEMS like you're are saying.. is you were in a building? And it hit the ceiling? Or are you talking about the "map ceiling"... In which case... gravity.. IS.. a thing.
---
Nope. I think it‚Äôs pretty fair
---
Diliverance gives you a 100% chance if you safely unhook a Survivor before getting hooked.
---
Slippery Meat gives you extra attempts.
---
Up The Ante increases Luck which increases your odds to unhook yourself.
---
Luck Offerings.
---
Diliverance is the only good one out of them tbh, Slippery Meat is just bad when Deliverance exists (and the only other effect is to help you counter Trapper which means good luck trying to consistently going against a single Killer) and Up The Ante sucks because Luck is just terrible in general.
---
Care to explain? I‚Äôm genuinely wondering a different side
---
I can‚Äôt tell if she scratches your balls while you play or.. um..
---
&gt;Hearthstone
---
Hahaha wrong. Cards are balanced, changed or deleted based on the balance in high ranks and to be used in tournaments
---
&gt;Tell me why it'd be an issue to balance with all ranks in mind?
---
Just look at DbD and you will find your answer
---
A game totally controlled by survivors that can end games in 5min max if they just wanted to win instead of goofing off
---
&gt; Even with Ruin up at low ranks, survivors get pubstomped. Now, imagine that the repair process took even longer. 
---
I won't make the gen take longer. Not at all! Is boring.
---
I wanna make a new objective you have to do to make games longer and more interesting than holding a button and loop around.
---
&gt;What would you do to slow down the game?
---
As said above, secondary objective. Take item x to point y for X times is an example. Would make you go around the map more, introduce a more stealthy meta and a more exciting moments for both sides
---
Of course with map reworks. More pallets, more unsafe than ever and just few good ones. So, low ranks will be happy to have a lot of pallet to play with, at the same time high ranks know those are worthless unless you stun the killer, something that killers will know too. More vault but not broken vaults like some double vaults we have, something like T L walls are fine since are mind gameable and interesting to play with
---
Killer bad survivor good. But seriously you just see more toxic survivors than toxic killers especially at high ranks.
---
She would fail skill checks and I wouldn't so guess again!
---
honestly fuck the spirit dude
---
People just think Mori's are for killing survivors fast, Mori's presents you an awesome animation of the killer you are playing, properly killing the survivor, instead of a hook death which has nothing especial TBH.
---
"Genrushing aint real, get better at map pressure"
---
I second this motion.
---
I definitely get frustrated when I‚Äôm exposed as a survivor I‚Äôd rather have one person exposed whose aura is visible to the killer and have them be one shot than everyone being one shot
---
Thank you! Everyone has been so kind.
---
thanks!
---
True, I‚Äôve been saying for years they should give more bloodpoints for gens considering how many idiots there are that just farm teammates and wait for the hatch.
---
Scream 2, it's on Netflix.
---
When did you get the game?
---
Also, a lot of people both accidentally and purposefully inflate it by just having the game running and not playing.
---
Hot damn
---
We‚Äôll call a vote now. All in favor of carrying out the motion, say yea, all opposed say nay.
---
DBD+Jojo's = Good memes
---
imo, you don't really risk anything for bbq to be worth it. it's really a no-brainer perk that just is overloaded if you ask me. so it's lazy in the sense of like, you really don't have to think at all, and it removes a good portion of the hunting for survs part out of the game more or less. ruin you get immediate returns on, and you pretty much just again throw it on just because why not? you don't have to think at all or play any differently. it's a decent perk on basically any killer.
---
tl;dr, they're lazy because it doesn't force you to think or change your playstyle at all. they basically just double down on what any killer should already be doing in their game (pressuring gens and stringing hooks together).
---
Unless said spirit knows how to walk backwards in phasing...
---
That's it. I haven't played in awhile lol
---
Thank you!  I spent the better part of 2 hours working on this instead of studying for my mid terms haha. I'm super new to video editing so I appreciate the positive feedback!
---
If nobody touch a gen for 10min they are holding the game hostage and you can report them
---
As a survivor main, ive come to believe 5% of the rank 1-8 survivors are legit players. While 95% of them dc their way to gain ranks.
---
Darkness will escape
---
Franklin's is a perk that forces you to drop your item and you lose a % of your items base durability
---
Exposed is a bit much but Blindness actually seems ingenious since it'd make Object Of Obsession unable to be used while on a generator.
---
Yea
---
It is. Meme fomats repeat themselves, just look at all the "man with text behind him" formats
---
Thank god!
---
I'm not sure if the ranks point is necessary? Because most of the time you'll be with ranks similar to yours which will impact the result, plus ranks are always changing and resetting anyway
---
Also track how many campers you meet I guess
---
Freddy needs a small buff. The goose needs a nerf
---
It isn't as common but exist. Also they can be reported for holding the game hostage if they refuse to touch a gen for 10min straight and just hide
---
Pro tip - You can remap all controls...moved my Skill checks to the face buttons on my right hand and havent looked back since. Now I scratch, snack, and drink like there's no tomorrow xD
---
I think you should calm the fuck down. It‚Äôs a discussion post. People have their own opinions. Don‚Äôt be a bitch because someone disagrees with you
---
Wait, you guys are getting paid?
---
Ya ah. Its madness tier up time
---
Count of disconnects by both survivor and killer, and percieved cause.
---
It's not misguided, it's true.  I made no additional statement, other than the killer wins too often at the lower ranks.  I firmly believe that this is a true statement, I explained the many reasons it is likely the case, but never put any spin on it.  I don't know why that is such a hard pill to swallow.  It's just the way the game is designed from the ground up.  It is what it is, I'm merely pointing it out.  Not trying to put any spin on it.
---
I've moved on past the stage - it took me about 20 hours to get through it, but for those first 20 hours killers achieved 4K probably about 80% of the time - and yes - I did keep track.    At my current ranking it's probably more like 33% of the time, and at rank 5 it seems to happen less than 20% of the time.  That's a really, really big disparity, but is VERY common in asymmetrical board games for obvious reasons.  It's extremely difficult to design a game that is balanced the same at all levels of play - this is true of any title, esports or not - and is even more true in asymmetrical games.   It simply comes with the territory and any designer would tell you the same about asymmetrical games.   If you want to discuss possible workarounds, I can think of a few, and even hinted at a couple - but that's not the point of the post.  It's obviously a touchy subject in the community and I learned from last time to start far away from it.
---
As for the pips - I simply said at my rank it's too easy.  Once again - a true statement.  I didn't say it was too easy at higher ranks. It's not a useless statement because it is a true statement.  At my rank, it's too easy.  And because of this, I am playing with people who are way better than me but haven't played quite as much.  Compared to other similar ranked systems, the cause is obvious - it's not based on whether or not you win, it's based on how well you perform in the game.  It stands to reason that I will hit a wall once the other players become way too good, but because of the way the system works, it takes longer to hit that wall than in most ranked systems.  I'm sure the fix for this is just a readjusting of numbers and I think it goes under the radar because not a lot of new players get into the game, binge play and then post about the pip system on reddit - I'm assuming.   Once again - I think it's only so evident because I started binging at the very start of the season - later in the season it would be less obvious.  I feel I covered all of my bases.
---
As far as the rituals go - I am saying as a new player.  Obviously if you have perks and/or experience with every killer and survivor you own, clearly the system is much easier.  But I bet if you I randomly selected 20 other daily systems, 19/20 of those systems would be easier to complete than DBD's for new players.  And that was my statement - compared to other daily systems, DBD's is quite difficult for a brand new player, because it requires quite a bit more competence than other daily systems.  That's all. It's a tricky system for new players.  For me it is not efficient to complete most of my rituals - it is more efficient to simply play the killer/survivor I know and score more points through stronger play.  Eventually that will not be the case, but 30 hours in I still don't think it's worth the time investment - which is not the case in most daily systems.
---
Every game I play with Freddy or the Doctor I earn between 50-60k BP (Doctor has always been a BP machine for for farming). So it's all fairly okay, Both have all perks available so it's really them I play to pump BP into other killers.
---
Ok... well if you didn't see the hatchet ACTUALLY HIT the ceiling whatsoever and are now offering the suggestion that I would have mind you.. that you don't even know whether it had a collision zone (which it being a new map there's a chance there isn't) and simply didn't see the hatchet re fall and hit...why.. on earth.. did you start off with making the echo chamber claim of ermergerd hert berxes. Again... without a video... who the hell knows. You could have found a bug where its registering a person in 2 spots for all I know. Making the absolutely ridiculous assumption that hitboxes were made larger in any way yet alone... 20 feet tall is absolutely the problem with people who don't understand basic game mechanics making hap hazard comments like your post. If you have a video.. please post it, if you don't.. stop making echo chamber comments in the aims to fit in with the rest of the fools. Js.
---
Yup then spams your inbox on PS4 how I‚Äôm a trashy killer!

I‚Äôll try

I see that, yeah

No I mean't it as a joke because here you implied that you are not strong enough/broken to take on another Plague therefore, I suggested to cleanse himself because in-game you have a "broken" status effect when fully sick and when you cleanse yourself you are fully heal and ready to go again. You get what I am implying here?
---
Yea eventually i left it alone, really I should've left it alone to begin with tbh, it just triggered me that he was posting this survey like it was 100% accurate and then acting superior to other people who were disagreeing with that.
---
Nurse isnt really hard, She just takes some practice to get the muscle memory and then its easy.
---
(Nurse main btw)
---
What magical rank are you where this kind of shit is happening
---
Anyone else (Not SWF mains) feel like the key should be scaled back? Seems like 90% of games end up with someone getting a key and escaping without finishing the gens.
---
Most of the time when they drop a pallet and get hit, from their point of view it's a 50/50.
---
Nobody is our there wanting to get hit when they're at a pallet.
---
I'm almost positive Bubba would let people go ridiculously easy without his family's influence. If he was suddenly alone. I don't even know if he'd capture people in the first place.
---
yea it is a discussion, I will give my thoughts how I want to sorry if you can't handle me being 100% honest about dumb that idea is.
---
True, as killer you need to assert dominance over the battlefield fast it's the best way to counter gen rushing. Some killers are naturally gifted for it, others need specific perks or add-ons.
---
It's normal. While most games will just adjust your rank based on fixed criteria, DBD adjust those criteria to be more difficult as you rank up. The lower ranks are easier to climb because the requirements are lower, while the higher ranks make you do more in a match to earn pips towards ranking up.  
---
I see others have already recommend some looping stuff to you, so I will just leave you with a piece of advice. Always run with a plan. Never let yourself get caught in a position where you don't know what to run to. You should ideally have a pallet in mind that you can run to if the killer starts chasing you. As you learn the maps you will learn to chain the pallets together, and weave in window loops in between them. Good luck!
---
Rank 4
---
Yeah the joke went over my head. I'm sure someone with some brain cells would get it, but I've lost them all trying to play against the plague.
---
Reminder to always escape before Freddy hooks someone.
---
Ah shit forgot about Prayerbeads Spirit. Probably be so much easier to grab survivors
---
The time has past for you to get consistent demogorgons, since the chapter has been out for a while.
---
Maybe it's just a Feng thing but.. do whatever you need to survive
---
Selling your mates included

Wraith is perfect. God, I love my ding dong boy.

I can handle 100% honesty, I just can‚Äôt handle rudeness for no reason. Fuck out of here

How original. This is definitely the most not seen thing on this subreddit, thank you!
---
The only time it‚Äôs fun banter is when you let them escape. Otherwise you‚Äôre just being a fucker and wasting everyone‚Äôs time
---
You can blame the addition of the EGC Hatch Close mechanic for that change.  Unfortunately it was a necessary one to prevent her from being broken in that scenario.
---
Exact time of release? In 2hrs or mid-day on the 22nd?
---
When I want to play ranked matches with a friend and don't want anyone to come in uninvited, which they can lol
---
it‚Äôs harder to make it to the exit gates being powered as a survivor than as a killer, the only time you don‚Äôt as a killer is if you kill everyone before hand
---
I've read everything on Freddy's addons and power, and there isn't something to change the rate of falling asleep. If the clock hands were moving at a different rate between you and the other survivors, that some kind of bug. Did you happen to notice if another one of the survivors was using the new key addon called the Unique Wedding Ring? If there were no obsession perks other than the DS, then that guy should have been the obsession. The only way I can think of that would prevent that would be if he had the ring, since it's supposed to reduce your chances of being the obsession. Maybe it's a new bug. I'll link to the [item](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Unique_Wedding_Ring) so you can take a look.
---
They reward you and Achievement the first time you do it though, good enough for me!
---
Now print the 4,000,000,000 needed to max out a killer/survivor.
---
Yeah, so to clarify, it's not difficult to obtain -- you'll want to level Bubba for his teachable BBQ &amp; Chilli regardless, since it flatly increases all BP Gained as a killer plus a nifty side effect to use in the match; namely that you can see the aura of all survivors further than 40 meters from where you hook someone for a couple of seconds.
---
Precisely, it picks one at random unless you have perks that make you the obsession.
---
I am not sure if any other factors play in here.
---
Killer perks grant the killer some points or advantages by killing or hitting the obsession. Etc.
---
The majority of the the games you play dont really have that much toxic stuff in it but a lot of people are cry babies on the sub so makes it seem worse than it is.
---
Gladly üòé
---
Yeah, DBD‚Äôs community is inexplicably toxic. There‚Äôs not a ladder or season prizes or anything to win, and players will still go out of their way on consoles to go to your profile, start a new message group, and tell you to kill yourself. Otherwise, lovely group.
---
I understand beads might be a issue but I think they‚Äôll be increased to red addons rarity
---
Nice. I‚Äôm right behind you at rank 3.its such a pain the ass. I get lobbies with all rank 15+ that I dodge. So it takes like 39min to find a game.
---
I have like 50 hours of afk time cuz im lazy
---
  I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, *and Hell followed with him*.
---
I see what you did there
---
It tries, but if matchmaking takes too long it will end up matching you with people outside your level.
---
Whoa you play this game a lot
---
Its fucking impossible to use the nurse to her full potential on the ps4 unless you get a group of potatoes
---
Killers can still be looped, gens can still be done in 3 minutes. Sounds like a odd analogy to me.
---
Da fuck am I watching atm?
---
Truth
---
&gt;Hahaha wrong. Cards are balanced, changed or deleted based on the balance in high ranks and to be used in tournaments
---
Cards are never deleted, and balance changes take forever. They also wait until a new year before hall of faming problem cards.
---
They also nerfed Grim Patron, one of the most skill intensive decks. 
---
&gt;A game totally controlled by survivors that can end games in 5min max if they just wanted to win instead of goofing off
---
Yep, this happens sometimes. Killers can also end games in the same time too. 
---
Sometimes games end in 5 minutes because you played terribly, sometimes because you got hit with an optimal 4 man SWF on a survivor biased map. It happens, the game is asymmetrical in nature. 
---
&gt;I wanna make a new objective you have to do to make games longer and more interesting than holding a button and loop around.
---
I don't disagree. 
---
&gt;As said above, secondary objective. Take item x to point y for X times is an example. Would make you go around the map more, introduce a more stealthy meta and a more exciting moments for both sides
---
&gt;Of course with map reworks. More pallets, more unsafe than ever and just few good ones. So, low ranks will be happy to have a lot of pallet to play with, at the same time high ranks know those are worthless unless you stun the killer, something that killers will know too. More vault but not broken vaults like some double vaults we have, something like T L walls are fine since are mind gameable and interesting to play with
---
I don't disagree, but unsafe pallets are really boring for both sides. I'd be open for way more mind-gameable loops, that weren't biased towards either side.
---
I got that reference
---
I dodge when I get all rank 15+ because it‚Äôs not worth playing with scrubs that dc on first hook or down.
---
I feel personally attacked and i don‚Äôt like it
---
I do understand that yes. I was trying on and off since it‚Äôs release date in sept. I‚Äôm just asking why I can‚Äôt find it in a match, that‚Äôs all.
---
You really didn‚Äôt specify sorry, PC player :P queue times vastly different from platform to platform
---
Wow i didn't know that ghostface was getting movespeed buffed. Can he do kickflips too?
---
The perk you use when the toolboxes + flashlights = 3 or more
---
You'll have to show dedication when starting this game, overall the concept is nice the fanbase and players could be better...
---
So other people don't join? I just want to queue with one friend. Not other friends that want to randomly join without asking
---
Leatherface?
---
You poor soul
---
That‚Äôs really helpful thank you!! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Ah ok, thanks

Yeah... he‚Äôs not great

Nah. Laurie and Nancy are in SS tier, Kate moves down to S tier.
---
Hit boxes are same, it‚Äôs just latency. Most of the time you can avoid it by dodging any lobby that‚Äôs consistently above about 120 ping or so.
---
not sure about other platforms, but you can block all incoming messages on ps4 and proceed to not give a fuck about anything anyone has to say to you. as long as you feel you‚Äôre playing fairly and try your best, you shouldn‚Äôt give a shit anyway. TRY to have fun. you‚Äôll get all sorts of shit in-game, but it‚Äôs not always 100% a terrible experience.
---
I find it's nowhere near as bad as a lot of people say it is. Most post game chats is people saying nothing or gg and that's it.
---
Only a few things are really bad in this game, people that click flashlights just to annoy you and killers that face camp. But neither of those happen very often. Disconnecting is a more common issue but it still doesn't happen super often.
---
Get ready for the honkening! I saw it, it is coming!
---
thats the thingy, most people dont like practicing, i also play fighting games, a game where EVERYONE needs practice, in dbd u dont need much practice to be good with survivors.
---
I also got Will Smith when I did this... does that mean... I look like Doc?
---
I don't understand this line of thought: Why are we blaming the killer's perk for getting a 4k when the survivors are the one giving him the 4k?
---
If the killer truly didn't get any sacrifices until noed kicks in, how in the hell are the survivors so bad that they all get sacrificed before they can get the doors open?
---
Conversely, say the killer gets a couple kills in before NOED: that means you got killed by a killer who didn't have 4 perks active at the time.
---
His wiring was done by Marques Brownlee
---
There will only be an obsession if either the killer or a survivor is running an obsession perk. They are randomly determined at the start of the game.
---
As for the effect of the obsession, it varies depending on which obsession perk your using. For example: the killer perk Save the Best For Last causes one survivor to be the obsession. Each time the killer attacks a survivor who isn't the obsession, their attack recovery speed is reduced and attacking the obsession will increase it.
---
On the Survivor side, the perk object of obsession reveals your aura to the killer when they look in your direction and the killer's aura to you when you look in their direction.
---
I upvoted not because I care, but because I know this subreddit is chock full of killer mains who can't handle hearing it, and will insta downvote.
---
They shouldn't be able to join your game if you don't invite them.
---
oh interesting. I play PS4 and someone outside the lobby has to request to join, which I just ignore if I don‚Äôt want to play with them. they can just join without permission on XBOX?
---
*thats exactly what a survivor would say!*
---
FAX
---
*yare yare daze*
---
Ehhh. Idk. I mean, it's scary.
---
Exactly! I usually don‚Äôt even bring any item anymore because of this perceived notion that SWF + items = toxic assholes. It just try to play the game and have some fun.
---
When you're leveling through a bloodweb just focus on rushing the perks you want and then buying the cheapest things available to progress through the web.   Focusing on strong items or addons slows the grind immensely.  You can fly through webs if you use this strat.
---
&gt; *How does a survivor become the ‚Äúobsession‚Äù*
---
* Bring a perk that makes you the [Obsession](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Obsession).
---
* Be in a team of people using Obsession perks and get unlucky.
---
* Be against a killer with an Obsession perk and get *real* unlucky.
---
Depending on the perk there'll be advantages and disadvantages to being the Obsession - both for them, and the for the killer.
---
Dying Light, for example, lets the Obsession unhook faster and lets them heal *other people* faster. The flipside is that every time the killer hooks someone who isn't the Obsession, the non-Obsessions all get a penalty to sabotage, repair, and healing.
---
Lol.
---
Farmed me
---
And there's the story how I became a Feng main
---
Now it‚Äôs time to get that ivory Mori :D
---
if u play with another friends that decent, ez games, we are good at long chases, and doing gens.
---
Toxic killers I sometimes see more in high ranks. Toxic survivors are everywhere, and the best way to test will be this event. Deranking SWFs just looking to ruin a new killer‚Äôs fun.
---
Or, because since the survivors can gang up on the killer with insults, and the survivors can back up their friends but the killer is by himself.
---
Idk I played for the first time last night on the switch and didn‚Äôt have any issues. I think that subs are a fine place to vent, but hopefully 98% of the time that‚Äôs not the experience people are having!
---
Why is she sad D: . Your friend did a fine job.

If it follows the pattern, 11am ET on the 22nd.

Yeah I did report them

Ain't no way son takes 13 minutes to print one
---
Scarier than the actual Freddy
---
Wait, it‚Äôs haunted grounds isn‚Äôt it
---
Exactly. When I see toxic post endgame chat from survivors, usually other survivors (or I, I‚Äôm a meg main) tell them to tone it down and not be a dick. Otherwise, everyone‚Äôs kinda nice/just neutral
---
Whats wrong with that? At my rank it seems like most killers run it, and its harder to cleanse it after its lit. Its kinda a bullshit perk that ruins your experience so I cleanse every totem.
---
So you think Myers should essentially have no ability?
---
You aren't required to feed yourself to the tryhard killer attempting to cheese the hatch spawn with mandatory 3rd man slugs.  You're fine.  I can understand the survivor possibly being a little annoyed but the entitled killer with no respect for anyone's time can eat a double dick sandwich.
---
Would love some kind of Nightmare creatures or Charlie from Don't Starve. Wilson would be a nice survivor.

I don‚Äôt think anyone does it and brags. If they do it‚Äôs sarcasm. They are just cool animations and end the game fast.
---
Or why the killer is?
---
Sony also allow smite but those games are the only games that enable cross play on xb1 also including gears of war..and I stated that but those killers are exceptions and good survivors wouldn't be any different than survivors using kb+m seen as there are literally no advantages between the 2. But mostly was talking about if it was to be able to be a thing if people agree it'd be pretty cool to have not aiming at the "frame rates" etc...
---
There are no trolly pros. Just overconfident individuals.
---
You see more posts about the toxic stuff because it's usually rants or complaints or memes about it. People post more about the toxicity than they do the positive stuff, but it doesn't mean the positive sides dont exist. The game is really fun to play even if you do get a couple of scummy matches
---
Regardless of the fact it‚Äôs bullshit or not. It‚Äôs fine to think so; however, I think you‚Äôd be better off busting out a few gens in the time you‚Äôd spend trying to prevent NOED from appearing, and it may not even be there.
---
I‚Äôm gonna ignore the blatant patronising tone and state it‚Äôs a totally different experience on console with the awful frame rate and terrible sensitivity at 100%
---
The maps that you get organically
---
Why would I be that? I am well aware of my decisions.
---
Take off self care too. Not worth using it.
---
Now I want this for my dog!
---
I've seen the mori brag posts on here before.  It's super sad but it does happen.
---
Well for wraith, of course he‚Äôs a good boy
---
For legion, maybe Susie she a cool kid
---
Bill will sadly probably be the only liscensed character to not receive any new cosmetics due to him not having any alts in any of the L4D games and due to valve being to protective over the property, I'm surprised they got him on console.
---
Yes, but its significantly harder to be a killer facing red rank friends, than to face a red rank killer with red rank friends, coming from a guy who has done both...a lot
---
Ps anyone who knows how did I get it because I know they are in the game but I don't remember getting it
---
I would say run Spine Chill, get used to a strong exhaustion perk, and learn to loop. You don‚Äôt have to be great at it, but predicting the killer a little better and looking behind you more often made the difference for me, I was like you stuck unable to go past 15
---
Good luck mate!
---
Wot
---
He means fun for the killer lol.  Moris are very much a one way street.
---
I main legion so I know the pain lol 
---
One day you'll get that buff
---
The reset might skew the data.  Otherwise I think the rank data would be interesting.  We know the rank 1 meta perks, but it‚Äôs probably different in lower ranks.
---
I‚Äôm interested in which killers are played at different ranks...but that might also be skewed by the archive challenges.
---
Also Include what platform you‚Äôre playing on OP
---
I‚Äôm rank 11 and that has been happening to me as well. I had to wait 20 minutes to play as survivor and I literally readied up as killer and it instantly loaded. When I finally loaded as survivor, we had to wait an additional 10 minutes for a killer to join the lobby. I have no idea why it‚Äôs like that, the only thing I can think of is perhaps others are trying to rank up their Stranger Things survivors but the DLC came out a while ago so it‚Äôs probably not it.
---
Happy GUAUABAUAHABAIAHAHAHUAHBAJU noises
---
This is the top quality shit posting I live for
---
In short I'm talking about if frames worked the same regardless of nurse and huntress Cross play would be amazing. Ain't no body gonna complain if you're a good huntress or nurse it doesn't matter the Playform you're still good(and yes console have some really good nurse mains despite ignorant opinions of people who have never been red rank on console or played on console)
---
Less standard ‚Äúlooping‚Äù. He uses the gas to cut off the loops but he slows down when winding up a throw, this gives you time to keep running to a new loop or vault. Escapes against the clown are often more linear rather than running loops
---
what i see are just some salty toxic survivors who failed to be toxic because they got stomped by the killer, reminds me when i went against 3 syringe insta heal survivors and they dc cuz i moried their friend and they couldnt insta heal her within the first 30 second of the match as spirit.
---
You should try her on PS4 tho. But even on PC I'm sure the first few games as nurse can be quite painful.  Even as a baby survivor I managed to outsmart baby nurses, it's a whole different playstyle that might need lots of guessing, but I'm sure it's worth mastering
---
Well yeah, She isnt good on console. Thats why Im talking about PC
---
New weapon!
---
Bro, that attempt was pretty good!
---
I would walk away and be immersed just in case...
---
... The fact that you think me emphasizing text by caps.. or that I've somehow insulted you on some personal level.. are attacks on you.. is not a fault of my own.. It's you being highly sensitive and taking offence to something that has been repeated NUMEROUS times by people in this sub and the devs themselves. I didn't force you to say it was hitboxes.. you chose to do that (full knowing its not hitboxes in ANY WAY and that the issues are latency related) yet you still chose to do so. My job in life isn't being as delicate and nice as possible to every ill conceived thought or poorly constructed argument/explanation, I'm quite literally telling you the facts of the matter and for whatever reason instead of looking at that for what its worth... you've gotten offended. People who don't understand the game mechanics who feel they are knowledgeable enough to still comment on them.. are by definition... fools. Making a clone comment to speak on the subject when you KNOW that its not hitboxes... makes you just as foolish. But if you just wanna play the victim card your whole life.. go for it. My point simply stands.. without a video.. your brief and un-detailed explanation adds nothing to any analysis, and only serves to fuel people who don't understand mechanics seeing this post and feeling justified having incorrect echo chamber beliefs about "hitboxes".
---
Oh ok cool. Good to know
---
I have a keyboard.  Rocket League and Ark.
---
Wowzers that‚Äôs epic, uhh how about spirit fury, just as a tradition of spirit perks? Or discordance If you‚Äôre up for it.
---
I think part of the issue is matchmaking. I rarely play killer because for some reason my average queue time is 10+ minutes so I'm rank 20 typically. But it usually matches me with rank 12-16 survivors. It's rare I play against a rank 19-20 survivor.
---
make auto reverse trap in the door is more than enough. or make it injuring the survivor while going inside locker
---
What is the benefit of this? Just giving the opportunity to use a different character you may not have unlocked?
---
Yeah, I'm quite stubborn!  They surfaced in the end but it's definitely scummy to do that.  If they don't like Ghostface, why not just get the bloody game done with?!
---
So pig mixed with demogorgon... Okay
---
Well the game is even more unfair in terms of lag towards survivors, WHICH WAS THE MAIN THING PEOPLE COMPLAINED ABOUT TO GET DEDICATED SERVERS.
---
 So my feedback is that that the test has failed.
---
a haha
---
Two things:
---
# 1. t h i g h s
---
2. what is that thing on her knee?
---
Yes, it definitely is.  I was just playing normally, just getting to grips with his power etc...
---
Arguing that a punishment for a DC would just make people suicide is partially valid.
---
There should still be a punishment no matter what workaround you get. Honestly I feel the 'struggle state' should be removed entirely as it's a garbage mechanic anyway, possibly remove the ability to give up on the hook meaning if you want to leave you must DC
---
Fax, only time I use them is when it is a ritual.
---
Fantastic job. Zyoom
---
Yeah I thought after I commented that the only benefit I see it seeing which ranks use which perks, but a result like that may be hard to find considering how long it can take to rank up so they might only see what ranks close to them use
---
I know it‚Äôs not as good as a tactic, but I find stealth can work well against the Clown. A lot of clown killers I‚Äôve played with go to gens and throw a bottle to catch any survivors within the range of the gas cloud. I just play carefully near gens and make sure I‚Äôm not too close to get caught in the gas but I can still see the area. Other than that, try and see when he‚Äôs about to throw a bottle in a chase and try and either dodge it and go another direction or fake going one way to try and get him to throw to the other direction.
---
Oh yeah, no remorse shown for those. Especially afterward when you see all the survivors complaining about how you camped and tunneled. And that you had no excuse for what you did. You know, Survivor handbook and all. I play both survivor and killer pretty evenly and I rarely complain. Survivors are usually pretty toxic in post game chat. Every once in a while you find a group that restores your hope in humanity.
---
Took me a second but that‚Äòs a potato isn‚Äòt it
---
Omg this is so sad, Alexa play bubba screeches for 10 hours
---
This is a pretty toxic build but if you take your time in a game and don‚Äôt gen rush you can find the totems. What really makes this build toxic is whatever add ons or offerings they have. Example: wraith and his totally silent bell, huntress with her one hit hatchet, and moris of course. That being said, I get the same rage when I see this build over and over cause it‚Äôs just no fun to play against. It‚Äòa difficult and gets stale. Personally what has helped me most in those stupid games is to just set my controller down and take my headset off. In that moment of ‚Äúfuck this guy I‚Äôm gonna DC‚Äù just take away your own ability to leave by dropping your controller or pushing away from your keyboard. If a killer isn‚Äôt gonna hook me and just let me bleed out or pick me up and drop me, I will literally leave the room or get on my phone.
---
This is why Killer's run Franklin's. It's why I run Franklin's. They can't function without their precious flashlight and go back for it immediately, and get downed for it. 
---
Also, LMFAO at claiming a perk is toxic. Perks you run can be stupid (like putting NOED on a Killer who can 1 hit players naturally) to run, sure. 
---
I'm still waiting for someone to claim running dying light and thana together is toxic, because holy shit does it slow them down a ton once your stacks get going.
---
The game isnt bad. There is always going to be those times were it gets frustrating. And there will aways be people who will be toxic. If you just ignore it and go on with your day, its a pretty fun game
---
I literally just said in my last comment that I wasn‚Äôt aware it was latency due to the new update until the other user mentioned that. Acting superior to someone is now not insulting to them? That‚Äôs news to me. You can keep going on if you like Mr r/iamverysmart but I am signing out of this conversation as you are just repeating words you think sound fancy now. TYVM for your information, it was extremely helpful and not at all condescending.
---
I can tell you‚Äôre a survivor main, but ya, ur right.
---
When I'm playing 4 man SWF killers dodge probably a fourth to a third of the time and it's rare we take items in.
---
Just use an adapter. 45 fps isn't even that bad.
---
Strelok.
---
Because people get tired of playing at rank 1.  Similar reason to why people derank.  This probably curbs some deranking/DCing.
---
A crappy bandaid :')
---
First person to actually give some tips. Thanks but this doesn't work indoors like in the lab, which is where this game took at and he just kind of looked unstopable.
---
&gt;I don't disagree, but unsafe pallets are really boring for both sides. I'd be open for way more mind-gameable loops, that weren't biased towards either side.
---
That's my point but certain maps are way too big and more unsafe pallets are the easiest way to make things decent, keeping just a few safe before a rework that might take long.
---
A good example is the new preschool that is yes annoying sometimes but I can't say it's unfair
---
&gt;Cards are never deleted, and balance changes take forever. They also wait until a new year before hall of faming problem cards.
---
I don't play hearthstone but I love the media and got informed about changes, unable to play certain things in standard (like magic. That's what I mean for deleted) and tournaments based on the expansion.
---
It's just like magic but easier. Which is also not balanced towards low skilled but nonetheless fun
---
&gt;the game is asymmetrical in nature. 
---
I had a problem with this. Sounds like implying asymmetrical means also that the numerous role can also be the power role sometimes. Which is bs
---
Several time is been showed how easy is to end a game even without any comms, in few minutes in any map. The survivors have control of the timer that killer is under. It feels like to be an AI than a player as Killer due to this limitations
---
You can't be proactive you can just be reactive.. as the power role
---
So because YOU have those things.. you think its a reasonable demand that they add a function to the game to benefit a very small percentage of players, in a version of the game that is being fine tuned for console style play and not the original PC base.. when a pre existing system already exists on those platforms.. is more commonly used.. more efficient.. and takes no additional effort.. coding.. bug testing etc to use. Solid argument.
---
I think it‚Äôs just a lack of killers
---
I think that it could add a whole new level of mind game to the game
---
Which one? I mean, Frank or Joey I assume.
---
Well see if people JUST ACCEPTED THE DOC‚ÄôS GODDAMN TREATMENT HE WOULDN‚ÄôT NEED TO PUNISH SURVIVORS
---
You have to record and send a ticket
---
Actually its a really small pumpkin but I see how you would think its a potato.üòÇ
---
It‚Äôs probably the fact that there are two or three insta heals every match.
---
Tbh m8, I‚Äôm new. I didn‚Äôt know that was ability
---
That‚Äôs why I run ds
---
Looks like Frank. Joey is black
---
I mean, most people don‚Äôt want to die, but in my opinion, if you wanted to survive, you shouldn‚Äôt have gotten downed in the first place.
---
Too bad players sometimes don't care about the random but just survive. Like me
---
Isn't being coward, is being wise. I'm sorry if for you not fall to an obvious bait is being coward,  but that's just being smart
---
So Cute ! You forget how annoying is playing against her
---
As a demo main I approve
---
Haha great work, I think theres some usable material there. It's really hard finding anything for the original killers
---
LMAO i thought I was the only one
---
Hahahah I'm dead

Franklin's Demise (Unique Cannibal Park)
---
Upon bitch slapping a survivor carrying an item, they drop it. Items dropped via Franklin's Demise lose a bit of charge.
---
We're all entitled to our opinions of how he plays. There are times where I totally agree with what he does, and times where I think he goes overboard.
---
How? Swf groups exist and will deny it‚Äôs existence
---
Randoms will figure it out quick too
---
It‚Äôll just become a worse wraith!
---
Honestly, that rank is harder to rank up in than green...maybe purple.  I‚Äôm a killer main who was rank 1 in survivor.  Killers actually hard camp.  The ones who don‚Äôt camp are likely survivor mains who should be higher rank but only play for dailies.    Teammates try to Kobe and then give up on struggle (nonempathy points).  If you are hooked once, they might not come for the save.  My last few matches I‚Äôve run the killer for what should have been 3-5 gens each time.  No one does gens.  I‚Äôve died my first hook each match I was hooked.  They‚Äôre all crouch walking around/hiding when their teammate is being carried to the hook across the map.  
---
With that being said, don‚Äôt make an excuse of it.  You‚Äôll get out of there if you deserve it.  
---
Focus on scoring in all categories.  Gens, totems, saves.  You might have to play selfish and go hatch in certain situations.  
---
Don‚Äôt go to a gen right away.  You don‚Äôt want to be the first one caught.  Do a totem, then hop on a gen.  If a teammate is injured get ready to go for the save.   You need those points.  Don‚Äôt rush it if the killer is camping.  There will be an opening.
---
Practice looping.  Spend a few nights charging the killer at the start of the match.  Look at the near by jungle gyms.  Figure out which ones are good.  Stay calm and don‚Äôt worry if they catch you.  Focus on wasting as much of their time as possible.  If you die, on to the next match and do it again.
---
YouTube videos help.  Most streamers are great at looping but don‚Äôt explain it.  Check out fungoose on twitch.  It explains every movement.  He breaks down what is happening across the map with teammates and the killer.  He explains what everyone is doing wrong and what they should have done.  Have caffeine ready because he talks fast.

So be forced to be an m1 killer and have zero chance of tricking the other out, forcing longer loops? Gtfo out of here.
---
DUDE I versed this yesterday as a killer. This nea was doing it all game. So I let the one person actually going for saves and gens live. Finally found her switching lockers. Called me a hacker and teaming with a survivor lmao.
---
All I see is Nea attacking billy and him being unable to escape her grasp
---
Does the DBD have problems keeping a steady 60FPS or is it just my PC? I can play some newer games than this at 70+ on high usually.
---
Awesome tips! Yep, luckily for me I was only playing at Rank 10 because i know more experienced killers would have been able to track me through a blind. I'll definitely experiment with ways to do window fakes and more efficient blinds. Thank you!

I'm pretty sure that's essentially a thing on almost all pc games because of steam. Consoles dont have the chat option on any game that I know of

When does the Halloween event start
---
Except it's not, since the others are working as intended (nerfs needed =/= not working as intended, mind you), and this clearly isn't working as it should against Freddy since it does work as it should on literally every other killer. And what bias? I didn't prove shit about any bias, lmao. Stop making shit up.
---
And the shit about "bet you're ok with that one though" is what I'm talking about. I don't have time for that.
---
Keys are bullshit and should be changed as well, but they have much more counterplay than moris. If you see someone in the lobby with a key, you can tunnel them and get rid of it, run Franklin‚Äôs, or kill everyone before the hatch spawns. If a killer brings a mori, the only option is to be good enough to run them for an eternity and hope they aren‚Äôt smart enough to ever switch targets.
---
sumns up steam forum, those guys call literally everything a survivor does toxic meanwhile literally everything a killer does is him "just doing his job"

In my lore, all legion characters are old men who can't let go of the past.

---
Tomorrow around 11 am est most likely
---
Thanks uwu
---
Yes it is, in my opinion anyway. At that point, all the gens are done and the killer has no other objective. I personally don't do it when I play killer but I don't mind it when it's being done to me while playing survivor.
---
What would you rather him do?

I mean, they can be pretty stupid once.

My favorite stereotype is that every David has Dead Hard. I waited for a DH today even though I had seen at the beginning of the chase the David had Sprint Burst.

Jakes tho.

Finally, someone who got the meaning of "fire up" correctly. Freddy is truly on fire here.

No. But if you're close enough, you'll see the User's aura too.

I like this idea a lot. The thing would be dope.
---
But yeah, it would basically be a different type of Wraith, but to be honest I like wraith and would love to see a more viable version.
---
Well the same does about the abuse of OoO and insta , people are using the red instas right now and using OoO every game I‚Äôve play and saving the purple one- \‚Äô_‚Äô/-

Okay thank you. I knew it revealed the survivor, I just didn't know if it notified the killer in any way.
---
***Ass Taunt User
---
All right man, I'm just going to be real here. That was hot garbage lol. Of what little I watched you wasted a bunch of time at the very beginning hiding in a locker for no reason, then you didn't even go try to save your friend or unhook them, and then when you got chased you ran to the absolute worst place possible, the basement. I mean it was kind of funny but the performance was an absolute mess. Not that I'm by any means a good player but I would never imagine anybody wanting to watch video of me play. But good luck to you and hope you get some subscribers and views.
---
In addition to the other two answers, dedicated servers will also allow for more accurate tracking of malicious disconnects, as well as the potential for reliable methods of handling them.
---
Describe exactly how anything I just stated was "wrong".  Your second comment stated you thought walking around but not doing an objective gave the survivor crows it doesn't.  You were wrong, but you were so full of yourself in that first comment lol.
---
What I described is 100% accurate.  Climb into a locker, chill for 30 seconds.  Get out.  Walk around a bit. Get back into the locker chill for another 30 seconds.  Get out.  Walk to a new locker, climb in chill for 30 seconds, get out.  Walk around for a bit. Get back......that's how they hold games hostage as survivor in OP's described scenario.  Again please go into detail on what I was supposedly "wrong" about.
---
They can indeed be stupid. But mind you, SWF does not necessarily mean full comms or frequent team members.
---
I'm gonna have to believe you on the map part because I honestly don't care enough to go watch the match. I still hold my ground when I say that the build was really bad for chases, but I can understand he could've won nevertheless if he just played right even if the Map wasn't the best for spirit.
---
Getting into his behaviour, from what I have seen of Tru3T4l3nt, he is not that easy to irritate, and is not really arrogant in my experience, yet I haven't and won't see the video, so I can't say anything about your opinion right now aside from what I know: I have never seen him being inherently arrogant, but there were some cases he acted in a very toxic way and didn't admit to it. That's all I can say about "arrogance".
---
It was mostly closets but that would be sick for sure
---
i love you
---
I play killer and survivor and I still don't like high mobility killers
---
Do you play killer? If so, you must really like losing. If you play survivor, you must have absolutely no ability to see things from the other side's point of view.

This is the best DBD meme I've seen so far, I'd gold you if I had money.

Tbh that's not a bad thing. That extra work can deter a lot of unneeded anger which will always be a good thing. Then if they do proceed to message someone.. PS for example has good moderation systems in place to quickly punish harassers/speech in bad taste. On PC it's kinda left up to just the devs and can be sorta tossed to the wind as you can just minimize the chat anyways. Plus from experience there are alot more juveniles who play on the consoles as opposed to PC.. which don't need any easier way to be able to angst out their frustrations on others. The demographics of how the systems are used and by whom, with their current capabilities are already reasonably fair without adding any more complications to gameplay and or game function for the few people who may or may not benefit from such a feature.
---
Ardetha is very commonly wrong too, so they have that in common
---
he's just trying to secure a kill, didn't bring any hex perks, had pop goes the weasel but didn't get enough hooks to use it effectively, had overcharge but didnt kick enough gens. in conclusion he was not good as a killer
---
The amount of times I‚Äôve been given mercy by Pig is unreal. Such a fun killer to go against as well
---
Yea because they're weebs

Still, you got them and with Trapper no less. Fair play.
---
or a splinter offering, but that is if you need a final reason to stick a rusty nail up your nose and remove part of your brain because you will get a probing up the challenger deep if the survivor team have at least 3 working synapses
---
I already hate you for using Franklin's
---
I couldn't stop laughing finding them all, so I had to share
---
Or save them to get more points during the bloodhunt..?
---
the killer was playing badly, not using he's perks effectively and doing very little pressure, looping him was quite easy. keep in mind i'm rank 6 and killers at this stage should be decent enough to get 1 kill at least in the mid game or even early game. and in the end, just to ensure 1 kill, camped me. none of the survivors in the lobby were being jerks to the killer
---
I forgot to add a few things, but
---
The first pair of dice would also increase luck during a trial, and the killer offering is secret to survivors. My first thought was directly stealing blood points from others with the offering, but that would be too cruel.
---
Because people need something to hate and deflect their shortcomings to. Also Spirit is very easy to get a large chunk of her max performance out of, compared to Nurse, (which is bad) so Spirit is just SUPER common, and while I love Spirit - both playing as and against her - I definitely got a little bit annoyed over just how often I see her. That being said, other than Beads she's balanced, and people just cry a bunch.
---
But it gives the same bonus no matter when you use them.
---
Yeah. The ranking system will punish you for stomping a survivor team. It annoys me when I get 4ks but only black pip. They need to fix rankings.
---
Getting 4 kills... doesn't mean a whole lot in the realm of "doing good." Your emblems would be telling you what you are failing at. Did they get all the gens done really fast and then you just slugged for the 4 kills? Well then you're probably not gonna pip. Did you 1 shot everyone and have very little chase and downed everyone in the first 2 minutes? Well then you're probably not gonna pip. Read the emblems. They're not just fancy symbols to look at.
---
Yes. He‚Äôs both very fun and powerful (when used the right way). However, if you play as him, you‚Äôll need to have an understanding of survivor habits, spawns, and mindgames.
---
It's usually called "Quiter bonus"
---
i dont use noed anymore as the survivors always do bones before the gens get done, i just play myers to get those oneshots easy peasy. DS is much better a survivor perk than noed is a killer perk
---
Yes, but there's also the issue of the frequency and amount and within a time frame and who's reporting.
---
This isn't a black and white issue which people seem to forget
---
Top 10 photos taken moments before disaster
---
Literally every single game has atleast 1 person who d/c's. And then you get games like this.
---
I play killer in the least cancer way too, i hook someone and instantly go across the map looking for other gens letting that person get unhooked and healed. People literally just d/c the first time they get downed and there seems to be no downside in doing so, and if there is - it clearly isn't bad enough.
---
EDIT: I'm getting downvoted for idk what reason, not flexing how i play but more just letting you know i don't facecamp or tunnel etc (which can be understandable why people rage quit)
---
Not too sure where the complaining is coming from, as the game has become more popular as a result of all of these changes. We're at over 20,000 people that play this daily, this is double from what it was when it first came out. So many games have the opposite trend, where lots of people play it in the beginning and they leave within months. 
---
IF you don't like playing the game, then you don't have to play it. There is nothing 'OP' and BBQ &amp; Chili, there is nothing OP about self-care, there is nothing OP about balanced landing. If you don't like the meta, you don't have to play it. If you're not having fun playing the game, why play it all?
---
Hmm so she‚Äôs secretly scarecrow. Or she‚Äôs scarecrows mistress I like it!
---
Wasn‚Äôt that the original plan? Weren‚Äôt they both supposed to release tomorrow?
---
Absolutely, takes a little bit of skill but is super fun to play. I think the only downside is the floaty things which kinda give you away in my opinion. Thats why I have the devil skin.
---
That is what I figured, just curious if I was missing another bonus.
---
I have over seventy gruesome gateau offerings on my Ghosty-boi, *my body is ready*.
---
Sure.. I do get that for the most part its not in your control.. but.. you do have the ability to sway the game as you ARE the killer after all. If you get really shit survivors and really care about your pip that much.. make sure you're getting your category's filled. Also with that being said.. you shouldn't really be rewarded for the survivors being bad and doing next to nothing. Like I said.. in the grand scheme of things.. 4 kills doesn't mean jack shit even though there are TONS of killers who think that getting kills is the end all be all. At high ranks getting the 4 kills IS required to still pip, but you wouldn't pip slugging everyone in the first 30 seconds of a match. Another example would be playing in the low ranks.. where you can pip off of killing literally nobody and letting them all go.. as long as you have done enough in the match. Pips are your reward to doing well.. not just getting kills.
---
Tomorrow was supposed to be the release of archives and the event, if I remember correctly.
---
Delete the trash rank system. Split the playerbase into 2 groups: players with less than 500 hours, and players with more. If either group is taking too long to get a game, match them together.
---
If you play him as a stealth killer he‚Äôs literally a better Wraith lol. Imagine if Wraith didn‚Äôt have to decloak first to attack people and that‚Äôs Ghostface.
---
Uh huh.
---
No and it‚Äôs been delayed
---
Nea is ~~a killer~~ a weapon.
---
He‚Äôs just expressing his creative abilities. Your comment is way more cringy then his art.
---
I‚Äôm talking about doing it for other players. It‚Äôs called selflessness, look it up.
---
BHVR moment**
---
when she uses her power she loses the ability to see survivors so she can only see scratch marks and hear moans and breathing. she also has a add on that increases her movement speed while haunting but she can‚Äôt see scratch marks making it all audio based.
---
iron will makes it so you don‚Äôt cry and moan at all so it makes her power much less powerful thus it‚Äôs called her only counterplay
---
The job of the killee is to kill people tho.... kinda says it in the name 'killer'
---
Lmao ok. Why even ask the question if you think you know everything?
---
Sigh...DBD!! I main survivor so I do see this often &amp; can even say I have been guilty of it once or twice in the past. But the reason wasn't lack of skill...dbd is laggy as hell lately, and getting hit by airbender killers is the norm these days. So even when you dodge, you get hit. I have so much footage I rewatch just to see a spirits sword hit thin air, Billy's hammer hit thin air, freddys claw hit thin air and still connect with me or a teammate. 
---
So sometime I think you go in confident because maybe last killer had a good connection, so your flashlight worked properly and you dodged as you hoped to, but then you encounter this new killer get destroyed from missing attacks, based on ping.. and rage, or decide you dont want to bounce around teleporting most of the match.
---
Just one factor of course...sometimes you just weren't gud lol. But yeah funny pic though.
---
Mori‚Äôs are for my 60000 bloodpoints daily ritual
---
I'm aware prestige should take awhile, and it does. But that's the thing, you have to stick to one side if you want to actually get all of the perks in a reasonable time. Theres 19 survivors, that's 57 teachable perks, or 760 character levels. That takes a serious amount of time, and that's for ONE side. It's essentially double that if you want to have them all for killer and survivor. We're talking nearly 1500 levels to have all the perks, and that's if you dont level a single one of them to the cap of 50. It's a pretty rediculous grind my dude
---
Time for a DBD board game now.
---
Those are the worst kind kind kind survivor's.
---
What‚Äôs this about delay?
---
I thought that was the case anyway tbh
---
&gt;Of course they don't want to get hit, but it's obvious that if you drop a pallet and still get hit you've wasted it and should have either not dropped it or dropped it earlier.
---
Then what are we talking about here? Of course a mistake is a mistake. Until survivors get a perk that allows them to go back in time, they can't undo it.
---
You act like people want to do what you're describing, and that isn't the case. Again, no one is out there hoping they get hit when dropping a pallet.
---
Penalties for repeat DCs are to come in the following months, it‚Äôs been confirmed.
---
EDIT: Why the downvotes? This was confirmed in the year 3 livestream lol
---
Yeah I think that would be a good idea, if you manage to see what all ranks use, that would be good knowledge for new players to have
---
Wait, when was the Mid-Chapter out anyway?
---
https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1186390951532605440
---
It honestly cracks me up thinking of that guy's viewpoint. A survivor drops a pallet late and unfortunately tanks a hit, and he's trying to get in their mind and find the angle lol.
---
just close the chat and play how you want. you will feel alot better
---
Still makes no difference because if you do it during a different time, different players will get the *same* bonus. It's called logic, look it up.
---
This is quality content.
---
if you can regularly walk 37m backwards, without looking where you are heading  to a generator and manage to grab off people from it, I will applaud you. Do you happen to know anyone who does this often?
---
There also is premonition, which is admittingly a worse version of SChill, but still works in that case.
---
Just hit 500 hours in the game about 350 of which is killer. I've only ever had maybe 5 games where after people were being genuine assholes. Yeah you get a gg ez pretty frequently but let's be real those people are just trying to be funny or being sarcastic. Most times that I get destroyed I actually end up getting tips from people. Or encouragment to keep practicing. This sub blows up how bad it actually is. It's there for sure but it's not that bad at all
---
Yeah it‚Äôs low player count
---
I thought the mid chapter update WAS the Withering Blight event?
---
F
---
Your ghost face and legion look so similar.
---
Well when does that come out
---
reddit where everything is taken seriously and everyone is better than you apparently
---
 Isn‚Äôt this Twitter meant to be released on the 9th when the original date of the event supposed to be?
---
Yo Canes!!!!
---
Why?
---
So then what do they mean about it being postponed? The Archives are coming out tomorrow, which means the event is too. Am I missing something?
---
I gave up because of this. Killer lobbies take way to long to the point I just quit the game. But before it was pretty much instant .. I get into survivor match's pretty fast tho.
---
He usually is. Babies think it‚Äôs so op they can‚Äôt see him coming. Then they learn that it doesn‚Äôt matter if you see em coming, it‚Äôs about getting away.
---
RIP
---
because i like them based on my appearance.
---
Mcote has a date that day.
---
Wraith is a little anime girl wanting a hug?
---
Yeah, that might help but I dont think so. Instead of meta perks it would just be meta characters.
---
What is the whithering event ? Only the halloween event or the rift and the other things
---
1) 90% of people don't use only 5 perks, you have zero proof of this
---
2) There are other games like it that are worth playing. Identity V is doing extremely well and is dominating the mobile version of 4v1. It's also completely free and can be played on PC if desired.
---
3) Like I said, no ones telling you to stay. If you seriously do not like playing this game, why stick around? Why complain about it? Buddy of mine complained about dota for 4 months straight. I asked him, if you hate this game why play it? He uninstalled it and has been playing other games, we even play Identity V together now. Dude's been happier since
---
Oh it doesn‚Äôt bother me one bit i usually just laugh when I see it. I just want know why plague?
---
Every time you don't play nurse or spirit you get tbagging flashing survivors so you just swap for the next game cus fuck it.
---
where
---
Only thing I'd do is change the music. Then again though this is opinion based, so i dont know how helpful this actually is to you lol
---
Because why not. Let's not leave out the little people.
---
Wow another post bitching about nothing worth hearing.
---
Ok.
---
As a killer I exclusively facecamp survivors only if they sandbag or farm a teammate without BT
---
This genuinely made me burst out laughing. Was not expecting that punchline ngl.
---
I just had a game where I purposefully avoided killing anyone, going for 2 hooks on everybody, but one guy died due to head pop.  Suddenly I'm a tunneller, even though I purposefully left people who would be on death hook all game.
---
Pay no attention to people who call you tunneller if you aren't tunnelling, they're just bad at the game and want it to be your fault.
---
K.
---
No clue man lol. I get called all kinds of weird shit all the time
---
Just seems lazy in its creativity imo. Why not just do multiple fan art of one character, rather than yknow, they both look the same.
---
It's all about applying map pressure. That's why experienced killers don't tunnel or camp
---
Work on gens you sped
---
That's false. I guess you're pretty bad.. welp, can't expect much from ppl like you
---
Yo I'm confused. I think sadly nothing will be there tomorrow and we will have to wait till they actually give the Update, if I get it right.
---
You just got to laugh at that level of delusion.
---
DS is not strictly anti-tunneling with the way it is currently implemented, but it's not always easy to get that benefit from it because there will always be killers who find a way to tunnel. So the tradeoff for tunneling someone with DS is just a 1-minute wait
---
Well i dont care for your opinion i earned that ebony
---
Same reason Chucky can‚Äôt be put in the game..
---
These memes are evolving, I swear we all are apart of something big...
---
Yeah they‚Äôre weird he probably thought u only wanted him when u left the others alive
---
Will they want a video?  I saved the last half.  Did a ticket with the messages they sent me (screenshot)
---
u/Peanits
---
Could we get some clarification on the mid chapter vs the Rift vs the event? There appears to be confusion in this thread, myself included.
---
Sick and relatable flair lmao
---
&gt; reddit where everything is taken seriously
---
why would i not? you were treating it in a seriously manner 
---
&gt; and everyone is better than you apparently
---
oh my god stop being so dramatic
---
If you don't mind me asking, why can't chucky be put in the game?
---
Yes...that is their job smh. That does not.. in any way mean.. you rank up from doing the bare minimum objective. The same can be said about the survivors who complain that they're not piping simply because they did 1-2 gens and escaped because "that's the job of the survivor is to escape." You can do your "job" at literally any rank. Expecting to be rewarded from doing the bare minimum (especially since you're telling me people are killing THEMSELVES on hooks meaning you did even less than the bare minimum and still expect to be rewarded for it) is not realistic or a proper reflection of a rank system. If you only want to get your 4 kills... cool.. do that, and be happy you got a 4k. You can sit at whatever rank you please getting kills as fast as possible. If you want your rank to be a reflection of how good of a killer you are having gone up against better survivors and being able to consistently do well.. then you need to do what is required in order to pip, and that does not mean JUST getting 4 kills in green ranks.
---
Hating myself since the game came out on console. Hell yeah brother
---
Dude please read this, why do you use a addon for no bell sound and a addon which makes it impossible to know from which direction the bell sound comes from at the same time?
---
Yeah but they get more BP at one time instead of less BP at 2 separate times. Would you rather get 25k BP over 2 games or 50k over one? It‚Äôs called basic human knowledge, look it up. Oh and could I also recommend looking up a thing called friends? I mean I doubt the assholes like you in this community who start unneeded fire wars over memes or lighthearted suggestions from other players have seen many of those in your day, cheers!
---
True. Looking back at it I probably shouldn't of wrote that comment. It is good art but I wish people like op would step out of the edgy anime zone and use artistic skills elsewhere. Seeing the same thing a good 20 times makes me stop enjoying it and start to just put my nose up.
---
TL;DR: my bad. Just don't like repition.
---
Maybe this is just a trick? Like we need to go through a trick to get our treat (the event and cosmetics). Wishful thinking but still holding out hope.
---
Just play the game.
---
Killer matches take about 15 min for me... survivor takes about 5 mins too. I feel ya

you are technically correct in that there is a bias on the subreddit in comparison to real worldwide players
---
fucking congratulations you have the goddamn biggest brain on earth
---
that still does not mean that the subreddit is biased against survivor mains which is the point i was arguing against, because the people who make up the subreddit are mostly survivor mains as opposed to killer mains
---
jesus goddamn christ you are insufferable
---
How do urban evasion and fixated interact? does it mean i can crouch walk at a faster speed, or does it only consider your base walk speed?
---
For kbm, so u don't have to use a shitty controller, plus let's be honest even with ps4 players being able to do this, they just aren't as good. Pc players generally have the more experienced players with the exception of a few games.
---
Wait isn't mid-chapter release like tomorrow?
---
If he has Decisive Strike, he is not true baby Dwight. He is toxic Nea wearing skinned baby Dwight's face.
---
Nerfed how?
---
What was the image here? Reddit says it was deleted
---
Well yeah again doesn‚Äôt bother me just want to know why plague. I play a lot of killers and only get tunnelling messages when I‚Äôm plague
---
If we were gonna have a smaller killer my vote is for Sam from Trick R Treat
---
Base walk speed when fully healed only
---
I have TTV in my name and I know it's a target. But it brings in folk to my tiny channel and thus I accept your Mori with grace &lt;3
---
It‚Äôs a blessing to have the Entity right by your side as you go on killing spree.
---
Survivors tend to prioritise generators against Plague, so maybe the broken status plus objective focus gives them the impression you‚Äôre tunnelling as they‚Äôre being more ballsy.
---
I'm so confused...are we not getting the archives tomorrow?
---
Yes!!!
---
that's a bruh moment
---
This is so stupid but hilarious
---
Hex: disappointment
---
I don‚Äôt know they literally always cleansed right after the unhook
---
are you literally 12? you almost only speak in incomprehensible memes
---
EU or US?
---
US Servers
---
In my experience playing both, survivors are wayyyy more toxic than killers, in general. Of course, in my book, the only toxic thing that killers can do to piss me off is camp hooks. It's detrimental to the game as a whole, including themselves.
---
I've had people flame me for teaming because I've let the last person take the hatch if they didnt wiggle after I picked them up lol. People just find reasons to get mad
---
why am I not surprised
---
Maybe include the in-game sound as well
---
Lmao stop using your power like you're supposed to lmao are you trying to have FUN ?!
---
Honestly 40 hours is nothing so i'm not surprised you're struggling to get past rank 10. Rank reset was only a week ago so a lot of good players also might not have had the chance to get out of your games yet. It just takes time to get better at the game is all, although you do need some slowdown.
---
That's fucking amazing. Did you end up killing the Nancy?
---
"This killer says that I shouldn't be a piece of shit and I SHOULD save my teammates because either way I might die, you must be bad"
---
technically not, but the point is rapid and large gains and it does advance that goal
---
It's meant to come out tomorrow which is why everyone is confused. Is the mid-chapter patch delayed as well?
---
so no update tomorrow I guess that is a bummer
---
Uh... he reached Stage 3 in under two minutes.
---
every dbd post by this guy is a joke lmao he literally has no idea what he‚Äôs talking about
---
I am calm. DID IT LOOK LIKE I WAS SCREAMING LIKE THIS? 
---
Stop sucking the BHVR dick. People have a right to be annoyed, excuse me for expressing an opinion and saying something other than ‚ÄúF‚Äù
---
i hate everything
---
But the Mike Wazowski format is not the same as the Tom format in terms of the jokes.
---
Get off your high horse!! ‚ÄúPC players are generally better‚Äù. No, skill is not tied to platform so don‚Äôt hit me with that BS again. This sub is a mess, I‚Äôm outta here
---
Is anyone still surprised at this point ?
---
It seems as though literally everything new is being delayed now.  Not sure why they worded it so unclearly, because 3.3.0 was supposed to come out tomorrow as well.
---
Its beautiful
---
What's dumb is that the dude with the flashlight should have been enough for them to not need that many oaks lol, if he was actually good with it
---
Lmao then the players like me who play both sides equally are sitting over here in the corner.
---
Quite the shocker.
---
i mean u dont know how they look like without a mask, so whats the issue with them looking the same? i mean ghostface can have feminine features or masculine features, that why i like ghostface. because i like to imagine myself as ghostface because of his body size and hes mysterious, i mean if i had myself drawn as michael myers then i could see why it seems wrong, michael is masculine and tall an i am small and twink guy, so i like to imagine myself as ghostface or legion.
---
Yes, it is not. However, using the Tom format will spawn in a bunch of people complaining that its old. Look at how people react when a meme just has the word "nobody" in it
---
I think it was a Pre-op joke for gender reassignment. I may be wrong though üòÇ
---
tbh i was imagining myself being drawn and not an anime character.
---
correct me if I'm wrong but does this mean we're looking at after Halloween......
---
I mean yeah it was logical to assume it (I was 100% sure it was coming out tomorrow) but it still was speculation.
---
Every report is important, that way at a glance they can see a pattern, with the pattern then a physical person can look at the data and pattern and determine if there is an issue then can make a note on the account if it keeps persistening with a singular individual. Then it's the part where yes they paid for this game what actions should we take since they are effecting the game of other paid customers and all that where it's a hard decision to strike down someone
---
It's something about the eye and mouth shape with such a slender figure that just doesnt do it for me, I dunno
---
Console players can you guys 360 well?
---
r/dbdgonegay would like to know your location
---
It's a reference to the skating brand "Thrasher," but they changed it to "Slasher," and put Ghostface on a skateboard.
---
I'm actually wearing this exact shirt today and boy do I love it!
---
its a bug where the rank showed in the scoreboard adds the pip you get to the rank you got at the end of that game
---
You had people on your team feeding him stalk then. Against people that are trying it usually takes more like 4 minutes. Against people that are good you usually don't get it before they escape.
---
Because spirit is now crushing red ranks meta, making solo/duo survivors lives impossible, forcing survivors to take two mid-tier perks to have a small chance at countering her, and is just not interactive. You can have fun mindgaming around a hillbilly chainsaw or huntress hatchet, against a good spirit it's just dumb luck.
---
Also broken crutch add-ons like Prayer Beads or Instadown Hatchets are just ass, a mistake in game design, just like moris or instaheals. Making most killers bad without add-ons and broken with some of them is just not good. Killers should be baseline good, and add-ons there to shake things up and offer gameplay alternatives, not just be a "COWABUNGA" switch.
---
They don't interact at all. Urban Evasion raises your crouch movement speed so that you move 100% while crouched. It doesn't increase it to match what your walking speed 'might' be if it's increased by something like Fixated.
---
When's the mid chapter update? Do we know?
---
&gt;Me, with ~~20~~ ~~620~~ 1,100 hours ingame
---
Yes actually! I have another clip where I kill her literally INCHES from the hatch. I'll link it later tonight after my shift.
---
I‚Äôm sorry.. was a talking to you? Didn‚Äôt think so, have a good one!
---
Exactly!  The game is far more enjoyable and everyone earns more BP if the killer applies constant pressure across all survivors.  Some of my highest BP games have been ones where everyone/3 people survived, but everyone got hit or hooked once/twice and they spent a significant amount of time saving each other, even if I wasn‚Äôt securing kills.
---
Pretty sure it wasn't in last week's. It's been a couple of weeks since it was last in there.    
---
After reading the last bit of your comment, I think you mean Huntress' Lullaby.
---
That ear rape at the end though. But good vid! Thanks
---
I had this happen once, I got hooked and it went to a 3rd person cam of the killer until I was saved. If someone figured out how to do it intentionally it would be so broken for SWF lol
---
Big if true
---
Check their twitter
---
Yes. Video proof is needed sadly. Send it to their email or official forum report section
---
Neat learn something new everyday not much of a skater lives in Canada snows more times then clear weather so never learned always wanted to thoe
---
The only true reason
---
Oh hey I know you, played with you a couple times. You killed me yesterday. Good job, mate!
---
Key words, their goal is to belittle the killer.
---
You seem to have missed the point I was making. I‚Äôm not saying doing them is toxic. By all means do what you have to in chase to avoid hits. 
---
When you are clearly way better than the killer, or have a strong combination of perks and you‚Äôre doing that stuff in front of the killer, knowing that they can‚Äôt touch you, thats what I‚Äôm calling toxic. Worse when you‚Äôre doing it with friends.
---
It is the objectively better game after all.
---
**DEEP GHOSTFACE SIGH**
---
So when?
---
I've always wanted to ask a F13 player this, what do you think about Jason's rage changes?
---
So does this mean no update tomorrow?
---
I've gotten a perfect game off a 3k before, so anything's possible
---
Even better with sole survivor
---
BHVR tweeted about 40 minutes ago that the event is postponed for some unknown reason. They aren't being very clear about why, or when it will actually start at the present moment. We'll have to wait and see.
---
This had me thinking of Left For Dead 2
---
Of course it can happen sometimes, but with that mindset, everything can be done to belittle the killer, if you do it as a Neon Nea at the exit gates. Still, the point is that the vast majority of 360 are done during a chase as a last resort to avoid hits, not really to belittle anyone. 
---
If you get 360'ed during a chase and take it as a personal attack to your ego, maybe you're in a bad mental place at that time and you should take a break to vent some steam, it's never good to hurt yourself playing a game.
---
That‚Äôs what we all thought maybe this is there way of saying the mid chapter patch is delayed
---
I really have no idea what you mean about the 5 perks but, the game gives you Emblem points for doing totems whether they are dull or lit, so they are an objective. Plain and simple. Why would they raise the points awarded to you for breaking a dull totem to 1000 if it wasn't an objective, considering completing one gen by yourself is 1250 points.
---
Even that app knows Herman Carter is black
---
you know you can delete right?
---
Right lol.
---
Link to gif please!
---
I've never seen any of his videos but I see a lot of people talking about this guy lately, can anyone (objectively) explain why he's so hated? I read in another thread he got banned, what caused him to get banned?
---
Hag mori is best mori. Change my mind
---
Lel yeah now image you try to fall off a high place to escape with balanced landing, only for the clown to waste you with the solvent jug add-on so balanced landing dosen't activate
---
Hoes mad
---
How does one farm?
---
So i guess they couldnt fix the array of awful bugs on the PTB. Ah well a few more weeks of insta heals and omegablink yay
---
BBQ and Chili is good for all killers but especially Billy because of his higher mobility.
---
Short answer? No
---
it‚Äôs sad and also dumb how split this community is because of this whole killer mains vs survivor mains shit.
---
‚Äúno you‚Äôre toxic for this no you‚Äôre toxic for that..‚Äù
---
i‚Äôve been playing video games for over a decade and have never seen a community in such a way where they‚Äôre just grabbing at each other‚Äôs throats.
---
isn‚Äôt this supposed to be a game? isn‚Äôt it supposed to be fun? i find people complain about the game so much that they‚Äôre not even having fun anymore.
---
There are a lot of ways to drop a pallet wrong.
---
As an aside, that's not precisely what strawmanning is. Strawmanning is accusing others of making an argument that they aren't making but is easier for you to attack.
---
So is this thread about people using pallets wrong or not?
---
They knew Halloween was coming. Can this company do anything fucking right?
---
Keepsake and stopwatch
---
Ohh... The cycle
---
if it makes you feel any better that is likely why they're delaying it. when I tested it there were game breaking bugs in it
---
I havent played in like a week, but last time I played I would get survivor queues in like 2 minutes and I sat in killer queue for literally 30 minutes without finding a match. My friend I was in discord with that's a killer main was even astonished with how long I was waiting lol.
---
Nope, different things. The fact that Halloween-themed stuff was tied into the Rift led us to believe that the two would be released concurrently, which is where the confusion came in, because when they said the event would start on the 22nd everyone assumed that meant to patch would also be released on that day.
---
corrupt is more consistent and is basicly better if you know how to use it. it gives a moderate success for no risk while ruin is high risk high reward and is there just to punish bad survivor players
---
idk why ppl are down voting you. ill upload a clip of this happening over and over
---
Imagine popping lithe and running down a hallway only to be clipped by a gas cloud that went through the fucking wall. 
---
(The gas itself goes through the wall, not the projectile)
---
I‚Äôm very frustrated myself as I was looking forward to starting the Rift. With it being BHVR they likely won‚Äôt even factor the lost time in and we‚Äôll have a reduced amount of time to actually 100% the Rift too.
---
It‚Äôs a major joke in my opinion when every other game either has it‚Äôs Halloween event or is getting it tomorrow yet ours has been indefinitely delayed.
---
So survivors getting a free stun and heal that the only counter to is dont pick them up for 1 minute isn't op at all? Are you sure about that?
---
Nah, gameplay wise, it is useless. Look at Barbecue and Chili. I would love to have aura reading with it.
---
No mither needs to give extra bloodpoints post trial and have some buffs to be good at high ranks.
---
Freddy X Change is here to snatch these survivors wigs and make them bald honey, no one escapes drag and that's on periodt
---
Better not be a deadite.
---
Hmmm I guess it would be nice to have that as well, as Urban  evasion was changed like that.
---
Wasn't the event coming out with the update anyway?
---
You gave me PTSD flashbacks simply mentioning old legion...  god that was fucking awful
---
Technically the update wasn't needed to start the event, since the serum and skins aren't actually part of the event. None of us realised that until now because of the thematic connections, lack of communication, and the fact that serum and skins were an integral part of the event last year.
---
100% *-*
---
yeah right ?!
---
No they throw the cake in the campfire
---
And I'm not joking either, that's where the offerings are burnt, Our man Benedict tells us I believe in the part his pages about offerings
---
Survivor for me is pretty wuick usually within 2 mins and killer is usually within 5. Not that bad considering people complain of like 20+ mins.
---
Both ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Ah, thanks for letting me know
---
welp lol
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be a joke.
---
Thats what I thought.. Now I'm confused. Is everything being delayed? Or was the event supposed to start before the mid chapter patch?
---
Yeah it was but it was due to start 22nd which is when we expected the patch. With this delay it now means the Hallowed Blight is likely to be much shorter and they‚Äôll likely neglect to increase the time on Rift so we‚Äôll end up with about 65 days to complete a 70 day battle pass. It‚Äôs a real bad joke. 
---
Everytime people are hyped for a patch, like majorly hyped they fuck it somehow.
---
Look how hyped everyone was for Clown and the Store and that was delayed for weeks on end for consoles
---
Only for the most toxic of survivors is it good to it to
---
i have 600 hrs played
---
Stop. Wasting. Time. On. Facecamps. Seriously I cannot tell you how many survivors I get matched with that dont understand the concept of doing gens if they arent actively doing something else.
---
Next Tuesday is 29th. Before Halloween
---
Who are you to tell players what they can get mad at? The stream is to entertain the viewers not to give the opposition an advantage. Why do you think players in e-sports tourneys like Siege's Six Invitationals can't turn around and look at the big screen to see what their opponents are doing?
---
Between me telling you that and now they announced its gonna be delayed to release with the mid chapter (which I thought was already the case) so expect it later I guess
---
And this is the goodest of bois ever to exist
---
Yea, but her father killed her mother and slashed Rin to pieces. Can we really blame her for bearing a white hot grudge against her dad, who brutally ended her and her mother's life? Apart from her now being a raging spirit seeking revenge and all that, it seems like she was a regular, nice gal who would not just go mental on regular people without a real proper reason. Only the entity's corruption would lead her down that road and make her blind to the rules she would have if she was free. Realistically, wife-beaters, infanticidal people and that kinda folks would be viable victims for her hauntings, but that's not the case with our survivors afaik.
---
idk man. i played three matches and double popped as we as didn‚Äôt tunnel or camp or slug. after a unhook i go for the person unhooking
---
Welp, they used the same exact words you used tho
---
Honestly the archives were gonna hold me off till cod...now it wont be coming out till after cod launches looks like I wont be playing it
---
It was a reasonable leap to make, but a leap nonetheless. Technically, the vials have no connection to the event except thematically, so the event and update aren't actually tied together the way we thought, but that wasn't communicated very clearly.
---
It's Mon√©t X Change and she's amazing
---
Summer event cancelled
---
Releases summer cosmetics
---
Halloween event cancelled
---
Releases Halloween cosmetics
---
Yeah fuck this
---
We don‚Äôt know
---
Better nerf pig
---
Ok.. when you get out of rank 20 I'm gonna listen to you. Right now ain't it
---
I'm missing four days this week so this is good news for me, if they push it to the weekend or later.
---
me too !! omg im so fuckin mad
---
Usually when something goes wrong they extend the event so hopefully they'll do the same here. Would be nice to have more than 1 weekend to grind the event anyway
---
The obvious answer to that question, from a beginner's point of view, is yes. It's likely difficult to practice and get your bearings as a killer when a game is over in under five minutes each time. That, or at the very least it probably feels very unfulfilling and most people wouldn't have the patience for waiting five minutes between each five-minute session. 
---
Hyperbolic perhaps, but yeah.
---
Who are you to say what streams people can watch on their second monitor?
---
Easy fix, don‚Äôt run sprint Burst.
---
Don't forget the "optimization patch" for consoles lol
---
Ah yes the "your thoughts disagree with me so you must be the lowest rank" argument. Such class big wow.
---
That's why I said long before now, they are getting reeeaaally greedy lately
---
I always forget what this picture is from. And I have no clue what to google.Haelp!
---
Like they did already. It's very greedy tbh since the base game + dlc ain't free
---
Yup but they never are and can never give a clear answer on shit! Anytime they are doing a stream they always stammer on what to say...
---
LOST Dlc for Dead by Daylight, when ?
---
Never noticed this ...I think this may be a bug or they changed it to basic attacks effect your tokens? Defiantly gonna be running this on Billy and Demigorogon. Wonder if this works on Leatherface as well..
---
Learn and abuse :) thank you!
---
I figured as much
---
You can. Running within 8 meters will make the Face Hugger grab you, but walking and crouch walking will not disturb it.
---
It does, but I wouldn't recommend it on Leatherface since his saw is much easier to connect with than Billy's. If you want a good obsession perk for Bubba run Play With Your Food
---
What a waste of a good cake
---
They announced an optimization patch for console??
---
r/thanksihateit
---
This is actually golden
---
1 minute is quite a long time in game. 1 or two gens if your team is competent
---
People actually play that?
---
It doesnt take away tokens, but you have a good point, even if it did it would still be really powerful
---
At what point in the month does Rank Reset stop bothering people? Like... how many days does it take to even out?
---
Edit: I'm asking for clarity, not to diminish your frustration.
---
Skeet Ahoy
---
Because he's asking about the PIG. A low-mid tier killer. And NOED is good to have when you're (1) starting out and (2) not using top tier killers like Nurse, Freddy, Spirit and Billy.
---
last year they extended the event. they will likely do this again
---
If that was the real reason.. is bs
---
They should prioritize pc and console way more. Even if I play on console I think even get them to pc first is a must, it's where the most passionate and veterans play on
---
Like come on..
---
My advice, spend your time doing something else and comeback to the game tomorrow with a fresh positive mind set. Each loss is only going to aggravate you more and more.
---
it‚Äôs been a good week since rank rest. i‚Äôm in purple ranks too, so it‚Äôs not a rank 20-15 problem.
---
Leatherface‚Äôs cries when using his Chainsaw always shake me up when going against him. He‚Äôs the scariest to me. Along with that, being hit over the head by a sledgehammer with full force would sure not feel great
---
Exactlty. It helps with tunneling in that respect, but that's also enough time for a killer to win a chase with an entirely different survivor and hook them, only to get struck by a guy who was rescued before you started the other chase. I would like to argue that this isn't tunneling
---
All of a sudden? She‚Äôs one of the killers to get bitched about 20 times a week maybe even more.
---
Not anymore
---
r/shapepalletstun
---
Yeah this year the Halloween event is just the hook and generator skins. The actual stuff you need to unlock the Cosmetics is in the Rift
---
Entuh the wohld -doors swing open- of *TOXIC SUHVIEVUHS*
---
Dont be fooled by the badass beard. Angrypug has big gay lolol
---
Aw man, I did not know about the delay, I was looking forward to waiting forever in killer queue after I come home from work and then pop some pustulas as a survivor out of bordom.
---
But the Midchapter patch is right around the corner, isn't it ? ISN'T IT ???!?!
---
They are probably delayed due to the mobile app and the cash cow that mobile apps bring.  We as loyal fans are being ignored at the moment
---
Survivor queues are way longer than killer queues atm
---
We got bhvred again. Shouldn't be surprising but it always let you down
---
I mean who uses SB?
---
And also, Exhaustion gets reset when you're hooked
---
I was counting down the days. This sucks.
---
They were on PC for a bit, and they were really.. really... really bad. Trust me, you don‚Äôt want it right now lol
---
I... apparently my post isn‚Äôt a joke
---
I'm actually super bummed about this. I was just thinking earlier how lucky I was to have the next couple of days off from work to enjoy everything, since that usually doesn't happen. As much as I love the devs, it seems like something almost always disappoints.
---
Disappointed but not surprised.
---
My dissapointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
---
Just a little bit.
---
Me too. We got BHVRed again
---
By all of a sudden i mean the past few months
---
LOL you're team isn't entitled to the unhook either moron. And at no point did I specify how many people were left. Imma get that lean stock daily and you're inability to understand the flow of the match from the killers PoV isn't going to change that.
---
Killers really think we can guess they will give us the hatch just because? Lol
---
They cant even release a Halloween event without issue. A HALLOWEEN EVENT their prime time after following new player wave after the Stranger Things chapter. You really think anything they do is going to be up to standard? I love this game but holy shit.
---
Mom come pick me up I‚Äôm scared
---
Use ur lunge to break pallets, charge ur lunge to scare survivors to not jump pallets and windows
---
On console sometimes we get random frame drops so you'd be surprised how awful it gets if you get a frame drop in the middle of charging your chainsaw with him. Any idea if it works with huntress ?
---
Half the variants have the killer shack right next to the house of pain. And the long unbroken fences make some of them overly-safe, hard to navigate maps.
---
Ever since Spirit was dropped survivors complain from then all the way up till now. 
---
Any killer that can do pretty fucking well is complained about. 
---
Any killer that is annoying is complained about. 
---
Every killer that sucks gets harassed by survivors knowing that‚Äôs a weak killer lol.
---
My thoughts exactly! If people would stop buying their shit, cut the money train off and we tell them no more until the game is fixed! Then we will buy their shit again. But the way it looks is they just want your money and nothing else!
---
Yeah check the dbd Twitter
---
It is. No one seems to know what's going on.
---
Very true - https://www.facebook.com/911435018905071/posts/2508559189192638?sfns=mo
---
While this might be a bit biased, I‚Äôve never really thought of nurse as being horrible to play against. I am a pretty strong killer main, but the thing with nurse is that it‚Äôs so hard to get good at her that when you actually start doing well, you‚Äôve deserved it for suffering through the steep skill climb of playing nurse. Of course now with her nerf id honesty just put her under spirit since there‚Äôs almost no payoff for suffering through, so that‚Äôs great
---
Welp, if you look around people are so excited about the battle pass.. which btw is a system that almost only f2p uses (if not only them)
---
Plus you can buy progress on it since you have to play constantly to reach the last point. Which is around 2h per day for 1 month if I'm not wrong. That's on pbe only. They can easily make the grind heavier and it still a predatory tactic to implement that..
---
I mean, at this point make it f2p. For how many things you can buy with auric cells only, dlc (which means perks) included, is insane and looks like a f2p already
---
The problem is, people will buy these things regardless and not be critical of them. I love DbD, but that's the reason why I'm super critical to them. Because I wanna see it bloom, not die
---
Yeah, now that I think about it, Nelson would be a better pick
---
It won't, it's been postponed to a later date, but no official day has been given yet.
---
Well that's just ruined my day.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
How are these devs so bad to not only have the most unbalanced game I have ever seen, but also not even be able to properly do a halloween event in their horror game?
---
It‚Äôs not a surprise, the only people on the team that do their job well and on time are the ones that develop the new outfits, and that‚Äôs only because Bhvr makes money off it
---
Yup can confirm
---
This may push me to drop the game honestly. I‚Äôm sick of them promising dates only to push shit back. They need to make the first Premium Pass free in my opinion. That‚Äôll alleviate all the disappointment from delaying their entire trashy Halloween event. 
---
I also wish people would stop fucking complaining the events are trash because whenever they try something different all anyone does is complain
---
But what if the entity market crashes? How will we get our items?
---
Feels bad man..
---
Buuut at least you can buy the cosmetics without the event anyway!!!..
---
God damn it.. they are getting worse than EA at this point
---
Ring of Fire interesting. Seems kind of like a trapper style of play. 
---
It could black off some loops and it could also be used to get a survivor away from the loop they are on.
---
Perk 1. Is already a perk.
---
Perk 2. Horrible right off the bat, but you knew that. I just don‚Äôt like the idea of a useless perk like this.
---
Perk 2&amp;3 shouldn‚Äôt be a have to combo together that just sucks in general. Also tokens aren‚Äôt specified but I know what you meant.
---
Perk 3. Is also like Noed......
---
It does work with Huntress as well. PS I also main Leatherface on console
---
should eat some headache pills
---
*and imma piss on these walls!*
---
Pig's dash also doesn't remove stacks. It's an intentional design choice.
---
Like I said, it's a one time use and I don't know if it's just me, but a 4 second stun is rarely enough time for a survivor to escape me, so, again I don't mind it. I usually just down the person again, and have maybe wasted 30 seconds to a minute in the process. Sure, sometimes they get away after using DS, in which case, good on them, I was slipping and didn't manage to find them. Only time it's real strong is when exit gates/hatch is open and the person needs to escape, but that's exceedingly rare.
---
Don't ask.
---
A Leatherface main is quite rare to see. Nice didn't know any of this might run it from now on with killers with secondary attacks.
---
Why do I still get splinters for Pig and Freddy even though I have both killers? Is this normal? I got them alone instead of getting the full dlc as I have no interest in Tapp and Quentin I don't know if that changes anything
---
Honestly I just use my boi wraith and tunnel hard hook them let them get released and rinse and repeat
---
I hate joining a lobby solo and seeing 2 rank 20‚Äôs and a rank 5
---
I mean, people should be able to play with their friends if they want to.
---
I think you missed the point of the meme
---
Keep in mind that any perk needs to be usable by all the other killers.
---
*Yaaaaas bitch*
---
Thank god something that hasnt been done 20 million times is getting upvoted. Oh dont forget to take mine too
---
Boo fucking hoo!
---
Who said I found it offensive? It‚Äôs just unfunny
---
I knew shred and ambush didnt gain/lose tokens didnt know about the chainsaws though
---
That doesn‚Äôt make sense. Who would want to watch a stream where all they do is work on gens? That sounds super boring.
---
Because Archives and cosmetics take the same amount of work to do.
---
&gt; Your friend is 19 for a reason
---
Rank reset because the group played other games for a while, waiting for dedicated servers and events?
---
I'd combine Firebrand and End the Pain. Usually the way to get tokens is within the perk itself. 
---
Pretty cool idea for a killer though. Out of curiosity, could survivors dead hard over burnt patches without harm?
---
The new patch won't affect spine chill (love spine chill btw it's sooo underrated, I mean there are better perks to run, but it's a good perk and one of my favorites) however, object of obsession is taking a hefty nerf by making 4 killers immune to it's effect to some degree.
---
In actuality, maybe OoO isn't being nerfed as hard as one may think. If say a wraith gets into a chase and a survivor with OoO sees the wraiths aura in a breaking or vaulting animation, it's a good indicator that the killer is in a chase and said survivor can work on gens for the time being.
---
I mean, if you play well and work with your team games get interesting. But some streamers feel they are unfairly targeted or just salty in general
---
Bingo.
---
This post was so wholesome but you are an asshole
---
I think that's what we are looking at sadly. Can you personally remember the last time we got main patch like 3.0.0 3.1.0 etc on a day other than a Tuesday?
---
I think you'd have to go further back than Clown. (2.0.0) 
---
I'd be shocked if its not the 29th now.
---
On the other hand doing cosmetics is very very easy to do and almost bug-free. And it doesn't involve the same people so if they stop doing cosmetics we won't get the archives faster (archives being programmers / game designers / UI designers and cosmectics being artists)
---
Damn, is that a hillbilly weapon? Looks good

---
Might be something that wasn't implemented in the game. There are files that exist that haven't reached the game (yet, who knows, maybe it'll show up at some point.)
---
Say sike right now
---
1. I was referring specifically to rate of 4 kill games vs. not 4 kill games and how the ratio changes dramatically as you increase in ranks but that is a good point, though you will most certainly earn less bloodpoints on average in games where no escapes, as a survivor.  But I feel that everyone dying 4/5 games at very low ranks is more of a 'feels bad' issue, and less of a strict bloodpoint issue.
---
2. It's not impossible, but it's the first time I have ever had to look at my 3 dailies and calculate how many games I would have to play to earn it, how many bloodpoints I would lose playing like garbage, and whether I would gain overall bloodpoints by completing the daily.  That's a very unusual decision for a daily - dailies are supposed to be no brainers in most games, but due to the requirements of the daily and the fact you earn a comparable amount of BP anyway, it's not always efficient to go for them when learning the game (when you really need those BP to not suck).  For instance - I have open an exit gate with BIll for 30k BP.  This is absolutely not worth the risk at my experience level.  I only pull a switch maybe 1/8 games as it is with my lvl 40 Nancy, after running about 10 games with level 1 Bill I was still at 0/1 completion for the daily and had probably lost 3-5k BP per game because I am running a single perk.  The solution is to spend the BP to rank everyone up to 15, but the BP investment in that for every character would take a really long time to pay for itself.  I would imagine months, probably longer.
---
3. Yeah.
---
4. It's not as hard as you might think to implement them.  I'm not talking rank 1 killer/survivor ai's, but I honestly don't think it would be that tricky to make a not absolutely terrible killer/survivor ai.  An AI that can fairly and accurately chase you with a little bit of juking/unpredictability mixed in with some map knowledge to help it play more efficiently.  I feel for someone like me it would be a pretty nice tool.  Especially if I could run loops with it for hours on end until I get a really good feel for the chase without the extreme pressure and all/nothing nature of in-game chases.  Yeah there would be a bit of a rude awakening when I bring my play back into higher ranked play, but at low level play it would help some people make that difficult jump from absolutely sucking to ... sort of sucking.
---
"Suggestion"
---
It's likely that the person you were watching edited the perk icon files, so it could be anything. It's not difficult to change the icons.
---
Archives is a much bigger project, but my comment was due to the fact that even with a large number of people working on something, the only thing we as players can count on is that they will release content they can make money off of more reliably then anything else they have done, which has been proven time and time again
---
I always thought that every blood you spill in the trial it converts into blood points so like if you have 2999 and want a brown kit you can just get a paper cut and get it lol
---
ThAt wAS aCtUalLy a JojO rEfFerrEncE
---
Ugh I don't even wanna remember that huge delay. Never again
---
What video was it from? could find context clues from there.
---
„Ç¥„Ç¥„Ç¥„Ç¥
---
What would you suggest he do then? In all honesty. You want him to just let you get the unhook and save? If the exit gate are open all bets are off. No mercy if you get caught during that time.
---
They are on for PC atm
---
While I agree on some level, you need to realize something. If they are level 19 there are two very likely factors:
---
- They stopped playing the game a while ago and this derank Ed all the way back down over time off the game and are only just now coming back to it. 
---
- They just got the game and haven‚Äôt played before but want to play with friends.
---
The latter is the most likely, and in that case they are likely teaching the person how to play by giving them a little support. That being said, just because the higher rank/more experienced people are there doesn‚Äôt mean they will all do well. It‚Äôs annoying but if they actually for real fixed the match making so it would do what they claim it‚Äôs supposed to, it wouldn‚Äôt be an issue for the killer. The rank 19 will usually always die u til they get better anyways. Most of the time anyways. In fact there h e been a lot of instance where I and my other higher rank friends have gotten ourselves killed trying to protect our newbie friend.
---
It's good on all killers with Secondary Attacks besides Leatherface lol. It's especially good on Billy and Demogorgon. Not sure if it works with Legion's frenzy though
---
BHVR is going to make money off the archives, there‚Äôs no doubt about it. 
---
Listen, shit happens. We all saw the bugs on the PTB, no one wins if they push that to live servers. Just because things make BHVR money doesn‚Äôt mean that it has total priority over everything else.
---
The game is 3 years old if the battlepass allows it to last longer I'm all for it. Especially since you get your money back at the end and that it's only cosmetic.
---
Shred does not apply OnHit effects from perks like Sloppy Butcher etc. M1 attacks, but it also does not take away stacks from Save The Best For Last if you hit the obsession.
---
If you don't want people to join in on the conversation, maybe you shouldn't comment on a public platform. :)
---
People edit their game files so different icons appear differently. usually people just change the color but in some cases they change the icon to look different. considering this is a picture slug I'm guessing its something like deer stalker or knock out
---
But it is a fair assumption, on the website for the archives it says tome II will launch several weeks after the archives and that was planned to launch November 5 so it makes sense if the archives came out this week or the next.
---
Ghostface is strong because his ability hides the red stain in loops, and it only takes a few seconds to stalk to get people exposed while stalking.  
---
Plague is weak because people know not to use her cleansing pools, which makes her a generic M1 killer, even if the survivors get the broken status.
---
I guess I'd recommend Freddy just because he's extremely strong, his snares are disgustingly strong, even though it's extremely unfun to vers.
---
Rank doesn't show skill anyway, been paired with so many low ranks who have been great. Some people just gotta give them a chance rather than assuming
---
So what you're tell me is that this game is biased towards women?
---
If it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that bhvr has a history of continuously doing this every other time there is supposed to be something new released, yet almost always has a stream of cosmetics being released every other week, then I‚Äôd be more understanding. And yes, I know the difficulty isn‚Äôt comparable between the two, but when all you see getting released on time is cosmetics since they started doing the in-game store, then you start to not care. But  I guess that‚Äôs just them doing a ‚Äúpretty good job so far‚Äù
---
Can we remember that this is a business and shit happens, and to be mature about it instead of whining?  I had the day off too and while I'm disappointed, I understand unforeseen circumstances.
---
Does double bp start tomorrow as I heard some people talking about it?
---
Freddeh
---
Hitboxes are still the same, what are you talking about?
---
P3 Claudettes are quaking
---
You don't tho. Its a fake currency dude. They already took your money
---
by giving you a way to get again that fake currency isn't a biggie. 1) because you have no idea how much grind you have to do before getting those cells back 2) you'll eventually spend it to A cosmetics or B get more progress on the battle pass which leads to buy more cells and at the same time defend the system EXACTLY how you are doing right now and FEEL acceptable for a paid game that you have paid 100$+ to play including CORE game and DLC
---
I'm saying that not out of spite but because I'm worried. I already spent a lot to have every chapter except 1 and they just keep adding things you can buy with cells alone.. it feels so f2p right now and they are getting too greedy tbh
---
Pop goes the weasel is really good since you can teleport to gens.
---
BBQ is always good but this will help you find out which gen is being worked on so you know which one to teleport to and kick with pop.
---
Make your choice is also good, Hook someone near a gen and then teleport back to it when they are saved and the rescuer will have to avoid being hit for a full minute.
---
It sucks, but they have to keep the lights on. Bug Fixes don't bring in money, Bug Fixes don't generate any income. It's a problem with the business model, not BHVR. Well. Up to a point.
---
So some opinions are decent but the best perk for not being chased by a killer is Alert 100%. Spine chill is good to have as well but Alert will constantly show you the killers location and you can move around gens staying far away from the killer. If you are below rank 12 I suggest Distortion because 9/10 killers will have BBQ n ChIli so he will not see you working far away on gens. You dont want all stealth perks so pick ones that you like most and use other perk combos too
---
ZA WARUDO! *tier 3 noises*
---
I wouldn't really consider multiple no mithers full sweat but to each their own.
---
Ok this helps! Thank you.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you can‚Äôt possibly get a 4K with a negative pip. But do take note; it says ‚ÄúHOW TO WIN‚Äù, not ‚ÄúHOW TO MERCILESSLY SLAUGHTER ALL THE SURVIVORS FOR A DOUBLE PIP‚Äù. If your idea of winning is just a 4K then you do that. If your idea of winning is getting a double pip, then try harder to get those iridescent emblems. I don‚Äôt really give a fuck about the rank system personally, I just play for fun and use dumb perk builds. For me, having fun as a killer or survivor is winning.
---
Now I understand why people hate on the devs. This level of communication.. a day before the event is supposed to start. There has really been a lack of events this year as it is.
---
I mean one of them brought an oak and a pink key with 2 purple addons, sooooo
---
To be fair, it's not the result that mattered, it's the gameplay. Viewers are not there to watch you walk out of the exit gate, they want to watch the meat and potatoes of the **match**. But you're still a complete noob so I'm not saying that you **should** know what to do, just telling you where your priorities should be.
---
Don't count escaping to be good content. If you do some great plays during the match, that's **so much better** \- and I'm saying that for the long run, especially once you get better. For now, just keep playing the game.
---
(For example, you can literally just crouch around and hide in lockers without getting in a single chase with the killer and get an escape out of it. This is very boring and slow to watch.)
---
Oh yeah, absolutely. The fact that the mid-chapter patch was due to be released around the same time anyway certainly amplified the confusion.
---
I don't think so. Knock Out is a perk you'd use when you're slugging, but at the time period OP is referencing, I don't think LF existed in game yet. (Edit: for reference, here's a [link](https://youtu.be/wV-0pZVfXHI?t=179) to a video with a clip of someone with the slug perk. The perk arrangement is the old one. I have no idea when it was updated, though.)
---
Now just pull 4 people off a hook and you'll double it!
---
My boy has some serious stamina
---
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
---
In addition to what 5pideypool said, if the game actually allowed "playing with your food", people might actually do that more. As is, any good team will slam gens into the ground if you don't kill them fast enough.
---
Looks like the doctor owns dunkos channel
---
okay, that works then
---
Well, they shouldn‚Äôt have to run them, but until BHVR decides to finally start buffing the perks that are supposed to compete with them, theyll never have a reason to not run Adrena/DH/Decisive
---
They said they never announced w Blood Hunt so I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre actually getting one
---
Halloween event in November.
---
Oh my face is leaking again
---
Yeah but them being in the store isn‚Äôt the event
---
Nah theirs comes out all slimy
---
Every second matters as killer, and waiting out Decisive might mean that survivor will get healed while you‚Äôre doing something else to wait out the decisve, and then you‚Äôre off to the races hunting them down again.
---
Monitor and Abuse doesn't work on Freddy or Huntress lullaby, this is a known fact. Freddy's lullaby however only effects survivors in the dream world. Outside of the dream world survivors are subject to the normal killer terror radius in which monitor and abuse still applies regardless of the killer.
---
I would hope that they would keep the event the same length, even if it starts later. As for the vials and such, it's true that you need them to unlock the Halloween-themed skins, and last year the serum and vials were part of the event, but this year they're a separate thing - the event is just the pustula petals and special generators/hooks which give bonus bloodpoints. That's what I meant about the skins and vials having no connection to the event except thematically.
---
Shit does happen but it shouldn‚Äôt be happening every single time like this. I‚Äôm not gonna make any excuses for BHVR. They could have at least announced this earlier
---
The lack of warning and fear of the penalties of getting infected is meant to slow survivor movement around the map, slowing the game down off of the threat alone.
---
Better than Myers or GF? You're out of your mind.
---
Depends who you play more. I bought several killers with shards as their power is different while survivors are mostly just perks.
---
Also take into account owning the DLC usually has an alternative cosmetic for the survivor. Ace has a Tuxedo, Feng Min has a weird jacket/sweater thing, Tapp has a black jacket and hatless cosmetic, etc. although lately the "Extra cosmetic" is usually just a recolored shirt.
---
Socks with sandals in 2019.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm not even gonna try to think of a counter argument anymore, let‚Äôs just go ahead and agree that the game has a shit ton of flaws. I‚Äôve never actually been in support of the pip system, I‚Äôm just trying to put myself in its shoes. Figure out how it feels getting shat on all the time. It does deserve the large majority of that shit, though.
---
Hey pig main here. I usually run discordance, surveillance, hex:huntresses lullaby, and rancor. It let's you put a lot of pressure on gens and keeps survivors separated. Plus rancor helps alot with the chases.if you have them create of gears and the tempered timers are good. Forces survivors to check boxes faster and gives you more time to locate them.
---
Thanks for the help. I'm surprised freddy isn't a meme anymore.
---
Trust me. It doesn't matter.
---
It is for the best. It is always better to get something a bit more polished released than buggy.
---
All the more reason to run Franklin's.
---
where do you live that Fall extends to 2020? Fall ends on Dec 22nd
---
Generally it's to the right of the wall and you can moonwalk or stand still at a corner and hide your red glow by looking away to fool them. Hiding the red glow is a 50/50. Going to the right will eventually get them not unless they have a nearby pallet, shack, or another double t-wall. 
---
Otherwise you run killers that can counter looping like Freddy, Nurse, Spirit, and Hag. Or just go "Fuck it." And equip Bamboozle.
---
Lovely.
---
Billy's new mace.
---
Except odds are it will still be buggy even after they delay it.
---
I recently started playing demo as well! One of my favorite things that I do as demo is that if there is a survivor running in a straight line, charge up shred and bait them into turning left or right, then just M1 them :D
---
Thanx I‚Äôll keep that in mind

If you play trapper and you grab people out of traps you are losing emblem points for chasing them and hitting them.
---
So try to smack them with your cleaver when they are stuck in the trap. Chase them around a bit if possible and THEN smack them. Or herd them into your traps.
---
If they just blindly stumble into your traps, you won't get many chaser points, but you can at least hit them once (still missing the second hit "Normal" M1 killers get).
---
Try playing legion, if survivors group up, and you just smack them in Frenzy over and over again, you can pip with just one sacrifice in green ranks.
---
I got a survivor to Dc by doing that:D
---
I would assume not since it is if the Killer looks at you.
---
You've got some issues you need to figure out before you start pointing fingers at people mate.
---
Depending on rank I expect rank 10 to rank 1 killers will have ruin 90% of the time and have BBQ n Chili 99% of the time. Rank 20 to rank 10 will have like a 20% ruin build and 60% use NOED. So if u just stay at a low rank you won't deal with Ruin as much but likely gonna have more NOED killers
---
No problem
---
I mean... naturally as with any game and their update releases; bugs will always come forth. I think the point here is that they are delaying it for a reason and people while annoyed (myself included) know it is for the best.
---
Itll probably some how be even worse lol
---
Unironically been running this a bit and it's disgusting when it works, and that's with one player doing it. If you find a nice spot and can keep the 3 or so hooks in reach down you are immortal.
---
Oh, I forgot, it also works the other way around.
---
If you want to stack up STBFL, you need to M1 them.
---
Why are you booing he's right?

But unlocking vials in the rift isn't the only way to get the cosmetics, is my point.
---
cute
---
Or you could just 99 the gate and open after he hooks the person.
---
nice

I assume he was just doing for a laugh tbh. I thought it was kinda funny.

Shit happens constantly with them. Don't excuse incompetence
---
Stay with team and follow him so you can break him free for your team. If you break him free from far away you have a lot of head start to run away
---
The issue with that though is it's Freddy.  You're going to spend the overwhelming majority of the time asleep since every hit puts you in it as well as the fact even if you waste the time waking up constantly the timer is automatically going to resleep your ass anyways.  He's a crazy gen pressure killer so most solid to good survivors are going to spend their time repairing gens against him whenever possible.  Regardless if it works that 25% of the time you might happen to be awake it still wouldn't be part of anyones "optimal" Freddy build.
---
It can't be, otherwise it would have never been postponed, as that was the original date.
---
OG Freddy had some wacky builds (Tiny TR, extreme slowdown, ignore obsession all game instagib with rancor, endgame, etc.) but the new one has a few interesting perk synergies. 
---
Since he can teleport directly to generators, BBQ and Pop is excellent as you can hook someone, see which generator is being worked on with BBQ, teleport to it and scare the survivor off, then kick it with Pop to regress it.
---
That leaves two extra perk slots. I personally use the fake pallet addons often so I use Enduring + Spirit Fury and simply swing through every pallet not caring if I get stunned. (Heck with OG Freddy I never used Enduring + Spirit Fury and still didn't care about pallets.)
---
There's also a build called "Forever Freddy" which is Freddy with Swing Chains, Jump Rope/Red Paint Brush, and slowdown perks like Thanatophobia, Ruin, Dying Light, etc. 
---
Nurse's Calling might be good on him too.
---
It is almost like that person had the huge reply ready to copy and paste and he/she was going to use it no matter what anyone said.
---
&gt;Every report is important, that way at a glance they can see a pattern, with the pattern then a physical person can look at the data and pattern and determine if there is an issue then can make a note on the account if it keeps persistening with a singular individual. Then it's the part where yes they paid for this game what actions should we take since they are effecting the game of other paid customers and all that where it's a hard decision to strike down someone
---
Except you aren't supposed to report people DCing, devs literally asked this because the tickets are immediately discarded since the system that bans disconnecters is automated.

Makes you wonder how poorly ran Behaviour must be to delay simply turning on double BP and enabling some cosmetics to the hooks/gens?

INB4 white knights appear "Behaviour is the greatest developer ever! They never make mistakes! They've balanced the game! YOU SHOULD BE THANKFUL AND STOP CRITICIZING SOMETHING YOU'VE PAID FOR!"

Facts:

Behaviour is staffed with 500 employees, made more than 20 million last year, and is the #1 indie dev in Canada. This isn't a tiny little company staffed by a handful of people who don't have two nickles to themselves. How they are utilizing these 500 employees is anyone's guess.
---
I heard Montreal game development is kind of a shitshow with there being a problem with cohesiveness. Namely, people work on whatever so there could be a game-crippling bug but a guy is working on getting the shadows right first. We've seen shit like this in DbD.

Stop supporting this corrupt subreddit. The owner only cares about getting clout by advertising his subreddit everywhere possible and then removes any criticism given. He also watermarks other people's content without credit often

no ETA for the mid-chapter patch was officially released by BHVR though.
---
Who not?

With that comparison, I can see him playing the doctor in any live action adaption

That's correct, I'm just saying that it's not tomorrow. We know that much at least.

---
Her pig mask is dehydrated. Actually, it might not even be a real pig head. It could just be an elaborate mask. So either way, no blood coming from the mask itself.
---
Her power can be used effectively in a chase, and most survivors can't wrap their head around the idea of that so they think that she's completely unreasonably broken.

I seriously don't know why I always get my hopes up with events when it comes to BHVR handling them, it looks like i'll be playing other games on Halloween.

Haha awesomeb
---
I definitely disagree that "adrenaline" rewards you for playing poorly. But NoED definitely rewards killers for playing poorly.
---
Here's my argument
---
Adrenaline procs after survivor do all 5 gens and NoED procs while the killer is 100% losing
---
Its what I equip ASAP if I notice survivors carrying flashlights in lobby.
---
Yeah, man, if you like him, no problem. If someone's gonna bash you for liking a streamer, screw that person. You watch what you want to watch.
---
That would have to do with the archives, not the rift. And no, I'm not worried.
---
The problem is mainly due to poor totem placements and the fact that they can literally spawn next to gens. Also we wouldn't even need Ruin if the Devs would actually fix the core issues which I doubt they'll ever do.
---
I love the accent. NGL
---
Thanks lmao
---
Nope bad list, SS should be Jane and Nancy then Kate is S tier with Laurie
---
Yep! Its in my flex slot. Off if they aren't carrying boxes/lights. On if they do. Downed items make for juicy bait. Hag approved.
---
Nah, when you have bugged game, you work harder and have a more competent management so it doesnt happen again, not delay updates after updates.

A reasonable person

Dang if you burned that as an offering it'd give you like 1000x bloodpoints!

I'm not saying he's bad at the game nor am I saying that he deserves the hate. Nobody deserves that. But if you pass off judgment to others and complain that they're not playing 'optimal', then you have to be willing to have people point out your flaws as well and to take it in stride. This goes for anyone, including myself.
---
I hope they put out the update when its ready then instead of waiting until next Tuesday.. I was actually kinda hyped for tomorrow.
---
Notice how I'm talking about the *update* and not the *event*? People have been confused about this, so I'm clarifying that *both* won't be coming tomorrow. You tried though I guess.
---
I will do gens while you get facecamped.

She‚Äôs boring to go against and I personally find no amusement playing against her. I‚Äôd play against any other killer except her
---
Found the Spirit main

Plus probably balancing, since if they didn't then they'd have to make pipping harder or everyone would be rank 1 within a couple months making ranking meaningless. Plus if someone took a break then came back, they'd just be shat on by people who kept playing the game until they deranked enough that they were facing newer players anyways.
---
Losing is depipping. Tying is safety-pipping. Winning is pipping. Stomping is double-pipping.
---
Tell me, if you kill every survivor, completing your literal only objective flawlessly, and didn't win by game standards, what should you logically do better? You have to game the system, which is stupid. Stat-padding removes the immersion from the game.
---
Yeah and most survivor offerings do far less
---
What is everyone's beginning game strategy? I normally find the nearest gen, I then hide near it until the killer loops it or a few seconds have gone by and I'm sure he's not coming and then start on it. I have dark sense so once I finish the gen I usually try to head in the opposite direction of the killer, find a gen, and start the process over again. Is there a better strategy to use?
---
Can't get face camped if there are no hooks *taps forehead*
---
Pretty sure there was only like 1 or 2 random posts in the past month or 2 saying something about nerfing spirit...

The fact of the matter is, if you show your consumer you don‚Äôt care about making sure your product works, the consumer will take their business elsewhere. This is extremely true in video games. 
---
While I understand that is their primary income source, it won‚Äôt matter if the game is bugged to all hell and unplayable. By the time they realize this the game will be dead already and everyone will have quit. I‚Äôve seen it happen to so many games and developers because the fail to see the bigger picture. If they can‚Äôt handle keeping the lights on, stop taking on licensed dlc. The majority of the community is asking for original characters anyways and we would rather wait a little longer for dlc if it meant that game health was finally getting attention. They set unrealistic goals for dlc releases and now refuse to pull back on it to focus on the bigger picture. With their current logic and at this rate, the game won‚Äôt last another year.
---
Honestly, I used to spend soooo much time on these forums and clocked 1400 console hours. Now I‚Äôve switched to PC and have around 300 hours on PC but I haven‚Äôt played in like a month. It just hasn‚Äôt grabbed my interest.
---
And with stuff like this, I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm kinda ‚Äúmoving on‚Äù. I mean, shit, I used to make a DBD meme every couple days.
---
Damn, could've at least let them get one gen then slaughter them lmao

Yes, I never said she took much skill. I realize that there are some people that abuse Prayer Beads, Stridor, and Tinkerer and just gen snipe. My point is that she‚Äôs not over powered.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be better for them to keep the bugs in the PTB and they postpone it to work on them than them releasing a really buggy ass chapter?
---
Maybe it's because I'm super new to this game but I find stuff like this...fun? Like, isn't that the point of the game? The back and forth between the killer and survivors?
---
I'm like uh oh c: u caught me c: woah, here we go haha c: 
---
People should learn to have fun in games more. It doesn't have to be so serious all the time.
---
Storm enjoys.
---
:( should try surv again since u already know how to play xD
---
Custom icon 72Hours used to use a lot
---
It‚Äôs getting bad. It‚Äôs a large reason I stopped playing.
---
\*finds hatch, breaks extra pallets, uses killer power\*

\*inadvertently helps killer get extra BP\*
---
Haha Ye I like it more than lis
---
ikr ugh better than lis imo

There's a saying that the best swordsman in the world doesn't have to worry about the second best swordsman in the world, but the complete amatuer because he will do things that nobody will predict or something like that.
---
Reminds me of tactical FPS games like Counter Strike or Rainbow Six where it's the newer players you have to worry about because they stand in completely nonsensical spots or use eccentric strategies.
---
Yeet xD I‚Äôm not gonna do it
---
I think there‚Äôs a bug. I had a totem on swamp I couldn‚Äôt cleanse. It was by a tree and it wasn‚Äôt blocked by its surroundings so not sure why it was having issues promoting the action. I‚Äôve also noticed this issue with exit games sometimes.

thats acutally a good idea

I hardly ever disconnect but I can understand why people do it, I'm what you call a casual player but I love the game so much.  Recently I got a couple of friends to buy the game on ps4. It takes you about 10 minutes to start a match as survivors, as soon as we start you can tell we are outmatched and we get killed immediately.  It's infuriating.  Then you wait another five 6 minutes for the second match and you think the killer is a nice killer play leading you to generators and what not, but honestly there just trying to stalk you for points.  Then in the third match you have a pretty new killer obviously that decides to hang one of the players and stand there so you cant pull them down.  All I know you waste about an hour and a half if not more and you're left irritated.
---
Me. Everytime I do a good job distracting the killer I have a pathetic team that maybe does half a gen.
---
No clue at all why the killer would stick to the downed person in those circumstances, but it's really their own fault if they didn't want to look for you. Heck, worst case, do wide sweeps, and when the downed survivor gets picked up, you know where both survivors are. It's not your fault that the killer played poorly.
---
im not too much on nerfing it. just changing it so that the conditons are acutally when your being tunneled
---
Honestly i catch myself doing this too often lol hence the meme.
---
What do you think is overpowered?
---

---
...I wanna eat it.
---
IK it just screws the team over.
---
Are you new? This is not toxic, people do this to give the killer extra points.
---
&gt;when disguised you lose your TR, walk up to someone on a gen, then undisguise and attack
---
if you replace disguise with cloak then you've described wraith
---
Mouse5 is a game changer, switched from console and it‚Äôs true evolution
---
Can I use this idea and flesh it out to be a bit more balanced? I want to use it in a concept document to send to the devs. You'll be given full credit for the while concept.
---
As a killer, I love when people dive the hook when I'm still near.
---
At that point, it's just a better dead hard. Like OP said, risk and reward
---
hi there. this was asked on the forums (link down below) and not queen responded. https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/97564/withering-blight-event-postponed

You legend! Your sacrifice was not in vain

I have no idea why she gets so much hate
---
Why is that my life rn? Rip to us editing procrastinators.
---
The rare voice of reason, bold enough to go against common consonance.
---
They haven‚Äôt figured out balancing if you ask me. Anyway, saying wraith is fun is entirely opinionated. For me he‚Äôs god awful and needs a buff. As he is now, he would be better than this concept for the Thing.
