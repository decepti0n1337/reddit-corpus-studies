I was thinking the same thing as I got quite a head start from balanced landing and suddenly he‚Äôs just behind me, this is why I don‚Äôt like the shape
---
You lucky bastard. consistent 32k black pip is literally ideal.
---
Personally, my experience is the closer I am to rank 20, the more likely I'll see a killer that camps people on hook. Perhaps if you haven't played survivor in a while, your survivor level isn't far from 20?
---

---
I usually play solo in purple, and sometimes red ranks, and almost no killers camp at those levels.
---
As for challenges, aside from an increase in Trappers, and a few people insisting on self caring here and there, I haven't noticed much in the way of changed behaviour. I don't feel like I'm dying any more than I usually would.
---
Most of the challenges don't really promote toxic or shitty play. I could see the odd person slamming pallets early in a chase, or maybe some basement patrolling, but other than that,maybe you're just running in to newer killers or killers who can't rank up due to their play style.
---
You should leave him be to have his own opinion and you shouldn‚Äôt bother him about it.
---
My question is, why does Behaviour keep making these dead end spots like that? And that map has tons of them.
---
If it works, it works
---
 Note to self: some people are douchebags
---
Then its not such a Big deal
---
r/technicallythetruth
---
Always a hard decision...but the win is so tempting
---
To be fair, if it really was all 5 gens, there‚Äôs no reason for them to leave the hook, and it DID work for him in the end if what you said is true.
---
It sucks, but the sometimes the best option is to let a player die. Killer depips and gets matched with players he‚Äôs more suited for in chases, and the other 3 escape.
---
Edit: EG rescue is also killer dependent, as well as if you have BT. Some killers can still put you in an unfortunate checkmate however, like Leatherface
---
HillBilly is fine. Do something about Forever Freddy instead.
---
It never occurred to me that PC players can't walk. Master race, my ass.
---
I remember seeing a dbd animated video of if emotes were added into the game with it having claudette doing that stupid clown take the L dance at exit gate, then showing trapper facecamping her doing the same. Its awful
---
You need to kill all 4 with the tombstone add on. Mori or sacrificing won‚Äôt work.
---
I did it first try too.
---
Wasn't even luck, recently most of my teams are either new players or scaredy cats

You bothered me about my opinion though. He‚Äôs bothering OP about his opinion. So we have to leave him alone, but you and him can bother other people?

Seems fair.

I mean. Isnt that with every multiplayer game. The cute science nerd who has a cute or depressing please love me backstory wind up being pure evil gameplay wise.

Wait I get it, it‚Äôs Freedom of Speech unless someone does it back, then it‚Äôs an attack. Got it
---
W-what? I seriously can't figure out what you're asking, how do you think online works?
---
Thanks for crediting
---
Yeah no.
---
Sorry, but BP is BP, challenges are challenges, and dailies are dailies. 90% of Survivors wouldn't offer me a free kill at the end of a match, so why should I offer them a free escape?
---
I honestly love that, I think it's supper cool, it's just I hyper focus on the crotch maggots and open fly.
---
[deleted]
---
i meant if the killer is appearing offline :)
---
I have a build I call Terminator Myers with infinite tier 3, bamboozle, spirit fury, enduring and any fourth perk of your choosing. There‚Äôs just no escape.
---
Correct and it‚Äôs very difficult to achieve, took me a few days of trying but I got it and got it again because I was screwing around with my totem Myers
---
Pharmacy Quentin, run pharmacy, sprint burst, adrenaline, and empathy, burn a coin for 2 more chests to loot, and thats all, deliver heals and medkits everywhere.
---
Plague is a bit of an oddball when it comes to perks. Perks that are meta on some killers (Sloppy Butcher, Nurses Calling) are **terrible** on her due to survivors being able to just cleanse and heal instantly; other perks like Thanatophobia and Stridor (more so the former than the latter, but that‚Äôs just my personal opinion) actually suit her well. Admittedly, Thana is still a weaker perk, but the slowdown and the red bar sometimes fucks with survivors heads and ‚Äúforces‚Äù a cleanse. 
---
For addons, I personally prefer her Ametic series (Vile Purge is more potent per spew): break them quicker during a chase, down them faster, and snowball. Large maps in general aren‚Äôt the best for her (or for any killer without a movement ability of some sort).
---
Yooo did you really delete that comment?! Loool bro get a clue
---
That's Small Might, not All Might though.
---
Urban Evasion is a good perk but a lot of people either:
---
**A.** Rely on it way too much.
---
**B.** Use it when they really don't need to.
---
~~**C.** Both.~~
---
I fell quite firmly into the A camp which is why I stopped using it. It's very helpful but I found that often it ended up being a crutch that made me go for sub-optimal plays. There were times that it saved me and times now that I wish I was using it (cough Hag cough) but quite often it was a waste of a perk slot.
---
Urban Evasion is Sprint Burst lite, in a lot of ways. People who use it often don't know when they should be sprinting or when they should be walking. At least with Urban it's more that people feel like they should get use out of their perk (as opposed to Sprint Burst where people don't want to waste it, and then end up ironically wasting its potential) but fact still stands that someone Urban Evading everywhere is just as bad as someone walking everywhere to hold onto Sprint Burst.
---
People seem to forget Urban's quote: *"The paint is still fresh but I'm long gone."* Urban is good to evade the Killer in situations where your trail is fresh and you wouldn't be able to evade normally. But outside of those situations regular crouched movement speed is enough. You move at 28.25% movement speed while crouched normally, which is usually enough to evade the Killer if you're smart. While Urban can be helpful in very clutch situations you're far better off running a more generally useful perk that has more applications overall, or a stronger general-case use.
---
Most contexts where Urban would've helped can be avoided by running stronger detection perks (Spine Chill, ~~Worse Spine Chill~~ Premonition) or stronger stealth perks that are more generally applicable (Iron Will, Lightweight, Fixated.) Even excluding perks to help you avoid situations that Urban combats there are still a lot of incredibly strong perks that you won't have a slot to equip if you're running Urban: Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, Exhaustion Perks - that's already 4 perks, and you're going to have to give up one to bring Urban.

Appearing isn't the same as actually being, they're basically disguising their online activity so people on their friends list don't bug them or something while they're playing.

Thank you, this helps a lot
---
People play ‚Äòbad killers‚Äô because their powers/mechanics are fun. Or they lack the skilled to improve with other killers. Why do you think people play them at all if they‚Äôre as bad as you say?
---
You‚Äôre talking a lot of shit but you‚Äôre not backing any of it up with factual examples. Please take your delusions elsewhere.

Only thing that‚Äôs sucks about the pipe is the sound it makes! Same sound as knife being swung, BhVR really went cheap on this add on and didn‚Äôt even bother to make a new noise for the pipe. Hopefully they will change it soon, was very disappointed and just shows how little BhVR cares. Like everyone has been saying lately that they are just going for a cash grab
---
You deleted it because you legit said ‚Äòdon‚Äôt be an asshole and argue with people because of their different opinions‚Äô yet you‚Äôve been doing it to me.
---
You actually are not self aware at all. You‚Äôre hilarious
---
I got lucky with a bad team where the last person went afk so I didn‚Äôt have to worry about them getting out through the hatch.
---
absolutely not
---
But the game can still progress because the other players can finish the last gen and trigger end game collapse. 
---
Holding the game hostage is when the game literally cannot continue. This game can. What the Huntress did was scummy as hell, but it is not what you are describing.
---
Lol at me and the other guy both getting downvoted even though it‚Äôs true. And we both said the huntress was in the wrong to do this. The fact is that it isn‚Äôt holding the game hostage because the game can progress.
---
This meme isn't funny why the hell is it so popular.
---
Also can't wait to see this reposted in two days.
---
Just practice
---
Prepare for the downvotes. Only killer sided humor gets upvotes;)
---
Undetermined amount of time is still a timeframe. Holding the game hostage is only when there is no possible end except the disconnect button

Don't invite your low rank friend into your high rank games

I guess I never thought about it for dead hard, but you can just not swing right away. No need to waste a slot

Spirit was broken if used right.

Imagine having a killer pop out if nowhere and getting a free hook per ability use due to an addon.

Whats the template of this meme?

Firstly, I would like to present to you: [TRAPPER‚ÄôS BASEMENT](https://youtu.be/A1QGKYniIHk)!! 
---
Second, check out his perk build videos‚Äîhe has TONS of off meta builds for you to experiment with, for both survivor and killer. Monto is a personal favorite content creator of mine, so I may be a tad biased.
---
Wait they have ps4s at hospitals?
---
They really need to prioritize a Legion rework
---
Yeah. I play on PC but in pretty sure dedicated servers for console. It definitely seems like you've run into a big if your connection was good.
---
Standard spirit also isn't sexualized and is mangled

yeaaaaah...but on the bright side, at least 12 years olds are easier to kill.

---
Self care and Urban Evasion? The forehead has arrived.
---
I like to run a gen protection build on Plague.
---
- BBQ/Chili: Vision on hooking someone
---
- Ruin: To slow the game down, just a little bit.
---
- Dying Light: To slow the game down into late game.
---
- Surveillance: Information regarding gens being repaired.
---
Ruin slows the game down so that I can get a few stacks of Dying Light. Dying Light continues to slow the game down into late game.
---
When I kick a generator, I‚Äôll also puke on it. This means survivors either need to become infected to stop the regression or the generator regresses for 35 seconds. With Dying Light stacking up, survivors can‚Äôt repair that regression in equal time.
---
Surveillance lets me see whenever a survivor restarts a generator, letting me know to return and re-kick the gen back into regression.
---
If a survivor chooses to cleanse, they‚Äôll just get reinfected when they do a gen. If they don‚Äôt cleanse, then the puking is going to alert me to their location and the one-hit down is going to end chases quicker than usual.
---
Add-on wise: I sometimes use longer infection on objects and quicker movement while charging, but I don‚Äôt really use too many add-one to begin with.
---
As a Killer main, I have to question this: If a Survivor can loop the Killer for a full 90 seconds or more, why would they want to have the Killer stop chasing them?
---
Assuming the other Survivors are working on gens, that Survivor looping the killer is doing a ton of work for their team and is probably single handedly winning the game for them. The other survivors might not be as strong as loopers.
---
The fault in that lies solely with the Killer for not dropping a chase that they couldn't win. That's called "Tunneling" and is usually seen as a dick move since said survivor got no Objective points, no Altruism Points, and might not get any Survival points depending on how many pallets they had to use to win the chase.
---
The Killer's job is the end chases. The Survivors job is to keep chases going. It's not Toxic if the Survivor outplays you.
---
Lastly, if you're getting looped for a long time by a single survivor, start chasing other survivors; they might be worse and drop pallets, and when the pallets are gone the better looper has less to work with and will probably die easier.
---
Yeah
---
https://amp.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/azv79y/dbd_player_survey_results/
---
45% of the Reddit player base are killer mains. That is so much higher than in game, Reddit has a hugely skewed ratio compared to in-game. Well at least by saying that last bit you make it clear you're one of those toxic players.
---
Unfortunately that didn‚Äôt fix it :(
---
Delete spirit.
---
Thanks for the advice. Wish I could use this build, just don‚Äôt got Mrs. Piggy
---
Kind of points at a bigger issue in the game. The majority of killers feel forced to use ruin. If you are against a decent team by the time you have found a survivor hit them twice picked them up and put them on a hook only 2 gens are left. But ya don't dc that's not cool.
---
Yes....in the game....that is what I meant. lol
---
20 bucks they will still complain about tunnelingü§£.
---
How the fuck should we know,  do you see a live ptb?
---
I use WGLF and it's become even harder to get stacks since the last archive came out.
---
I'm kind of angry we're getting a Blood based killer and he's not an Aztec or something (The Macuahuitl is such a cool ass weapon), but I digress.
---
I really hope they don't put in Hex: Heal Ruin because Ruin shouldn't even exist, though it would be cool if there was a Hex: everyone is Mangled though.
---
I also once got such a mess after using Spirit's phase with daughter mother ring's insane speed... 
---
My speed didn't return to normal after finishing phasing. I ran around the survs a bit. It was fun tbh, I didn't use it to hit them or anything but I sure did nothing personal them. By the time they dropped a pallet, I was already on their side lol. My speed returned to normal once I decided to phase again.
---
Just let the survs go afterwards since I spent 3 gens just fooling around with the speed. Too much fun.
---
They don't care. That's one good thing about ps4. If people send messages that are over the line you can report them and Sony has a good record or punishing people for harassment and hate speech.
---
Yes, or just say you work at Epic and are looking for testers. Participants will get a free epic skin and emote the day it comes out.
---
Those are all part of their regular powers and none of them have anything to do with carrying survivors. New mechanics are new for a reason. Sure. They still stay within the games balance though. It would offset the balance.
---
Playing the game is toxic
---
What about Jane.
---
There‚Äôs a bug that gives you unlimited speed boost that‚Äôs more likely what happened
---
Writing this post is toxic
---
Let me guess, is OP new to the game since our hype for Carl began months ago? :v

upvote to the left please
---
Stop being stupid. This is 100% against the rules and you know it, so stop arguing just for the sake of arguing.
---
It should give Blindness along with Exhaustion and last for 10 secs max.
---
Another idea I had was to mark the Survivors that complete a gen with Exposed for 10 seconds, to punish popping it in the Killer's face. But that was pretty divisive.
---
When I play killer I play as fair as possible for all people involved (including myself). I‚Äôm not gonna throw the game to make survivors happy but I‚Äôm also not gonna start tunneling people off hook when there‚Äôs still 5 gens up.
---
Sadly yeah, between setting up traps and crossing the map multiple times to get the ones that spawn super far away, you lose the first half of the game. Takes some skill and good trap placements to help turn a game around. One trick I‚Äôve learned to use myself is with decoy traps. When a survivor disarms a trap and if I can guess which way they came from, I‚Äôll set up a more hidden trap before resetting the first to bait them into disarming it again. Whispers can help let you know when it‚Äôs safe to set the real trap, and when you want to reset the bait one when you know they are close. I‚Äôve gotten a lot of greedy nerds trapped with those ;)
---
But getting good with the playstyle that suits you can make a big difference. Run a certain character/playstyle long enough and you can get super far, when I play the game regularly I can usually get red rank survivor without all the ‚Äúrequired meta perks‚Äù like DS and Deadhard. I run a full stealth build with Urban Evasion, Quick &amp; Quiet, Iron Will and Calm Spirit. Got the nickname ‚ÄúMetal Gear Nea‚Äù from my friends watching all the dumb shit I pull off every game just by being sneaky, literally brushing past killers in doorways and that sort of thing. But some other players have a harder time doing that, I find I‚Äôm mainly good at it because I grew up playing loads of stealth based games. Meanwhile even if I try to run Deadhard and things like that I always fuck it up and am the first one out. Whatever works best for you :)
---
Don‚Äôt insult Freddy and Jason like this
---
Its exfoliating
---
It‚Äôs not toxic, but it is unfair and gens need changes as they get done too fast and without devoting your entire perk loadout to stopping gens you can‚Äôt play the game
---
that bulge uwu
---
Ok thanks bud
---
The shape has nothing to do with that. He has standard 115% movement speed.
---
In the last stream they said he was getting some changes. Just so people don‚Äôt think it was 8 months ago since they last mentioned him.
---
Except it's literally useless against Survivors running no Exhaustion perks, and if they are, it's only really effective against Sprint Burst. It's ludicrously situational and is essentially the only perk that doesn't have a guaranteed benefit.
---
You say this as if it's impossible to escape a chase. It's not.
---
More like skill checks the moment I need to let go of the generator to heal someone
---
I admit I said that as more of an exaggeration, but from my experience, the killer wasn‚Äôt able to protect all of their totems anyway, as they probably assumed would happen.
---
Yeah. But you still got out. Not to be rude, but being hooked is part of the game. It adds thrill and risk, as well as reward. So, you and another still got out.
---
I guess no one in this thread has ever seen a survivor get downed and immediately DC because they were the first person found. I'm not talking about uncontrollable dcs they should be able to account for that, I mean the people that are just salty something didn't go their way and leave the game.
---
We want extreme jiggle physics for Clown
---
When you do the 2 killer glitch in a kyf, and the host killer is the pig, the other killer gains the ability to crouch. I don‚Äôt know if you can still replicate this though.
---
That‚Äôd be sick. Mindbreaker is such a cool name and icon image to have such a meager and lame effect.
---
I agree that it‚Äôs an awful feeling being 1 perk down right at the start of the game, I mean it‚Äôs happened to me many times. Also yes the gen rush can be disgusting at that point but you still have options.. slugging, 3 gen, etc ... but with the way things are set up on console people are just doing this all the time because they know they won‚Äôt be punished for it. I think this is more a rant at the devs tbh for not doing something about this sooner.
---
Literally do whatever
---
No worries, tis but a rant.
---
Hot tip: Wait til someone has been hit in a chase to cleanse it. If it IS Haunted Ground, that survivor was one shot anyway and the killer won't want to let them go.  
---
And if it ISN'T Haunted Ground, you're a hero! No one will have to devour soap :D
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been saying lmao
---
Git gud

Holding the last survivor in a corner when the hatch is still open

because you phrased it as though reddit is a hivemind.
---
Can meme level be a new ranking for stuff? I'd love to make survivors suffer meme level from the hemorrhage status effect, or the blindness status effect. Or increasing ~~or decreasing~~ the lunge of evil within 1 myers to meme level.
---
DbD is a horror game, just not for the Survivors.
---
Its never going to get better. They want survivors to be overpowered. Just try taking the game less serious.
---
i havent been able to touch it. i just sprained my fore finger on my right hand 4 days ago and it has fucked me up big time with playing. i wish they were as easy as the first go round.....
---
whoops i thought i was responding to a different comment, ignore that first edit üòÇ but yeah i would say wait until its fixed
---
"lol who doesn't use exhaustion perks at higher ranks" is literally a null argument. Any perk that has no guaranteed benefit against all playstyles is bad design, period.
---
And to further refute your logical fallacy, "at higher ranks," generators reach 50% in less than 40 seconds. Throughout the first few generators, nobody will have used any Exhaustion perks, meaning it literally is only useful against Sprint Burst. And even in that case, Survivors "at higher ranks" are perceptive enough to know when a Killer is coming and start walking away more than 3 seconds before they get there. That means you're left with maybe 3 total opportunities to take advantage of this perk throughout the entire game, and in those instances Survivors "at higher ranks" will pallet loop you anyway because you don't need Exhaustion to do normal loops.
---
Hope this clears things up for you.
---
EDIT: You downvoted this the instant it was posted. How very mature of you.
---
I know, but play with your food is one of his teachables
---
This has to be the most annoying part about randoms, I will try my best to heal or get anyone up or off a hook at all times but when I go down they all suddenly got struck with blindness and the ability to ignore how the game works, they start walking into walls and dropping all pallets in sight just to "pull" the killer away and yet I'm still dieing on the floor
---
I‚Äôve been 4k‚Äôd way more than escaped there homie. Maybe you‚Äôre just not as good as you think. Try a different killer or keep working on builds. Practice makes perfect. Either way, bitching on Reddit won‚Äôt cure your grief.
---
I mean, Ghostface has always been kind of a dick.
---
When did they add Usain Bolt
---
I'd say it's less about my possession of sensitivity, and more about your lack of courtesy.
---
idk i guess someone didnt know you could slow walk with a controller and decided they had to make a hilarious ear rape meme out of it when they saw it for the first time
---
New perk walk it off. When downed by the killer you may simply lurch away in a display of alpha leadership
---
Imagine if you could just roll lockers around (as either side) and shove them against walls so Dwight is stuck in them.
---
the real MVP was killer missing the actual hit on you, But none the less a lucky escape on both part! GG
---
I've had two trapper ones at the same time, but they weren't the same exact challenge, just for the same killer.
---
You didn't understand me. 
---
All (except teabag maybe, but it can be replaced with "Power can directly kill a survivor") I said earlier sounds exactly the same as being able to use part of power while carrying a survivor. Range attacks, Built-in noed, teleportation, inability to do anything until completing a long action.. it all may sound op, yet it is in the game and all is balanced. 
---
Why can't killer who can use his power while carrying a survivor exist? Just because this hasn't been featured before or because you think it will break the balance? Same was said about things I mentioned before, but here they are. And they are not op (except teleportation, maybe, yet it is also "balanced" at the moment, even though it is not fun as it used to be. The exception proves the rule).
---
Is Legion fun for anyone?
---
As the Killer, you're in it for the long haul, your power is very good for keeping all the survivors interrupted, but it takes you a million years to catch someone and you don't make good use of slowdown perks as a result (contrast Forever Freddy, which is too far in the other extreme).
---
As a Survivor, Killer Instinct triggers on you if you enter the Terror Radius for any reason post-stab, and the propensity of Terror Radius builds on Legion (can easily hit 50 meters IIRC, and Legion can push this to 60 and still reach you with addons to Killer Instinct that lets it exceed TR and Frenzy).
---
You're always mending, it keeps you off generators reasonably well, until the Legion finally decides to down you (which if you're on a gen, might be easier than it sounds unless you healed up all the way, but you do get tons of extra warning with a TR build Legion as well).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's pretty boring to play as IMO, and a slog to play against (especially if your potato teammates toss down all the pallets).
---
Win or lose, I really don't like Legion.
---
Yes PLEASE! This is the actually best killer idea I‚Äôve ever seen
---
Awesome, thanks.
---
Thought you‚Äôd avoid all the points, gg kiddo
---
Haddonfield rework I stand fully for, Matchmaking is a joke and I don't play spirit so they could delete her and I wouldn't get effected :D
---
Yes
---
You can use whatever, just have to have those 3 perks
---
I really hope it waddles and is always on the verge of tipping over.

He means PC game pass.
---
Right lol how I felt when I hit rank 1
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
That‚Äôs not what I said. If it takes you 5 minutes to hook one person you fucked up.
---
Blood points
---
Not gonna lie my little monkey brain loves Legion for the constant "chases" (if you can call it that since I'm gonna hit them no matter what) and hits. My general gameplan is STBFL, Dying Light, and Thanatophobia and then just kinda outlast the survivors. Towards end game the action speed penalty gets to 30+, forever freddy got nothing on forever legion
---
No Mither + Iron Will = op
---
Thank you
---
bugged haste perk really don't know what causes it I guess the game breaking from lag
---
I Feel like this would work better as an ad on but pretty good idea üëç
---
Get teachable
---
What item? It is clear you just don't want to have a new mechanic in a game, because it is somehow sounds OP for you. To make this actually useful you would need to waste portals by placing them near hooks (while it is not the best way to place them) you would have to waste a portal to actually get there. This mechanic would need some changes, yet it is fine.
---
I'm not sure how that is relevant. Xbox to PC crossplay isnt a thing yet. I'm aware about Microsoft gamepass on PC but you still cant play unless they have supported crossplay.
---
Technically as long as the game is going on  it's fine , Now if she was only one alive and then she did that then yes its holding the game hostage.  But if other survivors are able to do gens and initiate endgame collapse , it's legit. Why do I say that ? We had the same problem with killers blocking the basement completely. One problem was the pig blocking the basement with a person who has a trap on , and one who didn't or whatever . It was ruled fine despite giving the survivor with a trap zero chance of survival and making other players wait til then.
---
I recognize shaggy, Joker, and emo Peter
---
Couldn‚Äôt I link my Xbox account then since it‚Äôs Microsoft?
---
Lol I did this right at the exit and got picked up I was well I deserve this lol
---
So you really think that the minority of players are just a loud minority and screech about the majority all the time? Do you have a functioning brain? Jesus Christ man, if I didn‚Äôt know better I‚Äôd think you wore a helmet to school as a kid.
---
You are not gonna be able to use dead hard if you have sprint burst
---
Maps shouldn't have areas where a killer can block you and you can't escape
---
[ideal pipe sound effect](https://youtu.be/SBzUQJDIeG4)
---
That eliminates flashlights. They might as well not be in game if their main use is removed. People would also just place a portal in the basement and then place one more everytime they down a survivor.
---
Why are you not allowed to play with your food a bit? Its fun!
---
Sorry but no, 3 gens should be get done by your first hook if you‚Äôre even a half decent killer. Of course you have the odd god level survivor but if every survivor you come across is a looping god then you just need to git gud simply
---
I never want the entire match so stop giving useless info you're making yourself look like a cocky asshole. No I don't have it set to 2 minutes because I really don't care for uploading much gameplay at all lmfao. ''incapable of 2 minutes or more of good gameplay'' if assuming was an addiction you'd be the number one assumaholic. I don't plan on being a ''photographer, videographer, streamer, youtuber'' and already know how to set my game capture and have told you and also your info is useless anyway because you expect me to go back in time some how to reset my capture to 2 mins just so you can see a tbag? What in god's name is wrong with your brain cells. Obviously if I only care for short clips for a majority of the time I'm going to have it set to a lower timing your logic can't even be classed as logic you're trying to make yourself sound clever to rage out your inner saltiness because you saw a teabagger get karma probably like yourself. Grow up. You have to actually say smart things to go with your smart ass attitude mate x'D
---
STBFL makes laughing faster yes
---
The devs claim no killer is getting less than 2 kills on average. Why on Earth would they add this?
---
Yeah I dont get their stats either but in their eyes as it stands now, the killers are fine.
---
I‚Äôve noticed people do it more because they have no game sense versus doing it for bloodpoints. Like the survivors who use Urban Evasion or Spine Chill and hide whenever they hear terror radius usually are shit so they don‚Äôt know the ideal time to unhook and what plays have to happen for them to win the game
---
She...she has titty physics.
---
*sOmeBoDy'S wAtChInG mEeEe*
---
Im so mad im at 5/6 medkit challenge, i dont like playing survivor and i died with my last medkit at 1%
---
Damn this is fucking sick as fuck!
---
r/antimeme
---
Nonsense. Killers cam‚Äôt be toxic! They assured me.
---
If you think genrushing is like, a thing, you're bad. It's up to the killer to provide side objectives for survivors. Healing, unhooking, and killer specific things like traps and RBTs and such. 
---
Survivors only have one objective unless you give them more. Running ruin is a good start, but if you're not providing enough pressure, of course they'll pop gens.
---
noob question: is it worth it to not get bad teachables so they dont show up?
---
Same there's like no way of matching them without buying them and equipting them and sometimes I buy something and wish I bought another cos it doesn't match well :(
---
Wtf lol that‚Äôs great
---
Definitely.
---
"Kate's Guitar" - moar windows
---
"Jeff's Brush" - have a token for free
---
"Nea's Spray Can" - everyone moves 2% faster
---
Edit: Formatting
---
Billy with a slight speed nerf to offset his crazy 230% sprint speed.
---
Nurse can blink through walls and across maps. She has the worst speed in the game. Only reasonable billy would too
---
It‚Äôs usually a brown toolbox, but what the hell.
---
Excuse me theres a Sadako vs Kayako?
---
Well at least it gave me a good laugh.
---
Same for mad grit being purple while surge is green
---
Sometimes the killer spawns right in front of a survivor too. Nobody complains about that
---
Because you dont answer my texts. I really need you to clean your room.
---
do you get back down to 1 perk at level 1 too?
---
Good idea. I haven't played her on Hawkins yet but I could see her countering balanced landing well on those loops.
---
i just got it, thanks yall xD
---
That‚Äôs prolly just a very good gaming chair and headset and, you know, a huge mousepad.
---
Yeah some people are too sweaty. They run moris, Ruin, NOED, red add ons and still play like a piece of shit.
---
Then they wonder why there‚Äôs a d/c epidemic in the game.
---
Survivors are cunts. It's like bhvr knew so they made moris just for that. Honestly when against toxic assholes just play as dirty as possible, their whining in the end game chat will make you feel better.
---
What about when you reach 3? what if you didnt get all the perks? Shouldn't there just be an infinite big bloodweb after reaching 150 levels
---
Another reason for them to hate each other
---
Shoot, looks like I took misinformation from somebody else and misinformed otuer people.
---
That‚Äôs what Mexican Joker wants you to believe
---
This post is not about killers, at all.
---
It's giving survivors something else to do
---
I‚Äôll be honest, I play both sides equally, and I see that killers can be just as toxic. I had one guy report me and send me a voice message which was pretty hateful because I was pallet looping. Both sides have their toxic players, I just try to have fun and not let what they say get to me
---
Or laurie
---
Teachables will not go away until you buy them, so it‚Äôll slow down the process of finding regular perks until you find them.
---
For example, if you‚Äôre at level 36 and haven‚Äôt bought any teachables yet, both perks on all of that character‚Äôs bloodwebs will be the level 30/level 35 teachable.
---
I think the symbol you're looking for is ¬ø
---
This post is 4 months old and I've still come just to say one word in it. Spirit.
---
Not anymore :/
---
Though, r/boneachingjuice seems to be trying to fill that gap now, at least!
---
LMFAOOOOOOOOOüò≠üò≠üò≠üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
---
Survivors wonder why lots of killers play like dicks.
---
Well, I can safely say that if no one else is experiencing this, you and I are the minority and I'm a ps4 player.
---
How low can you be to shit on a rank 19 noobie.
---
This is the typical treatment killers get so dont let it get to ya, next time you see them just camp them and tunnel them lol
---
I also have trouble staying connected with my friends after about 3 matches in a row. Only solution until it‚Äôs fixed is to return to the Xbox dashboard, close the game, and relaunch again. I don‚Äôt think I would compare it to the dumpster fire Fallout 76 started but it certainly needs to be addressed and you‚Äôre not alone.
---
It's called if you spot a bug, report it to the forums so the devs will actually listen
---
I don't know man, seems kinda gay to me
---
He‚Äôs one of the weakest killers in the game, dude.
---
And before you cucks start downvoting it's a filthy Frank reference
---
Only those perks* and yea any add ons are fine
---
Meh
---
I dont mind Billy nearly as much as Spirit or Nurse. Most people dislike those two because they ignore a lot of the game's core mechanics/have little to no counterplay in certain situations. Hence why they are receiving a nerf/rework. Billy isn't really like that though. He's strong, but doesn't lack counterplay. He's easy to learn but hard to master and can be terrifying in the hands of a skilled player. When I die against a Hillbilly it doesn't feel undeserved like it sometimes does with Spirit, for example. In fact, he's probably my favorite killer to go against at the moment. So I really dont think he needs a nerf.
---
‚ÄúJust have to have those 3 perks‚Äù
---
Cause r/deadbydaylight wanted him fixed, not absolutely gutted
---
I know the gap between the buggy 76 and the slightly bugged dbd is large, but it's hard for me not to feel a slight comparison. Bugs being present for a very long time. I'm glad others are also having this issue. We're not just unlucky, and I'm not crazy.
---
And no 4th
---
You should try playing doctor, hillbilly, or Myers...
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong Bhvr already has a working pipe sound doesn‚Äôt the doctor metal bat make a thwack sound effect what stoping them from adding this in
---
Yes they do.
---
If you got a problem with this sub, leave. Nobody's holding you back. Plus the devs probably don't even look on this sub so go on Twitter and @ them to complain about this wglf bug.
---
Are the servers bugged for you too? Like after a set few games, you have to restart the game due to host connection issues?
---
‚ÄúHAVE TO HAVE THOSE 3 PERKS‚Äù it‚Äôs like you can‚Äôt read
---
I agree with haddenfield it needs a rework
---
They have previously stated they want to make all killers have the same amount of addons/addon tiers. Many of his addons are quite fun such as the engravings or turn so rather than major changes such as the nurse got.. I hope his rarity's are the only thing touched. 
---
Unlike say spirit, billy is very very fun to verse so I don't want them to change/nerf him.
---
&gt; They say this, or people just assume it?
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Because having a massive grind wall is not equal just getting a free chapter.
---
46 levels per character is not massive (to reach 9.000 Iridescent Shards)... Plus it is barely a grind since you get this simply by playing the game.
---
i‚Äôm pretty phobic to insects i hate that skin so much so you‚Äôre not alone
---
I REEEAALLY like the art style. Nice.
---
Click on that double  &gt;&gt; to make your worries disappear
---
If you have a 4th you will fail, that's why I emphasized "only" 
---
No need to be rude I wasn't attacking your intelligence just adding for clarification.
---
Yes. I was doing the challenge where I had to heal two people with empathy and i healed both of them and made sure that was the challenge I picked but for some reason I wasn‚Äôt considered complete
---
I mean it was quite clear by the ‚Äúhave to have those 3‚Äù plus very off topic as OP asking abt add ons
---
The only way this nerf would make sense is if something like insta-saw was basekit.. Addon-less billy is one of the most balanced killers in the game.
---
You're assuming it's Rin's dad ü§°. It's most likely the first yamaoka. He's referenced as having a demon mask, and using a sword in the already existing lore to the yamaoka estate.

There are a lot of people playing survivors who deserve to be facecamped and mori'd straight afterwards for how they bully killers, but not everyone is like that. Thanks to matchmaking being utterly broken, i often faced yellow rank killers while i was high purple-low red rank, and while they did get stomped, i did make sure to let them kill me in the end. 
---
The 5k BP for escaping isn't much anyways, and i'd much rather reward a killer who didn't DC or resort to scummy methods despite being outmatched. Plus, i enjoy actually seeing people playing something other than Spirit or Billy, and i want to encourage them to continue experimenting with their favorites instead of making them feel so hopeless they resort to playing these 2 just so they feel they stand a chance. 
---
So yeah, anybody who thinks that genrushing and escaping against a poor 2-perk Wraith is a monumental achievement worthy of t-bagging at the gates and being assholes in the chat post-match shouldn't complain next time they bump into a Spirit running Yakuyoke and Beads with a Mori.
---
I main legion at red ranks with thana instead of ruin. Hes a fun run and gun. It doesnt take a million years to catch someone. His main power is the information aside from the slowdown. Hes only strong if you know how to juggle 4 survivors, his still low tier and you really have to work hard for your wins and make no mistakes.   
---
In contrast Forever Freddy is the exact opposite where you dont have to earn your pressure (slowdown). You can make 3 min of pure mistakes and youll be fine. The very reason the meta is the meta for survivor and killers is both want to keep repeating mistakes  and have second chances. ergo have it easy
---
I always shake my head and make them pick it back up and leave with it lol
---
&gt;wow remember when they used to have those offerings? it sounds like they still do, but maybe u dont get them if u buy every dlc as soon as its out?
---
On PC you can deactivate the licensed DLCs on your library and the splinters start appearing again.
---
For killers: 
---
‚ÄúMyers Bare chest‚Äù - faster stalking for stalk-based killers
---
‚ÄúClown‚Äôs thicc ass‚Äù fart gas every time you hit a survivor 
---
‚ÄúGhostface‚Äôs tea bag‚Äù regardless of killer you can crouch,
---
oh, yeah that too
---
That is if you actually fucking get it in your blood web. I got it before leveling steve. He's level 30 now. No borrowed. But I did get 3 purple flashlights 3 webs in a row. Seems like the entity is suggesting something.
---
I love my piggy but ghosty boi is better
---
Yeah. But for me it takes about 4-5 hours of straight gameplay for it to start lagging. But uh... N E V E R P L A Y O N T V
---
close second is p3 huntresses doing snipe shots.
---
That‚Äôs my secret, captain. I‚Äôm always exposed!
---
*Tru3Ta1ent comment* there, I did it so no one else has to.
---
What is not okay? Imo it's only if a survivor body bocks another survivor.
---
LOUD = FUNNY
---
thats not even the dead by daylight bill model smh my head 
---
0/10
---
#/s
---
"Fixed a bug that caused Legion to not spawn in the match in hooked state"
---
no
---
urban makes you crouch at walk speed so theres no downside to using it when you should be walking really
---
Seriously, if you're not having fun playing the game, stop playing it. DC punishment can't come soon enough.
---
I just got out of a game where this killer tryharded beyond belief even though 3 people dc'd off the bat, why? For a rift challenge apparently.
---
Did you cleanse?
---
Once.
---
I totally feel you. It will be better soon
---
Legion main here, Ghostface then Myers are my favorites after the edgy teens.
---
I mean by that logic when have we ever asked for any other survivor than Ace?
---
nOeD oP, cRuTcH pErK
---
Its gonna suck for people that have legit reasons to dc but yeah i agree they cant come soon enough
---
You obviously didn't know that you can gradually change speed when you walk with a joystick
---
It‚Äôs always so obvious when it‚Äôs going to happen, but I imagine the killer feels so witty and amused when it happens. Just wish they would at least let me get the extra bp for opening the gate but it‚Äôs whatever lol.
---
On keyboard, it automatically goes on max walk speed
---
this post wasn't in annoyance of noed but k
---
MMM. So excited to fight 8 fucking DS's.
---
My response wasn't implying that, but k
---
Thats cool man, just don't yell at the killer for playing normally despite your newbie friend being in the match, too many survivors do that
---
Your welcome, hope you enjoy the comics as much as I have
---
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Glad to hear it. &lt;3 Keep on keeping it.
---
Did another person also cleanse?
---
The only time I would consider doing it is if we were the last survivors and I was in a chase with no hopes of escape. Only sometimes then will I attempt to save them. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. Plan on unlocking borrowed time now that ik it‚Äôs Bill‚Äôs perk lol.
---
Literally as fast as they could. First time playing survivor since rank reset.
---
Then tunnelling isn't a thing. It's securing the objective optimally.
---
Ghost face imo, pig can be pretty good at times but it's really just rng if she does well in a game. Ghost face is way more consistent at getting 4ks.
---
Challenges can be buggy sometimes and, although uncommon, others can affect yours.
---
Why does this make me so uncomfortable wtf
---
Trapper's ability is an instadown if he's near anyone getting hit with it, Clown doesn't get stunned for his loop-breaker, and Leather Face may struggle to get it, but he only needs one hit of his power. Legion is out there dealing 28 stab wounds and nearly blacking out from fatigue.
---
Only the Doctor could comfortably be called weaker, because at LEAST Legion's ability deals damage.
---
 You deserve more upvotes
---
Steve: Ight I'm Bout To Head Out.
---
No worries, i main LF i know exactly when to rev and when to stop. I know theyre doing the pallet challenges because they eventually stop and gesture me to let them stun me lol
---
That‚Äôs a big yikes
---
That man was 100% staring at the booty.
---
I cant imagine why I'd play DbD at a party, let alone killer. I dont have the money or friends for a LAN setup.
---
So long gay bowser!
---
Yup thats rank reset for you.
---
If im going to be tunneled at least rush gens and tbag the douche at the exit gates. Hate it when you get rank 16 survivors who run around looking for Ruin all game or just gawp at the hook so your death was in vain
---
I did it first try with this build:
---
Prove Thyself, Better Together, Streetwise and obviously dark sense.  I used a commodious toolbox with instructions and socket swivels good luck! :)
---
Just benefit the killer so he gets the total points he was going to miss out on due to survivor manginanosis. If they dc anyway they werent going to benefit the other survivors that's for sure. If the killer dcs, then everyone gets a complete gen of 5 added to their bloodpoints.
---
Forget Legion. His design is the worst ever. The guy who came up with the ideia should be fired. Honestly I think he is impossible to fix.
---
Exactly, like do something productive while I‚Äôm getting insidious camped in the basement lol
---
That's not true
---
It‚Äôs a viable tactic. Taking a hit to escape is fine. The goal is to escape, not get a perfect run and get out clean. Luckily the dude on the gate had someone blocking for them. I usually have people hide until I get taken off then they finish and bounce
---
Clown
---
Lmao imagine mobile players that actually try hard at the game.
---
There's ALWAYS an infinite bloodweb. You just dont hit the center when leveling otherwise you prestige. You keep getting perks, add ons, and offering no matter what. You can unlock every perk and never prestige.
---
Plague
---
get better lmfao
---
I am fine. No idea what you're on about.
---
Is this considered an half antimeme
---
I think you had enough answers but here I am. I mained pig almost a year. She is strong, imo one of the best m1 killers. She has a lot of resources. But ghostface is way better and now he's my main. Along with spirit. Ghosty is a mix of pig, wraith and Myers. He's super strong and highly viable and at red ranks. Of course you need the right perks and add ons for it. If you need more advice say something.
---
Point 1 trapper ability only works if he is territorial, weak, clown quick at dropping pallets, you can do 5 gens in the time he chases one survivor around, weak. Legion has pressure since he can injure everyone with basically no delay, everyone one shot or they have to heal, he is not as week as you think.
---
Looks like you just proved my point while simultaneously highlighting your own inexperience with conversation.
---
Donkey!!!
---
It states that you only need self care. Not that you need to use it. Just heal yourself somehow. I used syringes for that.
---
Plague is the stronger killer.
---
However, the clown jiggles so, Clown&gt;Plague
---
I‚Äôll offer a free kill if you‚Äôre not rude during the game(face-camping before gates are open, tunneling where there is an obvious choice, taunting at hook, etc) and you didn‚Äôt get too much(1 or less and you get it, 2 or more and you don‚Äôt).
---
I put it on there for several reasons.
---
1. Even though it's an OK tracking perk it doesn't help you in a chase whatsoever.
---
2. It only reveals auras of survivors near a gen when it's completed. Which is kind of useless info since you know where they are by virtue of the gen completed being shown. If you're any good you can extrapolate from there. There are also other perks for tracking that do far better. Whispers and Discordance can tell you where you can find a survivor without you losing Gatekeeper emblems.
---
3. When the last gen is completed you can already make an educated guess as to where the survivors are going. Even if you guess the wrong gate most killers have the ability to get to the other one before they open it unless they're running Wake Up (which is also a dookie perk).
---
4. BBQ is just better because after you hook someone you're looking for another survivor to target anyways. Even if it can be countered with lockers now, the extra BP is literally never useless.
---
5. Even though the current version of BM is usable, it used to be actually useless in every scenario.
---
Well you ARE playing as Nea...
---
Killer toxicity is far harsher than anything survivors can dish out. The killer can tunnel survivors and remove them from the game with next to no bp scored. Survivors can‚Äôt do that to the killer. Survivors teabag the killer and they get a bit mad. The killer facecamps a survivor and eliminates them from the game entirely.
---
i like how you ASSume everyone is like you and is glued to reddit
---
But you put it in the meme over something else like unrelenting.
---
fair enough, we'll see how it goes.
---
Thicker
---
That clown outfit is the most disgusting thing in DBD right after the Plag
---
Just run no mither too so you don‚Äôt bleed! Genius!
---
Again it comes to consequences. It‚Äôs extremely risky for a survivor to do that and the killer can just eliminate them from the game if they feel like it.
---
That's why I said survivors pissing them off can fuck over their game and the games after that game.
---
This has to be one of the funniest things ive seen in DBD.
---
Thats not bming.
---
&gt; bf and I were discussing 
---
r/nobodyasked
---
more like a problem with the bootlickers that flood it. you pansies literally bandwagon on just about everything lmfao and whoah lord forbid someone thinks differently because then they'll be flooded with downvotes lol
---
If you didn't drop it during the match, it's a bug
---
I play on ps4 too. Lately since the tomes release there's a lot of gamers playing strange. I've been asked to farm along with survivors a lot and deal with DCs and farm survivors unhooking right in front of me. The worst is since they reworked the ranking system, if a survivor DC you cant have 2 pip... I had a stupid where they were clearly trying to do some challenge, killed them all, (2 of them were 1 hooked) 0 gens done, brutal killer in the end lol
---
Both have decent perks. Plague's Infectious Fright is great on "Worldwide" killer builds like Stabbing Spree Infinite Tier 3 Myers. Dark Devotion is underrated and funny on Doctor. Corrupt Intervention is a decent side-grade to ruin to buy time for killers who need setup and unlike Ruin it won't get cleansed immediately.
---
Clown has Bamboozle which is decent for blocking vaults. Coulrophobia is only really good on massive terror radius builds AKA Hostage Doc. Pop Goes The Weasel is amazing on Freddy.
---
In terms of killers both are decent. I find Clown very weak though but his design and sound effects are top-notch. I can't wait for the elephant mascot costume to be released.
---
It's times like these that makes me glad I stockpile Ebony moris
---
I'm sorry, I am truly ashamed of my wrongdoing, please accept my apology, I shall go to my corners now
---
When take the punches meant for you little brother and get two extra stacks
---
How does that eliminate flashlights? I really don't want to insult you, but are you dumb? Have you ever seen a flashlight save that was not a timed blind right after finish of the animation? 
---
Let me clarify what I mean by:  be able to traverse portals with a survivor on his shoulder.
---
Demo picks up a survivor, walks towards the nearest portal and uses it as he would use it to move to another portal. All that means is that survivors who swarm around demo will have a bit less chances to let their friend struggle from a shoulder, as demo will just move to the nearest portal and disappear. It also opens a lot more possibilities for map pressure and basement builds, which are not the strongest, yet the best thing that exists in the game.

So I spawn on 1 side of the map, survivors spawn on the other. By the time I get to them, they already almost finish a gen. And I haven't started a chase yet.
---
What is this from?
---
no i'm just pulling the piss because never before has anyone on this sub been offended by swear words. like even if i didn't use "shit" in an offensive or insulting matter, you'd probably still get a bit upset over the use of it. people swear, it's not that bad, grow up
---
I don't think they'd add anyone from Outlast 2 due to their hesitancy to put in any sort of religious overtones. It took them quite a few killers in and going back to B.C. to add in a killer that was enough removed from modern day religions for us to get that fantasy, so I doubt they'd add someone with overt Christian tones due to negative backlash that would get the game.
---
We're more likely to see someone from Outlast 1 than Outlast 2.
---
How about Basement Hag, Agitation, Firm Grip, Ruin, etc?
---
I'm working on 45 right now and have all the challenges done, paid pass.
---
Yeah nerfing killers is great for killers.  Why dont they nerf gen rushing,  or infinite loops? Of thats right cause survivors only care about making the game better for them.
---
How am I supposed to provide pressure, if they are doing their objective so fast, that I don't have any time to do anything? By the time I only GET TO them they have already almost finished 20% of their objective. This is not okay.
---
What is bc T1?
---
Hi, PC gamer and part-time console gamer here. Ahem, *maybe don't be a dick about your preferred platform*?
---
Oh trust me. As someone who is avidly against the idea that Spine Chill is a top tier perk, I get downvoted a lot too. I'm sure reddit survivors are somewhere between "brand new" and "just getting good" at this game. So many terrible opinions are echoed on here, it's embarrassing.
---
People need to stop correcting this. Anyone who still doesn't know what that rule means just isnt going to get it. Its the devs fault for giving it a misleading name.
---
Trapping 3 or less players at any point is considered unsportsmanlike conduct, but it still should be reported so its not a big deal if it gets reported for the wrong thing. Once again, its the devs fault for making it confusing by making such a specific offence with a misleadingly general name.
---
It is absolutely NOT worth bickering about this anymore.
---
go ahead, show me some skill against good survivors that actually do their objective on m1 killer.
---
I've actually never run into Basement Hag. I imagine actually having to have an add-on that is higher on the rarity scale as opposed to a basic perk is probably a big reason for that.
---
I mean, I don't mind Leatherface. I went up against a Leatherface with Dark Devotion and Tinkerer and that was one of the most fun games I've been in in a while. But Insidious should get removed out of the game and turned into something else because no one uses it for anything other than stupid "don't touch totem/chest" memes or face camping survivors.
---
I think that‚Äôs switch
---
lol! the lyrics could be... a coincidence.
---
Paid Pass, Tier 28 I believe.
---
Climb through walls? So there is no way to loop him at all? 
---
Too strong and too complicated. Also, with frenzy decreasing to 6 seconds, you basically just revert legion to the focus down the deep wound survivor, which is why he got changed in the first place
---
Maybe read what I replied to? ‚Äúpc master race my ass‚Äù Hmmm just maybe
---
It‚Äôs not.
---
Rank 1.
---
You can see next to leave button that it says X
---
That doesn‚Äôt make it switch.
---
Played a game of Hag yesterday, just prestiged, level one no add-ons only perk is Ruin 1
---
I get a nice four gen on Haddonfield and am doing really well with my web, and the traps are in areas that can vary enough to catch survivors off guard, but still be effective every time a survivor passes.
---
I missed one (1) Instant Teleport Hit, on a Dwight because Dead Hard. I then went on to 4k and he still had the audacity to tell me I wasn't a good Hag.
---
Well how does it make it mobile? Unless there like a controller you can use that changes the leave button looks.
---
I thought the shaggy one was jojo for a second because of the pose
---
Oh no, you pulled out the clown emoji. You've definitely won this argument.
---
Always assume they have borrowed time
---
So nea is a killer after all.
---
i don't wanna piss people off too badly, one time i got a message about a guy whos gf broke up with him and i made his day worse by killing him, felt like shit afterwards
---
That is awful.
---
Ok boomer. Clearly you live in another world. I can‚Äôt believe you actually got mad over this ‚Äúargument‚Äù which is literally a big ass r/woooosh moment.
---
Because up until a few moments ago, you were defending it like it wasn't a joke. Now you're backtracking because you realize what a dumbass you are.
---
True I've had this happen befores
---
It be like that.
---
This happened to me today. Of course it was a wraith. He had all hex perks lol
---
Not alone they are not. But when they coalesce into a Squadette, you never know what is going to happen.
---
You‚Äôre proving my point the more as you speak. I was defending the fact that pc has better graphics and performance. Not the ‚Äúascend with us‚Äù part and the other thing that you called me out for üôÑ
---
It's very op for survivors that know how to loop it correctly and balanced landing creates infinites on that map
---
Wow. Cringe joke *and* an attempted woooosh. You're not worth this lmao
---
I'm gonna have to go ahead and veto this whole thing.
---
Fine that works for me
---
Ffs stop with the woooosh shit, I'm cringing enough at you already
---
Dude you literally got r/woooosh ed. You literally can‚Äôt be talking. And you‚Äôre getting mad over what you claim ‚Äúa cringe joke‚Äù; something you claim isn‚Äôt worth your time but still get mad at it
---
meme level hemorrhage is one of those anime high pressure blood things. there was a bug like this a while back iirc. what would other meme-level effects be?
---
I‚Äôm cringing at the fact you‚Äôre getting so mad over something so small and think I‚Äôm actually serious dude.
---
The more code and shit they pile on, the more complicated it can become. An update doesnt necessarily mean fix. A lot of the time, fixing one problem presents another problem. It's always going to be a work in progress.
---
It's cute you think I'm mad in the slightest. It really is. Have fun jerking yourself off with your PC graphics, I'm gonna mute my notifications so I don't have to lose any more brain cells reading your comments.

This picture is freaking me out. I swear I can see the clown moving.
---
Tunneling, in the essence of targeting one survivor indefinitely throughout the whole match, is not ok. Chasing a survivor you saw unhooked that only needs one hit is
---
You're meant to protect each other ss survivors whenever possible. This includes protecting an injured survivors by bodyblocking them from possible harm.
---
Thanks.
---
As someone who plays PS4, nurse is genuinely godawful, even before her nerf. at least before then I had a chance to catch up if I was good, but now you can't even do that because of the recharge time. I wish they'd let us sell/lock out killers so you don't get their dailies anymore.
---
It‚Äôs pretty situational. If you are actively aiming for it, and don‚Äôt want to farm, then you could play normally but run the perk Left Behind (I think, the one that increases Gen repair speed when you‚Äôre the last one) and Wake Up. Also bring a toolbox. If it comes down to you and one other random, allow them to die on hook and get as much gen progress as you can while they‚Äôre on hook. 99% the gen, wait for them to die, and then just pop the last one and go for the gate. 
---
If you don‚Äôt want to leave your partner to die (although, if it‚Äôs down to two people, letting them die may be the right play anyway), then you can do it with SWF. Do the same strategy as above, but have your friends throw the game at the last gen. Basically, instead of letting the random die, you‚Äôre team is voluntarily giving themselves to the killer. Either that or, again with SWF, farm with a killer, and get the achievement that way.
---
All you get is a bloody cosmetic and you lose all your items and perks and start over. You do keep all of the teachables unlocked though.

Walrider wouldn‚Äôt work due to being overpowered, but lore wise could work since it would explain what happened to miles after outlast (they left it up in the air what EXACTLY happened to Miles, there‚Äôs some extra stuff outside the games but they don‚Äôt specify what happened to him in the end other than ‚Äúhe went to his home‚Äù and didn‚Äôt bring up what happened next, as he wasn‚Äôt home after some lore characters found this out) and he would use the Walrider to deal with survivors.
---
Chris only has a Mori, anything else is non existent.
---
Trager follows the same as Chris. However people would make Trager and clown best buddy memes due to his ‚Äúfingers first‚Äù approach.
---
The groom (Eddie Gluskin) wouldn‚Äôt happen for obvious reasons, and again only has a Mori. He would most likely try to ‚Äúapproach‚Äù the actual women in DbD, and not just the survivors. He would approach huntress, plague, spirit, you name it.
---
That weird freakish cannibal duo in outlast 2 would work too, perhaps more effectively than Marta. Small one has a better viewpoint and can see survivors better while the brutish lower half does all the hard work.
---
The cannibal who chased Parker in whistleblower would just be a crappier hag, having only a Mori that‚Äôs just less interesting than hag‚Äôs. Maybe he could sniff out survivor‚Äôs using a new form of tracking, where a scent mist leads you down the exact movements of a survivor? Basically a killer all about tracking.
---
The twins would be two separate skins for the same killer but their only gimmick would be ‚Äúno terror radius‚Äù. That‚Äôs it. No terror radius. Also they would need pants. NEED. PANTS. The only way to tell if the twin was near would be by phrases like  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm want your tongue. I‚Äôm going to take your liver. I‚Äôll kill you slowly.‚Äù Their Mori would just be them grabbing a survivor, shanking them in the liver, ripping it out by jamming a hand through the wound, then cutting out their tongue and taking that too, leaving them to bleed out as they put the tongue and liver in their pockets. In exchange for no terror radius they would be one of the more slower killers.
---
Ty, we will just wait outnthe 40 seconds
---
I swing when DS is imminent just to essentially let them know I know about DS. That only ever happens if I‚Äôm being lazy and can‚Äôt be bothered to wait it out, or if it‚Äôs tactical for a perk to make them my new obsession, so I swing to look like less of an idiot getting hit by DS
---
Finally, someone of taste.
---
It‚Äôs actually 60 seconds
---
Is it now? I'll have to reread it
---
I havent noticed the maggots, lol
---
Enlighten me
---
I‚Äôm just saying this because I‚Äôve gone against 3 killers who have done this. One was Bubba, another The Doctor, and the other one a Huntress. It made me kinda cringe
---
The Huntress was the one who dribbled me
---
Thana, sloppy, nurses, ruin.
---
Don't bother with stalking really just use your stealth to get hits and cut chases short and to mind game
---
It‚Äôs 40 seconds at Tier 1, 50 at Tier 2, and 60 at Tier 3
---
I never even thought about extra exposure. I feel pretty dumb now
---
*Unzips hostage doc*
---
I got tunneled and never got a chance to heal at all but still got it so idk what's with that one lol
---
There's no killer meta perks
---
o h
---
If you watch some decent-and-above killers stream on www.twitch.tv, you will see that they win the overwhelming majority of their countless matches, regularly rather decisively and effortlessly. You might learn a thing or two from it. First of all that it is not impossible and that you can improve.
---
His cosmetics are kinda cool. Don‚Äôt prestige Nancy... they are so bad.
---
hes a strong boy
---
Reminds me of a Wraith Game I had just before reset. I fucking went apeshit on most of the survivors and there‚Äôs one Nancy who bless her heart was trying. Now it‚Äôs she and I with 4 gens left. I find the hatch and just invisicamp it. I message her (PS4) and tell her ‚ÄúDo the rest of the event gens for BP and open the gate. I want the hatch so any item you leave with is yours.‚Äù 
---
About five minutes later, she‚Äôs getting the last gen and I went to make a coffee, and I find two medkits and a flashlight at my feet as tribute. I almost cried I was so happy.
---
You also have a better chance of finding rarer items in the blood web.
---
this is super predictable and often buys me another loop tbh
---
This is the exact same thing im dealing with as well, rank 11 and i just cant enjoy this game at all lately.
---
hillbilly is one of the most balanced killers honestly
---
Bagpipes
---
that nancy sounds adorable
---
I only prestige if the first 50 levels were full of perks that I didn't like. if I end up getting barbecue and chili 3 before level 50 I'm sure as hell not prestiging that because I know my next prestige I'm going to struggle getting that knowing my luck.
---
I love how you can clearly see that the aura on the hook is bill
---
True surveillance is pretty useful and whispers
---
R/woosh
---
Spirit bad
---
That‚Äôs sad, but that has nothing to do with you don‚Äôt feel bad about that. Not your fault he got dumped, not your fault he decided to play DBD to make him feel better of all games.
---
@-@
---
That's true, I'm just an empathetic person is all
---
as long as it isn't a master challenge
---
Honestly I am still confused as to why there isnt a casual mode for the game. The ranks dont seem to have any specific benefits and dont even give you any rewards outside of the aforementioned toxicity. It would be incredibly dope to have a casual mode just so then you can grind for BP, or try out a new killer without getting completely --mauled-- stalled by survivors armed with purple flashlights, level 3 meta perks and swf.
---
The council will now decide your fate.
---
overused meme
---
I don't remember BHVR expressing their "love" for fnaf, what are you talking about?
---
The clown is the thickest bai
---
Being empathetic doesn‚Äôt mean you gotta let people take advantage of your empathy and guilt trip you over something you didn‚Äôt cause lol. But I feel you
---
Yeah...
---
Its not a love but they expressed an "interest" on adding a FNAF chapter
---
Not only are corners dangerous but you also waste a shitload of time going to and from them
---
Well, then high rank people would play that and get matched with low ranks just testing out the game. I think he ranking system is mostly just to try and group together skill levels, not so much reward people.
---
The better chance is a very small amount, it's not some substantial thing. Last I heard it was .5% increase per prestige
---
when this happens I just type "lol" or something similar to piss them off more
---
It‚Äôs the GhostFace reveal trailer
---
Thats what i did too lol
---
legion has a great character design but poorly designed gameplay
---
For survivor better teammates (sometimes) and for killer I don‚Äôt.
---
Sounds fun, but it would probably need to be a very rare/ultra rare add on
---
I think the downside to it is the same reason as to why people at high ranks dislike self care. Both Urban Evasion and Self Care are, on paper, both simple effects that are completely 100% beneficial to have in your build. The problem is the habits they promote are often detrimental to the team in that you are more focused on staying out of the action more often than not, which usually means you aren't on gens or in chase with the killer, the 2 main things a survivor should be doing to be useful to the team.
---
This is where one would provide links to back up their claims, because I‚Äôve certainly never seen them express interest in this
---
Why can‚Äôt the function of the ranking system be to group together people of the same skill AND reward people for ranking up? There are so many successful games with ranking systems that reward you at the end of the month. 
---
Not saying they need to throw us a party for hitting high ranks, but literally ANYTHING would be better than nothing we don‚Äôt even get bloodpoints for it, it just seems like bad design to me personally
---
I wanted to back this up by saying that in dev stream #84, one of the speakers they had Sarah - UI Designer, was asked what video game chapters would you like to see added to the game, to which she replied "Five Nights at Freddies"
---
just cleanse bro
---
Yeah for real. My p3 steve has gotten 1 bps and 4 escape cakes after leveling him a fuck ton. It keeps giving me bullshit lol
---
A causal mode would be a great quality of life improvement (which bhvr almost NEVER adds to the game) 
---
I‚Äôm honestly surprised we even got archives, which is a pretty decent quality of life improvement. But I agree we definitely need some sort of casual mode that‚Äôs not the fucking PTB lol
---
You have to also double pip now in order to get the achievements at least for the newer killers. You also can‚Äôt use a mori.
---
I prefer the REAL entity. &lt;nea&gt;
---
:l
---
People complain a lot about his add on combinations/rarities, and although I do not believe a full on nerf should be a priority at all, a look over his add ons to bring him to current speed/standards of rarity/quantity as newer killers should be good
---
Which lore bit is this from?
---
Sounds more like a reference to the Entity being Lovecraftian
---
My problem with this one is that everyone seems to be going out of their way not to let me heal them. Like bitch you wanna die?
---
Same for me on my p3 kate, I just want bps for people
---
I feel like a full rework should be done. Not only is he extremely weak, but I feel like it's a waste of such a good concept with multiple killers.
---
Insidious Bubba is easy. Sure, it sucks if you're the one sitting on the hook, but that's the game. Forever Freddy makes you feel like doing gens is pointless because they go so slowly. At least Insidious Bubba the game goes by quickly, whether you're on the hook or not.
---
What you really want is to find that sweet spot with the ranking system. On the survivor side if you're in green/yellow ranks then you'll frequently get put on teams where you run the killer around, get downed, and then see that everyone was aimlessly wandering around or hiding in a bush clear across the map the whole time. 
---
Once you're in red ranks though you start to get the killers who take the game super seriously where anything short of a 4K was a complete failure that leaves them questioning why they play, as well as the survivors who DC every time the killer dares to hit them.
---
I've found that purple ranks is the best bet for finding survivors and killers who know what they're doing, but they can also relax a little and enjoy the game.
---
But that then means that even if a survivor/killer that got the game is doing well, then they'll keep going down through ranks, till eventually their forced to get into matches where if their playing killer, then they'll get sent up against either a full or 3/4 swf with high level perks and items, along with coordination against a player that is still learning how the game works. And unless there with friends, they will probably get sent against a killer that they dont know completely that could absolutely stomp them, such as a good spirit, a good/great nurse, ghostface etc.

Stabby bois and girls for your viewing pleasure!
---
I think hillbilly, huntress and nurse should be in the shitty circumstances category because Hillbilly was physically deformed not mentally deformed and was severely abused from birth so if given good parents he would‚Äôve an been ok. 
---
The huntress was a small child when her mom was killed so her perceived lack of intelligence isn‚Äôt even a lack of real intelligence it‚Äôs really a lack of education and psychological development because if she can throw hatchets good enough to where it‚Äôs an effective killing weapon she has to have a decent base understanding of math/geometry because throwing hatches at moving targets while moving yourself requires an understanding of angles, distance, throwing technique, etc so her perceived lack of intelligence is because she like the hillbilly are feral people and she‚Äôs powered only by predatory instinct not because of mental illnesses.
---
The nurse was forced to work in an insane asylum which in a fate of irony made herself go insane was because of lack of job opportunities for women in her day, and because her husband died so she couldn‚Äôt afford to not take that job.
---
TL;DR like the people in the shitty circumstances category if the hillbilly had better parents, the huntresses mother survived or if she wasn‚Äôt born in the Siberian wilderness to begin with, and if the nurse‚Äôs husband would have survived or if she was born in the 21st century, they all would have been functioning member of society and not killers controlled by an ancient evil spider god.

DS, MoM, BT, BNP, Instaheals, exhaustion mechanics, pallet vacuums, flashlight blinds
---
Look at the other side too mate, playing the victim so much must be exhausting
---
Edit: also self care, and gen speed stacking, window vaults too
---
why does every decent clip need to be overedited with dead memes and obnoxious music
---
I‚Äôve fucked up trying to use balanced on that thing many times
---
Using Monstrous Shrine saves an entire 10.8 seconds but only in the basement. Totally worth using /s
---
You get a better chance of getting quality games with fun killers and goofballs, and less facecampers / tryhards in purples. It‚Äôs the best spot to be in, why wouldn‚Äôt you want to rank up to be there?
---
This art style is nice to see with my eyeballs
---
You shouldn't be walking really. I flat out said in my comment:
---
&gt;People who use it often don't know when they should be sprinting or when they should be walking.
---
Imagine playing a game and not actually trying to play. 
---
What kind of loser waste their time on something then says I don‚Äôt actually care about it.
---
Unfortunately there's a lot of places in this game, specifically when certain windows spawn and such, or places like this, that you have to walk away from. Unfortunately BHVR is too busy with making new shit to fix things like this.
---
Apparently it is a bug and should probably be fixed...sometime.
---
There are 2 tips for u:
---
1. Use Bamboozle;
---
2. Don't chase loopers.
---
If this "dweet" is the last one, u catch them anyway.
---
I just lost gallons booty raping survivors in their tight cheeks...gotta replenish to think more clearly üòà
---
Why on earth would you do this, or even want to?  You're a killer....killlleerrrrrr.  Kill them.  It boggles my mind the number of recent threads popping up with so called killer mains bemoaning not being able to "be nice" to the survivors.  These are the same survivors that teabagged, flashlighted the entire match, and said "gg ez kys" in the end lobby.  The fuck are you people smoking?
---
Sure, let's all just mentally try and assume and figure out what challenge someone is doing every game and all be friends. I agree :)
---
Hey it me
---
Atm people are spamming it to do their challenges so i will take advantage
---
My question is more directed at the people who are already at a decent rank but still feel the need to try hard every game and act toxic when they lose
---
Stats say that LF and Monsterous Shrine are incredibly strong and constantly used, so we've decided to nerf both.
---
We balance our game based on statistics, and ignore the variables!
---
Now now, let‚Äôs not jump to any conclusions
---
you do realize that offerings are burned in the Campfire right?
---
Just accept the survivors full 1 minute of invincibility like men
---
Actually I'm pretty sure they never got the chance to go to college.
---
and then The Demogorgon is Mace Windu by annihilating his head
---
There's nothing worse than the main house of Haddonfield with Balanced Landing. That infinite is simply ridiculous.
---
The stun challenge isn't too bad. If you have a killer who is respecting pallets then you should be trying to drop the pallet when they don't expect it. Say a killer is near you but doesn't know where you are, you should hide behind a pallet and when they walk through it BAM out of nowhere lol. 
---
Also if you're being chased try running through the pallet and acting like you're not going to drop it, then back track a little to throw it when they start walking through thinking you're not going to drop it.
---
No you can pick them up or ignore them if you want. Just know that swinging and dribbling don‚Äôt affect ds anymore
---
That's a baseless statement. Even ignoring that I disagree with it from a pure gameplay perspective, you seem to be implying that the players you often face do not make mistakes and are perfect, yet that the players those streamers face make so many mistakes all the time that despite the game apparently being impossibly survivor-sided, they demolish survivors all the time regularly with multiple gens left up. Which is more than ridiculous especially considering that they most likely play many times as much as you do, and thus also meet many times as many opponents as you do.
---
Some people play games competitively, solely for the purpose of being the best they can be at it. Red ranks is where the competitive players are, just trying to improve as much as possible and win as much as they can.
---
&gt;why the hell is it so popular.
---
nice question
---
He‚Äôs talking about the varieties and reasons for camping. The ‚ÄúIDV‚Äù that he mentions is a mobile game called identity V, which is basically brushed mobile dbd featuring coraline esque characters. It plays really well and I use it when I can‚Äôt play dbd, but it has a much less toxic community and he‚Äôs talking about the differences in them I think
---
This happens to me to but it came back in the next game, I missed my ds to a camping killer because of this :(
---
nO OnE. LiTeRallY No oNe. noT A sOuL.

---
Evan‚Äôs father: I DONT REMEMBER ASKIN YOU A GOD DAMN THING
---
If the Entity isn't blocking it that's on you not keeping up vision properly. Also almost every killer as far as I know can lunge onto the hay bales which is usually enough to scare survivors off. The Harvesters are annoying but they sure as hell arent broken.
---
Well you run into survivors who don't act like toxic shitters sometimes. This is mainly a feature so if a survivor is being screwed over by their team being idiots the killer can choose to show a bit of mercy if they wish and step in. I've been on the receiving end of hitting stage 2 or even first hook death when I'm not being camped because the rest of my team are crouching across the map. When it happens as killer it's also a bit frustrating esp if bloody party streamers were burned.
---
It'd be something that's completely optional. Killers can already give the hatch, choose to only mori people on death hook when they're dead anyway, etc.
---
Likewise if survivors are being shitters I can choose tunnel and mori off first hook, camp, etc. Even as a killer who thinks he's toxic (I love running asshole builds sometimes like anti-skillcheck doc with a jigsaw piece, Franklin's trap-the-items hag, or bringing a mori for a .ttv etc. Hell I'm a Doctor main and that should tell you enough about the type of player I am) I only dish out what I take. I don't run around facecamping people for no reason besides endgame collapse when I need to secure kills, etc.
---
35 Free pass I kinda suck I just play a lot
---
Not every survivor is toxic
---
No that isn't the case its literally the fucking broken loop that he can easily hide in and I lose chase and once I get back into it the Entity still won't block it its that fuckin broken.
---
A casual mode would be great. If they add this though i think they should put a reward system in ranked mode so the higher ranks can sweat and feel rewarded and be dissuaded from sweating in casual mode.
---
What I don't understand is why people quit at the end of the game if they get hooked. Why waste that 15-20k?
---
Lmao nice. Nice meme dude.
---
Freddy with a dumb amount of slowdown perks. Ruin, Thanatophobia, Dying Light, Pop Goes the Weasel and his add-ons that slow progress down for each survivor in the dream world
---
i could record a game and send it to them, cheers!

I think it should affect all hooks or be like WGLF of sorts where you get bonus points for basement hooks/sacrifices. It could work as a "Poor Man's BBQ" for point farming since it's not a teachable.
---
Dont forget complaints.
---
If the five gens are done the killer can camp its stupid believe that he is going to do other thing
---
An All Time Classic.
---
Theres a ton of god loops that need to go. This game is at its best when the survivor and killer can both mind game a loop ie. faking vaults and moonwalking, its at its worst with these braindead god loops. There are too many of these where survivors can run to and feel absolutely safe and you have no choice but to give up chase.
---
In all honesty I feel like there should be a reward, like a bunch of indecent shards as rewards for ranks, that way at least theres a reason to use meta perks/killers instead of flexing ranks. Any other game I see that has a ranked mode or something akin to it gives out a reward, ie the gold weapons in overwatch, rare ornaments in for honor, the special skins for each season in mk11.
---
YOU DAMN KILLERS, DON'T **DARE** TOUCH MY BLOODPOINT FOOTBALL!
---
Hitboxes?
---
Yep.
---
Frank was the oldest one and he was a senior the night they stabbed the janitor
---
And the chances of scape are lower
---
As fucked up as this sounds, it's probably what I'm going to be doing. I only did basement bubba for chest protecting and without any real intent to actually hook and insidious camp people. Sadly this challenge (If not changed, since some in Tome 2 were changed from when they were datamined) will mean I'm going to actually be insidious basement camping people.
---
A killer carried me to the hatch today so I left him my god flashlight as a thank you. I still have a bunch more because toxic flashlight meta.
---
Step 1. Invite survivors to hangout and chill at your basement party  
---
Step 2. Make the necessary preparations before your guests arrive  
---
Step 3. Cherish the small amount of time you have together with your new friends
---
This challenge is quite easy just stand under a pallet and wait until the killer hits you to drop the pallet. Then you can heal and do it again or stand under another pallet after he injures you, wait for the swing and dead hard in place then drop the pallet. Hope this helps
---
Yeah you're right. Just thinking of their personalities though.
---
A disturbed soul trapped in an animatronic sounds like a cool killer concept. How would his power work?
---
right ahha
---
Every uses Ruin, NOED, and BBQ and Chili. It's kind of boring.
---
&gt;Overall, Ash's perks are effective when used successfully, but they are hard to utilize regularly.
---
As they should be. It's like Unbreakable: a powerful ability that probably won't come in use all that often, but is powerful when it does. It's a flip of the coin, as is running most perks in DBD. Powerful abilities shouldn't be that easy to pull off.
---
Overused topic too
---
‚ÄúEverything is camping/tunneling to survivor mains‚Äù ‚ÄúSurvivor Rulebook for killers‚Äù like damn, it‚Äôs the same jokes in the same rotating meme formats every fucking day
---
Then you see someone get injured. Survivors: Nah. Let's just stay.
---
i posted this like 6 times
---
It's good on nurse if you suck ass, as it makes you fatigue earlier after a miss
---
There's a possible mind-game where you swing at the pallet early, which makes the survivor take another loop, but thanks to unrelenting you can catch up to them, but numbers are a tiny bit too low for it to work most of the time
---
Still terrible tho
---
Epstein:
---
I suppose there is that - but those people are still going to DC anyway, just 2x as much. Ruining 2x as many matches. I don't think ruining more matches helps anyone. The husks will help tho.

If Chris could tank pallets but still go super slow, he would literally just be stunned like normal but his view wouldn‚Äôt get messed up. You can still move when staggered by pallets, albeit barely. Chris would also be useless in window loops. This is why he wouldn‚Äôt work. His Mori would also be too difficult to program for obvious reasons. (Ripping heads off). Also certain perks are based around pallets but become entirely useless as a result if he just ranks the pallets. His ‚Äúgo through a pallet‚Äù is just spirit fury, which makes spirit fury pointless if equipped, for example. Brutal strength also has no use on him because you just ram into the pallets anyway as it is.
---
Anyway for the duo, I could see that work, but he would need ammo located in new objects located on the map that he picks the arrows out of. Survivors can sabotage the ammo containers by throwing the arrows out as if they were erasing a demogorgon tunnel. The duo only carries 5 arrows. The arrows make the target bleed more, move slower, and can‚Äôt be healed until it is removed. It takes 5 seconds to remove said arrow but removing it inflicts lethal wound status effect or whatever the orange ‚Äúbleed out‚Äù meter in DbD is called. Shooting a survivor with an arrow if they are wounded already either by arrow or by melee swing will down them.
---
Mad Grit is amazing tho
---
Surge would be great with a bit more range and working on any down
---
Fair. It would be pretty niche except with those two perks.
---
f
---
Being territorial with trapper can be set up via corrupt intervention (and yes he is still weak but not AS weak)
---
Clown at least forces pallet breaks, unlike legion, who usually has to run the full loop because frenzy doesn‚Äôt down or contribute to downing in a meaningful way like a bottle slowdown does.
---
Legion can injure everybody, yes. But after that? He becomes an M1 killer with no power worth using, still as loopable as before. 
---
Not only that, The Plague can do the same injure stall but better. Survivors are left broken, and they can heal if they wanted to, but cleansing it actively empowers her. If you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre easier to find due to the sickness.
---
I play Doctor, Trapper, and Legion, and Legion is easily the one that struggles the most to do anything to competent survivors in most cases.
---
I only sub to streamers or youtubers that are consistent
---
I accidentally got matched up with a friend playing killer and we agreed to meet at shack. we found each other immediately and started t bagging, and watching my teammates lose their minds until they realized what was happening was PRICELESS. Made our nights.
---
What do you consider consistent? An example for both platforms would be highly appreciated
---
I dont think I've ever done it. I feel so bad, cause if someone did it to me I'd be pretty pissed off. But then I die 99% of the time .
---
I mean, Forever Freddy you can still get BP from playing the game, and at teh very least get 16,000 bp so while the game wasn't entirely enjoyable, it wasn't wasted.
---
Insidious Bubba? You either kill yourself on hook and screw your team over or you get max 8k bp and waste your time. At least with Freddy you're still running around and capable of actually doing things.
---
I'm not saying that Forever Freddy isn't an issue, to be certain. I'd just rather go against that then Insidious Bubba.
---
I respect that I've been trying to stream at least 5 days a week and I ve been uploading a lot more recently too but again ur decision thanks for commenting üòÅ
---
I love how there are the three being edgy and then theres Julie just laughing at these moods of human beings! Also a to google what SMDB stood for üëå
---
Honestly as snotty as this sounds I have multiple outlets that I check daily to look for new music with this genre (Shout out to /r/Metalcore not surprising they down-voted it)  and this fell under my radar. I just dont think it was talked enough and just went unnoticed sadly :(.
---
Along the same lines but a bit less memey
---
"Lisa's Cookbook" Hex Totems spawn closer to each other
---
I had a game full of Nancy's with toolboxes and I was playing Billy on Larry's and they 3 gened them self's
---
So not only have you apparently stalked my profile, you've made a false claim lmao. I've got mental issues I ain't denying that. But a superiority complex isn't one of them. I'm just saying that just because some people don't give two shits about swearing, doesn't mean they lack self respect
---
hard same
---
For youtube streaming. . 4 -5 days a week....loading content scattered through........Twitch streamers...5 days a week because everybody that's on Twitch is trying to get partnered or just make a lot of money from subs.....so that means you gotta bust your ass for it.
---
Killer gets stunned
---
GF : *sexy sigh*

I just hate the huntress is downsized so much. Shes my giant mommy.
---
I would say clown for pop, but that‚Äôs just me
---
51, in the paid path
---
Man, killer mains sure are bitching a lot...you guys want it to be so easy.
---
it will stop working once you rank up
---
God I wish I could find these people in real life and just beat them into an inch of their life like seriously telling someone to kill the selves over a video game what and absolute waste of a human being all of them are pathetic and deserve to be fucking left alone in a ditch
---
Look at his belly button and you'll see
---
You also gain objective points for searching chests. Are you doing that every match?
---
Devs said they plan on eventually making it so when a D/C happens the survivors body stays sp the killer can hook it or mori it and so on.
---
Who knows lol. The minds of some people are nothing more than an enigma.
---
Strictly limited between these two options, clown is the obvious choice, but I‚Äôm curious why you don‚Äôt want to hear other suggestions?
---
&gt; The cannibal who chased Parker in whistleblower would just be a crappier hag, having only a Mori that‚Äôs just less interesting than hag‚Äôs. Maybe he could sniff out survivor‚Äôs using a new form of tracking, where a scent mist leads you down the exact movements of a survivor? Basically a killer all about tracking.
---
I dunno about that one; The Wraith's perks are all about making him extremely good at Tracking and none of those perks see play at all (And I've seen some guides even recommend never unlocking his perks so as to not dilute the pool).
---
Dweet the president? Absolute madness
---
No
---
May I suggest waiting until the new chapter just in case. (Well obviously a downvote)
---
But if that‚Äôs a no then definitely clown. He‚Äôs got pop and bamboozle.
---
Because she is overpowered,  dummy. Why you think everybody is using her so fucking much ?? Because they see that there's an imbalance and she always had the upper hand.....literally just ruined game experience for everybody...dont mention the fact that ppl wait for hours just to get into a damn lobby. And god forbid it disconnects..
---
Dear god.
---
Samara
---
Back when they reworked Trapper, Wraith and Hag, they said that they want every killer to have two ultra rares. Every killer that doesn't have 2 ultra rares will get an add-on rework some day
---
Bubba, Billy, Doctor and Huntress are left from what I'm aware
---
BUUUUT if the killer comes back immediately then you're fucked
---
Also among Redditors, it seems very common to just upvote or downvote something (regardless of context) if someone else has already done cast a vote on it.
---
I believe around 33, and I got the paid pass.
---
This is where the ama tomorrow is right?
---
Lol ok so, dont feed trolls like this
---
Clown has some great perks but the Clown himself is pretty mediocre. Pebble is fun for memes and Autodidact is fun in altruistic builds, but Adam‚Äôs best perk by far is Deliverance.
---
I‚Äôd recommend Clown because Pop is an amazing perk but you can‚Äôt go wrong either way.
---
Wait what
---
And this.
---
This is what I like
---
How so? I‚Äôve had an issue recently where every endgame summary will give me a disconnected from client but that‚Äôs only happened in the last few days. But I don‚Äôt know what else your problem could be? Queue time?
---
Just googled it it‚Äôs one of Adams perks
---
No Mither is OP
---
It counters:
---
Bubba, Billy, Plague, Legion, Myers, Ghost Face, Trapper's pink add-on, Huntress' Iriheads, NOED, MYC, Haunted Ground, Iron Maiden, Devour, Sloppy, Stridor, Coulrophobia, A Nurse's Calling, and Remember Me.
---
It also makes it so you don't have to be healed after an unhook, makes many perks always active and makes it so the killer can't slug you for the 4k.
---
This is mad outdated but you guys should check out Ussylis anyways he‚Äôs pretty good
---
I thought that was a Nea?
---
Haha, I just ended the night with a 4k on this map and more traps than I can remember. Such a great map for him.
---
She makes wormholes through space so she could also warp through time

I‚Äôm just tired of hearing about meta bullshit, I‚Äôm a purple rank legion main that doesn‚Äôt meta perks (except discordance) I‚Äôm a purple rank survivor main  who doesn‚Äôt run meta perks because it‚Äôs annoying and boring, I knew if I didn‚Äôt put that message in brackets I‚Äôd likely get at least one comment telling me to buy a different character for a meta perk
---
Thank you for being smug instead of considering criticism!
---
I don't know why the hatchet disappeared before it hit, but that was definitely a solid throw.
---
Joey is a fucking  m o o d
---
forgot to add hearing injured survivors turning the mind-game into "hope you're on the right side of the window, if there's one around that is"
---
Uhhh, he was definitely behind the wall when it hit.
---
Don't buy this game on the switch. As of 11/17 it still has massive FPS issues in docked and handheld. I'm not even one to usually care about fps issues but I have died and missed so many skill checks because of the choppiness.
---
I mean fair enough I guess, best of luck to you in your future matches
---
I respect your opinion.
---
This wall of text could use a lot of formatting
---
oops
---
And his traps can be sabotaged and they are affected by luck...
---
I get that you like the franchise, but one person does not speak for the entire studio as a whole.
---
He‚Äôs not being smug. If you‚Äôve got nothing good to say then don‚Äôt say it at all.
---
You don't have to do it, but it's like an act of kindness. Comparable to buying a meal for a beggar, but on a much lesser extent.
---
K
---
I don't really give hatch much as a killer (just being honest) but when I am a survivor I notice they usually give it to the worst people i s2g.
---
Yesterday, I found out what tier 3 on him means.. :(
---
Let the accusations of tunneling commence!!
---
or sniper doc
---
He is being smug, and I did have something good to say. That's why I said it.

(As long as you were never banned at any point)
---
Oh no, how could I possibly do these *BASE GAME OBJECTIVES* over a decently long period of playtime and not absolutely lose my mind. I mean seriously, complete gEnERatOrS? Wtf. Heal other survivors? Breaks the whole damn game IMO.
---
I think the way most people talk about Bitter Murmur in this thread on killer, I think of Streetwise as survivor. Very underrated and powerful perk when using items. Using Streetwise with a Commodius and Instructions/Wire addons means you will have a toolbox you can use for 5 gens by yourself if needed. Also good with flashlights and maps. Especially potent in SWF where more than one person can get the benefit and you can combo it up with Leader for the ultimate gen rush.
---
When I do SWF, I sometimes run what I called a Paladin build (because auras lol) with Streetwise, Leader and Vigil along with whatever exhaustion perk I feel like (usually Balanced Landing).
---
Because it's basically a worse version of Rancor.
---
I played Kotal just for that move as well. Once that got old I just wrecked shit as Leatherface in online. *Ah, how I miss being the 3rd best Leatherface player in the world.*

I just realized how badly I want a Vicious Cycle SFM series for DbD

My friend I have some bad news for you if you keep playing.

As a killer main, the best counter to a good looper is just leaving them alone and hunting down their teammates
---
Interesting - thanks for your input. How long do you expect those 5 streams on twitch to be?
---
Pressure sensitive keyboards are a god sent for us to use them in occasions like these.
---
Tier 48, Paid Pass
---
Almost comleted the second tome level too
---
I don‚Äôt think this would be a good idea, it would bring weird types of players like people who make plays about FNAF. Then no one else would play DBD if those people join. FNAF is stupid af imo and it shouldn‚Äôt be added.
---
I can't decipher the meaning behind this post
---
Literate humans who read reddit posts and respond to them?  Yah we're everywhere, good job on sussing that out, champ.
---
Just proving my point further lol, have fun man
---
I really don't wanna read these comments
---
If you aren‚Äôt running for a good chunk of the match you probably aren‚Äôt as good at survivor as you think you are.
---
UE is severely outclassed by less passive perks that aid during chases and unhooking.
---
still not the worst hatchet of all time, hitboxes might need fix, but dedicated servers weren't the problem there too.
---
I did it you guys! A michael meyers with a ping of 2000 and the aim of Estelle Getty!
---
The Devs have said they want to rework ranked with rewards, it's part of the year 4 roapmap, so we can expect it hopefully within the next 6-8 months.
---
Yeah I get those. But mainly when I join which to me indicates a lobby dodge (I play with two mates and usually see a lot of dodging).
---
10 mins?! That‚Äôs my longest wait time for a killer queue. That‚Äôs pretty crazy.
---
So you're the dude who constantly posts furry porn on here...Jesus
---
Its actually nea lol
---
"AH, HE'S PUNCTURING ME! ...Please, be gentle. This is my ninth time this week."
---
Problem with adding a second mode is it splits the playerbase up. I too would appreciate a casual mode, but then you'll get drastically longer queue times.
---
This captures the essence of getting killed in one hook while your teammates self care in a corner
---
Find a sensitivity for you and honestly practice my man. Gotta struggle to succeed
---
That would be like Doctor, wouldn't it? Also running into the problem that at higher ranks Survivors aren't hard to find?
---
I see! I personally dislike Legion just because getting found (even when I play enough to hit red ranks before reset, which happens about every other reset for me personally) feels pretty cheap if I'm not running Bond to track all the other survivors, someone leads him to me, I step into his TR for half a second (or he is running addons to push it beyond the TR) for someone else's mistake doesn't really engage me.
---
Though while I do play Killer (less frequently out of frustration for the role's pretty sad condition, especially if you're not going full-meta top-tier tryhard, but still) I can't really play Legion, because on top of being colorblind in the red spectrum, I have to deal with Legion inflicting what is essentially blindness on themselves (also why I don't really play Nurse, tbh, given that she looked at the ground - but Legion has it worse) and it removes even chance I have of tracking; also Legion's Killing Instinct marker is really hard to spot/see at any reasonable distance.
---
So most of my Legion-related experience is what he feels like to play against and a few friends who love him and stab me a ton in KYF.
---
Just because you are bad guy does not mean you are.... bad... guy
---
Huntress is a lot of mind games and baiting. You can use your hatchet to herd survivors into cover and trap them in corners. With huntress at lower ranks the pallet drop is an easy hatchet hit, just remember to lift a hatchet as your coming around the corner and dont get stunned.
---
A cute human bloodsucking alien.
---
Coo'.
---
Indeed. And it's my job to hook and sacrifice you. Unfortunately your job is much easier than mine.
---
**~~Crawling - Linkin Park~~**
---
??? who said anything about dedicated servers, or that being the worst hatchet of all time?
---
WhErEs My BaTtErIeS
---
I had the same issue then realized it‚Äôs because they introduced Bill on PS4 and it locked the perk down for any character that didn‚Äôt already have it. Felt a bit dumb.
---
Is there a sensitivity you recommend or is it something I need to find that works for me?
---

Unfortunately I have to work for a living and I don't have a lot of time to play games.  Does it make me a sweaty nerd because I want to spend the few games I get to play ACTUALLY playing the game?  Believe me, I would definitely take more time to mess around if I could but it's just not enjoyable to sit through a 10 minute queue, sit in lobby just for someone to DC, rinse and repeat, and then finally get a game just to have a couple of people screwing around the whole match.
---
&gt;The majority of streamer's skins will stay exclusive
---
What skins are you talking about? The only ones I can think about are about 3 or 4: KINGKONGTV / PANDATV / DIATECH. What are the others?
---
"Personal"
---
I fucking lost it.
---
Kinda wish they would address this issue already, Bamboozle perk is on the same list because I highly assume it shares the same beneficial issue. Imagine having Bloodlust 3 for this crudfest and still not reaching one person abusing a loop. This is even more annoying on Haddonfield fence windows.
---
very true
---
As the great tru3 once said ‚Äúfeel my pipe!‚Äù
---
Do you have a lot of free time playing killer?
---
I don't say it should've hit, but we all know that there is a bunch of stuff that needs to get fixed. Right now I'm just saying that in the DbD universe, it's a possible hit.
---
I feel like connection and hitboxes are running better on consoles, because it's mostly PC that seems to have those issues, so I'm never really having problems or reasons to complain. But we also don't have dedicated servers rn aswell. 
---
We all know and just sometimes forget about how everything gets covered up with skins, events and new content, they're actually having issues with. Who knows if the hitboxes ever get worked on lmao. But until then, complaining about things this whole subreddit and probably BHVR too, knows about won't help anyone.
---
Technicaly yes but actuely no
---
I did for a short while but I don't have a video card in my pc and the frames are literally 7fps. 10 tops. Integrated graphics suck. Got a refund on steam. Saving it for when I can get a graphics card.
---
Monstrous Shrine surprisingly years later worked out with against Ace Visconti's perk Up the Ante...
---
Or overall Luck offerings, in return it does counter them well and combined Deliverance. (100% chance doesn't always guarantees you an escape).
---
&gt; so while the game wasn't entirely enjoyable, it wasn't wasted
---
Matter of perspective. I'll explain below.
---
&gt; You either kill yourself on hook and screw your team over or you get max 8k bp and waste your time.
---
Here's the problem. To start, survivors have a baseline distaste for death, particularly if it's done in a fashion they don't find palatable. 
---
As a baseline thing, survivors have to get over that. The feeling of "I didn't get to do much" is just one of those things you have to deal with in this game. Everyone seems to understand CoD to some degree, so the equivalent would be calling things like S&amp;D unfair because there's no respawn. Sometimes you're the first one dead after spawning, that's just how it goes sometimes.
---
Moving on, the beauty of going against InsidiousFace is that you have no real investment into the outcome of the game. You try your ass off, do nearly every gen, but the minute you get chased, nobody can do anything but hide in a gen. You end up dying with a bad taste in your mouth because you feel like your hard work wasn't rewarded. Or maybe you don't, but the point stands.
---
On the other hand, if you're stuck there with Bubba just holding his chainsaw waiting for you to die, you can guarantee that your team is going to be surviving (that is, if they're not suicidal altruistic imbeciles). In that case, you're losing the couple minutes it takes to die, a pip, and the chance at roughly 10-20k points. If you're still not maxed or need stuff from your webs, it certainly can be annoying; however, the frequency at which this occurs is very low, though people tend to only remember the times they were Insidious camped.
---
lmao thats wholesome
---
You're a nice guy
---
I hope you do the same with claudette farmer
---
I never thought I would still see people crusading for cashier Carl. 
---
DEVS I know you can hear me
---
They were free from the start you just had to have codes. People that payed 100+ just for the codes just for bragging rights there fault.
---
Got me good mate I'll give you that
---
Go to YouTube.
---
Because until now, people have actually either earned, got extremely lucky or have simply spent big amounts of money on exclusives, proving they actually cared about them. Soon though, every player will simply just get them for free, with zero work or care
---
They don‚Äôt prevent you from getting the achievement. You have to double pip as ghost face to get the adept achievement.
---
I just mean if this not the last guy and u know there is a hard place to chase, why u still chase him? I also don't think that writing posts on reddit with "difficult chases, pls nerf everything" is most effective method to play for killer.
---
Where are you guys from and what platform are you on?
---
I never got such childish messages. The worst I ever got as a killer was "ez".
---
Leave thicc Jane alone.
---
Event skins i agree with , these  should stay exclusive but people who got lucky with getting Codes should not cry about these skins being free to everybody.
---
DBD Wiki says Deliverance is NOT affected by Monstrous Shrine sadly.
---
Yeah, okay toxic Meg.
---
Uh yeah, for sure, it's not like I went on that subreddit to see news about the upcoming AMA...
---
I think it was meant to the ‚Äúanti‚Äù version of Slippery Meat. Kinda like Predator is the ‚Äúanti‚Äù Lightweight, or Calm Spirit is the ‚Äúanti‚Äù Spies from the Shadows.
---
They literally still haven‚Äôt gotten back to me
---
Had to check what subreddit i was in just now
---
I think it should be like that.
---
And next meme about survs bad killer good guys u are boring
---
They could just disable all steam codes for cosmetics so everyone selling on eBay would be screwed. There‚Äôs got to be another reason behind this because there‚Äôs plenty of games with exclusives.  I‚Äôm thinking it was because they got tired of their spaghetti coding taking away the summer bbq items from peoples accounts and having to fix support tickets for them.
---
No one was even asking for them not to be exclusive. All they did is skyrocket the price of the bloodletting shirt so their argument is invalid if they don‚Äôt give that away free too. I also think it‚Äôs bullshit they‚Äôre giving away the event cosmetics free. They aren‚Äôt even that nice to begin with but I wear them because they‚Äôre exclusive. There‚Äôs plenty of reskins for the same cosmetic anyway.

Honestly I am fucking salty because of stuff like this happening on the regular but comparing the state of DbD to 1 year ago I'm pretty hopefull that problems like this will be fixed sooner or later. Just needed to get some air out yesterday :D
---
The game mostly registers for Killer's favor. Or sometimes client-side wins first who has better ping in the dedicated servers. Also, hook vacuums.
---
I love this idea, simply because it hasn't been done before and I think it'd be really interesting to have a character who is both killer and survivor. Would it make sense? Not really but the entity can do whatever it wants it seems like. Probably won't happen.
---
free, and i‚Äôm on 13 because i‚Äôm in college and i‚Äôm not going to play every day
---
i‚Äôm only buying the paid for characters i actually care about
---
I really want to see our survivors have a killer version of them. Even if they arent put into the game I just want to see what designs they could hae
---
Tru3 still does few worthy notes when doing certain actions and hints. He is still doing the same habit since his old DbD streams and nowadays too.
---
They‚Äôll probably rework it one day.
---
The walk of shame!
---
lmao
---
Players a lot tend to give up nowadays seeing someone leave or knowing that they have low chances. Sometimes even new players do this not knowing what to do and letting Killer do the deed of deciding. As much as the truth hurts, Killers also do the same, getting tired of disconnecting and letting Survivors do some ideas.
---
Yeah, because I was scrolling, why would I even post it if I wrote it myself? You can check my other posts and you will see I'm not an idiot, DBD has always been my favorite game and I didn't even had it 3 years ago, I bought it in a different time as well, congratulations on downvoting me
---
You forgot "gg ez baby killer"
---
It was just sad to see this man give up.
---
But it is funny.
---
Then my mistake, otherwise imagine the outrage if this could be an option from devs.
---
Gen rushing is killer code for "I suck at applying pressure".
---
Init can't believe we played the game üòÇ ill remember to let him find me next time
---
The difference between console and pc is honsetly astonishing.
---
Weird thing to add but it would be pretty cold. I sometimes I do feel bad for survivors who go to struggle state or die on first hook.
---
I'd call it Great Value BBQ personally but yeah, Rancor pretty much eclipses it's functionality and even that is a borderline meh perk.
---
Lmao, the killer in question is a dumbass for DCing, but "fail to apply pressure" against 4 survivors in the early game when gens are spread out is the stupidest argument ever.
---
NGL, I wish this game had some actual competition so that it would be FORCED to evolve or die.  The fact that this is basically your only option for an asymmetric slasher themed survival game is the all that has kept this game from dying.  Believe me, if there was a reasonable alternative and this game didn't get overhauled to compete, I'd be jumping ship.
---
Which actually can be done on the Thompson House at a tractor or if they're upstairs. I think the basement too, but thats every map.
---
Yes, that's insanely obnoxious. If people wanted to see your twitch, they'd be in your twitch.
---
Me: Cleansing Thrill of the hunt
---
Also me: Killer is getting close and I am about to be done with the hex but it's haunted grounds.
---
I like the squeak whistle sound he makes sometimes
---
Jfc, what went on in that game to cause that outburst?
---
Try Wraith or Hillbilly, they‚Äôre both fun killers
---
There isnt any point trying to mindgame the harverster just run straight after the person and vault after them, they cant really get very far or they have to waste balanced landing. 
---
Its hardly a bad structure though, disconnecting is bizzare
---
Here's a tip - draw him crouched in one frame so we know what is going on. Or draw him both standing and crouched in one with the standing version of him transparent or just light/white outlines.
---
This is... egregiously crude manner to toy around with innocent players who don't deserve any of this.
---
If this is suppose to be "funny" I don't see anything much about it. You're welcome to give me downvotes man but this stuff is not cool.
---
AWWW WHOLESOME
---
With the amount of Ghost Faces we've been seeing lately, it wouldn't be wise.
---
Having it confirmed is fine but not when they're adding salt to the wound. If all 4 survivors escape and tbag, emote etc then there's no need to shit talk afterwards. There's no reason for a survivor to be an over the top dickhead about it. Constructive criticism is always the better option.
---
Obviously people will become more skilled the more they play but being shit talked every game makes me not want to continue to play as a killer anymore and therefore, won't improve
---
Urghh that sucks
---
That's why I use blood warden on most of my builds
---
You know that people don't really care which side it is, as long as it's funny.
---
Step 1) Bring a flash light
---
Step 2) Making clicking noise
---
Step 3) t-bag
---
Congratulations, you will now be tunneled for the rest of the game
---
P3 Nancy ain't so bad.
---
It would be strong in a Houdini or stealth build. Those builds usually rely around you hiding your scratch marks and/or aura with the only other indicator being blood if you're injured.
---
&gt;Burger King Myers.
---
What is a Burger King Myers.
---
Most killers will target you if you rub ooo or they will just leave you alone depending on the killer, if you want to pratice loops as well don't run anything that gona help with looping aka any adrenaline perks to so it's just pure skill and knowing when to vault a window or drop a pallet
---
The post is referring to how they said "rework nurse add-ons" and nerfed her and predicts that the same might happen to billy
---
I read this as "should I use uwu to practice looping"
---
It's almost like every survivor runs borrowed ds by default not to mention keys, if survivors can bring their best perks and items why can't killers as well?
---
Sometimes its Good to cleanse or else u will make to much noise while looping and mind games will be alot harder
---
This is what I did for a while but I didn't really stick with it. I'm sure it would help but you would have to have dome extreme patience with how many times you will be killed because of it.
---
Okay thanks, I was just wondering how these 2 add-ons worked together, one make you lose EWIII when killing someone and the other give you permanent EWIII so I was wondering which one had priority over the other on that part.
---
I kinda hope this post gets taken down.
---
I can hear this image
---
It does exist, yesterday my friend got facecamped
---
If you want a canonical L4D style look prestige all of his clothing, equip all but not his P3 Head. Like if he was coated in lots of blood from killing zombies in his game. Alternatively equip only his P3 head alone.
---
He's really that one video game character that has his military attire and works just too well and doesn't much of a change.
---
They all sort of fell to a fundamental flaw.
---
F13 crashed and burned over license issues which is hilarious since it's 1 franchise and DBD is managing with 8 external ones at the moment, including one that is blatantly avoiding paying for Scream's rights.
---
Last Year was sold through discord. Many games these days are built into a social platform, but discord just doesn't translate that way. They're trying but it's nowhere near as popular as something like Steam or Battle net to already have a huge friends list on. People use it for calls, or IMs in servers, it just isn't the same.
---
Hide or Die was a nice concept but the game itself was boring and stupidly balanced, there was no option to play as the killer, and worst of all, NEEDED 16 PEOPLE FOR A SERVER. DBD is the top one standing and it has issues getting 5.
---
DBD might not be perfectly well optimised, or the most perfectly balanced, but it's definitely constantly supported, growing and improved upon, and it's going to be incredibly hard for a similar game to break that momentum enough to ever take over, or even survive alongside it when the playerbase is your main target, and they're already invested in DBD.
---
Also, lol at Deathgarden, it did OP's meme, except "months" was "days."
---
Yeah learned that the hard way
---
damn thought gamma is a spirit main now :'D
---
He bumped into a wall... and missed a lunge... and another... and another one... and-
---
yeah that‚Äôs what i thought. that the username would be enough
---
Always screm at the downed survivor, it's polite.
---
"Another sacrifice to the Entity"  
---
I mean... the rest of the song I was there with you but then that line came up and like, I'm pretty sure it's about DbD.
---
fair point
---
It should just be "get a 4k" If all the survivors have to do is escape
---
Come out Otz we know it's you!
---
ok, how is this related to my post?
---
If you pay extra attention you‚Äôll notice Santa Clown‚Äôs pubes stick out of his zipper
---
"Frank... Frank what the hell are you listening to?"
---
but targeting me would help me practice tho
---
i already do that
---
Hey, I've seen this one!
---
I'm curious why points don't get rewarded AFTER safety unhooking shows up? Why didn't they make it so points show up along safety unhooking? It would pretty much be more legit.
---
I used Object, Spinechill, Self-care, and Sprint Burst to learn looping. It's most helpful to know that you have to run efficiently.
---
You get the killer to target you and not leave you
---
that can be done without being toxic
---
I'll teabag continuously to hint the hooked survivor to suicide so I get the hatch
---
You wanted the killers attention, right?
---
Iron Will you PLEASE leave me alone!
---
I kinda hope you would stop arguing about something so retarded
---
Then there isn‚Äôt really a way to get the killer to chase you and mainly you.
---
This is pretty much Spirits but with purple add-ons and has NOED
---
first down, all 4 dc
---
I wouldn't recommend it cuz that's just an easy tunnel. I always target ooo's in my games.
---
I guess adrenaline rush and sense of pulse going faster the more you hit? You do have one chance of hitting Survivors cause if you miss, you miss. I wouldn't mind this but then Frenzy speed add-ons need to be either gone or changed into something else if this idea would be in Legion's base kit.
---
Demopup
---
9 games out of 10 you might as well have not brought perks lol
---
Would be better if there were something like, idk, gas canisters at fuel pumps littered around the map that survivors have to bring to generators in order to repair them to certain thresholds (so each gas can unlocks 50% repair progress, 2 cans allowing a gen to be fully prepared). The challenge shouldn't be the limitation of getting the gas cans but moreso the danger of making a gas run, it forces you to be mobile and put yourself out there even if the gas itself is fairly simple to get and plentiful.
---
Or confusing completely new Survivors...
---
This is a really meaningful and thought provoking discussion provided by this post. /s
---
In other words, this is so over posted about gen rushing, so please stop already.
---
You cant see gf with OoO
---
Yep, apparently been happening to quite a few people today :/
---
It truly is a balancing act, but I absolutely agree every killer should be viable. Some people just want to play a certain killer and that killer may or may not live up to the current meta. Active balancing is neccessary.
---
As for gens, I make assumptions on what would happen if they took longer. A perk lime ruin would no longer be needed in the game or it could be reworked. Realistic? Probably not, but some things have to be reworked in general. Tinkering around to find what would really help is part of the path to a solution.
---
Wait I don't get the joke I'm a boomer
---
Claudette &gt; Every killer
---
Makes sense since killers try to mori the hell out of survivors these days.
---
Had it happen to me a few days ago, after waiting 2 minutes I disconnected too.
---
\*breathes\*
---
I think you left the game for too long mate. I enjoy way more survivor than killer because is waaaaay easier and less stressful
---
I always play solo and camping, tunneling and so on isn't a big deal dude. When it happens, usually the killer depip and I safety or get one pip due to chasing and protection hits.
---
I could counter your arguments point by point but would take too long and I really don't want to, too much effort to correct many statements like "more time to do gens" like it is fun to hold one single button for 80s already..
---
The only things I can think of that rivals the energy this has is either a bunch of demo men playing bag pipes with 2 spies drinking tea while reading the news or a gang of 12 engineers square dancing with 12 level 3 sentry guns around them.
---
what if I tell you: it can be.
---
There is no reason to post the same "genrush made me dc" bullshit, It is too prevelant on this sub, just like all of the other reposted bullshit like the level 4 tome
---
&gt;You cant see gf with OoO
---
Reason why I said it **wouldn't** be wise.
---
You can't see GF but he can see you. Same for Wraith, Pig, etc.
---
speaking of hitboxes, has anyone seen those glitches where your model extrudes a huge part from the centre. I wonder if that might be happening with the hitboxes .
---
I.E a huge thin wire coming out but able to be hit?
---
lmao when it comes to killers I did it with ghostface too. ny favourite killers with michael and pig! congrats dude
---
I mean I got sent this so hardly a repost is it salty killer main probably saw your message on here before and can't take it bless have a good day ‚úåÔ∏è
---
I read it would be wise :D my bad
---
I had a whole game that I couldn‚Äôt see any skill checks but I still managed to hit my DS so I‚Äôm pretty happy with that
---
ARE THOSE DUNKAROOS IN THE BACKGROUND
---
No0b3: he a survivor main but great with killers too. I love how he says he bad with nurse and just destroyed the whole game like a pro with her
---
And also there is bug with identical nicknames. Random player can get hooked icon instead of hooked person
---
EAT MY POLE
---
Why use iron will when Ace exists?
---
I feel you my dude
---
Possibly, I remember this happened to someone on stream once and had something to do with the broken status effect.
---
I think the only changes legion needs are:
---
110% speed. 10 seconds duration, 20 seconds cooldown. Frenzy attacks reduce 10 seconds of deep wound timer. Legion cannot hear survivors while in frenzy. Legion cannot see tracks or blood during the frenzy or during it's cooldown. Legion can activate frenzy for a shortened duration if he has at least 35% charged. Missing hits deplete 50% of the current power gauge. Survivors can mend up to 50% of the deep wound while running and they can keep holding it to prevent deep wound timer from going off. Deep wound timer goes off no matter what.
---
I love Otz
---
After you wrote that giant text about the servers I kinda figured you‚Äôd have an answer for me lmao.
---
Do you know if that‚Äôs actually a thing they‚Äôre planning to do?
---
cool!
---
If you want to make games last longer, limit how many survivors can be on a single gen. Add more single slot gens.
---
Appearance looks pretty alright but gameplay is pretty weak. The power doesn't allow them to down the survs, cant track anyone, can barely be used to sprint place to place and deep wounds itself is a joke, what with the timer stopping during a chase, but also stops when your healing it off, meaning you cant really knock anyone down with it.
---
Ironic considering the lawsuit basically killed the games development.
---
Hunt, chase, hook, repeat. Do that and gen speed plummets. If you can't keep the survivors focused on secondary objectives that's you failing as a killer. 
---
Survivors can't gen rush the same way killers can't apply too much pressure. It's the whole objective.
---
Survivor bad
---
Killer good
---
when the whole team DCs or suicide's on hook and they did a single gen since the rest was doing jack all.
---
but for real give those people a break they got fucked as much as you by the 3 other people.
---
(you dont get as many BP and most likley will depip unless lucky so give or don't up to you but thats my fist rule)
---
Honestly id learn to play without ruin until you really need it first. It makes you way to reliant on it, good survivors do not care about ruin they see it every single game.
---
Other than that id have to see you play to advise anything, as a note good survivors will do 3 gens, its unavoidable on a lot of maps. Killer pressure starts with the first hook. This is a perfect team mind you 90% of games will not have these players
---
Essential oils duh
---
Myers with both the Scratched Mirror and Judith‚Äôs Tombstone add-ons, makes him literally slower than survivors
---
It's fine to have somewhat similar powers, Hag and Trapper and Freddy all do trap things but each with their own spin on the equation. The pure fact that Mariner can't move while aiming is a pretty big difference on its own.
---
Green rank killers are the only ones i see DC, most killers past that point know the score
---
I mean you are going after the same character entire match so
---
Downvote Hell time: The Spirit's backstory and the Yamaoka stuff is the least interesting shit in the game.
---
Implying that the trapper dosent magically grow whenever he aint the tallest in the room.
---
Short Answer: yes.
---
Long Answer: Well yes but actually yes
---
you know it is actually fastest for survivors to be each on a different gen than being multiple people on a single gen, right ?
---
#Me if the Killer played fair although I had a flashlight and blinded the Killer... xD
---
This happened to me today
---
I dont like this, not cause of the message, but rather the image of the dudes face as he rubs his nip on the glass while saying "oh billy."
---
Honestly, killers never get it right. They always give it to that one person that sandbagged the whole team lol.
---
Best way to learn is to just watch how good huntress and nurse players play them and try to play like them. 100 sensitivity is a must on console
---
You have to sacrifice the 4 og survs a total of 25 times I believe.
---
That would be cool! Anyone could have a redemption arc
---
a doctor let me have the hatch
---
-baby dweet
---
not bad needs some more balancing but not bad
---
Ha, if only. More often it would just be "killer tunneling me anyway".
---
but what if at step 2.
---
ADRENLINE PLUS KEY! (had that happen one time boy did i get some nice salt. wish i filmed it though..)
---
I get it when i vomit with the blood. Hopefully they'll fix that soon.
---
Not gonna lie, I‚Äôve seen more killers dc the past few weeks than survivors.
---
My basic attack does it for me too. Idk I haven‚Äôt been 360‚Äôd this much and consistently before
---
Your like hitler. But hitler cared about germany or somthing!
---
Can I play Bloodborne GOTY Edition on PC though?
---
I cared about hooking Jane. xD
---
The devs have said as much. The Entity was corrupting him and coercing him into becoming a Killer. 
---
However she changed her mind when she saw some hidden potential in Rin, and the Sky Spider chose Rin over her father.
---
and thats why i bring up the ante and slippery meat and ubreakebill.
---
CUSE TEAMMATES WON'T FUCKING HEAL ME!
---
What's a depip
---
Just trying this trial is it one survivor only or any of the 4 in a trap. Confused help.üòï
---
You just gotta get people in traps. If you can trick one person in the same trap 4 times... well good on you.
---
I think the most disgusting looking thing is Nea's face.
---
But why did you compare me with Hitler? :O
---
&gt; Let me play as Myers and test out Evil Within so I know how it works before I actually play a match
---
You literally just have to hold M2 and look at a survivor lol
---
I also have an unnatural fear of insects
---
where are these pallets you speak of? 
---
Infs are annoying but... you can just leave the survivor? why do you think you HAVE to chase them there? go chase someone else. bring bamboozle if its that big of an issue.
---
I let every survivor escape by being a terrible killer üòé
---
darkness among us the worst?
---
welp this list got one thing right the rest is Always debateble.
---
&gt;personal
---
, ‚Äò:)
---
&gt; I think it's similarly coded do Pokemon Red/Blue Master Ball, where they used "&gt;" instead of "&gt;=" causing one random value to still fail
---
Last time I checked, the Master Ball bypasses that formula and will never fail.
---
Looks like you won't be able to find any survivors during this game..
---
we want to talk about braindead how is a unmindgameable pallet not braindead for survivor? also wasting a perk slot to counter an infinite is a bit ridiculous seeing how perk reliant killers are already when it comes to gen defense. ur arguement doesnt give any valid points at all
---
Well that's what the perk is for. Good on the unbreakabill for giving the team a good chance to comeback, but not at all something that makes me mad LOL
---
On Ps4 this usually happens every time someone activates Dead Hard. Could be the culprit?
---
They confirmed it in a dev stream.
---
Just like Ghost Face, there isn't a new map... they just showed Yamaoka in the teasers for lore purpose.
---
Ever run Spies on Hawkins?
---
You just kinda just transcend this mortal realm with all the info you've gotten.
---
At rank 17 you could use Ruin and no add-ons and you‚Äôd win.

---
I used to use it all the time to the point I found it difficult to play without. But when you get used to walking to hide scratch marks - the amount of times you need to crouch (when the killer is right next to you) greatly reduces. You kind of realise that whilst there is no problem using it and it is useful in certain situations - you can actually get the same effect just as well without it. You just need to think about line of sight a bit more.
---
Okay, that's true... xD But I did not play DbD for 3 months and I wanna reach R1 again. :D I just want a good build without Ruin and I don't want to change it again. xD That's why I ask with R17. ^^
---
Well I mean since Huntress is the Best Mom so it‚Äôs obvious that she has great milkies as well
---
Yeah I know I‚Äôm pretty Sure Huntress is one of the Tallest Killers and I know for a fact that‚Äôs she‚Äôs taller than Trapper
---
I still think it looks very nice though.
---
Nope,  there will be a map.
---
The new map was found by dataminers under the name "HtiShrine"
---
Steve's perks are all trash. Second Wind is mediocre but ultimately not worth it, as there are easily better healing options. 
---
Fixated is meh, maybe if it actually applied if you are injured it would be decent. Inner Strength is the only actually strong survivor perk from Stranger Things.
---
I would honestly expect 1 strong perk for both killer and survivor, in the best case, and the rest is going to be stuff that is too convoluted to activate, only offers a mediocre bonus or activates 1 time during the match. 
---
In terms of killer strength I expect a mid tier killer. Last few killers were mid-to-upper tier, but they are all fun to play so I am hopeful they bring out something unique and fun.
---
Did he get a nerf? Lol what are you talking about?
---
Oblivious is another
---
(/s means its a joke)
---
Its not like survivors aren't losing some of their OP stuff too.. They just nerfed insta heals and its not like Nurse isn't still really strong or that Spirit is going to be garbage after her nerf. I'll give you that there are still some problem loops on certain maps that they should look at, but i wouldn't call them infinites. They're slow about it, but I'm sure they'll get around to them at some point like they did for cow tree and other spots that were a problem. As for pallets, you can't have every pallet be unsafe and easy af to bloodlust around.
---
not always lol. i main killer and almost always type ggwp unless survivors are blatantly toxic but the other night when i said it they all just flamed me and called me garbage because i took rancor (on my baby spirit where i had hardly any other perks worth taking). i only got 2 kills that game but i guess that guy was mad he got mori'd at the end? lol
---
Second Wind should be looked at as a time saving tool rather than something to keep you healed, like a lowkey adrenaline or deliverance rather than an Inner Strength or self care.
---
If you go for saves early on, the perk allows you to seamlessly transition into rushing down gens after a hook, ignoring lengthy self care times. It can also be used to deal with tunnelers as long as you can avoid getting hit for 30 seconds (or in other words, effectively use your exhaustion perk and one pallet) without the risk of getting waited out with DS.
---
You had BL, were safe all along
---
Also S        E         L         F         C         A         R         E
---
75% of pallets on all maps are safe except maybe Hawkins lab but other than that place once the survivor drops the pallet u will never get them even with bl 3
---
* A survivor appreciated me giving them the hatch because of a disconnect in their team.
---
* A Spirit giving me two pallet stuns so I was able to complete the pallet stun challenge first try.
---
* Finding a nice streamer because I had been disconnected from the game in their killer game and came to their chat to apologize.
---
* Watching a video on theories as to who the killer and survivor of the new chapter could be.
---
*  A random survivor perfectly bodyblocking for me so I was able to make it to the exit and escape.
---
I use the ability a LOT but I don't need Stridor or Predetor. I find people even if they use IW and using Stridor when I chase someone without IW did confuse me (I tested it in private matches). I have no problems during the chases but I need a good Perk which helps me to slow the game down.
---
also they buffed all medkit heal speeds to counter the insta nerf and technically the purple insta got a buff being able to tank insta downs
---
i highly suggest running addons that increase your speed while cloaked (i think its windstorm)
---
I often times cloak after hitting someone, then i begin to run in front of them, body blocking them from the next loop. It works amazingly.
---
You have to learn to read where and how a survivor will be running after you hit them. Wraith is p low tier but he is far from useless. People give him a bad rep bc he is low tier, but he is a fucking MONSTER in some categories.
---
Also he is just so cute :D
---
If you catch someone out in the open the idea is to uncloak right on top of them so you leave them no time to run anywhere and start the chase with a free hit.
---
Another thing to remember with wraith is to 
---
BODY BLOCK, BODY BLOCK, AND BODY BLOCK SOME MORE 
---
What I mean by that is if you corner someone as wraith even while cloaked they can‚Äôt get out the corner if you‚Äôre blocking them. Use this to get either a free hit or free down. Bad survivors heal in corners pretty often trying to hide, for a good wraith that‚Äôs an all you can eat buffet. 
---
As you learn wraith some more you‚Äôll get better at body blocking things like vaults/pallets/ running survivors and you‚Äôll see why he‚Äôs underrated.
---
But TLDR, learn how to sneak up on people and body block them while cloaked. 
---
A lot of people don‚Äôt know this but if you body block someone on a gen, SOMETIMES they‚Äôll be stuck between you and the gen and you get a free hit.
---
Why would anyone pay that much attention to detail?üòÇ
---
Well the killer should also be securing kills by any means possible,but them survivors get mad when he tunnels them or something. Sometime the game is about more than "getting out" or "sacrificing"
---
We have multiple emblems  and categories to earn instead of just having a "Gen" category and rushing it. If you want to ignore all that and everything the game offers, do that. But yes, then you are genrushing, not that it is something intrinsically bad, but you are doing it.
---
Yeah, some objectives need more incentives, like Totems, Chests, Sabotages etc. and BHVR should make them more appealing to do. But they are still there, and you are choosing to ignore them, and rushing gens instead.
---
XD XD XD XD XD xd i‚Äôm 12 btw XD ROFL :p
---
Why are you replying to a 3 month old comment
---
If you're using the "Ghost" add-on (I think it's that one, the one that takes away you terror radius and red light anyway) you can go in and out of "stealth" on loops with big walls and they wont see you, works very well
---
Finally some proper changes, thank you devs.
---
And now? xD What do you wanna tell me with this comment? xD
---
So, it's it is not high enough ? I'm surprised because sometimes I trigger it when I don't want to with smaller things.
---
Well good thing I unlocked that page before seeing this
---
the example of a fair pallet is on freddys map with the truck and bush if u drop the pallet on those u will eventually get a hit as killer but it could take u 35 to 40 seconds if ur shit at reading the survivor but u could also get a hit in 5 to 10 seconds. The pallets like any jungle gym pallet u can stand at the pallet and slide over or run to the other side and u will never get downed forcing the killer to break it. I'm not asking for braindead pallets where u are guaranteed hits but I dont want pallets to be I have to break this because I will never hit u even if I make the right read.
---
Waste of a perk slot unless your sole purpose in life is to piss off survivors.
---
Daddy spirit: i....i did it... i did what you wanted... p-please just... H-help me...
---
Entity: YOOOOOO SHE KINDA BAD THO
---
You fucking monster.
---
also bamboozle isn't a bad perk but as I stated killers are perk reliant and you almost have to run gen perks or you lose unless u play a top tier killer then u dont need as much gen perks.
---
The second time I got this was at the beginning of a game, I basically spent all the time being chased ang gen tapping
---
Haha thanks. I always feel bad living someone being without trying
---
I forgot which YouTuber said it, (maybe inter4ct) dying light is a ‚Äúwin more‚Äù perk. If you‚Äôre already doing well enough to get a good use out or it, more than likely you don‚Äôt really need it. But that‚Äôs just my opinion
---
You can do the same on windows
---
*devs when they see a clown getting a 4k fair*
---
Devs : **HE IS OVERPERFORMIG! NERF HIM!**
---
It still exist, it is still a bad strategy in most situations with sone exceptions and if you aren't seeing it anymore is becouse you are high rank enough for killers to know how to play.
---
Even if they added something like that why should it be limited by certain date and not just given to anyone who gets all the achievements?
---
the killer shack has some balance to it. if the survivor immediately drops the pallet it has 0 mind game to it but if they dont then u can mind game it.
---
Yeah, this killer is actuallt just a costume. The person inside is not related in any way to the Scream movie series, as BHVR only got rights to the costume.
---
I had bad experiences with surveillance... They touched the gen and then they started to hide... and this again and again... StBfL sounds good...
---
You just have to kick the pallet. If you have problems with that, use spirit fury or brutal strength.
---
By using his snares? You don't place his snares directly next to the pallet, you place it around the loop of the pallet so you can hit them before they even get there. People do cleanse against Plague, but even if they don't you can throw on a yellow add on to give you corrupt anyway. If that's not something you want to do then enjoy being able to 1 hit everyone. Not really a losing situation..
---
There are timeouts in for honor that I think would work perfectly on this game
---
then they run to another safe pallet then what do you do? repeat till uve broke the 15 pallets on the map and all gens are done?
---
I just thought they‚Äôd bring the original back considering it was in the Classic Ghost Face set, but I have no idea.
---
Also,  I‚Äôm not sure if you even read what I said about it being legitimately BAD PLAY to do anything other than working on gens while not in a chase (without a good reason to do something else) 
---
You are slowing your team down if you‚Äôre running around looking for dull totems and hooks to sabotage instead of doing gens and if I need to explain that to you, you clearly DO NOT play both sides.
---
Things like brutal strength for getting through pallets faster, iron grasp if you enjoy dragging people to the basement like me. Perks that don't fall into the tracking or slow down category but improve you in other ways that favour your style. I like to have 1 in any build. (I'm a massive fan of Franklin's Demise)
---
when they start doing that, don't check the gen. but count in how many seconds it'll take for the survivor to walk a way and hide.  with the spirits phasing, you should be able to approach them from an unexpected angle, like behind them for example.
---
That's fair. I usually favor aura reading perks on Spirit over things like Dying Light/Pop/Ruin because I find them a bit overkill on her. It really depends on how you play though, like if you find yourself losing people when phasing or struggling to counter Iron Will try Stridor. If you need to pressure gens more, maybe try Surveillance or Discordance.
---
freddy gets countered by dropping the pallet instantly just like clown does once the pallets dropped ur not getting a hit because survivors will play off the pallet.
---
Surge is flat out garbage, the worst perk he has. Mindbreaker at least counters Sprint Busrt, a lifesaver for stealth killlers, and Cruel Limits can give you a free hit situationally (I still would never run it, but I wouldn't complain if I randomed it). With Surge, you need to combo with Surveillance to have an effect that does anything significant at all, which boils down to a worse version of Thrilling Tremors.
---
Freddy is solidly in 6th place. Nurse, Spirit, Billy, Hag, and Huntress are all better than him when used well. Demo is 8th, with Plauge beating him out, and Ghostface is 9th. 
---
Freddy is great for how idiot proof he is. His subterranean skill floor means basically anybody can play him and win with no practice as long as they don't fall for the trap that is the pallet add ons.
---
Demo is good, but buggy as hell and kinda bland.
---
Ghostface is less bland, but also markedly less powerful (to the point where half of Ghostface players just ignore his ability entirely) and just as buggy.
---
Plague is a mess of design with half of her power  being essentially nonexistent, but she just kinda works. Usually not well enough to deal with a SWF doing the gens in 3 minutes, but still pretty well.
---
The kates are always the most toxic, change my mind
---
It's not that the game and the characters themselves are inherently bad, it's just that the fanbase surrounding it is absolute shit and has pretty much affected the game for the worse. Besides, FNAF has a cool cast of characters but I really don't see them fitting into a DBD setting.
---
I don't even think they could. Unless the survivor gets a sprint burst and some I-frames what would prevent a killer from hooking and unhooking to waste hookstates?
---
I don't destroy pallets often with Spirit and the effect of BS isn't that strong... And I don't care about the Basement that much... xD
---
I main survivor but have learnt playing killer placement of the ruin is pretty key so a lot of luck is involved as well as not getting tunnel vision on one survivor all about mind games and chase tatics
---
The game is already braindead easy for survivors.
---
You'd have to be on the other side of the map to trigger it so you can't just whack them off the hook and tunnel.
---
I remember seeing a similar idea where the killer could manually unhook the survivor, and they get stunned by the entity similar to DS to prevent tunneling.
---
Mabey have four husks that are dormant you can posses and take over after a cool down. I dont know if the devs could do it but have it so the husks patrol the map.
---
Every single surv that has complained about me using NOED has had decisive strike.
---
Dude.. Their power slows the survivor. If they're looping you around a dropped pallet then place a snare or throw a bottle at the midway point of the loop. You'll either get a hit when they can't get back to the pallet on time, or you'll force them to leave the loop to avoid the snare/gas. This is pretty basic stuff..
---
Bread Hard - you‚Äôve had enough of the killers shit. After being chased continuously for 20 seconds, press Activate Ability button to level the killer with a stiff right hook. Stuns the killer for the rest of the game as they lie on the floor knocked out. Causes exhaustion for 60 seconds. ‚ÄúFuck off, arsehole‚Äù - David King.
---
I know I hate things others like. It's the worst when they are popular. 
---
/s
---
You just have to break the totem, yet survivors cry like fucking babies about NOED every day.
---
Well Doctor swole isn't too much of a stickman either, I mean he's wearing a sleeveless labcoat just because they would scientifically explode off his biceps
---
I mean 
---
It ain't worth a thing,
---
if it ain't got that swing
---
I would love a FNAF killer not to mention another huge boost of players to boot.
---
I've gone down less in corners and escaped than people taking me down in the middle, and then have a leatherface run around the corner with his chainsaw getting us both down because the person who thought it was a good idea to heal me right where the killer is going to come look for me is apparently the smart thing to do because 5-10 extra seconds of getting away from the hook is a bad thing.
---
Borrowed Time: i sleep
---
The time that has been taken and is due to be returned: *REAL SHIT?*
---
as stated most pallets are safe when u drop them so playing off the pallet where u slide over will counter freddys slow down because he womt be fast enough to get the hit
---
Who would have thought, the team of 4 depends less on one solo person then the team of one. 
---
Survivor is not brain dead easy unless you are playing with really good players or at low ranks.
---
Are you talking about pallets where the survivor can stand there and only needs to slide back and forth because going around takes way too long? When you said 75% of pallets I thought you were talking about pallets you can't easily bloodlust because they make long loops that survivors can run around with a vault in the middle. 
---
Ok yea theres no where near 75% of pallets being like that on every map.

wouldnt say a safe pallet is a simple mind game when all u have to do is drop it and stand at the pallet
---
Corrupt, Pop, Sloppy, Thanatophobia
---
not quite 75 but I'd say 6 of the 15 pallets on all maps have these
---
Fun fact: Survivors need poins too. So the entire essay you just wrote is worthless as the same applies to survivors. If you escape without being bold or altruistic you will get shit points and you will not only rank up slower but also level up much slower.
---
yes I am referring to the ones u said
---
Alright thanks, there is only one problem. I am new to the game so i don't have perks like nurse calling, ruin,enduring or spirit furry :(.
---
As far as i know nurse has a lot of good perks for wraith but i also know that she i a very difficult killer for newbies ( or am i wrong about that).
---
I think i just to work with the perks i can get on the bloodweb but thx anyways :)
---
Or maybe they know exactly what they're doing but tunneling only works on ranks 15 and below.
---
it indeed is boring as hell. I usually go afk when i have to expect to be slugged for a loooong time. Due to teammates not helping me up or due to really friendly killers, who slugg all 4 of us and wait till we bleed out...
---
these are the pallets I'm referring to in my post but everyone seems to just reply with get better or just break the pallet but not realizing how unfair and braindead these pallets are
---
To be honest, sometimes the game goes in way that after you finish your first chase 3 gens pop. That moment is really sad, as you basically understand that while the game is still going, you have already lost.
---
Coming from an ex nurse main, all I can say is have your sensitivity maxed out, and don‚Äôt swing unless you know for a fact it‚Äôs going to land. With the new changes her missed hit cool down + 2 blink fatigue can be super detrimental, and can honestly lose you games.
---
Just make the point bonuses on WGLF and BBQ available without perks, maybe expand the prereqs for survivors so there‚Äôs no fighting for the unhook.
---
That does feel like a david thing to do. 
---
Also I'm confused as hell when I see some of the comments on here and instead of saying 1 or 0 on the upvote/downvote, it simply states "vote." Is that supposed to be the zero or are we now in total drama island?
---
I don‚Äôt know iv no idea how a power would work but let‚Äôs say you don‚Äôt like the way he looks BAM you got like 23 other variants of skins
---
it takes like 2 secs to break a pallet, removing the best pallet on the map with no struggle is an amazing thing.
---
Im done with this convo, you have like 3 dif comment chains with me and its getting annoying. i told you what to do, but you seem to just have to learn how to play the game
---
Survivors get shit points no matter what. And if you knew how boldness points work you‚Äôd know you need to be getting chased to get a good amount of those. And when not in a chase...and when no ones on a hook... you do...GENS 
---
Or is this still too complicated for you to understand? lol bc I‚Äôm not gonna explain it again
---
Yeah no kidding Trapper won best Canadian character once. That‚Äôs impressive for a game with zero dialogue besides king ash and the rift. And my god when they get guests they do em right each character plays as you‚Äôd think they would. I mean playing demo I feel animalistic play ghost face I feel sadistic and stealthy, and while playing pig I feel judgmental and willing to bend rules for kills. And don‚Äôt get me started on Micheal, because I feel like evil itself when I play him and it feels good.
---
ur not including the part before the dropped pallet though say they loop the pallet for like 15 seconds then drop it u have 20 seconds from 1 of the 6 pallets. I just wanna know theres the skill in doing a pallet and being 100000% safe
---
To my knowledge enduring is in the shrine rn, and no prob!
---
Like legion with the way the skins act as characters? Could be cool, but could cause issues with animations and whatnot as well. I don't know different the whole cast is, though. I stopped following the game after Sister Location
---
They keep posting stuff like this and they enver getting.
---
It is called holding THE GAME hostage. The entire game. If it is possible to reach an end, then you are good to go.
---
There is a thing called endgame collapse and there are 3 survivora doing gens so the game is clearly moving towards an end.
---
Next time just alt tab and watch a vid lmao
---
They only care about money
---
I only do this if the kids are kicking off or I'm eating food otherwise I generally just let them go to the hatch and close it for a giggle then chase them around for 10 minutes until they either quit running or DC
---
Your idea is shit. So instead of the already weak legion, lets take away his only tool of slowing down the game even for a little bit and make survivors have RANDOM debuffs which might not even be useful? Genious.
---
11
---
People say gen rushing and NOED are toxic. They're all just components of the game to help either party. It gets bad when the rapid crouching after a pallet drop begins.
---
On a good day, 2 at max
---
On a bad day... I'd say 5-6
---
You must be fun at parties. Just points out the negatives in everything
---
***Yes***
---
Are you offended or something? Chill the fuck out man.
---
Solid 7
---
Higher than CS lobbies, so like an 8 (really depends on the rank you are at tho.
---
100
---
You just described how most survivors won't adapt. That's it
---
I'd laugh my arse off if this happened to me
---
Honestly wish survivor was first person, this game would be so much scarier.

Killem. Killem all (4 first suv only)

Quentin is one face rework away from being in every lobby.
---
And thus MS's potential niche use as a counter to Delicerance is lost. What a truly garbage perk.
---
he is trash for tbagging tho he could have saved there teammate
---
The sacred Texts!!
---
Not exactly. With unrelenting you can actually intentionally miss before a pallet to make the survivor greed for another loop and you can catch him; can be especially effective on hillbilly because you can get a chainsaw for an immediate down.
---
I normally give last survivor hatch unless:
---
- they were toxic (farming teammates etc.)
---
- they were immersed the whole game and this is the first time I‚Äôve seen them
---
- they are my 4th bbq stack üòÖ
---
- I have a challenge/daily which I need to kill them to get
---
Lol screw them for wanting money for more content right? They ain't a charity pal

Is it a bug when map name interface doesn't vanish at the beginning of the game and stays with you till the end of the match?
---
THAT made me gag thanks!
---
1
---
Can't we just be toxic together?
---
It wouldn't be a meta perk if everyone didn't play ghost face :/
---
Youre constantly exhausted if you run it lol
---
Don‚Äôt kill himself
---
Oh no
---
Looking at the timer and the fact that Myers was tier 3 and the gate wasn‚Äôt even open, no actually, he couldn‚Äôt. At best they could‚Äôve alternated who was on the hook, ie had ash save while Claudette was hooked but this late into the game nothing to stop the killer from slugging Claudette and immediately moving on to ash, and wiping the whole team.
---
I think sometimes even sweetie pies learn to express themselves in new ways when their life goes to crap
---
And if you knew that there are literally perks that improve your Bloodpoints as survivor *literaly for doing other stuff than THE OBJECTIVE* then maybe you would realize there is more to the game than rushing gens.
---
Don't explain it again, I don't need to hear the usual "REEEE gens only objective REEEE" paraphrased 10 times from you.
---
It's for the achievement.  You do it once.
---
The legion really feels like such a wasted opportunity for a killer.
---
yea like when they relentlessly bullied everyone. Relateable am I right?
---
Yes but u get less points for doing it
---
Wait. So with iron will and no mither when the killer doesn't have stridor, you're rocking grunts of pain at -50%? Some kind of SUPER CLAUDETTE?
---
&gt;maybe expand the prereqs for survivors
---
Put cleansing totems in there. Survivors always complain they lack objectives, make cleansing any totems increase the stacks as well.
---
Unless the devs allow more sensitivity for controllers, nurse is a headache. As a huntress main, I personally like to disrespect pallets against good survivors because they expect me to raise my hatchet at them. Also a nurse's calling can be juicy for both of them.
---
Wtf
---
Ok, best counterpoint ever
---
14/10
---
Sweated my ass off to get my first mori 4K yesterday, as I was killing one the other unbreakabled and got hatch :((
---
I feel this one
---
You obviously never played Sugar Daddy Ace. Plunderer's + Ace in a Hole = keys, rainbow maps, other rare items. Things that can save you if the match goes side ways.
---
I just broke the base of my speakers (advice for everyone: DO NOT BUY WIRELESS STUFF, SPECIALLY IS ITS A MOUSE) playing killer
---
You fuck :,D
---
I'd like to see how you play survivor, because I have a feeling you have less than 1 hour of survivor playtime
---
So I finally know what [happened here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aqkw5j/weirdest_ds_denial_of_all_my_killer_plays/) from a survivor's perspective
---
this would be incredible, this show was my facking jam
---
Yeah, someone on YT did the math and the best combination possible is the green 180 toolbox with double speed addons.
---
you've not seen the show "chuck" have you
---
Detectives Hunch! I‚Äôm in love with this perk as of a week ago lol.
---
Game runs great on the Switch! I honestly don't know what people are complaining about when they cry on these threads. I've put almost +75 hrs and haven't run into any issues other than weird coloring when reflecting a police light and weird pause when the killer leaves on score screen. And that's not that often i run into this. Otherwise, i love this game!
---
It probably happens about 1 in 15 games to be honest. Despite what this sub might make you believe - most killers just want to kill you.
---
Ruin bad? Wtf
---
About right
---
Freddy is full of Claudettes?
---
Today i killed 2 of 4 swf at rank 1 with Ruinless Clown, I didn‚Äôt camp nor tunneled and they said :you‚Äôre trash ,go play brainless Spireh , she suits you the best.
---
Tier 35, paid
---
Most satisfying thing is to bloodwarden a bunch of BMing survivors in the exit gates
---
Yeah I believe you could miss 100% acc moves if your speed/crit was too high or something.
---
Haha damn that's true, do you usually target them first then?
---
Why though.
---
If I can yes otherwise I use them as bait to get other downs like the trick u can do as spirit where u pretend chase someone hear a person close by is working on a gen and just phase grab them bc they think someone else is getting chased
---
Depends on killer, though a lot of the time you need to catch them early and give their team a really hard time unhooking (assuming they‚Äôre SWF). If they‚Äôre solo, they probably want to loop you; at that point, it‚Äôs up to you whether you take the challenge or leave them.
---
You've clearly never been walkin before
---
I usually leave them, they are obviously conformable in a chase so i usually go after someone else and what normally happens is A. Person i'm chasing wastes pallets which makes chases later easier or B. Person with OoO really wants my attention and takes a hit for free so they can have "their moment"
---
I mean you get the odd 5% of people just wanting to know where i am but it's rare.
---
What song is that?
---
My eyes are bleeding
---
[Wolves by Kanye West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsA84bXrBZw)
---
Makes succesful, so hit, M1 attacks recover faster. I think someone did the maths and it takes 20 seconds for a killer to catch up to a survivor after hitting them and 8 stacks of STBFL will reduce that to 12 or so seconds which has an even bigger real game impact since it will prevent survivors from getting to loops, windows or pallets that extend the chase even more.
---
It would be fun if they had like journals describing how highschool was for them. What made them twisted in other ways besides the killing. Cause we got the rebel, the outcast, the girlfriend and the one who wants to fit in. A bunch of misfits that has a sick dynamic that works
---
Lets just says that I do not enjoy being froze during a chase because the mouse/keyb stops to work until I move the speakers
---
Usually ignore them for the first half of the game and play how I usually do. Apply as much pressure as I can. Then after a little while, anyone running OoO will generally start to troll - I've never came across someone running it who doesn't end up fast vaulting windows trying to bait a chase.  
---
Let them carry on until they get too cocky, and before you know it they're on the floor.  
---
  
---
People who run it are usually pretty confident loopers, and they use it as a "Hey killer, fuck you, chase me". Play like normal and ignore them until they mess up. It's almost guaranteed.
---
Story of my life
---
I had a Claudette with the legacy shirt trying to crouch in bushes on haddonfield earlier. At the time I assumed they didn't know my location and was simply afraid of the terror radius, but now I am not so sure.
---
Ha ha humor
---
Clearly outskilled the killer.
---

i wish i wasn't extremely shy and could swf with people ;w;

Curse under your breath the whole match and question bhvr. I facecamp them. They want my attention so bad, they get it.
---
How can you say that when Quentin exists?
---
That would be sick
---
Hit boxes be like

Lol this is exactly that old joke people used to make in 2016, this is amazing.

Fucking camping ghostface douchebag asshole
---
What the fuck is a crugger

I did p3 my jake and nea killers legion and trapper and yikes that took a lot of bloodpoints
---
I would be fine with keys can only be found in chest. I'm ok with luck. If you escape me because you found a clutch key then good for you. I think Mori would be fine if it was death hook least on the first time you use it. Again I don't mind a unlucky game. Maybe put timers on both. The only thing I don't like is when a key is used I have to babysit hatch till it closes or close it myself. Feels to long when it is open. I like the fact that keys can be selfish. Maybe only person who has it can use it. Think like a Non DC. This team sucks I'm out.
---
Your item appears in the first chest YOU open. If you open it and walk off, Dwight can take your item. Nobody can open a chest and have your item appear in it.
---
But then there is those days were you make some incredible plays, have good matchmaking and a fun time! We always seek those days even though that's like 10% of the time. But then there are the other 90% that always make me ask: "Why are we still here? Just to suffer?"

If you're a gen monkey maybe, but more often than not you're soft throwing playing like that.
---
Every survivor gets 2 hook states and really REALLY good players go down on purpose to preserve busted setups that can waste about 2 minutes of the killer's time. Now imagine 3 survivors pushing gens while one guy runs killer 2 minutes, doesn't drop a pallet, and then the other survivors exploit the set up as well putting in health states/ hook states to preserve that 2 minute looping area.
---
If everyone can loop effectively and be glued to gens at all other times, that's 8 hook states x 2 minutes. That's running the killer for 16 fucking minutes- enough time to get all the gens done more than 4 times over easy clap. That's peak efficiency, and taking into account setups are preserved. (They almost never are- 90% of survivors are dogshit at this game)
---
But literally if that same team of 4 loopers has ONE GUY who hides every time terror radius is heard and sucks at chases, making them even 80% as effective of a gen monkey, the total amount of hook states to dish out effectively becomes 3x2, since immersed survivors are usually found last. On top of which, certain trust plays work less often because the immersed survivor totally slacks at their job, letting hook states slip by while the killer is occupied chasing someone else. 
---
When you get 2 immersed survivors, the amount of safe hooks to dish out becomes 4. An easy killer win even if the 2 good loopers carry their team the best they can.
---
god i wish it was like that on mobile, i could just play my main for bp and use it on other characters. on mobile we actually have to play as the characters that we want to level up.

No there‚Äôs a big where the match will start before everyone is loaded in. I‚Äôve seen other survivors moving around while I was still in the map cutscene
---
Yeah I've tried it using a Canadian version and the shop system wasnt my favorite
---
Ghostface might... Idk about the others.
---
I might straight up just stop doing the tomes and read the lore online because I do not have the energy to go out of my way to use a fucking garbage perk and throw my game just to get 15k BP and a half paragraph about the Trapper's dad having a really big dick. I spent well over 12 hours today alone trying to get the 10 heals and 3 repairs, this is just getting ridiculous.
---
Huh. And I lose connection for 0.3 seconds and get dc for it.
---
What if you open 2 chest the same item twice or a different one?
---
Thanks! I was sort of just dicking around but started to like the idea of a wildcard exhaustion perk haha
---
People getting hit when they aren't actually being hit by the killers weapon, I play on ps4 and it is a really big issue there
---
Hope you told him that this means he must be an even worse survivor then.
---
Holy shit,  the little thing he does while looking around where one of his mouth flaps like move and he looks so cute like omg

I was once playing as the huntress with iridiscent hatchets, and I was facing this guy with OoO that was just so damn good that no matter what I did, he kept running me in circles and dodging my hatches like a damn pro. What I ended up doing is, I went for his teammates. They were NOWHERE as good as he was, so I downed and killed them easily. When the last guy was hooked, I saw the OoO user looking at me. Instead of looking for the hatch or anything, he just stood there and wanted to go for the unhook. I just waited for him to try to unhook before the other guy died, and once he tried, I hit him in the head with an iridiscent hatchet. I downed him before he rescued the other guy, hooked him, and got a 4 kill. It felt so good.

Insidious Bubba or really nasty Trapper
---
Is self care a bad perk?
---
If I understand correctly, yes you can do all the levels at your own pace, but before the rift end in 51 days from now.
---
I have a friend who did not complete level 1 before the release of level 2 on the 13th november. He was able to do the challenges from level 1 before moving to level 2. 
---
I also thought that level 1 would be closed when level 2 was released (like they do every week in Battlefield 5 if that speaks to you) but it doesnt.  
---
Really not sure that the challenges will remain available once the rift is finished, as it's now part of a season pass, a new one will be released every 3 months and so on.
---
Mans looking like dimmesdale with his hand over his heart
---
Ok
---
thats a perk idea i love. a wild card exaustion perk (though ditch the dead hard as you can use it while not injured.)
---
REEEEEEEE wrong usage of the meme format REEEEEEEEEE
---
No. Thats a BAD perk im not wasting my 7 dollars for that perk
---
This is exactly what I say, but not mad about it
---
You only get the item in your loadout from the first chest you open. After that, it works like chests as we know them.
---
They said something about only free or shard killers no liscensed
---
Oh, then i get decisve strike so i dont get tunneled by survivors

I mean it‚Äôs not really it‚Äôs true

Or bbq

She was nurse lite so people hated it. Personal the handicap of not seeing a big enough trade of she didnt need nerfed. Yeah it sucks if she uses an add on you cant hear her, but she is guessing you location. If she guess right she wins.  Her power give her good map pressure but in a chase its a toss up.  She has to stop for at least a second to use it, goes a little faster than normal and cant see if survivor moves.  She is a slow killer and cant ignore pallets like nurse so im not sure why everyone lost their shit over her.
---
You good?+
---
Yeah, in general new players waste their time healing themselves and then instantly get hit by the killer. In the time that they could self heal, they couldve done much more. Inner strength is just way better in general.
---
No. Spirit would become more broken
---
Why spirit?
---
my man dragging scott jund under the bus
---
Reddit isnt for self promotion man...
---
Dude... The Spirit is cute, The Legion is cute, The Huntress is cute. Demogorgon is Just waifu material, nothing more than that really.
---
I play immersed all the time it doesn't just mean sitting in a dark corner until the killer is on the other side of the map and then doing 2% of a generator. All it means is you just wait until the killer isn't right there to do something.
---
This is also assuming that every survivor team is an optimal SWF with perfect communication and coordination at all times and in solo queue that is not what you get. You get people who go down in three or four seconds during a chase, you get people using urban evasion in the basement to farm boldness points, you get people who suicide on hook, etc., sometimes the best thing you can do for your team is not get caught and stick on gens.
---
You mean Freddy Krueger?
---
What?
---
ok ill delete my post kid if that makes u happy
---
It‚Äôs a waste of time. It‚Äôs always best to let a teammate heal you. Run DS. Iron Will. Bond. Etc. so many strong perks to run instead. 
---
The top of your perk loadout should have iron will and bond. Two amazing perks. Decisive Strike is arguably the best perk in the game and will prevent a killer from tunneling you down. Mix in an exhaustion perk of choice or adrenaline.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it says ‚Äúcursed pedigree‚Äù
---
I've had them as well but they just disappeared from my inventory. I remember competing for the codes on stream lol.
---
This is why I don‚Äôt slug anyone. I know the moment I do it‚Äôs either Unbreakable, or worse it‚Äôs an Army Crawl Build with Tenacity and Flip Flop.
---
Depends on the killer. If I feel I need the early game pressure then I will try to get them out of the game as fast as I can. I‚Äôll hit and hook other survivors along the way, but they‚Äôll definitely be my priority. 
---
If I can rely on late game shenanigans or have a stealth build, I play normally.
---
Tip appears only when u are facing the killer for the first time
---
Nice meme, but clown isn‚Äôt that enjoyable to play agaisnt, easy to beat and underpowered for sure, but still pretty boring to play against
---
Hes a cutie kitty and none can change this
---
Since I have a good chance of running PWYF as killer, when I see that aura I think to me such ‚Äúthe Entity is good, the Entity is kind.  Let‚Äôs get some motherfucking stacks.‚Äù
---
I already thought so, thx anyways :D
---
There's an icon in the center of the bloodweb when you reach level 50. Once you click or select that icon you will prestige. If you complete the bloodweb normally, it will repeat the same message as when you first got to level 50, then give you a new bloodweb. You can keep going like that forever until you run out of perks to grab. Then once you have all the perks, they just get replaced with add ons and offerings.
---
Misery likes company.
---
I already thought so. Thx anyways
---
Legion's Power is fine imo, what they need is just a freaking add-on rework.
---
i appreciate the compliment, i meant lower tier as in - not anal beads spirit or anti-heal ghostface over and over again
---
That's a good idea actually cheers
---
Âë™„Çè„Çå„ÅüË°ÄÁ∏Å (norowareta ketsuen) which means "accursed blood relative" or related by a bloodline/consaguinity
---
&gt; All it means is you just wait until the killer isn't right there to do something.
---
Yeah but if you can loop, it doesn't matter if the killer can see you or not. Like once you're at high ranks you can often just run by the killer as they're pre-occupied with someone else, sit on a gen and just watch from 10m away.
---
&gt;This is also assuming that every survivor team is an optimal SWF with perfect communication and coordination at all times
---
SWF doesn't offer anything besides revealing that it's myers or if ghostface is heading a certain direction. It doesn't help in chases. You can sort of guarantee correct gens get done first, but in all other aspects a solo queue player efficiently and getting 4 of those is indisginguishable from a SWF who know how to play the game.
---
&gt;sometimes the best thing you can do for your team is not get caught and stick on gens
---
For yourself, if you're trying to get the 5k survival points, sure, but for your team it's often better to just play correct and hope the rest do their role. Hiding just wastes so much time off gens or rushing objectives like unhooks.
---
wait when did hope get buffed
---
People are just going to fucking dc this way oof.
---
I'm just going to be friendly and hope to god they understand what I'm trying to do.
---
i primarily take bps when i am gonna farm some archive challenge or some shit
---
its not worth the investment when you take it on for example huntress- and get haddonfield
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll prestige when I save up 1 mil BP probably
---
I had the exact same glitch as I ran out the gate, but in the process it burnt out the rest of my fladhlight, sad face
---
So the UI designer speaks for the entirety of BHVR? interesting...
---
So mimics?
---
But Endgame Collapse, really?
---
What did I read
---
First thing that came to mind when reading this. 
---
I like it.
---
Oh well. A meme is a meme is a meme amiright?
---
Am I going to get downvoted for saying Legion's mask is ugly af?
---
I‚Äôd like it if you could tell they are fake with plunders
---
This calls for a spirit with prayers beads and bbq, ruin, nurse's calling and pgtw with a mori

That's pretty Gay

that isn‚Äôt endgame collapse

Is this a joke?
---
Yes thanks for sharing months old information
---
It is, you can see the ground burning
---
Play the killer you like and put points into Nurse to unlock her perks.
---
I felt this in my soul
---
This should be the effect of the fuming mixtape and not that gen progression bs...
---
ground isn‚Äôt burning, that‚Äôs the outline around the screen because he‚Äôs on hook
---
Yeah i hate u/ps4andipadlover
---
Yea had it happen to me often enough, but never when the endgame collapse already started lol...
---
You have never been in the official forum then..
---
Ye let's add some fake boxes fake gens buff the gens maybe some more hooks and a instant mori
---
I love this too. We need to spread it so the devs take notice. We need a nautical themed killer
---
Suspiciously accurate üßê
---
I usually try to rank up as quickly as possible, make sure you always pip atleast once, do atleast 2 gens and save 2 peoples and i think that should be enough to pip once in the mid ranks
---
I‚Äôve definitely noticed this, it‚Äôs really annoying I hope they fix it
---
i know they said they are learning from the mistakes of these challenges but i hope they actually DO learn from it. hopefully the next archive wont be so ridiculous
---
That's really how it's calculated, I hoped it would be 4-15% 
---
AKA -11% chance of unhooking without luck offerings and such.
---
It really does suck huh
---
Those tips appear when you're a noobie
---
STBFL. Problem solved.
---
Its not like self care wastes more time than someone else healing you. Healing a survivor takes 16 seconds. Self care takes 32 seconds. Both of these results in 32 seconds of gen time lost.
---
Trapper was not the only killer, he was just the only killer in the beta test.
---
Wraith billy and trapper were all in at launch, with their respective maps. macmillan autohaven and corn map.
---
He kinda alien purs while standing or in menu, gotta love that
---
They're the reconnaissance guy of Survivor Team Six.
---
***TUNNEL THE EVER LOVING SHIT OUT OF THEM!***
---
Less things for survivors to do is bad for killer. People without plunders would just focus gens
---
I had a match where I felt like I did particularly poorly as killer (to be fair, I got 2/4, which is better than most of my games, but I spent so much of the match accomplishing nothing) and when a player called me terrible in the post-game chat, I was like, "I know I'm terrible, that's why I'm playing. I can't get better without practice."
---
And the idiot (who I killed while he was teabagging at the exit, mind you) told me to "go play the tutorial". You know, the same tutorial that does literally nothing to make you better at the actual game, as anyone who has played it can tell you.
---
Some people are just toxic through and through.
---
Plus they usually don‚Äôt stay on gens for too long. Ignoring them can give you a huge advantage.
---
 Mmmm clown thighs
---
I mainly play Ghostface stealthily so they wouldn‚Äôt be able to see me and I tend to ignore my obsession anyway because I run Dying Light and PWYF. Once everyone else is dead tho, their ass is grass
---
Is gud. Have updoot.
---
That‚Äôs my build. I‚Äôm rarely helpful but every once in a while save the match
---
So you don't want the change because you would've needed to teach them again? Why do you teach them in the first place? Doesn't sound like you enjoy it.
---
Because if your the last survivor you have a very slim chance of opening the gate and escaping. Your only chance is a key and that's if you brought one or lucky enough to find one.
---
i have seen 100 of this same joke but with different meme formats
---
That some pretty good artwork and is completely true about the Legion mains
---
If your the last survivor in this scenario its always gonna be hard to escape whatever the killer is
---
There is an add-on that applies Blindness when interacting a portal and it stays applied for 45 seconds after you leave the portal
---
Its not that bad, solo you just kinda have to accept your teamates will be no help at all. Doing a gen or two a game isnt too hard
---
Got em
---
Pre-undetectable i tunneled the fuck out of them and got them down within the first minute. 
---
Now i just laugh at them and see them through walls with my stealth.
---
i mean if this did happen then I can see a lot of ppl just not bother doing chests anyway
---
On the bright side, at least you're not a worthless sack of shit like that other guy.
---
If you happy and you know slap a Meg.

*Slap

---
No worries.
---
The beta sign up was pretty cool to be honest.
---
The way you got in was by pre-ordering the deluxe edition or going on the website and getting a link where you had to give it to 3 people to get "rescued off the hook" if you did it everyone got  a key
---
oooh THAT perk thx
---
Get that so often on console, maybe a gen completed sometimes lags the game that little bit, enough to miss a tap and dead üòÇ
---
Because I have my own opinions. DV me. Go for it. I'm not going to jump on the band wagon if I'm surrounded by PewDiePie level of 12 year olds spamming Reddit. He is ok. I find others way more entertaining. I watched 2 of his vids. He was just ok.  I don't think he is garbage. The responses I read on this page I think am not wrong. Very defensive. Projection much?
---
The meter actually isn‚Äôt 100% when it get‚Äôs filled like that, it‚Äôs like 98% with an extra 2% of progress you can‚Äôt really see, I guess it‚Äôs a remnant from the old ui style.
---
I think there's a bug with the "deplete medkit" challange where you just need to put down the medkit on the ground for it to work
---
When Deliverance first came out it took the chance up to 104% which basically got it back to 4%
---
No, broken status affect means you can‚Äôt heal to healthy. Nothing to do with DS. Trust me been playing this game since release
---
Haha nice one. Cuz one of them is a claudette hahaha
---
It wasn‚Äôt blindness. I had the same screen effect you have when working on a portal and I couldn‚Äôt here terror radius
---
No this is great. Awesome job
---
Don‚Äôt forget the Necessary Information that Trappers Daddy killed Trappers Uncle in a bear costume. THATS THE LORE WE NEED
---
Ruin, noed, whatever you like. I don't play spirit that much to tell what perks are 100% good for her. I just think that sloppy doesn't synergy much with your build and needs to be replaced, yet it's all up to you
---
She doesn‚Äôt telegraph anything so it isn‚Äôt fun to play against.  No window animation and no way to tell if she is phasing.
---
Torch spamming is better at drawing killers attention I say
---
No OP perks?? Such as..... literally no killer perks are that insane. No tunnelling, that‚Äôs your playstyle, if you don‚Äôt capitalise on bad plays that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre losing. Plus wraith is very add on dependant, you won‚Äôt stand a chance without really good add ons
---
You are not disappointed if you expect a bad team every time :P
---
In red and blue a master ball can fail to catch a Pok√©mon. Look it up it‚Äôs really interesting
---
Yeah im annoyed now, $400 worth of skins gone to waste..
---
u/profanitycounter
---
Glad you chose ma boi and main Ghostie as your first one. Congratulations! :D
---
Sorry meant op add ons
---
For real now, is stalking really the best alternative than just going straight to the person opening the gate?
---
The clown is really thicc though
---
Why would the balance the game due to bad optimisation, just no get a good pc
---
That kinda the point. She is un predictable. Learn to counter it. If the only thing you can do is read the killer your gonna do poorly.
---
I'm sure they're out there. 
---
I'm no great Leatherface (honestly IMO LF has a very high skill ceiling, almost or higher than Nurse when it comes to muscle memory), but I can manage a 2k at Red Ranks without camping. With charge speed addons and a player who knows how to use him; Bubba can be very dangerous.
---
He still looks and sounds absolutely ridiculous, but he can be effective.
---
#git gud
---
You think so? I get jump scared everytime I see Michael Myers pop out of no where or I see him staring at me
---
Don‚Äôt need a rework, just delete
---
Actually the above picture is how i camp them in the basement lolol
---
I would totally use iron will if i could only have one, or balanced landing, but generally i use balanced landing, iron will, resilience, botany(or spine chill, if i dont have a medkit) 
---
Balanced and iron are both really strong perks and help with looping a lot.
---
Resilience makes you vault 9% faster and paired with spine chill you vault 15% faster than normal also when i lose the killer i can work out gens really fast without a toolbox
---
If i use botany i can heal with a medkit in half the time of a meg sitting on the edge of the map with self care
---
Honestly i, and many other high rank survivors, hate people who use self care since it takes up so much time and generally killers are either running slow down builds with sloppy and thanat and theres meg4head sitting in the corner or by a pallet shes ready to waste while wasting up to 40 seconds or more just healing instead of doing gens.
---
Honestly its always great having a long chase with someone dead, the other slugged, and after about 50 seconds you see the injured person heal while the other is still slugged is genuinely the most upsetting thing
---
I fucking hated this game when I first got it. Now it‚Äôs one of my favorite games of all time. It‚Äôs a dream come true to play game where I can be Laurie or Michael and play in Haddonfield. I used to be really into F13 but man no new content really makes it boring as hell. I still feel the devs just gave up and used the lawsuit as an excuse. Months after they said they couldn‚Äôt add anything new the mobile game was still adding Jasons.
---
So you're actually the bottom picture. Gotcha
---
That *is* all Survivors have to do, is escape, which happens every other game anyway. Also, Killers are far more perk-reliant.
---
Blame the survivors that cry nerfs
---
Legend says he's still walkin till this day
---
Im a bit mad you put Bitter Murmur in there, this perk is very useful when you are losing the game.
---
I've never once had someone message me after a game from either side. Shit talk in the lobby, sure.
---
I like teaching them because that‚Äôs one of my passions, i don‚Äôt like when they interrupt me every 10 seconds to ask a question about something i‚Äôm explaining. Teaching the game is fun, teaching it 15 times over the course of 10 matches while trying to play... isn‚Äôt.
---
Wish I could do that but survivor is boring af after like a match
---
All you have to do is teabag, and the hooked survivor will understand that you are on the hatch and will kill himself for you ;)
---
My go-to build is Adrenaline (Meg perk), Bond (Dwight), Better Together or Inner Strength (both Nancy perks), and a fourth perk of your choosing. 
---
I usually like to fill the fourth slot with Wake Up (Quentin) because I like knowing where the exit gates are and getting that speed boost on opening them.  Other perks I like to rotate in and out of my build are We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever (David), Prove Thyself (Dwight), or Iron Will (Jake).
---
If I could only run one perk, it would probably be Bond. It lets you see where teammates are at all times - who‚Äôs being chased, who‚Äôs on a generator, who just got injured, etc. That way, you can make your own game plan accordingly.
---
I always try to get Ghost Face to tbag with me. I try to nod and wave at him before I even crouch to try to make them understand. Usually doesn't work unfortunately... Idc if you kill me after, I just wanna derp together, lmao
---
Remove Legion :)
---
*The Void Walker has appeared*
---
Yes it's especially an issue now because you get bloodpoints for selfcare
---
Lies! Just play Spirit and farm and meme with the two Survivors that don't DC.
---
iron will ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I love it, I always wanted to get into making stuff like this and I‚Äôm gonna see if I can now.
---
Nahhh, could easily get characters lvl 50 with just a million or less. Feels to cheap
---
bro use the classic costume and the default knife for ‚Äúscream‚Äù ghostface
---
It's tiers acquired by getting challenges and the 1 tier (10 fragments and a charm) you get after completing the level.
---
I think it will be available in the sequel game: Bread by daylight
---
If youre a friday 13 fan, that game is actual horror. Your characters actually gain fear and begin to stumble and trip during Kason chases. Every counselor has a stamina bar so looping more than 10 seconds is impossible unless you choose the one Vanessa counselor. In the end it doesnt matter because Jason has constant indicators, teleportation anywhere he chooses on the map, phasewalk like spirit and also stealth mode like pig and myers so you cant sense him near you.
---
Just realized you said single player, i think Until Dawn, Alien Isolation, and Outlast 2 (cutrently free on ps4) are pretty good for some chilling nights.
---
So survivors need more to their achievements then, is what you're saying.
---
Meg stop cleansing it‚Äôs haunted grounds oh no she‚Äôs wearing AirPods she can‚Äôt hear us oh god oh fuck.
---
Whichever helps makes you feel better lmao
---
I guess I'm just too desensitized to the genre and the characters because I know what these figures are capable of. And what they clearly don't bring to the table in the game. 
---
Michael especially, while jumpscares are nice Michael Meyers STARTED the slasher genre. He has a certain aura if dread about him that just did not transfer with him to the game.
---
Jaws theme intensifies
---
I am so scared by this image, and my pants are now soaked in piss.

Twitter says 11 AM ET on r/pcgaming

It was a possibility but rare.  Her power doesnt last that long and blindly bumping into someone would be hard to do unless it a doorway or something.
---
You‚Äôre welcome. Very impressive work!
---
Same, they are the first ones I make DC
---
And how many horror movies do you watch? How acquainted are you with the killers given to us?
---
Also, questioning a downvote? That kinda looks a bit insecure mate.
---
Yeah but first you actually have to make it to the end of the match with no mither
---
No, it can't. I know that there's a hole in the catching formula that would theoretically let a pokemon break out of the master ball, but the master ball completely bypasses the formula to begin with. The master ball always 100% catches a wild pokemon.
---
I got 2 done as killer with party mic
---
I‚Äôve watched Halloween, and some others, but mainly Halloween. I do have a pretty big knowledge about horror ‚Äúvillains‚Äù.
---
And I dont give a shit about karma or whatever, but you dont downvote other peoples opinions.
---
What region are you in? I've met a small group of players through the game and we all just play for fun which means it's really laid back and we're always happy to play with new people!
---
This is so sad. Can I get a *heavy breathing* in the chat?
---
Nice! Take my money pls!
---
Nah. I will chase you...and I will Shred you.
---
Or really boring because you‚Äôd be staring at nothing but a gen for 2 minutes straight instead of looking around for the killer
---
its alright. a goes for normal letters and an goes for vowels aka A E I O U and sometimes Y
---
See you in hot
---
2 full
---
Imagine your butt hurt if they introduce some legacy 2.0 stuff. 
---
Always burn points offerings and go for prestige asap. Getting level 50 is still pennies compared to unlocking all perks.
---
Did you see the guy who plays him ? He has Big hands
---
I like stalking truck and stabbing truck. Wayers
---
Yeah I made this post before seeing how unbearably hard it was for Killer achievements.
---
I'll be fine cosmetics is never a big thing for me I do brun point offerings and never really bring moris
---
Knowing archives this is probably supposed to be done in a single match
---
Get rid of struggle or add it to killers. Pointless and annoying mechanic.
---
You could still look around while on a gen. Just make it so you have to look at the gen to preform a skill check.
---
So we shall
---
mad?
---
Is this actually real? I almost choked on my cereal. 
---
This is like a personal journal of Butthurt. I don¬¥t think there are many better ways to become DBD laughing stock than this.
---
Fix the servers is pretty much what youre telling them lol
---
Some context real quick: So this survivor accused me of tunneling, camping and letting the last survivor escape through the hatch. Since we had a DC at the start of the match, I thought it'd be nice to give the last one some BP, but I guess that's no good. I also don't believe I camped nor tunneled but hey. I happened to check this comrades profile and found out that her entire steam profile info and a big chunk of her screenshots are just this.
---
Now this is dedication. Not witch-hunting or anything, it's just that you don't see this everyday. Should I delet...?
---
Rancid abattoir was actually added post launch not cowshed but you're correct on everything else.
---
Thanks mate i appreciate your good words :)

Yeah but in this image you‚Äòre also constantly exhausted (iridescend king addon)
---
A house lost its tegridy? How embarrassing.
---
Now, it *just* so happens...
---
Yeah I know that but I always forget to do I that way xD
---
What the other guy said, but also to a lesser extent it makes hook diving suicide.
---
I love this. Since I've got a bazillion gateaus on him, I'd love to try this out!
---
I think Friday The 13th had some great ideas and I hope DbD2 if it gets made take some of them but it also wasn't really scary and I know there are plenty of great single player horror games they are actually scary.
---
What do you mean? That is literally how survs are supposed to play. There is almost no counter play to spirit other than guessing so what do you mean learn to counter it?
---
maybe if people keep posting this it'll become true. i mean yeah its a little weird that you want the huntresses to be a little girl or whatever but hey man you do you
---
The best way to do these challenges is to just load in, find a survivor, smack something a million times to show you‚Äôre friendly, and then guide them to the basement. With some luck, another survivor will tag along. Do the quest, then let them do whatever they want.
---
This Battlepass sucks. I want to get the most out of it before buying premium, but you have to do so much stupid shit just to make progress. It alters fundamental gameplay so much. Just because grinding **has** to be inconvenient for their monetization model should not mean it fucks with how you play the game.
---
Now what you do is farm Bloodpoints till you hit 1million so once you prestige you can immediately get back to level 35 (if you avoid buying the 7-8k addons)
---
I just let my hair air dry
---
Pay no attention to the place on my forehead
---
Fun fact Doctor is actually the tallest killer when it comes to the base model, only reason Huntress looks taller might just be the mask + ears. 
---
Also when considering "strength" the actual size in length becomes irrelevant when factoring in sturdiness and center of mass and truth be told with Annas rather female physique and no kind of clothing to restrictivly "hold things in place" she will have a problem against Doctor who grew up in a modern society with all kinds of advantages of a modern world. Sure She fought WW1 troops with their respective gear, but Doctor likely got educated in the usage and construction of weaponry a century later.
---
Also he does have somewhat of a military analytical training so he may find some weaknesses in Huntresses raw and wild fighting style which could be tough but certainly not impossible. 
---
The real question is can he last outsmart her primal and possibly pain ignoring rage and hunting routine because Hunters are known to only pick fights on their terms which she won't get against Carter.
---
Sorry for probably wasting so much time on a hypothetical fight of two fictional chatacters but
---
I'd love to find out more about killer interactions and I would like to do some more research on it (as a former boxer I love these kind of matchup analyses)
---
I'm play-annoyed honestly. The No0b3 "toxic genrushers!" At three minutes into the game annoyed.
---

Well, servers do allow for some features and measures to be implemented that the game in general benefits from, such as their new disconnection handling system they've been talking about, or preventing lagswitching by timing out clients with huge lagspikes like that. But yes, the number one reason why people were anticipating servers was to get rid of unfair lag advantages, which works by making the server the authority.
---
And in some senses, this is actually the case now, such as survivor movements and actions not depending on their connection to the killer but to the server, which is more consistent and stable, or a variety of interactions now being fairly (or rather, equally unfairly) affected by latency - people have noticed that grabs don't work as consistently anymore now, which is because the survivor on their screen actually let go of the interaction in time, or that survivors are able to jump into the hatch as the killer is closing it, which is again because on their end they did it in time. These are instances where due to the killer not being the host server and therefore authority on everything anymore, survivors are not at a flat latency disadvantage like they used to be. But the main concern are obviously hits, and like I said, the killer is still the lone authority on those.
---
BHVR did say they want to "expand on hit authority" in the status update two months ago (https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/87216), but the new developer update does not mention this anymore. With how rocky a path it's been to get dedicated servers to function acceptably at all, I doubt they will touch them in such fundamental fashion again, and while I'm still hoping to be surprised, I'm skeptical, especially now that they mention Dead Hard as a concern they are looking at in isolation, when the larger problem is that of hit authority which they on the other hand do not any longer mention.

I have no idea if the person is just trolling or he's serious. I don't wanna share his steam profile publicly but I can pass a link in a DM if you need proof. But I gotta say, it's a good troll if you don't know whether it's real or not.

wow thats rough. but i guess its his prerogative. dont worry about it.

Why would you need STBFL when you can just reverse chainsaw into Quentin hiding in a corner?

You should've seen my Future Trunks costume back in high school. I looked like I was in drag!

I'm gonna go ahead and say you are in vast minority, and telling people not to prestige you are not making any favors. I've met many players that sank milions on BP without prestige, and now they can't even if they want to, because all of it would go to waste. Again, going to P3 is cheap compared to unlocking all perks on level 3.
---
I mean, yeah, no, it doesn't. Her backstory says her mom died when she was young, maybe that's why you're confused. But no yeah it's fine, this is the internet, if you want to imagine her as a little girl or whatever I can't stop you just a little weird but hey

Didnt even know there was a tutorial. Dont let them get to you. I'll rage at killers in post game lobby but anyone who actually message you or leave a note on a profile are not worth the time thinking about.

This is actually a good way to make killer chase longer - unless it is something like Billy

The longer killer chases you without a down, the worse situation he is putting himself in - that's why legion is so bad rn, his mend time doesnt make up for the lost pressure over downing survivors

now get all teachables then prestige 3 on all then all perks on all characters and then do it for survivors

the grind in this game isn't bad at all...

Bruh it‚Äôs easy as hell for me if you don‚Äôt run half of the time I‚Äôll just meme

Post your gameplay to YT and I'd watch it, I'm a killer main, I have 150 hours so idk if I'd be a good helper but hey
---
I‚Äôm going to try jumpscare Hag now. The 0m TR seems really useful. Thank you for this build!
---
I mean yeah, no, even if that were true (which it isn't. The only motive her backstory gives for kidnapping children is that "She craved the closeness of a loved one, a child of her own, literally nothing about her childhood) but even if that was true in order to, as you said, 'remember her childhood', you have to be an adult. Which she was. Dude you don't have to defend yourself to me but don't make shit up.
---
My buddy was running No Mither for the This Is Not Happening challenge the other day and decided to run tenacity with it. Of course the lucky bastard manages to do this in the one game where the killer is determined to slug everyone and is crawling around the MacMillan estate at Mach 3 and getting his dumb ass back up. It was beautiful.
---
I've only gotten it twice, once on my very first match and once when I had a DC, someone pretty useless, and someone super toxic. I was surprised because I had hit her with the flashlight to save someone which I know is annoying üòÇ

Yes make NOED, Remember Me and Blood Warden the new meta. Easy 4k every game.

Uh a SWF with OoO and good call outs helps with chases, and most SWF have an OoO if they are good

I‚Äôve never heard a surv complain about billy and almost everybody I have talked to thinks he is in a good place
---
It is never that serious..
---
I always see this complaint of killer being stressful but like, isn't it just more exciting? As survivor you can only be in a chase so much of the match with 3 others in the game but killer is always active
---
I believe this only happens at ranks 18-20, mostly for new survivors. they‚Äôll go away after a little bit
---
I remember one guy who facecamped me and his profile had a massive thing about why he facecamps and who he facecamps. He's literally been nonstop facecamping people for over 4 years since DBD first came out.

Not on this one.

I've still got the screenshots though, took them just in case. I'm not on this list probably because she couldn't see where I was from, so I couldn't be categorized.

Daily reminder that Adept Killers made sense when it was just kill four survivors.

If you don‚Äôt like the old ‚Äújust bring a pink mori‚Äù strategy, then the devs could‚Äôve just specifically said ‚Äúsacrifice all survivors‚Äù instead of ‚Äúkill‚Äù. Was really a simple fix, don‚Äôt understand why they changed the achievement completely. There‚Äôs, quite frankly, a lot of achievements in this game that are utterly ridiculous and (often) not even in the attempting player‚Äôs control.
---

---
Never in a million years would I accomplish this 10/10
---
Idk, playing as killer I find that the survivors are usually pretty happy with me. I make an effort to not tunnel though and if there are any DCs, just start memeing with the survivors. I care a little bit about my survivor rank, and not at all for my killer rank.
---
Jes√∫s you all toxic as fuck

The one she wore at the office?

No counterplay? Im tired of this excuse! Your incapable of changing you behavior is what you mean.  When you vault a window the spirt can do a few things. Stand there and hope you double back over.  Phase around to a door and hope you did not leave. Vault over it which gave her a slight edge if you waited to see what she was going to do. Last she could walk around like every other killer. She cant go through pallets so those act the same for as every killer if she standing at a pallet walk away she will appear near by but will not know exactly where you are and it will be like a missed blink of the nurse.   She cant use her power in a case and win without you being predictable.

he literally mentioned why, so luck offerings would not work, i don't even think that would make that dog shit perk worth it tho, and getting a kobe is always fun anyway, no reason to remove it imo
---
I‚Äôm on console and this happens a lot. Sometimes someone will complete the last gen while I‚Äôm struggling and I‚Äôll be killed automatically even though my bar showed I had more time. Or NOED will proc or the killer will just knock someone down causing the same thing. It‚Äôs so annoying.
---
Funny meme. But to be honest, they're most likely gonna make the next killer a bad one. They're gonna try so hard to avoid another spirit/nurse that they're most likely gonna make them unusable then buff them later. it seems to be that path that we're going. I may be wrong but that's what it looks like.

---
Baically swing chains+ anything
---
That actually seems like a good idea, except I can't imagine how BHVR would 'describe' that so people get it.
---
Maybe just "Synergy" bonus - "when using all of a Killer's/Survivor's own perks".
---
It does sound like the game is fairer with the servers. I‚Äôm on console so I don‚Äôt have played on them yet.
---
But will servers punish the people with the worse connection or is it gonna be laggy as hell?
---
Kinda bummed out that they don‚Äôt talk about the hit registration anymore. Maybe they‚Äôll want to get the servers running properly before they take the next step.
---
Yesterday, I got downed, and saw all three of my teammates crouched in the three other corners of the map.

I counted to 5 on the hook, none of them had moved, so I killed myself on hook.

Maybe survivor pudding and bbq and chili for sure
---
The Hatch can spawn anywhere on the map. Survivors can find it using a map item. When you use a key on the hatch, the key user automatically jumps into it. The hatch then stays open for another 30 seconds for any other survivors to use it. And once it shuts, EGC is not triggered.
---
It may not display when loading into a match, or appears from a trigger that didn‚Äôt activate as he wasn‚Äôt ig.
---
You obviously don't play killer above rank 18.
---
Y'all both need Jesus
---
You play killer, even when everyone escapes you get more points for doing less as opposed to survivors. 
---
If by level up you mean ranking up, yeah that's going to take either some skill on both killer and survivor or just play a lot, you'll rank up eventually
---
Okay thanks. I usually just ignore the portals, that‚Äôs probably why I‚Äôve never seen it :D

Aight il work my way towards that as I‚Äôm only a lvl 22 trapped just now
---
I was kinda meaning bloodpoints but this helps as well thx!
---
No word of a lie did 5 gens in a game yesterday and got hooked at the end. Watched all 3 survivors run out of the exit gate, and the killer didn't have noed on. I was miffed
---
I wish I could find people to swf with. None of my mates have it and we're spread across the globe, so timezones don't help either.
---
It‚Äôs awful. It‚Äôs just her normal outfit with a tiny splash of red that you can barely see.
---
Run BBQ and Chilli (Cannibal teachable perk,buy him if you don't have it), use Bloodpoint Offerings for maximum gains.
---
Don't camp or tunnel much, you will get more Bloodpoints if you hit, chase and hook different survivors a lot. 
---
You are still looking at a pretty big grind depending on what exactly you want to achieve in the game.
---
There's a major contradiction tho. Unless it's Sprint Burst, survivors won't be exhausted at the beginning of the match, when Mindbreaker works. They will be exhausted only if they successfully break a chase or waste their exhaustion perk on something random - if they were hooked, their exhaustion resets. So in order for Mindbreaker to work in killer's favor, survivor has to:
---
1. Break a chase
---
2. Find a gen that don't have a lot of progress on it
---
3. Be caught by killer on that gen before their exhaustion restores
---
About Sprint Burst. It's an edge case, but survivors actually find Mindbraker useful if they want to keep their exhaustion an 5% so they will be able to use Sprint Burst on prompt.
---
Not sure it was intentional, but i was trying to trap 4 people challenge last night. I think i got about 10 by accident. Kids were just plowing through my traps. One kid escaped a trap and walked into another. I was laughing then entire time. I always let whoever plays well go after i get my challenges as a thank you. 
---
I was also lucky enough to have a killer willingly let me pallet flashlight them 2 times in a row within 10 seconds. In post game they asked about my questionable plays, and i told them i was just trying to do the challenges and we both had a laugh.
---
It's making for some interesting gameplay though i gotta say. People be doing some crazy shit to try and make it happen.
---
Aight thx man
---
Just buyin him now
---
Same here! I always wish I had people to play with but I‚Äôm too shy to friend people lol
---
When you tebag the killer but 2 more show up
---
Maybe we can ask them in the AMA today!
---
rank 20 killer lmao
---
The difference between Friday 13 and DBD is that in f13, the whole point is to leave before Jason kills you, as the game goes on he gets stronger and survivors get weaker. In DBD, there's more of a skill factor where you can actually stand up against the killer by running him in chases, which can be improved upon. If you try to leave before you die in DBD, it's looked down upon as gen rushing
---
Her father only.
---
Same
---
This person is using the ps4. You can go save video clips of your gameplay at the press of a button. Same with screenshots.
---
I surprisingly haven‚Äôt gotten any bad messages even when I have camped survivors that teabagged me at a pallet. I got my first after match message last night and it was a ‚ÄòThank yew, gg &lt;3‚Äô which was a nice first message to get from this game.
---
I mean past rank 7 or so I have to start actually trying, but even at rank 1 I really only care about swf when I'm playing a good killer (obviously not all killers are playable at that level).
---
It's nice to play a game where winning or losing is entirely up to me, rather than hoping my teammates don't suck or the killer won't just quit if we do happen to be competent.
---
He‚Äôs playing PlayStation the ‚Äúshare‚Äù button when clicked immediately takes a screenshot and saves it to the ps4 so ‚Äúwhy would he have a camera pointed at the screen‚Äù he doesent
---
Yu ar very biutiful bat ai dont anderstand de idea?
---
Yep that's the guy.
---
That is really just what it needs to be. **Sacrifice** all survivors using the 3 personal perks. That's it, problem solved.
---
He‚Äôs using ps4 he just pressed the share button
---
huntress but with jane's thighs
---
I think he heard him doing bones and realised there's a totem there
---
And here is the funny part - those are only steam names, wich can be changed every minute, so pretty useless xD also, you cant see who your Killer is before the match ends so, why the fk would that even help anyone to avoid those people xD
---
Repair 15 generators as the Hillbilly in the basement with Hex: Ruin activated as the last survivor alive. Challenge must be completed in a single match.
---
In which if his vids can I find it?
---
I played Spirit not even running beads and 3 of them DC the first time they go down. So fuck all adept killer trophies.
---
Spawn locations are basically random, but can only be on the ground. By that I mean - They won't spawn in nonsensical locations like above the killer basementor on upper floors of buildings - It won't spawn unless there's solid ground all the way down. On The Game map, for example, hatches simply won't spawn on the upper floor at all and will only spawn on the lower floor.
---
Key opens the hatch for a set period of time and anyone can use it. Opening it with a key is instant and you exit through the hatch at the same time, so you can't open it without successfully leaving.
---
The only way to open the hatch without a key is if you're the last survivor alive, in which case the hatch automatically opens.
---
The hatch spawns when you are the last survivor or when the number of gens completed is bigger than the number of survivors alive. To spawn the hatch at 4 survivors, you need all 5 gens complete. 3 Surv = 4 Gen. 2 Surv = 3 Gen. While 2 gens popped will spawn the hatch for 1 survivor, the hatch ALWAYS spawns at 1 survivor anyway so it's kinda irrelevant.
---
The killer can close the hatch even if it has been opened by a key. Survivors can open the hatch with a key even if the killer has kicked it closed.
---
If you're the last survivor alive and the killer closes the hatch, it'll start the endgame collapse, giving you a set time limit to escape by any means before the Entity instakills you.
---
That's about all I can immediately think of right now.
---
Well, that guy is well known in a french site called jeuxvideo.com, on the DeadByDaylight forum, he keeps trolling people with his shitty stickers of korean girls, he is a k pop fan and an absolute cancer
---
Man, it's a good thing Steam doesn't allow you to change your name at the drop of a hat. Would be a shame if someone put together such an exhaustive list that could be made completely pointless with just a few clicks if a person wanted a new identity.
---
Because we all know someone like 'Hex: Someone gay' would never change their name, they're committed to that profile for life!
---
Have you tried completing certain generators and surviving?
---
Thing is, he was asking for actual horror games instead of the action game DbD is.
---
also take BPS as survivor and you definitely will be tunneled and facecamped
---
Survivors fail to realize that a killer that can guaranteed down a survivor every 60 seconds but no faster is on the cusp of losing every game where survivors are actually doing gens as fast as possible. Sure, from a 1v1 perspective this feels OP and unfair, especially if you get tunneled, but it would also feel completely busted from the killer's perspective because if survivors just M1 gens like they're supposed to you can't win.
---
Hopefully all that was obvious.
---
So now, looking at Spirit (and even Nurse), is there a way to delay getting downed to 60+ seconds per down? Yes. All of those methods are "counter play" so it's incorrect to say there isn't any. The #1 defense against all killers with short chase times is stealth in order to delay the beginning of a chase. Once you're located, against spirit you simply act unpredictably and try to trick her into using large amounts of her power without getting a hit. You can drop pallets early or slow vault windows. She can't phase over windows so long loops with windows are still a nightmare for her. If she has to spend time bumping or listening for breath she's already at a disadvantage because she won't have any power for followup hits. It takes a normal movespeed killer ~20 seconds to catch a survivor for the followup hit, so just running in a straight line from spirit can get you almost halfway to your goal of wasting a minute of their time.
---
But is it fun to face spirit? I think it is. It's surely a lot more fun than facing SWF SWAT teams or blendettes with spine chill or maps that spawn with multiple OP tiles.
---
New killer perk ‚Äúgo fuck yourself‚Äù all survivors begin the trial on the hook
---
Bcause: No one is alive anymore. It's a limbus from hell youre stuck in with the others. It's also kind of a daydream nightmare you have again and again (a double one if youre against freddy)
---
Would you rather have Sidney? Or this chap?
---
it‚Äôs literally the point of the game. The murderous killer shouldn‚Äôt be friends with the people he‚Äôs trying to kill that makes no sense.
---
I think this is a good idea. I get frustrated that I can‚Äôt use a lot of my non health pack items because killers dodge lobbies if too many survivors spawn in a lobby with items like toolboxes/keys/maps. I think I have about 300+ different types of tool boxes on my main survivor because I don‚Äôt ever put them on knowing a killer is more likely to dodge then I have to wait  another 5 min to find a new match lobby.
---
Most of your addon changes turn a key into an extra perk slot. OoO key, spinechill key, an insanely good aura key +4 seconds after any aura reading? That's alot. Think rancor, or alert, or using the key to see the killer, and keep seeing him. You could flash the key and have 4 free seconds to see him. And skeleton key can see hatch? Half of these are buffs, with barely any nerfs.
---
If I were to guess? Probably because he can be annoying to survivors, he thrives against unorganized teams, and some streamers say he‚Äôs top tier.
---
Oh its another post about otz, how original....
---
Do more.
---
I've seen plenty of people who are assholes to killers, but I've also seen plenty who are nice and say gg and tell them they did a good job. As a survivor I've even called out other survivors out for being assholes. Some people just don't know how to treat people they meet in-game as actual human beings. It sucks to see because it makes the community look like shit when again I've seen **plenty** of nice people.
---
I asked them to come along and do one (I'm a mod there). I figured it would be an interesting AMA to have on the sub.
---
Awesome!!
---
Against a swf he is mid tier. Against a solo team, hes nasty.
---
There would be a lot of reason to have a mechanic like this. Now killers won‚Äôt have a view of items survivors want to play and can lead to less lobby dodging. Unless BVHR wants to not show anything but shadows of survivors in lobbies, this is a good alternative
---
I think your issue with Trapper is definitely skill level, or more likely not knowing good places to put his traps. I'm by no means a great killer but routinely get 3 and 4k's with him. It really does come down to trap placement, hidden in the grass on the corners of Keller Shack and outside of its window. Sometimes just random spots in high grass around generators and stuff like that. I was pretty bad with him but literally only watched 2 YouTube videos on good players and paid attention to where they put their traps and pretty much immediately started doing good with him. He has incredible snowball Effect, just last night I only had one hook with 4 generators done and one good placed trap near the basement turned the game into a 4K. Plus I think he's one of the most satisfying Killers, nothing like hearing that snap of his trap and a scream.

he does because it's a photo of his TV

what happens if you mori with it?

From red ranks to green ranks - I've been 1 hooked or face camped every other game

... I literally had a hag and a clown just standing in front of my hook hitting me and nodding up and down because I looped them for 3 gens each

It is important to try all the killers and see what feels best for you.  I didn't like killer at all until I tried huntress, then Myers.  Now i really just play Ghostface and Doctor...but finding one whos mechanics you like and being okay with sucking for a while is really the key.

Hook killer

Its sad cause its true.

oh her weave...
---
I think if it went to third person *just* for the generator that could actually work. It would make chases a little more fair because you can‚Äôt see around something you‚Äôre hiding behind and conveniently avoid a killer. Would require more skill to avoid detection
---
Don't be stressed. Play how you want as the killer. Get your hooks and go if the survivors are being good sports. Sit on their faces if they are being toxic.
---
Could be game sharing from another profile. If somebody on your console made it their ‚Äúhome‚Äù console and bought all the dlc on their profile, all other profiles on that console will have free access to the dlc as well.
---
Technically yes as long as they die without an item in their hand
---
A fucking what? Lol
---
(What is it?)
---
I'm fairly good at chases, and play alot of hag, so i just follow them from loop to loop and set a trap at every one, so i either get a free hit, or i get to set my traps without worrying about him flashlighting them because he knows where they are. Completely depends on the killer, but i usually no mercy tunnel them. And I'm a fairly nice killer, i never tunnel, and I've never used an ebony mori, and only bring moris for the "kill someone with X killer" daily ritual. I play both killer and survivor, so i don't do anything that i don't like.
---
Say it with me folks!

**PROXYING A HOOK WHEN YOU KNOW A SURVIVOR IS NEARBY IS NOT CAMPING.**

True that

This is why I haven‚Äôt played in months. My best friend switched to pc and hasn‚Äôt played with me since so I‚Äôm just lonely and never play anymore which sucks because I love the game.
---
Trapper: Daddy issues
---
Wraith: crude vigilantism
---
Hillbilly: child of the corn
---
Nurse:caught the crazy

Hag: fava beans and a nice Chianti

Doctor: THE NUMBERS MASON!

Myers: Every Villain Is Lemon

I‚Äôm not creative enough for the rest
---
Well this is an horror game after all. If its a nightmare then it's doing well
---
Yeah I wasn‚Äôt really trying to make it look like a proper thing
---
rewarding to me is putting in hard work to win not playing nurse and blink once... also it is very unhelpful telling a new player to learn nurse when they should learn mind games and how to deal with pallets/windows Nurse doesn't help u learn how to deal with any of this she flat out denies it
---
Otz lurk hype
---
On mobile, can't be verbose till later:
---
- best add ons are Trap Bags.
---
- place traps to shut down loops or in spots they can't avoid (Haddonfield windows)
---
- play a ton of Survivor. More than any other Killer, Trapper needs to understand how Survivors move and think for optimal trap placement.
---
That killer was BOOSTED
---
it sure is :D
---
zap til they‚Äôre mad!
---
honestly this was me and my friends when theres alegion with a pink addon, mind games man
---
Nah.
---
Great rebuttal of a suggestion for an imaginary mode.
---
*Squeak*
---
I just played a game of survivor to run the killer around and drop ever pallet in the game for the challenge, while I was running around I suddenly heard the gates get powered and was confused as fuck. All my team mates escaped and I just let the billy kill me because i felt bad. 
---
Somehow by throwing the game i made us win. It's an odd life. 
---
Then I go play killer and the survivors played so unbelievably poorly that I killed them all before gen even got close to popping and I'm just very confused with this twilight world life I'm living. Good survivors when I play survivor and bad ones when I play killer. Its unnatural.
---
I love it
---
I‚Äôm upvoteing this myself
---
I recommend doing both tutorials because you get 50k bp for doing them
---
Love my hag. Took some time to learn her proper and to get the perks to make her scary, but very much worth. She (Hag) was my first devotion 3, 50 killer.
---
Has anyone had any success with Tinkerer + Dark Devotion Leatherface? I would think it could be a good fit for him.
---
Same happen to me with Ash just enjoy and stay groovy ;)
---
This guy was teabagging we he saw me. As ghostface I taught him the error of his ways.
---
He's saying that you're not going to Win anything and that it was all about luck, or something like that.
---
I'd actually respect it a lot more if the torture was something methodical and cerebral like that. It's kind of lame that it's just "jam hooks into Trapper and stuff, but also can't torture or pursue Survivors myself for reasons."
---
Yeah he just thinks that it only happens mostly in redranks
---
He teabaged me I teabaged him. So I think it‚Äôs all good
---
*corn intensifies*
---
New version of no mither: "start the trial hooked and you can't be unhooked"

No this would be a definite justification

Thanks for the helpful response :D
---
Killer is always the better option
---
That's only at lower ranks. Once you get to around Rank 13 you start getting instant queues, but more often than not into hyper-sweaty SWFs. 
---
The solo queue experience you have from ranks 20 to about 5? That's about 10% of your games, maybe.
---
Please don't support that subreddit
---
You take that back right now
---
That's a broken arm
---
Or they save you off the hook with the killer right there with no BT, or get the killer to chase them right around the hook, or hiding in the corner or getting totems while you are on the hook, or sitting around a full been doing nothing, or not realizing the hag put traps around the hook, ignoring everyone crouching to get to the hook and running right past everyone and seeing the traps off...... I have had alot of very annoying games.
---
They could also convert the speed stats, so there can be an initial speed addon that trades ramping, or one that makes speed parabolic so they move fastest after two stabs, not four.
---
Okaaaay
---
Trapper is actually a really difficult killer to do well with because he takes so much time to set up and it's relatively easy for survivors to undo his ability. In addition to what slarg said about playing survivor, you also should just get good at chases as an M1 character in general, because ultimately that's what you are.
---
Pedophile slaps people to put them to sleep

It was a legitimate meme able moment, honestly.

I could see us using this as a baseline of if a Billy was good or not.
---

Once I found out how much slugging happens in the red ranks, I switched out spine chill for unbreakable. Best decision ever
---
I just saw your name and I gotta say... BUFF DECISIVE STRIKE
---
Imagine having a child and it's a boy
---
In all honesty, killer doesn‚Äôt stress me out, I just play to have fun
---
Yeah, I saw that. Bloody brilliant.
---
We only recognize the Church of Thighentology here.
---
Pre-buff Freddy was considered the worst killer in the game.
---
Who cares about rank, the point is how toxic are people? How many people go out of their way to be assholes to ruin other people's  fun. The question wasn't how you deal with it, just how much toxicity do you see
---
I''ll be your Frank
---
All playing against the spirit is is gambling. It isn‚Äôt fun and I‚Äôm not happy about her nerf. I just want to have information so I can feel like I‚Äôm outplaying her. Personally I rarely play survivor and even then I don‚Äôt enjoy the gambling gameplay
---
Seriously i wanna keep playing the game but shit like the battle pass show how much they abuse their players by making them grind like assholes while spending more money on a paid game. 
---
Everything in this game is based around grinding like an asshole. getting teachables from either the shrine or bloodweb, getting survivors/killers,  getting rift levels. It's so messed up but i doubt it will ever change. I think there really needs to be a new asymmetrical pvp game to either make the devs cut the bullshit or just kill this game's player-base entirely.
---
I've only had two instances that I recall of a weird lag like that since dedicated servers have come out.
---
My biggest issue personally is a pause in frames when I get Bloodlust as killer. I'm running a 2070 so I doubt it's my computer, but if anyone has a suggestion, I'm open to ideas.
---
Not sure why it would be a good fit for him specifically unless you have some abstract idea. 
---
But to my knowledge, no.
---
So it's like she's a nurse but she's like a bad nurse.
---
Having played spirit a lot this has happened 3-5 times.  Unless the survivor is so predictable the spirit can bounce into them reliably. Does it suck sure,  but so does a nurse pin point blinking and hitting you. The nurse isnt dumb luck though.
---
üëè
---
That's a very good point. I didn't even consider the information killers get in the pre game lobby.
---
If you legit paid that much for pixels.... Yikes.
---
If she was, r/dbdgonewild would go out of business
---
Can we talk about Cross-play feature being added? i personally am very interested in having PC and console cross-play. I have pc, switch and ps4, and have DBD on all 3. Cross-play would help in queue time. and to be able to play with friends on other devices would be great.
---
Yep, this is pretty much right on the nose. The further away from rank reset in a month the more likely you are to get solo queue games. 
---
I still maintain that there needs to be some sort of indicator to the killer that there is SWF in your lobby so you know what killer/loadout to choose appropriately. Running the wrong build or killer versus a SWF is almost always a loss.
---
Would it be possible to disable bloodlust on new / reworked maps like hawkins and badham?
---
Claudette and Mei. the two science nerds everyone wants to murder in game but can collectively agree that in lore they need to be protected.
---
Monstrous shrine should not show a bubble and aura for survivors hooked in the basement, maybe then it will see some use. Of course SWF will negate it like everything else in this game that's not balanced around SWF at all.
---
Mori time
---
Stare at them, stab them, selfies
---
I often find that you waste a lot of time finding another survivor to heal you. Even with bond. Which means self care is actually more efficent since you can just heal on the spot.
---
Just type it into google translate...? Not everything needs to be posted to reddit.
---
Why did you cencor your message? Let me guess, you gave a toxic response?
---

---
Because some salty survivors are mad that he needs a different playstyle to counter than the usual killers
---
I just want Co-op Killer, man. I just want the Killer part without the being-alone part.
---
Not so hard to get with mah basement hag or basement bubba tbh.
---
And now the dream state being unavoidable really sucks
---
Oh shit it's the buff the killers have been asking for
---
1. When will the fan chase music of the Spirit be added?
---
2. When is Quentin's face rework?
---
I don't intentionally tbag against huntress at pallets, if anything, I'm just trying to dodge the hatchets lol
---
Imagine if the game were first-person, but...
---
...well, even if it were balanced, that's still 80 seconds of staring at generator bits so maybe not.
---
Yeah that sucks i guess. But tbh i kinda understand why they did this. Unfortunately this game has never had such things as external marketplace for skins, like the case of other games like csgo, where you can either buy a skin on steam market or on external sites recommended by the community and approved by Valve. For DBD it was just random people on random sites selling them for hundreds of money, and maybe evn scamming, so it makes sense they want more control over them.
---
&gt;Prevent any exit gates from being opened using the perk Unnerving Presence
---
What's the correlation between opening an exit gate with Unnerving Presence?
---
Next tome will be "Hook a Survivor using Surveillance"
---
My thought process is more of how Insidious is so good on him due to not giving Survivors time to react while letting him know exactly where they will be.
---
DD and Tink give him the ability to Surprise Chainsaw across the map. I don't have the perks unlocked to try it myself yet.
---
You‚Äôre a baby gamer and it was your lucky time.

He‚Äôs pretty balanced imo, you have to juggle a lot with him to really utilize his potential .

Your mistake was not using the Carburetor
---
Lately I've been getting disconnected from the network and kicked to the starting screen right when matches end. It ends with me not getting any BP or challenge completion and keeping all items and offerings. I've messaged survivors after these matches to confirm and they've all gotten their respective rewards for the match. As a killer what do I need to do to stop this from happening, it's occurring in about 1/4th of my killer matches.
---
Is the Vigo‚Äôs Shroud offering (spawn as far as possible from the killer) not working? I‚Äôve used it twice and within 5-10 seconds I was in the terror radius.  Does it not work sometimes or am I just unlucky?
---
I will literally take a 10 minute break after playing killer. I main Trapper and at red ranks I get so stressed out.

^Yes^ the grind isn't actually that bad, and once you reach the end of it, then what? There is no goal or point but to save for the next character. Or prestige for the "slightly better items in the bloodweb" literally no difference, btw. But yeah, 60 petals for a 2 week evemt is stupid. And the entity forces you to take them sometimes. And they barely even pay for themselves, they give almost nothing back, and have no effect on the game, and there is no way to refund them. Selling items for even a tiny bit of bloodpoints back would be better than this.
---
Always run experience offerings if you have them. Also BBQ will help tons with bloodpoints since you said killer main.

To clarify, I did not make this. I changed the title but it rechanged back to the original title. All credit goes to u/Simudinnn and his friends!
---
No, not really, and especially not when crouching.
---
Insidious is good on camperface because he has a good camp ability. He can (mostly) guarantee getting 2 for 1 if nobody realizes he‚Äôs there. 
---
However his chainsaw is very loud and these perks don‚Äôt mask that. So DD+Tink would actually work worse on him compared to other killers if your goal is easy downs, barring wraith. 
---
Tink/DD doesn‚Äôt promise a chainsaw down and most gens open to LOS‚Äôs will see Bubba coming anyways.

i was taught that if you want to get to survivors, head to the furthest generator, because that's where they end up more often than not

Will you add to legacy prestige,It's just not fair for mobile uthers and Console...

Iv just bought cannibal there so I can earn bbq and. Chilli but this‚Äôll help
---
Pretty good job so far?

So many things had to go right for this to happen, the first being the killer having one thumb.
---
yea and it gt worse with dedicate servers
---
Otzdarva has some good Trapper advice on his YouTube alt channel "Not Otzdarva" - beginner builds, advanced builds, and games where he'll step through what he's doing and why. Otz is a Trapper main, so definitely worth your time.
---
What part are you most having difficulty with? You'll get stronger advice if you can be more specific. Trapper needs to set up, so a slowdown perk is pretty vital for him. Survivor gameplay experience is helpful, because you'll want to predict where to put your traps for maximum results. If the problem is looping, bring add-ons that improve your setting speed, so that you can trap (or fake a trap) and force survivors to abandon the loop so that you can land the hit.
---
If you have nothing to slow the game, and if you can't think like a survivor, then you're going to have a tough time with Trapper.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the tbagging
---
Imagine having to climb a ladder in game to escape via the hatch; would work well for maps like the game! 
---
I can just imagine getting pulled from the ladder by a killer.
---
Yeah, if I'm the last survivor and the killer picks me up, I just go limp and hope for the best. If I'm in a chase and injured, I'll just turn around and let the killer get me.  Sometimes that works even better.
---
Everyone soloing rn are probably getting their tome done or trying to get their rank back. The lobbies for survivor rn is pretty bad honestly.

What game is this from? Looks like a nice, nontoxic chat. I can't think of any games like that.

Not all if it. Pallets and chases are the same the only difference is vault. Everything else is outplaying.  Weather it worked is one thing but do get super pissed off when trapper doesn‚Äôt fall for your double back scratch marks?  No you don‚Äôt why? its the same thing.

---
Honestly maybe Tinkerer and Cruel Limits would be a good combo on him, definitely on billy. Get a warning that the gen will be done soon, get to sneak up with tinkerer, all windows are blocked when the gen is finished. Probably way too situational, but could be cool.
---
Ohtofu‚Äôs has a video that successfully used DD with him. Tinkerer makes sense too. I think if you‚Äôre going to do DD you use either Play With Tour Food among with it, or Knockout; you knock your obsession out and run fi he nearest gen.

Why censor your message? I'm guessing because what you said was likely worse...

Yeah man, unbreakable saves your skin so many times it‚Äôs almost laughable. Spine Chill is alright but Unbreakable can single handedly bring back games that otherwise would‚Äôve been completely lost.
---
Can you believe that ending? üëÄ
---
Idk. But if he is we ain‚Äôt getting when.
---
Just a heads up - this thread isn't for questions directed at the devs.
---
Yeah, but usually people who aren't the target want to consent to chases.
---
Exactly, its saved my ass a ton of times, and I'm not sure why I ever took it off, but man, running it after all this time feels *GREAT*
---
Just replace Boil Over with an exhaustion perk, works fine. I ran it for 5 games this weekend and got value out of 2 of them.
---
Bloodlust was made as a band-aid fix for bad map balance. Those 2 maps are now filled with mindgameable pallets and once killer gets bloodlust 1 the mindgames are thrown out of the window and they can get hit without trying.

I'm all for crossplay. And I'd really like for it to be cross-progression (if that's what it's called) where I keep everything I've earned/bought across platforms, like Fortnite. I have no problem buying a new copy of dBd but I don't want to have to rebuy everything.

The flashlights all blind in the exact same time. The "moderately increases the Flashlight Beam's brightness" effect people refer to is only how "bright" the beam is when shined at you. The variables for flashlights desperately need updating, 50% of the addons do absolutely nothing. As of now, the only good addons are the ones that increase duration (batteries, low-amp filament), and the ones that increase blindness duration. Nothing else is worth your time.
---
I mainly dont like gen speeds and brainlessly going to a structure you know is safe several times in a match - everything else is quite balanced rn - even low tier killers can 4k
---
If nothing else, BHVR is king of the band-aids and stat cheats.

"Yeah, Killers have a good kill rate (counting DCs as killers)."

---

Kleiner Junge
---
I dunno, I like to think I balanced them somewhat. Leviathan is a hex perk which means it's more than likely it won't even last long enough to get to 4 tokens, Dark Waters does admittedly make it somewhat harder on solo survivors but it only makes hooked survivors invisible, dying survivors still reveal their auras to other survivors so as long as the others make an effort to check where they went down they can make an educated guess as to where they'd be hooked, and Davey Jones' locker, I mean, some perks are just like that. If decisive can make picking up a survivor unsafe for a full minute then I think it's okay to run, what is in essence, a *very* situational killer perk
---
Yes, I agree. However if they really want to learn nurse it's best to do it when they're a high rank rarther than at red or purple ranks where mistakes will be much less forgiving.
---
Absolutely sick edit.
---
Dead hard currently bugged due to the dedicated servers, but it is pretty meta. Ds is also a meta perk. A lot of people still use self care but it is not as meta as it used to be. Unbreakable is a good combo with DS, but not many people run it. I personally use adrenaline, balanced, dead hard and DS. But sometimes I switch BT with one of the exhaustion perk.
---
About Freddy, he was the weakest killer by far. He needed those rework. He is strong, but not OP at all. IMO he is fine, and I hope they don‚Äôt touch him again.
---
I use it to know if someone is bringing the killer to me or to find injured survivors or survivors working on gens. It is great for avoid killer- help others build since I am bad at chases
---
Cant think of too many legit reasons besides poor internet doing it for you

In the recent DBD survey there was two questions about Cross-play and cross-progression. i would be open for both!!

Yeah it was fun, i watched the whole video the moment it came out, i just wanted to joke for a bit, people took it really badly tho
---
I'm native spanish speaker and can't understand what he means lol. I think when he says pro means "prro" it's like saying dog.
---
I don't doubt for a second that it's that. Which is actually really insulting the players' intelligence. We play the game and they don't, after all.
---
They aren't in the game on switch atm, but once they get the license holders to reagree they will be added back in.
---
Don‚Äôt buy the weapons, get the bodies and head.
---
I don't know but that one pretty much screams Hostage Doc to me. Like for that one I'm going to run the classic 3-gen Unnerving Distressing Overcharge doctor build and play defensively until I eventually win.
---
You can break bloodlust by standing still
---
Blur the names bud
---
Nope, as long as you don‚Äôt hit them and pick them up you‚Äôll keep your tokens
---
I dont care what you want or not. This is a team game and expanding the chase to a claudette hiding in a corner is good for the team
---
If you want to Play solo with your own rules - Play killer
---
Didn't think it was that big of a deal but will do
---
thanks
---
No. A Trapper can keep 8 stacks as long as the obsession steps on traps.
---
Dead by almost sunrise.
---
Killer guy name Bear Trapper: Even McMeelin has the powers to trapping suvivors with bear trap. Has Iron man image mask and can use machete with attack. Bear trap can grab survivor for epic struggle. Will escap immediate.
---
Well okay, I know the bug, happened to me too, but that is hella faster than the normal bug
---
Any tips on how to use flashlight with controller? Because I can‚Äôt aim it right, always fucking up everything :D
---
Why do people do that? Flashlight the killer at the end?
---
Huntress: Russian
---
No new maps but we are getting new tiles.
---
The past hallow event i got the trappers body and head since his weapon isnt that great. Im planning to get the whole hag skin though
---
I agree, use the perks you want to use. Every perk can be useful if used in the right way.
---
One thing I would consider, however, is taking off Technician and putting on Spine Chill. It will slightly shrink the size of the skill check zone, but the more you practice that way, the better you get at skill checks, and when you take spine chill off, the larger success zone will feel very easy to hit. It is pretty much a baptism of fire with the skill checks.
---
You can also keep spine chill in order to avoid conflicts and chases by getting a heads up when the Killer is approaching so you can sneak away. I would watch PainReliever's youtube video on using spine chill. He plays as a stealthy survivor, and he uses spine chill very effectively to avoid chases.
---
Also, if you are having trouble with skill checks, you may want to check your hardware settings.  If you are playing on console, make sure your TV is set to "Game Mode." I was having this problem because there was a tiny bit of lag and delay when the skill check would appear, which made me miss most of my skill checks. If you are playing on PC, you really shouldn't be having this problem, unless you are using a television as your monitor, but you may want to check your monitor's settings anyways.
---
*asthma*
---
That's the problem with their weird conditional or "do it all at once" challenges. They force people to be sweaty about a goal, often ruining the game for everyone else.
---
I get your point, but at least don‚Äôt accept their friend requests and leave the lobby as soon as possible
---
Sometimes i get spotted, I get no notification as to what direction or who it even was.
---
Then don‚Äôt fucking tunnel.
---
Incredible
---
&gt; No new maps but we are getting new tiles.
---
What tiles where the so called leaks shown? If it shrine i already explained that it already is in the game.
---
All because dad had a bad day at work
---
Don't forget Plunderer's Ace going for the tome chest challenge while you die on the hook.
---
Continously exploiting glitches in the game
---
He has an add on that cancels that though and failed skill checks dont wake you up you have to go to an alarm and it gives the killer an alert
---
I do. I'm a Killer main. I also main Dwight as Survivor and use Bond to avoid teammates in chases.
---
LETS DO THIS
---
hhhHAA!
---
what perks do u use on her?
---
Woll Smoth is unamused.
---
I love it when guys teabag after throwing pallets down. Also I don't mind when they blind me either. It's pretty rare that blinding me was better than just running as soon as they saw I was breaking the pallet.
---
Camping
---
Thank you I appreciate it. I haven‚Äôt heard anything, and have tried googling everywhere.
---
Veronica still chasing little village girls*
---
Correction: He got banned **3** times
---
If you have watched his videos you will know how toxic he is. Ochido have been encouraging and spreading toxicity since the launch of this game. He also raided a lot of others twitch channels. If you are wondering, yes, ochidos is one of the reasons why dbd is so toxic.
---
Thats all basically, besides some other ***serious*** things
---
Personally I am getting Spirit and Wraith (I missed last year). Hag is pretty damn cool though and I would buy it if I played her more.
---
On ps4 if you hold the sprint button but hold the direction stick back you can walk really slow, but does that leave scratch marks? Does only full sprint leave scratch marks?
---
Bag lady teleports through walls but is really tired
---
I completely agree. If survivors get comms, we get the ability to kill. And even then, it‚Äôs with a rare/ultra rare offering. Comms are free.
---
Uhhh...

HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!

It's really more gen difficulty than speed. Holding M1 isn't fun. Somehow, just pressing Q once in Identity V was way more pleasant, but then there's the nothing you do after that's boring.
---
At what rank? Baby Survivors have a much harder time than baby Killers in a balanced match. Even without SWF, though, red rank isn't going to see a lot of Doctor, Legion, or Clown 4ks.
---
But why? Why would you do that?
---
Rugby player injures himself on purpose
---
Just thought it was a fun idea
---
They just need to touch up the mask and look of the skin. Also make his walk abit more "weightly".
---
Holy shit, thank you Otzdarva! 
---
Hahaha, I've watched you since Dark Souls and absolutely love the DbD content. Very fun seeing you on Reddit still :)
---
Thank you!
---
MOBA
---
No, 8m high rank and see it. I swore you hey penalized for being closed to the person hooked.
---
totally worth imo
---
I like using a heal build. I play solo so it's fun to play utility. 
---
Empathy, botany, borrowed and we'll make it. 
---
Yes, I know botany doesn't work with We'll make it, it's used incase I don't get the save.
---
I always play solo and this is too accurate. Solo Survivor is a total dice roll if I get decent teammates. But I can never relax as killer.
---
Idk maybe I'm a simp but whenever people do that or they just crouch and look up at me I just find it so hard to kill them like idk why. When I dont have time though I usually hit them before I can persuaded to let them live.
---
Oh, so I can stand there and kill two or three people camping and then bot cano the other and still pip? I'm seeing all too much.
---
Play trapper, put bear trap at the bottom,???, profit
---
I play at red ranks, got 3 right now since i dont play much, i often play Brown addons legion,or wraith with increased speed and reapperance time, sometimes i will go with plague and i manage to do quite well
---
Exactly like take your brown toolbox. You've earned it from not being a dickhead.
---
I think the how original statement was construed as negative. Have a not-downvote to help out.
---
Pizza delivery man only shoots up needles in closets
---
In my experience, Coldwind Farm, and Backwater Swamp realms have good maps for Plague. Anything with wide open spaces and low obstacles. Autohaven probably has some good variants as well, but Azarov's can be difficult unless you force a 3 gen.
---
Extra bloodpoints usually
---
I am aware of the dickhead plays going on here, I usually don't slug ever pretty much. But what was I gonna do? Not slaughter them all??
---
Yes, but if I healed every time I was injured in a game, I would be spending minutes healing, instead of pressuring gens or getting unhooks. The reason getting healed by one or two teammates is better is because it happens faster, and is therefore more likely to finish before getting interrupted. Self-care causes players to be absent from the game for 32 seconds if they get the full heal. Do you know how much time that is in this game? two survivors can nearly finish a gen in that time, you could get an unhook before the next survivor is hooked, or heal up a slug while the killer is chasing someone else. Being absent for 32 seconds takes so much pressure off the killer it's ridiculous. Essentially, getting a hit on someone with self-care literally removes a survivor from the game for at least 32 seconds. If I see people self-caring while I'm slugged or hooked it physically pains me, just complete an objective and we can heal each other, I wouldn't have been able to do anything on hook/slugged, but if you save me, all of a sudden there is an entire extra survivor to work on objectives, and in the time it would've take you to heal yourself, I'll get unhooked and we'll both be healed.

This was supposed to be like - oh another otz post, great do more - but it backfired badly ;(

I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm stupidüò£
---
When I play killer, I generally go for my BBQ stacks and then just fuck around and have fun, while letting the survivors live (unless I have an achievement/daily). Most people enjoy it and are thankful. Some will still insult me in post game chat. Some will claim they outplayed me, when I clearly let them go. Some will have no idea what was going on. 
---
Fact is, you simply can‚Äôt please everyone. So my recommendation is to try and play nice (or at least fair) and have fun. Laugh at the people that send those rude messages. The fact that they care so much over a video game is entertaining.
---
IDK, but to me it signals these challenges aren't designed for red rank play. UP doesn't do anything against survivors with a lot of hours
---
Solo killer &gt; solo survivor
---
Awesome, I was afraid to try it out with him.
---
Bro. Prayer beads, incest ring, spirit, and those perks is insane. I got it from monto. I did it once and felt so fucking bad. But also incest ring makes me go so fast that I drift into every object on the map.
---
I use urban evasion and play normally, it gives me an advantage maybe one time per match but it feels weird for me crouching without it now
---
Injured Meg hiding 5 feet away as killer hooks you so no one comes to help.
---
Claudette leaving gen every time her spine chill goes off even when the injured obsession is being chased and she should have empathy.
---
No mither David screaming as you're finishing a gen 15 feet from killer making you take chase instead.
---
Dweet showing up at 80% last gen to hump instead of help when you're injured, he isn't, and I'm using adrenaline.
---
4 edgy teens please BBC (big black claws)
---
That's because ranking up is more dependent on your playtime than your actual skill. Anyone can hit red ranks if they play long enough, so pipping does not mean I had a fun game.
---
Are you dumb he took a photo of the screenshot
---
How many survs do you have in your fucking match?
---
Nsfw
---
Same here! 4ks don‚Äôt matter. Just have fun and enjoy yourself.
---
Mm. He doesn't need a NERF, but knowing who revealed you is pretty BS. Wouldn't have minded seeing that swapped for something else.
---
But really, GF is just OP COMPARATIVELY. He's Michael with T1's advantages never going away combined with Pig's crouch but faster and with a lean. So buff both of them and GF won't look so dirty.
---
Here‚Äôs a really weird idea, what if ‚Äúweaker‚Äù killers gen time was longer than that of easier ones. So here spirit stays at 80 seconds or changes slightly, but wraith goes up to 90 or 100 seconds or something like that. Don‚Äôt ask me what numbers work for each killer, but it may be interesting
---
As a killer main you should know you apply little to no pressure if you dont down people as fast as possible unless you run some characters (legion, plague) or builds that profit from people being injured - other then that people can heal as fast as 8 seconds leasing you with nothing
---
you got me, im gonna delete myself.
---
Yea I guess, but one game was against ghost face and I spawned in with a meg, and she was exposed within 15 seconds like he was right on top of us
---
Lmfaooooo love the song edit
---
Get BBQ and chilli teachable and play legion you can easily get 45-50k a game
---
is this from otzdarva :)
---
This hasn't happened to me since for awhile.  I don't get anything below 13. I usually get gree or purple killers.
---
STBFL is often considered one of Trapper's best perks because Bear Traps are unaffected by it. If you trap a non-obsession you can hit them immediately for a free stack. If you trap the obsession, you can pick them up straight from the trap without losing stacks.
---
Good work doling out that bad medicine ;P 
---
Last guy find the hatch?
---
Stbfl on nurse is op
---
All these nerds picking Silent Hill when you included Deadly Premonition like a true gentleman.
---
Tbh I just leave right after the match so I don't see any in-game messages. Namely because I know I'd want to be super toxic because of it
---
The concern is that it'd split queues, to which I say make another mode that still has rocky balance (as any new mode would) and try to lure in more players with it while having it also act as casual.
---
Devs have no confirmed a date yet, anything at this point would just be speculation.
---
When the bell tolls at midnight, Australian spiders eat their prey
---
I'm very immersed.
---
Immersed in gens.
---
Because I suck at Chase
---
I know, spirit‚Äôs little growls on the menu screen are so cute
---
The items you get from the boxes, do you keep them if you survive the match?
---
Yeah I asked this because it wasn‚Äôt clear on the perk description. Thank God they answered so I can stop using it
---
Due to the wording of the perk description ("An *additional* 8%"...), some people have been lead to believe the perk has an overall regression of 18%. And apparently that's not the case.
---
BACK INTO THE TRASH IT GOES!
---
No dates yet, the devs will talk about that whenever it's ready.
---
Doing God's work.
---
Legion sounded like disguising as Survivor, then like Multi-Killer mode.
---
Ghostface I had pegged for multi-Killer 3 years ago.
---
I agree
---
I asked this because I wanted Surge to be good. Too bad it‚Äôs trash
---
Yup! As long as you survive and they're still in your hands as you leave.
---

---
I only chase them to get my BBQ stack
---
With all the talks of Scream 5 in development, maybe they‚Äôll be able to fork up some money. But I * highly* doubt it.
---
Because he broke a totem.
---
I still wouldn‚Äôt expect it for a long while. They‚Äôre struggling with dedicated servers, I can only imagine how bad crossplay on said servers would be
---
That's why no challenges should be "do it in 1 trial." It prolongs the suffering.
---
You should also be able to pick a Killer and a Survivor challenge simultaneously so it's less of a shuffle to track.
---
Imma get my stabbin' pipe!
---
We all wanted Surge to be good. If it did 18% overall, it actually could have shaped up to be the second best gen-regression perk in the game.
---
But... 8%.
---
Doesnt empathy not work if said injured survivor is in direct contact of the killer? 
---
Its hilarious either way lol
---
&lt;Noding Demogorgon asking for a farming session.
---
He's actually givin advice, u gonna spend 80 seconds self healing, when in a lot of matches killers run sloopy/thanatophobia, is much better using a medkit, u can combine it with botany knowledge for more efficiency, or use farmacy to get a free medkit, self care sucks if u compare it with those other options
---
TBF the wording supports this, and i dont see why anyone thought differently. It says it starts regressing, and adds 8% to it. Starting regression isn't 10%
---
So stand still while killer is bloodlusting their mind out, refusing to break the pallet in loop? Got it.
---
Same here. It might be an okay time saver but I think I would rather use something like PGTW that actually regresses the gen properly and I can choose which one to regress.
---
Thanks for asking the question, and hopefully you don¬¥t mind me posting it here.

Crazy tall guy makes a shocking discovery that he enjoys hitting people with a club
---
killer isnt stressful for me, just incredibly boring
---
feels like there is a much lower skill ceiling for the types of things you can do in all but 3 or 4 killers
---
Anyone who says this game is a 10 needs to go play league or some shit DBD is nowhere near as toxic as some games
---
Hey, Plague's chalice and Pig's melee prestiges are same deal. 
---
At least on Nancy you can tell you have prestige her fully or not.
---
 Not at all. I actually wanted to raise awareness so people can stop using it
---
Yessss go you!
---
It's enough to make a man reeee.
---
Isn't DCing the highest at red ranks?
---
It's because the perk says it "causes generators to _explode_" and then cause an _additional_ 8% regression. Generators exploding from failed skill checks do instantly regress the generator by 10%. But I guess Surge is a _different_ kind of explosion.
---
Nice, now there's seem to be a good incentive to dig through them.
---

this is so stupid i love it

No, it's just the only way to play the game.

They can break chase while still being followed by the killer, cause ive definitely had a few unwanted deliveries courtesy of dwight mains
---
Use borrowed. Every unhook is a safe unhook.
---
dcs should count
---
That would be cool, but I'm playing now on PS4 because PC killers are way better at the game than console players (at rank 20, probably because it was a PS+ free game). 
---
So, it has been good to play on console only to learn, since I was being destroyed on PC.
---
Try and get as close as possible before uncloaking or even body blocking someone in a corner wraiths biggest strength is how good he is at getting an early hit
---
Got all achievements long ago and that was the only reason I was concerned about ranks. Reaching certain ranks are part of achievement for both Surv and Killers. 
---
And to be honest yellow to green ranks are best experience. Yeah it can be taxing to play solo surv on those ranks but I enjoy that too, after playing this game for 2k hours you can be mostly desensationalize for most of the game but when you are alone watching your team die, it keeps you up for the thrill.
---
And even if I die, I just laugh at my silly mistake and move on. Playing Killer is fun too at these ranks because they are not abusing weak game mechanics even with SWf and I keep it very balanced and fair.

Hi, I saw Level 4 of the Tome, and I wanted to ask if there are any plans to change them? Every person I know thinks they‚Äôre super hard, and so do I. Almost all of them are very situational, and seem downright impossible. I‚Äôve been stressed about it ever since I saw them.
---
Since this is now a thread for positive events now:
---
Just last game I had a trapper who spent the entire game staring at his ruin totem, I went from 3 of my archives survivor heals to completing the challenge and He was nice enough to let us all heal once we escaped his noed facecamp and reached the exit gate
---
It was a fun game :D

What's the easiest way to get the 4 man hatch escape achievement as a solo-only with potato team mates?

Because no matter how nice you are as a killer if you do something a survivor doesnt like, such as winning, you are deemed toxic by the council of cucks.
---
Generally when phasing during a chase the Spirit loses the chase making the music turn off. This can be countered with Iron Will but the Spirit can counter that with Stridor.
---
I keep getting gen rushed when I play Myers, and I really need a build to counter that, and ideas?
---
I have no idea what could have happened lol
---
I really dont see how yelling to the killer "HERE I AM!!!" with a loud ass notifaction while injured is a good idea but okay.
---
Got to get 2 killer blinds for archive
---
I got no problem hearing shit. I use hyper cloud 2. I havent played spirit in a long time but i think once phasing, the chase is interrupted. Anyway, i use it to walk near gens and hear them working on it and then attack. Once attack, i can hear them cry louder during phase.
---
After that, if youre in a chase, it's more of a guessing game to play mind tricks to catch them from behind. I only use phase to stealth attack.
---
‚ÄúI just lack the knowledge that the smarter people have(the devs)‚Äù
---
The devs are regular people too, they have good and bad ideas. No need to suck them off in this post.
---
Corrupt intervention being a game mechanic would be op, it would be easier to find survivors at the start in addition to getting an extra perk. This would lead to players hiding for the first couple of minutes until corrupt is gone and the start on gens.
---
If you were playing as the doctor and the last man got out through hatch
---
Dude I used to paint Warhammer 40K and this is bringing back a wave of the passion I had for painting the miniatures. Great job, amazing detailing. How rough was the 3D print texture-wise?
---
You lose chase music like halfway through phasing but those first 6 seconds are the most important.
---
And yet you‚Äôre STILL continuing the ‚Äúargument‚Äù and have also run out things to say so you instead have fallen back to insults. 
---
Ok sweetheart.

Claudette's charm looks suspiciously like a Funko doll.

Is it teabagging if you're not crouching over a dead guy's face?

This subject ended like, a while ago.

I meant on stream
---
Ruin or Corrupt Intervention are the gold standards to slow the game down. You'll probably need one of them to combat the gen rushing. Sorry it's not the most creative answer, but it's the best one lol
---
I find killer queues are shorter. Green rank right now after reset, but before reset it was same.
---
Queue is long though on yellow..that was a pain during double blood point weekend
---
Guess Im lucky then.
---
Yeah surviviors are toxic asf. Ex rank 2 now rank 12 jake main. If you gonna waste time teabegging killer and not doing gens. I will body block you at pallets and farm you of hook. You created me surviviors - but i will not be toxic to killers who give me fun, but to you 1generator at 12min swf teabegging useless thrash

David King says the n word in his new perk that replaces No Mither
---
Why even watch other streamers when they can't pull off this move
---
Maybe lag. It was a bit laggy but idk lol
---
Even with 18 percent it would still not be top tier...it generally only really targets 1 gen unless you are really lucky on some maps, and even then has an awful chance of whiffing (non-basic attacks don¬¥t count, grabs like lockers or unhooks don¬¥t count, survivor managing to lead you even a bit away of the gen whiffs it), AND it has a cooldown...PGTW always regresses 25 on the gen of your choosing on ANY hooks. 
---
At this point it really only was nice on M1 stealthy killers *in combo* with Surveillance...an awful lot of limitations. The fact that it is only 8 percent just dropped it to trash tier.
---
The chase is based off the husk of the Spirit so when the survivor breaks chase by going far from the husk it stops the chase music and you're able to hear better.
---
When doing a pallet mindgame you should mainly rely on vision as you can still see grass moving and see scratch marks.
---
I mean, in general I like being chased, I like taking aggro off my team, as most likely I'll last longer than them in chase. If the killer is chasing someone else they'll either have to drop chase and go back to the hook, allowing that survivor to do gens, or keep chasing, allowing both of you to either heal or do gens.
---
No mither is the N word in DBD
---
Doin' gens. You?
---
How far long until you punish people who DC? I've been playing since cannibal release and I strongly believe this is a MUST.

Weapon: Backup Pistol
---
When the cop sees a Claudette, Tapp or Adam, the cop is able to pull out his backup pistol and fire shots that instantly and permanently down the said survivors. He can then mori them without needing to hook.
---
‚ÄúStop Resisting! Stop Resisting!‚Äù - the cop
---
Yeah I had similar ideas, much better than Ruin which is too dependent on RNG, aka it gets found immediately or stands the entire game.
---
what did i just read üëÄ
---
The actor who played Quentin tweeted at the devs about getting his face redone and Matthew Cote responded saying to get in touch. So nothing confirmed but seems like a good sign
---
Right, but the difference between Pop and Surge is that *you have to go out of your way to use Pop.* Sometimes you have to choose to chase a Survivor or Pop a gen, which can be a really hard call to make. Sometimes you just don't even *use* Pop, like how sometimes Surge just whiffs. When Killer is a game of saving seconds, the fact that you didn't have to go out of your way to use something like Pop and get an auto (what should have been) 18% off a gen would be fantastic.
---
Buuuut it's 8%. So yeah, trash tier. But it _could_ have been the second best perk IMO. Second best would be either Surge or Pop, definitely. Just depends on the Killer, I believe.
---
Literally fuck Pennywise. BRING IN JASON!
---
People with this loadout usually are the ones that complain about the game
---
8 stacks equals to %40 faster cooldown.If we take your numbers(20 secs),%40 of 20 is 8. Which equals to 12 seconds,yes
---
I would love gens if they were like minigames/puzzles, or gotta look the map for spare parts, cables, and gas, maybe. 
---
I love playing survivor, but totally hate click holding simulator.
---
Alot of the time as much as I like playing doctor I dont play hunter because of the stress even if I die alot
---
Would be cool to see some survivors from horror franchises like Sally from TCM, Sidney from Scream, Tommy from F13.
---
Lol it really do feel like that when you‚Äôre on console

Surge, overcharge, ruin, and a perk of your choice.  
---
It helps slow down games.
---
That's probably outdated information. Self Care got nerfed a while ago.
---
I see myself. Thanks for the reminder, haha
---
You‚Äôd be correct my friend
---
Stress city was me trying to get adept Ghost face on a corn map. Spoiler alert: I killed two. 
---
Though the perk Thrilling Tremors really surprised me at how useful it was. Thanks stupid achievements.
---
Congrats, it‚Äôs a big first step I hear
---
The other point of bloodlust is that the survivor is meant to go down. The game isn‚Äôt about escaping chases it‚Äôs about distracting the killer as long as possible. If they bloodlust then you are doing pretty good.
---
Maybe one day when his lawsuit regarding his character ends. I can see it happening since the devs of the Friday the 13th The Game abandoned the game.
---
Currently still yellow and it is a climb to gtfo it.
---
His lawsuit is so dumb
---
Any chance of giving the Trapper a buff? Start with all his traps and you can‚Äôt break the traps ?
---
The basement builds on Hag are evil
---
HAHA damn why you doing my boy like that
---
Most likely not since they are from other movie and game franchises. Its very rare when they agree to let BHVR create a new cosmetic for them.
---
I could try but I'm not that good at drawing. Let's say...... Soon‚Ñ¢
---
Oh shit, I didn't know this. Something to do after work today bois!
---
Those are good upsides, and for most matches there'll be no issues, but Huntress and Nurse have significant accuracy advantages with a mouse and keyboard setup (Clown does too, but Clown is Clown).
---
BBQ, Ruin, Nurses, Whispers is the build I'm running and having quite a success with. You can switch Whispers for a different tracking perk, Discordance for example. Also, Monitor works surprisingly well on her as her lullaby won't tell which way you're coming from and she already has smaller TR. For perks, the strongest combo is Iri head and Infantry belt but you'll get a LOT of dc for using that. So because of that, I use hatchet winding up time speed up around with hindering axes. Exhaustion addons can be fun too, people don't usually expect Hunzress running them.
---
You don't have to it would be cool if you did
---
yeah, that's what I mean by perkless. I'm too busy leveling up my steve to p3 so I don't really want to dump any amount of points in demogorgon even though he looks fun and I want to try him out
---
Everybody hates chris season 3 episode 3 ;)
---
Trapper is doing pretty well as it is. Im thinking he should be able to carry 1 or 2 more traps. Besides disarming traps immediately alerts you to the survivors location
---
400hrs user here. Last night I decided to play The Nurse after a nerf, since I had two daily rituals for her, one hitting survivors and the other sacrificing at least 2 survivors. I got the new Stranger Things map, I knew I was fucked. I ended up getting hitting survivors after teleporting but not the other since they all escaped. And thank you to the Meg who made sure to stay at the exit to run around me and then T-bag me. Thank you so much for that. This is why I will fucking camp and tunnel if necessary. And one time I don't, they think they hot shit.
---
Direct contact means they're touching, right? Not if theyre being chased
---
And then they say: "Why did you tunnel???" Noob killer.
---
Thank you! I use Whispers already and it's pretty good and I already get alot of dcs for using unrelenting, BBQ, and Whispers.
---
Yes. You also keep the items from fallen commrades.
---
Might be a rework coming up, at least Not_Queen hinted at it in the r/pcgaming AMA.
---
In response to "Will there ever be a legion rework or update?"
---
"You should see something on that subject very SOON‚Ñ¢. But because it is unannounced at the moment, I sadly cannot give you more details."
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/dy4ynv/ama_we_are_behaviour_interactive_the_devs_behind/f7yjdar/
---
My recommendation is play the game the way you want to. Do not let some random loser who has no life ruin your games. That's why I run a survivor destroyer build. I'm jaded and 3-4k most of my games.
---
Hex: No Escape.
---
It's like she's auditioning for a part in the Exorcist
---
The rank, the double exhaustion perks, the legend
---
Sucks because you‚Äôre forced to try and determine what the killer wants and if he doesn‚Äôt give you hatch then you just lost out those extra bp
---
I mean why wait? bvhr can still go in while the suit is going they just have to play it smarter than the guys who did f13.
---
There was nothing about playing as a survivor here. Its just you blaming other people?
---
*aggressive dinosaur running sounds*
---
Because of said lawsuit
---
Thanks, I'll give it a look.
---
9 times out of 10 I'm usually the guy who gets my team out of the shit and I get the majority of unhooks and gens while never even once seeing another member of the team. And then I get hooked at the end and I see all three of them standing in the exit gate teabagging a killer who isn't even fucking there before leaving and not even trying to help.
---
Im not even sure how they're gonna do DBD on mobile lol. I'll just have to wait and see though.
---
The way to enjoy low tier Killers is to go into the match expecting a 1/2K. The only way you're gonna consistently 4K on low tier Killers is if you go big time sweaty or the Survivors are super altruistic and you're not beyond taking advantage of it. I just throw on BBQ, get my four stacks, and then get the points I can get. If I walk out of the match with 40,000+ BP I'm pretty happy.
---
Outdoors in general, with tall blockers specifically. Normal/low blockers aren't a hindrance to her purge, but survivors will see you coming a mile away. With tall blockers they get less warning, and her height combined with sprinkler Purge means you've a good chance of still landing your power.
---
Indoor maps are her kryptonite - if you end up in one, best to start planning your 3-gen *early*.
---
Unrelenting is a pretty bad pick as your main focus is to hatchet people down instead of meeleeing them. If you want to use something that all killers have, you can go for Iron grasp or Noed (only if you don't give a hit about salty survivors though).
---
Depends on the map
---
Makes prestiging much more viable
---
Otz since your here can you make a plague build that is focused on getting survivors to cleanse? Im a plag main
---
Surge is serviceable. But all his other unique perks don't really work for him in 99% of situations.
---
Also, I want to point out, with Demogorgon, stairs are your best friends. Shred/lunge completely ignores the vertical distance of stairs. I always catch survivors going for the window vault, shredding from the bottom of the steps.
---
It's really powerful, especially in Hawkins, where there are stairs everywhere.
---
That could work well, and it would make survivors roam the map giving the killer more opportunities to encounter them.
---
I use unrelenting when Survivors 360 me so when I miss I can just hit them from a fast recovery from missing
---
Fuckin' orange.
---
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQRDijaX5Io) is arguably the best Huntress guide I've ever watched. Covers everything you need to know - made my life *significantly* easier.
---
I've only ever played solo, and play as killer too, depending on my mood and how much free time I have. I play with chat and messaging blocked and with no headset. Am I missing out?
---
Get two Apple add-ons with Infectious, M&amp;A and Whispers and just do it yourself. Sometimes survivors will be very stubborn. Only one way to guarantee your power.
---
a lot of the times it really isn't, especially if the survivor you're dropping the killer off of is in a bad position. Like you mentioned in one of your replies, the Claudette hiding in a corner probably isn't gonna last more than 10 seconds because she's out positioned and you just gave the killer a quick down.
---
While forcing the killer to switch targets can be a good thing to help the former survivor heal up or regain exhaustion, dumping the killer randomly on a survivor in a dead zone isn't a good strategy.
---
Ghostface: feeling murderous might delete later
---
Then you just mori them with rancor.
---
Fuck 'em
---
I dont see her being fat, just different opinions.
---
Sure thing, use whatever perks you prefer. Eventually, you'll become a great killer and people won't be able to 360 you. GL!
---
So just Myers perks gangs?
---
Thank you king otz I will make a video of this
---
If you are at lower ranks and are a good killer you could probably carry him up to green ranks without too much trouble. You will just need to play very smart though.
---
Yea
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true. I definitely think I‚Äôve gotten them for the same killer multiple times. Although I don‚Äôt see them much anymore so maybe I‚Äôm wrong
---
Most likely started ignoring it
---
Actually I was doing the challenge, don't usually use self care.
---
Otz my maaaaaaaaan
---
Exactly,
---
**YELLING CORPSE GLITCHES REALITY**
---
He‚Äôs out there, looking for beans
---
Sounds like it‚Äôs time for Monto‚Äôs Bubba‚Äôs basement build
---
Who cares if they get mad at you, mute chat. They aren't on your team.
---
No, you‚Äôre awesome!
---
Lmfao Naw I‚Äôll stick with my no mither, resilience, this is not happening, and prove thy self...
---
G pro wireless is as good or better then any corded mouse I've ever used.
---
I don't have prove thy self teachable so I use iron will over it
---
I‚Äôve been playing for more than 2 years and I‚Äôve never had it happen solo. It‚Äôs possible, just unlikely since rando‚Äôs are rarely good enough to survive through the gens.
---
Lmao I didn‚Äôt see that you said with an add on in the first comment my bad .
---
Loved it
---
Maybe they could change it, give normal self heal speed, with reduces skillcheck zones and reduced or gone medkit buff, there are situations in that selfcare could save ur ass, for example medkit depleted, medkit lost because of franklins, no teammates near, etc.
---
 The idea of the perk is good, but against killers that want to keep you injured or that can oneshot you, just sucks.
---
Well, the first person hooked down there is usually going to die. The others need to focus on doing gens and avoid the area around the basement. Unless Bubba messes up down there, it's going to get ugly if anyone goes for a save.
---
His power is like a built in deer stalker but without requiring a survivor downed. Makes it easy to locate survivors but it kinds forgoes his powers potential free hit if spotted to where he has to then work for it instead of sneaking up on someone.
---
Sounds balanced, But survivors got to adapt
---
My friends run it too even tho I'm just fine with Lithe, Alert, DS, and I honestly can't remember the last one
---
Not that the new hatch changes made things any easier for killers.
---
Or the fact that chests seem to be going bonkers giving out keys lately
---
Those are sick ruin plays u silly silly survivorman
---
Demogorgon: Hangry pet
---
I wasn't even aware of that. I've been playing for almost a year and I never saw that. Yeah they need to take that feature out. Trapper is pretty tough without the sabotage though.
---
Survivors aren't a team (unless it's a swf) its every man for himself with a similar objective
---
Not right now but likely soon. In the most recent survey by BHVR they asked how important this is to the community so I imagine that it‚Äôll be implemented somewhat soon. I really hope it is because I‚Äôve been wanting to get the game on pc but don‚Äôt want to do the grind. I just finished unlocking all the perks on Xbox, I refuse to do that again
---
You kinda thicc tho üò≥
---
It also makes you 500% more likely to be the first survivor found.
---
I love to run Ruin, Overcharge, BBQ, and Iron Maiden. I play mostly ranged so Iron maiden will help you get hatchets faster
---
You failed the vibe check, hand over your vibing privleges! üò°
---
You literally can‚Äôt see her. It‚Äôs a cosplay.
---
No, she won‚Äôt sleep with you.
---
She's very clearly overweight, I'm not sure why thats so hard to accept especially when I'm not even saying it as if there's something massively wrong with it
---
As someone else mentioned the devs don‚Äôt read this thread. But I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre working on that glitch since it‚Äôs pretty annoying. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll have it fixed somewhat soon
---
OAGHHH
---
Why tbag...
---
Meh it ain‚Äôt too bad I only solo and always make it to red ranks.
---
If you're on console (XB1, PS4), the killer may spawn in before the survivors do, as they are the game host.
---
Boring and overdone by many on here already.
---
It's because you said "how original..." like it was a  lazy post or something. Sounds negative.
---
It would need to hurt the killer quite hard in order for it not to be able to be used to just kill someone right away and tunnel them down.
---
Disobedience: For a brief moment, your connection to the entity is completely severed. You feel pity and remorse for what you have done and are able to unhook a hooked survivor. Approach the hook, and press the active ability button. You will remove the survivor from the hook, they will be restored to a full health state, and be move at 150 movement speed for 5 seconds. Disobeying the Entity causes you to be stunned while your intimate connection  is re-established. You will earn 50% additional bloodpoints awarded post game if any survivor is sacrificed after this action.
---
Disobedience cannot be performed if there are active bear traps or clown gas within 16 meters of the hook.
---
The game is balanced in 4 categories - 3 of which are purely team based , survivors are a team whether you like it or not
---
Hex: Ruin
---
\*vosssssssssh sound from distance\*
---
No, devs specifically said that was a one time thing. Besides, us console players didn‚Äôt have the same grind. Legacy was given because everything used to be way more expensive and bp gains were much smaller. Legacy was their way of saying ‚Äúhey, you had to put in more work than play players from here out to prestige, here‚Äôs a reward‚Äù. Us console players didn‚Äôt go through the same grind so legacy isn‚Äôt earned.
---
Yeah this is totally me as a killer. 
---
Like I can be cool about lots of thing but this and Adrenaline are like salt in my cake frosting.
---
Jason is already in the game. He just has a different name. Same went for leatherface before they got the license.
---
Thing is the Halloween cosmetics are on killers I play sometimes. I will probably get hags since I use her the most out of all the cosmetics.
---
He‚Äôs playing on pc
---
 When you come up with the next chapter, do you take into account the concepts of characters from fans?
---
Looks awesome!
---
Not yet, thanks for reminding me c:
---
Its insanity but I think it shows those who don't play Killer. Can't tell you how many times I've hooked, taken like 3 steps away then the unhook notification goes off.
---
Oh there goes my plans for the weekend i guess. 
---
The cosplay looks cute son, of course she won't sleep with me, was just a compliment.
---
Would the remake of F13 be possible to have in DBD? They managed to get the remake of nightmare on elm street so it might be possible.
---
My boyfriend just said the same thing. As he‚Äôs Trapper...
---
But getting like a Camp Crystal Lake Map... HOW COOL!! Bringing in perks for Jason how cool.
---
 New survivors based on the movie franchise.
---
You‚Äôre right, but you‚Äôre gonna get downvoted for it. This sub is way too quick to downvote anything they disagree with or don‚Äôt understand
---
This is Reddit man, 99% of all content here is just reposts.
---
Because people are immature and can‚Äôt control their dying need to butt dance killers.
---
It's usually because if you do bad you get bullied for doing bad and if you do good you get bullied for doing bad
---
Wow a good idea of a survivor for once. Seems too late tho since the movie is already out.
---
Behavior: *Adds the Cop*
---
Adam &amp; Claudette: *Having panic attacks*
---
He's not bad, but recommend getting a few decent perks first
---
All of them. And yet still die on first hook
---
Because 5 minute games are fun for killers üôÉ
---
I always play doctor killer games and after the game they either left or they don't write anything and just leave.
---
I love the doctor.
---
Lol that's a joke right, 4/5 games ruin goes down in less than 30 seconds unless the killer sits on it, do you even realise survivors have literally over 5 ways to find totems without even looking. I wish there was a way to disable survivor perks all the same like let me be able to get rid of DS the way ruin is, when you go to red ranks, no one cares about ruin like literally 2 minutes and all gens will be done with ruin up,
---
Could someone link the actual AMA? I really don't wanna dig through that sub, unless it's pinned
---
Yes when the End Game Collapse was introduced. Survivors only have 2 minutes when the doors open.
---
Hi
---
lmao that's nasty
---
I personally would like to see Pinhead from Hellraiser
---
If Ruin is such a useless perk then why is everyone using it?
---
Yep. Once I get you into the basement, you probs not getting out.  
---
Sometimes I go with STBFL with basement hags to more easily defend basement from dives.
---
The RBTs (helmets) now have to be put on before the last gen pops for them to activate. If they are put on after the last gen, they never activate, and you can escape with them on.
---
This change happened about 6 months ago, I think.
---
If you‚Äôre getting good use out of it, don‚Äôt worry if it‚Äôs not seen as a good perk. You are making it work for you; what more can you s ask for?
---
Its not a useless perk, but its mandatory with how the game is currently, otherwise you have to play billy or spirit to have the slightest of a chance
---
Not that flashlighting is any toxic, but ‚Äúdeserving to be messed with‚Äù really?
---
"Jah" yeah no thanks
---
Killer perks/addons
---
Still waiting for another
---
Claudette MVP
---
Playing on a Nokia 3210
---
he's not fun to play against. up there with spirit and doctor on "least fun games you will ever have"
---
Like?? , seriously what perk is purely designed for kicking gens
---
No dont fuck pennywise
---
Yeah i know how that feels, been playing survivor for over 2 years and just started playing the nurse about 4 or 5 weeks ago.
---
I know i'm not that good and i try to improve, but most of the time i'm having fun even though i get zero only  one hook, and i try and not to tunnel or camp surviors, because i know how shitty that is. But every time i had one really good game, like a 3 or 4k, i get at least 2 games with survivors that, once they notice that i'm not that good, start teabagging, running all together to confuse and/or annoy me and that can be really frustrating, most of the time that's when i say fu** it and equip noed and a mori and i'm not being a friendly nurse anymore
---
Why does Monto use 3 different add ons to protect his keys? He explained it before but it made zero sense to me. The white ward protects everything so it seems a little pointless to bring in the other 2 add ons. Also I assume this is just his opinion, but idk who it was but a DBD YouTuber thinks the new insta heals are better? Which also makes zero sense to me considering they have a time limit to use and you have to lend afterwards. Can anyone explain that as well? Or at least their POV of that.
---
Killer Rank Icon
---
I'm a survivor main
---
Yup. Get good or be messed with, pretty simple
---
I already only use 1 perk and it is Ace in the Hole level 1, when my Ace (best character btw) hit prestige 3 I decided I would never level him up again, so I didn't, that was about a year and some change now, and he is the only survivor I play.
---
Pinned on r/pcgaming
---
Most Freddy's I face camp and tunnel due to BT not working against him, so generally an unfun match.
---
I dont mean to come over as a developer sucker I meant it more like that I dont think i¬¥d be the best to suggest changes because I dont know how easy it is to implant and such.
---
Because there shit
---
Seems like a blast to play casual games with you
---
at least in those 5 minutes the killer gets to actually do something that resembles playing a video game vs a freddy game which is 15+ minutes most of the time and ten of those are spent doing a gen. yea thats fun
---
I agree, that¬¥s a good idea.
---
This has happened to me every time I use these things. Just don't use them until they either fix it or remove them altogether.
---
You basically need to hook rush with We'll Make It just to get 2 heals a game if you're lucky and the killer isn't proxy camping.
---
Congrats!! Ghost Face will be my first lvl. 50 killer too. He's so fun to play as!
---
They're scared of a challenge. Idk why this happens but I've started trials before only to find one person, hit them, and their character immediately drops to the ground and they're gone. Its funny cuz I don't use many slow down perks, maybe an add on for slower progression while asleep and some dream pallets. My perks are bbq, discordance, tremors, and I switch between rancor, mind breaker and nurses calling as my 4th perk. I see no point in it, even when I survive and are being tunneled or just plain out not doing well, I'll take my hooking like a man. I've pipped up after dying before.
---
Not to mention the 20 minutes it takes to find killer matches
---
Every goddamn time. I don‚Äôt even bother burning anything that can help the other side anymore, it‚Äôs never worth it
---
oooooo u are the creator of the pig giggling meme. i loved that one too.
---
This is why I stick to killer challenges
---
Shoulda known. Thanks mate
---
I've gotten 2+ heals nearly every game without rushing and without using we'll make it. It's really not as hard as people are making it out to be
---
I feel like there are better perks. It only activates when a gen pops, and only shows you where the killer is for a few seconds. If you run a perk like Bond (or another survivor aura tracking perk), you can often tell where the killer is on the map by the behaviour of your teammates. Other options for aura perks would be Empathy or Aftercare (if you're routinely unhooking people).
---
If you just want to see the killer's aura, Alert does a good job of this throughout the match as well, unless the killer never kicks a gen or breaks a pallet.
---
that‚Äôs so kind of you thank you! &lt;3
---
please bless us with more content!
---
That‚Äôs definitely it! I couldn‚Äôt see any of the the trap stands either (hence why I tried to escape) so that must be why.
---
I may be in the minority, but I'd like to see a full-on rework for Trapper. He was probably the first Killer they made, and the game was very different back then. In light of the modern meta, speed gens get done, etc., the amount of setup &amp; collecting time for his traps puts him at a huge disadvantage. But, conversely, the complete randomness of trap escape makes them feel super unfair and un-fun from the Survivor end. I also think add-ons that allow traps to down Survivors are total bullshit‚Äîit makes Trapper the only Killer who can down Survivors with literally ZERO interaction.
---
I'd like to see Trapper able to carry more traps, and/or collect them without going halfway across the map‚Äîmaybe from lockers like Huntress?‚Äîbut then have traps tweaked to provide a more consistent hold time with maybe a skill check based escape instead of making it totally random. I think it would make sense to give traps some secondary effect to balance out Survivors getting out of them before the Trapper can get there from far away, though‚Äîmaybe a light Hindered effect until they heal, making them easier to catch and forcing them to actually bother healing after?
---
The hatch changes made it considerably easier for killers.  The old hatch was broken and a free win for survivors every game forcing hits in the dreaded hatch standoff.  Killers can just close that shit now and collect their 4K.  Much easier for killers with the new EGC Hatch.
---
And yet you replied again. 
---
‚ÄúI said good day!‚Äù
---
The two do however make a surprisingly cute couple.
---
Games like these are either toxic as fuck or they‚Äôre memers and it‚Äôs hilarious
---
As i explained the roadmap shows we are not getting a map rework until mid balance. We are not getting any maps/tiles before then.
---
1.  If you remove the great skill checks as a default, then incorporate them somehow as an add on maybe? One for medkit and toolbox each?
---
2.  Surveillance
---
3.  If your issue is they dont really add any kind of difficulty, this does not solve. Plus, I feel it would encourage tapping the gens at the end. So still no skill checks.
---
I like the General idea of maybe changing it somehow though. Even as a survivor main myself
---
This is reddit, don‚Äôt bother trying to correct the blendette‚Äôs. They don‚Äôt listen and they don‚Äôt learn
---
Also a short search away.
---
You did like 80% of one gen.
---
"Boring" is survivor code for "this actually presents a challenge, so I don't like it". 
---
Y'all just want every killer to be fully loopable with no ability to pressure gens at all. So transparent.
---
No worries
---
Hell, your parents paid thousands to raise the waste of space that is you. To each their own I guess?
---
The trap in the window shack is what prevents trapper from getting buffed lmao
---
I read that in Tall Man voice
---
no, you cannot use aby items in the dying state
---
Does anyone have the picture by itself
---
Add me: fearsome__rabbit
---
Meh, 4ks don‚Äôt really impress me personally. I‚Äôve seen plenty of bad killers get 4ks for various reasons, and many great killers who get 0-1 kills sometimes. 4ks aren‚Äôt a true measure of skill, especially given this game has some much randomness/luck involved. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more important to play for fun and be nice/respectful to others.
---
damn chill
---
I play survivor so I can be the real power role in the game. Playing killer is too stressful for what is  the "power role."
---
Acctually I did 3
---
Lmao another salty boy here
---
Lmao at the cornfield or yamaoka they literally just crouch in the grass right in front of you and disappear 
---
Shits wack
---
Already finished mine
---
&gt; Yep. Once I get you into the basement, you probs not getting out.
---
I wanna start a twitter that's just out of context /r/DbD quotes

survivor bad, killer good! i wouldve brought more lube if id have known we were going to be having a circlejerk
---
Ah good point, I‚Äôm on PS4 so that could be it
---
It was 40 minutes back when fog and darkness offerings stacked
---
Stressed lmao it‚Äôs a rush for me
---
It's a life style
---
Quite the contrary actually
---
Bruh what‚Äôs your fps
---
Your entire post was a sad attempt to try and make 4ks seem futile when that wasn't the point at all. Get out of your small tunnel vision and look at the grand point that was to JUST PLAY THE GAME YOUR WAY and don't talk shit about the way others play the game. That is all. I don't care about your opinion on 4ks because I am satisfied with my play style.
---
I love mayonnaise in the first person.
---
Survivors do gens for ten minutes as it is, dude
---
Wouldn‚Äôt the game go faster if you couldn‚Äôt find them?
---
 The thing is the devs try to nerf survivor things but suck really bad at it. Like they nerfed instas but inadvertently buffed the purple one and the tried to rework ds but made it even stronger. Theyre trying but you can tell they arent very knowledgeable about their own game. Itd be great if they had a panel of high level players that would at least advise the balance team. I know a lot of players like marth88 would do it for free just out of love for the game.
---
No because they were too scared to do anything
---

words are a valid reason to literally beat someone to near death? are you actually a fucking animal lmfao holy shit, civilize yourself my dude
---
So we‚Äôre talking rank 16
---
Theres a reason I said near death my man
---
I pretty much just assume if I join the lobby and its either 3 survivors and then we wait for a 4th its a 3 man SWF or it just starts with all 4 survivors its a 4 man SWF. Games I join the lobby and the survivors load in one at a time, then we actually have a normal solo queue match
---
Probably. That‚Äôs where I used to stay as killer. I don‚Äôt play it much unless I have challenges
---
Isnt this naming and shaming?
---
Ain't no shame in being a gen jockey. Someone's gotta power those gates.
---
Yeah that‚Äôd be cool maybe 2v8

Nah the Devs have swept him under the rug in favor of other killers. Pretty sad too
---
This is why I play to kill. 
---
IDGAF about what it takes to kill as many people as possible. 
---
I'm trying to get better, they're trying to get better. 
---
People need to grow up and accept that you won't always escape and learn how to accept defeat with anything other than vitriol and spite.
---
Fucking same. Usually if I get hooked first it's over. No one comes for me.
---
True. But it‚Äôs unlikely that you‚Äôll be able to complete the rift without finishing the archives in time.
---
&gt; "Why are we still here? Just to suffer?"
---
*The Entity likes this*
---
I had mori daily, but no moris on that killer, so I slapped on Rancor. First match had an OoO, I was so pleased. I just harassed them until the gens all popped.
---
I'd DC
---
The problem is that the hatch exists at all, I agree that it's better than what it was but a polished shit is still shit. It forces killers to slug if they want a 4k and survivors can still get two people out if they bring/find a key which is something out of the killer's control. It's a mechanic that punishes the killer for a mechanic they can't do much about.
---
These damn noob kids and their intention of not grinding with shitty teammates against sweaty killers for countless hours for some blood points to get fucking Iron Will or smth
---
Mate, not everyone is 24/7 on the game, not everyone plays killer and most importantly, not everyone is such a big brain that gets millions by playing a few hours
---
Also, what the fuck is up with this ‚ÄúI worked hard for it so now those kids need to work HARDER!Kids these days don‚Äôt know the value of hard work! When I was your age I used to ride my bike through the swamp against the PB spirit to get the points you get now, boy, you know nothing of grind!‚Äù? Like, I‚Äôm trying really hard not to reply Okay Boomer and be done with it
---
Its not the winning or losing, its the toxic survivors and the sheer hate you get for simply playing the game
---
I still will, because heck why not? I might be unlucky but there still certainly are some nice people out there
---
What‚Äôs the timing for flashlight saves? I went for one yesterday and got a killer blind award when he was already standing up but didn‚Äôt get a save
---
Seems easy enough if not a but to consuming.
---
What is this referencing please ? :)
---
I am. Idk if it still works but apparently there was/is a bug that allows survivors to complete that challenge. Idk the exact details or how it works but it‚Äôs interesting
---
Same. I just find killer kinda boring so mine never goes above like rank 9 lol.
---
A challenge is something that you can finish, playing against Freddy with ruin, dying light, thanaphobia, and that other add-on that makes things slow, it makes the game three times as long and it's no fun for any survivors. But what do I know, I'm an entitled survivor amirite? Killer good, survivor bad right? Dumbass
---
I'm sad for the fact that i can relate to that
---
What about who goes to the basement to rummage in the box, find the key and camping till the hatch spawning?
---
I find around 11-13 is where you get a good balance of potatoes and good players as killer. 
---
As survivor I try to get above 11 because that‚Äôs the level of stress I like in my games
---
Cleansing the infection with No Mither is just plain golden. I think that guy was running No Mither + Self Care + Second Wind + Inner Strength build as well
---
Ole ballista-arm Huntress strikes again!
---
because that's how survivors are a lot of the time.
---
I've been on the fence on buying it. Is it really that good?
---
Not even a little surprised.  If I can't be a toxic dipshit they are out.
---
Thank you ^^ the most tedious parts were hang painting the stripes on the shirt and making it look dirty, and the skirt itself. I‚Äôll redo the mask some day but it‚Äôll do for now
---
I would rather play solo than SWF. My friends are usually bad and we lose a lot so I naturally don‚Äôt take those games seriously but solo I know I can play closer to my level. 
---
Killer isn‚Äôt as stressful now that I‚Äôm playing actually strong killers or the ones I‚Äôm practiced with I can stomp with.
---
I get really bad frame drops when in the dream world but I usually don‚Äôt disconnect.
---
I'm not sure entirely. I've been sure I've been stunned while getting flashed but then nothin.
---
if they're new? it doesnt take ten minutes to do all the gens without extreme slowdown measures. and extreme slowdown is boring
---
I‚Äôve played tons of survivor and hit rank 1 a million times so now I barely play the game unless my friends want to play. Kinda sucks because rank reset puts me against like rank 14 killers and it‚Äôs too easy.
---
Thank you Otz, i learned how to 4K in 20 seconds from this very technique
---
Yeah, it's maybe the most satisfying killer, when u hear the snap and then the scream, feels great.
---
Cheers man, good job
---
Yesterday I had some wild shit. So wild I thought I was going bonkers. Rank seven, and I miss all my swings at survivors 360ing me at close range. I never had a game like this not before not after
---
#BEANS
---
Wow! A compliment means you want to sleep with me? Of course, what else would it mean?
---
The ankle break, damn. Jesus out here with the Emperor's Eye.
---
I have the same type of issues at red ranks. The other day I had multiple games where I was going into struggle hook before being saved. I think other solo survivors just all assume that someone else is dealing with it. ):
---
That's not stress, that is just agitation..
---
Honestly it was both
---
Otzcheats.com/SidewaysMirrorExtension.exe
---
There sure are a lot of these today.
---
"The downvotes storm is comming, sir!"
---
honestly we aren't sure becuse killer had both devour hope and ruin . none of them popped.
---
Yeah after they confirmed Philip and Sally being a thing..
---
OoO = Object of Obsession
---
STBFL = Save the Best for Last
---
I mean, I think flashlight and pallet saves are legit. And that's coming from a new player and attempted killer main. They're things you need to learn to counter as a killer.  The rest is great advice. 
---
Survivors mostly just need to realize that infinite looping a one perk Leatherface isn't an achievement. You should be able to do that with just about any build. 
---
And killers need to learn that you don't chase a survivor you can't catch.  After a few loops with no mistakes go after someone else and try to catch that survivor in a less advantageous part of the map later.
---
And being polite at the end of the game works wonders.
---
Well now I want a tabletop DBD game.
---
Remember when everyone's running animation made it look like they'd shit themselves? 
---
The good old days
---
BHVR account is the forum account right?
---
Ohhh my üôä
---
This physically pains me
---
Doing exactly the same my dude, even if i see someone running to the godloop/shack i will just leave them and go for the second person
---
Ah thanks.
---
You don't deserve to use Feng as your flair.
---
The game is better in some respects with the current dedicated server architecture than it was on the peer-to-peer one, and worse in others. Overall maybe kinda equal, not really an improvement. Which, back to the "why implement servers to begin with, then?" question, there is possible speculation as to BHVR only having implemented them because they wanted to port the game to Switch and mobile platforms, which supposedly required the dedicated server architecture to be in place. So what they dressed up as this big step for the game and "gift" to the community might've internally just been a cost-of-business prerequisite to being able to port the game to platforms that could yield a lot of sales.
---
Servers will punish people with worse connections more than their opponent, in general. It will affect their own movement and how they perceive the game world, without affecting that of their opponent on their side. That said, there's the caveat of hit registration and the killer's latency advantage in the current build, which does obviously increase the more latency there is in the network, no matter whether it's from their connection to the server or yours. So killers with laggy connections will still be rewarded for it with more ridiculous laghits, up to a certain extent.
---
They did say they regard servers as a construction site, that there will be gradual improvements and continual work, but, eh, they say that about everything. If we're being real, they've had more than a year to build a solid infrastructure and architecture for the server switch (and the "infrastructure" is basically just paying for a pre-existing amazon service), and they not only did not manage to meet their own deadline and still have a variety of issues with servers (they are still in a "test phase", after all), but improving hit registration is, again, one of if not the most important things people have been wanting servers for to begin with, so for it to be at best an afterthought is ridiculous enough in itself.
---
Flair checks out
---
I've never had much trouble with that build. If anything I find it a bit more refreshing when the gens aren't all done instantly and there's more of a chance for everyone to get chased a couple times. It's a nice break from Nurse/Spirit bullshit, but presents more of a challenge than other 115 m1 killers.
---
So the Setup I am using right now is:  
---
1. BBQ, because I love bloodpoints and it can help you track people.  
---
2. Ruin, because it slows down the game and I am mostly dependant on it.  
---
3. Distressing, for extra shocking Bloodpoints (this is not that important and changes from time to time).                 
---
4. Brutal Strength, because it helps you clear pallets that people drop prematurely all the time.
---
* Flooding - If you have a large volume of content to share, compile it into a single post.
---
Thank you.
---
I mean, it's not like anyone expected BHVR not to be completely welcoming to the idea of those characters in the game. The real news behind this answer is that it seems like there is currently no deal whatsoever in place or even just in sight for them. Pennywise de-confirmed.

---
k? just because noobs can do it doesnt mean it's impossible lol. but it's fine, keep underestimating survivors. when you hit red ranks youll see.
---
Rank 12 after joining late for rank reset on PC. So not THAT amazing as if I would have done it on Rank 1 or something like this. But I am still a little bit proud of myself to get this "Achievement".
---
5 mins? Boy u need to get good

Botany Knowledge, We'll Make It, Empathy, Dark Sense
---
You're a lamb for the slaughter but with healing hands. Keep everyone else alive and well and see if you can make it to the end :)
---
Honestly yeah. Almost nobody knew about looping pallets or how to fully utilize the infinites
---
I play killer too and run nothing but Ruin because I don't find extreme slowdown fun for either side. If I screw up my first few chases I'm not creating enough pressure and I absolutely deserve to lose the game. It's way more fun and rewarding to end chases quickly and force people to make saves instead of making them hold M1 on gens for much longer.
---
Huntress got sick of having a flashlight in her face, so she literally used an axe to shove your arm through your gut.
---
**That's metal as fuck.**
---
Increases speed while setting, decreases time to set.
---
The game has been out for 3 years. New players need to level up to practice otherwise they will have a bunch of shit unlocked that they dont know how to use. Its a game you can do it
---
but not even a cross post or anything
---
We made a tombstone mikey disconnect by simply running them gens like he didnt exist
---
Give her Elevens jumper from season 3.
---
If it started pissing me off, I'd start sandbagging him. Throw down pallets in front of him and stuff. Then you'll both be mad, but at least it'll be hilarious
---
ITS NOT MY FAULT OK, I JUST CANT STAND WAITING 15MINUTES FOR 1 MATCH. Dont put me out there on the spot like this. :c
---
I swear the entity loves playing his mixtape
---
It is that good. I will admit that it's often reported that you get double clicks from time to time with the g pro although it has never happened for me and I'm going on 6 months with mine.
---
Basically how I feel playing this God damn game
---
My bad.
---
Trap setting speed: the faster it is, the fast I'm setting traps
---
The mods here are poop.
---
Youtube upload?
---
O man can't wait for st dlc to be on sale (cause broke). I will have the fun of my life as THE HAIR
---
I only recommend against the saves because for an actual baby killer making them do a whole other chase once can pretty much end his game. Chances are if the killer's doing a bunch of risky pickups, one of your dick teammates will do it to him anyway. No need for you to pile on.
---
Thank god i wasnt around to experience the survivor machine gun
---
What can I say? They ALWAYS take ten minutes from my experience, with exceptions being so rare they basically don‚Äôt exists. Also, again, even at rank 10 killer I run into 10 minute gen completion.
---
Chill guys, everyone is allowed to spend his own money in the best way they consider. Idk about the guy here but if spending 400$ on skins over time, or even in one shot, if that satisfies him and his money management is okay...i don't think that's wrong. You might want to spend them in a better way, but that's personal.
---
On the contrary, if that makes him go broke..well, that's another thing.
---
What?  She cant go through the pallet its not the nurse,  she can phase around the pallet but all you have to do mess with scratch marks. She cant see you, she doesn‚Äôt know where you are.  Its like you blinded her.
---
This would work great for multi level maps like the Game or Lab where the hatch only ever spawns on the bottom for obvious reasons
---
He kinda is
---
Interesting!  So the survivor isn't related to Rin at all!
---
That's a pretty awesome idea.
---
Balanced
---
I don't think survivors themselves need nerfs rather the way generators at done needs Changes.
---
Game goes too fast so changing how generators are fixed could slow the game down.
---
Happy to have you with us soon!
---
Yeah I‚Äôll be rank 1 killer for a week and one squad will come along and make me yell at why I can‚Äôt hit them üòÇ
---
Tell him to try to run the killer to the already repaired generators (if there are safe loops/pallets), or to zones with infinite loops/jungle gyms, to easily make the killer drop chase or in the worst case make him waste a lot of time.
---
I took a 9 month break from the game, came back, and crouching survs still fall for the pretend-you-didn‚Äôt-see-them trick
---
Bitter murmur and dark sense
---
YES!! Exactly! All these old fanboys forget that we‚Äôve all gotten way better. Any half decent survivor nowadays would never go down in the old dbd, save for maybe going against old nurse. 3 blinks naturally was just so gross lol
---
What's BPS?
---
Dude.. you have STBFL
---
You can see the injured survivor at all times, even when being morried. The only time you cannot see them is when they are being carried to the hook or just carried around.
---
Sincerely, a hardcore empathy user
---
She's japanese but probably just a random girl not related at all to Yamaoka family.
---
If you‚Äôre crouching behind something it don‚Äôt matter
---
unlucky
---
Wow this some high quality stuff this feel like something I buy, great work
---
Lie where you are and see if they go there, then you know they are doing it on purpose
---
Ooo, maybe my whole plan is just bunk haha. It might be then that all 4 survivors join at once but the speed of their computers or connections make them appear to pop in staggered. I just find it fishy when its super obvious like, I join a lobby and it's 3 people with tool boxes and flashlights then some rando 4th with no items joins a few seconds later
---
Poor Claudette^4
---
Really thank you mate.
---
If it decreased the setting speed nobody would use it, why would u nerf yourself with an addon
---
they are just using [otzcheats.com](https://otzcheats.com)
---
The name reminded me of one of the protagonists of Fatal Frame.
---
I wish rank 15 had more killers like you
---
So another one of those feng min cases  where the character barely gets any good skins ? We will see
---
Wish they would give me the option as killer to not play toxic defense groups altogether.
---
Just wait till you see the limp wrist Myers shadow.
---
If I get disconnected from the host (PS4), who did DC? Me or the killer?

Can I reconnect if it was me?

Well, RIP.

OTZ DƒûBDƒûBSƒûDBƒûSBƒûDBƒûDB(means laughing in turkish text language)

I‚Äôm sorry but have you made any other killer or survivor because I love this
---
The hit registration seems like a must have. I can‚Äôt imagine they wouldn‚Äôt do it ones the servers are in a good state. It would piss to many people off :D
---
Hey can you put this as spoilers? Some people (including myself) wanted to be surprised :/
---
Also called the ‚ÄúWe ran out of ideas and are just reskinning shit‚Äù chapter.
---
oh god i play Myers but never noticed, is it normal
---
I'm assuming it's just the forum account but I have no experience on the other platforms, and BHVR has released no information other than a vague announcement about a breach.
---
At this point I don't expect to get off the hook. I just let the pain fill me with joy when I watch the idiots who refuse to unhook go down and get hooked themselves.
---
Best build for ghost face
---
I use immersion to sneak around rocks beside gen when killer patrols

---
Thank you thank You !
---
Then why not post it here so they can pin it?

Steve gang represent
---
Damn bro thats deep i feel that
---
Sounds about right. Also, ruin is needed due to the fact that I've seen it where 3 gens popped before the killer even HITS someone.

Yeah I guess desensitization from toxicity comes with play time. I know that most of the time the win/lose depends on a ton of factors other than my capabilities so I don't sweat it anymore if I lose because I probably did the best I could. If they are assholes then they'll continue to be assholes but not like I can change them, I just don't let it bother me.

oh this is interesting, i always thought they had their own campfire... but then again they do always watch the group on the main menu üò≠ü•∫üíî

---
I am so sorry mate but this one is my only dbd creation but if you like, you can check more images about the process of this figure here https://ibb.co/album/nGvMAa
---
Oh, yeah. I definitely understand why people pick ruin. It's just frustrating seeing every killer basically *HAVE* to use it.
---
Okay still great work
---
I think thana can be replaced with something even better, but yeah its solid

I misread it as Sanctum Of Wraith and got hyped for a Wraith tome.

Stupid bitch. This is why I disabled my messaging. If they have something to say they can invite me to a party. Keyboard warriors
---
Oh i've already done that. Told him i was in the barn on coldwind to then immediately see him change direction towards there
---
oof ouch owie
---
Yeah I agree, thana is good but it‚Äôs not a must have for the build
---
yea but "Charlie from don‚Äôt starve Power: beast of darkness When the game starts" being in one line really makes it hard to read
---
No.  They are trash. The whole point of survivors getting hooked is so that the killer can kill them obviously. And so the other survivors can save them.   What rank where they?
---
I'm curious if you're the type to dc when caught first or just dc in general when you're losing.
---
I made a post about this a while back, he would be a perfect addition to the ‚Äúcool‚Äù survivors
---
Just need to be on it when it‚Äôs finished
---
&gt;while connecting it gives me a fucking "An error occured", "NAT Error" or "Could not connect to host" error.
---
Exact same shit on XBOX. It's annoying as fuck!
---
just kobe bro damn wtf
---
&gt;cleansing the infection with no mither
---
I snortled
---
You need the perk to proc so just be there when the gen finishes. 
---
Ex: a teammate left the gen 99ed, you finish, you get credit.
---
The worst time is when im almost finished with a gen &amp; i see them barreling towards me
---
Still awesome it doesn‚Äôt feels  rushed
---
Seems like weird ass gatekeeping to me. If they don‚Äôt have experience, let em not have it, although I don‚Äôt agree at all that grinding for blood points gives you more experience, at least in my experience it didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve prestiged multiple survivors and killers and I‚Äôm still a potato
---
Less experienced players with more perks/whatever at their disposal gives them a) more time to try out the perks they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know how to use‚Äù in lower ranks and not get obliterated trying something new higher up. (How, in the name of god are survivors with experience better with a perk they just got by grinding than survivors that don‚Äôt have much experience and got that perk?) Also b) gives them more freedom to wiggle with the perks/addons/items at their disposal to get the build that works for them
---
Highest I‚Äôve gotten is rank 16, instantly went back to 17 though because I decided to try out plague for the first time. ‚ÄòTwas a mistake but I‚Äôm also kinda happy because high ranks scare me lol
---
It‚Äôs too easy to black pip at the least. They need to rework how points are distributed.
---
I often change thana for bbq (obvious reasons)
---
Problem is, the idiots are essentially causing most facecampers and tunnellers to play that way because all they do is swarm the hook, unhook the hooked person right in front of the killer, and then just abandon the unhooked person and doing nothing to protect them.
---
Then when you flip the coin, there's killers that will do anything to tunnel someone. Genuinely had a match a few hours ago where a huntress did all she could to tunnel me despite a David trying to block her way to protect me.
---
16ish but they had bloodied clothing so they might be low because of the rank reset
---
I had this happen the other day. Last 2 left. I‚Äôm working gens as they are in a chase and they kept bringing the killer to me. I kept thinking it‚Äôs a coincidence because they never ran right at me. Then I get 2 gens done, 1 to go and he comes back again, I hide in a corner of a wall and he runs right up to me and points. Killer downs me and I get hooked, he gives the guy hatch.
---
I've asked him that a few times but he always argues that the place I am is closer, even when it isn't.
---
Or maybe crack down on these shit memes.
---
I usually keep Spine Shill around to know if the killer is close an looking my way. It could give you a head start when they get within 36m with the killer.
---
No cutting corners seems a little high
---
Ypu realise these except maybe pop, would 100% work with it being passive or not, like nothing changes
---
That's how the killer rank icons always look.
---
Seriously. So many of them escape due to the Frame rate being shit and probably think they're good. They'd have a rude awakening if BHVR ever fixed it.
---
Wow thats low...
---
But then again that totem spot is filthy
---
What's STBFL
---
Play solo survivor with no mither and be both.
---
Guys for real! I never see anyone playing Quentin never...
---
i had a survivor try to block us in the basement so the killer could get us, he dc'd once we got past
---
couldn‚Äôt one of you‚Äôve done it? Why wait for someone else? You‚Äôre a mod you should be on top of this cmon guys
---
exactly
---
Well it's either that or survivors get easy wins.
---
Lmao he rage quit after getting DS'd
---
Why does it look like this is being run on a potato?
---
yep just be there when it finishes, 3 times. with a bit of luck, its pretty painless. u can use perks dark sense, bond, prove thyself
---
While I don't really condone the attitude. There is a point to be made there. The whole point of having those add ons and perks is to slow the game down BECAUSE it can go by so fast. As a killer, you're constantly racing against the clock. Running perks like those give the killer the much needed time to apply pressure. But I can agree, running ruin, dying light, thanat, and swing chains on freddy with his power already is a little overkill for me. But that doesn't excuse the dc. I don't blame survivors for bringing their best stuff to secure the escape. So, I'm not gonna blame the killer when they bring their best stuff either. Dcing because the match isn't going your way is really cowardice on both sides. There's no excuse for dcing besides your internet/power went out, an emergency or your game crashed. Just take the L and move on.
---
:3 pig is cute!
---
that was a great hit
---
Save the best for last perk
---
It was through the two killer glitch
---
I feel bad for baby demogorgon. Look at him, how could you not let him have the kill.
---
Toxic pricks
---
Sounds like people who think they are good. Just because they have the bloodied clothing. (Which honey let me tell you don't mean shit about skill.  Bloodied clothing is about time played.)  I'm sure they get hooked all the time. I have about 800-900 hours in to this game. And I get hooked all the time. So dose every one else I play with
---
Then he an idiot, just run empathy and when he's injured runnin the killer to u go away, u will see him at 128m, enough time for dissapearing.
---
wait they don't stack anymore?
---
Bond is the best healing perk
---
i had a thing yesterday where i chased one survivor for wayyyyy too long, the last one i needed to hook for bbq, and finally got them down when the other 3 had escaped in a hatch using a key, but since no one would be around to unhook them, i plopped them by the hatch to escape, despite that i was looking forward to finally hooking them after that loooooooong chase
---
Lol really? That‚Äôs the build I‚Äôm going for only I didn‚Äôt unlock nurses calling yet sadly
---
oh that perk
---
Meant she hate her father only lol
---
I had a wraith that pulled off a big brain moonwalk play on me last night, he downed someone and kicked the gen I was working on, he was walking towards them as if to go pick them up but he moonwalked right back to the gen and got a free hit.
---
Remember their names and never ever save them.
---
Equip: Dark Sense
---
Fix: 3 gens
---
Challenge complete
---
Just kidding. :)
---
The other 2 guys were dead on. You really only have to touch the gen to get it. I was on a gen for about 10 seconds, got chased off, then someone else finished it, and I still got credit for it. A lot easier than it seems!
---
Go for it, i am at red ranks and 4k consistently with it
---
yes and it is needed

Hoping she's a little older like Jane üòç.

yeah, it's when you patrol the area around a hooked camper, but aren't face camping. pretty good when you know all of the survivors are nearby waiting for a hook, but apparently that's toxic gameplay
---
Proxy chasing is when someone chases you while looking at the ground or while moonwalking to get the deep wound status affect to go off, or to get a stack of play with your food.
---
Proxy Camping is when a killer stays around the hooked survivor around a general area
---
LMAO i crossposted it and i got removed automatically

A+ mods

Showers for everyone but warm and filled with undigested food!
---
yeah. it‚Äôs when you stay around the hook but you aren‚Äôt camping. it‚Äôs like if you have a gen next to the hook at 99% and you want to make sure it regresses. It‚Äôs risky if the teams good but annoying if the survivors have tunnel vision.

i literally did it and it just auto mod deletes it..

He is not op he is just right yes some add ons are tough to go against however the fact that he dosent need ruin due to these add ons make ppl think he is op but when you really think about it the add ons in question are paint brush and swing chains an ultra rare and a rare I think either way a pink and purple so it's not every time. I play both sides and main freddy and have beaten numerous freddy's he dosent have a 1 shot and if you keep waking up he gets much weaker
---
How would overcharge and surge work with that lmao. Overcharge works after you kick the gens and surge works as if you kicked them
---
yes!!! new survivor !
---
Makes sense, they'd definitely rip each other apart.
---
I mean, if someone's kid ran up and barfed next to them, that's a good reason to DC.
---
RIP legion even more
---
We're gonna live forever, Shirtless David.
---
Cyka
---
Nice pun bud
---
RIP BALANCED LANDING
---
Be like Carl.
---
Meg: GG you piece of shit!
---
It‚Äôs because The Entity wants the killers to only go after the Survivors, if they all hung out they would eventually be fighting and that‚Äôs not what The Entity wants.

What? Why?
---
Butt dance in front of spirit is very brave
---
new rank reset is definitely what this game needed thank christ
---
they better fuckin not
---
True lol. There again, in a sense, for every killer there's 4 survivors haha...its annoying when anyone dcs and itd be great if everyone could just stop doing it if they don't need to lol
---
I honestly think it‚Äôs fair. No other exhaustion perk gave an added benefit
---
Exactly like the meme
---
i can't believe Sprint Burst will be better than BL
---
then rightfully so, Killers should slug everyone and let you bleed out bcuz ‚Äúget good or be messed with‚Äù, right?
---
that‚Äôs gotta be a joke, every time the killer swings within ten feet of a survivor the survivor‚Äôs frames drop to like 1 fps, not to mention the latency that gives killers lots of hits they shouldn‚Äôt have gotten anyway
---
No. She killed German invaders during WW1 though.
---
if this is true that‚Äôs dumb lol. balanced is situational at best and useless on some maps.
---
I DC‚Äôd at the end of a game against a demo with ranch or and I was the obsession while I running escape cake. Worth it.
---
It‚Äôs official. Sorry
---
what does Haunting reappearance duration mean for spirit?
---
I have both and it's a tough call. Personally I think the hag looks a little better.
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm just really detailed oriented, but I didn‚Äôt paint my arms here and the buckle is missing some pieces like a gold button and a leather pouch connected to it. The overalls are also missing buckles too, but I guess it doesn‚Äôt really matter with the overall look. I‚Äôve only done two cosplay so far and I slave myself over the smallest details but personally I think it‚Äôs worth it in the long run
---
Use STBFL on Nurse
---
A doomer who had a bad (ghostface)
---
That one weird kid you alway thought was weirdly hot (Mikey Myers)
---
I accidentally hit my rt the other day and it clicked at a pallet, I felt like such a poo
---
Edit: it was purple
---
It‚Äôs official. Also kindred is getting a buff
---
best legion add ons?
---
why
---
welp that perk sucks ass now, not only is dead hard broken but now we have nothing to help with stagger. guess sprint burst meta it is
---
Me
---
It doesn't matter, survivors will dc from anything they don't want to play against. You could be doing perkless no add-on wraith and they will still DC first down. And it's going to stay that way unless BHVR implements an actual punishment for it.
---
SMH, can't argue with people whose head hurts if the think just a little, if you can't figure it out, you're tight you win there is no way those perks can ever work and they would have yo be removed LoL
---
Yeah, that's a good point.  I've had someone pallet save after a chase once. It seemed like the best and quickest way to learn my lesson. Now if I notice a lot of coordination between survivors I'll down them and if they crawl to a pallet I'll try to slug their friend too.
---
RIP Balanced Landing finally. I'm a survivor main but some loops were infinites with Balanced Landing. 
---
Kindred just got even better now btw.
---
Oh okay so it still works if the perk procs. I thought stagger reduction was bring completely removed lol
---
Looks like a Borderlands postcard to me.
---
Bubba: Man Chili
---
whats the buff for kindred?
---
No, it‚Äôs only if you are exhausted
---
There‚Äôs no advantage pc players have over console players so I‚Äôm all for it
---
well duh. balanced is the most situational exhaustion perk. some maps don‚Äôt even have places u can activate it.
---
Agree, other good idea would be to guarante higher tiers o the personal perks in certain bloodweb levels e.g. levels 15, 20, 25. That way theyd be makin survivors less of "just skins" while also considerably reducing the grinding if u go for using a character with his personal perks.
---
You both have decent points here imo
---
Yeah... I was t3 Myers and got 360d 3 times in a row the other night. I just stopped and stood and stared into a corner. I deserved to not get anymore points after that. I was done.
---
Why the spoiler tag?
---
I really wish there was an inbetween :(
---
The only time I tolerate immersion is if the person is also humping their way through gens. But if your teammates are going through hook stages, you better be willing to jump into the fray before someone is DOH.
---
I hate so much those guys
---
Why worth it? What did that give you?
---
I have two questions: Are there any planned changes to  the perk Hope? And second of all, there‚Äôs an add on for the Legion that decreases the deep wound timer when it. This is similar to how the Legion was when they initially came out. However, the Legion cannot see the current state of the timer as it appears full to them at all times. Are there any planned changes to make this add on more viable?
---
Yea... gotta be able to take that stuff in stride. Bad survivors will yell at you for their mistakes.
---
If I see a bunch of scratch marks around the hook I‚Äôm not going to just walk away for the rescue. Sorry, use some stealth.
---
If there are two separate trails after the rescue and it turns out the one I picked is the person that just got off the hook, I‚Äôm not going to give up the chase for the sake of etiquette when they are right in front of me. Commit to the rescue and body block to save your buddy.
---
As for the hatch, I‚Äôll give it to a player that carried their team or for a clearly new player. I‚Äôll especially give it to a player who is immersed but powering through the fear. But it‚Äôs not guaranteed. Me closing the hatch gives you a 50/50 on the escape anyway.
---
I tend not to run noed, and I get the frustration around it, but if it is a problem then run that terrible totem hunting perk and make sure noed never activates. I can‚Äôt patrol dull totems.
---
Also if you are looping me well and decide to rub it in my face with teabagging, you‚Äôre going to get tunneled and then eventually face camped. Congrats you just won the game for your team but you get to sit in timeout.
---
A good laugh and some funny messages post-game
---
Not sure. Just removed it.
---
You still didn‚Äôt explain how they‚Äôd work when they‚Äôre made to work WHEN YOU KICK A GEN. What do you think they‚Äôd change to suddenly make them work if kicking isn‚Äôt in the game. Like explain if it‚Äôs so obvious, Igor.
---
braindead response
---
Thank you good sir
---
Disconnection penalties.
---
Also UNDETECTABLE INSIDIOUS!? Does this mean basement bubba is now immune to Kindred?
---
sure! my psn is mcdonaldswiki ,im rank 10 currently
---
Down with the sickness
---
Ok made me chuckle as an adam main
---
Good for you man
---
I'm not an expert at playing Huntress, but I did main her for awhile, and in my experience she has two HUGE weaknesses: Her humming provides Survivors an enormous warning radius, and her slow movement speed results in weak map pressure and easy looping for Survivors. Time is the biggest enemy of all Killers, and these weaknesses make it VERY easy to waste time with Huntress. So in my experience, the best perks for her are anything that can save you time or cost the Survivors time. I'll go over a few options below, **bolding** the ones I think are best on Huntress.
---
Slow down Survivors:
---
* ***Ruin*** slows down gen repair, but often won't last long unless you can defend it, which basically requires being territorial and giving up a lot of gens.
---
* ***Corrupt Intervention*** provides a short period of time at the beginning of the match where you have a much smaller area to patrol gens, which can help with map pressure.
---
* *Pop Goes the Weasel* can help any Killer, but the time you'll spend running around kicking gens can be costly‚Äîeven more so on a slow Killer like Huntress.
---
* *Dying Light* and *Huntress Lullaby* both have their value, but they're late game perks. They won't buy you time to find Survivors and get the snowball rolling in the beginning, which is when Huntress needs it the most.
---
* *Thanatophobia* is weak in general, and requires pairing with *Sloppy Butcher* (except on Plague), juggling Survivors, and keeping them all injured to get much out of it. With Huntress's limited map pressure, I think you'll have a hard time pulling off this play style with her.
---
Save you time:
---
* ***Whispers*** saves a ton of time on searching for Survivors. They'll often try to hide when they hear you coming, and with Huntress they'll hear you a mile away, giving them plenty of time. Knowing whether to bother searching or move on is invaluable.
---
* ***Discordance*** points you to multiple Survivors at once, which is great because it lets you both start a chase and keep them from popping that gen quickly.
---
* *Surveillance* is better than nothing, but keep in mind you'll need to slowly run around the map kicking gens to proc it, so it can be a bit of "two steps forward, one step back." Still better than no steps forward, but probably not the strongest option on Huntress.
---
* *BBQ* is valuable for every Killer, but high-mobility Killers can take better advantage of it. You'll get less out of it on Huntress than you would with some Killers, because there's a good chance the Survivors will have moved by the time you can get over to them.
---
Note that a lot of perks that are strong on other Killers are less useful on Huntress, mainly because she doesn't rely on melee:
---
* *Enduring*/*Spirit Fury*, because you'll usually be respecting pallets to whip a hatchet, not trying to swing through.
---
* *Surge*, *Save the Best for Last*, *Unrelenting*, any perk that provides the *Exposed* effect (MYC, DH, fucking NOED, etc.), or anything else that only applies to "basic attacks," because you'll rarely be using basic attacks.
---
* *I'm All Ears* can be a great chase perk, but while I haven't tried it on Huntress, I'm guessing it'll be a little less useful on her because any time a Survivor vaults, they should be getting hit by a hatchet anyway.
---
* *Monitor &amp; Abuse* seems to get mixed reviews. I've seen others saying it works for them, but personally I've never had good results with it on Huntress.
---
As for add-ons, Flower Babushka is the gold standard. I've had good luck pairing that with Hindered add-ons or Glowing Concoction. Exhaustion add-ons might be a good choice too, though personally I don't usually use them‚Äîranged attacks mean I care less about a Survivor sprinting away on Huntress than on any other Killer. (This assumes you're looking to play fair, of course; if you want to "win" by sheer force of DC's, you can't beat Iri Heads + Mil Belt.)
---
When it comes to maps, she's good on any map with clear sight lines. She can be okay on some indoor maps as well (I've actually had good luck with her on Lery's), because the straight hallways don't give Survivors a lot of opportunities to juke hatchets. I've had a surprising amount of trouble with her on Autohaven, though; there's too much low debris that creates non-mind-gameable loops that inexplicably still blocks hatchets.
---
Do you have any other apps open? Are you on ps4 or xbone.
---
Whats the buff? Please make it like steves perk where if the killer is facecamping it pauses the timer
---
Why did you laugh? You lost a lot of bloodpoints and everybody else earned the quitter bonus.
---
You know what else annoys me? When the killer leaves when you're on the End of Game report. Game gets frozen like a good minute. I wanna leave, man, not stare at my sad score for a minute
---
My favorite killer, would definitely buy this üëç
---
You can open the hatch in dying state
---
Source?
---
Thicccest Jane.
---
Every map has proc locations. Some maps have more than others.
---
Same with lockers for Head On or windows for Lithe.
---
Cuz I avoided a Mori, ur treating you‚Äôre treating this like a therapy session
---
wait it said the new survivor didn't have a voice over as a known issue?
---
Thanks guys! So what actually happened to the father afterwards
---
I‚Äôll be by your side until my last breath, Dead_Bear_King.
---
they eat blood, what if they get aids
---
Yes SCOOBY imagine the killers and the survivors cosmetics each survivor get a gang outfit Dwight shaggy I don‚Äôt know I love the idea of this killer
---
Flashlights are for communicating in Morse Code.
---
Fuck, I‚Äôm pumped for this new chapter! This will be the first new killer for me since since I started playing right after the ST chapter dropped, and based on the patch notes, Oni sounds cool as hell.
---
He‚Äôs so handsome when he‚Äôs looking for survivors
---
thats why we are discussing them like gentelman, no point in being mean or anything :)
---
Idk what to feel right now, just wanted to play with my angst teenagers killers without being nerfed for a second.
---
Yep. I find it ridiculous that Kindred doesn‚Äôt override Undetectable.
---
Usually don't have any other apps open and it's on xbox one. It usually happens whenever there is a status effect added as both killer and survivor. The frame rate as killer is also very bad sometimes, feels choppy. Cheers
---
well that's no fun... i loved the 5-Murky-Reagent-Freddy games
---
Those have downsides too, sprint burst makes you walk a lot, dead hard requires you to be injured to use it, head on it's more of a meme imo, it's fun to do it and thats all.
---
It‚Äôs out of curiosity, if I want to be brave I use David king perks and body block
---
Legion nerf? Why?
---
Otz is probably having a panic attack.
---
On a more serious note, I just have no fucking clue what is happening here. Are they just targeting the "very unfun" anti-heal builds, or are the 3 add-on buffs so incredibly strong (lol) that they had to butcher the rest of his kit? 
---
Because let¬¥s be honest, nobody gives a fuck about the fact that Legion will now vault pallets 0.2 seconds faster. That was never his problem.
---
Same with Brutal strength
---
BBQ + Distressing on a stealth killer = stonks 
---
If survivor get a friend and Gen rush
---
Ok, boomer
---
By all means yes. Link the consoles and consoles only, then link mobile and switch. Leave PC out of it, it's legit not a fair fight against any of the four.
---
yes but you can use those perks on every map, no matter the stipulations. with balanced, you just simply can‚Äôt use it if u get a bad map. it‚Äôs a dead perk.
---
I wish they would at least make sure all the exhaustion perks worked properly before deciding to talk about nerfs.
---
Diversion is OP
---
But there is no announced map in the roadmap
---
If he was leaning, that only takes 2 seconds‚Äîless with the right add-on. Furthest spawn location from the Killer doesn't necessarily mean absolute far opposite corners, just the furthest spawn point, and crossing a large chunk of a small map in around 13 seconds is feasible.
---
Would y‚Äôall ever consider adding naughty bear Into the game as a killer
---
Imagine playing a game just to make other people mad.
---
Bloody Party Streamers
---
They felt bad about the nerf to the Nurse, so now, you get a 3 minute headstart
---
The devs don‚Äôt read these threads. Posing questions to them won‚Äôt go anywhere.
---
are you suggesting one of the characters have aids
---
Why is the word soon trademarked?
---
yeah one time i died because of this stupidity
---
Ikr
---
I'd imagine it's an insta down.
---
Tough to say on the first one, if everybody DCs it's the killer, if it's just you that DCs it's you. But you won't know that unless ur playing with people.
---
No to the reconnect question
---
This is some head canon bullshit. How the fuck are Phillip and Sally a thing?
---
He's wrong with two things, a clown main would use the ability that blocks windows, i forget what it's called and also if you throw the bottle looping can't happen
---
Yeah, people in my region play like dicks
---
ooo k thanx
---
Not to mention when the aim assist fights you, you go for a hit when the survivor spins and it pulls you the other way
---
See my struggle is that I feel really bad when there‚Äôs only one person left, whether I killed the others or they escaped I always want to show mercy unless I don‚Äôt know where hatch is or they were rude throughout the match. It feels better for me if I spare at least one.
---
After watching literally like 30 seconds he just 360s with a controller which isn't impressive. Not to mention the killers were actually not doing that well.
---
What's the point of making a video to flex if you don't possess the skills to flex unless it's in rank 20?
---
I won't be bothering to use it anymore. The whole point of what makes the perk good is always having the stagger reduction.
---
He‚Äôs not op. He‚Äôs definitely strong, but good survivors still win
---
I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôll be something that needs to be charged up. The trailers focused a lot on blood so maybe the more times you collect blood from survivors by hitting them, you become more powerful  and enter Demon mode where you lash out and instantly down people, similar to Myers.
---
It doesn‚Äôt happen very often for me so it was nice to have a little refresher!
---
..what
---
Well... there's one more thing i wanna know. How do you "feel masculine or feminine"? Like... what's the definition of feeling masculine or feeling feminine?
---
Bamboozle. It also increases vault speed, which nobody talks about.
---
Some people think they are amazing after they pull off common techniques
---
Thats what I have been wondering
---
Lol I wasn‚Äôt joking. 360s never work on PS4. Usually only do when the killer isn‚Äôt as good. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm good because I got the 360 but I still feel good afterwards cos they usually never work because of how slow the character turns
---
her
---
I guess its the mom then
---
But giving the hatch creates a precedent that gives Survivors hope.
---
Oh no the solo rank 20 experience
---
As a solo survivor, Bond is life.  I've grown accustomed to it and now it's so hard to live without the information and map awareness it gives.
---
I get so confused as a Myers main. Every goddamn match there's at LEAST one person who teabags at a pallet while I stalk them. Do they not know? You have to know if you've got to green ranks, surely.
---
a big scary flower monster that loves to get on top of survivors
---
Laughing all the way to the blood bank!
---
They deserve it, thanks to Haddonfield.
---
devs main forever freddy confirmed. they dont know how to fix gens so they play that instead
---
Oh thank fucking god D/C penalties incoming.
---
Can't wait to see how fast people rack up the punishment timer given how D/Cing has been treated.
---
No more D/Cing to give your buddy the hatch, unless both of you are willing to wait 5+ minutes to get into another match.
---
Hmm maybe that‚Äôs the reason?
---
He should be called The Enforcement
---
I really like that idea
---
Why would the entity even need to eat?
---
The entity is a realm, a place, a dimension of an alternate reality, I doubt it would be a living thing.
---
Were not even sure what the entity even IS, but for the sake of it, lets say that the entity needs to eat.
---
If it eats, its alive, if its alive, it metabolizes, if it metabolizes, then it shits, if it shits, then it has an obtainability of nutrients and if it has an obtainability of nutrients, then it grows and develops, if it grows and develops, then it can die.
---
and if it can die, why listen to the entity?
---
If the entity can die, then it must have some form of a 'body' right?
---
Then theoretically, someone can kill the entity.
---
If the entity is alive, there must be others of the same species, so you can say the entity is not the only 'entity', and that there is more than one entity.
---
Does the entity reproduce? Can the entity have sex?
---
These are the questions I never thought I would ever ask, but here we are.
---
So a male killer, and a female survivor. hype
---
Me too, it's rare I escape a chase. I stick to gens, unhooks and a totem if I happen to see one.
---
my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
---
people haven't even seen the new killer and are already bitching
---
ghostface‚Äôs shadow is weird too lmao, hes not holding his knife in his hand and his head bobbles üò©
---
Where does it say that?
---
a weird faced person that uses his big saw to go fast and nom on people
---
But keep in mind anyone used to scrape off a Killer with Bond was probably working on a gen, so where before you had gen progress, now you have nothing, and healing doesn't usually take 8 seconds, considering that it's either Self-Care or find a second teammate, and the time for that can be added to by mangled or select perks.
---
I'm also pretty sure the hit CD isn't 20 seconds.
---
oh my fucking god i just played a game as him and looked, glorious
---
Ah a Legion nerf, just what I wanted. Glad BHVR finally decided to look at them, and in their infinite wisdom, make them *weaker*.
---
Also, nerfing Balanced Landing instead of fixing bad map design. Outstanding move. At least the Haddonfield infinite is dead, I guess.
---
At least the Kindred, Rank Reset, and Disconnect changes look good.
---
I think the selfcares are scarier
---
No offense but do you have autism? Any "normal" person would be able to see that everything he said during that game is a joke
---
I saw a guy doing this, he looked like otz but it was not him
---
Thank you so much I already got spoiled but hopefully next time you guys mark spoilers it won't be too late
---
So anyway, I started repairing-
---
Done
---
Problem is most crossposts are t shirt spammers/scammers so the bot has to remove 99% of crossposts to lower spam.
---
I think black pip is fine. But increase difficulty of pipping in purple ranks. Black pipping is fine you'll stay where you need to as you play. But its too easy to rank up which creates the poor distribution.
---
Bro I'm sure he was not Otzdarva
---
But survivors is ez
---
I miss being hyped for chapters. Now they always have to get every single detail before the initial announcements. It's not fun, what's the point of speculating and stuff when they just go and leak the whole thing.
---
What changes did I spoil for you? :D
---
Yeah, the issue is mods cant be omniscient at all times, so a post thats up for even 15 minutes and spoil people might not be noticed
---
Quick question: I've found several hex totems downstairs in the main building of Badham preschool, both the spawn in the corner (where the hatch likes to spawn) and the spawn in the corner of the bigger area - they emit a burning sound and the hex is cleansed when removing them, but i simply can't see them burn. Is it just my eyes, or is the burning animation missing down there? (Hex totems anywhere else are clearly visible as burning)
---
None im just saying pls be careful
---
bye
---
Poor Legion, I was just starting to have fun with him.
---
I am the trash man - when your teammate hides in a corner self healing he gets put on a hook instead of you
---
No u
---
Can you explain? 
---
Don't see how being special hits is a big change outside of Save the Best For Last synergy.
---
I think you can see why he‚Äôs low tier
---
It takes two perk slots for an effect weaker than Thrilling Tremors.
---
Be careful... about spoiling? Whe... I didn't? Solid advice my dude, thanks.
---
Wrong order
---
Did a Behavior dev have a bad match against him or something and decide to push Legion further down the trash can? I hope the leak is a meme since I'll be hurt if they really choose Legion of all killers to make worse
---
People always tell me that if I want to not be spoiled then don't view the subreddit when info come out
---
#how am I supposed to know when info gets leaked.
---
Even worse when youtube thumbnails ruin it as well
---
Ye nvm
---
How was I being an ass hole, seriously, please quote.
---
Lol it‚Äôs barely a nerf. It reduces the mend time slightly, stops him having free sloppy but her without an add on - two things that actually might make him ever so slightly tolerable to play against.
---
In return his frenzy becomes faster and more responsive. I mean it was impossible to miss with unless you were a complete potato but hopefully even the noobs on here who say its hard can still can survivors easier now
---
No shit, because then its not an opinion 3Head.
---
I'd be fine with that. But they didn't so it's a *huge* net nerf.
---
Holy shit, did the devs actually listen to killers? We don't have to totally fear Haddonfield as much now.
---
detective tap would know
---
Great that insta heals are balanced now, very cool
---
The extra speed doesn¬¥t matter. Legion never had issues catching up to survivors or vaulting pallets. 
---
Frenzy hits no longer being basic attacks completely guts perks like STBFL which were pretty good on him. 
---
Nobody cares about Blindness, and we didn¬¥t need Smiley Pin to give Mangled, we already had Sloppy Butcher for that. Now you can stab people around slightly faster, and they mend considerably faster so you will lose stacks of Thana etc. faster as well. So yea it is going to be so much fun moving a little bit faster when the survivors are going to just mend a lot quicker anyway.
---
This is for mccote. Not a question. You should play another round of killer against a good swf so you can see the obvious things that need addressed. Seems that the only thing that makes you see what needs changed is getting wrecked by a Korean swf.
---
My mistake, it was 3 am lmao
---
Now That‚Äôs a lot of damage!
---
Pretty sure they see each other in between trials in the fog but the entity separates them because most of them are mindless killers who would tear each other apart. Bad business for the entity
---
Well it does and didn't. I mean they've still put in heavily strong balanced landing loops in new maps like Hawkin's anyway. But that might be the reason, why they nerfed it now.   
---
We will see if it will stay in meta builds or not. I doubt it. On the other hand I already belonged to the people who ranBL and DH before BL got the buff, which they are reverting now. It's still usefull/interesting to choose between two exhaustion perks within a chase depending on the situation.
---
Wait so does that mean we can get a kimono outfit for this survivor???? :OOOOOO
---
Lol, killing legion even more. gg.
---
Legion's problem was never getting a first hit with Feral Frenzy. It's downing survivors *after* that. By making FF not count as a basic attack you limit Legion's build options even more, with very very very *very slight* buffs in other areas.
---
tbh you just gotta practice.
---
either get some friends and go in a KYF to get the timing and aim down.. or go into a game with randoms and only focus on flashlights ..
---
I suppose that you've reported them in the post-game chat. After that, you could try sending a ticket about it on their [Customer Support website](https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/sections/360000085466-Customer-Support)
---
DeviusQC said this: "[I like to imagine the Legion members together when outside a trial, they are a group and endure everything together.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/dy4ynv/ama_we_are_behaviour_interactive_the_devs_behind/f7z42r3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)"  
---
Which is very nice imo but I wish the other killers were allowed to cross paths. I need someone to beat Freddy up for me. :(
---
BBQ and Distressing
---
Blindness is fucking useless and I wish BHVR stopped shoving it into add-ons for every killer.
---
Smiley is basically going to be standard on Legion, but since the first hit in power is not affected by Killer Instincts, the first survivor you hit will be mended 3s faster than now. Fun.
---
The nerfs he got were far worse than the buffs they gave him.
---
Sloppy Butcher no longer applies to Frenzy Hits too. If you want people to heal slowly as Legion, you'll need to M1 or use an addon.
---
It's just a nerf to an already very underwhelming power with only &lt;1 second duration changes and finally making the button addons not counterintuitive as compensation.
---
No idea what stats they look at to see that Legion was OP and needed nerfs.
---
Even with a Forever-build he isn't a hard killer to go against. Not even the most annoying considering that GF, Spirit, and Freddy exist.
---
During the Endgame Collapse no less!
---
I think you meant to say balanced. No pun intended. Killers don't have to fear Haddonfield as much now.
---
This is an amazingly worded question to show respect for someone you want a legit answer from.
---

It‚Äôs cool to just stay out of sight every time a killer comes to the gen and they see that it‚Äôs being worked on every time they come but they can never find you. Sometimes they will spend ages looking for you, just as long as you get right on that gen as soon as they leave you are technically distracting the killer. That‚Äôs why I wear bright clothing most of the time. I should remain hidden because I‚Äôm staying out of sight, not because I‚Äôm camouflaged.
---
That's not the point.
---
May be tough to see due to the lighting in the Badham basement being warmer than the normal outdoor lighting. I don't believe there are any known bugs with those basement totems
---
Well rip my build with him with save the best for last üò©
---
I agree. Have the add on override any "extra hatchet" addons
---
wait, but it said we weren't going to get a new map with this chapter?
---
hell yeah
---
I've asked this a few times but never figured out the answer.
---
When channeling projection with Freddy, is there any way to know what direction youll be  looking after the channel?
---
I tried a bunch to get outplays when someone is being chased towards a gen, but I always end up disoriented and unable to execute it.
---
lol
---
How is the basic attack thing bad? This is better for stbfl!
---
No you‚Äôll get Dady Myers Feet
---
TBH, im glad too. I play both sides and understand the need for the change
---
Pizza time!
---
I think it looks party cool,  bug here's an upvote
---
I‚Äôm not gonna lie I did mine doing all 3 100% and it was painful, wish I knew this sooner XD
---
I like how I heard about the AMA from Boxghost's stream before I heard a word of it here. 
---
Hey mods, I get that memes are fun but this is the sort of thing we need heads up on and stickies for.
---
There aren‚Äôt too many good perks that help with chases. I can only name a few. 
---
Spirit Fury, Bamboozle, and Brutal Strength. Rest are Garbo.
---
in game its normal but when trying to record anything it drops to potato

---
Lol what rank? That trapper needs to learn when to m1
---
His Aura is still shown by Kindred during the activation period of Insidious. So unless the Kindred user is literally not paying attention Kindred still helps against Insidious.
---
Tall bitch with The Exorcist puke
---
oof. I got spoiled for a game with no real story.
---
and then no mither (too strong imo)
---
The thing is the first person to crosspost it got it removed by the bot since 99% of crossposts are from spammers. Until someone pointed out the AMA we cant sticky the threads of other subs
---
Damn I read this after mine haha nice
---
Not bad. It's kind of weird since plaid flannel is a common addon to help beginner nurses now, so it would be useless to proficient huntresses. But she could really benefit from an addon like this, and the current iri head downside is a joke so I get why you say this.
---
I'd introduce this as a common or yellow addon and just do what other people in the thread are saying and make the belt addons not work with iri head.
---
You should remember that you have a small terror radius, so with Monitor &amp; Abuse + Nurses Calling you will get really close to survivors for hits and downs. I play it both with ruin + BBQ for a good farmingtime.
---
The template doesn‚Äôt make sense here
---
Unnecessary
---
It's completely fair. I'll gatekeep this easily:
---
If you started in mobile or console, you don't understand how bad the progression system used to be.
---
No archives, no shrine, no party streamers, no escape cakes or pudding, no WGLF or BBQ. In addition to that, giant bloodwebs where basically every available spot had something to buy, 1 perk per bloodwebs even at level 50, and many scoring things have received buffs since then.
---
More like 10 minutes in the waiting queue
---
Whoa whoa whoa legion got nerfed again? better question. Why the fuck did they nerf balanced landing?
---
no i self care not u care
---
He numerical 4's them?
---
Insidious yes, not so much of an issue. But I was thinking more of Stealth Killers. Wraith and Ghostface can be a bit campy as it is, in my experience, and now they don‚Äôt get their aura revealed by Kindred on the off chance a Survivor decided to use one of the most useful solo Survivor perks.
---
Every time I kill my self on the hook in effort to help my alive teammate find the hatch I always hear Danny devito cheering me on, telling me ‚Äúsuicide is bad ass‚Äù
---
I will take this gold kind stranger and give it to the lord danny  devito himself at once.
---
Bing bong ding dong
---
Rin: What is my purpose?
---
The Entity: To make survivors DC.
---
Rin: Oh god
---
Why not lol
---
But... they might have been trying to wait out the BBQ timer so that the killer wouldn‚Äôt know which one is coming towards you
---
If I had better chase perks I would use them but until then Ruin ain't going nowhere.
---
yeah punch him irl on the shoulder really hard. its kind of weird when you do this in pubs with strangers though
---
A Bioshock DLC would be such a good addition to the game, although i'd suggest they put Big Daddy instead of a Splicer. Damn why haven't I thought of this?? they should add this !
---
Oh Otz
---
Called it earlier, but I'm not surprised. Very little in the way of substantial information, mostly just fluff answers, answers to nonsensical questions, and answering "We love you BHVR" posts.
---
There were some gems inside that thread but for the most part it was basically a text version of a normal Q&amp;A session with them.
---
Hell, the leaked patch notes that just came out had more substance to them than that entire Q&amp;A
---
I run Sloppy and Bloodhound on Legion. I haven't found a straight answer on whether Sloppy will continue to apply - I've seen conflicting information in other threads - but this newb-friend combo has allowed me to track down folks I otherwise would have lost entirely.
---
This is going to hurt, very likely. Probably end up going back to Myers and Hag, which feel like a lot less work for a lot more reward.
---
It was low ranks but exactly I don't recall.
---
Not going to change much, the only really useful change is giving broken and even then, your pretty much broken agasint legion anyway. Not going to do much if anything differently.
---
I'm surprised Pennywise hasn't made it in yet considering how liberal Steven King is with giving away his IPs.
---
You mean playing the game normally? Just play however you want.
---
Bad? The way I see them they seem... pretty pointless..
---
Pc has the only good players. It's obvious. I played console and got pepegas.
---
They were crouching in the same position as when I was downed and the killer carried me for another 5ish seconds. None of them were on gens, just crouched down.
---
10 seconds crouched in a corner with no terror radius is just a game not worth playing.
---
Strong arguments for the butt dance coalition.
---
what leaked changes. link please?
---
Would be good if not for mending nerfs.
---
You only have the better setup, but you lack brain cells
---
Link to the changes?
---
Don‚Äôt forget half of the legion, Susie and Joey both got peer pressured IIRC
---
Yea the problem is, they littrely didn't do anything thats even close to remoetly helpful. Instead of making those kinda pointless status effects on add-ons, make it be baselin. Having the abilty to base line broken someone for 60 seconds would be strong.
---
I was reading it to get some info on upcumming changes but found nothing i wouldnt know about.
---
But a funny meme is a good outcome nonetheless
---
I'm in this photo and I don't like it.
---
This bit will go away once/if we get (the dreaded) dedicated servers
---
The one that gets me is getting lag spiked right as I swing. I consistently drop 15 frames or so when bloodlust 1 activates and I can't tell you how many survivors have gotten away because it cucks me out of hitting them.
---
Nerfs his slowdown which makes him less frustrating for survivors, but makes him faster and more responsive during frenzy for killers.
---
It‚Äôs a good all around change
---
Whenever I‚Äôm having a bad day I just swap to Doctor and watch as people DC at the first scream.
---
Leaked changes from Leakbydaylight's twitter
---
https://twitter.com/leakbydaylight/status/1196505966524715008
---
What did their comment say?
---
The other side is he was unfun to play against if the killer was good.
---
There was 0 chance to legitimately lose the killer, aside from failing a skillcheck within terror radius which was more often than not a free sleep again as his power was ranged.
---
So the killer would tunnel one person the whole match who was frusturated that it was impossible to shake the killer, then finally gens are done, the survivor gets hooked, and gets unhooked for free because of sleep delay, frusturating the killer without even being satisfying for survivors.
---
He was poorly designed.
---
I know, the joke is that balanced landing has changed.
---
I love balanced Landing but It‚Äôs a lot easier to change a perk than change the maps.  Balanced landing creates infinite‚Äôs that are almost uncounterable on certain maps.  But now it‚Äôs very weak and almost unusable it feels considering how it‚Äôs only viable in certain places.
---
What do you mean ? Oh... The scariest thing in the game part ok...
---
What system was this on?
---
It's funny playing at low ranks and I just start stalking before the pallet, they throw it down, then stand there doing nothing for like 4+ seconds occasionally. I sometimes feel bad stalking the noob then popping tier 3 on the good survivors.
---
Stupid , nerfing a bad Killer makes no sense what so ever
---
Lol
---
To be fair most of those weren‚Äôt as good as BL.
---
Xbox One
---
Not only that, but they don't even necessarily need to have the perk to get value out of it. Having an obsession vs not makes leagues of difference for the killer, simply because they have to respect the threat of DS. Survivors have to play so much more conservative and take more hits for each other because there's nothing stopping the killer from tunneling except their pride. People call it the strongest perk in the game for a reason.
---
?
---
For those who don't get it, they're making protection hits waaaaay easier to get.
---
I play like 60% killer, yes it's a choice, but again I'd you are chasing for ~minute you made your choice. If I'm not getting that down within that time you're supposed to rotate back as even without unbreakable they're ready to be popped by a survivor.
---
I also run it as a survivor regularly and the only time I usually even get to pop it is when they're running a slugging build which is boring to play against (2+survs on the ground), or killers trying to game the hatch.
---
Fucking solid stuff mate, hats off to yaüëåüëåüëå
---
You really have no chance against a solid Billy though. That‚Äôs the only difference. Shits scary either way
---
2 months, but if people keep posting this "can I get banned?", then it will be a year or permanent
---
Rarely does someone get banned unless it‚Äôs for cheating. He should be good unless he‚Äôs DCing cuz this upcoming patch is gonna crack down on that
---
My son is being left alone
---
I‚Äôm surprised that they still nerfed one of the worst Killers
---
Hes by far not the worst killer in the game but the nerf was still very unnecessary
---
The name is a place holder
---
This bug isn‚Äôt limited to totems, it seems the interaction hit boxes can be off for totems pallets windows and unhooks, basically anything with a hit box
---
Great start!
---
Alright good.
---
He doesn‚Äôt purposely DC either.
---
Alright.
---
Lets hope he doesn‚Äôt get banned then.
---
2v4, 8 perks from the normal 4, would be completely unbalanced. Not to mention if they add a kill with friends fort the additional killer
---
Head On is now the most OP exhaustion perk /s
---
I will gladly play! PSN is TheRose03, same pfp as my Reddit. I‚Äôm also trash so don‚Äôt worry lol, rank  17 or 16 I believe
---
hold up is BL getting nerfed?
---
Yep. Remember when slow/medium vaulting/window block didn‚Äôt exist? Pepperidge farms remembers
---
Wait a 2v8 mode is coming!
---
No stagger reduction while exhausted, added no sound while falling while not exhausted
---
It's just a revert of the Vault Nerfs, small buffs and a Nerf to various sketchbook add ons, and a slight buff to pins, which makes them usable. 
---
Oh, and a speed buff. 
---
What the fuck is everyone's problem? Y'all just expecting a full rework, or did you want them to Nerf them? Lmao
---
The attack thing was just wrong, and out of line with the rest of the killers.
---
Someone buy that poor guy a new mouse. Lol
---
eeeey now i can vault even faster with bamboozle and fireup in frenzy
---
More like anal agony tbh
---
I played the game when it first released and then stopped playing for ages. I only started playing the game again in late September and I've been enjoying it and im trying to platinum the game, however the adept killer trophies are impossible to unlock.
---
You should be able to unlock them killing all 4 survivors with only the required perks equipped, why was it changed and made that you need to get a merciless victory?
---
Could this be changed please so it's easier to unlock them as I know i'm not the only one who has experienced issues with these trophies/achievements.
---
Thanks
---
I have no idea why but you have to do way better as killer than survivor to pip up. You can get two kills as killer and black pip but all it takes to pip up as survivor is get a save or two and not go down instantly in chases.
---
awwwwwwww well guess im running dead hard again
---
It is coming for 1 year now - any source my trustworthy reddit friend?
---
I doubt anyone would classify pennywise as a horror legend above like....pinhead or chucky or like.....anyone else
---
^ this
---
And even then it doesn‚Äôt even work right 50% of the time
---
I do the same thing but I figure it's being kinder to babies. The good survivors have a chance to get away but if I pop T3 on babies then it's GG. Unless they teabag, then they die.
---
latency causes the hitbox to remain where the survivor once was from the killer‚Äôs POV, I feel like Freddy is the only really bad one where the animations just don‚Äôt match
---
Ok and how did you defer from anything I said that I had a habit of slugging survivors as a primary habit?
---
Your telling me this scenario has never happened to you?
---
You‚Äôve never played a close game, slugged someone and then had them get away with adrenaline or unbreakable?
---
Fuck off dude I made a singular comment in agreement and your trying to nit pick and argue semantics.
---
Are you bored making a ham sandwich or something in your kitchen?

---
You are the lucky one
---
Me too
---
They were arguing DC penalties will result in people simply killing themselves on first hook instead. It's a fair point that the aspect of survivors "Giving up" and turning it into as 3v1 will still happen, but the killer isn't cheated out of BBQ stacks and the survivors still get some time for the killer to drag the survivor to the hook instead of the survivor faceplanting and I can get right back to looking for other survivors.
---
They also claimed queue times will be longer implying some players might quit playing DBD altogether since they can't DC or will continue to DC and simply eat the punishment, resulting in less players in matchmaking since some people are waiting out bans. 
---
While that may happen, I think survivors who quit because the "Straw that broke the camel's back" is not being able to DC anymore are better off leaving the playerbase. As much as I love making people ragequit as Doc, longer queue times in exchange for not having survivors who DC on first down seems worth it to me.
---
what? you weren‚Äôt even the person I was talking to lol what do you mean you weren‚Äôt joking? also if 360s don‚Äôt work for you on PS4 it rly does just take a bit of practice and crank your sensitivity up to the max

---
Demodoggo best doggo
---
So toxic. I member
---
Survivor is easy, you just have to remember you're solo and play accordingly
---
Honestly wouldn‚Äôt mind.
---
Increased frenzy movement speed + vaulting things quicker = ez vault blocking legion build time
---
Mmm. As i said it only sounded good on paper. Of course alot of balancing would take place.
---
The other thing is, and not to give specific spoilers, some of the Rift text logs indicate the writer interacted with the Doctor outside of a trial, so clearly out-of-trial interactions are plausible even just according to currently released content.
---
Playing solo queue tilts me way more than a bad game of killer.
---
I really don‚Äôt understand why they would even touch legion if the rework is coming to change things anyways.
---
I'm glad i've stopped maining Legion started maining Demo, they took the worst killer, and fucking buried him in the center of the earth.
---
It is like they don¬¥t even play their own game. "Hey, let¬¥s buff Legion where he literally needs it THE LEAST, let¬¥s ignore his actual problems, and let¬¥s nerf his best builds because why the hell not lol"
---
Same reason I run empathy all the time. Unless the killer has an instant down, I always know exactly where the killer is chasing someone. As a bonus, it makes building up benevolence very easy.
---
100% of every time I have tried to drop off the killer it never works. 100% of the time ppl try to drop killer off on me works. 
---
When I‚Äôm playing killer and somebody obviously tried that it‚Äôs tunnel city time. All others are free to do whatever they want (except unhook the sandbagger) until that person is dead. Lookin at you Meg.

You still lose collision in fatigue no?

So the part of me that is a survivor main is absolutely disgusted and terrified, the part of me that plays killer is squealing in joy at the absolute carnage you inflicted!
---
The red offerings that allow you to play a dlc killer for the next trial.
---
They aren't supposed to spawn when you own the dlc.
---
It makes me sad when people don‚Äôt know what Gravity Falls is.
---
Using the shadow dance and serpent add on(serpent being whatever the gray one is that takes you out of cloak) and combining that with bamboozle is a good build to end chases faster and at least get rid of a lot of pallets.
---
Well, Legion is officially fucking dogshit. The mend timer and added duration were the only things keeping them event slightly viable.
---
And yet I‚Äôm here with so many splinters it‚Äôs insane :c
---
Mine was Claudette, followed by Meg and Trapper.
---
Please look behind you when you run
---
Legi√≥n must be wearing a pig mask or something cuz, he got unnecesarly nerfed harder than miss piggy
---
Watched the video so I understand where this is from gang wya
---
Not really, as a killer main it‚Äôs pretty obvious most of the time, especially when it‚Äôs used mid chase by another survivor...
---
Wait this is the opposite for me. I love goofing off as killer but survivor got me stressin
---
The correct term is taco-bumping
---
Yeah but Mathieu Cote said that the roadmap could suffer some changes and fortunately it did.
---
She has to guess, you dont if shes at a pallet she can 1 of 2 things stand there like an idiot not hitting you or phase.   Walk away she cannot find you. If your hurt she might get close but it is still better the being blinked on.
---
...Yikes.
---
I know it's not always advised to post a video linking to my channel but I was proud of how I played this game wanted to share it. Enjoy.
---
Lol downvote all you want. Yes the game is buggy but their are bug fixes every few weeks. That stuff doesn't just fall out of the sky
---
Watch King's newest video, is has all of the leaks.
---
I feel the same, but hey THEY PLAY ONE MATCH PER DAY
---
Thanks dude

DH and lithe are inconsistent and just annoying to deal with if they dont fit your playstyle, Head on isnt really an exhaust perk, and SB, even though its the best exhaust perk, it has such a high skill cap im not sure i wanna put in the time for it.
---
Overall i dont think the changes are that bad, but i do think it was kinda unneeded.
---
*Sad oink*
---
It's usually fine but there are a lot of lagswitchers on console.

It seems you play on ps4. I can add one more bodyguard, if need be. EaterOfTacos123 is my username.

***SCOOP TROOP HOO RA!***
---
I 100% agree. Nothing like playing a low to mid tier killer and seeing Michael's map. Sorry but WE all knew that loop was busted with BL in the meta. It's human nature to take advantage of a system. They should have fixed it long ago.

Dickhead was hardware banned, then even went to try and kiss ass to mcote while he was streaming and mcote told him to go thru the proper channels to discuss his ban.

Oshito went and bought a new PC just so he could get back on and continue his bs. His gamertag will be discovered again and they will hardware ban him again. Maybe when oshito realizes he‚Äôs $10k + in the hole for PC‚Äôs he will go away.

Thank you, someone finally said it. I applaud you sir.
---
Did you really expect anything different? This wasn¬¥t really an AMA about the state of the game or something similar, they did it on r/pcgaming on purpose. The main purpose was to actually give the game more exposure and talk about general stuff that might be interesting for people who don¬¥t even play the game much.
---
So sloppy and Thana don‚Äôt kick in, until after the mend or they won‚Äôt at all????
---
Yup. I recently went against a Doctor that got a 4k because of lag switching. It really pissed me off
---
Otz Is a god,you can't say not
---
Why need to waste 16 seconds each time when you can just use a medkit or just suck it up and do gens
---
What‚Äôs up with balanced landing?
---
Had a game with my friend today where we played SWF, he forgot he had the sacrifice challenge active and he managed to get 2 sacrifices added to the progress either way
---
Any rank***
---
I play Killer until I have one really good game, and then I stop and play Survivor for a while.
---
Honestly
---
Noed and bloodwarden really
---
Franklin's Demise. Unless all survivors switch items last second you will always know when to run it.
---
Thats kinda the point,  as it is the only keys that get use are dull and skeleton. And thats exclusively for opening hatches as a swf. 
---
The rework is to make keys useful. 
---
As it stands now, keys addons either add time or let you see nearby survivors. Or for an expensive very rare see the killer for a few seconds.  
---
Not terribly interesting. 
---
At high ranks all you see super fast heal medkits or a toolbox. Maybe a flashlight if the survivors intends to loop.
---
So then your point is?

How's legion getting nerfed? I'm a legion main

When nobody talks about the Pig buffs so they can keep complaining

The term: Ducking/Avoiding something like the plague. Is referring to avoiding something like it has the bubonic plague. NOT the fucking plague from DBD man lol
---
yep and i don't know why it records it potato mode
---
Tickets are pointless, last time someone sent one in they told them to look at the upcoming patch notes since they were adding it in chapter 14 for everyone

Why no shirtless Myers or huntress

How do I ween myself off of Spine Chill? üò•üò•

They won't give it back until the new chapter where they'll give it to everyone. So you'll just have to wait unfortunately.

you didn't interpret my comment correctly. I said people leaking all the info before it comes out ruins the speculation and hype. I completely lose all interest in the hype because of people like you.
---
Just hit level -49, about to reverse prestige Claudette. These killers are OP though, can't get out of rank 22.
---
This one quote sums up the entire situation:
---
‚ÄúStop! He‚Äôs already dead!‚Äù
---
For real, though, they should either prioritize Legion or just fucking remove him from the game already.
---
If you dont expect anything, you wont be dissapointed.
---
I like light mode :(
---
Not competitively. They should just rush it and label it as a non competitive joke mode. Get the win rate to 50% by adding removing gens and have the mode full of bugs
---
It's literally everywhere and that's the problem.
---
I like to try out weird combos that you don‚Äôt normally see.
---
My favorite right now is Stridor Nurse with Spoon and Undetectable. You can hear people injured by a blink from fucking SO far away, and you can use the stealth to sneak up on them and finish up. It is IMPOSSIBLE to lose them, because the Spoon+Stridor makes them insanely loud. Super fun and nobody expects it.
---
Shit, Head On sounds more promising now I guess that'll be the new substitute.
---
Goes to show you that killer trailers are nothing like that gameplay. As a legion main this is a fucking nerf and a unwarranted one as he was not a overperforming killer.

He moves faster in frenzy, he vaults windows 0.2s faster, he vaults pallets 0.4s faster, 3 addons were buffed, but now mending is faster, 1 addon was nerfed and his frenzy hit no longer counts as a normal attack (for STBFL for exemple).
---
Thano will but sloppy won't
---
survivors grab some cheese and sausage for when theyre back at the campfire for sustenance and fancy parties
---
As a trapper main with 5k hours playing at rank 1 without using ruin entirely.... and playing a 3 gen strat...
---
I know about unbreakable....shit has cost me games before but eh doesnt work out well enough for them to really hurt my win/loss so potato potato.
---
It's funny that sportsmanship, per your definition, is only based on making the game easier for one side.
---
Your bias is showing.
---
Fair enough. I'm just sad as someone who used it on all maps, i totally get haddonfield w BL was broken
---
‚ÄúGg ez‚Äù Right?
---
Dying Light, Nurses, Ruin, Save the Best. Why use sloppy when you can slow down healing and gens more efficiently?
---
After this nerf one of those perks is gone. Enjoy even longer post healing.
---
I don't get it. If people have to hunt you down with Empathy to do this, that already puts you in ahead of them in the chase. Why not just stay in front of the dwight and start running from the killer, then sandbag dwight at the first pallet you reach?
---
Shhhhh.. Don't upset the survivors. They'll call you toxic.
---
It's in the patchnotes for the next chapter
---
I don‚Äôt care about STBFL but if Sloppy Butcher doesn‚Äôt apply I‚Äôm done with Legion lol.
---
What kind of concerns?  They are fixing rank reset, Disconnects, they just added Archives and Tomes as rewards.  They can‚Äôt fix everything at once
---
You can still be hyped about something you know is coming. The leakers just give details you'll know what power you'll get to play with soon and get hyped for it and so on.
---
If left up to bhvr its just oh a chapters coming and a cgi trailer...yay...
---
Title basically but can anyone check in game if it‚Äôs fixed currently stuck at work or I‚Äôd do it myself
---
Yea 60 seconds Is a lonnnngggg time.... DS basically means its impossible to kill a survivor in less than 3 minutes. (Gens if done optimally by 3 people and only occasionally 4 take 3:45 seconds)... just to put that into retro spec and people still think killer is stronger.
---
Mhm i joked to my friend about joining head on gang now lol..the perk is fun when it works but frustrating when the killer doesnt get stunned even though they should have
---
Wait a minute, is that really a thing?
---
And here i am taking the hard way, playing killer with only a few weeks of experience
---
Ah thanks
---
Is a blessing for other people
---
Wait legion is getting a buff?
---
Just as a general comment. I understand wanting new useful teachable's but as soon as they make it too strong people will complain that it's pay to win so BHVR can't win in that regard.
---
I think he's talking about before the killer even finds the survivors though
---
I mean, I think it's pretty clear the Sally Phil stuff wasn't serious. People just go too far with stuff when they think it's cute.
---
Even if Wraith has his marbles, Sally definitely doesn't. She's broken and insane. If they were an item she would lack the capacity for consent. And I'm not sure she has a real body. Phil wouldn't try to date a mental floating corpse.
---
Why did you nerf legion again?
---
You clearly don't get what I'm saying, I'm saying I want to speculate what the power will be and what will be added to the update but I can't do that when people shove the leaks down everyone's throats.
---
I love that idea, they just plan ahead on who‚Äôs gonna keep the killer busy while the rest just steal a fuckton of cheese for fondue
---
Okay bud, keep being disappointed and crying about it then.
---
Sounded like you mean THE plague as in the killer.  Can you specify some examples?
---
Balanced Landing was absolutely broken for the second floor of coal tower and most houses in Haddonfield. I'm not happy about the changes because it's my favorite exhaustion perk, but after playing an M1 killer on Haddonfield, I understand why they nerfed it.
---
I'd buy a set of killers to paint IN A HEARTBEAT!! Amazing skill and amazing paintjob. Would love a nurse -hint hint-
---
He'd be too op
---
No I haven't
---
When all that locker hiding pays off
---
Healing is for suckers.
---
Why can't the PTB come out to console?
---
more like a nerf
---
yikes here i was waiting for a buff... something like less sound when you jump down with balanced landing or maybe the speed boost triggering after the stagger is over. The actual boost duration feels so weak compared to sprint burst or lithe.
---
I get why it was nerfed, I'm a survivor main, but I rarely used BL
---
Yeee boi I always use empathy solo. As soon as I see an outline pop up I start gen rushing.
---
Then don‚Äôt complain when Thanatophobia slows down your gens.
---
It's just that whenever I'm in a match no one does anything at all even if being camped
---
This is sad. I'd love to see how Myers and the Huntess talk.. Will she just scream at him and he'll nod a certain way that says "why yes my dear friend,I agree"
---
Oh no...what did they do this time?
---
A problem? When was the last time you knew nothing about a killer/survivor before bhvr reveal/release.
---
Its same old same old its the standard at this point not a problem. DbD players always want to know whats coming we all share the information because we are all excited how is that bad?
---
So more mobility but less potential, got it
---
Easy way to figure this out: infect someone with the Black Plague and have them vomit on you. You‚Äôll get a first hand experience of how her corrupt purge feels.
---
Honestly it wouldn't surprise me if this got claimed to be the rework
---
They got the spirit nerfs completely right.
---
They also got classic ghostface right.
---
Danny Devito comes with 3 new perks
---
the first perk is called "IM THE TRASHMAN": You are the trashman, you take out the trash! Start with 3 tokens, use the action button to throw a trashcan at the killer and wound them, during this state you are able to pick the trashcan up and BAM smash it down on their head which is prolong the stun. each trashcan throw consumes a token 
---
the second perk is "Anyway, I started blasting": Thank god you had your pieces, when downed you can automatically hop back up and start firing wildly at the killer which will reduce the killer's speed by 9mps when they are within 15 meters of you however this only applies when they are looking at you, when moving away the killer gains a speed boost
---
the last perk is "Suicide Is Badass": If you progress to the second hook stage after only being hooked once you will automatically be unhooked and retain the struggle phase for one more hooking
---
On one hand, nice to see the pin add-ons are no longer completely useless.
---
On the other hand, why nerf mending and removing the few good perk synergies Legion had?
---
Or atleast as thicc
---
I think it's been leaked somewhere that DC penalties are coming soon (i think literally in the next chapter). :)
---
I find It to be pretty consistent tbh
---
Isn't that a skin? Are all skins canon?
---
Rank rewards was addressed recently, I don't have a link but I remember them saying that they were looking for a more viable system along with a new ranked overhaul.
---
Perk changes and killer changes are not as easy because they also require test time, they just completely reworked Freddy recently along with adding variations for his map, some perks have been changed as well, legion, nurse, and spirit got changes recently while also adding Ghostface and working on the new chapter, you need to understand that they can't literally change a full game in 1 patch.
---
The fact that DLC is done doesn't mean they're perks have to be good, that would turn the game into Pay To Win on a certain degree.
---
Most of the questions they asked were light hearted because this is not a Developer Update, it's a AMA, they are just trying to hangout with the community in a way.
---
The game is not perfect but they are obviously working on it, I really don't know what your problem is.
---
Ah ok, i see.
---
Thanks for the fast reply.
---
So this might just be some kind of bug on pc, it didn't happen (or if, i didn't notice) to any of my challenges on ps 4
---
Sloppy butcher will not apply if this change go through. You would have to hit them with a regular non frenzy hit for sloppy butcher to work
---
I chased a survivor out of the exit and when I went back into the actual map, I ran into the only survivor that I had hit, that game, and got a kill on him as everyone else escaped and they were in a group chat and invited me to it, and all I head was that I suck and threats to my mother...
---
yeah i have had this problem in the past with inviting my friends to parties and it doesnt let me talk them because of it and inviting friends sometimes wont let kyf matches on rare occasions
---
If you don‚Äôt have a source, you‚Äôre talking out of your ass as far as I know
---
Frank would be the survivor, and Dennis would be the killer
---
(Freddy looks to Leigon, both at the gallows) "First time?"
---
Otzdarva reference
---
They've answered all those things before, it can be summed up with a simple No
---
Wat
---
I think you just don‚Äôt know what you want.  They LITERALLY addressed legion and doctor getting reworks.  Are you not satisfied with the tomes and rift as a rank reward alternative?  Perks are constantly getting reworked and buffed.  There are only so many ideas cut them slack.  Have any bright ideas for perks?  I doubt it.
---
hey guys, i think we're really forgetting about the most absolutely broken aspect of the game, killers can attack but survivors can't. please fix!!!!
---
I dont get it.
---
It really didn‚Äôt. BL is practically useless on certain maps, I feel like the risk of running the perk it definitely warrants the ‚Äúinfinites‚Äù on Hawkins and such.
---
I 100% agree with you.
---
You realize that was part of the joke?
---
Just hereafter I was mori'd by a spirit true story
---
Spirit:NANI
---
&gt; It's a hole of radioactivity
---
And you're part of it... Trying to tell everyone that they need to play in a certain way or they're toxic.
---
The fact that you don't think saying "If you always walk around the hook just waiting for someone to get the unhook, then go back immediatly straight to the unhooked guy, then you're just straight up toxic" isn't trying to dictate how your opponent plays, you're not only being absurd, you're being a fucking idiot.
---
Stop trying to dictate how your opponent plays. Stop trying to rationalize trying to dictate how your opponent plays. You're nothing more than an entitled survivor crying that your opponent dares to try and win.
---
NOED PLEASE
---
when do we get a adam MMA outfit?
---
I hate when people call butt dances teabags smh
---
This thread isn't a direct line to the devs.
---
Ruin is always a good choice but personally I feel like it's too much of a crutch for me. I have weaned myself off of Ruin on most Killers except for the ones that definitely need it like Trapper and Hag. I usually replace the slot for ruin with whispers.
---
*shine sound effect* HYAH
---
Monitor and abuse gives the hag a crazy low heartbeat aura of 24 meters. 2nd best in the game next to Myers.
---
Same man, I honestly can‚Äôt play without it now. It‚Äôs kinda a problem
---
As a person who has Autism, I take offense to his comment.
---
I think it‚Äôs his newest video about dc‚Äôs. It‚Äôs pretty funny.
---
You are one pathetic crybaby
---
literally why I never run this perk as an Adam main.
---
gotcha
---
Honestly, having them do some community outreach stuff is pretty cool.  I really don‚Äôt feel like it was a slap in the face? If you‚Äôre really that salty about them doing something kinda cool, maybe take a break from the game.
---
Legion and doctor are not the only low tier killers in the game ALL of them need tuning, the rift is one of the shittiest substitutes for a rank reward system on the planet. Not that the rift is bad, but it doesn‚Äôt hold a candle to actual ranked rewards and there‚Äôs no reason we can‚Äôt have both. If you‚Äôve seen the recent ‚Äúbuffs‚Äù they‚Äôve made to perks you‚Äôd know they‚Äôre laughable at best. 
---
And I have a fuck load of bright ideas for perks so hang tight and let me type them all out for you because you asked one sec brb
---
NOOO my very exclusive barbecue cosmetics! its not like literally everyone on ps4 has them because the game was free for ps plus users!
---
Steam has a feature where, should a game support it, players can enable experimental updates. DBD supports this, as does My Summer Car, for example.
---
Consoles do not support this. Until they do, BHVR would have to release a second game that uses the same accounts as the main game, shares all the DLC and is only playable during PTBs.
---
This isn't feasible.
---
I feel you. Also in their defense, their past 4 dlcs have actually had at least one strong perk within them but some people just refuse to go away from old "meta" builds (I.E. BBQ, Ruin, Enduring and SF). 
---
Legion gave use Discordance which is an excellent information perk.
---
Plauge gave us Infectious and Corrupt. One which is good for stall, prep and funneling (especially with setup killers like Hag and Trapper). The other is great for pressure.
---
With Ghostface we got Thrilling which is honestly a better BBQ. It gives you amazing awareness along with stall and regression when paired with the right perks.  Honestly an S tier perk.
---
And Surge isn't that bad. Solid on M1 killers that lack map pressure and you don't have to waste time kicking gens.
---
Flashlight clicking really gets people's attention when I'm like 
---
"Stop running bitch I have We'll Make It"
---
What this person said I NEEDED it and then I just threw on a diff perk and just had to learn to find out the killer early and play form there. Tho there have been times u missed it dearly
---
What was the old one
---
and they didn‚Äôt post it until i made a post asking why they didn‚Äôt post it
---
No keep it up eventually you'll plateau where your killer skills arent as good as the survivors you're playing against.
---
I know it's a meme, but I'm all for it. So long as they don't start going crazy adding in celebrities. Bruce Campbell opened the door, I'm cool with one or two more.
---
I died when otz disconnects because of the ds
---
Oh no he didn't hand in a three page essay about the topic. How dare he just try to have a casual conversation without trying to convince the reddit demigod FU4FREE fuck him amirite
---
Yes because we all know "no u" is a new and original joke
---
yeah i agree his power isnt game breaking like spirit or nurse
---
I did read your rant, and what‚Äôs concerning about the Plague?
---
You were a god if u knew god to loop back then
---
While the changes to the rank reset are nice and needed, I wish they would also change the adept killer achievements to require only a 4K. Getting a Merciless with some killers base kits was already challenging and rank reset at least gave an opportunity to try them in green ranks where the system didn't require all 4 emblems to be iri.
---
Wait, what did they do to them?
---
Show them to me. I'll get my swf, that has won several tourneys including space esports ones, and dissprove you.
---
Nah I agree more with how Scott looks at it. We are not gonna get anyway arguing so let‚Äôs let bygones be bygones. Have a good day
---
Imagine going to someone‚Äôs rant to complain about them ranting and not seeing the immediate irony in it
---
Mate, it may have been clear to you what you were trying to say but it‚Äôs pretty ambiguous.
---
Legion: "What happens if we want to get buffed?"   
---
[BHVR:](https://youtu.be/iJapX2gGOIY?t=2)
---
no ez tho
---
thats just toxic
---
A glitch
---
eh she kinda was just the last one to be alive.
---
Avoiding things people have been concerned about for years is not ‚Äúkinda cool‚Äù at all. And of course I‚Äôm salty because ITS A RANT
---
This won't even come close to stopping me from shipping killers, nice try Mcote
---
Oh geez, hard to remember. But it was something like however many ranks away you were from 20 is how many Pips got taken away to calculate your new rank. So if you were ranked 10 it would take away 10 Pips dropping you to rank 13 or something.
---
Literally anytime anything happens, a new status effect change... a gen gets completed... anything, console killers get a lag spike, it's quite annoying
---
STBFL was nice on him for sure, but sometimes wasn‚Äôt necessary if you try and juggle everyone being hurt. But in the flip side easy to stack up and chain hits together. 
---
This is all bad news.
---
El famoso team that won every tournament in every game, beat Donald Trump, Created a intergalactial empire and got into Heaven to kill God, El Famoso SWF PC team
---
Huntress: mentally 7 year old furry
---
You have to guess which of the two options she will do. The thing about nurse is her counter-play is quite obvious. Line of sight breakers to extend the chase. It feel like I‚Äôm actually outplaying the nurse instead of guessing.
---
Ok.
---
Not everyone got them, as maybe they didn't partecipate in the event. But regardless, you console players had no chance to get skins like Street Meg for example.
---
Ahh darn, my strategy is all wrong haha. Thanks for the info!
---
With an add on you can mark where things are on the map.
---
Sometimes I get so annoyed by what counts as being in the chase and what doesn't. sometimes i'm just right behind some dude and just waiting for the game to catch up and notice i am indeed chasing him.
---
I mean, these are the same devs that can't be bothered to play their own killers at high ranks.
---
Oh the new one sounds much more efficient
---
Not soon enough.
---
Holy fuck you are so slow
---
The game has shifted to where it is really hard to derank and easier to rank up. With this change where a red rank would go to a rank 5, eventually everyone who plays a decent amount will  
---
be red ranks because it won‚Äôt take many games to get back to red and then you‚Äôre stuck there. I would have to take like a 3 month haitus to go back to rank 12 like I normally would after rank reset for perspective on how the new system will work.
---
i play nurse so i can teleport through the stress
---
The Glass Bead add-on for the map allows you to place a marker by pressing the secondary action button (the button to drop pallets). The marker can be seen by all survivors and you can use it multiple times, replacing the previous marker.
---
It makes his terror radius 40.32 without you using add-ons which makes his passive aoe madness in shock therapy mode larger without using the "Calm" add-ons
---
Honestly. These two perks alone allow you to stick to your friends like glue and do every generator very quickly. Prove Thyself with only one other survivor removes the diminishing returns from working together (almost) completely, making it take ~40 seconds per generator.
---
With four people on one gen you get 3.64 charges per second in total meaning it takes roughly 21 seconds to do a generator with four friends, with out tool boxes.
---
If this is true, Feral Frenzy no longer being a basic attack is really going to hurt perks like Sloppy Butcher, Third Seal and Franklin's Demise.
---
Took them long enough.
---
That‚Äôs because you‚Äôre a moron.
---
‚ÄúInfinites‚Äù are not good for the game.
---
Here's the link to the upcoming patch notes: https://imgur.com/gallery/UBmPoRR
---
Basically:
---
All the devs did was change their pin addons and make frenzy a little faster.
---
 Then they nerfed filthy blade, made mending easier, and took away the synergy with STFBL/Sloppy Butcher. 
---
Meanwhile, Frank's mixtape and the cooldown addons are still useless, and legion currently suffers from a kitchen sink full of unnecessary downsides (frenzy still drains after you hit a survivor for some reason)
---
If it was clear what I was saying (as it was for most people who read this) then it‚Äôs not at all ambiguous for people to understand what I meant
---
So Franklins ain't gonna work in Frenzy anymore?
---
Well you see them watching the survivors from a distance and i like to think if you could see behind them you just see all the killers hanging around
---
She's truly "doing gens, u?"
---
What is a Reverse Chainsaw?
---
Hahahaha yes, THE CARNAGE!
---
It was glorious.

---
Thank you very much! A lot of effort going into that music and sound editing so I appreciate the recognition :))
---
Well, if you don't think tunneling and/or camping are an unhealthy thing for the game's quality of life, then I have nothing else to say here. Good thing most of the community agrees, though.
---
You‚Äôre not answering the question, but rather, dodging it. Do you not know the answer? Hypocritical much?
---
I like how people in the comments can't grasp the PS4 share button
---
2 separate tutorials, 25k each. I doubt you would get extra for a BP event though
---
Potassium.
---
Bro ngl but theses imgur pics are really blurry
---
Distressing is only good if you have the addons necessary, otherwise dont do it. So its situationally good, yes.
---
Because he was boring as hell with his ‚Äúforever‚Äù build.
---
It was really bad for the health of the game. Legion needs a full rework.
---
It‚Äôs still Wraith. Dude is in desperate need of a buff.
---
Same D:
---
R.I.P. purple flashlight I stole from someone.
---
What about fixing the god fucking damned hitboxes?
---
The fact that you're below 0 in downvotes, while I'm positive, shows that most of the community doesn't agree.
---
The fact that you can't understand this shows just how absurd you are.
---
Except you can force him to miss a hit and there it is - his power none-existant for a few seconds.
---
Still fun when it works I love it
---
The upcoming patch is having some viable buffs to MoM, Kindred, and No one left behind which makes them all usable honestly.  Obviously every perks can‚Äôt be as good as DS,  BT, and an exhaustion perk but are more helpful than not.  And they have to make new content to keep their game alive so they can‚Äôt only focus on reworking maps killers etc.
---
Those survivors would never try to gen rush me way out here on Coldwind Farm. Because of the implication.
---
Head on is a meme. Lithe is dogshit. Dead Hard doesn‚Äôt work half the time. Sprint Burst is gonna be on the rise ladies and gentleman.
---
Cosmetics aren‚Äôt canon
---
Otz the god
---
Maybe, or maybe you don't research the things you complain about.
---
It's called Burden Of Proof, a legal standard that requires a party making a claim to demonstrate the claim is valid.
---
You obviously didnt know they addressed the ranked overhaul, which is fine, you don't have to keep up to date with every update on the game, unless you are gonna make a thread like this, I'm not about to search a post from a month ago to spoil someone who doesn't fact check what he says, if you want help with the search it's somewhere on they're forum.
---
I wish I could play the game you‚Äôre playing, man. I played my first killer game in weeks last night, got 3/4 of them, and immediately in chat one of them says, ‚ÄúYo kid u suck at legion‚Äù. Like, okay. I didn‚Äôt even do anything to you.
---
I'd say 0.2 m/s is a pretty big buff, but how about we play it and see if it's bad? 
---
If the patch fixes his perspective on vaulting, increases ms, and gives a faster vault, I think most legion mains would be okay with losing some power from his addons and power. I think stbfl and third seal are overrated on legion anyway.
---
I‚Äôm a bit concerned about how the disconnect ban will work. I‚Äôm a console player and I don‚Äôt have the best internet cause I‚Äôm a student, so every now and then my game randomly disconnects midway through. Will I be banned for that even though I‚Äôm not doing it intentionally?
---
Look how they massacred my boy üò≠
---
Both of Hag's titties hanging out?
---
Well... Since the Clown and the Nurse share the same realm, maybe the cross-path eachother
---
In your life you‚Äôll encounter people who will criticize you because they genuinely want to help you. There are also people who will do it just because they get a rise out of being hurtful to others sadly. The trick is finding when someone isn‚Äôt actually trying to help you and then you can tune them out. Don‚Äôt take criticism from anyone you wouldn‚Äôt take advice from.
---
They should remove pallets based on the number of friends together. This way you wouldn't need to try hard to have fun...
---
there really is no guesswork. If you were waiting to see if she uses her power or not then you‚Äôre not playing right.  You wouldn‚Äôt stand on the opposite end of a pallet against the nurse why do you think you have to against the spirit?
---
Because a large chunk of the community plays only one side, so their opinions are biased and unreliable, and another large chunk doesn't bother with forums and Reddit, and are, for the most part, totally unaware of anything until it happens.
---
Dude... no one is concerned about the plague. This rant has nothing to do with the plague. Let me fill you in 
---
‚ÄúAvoiding something like the plague‚Äù is a saying that‚Äôs been around for a long time and most people understood that. 
---
And It‚Äôs just straight up sad but also hilarious I had to explain that to you not once but twice.
---
Yea but we‚Äôre not okay with the mend time and the fact that frenzy attacks don‚Äôt count as basic attacks.
---
Someone tell me how I'm meant to counter Plague - spending the entire round wounded and vomiting loudly makes everything one sided, and people just say "dodge the puke" like it's easy.  Even if you get around one or two she can do so many of them, it's not always possible to duck behind something and even if you do it's not a long term solution vs the length of her power.  Corrupt Purge is basically the most unfun thing in the game right now and nobody cleanses so its impossible to get all of the shrines to clear out.
---
Well, actually, I'm also positive on upvotes.
---
The fact that you think that the 2 people who upvoted the replies here are "most of the community" shows how absurd you are. Look up threads around the internet about tunneling on DBD and see it yourself.
---
Play with an SWF and get berated for being the worst on the team and have your friends unironically insult you like crazy
---
\*DING\* \*DING\* A meeting will cow come to Order!
---
Ha jokes on you! Legion can't proc Sloppy butcher anymore. Sad days
---
Oh yea i agree, BL on maps like haddonfield and pantry is just sad. this change should be fine, if not a little strange to get used to at first

So Franklins no longer works with him? Welp I wasted about 10 dollars on them. (I bought them with the smeared smirk mask, defiant streetwear hoodie, and the survival knife)
---
DEMOGORGAN WHY DON'T WE PLAY NIGHT CRAWLERS ANYMORE!?
---
Sloppy butcher doesn‚Äôt require basic hits to activate
---
Again, no source, no sauce. Keep yapping
---
People will just suicide on hook now instead to get around it.
---
Their ‚Äúcode‚Äù is Unreal Engine, same as fort nite. It‚Äôs not that they can‚Äôt, they just don‚Äôt know how to do it.
---
Maybe Rin‚Äôs best friend! Went searching to see what happened to her and got taken by the Entity
---
Them maybe those people need to get gud or just unistall imo.
---
How many more DLC do you guys plan on adding? I imagine you‚Äôll have to stop eventually.
---
entity be lovin cheese
---
Their engine is able but the way the game is coded makes ot to where they cannot.
---
He was already an alternative to Bubba for me. Just run meme builds I guess. ;/
---
BL is still better than Lithe in my opinion. BL allows you to do certain gens and use drops safely. Not a fan of Lithe since usually it takes you away from a safe pallet or jungle gym that you could have just easily kept looping. But to each their own.
---
I think dcs should be punished,  especially for people who dc first down, dc because ruin gets broken, they don't like the map and so on. 
---
But I think they should add changes so that, if i killer is face camping the entity doesn't progress. A lot of people DC because they don't wanna hang on the hook the entire damn match.
---
I rock bond and open handed pretty much permanently. Cycle the other 2 to various things. I have actually began running more aura oriented stuff in general over the basic meta builds. I‚Äôm enjoying it a lot more.
---
It‚Äôs fine on PS4 pro but base PS4 is kinda laggy depending on the map and killer. I don‚Äôt know how it is on Xbox.
---
Theres so many better perk options but I respect your opinion.

thats a crispy looking lasagna

Or the old shack that had 2 windows? Pepperidge farm remembers.

Doesnt apply to mending it applies to healing

Devs tried that and it was quickly abused soo it was removed asap.

FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Sloppy butcher doesn‚Äôt require basic hits
---
I think the difficulty for the skill checks should be rank dependent and more frequent. The reasoning for getting rid of greats is because making skill checks more frequent while maintaining the great could actually make them go faster, which defeats the purpose.
---
I read the upcoming patch notes about those perk buffs before I even made the rant. MAYBE kindred becomes viable but the rest are still laughable at best
---
Because his ability to get those stbfl stacks and stack those slow down perks was too ezpz. 
---
Rather over rewarding when your power lets you tunnel and see where survivors are through walls.
---
I was going to get Franklins and bamboozle whenever they came out of the shop but I guess I'm never going to play Legion again fml
---
I always tought this was the most logical thing to happen.
---
Besides guys like Danny who is methodical and pretty much the same he was in life just with superpowers. the other guys have a lot of their mental capabilities diminished by their madness.
---
Exactly; they don‚Äôt know how to do it. Same excuse as riot games.
---
Sorry you‚Äôre mad man
---
You forgot the "spend 15 mins searching for a game as a killer"
---
I use bond and Spine Chill so I always know what's happening. I want to make a meme build with Bond, Empathy, Spine Chill and Alert. I'll have the same map awareness as the god damn Doctor
---
i've recently gotten back into the game, and i'm a little surprised by how often this has been happening.
---
I don't have the app so they're really blurry for me
---
This hurts even more now.
---
Assume there's a good Legion that gets around 15 stabs in frenzy, possibly even more, that's 45 seconds lost due to this nerf. More importantly, why nerf him in the first place? He wouldn't overperform as his power is still borderline useless against people who don't heal.
---
no u
---
How was it abused? I must have not been playing during this. A lot of things are set the to punish surviviors,  but never killers and it is kind of frustrating.

Oh the irony
---
Does it work with Feral Frenzy?
---
Lol funny and original
---
Danny Devito could have a skin as a clown it could have different variations such as trash man or something like that or he could be a licensed killer I know The  whole thing is a joke but now I want Danny Devito in dbd as a killer

He‚Äôs a console player. The same ppl as those ‚Äúpeople of Walmart‚Äù pictures you laugh at. What more can you expect.  /s
---
I use it when I don't have empathy to try and get Mettle of Man stacks
---
They still need a good basis to tell when it‚Äôs time to change a killer. DC‚Äôs are one method. If people are going out of their way to not be in a game, then mayyyybe there‚Äôs something wrong with the killer. 
---
Are you gonna say ‚Äúgit gud or uninstall‚Äù to the Legion mains who just got nerfed?
---
What I'm saying is that even if they knew how they might have there code set up to where is they wanted to impliment such a change they would have to litterally change the entire games code
---
Same boat here, missed it but i did ask about it and from what i was told it was abused alot.
---
Yep. I swear survivors just need to wiggle side to side a bit now, let alone 360 me, when running and I can‚Äôt hit them.
---
You know there is a bug where you are invulnerable and stuck at the hook. You won\`t even die with EGC. The timer goes away after it has run out. Picture could have been taken after EGC was over
---
Well not everyone only likes to run the 4 Meta perks for 600 hours of gameplay.  I‚Äôll be using Kindred for sure in solo, and I‚Äôd like to try an endgame build myself soon so no one left behind works very well.  Plus a body blocking build for bloodpoints including MoM
---
Most of the Killers seem like they'd be practically incompatible with one another, in the sense that they'd probably attempt to kill each other. Wouldn't be surprised if the Entity sometimes pit them against one another from time to time just to get that sweet, sweet hate and anger.
---
Just from a lore perspective, I'd say the only Killers that could even possibly hang out with one another without being at each other's throats from the moment they come face-to-face would be Legion, Ghostface, and Clown, though even then it'd probably eventually devolve into a bloodbath. So having them be placed somewhere all by their lonesome between trials makes sense to me from a lore perspective, 'cause most of the Killers are just not normal enough, can't remain normal long enough, or are completely incapable of proper communication, to hang out and converse.
---
Sloppy should still work
---
Imagine Danny devito naked crawling out of the ground like when he crawls out of the couch in Its Always Sunny
---
Don't forget that they didn't even acknowledge the add-ons that do almost nothing!
---
On the forums iv'e been seeing threads being deleted talking about the nerfs, i don't know if they cant talk about data mined content on there or the mods are genuinely deleting the threads for no reason.
---
It looks like a cheap birthday cake decor.There should be a better version for 3d printing
---
It‚Äôs good if you run 3 gen Doc (Distressing / Unnerving Presence / Overcharge)
---
Otherwise no.
---
So you want to bury your chest in her face?
---
Surge should apply a 8% regression on the whole map but without the post-regression and the cooldown. This would make sense with PGTW: Do you prefer an insta 25% on a single gen or only 8% on every gen? Second Wind should work every time you healed someone but without being hooked and outside of a chase. Fixated shouldn't have the healed restriction. Done, I fixed 3 perks that could be good but were overly restricted.
---
Just hope there will somehow be a distinction between intentional DCs and DCs caused by bad connection
---
No need to be sorry, I‚Äôm only being angry to make this rant feel more like a rant
---
I thought it was clam-slamming.
---
Dcing is not a good way to tell if a killer is broken or not, it just shows you are that much of an ass that wants ez games.
---
And it has nothing to do with legion.
---
Aww sh*t it could also be a Demogordon skin too that be freaky and arousing at the same time good idea
---
Wait whaaaaat?! Noooooooo! Why why oh why did they do this! I‚Äôm gonna get Steve now noooooooooooooooo!( Steve is good I was gonna get him anyways but I have to wait for Xmas)
---
Sorry if they are homie, they're just the only ones available. I stole them from r/leaksbydaylight
---
Scott knows Spirit has meaningful counterplay too, but he also knows "but it's not fun" is subjective and not a compelling reason to nerf her so he argues disingenuously, memes, and circlejerks with survivors that there's no counter play hoping that Spirit will get changed.
---
The trouble is survivors don't understand that he's memeing and being hyperbolic so all they learn from that is to bitch on the forums and DC against spirit.
---
With dedicated servers we should get more info now
---
Hi,
---
so, I have a rather budgety graphics card (RX 560 - no clue whether that's higher of lower than an AMD HD 8800 as these series are a jungle, but it does have the recommended 4 GB of RAM; any other game I play is at least 5-10 years old and not that demanding), which I find often having some graphical lag spikes in mostly killer games (survivor is a lot smoother on average, so I mostly play only survivor), occurring more commonly on larger and 'fancier' maps (like Red Forest, Campbell's Chapel, Badham Preschool) and on some types of "moments of action" - hit animations (sometimes), Nurse blink (in particular), Evil Within increase, blowing up a gen (as survivor in that case); I think the map has the largest impact on how impactful the spikes get, on some maps it's barely noticeable.
---
Having already set every in-game setting to Minimum helps, even messed with gameusersettings ini file a bit to try and get my quality and resolution down further (on 1280x720, didn't manage to go all the way down to something like 800x600), but it's not quite there yet where these fluctuations would be gone. Do you have any recommendations on how to possibly get a bit more stable FPS rates? Are there any plans to 'migrate' settings from the ini files to in-game options that might be helpful to such borderline toasters?
---
Also, perhaps - Is there a possibility there will be a 'classical' resolution selection thingy in the future rather than the percentage bar, which seems to work in mysterious ways?
---
I knew where a Claudette was cuz auras, so I swung around a corner and hit her. Even though I knew she was there, and hit her, I literally could not see her. It made me irate knowing I've probably walked by 100 people doing it. It's kinda crazy how cheap the value is, it basically feels like Claudette has a unique perk called Camo.
---
The huntress always did take a liking to innocent young girls.
---
Just kill us at this point
---
god earlier today i had a spirit teleport like 5meters behind me after a pallet stun when she was way in front of me (no she didn't use her ability). Later that match i heard an attack miss as i threw down a pallet and I went down a second later.
---
There is almost no way to force a miss, that's the Legion being bad (or him whiffing due to shitty autoaim). Same could be said about bubba, survivors will not put themselves in a dead zone unless its rotten fields.
---
All Legions took it anyway.
---
otz made this post anonymously
---
fuck me, this game is way to rng based and unbalanced to implement somthing like this
---
0/10 ghostface not thicc enough that kinda look like a tasty snack though
---
The guy who doesn't have enough footage complains that he doesn't want to record enough footage.  Everything else you type has been worthless tantrum.  Then why are you doing it at all? Keep rambling bro.
---
Imagine operating your bank accounts and savings like that.  "I don't need $2000 in my savings because my bills come to $1450.  You're an idiot if you think I should have a penny more in there"
---
How can you correlate that to my statement...?
---
God you should feel terrible. I do too when I use I head,if you didn't I'd be concerned.
---
This is just speculation so take it with a grain of salt but it depends on what kind of gen usually it pops u in front of the gen but I find if a survivor is working on it it places you on whatever side is open
---
Hmmm, I honestly don't know how it could of been abused lol. Especially if they did,  like if the killer is infront of the hook and no other survivior is within so many meters unless end game because then I get face camping. I still hardly ever DC, but get why people do it in some cases. Just frustrating. I've also had killer matches that I have wanted to DC from, but they fixed those issues with EGC and so on. Just wish killers had a more strict punishment from bad game play like that, instead of emblem progress because most face campers don't wanna pip anyways.
---
Lol you really are salty aren‚Äôt you.
---
99% of Legions took sloppy. Ive barely seen any take STBFL
---
Oh it totally does. 
---
People were DC‚Äôing from Legion left and right back when he was mega OP. See, you‚Äôre so tilted in the favor of killers that you will A- Not stop to think that just MAYBE people don‚Äôt want to play games with killers who have exploits or are OP and B- refuse to admit you won‚Äôt tell a killer that they just need to ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù and instead only focus your butthurt on survivors.
---
I'm more into Chadlissas than Chads. But I'll stop ;-;
---
oh right, kimura is a different last name from spirit after all. haha. maybe she's rin's totally lesbo classmate or something. oh wait dbd isn't anime
---
Not everyone wants to run meta stuff sure. But everyone wants all/most of the perks in the game to be viable. That‚Äôs my point, cherry pick it how you like this is done lol
---
Hmm I wonder what buffs his "Demon Mode" power will give him
---
Anyone else notice the survivor community on DBD so sensitive and the second they get hooked or downed they DC or messege you ‚Äúcamping trash‚Äù even though you didn‚Äôt camp.
---
And yet you never mentioned colorblind settings for killers. RIP.
---
I just wanted to use it because why not. But then I felt bad after a dc 12 seconds into the game
---
what about the legion ?
---
This is not a discussion about legion pre-nerf.
---
And no. Dcing proves you just want ez games.
---
trapper goes to taco bell
---
Plus one more thing I mainly play legion and I don‚Äôt use stbfl so I don‚Äôt care about them stacking but the movement speed buff and vault speed buff along with pallet speed buff made it possible to bodyblock pallets and windows I like The changes even though majority don‚Äôt
---
I haven‚Äôt had any real problems aside from Lobby Lag
---
And on certain maps Balanced Landing has only one or two places you can use it. 
---
Taking time to change the maps would have been harder, but it would have also actually fixed the larger problem.
---
BL getting nerfed isn't a bad thing, but it is part of a disturbing trend to take the easy way out and avoid fixing the game's core problems.
---
I love how his name is different in every meme
---
my friends and i where joking that we are getting an actual wifu in game, i do think it would be cute to have a crossdressing character, like Chihiro Fujisaki from danganronpa 
---
just a random thought though
---
Lmao. You STILL refuse to acknowledge I‚Äôm your own bias. What a child. 
---
Hope everyone suicides on your games so they‚Äôre always boring for you. Good luck, kid.
---
Base ps4 be like *useless* noises
---
Oh noes. Will Feng retain her crown as no 1 weeb fave or will Yui snatch it?
---
Jeez you sure are one toxic fun guy to play with/against.
---
Incredibly underrated
---
One of my favorites is wraith with sloppy and nurses with his quick reveal addons, you can‚Äôt lose someone in a chase and they can‚Äôt heal each other
---
I link to think of games as after all the fighting is happening, they are all just friends. Like doctor and hag just eating lunch together or something like that
---
Wow. Killers have ruin, corrupt intervention, NOED, franklins and so on. I think killers are "forgetting" surviviors objective is SURPRISE, to SURVIVE. We deserve items, perks, and add ons that allow us a chance as well.
---
Rin's step sister.
---
crossdressing?? maybe female to male, like a tomboy, like where she wears ties and has short hair. and then anyone who actually wants her to look like a girl has to wait for expensive cosmetics
---
One hour per week\*
---
I have a feeling people like you are at the heart of this. Disconnecting so the devs get the impression that the killer is ‚ÄúOver performing‚Äù when in reality it‚Äôs your inability to adapt to the different play styles of different killers. Who gives a fuck about legions that use sloppy. A perk is a perk. What I‚Äôm mad about is the fact Cote doesn‚Äôt play his game or even listen to the community‚Äôs view on the current atmosphere.
---
dedicated servers made survivors turning really smooth
---
I want a trash man killer
---
These fuckin' Megs man, I swear they don't even know they're playing DBD, they think they're playing the new Tomb Raider.
---
So it'll be useless
---
Not for another 2 weeks at least dude.
---
A fucking homicide
---
I'm only curious if it's strictly DC at the beginning of the match or if loading screens count. 
---
Because if it counts on loading screens then I'll go grab popcorn and patiently wait for first person to get banned due to crashes.
---
and make that quadruple
---
Freddy: Later Bitches!
---
There‚Äôs changes to Sprint Burst? What are they?
---
Nope they can burn in hell
---
Not quite. Thrilling tremors can only activate every 80 seconds, when in red ranks that‚Äôs every other time I pick up a survivor, surge on the other hand sees way more use as it is every 40 seconds AND has potential to do more than just 8% as it also starts regression, which is why surv comes into play very well, surv is a better thrilling tremors alone imo.
---
Ikr. Might as well main someone else at this point.
---
Thank you for your service
---
Why they would hide all game
---
Bold of you to admit that.
---
Loading screen crashes wont be counted because the match will end / wont start and refund everyone the addon/offering like nothing happend.
---
but it has the same problem as ash, he would beat the hell out of any killer
---
I'll still use him. I enjoy running around stabbing people aimlessly!
---
That's actually pretty cool.
---
You clearly dont play the character
---
All those threads are survivors complaining and trying to dictate how their opponents play.
---
There's an equal number of threads asking for people to be banned for camping. Or complaining that the killer protected ruin. Or that killers use to dribble to counter DS. 
---
Or any number of things that entitled, crybaby survivors continually complain about while trying to dictate how their opponents play the game.
---
What you can't seem to understand, past anything else, is that your attempt to dictate how your opponent plays is meaningless. It doesn't matter how many other entitled, crybaby survivors happen to agree with you -- No one gets to dictate how another player plays the game.
---
If you don't like an aspect of the game, that's your opinion. Luckily, as I keep telling you, your opinion is meaningless.
---
Your fun is your own responsibility. No one gets to dictate how another player plays the game.
---
I love the legion crew. They aren‚Äôt my mains but they are in my Top 5 killers I play.
---
I didn‚Äôt ask why they would hide all game did I?
---
Maybe they'd stick with Feng if SHE HAD ANY GOOD COSMETICS!
---
For sure, but take into considering maps like Haddonfield, the game, and maps with large structures that can infinite‚Äôs created just by running a perk.  This would take EXTREMELY long to do.  Multiple maps reworked completely just for one perk is kind of silly.  Especially when some of these maps don‚Äôt need reworks
---
A large part of people DCing is to spite the killer. Just giving up on hook benefits the killer even more.
---
I think he‚Äôs saying he would like a character that‚Äôs biologically male but dresses as a female and pulls it off to the point that the cross-dresser is a wiafu-grade trap.
---
‚ÄúIf someone posted it we would have sticked it‚Äù
---
‚ÄúWe removed the post‚Äù
---
big brain
---
Well no but some people might not know right? Sorry for forgetting that you have to ask to reply to someone
---
Played Nurse for the first time after owning the game for over 2 years. Most stressful game of my life.
---
I'll be honest, if Devour is in the game and it's literally bugged out so that its impossible to be countered like it's supposed to be, I'm out.  I'll finish any match except for when its bugged. I'd rather spend those minutes finding another game than being clapped by an invincible hex totem.
---
Honestly, I was kind of hoping for "The Yamaoka" if it was the Ancestor.
---
Rin may be **A** Yamaoka, but there is only one **THE** Yamaoka.
---
I have a couple questions.
---
1. When are those stats being released that was mentioned in the Halloween stream.
---
2.Are there plans to rework maps like sheltered woods and blood lodge
---
I hope the killer ends up actually being Rin's dad, but then again i guess i wouldn't mind too much if it was her ancestor, would be cooler if it was the former personally
---
The bubber
---
Will we get Jim Hopper as a survivor ? I think he would of have been much better instead of nancy.
---
P3 Legion main... still gonna main even though bhvr hates me
---
He‚Äôs reached his final form
---
Why do you even care about dying. The game only gets worse the more you rank up.
---
The perk is just completely useless now. Its already map reliant. Instead of actually fixing the maps they just decided to gut a perk that was causing issues. Dead hard for distance it is I guess.
---
I have a friend who playes color blind hes alright
---
I'd prefer if this "hell" would just be a time out. I mean enough time to fix around 50 gens minimum.
---
I think people just assume this sub is run by the devs
---
Sloppy doesn‚Äôt require basic hits to activate that‚Äôs why chainsaws hit apply it and hatchets and dash attack and nurse blinks and surprise hits
---
december 17 should be the actual console release, so maybe december 3rd is the pbt?
---
I‚Äôm not saying legion is op at all. But in my experience people use his ability wrong. Most the legions will chase me forever without getting an injure and will just you use their right click to get a free injure and immediately leave it and keep chasing me. You‚Äôre not pressuring anyone. You‚Äôre just getting a free slap. But who am I to judge I guess
---
There‚Äôs also a poster next to a sausage box in the Haddonfield garage basement that says ‚ÄúAnxiety anxiety‚Äù and has a picture of the Wraith on it.
---
Even though I main bl, I kinda like this nerf because it makes more sense for in game logic
---
[HAG!!!](/intensifies)
---
Neither do I I just see a legion better at pressuring and chasing
---
The PTB will likely be this week. The chapter should release sometime in the second week of December
---
well ive found my new survivor main, bye bye nancy
---
&gt;One wiggle means that no one is coming and someone needs to head over to save before you hit Struggle phase
---
I knew the first 2, but wasn't aware of this one! Thank you!
---
It's awesome, love your style!
---
what nerf is legion getting?
---
I don't know exactly how it affects them tbh, I'm just used to seeing a group of people discussing it. Is he a survivor or killer main though? I feel like that could play a role in it too with the whole scratch mark/bleeding scenario.
---
Surge is so garbo xD
---
was the stranger things DLC on ptb like 4weeks before release on live build?
---
I‚Äôm so sorry. I forgot I‚Äôm just a dumb killer main who only camps, tunnels and slugs. What do I know???
---
No offence but try not using autism as an insult you fucking anti-vaxxer.
---
Why I play way too much killer recently.
---
Hit boxes are fucking abysmal, theres serious issues with lag, man this game is in the worst state of all time
---
wow 6 survivors? seems unfair.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs usually like 3-4 weeks before the release date
---
Imagine nerfing the worst killer in the game xD
---
If that‚Äôs what gets it for you man but I‚Äôm just a guy playing some vidya so if she passes I‚Äôm prolly just gonna pretend she‚Äôs female.
---
Whatcha mean by smooth?
---
FF Attacks aren‚Äôt considered basic attacks and mend times and blades were nerfed 
---
FF speed and vaulting was buffed in ‚Äúreturn‚Äù though
---
The Narnia juke is gone feelsbadman
---
I need the link to this photo
---
Narnia-whatnow?
---
I‚Äôve seen a streamer complain about ds not being anti tunnel after he tunneled someone of hook lmfao. The amount of times ds has saved my ass from being tunneled and camped is unbelievable. I‚Äôd hate if it got nerfed again for absolutely no reason. Most the time I get slugged or when I jump in a locker killers will SIT infront of the locker for the entire 60 seconds.
---
I guess this is their way of buffing Bubba
---
I don‚Äôt know why. Hawkins is probably the most killer-sided map on the game. The map is like 95% unsafe pallets
---
I took the time to carefully look at your poorly written rant and piss poor grammar. "But they ducked answering anything about the communities MAIN CONCERNS like the plague. " tell this to anyone, they'll ask the samething.
---
Someone will say something nice about him in the comments!
---
It‚Äôs a horrible map to be killer on and just to run it in more, we will probably wait close to 10-15 minutes for a map so it would just be not worth it
---
In the context of having Ruin AND ultra rares, moris and NOED.
---
Try reading the full post next time
---
Nah they‚Äôll be reading their suicide note
---
As long as we're touching. Idc.
---
Usually I get hit because I refuse to believe they are so dumb so I finally break the mindgame and drop a pallet...
---
Balanced Landing could be crazy strong, and nowhere near as situational as Bloodwarden (sure you might get Shelter Woods or a map with no Hill spawns, but that's not super common). 
---
I don't have an issue with BL getting nerfed (even if I'm not super happy about it).
---
I have an issue with them nerfing it *instead* of taking the time to fix the badly designed maps that caused the actual problem.
---
DCing proves that there are issues with the game's balance.
---
People are dcing from Spirit because of the counterplay, just like original legion back in december 2018 when he came out.
---
They aren't dcing cause the killer is too good, they are dcing cause the killer isn't fun to play against and/or broken as fuck.
---
Plays both equally. Hes also learned the shapes of survivors too with his bbq chilli.
---
Okay, glad it‚Äôs not just me. Never had that issue before. 360‚Äôs were easy before as I just spun my camera in the same direction and always got the smack. Guess I gotta adapt now and just get closer and do a quick attack instead of lunge when I catch on that they are doing it.
---
It's because it's not a very good map in general for killers or survivors to play on unless there are higher ranked in the lower ranks it's hard to find gens and killers can be looped pretty easy if the survivor knows what there doing in the lower rank.
---
btw would you recommend distressing or moniter and abuse?
---
Are you serious? There‚Äôs only like 2 safe pallets in the entire map
---
Friendship ended with Balanced Landing.
---
Now Lithe is my best friend.
---
No, they are changing balanced landing
---
Watch some videos on looping and wear some bright ass clothes. Plus take off spine chill if you have it and replace it with windows of opportunity. Watch yourself get better at the game within a couple hours. You can still mainly do gens, but you won't go down immediately and be a hindrance to your team if you can at least run the killer for a minute or two.
---
Bubba is already way better than Legion.
---
Doesn't Legion already have an addon better than Dark Devotion?
---
On first hook? Lmao. 
---
You rob the killer of more chasing, downing, and hooking points if you suicide on first hook, and you don‚Äôt get penalized by BHVR in the process.
---
When you hide in a locker and DC when the killer searches it. Its a meme dc.
---
You now only get the reduced stagger when you‚Äôre not exhausted
---
Idk the speed buff was kind of needed. Even if it's only 0.2 meters
---
Idk why. Im a killer main and I love the indoor maps since they're smaller and easier to approach survivors in. It may just be actual lost connection? I've been disconnected a few times at random in the past and one of them was while I was doc on Hawkins and let me tell you playing him there destroyed my frames lol.
---
You sure? Because I don't think it counts for Chainsaw or Hatchet (I could be wrong though).
---
Oh sweet summer child, they dc not because the killer is broken, they dc because they want ez games only.
---
Please read the top of the post for posting etiquette in this thread. It clearly states that this is not the place to reach the devs, and asks that you not spam the topic with multiple posts.
---
Nice account level.
---
Ohhh that, i know about that. Well rip then.
---
When you try to grab a survivor off a gen but it hits them or does nothing
---
just because we used to not have these things doesnt mean they should still be in the game just block the window entirely so survivors cant just go to them when they get hit and force u to leave them it takes 0 skill to hold forward and vault a window
---
Oh i, i dont think its hot. i just think its cute lmao
---
Why would anyone be upset about this?
---
Well as a console player with no friends on other platforms this just makes the game harder but I hope we at least get a higher max sensitivity to try and compete with pc players.
---
Uhm.... I‚Äôve not seen a single post being upset about this. Not before yours. 
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre just trying to stir up shit, claiming people have said things they haven‚Äôt.
---
Ye. I know why they did it. I‚Äôve played against a gang of Nea‚Äôs on haddonfield. It‚Äôs just one of those perks that‚Äôs really only good in a certain situation (in this case, the map), hence the blood warden comparison
---
Legion cosplays are so boooring tbh.
---
Get ready if you decide to do that because you will notice the rate you get a nice mori surprise will skyrocket.
---
maybe if I send this to my friend they'll finally listen to me... one can only hope
---
I‚Äôve been reading comments in r/leaksbydaylight
---
Amen
---
Are you insulted as a killer when all I did was explain the rank 1 survivor experience lul
---
Soooo legion is basically getting the pig treatment?
---
Leaks by daylight is a joke, I don't take anything they say seriously.
---
Who knows, I guess they probably want more variety in survivors. But like I said feng will probably be nothing like the new survivor
---
Provide a few examples of proof for your claim then, please.
---
Wow, they must have practically fed themselves to you!
---
It should work for chainsaw hits as I used to run it on billy
---
I'm so happy this is finally coming. Too many entitled twats treat this game like some sort of buffet. Now you either play the match out or start facing penalties. 
---
And even if suicides on hooks increase, it still forces the player to play the game for that amount of time. I know personally, if I see some toxic piece of shit try to suicide run at me within the first 30 seconds, they are getting slugged.
---
And leatherface
---
The cannibal elder from the hag story as a killer?
---
They nerfed mending and sloppy or STBFL builds
---
&gt;there is no excuse for us not to have ranked rewards by now. That‚Äôs not even a major update to add that shit just give
---
While I get your point that it needs to be implemented and it's not that hard, they have addressed Rank Rewards and they're a part of the year 4 roapmap.
---
Word.
---
You got me at "legion main".
---
I refuse to believe this and will always believe that they're all in a basement like in Sammination
---
I can assure you from playing both sides, that people do not want to play against forever freddies, 3 gen docs, prayer bead spirits, iri-head huntress's, and finally, moon walking and infinite mend legions.
---
Game is not balanced and that is why they DC, cause shit ain't fun my dude.
---
Impossible. Having connection issues and unplugging cable = Lost Connection to Servers.

I wish they just made it so that his already garbage power doesn‚Äôt immediately cancel when missing an attack. Why does he have such a harsh penalty for this? Imagine if Tier 3 Myers automatically went down to tier 2 for missing an attack. It doesn‚Äôt even make sense since his power is already non lethal anyway.
---
can we stop with these console plebian clips? i feel like you guys post everything you do. trash 360s against a console killer and your 4 percents to a escape aint so rare. stop!
---
I mean they've been right about all of the leaks that aren't speculation tags. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
all youtubers do is break the pallet on these unmindgameable places because they cant do anything other than break the pallet and the infinites they leave the survivor so even seeing them not being able to do a thing shows something
---
At purple ranks and better, you will almost never see anyone cleanse. Without cleansing, her power does nothing once everyone becomes broken. At that point she becomes a 4.6m/s (115%) speed m1 killer. From there you have to rely on looping skills to stall the game. Because nobody can heal, everybody not in a chase should be cranking out gens ASAP.
---
That sucks, i just got one of their new skins but i'll keep trying to play them
---
Is it only when you get to high ranking killer that it starts to get stressful? I'm good enough to get a handful of 4ks on a given night but I don't play often enough to climb the ladder
---
You are a crazy person if you think DS or styptic agent are stronger now than they were. Old DS had no activation conditions and was useful every round. Old styptic was universally better then the new one except in the very specific situation of using it to tank an exposed hit on purpose.
---
I'm actually happy about it. Probably a new main of mine depending on the design, idk why would anyone be upset, was kinda obvious since.. you know.. was about yamaoka bloodline that we would've got an asian survivor
---
Both sides and you only mention killer ones, nice bias there.
---
I recognize the council has made a decision, but given it's a stupid ass decision, I've elected instead to believe in the Slashbucks cafe where they all meet on Tuesdays.
---
Happened the other day. I had a Spirit daily and I knew I would have some disconnects so I used BPS. I used my power ONCE, and they DCed.
---
Samination be like: "Hold my drawing tablet."
---
Looks like it‚Äôs going to start taking longer to get into matches of DBD lmao. Leaks say the penalty is longer times to load into a match or something like that
---
Iron maiden baby
---
2v8 would be sick though
---
&gt; piss poor grammar 
---
&gt; samething
---
*curb your enthusiasm song begins to play*
---
It's usually 2 weeks.
---
Feelsbad cause the servers are too aids to keep me connected half the time
---
So you are just virtue signaling for karma? lol
---
Myers will never have a shirtless cosmetic because he's a licensed character and there are no scenes with him naked.
---
If the ptb is this week or next it'll be out on the 3rdh or 10th
---
Leaks are saying ptb tomorrow
---
It's me! It's your neighbour! - When a survivor enters your radius, they will see your aura and the killer will see theirs.
---
I dont think you get punished for that.
---
back to dead hard i guess zzzz
---
And yet those things are not leaks?
---
It's datamining.
---
Datamining is not leaking.
---
and are we just pretending the Pennywise 'leaks' aren't a thing? 
---
They don't leak they just datamine.
---
Dont give r/dbdgonewild any ideas pls
---
I personally can‚Äôt stand the ambient sound of Hawkins. I‚Äôll play a match or two over the course of a night but if I get it too often I‚Äôll dc
---
I guess the devs saw plenty of possibilities with cosmetics for the Spirit but felt it would look better for survivors so they made Yui
---
Bro I remembered first ama they held since release, it was as shallow as this one. Hints guesses distracting words and so forth
---
You should be streaming, man!!! WTF!!
---
They just regret legion and want everyone to stop playing them lol
---
&gt; there are no scenes with him naked.
---
1) shirtless isn‚Äôt naked
---
2) you haven‚Äôt read the hentai I have
---
2 stranger things was 2 weeks after the ptb started.
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt view the entire image lmao. I wasn‚Äôt really sure what the image was talking about but I misread comments and thought they were changing all of those perks for some reason. I knew they were changing Balanced Landing
---
Hawkins isn‚Äôt a true infinite, the Haddonfield one is the only true infinite and it‚Äôs due to bad map design.
---
What happened to being civil? God damn internet buffer is ruining people
---
Please say sike right now.
---
STBFL was the only thing making my Legion viable and now I won't be able to stack with FF?
---
It would, unless they make it so you need to physically press leave game to get a ban. If thats the case then people will just altf4.
---
Okay then, survivors don't want to play against these killers, and killers don't want to play against 4 man swfs all with commodius toolboxes with socket swivels and instructions.
---
Remember when MoM came right out? yeah that was a fuckin great time wasn't it? remember old DS when you had to dribble? remember the original DS when you got a free skill check to escape, even if you weren't the obsession?
---
Holy shit I see this happen so many times, like wtf think what you are doing.
---
Who's upset???
---
My god... "dictate, dictate, dictate..." do you even know what that means? 
---
You CLEARLY don't play survivor for a long time, dude. Stop trying to pretend it. Yeah, "crybaby survivors" can't tell Killers how to play the game, but there ARE many bad attitudes from Killer players that would be nice to avoid. Camping and tunneling are some of them, as well as there are many bad attitudes from Survivor players. I'm not repeating myself a billion times for you.
---
the 19th element on the periodic table of elements
---
Disappointed, but not surprised tbh
---
Your submission to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
* submissions from new accounts are not allowed in /r/deadbydaylight, due to scam bots. 
---
Are the skins and cosmetics from the rift exclusive (only available while the rift is open, and impossible to get once it has closed) or will they be available for purchase forever?
---
I think new players go up against enough insidious basement bubbas as it is, let's not crush their soul even more. They don't know yet to just let the person die and complete all the gens while the lil baby killer stares at a wall.
---
Well I feel sheepish. 
---
I didn‚Äôt know BL reduced your stagger for the entire game. I thought it was only when you were able to activate the sprint part. 
---
I‚Äôve been missing out.
---
I played a Ghostface game at lower ranks. I like to play like how a Ghostface would act in the Scream on purpose (being ‚Äúclumsy‚Äù an such), but still managing to get the down. Back to the story. I was playing my Scream role, and the survivors were kinda bipolar when it came to smart/dumb decisions. *Perfect, I can give them and myself the proper Slasher experience. It‚Äôs like Scream except in a snowy resort* I thought to myself. Now, I had brought an ebony mori with me, and as you may have guessed by now, I like to role play these types of things. So I did different one-liners in the Ghostface voice when I got the mori, even if the first one was a simple ‚ÄúSay Cheese.‚Äù Doing this type of stuff with KYF with voice chat between the group is so fun. 
---
^I ^love ^this ^game, ^even ^with ^it‚Äôs ^problems
---
I have amazing bandwidth, upload, ping you name it and my internet wouldn't affect my FPS. You don't seem to know the difference between FPS and lag. You're thinking I have internet problems which has nothing to do with FPS in this game. The game runs at very poor FRAMES PER SECOND. There are multiple videos on youtube about how bad the frame rate is. It averages 25 fps in docked and drops to the low 20s and the teens very often. I actually never saw it hit 30 fps except when they looked at the ground. Looking anywhere in the level chugs the fps hard.
---
survivors will either slowly walk or use fixated which means 1 less second chance perk. seems good
---
At this point I think the entity just got into anime and is stealing all these Japanese people to turn it's trials into its own wacky isekai
---
He was nerfed because he was a living exploit
---
Your turn looks faster on the killers screen
---
Sigh them nerfing Legion again is the stupidest thing they‚Äôve done in a while
---
Scary movie 7
---
Does anybody know where they are holding the lost Adam francis cosmetics at so I can raid that vault.
---
Nope, the automated bot removed it since it was under the no cross posting filter to lower spam :)
---
And frankly I had no idea an AMA was even happening so thankfully someone made a thread about it so I could sticky it in the first place
---
My headcannon is that Leatherface is the cannibal in her lore.
---
Nobody. This post is inflammatory.
---
Dude they just leaked the entire ch 14 notes without data mine are you somehow missing all of the posts?
---
Shit u right. He has more experience
---
Joey didn't care, he was basically a mindless enforcer of Frank's will and Susie flat out refused to willingly take part (Frank physically forced her to do it). 
---
Julie did get peer pressured though.
---
I enjoy this very much
---
New Demogorgon skin when
---
All the portals are transformed into couches
---
Bubba mains rise up
---
Hopefully not
---
Can you stop being a lil bitch?? Let people be proud of what they do, instead of tryna shit on everyone's parade like a douche.
---
Oh yay...buggy ass Dead Hard is gonna be the norm
---
Legit why i stopped playing killer as much i used to. 2 months ago i had both surv and killer at rank 2 but now i play 15 survivor games for every killer game because if im doing badly as a survivor, im likely only stuck that game for 5 minutes before i get killed so i can look for a better game but if im getting bullied as killer, im stuck in the game until all gens are done
---
Where can I read the changes?
---
Freddy is alone for Rin and the legion‚Äôs safety*
---
Ya the reduced stagger duration from falls was passive and would always happen, but when landing from a fall while not Exhausted, you would gain Haste for **3 seconds**.
---
From the leaked Patch Notes it's looking like it will all be based on the perk activating and nothing will be passive anymore.
---
With the new patch there will be a new punishment feature for dcs
---
Hawkins is the worst map in the game tbh, it sucks for me so much since i main huntress/billy and survivor.
---
Legion:
---
bhvr: sorry did you say nerf
---
Sorry they're doing this to you. :(
---
The devs have indicated that the Rift cosmetics will be available for purchase at least 6 months after the Rift closes.
---
???? 
---
Kill a perk or rework a shitty Map
---
Hmmm...
---
You keep saying implication.... are these survivors in danger?
---
I admit I only frequent that sub's brother, r/dbdgonegay. But damn it, that's one scary sub. 
---
I was kidding when I said that r/dbdgonegay is the more wholesome porn sub but it looks like it's true. At least there are no scary-looking monstrosities in that sub.
---
That last one won't ever happen, Matheiu already explicitly confirmed it.
---
Because that is literally the only thing Legion can do. 
---
You can injure everyone around the map, which is pretty nice, but since you are switching targets, those people can keep mending quickly anyway, now evn faster. And if you actually WANT to commit to the chase, you first get a 4s stun before you can actually do anything to the survivor you just applied Deep Wound to. 
---
So great, you manage to tickle someone, and before you can actuall get to them and pressure them, they get a free 4s head start and you basically become an M1 killer with NO power. Fun. Killers liky Hillbilly manage to find survivors in a tought spot, they are downed instantly. Legion? You always give the survivor a head start to the nearest loop.
---
That is the sad part. Devs did nothing to actually fix the problems Legions are having, and are trying to buff the part of it where he has no problems.
---
There are literally like only 4 or 5 god pallets and the rest are shit
---
Pretty much
---
wraith is next on their list
---
Reddit mods are about as dumb as I'd expect them to be.
---
So you refuse to believe in the inside connection even if the ptb drops and the notes are accurate?
---
Wait do you think that‚Äôs why Fallout 76 had no npcs? They forgot how to code them in 
---
No because if the PTB drops and the notes are accurate it literally proves my point?
---
I laughed harder than I should have at this! Thanks, OP!
---
And yet they let 5 blink omega nurse run around for damn near 3 years. He‚Äôs still an M1 killer. I‚Äôve never understood why people think he‚Äôs so powerful.
---
what the fuck
---
You gotta relax bro. I said he‚Äôs not op. I just said usually the legions only use his power as a free injure and keep chasing me. Lol
---
3 repairs for the dark sense had to be over the course of one game, in most of which I was found first and had to run the killer the entire game. 10 heals had to be full states so if they started to use self care or a medkit before I could get to them then I didn't get the full value of the heal. Same if someone had started to heal them off hook. Not to mention how often I went up against Plague or Myers. Other players would get to the heals before me on big maps, or like with the repairs I'd be chased the entire game and couldn't do anything.
---
Won't it be so much fun getting Exhausted as you twitch on the ground, Claudette?
---
I believe Otz‚Äôs second newest video, about the various DCs he gets when playing killer.
---
because the game is dumb
---
At that point, you just ignore that survivor unless the opportunity comes up to down them with ease.
---
Stop I can only get so erect
---
Too much Nostalgia hellpp
---
So now the couple perks that actually fucking made him good ARE FUCKING USELESS FUCK YOU BHVR
---
If they remove them I want my shards back. I think I only did it because my friend dared me to and I said ‚Äúfuck it.‚Äù I also bought a Julie‚Äôs November Days mask, so I want them shards back too
---
Sounds like you don‚Äôt play much survivor. You won‚Äôt pip if all you do is save and nothing else.
---
So a power who cannot down a survivor
---
People, me included, don't even bother to heal against legion. Now that even mending takes less time, he's worse than bubba
---
Idk what's your point
---
You are all talking about something I don't know lol can you calm down
---
He already was /b/
---
And his pin addons (Which were already bad) only take affect on those affected by killer instinct.
---
I'm just gonna copy my comment from the leak thread:
---
So people think Legion are nerfed because they can't use Sloppy Butcher (implying good survivors are healing) or STBFL (implying this perk somehow helps outside of hook bombing/rescue rushing).
---
Literally, what makes Legion have any power, is buffed. Good survivors would delay his power a lot to the point where you could maybe even miss a hit let alone run to another person. The base speed increases + the addon duration buff is great and the pins, which are even better if you bounce, as you should, are interesting.
---
Use your power people. Or are we gonna put Plague in A tier because she is Thanatophobia bait but Legion sucks in F for doing the same. Imagine using STBFL to deny your own power.
---
And stop thinking otz is a pro, he is a streamer. STBFL is not actually a god given gift which makes killers good. Let's not pretend it's a meta. Unless you are Nurse and Spirit you will be looped.
---
&gt;Yeah thats a pretty shit description because balanced landing doesn't "become active" at all.
---
Well since new Balanced Landing will only give all the affects at a single time, wouldn't it make more sense for it to become active?
---
&gt;reduce your stagger duration from falls by 75 % and noise by 100%
---
While that's technically right, it's very messy and not very specific. The way you wrote this isn't even that different between my version except yours can be easily misinterpreted.
---
&gt;begin sprinting at 150 % of your normal running speed...
---
What's the point of writing this all out when just saying "gain Haste" is not only the same thing with less words, but it's using the actual in-game language.
---
IM FUCKING HAVING A STROKE
---
Thanks, I thought of another too
---
Suicide is badass - when on struggle stage avoiding to struggle gives you a 12/14/16% chance of escaping the hook instead of dying.
---
I would say maybe try survivor for a bit. It's true, change it up, maybe you are just tired. Maybe play something else for a week. I hear Civ is nice.
---
i keep hearing that the pins are worse now, honestly i find them alot better
---
If this were on console that first swing probably would‚Äôve hit ngl
---
Frenzy is good for getting the first hit in. The only time you should ever really run around and stab everyone is if everyone is basically clustered together. Using the power efficiently is:
---
&gt;Frenzy to engage
---
&gt;Hit the survivor
---
&gt;Chase after said survivor in order to negate their speed boost
---
&gt;Cancel power on top of survivor
---
&gt;Close the gap and down the survivor
---
The last steps are iffy because you could just get looped at a pallet or a jungle gym, but like I said, Frenzy is good for engaging because you it can pretty much negate loops.
---
Fixated not having the injured restriction would actually make it usable. I seriously hope that gets changed.
---
Demogorgon just needs new teachables, they all suck and the ideas are super lame. I cant even imagine how annoying Cruel Limits would be if it was viable.
---
I can hear the lullaby in this picture
---
Those aren‚Äôt the only killers that need changes either.
---
Yeah I just hit that but I won because I brought a ebony mori
---
Instead of fixing broken maps just nerf a perk, such a behavior way of doing things. I would have rather them take away the sprint burst and keep the stagger reduction myself.
---
They can't just exploit into unreleased steam db patches though. If they could why would only leaksbydaylight do it? Why wouldn't the news get out by people other than them?
---
Had that happen a couple of weeks ago in this exact spot.
---
So you haven't played for months and just saying "he's a walking exploit" for no reason? Wow.. you're that stupid?
---
The changes I'm talking about are old! You just came here saying he's a walking exploit based on what exactly since every single thing you said has been fixed so freaking long ago, before even stranger things dlc came out
---
I guess I'm stupid that I bought Legion a week ago
---
Bro thats not small at all, i think that it is the standard-size. 
---
I‚Äôll tell you what, its currently late in Sweden. When i wake up at 6 tomorrow i‚Äôll send you my engine.ini. It might change your game-settins to mine but you can change it back in-game. Hopfully that will help.
---
If that doesn‚Äôt work then i don‚Äôt know what will. 
---
Try to reinstall if it‚Äôs bothering you (deactivate steam cloud before) 
---
I‚Äôll send my enigine.ini tomorrow to you.
---
BOIIIIIIIIII
---
The point was pretty clear. He was able to stack too easily and he can still waste a lot of survivor time while receiving a down for his chase. BHVR agrees. It‚Äôs an adjustment. Get over it.
---
sure thing bud
---
So it didn‚Äôt count one of the golds?
---
"Their".
---
Good job.
---
Reddit be bugging lol, also I don‚Äôt doubt that PC 360s are a million times better than console ones, but everyone is making it seem like they‚Äôre downright impossible which is definitely not the case. also camera sensitivity definitely helps with better 360s, do you move your left analog stick left or right and rotate the other one in the opposite direction?
---
&gt; They can't just exploit into unreleased steam db patches though.
---
[and yet they can?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6Tq0Ajy0as&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
There are more than 1 reason for a survivor to DC from a game though, not just the entitlement of survivors, but also the bullshit of the game in general, like hitboxes, bullshit addons, exploit abuse ect.
---
I know there was a fuck ton of DCs back in dec 2018 with original legion because it was broken, same as the dcs with spirit now, because it isn't fun to play against it.
---
76 is still using the same piece of shit engine since 2011, recycled and rehashed to no end. I‚Äôm surprised they even got dialogue working.
---
Hot Fuzz is the best movie ever
---
"They".
---
This is how AMAs work. Bet that they had a couple alt accounts ready to ask the questions that got those le quirky and wacky responses
---
The perk would be absolute trash without the Haste affect, and the only time the reduced stagger duration did anything outside when gaining Haste was when it was being abused on Lampkin Lane.
---
I actually think this nerf is fine, especially since it got another additional affect too.
---
&gt; hat's the point of writing this all out when just saying "gain Haste" is not only the same thing with less words, but it's using the actual in-game language.
---
Because thats the literal ingame description for BL and sprint burst.
---
&gt;When starting to run, break into a sprint at 150 % your normal running speed for a maximum of 3 seconds
---
&gt; upon landing, start sprinting at 150 % of your normal running speed for a maximum of 3 seconds if not exhausted. 
---
An exhaustion perk doesn't "become active" unless its head on which has a specific activation trigger
---
But it is. The cosmetics were in response of the devs pairing those two.
---
The Spirit and Plague are both 100% innocent but Nurse and Wraith both killed tens of people. 
---
The Wraith didn't do it willingly but he did kill the manager by his own choice, even though he was justified. 
---
The Nurse killed at least 50 people willingly, so she definitely deserves to be in the Entities plane.
---
I started gen rushing lol
---
Supply and demand. As long as we're willing to pay , the more killers coming our way.
---
Once you hit red ranks you need to get at.least 9 points to just not depip. Pipping requires getting 3 gold and 1 iridescent (or a variant of that many points). 
---
It's not super easy to rank up as survivor. I agree it's probably easier than killer, but I think you're exaggerating it quite a bit.
---
EXPLANATION:
---
Along side the wonderful and long awaited DC penalty system for excessive DC'ing we get more Legion nerfs! Turns out they didn't plan to stop at just piggy!
---
Once again Legion got a pathetic compensation: Movement speed, this time in Frenzy. Similar to his previous change, along side this pathetic .2% increase it is accompanied by a bunch of unnecessary nerfs.
---
The nerfs are the following:
---
A base mending time nerf (mending time reduced to 8 seconds from 12 seconds)
---
A mending add-on nerf (Filthy blade reduced from 3.5 to 2.5 seconds of extra mending)
---
A few extremely minor nerfs to add-ons 
---
Then we get to the biggest nerf of all, and this one will really hit the already barely viable killer hard: They are taking legions ability to stack STBFL.
---
The buffs in compensation:
---
A decrease in window vaulting speed in frenzy (down to 0.9 seconds from 1.1)
---
A decrease in pallet speed (down to 0.9 seconds from 1.35)
---
Increased 
---
A few extremely minor buffs to add-ons
---
An increase in base frenzy speed (up 5.2 m/s from 5.0 m/s) Admittedly I have no idea the exact percentage this would be equivalent to, I just know that is is a very insignificant increase. 
---
I don't even know why I expected a fix. Or hell, anything even resembling one. They didn't fix his 3 unusable purple add-ons and to really throw the cherry on top they made one of Legions best perk synergy's obsolete. It was already miserable enough playing with a 4 second stun, now I have to unequip the only perk that made my character slightly viable. Before I get screeched at about believing old legion was good for the game, I agree that old Legion was toxic for the game as I was one of the advocates for change. But I was advocating that they change the toxic elements, while hoping to keep the fast pace gameplay Legion once had. Legion was my favorite thematically because he was designed to sell the idea that anyone could be a murderer. But my favorite killer wasn't fixed or ruined, they were always terrible and now its looking like they always will be. GG DBD devs.
---
I dead ass learned nothing from the tutorial.
---
I had a close friend give me a general run down of the game and I played a game as a survivor and a game as a killer on their computer and with basic tips from him made me learn more about the game than the tutorial.
---
It's clearly a joke lol
---
I‚Äôd be extremely shocked if the ptb was tomorrow. Seems very early
---
I am not angry or anything, or saying Legion is OP. Just explaining that they cannot really do much with their power, and why that is.
---
I know it sucks man. Try getting a friend or find someone on the Xbox or PSN communities. This game becomes so much better when you play with someone.
---
Honestly, how has Danny Devito never started in a Horror movie?
---
hmmm.  Is there a red devil ghostface in any Scream scenes, or either of his red/blue costumes?
---
If there were more slug races, there‚Äôd be less unbreakables.
---
I'm still holding on hope. My build doesn't have stbfl sloppy or any perks like that so it doesn't hurt me that bad. But that add on Netflix is kinda concerning.
---
Dear God, please don't let that become a common bug...
---
Isn‚Äôt there also a Carlton one?
---
I wish we could run macros on console, literally just for struggle phase though tbh
---
Maybe there are pocket dimensions where killers and survivors can stay in.
---
Yeah, now they nerfed mending. 12 seconds. 
---
It‚Äôs a slight slowdown, wew big deal. Doesn‚Äôt help him in chase, doesn‚Äôt help him down a survivor, it just adds slowdown. 
---
Are you going to attack an injured survivor with FF for the purpose of adding a slow down? If so, I can understand why you‚Äôre all for this nerf because you either have never played Legion or are the worst Legion in the game! 
---
Again, STBFL helped him in post-frenzy chases. It was a very good perk for him for a REASON.
---
I thought she was Korean? I could care less personally. Even if BHVR does listen and change the new survivor then they're still are  going to play as Claudette anyways. Let's be honest here.
---
The Ghostface is game is the liecensed costume not the killer from the movies
---
Well maybe that should change. It would make more sense if all Haste perks just were becoming active, because then Exhausted would just mean it's preventing specific perks from becoming active.
---
And yes I know other Haste perks say that line, but they all should just say gain Haste, because it's the **same thing** but with less words.
---
Enjoy your hour long queues soon enough. How much more can you cry to the devs to make the game even easier for you?
---
AYO DIS SHADOWLANDS DAEMON LOOKIN' FOR BEANS
---
Yes you can report them, no BHVR will not ban them/suspend them. DCing for any reason for the most part isn‚Äôt bannable. Killers DC in this game all the time so you might as well get used to it now.
---
And yet the also nuked him on all other fronts to get this pathetic 0.2 meter buff
---
Look how they massacred my boy
---
Is this true, can you link it?
---
there is a link like - right below
---
Well they couldn't have been gen rushing.  I'm guessing they just kept unhooking each other right next to you over and over.
---
First, grow up. You are insulting random people for no reason.
---
Second, I play every day. And there are always posts in reddit complaining about the Legion nerfs and I explained why he was nerfed. Then I entered in Leaksbydaylight and I read what happened to him. I just thought he was the random guy who asked how was Legion before the changes.
---
Learn manners
---
Welp, the game and hawkins lab just became even more killer favored.
---
Congrats, you just learned how to grow up.
---
I‚Äôm honestly not sure what exhaustion perk I‚Äôll use now. Kind of wanna go back to DH but the servers aren‚Äôt kind to it.
---
What platform do you play on ?
---
Yeah like devito
---
For f\*ck sake this is golden, loved the edit&lt;3
---
I only bought him with shards for the sake of having all the killers. I already want them back.
---
They not nerfing legion, they gonna buff him...
---
I'm betting Kimura is gonna be that girl Adam tried saving before the Entity chucked him into his realm.
---
Are you saying bill hader isn't hot?
---
**no homo but-**
---
That REASON being that it was too ezpz for him to get those decreased cooldowns, and therefore the REASON it‚Äôs no longer going to count when in FF.
---
Not all but some which features duo of survivors or killers usually are.
---
I used her to climb super hard, and before the reset I don't think I did worse than three sacs in a game for a solid 10 games.
---
I don't even have 'meta' perks on her, things like MnA, STBFL, MYC, and Nurses Calling are all off the table, so I ran Ruin, Haunted Grounds, Iron Grasp, and Pop.
---
However for a long time, I was trying to get Bubba to 35 for BBQ, for other killers, and I only played Hag, at level one with Ruin, and still did great.
---
Shes so much fun, but so easy to play poorly, and its like something just clicks, and you just start rolling over people.
---
....Ghostface mains are laughing then. I love love luv playing as GF on that map. 4k all the way.
---
Becouse the killer didn't DC. It could be 2 things:
---
1) Your internet stopped working for some resons long enough for the game to DC you.
---
2) (Console only since PC has Dedicated Servers now)The killer used a lag switch to force DC all the survivors. It is bannable in any Peer to Peer game, this included
---
Bruh why did you watermark this
---
Ok let's Nerf bubba next, or maybe wraith. They still be able to make survivor waste too much time with an insta down and with a guaranteed hit respectively
---
Maybe we can also Nerf trapper, it's not fair I have to waste time to get out of his trap and spend my precious time on that, right?
---
Do you see how your logic is flawed or you need a drawing?
---
Because I'm dumb and I never run balanced landing, what is stagger reduction?
---
So do survivors. It's a massive problem on both sides.
---
Duh the basement .Welcome to the hookers.(samination anyone?)
---
salty boy
---
Ps4/pc
---
wasn't Frank with Julie?
---
Cuz I can
---
What I meant was that I don‚Äôt care who we get, I just want a hot guy
---
I would welcome bill with open arms ;)
---
Its the downtime between running and getting the OOMPH while falling - basicly it was 75% before the nerf meaning you had less stagger then killers even while exhausted
---
I'll be your julie.
---
All my friends are playing some battle royale and im playing main survivor being tunneld losing all my sanity with some claudettes. This post hurts me badly
---
Until you dead hard in place and still get exhausted.
---
Y'all laugh about this but I was in a match where a No Mither David cleansed against The Plague.
---
Maybe he didn't wanted to have his vision dirty, idk.
---
No more chainsaw for bubba the rank 20 says that he is to op
---
Yes please, I need it so badly
---
Large car mechanic stares at people so he can walk faster
---
Apparently they posted about it on their Twitter (deadbyBHVR). But hey can't fault you there, I found out about it from a streamer.
---
I was mad at first, but right now I'm just sad.
---
God, Prime-Time SWF smurfs are the definition of toxic.
---
They are cocky asswipes who think they are Gods but really they are just playing against me after Rank-Reset playing a killer I am not good at so I can get my daily.
---
I find this out as it's getting nerfed, rip
---
Yeah, Legion getting those stacks ezpz was the point, because STBFL is a really good perk on him. It's a good thing because he needs more help in chases - He's an M1 killer and has no helpful power once everybody is injured. Thus, allowing him easier access to a nice little boost to help him in chase is a good thing.
---
true
---
I love the game as survivor. So many strong pallets
---
Lithe is good
---
On console, what do you do as killer when you have a group of survivors bully you? Since challenges came out, I have basically every other group, looping me to every palette or 360 spinning while I try to swing every single time. Basically making it unplayable and not fun. 
---
I‚Äôm at the point where it seems survivors only want to troll me or use the game mechanics against me. 
---
So what do I do? Just disconnect? Seems like all SWF people do are play nasty. I guess I could sandbag my rank? Idk I‚Äôm out of ideas.
---
4 or 5 god pallets? I don‚Äôt even know of one god pallet on the map.
---

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dybfm0/just_tried_to_do_the_crow_challenge_from_the/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
If I get 360ed twice, I wait before my third swing for them to spin so I can hit them once they finish and can‚Äôt do it again just yet. Also, lunge attacks have less auto-aim then normal attacks, so getting closer and pressing attack rather than holding can help.
---
Yeah,you are right. I play with multiple-friends both on ps4 and pc and its muche easier when you are swf,but most of the time i like to play solo,and get fucked
---
Yup I heard somewhere that BHVR needs to fix the reasons why survivors/killers are DCing (Bullshit hits, Facecamping/tunneling, spirit, annoying survivor perks) Banning people for DCing is a bad idea but by fixing the reasons why, it will considerably decrease the amount of DCs.
---
brb let me start to main doc
---
I agree it has a lot of safe pallets, but the small size and verticality make if really easy to pressure survivors off gens
---
Civ? Havent heard of it. What is it?
---
Seriously. If they even just let us play with the killer of our choice- even if the survivors just stood there or walked back and forth on a pre-determined path- it would go SO FAR to make the tutorial actually useful. Right now, the only purpose it serves is to give you an easy 50k bloodpoints the first time you do it.
---
If they fix the map but leave the perk, the perk can potentially be broken on any other map it becomes usable on.
---
Fixing balanced landing like this means they can add a ledge to the Coldwind farm house to allow people to not get bodyblocked in, while not also creating Haddonfield 2.0.
---
Dedicated servers make some of these super ass too.
---
I have to pallet stun twice in one game. I don't play survivor, and I am against Purple ranks after reset who know I am going to try to stun.
---
Cause they're running towards me while im doing a gen, i cant tell if they're in a chase or not till its too late
---
That's fair. I'm just seeing alot of spite from survivors about DC punishments being handed out. None of the killers I play are broken or even high tier yet you still get multiple DC's daily. It's about time people face the music.
---
Theres not much you‚Äôre missing out on.
---
It should be just for fun dude
---
They said it in the halloween dev stream
---
https://youtu.be/dmFyEKu2CWc
---
Not sure of the timestamp, but it's there
---
Cleanse as a group. If everyone cleanses and hides, she can't possibly down all of you.
---
The problem is that most players will cleanse first and think of the team later - that's when you all get downed, because she's one-shotting people from decent range with wide spread.
---
&gt; *Corrupt Purge is basically the most unfun thing in the game right now*
---
Ohhh, I'm pretty certain that there's far worse out there. Plague's playstyle is pretty predictable, when you know the cadence then there's no problems.
---
Huntress: *laughs in patch 3.4.0*
---
When someone posted the leak on r/leaksbydaylight lots of people said they didn‚Äôt want ‚Äúanother feng min‚Äù and that they wanted an Asian guy
---
That really only happens when I use it to dodge a hit. If you are playing ‚Äúoptimally‚Äù then you just run loops really greedily and then dont get punished for it because you dead hard for distance to a window or pallet to start the process all over again. It gets really boring after awhile, like its way too effective. 
---
This is why I hate when they nerf perks. All it really does is just reinforce the meta and make the game more stale. Seriously when would you ever take Balanced Landing over dead hard after this change? Theres already a ‚Äúrisk‚Äù of the perk being really useless without a map offering.
---
I would rather have Balanced Landing be completely changed. Make it not an exhaustion perk anymore and it will remove the stagger penalty from falling, muffles the sound from falling and once every 50 seconds removes your scratches after falling for 3/4/5 seconds. Sort of like a Dance With Me effect.
---
I love love to see this theory, as Adam has little love right now lore-wise.
---
I mean it gets rid of the Haddonfield bullshit, and nerfs Harvester.
---
100% fine with me being a killer main.
---
Oh the skins, endless possibilities
---
Canceling Frenzy after they get speed boost does not give the survivor the same distance if you cancel Frenzy right when you hit them to begin with
---
The snap and then the nea scream, delicious
---
Well I guess waiting out 4 minutes won't be so bad right? You can just hold sprint so you can't get healed and bleed out and the killer gets an ez depip /s
---
I am being sarcastic about doing that, but people probably will do it so.
---
yea, and here I thought killers were upset at how common Dead Hard for distance was becoming, now it's the only exhaustion perk that's going to be worth running with the only other meta exhaustion perk minus Adrenaline getting destroyed.
---
How do they have teachables if they never interact
---
Ah. Gotcha. Thank you! I didn't read the comments. I'm excited for her!
---
No, it's nerf or nothing -BHVR
---
the only thing nerfed is the deepwound mending speed and perk stacking. yes that‚Äôs massive but the other changes don‚Äôt make this a nerf in all
---
Dead hard for distance and you wont get bugged. You‚Äôll add another 30+ seconds to your chase for nothing too. *Really* fun
---
No wonder they‚Äôre so angry all the time
---
It progresses when u leave post game screen
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
What's up with the legion changes?
---
Wonder how the meta of 2 v 8 would work. I imagine both killers go after the same survivor ending chases in 5 seconds. Gens would go quick but maybe the almost insta downs would compensate.
---
Doc skillchecks aren't that bad
---
He's not been buffed, people have just been watching Otz, Otzdarva for short
---
Is there still no release date for DBD mobile?
---
That's why you deleted your comment?
---
Yes, dishonest to make an excuse for your stupid points. I'd rather be considered the classic arrogant guy on the internet than the dishonest one
---
You listed problems he had months ago just to be able to say those Nerf are justified, which is bs.
---
I guess I'm wasting way too much time with a dishonest person like you who don't even play the game. I don't believe you do if you list problems that has been fixed so long ago, I won't buy that
---
Just run the killer around the 4 safe pallets on/above the bathroom for 2 minutes.
---
I feel like your stressed for 5 minutes, then if the game is going well it‚Äôs cool, but if not it continues.
---
is it a killer challenge?
---
Nobody‚Äôs trying to insult you, just saying it was worded badly
---
Shirtless Susie when?
---
&gt;I can't be asked posting this everywhere
---
Good, at least there will be less people who will have their time wasted reading your garbage analysis.
---
I left but it was still at 2/20
---
That‚Äôs really cool, well done!
---
Shirtless Myers because he's a licensed killer, and Huntress well for obvious reasons
---
Play it on PC then where you will never lag.
---
My game doesn't lag *shock therapy laughs hysterically*
---
Wait that's not how it go- *falls*
---
That goes for me on both sides of survivor and killer lol
---
except lithe is the second best exhaustion perk
---
I'm afraid it would just give my wife ideas lol.
---
Shirtless hag please
---
titty mori
---
Take a break and play different games, the urge to play DBD will come back at some point
---
I play on ps4 too.  My psn is the same as on here.  Hit me up and we can play sometime.  I‚Äôm always trying to find good people to play with. You have a mic by chance?
---
its a technicolor
---
I deleted the comment because it was incorrect. And I repeat DISHONEST means someone who lies for his own benefit, which benefit I have to lie, on reddit, about a character of a videogame? You don't even know what dishonest means. You are obsessed or just trolling. Oh, I didn't even lie, because he was actually nerfed for these reasons, just a long time ago
---
It's a universal challenge
---
What the frick is that ? Pardon my ignorance
---
Wasting the 4 strongest pallets in 2 minutes is kind of a dick move lol
---
It‚Äôs a shame though because Killers get to have stuff that can completely shift the outcome of the game (iri hatchets with the belt, tuft of hair, tampered timer + rules set no. 2/Amanda‚Äôs secret , ebony/ivory Mori (these especially), prayer beads, etc which you know if a bit of fun but I don‚Äôt understand why survs aren‚Äôt allowed to have that too. Outside of keys which barely actually get to be used anyway (unlike Morris and add ons which have a near guaranteed use) survs can‚Äôt have things without it being complained about. 
---
I‚Äôm all for the occasionally Mori stabby fun (newly found Ghostface main here, I was a Spirit main but I got bored)  but honestly I think it was fairer back when it went both ways.
---
Yeah I know what they are, I'm saying I think this guy's the only one with this problem. Or at least one of the few people with this.
---
After the first nerf I play one match with legion and say this is a piece of shit and never touch him again, with this changes nothing is going to change
---
*Laughs In Zappy Boi*
---
*laughs in shirtless david*
---
As a group which says nothing of individual playing habits.
---
About that do 3 gens in a match with dark sense survivor master challenge: Does it count when I do them with somebody else? Do I have to do them without letting go or can I come back later and continue or can I do a half here and a half there?
---
So far I couldn't do it bc I either went to help someone hanging or I was hunted myself and the others finished the gens. Any Tips? :(
---
There were 2 replies for my question and now they are gone as I was reading them ...? One was from one of the developers. I would love to read it -_-
---
pretty sure its implemented because when rank reset hit actual rank 15s would face red rank teams and get swatted hard so by adding this it takes away from a red rank team matching with a rank 15 killer
---
Why be angry at you when she can be angry at that fucking Claudette that left her to die even though the Jane was looping the killer.
---
&gt;!I love you Claude!&lt;
---
No please don't go, the fog needs u
---
Then how do they teach each other perks?
---
Yo, I get that you are a douche bag but it probably won't be ok. You will die alone.
---
Does every killer copy Pig‚Äôs animation when she starts crouching?
---
You don't own hag? I thought she was free with the game (I am a console player who got it when it was free last August with PS+ though so it came with Huntress, Hag, Nurse and Doctor.)
---
Only thing I'd recommend is trying to look at it from a team player point of view - you might die first a lot but if you can run the killer around long enough, your team can hopefully get other stuff done and you're helping that way. Oh and hope for Ruin to appear in the shrine of secrets soon I guess :(
---
The dude was hooked beside the hatch would you wander off if you were the killer? Lol great play I just dont blame him for hanging around
---
Not ok red ranks,usually there you face high tier killers.More like in purpule/green ranks on rank reset
---
Today Dr is teaching monitor and abuse perk.
---
What should my next artwork be?
---
What killer where you playing?
---
I'm just glad it's a female survivor....smaller hitbox
---
If only Hex Ruin existed.
---
I'll still main them. Hopefully speeding up the vault animations will make it less nauseating which is my main issue usually. I'm hoping they make further changes during the PTB.
---
Lmao but Monto always uses it with Jake
---
Poor Billy boii
---
Dude you are a riot, a regular salt mine.
---
boy do I have some good news for you
---
Keeps people injured and those people do gens while someone keeps an M1 killer busy the majority of the match by basic knowledge of looping. Even plague does a better job at keeping people injured.
---
Poor girl.  She looks so thin.  üòû
---
Worded poorly* 
---
‚ÄúWorded badly‚Äù isn‚Äôt proper grammar either lol
---
I dont care how many hours you have. Legions speed in frenzy wasnt the issue. Itd be a nice buff if that all they did but this is clearly a nerf. His slow down was severely hindered by reducing mend time and by not being able to use his power to apply sloppy butcher. He also cant decide to chase the same survivor he hit with frenzy to get more stacks of stbfl.
---
No perks work in frenzy now, meaning no sloppy butcher, no STBFL, no Franklins, no Remember me, no Third Seal, no nothing. BHVR really told legion to eat a dick.
---
Wow, you dropped your strawman and picked up an ad hominem along the way. How nasty.   
---
Everyone wants a fun game, and for that there has to be balance. Yes, even in an asymmetric game, balance must exist.   
---
It's easy for someone to sit there and say "well if people don't like the product as is, then there's a problem with the people." instead of realizing that just MAYBE there's a problem with THE GAME. It's especially easy when that particular aspect of the game is a part you enjoy, specifically because it gives you an unfair advantage that you know you don't deserve deep down, but are unable to openly admit it.   
---
Any other fallacies you got for me?
---
BNP?
---
Is it weird I never read her lore but automatically knew she was russian from hearing her getting mad a
---
over pallets?
---
yeah the wording is terrible. Should really be more along the lines of:
---
&gt;causes generators to explode, which instantly causes 8% regression
---
Who here decided to insult someone based on an opinion? Ya you are a douche bag and a loser. I'm blocking you now before your autism starts to effect me.
---
Iridescent Pin only works during Feral Frenzy
---
The way DD works on legion is you get the knowledge of the entire team through Killer Instinct and of course theyre injured so you kill them one by one after triggering DD
---
Clam slamming forever
---
Yeah she does w infection so by your theory she is trash to? If no one cleanses she is literally an m1 killer
---
it hs the occasional jump scare but its basically impossible to make a multiplayer game scary. i will say the game still makes me clench my cheeks still
---
Not sure how consistent that one is with the playerbase as a whole but I practice/follow it and generally have good results. I‚Äôve especially noticed it helping as a hooked survivor.
---
yikes saw it now  xD
---
Or while unhooking he gets the borrowed time effect so he cant be interrupted.
---
Well.. yes? Better them than me
---
I felt like a cat running from a really mad dog
---
I was talking about in that game, like in one game ill get 15 stabs total. Even then, the amount of stabs he gets is fully dependent on the survivors and the map you get.
---
Legions problem is his power IMO, i'm fine with him being a bit weak but fun to play as. The problem is that hes meant to be an anti heal tracking killer, and then be an M1 killer once everyone is injured. The problem is that he is absolute trash at actually injuring all survivors.
---
Oh its a TV made from France (Before the company was called Thompson)
---
And yet Frank‚Äôs and Stab Wound Study are STILL garbage.
---
They already answered questions about lost legacy cosmetics. Check the last dev update.
---
Are you sure about this? I read somewhere about a year ago this feature was never hooked up to anything on console and that the in game reports do nothing unless on pc. 
---
Asking because it‚Äôs extremely common for both killers and survivors to dc when the game isn‚Äôt going their way and it seems like nothing is ever done about it. Devs have even said it‚Äôs allowed if it‚Äôs not excessive.
---
Well the only reason Haddonfield had infinites was because of Balanced Landing so...
---
There's different types of colorblind, it would help those people a lot depending on which colors they can and can't see
---
This doesn't affect slowdown Legion too much, Frenzy chases seem like they'll feel better now with the faster vaults. I'm glad I've been saving up the pins as they actually seem decent now. By the looks of it the only thing "nerfed" on them is the time taken to mend, which can easily be rectified with slower heals. The actual use of the power seems buffed with the duration add-ons being better and the pins not being a meme anymore.
---
Though I'm totally going to try out Beast of Prey now to see old Legion come back.
---
Sally DID snap though
---
Wasn‚Äôt this fixed?
---
The point still stands, everyone read it as avoiding actual issues like The Plague
---
They only answered the softball questions.
---
Hahaha! How did you get on against the blendettes? lol
---
Just be happy with the fact that you're regressing instead of progressing where you'll have to deal with Spirits üòÇ
---
Definite cop next paycheck
---
Oh geeze, I didn't realize it was ultra rare too. Thats...really bad.
---
Oh god is this switch? You poor thing.
---
We need a killer that can be a survivor also fuck legion
---
*Bold yet required*
---
Gotta love when they nerf one of the worst killers in the game
---
Old old ds was definitely better than new ds but the iteration before its latest rework is what im talking about. And through a lot of testing i genuinely believe the purple insta is better now, being able to tank literally anything in the game while leaving up dead hard is absolutely insane.
---
The stagger reduction still works if you‚Äôre not exhausted, then she sprint burst kicks in.
---
It‚Äôs only when exhausted its removed.
---
Try reading next time.
---
Dude this is the internet and better yet the dbd subreddit. If you say something that stupid that heavily leans towards one side you‚Äôre gonna get fussed at just because you make yourself look like a toxic player who only plays one side.
---
I‚Äôd say Nurses cause without any additional heal slow to make best use of the time they spend, you‚Äôre not gonna get much use out of it. Also, when you phase you can‚Äôt see auras anyway and I limit perks with aura reading down to one anyway. 
---
Try something like thrilling tremors or Pop.
---
It's glitched not a skin lol  /s
---
Looks nice
---
Man, DbD lore is the least satisfying thing since burnt toast.
---
and yet nobody ever gave a shit about pig
---
It's still kinda scary to me, what with the fact Michael has ripped me a new one on more than one occasion, but we all gotta admit that *we are some horny bastards for shirtless survivors and killers. I myself am voting for shirtless Joey.*
---
The bloodweb appears in their dreams if I'm not mistaken, so most likely they wake up and know it.
---
Welp I wasted money on them fml
---
I‚Äòm scared
---
But that‚Äôs the thing.. most people actually understood what I meant. The people who were confused are in the minority by looking at the comments.
---
Okay but Entity. Solved. Every plot hole that ever could be is now solved, because the Entity, even the Entity's logic appearing F-tier.
---
Lmao read what you write before you post next time
---
Staged
---
Would love a freddys worth rework on legion.
---
Lol that was such a waste of time for your team but funny
---
My boyfriend and I are both active players. Can confirm that SWF has magically resolved the majority of our tiffs. 
---
It‚Äôs all about understanding and empathizing with the other person, actively making time for and memories with one another, and ~~always agreeing with each other‚Äôs salt~~ having each other‚Äôs back no matter what. 
---
Pro D.B.Duo Tip: 
---
Always run Borrowed Time when playing with your SO. There‚Äôs a reason I said ‚Äúmajority of our tiffs.‚Äù
---
it‚Äôll be okay dude, i suck too, but i never give up, i keep playing with my friends and that adds an upside to it. i used to not be able to 360 but now i can do it every once in awhile. just keep practicing.
---
Jesus, just remove all Killers' ability to walk and get it over with.
---
The best one is to wait rank reset and wait a few days so experienced players get back to their ranks.
---
I'd love for a killer and survivor connected directly to Vigo and Benedict Baker, although we're likely to be getting that with Tovariah Alchemist
---
Sorry, I made a mistake - the modifiers for faster blinding were all removed at the end of 2017.
---
This danny devito shit is old.
---
Then rework the map not the perk lol
---
I‚Äôm a legion main and I‚Äôm actually kinda excited for these changes. While the sloppy and STBFL changes kinda hurt, a killer shouldn‚Äôt have to rely on a specific perk to do well. I‚Äôm glad the pins are solid, and the movement speed increase is pretty cool.
---
Good Pig OP.
---
