I first read this as 'Mlem Street' and thought he should be holding Yoshis.

Every upvote this post gets layers the Spirit's screaming on top of itself.
---
Lol the person ended up editing his response to say that, before that it was unintelligible.
---
Of course it was a p3 Claudette 
---
Great map pressure, great control, great chase potential, limited counterplay, and great camping potential if your're into that sort of stuff. Why do't you think shes top?
---
Playstation reviews everything before banning, which ofc usually is messages and those they dont take lightly. Anything that can be deemed highly vulgar, racist, harassment ect will end with a ban and depending on the severity a perm ban-&gt; got someone perm banned for being probably the biggest racist ever and received like 5 messages from random people telling my to kill myself. 
---
I don't know what else I expected out of a P3 Claudette. Glad I got to punish them for their behavior though.
---
Nothing would feel better I imagine 
---
Facts, I’ve done some dumb shit and I’m rank 2 currently lol. Funny moments make these games so much more worth it where I don’t mind giving up a double pip
---
This is like at the end of the movie when the last person thinks they got away but then get got at the end. 
---
😂 you’re a joke 
---
Yikes dude 
---
Nice punctuation 😂😂
---
Oh, far more than just one. Unhooking right after Freddy's hooked someone and both the hooker and unhooked survivor are invincible until they finally fall asleep. Being able to run to a safe looping spot before the dream transition ends and Freddy can't stop them. Same goes for awake people running up and healing just downed survivors, Freddy also can't stop them. Awake survivors being able to 100% safe bodyblock for asleep survivors. Survivors being able to get skillchecks in the dream transition and cancel it before it's even finished, wasting even more of Freddy's time. Self Care is still godlike against Freddy, as is Adrenaline, and Unbreakable (and No Mither, but who seriously uses that?). As if those perks weren't meta enough already, they give Freddy an extra kick in the gut. It's far more than just one.
---
just had something worst... 4x rank 1 or 2 vs rank 20 killer... she went afk, after we took 4 gens and she couldnt' get anyone.. :(
---

---
Survivor main here. I approve!
---
Something to do with inputs 
---
This games matchmaking is absolutely perfect (Said no one ever)
---
Wtf your so clean dude
---
Haha
---
I'm getting the same thing. Red ranked survivor playing against just random ranks.
---
I’m weak for Claudettes who crouch in a corner all game and run spine chill, I’ll typically give them hatch.
---
Pretty hot tbh. 
---
I really like that you made it upside down. The shading is wonderful as well.
---
The fantastic matchmaking 
---
I really like it. I really, *really* like it. THE SPIDER GOD'S DEADLIEST SERVANT.
---
Sabe thing happened to me :/ I WAS AT RANK 2!!! Who plays leatherface at rank 2?? Without a mori??
---
NOT A ZOMBIE KOOTHRAPALLI
---
just lobby dodge until you dont have those type of players.....KIDDDDDDDINNNNNGG!!! 
---
When playing with friends I like to urban evade up to them, press the point button to ‘boop’ them, then urban evade away again.
---
What? 
---
Swf group of 3 ran to me as I was doing gens dropped firecrackers so the killer could find me then they all watched as I was hooked t bagged and clicked flashlights. Let's just say I've never played survivor after that as that was literally my first game
---
clown at bottom. LOL
---
Because I am curious and I can always change my mind on how I level 
---
Just our luck. You won't lose the add-ons at least, but so much for them waking up without their skeletons...
---
Someone on pc, how many people said fuck legion? all the words are smashed together.
---
ah well. i thought that might happen, but i like the design too much!
---
It's a game in the end, so if you want one side to feel helpless as much as possible, keep doing what you do. If you are doing a gen right under the killer than you are overmatched for that killer. 
---
There's definitely some killers who use it as a negative statement.
---
I would say it depends on what edition he is using. 
---
Haha exactly my thought, beat me to it :D
---
Huntress is a Druid or Ranger
---
Doc would be a sorcerer 
---
Legion,wraith and pig would be rouges
---
Billy, leatherface, and myers are barbarians
---
Hillbilly definitely a fighter
---
Can’t think of what the others would be
---
**STAB**
---
*EEEEEK*
---
lmao but you died
---
Git gud
---
When I say it, I usually refer to specific survivors and not the entire team. For example,people are dying on the hook, and the  swf Just does gens and lets the randoms die.
---
Basically when a survivor ignores the team aspect of the match and just does gens 
---
Don't forget Myers, the guy that's known for walking somehow, someway, has a 115% movement speed. lol 
---
So that explains why they're able to blind me THROUGH MY WELDER'S MASK
---
it's to bring attention away from when he faked drawing the clown.
---
Not anymore
---
BWA HA HA!
---
BLEED THE SWINE!
---
Shut up
---
I'm sorry sir I'll try to tone it down for the next one :(
---
He is, however, a camper. Very sad. ):
---
yes
---
Understandable
---
Super sick.
---
But was it traced? Xd
---
Well they are working on matchmaking and trying things out here and there without saying anything. Been doing it for weeks now little by little. This is the first hiccup with it that I know of. 
---
I wasn't literally meaning he was suddenly a god. He is better than hag at all those points was more what I was meaning.
---
&gt; Is that seriously gonna stop a survivor from unhooking?
---
What's hag gunna do to stop you unhooking? Literally nothing because above rank 12 nobody is stupid enough to walk over traps.
---
&gt; You can also just sit at the pallet and Clown can do absolutely nothing at all
---
What does hag do, place a trap while survivor stands there? Letting the chase continue? If she doesn't break the pallet the survivor has enough time to loop and jump over the pallet again if their half decent enough.
---
Hag overall is an easy game for any decent set of players due to the fact she is a big fat waste of time. Putting her above the doc even is laughable.
---
No, they have hair. It is technically different.
---
You can change/mask an ip extremely easily 
---
The 5th one
---
That's because GTAO is a bad game. 
---
More like r/dbdgonewild
---
Thanks!
---
New fix for the game: Turn off all the servers for Dbd, no one can complain now, right?
---
Trophy earned: Adept Boi
---
What a massive piece of shit they are indeed.
---
thank you very much! 
---
Ok good to know at least. From the posts I see from time to time, a lot of people unironically feel that way.
---
Kind of funny I never did that achievement til 2 weeks ago I think and I had this game for a year now 
---
We should be able to do this to camping killers and then camp them in turn! 
---
Why? Just why? Why it's so amazing?
---
Pls add new killer
---
double W H E E Z E 
---
I re-did my research about pigs chest hair for some reason, I guess I have nothing better to do with my life
---
It appears that in most (atleast all sources in my limited research) it is stated that pigs have hair, not fur. While it is basically the same thing chemically and shit there seems to be a difference in how it grows, lenght patterns etc. and by these descriptions pigs have hair.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So technically it's not a fursuit...
---
It's a wig. 
---
5.
---
Go ahead and let us know how you did that. It sounds fascinating.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be 
---
I've come across one who farmed with me and another player after two immediate disconnects.  Ever since then, I give leatherface the benefit of the doubt.  But yeah, more often than not, they go hard and nasty.
---
well thing is nurse was the only exception to the 115% movement speed rule back then
---
Gen Rushing is the killers version of Tunneling. 
---
Just laugh at them and ignore. 
---
Hot Fuzz gets an auto upvote from me.
---
whats this?
---
He said it was incase we got a skillcheck on a sleeping, dying survivor and woke them up. Bit silly, but w/e
---
Report his message on Playstation. You aren't allowed to insult people in messages and you only need a few strikes before you get banned.
---
Game literally started, i did two dull totems, picked one person off the ground, and escaped...
---
They're gonna release a new killer in March. Then 4 new killers in June, September, December 2019 and March 2020. The Legion and Freddy changes won't replace a chapter, it'll either come with the new chapter release or be a mid-chapter release.
---
Been an artist for nearly 10 years now. What I’ve come to learn is that people don’t generally care how you did it, but what it is. If it looks good, then literally nobody is gonna give a shit if you traced it or not. Problem is, this doesn’t look good. The process doesn’t matter nearly as much as the final result.
---
Yeah but if you find someone decently fast after the game started  and down them decently fast after you hook them boom 3 gens are done if you dont have ruin and even if you do they could just break it in the 1st 20 secs of the game god forbid you take more then 15 secs downing a survivors you get bones by ever other survivors doing a gen alone and if more then 1 has a toolbox you get gen rushed its not the survivors fault gens just et done to fast sometimes and if you dont have ruin lvl 3 it gets ruff
---
*Thonking sun gif intensifies*
---
Same reason Destiny was created.(minus the split) developers bored with their current "project" and wanting to branch into something different but obviously not too *different* 
---
I mean there nerfing it gl with that lol
---
Well that’s not nice
---
And how exactly is that? 
---
When no mither was added it was called hard mode for survivors because at the time survivor was a breeze. This is a fact. 
---
I really can’t take you seriously anymore, every comment chain you are involved in is like this. Someone disagrees with you? Let’s just provide little to no information and then claim they are wrong. 
---
As a Laurie main, I applaud every Myers I run into 
---
I had the same thing earlier. I was the lowest rank of the survivors at rank 8 against a 20 rank killer. There wasn't a long wait time for the match either, so not sure how it happened. 
---
what why? the perk isnt even good why nerf it
---
Thx
---
For licensed killers, this would be cool:
---
1. Candyman
---
2. Ghostface
---
3. Pamela Vorhees (if the lawsuit gets fixed)
---
4. Samara from the Ring
---
5. The Thing
---
6. Pennywise 
---
Sorry I just hate Michael
---
I'll pm you if I have future questions thanks.
---
Can't tell if trolling or not, but in case you aren't, because it's literally the second best perk in the game on the survivors side lol. It allows you to play so recklessly and get away with it lol.
---
You can buy a pc at Walmart for less than 100$. 
---
Dude I'd love to have Jacket in the game
---
It's one of the strongest perks on surv side lol
---
Why don't you read what I wrote earlier and see it there? I'm not gonna repeat myself. "Every comment chain" maybe you just have bad reading comprehension. I fully explain my thought process every single time. Also, oof on the creepy stalking through my page.
---
is the matchmaking going fast tho?
---
not really lol 
---
even if you use it successfuly the killer will still down you again after 15 seconds
---
Holocaust didnt happen.
---
Just get good 
---
You've obviously never played killer if you don't think it's good
---
They are making the skill check bigger LOL. I assume this is a troll, but it’s because the perk is OP as fuck, they at least tried to do something tomake it slightly less so, hence the ‘difficult’ skill check.
---
because her head looks like a potato sack and it was boring to look at when drawn hahahaha
---
It’s ok just don’t let him know🔪
---
He is soooo **T I C C**
---
You have to be kidding. That would make it unfair for killer. You just need to get better at skillchecks. I bet you struggle against the doctor.
---
Is Myers considered easy to play or what does this mean? 
---
You realize in your own statement you admit that your just bad at using it? How can you say the perk is bad when you admit you personally fail at using it 8 out of 10 games. If you seriously can't land a skill check as a survivor player, then I honestly feel bad for you.   
---
On top of that, it is hilariously easily to run most killers around for easily the entire match, and if you ever screw up and get downed, decisive strike just allows you to revert your fuck up and continue to run the killer around for another 5 minutes.  All I can think is your either trolling, or your brand new to the game and you just don't know how to play very well.
---
I assume so. I’m not staff so dunno for sure. 
---
P3 Claudette Ochido wannabe confirmed.
---
OMG i fucking hate the doctor
---
he's literally my least favorite to go against besides wraith 
---
You just got it relax. Just practise hitting it in games and you will hit it more often.
---
spend your golden coins they expire soon
---
Both red ranks yes
---
If it is not bee, I swear
---
Once an asshole, always an asshole.
---
Maybe because there's evidence backing allegations made against him?
---
Overall, I think she's high rank material if you equip the right perks and use your RBTs wisely. Her power is very RNG dependent, but if RNG favors you, then her power is the equivalent of running a Ruin which works even after all the gens are finished and the gates powered. Her endgame is probably even better than Freddy's since she can potentially kill all survivors within 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Apart from the perks I have equipped, Whispers, Nurse's Calling, Surveillance, Make Your Choice, Monitor &amp; Abuse, Hex: Ruin, Shadowborn, NOED, and all end game perks are absolutely great on her. I just love playing as Pig so much because I get to feel like I'm really inflicting survivors with desperation, and I just love the "Game Over" type of vibe I get from doing end game with Blood Warden + Rancor/NOED, as seen in the clip.
---
TL;DR: She's absolutely great if you really want to feel like a sadist punishing survivors for doing all gens without having to equip NOED. Two of her perks are absolutely great for specific builds and synergies, while the other completely counters sabo if you ever suspect the survivors are gonna run a sabo squad.
---
*That's gotta hoit*
---
Do you want disconnects and toxic post-game logs, or to scare people by stalking their avatar from a distant window while they t-bag you?
---
I guess I'm saying that you stop scaring people once they learn how to play effectively, and rp isn't going to work in most matches.
---
Face camping is making sure your face is literally buried into the survivor 
---
"Gen Rushing" is an actual term that doesn't just mean doing gens fast. Or at least how I use it. I use it to refer to a group of survivors who stick together and only ever do gens when there are three or more people working on it, most of which have toolboxes. This is why I consider Discordance to be an anti gen rush perk, because it allows you to break up gens that have multiple people on them.
---
Don't bother explaining it to someone who posts like that. Most likely just trolling to get a rise out of people and doesn't give a damn about anything else. You even got a "get good" reply that proves my point.
---
In my opinion. It isn't how fast a Killer can find, chase, down, and hook someone. That has a large part of it all, but the real problem is that no Killer can pressure more than 1 Survivor at a time. Letting the other 3 have free roam to work gens or what ever they want.
---
You feel your sins crawling on your back...
---
That's not facecamping, but if you didn't see or hear any other survivors near the hook and you're hovering around it you're still camping 
---
The Bell rings at 4:20
---
🙏 thank you
---
Dude it was so hard to get those 4 stacks of WGLF, ofc imma squeeze it to the very last drop.
---
(X) Doubt

[removed]
---
Hot take from a Leatherface main:
---
With the new changes, DS shouldn't be harder than a regular gen skillcheck, and it should stun like it used to if you Great skillcheck it.
---
It's much easier to counterplay, and it's closer to NOED as it is now than it used to be.
---
Gen rushing is easily countered by hook rushing.
---
That sounds interesting, might try that see how it turns out.
---
Proxy camping = patrolling the area I feel is ok if you actually see a survivor in the immediate vicinity but perhaps lost sight of them. Personally I would walk round for like 30 seconds and depending on how many gens are left, go back to checking the gens.
---
Face camping unless the gates are powered up is pointless. Smart survivors will be and should be doing gens.
---
This is why kindred is your friend.

been thinking about doing this kind of poll for the longest time, thanks for doing it
---
Literally the first rule of the subreddit is dont be a dick
---
Lmao no. If you actually think Hag is worse than doctor then im not even going to bother arguing with you.
---
Arguing with someone as daft as you is a fools errand, but just know that in saying the holocaust didn’t happen, you’re arguably worse than anti vaxxers.
---
Fuck, Im old.
---
I instantly heard a Full House "how rude" quote in my head reading that. Then remembered how many decades ago that show came out.
---
Well maybe but it's happened three times now including this one. Idk seems strange to me. It's PS4 as well
---
It is possible that the killer was using Tinkerer? when a Generator reaches 85%, their heartbeat goes away for 8/10/12 seconds.
---
i would like to see!
---
Not a fan of running one hit perks, feels a bit cheap. Due to my poor eyesight i HAVE to have whispers or i wont find survivors at all. I also cannot track in a chase whatsoever. I am, however, very drawn to her ability to crouch, giving a stealth approach, which i love with killers. So far, freddy is the only killer i can be good with, because his playstyle counters my flaws. plus with freedy, if rng fails you even with 2 skill check reduction add-ons, you can just put them right back to sleep, suffering little penalty. Im just hesitant to pick up a killer that i'd just get rekt with, end up not playing, and adding another killer ritual to the pool.
---
Will it run DBD?
---
That is a year old... Why post it?
---
people only believe in what they want to believe. i know you've drawn the clown, and i think it's amazing. but the guys who've said you traced it will insist you traced it, because they're just losers whose only happiness in life is to be mean to other people. they want to think it was traced, it's ok. it's not as if their opinion is really important, it isn't - at all!
---
when do you think the next killer will be revealed?
---
Ok. I’ll start doing regular weekly updates probably. I’m still in the very early stages of it. 
---
no not saying you said it but everyone likes to compare ds to noed except they like to say noed is only used by trashy survivors but if you try to say ds is a trashy survivor perk you get slammed for it kind of a double standard .
---
Jump scare Myers build on the game or the institute 
---
Ayyy trixie mattel what’s good 👌🏼
---
Nah, I was just putting that near the "We barely have any good perks"

well said my friend, glad you didn't buckle and take the video down, very entertaining to watch and see all the butthurtness in the comments. Some of us are mature enough to have constructive mature dialogue with and i am glad there are some of us including you that are like that.
---
I know how you feel about instadown perks. I've stopped running NOED (extremely cheap perk. absolutely hate knowing that it's only used as a crutch) altogether and instead run Rancor since it allows me to keep most of my STBFL stacks near the end instead of having to lose half of them (given that I have all 8 when gens are done). Rancor also doubles down as a way to know if someone is behind a rock or wall nearby, or even to punish shitty behavior since most obsessions are just little shits like this. If you really cant track in a chase, try out tracking perks like Bloodhound and Stridor. Perks are there to help after all. Just try using a Glass Splinter to try out the Pig. I'm sure you have one or two of those lying around.
---
rules don't matter, just invite Marth88 and he'll win unless y'all fuck him over again.
---
My favourite is at the start of the matches where all the survivors start together and everyone just starst sprinting in circles and furiously t-bag hello'ing to eachother. 
---
Smooth Criminal 😎
---
Is it possible to drop a survivor close enough to the exit gate that the trap activates?
---
There's specifically people that derank on purpose or make new accounts so they can mess with new players and put it on twitch or YouTube and everyone thinks it's hilarious
---
Check my post history ;]
---
Sure you leave the vault with momentum yet that didnt fix the problem (still get hit through windows even though the animation is done whenever I play, besides, the momentum thing from what I recall wasn't to counter being hit through windows) and it isn't false, ask a surv with probably like 15 games in rank 1 and see what they say
---
They would have to have servers to begin with.
---
No, that's how Tinkerer works. Once a gen gets to 85%, the killer's heartbeat goes away.
---
He's a pedo and an asshole, but he was banned first for using and advertising exploits, then was banned again for ban evading. A perma ban is a perma ban, BHVR doesn't care if you get around it with a new account, they'll just ban you again.
---
I tend to play Myers and am looking for a build to basically focus in on trying to get as many people as possible killed regardless of method.
---
Putting aside add ons....would there be a benefit to running perk setups like....
---
Ruin(damn I wish I didn't have to run this), Spirit fury, enduring, Surveillance?
---
Is surveillance any good? Should I run save the best for last or Monitor and abuse instead of surveillance? Why or why not?
---
  
---
I personally like Stbfl and thats why its on the list but am having a hard time justifying it over the chase benefit you get from having a smaller terror radius or just knowing whenever a survivor is working on a generator through sound and yellow gen notifications.
---
No One Escapes.
---
Lol you're obviously someone who does that shit if you have to defend them that badly
---
She had a gun when she first entered the entity but ran out of ammo and has no way to acquire more
---
Hatchets can be sharpened and reused
---
Exactly so why do these nerds feel the need to foam at the mouth in someone's DM's lmfao
---
Never heard ochido was a pedo. Any proof of this claim or did someone just throw this out and it spread like wildfire?
---
not really. for nearly every other game, it makes it easier but this isn't an FPS.
---
Yeah but then survivor mains bitch and cry tunnel.
---
Because normally it forces them to drop on the escape point to where they exit the match.  Also he was just being nice/letting the dude get some extra BP for escaping a Killer's grasp.  
---
Bing bång

Ohh, well I'm only rank 13 survivor. That sorta makes sense though. 
---
Stupidly massive tight tits, but otherwise this is awesome !
---
I’ve responded to everything you’ve wrote so far and you’ve hardly even tried to give decent counterarguments. 
---
It’s true, every comment chain I’ve seen you take part in, in my current memory, is the same shit, you act as though you are better than the other person and invalidate anything they say with meaningless messages such as, “You’re wrong.” You haven’t, “fully explained,” any, “process,” in this conversation. 
---
Why would I need to stalk your page to see your comment chains? I’m active on the sub and can easily view messages by merely opening a post. 
---
All good man. I'm kicking myself in the ass for not trying killer sooner!
---
Hopefully someone who knows him will reveal his new name. 
---
sure, whatever you say buddy - I guess I should take your word on it, even though I've been playing the game for nearly 3 years, and especially since you did not even address the 2nd clip I linked which makes it painfully obvious there is an issue with hitboxes lol.
---
move along everyone, theres absolutely nothing wrong with hitboxes - carry on with your day!
---
No, Rank Reset can still take people to below 15. 
---
Would survivors find it enough of a nerf/balance?
---
Please don't, it's so bad, it's huntress
---
i am the rank 20.....
---
Identity V in a nutshell
---
This is really the right answer.  If you're afraid of NOED, start by doing all the totems (there's usually ruin anyway), then open all the chests because that will help you get items that make you win, and then start working on the gens.
---
You must be a virgin. The amount of Legion hate you've posted is enough for everyone.
---
Just today I played with my brother in SWF, were both rank 1 and we got paired with rank 20 new killers three times in a row. We dont bm, but it really sucks for them. 
---
I played killer only three times and Ive never been matched with new survivors either, which made my experience horrible and made me not want to play killer again. At rank 20 the matchmaking also takes 15 minutes everytime for me, which makes me think there might simply not be enough new survivors? Not sure. 
---
It was definitely camping, but justified camping.
---
Blood Warden was never set off. I was only really able to see their aura. Although, I've seen other people teabag at the gates without even making sure that there is a Blood Warden active. 
---
ChickenBoo had enough of our shit. 
---
Survivor can be one of his alter egos.
---
Same thing happened to me earlier. Beat a 4-man group with just one gen completed on Hag and then saw they were ranks 14 through 7 (I’m rank 1).  Haha how did that game even happen? My only guess is that they were waiting so long that it just put them with “anyone.”
---

Was playing a SWF with some somewhat new players and I was hanging on the hook after being NOEDed.  The aura of one of my teammates stops to perform a cleanse and I said, "thank God you found NOED." He responded, "it's not NOED." I was like, "stop cleansing dull totems and find NOED!!" They unhooked me and I found it.
---
Is it a Noun or a Curse?
---
My comment is literally a copypasta from the clown post
---
I’m just trying to understand your shirt. 
---
I'm with you on Freddy. I also have poor eyesight as well. I can't track very well and often lose chases. But with Freddy,  it's like playing with the brightness turned up and when I lose a survivor, I can find them again.
---
I played a little pig and she stalks so close to the ground that i find it unsettling and hard to see.
---
Myers is probably my overall favorite with Legion being my least favorite. He's your basic YouTube troll put in a game. 
---
Not him.
---
Billy's chainsaw and wraith uncloaking are super distorted for me, too.
---
Lol whatever I’m not that stupid 
---
Legion with BBQ. Ez
---
OwO Daddy's knife is s-so big! OwO 
---
lol whatever I’m not that stupid 
---
In my experience, it's doctor and scratched mirror Michael. But I didn't keep track of BPs so idk. I'm just saying those two because they have extra BPs in certain categories.
---
Anyone knows how to do this looking up head movement while squatting this David did on this video? Because it looks silly AF and I love it :
---
https://youtu.be/2xyHUJxzsTQ
---
It'd probably trigger any killer main though. I never understand why. Teabagging is just a form of greetings for most survivors IME. 
---
These are some of the best designed perks I’ve ever seen 
---
Don’t main her, but she is quite fun. Putting traps on players who spent time working you over is so satisfying lol. Her dash attack is a little inept but you can mind game pretty well for it. I’ve never really thought about perk builds tbh I just toss on whatever sounds fun. Haunted Ground is pretty good on her, especially if it’s cleansed early, because her crouch hides her terror radius and survivors sometimes become less immersed
---
Just to clarify the window hit since you seemed very surprised: You were definitely all the way through, yes, but the killer can swing and hit survivors over windows and you were definitely close enough to hit still. The same goes with swinging over Haddonfield white fences and certain short bushes. 
---
Figured I'd through this out there since a lot of people seem to rage about hits like this.
---
And yet you 2 are the ones who died lol
---
I've had these happen to me. Thankfully I was a 3 man swf so I just did totems and ran the killer around
---
He has insta down, but no chase power. Everyone above him has a chase power or high mobility.
---
Yes!
---
Classic "Someone called me camper and I did actually camp but that's not camping right?"
---
Depends on how long. 
---
AFAIK past 10 minutes is reportable. 
---
Oh so quiet until you hear BING Bjöng
---
If it was a good teammate and I just got unlucky I'll suicide to give him a chance. 
---
But more often than not it's the urban evading asshole who did no work the whole match, found the hatch and is now camping it until you die. 
---
Seriously hate stealth competitions when there's just two people left
---
Clown main here. Bought his Santa skin first chance I got. The only real money I’ve ever spent on that game and it was worth it.
---
You don't have to take my word for it, you have the goddamn video. You're the one who posted, Sherlock! I thought maybe you were just on mobile and couldn't download the clip to go frame by frame, so I even pulled the frame where she gets hit for you. It's the link in my post. Laurie's torso is dead center of the screen. The spirit is practically whispering sweet nothings in Laurie's ear. "Mm, yeah, Laurie, lemme scratch that back with my magic ghost katana."
---
You know what? I would be *happy* to talk about the zubatlel clip (it is actually kind of funny once you understand what's going on) when you can explain why you want [this](https://imgur.com/a/b83aL6K) to be a miss. You can't simultaneously talk shit about me explaining the first clip and and desperately change the topic now that I've explained the first clip. That's just bad faith dickishness. Seriously, why is that supposed to be a miss? Why did that clip offend you?
---
I find her very fun, she isn’t my main but she was definitely one I wanted to pick up when I first started playing. I find her to be annoying when she’s going straight for the person who has been unhooked and has a trap on their head. It makes the trap practically irrelevant and makes for a boring/annoying game. Some of her perks I don’t like using much, but Make your Choice is actually pretty good if you are able to find the person who unhooked a survivor within a short period. She can be good early to late really, depending on how she’s built, but considering traps are there to help slow down the game I say another good perk to have is Ruin. 
---
She is extremely fun. Nothing like getting that hit in before your ambush lunge misses. There's a sick thrill of watching survivors try to get their bear traps off to no avail. She can get hits in pretty damn quickly and she's virtually invisible with Insidious. Sloppy Butcher is an excellent perk to have with her.
---
Sadly 😕
---
Add a meat packing offering if you wanna really pick people off 
---
... He means test it in KYF because survivors in normal games won't stand still and let you hit them. And standing still is the only way to make sure ping won't affect the results.
---
Of course, different animations have different hitboxes, and certain animations (vaulting) involve movement, so you can't actually test all of the hitboxes. I actually do wonder what the vaulting hitboxes look like, and how different it is from the model.
---
I would assume by just crouching and looking up
---
Yeah but if they camp the pallet then you just shred through pallets really quick until they run out. Even window loops get invalidated by the gas if played right. His chase potential is what makes him so good, just slap ruin, BBQ, Sloppy Butcher, and STBFL on him and ride that momentum to victory. His stall and his pressure comes from the momentum you gather when hooking and hurting people, so he’s not that bad of a killer. 
---
&gt;There’s too many people who think the killers should just act like bots and let everyone escape.
---
This. Survivors seem to forget sometimes (at least unconsciously) that on the other side of the killer's screen is a real person. On the other hand, BHVR seems to have succeeded in creating the world's smartest AI, simply by making what pretty much acts like a bot (in regards to their *re*action and *act*ion abilities) controlled by a real person. 
---
Did anyone see those meme master Dwights in EdgarAllanBro’s stream yesterday? 
---
Lady killers.  wink wink
---
You've been hit by, you've been struck by, a smooth criminal
---
Look how fun the game is when people don't act super toxic and salty! Mind blown. That slow turn was hilarious lol
---
"I guess you're gonna say this is traced too?"
---
Freddy is still V-tier i see
---
This man was moried for the crime of teabagging. Justice and revenge have been served.
---
Oh strange. Console has been fucking up lately (then again when hasnt it)
---
kinda sounds like he was takin the piss....
---
Just had a similar match. Except the killer was rank 20 😬
---
If you play on either of the base consoles then I salute you, but otherwise literally anytime anything happened I’d just get the most painful frame drops mid chase and that used to be the most painful goddamn thing in my life. God forbid someone tries to 360 me, that crap looks like a disappearing act sometimes.
---
I’ve since gotten the Xbox one X, and god I would never go back to 5-15 FPS even if you held a gun to my head. (It’s worth noting for the sake of clarity, it didn’t run at a steady 5 FPS, but it gets really close when bloodlust is active, and activating any loud noise notification would put it at 5 FPS for at least the next 3 seconds)
---
I don't understand. A Leatherfacerino securing a kill?
---
Welcome to the club! I felt accomplished when I got it, nice to see others enjoying platinum status
---
The only BS I see as killer is the "auto-aim."
---
Imagine a survivor who is half behind a wall; covered on your left, exposed on your right. You don't want to hit the wall, so you aim your attack to the survivor's right to smack their shoulders. Then some weird shit happens and  your camera jerks directly to the survivor's center mass and you smack the wall you were trying to avoid instead of the shoulder you were aiming.
---
As far as I can tell, DBD doesn't really have auto-aim, but it does sometimes snap your camera onto survivors after you hit them - I assume for aesthetic reasons. It'll never turn a miss into a hit, but I guess they thought it would make the game look a little nicer if flimsy, grazing hits were turned into dead-on thwacks. Makes everything feel more 'solid,' right? You can really notice it when you have a bunch of survivors clumped together, because you think you're hitting the Claudette in front of you and the game decides you're hitting the Bill like 90 degrees to your right, so the camera gives you fucking whiplash as it jerks from Claudette to Bill.
---
But there appears to be a bug with the auto-aim where the camera snap occurs BEFORE the hit registration - so if the survivor is partially obscured by level geometry, the game will go "okay, you're going to hit that survivor, so I need to move your camera to face them... but now that you're facing them directly there's an object in the way so you can't hit them anymore. Sucks to be you!"
---
It's rare, but god is it annoying.
---
Rank reset cannot take people lower than 15 any more for sure. You cannot even depip when you are rank 16-20.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Rank#Ranking
---
Checked just to be 100% sure.
---
Yes they did actually. You cannot go below rank 15 on reset day.
---
I hate stubbornness because blood-lust feels awful to go against, but in the same breath I know i would run the shit out of that perk on my weaker killers like wraith and trapper. Sooooo nice.
---
Yea, you do that, tell me how your games go. Especially do it against rank 1 billies, nuses and spirits.
---
They weren’t injured tho...
---
Bing Bong Sensuality
---
My Trapper is already the best paid killer for me in that scenario. Myers is currently trailing by about $20 an hour. 
---
(Clears throat in an embarrassed manner) Rather obscure reference to the Big Bang Theory. 
---
Curse can be a noun
---
That's cinematic mode. It's a new feature. Imagine seeing a bug in this game... 
---
Could have drawn the new skin.
---
Matchmaking isn't a thing. There are also plenty of people that think a skill based matchmaking would be bad. Just ask the Discord.
---
That’s unfortunately the downside to killer gameplay. It’s very robotic in how you need to react, it’s a lot of going through the motions instead of creative strategy.     
---
    
---
I’d like to say it’s mostly unconscious but I’ve seen a lot of blatant toxicity that it’s only cause was because the survivor had a 0 iq. For example (I wouldn’t really call it farming) but I’ve just afk’d before in a match or I’ll dick around and spook people. Luckily I always get a few survs who have a brain and pick up on what’s going on very easy but I’ve had countless people who believed they “played out of their minds like a god” and try and show off. I’ve literally drove around a map as billy for 30 mins straight to end the match and have someone brag that they not only “dodged” and “gen rushed me” but “escaped” when I get sick of them waiting at a door and push them out. I don’t get it sometimes, I don’t understand how someone’s brain can be that disconnected to what’s happening right infront of them.
---
ITT: People that don't realize generators are literally the objective
---
you bet meyer's sweet ass.
---
maybe i'll make each killers variations of skins in another project
---
Dodge the lobby bro! It's legion!
---
Time to gen tap. :)
---
Damn that felt good and I didn't even play that game.
---
Pls no bulli
---
Really wish that they did so that I could post for even more sweet karma but they didn't. Tried to message them in turn with something simple like "ez" but they had messages turned off (gee, wonder why...) so yeah that's the end of that.
---
With DS now triggering Obsession on the person who uses it, it will change who the Obsession is throughout the game. Thus, Obsession based Killer perks will be affected depending on which perk it is. The biggest example is Dying Light, which if more than one person has DS and the Killer kills the first Obsession (triggering DL's debuffs) and then another survivor uses DS, they become the Obsession and now that the Obsession is alive, DL will no longer apply the debuffs.
---
It doesnt have the be active to see the auras in the gate. That's a permanent passive effect of Blood Warden.
---
My meme returned to me!
---
Well if you don’t get a dc legion is sadly really good for BP. Wouldn’t recommend playing him anymore than the next guy, but I can’t deny he’ll earn you your fair share.
---
Swf killer main.

To make you feel even better, I got hit with two D-Strikes and had a Dwight sabo every hook in front of me. In turn however I managed to get a sweet sweet head pop :)
---
Nah on the game ps4
---
I appreciate your name.
---
Awesome artwork. Didn't know there were Legion fans. This is great.
---
I’ll give it to anyone who doesn’t struggle when I pick them up in the end pretty much lol
---
Honest to god they’re really well designed, they truly do mirror their survivor perks to some extent, and they’re actually balanced. Why is this guy not a dev already? McCote where you at?
---
Ahs reference?
---
How is it fan art when no one is a fan of legion 
---
Can’t wait to hear some of the killer cleansing sounds. &lt;moans in Trapper&gt;
---
My setup except Iron Will instead of Lightweight. Used it for such a long time I love it too much to change it

Very satisfying

I don't have anything to spend them on.  The remaining outfit costs 3 coins.

You can, you just need to sacrifice your thumb
---
Love the AHS reference c:
---
Nah we were stuck with 100. They changed it to 20 just like steam...
---
So alot easier and less time consuming now id say :)
---
Yea. I did a few tweaks to it. Trying to make it more clear. 
---
This is an increasingly common thing for console for me, but it won't happen all the time. Mostly you should still have "balanced" games.
---
Dumb bitch!
---
One way is to listen for whooshing noises.
---
Ruin is fine lmao it doesn’t need a rework. 
---
Ok. What exactly is different? I didn't read this because I read an earlier version, and I didn't realize this is a newer version.
---
It was the 100% sure part that irked me. Then what really irritated me was when I had gone through the effort of typing a response explaining, Reddit was kind enough to happily tell me that I couldn’t post my response because the comment was deleted. 
---
So yeah, my salt levels spiked a bit. I stand by that you should have read the source more closely the first time around if only because that’s how misinformation is spread. 
---
As to being glad that you changed your mind willingly instead of getting into an argument? No. That should be the norm and not the exception. I don’t think that’s anything to be thankful for. 
---
Anyways, I’ve cooled down quite a bit. Sorry for calling you out. 
---
Yeah I’m pretty sure too but the radio silence from the devs lately is making me suspicious. If this next killer is original I’m 99% sure the one in the Summer will be licensed since they are big money makers for them. We shall see soon though.
---
Well they for sure played better than the other 2 because they scored higher than them even though they escaped lol.
---
My favourite build to actually be scary is Trapper with Enduring, Spirit Fury, Brutal Strength and BBQ for extra points. Makes them think they're safe with their pallets but all you do is just walk through them like an absolute unit.
---
It really do be like that though 
---
She’s very fun. I went through a phase back when I first started playing where I despised her, but now after ~200 hours she’s very fun to play and she’s one of my favorite killers. Freddy is still #1 for me, but pig is a very close second. She was actually my first P3 killer too. 
---
This has been happening all day from the posts I’ve seen, it’s happened to me a few times today as well... 
---
This is definitely the best one
---
He’s extremely broken, but legion is amazing for bloodpoints. 
---
Watching that old video again, hm? I do it too sometimes when I need to be reminded that my skill is not the determining factor in most matches, but is more of a commodity.
---
I'm pretty sure your suggestion would be a massive buff to ruin at max level a killer could pretty easily keep it up 100% of the time and survivors would literally have no options for it. 
---
To be quite honest, this sounds even more painful to deal with than current ruin, and it’s no longer a hex. 
---
Also, I know this is really minor, but it was funny to read~ you have chance of getting a skill check like once per second or something like that, it’s why unnerving presence actually makes a difference with that 10%. Putting a 50% increase on the chances of a skill check on top of having 5% regression for a good skill check is gonna regress the mess outta that generator if you try to work on once the killer activates their ruin.
---
Nice. I just got mori'd three times in a row. Fun...
---
Its traced because you can see the lines /ss
---
Yeah it’s what made me even consider the possibility of pity kills
---
I hope they just release something. I long since lost hope they are capable of fixing anything.
---
One getting rid of the video. Two I'm still new Reddit and was just told there was an edit option .-. But the numbers and everything is the same. Just less to read
---
That's only if they're out of terror radius though. 
---
In mind game situations you're going to be in terror radius and won't hear that.
---
She is pretty fun, although I haven't played her much. I should play her more.
---
To be fair, most of this is just flair like the whole Obsession aspect of the DS change. I'd just be happy with the first part of the Ruin change where kicking a generator activates it for 60 seconds. 
---
I just referenced something that happened a few hours ago about somebody who supposedly drew the clown but then he was exposed by someone telling him that he didnt draw it, and then he made another post about a jack sparrow drawing and he named it " I guess you're gonna say this is traced too"
---
Lol I obviously don't literally mean you should thank me for changing my mind. I said that because most people on Reddit (internet in general really) would have stood stubbornly by their wrong answer. I actually did delete it within 10-15 seconds though, so I'm sorry that you saw it so fast. I was focused on the normal deranking and forgot to read the new reset rules. You basically have to not play for months to get back to 18-20.
---
Honestly, this is me if it's down to just two of us and I find the hatch and they're still running around, hiding from the killer. xD
---
What am I looking at exactly? THe DC?
---
I know, i saw the post there, before the mass downvoting
---
I love the video where somebody replaces the hag's mori animation with Bra model. So funny!
---
Ok
---
As much as I hate my totem being broken this rework idea is exactly that broken. A killer would literally be able to keep half the gens protected without ever trying
---
Ranks. Matchmaking seems to be a little messed up rn.
---
No options for it, except...
---
Prove Thyself, Toolboxes with increased repair speed + Skill Check difficulty reductions, the No Mither build...
---
it's kinda redundant tbh
---
That’s a proper Nown
---
The level 1 survivor being put in a group of beginner levels 
---
K or k?
---
This is why I don't linger or tbag a killer 😂. Props to you for getting your kill &gt;:3!
---
Unpopular opinion: TydeTime actually makes some good videos and some nice guides
---
Often. I believe it's gone on sale twice since Christmas so far lol
---
*She's a Maniac by Flashdance plays as my killer terror radius*
---
Youch. Stealing and plagiarizing is a bad move just for some internet points to stroke their ego
---
I get the feeling that the programmers removed free turning during swing animations, where the killer model would track with the player, and now they just lunge straight but the physical swing can change directions.
---
Idk, bad ping is one thing, but not every one of there is bad ping. 
---
Right, I just cringed so hard because of how hard he was trying to show how he isn't lying 
---
Nah, it's not a recent change. Matchmaking like this has been in the game for forever now.
---
I am getting more consistent bad ping lobbies though. Dedicated servers will be a godsend if they get it right.
---
Can't see it in this clip, but the planets also aligned 
---
&gt;20 hours ago
---
Don't leave us hanging. Did you finish it today???
---
This won't work as the 1% elite the devs listen to don't kick gens.
---
It's just been wackw the past couple of days.
---
Like, more wack than it usually is: I've been consistently getting Rank 18-20 Survivors (I'ma Rank 4 Killer rn on PS4) and Rank 16 Killers (I'm Rank 8 Survivor rn on PS4).
---
Just farm, then get behind them on a gen and then do it with 3 tiny blinks and grab them.
---
Some are easy if you farm, including the hatch one, because you can farm with a key holder and let them all go hatch. At least on PC. 
---
I can't get the legion frenzy one, because nothing counts towards it. 
---
I had a teammate hide in the bushes right next to me on my first hook of the match because the hatch spawned *literally right underneath my hook*. They sat there teabagging and pointing at me hoping I’d give up once I got to the struggle phase. You can bet I made them wait!
---
Well done these do sound like good mirrors to their original versions
---
Who's that survivor
---
Reverse card played
---
Did you know she holds a glowing orb in her Blink hand for every Blink she has remaining? That way you can visualize how many blinks she has. 
---
I would set mine as the Scooby-Doo theme
---
Yes, yes you are, we need more people like you
---
*Gone on you with the pick and roll Young LaFlame, he in sicko mode* 
---
After that game I saw 2 of the survivors DC and they still had 3 gens up. I let the last 2 leave
---
Have to agree people should not be able to derank themself. If you ask me this should lead to temporary bans of 1 day.
---
Did you just assume their gender?
---
Sad but true, Legion is a BP machine 
---
This is just a recent occurrence, unless it takes too long to find a free lobby, matches are *usually* made with Survivors and Killers of comparable Ranks.
---
That's why the devs made it harder to derank into the &gt;15 Ranks, so that it's harder for new Players to get bullied by players with 1000+ hours.
---
Judging by this subreddit you all think camping is just a strategy but crouching a few times should get you lynched. Imagine reversing sticks and stones, I don't know how you guys got this brainwashed but it's kinda interesting.
---
She’s easily useable at high ranks. Run an anti loop perk like bamboozle and she’s awesome. Just use your traps near end game if gens get done quickly, I always use two at the start of the game and save the rest till two gens.
---
Dammit the blade
---
I definitely try to say gg no matter what happens. Unless someone is being incredibly toxic.
---
GAME OVER
---
*do do doo...do do DO DODODODODOOOOO*
---
Wait I thought he was banned? Guess this sadly means that he will be able to upload more content.
---
This happened to me today, too! I’m a lvl 19 killer (only play killer for daily rituals) and kept getting lvl 4-10 survivors!
---
It looks great, but
---
&gt;legion fan
---
does not compute
---
Lol I wouldn’t kill anyone. I would smack them
---
If they got close to me.
---
I would just say “Don’t disturb the Quiet” or “Thou shall not disturb the Quiet”
---
Lmao imagine stalking with a terror radius. This post was made by the Pig gang. (Im pig and Myers main so I can't really say anything)
---
It’s true tho
---
That’s also usually what I do when my teammate dies or drops their item from fd and it’s at the gate I might as well take their stuff since they can’t get it back anyway
---
Oh no. I used a perk in the game that gives me an advantage. I must be toxic. And borrowed time and self care is toxic? It takes 32 seconds to heal. 40 with sloppy. Thats half a gen they arent doing. Self care can actually help the killer. Also using items in the game isnt toxic. Getting a flashlight save isnt toxic. Sorry :/
---
Why’s that?
---
Get better at ending loops then
---
If a killer sacrifices my whole team and manages to do it without camping or being toxic, they’re definitely getting a gg from me!
---
Same goes for thank-you-for-healing-me-to-full teabags 
---
Aw man I just realized how I could've edited Hello Zepp into this with Jigsaw saying "Game Over" :(
---
Yes
---
Yes please!
---
Are you on xbox, Because I'm on ps4 and still says 100 for main and alt account...
---
It was a huge joke, poking fun of all the people who are doing everything but gens.
---
Lol, with my kinda luck I’m surprised I wasn’t that David because that would be the shit that happens to me after I’ve done like 4 of the 5 gens 😆. But as a Survivor main on Xbox myself, don’t let them get to you, you did nothing wrong and they were just dicks. That BS is just one of the reasons I don’t play killer, but I hope I come across you in the fog and would be honored to die by your hand! (Especially Nurse, I never see her on Xbox so good for you for adding variety to the killers we see 😄)
---
Especially a flashlight
---
No my stealthy creatures (Bacon and Quadrilateral Shape)

I don't think you know what "casual" means...

God damn they got styled on.

Omfg that’s hilarious! I’m guilty of this, but only do that to players who purposely run into the killer and are not doing anything else!

Doesn't matter, you're permabanned from the game it doesn't matter if you change, go find some other game to be cancerous in. Shouldn't have been allowed to last that long on console as is
---
"Actually it's three, Susie lost her's and made another her own." 
---
There should be a higher but smarter punishment. 
---
If there are survivors within certain range from the hook it shouldn't penalize you and it also shouldn't decrease the quality of your emblem once the exit gates are powered. 
---
This is using right stick, yeah? Pretty sure I tried it before but it didn't take. I'll try it again next time. 
---
Tell your pink shirt friend he could get it
---
AFAIK if you actually fail the skill check it'll count, but if you don't press space and let it "Time out" you can use it again.

I guess you could say that the connection was pretty **nightmarish**
---
Now we only need shirtless Myers.
---
No, I'm like half way through. Yes, I'm on of those people
---
I do it to the last person if they are good not toxic and just deserve it.
---
I like their character and the concept behind them. The only thing people don’t like about them is the lack of counterplay and his deep wound. Both make them obnoxious to play against.
---
weird flex but ok
---
tydetime has a good bloodweb guide. everything else on his channel...
---
Do not look at the killer, legit look all the way up
---
just don't act like you have borrowed time and we're good
---
We never even got a chance to move before they'd disconnect. Very strange. I've seen killers before DCing because I assume they didn't like the map but not this way with such specific circumstances. Oh well. Didn't want to play against the clown anyway lol.
---
*All the other kids with the pumped up kicks*
---
While playing legion of course
---
I clicked it a while ago like “can’t be that bad”. 
---
Dear lord, just BrEaK tHE pALLeT
---
&gt; hat would only make sense if one of the survivors was the same rank as the killer or close to it and was 1 of an otherwise high rank SWF.
---
No, it should go the other way. The killer should be matched either higher or same rank as the highest ranked member of the SWF. SWFs have a HUGE advantage and to compensate for that the game should be pitting SWFs vs better skilled killers.. not equal or less. 
---
So now it is totally useless
---
Michael is a super balanced killer, and there are ways to counter pretty much everything he’s got. The way he can just be behind you without you noticing is also probably the closest thing this game has to actually fitting into the horror genre it’s marketed as being in. He’s the perfect example of what a killer in DBD should be like. What don’t you like about playing against him?
---
&gt;fixed an issue where the killers could win
---
fixed an issue where the survivors could escape

---
Everything 
---
Yes. Survivors can no longer see the killer's perks until the game is completely over. To combat the issue of SWF groups telling their friends what the killer's perks were.
---
Every Michael I go against always has fucking infinite tier fucking 3 it's shit makes me get depression
---
Damn that's awful omg
---
Yeah im on xbox. I figured they changed both console platforms. Kinda weird to just switch it up on one platform and neglect the other... but then again it was weird to begin with that console had 100 vs PC’s 20. Never understood why they did that in the first place.
---
In all honesty do you think that if they took pride in their product they would push out such bug ridden code?   
---
This game is starting to take the same road that Friday The 13th: The Game took.  They knew the end was coming so they pushed out quick cosmetics and half-baked content to get as much money as possible.  You cannot POSSIBLY tell me the game is in a state that the Developers could be proud of?   
---
I hate going against Freddy and spirit 
---
Why did the matchmaking suddenly mess up today?? What the heck is going on lol
---
Also they like to tunnel a lot even when there's 5 gens they fucking camp when there in tier 1 and when I stunned one of em I'm apparently a toxic survivor cause they couldn't get me on tier one or 2 so they use 3 and get me which is just so really fucking ridiculous
---
Imo it's kinda dumb tho if you're not swf friends. You'd think the game would just mark if you're in a group or not, and if you aren't, then you can still see post game perks....
---
It's annoying to have to sit through the rest of the match as a rando just because you wanna see the build.
---
Odd, her MS should be 0% because in the Saw cannon &gt;!She is dead.!&lt;
---
Not just you, I get this semi-frequently. Killer just appears with no heartbeat
---
I don't mind spirit Freddy on the other hand annoys me but not too bad the only thing I don't like about him is his lunge so if I had to choose I prefer Freddy
---
That's a good start, but don't forget the "gg ez", and the occasional dash of "lol baby killer". 
---
I wasnt claiming it was fair at all and i mostly play killer and run unnerving all the time and it seems like ds hits me less when i use it
---
That power is what Legion's power *should* have been.
---
Oh it's definitely **NOT** working (this whole matchmaking issue being a case in point) but the devs are TRYING to have match making based around player experience and skill.
---
Seriously you hate Myers THAT much?. I personally find his spook factor to add to the fun but that's just opinion.
---
If you're on PC why not just leave? Like you can legit back out,  and boom they cannot be toxic to you? I don't get mad when a killer kills me,  as that's their job. I literally only get mad over being face camped,  not even really tunneling or anything lol. So, If you felt good about your 4k enjoy that shit and ignore their salt. If on ps4,  report that chat,  block em,  and enjoy knowing they now have more salt lol.
---
That makes sense, but I am an impatient person lol. I spectate when I can, but if it goes on forever then I’ll just leave. 
---
burn in hell
---
I feel like the scream from on your knees seems pretty brutal? I'd need to double check the numbers but it effectively sounds like doc's passive with an added slow? 
---
I like the slow idea for crouch walking though, could be interesting.
---
I do get that that can be frustrating, sometimes bad teammates can screw you over even if you do everything right. That’s no reason to DC, though. The only way to get better— in general, or against a specific killer like Michael— is to keep practicing. If you’re going down every time he’s in T3, there’s definitely something in your gameplay to be improved on, regardless of how good or bad the other survivors are. It’s hard to say without seeing you play, but looping is a big thing to get good at, because again, you can still loop a T3 Michael.
---
And as far as the Tombstone thing... yeah, that sucks. But 99% of Michaels in public matches won’t have one, so don’t let a few bad experiences tarnish your entire perception of the killer. Some things in this game you just gotta deal with because they suck to play against, and that’s one of them.
---
Agreed. I just wished they could at least give you the option to look at it before you leave the match.
---
I find spirit more scary with her pearl beads and just grab you off a gen at least shes something that she kinda takes skill not just stalk from a distance then get close and get to T3 and tap R2, LT, or left click
---
It's in Japanese according to Wikipedia Onryō which translates to vengeful spirit. 
---
&gt;forever
---
Mate you realize there's bleed out right? Baby killer main
---
Honestly, I would suggest playing him to appreciate how balanced he is. He has one of the most varied sets of add-ons out of any killer, where a handful have a very strong effect with downsides, several of which completely change your playstyle. His kit altogether synergizes so well with many different perk builds as well.
---
Getting one-tapped like that is never fun on the survivor side, but other than that he's one of the more exciting killers to go against because that power is such a looming threat.
---
swear to god I'll eat my own knees if there's no teaser tomorrow
---
I mean I'm always going against a Michael every game 
---
Read the rest of my comments, baby survivor main.
---
Ive played him before with the offering I was at rank 1 
---
You can’t. That’s kind of the point. Her biggest strength is her ability to mindgame survivors forcing them to abandon loops. 
---
So you traced them, that’s all you have to say. Your talented with shading just say you traced the base pose and whatnot and did the coloring and shading your self. That would prob get all the controversy to go away.
---
Couple things I have to say  
---
1. If a survivor runs you around long enough for *all 5 gens* to be completed, you should've gone after someone else. How I do it is if 1 gen is complete and I have yet to hit the survivor, I go for someone else.
---
2. Since all the gens were done, what else do survivors expect the killer to do? It honestly amazes me how short-minded some survivors can get when things don't go their way. Once the gens are complete, the killer has only one thing to do now: **Kill the survivors**
---
3. I hope the only reason you are running distressing (I think that's what the 4th perk is) is because you have nothing else, correct me if I may be wrong.
---
If i was salty I would DC but I don't lol
---
This sounds weird but she just kinda works very smoothly. At least on console. The only other killer that I have a similar feeling with is trapper. Idk how to explain it but when I play pig my hits almost always land despite survivors juking me. 
---
Either way the pose isn’t your creation, instead of saying you drew it you could say you recreated or replicated the promo art and no one would have said anything and if they did they’d look like a dick. Be proud of the shading at least, but don’t try and claim that it’s an original.
---
He said his body is ready
---
Figured this was a troll lol. Bye
---
Oh my gooooosh your leaving then to die like you should have done something like like oh my godddddd
---
Man it's been happening ALL night,  I think they had a secret meeting again. 🙃
---
Oh, they shouldn't get salty about being camped at the end game (it's just common sense), but that one Survivor was giving you good advice: break chase if a Survivor loops you too long. 
---
You don't have to play fair and you're free to get salty about a bad game, but in the picture you provided it doesn't look like the Survivors are salty about the camp, it looks more like they're trying to help you learn Killer after you had a frustrating match.
---
You didn't get genrushed, you mismanaged your time by focusing on downing a single Survivor and only got 2ks because they were stupidly altruistic and didn't expect the Insidious camp. 
---
You need to keep pressure on multiple Survivors in order to slow the game and keep gens from popping left and right. You do this by knowing when to chase and when to give up chasing someone. Try to get them to use pallets and down them, but if they keep running you and it doesn't look like you'll get them you need to break chase and head for a generator to put pressure on other Survivors.
---
If you want to play Leatherface and Insidious camp people, I can't stop you. 
---
If you want to focus on a Survivor until you down them, I can't stop you. 
---
But you shouldn't get salty about post-game salt or about them fixing all the generators, because you aren't playing the game in an friendly or optimal way.
---
Go....cleanse totems? I mean I always try to cleanse all five before I do the last gen. Sure you cant control that every time but if NOED is such a hassle for you just go do totems.
---
Maybe I think they just want me to uninstall tbh 
---
Well, I think in the sense of someone who is solo q-ing, I think they should be able to see the perks when they leave. Like, when you hit the Leave button, it gives you the option to look at those perks. However, once you do see them and you hit back, you are immediately booted out to the main menu.
---
Then again, I haven’t experienced all of the horror stories of SWF but I have heard of them. If this is a solution that works, I’ll take it.
---
This is what I get for playing survivors even if I play with friends this is my luck 
---
I mean if you got grabbed off a gen in an open map like this, you could probably stand to pay a bit more attention to your surroundings.
---
Oh hahah actually I want to see how I got grabbed hold on 
---
rip payday
---
I got scared shitless tho
---
*Doing gens, you?*
---
It looks there is a screwdriver in it that must be the problem
---
Yeah!!!
---
Sending the hate your way, bud.
---
Who types and leaves a comment that looks like that. Yikes man
---
It’s a SWF...
---
Then you're not doing it good enough. It's not that hard tbh.
---
But I was staying on that spot for minutes...If I was the one on the hook, I would always let go since it would also be easier for them to find the hatch. I guess that Feng didn't like me :/
---
4? That are completely spaced out? Like ok. Lol. Plus everyone that plays this game isn't a dude. 
---
When faced against a good killer, I like to give them props. Sucks that so many people have messages turned off, but I understand why. Its also cool when they think they are getting hatemail, but instead it's a friendly message. 
---
I was the rank 1 survivor solo queueing :)
---
Shit then I guess hiding from the killer 3 or 4 gens later wasn't good enough
---
I may hate Myers but hes a spooky boi
---
He's still a punk but instead of beating on him with sticks the whole game, you just have to tactically beat his ass so he doesn't get rage too fast. It's so much better now. Playing against good groups is now a tad bit easier now because you aren't a loser who gets knocked when raging through stuff.
---
No kidding I don’t do standoff’s it wastes way too much time.
---
I didn't mention anything regarding your gender? 
---
It just looks silly to me.
---
Its actually hard as shit to 360 no scope afterpiece tonic
---
"Sorry man" 
---
Oh God, don't tell me you're gonna try to school me on Friday. Have you ever even bothered to watch tournaments for F13? Jason can block every single attack you do before it can connect. This wastes all the counselors weapons and nabs you free hits. Please, actually know about the game before acting cocky and trying to refute a claim. 
---
Ive played a few rounds tonight and it definitely is crazy. Never seen the matchmaking so off. 
---
Only thing I see is you on a hook and there are 5 gens left. Is Myers in the pic or not? 
---
That's totally okay tho,  you can not like it. I don't mind at all. Just my 4 emojis upsetting you out of everything is funny to me. 
---
Is that Meg with her silver hair? 
---
I'd totally replace Freddy's lullaby/Terror Radius with [All I Have To Do Is Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVSoJ1F0eQ) song.
---
Michael Myers would get [Pseudo Echo's His Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj6tEDml5uo) if he's in Tier 3. [The Police's Every Breath You Take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMOGaugKpzs) if he's in Tier 2. And [Rockwell's Somebody's Watching Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YvAYIJSSZY) if he's in Tier 1.
---
As for my mains: for Huntress I'd play I'd play [Cyndi Lauper's Time After Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdQY7BusJNU), Joey would have Megalovania (you've heard it before) for the memes, and for Susie I'd play [The Ramones' I Wanna Be Sedated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm51ihfi1p4) (^(or Sheena Is A Punk Rocker, or Blitzkrieg Bop, or any of their songs tbh)).
---
Yes this is long, I like music - stop judging me!
---
Look through the hole on the car 
---
Ahhh sorry, I'll clarify a little for the first and third one.
---
&gt;It wasn't the same survivor who ran me around for all 5 gens. By the time I had downed my DS, they had popped 2 gens at once, and I was hoping they weren't running DS. They got it off, and I let them escape. Went to killer's shack, and had already got in a hit by the time one gen went off. Next two went off practically at the same time when I went to hook the one.
---
&gt;The only other perks I have are Franklin's. I haven't put much as far as BP into other killers bc of how little I play them. (Why do that when I can put all my BP into things I actually play?) Only reason Bubba is so high was because of BBQ being a teachable at 35. So I'm running Distressing for extra BP since it gives the 25% increase. Plus, if you get Basement off with Insideous (Which is my killer meme of the day, plus gotta get 4 basement kills in one game achievement) it takes away your terror radius. 
---
Probably gonna switch Deerstalker for Monitor &amp; Abuse to counteract Distressing. Doesn't give enough BP since most people seem to expect me to be running NoED. Either that or might switch Distressing for Franklin's just for meme.
---
Between the 2 cars I mean sorry
---
I can hear the Clown start to play Soulless 4
---
I say that to anyone. My own girlfriend is "man" to me because it's the way I talk. But you don't know me so I guess that's understandable. 
---
Guess what I'm trying to say is that after a while, you start to see patterns in the way people talk/type/etc and after dealing with a set amount of people who talk that way, you get used to a type of person being the same way. But I don't know you, I could be wrong.
---
This conversation is meaningless.
---
Longer base range, nothing happening during the dream transition, skillchecks during dream transition no longer waking survivors up, a little help in the chase would be nice, buff Fire Up somehow and make BW not as situational, Self Care/Adrenaline/Unbreakable/No Mither no longer wake survivors up, lockers and Distortion no longer block Freddy's power, make it easier to see in the dreamworld… I could go on, but I'm tired.
---
When gates are open there's really nothing else for the killer to do. At least OP wasn't straight up facecamping.
---
freddy still at bottom lol
---
You'd win every chase against me: I'd be too busy singing to loop.
---
Ever stealth the game for 40 minutes? Fucking madness.
---
Ah, I get what you mean now. Yeah that sucks. It just drives me crazy when people suicide bc people don't unhook them immediately. 
---
Meanwhile, on console, everyone is in sicko mode. 
---
“Technoir” would also be a really good choice since it’s got that really soft opening and interlude for when you’re in the radius but not in chase, but then drops really hard and fast.  That said, if we’re only picking songs applicable to Jacket himself as opposed to the Fans, the Son, or the Detective, then I think “Hydrogen” would be the most usable since it’s got 1 constant beat that just keeps getting more and more shit piled onto it which would make it really easy to change the intensity of the heartbeat/signify when you are in chase.
---
Exploits don't count when you talk about balance. I'm sure you've never ever played a game of F13 where a group of counselors sat together. They don't need to fight you one on one. They just need to defend objectives in a group. Cuz it's so easy to "nab free hits" when you've got 3 swinging at you in different intervals trying to stun you.
---
Obviously there was a reason for this update, they have inside knowledge on stats more than you do. You're just like every other "expert" on reddit. Acting like you're a literal pro because you've watched a tournament. You sound like a Level 150 who is just mad they can't run Jason around for 20 minutes, knocking him as he rages through doors, and stunning him if he whifs.
---
40 min Jesus what kind of matches do you have 
---
Thats rare apparently?
---
This is insane I just started watching hot fuzz recently and now it's a thing
---
That makes more sense!
---
Not gonna lie, unless I REALLY like the person I usually stay in the struggle for the BPs (I’ll attempt the 4% of course though). I’m also glitched where I permanently reset back to rank 20 anytime the app closes (or sometimes just randomly) so I’m usually with stupid newbies that don’t help do anything anyways. 
---
My only issue with anything on this list is that Jake’s Fidelity perk is actually just Hangman’s Trick. Other than that, some of these perks I’d love to run. Especially where your first 3 pallet stubs are instant breaks. Combo that with Brutal Strength and I’m good. 
---
Traced
---
Solo q on console can still send a message to another person, just because they aren't in a group 
---
Mmm depends. At least from my console days, that stuff took way too long to type for it to be worthwhile.
---
Oh you have? And Jason killed everyone, right?? You never won? Jason can block every attack even during cooldown from whiffs? On hits? On grabs? While swinging? You can stack attack speed perks. Using other perks with Legendary pink buffs for additional speed. Swinging faster than you can be hit or grabbed.
---
Casual QP in 8 stacks no teaming is literally the same as a tournaments without the "professionalism". Walk around the map together, share pocket knives, designated hitters, designated runners. 2 spray first aid perk, some have the firecracker perk. Everyone has some kind of stam perk. 2 groups, 1 repair, 1 runner, 1/2 hitters. Each Jason average kills 1-3 players. Most of the time we attempt to kill when we wait by the cops.
---
Whats so bad? 
---
If they’re smart once they finish off their Year 3 roadmap they’ll start doing licensed killers again. If they continue the 3 month release schedule the next killer would come out around June which is the same month the Child’s Play remake comes out so it’d make for some great cross promotion. Sure it’d be a technical challenge depending on the direction they go but if they put the effort into it I’m certain it would pay off big time. 
---
Wish I had footage, ran towards the hatch when trapped wasnt looking. Forgot that he easily could of placed traps. Stepped on one and he hit me on it. I click rapidly for hatch and he instead swings instead of catching me. Ohhh the post game chat was funny.
---
Now Billy, tell me who it was that bullied you.
---
 Deep throat by Cupcakke 
---
If you have a flashlight blind her. If she’s standing still you’ll get the blind, if she’s phasing you won’t.
---
Just break LOS and don’t let him stalk you easily. The only reason mikey should ever be an issue is if you are playing poorly.
---
This just happened to me twice in a row. Just doing a Laurie daily and my killer was a rank 20 Clown vs Rank 2-1-1-8. I was solo and was horrified at what went on. 
---
don't use legion plz and thank you
---
Why? 
---
Thanks like I was totally wasn't doing that the whole time thanks for the EPIC TIP Ben Shapiro approves this 👍
---
Pretty easy once you get the hang of it anymore, feels a lot smoother than it was a few years back at least 
---
I do 2 bags as "Thank" "you" when healed.  Its like Morris code with teabagging. 
---
I don't always run tombstone, but when I do I make sure to leave on bbq &amp; chilli.
---
Rancor. Can kill the obsession if all the gens are finished
---
Oh god, here you go again without watching any of the clips. First of all, Jason can swing AND throw throwing knives out of block. He can also block until they waste their weapons and then grab/slash. Even with swift attacker, if Jason is the host, he can quick block any attack. I've tested it out with sucker punch, swift attacker, you name it. Stop spouting baseless facts without any evidence. If you want more proof look up Tommy on YouTube. He has a bunch of videos that show the ways to get rid of groups of counselors. If a gang is besting your ass, go for the lone ones. If they're all eliminated then you can easily kill the group by using your block. Doesn't matter which perks you have, the block will always stop the hit and allow for a quick attack. You have to move after swinging to whiff they're attacks. Trust me, I'd know a lot more than you lol. 
---
Ohh that's what it was.  Thank you.
---
You can’t stealth against him because if he hits one person, he just has to run around for a bit in his frenzy and he can find everyone. (I personally don’t play immersed anyway, but it’s still annoying when I’m doing something and I just hear his heartbeat out of nowhere because someone else got hit
---
Understandable. I had a match in which I died first so I spectated and saw 2 other survivors also got hooked. The last survivor was Adam and he kept teabagging and pointing at them, cause we did 2 gens. They let go and Adam found the hatch. I was so mad just by watching him. Would definitely struggle if I was them.

If you are truly having issues against an infinite ew3 Michael, you weren’t doing that. At least not well. 
---
I think I gotcha.
---
Yeah, I know from experience it can be tough to get a feel for time management down. Heck, even streamers with thousands of hours in the game can mess that up from time to time.
---
I didn't know about the BM'ing, which is definitely a sucky move on their part. IMO Leatherface can be a very dangerous Killer if you've got skill using his chainsaw, so I can see using him over Doctor, especially with the busted matchmaking (I really hope they fix that sooner rather than later).
---
Good luck getting the basement achievement! If you keep at it, you'll nab it eventually.
---
Spirit Fury, Enduring pallet eating Piggy. But lately I have been doing basement Piggy. Iron Grasp, Agitation, Mad Grit and Monstrous Shrine.   Chasing survivors while carrying one of them is fun too! 
---
I hated that map when I first started playing, but now it’s my favorite as survivor along with red forest. The majority of people who hate it are people who are overly immersed.
---
Honestly I don't think she's that bad on PS4, she just requires the most practice (by a fair bit). I've got all three trophies for each of the default killers on PS4 and her three blink and grab was the only one I really had to select perks and actively practice to achieve. So I think compared to the others she just takes a lot more effort to get her to work. I did stop playing her as soon as I had the trophies and teachable perks though!
---
Also sensitivity to 100%. Had to turn it back down when I returned to other killers, but Nurse was way easier to play with the sensitivity up.
---
Well since you can suicide dive it's not holding the game hostage.
---
I really hate it as well, but I would not disconnect because of it. But I can understand those who do. 
---
The killer chose the map. Well there is no way they did that because it makes their build way more op that it already is
---
After playing nearly 500 hours of DBD, and playing at all ranks up to rank 1, I have seen this happen literally a handful of times. This is almost always because the killer refused to go more than 20 meters from the hook.
---
"Oh Lil Mandy, you so silly!" -The Huntress
---
looks like lag switch 
---
But wouldn’t that be distracting, to suddenly get a message while still playing? What about those that have it turned off?
---
Either way, it’s just a thought of what could be done.
---
You think so cause the rest of the match was fine well i wouldn't know cause I got Moried at the beginning
---
This makes more sense than anything else I'm reading here.
---
Me, a Quentin with Pharmacy and Small Game: "Am I a joke to you?"
---
what a treat
---
Bloodlust gamer.  Protip, though: iron will.
---
First of all, who even are you? What is your online presence like to even be so critical of another F13 enthusiast? To me, you're another random like I am to you. Need to be more specific when writing names. Tommy who?
---
Idk what you're on about like I don't know anything about the game. Why would you swing at a Jason in combat stance if you aren't defending OBJ? You should be running if you aren't defending and if you are coordinated then the phone is literally the easiest escape to both defend and achieve. At that point you should be running, not fighting.
---
Jason hosting isn't a problem in QP btw, sounds like a LAN thing.
---
I am confused.  Is he camping because he's at his only remaining objective?  Is he camping because he isn't leaving the hill?  What is he doing when you try to open the door?  I'm assuming he goes down to chase someone off it.  If that's the case, you hit the other door while he chases away the first.  And so forth.  Same way you break a three Gen.  Hell, the killer can't even degrade the door progress, so you're guaranteed to get it done. 
---
I had the same Thing today. But i was survivor and got matched with a r18 Killer. He had no fun and i didnt aswell. Sucks on both sides
---
Seems like a cool mirror to my Killers as Survivors! Looks like I have some competition haha
---
People don't seem to understand what holding it hostage is. I mean, look at the hatch standoff. Both sides get pissy about this, but survivors need to learn to just fucking jump. I've stood at the hatch, gotten up and got some breakfast, came back to see the survivor still tbagging on the thing.
---
In your case, the killer was playing smart. He can see both exits, why would he NOT use the hill? Had you and the other guy been smart, you could out play him.
---
Keeping the game hostage is like the killer blocking the stairs and you literally can't leave unless he hits you or you disconnect. THAT'S hostage. 
---
Those look like the Clown's default knife
---
There has definitely been a large influx of posts about bad matchmaking. Just a theory as to why it's so bad all of a sudden. As far as I've played, it's never been this bad for me
---
Happy cake day my dude
---
Oh, I would of done that, if my only other teammate wasn't useless and hiding in the grass and lockers.
---
Calm down sister. Don’t need to dc just because killers facecamp. Just hang there and let the rest do gens. Killers love dc.
---
It gets much better at higher ranks though.
---
You are most definitely going to keep experiencing that. 
---
 
---
The nod &amp; then the knife looking like the middle finger. Perfection.
---
Thank you.
---
You had crows on locker. Because the same amount that circle you, are on the locker. Maybe killer didn't know about it too.
---
there is no ingame setting for VSync, you need to go on the files or smth
---
I'm deleting this post, sick of getting down voted and reported for nothing. Lmao. 
---
In that case, me being smart was dying. Since the other survivor was just hiding waiting for me to do something, or the killer to leave.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/khDFvrs](https://imgur.com/a/khDFvrs)  
---
seriously, look at this.
---
Wheres Nea?
---
Damn. This is so satisfying
---
I definitely should of died. Infinite Tier 3 Myers, Dying Light, only one gen done...
---
Some play with music and most I know that have messages off normally play killer as they get the most salt from the game
---
They are clearly testing out some bew matchmaking formula. Its been like this all day
---
Good for you; it happens at least once per day for me, killer side and survivor side. 
---
Only if you just walked up to them and let them beat you into a pulp.
---
Pre-Rage Buff you had to be sneaky, and use Knives, Stalk, Shift, Blocking, Fear, Counselor's Limited Stamina, and Slashing to your advantage. If you had a good group of Counselors you actually had to work and strategize to kill everyone.
---
Two Chads with baseball bats? (Shift-Slash, try to bait swings, throw knives if they use a window, run out their stamina by making them dodge Shift-Grabs, block their swings. Once one is down, limp the other one, Grab/Slash them, and kill them.) Or a Deborah with a battery? (Unless she has a knife she'll have to trip your trap. Let her. Once the trap pops, Morph over, hit her with a throwing knife to cancel her Medspray heal and then Grab or Slash to finish her off. If she uses a PK, awesome, now there's one less PK to deal with) All three at the car? (Use knives to kill Deborah or at the very least prevent the Repair. Deal with Chads as above while making sure Deborah doesn't fix the car.)
---
Now that Jason is immune to stuns in Rage all you have to do is trap objectives, cut the lights, spam the slash button, and eventually everyone will die.
---
I love that one
---
Lmao
---
We're talking about rancor generally, the one shot and mori without being hooked is a bullshit ability.
---
Lack of killers and the rank 7 was probably swf. I'm see it frequently in the morning/afternoon when player counts are low.
---
I suck with the pig, can you give me some tips and tell me the good perks and add on builds?
---
You too! :)
---
Survivors are basically pigs in a slaughterhouse and killer are slaughterers with rifles, machetes and power armor and they will still say killing the pigs is too hard because they are slightly muddy.

1- Were they a good survivor? I try to reward skilled players and compliment them after the match.
---
2- Was the entire team unskilled? I typically feel bad to 4K a poor playing team.
---
3- Did they gen lock? Putting themselves in a no-win scenario is a team effort, so I let one go.
---
Typically, if someone DCs early or at the beginning, I'll try to hook everyone twice, then put in a good chase before letting everyone go.... Except Dwight. Locker junkies get 3 hooked.
---
&gt; Risk/Reward: Not much of a downside using the perk, yet a huge advantage when used successfully.
---
You mean like every killer perk too...
---
I moonwalk at 144 fps. Google it. Unlocking is against ToS and IS bannable!
---
I really like design of the outfits, especially Susie's (who's rocking the same single-pringle dance I did at Homecoming) and Frank's (I love the jagged crown on his mask!), but those knives kinda look like ones that belong to our resident T H I C C B O I (AKA Clown).
---
In short, yes it's camping, but it's a much more viable strategy once the exit gates are open.
---
Face camping, specifically, was a method used in the before time, when a killer could stand in front of a survivor and it would prevent the unhook prompt from showing up.  There is no such thing any more. 
---
If you need to, it'd be hard camping. But really, how many effing distinctions of camping do you need?  Really, there's either camping because you want to be a dick, and camping because it's tactically sound at the time.  There doesn't need to be hard, soft, proxy, teleport, Gen, hill, gate, whatever the hell terms... Especially when half the people are going to disagree on what distance counts for what and the other half think looking back across the entire map at a hook save counts as camping. 
---
Holy shit. This is going to get smacked down in court faster than a gen rush SWF. 
---
This is a joke right?
---
It's getting made bigger.  I really hope you don't have to deal with ruin or doctor a lot right now, though.  Getting better is always preferable to the activity being made easier. 
---
I would turn it on... But i dont feel like getting bricked. Haha
---
Itll release in a Bundle with Half Life 3 and Diablo 4.
---
The entity has gotten tired of your Claudette bullshit. :p
---
Flair and source please
---
Oh no Erik, watchu doin..
---
I think most people understand that.  "Gen rush" is just a convenient way to refer to the current state of survivor objectives being simple to complete and exceptionally fast if focused on. 
---
As a killer main, reading this thread makes me feel like i just watched a nature documentary. Such strange rituals these survivors have
---
But on console, last time I tried this at least, most actions are all bound to the same key, so healing will just be R3 instead of R1 and I'll still throw a pallet on top of you while you're slugged REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Haha...gen rush swf...comedy gold.
---
I think the gun should mori killers
---
What a crybaby
---
Sometimes I’ll hit somebody with the very tip of my knife on a solid 360 attempt and I’ll feel so bad lol. Feels great at the same time tho obvi
---
Get better
---
Everyone escapes death
---
I wish they'd make it at least just a little bit smaller. It's weirdly huge. Supposed to be a normal kitchen knife
---
You'll keep getting dcs.  You could be a brand new player magically at r1, and you'll still get legion dcs. 
---
I think you can go to the federal court website and look up the lawsuit? If you're so inclined, that is.
---
For people like this u just gotta tunnel when given the opportunity. Makes them angry which makes u happy. Nice trade off

tfw not sure if meme or real meme

And my claddagh is staring back at it thinking "What did I ever do to you?"

How is this holding the game hostage?

Thanks mate. I found some other reddit posts too. What is going on lmao
---
That's why I didn't get unhooked?
---
That’s the guy who sued Sony and WOW for ruining his life. Lmao

No
---
The spirit player doesn't have to start the phasewalk to "trigger" some animation. Her simply standing still IS the animation.
---
How does one spend thousands on DBD? Buying multiple accounts and buying every cosmetic on every account? 
---
You're missing my entire point. Read my comment again.
---
Man Game is falling apart but we dont give a shit  lets cater to reddit and nerf DS. 
---
Depends if you have Dead by Daylight on your consoles as well, such as the PS4, where the game is free to play and you bought microtransactions.
---
Lobby dodgers are gonna get real confused when they update the matchmaking to make it so everyone swf or not pop in at the same time. 
---
Nope, sorry bro
---
Legion main here (pls don't hit). Every f****** time I down someone they just quit the match ffs I don't even camp or tunnel. 
---
https://www.cand.uscourts.gov/newcasefeed I'm not sure how to pull up the entire document but sure enough, his lawsuit is listed here.
---
Yeah it´s annoying. I´m on pc and usually dodge only when ping is bad for survivours but they decide to stay. 
---
Masterpiece. Great work
---
Now let's ignore for a moment that this has no chance of success and is more then likely just "Fer de memez". 
---
If It would succeed, due to the hilariously outdated U. S. American legal system this could set a possible precedent allowing other studios to be sued for improvements. Atleast by U. S. citizens.
---
This potentialialy either causes post release support of games to stop, games to stop being officialy sold in U. S. territories or to cause games in the U. S. to be handled similar to those in China, meaning they are seperate versions but instead of more grind focused U. S. games get shipped as is without support.
---
Really this is the worst possible approach and is frankly insulting people that already work in an industry that is heavily plagued by overtime, poor work environment and precarious work situations. 
---

*HUUEEEHHH HEHH HEHHHHH*
---
I agree tho, Clown's VO is super amusing, and a big part of why he's enjoyable to play.
---
Actually great idea for four of them it would ne a nice set 
---
Thank you! That’s pretty dumb because my computer is like 15 years old and I hate firing it up 
---
I would play Michael and have Smooth Criminal as my terror radius. “Annie are you ok” pretty much repeatedly 
---
😂😂
---
High ping survivors are hitting me right now and lots are leaving when they are green so they must see my ping high but i have 24mbps.
---
Thanks! I put literally no effort into it so its nice to see I'm getting more credit than I deserve!
---
Make her crack her fingers like she's starting the phasewalk, then stop and don't actually phasewalk. That makes the survivor have to guess if she actually phasewalked or is just standing there. 
---
I appreciate you. Some people are so fucking butthurt about a simple stalling perk. Do you think they'd complain about Ruin if it instead made a survivor one-hittable after touching a gen? That's not a question, of course they would.
---
i think many of these would be op. but still cool ideas
---
Do you moonwalk or proxy chase though? 
---
Yo, did you trace the background?
---
They need to really remove at least 50% of the pallets from the map, make it to where survivors could only run in a straight line, and nerf breathing as well. Only then would this game be balanced enough for killers/s   
---
I'd be the first to believe that killers have it rougher of the two, but this is ridiculous. 
---
Teach me your ways, master.
---
Sounds about right. I’m sure not running Iron Maiden will profit my BP gains
---
teabagging at exit gate when you damn know killer has rancor after seeing the aura for the entire game and the exposed prompt on your skill and even more than that, a killer with a dash ability,  she deserves that for this level of cockiness and stupidity
---
Don’t why this comment was downvoted lol
---
Scream killer please?
---
Yea, and it's so easily countered since you literally see the killer's aura five times, so it's nice to see a kill from it especially on a toxic lad.
---
Gens are not the only thing this Kate done tonight ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I'm obviously talking about the killer POV, clearly. I didn't say a damn thing about survivor POV. 
---
I mean, it's not really a free kill is it. They still can hide, pallet loop, escape etc.? 
---
As much fun as to go against DS
---
Sorry, the things you listed not to say are the only things that make me happy in this game
---
I mean not black tar probably or Moon because another one is way too calm and another is uhh well hear for yourself : https://youtu.be/xgjgVP4CHyY
---
This does not hold water LMAO
---
We sure used hard evidence and facts to back up that theory, haha.
---
A mummy would definitely be a cool killer. No idea on what their power would be though. 
---
I'm in this old thread because every single day I keep digging for a teaser on the new killer, because I have almost enough shards to buy them when they come out, but I'm debating on whether or not I should spend them on the Spirit's school outfit.
---
But I just stumbled upon this thread while digging for information, and noticed we both had the same conclusion, haha.
---
I generally get at least 1 gg even witb a 4k. I dunno what this person is talking about. Only times I don't are when I completely destroy them and the lobby is silent or when they try to call me out for something I did
---
Myers above Huntress is heresy. Myers is just about snowballing but it is weak in chase.  
---
I don't think that Freddy can be higher than anything, he his addon dependant and his power, well sucks ass.
---
hAg ShOuLd Be HiGhEr
---
Your original comment says "then stop so the survivor has to question if they actually phasewalked or not". Please don't take this personal and get defensive, I just wanted to help you out man. 
---
😂😂😂
---
Yeah if i destroy someone legitimately theres a strong chance i get a silent lobby, few are too proud and berate me. if i get destroyed i ALWAYS get a gg, a 3k's are usually salt but 2k's and gg's because thewy dont feel like they lost.
---
wdym, Nurse is better than huntress as long as you know how to effectively blink.  Huntress you just need to be able to have decent aim
---
Yeah, because the survivor will be questioning if they actually phasedwalked or not because they're not moving. I don't get what point you think you have. I'm done here.
---
Yeah i made a post only a moment ago about the matchmaking and put a lot of effort into it except i suck at croppping and image composition lol.
---
I mean Bill is a veteran and killed bajillions of zombies but eh
---
Yeah you are right 
---
Candyman would be a perfect pick. He could have a bee swarm + mirror travel ability combo. Plus I mean, he has a hook hand. How much better can you get for dead by daylight, the game about hooking survivors? 
---
you are. lmao Hag is one of the stronger killer in the game and nobody is gonna argue with you if you think the opposite. We gave you argument and all you said is "not on red rank".  
---
Dude, red rank is already full of noobs, so basically you just proved how little knowledge you have.
---
legion + frank's mixtape and cold dirt + ebony mori = ez 4 survivor stabbed to death
---
you're not playing to ensure survivors have a good time hile you're going for 4mori achi anyway, so why not go full evil mode, just don't camp so survivors actually are rescued from their first hook 
---
After the gate is powered the game is pratically over for the killer unless they use end game perks. Early game perks would become useless, its already pretty bad to play killer at high rank and you want to decrease bp and make emblems harder? Do you know there is an emblem that depends on not letting people do gens...
---
Tbh just makes no sense at all...
---
Happened to me today as well, game is clearly balanced on their side unless you're playing/learning the S/A tier characters, then again it's not like the developers were brilliant enough to put a casual queue vs a ranked queue. Or one with no f\*cking teams.
---
Damn, now I want animal mask for Legion cuz he already has a jacket similar to welp... jacket's
---
They only allow consensual content. 
---
Didn't even notice until I read the comments 😂
---
You rather have the killer quit in game? If so I also want survivors to not be able to leave my lobby once they're in... cause they can't possibly chose they don't want to play in my lobby, what's that? Freedom? Wtf is that.
---
No  thanks
---
Yes really, imagine running the killer for 5 gens, your team cleanses totems so no noed, but the killer has rancor so you’re still one shot. You haven’t even been hooked and you can still get moried. It’s a stupid perk. 
---
How can you put the Trapper in M tier and the Hag in k tier? This is bullshit
---
Can someone fill me in with a bit more info? It's so hard to believe No0b3 would jump onto something like this...
---
Nea: survivors who land from a fall in your terror radius break an ankle and become injured. Jokes aside this is really good overall and kinda opens my eyes to how killers say survivors can be OP. I mean if some of our perks were changed to this for the killer I wouldnt want to go up against that. Well done.
---
Silent Hill ftw! Wish I could give gold for this.
---
Sick NOED bro
---
About the new chapter.... have they said anything about when it WILL be released
---
Salt is what they feed on. Make them starve 
---
Saving this for later
---
*Tbags in claudette*
---
It most likely has nothing to do with that... the issue is that if you start to differentiate SWF lobbies (punishing them with those restrictions) people could in a lot of cases just solo queue at the same time and end up in the same lobby.
---
What a waste of the judicial process.
---
I’ve been itching for another teaser all week. Rumor is the PTB is on Friday so maybe we’ll see the new killer then. 
---
Something only a legion main would do, what a dumbass
---
Just Myers things
---
Why leave though?
---
I know you're trolling at this point, but at least I'm not the one looking dumb to everyone, so it's gucci. 
---
None taken. 
---
*moonwalks*
---
I feel like you were the killer
---
Honestly dbd is in a horrible state, so i dont blame him for suing them lmao
---
Back in the old days I believe I saw 3 rank 1 + rank 2 against a rank 20... but that was a long time ago
---
???? Legion is the most broken killer ever, NO skill is needed, just vault pallets and git the survivors, dont even need his dumb broken add ons but if you use them he's even more unfair, or you could just moonwalk and completely counter anything the survivor does
---
They are just gonna get caught again if the killer is camping. You should know this.
---
&gt;At least get some chase points.
---
Exactly.
---
I like original moonwalk more 😢.
---
Ho do I dc here
---
I just want my jojo za wardo reference don't bully me
---
I hope you mean moonwalking as myers for fun, and not the breaking the game legion moonwalk
---
Obviously you take me for someone who’s not a fuckin asshole
---
Yeah you could do all of this but it's unfair on your team mates who still want to just enjoy the game. Especially after waiting. Stupid queue times now. 
---
I don't enjoy going or against legion but I wouldn't just quit. (I only use him if he's a daily)

Yea but that poor guy just wanted to play the game and this is what he gets, also it just encourages SwF because how will other survivors know he’s facecamping without comms
---

NotQueen said in the discord the update will come, and I quote "Soon....T...M".

Now you can interpret that in different ways, but if it's what I think we're fucked.
---
(death)
---
I'd *kill* for a true solo queue, the game simply isn't balanced around SWF.
---
This sounds too stupid to be true also where did you get this document?
---
he’s using monitor and abuse
---
Personally i think the game is at an all time record for balance, yeah end game is for survivord but still, dbd is amazing now in comparison to beofr vacuums and self care and pick up animation change and all that shit.
---
lmao! Holy Shit! I would have never seen him. 
---
EU here getting matched with asia only...
---
So pleasing
---
Oh yeah, it's a lot better than it was even just a few months ago. It just still has a long way to go. 
---
This video was frozen at the start for me and I was sitting watching it thinking the pig was just very patient.. god damnit
---
Is not a killer or survivor thing, is an asshole thing. Is toxic people that can play killer and survivor and be toxic on both, or main one thing and be toxic and then main the other and still be toxic.
---
Trapper is close second ;)
---
Yup. You engage in chases with your obsession, leave them, kill everyone else pre-end game. If they manage to finish all 5 gens you can kill your obsession as Rancor completely trumps Decisive Strike and traditional mori rules. 
---
Yeah definitely, i would love a rework of all the older killers add-ons to be more.like the wraiths where they dramatically alter gameplay dtyle rather than just "you do this action faster", the hags is a good example also, no telportaion but body block, no phantasm etc.
---
Trappers and billys for example is just " a shit part of base poweris less shit" rather than something interesting.
---
Its fine imo...
---
If all the gens are done, then its entirely up to the killer if he wants to defend that hook / use it as bait  or chase more kills before they escape. Sure  it sucks to be the guy who gets caught at the end , but thats what adds to the excitement and thrill of the game, i dont think the killers owe it to the survivors to "be fair" , its up to the game designers to worry about that.
---
why are killers expected to give more chances to the surviviors ?      if you got caught.... you got caught !
---
same for survivors who get salty if you down them right after they managed to escape of the hook "you gotta respect the 4%"      um ..... why ?  
---
I dont understand that logic at all, its not like the survivors will let you hook them after you had a long chase and they escaped.  
---
"Oh hey i looped you for a long while so i gonna let you hook me cuz u deserve it."  
---
Besides camping is an acceptable thing to do, if the survivors want to counter it, they can just go do gens to force the killer to abandon the hook.
---
If the survivors are too dumb to realise that, then its their problem.
---
I've had games when i was playing cannibal and had a guy on the hook while all the other surviviors were trying to do a rescue. As far as am concerned, i've got all the survivors locked down doing diddly while one of them is dying on the hook. I got ZERO reasons to be elsewhere
---
If only people played by the golden rule :(
---
Michael's knife in the movies was 17 inches long. I think they did a good job on it. 
---
This perfectly describes the situation and most issues with this game.
---
Okay so I would like to correct you on one specific thing: You haven't described any toxic actions you did as a killer
---
Tunneling and slugging are strategies, just like survivors rushing gens is a strategy. Just because one side does not like it does not make it toxic. Facecamping, hitting a survivor on hook, watching a slugged person bleed out, etc are toxic killer behaviours. But using a strategy is not.
---
Just like using an offering for a farm map or even using flashlights in general as a survivor isn't toxic, although it is very annoying for the killer. Sabotaging hooks isn't toxic, just a strategy. However tbagging, flashlight clicking, sandbagging teammates, etc are toxic survivor behaviours. 
---
Just because a strategy is unfair or annoying does not make it toxic.
---
Well in SSBU you pay for access to online then matchmaking sets you against someone in brazil so the fight is a fucking slideshow so at least dbd only has its own problems.

---
you should right click on the GameUserSettings.ini and click properties and make it read only. make sure your game is not open when you do this
---
It only gets worse on both sides, but occasionally you get genuine people who say gg and might even compliment some aspect of the match. 90% of the time people are just pricks because their fragile ego can't handle pixels not going their way. Just gg and leave its not worth arguing made up rules or percieved injustices in the game focus on your blood point economy and ignore the children.
---
Wait toxic people play legion? I thought the reason legion was so annoying to play against was because they have no counterplay? 
---
I agree with you on the most part. I don't mind flashlights, toolboxes, offerings or even perks like DS. Those are in game elements that exist for the purpose of getting an advantage over the killer. What I DO mind is that usually those items are glued to survivors that just teabag and try to prove themselves they are better than the killer.
---
On the other part, I always hate when a killer tunnels me, so I try to avoid that at all costs. Some may see it as a strategy, just like you said, but I consider it toxic. I simply don't like it. Just when a survivor gets on my nerves is when I go straight after them (like with this Bill). So that's my sin for so to speak. 
---
Disclaimer: do not do this if you're a masochist.
---
Wait is the new killer coming out?
---
Ok let's assume this is real.
---
1. It's depressing that people dumb enough to do this have the disposable income to do this.
---
2. These are games that are regularly updated and have regular bug fixes and patches. Sure, a lot of bugs remain or are recurring (or at least show the same symptoms in game) but they are clearly not doing NOTHING. It would surely be simple enough to prove that fixes happen and are part of regular patches. Money is great, but they can't just snap their fingers and a bug's gone, especially with the way their game is made of spaghetti code.
---
3. This has a LOT of assumptions about their financial situation, yeah they sell cosmetics but there's no proof of how much that actually rakes in, let alone how much of that goes towards consistent pay for potentially growing companies.
---
4. Where, in spending your money on the game, did it say "Spend X dollars on hats with the expectation that bug Y will be fixed?" Where do you get off being the one to decide a companies priorities with their product? Sure, we all want bug fixes, optimisation, etc, but me buying DLC doesn't give me the right to barge into BHVR headquarters and go "right, well, I lagged and got hit at a window and I paid you $10, see you in court."
---
5. Some of these players are cross-platform perma-banned. They should technically NEVER see any benefit from improvements to the game. What sort of judge isn't going to see that this is just angry basement dwellers trying to get back at a company that banned them?
---
This sub contains mostly bad killers lol
---
actually i got to add this.  
---
I was trolling around in my last 10  games with basement cannibal, am suprised how amused survivors have been about it.
---
i have been expecting a huge river of toxic salt post game chat but everyone is having a laugh , even swf groups.
---
I take insidious and hide in the basement all game till some poor sucker gets curious, i usually end up with anything from 1-4k.
---
i usually thank them for coming to my basement party.....  
---
 then I get a reply with something along the lines of   
---
"you funny bastard,  omg that was fking terrifying. you scared the shit out of us"
---
Lmao if only you actually needed braincells to play killer
---
I had a game with huntress where i failed a healing skill check in front of a locker in suffocation pit map. She thought i jumped into one and start turn around like that Myer and keep nodding in front of it. I was laughing so hard and even harder when she didnt find anything from the lockers. I went there and start pointing at her and she knows that i was laughing at her coz she was looking down to the ground and then she left. Later give me hatch and had a nice after game chat.
---
Hillbilly looking down from heaven: Please let my child go
---
The game is dead because its not very good, atleast imo
---
the last one, that doc probably saw you but had an urgent appointment to get to :P
---
Friend of me her adrenaline didnt pop at all cuz she was mending the deep wounds effect
---
Dying Light was always gross, but it's only really affected if you aggressively tunnel after it's active. It's also assuming many people will still bring DS when it's a much more situational perk, and not a perk that has a significant impact in nearly every game regardless of what happens.
---
yegh, noed
---
I guess the tm was more of a movie tm and not tomorrow, otherwise it wouldn’t make sense to write soon
---
The game is pretty balanced now. Op things for both sides got removed. Of course there are some things that still need balancing but it's pretty good now for both 
---
The most annoying thing for me is the hook rushers (as freddy).
---
Ive getting deja vu from watching this like i seen it before (im not being sarcastic if it has been posted before)
---
Then you get the “fucking camper” 
---
His face right between the car and rock I think it is
---
Hahaha thank you! I didn't know it was until you sent that :)
---
Nah not really, if I have a shit game I'll often camp at the end. Teammates will often go for the save even in the riskiest situations and you can get a shittone of points out of them trading who's on the hook a few times, regardless of whether anyone dies or not. Though that's not with tunnelling so DS wouldn't really be an issue.
---
Eh idk about that. 
---
But there are a crap ton of pallets on that map, especially downstairs. I was eating them all day.
---
I've quit playing. After 1200 hours I still loved this game but I just cant deal with it anymore.
---
Wait what, you're immune if you're downed?
---
There's a special place in hell for people like that
---
The masked oink strikes again
---
Please use the [Megathread.](https://redd.it/aqchce)
---
Uh. Yeah. Every time.
---
Ouch oof owie I got poked 34 times with a pocket knife, better take it easy for 7 seconds in a bush
---
Has noob3 and that dumbass kitty aswell, well enjoy being looked down upon for acting like a re teen for sueing a company that started ur careers u unentitled brats.
---
I agree with you on all of that, I’m tired of being the one to say it I wanted to hear it from someone else thank you 🙌🙌
---
It hurts when the killer says gg even though 2 or 3 people DCed, leaving you with 5 or 4 gens to complete.
---
You can be hit by 4, but it's determined by your playstyle instead of being repeated drops just because "fuck you this perk does that on everyone." Maybe after 2 DSes stop tunnelling?
---
It's very similar to noed now, you don't know the perk is coming, so even when it isn't there you should think twice about tunnelling/genrushing and ignoring totems. Basically discourage behaviours that the other sides don't enjoy by having potential perks that MAY come into play.
---
I Believe The Answer Would Be "Yes".
---
to be fair wraith is the second weakest killer in this game
---
I don't necessarily have to ignore the obsession to get all 8 stacks as well as the Rancor Mori. Rancor makes building up stacks for the endgame easier (at least in my experience) since the obsession has to actively avoid me after a certain point (I'd say maybe by the time 2 gens are left?) or else they get punished for it.
---
It also helps to find the obsession first since I can tunnel them for 2 hooks at the start of the game and right after that they'll avoid me even more on top of the Rancor throughout the rest of the game. Hope this makes sense.
---
thats a minority 
---
I always say GG but people are so rude
---
I bet it was (Ped)Ocido who started it
---
Dude, bloody well done you’re brilliant 
---
They have a type of servers to have people host a lobby, right?
---
Amen, well done. 
---
Uhh no
---
You like seven? This whole thing died years ago, it’s super childish the whole ‘PC Master Race’ thing.

Freddy actually has collision with the flashlight, so if you aim it somewhere and it stops short, you know he is there. Not sure how it is with the spirit, considerably harder to test with her speed and being able to just hit you, as well as giving your location away? Probably, I have not seen people use flashlights when in phasewalk, so not sure if the light beam gets rendered for the spirit
---
Because he’s dumb and has always been, as proven now. 
---
Yeah... Matchmaking kind of sucks at times.
---
Yeah, that makes sense. I'll try that out see how it works.
---
Candyman used to terrify me as a kid. I would *love* to see him in the game, and not even for this silly bee meme. Hehe. Beeme.
---
really they should remove Lightburn from Wraith anyway. Its just mean.
---
its a joke, it also says no offense dont be such a feminist
---
makes sense
---
&gt;Yeah... Matchmaking kind of sucks at times.
---
MM is most likely broken at the moment. More than usual. 
---
Why does everyone think its a bee?
---
if theres a penalty for camping survivors there needs to be a penalty for killers that stay next to the hook too long, ultimately i do get how it adds to experience as in if youre a survivor trying to save that person you should check your surroundings before emerging, but that whole concept is lost at the point where the killer literally just walks around the hook until the survivor is dead
---
i think this is a cool idea because it makes survivors cleanse dull totems too, wich no other perk is rewarding acording to my knowlegde
---
Yep
---
matchmaking is really screwed up at the moment, not only is it difficult to find games, if and when i find one, the ping is in the hundreds so it's either play the game with 300+ ping or don't play the game at all. i wonder what the devs are doing and i don't mean that in a mean-spirited way.
---
Looks liie bubbas ethernet saw one too many 360's
---
Fuck chasing people then. You could just Ruin a 3 gen and cancer them out every game. Ruin is fine as is.
---
no offence, but daaaamn your camera movement gives me aids, and the fact you wasted godpallet like that
---
k
---
Hey wait, a second. It was my turn to post it....

Maneater while playing Hag
---
I’m a consolepleb in rank 20 if that’s an excuse
---
Why are you deniying the fact that console players are mostly casuals when its a fact 
---
Holy shit this is amazing. I don't particularly like pig but this is amazing 
---
Has Dead By Daylight fixed the huntress hatchet hitboxes?
---
Yeah, I thought so.
---
I've caught many a survivor vaulting it's weird. 
---
Can’t the survivor just snap one trap then start the hatch standoff?
---
I'm loving Whispers and Spies. I'm leveling nurse now as I want Calling, holy hell she is a steep curve but I want to master it. I know I suck, a lot, but I'll keep trying.

Way too many
---
Narrator: it was that bad
---
I'm not too sure about the Legion aspect of this since I pretty much stopped playing DBD when legion was released, but even in the hands of a good player, Legion still seems boring to play with/against imo. While Limbo is only bad in the hands of a bad, inexperienced player or a complete troll. But yeah, won't oppose the fact that Limbo can cause insta disconnects.
---
Had a few of these last night, thankfully the survivors were chill and friendly. 
---
This only tells us to case is real. My question is where did op get this very clear scan of the original document filled. Is op Erik Estavillo or related to him? Also Ochido, Noob3, and KittyChipz being listed doesn't mean they're part of the lawsuit. This idiot listed Winona Ryder and Depeche Mode when he sued WoW.
---
i absolutely hate bad limbos and i'm a legion main (no franks tho) so what does this make me?
---
Name: the hooker
---
Didn't want to show the result? Lol
---
it's Nea
---
What the actual fuck
---
Somebody just died there yes
---
Its funny that with current hit boxes, you would have gotten hit lol
---
I fel like there has been a lot of these kind of matchmaking failures today.
---
Was that an actual person?
---
Actually yes
---
From the matches I have had against Legion, there was only 3 or 4 that either used moonwalking and sent "gg ez"/"get outplayed" messages, or they just hook slapped people for 120 seconds at 5 or 4 gens left. But with the rest of the Legion games I've had, they just use Frenzy like the power describes (running around and stabbing different people) with only brown or yellow add-ons with the occasional one that made their TR affect the entire map while in frenzy, yet it quickly turns into a 2v1 or a 1v1 the moment the deep wound effect shows up.  
---
Though to answer your question, there are definitely some rather rude individuals who take advantage of chase mechanics with the dreaded add-on combo, but a lot of the other legions just want to play the game as normal and have fun with them, despite their extremely prominent problems.
---
What could a guide on toolboxes possible be useful for? I’m assuming it’s just spitting out numbers?
---
Where’s the blood wtf
---
The mountain vs the Viper.
---
Yeah it’s weird, we also have to sacrifice 1000 survivors instead of 500, and cleanse 100 hex totems instead of 20? If I’m correct? makes no sense really 
---
In his body i hope
---
wtf is this on the dbd reddit man
---
What’s wrong with Ruin?
---
I just need Some upvotes, thats it
---
"Immortality to literally everything" makes no sense. 
---
Your post reminds me of the Shrek L4D2 tank mod, though.
---
Mori deserved!
---
Was she a p3?
---
What makes you think it’s coming out at this time?
---
Matchmaking is broken And its kinda unfair
---
Noed on wraith may be predictable but it’s a lot of time a much needed perk for him
---
Yeah I hope it’s fixed soon but I still enjoy playing, it helps me learn when they’re a lot better sometimes because I die early and can spectate the good players lol 
---
I am fairly sure that in dead by daylight lore, anyone in the entity's realm has already died.
---
As long as someone is doing the family repost tradition this week, we’ll be fine 
---
I don’t feel like typing everything I wanted to say so I’m just gonna keep it short and to the point. Buff Survivor BP for side objectives and everything will get better. WGLF is fine. BBQ is fine. The base points are what’s to blame. Have a good one. ❤️
---
No but distortion means he does not need to go in a locker.
---
Well, I'm not exactly looking to make it a meta perk. I'm just wanting to make it more worthwhile on its own.  
---
I like to stay realistic with my ideas.
---
very ballsy with rancor on. play stupid games, win stupid prizes. 
---
How much time it saves overall in a match if used to repair gens.
---
What's ahs?
---
After everything you said and wrote, I honestly think you either have no idea what "Tracing" means or are acting dumb. It's obvious to everybody - even non-artists - that you used the original DBD drawing of the clown as reference for yours. It's the same, besides the points you mentioned, but that literally doesn't matter in your case. Tracing doesn't mean you copy everything, you're not a damn printer. Of course you can't do it the same way the other artist did, but you still traced the whole pose! If you want to learn to draw, try to make your own poses. You can still use references since nobody can remember the exact details (like clothes and stuff) , but don't copy the whole piece. Jeez.
---
However, I think you did a good job on the coloring and shading. Keep trying, but please, don't copy other artists work. If you drew something from your mind, wouldn't you be upset if somebody else traced (basically stealing) and claimed it as their own? 
---
I was wondering this myself as it's supposed to be every other Thursday.
---
I think they are keeping it low until the shits storm from the Moonrise event settles down. 
---
They're also late with giving us the next chapter teasers (if by going by their previous track records).
---
Claudette consented by readying up
---
Got it.
---
No, it’s just the Pig got close to the exit gates so it looked like Blood Warden when it was just the effect to stop the killer from following the survivors out lol
---
Decent list, though I think Freddy's isn't too bad, and I like Huntress' as well, just because of how brutal it is.  I also hate Billy's and Myers. 
---
I wasn't here for the Moonrise event, what happened?
---
Yeah that’s the one. 
---
stealth update?
---
Actually, I was in swf with the rank 19, she just started and didn’t wanted to smurf
---
He's just letting you know that he was in the pool, it's shrinkage.
---
He still doesn’t deserve to be bullied
---
It wasn't well received:
---
* Points were survivor favoured so there were a lack of killers online that caused long lobby wait times.
---
* Killers had to work harder to obtain maximum points, but still achieved less than what survivors could get.
---
* Wait times meant it was much harder to obtain all coins before the event ends unless you play all day everyday.
---
* Points were only changed, upon feedback, after the event was already half way done. 
---
* Point system caused survivors to work against each other by not completing the objectives. Eg. Grabbing a lantern and go hiding for the rest of the game to exit with lots of points. 
---
Oh damn that is satisfying. 
---
Lol I hate camping and all (As I am actually a survivor main, just playing killers for achievements. Bubba's my highest level killer with best build) but it doesn't take SWF with comms to figure that if two people are immediately downed in basement to figure it's a basement dwelling killer. It's more of common sense then anything.
---
In this particular case, I camped at the end of the game on a non-basement hook, where it was my first hook of the game. Did it because I knew it would be easy hooks. They fell for it three different times. At that point, then I feel it's more the survivor's fault for falling for it so many times...
---
I'm a Survivor main, and if I see two people get insta-downed like that from a camp or a pseudo-camp, I'm not going for the save. I don't run Borrowed Time, so I'd just be feeding. There are 4 people on the team, so even if two are in the basement, as long as they struggle, the killer won't leave. So even if the other two work on gens, and if your third person decided to join the basement party for whatever reason, the last guy can just wait it out and look for hatch. Might be seen as a scummy move, but if the killer is going to play like that, then it's only fair for a survivor to be able to do the same. It's not a hard build to counter without SWF. Unless your team had a God awful start and fed, it's not hard. (But you're always going to have games like that in solo-queue, campers or not.)
---
And considering the amount of BM I got from those survivors during the game, and the fact that they got all 5 gens done with my first down... they had plenty of time to play the game, probably pip, and not fall for the same antic 3 times in a row.
---
/Tbh though, getting to play Survivor after killer is so nice and refreshing. I'll admit a part of my frustration in my original post is probably because of how unfun killer tends to be when every other survivor BMs or you get stuck with a broken matchmaker, added ontop of me just not really enjoying playing killer in general. It's not my style, but that definitely doesn't help make it any more fun either./
---
They're coming out with a new Candyman movie soon too...
---
This would be a great killer to have in DBD.
---
Technically hair is just a word we use to describe the fur on humans. There is no difference.
---
“rEmOvE No OnE eScApEs DeAtH”
---
Yeah strategic tunneling is acceptable and not toxic or anything, especially when killer games are extremely hard if you 2 hook everyone before you kill a single survivor. Even hard tunneling is only toxic if done to the same survivor over multiple games in a row (basically whenever said killer gets said survivor in a match, or at least the majority of the time), it might just be the killer's preferred playstyle and therefore not toxic, but extremely annoying to verse. 
---
The reason why there are more survivors being dicks than killers is because a killer has to throw the game and essentially de-pip if they want to be toxic (unless they've already destroyed the survivor team, which is never usually the case at higher ranks). If a survivor is a dick then they have 3 other people to essentially carry them to victory, and at the very least they'll most likely black pip because of their chase points. It's easier to be a dick when you have the advantage, and for the majority of time in a majority of games survivors will have the advantage. 
---
*Decisive Strike gets nerfed*
---
The most likely would be a reveal this thursday and ptb next tuesday, but who knows
---
it wasn’t even grammatically incorrect (unless they edited it, i am on mobile) so maybe you should go to a hospital
---
Digital style. 
---
"jUsT bReAk tHE tOtEMs."
---
Doing gens, you? 
---
That's the reason i dont really enjoy dbd anymore. Aimassist hits harder in dbd than in silver rank in csgo
---
I think there was probably a lot of studio blockades to overcome when it came to Fred, so I would not be surprised if the license holders wanted the devs to use something directly from the 2010 movie. Sadly, that was the only kill from that movie worth making into a Mori.
---
Yea everyone already knows its broken right now...
---
Yeah i was actually waiting for one lol
---
yeah, I hate when killers dodge lobby when I play surv. Especialy with those bad swf matching we get lately.
---
And actually, as killer, when I had lobbies which other killer would dodge (flashlights, P3s, someone who looks like they are loop-god to make you chase him for 5 gens) many of them were soo easy matches for me, with 4k and getting Adept achvements on killers I never play.
---
Not sure if they are overconfident, or they derp, or they simply dress and act like they were better than they actually are.. but since I did exciting Pig adept run on lobby I almost dodged, I decided not to dodge any lobby, no matter how bad it looks. you never know how you can snowball overconfidence into 4k.
---
I think a majority of the people who waste pallets don't look on here
---
One hella buff grandpa 😳🔥
---
Crawling out with a trap on the head won't detonate it, sadly I had to make that experience myself while playing Pig. Either it's a bug or it's simply the way it's intended to be.
---
Lol what a twat \^-\^
---
Oh no i wanted to say this, take my upvote then
---
Nerd it to do what? Open the door and leave. I see so many people that just hide after the last gen is popped. They hide even if no one has been hit yet. They just wait for others to open the door. Why?
---
*Clicks*
---
Nope.
---
Shockingly enough, I think most people are downvoting you because of the idiotic comment against feminism not the Legion thing! 
---
What stealth update????
---
What I try to do is usually just injure everyone I can see. Most of the time the survivors will take the time to hide and heal before resuming the generators, so that's good for me.
---
What I classify as "tunnel" is basically what you described at the end, wanting someone dead at all costs. Like, the survivor gets unhooked and healed. You find both survivors fully healed, but still go after the one that was hooked. That's tunneling for me. 
---
I understand that objectively speaking is dumb to not finish a half done task before moving to a fresh one, but yes, if I have to choose before downing someone in one hit or someone else in two hits plus a chase, I will go for the easier solution.
---
If only the devs actually had the right to add this amazing theme to the game. Here's a great example of what we'd have to expect: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2IYpJQL01M
---
^(As a killer I always enjoy these folks. I follow them, see where they are pointing and then immediately hook them.  While I won't camp then, I definitely tunnel if given the choice.  I'm only sad the other survivors don't know it and just think I'm a dick.)
---
Thank you
---
Neas a male killer
---
Agreed.
---
One of the few times I actually agree with a tier list
---
Asymmetry is kind of a key point of this game. Survivors are the strength in numbers role and as a result their power budget of perks has to take into account potentially bringing four of them. 
---
I mean, the rank 20 survivors got a great partner and the rank 20 killer got 18k BPs and a 3K.  Could be worse :).
---
Myers:hey kid you want free blood points? 
---
Me:yeah I do 
---
Myers then go ahead and do this gen I won't grab you 
---
Me:alright thanks

5 seconds later..

Truly, the scariest thing in the game if true. 
---
I definitely get Mayan vibes from this.
---
deacons of the deep confirmed
---
Only when you bring bloody party streamers so when you see him you can DC and waste the streamers that's the only fear survivors get from legion 
---
They said this killer (survivor too maybe, but let's be honest, ALL the hype for new dlc's goes to the killer) is going to be the oldest one yet, And the statement along with this picture *"In a time of darkness, some look for a light to follow"* Gives of Religious vibes imo. I'm going to make my guess that the killer is some form of crusader/knight, Or maybe a priest/cardinal.
---
Woooow look at you, being an ass to console players, we should be able to have just a good of a game as pc
---
Oh. Have they tease the survivor?
---
Why do you... talk like.... this...
---
Please, just scrolling down it’s every other one. We get it. 
---
Let’s sue them and make the Bee a real killer.

Cool, actually reminded me of my uncle who was a pro wrestler. When i was little he attended in some big tournament and got me a shirt from there. Didnt know him well either, just remember the shirt.

A knight taken straight from massacre of jerusalem maybe :?
---
this doesn't look very licensed hmm
---
lol how far did you derank?
---
relax, they will fix it
---
DEUS VULT INFINILE 
---
[I guess this one?](https://www.zerochan.net/2380999)
---
We're overdue for a holy killer.  With the sex scandal in the Catholic Church, what could be scarier?  The survivor could be a survivor of the trauma, and their perks could help them to hide in plain sight.
---
DEUS VULT INFINILE
---
In my *opinion* bubba had the best mori, just feels/looks so primal and the Tuscan raider noises afterwards!?! Icing on the mori cake. But overall I find most of the mori's to be boring and uninspired. Legions is unique in the fight back, the doctors is pretty sweet and unique. Nurses is fairly intimate and good (just wish the eyelids actually closed)the pigs is nice just for the time efficiency if nothing else. Clowns/hags is a bit gross but fitting.  Wraith, Trapper, Billy mori's all suck and leave a lot to be desired(can we get a Mortal Kombat developer in to fix these lackluster disappointments) the grabbing and pulling the survivor back as the wraith is satisfying but ends disappointingly would rather him flay their back open and remove their spine or something. As for trapper it only seems to make sense that he would set a trap and force the survivor's face/head into it. As for billy, decapitation by chainsaw maybe?
---
I use "wp" if I feel like I just got stomped and didn't stand a chance. "I didn't have a good time, but you guys played well."
---
It was so stealthy you didn't even know it was there
---
Wait so is the PTB coming out today then?
---
I thought so too, that or incan.
---
Yes. This is accurate. Though I'd like the smooch *with* the choking and stabbing, thanks!
---
Because I want, you moron
---
Hell yeah.
---
Cthulhu... does weird shit
---
If it's the oldest time my best guess would be ancient egyptian themed. It could be literally anything though.
---
It pains me to say it but I think Legion has one of the best moris
---
That better hide The Bee or this sub will riot!!
---
Np, I can fix it anyway
---
I don’t play very often, but i’ve been playing for a while. I was rank 8, he was rank 6 
---
Yeah, only met my grandpa a few times, he is very sick nowadays, i tried to find him on google but idk how he looked like when he was young, tbh i can barely remember his face right now
---
I've had that happen too, also as Pig. I like your outcome because of the mori. What I did was toss the helmet in, took them a good ways back, dropped them, then sat and idled. I don't remember how long it took him to crawl, but it was quite a while before he finally DC'd.
---
Be an asshole, get treated as one.
---
I thought yall changed this rule once people started trolling you by adding a small Billy hidden in pics
---
Found this on a website talking about the plague
---
"In the 14th century, religion held a very important place in the lives of Europeans. Moreover, people believed in God and if they were sick, they said that it was God who punished them for their sins."
---
If they follow the same formula as last dlc, this means that we’ll get a second teaser tomorrow and the PB chapter next week
---
Why is this a thing?
---
tell me...do you believe in gravity, pucci?
---
5 hours later And we have something finally
---
**Female Survivor Please**
---
I’m really feeling this picture and quote already. I’m thinking some religious cult and I’m hoping for Vampire cult leader-esque kinda things. 
---
The hunt is on
---
Soon™
---
Hold alt and press 0153  on your numpad.
---
Because there is a game in this bug somewhere
---
good luck with this one devs
---
*survivors proceed to DC*
---
Yeah, because everyone has the money to buy a gaming computer and to maintain it and replace parts every couple of years.
---
[y] u a dick'ead
---
Got fucked by a SWF yesterday with a "great" BBQ&amp;Chilli read. I hooked a Nea and saw 3 people clustered on the other side of the map. As soon as I reached them BOOM, Deliverance! The Nea tapped a 99'd gen, opened the gate and they all escaped, zooming past me at the speed of sound while taking hits for each other.
---
Also, i'm getting some Egyptian vibes, it looks like the inside of a tomb with a broken roof
---
See you in the fog tonight! 
---
I’m guessing it’s going down like a priest/monk kinda path. I’m getting more eastern monk-like from this picture, rather than like Catholic priest-like. 
---
However I kinda hope we get something more eldritch; like a cult or avatar of old gods and stuff. 
---
The little circles with the plus in it at the bottom bit remind me of a sun cross. Somebody mentioned it, but it looks slightly like an incense burner with the chains and the smoke. The bulb shape is common in orthodox churches. I doubt it'll be based on a real or still active religion, though. 
---
I always give a gg but sometimes that sets people off even more.
---
Honestly you’re right. My bad
---
So the new map is a Church?
---
 I agree, I think it is awesome that we get to see struggle
---
Ive had this happen a couple of times vsing rank 20 killers just makes me feel sad.
---
Well it affects your overall mmr
---
Where's that tattooed daddy myers when you need him.... someone recreate this in person for... reasons. 
---
Every single other PTB comes out around this time before the Chapter
---
Thanks for caring 😊
---
who is "The bee"?  I can't find anything on google  
---
They said they would never make a killer that involves religion but we’ll see.
---
Holy shit, I feel like a caveman. I was quoting literally tho, that's how she wrote it.
---
American Horror Story
---
I am having some sort of... plague doctor vibes, tbh. The ones with the creepy masks, you know. 
---
I doubt it. We just now got the teaser, while other chapters got their teasers five days before the PTB dropped, so we'll probably be seeing PTB on March 3rd.
---
No problem man! 
---
A crusader isn't a gladiator, but I'll take it!
---
Had a super fun night last night with matchmaking (console - wait times less than 10 minutes in between matches) and super cool killers. Didn’t win them all, but enjoyed the crap out of all the games. 
---
Shout out to the spirit who let me have the hatch when everyone else DC’d. I appreciate you looking the other way when I kept running face first into you 🥺 🤦🏻‍♀️  I’m sorry I’m such a potato, I appreciate you pretending not to see me. 
---
Ah i see lol
---
So my friend came up with a good idea. What if the killer is a specter inside the urn thing in the middle? That could be why it’s chained up and has a tome like thing at the bottom. New map would be the tomb and the new survivor could be a “tomb raider” that disturbed the urn and released the killer... Hmmmm
---

---
I really doubt its the first one taken, they have all been from the 20th century so far so the entity's power could have grown to reach farther back in time.
---
Downvoted u so it could stay that way
---
A Gladiator might be cool, but A Crusader falls in line with religious imagery and that's all you can think when you hear that quote.

No One Escapes Hype:
---
Every time you release a teaser, your hype increases by 100%. During this time, your follower activity is increased by 50/75/100%. Once the DLC gates are powered, experience a huge backlash from the communtiy to the hype not being lived up to.

Ugh. I wish this dude would just give up and move on.  
---
Worst part is, there are people who support and even defend his toxic ass.
---
oh then never mind, your'e not one of the deranking man children...carry on 
---
Can we just agree to IP ban the guy. VPN doesn't work so well when you have to connect to other people on peer to peer 
---
The devs actually keep decent information about their goals. It’s not a full time map like what DE did for Warframe or like Riot does for LoL but it’s not full cloak and dagger. 
---
D A R N
---
A templar? Sounds good 
---
We need a brightened version asap 
---
Little baby heads with angel wings on the border. Bayonetta confirmed
---
In what way? A VPN shouldn't be able to fully hide his ip in this game since we have to connect peer to peer which always gives away more information than it should 
---
I fight deacons with firebombs and poop.
---
I haven’t heard of that, I’ll have to check it out!
---
I think it's Anubis or a mummy. The African flag and now this?
---
'' **Anubis** is the protector of the gates to the Underworld, Osiris replaced him as the god of the dead. He looks like a man with the head of a jackal (a scavenging and hunting animal, native to Africa, that is somewhat closely related to wolves). ''
---
Pretty much, yeah. I wonder, though, would a hardware ban would be possible?

It's Baby Shark!!! 
---
Nope . Haven’t been on the game in over 3 weeks . So many better games out there . I’m happy you don’t care about the flaws the game has and allow the devs to shit on it and not care :) I’ve got over 36 days played so I love it but I’m done for long time 
---
I’d rather have this than wait 20 minutes for a game... nothing will ever make people happy
---
Is it gonna be original or paid?
---
A Mayan killer ?
---
The Great Prostitue, the oldest vocation.
---
People are saying it might be a priest, but I'd like to put a spin on that: I think they're a priest *of the Entity* who used to be a survivor. 
---
Idk I was second guessing myself bc of that but it does look kinda tomb/artifact-like and also makes sense going with the fact that it's supposed to be the "oldest killer" 
---
Agree! I love bubbas mori. The chainsaw in the middle looks soo nice and clean and the noises after the mori is just brilliant. Yeah I was actually thinking of mortal kombats fatalities, netherealm studios can assist in the mori aspect 
---
So it is you who has rung the bell of awakening 
---
I hope the survivor wont be a dexfag
---
Gotta preach the truth 
---
Like the other guys said. It was less than a month since there was a sale. They do it pretty often to attract more people to buy the game and dlcs
---
Really good call to be honest. I first thought it was egyptian or mayan and the glyphs looked like some type of bird, maybe owl, to me but it could just as well be angels.
---
Oh, I didn't know there was a statement, but I'm just talking about my hopes when they teased "oldest time" months ago and a knight is almost as good as a gladiator. :P
---
Dwight is bae!  Great escape! 
---
It's the Spanish inquisition! Nobody expects the Spanish inquisition!
---
It’s clearly the moth
---
Look for a light to follow really means praise the sun. \o/
---
&gt; but let's be honest, ALL the hype for new dlc's goes to the killer  
---
Id have the same hype for survivors if they had unique powers instead all being just skins. 
---
Like Sprint Burst could be Megs power and had unique addons. 
---
But right now every new survivor has identical bloodweb except the 3 levels where you take the teachables and go back to claudette - doesnt really compare to a killer who has a power that defines his gameplay and unique addons in bloodweb that can alter that gameplay in a significant way.
---
I hope the survivor is a crusader
---
You can change your IP address in case you didn't know
---
Upon the reveal, however, we see a shadowy figure standing on top of the corpses of every single Deacon. The shadowy figure turns his attention towards you and reveals himself to be none other than the legend, Giantdad!
---
Yeah i agree! That’d be dope or a demonic religious priest of some kind 
---
Indeed. Which is why I said sometimes. For example, if you down someone in front of a generator that's about to be completed, you should leave the guy on the floor, chase the guy working on the gen and kick the gen. Applies a lot of pressure and is smart to do. 
---
What about a flag?
---
Just a person with max endurance and shitty internet.  Rolls for days.  
---
I saw this post but there was an ad below for some Star Trek game and as I scrolled to see the image it jumped down making it seem like the ad was the video for the teaser. So it ended up making me think we were getting some kind of Star Trek killer like Kahn or a Klingon lol
---
It most likely will. We got adam and jeff back to back. Just like the killer may be a guy. Since we got spirit and legion doesnt really have a gender since its 4 people. I want a new girl survivor. Kate was cool but i want like a punk girl
---
Was Legion the 20th century?
---
I felt that way a bit about Freddy too though. He makes no sense in the lore, even the reboot version had his own realm to rule over.  Characters like that are better suited to styling their lore and abilities around a game of their own and not a game with it's already set lore.
---
Earrape the killer with high singing 🤔🤔
---
I’m a survivor main and I approve of this. Hate those stupid showoffs, just leave for crying out loud.
---
Crusader who takes shit to far? Dark ages or I inquisition dude who just purifies souls like a madman. There’s little angel heads around the gold part of the trim. And the saying “in times of darkness turn to light...etc.” The killer is a holy figure who went. It’s and the survivor will be a nun or other assistant religious figure who barely escaped.   
---
Exactly, that’s why I said “but we’ll see”.
---
ptb in next week i guess
---
I don't remember any killer getting a PTR just the day after a teaser, usually it's a couple of teasers (2-3) then full reveal and PTR the following monday.
---
two devs spent an hour talking with us yesterday in the discord so uh
---
Yes. 1990s. 
---
not to throw shade or anything, but wasnt this the guy catching shit for spamming his guides all over steam by making new accounts and posting them all over.
---
Only if its the Abridged version, cause hearing THAT one half across the map would scare the shit outta me from his sheer madness. Or kill me from laughter.
---
Anderson: By Jove, you fuckin' header of a woman! You're surrounded by fifty Nazi vampires, armed literally to the teeth, and what do you do?! You get out of your fuckin' car, pull out your sword, cut off one of their heads, and yell "Come at me, you Kraut shits!" NO WONDER Alucard wants to plow that virgin soil! I'M THINKING ABOUT GROWIN' SOME FLOWERS MYSELF!
---
Reminds me of the palace from Infinity Blade 2. Medieval killer maybe? Could be a possessed suit of armor.  
---
**THE RADIANCE**
---
...I didnt say that. on the 22nd we got an Image of Legion then on the 27th we got the PTB
---
This is spectacular, the art style makes me think of Hotline Miami if you’ve ever played that
---
Why not both?
---
i ate a cat
---
BING BONG!
---
Omfg, go watch his vids, while your at it, watch some more of his tutorials, he knows pretty much everything about the game
---
Yeah when I juke and loop as a survivor when I'm a killer main. I know I'd hate to be that killer and feel this mix of joy and shame which is what I was trying to portray
---
I would smash the bottom guy
---
With that cosmetic no one is trying to
---
thanks. i just havent really cared about their story too much.
---
Wait I responded to the wrong guy, meant to respond to the guy you responded too.
---
We knew! Reddit already knew two weeks ago that the new killer is The Bee! They laughed at us! They didn't believe us. But we knew! And here is the proof!

ah mb :P
---
AHS reference confirmed.
---
[Mozgus confirmed?](http://i.imgur.com/v50ubKu.jpg?1)
---
I'm thinking India/Tibet 
---
Or maybe a Satanic pope. 👻
---
Fingers crossed
---
Yeah BUT CAN A KNIGHT STAB TOES??
---
He won’t blink. 
---
His power, if it is a he, will probably have something to do with the holy light. 
---
never gonna happen. like 80 percent of survivors are already nea/meg/claudette. if each survivor had some unique trait that problem would become worse
---
I know a mummified beehive when I see one
---
seeing as the quote on twitter seemed very religious I am going to guess this is some sort of Christian related killer like a crusader or priest.
---
Haven't seen any for a while. 
---
Molested over 300 boys.
---
Holy Shit, I found more of my people! It's so hard for me to find people who've seen Hellsing.
---
Claudette’s are everywhere but nowhere at the same time.
---
Leatherface isn’t dead; neither is Michael technically. 
---
You mean survivor mains?
---
That isn't true.  Id rather have my money back for the game and play something that isn't endlessly frustrating.
---
It’s rewind time 
---
The first cultist, perhaps. The one who shaped the Entity's shadow in our world with rituals and flesh.
---
I like playing different survivors just for skins :D But yea, they are just skins. Ofc Claudette is unique, she can cloak.
---
Maybe giving every survivor some kind of power would be odd but buffs would be nice. Like Claudette heals faster, Meg recovers exaustion faster, Feng works a little bit faster whem working on a gen alone, Dwoght gets in/out of lockers faster etc etc.
---
Bayonets for days, buddy. Bayonets for days!
---
..I don't get it...
---
All this bee talk had me thinking Candyman 
---
I zoomed in and they look like little crosses inside circles but who knows
---
What are those things on the petal stool? They kind of look like runes. 
---
Maybe it's something along the lines of 'the cleanser' or it could be to do with a plague doctor since they relied heavily on religion in their work
---
No I mean Claudettes, she's the one all killers truly fear, yea nea's are scary, so are Laurie's, but no killer has hasn't gone against a legendary Claudette
---
Could it be the Nun? I haven't seen the movie yet so I don't know if this is in there... People have been saying that we were overdue for a copyright killer this year. Forgive me if I'm wrong.
---
Isn’t Pinhead technically a priest? His title is “Hell Priest”, after all. 
---
 Hm? Suddenly it reeks of *hypocrisy* in here. Oh if it isn't the Catholic church! And whats this? No little Timmy glued to your crotch? *Progress!*  
---
What could they be?
---
The whole thing looks more Egyptian and some sort of plague.. instead of a monk
---
You can see in the bottom left that this is at least a 3-man match. Chances are good the survivor went to the middle of the map to die or farm, and you dodged a 2-man 4-gen situation.
---
I wouldn't complain.
---
Are there perks which are good on conslole, but bad on PC? If so, which ones and why?
---
Quieten should be replaced with a choir boy and change pharmacy to a perk where you can scream and it does something the the killer XD
---
Its the exact opposite!
---
I think this has something to do with the hallowed blight event 
---
I try to main Claudette but I get dodged too much and switch to feng 
---
I can see myself being teleported and stuck in a piece of the map already
---
&gt;Edgar Allen Hoes?

[Like this?](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/634/057/206.jpg)
---
Sad to see that the hype culture will never die out. 
---
Wait, could the new killer be the Nun, the movie came out a little bit ago and people are saying the we're overdue for a copyright character.
---
Yes please
---
Power: God Loves You. The Priest uses his chain to retrain survivors while skull fucks them to death. 
---
Thanks for sharing this.
---
We really needed another one of these posts.
---
Well it’s most likely going to be their own creation, so it’ll probably be free with Iridescent Shards, but also can be paid for with Auric Cells, like Legion.
---
Possible plague doctor?
---
The game is super boring against Legions who play the character "as intended". They bypass all survivors' escape tools to land the frenzy hit, yet their base movement speed means they get looped hard, so all they really have is their frenzy. Chases usually last a long time, yet very few outplays or mind games happen.
---
And those that aren't the target of a chase just get to press M1 to mend, usually with zero killer interaction, after getting stabbed.
---
Usually the Legion gets maybe one kill, except when potato survivors start healing, or fail to abuse the lower movement speed of the killer. Yet the Legion player will still pip and get a ton of bloodpoints, so they have the illusion that they played "good".
---
It's pretty much the same on each.
---
This happened to me the other day. The killer had a Mori and a Nea would throw down pallets in front of us while we were running away. 
---
..anyone have any idea what the suspended symbol is?
---
My knowledge in Iconography is pretty much nonexistent, but for some reason it looks familiar to me.
---
There's a be^e^^e^^^e^^^^E^^eE^e?!?
---
I really hope not it's THE Nun, but a killer based on a nun would work. IMO The Nun wasn't that scary nor would her power be easy to implement/balance on the game (ghost/possession). 
---
But what do I know? Lol
---
WGLF, borrowed time? 
---
Exactly that.
---
My map i forgot.
---
Was just playing against the wraith and this dude crept up behind him as he was hooking me, both times, in a minute and a half time period, I didn't even get close to reaching stage 2, I waited longer to load into the match then I actually got to play. The Wraith downed the guy too as he took a hit each time he tried to "save" me... I'd have rage quit if I wasn't already sacrificed. Lol. Just annoying. 😓
---
Would you consider nerfing the nurse on PC and if you do, would you nerf it on console too as she is not that overpowered on console
---
Could be....
---
Time to put our thinking caps on
---
Technically Bill's perks are better on console because you don't have to level the character to unlock them for the rest of the cast.
---
This is a really interesting theory, especially given this from the story of The Nun. 
---
*The duke summoned the demonic entity through a rift in the catacombs but was killed by Christian knights, who sealed the rift with an artifact containing the blood of Jesus Christ.* 
---
It even explains the duke summoned an entity. 
---
A solid theory. 
---
Might be a thurible.
---
Byzantine cross?
---
Would you consider nerfing the nurse on PC? If you do, would you nerf it on console too as she is not that overpowered on console

Where do you guys get these teasers ?

But Legion is so OP tho. 🙄
---
You can go through your internet app and do it from there, that’s what I did
---
&gt;Fidelity: Hooks that are broken due to survivor sacrifice regenerate at 25 / 50 / 75% the normal rate.
---
But hooks broken from sacrifice don’t regenerate, only hooks sabotaged do
---
What's being changed?
---
Could the container being held be the artifact maybe. 
---
You know that pot is full of 🐝 
---
Maybe? I'm trying to pick out which things are chains suspending it and which are actually a part of the symbol.
---
I hope so, i have 9k iridescent shards just lying around.
---
When did/is the PTB coming out then?
---
Papa Emeritus with skins for each iteration 
---
+1, cant agree more. new killers are so predictable and dont change much
---
Ugh 
---
From the caption alone, I’m guessing the “time of darkness” refers to the dark ages, which falls in line with that one dev stream where one of the devs said that the next killer would be from the oldest point in time by far. This opens up the possibility to a lot of things, I’m thinking maybe a witch or something like that.
---
I'm very curious as to how does it look Aztec
---
Yes, they possibly need to take a half month hiatus, and figure out how to actually fix this game.
---
I'm so ready for more legit info about this next killer to come out so people stop spamming this stupis bullshit about "The Bee"
---
I SUPPORT THIS
---
Great work, but couldnt help but think about [https://media.giphy.com/media/l0IykOsxLECVejOzm/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0IykOsxLECVejOzm/giphy.gif)
---
Sorry, I haven't seen the movie yet. If they got it to work though... I could see her possibly being another Nurse or Something maybe. That's if they do it right.
---
I do it for wglf stacks but i run borrowed
---
Yes, Bing Bong boi’s long lost brother
---
Is there a link to a dev discussion about match making issues that many of us are currently having. I'm tired of either beating up a much lesser skilled survivor team, or getting insulted in foreign languages by higher ping teams.
---
Incense thingy
---
Ah I see they dug up my aunt.
---
It screams Tibetan monk imo. 
---
I'd expect new gamemodes when Dedicated Servers arrive. It will be a game changer for DBD (if devs doesn't completely ruin it somehow). 
---
I'm thinking the Killer might be Cain from the Bible, he IS the "Oldest" Killer seeing as he committed the first murder, according to the Bible.
---
So IDK....just my crack at a guess.
---
Probably twitter or their website
---
when they are owned, is all basis is what they were saying. they get (Are) got (owned)
---
I can't even focus on your theory. You come at me with those botched ellipses again, and we're coming to blows. It isn't mystical; you come off as slurring over deductive, man.
---
Oh, noice. Ill check. Thanks !
---
So clearly the map is going to be some sort of temple/holy place? Probably an indoor map like hospital 
---
how much salt was applied after the game, or did they just leave
---
but what about the dividing line colors? they seem to all be the same
---
Good stuff but, why is Myers so...wide? 
---
Thought that big of a difference is when the survivors got colored bright green?
---
Buff daddy Wraith 😍 owo
---
That's exactly it. 
---
A few months late on that moth meme, BHVR
---
They will fix it, they're probably trying something with the matchmaking. I know it must have been awhile but don't give up on it, it's a very fun game!
---
Imagine Bhvr cared about lore?
---
That would be awesome. 
---
Plz
---
Does that make you the one with toxic behavior then?
---
I have no idea what you just said
---
That’s different tho bc that’s my teammate. My conscience tells me I can’t leave someone behind that has helped me win this game. It’s not as much about feeling like I won when I get a 4e, at least for me.
---
Mummy was my first guess looking at the picture. That or a vampire. 
---
&gt; Otherwise it will just get boring to many people.
---
tbh this is never a game that will be exciting to most people and I don't think that should be pursued. It's pretty niche and you have to be interested in fucking tile running to actually enjoy it. If we start tossing in a bunch of shiny shit it'll start going the way of like fucking Fortnite or some shit.
---
Getting some new items in would be fine though
---
Bf suggested Vigo. 
---
I mean the game has lasted this long hasn’t it? If the game dies then shame on the devs but I think they’d be aware of it happening before it does. I personally enjoy the game as it is and look forward to each new chapter, even though I like to stick to my favorite characters.

It was an old post on this subreddit. It is suppose to be for "bullying low level killers".
---
Omg I love fat mike
---
The new killer is a karmawhore? 
---
Let me confuse you even more.
---
Peanut lives for cronch 
---
Harsh but true
---
Now that would be the best killer
---
This is the last new killer that will be added to DBD. The current rumors are that DBD2 is coming with more Friday the 13th sprinkled in. 
---
This new killer IS the bee tho
---
You quitted your English class too.

I’m not really going to pay much attention to these teasers. We’ve almost always been entirely wrong every time on these.

You forgot to add that the cosmetics themselves were subpar at best
---
Still have no idea whether it is licensed or not.
---
Legion in a nutshell before the PTB showcased him
---
imagine thinking this
---
xD
---
Or just wait a week 🤔
---
Finally, I can play as the floating golden onion
---
Me either, but I thought about the priest like on BO4 (IX map) 
---
Or we can plot ideas. Cause it's fun 
---
I hate everything about you right now
---
It’s not licensed I think because they said something about wanting to bring out more original killers. 
---
(Not sure tho)
---
Me gusta
---
Candyman should definitely be the next licensed killer to be added, he would fit the game perfectly and could have an interesting power. There's a new movie coming out soon so let's hope!
---
Lol no u 
---
Looks to me like some sort of very old hanging incense burner. Excited for new content! 
---
Hahhahahaha...fornite
---
I mean Pinhead is also known as "Hell Priest."
---
Maybe she's going to have the ability to place portals on walls and go through them but the stupid ass devs don't bother nerfing and just buff her instead and then you get called trash when you say she needs nerf even though teleporting across half the map us severely broken.
---
Maybe Chucky is in there.
---
Freddy isn't a happy camper in a literal sence either... since hooking someone wakes them up.
---
What rings you got bitch? 
---
Baby killer Git Gud Teabag
---
Hex: Claudette ground pairs well with Hex: Third Heal
---
It looks like we're about to get some Thai DLC.

---
WGLF stacks or, if they have Borrowed Time, might be trying to beat others to the unhook for Deliverance. 
---
If you can dodge a flash light you can dodge a dodge ball.
---
Really though I can count the amount of times I have been flash light as a killer in the last month.. a few but only at pallets. It takes to seconds to clear your immediate area and turn the other way and look up of they get in your way.
---
I’m a genie in a bottle,you gotta rub me the right way!!
---
The game is his sole income, it’s his living, his wage, he’s gonna do anything he can to keep exploiting donations. 
---
It's funny bc since I'm hella blind so when I first saw it I was like "what the fuck is that is that a grandfather clock?"
---
I think it either decreases the cooldown when you start charging the chainsaw and you stop (you have a small cooldown and slowndown) or when you've used the chainsaw charge and there's a cooldown, it would decrease this one. Either of those, maybe both, not sure at all honestly.
---
[They look exactly like a barn owls face.](https://d1ia71hq4oe7pn.cloudfront.net/photo/63738041-480px.jpg)
---
“The Inquisitor” would be a cool title for a killer
---
Do the killers have emotes like the survivors and if so how would one activate them?
---
Looks like a Chao head...gotta go fast

---
It's just like billy's, it takes less time to use it again (90% sure that's what it does, and it doesn't affect the stun after using it)
---
His terror radius is just All Star by Smash Mouth getting louder and louder.
---
Those were some great moves!  Your team could’ve hustled a little faster on those gens though...I mean you only had poor billy boy tied up for two years (game time).
---
no u
---
GIVE ME ACE JONES SKIN BHVR
---
Shut up, weeb
---
I really hope this is more specifically teasing the survivor. They usually tease the Killer but it would be cool if this was pointing to some kind of priest or crusader survivor instead.
---
I'm going to go ahead and assume noob3 isn't suing along with ochido, he would have to have has real name listed under plaintiff alongside him
---
It definitely seems like something mythological or something like that
---
They look exactly like the weird winged heads from most Renaissance art too. Yay teasers!
---
It looks like a plus sign. ApisPlus™ is a revolutionary breakthrough product for bees.  
---
This can't be a coincidence.
---
I think it’s called a censure

Winnie the Poo Survivor please...
---
Well I'm not as cultured as you obviously. 
---
So tired of seeing this recycled - that would be separate from the roadmap. This killer release fits in perfectly with the roadmap. 
---
Nah, you just didn’t go to catholic school for 12 years
---
I'm sorry, I can't hear you over Frank's Mixtape. 
---
I believe the flag was for Mali, not sure how much that fucks up your theory
---
What hell that must've been.
---
As an Ace main I approve of this message.
---
It was ok, people like to over exaggerate how bad it was but I like the good stuff enough to deal with the few bad things
---
Nuuu, don't!  
---
Nice doodle, dude.
---
I was drunk as fuck yesterday, my bad ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
---
It's really gotten worse lately. Had a game earlier very similar to this. A rank 20 Hag vs my SWF of 18, 13 and 10. Somehow the last slow was a Rank 2??
---
then use your eyes to read owo
---
see above. 
---
The Priest
---
Hillbilly’s design always confused me. His bio says he’s “horribly disfigured” but... how? I’ve never seen a person have whatever condition he has. It looks like things are growing off him. Almost plant-like. Also his face doesn’t look like skin, it looks like tree bark or something. 
---
*notices mori*
---
no, pls mess with me, all i like to do it fuck around!
---
lag switching doesn't affect the whole match so yeah. they wanted a gen grab so they flipped it to make sure they got you
---
It's metaphoric, you two-tap pleb. Go watch some anime and hug your body pillow waifu. 
---
Which is in Africa..
---
Someone altered their image files?
---
I mean, the Killer hosts so maybe it's something like that?
---
I remember at one point some Killers actually were able to alter the gamefiles to disable pallets.
---
Nope the survivors are too old for the priest.
---
They don’t. 
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ i was drunk when i made this. 
---
It could be a Lithuania flag actually.. Which would mean its a knight. Like maybe a holy crusader type of killer. 
---
Reported
---
PAPA EMERITUS
---
Lmao I didn’t know who that was, I was thinking “who big boy?” 
---
Ok... and why Legion 2.0? That would mean Legion is Spirit 2.0 and Spirit is Clown 2.0 and so on.
---
Is what's beside that onion-like thing important? Like pillars or something,
---
All the cenobites are servants of hell. Like, downright S&amp;M kink slaves to their master. So serving a more powerful entity does suit Pinhead. He never physically attacks people in the movies though, so he doesn't really work as a Killer in DBD, unless he monologues the Survivors to death. I guess he could technically have some kind of chain + hook weapon like from the first movie.
---
Ricardo Milos genie when
---
It might be the mummy, from the last film?
---
How creative
---
He was probably a failed siamese twin or sumthin
---
Welcome to the shithole
---
Could be a Plague Doctor 🤷‍♂️
---
Yeah you should have actually T-bagged her to death. Is not like she was going to escape in anyway, so might as well have some fun (and revenge).
---
The statue from GTA IV?
---
I agree with you quite a bit. And for me when I say Freddy is the worst killer, it’s not that dramatically worse. I only say he’s worse because the dream mechanic hurts him as much of not more than it helps him. Sure it slows things down and gives him tracking, but not being able to interact with awake survivors (combined with the number of ways to wake up) feels kind of shitty. But yeah someone who puts time into him is going to do super well with him
---
If it's the oldest entity, then it might be either a werewolf or some aztec monster sealed away behind what's on the picture. The decorations on the gold seem ancient.
---
I want the new map to be some ancient ritual chamber. That would be sick. 
---
As for the killer, I’d love a mummy or a priest/nun with the survivor being a Christian Knight. 
---
This is the first teaser. The flag thing was from a datamine and is meaningless because they use random countries to hide what they're actually working on
---
dickhead
---
I know, I'm sick of it. We *know* matchmaking is bad. Pretty sure BHVR knows matchmaking is bad. Don't need to see 100 screenshots to prove it.
---
So whats wrong with noed? I dont see a problem. 
---
Jesus it’s a fucking shitpost no one cares about your logic
---
Power: Survivors gets younger the longer they remain in the priest's terror radius.
---
Crazy
---
Which I did, and they did. I'm rank 1, this guy is rank 11. I'm not sure why I was against him anyway. 
---
But thanks for the extremely passive aggressive comment. 
---
Claudette is such a cutie, it's a shame some of the most toxic players I come across as killer or survivor are Claud mains
---
It’s a flashlight ;)
---
This man seen some things. 
---
Not just that, but balance as well. The game right now is pretty balanced and is in the best state it has ever been but there's some teensy tiny adjustments that would be nice. Some shit or decent perk buffs or reworks would be nice for killers and survivors (like the surveillance one) and just like you said game modes and new objectives. But aside from all that, I won't say no to a new killer, survivor, 6 new teachable perks and a new map(actually fuck maps but I'd take the others) 
---
Pretty sure it hit the wall behind me an hour ago.
---
&gt;I didn’t even check the subreddit, just saw a couple of them. 
---
And yet you still felt like we needed to see yours? 
---
&gt;No need to be rude, just scroll past. 
---
Sure I'll just scroll past this matchmaking post right to 3 more matchmaking posts.
---
&gt; Pretty much, yeah. I wonder, though, would a hardware ban would be possible? Having to buy a new computer entirely would be mighty inconvenient. Not to mention costly. 
---
The thing is that this is acutally what he did, he received a hardware ban on his computer and on his playstation and now he is back on the computer which means he got atleast a new motherboard.
---
What worse is that nowadays most people have phone, they could just use mobile data and connect it to pc and get other IP from Mobile service and switch back to home network. All that take less than 2 minutes
---
Fair enough. You know nothing about the killer though. I’m Rank 1 and have a level 35 hag with Ruin and NOED because I barely have any good options due to getting unlucky.
---
Only 2? Lucky you. 
---
Dude Laurie's Perk 'One to go," would be busted as shit on the doctor, I believe his power is based off terror radius so you would just be fucked. But man these perks are super well.
---
you know they announced them? And its just a few months until we get them 
---
Yeah a jackal s native to Africa but Anubis is strictly Egypt
---
Oh I thought they actually released flags as teasers, my bad
---
Don't usually get them that much. not this bad. 
---
What kind of power do you think it could have 
---
I see the fucking title. I think you missed my point that we don't need anymore matchmaking posts...

Yeah, matchmaking has been very weird lately for me too but not that bad, was getting into the character when I quoted Trapper =) nothing personal man.
---
Yeah I had garbage matchmaking later in the day yesterday, and survivors with really high ping.
---
Entity cultist maybe?
---
I agree with bee
---
Thing is the people I usually get stuck with don’t even have any good perks or know the basics of the game, if I don’t ignore them and focus on gens I won’t even get a chance because no hatch will spawn. Most people I’m with either hide in closets the entire game or are running around vaulting windows, blowing my gen, and then running off again. Like I said, if I get paired with people that do know what they are doing I’ll gladly help, but otherwise if I get hooked I’m SOL cause I’ll end up getting farmed by unknowing newbies.
---
I am aware. Are you aware how long the community has asked for them just to get cucked by Deathgarden?
---
All good then, just came across as super passive aggressive. 
---
Chill dude, I was just asking because it confused me, I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss the joke or something like that.
---
I legit stop playing the game for a few days because of this. Some days I just get pure tunneled and sandbagged. 
---
Trick is to just switch to killer. It’s weird. Having bad survivor day, it’s gonna be a good day to kill. 
---
Why??
---
So what im hearing is...
---
NOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION!!!!
---
I really feel like it’s The Nun. We haven’t got a copyright killer in a hot minute and some of this reminds me of the basement from the movie and same with that quote. I think the quote was said either at the beginning where she hangs herself or when they are going at the end to the basement with the blood of Jesus.

---
New killer is Wu Chang
---
If Claudettes did high five each other whenever they got in radius and it gave the killer a sound notification, that would be _fantastic_.
---
Oooh that would be a nasty one! Wonder how that would look like in-game...
---
He just never gives up! God damn it.
---
A lot of killers have add ons that give extra bloodpoints for the sake of messing with their power. Like Hillbilly and Cannibal have add ons that stop their chainsaws from being an instadown. Hag has one that stops her from teleporting to her traps. These are options if you want to use them, though they're certainly not my favorite.
---
And of course, BBQ and other bloodpoints perks plus bloopoint offerings. No way to get around it but Legion and Doctor are the two best killers for bloodpoint gains. 
---
Still close, still closed, hmmmmm. 
---
Eh, just practice it. I personally hate playing killer past rank 10. It’s not fun. 4 man swf is just sweaty nerd mode for killer. And the survivors just chillin out not having to work for a win. 
---
I’m enjoying survivor way more, but feel that swf kills the game. Immersion completely lost with voice chat. But this is a completely different topic. Lol

Pinhead is kinda like a priest in some way
---
Praise the sun!
---
No, more maps are needed. The game is saturated by corn, macmillan, and autohaven 
---
I think the gold is throwing me off, but quote me anyway. 
---
they were working on this at the same time as the Lunar Revel, so the mindset looks like it might be in that same avenue, maybe? 
---
Good luck figuring this out, people that are smarter than me!

Enlighten me, what is it?

Let’s get Father Martin from Outlast up in here

This is what a toxic player deserves.

" In a time of darkness, some look for a light to follow "

Dont know why, it reminds me of the mothman

An hour in and so many good idea, DEUS VULT!
---
Sadly I think it isn't a loss for him, since thats kind of an investment on his side. He gets his money by streaming and from his youtube channel so in the end it isn't much of a loss for him.
---
Moth survivor, Bee killer
---
Bottom right looks like a sarcophagus or a glorified coffin.
---
No, you seem to have mistaken me for yourself.
---
I somehow hope that the game will add new mechanics. But most likely not. 
---
&gt; But thanks for the extremely passive aggressive comment. 
---
lol you read that totally wrong 
---
Or a time if darkness is just the game itself, darkness as in dark outside. I think people may be overlooking the obvious!
---
Ayeee didnt know that.
---
This is kind of giving me Dead Space/Unitology feels
---
CAN WE COPYRIGHT PEWDIEPIE
---
It's a chained up metal slime. Release the beast!
---
“They named the band after him!”
---
I main Wraith at rank 1 every month and never run NOED crutch.  It's not needed.  Those that feel the perk is needed on anyone simply don't put the time into learning to play high pressure and efficiently in chases.  The game is in a really good place for killers now, noone needs the baby downs with NOED anymore.  It's just a lazy perk for players that don't want to put forth the effort.
---
What is with the bee thing? Where did that meme come from
---
Welcome to the party
---
Your very own dark soul character is the killer lol
---
yo spill the tea sis
---
Either this or Jake for Iron will. 
---
No killer would play a game with 4 loris. 
---
I'll take it
---
No chicken head though. :(
---
I would love to chase survivors as an edgy teenager with some goofy chicken head. lol
---
*AUDACES FORTUNA IUVAT*
---
for those bloodpoints brah
---
It's an onion. I think we really know who the next killer is. 
---
Yeah as far as I understood the lore, survivors run the trial while the entity feeds off their hope. Once their hope is gone the entity is supposed turn them into killers.
---
Or a Vampire
---
Nice.
---
I would say they game might die. It would be even more boring running meta characters every game. At least we can choose which survivor we want without worrying about perks. 
---
I didn’t read the title and was just watching and thought the huntress just didn’t see the Survivor on the gen and kept kicking it yikes. 
---
they are getting their practice in before the ds/rework 
---
since i'm sure killers are gonna run ebony moris more often HAHAHA
---
Oh god we're getting a catholic priest
---
I don’t get why people are sloppy about unhooking. At the very least, position yourself correctly, so you can take a hit for me. 
---
I run WGLF and I position myself accordingly, in case I have to eat a hit. 9/10 It works. 
---
Looks like some sort of sewer to me... but don't we have a mud monster already?
---
Thanks for letting everyone know man, the guy art is really goo
---
I suppose you're right. The dream would be an on-sight ban on both Twitch and YouTube on the accounts of toxicity. But I guess that would "be illegal, dud," and turn into a shitshow among his prepubescent fans.  
---
Not to mention getting YouTube to do literally anything is about as likely as seeing a good sequel to Halloween. ~~Please ignore the fact that I actually do like the latest Halloween movie.~~
---
The killer is satan. Oldest, biblical reference. It’s satan. 
---
I dont really have experience with being queer or anything so this might be insensitive, but I always just kind of thought people made a bigger deal of treatment of queer kids in schools. Like, I knew some gay and bi kids at my school and nobody really bothered them, but maybe that’s just because I wasn’t in one of those small town schools, I could see how people would be less accepting there
---
I figured that would be the most likely negative outcome, that Claudette would become the main killer. But it would also prevent said Claudettes from carrying any exhaustion perks and encourage stealthier gameplay from her- which, if it gets too overwhelming, the killers can use detection perks such as Bitter Murmur to help force them into a chase.
---
Original Tots H40, but rehauled by a good. Friend of mine. It was very expensive haha. 
---
I'm still trying to learn how to loop effectively. This video helped me out a lot: [OhTofu-Pallets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPr_bQdVkj0&amp;frags=pl%2Cwn) 
---
Also, keep in mind that survivors are smaller than killers, so they have a smaller area to cover. Keep hugging the walls to cover as little area as possible to get as many loops as possible :) 
---
yeah true
---
Copy[**STRIKE**](/intensifies)

some sort of malevolent spirit for a killer with a pilgrim survivor maybe?

---
Oh, shit, the killer got OP.

RIP
---
This adorable! XD
---
Also it looks like Wraith finally stopped skipping leg day!
---
Possible lovecraftian?
---
Prepare your anus ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
He does not.
---
uh huh
---
I would if I could? I'll cleanse a totem if I see it, but most of my games go one of two ways.
---
I'm either the one getting chased for multiple gens, so I can't just stop in the middle to cleanse a totem I see. Sure, I'll make a mental note of where I saw them for later, but that doesn't always matter.
---
Or I'm the only one doing gens because everybody else is too busy looking for Ruin to force through one or they're all running to unhook the newest person on hook.
---
Thanks for the sause,bruh!
---
I doubt something like that will be made, but I guess that's a possibility, just gotta wait now...
---
Also, you're so positive! I liked your attitude.
---
It's really annoying to see a DC on either side. When I play killer, it instantly becomes a farming match and I message the DCed person the scoreboard. Like, eat it. 
---
Hahaha
---
TTBV by the way
---
scarecrow just sounds way too similar to the Spirit
---
In a similar vein a friend of mine had "killer main" on her profile before with the profile being public, and she still ran ds and stuff, and one of the killers we played against said that they didn't believe she was a killer main because of her running ds and looping and such. 
---
With this, when are we expecting a reveal of the new killer?
---
It’s all tryhards rn everyone else is on apex or busy pre-ordering the division 2.

This is so cute. I wanna get lil Wraith on a button. 
---
It's Pinhead. 
---
Its funny because all the perks you show in your pic got nerfed due to killers complaining. But whatever its just a meme right 💁
---
If it's the kandarian demon and ash is the survivor I'm gonna shit myself with excitement. Couldn't find any ties really other then the necronomicon having Egyptian ties which may be symbolized in the pic. 
---
Hes bullshit and boring but hes still weak. 
---
I really hope the next killer is fun for survivors its been ages since a fun one
---
Bichael!? 
---
Her head can pop while crawling towards the exit from the outside. Since she was past a certain point by the time I put a trap on her (indicated by the fast beeping), she wouldn't have died for crawling away.
---
I'm honestly surprised he didn't do that from the start. Since console isn't the best place to start on. On another note does this mean his streaming days are over or is it possible to block out your name in streams ? Since the game mentions usernames in about three different areas.
---
I do definitely think a DC movement, similar to Legion now, is going to happen whenever there’s a suspected mori and/or there’s an OP killer add-on. Not that people don’t currently DC, I just think it’ll go way up
---
The Cultist
---
Susie's Hoodie has 1996 on it
---
What if we get the nun?
---
I'm not saying it's a licensed killer. But there is a little bit of Pinhead possibility here.   
---
"*\[to Paul while looking at the Earth\]* Glorious, is it not? The creatures who walk its surface, **always looking to the light**, never seeing the **untold oceans of darkness** beyond. There are more humans alive today than in all of its pitiful history. The Garden of Eden. A garden of flesh. "

I'm not saying that's anything solid, but that comparison COULD be drawn.

Templar/knight, Mummy/Otep seem most likely but I've never remotely come close to guessing the next killer correctly.
---
It looks good. The only problem is that he's a pretty shit mime with all his weezing
---
I actually kinda like this. It would make Tinkerer on billy even better but outside that I don’t see much use. You could use this with one of the engraving addons to increase the speed too. 
---
The only nerfs nurse needs is her omega-blink add-ons.
---
He needs counterplay. You can run all you want, he's going to hit you no matter what.
---
Its faster to be sure but now ranks have no purpose at all. Rank 20s shpuld be facing new players not veterans. 
---
I’m sure you could imagine it’s similar to Jeff but in a mask 
---
The killer dc’d and I didnt get my escape blood points 
---
Ah gotcha. Thanks! Pig was my first killer to 50 and I forgot how that worked. Nice justice boner served 
---
\{T}/
---
Hitboxes are busted.
---
I just got hit through a window despite having fast vaulted and being five feet away from the window still running away. Ping was 107 in the lobby and there were no stutters before, during, or after that hit.
---
satanic ritual
---
Ikr I don't dare play as one because of it :/
---
Nah. I don’t care at that point. If they disconnect 1 min in, it’s a boring game. I’m not playing to farm. Normally I get survivors to death hook before I kill them off anyway... unless they are really bad and run into me.
---
They went pretty good afterall, Chapter X was the one that had more backlash imo.
---
It's ur pips and ur rank dude. 👍

The new killer could be a stance switcher. Each symbol is a different form. Just spitballing here but I could be wrong since I thought Legion was a stance switcher. 
---
Rank doesn’t matter. Lol
---
* Do not participate in hate speech or bigotry (including racism, sexism and homophobia) or use slurs.
---
I’m thinking a Templar/Knight or a Roman warrior, too. Maybe even a Demon, if you look at the altar at the back.
---
The African flags are just codenames for all the killers. Legion’s flag was Kenyan, but they’re just a bunch of edgy Canadians. 
---
Definitely an upvote from me.
---
Where is the roadmap? 
---
We are a casual QP 8 stack. Sometimes we do play against randoms when someone doesn't get on. Most of the game we rush phone fuse and then just play run away. Even when a Jason from my group knows what's going on, he still can't do anything. We got firecrackers, body blocking so you can't throwing knife cancel, and the two first aid spray perk. Combat stance around box and wait for you to strike. We have very dedicated roles. Other times, we do all objectives and try to escape on car once we assert dominance with the phone box.
---
Just look at the trend lately. Rank 20 killers are being put with rank 1 survivors. Rank is pointless and you get nothing but longer queues. 
---
&gt;Dwoght gets in/out of lockers faster etc etc.

Not a fan, but you earned my upvote for making totally solid concept art.

Survivor- Making mental notes of where pallets and windows are tremendously helps loops. Windows of opportunity is a great perk for newer players. Hug walls as closely as possible without losing speed. Only experience will be able to teach you which loops are safe and how many you can get out of each one.
---
Killer- Remember that you can hug walls too, albeit you still have a larger hitbox. Learning how to mindgame and where to mindgame are very important skills. Usually you dont want to start out mindgaming and slowly ease into it. Short loops should not be mind-gamed, it's more efficient to just chase the survivor and have them throw it down on the first loop. This video helped/helps me immensely: https://youtu.be/t8u0jRxN2kQ
---
Oh I was done talking after my last comment. That's why I didn't add any substantive content to my response. 
---
Exorcist so it can posses Nea and she can actually become the killer she was meant to be 
---
God damn it Dx
---
Yet you’re still talking. 
---
Aw maybe you should complain more, THAT will definitely change something. /s
---
I am guessing it's a Hunchback of Notre Dame inspired killer.
---
PLOT TWIST, VALAK IS THE ENTITY
---
JK jk 😂, I highly doubtful that this is true, but this is really good information.
---
Yeah devs, putting stacked out survivors/killers against new players is totally the best fix for the shitty matchmaking.
---
Comupter enhance!
---
Oh shIT
---
A demon would be cool, honestly I'd love for more "magical" beings (wraith, nurse, hag, spirit) rather than another boring ass human with a knife. However this is what lead me to the Templar/Knight idea over a mummy but still hopeful(so many old school monsters just being ignored) but I'll hold out hope that one day their might be an Eldritch style killer/chapter.
---
A little convoluted I get it. I just wanted to throw my idea down fast before someone later says I stole someone's theory.ill type up a clearer picture later
---
So true.

First thing that came to my mind...made me put their music on this morning.

MARS ME ADIUVAT!
---
I quit playing killer yesterday because I kept getting matches like this. Sure it teaches you to play against “better” survivors but it really makes the game extremely tilting when you are being paired with people you aren’t experienced enough to handle. 
---
I read this in Shrek’s voice and I can’t stop laughing
---
No you're the very first person this has happened to and definitely the first person to post about it here
---
Then I guess I’ll just have to go and commit sudoku.
---
You don't say... 🙄
---
With the extra momentum from the thicc boi her hitboxes might actually make sense now.
---
Just to give a general reply to those talking about technology for hardware and IP address banning, I can tell you that actually wouldn't work.  I administrate a few small-time online games, and I've learned some things from some of our most notorious exploiters, because I was able to get a few to give up their secrets.
---
Basically, what I'm getting around to say is I know from experience that hardware bans can easily be fooled.  There are tools you can use to make your computer think it has different serial numbers.  I've tried them, and I've found it's not that hard of a process.
---
We have our own version of Ochido on our games, and there's still no way to patch against rotating serial numbers.  That said, there's really nothing anyone can do to prevent someone from playing a game that they really want to play.

He has gone to this length to try and come back to the game just leave him and let his fans enjoy his content at the end of the day he just creates more toxic survivors which we can convert to upvotes with memes. 900 IQ strat inbound!

Sunbro covenant 
---
Omg nooo I’m so sorry I ruin the game by killing as killer
---
Smash mouth all stars begins to play at full volume
---
farming is bullshit.
---
That was an obviously fake statement, though. The devs were trying to mislead us, and their only reason for not having a clown was because it was "too scary". In this case, there's a legitimate issue, which is way different. Matheiu also said this to a reporter, which is different than just playing a trick on your community.
---
How much did you teabag, did you have a flashlight, how much bm, did you hunt him for the chase to loop, etc. 
---
only if she's ***T H I C C***
---
Hoping for some kind of Pinhead like character maybe
---
Please don't abuse an already broken system just to fuck with somebody. That would make you an asshole just like Ochido
---
I thought so :)
---
ITS SHREK, PREPARE THE SWAMP OFFERINGS
---
Is that a lion from the wizard of Oz
---
Reposting my answer to the other guy.
---
Aaaaaaand now your comment has me imagining Shrek quotes in sexual context. "Donkey, what am I?" "What are you doing in my swamp?" ...... aaaaaand now I'm imagining a 50 Shades of Grey-type trailer with the Shrek cast.
---
As a non Ace main i also approve this message.
---
I'm still new to DBD and the memes, but why are Claudette Mains 'toxic' (specifically the P3)?
---
I mean it's just a game, so realistically it's all bullshit. 
---
No it isn't lol don't be that guy 
---
Predator maybe?
---
Do a digital dancing, hey this is fun!
---
You'd probably be surprised. People wear many hats in software development. 
---
It’s actually pretty common these days. It didn’t use to be. 
---
Now i’m more surprised seeing a non prayer beads spirit than one with it.
---
Mori could be him catching a survivor with his hook, and then spitting bees onto the survivor. 
---
It doesn't have to be based on a real religion. It could be a fictional cult.
---
Is he an idiot? BHVR can just track the other guys profiles and and get his name
---
Because Claudettes are master race, we are quick, quiet and skilled
---
lol you know what I mean. Farming is not fun in any way, shape, or form. The instances where I'll do that are vanishingly few
---
I would still report him, that’s really infuriating
---
For the first reference, yes, but not so much for the second one :/ 
---
That’s William Birkin, this is his stage 2 mutation after injecting himself with the G-Virus. 
---
I mean, I can get the most bloodpoints for the least effort and I get a free pip from farming. Preferences. 🤷‍♂️ 
---
So a religious-like killer? 
---
Very true, very true. I just meant we're not getting a priest or nun in the traditional sense.
---
What first teaser?
---
If i had to guess i'd definitely say it's the mummy, from the old films, or the female mummy from the new one. It'd be pretty cool, they could replace hooks with sacrificial stones and the mummy could summon dead warriors to walk around the map looking 4 survivors.
---
It's cause they run fast
---
At least you will be remembered as a hero.
---
Because it is?
---
Is there any tips or tricks into becoming a good killer? I recently just started playing as the killer and I suck at following or tracking the survivors. Whenever I chase them I usually lose them in a matter of seconds due to the looping and etc.
---
Yeah like some people saying the spirit is the girl adam saved on the train.
---
His perseverance to be an ass is admirable 
---
oh my god that'd be fucking terrifying 
---
Exactly :D
---
How'd you pull that off? 
---
I mean, he can already do the invisible wall tricks with bamboozle!
---
Haha, thanks.
---
A very big baby boy.
---
A Transformer definitely 
---
Lmao my first thought too
---
Didn’t teabag, had no flashlight or any item for that matter, didn’t bm and he was led to me by an injured survivor and then I stepped in a trap. So no, none of these. 
---
Perk Roulette is full of shit with that game on the right. Nobody is that lucky.
---
Not a good sub for straight guys 
---
Spectacular. Ps- Kudos for being on PS4. 
---
Everyone look.
---
Its AnklePickBro's secondary account after he told everyone to kill themselves. Just want everyone to be aware (if it's not already obvious from how disrespectful he speaks to people)
---
Maybe a djinn type killer, it could be a lamp.
---
now that'd be awesome
---
It's not hard to do either of those things. No need to waste everyone's time
---
Wide Myers 
---
What?
---
This sounds like it could be a priest or shaman of sorts. Didn't they say this type of killer was off limits? 
---
I think he just forgot to change his name back, because that was our last match and we were playing seriously then
---
A Vampire is my guess
---
OK. 
---
Looks like a gargoyle, Quasimodo confirmed.
---
I think it's called an onion
---
Most Spirits I play don't have it. I never use it. Vastly prefer to use the add-ons that increase duration and cool down. Maybe the poor memory of playing against beads just sticks in your mind more?
---
It’s a vampire creature of some sort.  I expect all the upvotes once this is confirmed. 
---
Well I'm a girl and why not?
---
Nahh people here exaggerate a lot if their stories. I don't get very many people in my games that straight up DC against legion yet here it's talked about non stop. 
---
Doesn´t matter if you show us NSFW stuff or regular cosplay photos. Your posts makes me happy.
---
Butt plug killer confirmed?
---
“Carefully, he’s a hero” as the killer carries me to a hook
---
There’s no level cap. After you hit 100, you’ll be Devotion 1 level 1 and gain IS all over again. There’s no foreseeable call right now. 
---
For Doctor BP, Distressing and BBQ are needed there. Iron Grasp is also great for basement builds. You can slot the 4th perk for any utility like Bamboozle or Spirit Fury to blow up pallets. 
---
Legion is my BP farm girl. All I need is BBQ and I just stab everything until it’s done bleeding. 
---
Freddy likes endgame builds when you’re confident in your power with him. Otherwise the Hulk Build (Enduring, Spirit Fury, Bamboozle and 4th perk of choice) is a solid go to. 
---
Eventually you’re gonna get all killer perks so focus on the ones that are most impactful, I’d say Enduring from Hillbilly, Spirit Fury from Spirit, Bamboozle from Clown. 
---
oh gosh thank you. i always had the sense that people are way over dramatic all the time lol
---
one time some guy tried to tell us he faced 16 decisive strikes in a row, like okay dude lol
---
Had a guy disconnect on me because I found him in a locker. Would have only been his 1st book and he decided to disconnect
---
Possible but i swear there was a time, especially after that school girl outfit was released, that the majority of spirit mains ran PB to the point where i thought damn, is the bloodweb just handing that shit out everywhere? 
---
I still see it frequently still but it could also be that I just automatically hear the phasing be muted because im just so used to playing against it. Lol 
---
And the Bride from Soul at Stake
---
*oh the sweet self care... it sings to me.  Enough to make a man sick.*
---
Honestly, I think fixing hit boxes and dedicated servers will breath a lot of life back into playing. You are getting outplayed by bugs more than killers. 360s are almost a guaranteed hit nowadays. When I play killer I even make risky swings that connect. It's so broken right now.
---
There’s little angels faces imprinted in the gold around the floating thing. It’s not Egyptian and it will probably never be a mummy
---
I’ve been having this happen too. It’s ridiculous
---
I ran into a group of rank 2s today and 4k them. 
---
oh you know what I bet it was because of the Christmas event that increased the appearance of rare items and add-ons and offerings 
---
She's fun to play against and shes one of the only scary killers there is. 
---
This looks traced
---
Maybe maybe! For now, look forward to a new killer, upcoming reworks for Freddy, Larry and Legion sometime in the future, a secondary objective for survivors at the end of the game (to slow the game down just a little bit~)
---
And aww, thanks. Nice change to Reddit’s general toxicity of being downvoted for asking genuine questions or getting trapped in echo chambers xD
---
one of those baby face angels with wings you can find flying around in a lot of Catholic Churches 
---
I’ll try it but I don’t like it. As a person who detests Legion as a killer I’ll try and see what I can do.
---
Who gives a rat's ass, I'm more surprised people here still care than the fact he hasn't moved on. 
---
The only time I went for a point was when someone got saved from basement then the savior hid in a locker instead of taking a hit.
---
Yeah, there is definitely a possibility we see him added, and holy shit that would be hype as hell.
---
It's pretty rare. These games are just more annoying to play against than normal so you remember them more. 
---
I had 4 face camps last night in a row. It made me want to put my keyboard through my monitor. I asked the killer why and the one response I got was he camps the first guy he catches, then plays normally the rest of the game. It's this new shitty strategy I don't know where it came from or why it's so popular. So yeah, maybe they figure they'll get face camped because they were caught first and the sad part is they're probably right. 
---
Oh yeah,I think one of hillbilly and Leatherfaces add-ons imply that the entity tortures then right?
---
I'll take that as a compliment 
---
If you watch closely you can see the wind from the Trapper's attack just barely caress David's bare skin. This gentle touch caused David to flinch and made his back hemorrhage.
---
The symbol in the center almost looks like a drop of nectar. You know,, like that of a bee????
---
BUT LOOK I'M RED RANK AND THE KILLER IS RANK 20 HAHA LOL ISN'T THAT A GOOD POST? XDDDDDDD
---
Well that's a stupid strategy they're just gonna get DC'd and not get kill points. Idiots.
---
The giant quota of "1"
---
It's pointless. Slowing down the chainsaw would make it worse for map control (one of Billy's biggest strengths) and worse for cutting off loops (his second biggest strength). Making it completely silent is one thing but Survivor's often don't know exactly where he is until it's too late. 
---
A better option would be this: TREMENDOUSLY decrease chainsaw charge time and MODERATELY decreases cooldown. Basically, it's Instant Saw but with only one add-on. That way, you can experiment with his other add-ons and se the Chain add-ons or Engravings. 
---
How do u main a skin?? D:
---
Tier 0. When Myers is in tier 0 he cannot be seen, heard, and hides from all aura reading perks. 0 terror radius by default. 
---
I'd say do away with rank reset and implement rank decay. Play at least once a week to stay rank 1.
---
I really want it to be some kind of crusader killer but that seems a lot like incense burning so I would lean towards it being a priest. 
---
By constantly playing her or other characters
---
Tunneling is very often the smart thing to do
---
Im horny now
---
You happen to know which ones? I wanna peep the descriptions 
---
Bet it’s a priest/nun/angel
---
Except, again, there never was any real evidence of him being a pedo. And no, Ardetha's video is no proof. And kind of proofs he shown can be made up within minutes. I am not his fan or supporter, but its rather amusing to see how people hate him and always seek a way to hate even more. And the way you give his persona so much attention, even negative one, feels like you are actually addicted to him. You say you would be happy if he gets removed. But then just cant forget about him. Seek info, sharing it, calling out for with hunt and give this guy exactly what he wants - attention. Bad or good, doesn't matter.
---
So an ancient demon? That’s possible, demons take the form of human figures so I can see that 
---
Wtf am I doing here
---
Right over your head on this one. They’re saying that those two perks are good - not that they’re toxic. The point of that cluster is to say toxic players complaining about DS being nerfed.  Like the Patrick mean on this sub. 
---
The flashlight isn’t the toxic part - it’s attempted building by chasing and clicking it trying to get them to chase you. Before you say “ any number or survs off gens is good and I ignore the ones trying “ of course it’s bad play on them- so is hook camping. It’s not fun to play against at all, especially if they’re better than you lol.
---
It’s like you saw the pictures and read “toxic” then posted you remark.
---
Oh my god yes.
---
Same day as all other platforms. Usually 2-3 weeks after we get a PTB update. 
---
Yeah, its definitely been happening much more in my experience. 
---
Kevin from the office??
---
Feng looks outstanding in both appearances. Keep up the great work!
---
the crosses and dots are very similar, and the whole look to light makes me think the next killer is conjuring related.
---
M sure he learned his lesson, and being toxic can’t get you banned. So leave hi. Alone he is just trying to make money and content for people, fucking idiots.
---
I find it depressing that he went straight for feng and tried to deny her the chance to actually play the game
---
I'd be stoked if it's The Nun
---
First off, I got my bets on either the fucking pope, a crusader, an archaeologist or Cain (the first murderer in the bible)
---
Secondly, why do people downvote discussion posts?
---
You do know all the non dlc killers are originated from points of reference from something that actually exists, right? This isn’t plagiarism, it’s literally the linking of ideas and inspiration. 
---
&lt;3
---
It's not an issue in a **horror game**, where you're supposed to be frightened. Religion is different cause the devs don't want to offend people/cultures.
---
Yeah, you know the old saying "you can't argue with stupid". It really was disheartening to see him face camp me, then play the game normally with the rest of the survivors. He even had one Ace agree with him in post chat and said it was a smart strategy. I would love to know where this new thing suddenly came from. I had a doctor chase me for so long, I got max boldness from one chase, people don't understand it ruins the game, or maybe they don't care. 
---
Claudette? 
---
"the monk" confirmed ;D
---
And he f**** up, it's only a matter of time people.
---
I think the killer will have some kind of light power and will go around blinding survivors.  He will also be immune to survivors flashlights or they will make his power recharge faster
---
Those crabs are the best thing ever you leave them alone
---
That's why I ran toward him thankfully my plan witted and the feng lived that game (only because I gave her the hatch and stopped him from grabbing her)
---
Have you played as survivor much? I tend to follow what I would do in the survivor's shoes during and chase and check places I would hide/run to nearby. Also depending on your rank, check lockers. Additionally, don't chase a survivor for too long if they keep escaping. Instead, apply pressure by surveying generators and slow the game down as much as possible. 
---
I see you are a man of culture as well
---
Legend. That's how wish the whole community was
---
Already made a post on this but I think the next killer is from the conuring, check out the runes very similar [https://i.redd.it/ou2q6r3heyi21.jpg](https://i.redd.it/ou2q6r3heyi21.jpg)
---
My sarcasm detector machine exploded.
---
Theres even an exploit to stop it. Until this new patch is out. So idk why people think its toxic and uncounterable. Look at walls or look around before picking them up. 
---
Distressing is good on Legion, what I find myself using more is Monitor and Abuse because the amount of terror radius gain you get from both is about the same, and I never worry about hitting the Deviousness point cap, because I will unnesicarily stab everyone until my Deep Cut score and Hit score are maxed. 
---
He’s a good killer, his chase game is really strong and he can get good momentum with STBFL or Brutal Strength. His map pressure is a little weak which is why he gets knocked on a bunch but a good clown can be a pain in the ass to deal with if you get found. 
---
Slender Chungus? Is that a faint bunny ear? 
---
Because it's cute as hell? 
---
r/SCP
---
Good luck pilgrim.
---
Having never watched a dev stream but kept up via other announcements and feeling decently communicated to, who gives a shit?
---
The Killer is a sentient Flashlight
---
Overused but to each their own 
---
That map is usually solid for most killers though the closed off walls until they pop gens downstairs can be an issue with hook placement.  Also if you play a lot of Trapper that is by far his worst map.  You can't hide anything on that map.
---
An onion clock? 
---
That´s stupid imo. Wrong flair?
---
You must be one of the purple/red ranks that gets matched with a rank 19-20 killer and enjoys it.  
---
Goddammit i thought i chose shitpost
---
Almost a T pose
---
do you film all your games on your phone lol 
---
Would be interesting!
---
So an Egyptian Bee then.
---
Im sorry. Kate is amazing. But i can still hear her ptb screams and it makes me like her less. 
---
Doing the Lord's work
---
Nah 
---
Lol it’s just Jeff reskined 
---
Interesting I didn’t think of that . 
---
Thank God it was that ;D
---
Most likely lol 
---
Yes it is, you can see in this iteration that theres two. I believe Billy is supposed to be a hybrid between leatherface and the hills have eyes people, but they have said that yes he has at least one failed twin inside his body
---
That Nurse one is the best. 
---
In the tall grass, they just dont want to be seen...
---
Check their wiki pages, you'll find it pretty easily.
---
Im stupid thanks for notifying me of the flair lol
---
Some people are just too stubborn for their own good...
---
and the small chainsaw gives the survivors an itch on their back they can't reach
---
Jeff, Unchanged
---
Wonderfull 👌
---
Exactly the buff he needs!
---
The only way I don’t like that map is if it’s an impossible skillcheck doc
---
Inside the left part of the circle on the edge looks like a face to me, kinda poking out of the darkness. Glasses, mouth open, possibly a hat of sorts? This true for anyone else or am I just going insane trying to grab details from nowhere?
---
So the flash light but I honestly thought I read it clicking - that’s my bad. So we both suck at reading because those perks are listed next to the “ not having many good perks” it’s just showing a list of what they deem good, doesn’t matter if we agree or not but he’s definitely not saying they’re toxic. Back to the flashlight part though.. saved aren’t toxic so again my b on that 
---
Tru was running terrible addons honestly, they work yes but they aren't great. The hindered and exhaustion one are the best because it shuts down looping as well as helps close gaps in chases. Tru is a great killer but made a lot of poor choices that match.
---
I miss her PTB screams. I wanted that to be her final voice and I was upset when they changed it. She's still my P3-50 +all perks main though ❤
---
Could not be more wrong. Every game I've had in the past week have been against red rank killers, I'm rank 9.
---
Went up against a rank 15 Legion and felt really bad. 
---
Just asking to get camped/tunneled
---
are you sure you want your meme to be  
---
[https://imgur.com/UDeQeb0](https://imgur.com/UDeQeb0) ?
---
That'd be my age screaming at me "YOU'RE FUCKING OLD BECAUSE THIS GUY HAD NO IDEA WHO GEORGE CASTANZA IS"
---
Hoo boy, I sense a religious killer incoming. 
---
I see it maybe once a week 
---
(Jake, standing 3 feet away from the exit gate and cleansing a dull totem while Huntress is right on Ace’s ass,flinging hatchets just over his shoulder)
---
“JAKE!  START THE EXIT!”
---
Bro, i have no perks, im literally a brand new account.  there is no getting around this.
---
It is hilarious to place a trap on drop down areas and on staircases so survivors when being chased hit them without any option.  Especially the uh...  The giant vat you can vault into from the top floor into the bottom floor.
---
You can't hide traps but you can place them in unavoidable areas fairly easily.
---
the hanging onion.
---
I'm thinking some type of djinn, or genie.
---
The clown kind of has a psychological impact when he's able to lov a bottle down an escape route that the survivor is heading for. Their first instinct is to avoid the gas but it usually makes them end up getting hit. I always make it a habit to aim where they would want to go instead of where they are or are going.
---
Many people are flat out giving up on dbd. It's a mess. Hitboxes, bugs, no communication methods between player and dev. Not to mention the ever growing number of toxic players. I haven't had a game in the last month where I haven't been facecamped to death or hit straight back down after being unhooked. The game is basically unplayable in its current state.
---
the smoke behind the onion maybe a face just brainstorming 
---
Wait, can this killer be attained through in game credits like most of the other killers? I'm sort of new so I have no idea how this works. 
---
I’m guessing a vampire.Been asking for this let’s see what happens 
---
I honestly can´t remember so I´ll ask here. I think i remember DLCs being on sale when the Legion patch came out, but I´m not sure. So here it goes, do they put older DLCs on sale when a new one comes out?
---
Bhvr: the matchmaking’s fixed

I still don't like it but whatever it wasn't funny any of the times I've seen it but again different strokes for different folks 
---
I really enjoy tru3 but he did a lot of mistakes. Clown power does work, but he doesn't know how to use it properly. Kinda hard to explain how to do it via Mobile but does work. Also he got unlucky with ruin getting destroyed on the first 30 secs even with thrill of the hunt.
---
 And those first chases into the building made him lose time.
---
Haha no problem ;D 
---
I'd say 4 matches double pip a week minimum to keep rank 1 honestly. Thst way you either earn your rank and keep it or get better and settle in a limbo of rank 2-1 trying to better yourself 
---
You just can't see them cause they are hiding in the grass.
---
All I see posted about tru3tal3nt anymore is him crying or complaining about something while running some terrible build. Like he used to be awesome and helpful but now all he does it complain about things.
---
Is he doing alright?
---
The little innocent smile for such a buff boi kills me
---
Except circumventing a ban is a bannable offence.
---
You can't just get banned, then work around the ban and go on as if nothing happened and expect the devs to let it slide. 
---
If you're banned, you're banned, end of discussion. No amount of alt-accounts or new hardware will magically lift it.
---
Characters, ranks, perks, match outcome  
---
I am sure it will be easy to catch him for the devs.
---
Plague Doctor time lads.
---
The game is probably the closest thing to a killer sided map in dead by daylight. 
---
Original character, so yeah. It's only the licensed characters that are cash only.
---
Love these!! Your style is so nice and clean 
---
For real?
---
I believe it's the beasts marks add-ons.
---
i know this is probably a shitpost but i would actually really like to see this girl in the game; as far as i know shes alpha meg
---
Onion Knight confirmed next Killer, lol.
---
After the last update, there was a scene where the usual opening cinematic was featuring this person running through the grass and hiding from the Trapper. Leak? Or just a new cosmetic? 
---
Yeah the shitty toxic players are on the rise lately -.-
---
Then vs the last survivor he didn't fall for any kind of  mindgame and tru3 kept doing the same shit on L/T walls and who watch tru3 knows what he is doing/trying.
---
Pretty sure The Game has the same room layout every time. The only random elements are Gen spawns, which doors are open, hooks, totems, and pallets.
---
But your banned on that account, another account shouldn’t get banned.
---
That would be awesome
---
Blame Devs
---
Question on stacking very rare offerings with teammates. 
---
If all 4 survivors used the same vary rare offering will some be pointless because they hit a cap before they all took effect? As in a limit to how thick the fog can get, how far apart the hooks can be, how much luck you can have ect...
---
Example: all 4 of us use 'greatly thicken the mist' is there a limit to the thickness?
---
I'm wondering this for all of the offerings.
---
this was the intro for the game at its release. they changed it when the console version was released, they might have changed it back. this is the original look for meg i believe
---
Adding onto your idea: he has chainsaws on his feet too.
---
Thats just how Meg was supposed to look at the start. Her appearance changed to the one we all know now when the game got to open beta.
---
Will the next killer be.... A wizard? 
---
I mean we dont know if BHVR collects all that data (and if they have a method to sort it), I guess we will see
---
It isn't, actually! My sister recorded it on her phone. Currently trying to figure out how to upload mp4s recorded with an iPhone (I use android), I'll splice it together and throw it on YT when I get home and will update with a link to it. 
---
Alter boy survivor confirmed. 
---
CHAD meg
---
Maybe he’s a vampire 
---
First of all you went for unsafe hook, then its not killers problem that „x survivor doesnt have fun”
---
He is here to have fun and wont care so he decides after who to go, obviously injured one is better so why wouldnt he go for that person?
---
I am not saying tunneling is good
---
But if you unhook near killer, dont bitch about getting downed again after unhook, its your team’s fault, not killer’s
---
Except the ban isn't to stop that account from playing the game. The ban is there to stop *that player* from playing the game.
---
So. No. You're banned, you're banned for good.
---
All seeing piggy?
---
Ogre or we riot!!!
---
Now that I think about it, EVERY killer and survivor can be clearly connected by mechanics or story. 
---
Trapper/Jake - traps vs sabotage
---
Hillbilly/Meg - chainsaw vs sprint
---
Wraith/Claudette - cloaking vs empathy
---
Dwight falls into an odd category since he seems like a cowardly odd man out, but really I think he’s being held out for Benedict Baker’s Killer, who I suspect will be some kind of anti-leader...
---
Being a vigilante doesn't make you morally good
---
That would be cool
---
Are the chains connected at all?
---
I really hope for a plague doctor.
---
Yea, to the inside of the circle. 
---
Scarred Hand. It’s a very rare addon that makes it so she can’t teleport to traps, but they have collision ^^
---
That is very rare dude. I been playing on ps4 for a while and that never happens, when im playing solo, swf, or killer. lol That is a rare occurence. DS is a survivor tool that can switch the momentum of a game like the examples I posted. Just like noed can turn a 0k to a 4k, Ds can change the momentum which personally i feel is good for both sides to have! I guess because i play both sides I can appreciate both perks unlike alot of people!
---
I did! There is a clickable link to it from google but when you go to it the link is broken. 
---
How about you fix your broken game first before worrying about releasing another killer/survivor
---
Don't be afraid to move on. Good loopers will take you around the map while everyone else does gens. Don't be afraid to give up a chase.
---
They laughed cus he skipped leg day every day. Who's laughing now?
---
I did! There is a clickable link to it from google but it’s broken if you click on it. 
---
Yes please.
---
"A time of darkness" could refer to the Dark Ages with the light either referring to religion or the "Cult of The Entity" idea.
---
Just hang out in the bathroom the whole match, then in post-game chat just say, "Sorry, had mexican food last night!" and leave
---
Killers wanted faster matchmaking.
---
This video and other development videos are all on Steam. I just watched this last week. 
---
I could see it being a pope. It would be pretty sick
---
 And who knows man lol
---
now, that sonds cool.
---
The initial buy can be pricey if you want to future proof it, but the vast majority of people don't need to replace parts every couple of years. Mine's been running fine since 2014, and I'm just now thinking about maybe getting a new graphics card and a couple sticks of RAM
---
Dang that sucks. Sorry man hopefully it's a glitch and will be back on soon. 
---
Thats obviously a Smash Ball.
---
Still, you act like it effects you! People have a very little chance to play with Ochido so you probably don’t have to worry about it. He is just trying to make content for people.
---
Happens to me a lot on both sides. When I get hit after fast vaulting and being a distance away from the window I wonder why I even bother vaulting. Landing those as a killer I just shake my head and let out a "Sorry, that really shouldn't have hit you bud."
---
Umm, this is from Twitter, please credit them.
---
totally.
---
Im just average in terms of being a survivor(rank 15) due to I usually play swf with a friend. Also how long is considered too long of a chase when chasing a single survivor?
---
Never said anything about being morally good.
---
No onion bro?
---
looks like a hive to me....
---
They even SPECIFICALLY SAID they would never have a clown killer. 
---
Yep.. I find killer more fun to play these days. Hitboxes, lag, face campers and lobby dodgers. I played survivor way more but now it's painful to wait 30 mins for a game.. then the one killer who doesn't dodge the lobby has 300 ping...
---
Aw dang :c we were excited we saw something new. Weird it showed up on the console opening tho. 
---
Awesome! I need this skin right now 
---
Prince of persia killer confirmed?
---
:)
---
Except for the harassment, weaponising his fanbase to flood people with spurious reports when he lost, actively exploiting the game to his advantage.
---
Also, while being toxic can't get you banned, *encouraging toxic behaviour, thus making a game less enjoyable to play* doesn't really reflect well on a person.
---
Aztec.
---
I think people dc’ing is a separate issue. I can forgive a dc in a moment of rage or frustration. But dodging a lobby requires a certain amount of calculation. You’re sizing up the survivors and thinking to yourself “nah, I don’t want to deal with this” and leaving, potentially wasting 10-20 minutes of the survivors’ time. Yes, you have that freedom, but that doesn’t negate the fact that it’s a bit of a dick move. 
---
Your bar is so low lol
---
Well if it is so, kinda can be called tunneler, but its still part of the game
---
The only thing you can do inthis situation is pretty much what you did and that is good to try and get a hit of him
---
The shape reminds me of a bishop chess piece so I'm thinking about the same thing.
---
Good fucking luck getting me to join that cesspit. Spent 5 minutes in general chat and wanted to kill myself on hook.
---
It’s the Kishin!!! 
---
For Doc I run Distressing, BBQ, Enduring, and Brutal Strength (probably switching to Spirit Fury once I unlock it) but I've been sucking with him lately
---
Overcharge isn't great because good survivors just neutralize it. Though it with Unnerving can be fun at lower ranks. Missed skill checks everywhere
---
I get that you like Iron Grip but IMO it just isn't good enough to run. I'm also personally prejudiced against NOED, so yeah
---
For Freddy, I'd go with Remember Me, BBQ, Blood Warden, and Enduring once you level the necessary people. I guess maybe swap out Blood Warden for NOED because Freddy could actually need it. Even though it hurts me to say that
---
Both Doc and Fredders are pretty add-on dependent so keep that in mind. I make myself use some brown ones just because they keep piling up, but the games are usually worse. For Doc I like Order and Calm, but Discipline is really good
---
Freddy, Class Photo is excellent. Also look at ones that synergize with Remember Me like Jump Rope. Get all the survivors in the Dream World after the gens are done and it'll take them a long, long time to open the gates. At that point in the game the only ways them have to wake up are healing or another survivor who's already awake, so if you put them all asleep, you're set
---
No matter what there is always going to be a fuckload of complaints about this game posts :/
---
So.... most of the sub.
---
I wish there was a non cancer forumd for game discussion.
---
Fuck you beat me to it
---
Here's mine www.youtube.com/AnaisMarguerite 
---
Would you say that you're being.... Goodenough?
---
Because that isn't OCD and it's super insulting to people with actual OCD. 
---
Survivor main here.
---
I’ve been hit countless times through pallet slams. I have made peace with this.
---
I pretty much suck, overall. Not going to grief someone for it.
---
Am I the only one that sees the outline of a creepy demon like scull behind the gold incense burner when zooming in?
---
They said oldest killer yet so it has to be tfc or maybe dmc i forget what the logo for dmc was but could swear it was similar
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jnw-csRRr0k
---
They would never! I even pay for abilities to skip exp grinds! 
---
The worst part is that you are right 
---
Better than total silence. Better than having a company completely oblivious to the concerns of their playerbase. 
---
Ahhhh thats hot
---
It’s a joke xD
---
Because at p3 she has the best camouflage in the game.
---
The skin matters in a game where the point is evasion and stealth.
---
Im expecting either something tomorrow or nothing until the Livestream Thursday. If they Stream this week. 
---
I assumed you were, that's what makes it more pathetic lol you don't want discussion you want validation.
---
I will begone, I'm getting a stench of sad all over me itt
---
That's fair man.
---
Good luck. 
---
Referring to the fact that she's fourth best which I heavily disagree with, not the fact that she's B tier (I place her in B tier myself lol)
---
Yeah i see it meanwhile they probably just stuck 2 of bills cigarettes in there facing both ways
---
Going for a flashlight save.
---
I'm sorry for the therapy you require now
---
You have it under gaming but the flair should probably be shitpost then
---
Tru3 played poorly in that game. I've seen him tackle those same kind of loops before and do much better.
---
He's spoken highly of the Clown in the past but he started out this video sounding real salty and was using a mori, so I'm guessing hes had his ass kicked the past few times.
---
Not gonna lie, there is something about the Clown that's strange. He ends chases faster than other killers yet still gets genrushed to hell. It's odd. Tru3 has had this before with Clown, extremely quick chases yet gen rushed. I know he has poor map pressure but still...
---
As for todays video his mistake was traversing over the damn map. Azarov's is an awful map, only Billy and Nurse have the map pressure required to tackpe that beast. If I get that map I just find the side with the 3 cloest gens and camp it, if I'm lucky my totem will be on the same side. This and red forest are just too big for most killers to have any kind of map pressure.
---
As for Clown I take Ruin for the early game and Pop goes the weasel for later. Seems ok so far at slowing the game down.
---
As a Nea main I also approve this message
---
I need this in my life.
---
I honestly prefer the regular anime, but the abridged is very funny
---
I see that XD
---
I get that reference!
---
Mist thickness reaches its max at Murkey Reagent levels.  It still says "stacks" on a Murkey Reagent because a Clear Reagent can lessen the mist (any other reagent offerings would then affect the stack).
---
They are testing a new version of the matchmaking https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1100444442857824256
---
You do realize this post is about countless people posting the same thing... Not about the matchmaking, don't you? 🤔
---
If he sits idol for more than 30 seconds, he is in a box.
---
I switched to tapp because claudette doesn't feel fair and has a bad rep due to other players
---
This some Uncharted looking shit up in here.
---
Actually that only proves that it's random because if I purposefully separated them, that would be fabricating results, which I got through rigourous testing and complicated algorithms.
---
At the cost of being utterly useless and losing every match, yes they can be.
---
I will say, I just got into DBD and was watching his content (can't say I was a fan, the sound effects were awful, I mainly watched it for jukes) but after seening this and learning how toxic he has been in and out of game, I've unsubscribed and will never go back.
---
Then they stop to teabag and get hit too
---
Why was i hit? Just to suffer?
---
pineapples on the left and right. spongebob. Hash slinging slasher confirmed.
---
Tough guess.
---
The markings on the pendant (cross within a circle) could be meaningless, or they could be an intentional reference to the ['solar cross'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_cross), but that symbol transcends history and cultures.
---
The carvings around the arch have the feel of an Aztec/Mayan temple, but the filler outside of the arch is more ornate or curvy than I would expect. Which is a shame, as the whole thing feels like a sacrificial altar (and the hanging pendant even resembles an upside-down [macuahuitl.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macuahuitl))
---
Then there is the quote that came with the picture, "In a time of darkness, some look for a light to follow". Time of darkness? Dark Ages? Solar Eclipse? Then the onion/blood drop hanging from chains (two that seem to be embedded in it, one that goes through a loop at the top.) No idea there.
---
Granted, I don't know anything about most of what I posted. Just neat to speculate on pictures that seem to give us next to no info.
---
My guess...  Jinn
---
😂🤣 I actually knew about the Facebook group before I even had Reddit. Mostly I find Reddit leas toxic with the exception of *some* 
---
Also...
---
🎉🎊🎉🎊**HAPPY CAKE DAY!!!** 🎉🎊🎉🎊
---
Next killer is Solaire with a Sunlight power that blinds survivors.
---
REVENGE TIME
---
I'm 100% sure you don't know what a joke is
---
I remember in a podcast that the dev said this killer was going to be the oldest yet.
---
Mummy?
---
No, but it doesn't excuse being a piece of shit either
---
Singular is Jinni.
---
That's where we get the term "genie"
---
Makes you Chaotic Good tho!
---
Out of curiosity and lack of knowledge on coding and such. Wouldn't it make the coding and IT teams jobs easier if the game wasn't being changed/added too? We've all seen new bugs sprout up anytime new DLC is released. Not sure if it makes a difference to them or not or even if it affects their jobs.
---
Replace dead hard with a roll
---
yup and then were gonna get spam in the thread saying "mori" is no fun blah blah blah 
---
The problem with Tru3 is that when the game was still finding itself, he emerged as top talent in the game.   He was one of the few big names, and got super cocky from the attention and his abilities against pretty noob survivors. Everyone was figuring the game out at that time, and killers were a lot stronger due to survivor ignorance. 
---
While he still is a good killer, he never really evolved as much as everyone else. He’s still stuck in a lot of his old ways and runs awful perks that are effective against rank 12s. What he doesn’t grasp is that he could be perkless, and still be very successful against those ranks. He constantly thinks he’s found some secret perk combo that is strong, but in reality, it’s hot garbage. The man runs stridor in half his builds, for fucks sake. 
---
When he gets to challenging ranks, he attributes his constant losing to survivors “figuring out his build” and needs to find a new combo.  Like, really?  You’re the bastion of this game and survivors are playing chess with only you and your atrocious builds?  His ego won’t let him believe that he isn’t the only killer out there, especially ones that would be in his rank. He honestly believes that survivors are out to get him and will attribute his short comings to them either changing loadouts to counter only his build and/or stream sniping. 
---
Tru3 is constantly making mind numbing decision with his loadouts and add-on selections, but would rather make outrageous claims such as the Clown being a very weak killer than accept that, it is he, not the Clown, that is the weakness. Once he decides to check his ego, he just might tru3ly (sorry, I had to) get better. 
---
You really didn't need to
---
guys i think this *photochopped* 
---
Honestly spirit isn’t all that fun for survivors. At least not once said spirit has learned how to play the killer at a high skill level. Very little counterplay against truly good spirits, almost as little as nurse.
---
well it's more that the devs said they would be slowly testing their new matchmaking system here and there without telling us specifically when they would be doing it. this is obviously one of those times.
---
so it's sorta like, we already know why its happening. we already know that the devs know its happening. Then on top of that you should post bug reports to the official forums, not the subreddit. So do we really need 527 posts of people saying the same thing? No. Not really.
---
For survivor yeah, for killer not so much.
---
Daddy
---
Must be a butthurt killer main.
---
Too bad that the website which allows you to join specific lobbies doesn't exist anymore. Ofcourse I'm aware of how abusive it was. On the other hand tho...Keep killing him until he actually tilts out completely doesn't seem much of a challenge.
---
Looks great. Also the trace joke isn't funny whoever is going to bring it up
---
Honestly he's super boring to me. Oh a clown killer using ether? How original!
---
In game i don't care for him but he's solid imo
---
I expect the reveal will be at the same time the PTB is available.
---
I’m sure our bud has changed. He wouldn’t be doing it again, would he?
---
Looks like mixture of Egyptian, Mayan, and ancient Chinese designs
---
it could be an error or ps store is planning to run it as a discount, the store does reset on tuesdays 
---
you could find the physical copies for way cheaper if you look hard enough 
---
*notices your trap* ÙwÚ what's this
---
Literally haven't ever seen him run stridor lol
---
So i'll say this.
---
My SWF group of all Rank 1's faced numerous Rank 18's last night. 
---
We wished them GG's after and all and felt bad for them. We weren't tbagging or being toxic. But i know it probably sucked for them.
---
On the flipside, prior to last night where we got killers fast and easy. We'd be sitting in que and get maybe TWO matches in TWO HOURS.
---
So i'm gonna have to say i'd rather get paired against low rank killers and get to play than to sit for 2 hours staring at the campfire and wasting my night.
---
Your forgot the part where he blatantly hacked his account to get more bp and cosmetics.
---
Nah, it's obviously gonna be a Deadric King from Skyrim.
---
If Cardinal Copia or any of the papa's from ghost is the new killer I will shit myself in the best of ways
---
Ya know, I was wondering why I hadn’t seen ankle messaging lately and then this guy popped up. I’m not saying you’re right but I could see it, they message in almost the same manner.
---
Oldest killer makes me think of Cain, as in Cain and Abel. Now if someone more interested in religion would connect him to the teaser picture.
---
It's super ironic being condescended to by someone who posted a facebook exchange on reddit to get validation. I'd be happy to laugh at you irl too don't flatter yourself
---
what did the entity look like?
---
What does it mean???!!!!!
---
Ree.
---
To be honest that is most of the original streamers (ohm, no0b3, tru3, etc.). All of the bugs along with flip flopping the power on either side nearly weekly takes its toll. I wish people would stop taking a complaint from tru3 as gospel though. I have seen a few posts that are like "Tru3 said this is broken" then you watch the clip and hes high ranks running no perks or add ons then complaining that its challenging lol.
---
Judging by most fb groups I've been exposed to i bet its just awful lol
---
Oh shit, I didn’t even realize what the cake meant 
---
Thanks lol
---
I see what's going on ITT, BUT, and hear me out here.
---
*bjöng bing*
---
Yeah I over generalized with "all" and "20th century" but I mostly meant that they've all been more or less modern in terms of history.
---
But a lot of them can be assume based on looks or back stories. Nurse is probably ww2 era based on outfits and the Huntress is outright said to be in ww2 era during the eastern front. Doctor can also be assumed to be from the 50/60s since his backstory seems to be based on Project MKUltra. The clown's back story is 30s-60s, and assuming the Spirit is tied to Adam then they were in the 90s. Obviously like you said the licensed ones we definitely know like Myers and Leatherface from the 70s, and Pig and Freddy from within the last decade. If Susie's jacket didn't say '97 (iirc) then it would be easy to assume they were all from this decade too. But Lisa is definitely up for debate, an isolated village in the bayou could be 1800-2000.
---
Omg shut up moron
---
Nope
---
Nerfing gens without buffing chase won't make for a more fun game. It will make the chase less meaningful while making m1 holding longer. 
---
Yep, couldn't have said it better myself. 
---
I figure it would just add onto the pile of bugs they already have to worry about as it is. 
---
Yup. I love DBD but when this happens it makes me want to rage quit so bad. Usually after something like this i find myself unable to loop for a couple of games. Like it just mess with me so badly that i stop playing for the day.
---
This meme fits about 80% of the posts on this sub. 
---
The sad thing is this sub is still the least shitty dbd forum option lol
---
Yikes. You don't need to be telepathic to actually pay attention to what the devs are saying.
---
The new and improved matchmaking system. 
---
This is the most convenient forum for this game.  They shut down the steam discussions, and gave a link to a really poorly designed forum that rarely has new posts.  I'm sorry that you don't feel that the discussions here are worthy of your time.  Just move on.
---
I did post a bug report by the way.  It was immediately closed with a link to their page discussing matchmaking changes.  So when you're met with a toxic community and a stock form response to your posts on the official forums, what's left to do?
---
Ironically, yes.
---
I have never seen a matchmaking post before man this is weird 
---
It looks like he became Hulk but something went horribly wrong... 
---
We were the killer after all!
---
Pinhead confirmed.
---
I would not doubt it in the slightest
---
&gt;But I guess that would "be illegal, dud," and turn into a shitshow among his prepubescent fans. 
---
I would actually enjoy to see this happen xD
---
&gt; ~~Please ignore the fact that I actually do like the latest Halloween movie.~~ 
---
~~Same~~
---
Bahaha yes!!!! I would be down for this lol!
---
Hail Nea
---
They set the bar too high with the hallowed blight abortion
---
Holy shit, I want that now.
---
Hail Satan!
---
!pvts
---
That’s literally what every is guessing
---
Do you accept constructive criticism??
---
I learn so much stuff from these teaser threads! Lol thanks for sharing
---
Your optimism is admirable, but misplaced.
---
I know Michaels mori is a buggy mess but COME ON! You've gotta be kidding me
---
I usually ignore the person trying to bait me into a chase even if I know I can get them. It's a person that's chasing you around when they could be doing generators, meaning I could have *two* people distracted if I chase someone else. 
---
As for that spot in particular, it's one of the annoying spots. As someone else mentioned, anti-looping builds that include Bamboozle are never bad. Otherwise, you just have to run them through that window three times and hope they don't know where to go next. You probably did the best course of action by going after someone else instead. 
---
I want bhvr to add a patch just for him, that will download to his game files, so every match he plays he is always exposed and on death hook from the start. 
---
Can anyone join and do I have to be active to not get kicked or whatever?
---
No he is not. But the point is that don't act surprised when he's banned for the 5th time. And he deserves every single ban. Witch hunting, hacking, exploiting, ban evasion and being toxic in general. He will get banned yet again soon enough. I don't give a shit how many subs he has and how much money he gets, I would love it if he just got the fuck out of my community and stopped being such a toxic influence.
---
He got some thighs tho😱😍
---
Also considered making the positive effects stay on for up to 2 survivors, but 3 or more all positive effects are gone
---
...I could, though?
---
I think it's fun.
---
If you don't think it's fun, why are you playing?
---
They said this after the doc released, so things could have changed.
---
It's a public Discord server from some guy on Youtube, there is no activity requirement and no requirements for joining.
---
happy bingo bongo boy
---
Same here just now 2 of them dc'd as soon as they went down the first time leaving their other 2 team members to get killed then inboxed ''gg'' like they had an audience or something..
---
So SWF just has to ensure that only one of them is running it, and all solos have to do is say they're running it in chat so noone else does. As if gens don't go fast enough already.
---
isn’t that just an antivaxxer
---
MOLOTOV!
---
Cool mind sharing it?
---
The idea is that if survivors are self interested, then mroe than one person will want to run it. Maybe remove gen speed boost then, but I kind of like the idea of punishing self interest for survivors
---
Benefits are only killer sided with this change.
---
Not saying the original perk was well balanced.
---
I'd be stocked if it we're Satan.
---
imagine having "butthurt killer main" as your only comeback when someone calls you out for supporting a scumbag who creeps on underage girls
---
Looks good!
---
I love him
---
Sounds like a perk a 4 man SWF would take advantage of. Have one guy run No Mither, Resilience, and survivors dilemma. The teammates run Prove Thyself. When someone is hooked if he’s co-op on a gen that guy will be working at a cool 134% speed without a toolbox.
---
Even without all that, a SWF will just coordinate one guy using this perk who will stay on gens and not go for saves. There would b no risk involved.
---
can you threaten to ban the people he queues with since they’re accessories to ban evasion? they know he’s breaking the rules and they damn know it. they’re accomplices to the ban evasion.. i mean if he’s streaming and it’s on his steam profile, i’ll be more than willing to go play at that rank and find him. 
---
I'll take fixing 4-5 infinites that still exist in the game and then removing bloodlust which was introduced as a bandaid fix for that issue.
---
Changing Iridescent head to only instadown on long range shots, making so the charge speed add ons on Billy don't stack, removing 3+ blink/omegablink and making it so prayer beads only muffle the sound instead of removing it would be pretty good too.
---
It looked like Myers had no intention of tunneling and was only using Feng to gain stalk and to bait Ace.
---
Yeah, my immediate vibe was Indiana Jones
---
Vampire? Vampires hate onions right?
---
I think he meant tying things in with lore a bit more: yeah, Meg is athletic, but she's exhausted just as long as any other survivor. David is tough, Tapp is a cough, but they go down just as easy as Dwight, a twig...perks not withstanding.
---
Templar asserting dominance.
---
&gt;Maybe maybe! For now, look forward to a new killer, upcoming reworks for Freddy, Larry and Legion sometime in the future, a secondary objective for survivors at the end of the game (to slow the game down just a little bit~)
---
&gt;
---
&gt;And aww, thanks. Nice change to Reddit’s general toxicity of being downvoted for asking genuine questions or getting trapped in echo chambers xD
---
I wish everything you said here were true, are you basing this on anything or just wishful thinking? 
---
What teaser?
---
The amount of hacking is very high afaik.
---
Almost every lobby drops with an eac message, and I have had many, many killers walk straight to my spawn, and walk right to the back corner of the map where I crouched to to hide and test my theory.
---
I have gone straight into a locker to start, and had killers walk straight to it nodding up and down like they can see my aura.
---
It's no surprise people DC immediately. They are not in a fair match quite often.
---
Also, salty as fuck survivors just do this in normal games. 
---
Posting a meme post about it on reddit is not the answer, why would it be?
---
:eyes:
---
No, what he said was pretty accurate.  There's no empathy in most of these responses.  
---
Wow Chapter 11's new UI looks great!
---
Damn, somebody had a bad day
---
Thanks, waayy better than tydetime 
---
wait op. if feng is the bottom wearing the red dress. whose the corner left ?
---
Supernatural for me lol
---
This is the reason I stay at the exit gate, right at the safe barrier. Either they hit and force me out, or I'm still in there
---
I keep seeing people say a priest or something but they said it's going to be the oldest killer so I'm guessing the picture is of a lich's phylactery. Next killer is a lich.
---
Of course it's not.  But why is the thought of people voicing their concerns here in what is arguably the only active dead by daylight community so troubling?  
---
It's why I am suggesting it.
---
Lol u mean the first one? Is Feng, I did couple of her becuz she is pretty and ez to draw. Bottom corner left is Meg. 
---
I blame you for this. 
---
/*s*
---
And I’m not a high rank killer. I’m a  rank 2-3survivor main. I think I’m like rank 14 as a killer and I’m facing rank 5s and they just run straight lines all the time and then rage at me after the game.  Lots of folks overly relying on corn, running in straight lines, wide turns on the loops, and the tea bags. Omg I got so many free hits off oddly placed tbagging. I’m the freaking huntress you don’t teabag on the other side of the pallet against huntress. Then I got yelled at for not breaking the pallet like I’m supposed to....I was just stunned, I couldn’t even respond. This guy was legit upset I hit him instead of breaking the pallet like it’s a script
---
I think that's a lich's phylactery. Next killer is a lich.
---
I've send you a message. 
---
I recall that the devs would have done that but they argued it would be way too much for people to remember and for all of them to have such small individual differences would make it real difficult to balance around.
---
What kind of information? Any illumination on optimization? Any new word on perks? Freddy reworks? Dedicated servers? Any of the dozen or so things they've been teasing?
---
Them just chatting is cool but don't pretend that's transparency. 
---
oh okay. i thought it was another character. yeah i meant the top left. just frazzled by the design in all of these. cant wait to see more
---
I think that's a lich's phylactery. Next killer is a lich. 
---
I've missed survivors so much. Might have to change my sensitivity on the mouse again. I don't mind pallets. Still learning though. 
---
I don't think she does  
---
Keep in mind I play on PC, but I've had my fair share of console play  
---
Are you sure you don't have a defective controller? Could already be causing thumbstick drifting. Although I'm not sure since you said it's only for Hag. I can tell this isn't an intended feature and is likely something on your end. Again, not sure as I don't play on console, but figured I'd provide some insight.
---
Sorta, but not quite. Fur is typically used to describe short length densely packed hair that covers an entire mammal's body.
---
But yeah, it is just colloquial distinction.
---
Wool is also just hair.
---
Is it? Because it honestly seems like this pseudo transparency crap is hurting them more than helping.
---
Well, the jokes on you. This is a toxic community. 
---
Do you even read the chat after most matches? This community is a bunch of whiners that cant take the fact that they weren't good enough to win. 
---
You cant run Noed
---
You cant run Decisive 
---
Dont loop that pallet
---
Face camping someone who knows how to play
---
Dont dribble a survivor if you think he has DS
---
Dont chain blind a killer 
---
Fuck that
---
If I can do it in game, I'm gonna do it in game.
---
New killer will be The something 
---
You are faking, right? What has this community come to?
---
__Everyone look.__
---
__Its AnklePickBro's secondary account after he told everyone to kill themselves. Just want everyone to be aware (if it's not already obvious from how disrespectful he speaks to people)__
---
Yah i figured this could cause confusion oof. Reddit only allows on pic so i have to combine them ; ;
---
Will there be a way to selectively join lobbys with lower ping? 
---
 2) other than teachable perks, survivors are just skins. Though if you have only gotten to lvl 5, I think you should put a little more time into the other survivors. They might show you new ways to play with their perk sets. Ace is tons of fun with his awful luck perks.
---
3) indoor maps kinda suck overall, hospital has some good places to hide, but scratch marks will kick your ass on indoor maps because tracking is so easier. 
---
Holy shit chief, we're onto something now
---
Maybe it’s a mummy
---
i wish they made a survivor that cant get tunneled off hook
---
Ochido should just go play league he would feel at home with all the Delusional People in there
---
I wish I was. I really do. I had to block the guy cuz he was so upset I was so try hard that I threw a hatchet rather then break the pallet first. He just couldn’t accept that he made a dumb mistake I think
---
I mean the older things are pretty flimsy, the new ones are pretty in depth.
---
I was playing as bubba recenly, chasing a survivor towards their hooked teammate while revving my chainsaw, and watched in detached horror as they unhooked their ally.
---
Of course I downed them both. I was going to let the victim of the bad unhook wiggle free but alas they d/c'd. I did not blame them in the slightest.
---
His heartbeat should just be any ghost song 
---
Yeah I don't think it will become meta unless they make it stupidly overstated or rework the mechanic but I don't think those changes would make it usable either... it needs a rework, its just impossible to balance. I can see it being either useless or meta defining with just stats change.
---
yall are some toxic mofos
---
Damn, why didn't I think of that! It makes so much sense now!
---
This community is like the nazi situation in real life. If anyone is upset the other one is toxic. Noone really cares about really toxic people anymore because everyone gets called toxic
---
FUS RO D/C
---
As much as I hate these consistent matchmaking posts  
---
This is just purely unacceptable matchmaking  
---
I mean  
---
What the hell
---
didnt they say before that they would release a killer directly related to the entity? this could be the one!
---
^ 100%
---
Will Smith is next killer confirmed.
---
This meme is funny and tactful. I applaud you OP

---
Hahahaaha! I’m gonna look it up that sounds hilarious xD I knew there had to be a reason why every damn post has someone talking about The Bee. 
---
Nah, he greats great pressure tracking and stealth, with good m1 mindgames. People underrate the hell out of him.
---
Well, I’m a survivor main who is trying to learn killer, and clown is one of the easier for me to have success with. Plus his wheeze is just a delight. 
---
Watch out for the layers of fear!
---
She did know what it felt like lol read her backstory, she was a victim of cannibals lol her own curse after she escaped them is what made her like that XD vengeance
---
That image has nothing to do with the bubonic plague or the crow makes doctors that walked around in the time period my friend.. i’m sorry
---
i'm pretty sure i found the guy that he was playing with. i'll pm you
---
It's the game on his channel that people actually watch, so he needs DbD to survive.
---
Behavior should ban him again so he can buy DbD again with a new PC.
---
Yes I over generalized, Freddy is from 2011 too.
---
As far as I'm aware, you're not gonna get it too cheap. It's constantly ranging within the $400 spectrum, so it's definitely not gonna get any cheaper.
---
I love these, very cool style. Thank you for sharing! 
---
Nobody Expects The Spanish Inquisition! 
---
Honestly I think MCote's comment is what really made that meme blow up.
---
The pure absurdity plus that: there was no way it WASN'T going to explode all over this subreddit.
---
The Clown
---
Disagree
---
I know, I have. But she's not the person she was once now :[

[Template for others who are too good at the game](https://i.imgur.com/tCtvmRg.png)
---
Thanks but I redownloaded DBD after I stopped playing so I have no good perks only got lvl 12-13 mains :,(
---
Its sarcasm hon. We're lightly cooking the turkey, not setting it on fire. If we were being toxic about it would be much more inflammatory.
---
Hope you understand.
---
Watch a Monto doc build
---
thats the new ds 
---
COVER ME, I'M RELOADING!
---
Well the reason is that the killer is getting more satisfaction from getting a 4k than they would a 3k. Sweaty or not, they're not doing it just go waste your time. Everyone is wasting their own time by participating in a game with a mechanic that drags out the match. 
---
The hell why is Nea here
---
Stupid autocorrect. STOKED* WERE*. 
---
What's a lich? 
---
It’s a spider for sureeeee
---
I mean you can still play wraith he ks one of the modt fun killers in low ranks. The things i mentioned are just for tryhard builds on rank 1
---
r/UnexpectedDeltarune
---
A survivor is just 3 new perks. A killer is a whole diff playstyle for all parties involved. 
---
A cardinal would scare me more than a knight I guess. Knights and warriors are trained to kill. A cardinal is more authority in a job that's supposed to guide so it's far off the path. 
---
what if you just get hit right off hook? do you need breakdown too? 
---
Imagine thinking everyone who disagrees with you is an alt account OMEGALUL
---
K Best killer to play I understand how the players are ranked how well they do in a chase but I mean what is easy to start with and fun to play
---
I would love/hate Samara, she scares the hell out of me! 
---
*LÄMP*
---
My feelings are hurt time to build a wall ! 
---
Gets downed just so can feel his arms wrapped around me
---
&gt;There are two forms of Ip Adress, Static and Dynamic. Static means the address is permanent, this is the form of IP that an IP ban would work on. Unfortunately the majority of if not all of the household internet IP addresses are Dynamic, meaning that if you turn of your modem for 5 minutes and turn it back on your IP is changed and you can access the content again.
---
This is not very accurate, plenty of ISPs around the world have static ips
---
His power better be that he can control a Sphere of Annihilation. If it isn't I say we riot.
---
If i had a idea i would be breaking nda anyways lol
---
I mean,  it's religious themed and its caption refers to a time of darkness.
---
An actual priest would be too provocative and I dont think BHVR would want any controversy. It's also supposed to be a very old killer and the plague isnt very modern lol.
---
Also I dont understand what you mean by "or the crow makes doctors that walked around in the time period". Could you elaborate?
---
Giving Survivors a 4th tier to their teachable perks, could be an interesting way of making survivors feel a bit more unique.
---
Imagine Nea having no fall stagger, and the ability to crouch faster than other survivors can walk.
---
Or Meg who is characterized as an athlete having her 2 exhaustion perks give her a 200% speedboost.
---
2) Cool. I've considered it, and I will probably get tired of just Meg anyways. I have been interested in just how different everyone's skills are.
---
3) Glad it's not just me. I'm perked so my scratches last 3 seconds less (honestly not sure how worthwhile that perk is, I need to research it), but there just seems to be so many areas where every intersection is a straight shot so you have to juke like hell or have a lucky break to get any kind of decent chase.
---
This is obviousely a tracing drawing cmon /s
---
Yeah this is what i'm wondering too, i dislike him as much as the next guy. But nobody deserves to get falsely accused of being a pedo. 
---
try hill billy he is not too hard but really fun and strong even without add-ons/perks. And as i said for the beginning wraith is fine i was just talking about strats against good players
---
omg!
---
Nah, they just get tossed into a void after they lose all hope.
---
I’m thinking something Egyptian maybe?
---
nope, the new skillcheck will start on pickup
---
You can still use DS lol
---
Shows that the balance team sucks. Lol
---
K he’s chainsaw? (Ik cannibal has one too but running chainsaw)
---
Be happy you got in a fucking game 😂
---
Welcome to the other side haha 
---
Sucks that happened to you.
---
Its best use is to slow the game down by making it take longer to heal
---
you walked up on survivors doing palates?
---
talk about a real bible thumper! :)
---
Nothing on that, but in summer dedicated servers will be added to the game!
---
K thanks 
---
This is amazing, I love the Kate as she is my main. Also having the logo as a tattoo on Nea is a nice touch.
---
It’s the Mummy!!!
---
Just saw that I forgot to blurr out the names. But I don’t care about mine and I certainly don’t care about that guys privacy 
---
I think that there's videos on the subject.
---
Typing in something like 'Ochido exposed' on YouTube could help.
---
Fucked up crab
---
if DCing is bannable why give the option to quit at all? 
---
I think it’s Mayan related, the symbols and religious references point towards that a lot
---
I smell another "original" killer. It bums me out a bit, tbh I'd rather have another licensed killer.
---
But I bet it's yet another "original" designed killer because BHVR can milk those with cosmetics. 
---
Ah ok so that and the nurse perk that lets you see healing survivors?
---
Probably lol
---
Just a random thought I had when I saw it. Haven’t seen the movies in ages so you’re probably right 
---
Being a vigilante doesn't in and of itself make you morally good, but stopping unrepentant pedophiles from preying on more victims is pretty good on the balance of things.
---
Should have gone omega-immersed. Keep em from ever finding you
---
Lightweight is good, but there are certainly better perks to use. Until you have those perks tho, lightweight is a great starting perk 
---
*Hallobeen theme starts playing*
---
I think there are situations where dcing is understandable like a killer hacking/lagswitching or you getting stuck. I had a game (many people did) where someone got stuck in a locker. Without dcing I would still be ingame
---
BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
---
If by "flips the game rules to suit themselves" you mean by using the programmed game mechanics to derank. Yes. He did this.
---
He is not the first person who broadcasts the game to do it, and he wont be the last. Hell, I do it to stay out of red ranks.
---
His videos are highly monetized. It is literally his job to make the best videos he can. 
---
Can he be an ass? Yes, but everyone has their moments.
---
If you aren't a fan, dont follow. It really is simple as that. Some people are, and its bullshit that you feel he dosent deserve the opportunity to earn his paycheck because you dont like what he dose.
---
we need a megathread there is just tons of identical posts with different titles
---
Who do you guys think the SECOND worst killer is? Freddy is obviously worst, but who takes second? I think it might be trapper but I'd love to hear what you guys think 
---
Amen go do that

As an assexual attack helicopter I also aprove of this message.

Out of naive stupidity I had the hope he‘d help me do gens or something. At least that’s what I’m doing when one disconnects in loading screen

&gt; I've almost exclusively played with Meg, all my others are lvl 5 or lower. Is there any benefical reason to expand my survivor selection, other than unlocking teachable perks? I unlocked WGLF through the SoS, and I was planning to get to Claudette for Self-Heal eventually, but other than that, I haven't really felt the need to jump around.
---
I create little story lines for all my survivors and play differently/narrate for each one
---
I dunno
---
WE CAN COPYSTRIKERIGHT PEWDIEDIE
---
What platform u on
---
Yes, but for whatever reason, this game wasn't developed with that in mind. They don't even have the technology to track parties into a lobby.
---
I’d rather have something than jack shit in the darkness followed by “Hey, here’s an update” and they crawl back into their caves. Even if they couldnt meet their own deadlines at least telling us projections for timeframes means they can not only tease us with what’s in mind but if they don’t meet those projections they can have open discussion about what went wrong and the specific issues they had during that time. 
---
Honestly, I love knowing about shit like this. Much better than a team of people just being quiet and offering nothing. 
---
No because he followed her in tier 3 but because I went in front of him he followed me a couple seconds later (I'm ace)

Ew moth meme
---
So... I’m not sure how often you play clown or if I’ve simply misunderstood you, but he barely slows down at all, if even when he throws or charges a bottle. And ruin does the same stuff it does on every other killer, early game momentum. 
---
Plus, they’ve done a lot of tweaking to the pallet density by now, even if they can make to another pallet they can’t loop it so you’ll just tear through the map and clear out all the pallets if they somehow manage to last that long.
---
Indeed
---
Is WGLF worth it? If I want Dead Hard, there isn't much point buying WGLF as I still have to level him right?
---
Off limits how. 8 guessed shaman or witch doctor

Not much of a teaser to me. I want a hype up video!!
---
I hope it will beeee a balanced one 
---
And just downloaded identity and I’m still wondering why haven’t they fixed the horrible ping and lots of other problems
---
as much as i hate gideon, i'm starting to like it. 
---
Wouldn’t it make more sense for a killer to be in this pic than a survivor?
---
Who the frick is gideon?
---
go take the hit fam!
---
Damn, this looks great! 
---
Davids are the most friendly survivors EVER, I will not stand for this meme. 
---
I considered that originally, but David matches the original meme too well to use anybody else, I think
---
It seems to be working well for me. Times where I'm in a pinch, I seem to be able to lose people more times than not (save for the damn indoor levels).
---
Oh, one last thing, I still only have Lvl 1 Sprint Burst, am I missing something on on how to upgrade, or did I just botch my bloodweb the first time around? (I didn't realize perks stay until you buy them until Lvl 35 or so)
---
THE DC OMGGGGGG
---
That's what I can't find. :/ and OP has yet to respond to anyone so far, so I have no idea where they could have gotten it from. A reverse image search doesn't pull up anything, and it will cost money to obtain copies of the document. 
---
i honestly can't understand people being impatient over a week after the fiasco with the clown, if you were a console player back when clown dropped then you learned the real meaning of waiting, this ptb coming next tuesday is nothing.....smh i just don't understand the impatience
---
Fuck yes
---
bee oh why bee
---
It was right in front of our eyes, how could we gave been so blind. 
---
Definitely, definitely body block them into a corner and get a free swing. I don’t have all of the perks for killer, but I love using the Wraith’s especially if I’m chasing an injured survivor. It’s easy to find them when you use them.
---
I’d recommend using an add-ons that help you go invisible faster and get out faster. I also like using the one that lets you become visible after you break a gen or pallet.
---
If you’re starting out, use the Wraith’s perks and then mix and match afterwards. I tried to use Insidious once, but I’m not sure how that even works on him? If anyone can give a tip for that perk, I’d like to hear that too.
---
ps4, i find killers always check a nearby locker if you disappear from their sight. although i have had many escapes cause of it.  
---
Yeah, I'm guessing it's to set up the premise for PD3, but with the laughable failure of Raid WW2 and Overkill's Walking Dead, the company is gonna need to make some big moves to sell the next sequel
---
holy mother of toxic asshole. i mean it's understandable to be annoyed and aggravated, but you don't need to throw out the slurs. now i understand why killers just gg and leave. i've been playing a ton of killer, and even if you weren't tunneling, camping, or whatever the usual complaints are, the survivors will ALWAYS try and talk shit. keep on going on, fella. 
---
I feel like were going to get Candyman one day. Maybe to tie in with the upcoming movie. His power could involve like a throwable object that are live bees and can hunt down survivors. 
---
Yeah I think that's the one I'm thinking of. 
---
Ahh yes still reminds me of that one single game where Michael has noed and I got hooked and 3 megs rushes to help only to get slaughtered 
---
God damn lol Thanks for putting a smile on my face.
---
🤔
---
A plague doctor
---
Not quite sure what you're asking, but you lose all perks when you prestige, and you randomly get perks as you level. You can only get one perk per level, and to get a perk to tier 3 you must find it in the bloodweb and purchase it 3 times. You don't lose perks unless you prestige 
---
What rank are you usually at
---
That’s the one I’m not looking for.  I’m looking for any proof besides Ardetha’s video.
---
Just asking, so do you guys want him to stop making videos or never play the game again period point blank? 
---
**Not defending him, didn't know about him until 2 weeks ago**
---
Hoping for Father Campbell!
---
Onion knight? that guy from Dark Souls? 
---
back in my day you wouldn't lose points for farming your teammates. 
---
Some evil priest that kill people for God ~~(The Entity even before he/she was chosen)~~?
---
It's just pretty :( but also yes
---
you just gotta leave those bad ping lobbies. you'll have to wait 5 whole seconds to search again, but idk man. 
---
I lost my shit at the rage quit, I was laughing so hard.

you just made my day

This guy comes up and bing-bongs your girl, what do you do?

I watched that yesterday! He was playing hillbilly for sure. I'll see if I can find it again. It was all in one match.

---
Ew3 to tunnel an injured survivor, what a disgrace to the Myers.
---
Source?
---
theres another pic of it in my post history
---
I guessed a priest a while back, my reasoning....
---
They said it was the oldest killer by far and they are very cryptic with their comments, so i took oldest and figured an Elder or a Father, meaning title rather than a time, then took that to some form of priest. 
---
4g on both so yeah... I usually get about 20 ping in every game that i play competively aka rainbow six siege cs go etc so it should run pretty well 
---
So no head? *breaks pallet*
---
I get your point but i've always been one to believe you learn best from being challenged.
---
You learn bad habits when you play against bad players. You get used to winning by doing shit that simply won't work against good players, then they bitch and whine about good players being 'cheap' or 'tryhards' etc because they refuse to adapt then end up quitting over it anyway.
---
I remember when i first started playing King of Fighters '98 in the arcade. There was a group of hispanic kids EVERY day there on the machine who played it.
---
I didn't even know how to play and everytime i tried, i had to fight them and get my ass handed to me and barely had time to learn a move or two. They'd laugh at me and make fun of me in Spanish.
---
I still went every day after school and got my ass handed to me for over a month until finally i had a grasp of the game, moves and the hispanic kids chars and strategies. I finally started winning. And they cursed me out in spanish and threw a fit and stopped playing with me when i kept winning. Finally i got to play Arcade mode vs CPU lol.

But that's how i learned KOF. It was a literal month long trial by fire where i had to learn what little i could in each match while getting destroyed.
---
I know most people don't have the patience, skill or determination to do that but the point is still the same.
---
It’s rewind time
---
Which other one?
---
Maybe the first concept for Benedict Baker? The dude we always see in quotes on the items and perks?
---
Idk, maybe you need to clear the devices up. Other than that, it's probs the connection with the internet in general, or the devices can't support this game, which is sad considering Roblox has more graphics.
---
Name checks out. I don’t think you’re a dumb shit tho. 
---
If I was hired by a company to draw I’m gonna fuckin’ draw. Why the hell would they tell me to balance the edgy teen I just drew? That’s like saying McDonald’s gets cashiers to help with marketing cause it ain’t doing well. Have you ever animated a 3D model? It’s a lot different than working with code and art. 
---
I actually cant hear the whispers. Its like my ears cant distinguish it from everything else in game. I have been able to do gen grabs by crotching. It wasnt in the clip but I manged to hang the jake by sneaking up on him. Is that the result of a perk? Its like when I uncrouch they have no clue im there so I get the chance to grab them. 
---
Hopefully.
---
Shh I cant spell 0:
---
Yes but at least every time they do this he has to spend more and more money to be able to play again
---
I mean if we are still talking about my phone then it can certainly run basically any game In App Store (expect horribly optimized games)
---
I really want a Silent Hill DLC, but I don't know how I'd feel about them using Revelations characters. I'm all for Pyramid Head, but I'd rather have Rose than Claudia.
---
Didn’t onions cure the plague btw?
---
Onion killer confirmed.
---
Speaking of Myers. I was thinking of making this about the time I got tombstone’d in place of the obsession with dying light. I was traumatized LOL
---
You missunderstood. Im talking about sjws who call everyone a nazi who disagrees with them. Not what happened before and during ww2. I as a german have the hightest of respect for those who got tortured during these times of inhumanity
---
Davids are the most likely people to unhook you in front of the killer in my experience. That ain't friendly.
---
They swapped mains because killers judge you from what character you decide to pick. Thanks to the reddit hate, I moved to someone else. Because youve met some toxic caludettes means every single one is toxic and treat them as such. Or it could also be a gender and race thing as well.
---
Remember wraith before he got buffed? THAT was horrible 
---
na that would be terrifying to walk up to a group of dwight's doing lol :) seriously though man i do so much dumb shit as killer i just wanna KMS so many times lol and i am rank 1 p3 mikey main and i still catch myself saying wtf did i just do! :0)
---
&gt; Im talking about sjws who call everyone a nazi who disagrees with them
---
oh god you're one of those 
---
Me too
---
Oh god you're one of those
---
For someone who's not a nazi Trump sure does associate with a lot of fuckin nazis
---
Never take shit from someone with a cartoon/anime profile pic.
---
Maybe a plague doctor or some similar theme? Doctors at the time of the plague believed the plague was spread by bad smells so that may explain things like the medicine wheel and the burner. 
---
i know right!? sometimes i can't hear shit and other times i can hear a survivor breathing while getting in a locker so i can go straight to where i heard the breathing....i guess i got selective hearing lol
---
This would be nuts, but I wonder if Konami would give them license to use the property. It's not like they're doing anything with it, but still...
---
Man my matches against mikes are always something. I didnt know that he got his power from staring at you so I would stupidly stand in his line of sight like a dumb ass and be confused why he downed me instantly. Now I run like hell when I see him/hear the music.
---
It would be Dwight doing Palates though
---
Nothing matters, so what's wrong with caring intensely about 3D-animated crabs dancing?
---
look a t his left arm, there is a skull
---
I really do not like Trump. His policy is shit and he sure is racist. But neither he nor anyone asosciated with him is a nazi. If you think what he is doing is as bad as killing 6 million jews you are really unsensitive towards all of those who had to die in this cruel times
---
Yeah same tbh but since Pyramid Head first appeared in Revelations I would assume they would have to use Claudia and not Rose
---
Moth 
---
my personal fave is restraint because it’s a pretty good middle finger to calm spirit and it’s funny seeing people go into lockers after they tier up 
---
Well it rhymes..
---
I was thinking like High Priestess of a cult that worships the Entity
---
He did give license to games so I wouldn't be surprised if they gave them license to DbD since it's getting very big and popular
---
You can get the game at CD Keys for $9 right now. That's a drop in the bucket … Meanwhile he's getting over 75K views on his videos and has over 500K subscribers on his Youtube channel. He's clearly winning this battle. It just makes BHVR look incompetent and encourages others to do the same. 
---
The more attention that is given to him, the more it feeds his ego and since there is nothing BVHR can legally do to him to stop him … he will just continue to do it. 
---
I've played against far worse players then this guy. 
---
This wouldn't be that far fetched, since Doctor's dlc was based on a real person
---
All I'm saying is that he's a nazi. clearly he hasn't done a holocaust
---
(altho his admin does gas kids across the border and sexually assaults them) 
---
If this is true, it would be amazing. Hope it does happen
---
This reminds me of a Splatterhouse fanfic involving Biggy Man. 
---
This is how she will assert her dominance over her father if she ever gets her revenge. 
---
Interesting
---
Me too!
---
I'm hoping it's a nun, like puppet combos nun massacre nun
---
When they say “oldest” I can’t help but wonder if they mean from the furthest back period or oldest as in age
---
1. I will stop arguing now since you cant argue with your kind
---
2. I would like to see proof of that
---
oh you know it would be dwights lmao
---
Same over here, i guess it is from last patch or servers
---
Shut up bitch
---
I thought this was a meme at first but a meme can’t be this accurate. 
---
like 14 or 13
---
Joke's on you he's only pretending to be stupid and defend Ochido. /s

Kind of looks like a very plain version of a [Incense Burner](https://www.heavenlyoils.com/thumbnail.asp?file=assets/images/brasshangingresinburner-45inch.jpg&amp;maxx=300&amp;maxy=0), it vaguely reminds me of the Brass hanging Types but it seems to be missing the openings/holes most seem to have.
---
The Quote, too reminds me either of something religious or someone in the depths of despair following someone who promises them help (perhaps someone who survived a War following someone who uses their despair for their own gain to make them their follower) and it sounds very, very much like a variation of this [Aristotle Quote](https://i2.wp.com/benbalden.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/It-is-during-our-darkest-moments-that-we-must-focus-to-see-the-light.-Aristotle.png?ssl=1).
---
I'd say it's either some Killer Nun (maybe inspired by the same Story that inspired the Movie?) that's been sealed away or a demonic Entity (I doubt it though, demons could probably meddle and bend the Entities Rules). That or some sort of Warrior maybe? Thought I doubt that one since our last Killer was Asian already.
---
~~Kind of hoping for a Nun but at the same time it'd probably be awkward timing with the Pople coming forward with all that abuse and assault stuff.~~
---
&gt; your kind
---
yikes
---
&gt; I would like to see proof of that
---
You shouldn't run your fucking mouth if you're uninformed

True. For instance, Rin could have very well learned at the same institution Adam taught at. There is literally a connection between Jeff and the Legion (Frank, specifically): The mural that Jeff draws for the Legion is heavily hinted at in the Mural Drawing add-on, and Jeff started his art career when Frank commissioned him to draw a Legion art (which was generously rewarded with 50 bucks and a 12-pack), kickstarting the rest of Jeff's life. The rest is hinted or implied, aside from the DLC killers, of course. Feng has some with the Doctor, but only on a meta level..the Doctor is based off a Chinese doctor who used ECT to correct obsessive, hardcore gamers of their strong urges to game, and not only is Lery's a Chinese area (look at the signs, literally), but does Feng fit any description just described...? However, it takes some DIGGING to reach that level of connection. The rest don't really matter, like David and the Huntress or the Clown and Kate (those two are ideological foils, rather than having interacted), with the exception of Nea, in an odd instance, as she tagged the Asylum where the Nurse formerly worked at and got sucked in...though, like Kate, that seems more like an issue of wrong-place, wrong time than anything. Just an ESPECIALLY wrong place.
---
thanks, actually my first post on reddit
---
used to play as survivor and never used DS, but the end times are coming, gonna either main a killer (dev's faivourites) or abandonning this ship
---
Such an adorable reply xd
---
Keep at it, Zombie! 
---
That's most likely why this was ranks 20 because I hadn't played in a while but I'm usually that rank to and killers check lockers too much
---
Usually an error on both sides as in certain NAT types wont connect to each other. You can reset your router if you want to try and get your NAT type to open.
---
What video ?
---
Legit I hate onions in all its forms so this is ACTUALLY scary for me. 
---
Survivor whining about their own fever dreams? Sounds about right
---
It would me amazing, but I have no idea his his gameplay would work
---
🦀
---
[angry crab noises]
---
Well there’s no reason the killer has to be African. The flag is just a code name, like legion’s was the Kenyan flag. 
---
I do agree some kind of reference to a religion of the entity would be interesting. Or even just some sort of cult leader. 
---
When it comes to console, the nurse. Almost impossible to play and lags like hell when chasing survivors.
---
Onion *Bro.
---
Such a nice, sleepy boi.
---
&gt; but the end times are coming,
---
why the fuck are you freaks so goddamn dramatic? 
---
That's likely not true. You can change your hardware configuration and it will be different. All he'd have to do is change out a stick of RAM or get a new graphics card. 
---
Some home silent hill never occurred to me for a possible DLC. 
---
Now I’m praying it is cause that would be beyond amazing!
---
Him or the Cardinal and I'd be one happy Ghost and Dead by Daylight fan.
---
I am uninformed. Thats why I asked for proof. As I said, I fuckimg hate Trump and his policy and this is interesting. Its just often that those who call someone nazi on the internet like to throw around alligations. Especially the sexual assault kind
---
Still not balanced. Nerf survivor run speed pls.
---
"Oh, it's the Catholic Church!"  
---
*"Oh, it's the Catholic Church..."*
---
This is the most passive aggressive post I've read on this sub *so far*
---
You dont even know who the killer is yet lol chill.
---
Well more likely than not ya know? It’s definitely south of Europe.
---
Flashlights don't blind this killer... instead makes him fly at you super fast
---
OH PLEASE LIKE US KILLERS AREN'T ALREADY AT A DISADVANTAGE 
---
Lmao why can’t the devs just run whispers and find him lol
---
What if they mean “oldest” as in age?
---
That same logic can be applied to the people that say there won’t be any religious themes in the game.
---
I hope to god this is just an elaborate shitpost...
---
I think that happens when the killer leaves just as matchmaking matches you to him. Instead of an infinite loading screen like we used to get we get that now. I say this because mlga shows a ping for a moment then changes to “no players” and that screen comes up after a few seconds. 
---
I think youre off man :( Im feeling some kinda mummy.
---
&gt; Especially the sexual assault kind
---
lmao what the fuck? Are you projecting now? 
---
Also Trump is a sexual assaulter
---
It isn’t but it’s just a dick move
---
Didn't you tell me to kill myself after I told you how its not only survivor mains who complain on this sub? You're one of the most dramatic people on here, AnklePickBro
---
Why are you hiding your perks?
---
The nun would just look like a weird nurse, or even could be made into a nurse cosmetic.
---
Yeah, thats what I mean
---
Wow someone doesn’t enjoy being happy look buddy I know your dad is mad at you and your girlfriend cheated on you but it isn’t my fault you don’t even know me
---
that is also okay! just a thought I had :)
---
Me too I really hope it
---
lmao imagine think Trump isn't a sexual assaulter 
---
(Satirically) Killers need to stay on *their* side of the room! Oh wait GiT gUd CaMpeR
---
freddy is still in the game.
---
Well i meam youre making bold claims over a picture. We have no info yet but a picture so how do you know the killers african? or that they use magic? or that there are religious themes to the killer?
---
Yeah makes sense, but if it is him I am excited to see how they will adapt him!
---
I don't like Matchmaking Posts but tbh I literally just had a Match against Rank 20 - 16 Survivors as Rank 6 Killer and a Match against a Rank 20 Killer with a Rank 2, Rank 6 and Rank 10 Survivor at Rank 9
---
but matchmaking is fine as it is clearly nothing has to be done ^(/s)
---
All this sounds very exciting. 
---
I hardly ever see situations where people successfully use it to get away. The problem is you need to plan to make your escape at the very first window you vault through, and most windows aren't placed in a position for someone to dash around a bunch of corners to successfully juke someone. So most commonly I think people burn it too early since it takes a good amount of luck to actually be near the right window when a chase starts *and* also be far enough ahead of the killer to get the juke.
---
Much more likely to lose someone if you, for example, show them you have Quick and Quiet and then do the ol' crouch in a corner while the killer runs by, like in the shack. They'll check the lockers because the sprint trail ends early and think you fast opened one of them because you have QQ. Works every time.
---
He looks like he’s from slime rancher 
---
The struggle is real when you assume most killers have a brain stem 
---
I see a bunch of pixels. Pixel killer confirmed
---
lol i guess that's true, the lower the rank (around 20) the more killers obsessively check lockers and the higher the rank the less they check but check more clever areas. 
---
Shrek 
---
Dude, I really dont care. I came here for disconnecting survivormains. I dont like Trump, but I wont label anyone a sexual assaulter and especially not a nazi. I want to sleep now
---
Can you give a link of the picture without  walking stats?
---
Nice job by the way
---
At that point id just quit. Some matches are unwinnable and a waste of time. Plus i dont like farming so theres that.
---
I'm pretty sure it's cuz you can literally dc like 20 games and not even get a 30 mins penalty xDDD
---
This is the silent bell add on, that shit is the scariest thing in the game 
---
Being accepted into a group you know you don't belong in:
---
Hmmmm mmmmm mmmmm
---
Ancient. These people try to say that the idea is impossible because of that fact. Which it isn’t. Also, it’s not gonna be from Asia because we already had Rin and if you think India is too different from the farther east you can’t do snow cause we just had that. The only 3 spots they could be from is Africa, I guess India, and Mexico down. 
---
It is. Taking a game hostage. Report him and send an email giving an explanation so they can look into it
---
I really don;t know what this is about, but if your username is a KoL reference that's rad
---
If they made this into a skin that also gets rid of his annoying laugh, that would be even cooler!
---
reddit slowmode doesnt allow for a discussion to appear, I just wanted to say that this survivor vs killer wars remind of todays social problems with sjws and white males
---
long story short: we live in a society
---
Your not. 
---
lmfao
---
"I dont want to label people the things they are and do"
---
No one's talking about the smoke behind the pot
---
lol, my bad
---
Nothing, because flashlights only reflect of his glistening sweaty figure 
---
Almost forgot, BL is also broken in Red Forest! Go into the main building and loop the window on the second floor that drops to the ground 3 times, then as a bonus, loop the two windows that are across from each other on the first, throwing down the pallet outside when the killer is close. Usually you can stall long enough that the second floor window reopens and you get another loop. Absolute nightmare, your teammates can pop 3 gens in the time it takes to close the distance and you only burn one pallet. Also works on the smaller building on that map if the window is placed correctly for a fast vault on the second floor.
---
As a nurse main on Xbox, I have to disagree. It's definitely hard on corn maps and lerys, but it's not as impossible as everyone thinks.
---
The perk is Borrowed Time. As for how to counter it, Make Your Choice or Pig Ambush are the methods I tend to rely on the most. Spirit if you're really good about exactly where to start phase walking. Borrowed Time only works if said survivor is inside your terror radius. 
---
No one is. The game is well balanced 
---
Nah im just joking with ya bud lol maybe there is something there but im blind. If its a djinn you called it first!
---
This beautiful comment totally sums up this sub lolol. I love it :D
---
Yup! Lmao
---
Stacking Very Rare Offerings:
---
* Murky Reagent, I honestly don't know I'm loathe to use it because of how much of a nightmare it used to be.
---
* Petrified Oak, afaik, the distance increase stacks to the max you can apply (4) but becomes slightly less effective when it causes less than the minimum number of hooks to spawn. There will still be places where it's easy to create deadzones in the map, but there will be places where hooks just exist despite the range that's supposed to be between them.
---
* Vigo's Jar of Salty Lips definitely stacks as much as you want, in addition to other luck modifiers. (Up the Ante, namely) Sadly, luck *only applies to the odds of unhooking yourself*. Unless they changed that VERY recently, it was explicitly stated a few months ago that it doesn't effect the odds of pulling rarer items from chests, nor the odds of getting a skill check.
---
i know! lol, we'll see! looking fwd to when they release more info
---
Once again, I hate Trump. That doesnt make him a nazi, nor a sex offender. Stop wasting my time now. I want to sleep
---
Would that be the rose tattoo? 
---
Get out of my swamp!
---
When DBD goes on Sale, so does DLC, except the newest.
---
Oh god, was the Kenya flag a Powerthirst reference?
---
They can run as fast as KENYANS! They’ll get mistaken for KENYANS! And then be deported back to KENYA!
---
Hey remember that one time you were wrong?! 
---
LMAO
---
dumbass
---
&gt; That doesnt make him a nazi, nor a sex offender
---
No it doesn't. The things he says and does do tho
---
Unfotunately silent hill is in limbo rn :( Even though this would be the perfect game for it.
---
Have you ever took drugs then slipped into a barrel then rolled yourself down a hill? Then you're dizzy and high on acid? I haven't but this is something I'd imagined you'd see :P
---
That's a lot of insecurity, it's your game, the perks you choose are the ones you choose, others opinion on your loadout is like someone saying he doesn't like bananas, no one cares.
---
Also that thing you used to hide the perks stands out A LOT, potentially enforcing what you wanted to avoid.
---
GG EZ Babykiller...  
---
^(No, next time, I'll eat you all. Bwahahahahahaha!)
---
You can with cells if I'm not mistaken 
---
*click, tape rewind noise, click* Do you know what time it is? *smashes hammer in  survivor's face*
---
Plot twist: It's actually Father Gaiscone 
---
How ungrateful of All of them. They make money off of people watching this game and they have the nerve to do this? Not cool.
---
This is exactly what’s killing the game for me. 
---
I don’t know how killers mains can jump on here preaching the hit boxes are fine whenever these posts come up.
---
I'm kinda glad it doesn't have that affect. It always used to be 3k for each item in the inner circle, 5k for each item in the middle circle, 8k for the outer circle.
---
Now that prices are fixed to the rarity, getting more rare items means prestige would actually make your bloodwebs more expensive and slow down the grind even further...
---
Ace steals other players valuables and owes everyone money. That’s his unique power. 
---
All the time. Especially this sub. Not as bad as steam forums at least...
---
It is literally impossible to be tunneled as a killer. Tunnel means a killer that goes after the same survivor until its dead ignoring the other survivors .
---
Np man! See you in the fog!
---
Dayyyyum, pretty good JOB so far 
---
&gt;You can with cells if I'm not mistaken
---
You are right, I stand corrected. I always forget that Auric Cells exist. 
---
Y’all need to get your head out of your asses, it’s a rework of the perk not a nerf, plus it’s been a long time coming.
---
Gibus cosmetic when?
---
Konami isn't against licensing their characters. Look at smash bros that has MGS/Castlevania. They license for movies/tv shows.
---
If the devs paid konami enough konami won't say no judging by their history.
---
That said...I don't think they did. 
---
I'm on console, so everytime I turn the camera with max sensitivity the whole screen blurs until I stop moving it. Pair that with shit vision and I'm sure there are survivors walking right besides me and I don't notice 
---
Yea but the thing about reddit is that there’s karma. So reddit is like that one episode from black mirror where you have to please everybody, pretty dumb.
---
Balance issues
---
Yeah I see that. At the same time it could just be from small holes on the sides with smoke going upwards. I wanna be hopeful though! But man a killer that could become smoke god fog offers would be evil but have purpose for killer!
---
Karma is literally nothing
---
I made that mistake a while back with pig though bought just her and I think I did it with clown and Kate as well realized mistake afterwards &gt;-&gt;
---
Onions have layers.
---
Especially in the cornfields haha
---
&gt;Y’all need to get your head out of your asses, it’s a rework of the perk not a nerf, plus it’s been a long time coming.
---
If anything DS will get more use because it punishes tunneling, which is one of the main complaint among survivors. 
---
I'd say prayer beads on Spirit cuz that just comes out without warning
---
Matchmaking is bad because much less people are playing the game.
---
Even the big streamers are sacrificing their income temporarily to play other games. Considering we haven't had any meaningful content since Spirit. I don't blame em
---
My killer games at rank 7 can be instant queues with potato survivors or 10 minute queues just to get 200 ping Asian/European players.
---
My survivor games tend to be instant queues every time, even when I group up (just goes to show you nerfing one side repeatedly in an asymmetrical game without giving anything in return is an awful idea)
---
Oh no damn sorry I meant followed and constantly one player trying to distract me 
---
Increasing repair speed is a bad idea
---
Thanks for your opinion, I agree that running around a pallet is just ridiculous, I dont think it was balanced from the start as survivors could teleport to a pallet, there were such things as insta blind flashlights etc. 
---
But what I wanted to say by this post is the game's perspectives, maybe it is going in the right, balanced direction and we can't tell bc we got used to the old rules of surviving, forgetting about realism or common sense or maybe the balance of the game depends only on community's opinion of fair play. 
---
Our community consists of those killers, who claim that many survivor perks are unbalanced and those, who think that they should just get over it or "git gud" (like me). It is very hard to define what is right. 
---
my boy ;~;
---
Where is he? ;c
---
Outside of the first appearance, it isn’t scary cause you can’t do anything against a prayer beads spirit.
---
Silent bell though, he will be coming around from any corner, planning to fuck you up 
---
The style leans more towards eastern religions, like Buddhism. Evil monk? 
---
Oh look it's the guy throwing his anger out on random strangers in the internet 
---
Well it damn well isn't Ser Davos
---
NOED?
---
Thanks everyone is saying there’s no counter but you proved them wrong 
---
Funniest thing I’ve read all day
---
D'aw, he's just a happy boy.
---
Unfortunately you are wrong. Letting someone bleed out is perfectly fine strategy. For similar reasons Mori spamming is also fine, because you are just bleeding them out. Hexy was talking about it I believe back during the derank discussion streams.

Edit:im bad at English :D
---
Thank you! I am as well. 
---
'Tis not 
---
Well I recorded them so  ^-^
---
Omg this is so good, awesome job!
---
This is a case of damned if you do damned if you don't. Whether or not they cover up their perks doesn't matter my dude.
---
Well that's exactly what teasers are. What you wish you got was a trailer and typically those come after the teasers. They've released a teaser and then a trailer for the past 3 killers so I'm wondering if you're new to the game or just don't pay attention.
---
Man I think if you play the game enough you actually go through all these phases. Regardless of the order.
---
Is it really surprising tho? I never had a legion match which I found satisfying. Thank God I don't face them that much.
---
Would be friggin awesome if his level shifted between reality and the darkness every couple of minutes though!
---
Smh my head indeed
---
~~i'm just tired of waiting for bunny feng :(~~
---
Hahaha its funny because in Spanish "pedo" means fart
---
I liked using the perk « Deja Vu » to learn were gens are as a newbie. You could do the same !
---
It's mostly speculation since he's been known to solicit nudes from all kinds of people, and sometimes trashes them afterwards. He just reads completely sleazy so I personally wouldn't put it past him.
---
I'm not sure why people like to make it a headline rather than a warning, as if they have any specific victims in mind. Nothing has ever outright been confirmed afaik.
---
Almost happened to me. The style of game makes it easier for me to get tilted, plus learning how all the killers work and game mechanics with bad matchmaking...I totally get the newer players being upset about it, cause I was there once. But it's been like this since the game came out basically. I started between Freddy and Pig and it really hasn't gotten any better for the most part.
---
I wish it was pyramid head but him moving fast wouldn't feel right that being said i think its more likely to be a bee then them :/
---
I just found it curious since it's the first time I've seen someone do that for a clip
---
Oh man I had a mismatch last night, played legion for a daily. Everyone was so bad I thought they we're drunk playing. Turns out they we're all rank 20-16 and I was rank 1....
---
Not being insecure, it's removing the focus from something that's not important to the clip. Out of the all the clips I have it on, only 2 people have really asked about it (you being one of them).
---
Yes, "that thing" (which is just a hexagon) stands out, but that not really a bad thing if people still stop and watch the clip.
---
So it's staying on my profile. Have a good day!
---
Ooooh a dijon mustard killer? ;p
---
Not if hes the last person alive then its not okay. At that point what does he have to gain from letting him bleed out? That is easily holding a game hostage because he know theres no way for him the escape via hatch and he cant be healed.
---
I was thinking earlier. How about huntress lullaby on doctor ? Would it be more efficient than unnerving presence ?
---
Oh hell yeah, gonna have to make like all of them really, they're all such cool looking characters!

The fact that it occurs in green ranks tells me they rank up way too much still( your post is about rank 10, once I had 4 bubbas in a row in that rank). And yes 2 kills is not that hard for them especially if they have Noed. Last few times a faced campers it was already kinda high rank and they got 2 kills even though we rushed gens. (Remember that if it's full solo everyone might give it a shot making them lose precious time.)
---
And I still don't get why there isn't a mechanic either rewarding the hooked or entity progression halt for killer inactivity. Or to put it another way, Who is having fun on the picture? True it doesn't happen that often but IF it does?
---
That is so darn cute
---
That seems like a very cool idea for a killer, I hope it's implemented somehow. Though, I remember reading somewhere that the Entity is an "Emotion Vampire". 
---
Inbf “they also said they wouldn’t do a clown as a killer”
---
And yet here we are. 
---
Ok.
---
ur whale come
---
no just got out of the game
---
I’m gonna go out on a whim and take a wild guess. I’m guessing a plague doctor. It looks like whatever it is, is letting off some sort of incense or scent. “In a time of darkness” could refer to the Black Plague which took place centuries ago. A light to follow could be the plague doctors + religion. Plague doctors used to have incense/scents held on their masks to try and deter the plague. 
---
In defense of the people I don’t agree with, politics and religion is different than originality and common phobias. I still think those people are dumb but you get the point.
---
Actual picture of my gaping asshole ready for Mikey! 😉
---
Dear god let the killer just be the band Ghost
---
If explaining where I stand means I'm triggered, then yes!
---
Hmm ill have to dive in that further. But being the entity a physical embodiment of it would be epic playing as the killer. Just hopefully the entity has cooler powers than legion and stronger powers than Micheal or Nurse
---
If this happens and they put those sirens in the map, I will freaking freak the freak out man!!!!!
---
It's worth noting that Make Your Choice only activates at the expense of the person saving, not the person being saved. But it evens out because you're still going to end up with someone on the hook. 
---
Silent Hill would be licensed. I'm pretty sure they already announced that the killer would be available for free (via shards). I do really like your idea though
---
&gt; DWOGHT
---
Petition to officially change his name to this
---
Oh nice, I thought that was just a general idea of what was going to happen, I'm glad to see that we're going to have some changes!
---
can't believe no one heard of the NursexThanos smh 
---
(scoff) *Why* not? I'm gonna need more of a reason, pal. 
---
Agreed. If it is the Entity, it would have to be more powerful than the highest tier killers we've seen so far. 
---
&gt;At that point what does he have to gain from letting him bleed out?
---
Ask him, not me.
---
&gt;That is easily holding a game hostage because he know theres no way for him the escape via hatch and he cant be healed.
---
But bleeding out WILL happen. Dick move? Yes. Holding the game hostage? Dunno, don't think so. It's kinda short.
---
It's a lot better IMO, until they destroy your totem
---
I'll  die happy
---
Happened while I was playing Clown today. The first time I chalked it up to the player not knowing I was close. The second time was almost right after I hooked the Meg again. Decided to go after the farmer instead.
---
Ah the billy buff we all been waiting for. Can't believe the devs ignore him since release /s
---
Just another reason I wish you could change your name on PS4 like you can on PC. 
---
Otherwise itd wouldn't be worth it. Or even make sense if the Entity. The thing thats running the show to be weak
---
get gud, get lmao box
---
Alrighty then ! Ill slap a Thrill of the hunt on this and they will never get a gen done :D
---
A good clown is the worst to play against lol 
---
The Sack. That's the new killer. Takes his whole body and brings it down on Survivors, King K. Rool style. 
---
Totally agree. 
---
This is awesome, thanks!
---
The onion be(h)emoth
---
And that's why we play Clown-boy B-)
---
I’m thinking a mummy 
---
Location doesn’t. Time does. Every location in the world has seen violence and the farther back you go, the more religious it gets. Religion answers questions that we didn’t understand so for example, Aztecs and other Paleo Indians that inhabited Mexico and down were EXTREMELY religious. Nowadays you got Catholics and Christians which IMO, is better than sacrificing people.
---
Edit: Also, you aren’t gonna see architecture like that in modern day Russia. You’ll see that below the equator.
---
But can it be? That’s like saying you can build a higher building than the Bruj Khalifia. It’s possible, but impossible at the same time.
---
I'm the OP here's the original tweet\~
---

---
Sad thing is they are. Against average survivors, the game is fine. But against good survivors that know to just rush gens, then the killer simply does not have enough time to do anything. Gen speeds is the biggest balancing issue in this game.
---
I don't actually use the mori bit, I just like tracking
---
The mummy
---
How much did you get ?
---
With 100% more apron. Thanks for catering to us Trappers fresh off a day in the Works. 
---
Lmao, more thicc killers pls
---
Disagree that it’s pointless, it just changes how the power works like a lot of pink add ons. Just chuck a speed add on on there if you need it
---
I at least recommend getting each one to level 15 so you have four perk slots in case you need to use them for a daily. And even during rank reset I'll bouce to my lower level survivors and give them a shot to see if I'm interested in levelling them up further. Eventually you'll want to get them all pretty high if not just to 40 for the teachables.
---
And indoor maps kick my ass too don't worry lol
---
Wasn't this posted like 5 hours ago?
---
I always thought a cool name for a mummy killer would be "The Cursed"
---
Asymmetrical games are still supposed to be balanced. Right now killers are still OP and still getting buffed but I'm gonna get downvoted anyways because everyone still has PTSD from when survivors were OP.
---
My b I shouldn't of used plagiarize. Cause I wasnt trying to call them out.  Just was excited about my theory and it was insane how close the resemblance was. 
---
Good choice, Friday the 13th is in legal hell so they can't add new content.
---
Thanks a lot 
---
That's because we're not narcs... &gt;.&gt;
---
Shoutout to ochido lol. With all the game copies he’s bought the devs can afford to run this game for years!
---
This is all I ask for surviours,I am new to the game whenever I get home from work (I study and I am a editor) I usually play my beloved huntress but I am a noobie and my apartment doesn't have fiber net and we have wifi ,so playing dbd on wifi with a surviour who's tea bagging you with a flashlight is incredibly frustrating,fam I am trying to play  a game to lighten up my mood not destroy it
---
Whoa sick
---
Billy is the only one I can think of that isn’t optimal here. Most killers thrive in this map
---
Valid strategy tbh
---
I can agree with that. Even as survivor I get annoyed when the gens pop super fast. I join a game to play and have fun, not have it be over in mere minutes and leave with low BP.  I always feel bad for the killer when that happens, should never be waiting to play longer then actual play. 
---
Nurse on The Game also makes my peepee small
---
What? I don’t get it
---
Np, It's the cosmetics I use ingame actually
---
Keep those darn canadians out
---
Love this killer buff
---
Legion has some pretty interesting character design but how they are implemented in-game is rather horrible.
---
Haha there are a lot of them for sure, but you blended the two subjects well B-)
---
That's fair, it's not too great for running around.  Top floor isn't terrible depending on how it's set up but good luck on the bottom floor.  Still 1 hit downs so it isn't...  God awful but it isn't great either.  Practically become a harder to play leatherface.
---
I can hear the laugh now...
---
EHHH HEH HEH HON HON HOOON
---
Ha. 
---
Someone stabbed me with a needle and walked away
---
*Bruh*
---
Nice broken hook
---
I like ochido though lol even if hes a cunt idgaf its a game 
---
Entitled? Are you kidding me ? ENTITILED? 
---
Fam it's a game which is to played to have fun with and this man careear revolves around him destroying other players gameplay
---
Kindly Fack off
---
Close, but not quite
---
I really like the idea of Aicha. Kinda getting tired of all the killers looking ghoulish. I know it’s a horror game but I’d like some more variety in their ideas
---
The nani ? 
---
ENTITY EXPLAIN. EXPLAIN. WHAT YOU MEAN KATE DENSON
---
What do you mean? The hook is clearly broken...
---
Also an alternate title could’ve been: when you run we’re gonna live forever but no one gets injured. 
---
Also Nea's pixie bobs
---
[My first thought was this dude...](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonquest/images/2/26/DQMJ3_-_Gold_slime.png/revision/latest?cb=20170818014132)
---
Love this idea 
---
ERECTO POOTRONASS! (sorry you mentioned HP)
---
Power: unholy congregation, after holding right click for 5 second the papa serenades the survivors. any survivor outside of the papa's terror radius runs towards him for 3 seconds or until they enter his terror radius, afterwards the power goes on cooldown for 15 seconds 
---
Santa Clown is my main as well :)
---
What the fuck did you bring upon this cursed land

---
You can check currently playing with on PS4 if they’re not appearing offline. Not sure about Xbox and pc tho
---
But putting one person on as many gens as possible is the most efficient way to do gens lol. The matches that are the hardest are when only 1 survivor works on a gen at a time, meaning you can't pressure multiple by going there. Discordance is literally teaching survivors how to play more effectively lol.
---
Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition! also it looks nothing like aztec or mayan symbology, so not that.
---
*Old School Death Metal straight from Florida*
---
If it followed revelations (and to be honest, any Silent Hill lore) Claudia would be the killer and PH the survivor 
---
Omg is that PewDiePie 
---
Licensed killers can be bought with shards too
---
Answers question, gets downvoted. 
---
*Feet slaps intensify 
---
The ytb'er haha :&gt; His videos are pretty good.
---
No. I was thinking more like Po, the Kung Fu Panda. The movie.
---
You didn’t exactly answer the question, just gave some sassy response lol
---
We were on the verge of greatness! We were *this* close!
---
I really don't. 
---
Common sense makes him a sex offender- his rallying cry of “grab her by the pussy” is the definition of sexual assault, buddy.
---
I am a hateful shit, but you sound like a real asshole.
---
Well..... because of him we have PEOPLE clauddetts running around tea bagging with a flashlight so....people might not get your point 
---
Any of y’all got a link for the datamined cosmetics? Can’t find them anywhere
---
They also said they wouldn't do clowns according to someone on here but look what they did 
---
THIS IS AMAZING
---
Doing bad things to bad people is not good; neutral at the best.
---
And you couldn’t figure out it’s a reference to a VERY popular TV show (that you might have just not watched) from the title? lol
---
I dodge lobbies that look sweaty to me. If I’m actually tryharding, headset on, full attention to the monitor, etc. then I’ll play whatever lobby I find first. Depends on the mood
---
You don't understand anything which is said do you?
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
They can be bought with Auric Cells, the in game premium currency, but not Iridescent Shards, the level up currency. Otherwise, the people who own them would make no money off of the arrangement
---
 Genuinely ended up being pointless getting Blood Warden cause I always either get 3k, 4K or 0k lmao
---
Why does it have Game Of Thrones font lol?
---
Oh shit
---
Every killer has 1 hit KO, low or no terror radius, ESP up the ass, and is shown survivors left and right. When survivors don’t like something they get a perk to counter, killers get new mechanics and survivor nerfs (including removed survivor mechanics) if they don’t like something. Killer is just too easy now. I know your gonna pull the loop card, but what else is left for survivors? Nothing. It’s all been taken away. Survivors only hope is to waste time and hope the killer gives up before bloodlust kicks in. If that’s not the case then please school me. I have no problem being wrong, it just means from that point on I’m right. 
---
lol im making a sons of anarchy reference...... just kidding around
---
Thank you for adding to this conversation. I feel as if I’m making this too wordy for you. OLD STUFF BELOW THE EQUATOR = PROBABLY RELIGIOUS STUFF AND MAGIC. Thank you for coming to my TedxTalk.
---
Watch the vid? :D
---
Gonna have to agree with you, I googled her, and I found this image: http://bakrim76.canalblog.com/archives/2009/10/22/15407076.html#&amp;ui-state=dialog
---
That hanging thing look familiar? 
---
OH HELL YES!
---
Can be heard in the distance
---
My favorite killer; The Wrth

["Logic is the systematic study of the form of valid inference, and the most general laws of truth."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic) since when do you only need to adhere to logic in a formal debate?"
---
And the game is unbalanced to it's core. A perfect killer playing against 4 perfect survivors will never get a kill because killer relies on the survivors making mistakes. If a game will always have the exact same outcome if two teams of equal skill play against each other, it is not balanced.  You're arguing against the core design of the game; you're making the claim that requires proof.
---
And your "proof" was just saying what you already said but in a different way. all you said was "game is balanced" but in more words. 
---
Oooof imagine a mori where he pushes the survivor down on their knees to pray. I would internally combust
