Ebonies, yes. Ivory, meh. Cypress, should be base
---
I see you are men of crusaders respect
---
Or there's a real life thing but you don't wanna dc
---
Thank you, and yes I‚Äôll definitely be doing a few more of the killers I like
---
Not to mention the shitty frames as killer, god forbid you get bloodlust as you go for a lunge
---
I think DBD should go f2p and monetize with cosmetics and DLC only.
---
holy why are you mean to him did he do anything to you
---
Yeah I uhh, I can't really watch his youtube stuff any more. He's an incredibly nice guy and I've subbed to him a few times because we need that attitude around, but it's gut wrenching watching him make the same mistakes over and over again lol
---
Thank you! It‚Äôll get easier the more you practice :)  I‚Äôm sure your work is great too
---
Please learn to read. I never said anything about scary movie. But anyway, I'm not going to argue with a troll whose goal is to get some attention because his surroundings don't care enough to give him some.
---
you had to specify ‚Äúfor the meme‚Äù lol 
---

---
as far as i can tell, tru3 rarely ever brings moris to toxic swf groups lol
---
We didn't bring the offering so we could "abuse balanced landing" we literally always used balanced landing just cuz its our favorite exhaustion perk.
---
"redefined scary movies forever"
---
But you never said anything about scary movie. Shittlebrick.
---
I‚Äôm strictly playing killer with this up and coming DBP event! The last one was a total shit show and waste as survivor. Either the killers all camped, had the most OP shit on every game, braindead random survivors, and constant DC with 2-5 party streamers 10 seconds into the game. Shirtless Myers will be somewhat on the friendlier side for his up and coming victims!
---
Is this one of those ARGs I've heard about?
---
You go to the menu and it tells you
---
Oh I thought you meant cuz it makes the recovery from hitting a mettle of man not as bad.
---
you have no idea how often as Myers I just tap survivors, turn 360 and walk away. if I was recording you'd hear a smooch each time I bodybump them
---
Yet another person who can't grasp the concept of a *joke* yet thinks *I'm* the one being stupid. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
If *not* being a whiny entitled brat who thinks quickly pushing a button is too hard and something actually worth complaining about  makes me "stupid" then I don't want to be your definition of smart.
---
You're thinking of JRPG dumbass. This is a survivor action game.
---
Oh yea? I never noticed that! I‚Äôll try that at the end of my next march. Thanks Arizona_Slim!!!!
---
Trapper:  ‚ÄúOjomo, what does the scoreboard say about his survival level?‚Äù
---
Wraith:  (Alt+F4 out of the game)  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over SIX THOUSAAAAAAND!‚Äù
---
Trapper:  ‚ÄúWHAT, SIX THOUSAND?!  There‚Äôs no way that can be right!‚Äù
---
Tru3 gets shit on so much haha
---
But he plays amazingly, imo
---
Make sure you scroll all the way right
---
It isn't. You can play the mobile version on the ghost face leaked build.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_MvbUqOVJic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MvbUqOVJic) 
---
\^ This one works
---
I'd play Pig to get revenge and Ghostface once he drops.
---
can you drop survivors after picking them up? I recall being able to do it but playing earlier and I could not figure  it out . I use it to force them out at the end. get off my property!
---
People who call other people snowflakes are the actual snowflakes. And this is from someone who plays only killer and Feng Min occasionally.
---
Didn‚Äôt the devs mention that they were going to do a system like this across dbd?
---
I could go on in length about how many times this happens per session I play of Dead By Daylight. It's around ten times each session, which is insane. I know I could just leave, but why is the first option to avoid toxicity in the game, not even an option the Developers made. That's just screwed up in my opinion, and I think the report system needs to be fixed to better combat toxicity. The report system should notify a player when their report lead to a player getting punished, that would help a lot of things. Reports should also just work, because clearly they don't since toxicity never stops, it just keeps getting worse and worse. I'm just sick and tired of every game being the same old thing. The Developers should've fixed this years ago, but they just don't seem to care.
---
Because you can counter it??
---
FRANK WEST IS COMING YOU SAY?!
---
Neither side takes long for me unless I'm in a SWF group
---
Yeah
---
Bam! Bum! Bam Bum!
---
&gt;I wish the Developers cared about it enough to fix the report system.
---
Whats there to fix? Exactly?
---
AFAIK the report system works, all you have to do is... report the player.
---
When you set urself up to be circle jerked as hard as he did, you kinda deserve it
---
There is no ptb on console ...
---
I asked you to support your stance, you have yet to do that. You can‚Äôt change my mind without providing some sort of argument.
---
I understand your joke, im saying why on earth did you just randomly make that joke?  I dont understand the context that made it come up.
---
No one thinks its that big of a deal, its just objectively a bad game mechanic. Every reason you've given as to why its good has been complete bogus
---
Macros cannot get you banned.
---
I've been using macros for struggle and wiggle for pretty much all 1300 hours I've played this game.
---
No I know I should have been more clear that this question is geared towards pc players
---
Killers and survivors on the PTB are always accessible. You still have to level them up with bloodpoints unless you do kyf.
---
I played against him once. He was a Ruin, Bamboozle Billy and it was a pretty fair Azaroths map. He complained the whole match about looping even though he never tried any mind games and only pulled out his chainsaw to gain distance on survivors. 
---
Then the following matches, he used Franks Mixtape Legion. 
---
Then he played Huntress and kept going on about how good of perk Monitor &amp; Abuse is on her (it's not really)
---
Haven't bothered to watch him since.
---
I believe everyone gets to play em, Im console myself tbh
---
Ptb on the 4th I believe, and released on the 18th
---
I feel this in my soul
---
With that Fashion sense, he must be The Doctor.
---
It would be extremely difficult to DC so quickly after a swing like she did. Odds are it wasn't an intentional DC. 
---
Also, "Only survivors DC".
---
...Nobody says that.
---
They called bill a paragraph and they called leatherface a paragraph
---
Yup. That‚Äôs exactly it. It‚Äôs kinda buried, and I thought something like that would of been more visibly accessible. 
---
Thanks though! Now I know where to look ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Saw your post about that. Awesome rng.
---
He also said that you are actually good players, but sadly you prefer to only use the bulding + BL against a huntress instead of actually playing the game.
---
Someone has to r/copypaste this asap lol.
---
Of course. I play fighting games too. Which is exactly why I don't want pointless mashing mechanics in other games. It's not good gameplay or a fun design.
---
Whenever I fuck up a skillcheck, I immediately get up from the generator and point for them to leave and then go right back to working. If someone's gonna die for that fuckup it's gonna be me, like it or not.
---
I swear every salty survivor just expects killers to not use any perks at all then complains when they do
---
I play Nurse so SWF mean nothing to me
---
grow up, dude
---
Nah
---
You do realize 5 Blink Nurse is a troll build that sucks right?
---
there's nothing to talk about here.
---
obviously, it was a joke, if you can't see that you've got your own problems to deal with.
---
if somebody is affected by a joke about the colour pink, they have their own problems too.
---
you are acting childish, hence why i called you a child. children aren't always the most mature of people, which is shown by you being upset over something that is literally harmless.
---
it's not gatekeeping.
---
I don't want to farm or let every one go easy if there's a dc almost every other game. If it was a rare occasion, sure. Not when it's 1/2 of all games.
---
Yeah its interesting if people are around.
---
We are the enlightened
---
Bro I swear I played with you earlier today, what do you play on?
---
Deerstalker Freddy OP, plz nerf
---
I was being sarcastic lol...
---
I wish people wouldn't call me racial slurs, but that doesn't happen.
---
Probably not cause mobile has Bill.
---
The game's definition of perfect game is litearlly hooking each survivor 3 times if im not mistaken. Can't let a survivor stage on hook or die in struggle ever.
---
Lies? Your last video shows who is the liar men...i was the only one toxic and we wasnt swf and you put "TOXIC SWF GETS GREEDY"
---
i dont care if people hate on me but shaming randoms player that have nothing to do with my toxic words at  the end is just sad true
---
I miss when 72 played this game.
---
highest i got with surv was rank 10 lol
---
I‚Äôm not a 2016 player but I remember some of the stuff here, and I miss them, like the brown and pink perks, and the other map offerings and the brightest and darkest moonlight offerings

watching this daily
---
I hope hes actually viable
---
Did all of those. Got a 32K game. Was just gatekeeping. I think because I closed the hatch but also there was only two gens left.
---
I used ‚Äúbase‚Äù wrong, but it‚Äôs a free killer that is included with any and every download of the game. OP is asking about buying.
---
I reckon there‚Äôs someone out there who says only survivors DC.
---
Everyone says that lol
---
Thats what that little box on the side is for.
---
I'm guessing it's cause it's more stressful playing as survivor, it's a horror game for them, the game is based around two sides where they are always in a stressful position, you can't kill the killer, he's invincible, that's why losing hurts cause it feels unfair... It's not, but whatever.... Idk
---
Well, it only takes a few minutes on this sub to know that's wrong. Lol.
---
Not necessarily. The leaks were from an early dev build of the mobile version that's pretty much just the PC version with a few changes. Bill may be removed before then.
---
Keep track of where dull totems are if you don‚Äôt want to cleanse them, like keep mental note of the general area. Trust me, it‚Äôll save you from noed facecampers if you can get good at memorizing where shit is
---
No you don't, they're availability for everyone to try and give feedbacks.
---
I hope this is a joke.
---
I don‚Äôt know enough about the other movies you mentioned to know if this is satire, but I sincerely hope it is.
---
No, basically everyone agrees with you that she didn't need this nerf. She was already pretty mediocre, and they announce something that could make her power insanely good endgame, and then make it literally useless by that time instead.
---
Definitely not a troll
---
Honestly three years into the game you can find gameplay tutorials all over the place.
---
When I want to watch someone play this game, I kind of want their personality mixed in.
---
New killer and survivor are free in the PTB. Still have to pay in final version though.
---
Ah darn. Looks like I may need to give up on steam and try it out on Xbox then. Thanks for letting me know! I‚Äôd seen similar stuff but wasn‚Äôt sure how far behind my video card was. Either way, thanks again!
---
I‚Äôm new, and not that great either. üòÇ
---
A very horrible nurse that plays with a console controller. No shame in my game. ü•¥
---
Pretty sure his model wouldn't be there in the first place if he wasn't playable. Maybe they're bringing him to console? Probably not tho.
---
Hi new, and not that great either. üòÇ
---
a very horrible nurse that plays with a console controller. no shame in my game. ü•¥, I'm dad.
---
Look at his profile
---
Correct
---
because you encounter one killer every game and 4 survivor's every game, so there is a greater chance of encountering a survivor who is "insert adjective here" than a killer who is.
---
What do you mean by tunneling and why is it abusive?
---
Daddy?
---
What is there to support? I don't see it as cheating, you do. Neither of us are going to change our mind. There's nothing more to discuss, so like I said - have a nice day.
---
Dailies*
---
Yep.
---
Ghostface is one of the most recognized slashers in pop culture so i dont know what your talking about. Also his first movie was really good.
---
That's why you always get Killer challenges, to make you play the side you do less often.
---
Yes, but you have to buy Surveillance since you can only have two perks in a bloodweb.
---
Because SWF offers a huge advantage and it turns bad players into decent players. You guys will still get shit on if you‚Äôre terrible and the killer is good, but that‚Äôs the concept.
---
Imo i think you should buy the game, as for the dlcs i suggest getting the licensed dlcs only. You can grind for the unlicensed dlcs in game.
---
The licensed dlcs are: 
---
Ash Vs Evil Dead
---
The Saw Chapter
---
A Nightmare On Elm Street
---
Leatherface
---
The Halloween Chapter
---
The rest of the dlcs you can buy with ingame curreny (shards).
---
That‚Äôs a mori
---
Stop getting trolled.
---
Yes me
---
I play with some friends from time to time and one of them is so toxic to the killer. So i dont really bother if hes hooked :0
---
I don‚Äôt like killer though. That‚Äôs fucking stupid
---
Had a game the other day where we cleansed all totems (playing solo) against a spirit I was barely able to escape after 99%ing a gate and then juking her while the other two got off the hook and opened the other gate needless to say they were probably tilted when that first hit didn't 1 shot and then the next hit was while I was escaping. Never have I seen a faster DC.
---
Do u happen to have the original
---
Nice bait try harder next time son
---
I know you won't understand this, but a report system works, if the problem starts to decrease, the problem hasn't been decreasing, it's been increasing. They need to actually punish people who've been reported, and they need to send a notification to the player who reported the other player, that their report did something.
---
RBT
---
Camped
---
Hatchet
---
Nurse
---
Stun
---
True, but I don't understand the point of pairing it with Corrupt Intervention.
---
Same here, i really like Freddy but the current freddy makes me real frustrated so i play the shape instead. Cant wait for the rework!
---
No, ghost face sucks
---
Barry would be even more hot if he didn‚Äôt teabag üòòüòòüòò
---
No he's not. He's only remembered from the Wayne brothers sequels. No one cares about scream
---
They did. 
---
This is one of, if not the only totem in the game that‚Äôs super out in the open
---
You have no come back so make lame comment
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeSv8udeFa4
---
DCing does suck but if teabagging is ruining your experience you should consider not playing the game.
---
Most online games for that matter really. If someone crouching a few times makes you angry enough that you're not having fun then the shit people do in most online games would likely be the same.
---
If you dislike getting trash talked you can disable chat with the arrow or just leave. and once again if you have a problem with Trash talking I don't know how you can stand playing online games because trash talking happens in pretty much every game that lets you communicate with people you're playing with
---
Figured that would be the case, thanks
---
Not clicking your virus
---
Oh trust me Barry doesn't, that's why he has a humongous penis
---
Then tell me why you think it isn‚Äôt cheating... Unless you don‚Äôt actually have anything that supports that view aside from your feelings.
---
When at least 2 gens were needed?   Thats how it is now...
---
So what are you talking about?
---
*stares at you... what... are you fapping?*
---
What's not to understand about correlating a finger slipping and missing a button press being your character's hand slipping as it fends off the Entity and them getting killed? ü§î It's pretty straight forward.
---
&gt;No one thinks its that big of a deal, its just objectively a bad game mechanic. Every reason you've given as to why its good has been complete bogus
---
Never said it was good. Just that it's an extremely dumb and entitled thing to complain about, especially considering how basic Survivor gameplay is in general.
---
With any popular game you are bound to run into some toxic people. As for the game as a whole, it's very fun to play. Not to mention they are making tremendous improvements in the future: new killer/survivor every three months, new battle pass, dedicated servers, etc. My advice is to be willing to purchase one or two dlc's to get some decent perks in your other killer's bloodwebs: ruin, overcharge, bbq and chili, etc.
---
I‚Äôve literally never had anyone complain about swf, I mean I get they get deff get annoying, I‚Äôm not a killer main, but I‚Äôve never had anyone go out of their way to complain about it lol
---
Hatch will spawn with one survivor left even with no gens repaired
---
I would recommend to play some survivor with a friend. Maybe chuck on some fun perks and mess around. Or if you wanna play killer, mess around with the survivors. Play as the Pig and do gens with the survivors? Be a head nodding hag, etc. This game can be very stressful, and taking a step back can help that stress.
---
Best wishes &lt;3
---
Ya that when I have to bust out P3 billy and be try hard bc I'm tired of getting shit on when everyone runs that perk
---
1/10 needs more wazzzzzzzzup
---
Not always. Part of mindgaming is occasionally faking a shift.
---
I think it is the feeling of frustration towards your fellow survivors not playing effectively as well as having a killer it feels like everyone is against you.
---
Everyone has their own play style. I might have an unpopular opinion, I main survivor. I don't get mad when killers tunnel, that's their strategy. The goal of the killer is to kill however they want too.
---
You're not going to change your mind. I don't want to argue pointlessly on Reddit. You have yourself a nice day.
---
On the dev build he could stalk survivors without his stealth, but it took more than 4 seconds. I think its fair.
---
Because i just imagine survivors with OOO perk nullify Ghost's whole kit.
---
So you were using that as an actual argument? This is a fucking video game saying that it should be realistic like that is beyond moronic.
---
Why not complain about it? Its an easy fix and maybe the devs will see it and take note. nothing wrong with improving the game
---
Let's be real for a min, though.
---
EGC is heavily killer sided (not that it's necessarily bad). Survivors are just getting a lucky escape when they find the hatch first. No, you're not being punished. You got a 3K, you already won.
---
With any popular game, you are bound to run into some toxic people. That's just a small price to pay for an overall decent game. They are also making tremendous improvements and creating new additions this year. I would also recommend committing to more than just the base game (i.e. the dlc's) if you want to be really involved and to get the most out of it.
---
I‚Äôm pretty shocked to read these comments saying they don‚Äôt watch true anymore. I didn‚Äôt like him at first but right now I think he‚Äôs the best YouTubed for dbd. He‚Äôs a great player and I think he‚Äôs just criticizing the game and balance, I don‚Äôt see it as whining
---
Nope it will open even if 5 gens are left
---
You're talking about Frank's and Julie's knife
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But what about Susie's pointy ruler or Joey's karambit?
---
Knives
---
Is a 3k kill considered a win? I always felt like if I don't get all 4 I'm shit :(  
---
I wish there was a more skill-based option for the last survivor. Being "lucky" has no counterplay :(
---
Lol wish I was one of your survivors then I always have it spawn under the killer's feet then both exit gates are a stone's throw from each other.  Either slug the second to last person and look for the hatch or if it isn't visible just know you've already won and go looking.
---
hay
---
Hes concept is cool but at the end of the day he is  the same strength or even considerably weaker than freddy. Hes got a power that makes first hits easy and is primarily for applying pressure but cant down with it.
---
Is that game still any good anyways?
---
Get used to being 3ks being wins.
---
Or else you‚Äôll feel bad a lot.
---
&gt;I know you won't understand this, but a report system works, if the problem starts to decrease, the problem hasn't been decreasing, it's been increasing. They need to actually punish people who've been reported, and they need to send a notification to the player who reported the other player, that their report did something.
---
I don't know what to tell you. People are getting punished if they break the rules. 
---
I wouldn't mind receiving a notification about whether or not the reported person got punished but this doesn't change the fact that they do get punished.
---
I don't have the stats to firmly say that the issue is increasing or decreasing but what I do know is, people don't believe the report system and therefore they don't care about breaking the rules. The same applies for people that don't bother to report because they don't believe it works.
---
We won't see any improvement until this mentality is changed. Disrespectful players won't stop until they get suspended and this won't happen until people care enough to report.
---
Yes, that's the weakest and is basically the equivalent of rancor except it's more predictable and you have to get the game down to one survivor. I'm ok with stuff like that, I just wish they'd put in drawbacks for stuff like the ebony  version. They put drawbacks on common addons, why can't they do it on the op stuff?
---
After the EGC nerfs for Pig, I‚Äôd say anybody but her unfortunately.
---
3k hatch is definetly a win. Id say 3 kill is a win in any shape form or whatever.
---
Well for end game. NOED obviously...
---
I just watch him because it's fun to watch a toxic asshole. Same reason people like Tyler1.
---
Even now, a full team with brand new parts takes as little as 5 seconds to complete a generator.
---
Susie's pointy ruler is a sharp ruler with metal parts and tape though
---
Yours seems to be the less common opinion, why do you think not?
---
I agree for the most part, although a lot of red rank and purple rank players have been spamming ggez nonstop in my games recently, how a rank 12 Killer like me gets matched with purple and red rank players is beyond me, but yeah that's my experience.
---
I've just considered a 2k and above a win. Half and above sounds fair for a win scenario.
---
It‚Äôs a knife with extra steps
---
I was thinking about picking this game up, but your comment and this post have me scared. How often do long queues like that happen?
---
Infectious Fright is worth it.
---
If there isn‚Äôt a steady balance between killer and survivor, queue times will become longer than they already are.
---
Killers probably dealt with a lot of em today. Swf sunday as always. Its why I steer away from dbd during holidays and weekends.
---
So you're saying that this one relatively fresh perk is toxic and broken, so here's a list of killer add-ons you're going to use that have been part of the game for years now that you can use to fuck survivors over by tenfold
---
Your confidence on your drawings enrages me to my deep core, you talented fricker
---
#KETCHUP ACE
---
Atleast its a single use as well as a add-on not a offering which then you can run add-ons on top of. Don't really think either is that fair just that moris are on a whole different level since its quite rare to see more then 1 instaheal unless it is a SWF.
---
What do you mean, like after they've been hooked the second time and removed, or while they're on the second hook and struggling? Because they already instantly die on the third hook unless they have slippery meat.
---
Glad to see you put a lot of thought into this.
---
u/_InsertNameHere__ posted the format on r/MemeFormatsOfficial
---
Scream is one of the most iconic slashers up to date. You may not care about Ghostface, but many, many, other people do.
---
It is. It also depends on how good the survivors were, the map, how you personally felt about the game, etc. But on a general basis, 3K is not a loss. The devs want 2 and 2 escapes on average per game. 
---
There is no skill involved in a 1v1 I agree, and there shouldn't be because the killer would destroy the survivor no matter what. The endgame is supposed to give the survivor a very small, yet not impossible chance to escape. It doesn't mean you didn't do good. You can always slug if you really want the 4K. Or you can look for the hatch when you feel like the game is going to end soon.
---
So is ruin needed for every killer I mean can you reach high ranks without it ?
---
So you're saying that people that play this game as a team and try to win are just as unfair as being able to skip two thirds of the game's hook mechanics?
---
Only old people
---
The thing I'm most mad about is the fact that its called a **BUTTERFLY KNIFE** but it's just a **SWITCHBLADE**
---
I guess that's true. I do actually remember one game where I found both the remaining survivors in the basement. Dwight started pointing at the closet, Adam gets out and starts pointing at Dwight, and I had to call in my bf to make the choice on who would live and who would die. That kind of stuff is fun, probably not for Adam though :')
---
It's not fixed if there are still totems in the wide open man. That's not what fixed means
---
That‚Äôs just unlucky really because if you both don‚Äôt know where the hatch the is the killer has advantage.
---
Do you mean keys or instaheals? Also, if so, do you think the devs should allow you to see item inventory in the pre-game lobby to be able to counter op items? This might also result in people leaving more pre-game lobbies and lots of last second item shuffling to get the otherside to not bring anything strong.
---
Congrats. You took the worst totem in the entire game and then say the devs haven‚Äôt fixed anything. 
---
Stop crying.
---
Fuck leatherface
---
death to all p3 claudettes
---
Perks: Bitter Murmur, Blood Warden, NOED, and Remember Me.
---
Add Ons: Jigsaw‚Äôs Sketch and Tampered Timer.
---
Save your RBTs until there are one or two gens left, but make sure you use them before the last gen pops or they won‚Äôt activate because of the EGC nerf.
---
Yeah me personally 90% of my dbd content comes from monto bc im a killer main and i dont pay attention to anyone else besides a guy named omegavaleron on twitch.
---
Well, I'm open to hearing peoples' reasoning, but they definitely seem broken when there's no way to anticipate their use before the game starts and counter them.
---
I could write an essay on why your opinion isn‚Äôt of value but let‚Äôs be honest here, you really aren‚Äôt worth it. 
---
Ghostface is coming and people are happy about it, period :)
---
I chose ebony moris as an example, they're clearly not the only items that have balance issues.
---
That might be a solution. Do you think the game would lose any replay value or excitement if these items were removed, despite being more balanced?
---
Billy. 
---
Blood warden. Bitter murmur/Rancor. BBQ. Deerstalker. 
---
It works and it isn‚Äôt the traditional go to, but it works.
---
Identity v is a fun game.

I need a tutorial on how to do it on console.....

While you do have a point that people who, like me don't believe the report system works won't report, therefore it won't work for those people, like I said, that starts somewhere, it starts because we have reason to doubt the system.
---
Yeah, she told us.
---
Especially on killers like doc, in my opinion al his perks besides overcharge suck ass on him
---
More people know ghostface than pinhead.
---
Yes, but I think it is too Killer sided 
---
DBD is more balanced

Well overcharge depends more on the survivors abilities but Monitor and Abuse is alright, especially paired with whichever addon has the same effect. Gives you a real small terror radius in punishment.
---
Hatch will spawn for the last survivor no matter what. Don't need to even touch a gen for it to spawn of the other three are dead.
---
First one (the ultra rare) is a New Moon Bouquet, which made the lighting of the map 75% darker. The second (the uncommon) is an uncommon map offering for Crotus Prenn Asylum and the third (the common) is a common map offering for Haddonfield.
---
Moon Bouquets were removed in Patch 1.8.2 (as in removed from spawning in the bloodweb, and in 2.3.0 they were disabled preventing them from being used even if you had one) and the Common and Uncommon map offerings were removed in Patch 1.8.0.

Susie: *whimpers*

Yup
---
Has he ever lost something and just accepted it? I stopped watching because he would lose like 1 in 15 games in DBD, than scream about balance. You are MEANT to lose sometimes for it to be balanced . . .
---
But we have to agree the only thing Identity V did better than DBD was the lore
---
What is reddit account?
---
Though having bad internet is an issue he‚Äôll hopefully fix, that shouldn‚Äôt discard someone‚Äôs right to play a game. It mainly affects him anyway
---
Holy shit, this guy‚Äôs an asshole!
---
Or a grade A troll, but probably an asshole!
---
They buffed her crouching speed to 1.3 seconds, increased her terror radius by 4 (28-&gt;32) , and traps won‚Äôt activate after all gens are done, you need to have placed them before the last gen is popped or they won‚Äôt go off.
---
it was still a PC build. removing him takes SOME work. he was in there because they had no reason to remove him yet
---
I believe the ‚Äúlie‚Äù most people feel is in reference to the graphic that displayed during the dev stream that said both tiers will be available through ‚Äúgameplay‚Äù
---
Yeah, but his videos are full of him constantly complaining. He‚Äôs just a big egoist, I can‚Äôt stand him
---
RBT is rarer than mori so I'd love to see it.
---
Tunneled, at least I get to do *something*, even if it's go down again lol.
---
Hatchet, because that's just impressive.
---
5blink Nurse, I'm on console so they suck. 
---
Stun the Pig! No mercy! Plus her noise is adorable!
---
I couldn't agree more, this sounds like a fantastic system, much better than my idea.
---
Eat my ass
---
Wtf lol
---
Decisive strike timer shouldn‚Äôt go down when being chased
---
What the hell, dude....
---
Because it was literally hurting peoples' eyes. The way you're asking sounds like you have a problem with it.
---
If you‚Äôre gonna troll, at least know the ghost face parody killer was only in the first scary movie .... not in any of the sequels. Scary Movie is separate from Scream.
---
This troll post was such a reach man, almost made me feel bad for you.
---
I mean, it would make sense if it was, but her big problem is just that her add-ons just aren't worth a whole lot. I think the only two that are good are VHS Tape and Combat Straps, and the only one that is interesting is Amanda's Secret which needs a buff in range.
---
She needs help with her add-ons.
---
‚ÄúHurrr durrrrr only scrubs play Blendette‚Äù
---
when were you yelled at tho?
---
So for The Legion, the janitor part but now they're killers?
---
I get what you're saying and actually completely agree. I wish they had a bigger team for qol and bugs.
---
The thing is, the peiple working in that dept aren't the ones working on another. So the animation team, logically speaking, could work on moris while the bug team does their stuff simultaneously without effecting each other at all.
---
To get an killer to level 50 I would you would need 1.5mil blood points but to prestige them to p3 I would say 4-5mil or around there but to get all perks and not prestige I would have no clue
---
She is so unique!
---
Lol just dont do gens üòÖüòÖüòÖ
---
Hopefully less. The devs are going to work on game health, and the slew of new people coming in will give it more players = less wait for lobbies
---
Wtf??? The arabic text says "Victory Royale" btw. But still wtf?
---
He fucked this up, but Lithe definitely saved you
---
That's not the definition I think your talking about r/dbdgonewild moris

Ecks dee jahger no acog v]funny

I‚Äôd play them

Just increases bleed frequency
---
teased a while ago. fully revealed friday. will be playable soon
---
Identity V will not be remembered as the blatant copy of DBD that it was, but rather it will be remembered for the minuscule new ideas it brought to the table.
---
Same
---
I know this is a really stupid question but I gotta ask eventually,  what is swf
---
Man he had you fucked too, EDC pinned in a corner, decent play tbh.

Yeah, wish my teammates were like that...

If your going for transition mindgames for downs i recomend replaceing blood warden with sloppy or clourophobia. Otherwise i recomend SF + Enduring.
---
I miss the different tier map offerings, most of all I miss the moonlight offerings üò≠

That guy has been sprinkling it all over this post hoping that it triggers someone. Small brain tactics
---
fun myers map. only played on it once

üíÄüíÄüíÄ

More.
---
plz dc from lif
---
Have you tried turning it on and off again?
---
Also the micronapping invisibility could be good for mindgames.
---
Yep
---
The fact need was emphasized had me cackling for some reason.
---
Possible but I‚Äôd doubt it unless most people are that salty on consoles
---
And also, the prices are just dumb. Like, I will *never* purchase a secondary weapon for *five* dollars even if it's for my favorite killer. In other games, that would've bought you an entire premium skin with special voice-lines and effects. Even *two-fifty* for Doctor's metal baseball bat would be pushing it.
---
*cries in z block and red paintbrush*
---
They will probably still test this in the ptb, but id say it would give him immune since, it would be really easy to defeat his power with object of obsession. He would have no terror radius and you will be able to just see him and 'stun' his ability.
---
I think those will work the same way event rewards now work. Able to be earned during the temporary period and then they open up to cell purchase afterwards.

I also gad to ask things like "what is RNG?". It's pretty normal to people not know what some things mean, don't worry, mate.
---
He could place snares to shut down loops or fake their placement to hit the survivor as their abandoning.
---
Fuck
---
ye bud but before i continue i was a lot more toxic back in the day and said the gamer word

if you want proof genny boi is monto he made a video about it probably search up LERY'S NO GEN DOC BUILD and it'll show up

Posted it 5 mins ago but it got deleted for some reason.
---
While I agree this guy is in the wrong, half the killer mains on this sub complain about swf, since it‚Äôs typically unfair.
---
My favorite are the ones who slap Thrill of the Hunt on their Hex totem and abandon everything to protect it. I did a match against a killer like this recently and I just baited them over the entire match. I unfortunately got crap for points but we all escaped. Everyone did gens and I‚Äôd just every now and then start working on the totem for a few seconds then the killer would come over. Fun times.
---
and?  failling to defend your totem isn't a rebuttal.  there's also make your choice, haunted ground, rancor, iron maiden, exposed addons, there are MANY counters to MoM.
---
Tbh I didn't like these kind of titles but then I started to look at the fun of it. Tru3 is a fine lad, he just says his opinion so he shouldn't get some crap. We all have some kind of ego and I don't think his is so high for people to talk about it so much. It's just like someone said, you hear his opinion because he's a streamer and you don't get to hear the average.
---
In terms of youtubers/streamers I think tru3 is in my top5 with noob3, monto, zubat and hexy. Puppers is funny but I just rarely get to cath him on stream. I used to watch Jen but tbh I got bored of rank 8 survivor gameplay. Also I really can't stand one of the guys she always plays swf with. That one truly has an ego problem.
---
Not if your smart and actually check your totem once in awhile or run Thrill of the hunt
---
This is gold
---
Photos taken 5 minutes before disaster
---
If I find out someone hast ToTH, I just remember dull totems and wait until they pick up someone to start spamming M1 on the dull totem to annoy the shit out of them. Probably the only toxic behavior I do I guess.
---
That's not the point. You're still not understanding that it's messed up for the players to have to do the work of the Developers. The Developers have the job of dealing with toxicity, not the players.
---
LMAOOO
---
There‚Äôs shitty people on both sides.
---
I think it's fair If the killer gets 5 perks no matter what. After all the game is supposed to be asymmetrical
---
Some people need to grow the fuck up, jeez. I would just ignore the chat &amp; move on. As long as you‚Äôre having fun, that‚Äôs all that matters. 
---
Good luck in your future matches!
---
True, and Farmer's excitement over new Legion was kind of precious.
---
Your lockers will be violated.
---
I'm sorry I cannot empathize with this killer. 
---
But I'm also a Nurse main and we're known for making ur SWF squads ragequit
---
speedtests are typically best case scenarios, because they choose a server that is close to you. 
---
whereabouts are you located? do other people in your general vicinity have the same issue?
---
I did see it and it was him so it makes you wonder what else he does off video, it's kinda reasonable that he's toxic back to you but he doesn't show it on video
---
Ok no it did not count a tunneling Killers because a killer could not tunnel you and it would still activate.
---
In fact if a killer camps you until struggle stage and then tunnels you and hooks you right back up they could avoid MoM in general
---
I was kinda thinking the same. Like i know why he titles his videos like that, but does it not kinda invite people to mock those titles eventually?
---
How is that fighting back their toxicity?! They just playing the game lmao
---
You're saying the strong perks got nerfed while killer perks remain the same. Doesnt that mean that killer perks are stronger?
---
Body blocking is on the fence. AFK is totally shitting and the fact that people celebrate and cheer it is really toxic
---
Toxic survivors don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unfair, they‚Äôre just defending their pride like little bitches.
---
Run self care 24/7 and he will waste a ton of time putting you to sleep during the match.
---
You don't waste time blowing up gens/running to them and can sometimes get a skill check mid chase.
---
Located in America. This is not an issue with the PlayStation in the same house, and that‚Äôs on WiFi. This happens regardless of killer ping. I was just listing speedtest specs to confirm my base internet connection stats.
---
Happy pride month
---
I see we disagree fundamentally.
---
Yeah I think it‚Äôs a lot of fun, but I really won‚Äôt play it anymore when DBD mobile comes out
---
Go to hell
---
Would be nice. I had a teammate msg me after a game chewing me out about ‚Äúregressing gens‚Äù, even though I‚Äôd made every skillcheck that round. I told them who I was playing and they had the wrong player. At least they apologized, though!
---
It‚Äôd be nice to know who to message ‚Äúthanks‚Äù to if a particular player repeatedly saved me during a game, too!
---
You used to be able to tell who the killer was by checking the hooks, eg the haddonfield hooks if it's myers. Obviously not great for stealth killers, so now the hooks are based on which map you're in.
---
Ah, Panda, we love you. 
---
I can say I learned so much from his videos when I started and he‚Äôs one of the most down-to-earth and wholesome content creators in the community.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4, not XBox, but in that panda spirit, if there are any new PS4 users that want to play with someone and get help learning the game, don‚Äôt be afraid to friend request me. ‚úåÔ∏è

What is Daddy Myers doing
---
i mean at first i didnt say anything the other survivors did and then he went off on a rant about how much money he made and how hes gonna ban me. ive also seen others say the same thing about monto.  
---
but you know if he included the part where hes toxic he wouldnt be able to take the moral highground.
---
and you will waste tons of your time in other games.
---
That‚Äôs cringe
---
100% agree
---
OINK
---
 O7
---
Yeah I really like him since he's always nice and not being toxic all the time but like you're saying, he's a different person off camera
---
Yikes
---
The ultra rare is the new moon bouquet. It increased the moonlight, making it easier to see. But this caused issues with Lery's/The Game, and was an an issue when designing maps, so they were removed.
---
That's hemorrhage
---
Just make a no perks / add-ons gamemode
---
Freddys ability only helps in slowing the game down so yeah he will be easy to loop and if you get hit you could drop a pallet and self care to get a skill check. I recommend running bond so you won't run into your teammates causing him not to pull them into the dream(plus bond is a good perk in general so yeah).
---
Ah cool, thanks for answering. So what the hell is the point to those mods?! I'd love if they did a pass over Leatherface's addons. Some of them are just trash.
---
Sounds like it doesn't so today we both learned :)
---
You right idk why I even bother
---
I‚Äôve never been trash talked in Superfighter‚Äôs Deluxe.
---
I‚Äôve rarely been trash talked in Team Fortress 2.
---
I‚Äôve never been trash talked in Stick Empires.
---
I‚Äôve never been trash talked in Ace Attorney Online.
---
I‚Äôve rarelu been trash talked in Town of Salem.
---
My point is, your last statement is blatantly false. There are plenty of competitive games that you will rarely get trash talked in. There‚Äôs no excuse for the amount of toxicity in the DBD community.
---
Did you have a seizure while writing the title?
---
A moment for my friend was on his first match as Claud, we didnt know what the killer was and when someone broke the ruin totem, we get to know its 3 blink with legacy set nurse. He refused to play if its nurse to this day. He was 20 and i was 11 but the killers come in purple ranks. He is kinda tired of playing when i told him this game is not that much of a biggie. Sad times.
---
i love me some monto, boob3 and tru3.
---
I don't think it's really noticable, like they don't even realize it's unfair, it's just a little urking sensation in their minds, again I have no clue
---
Ever since I put my sensitivity to 100 on killer, 360s have become a thing of the past for me lol
---
&gt; Tru3 is really strange. He never uses any of the "strong" perks or items because he says he want to challenge himself. Which is fine, it's just that he actually complains about it. Like you'll see him get annoyed/mad that he's handicapped when he handicaps himself
---
Dont forget that he actually spent quite a while seal clubbing around rank 10. Where is the challenge in that for a guy with 5000 hours? With 3 teachables unlocked and less than 40 hours i too get to rank 10.
---
Unfortunately this doesn't seem like a solvable problem. They're never going to remove the ability for survivors to play with their friends. Maybe there could be a ranked solo queue that's separate from the casual queue where you can SWF, but that doesn't seem likely to work well either.
---
They could rebalance the game around the assumption that the survivors can voice chat, which probably should just include giving the survivors in-game voice chat... But that would definitely up the toxicity and remove what's little left of the immersion for solo survivors.
---
The best thing to do might be to give a sight buff to the killer/nerf to the survivors at the start of the game based on how many of them are grouped up, but that has issues, too.
---
I think it‚Äôs part of the mind game potential with spirit and is intentional
---
Even if that was to happen, you'd just hit them and you lose collision towards each other.
---
Iwan we have to see how DBD on mobile performs first... If it runs like shit identity v will be fine
---
You are cringe
---
Who the fuck is Pinhead?
---
They redid his blade wipe?

I miss the "lobby with friends" where you never left the lobby when trying to play with friends.

i was literally saying how i was gonna make a pic like this earlier. thus makes me so sad tbh i miss it
---
I will never feel bad for killers so long as ebonies exist, those are literally the video game version of Xanax and if you tell me I‚Äôm lying you‚Äôve never done Xanax because popping a ebony before bed after a stressful day is gold.
---
Having back to back bad killer matches? Pop that ebony on baby and it feels like you‚Äôre Link ball busting into a pot galore room with chickens running around screaming :,) 
---
HYAHHHHHH
---
Definitely a ranged hook attack, plus maybe something to do with the lament configuration, maybe it slows down the game somehow
---
They're not gonna let Bill leave PC
---
thought about it but the meg DC'd straight after this and nea killed herself on hook, had 4 games in a row with at least 1 DC so i farmed those games, wanted an actual game for once.
---
That's why I said probably not.
---
That mobile clip they showed on scream seemed pretty smooth. Even though they can still mess up, I think devs aren't this dumb to release the game without enough testing.
---
XD
---
5 Blink Nurse is literally worse than 1 Blink Nurse dude
---
He has to have the hooks pulling the body apart Mori. That‚Äôs all I care about him and that mori.
---
‚ÄúYour suffering will be legendary even in hell!‚Äù
---
No one would, that's why it's a good answer.
---
what I mean by tunneling in this scenario is specifically targeting the wounded and previously hooked for the quick mori, even when it would make just as much or even greater tactical sense to switch to another target.
---
My guess would be then you would just be stuck in a dying survivor.
---
Or the game would freak and launch the survivor at Mach speed because of how clipping seems to affect most games physics.
---
Time to put that ebony mori on
---
May I ask what kind of software is this?  Amazing drawing btw!
---
Come to think of it, could the entity even trap him?

---
david: excuse me but i weigh twice as much as she does so how the bloody hell does your logic work!?!
---
Killers literally can't get stuck inside of survivors, and when they are hit, the survivor loses collision with the killer.
---
But the problem is that NOED gives such huge benefits with no drawbacks or earning of the benefits.
---
Just got a siege platinum so I‚Äôve seen this message a lot this week. Never even thought of making that joke lol
---
Not worth throwing away other matches for the 5% you‚Äôll play a Freddy.
---
I started binging his videos about Saw, Nightmare on Elm Street, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, for context of their killers. But now I'm just watching video after video. Good stuff!
---
Let them win.
---
Because my randoms are all immersed and drop pallets with the killer 10 meters away and just run in a straight line until downed. The game is good if all the survivors are good, otherwise you're going to get rekt. Also enables three gen doc and nurse has an easier time on it.
---
So when it's good it's survivor sided, but most of my experience on it is bad.
---
It's supposed to be virtually the only counter survivors have.  Sure it sucks as the Myers, but survivors need something they can do to have a chance to survive the instant mori from full health without a single hook dependency.  Before you can make it even more ridiculously consistent a mori effect, you gotta give it the same treatment other such moris have of needing to have at least hooked the target once.
---
50/50 guess isn't a mind game. You have no idea if she's vaulting or using her power.
---
Exactly. And considering the *only way* you can get 5 blinks is by combining Father Campbell's last breath with Fragile wheeze or Dark Cincture (however Fragile Wheeze is better bc it has no downside), ur 5 blinks come with a hefty price tag. 
---
Those 5 blinks all have noticably shorter reach, which will mean that in situations where you could have caught a Survivior with 1 or 2 blinks, you'll need to use 3 or 4, which enhances ur fatigue time if you miss, and even if you hit, it makes it easier for the Survivior to get away since ur fatigue doesn't decrease or cancel on a successful hit. 
---
5 blink Nurse is meme tier levels of bad. Now Omega Blink Nurse is a different story. You wanna talk about OP? Being able to effectively cross the entire map in 2 blinks takes the cake.
---
It‚Äôs a very common issue, Bhvr is looking into it.
---
That‚Äôs the point it‚Äôs about the mind games
---
Considering the toxic level of some people. Insulting you because your not on a high level survivor and haven't been playing for years I would just like to say thanks to one group of people that were kind in the face of my sucking. Thank you for being decent and while winning handily gripe about ranking and matchmaking.
---
People get abused for trying something new and then people wonder why a killer might facecamp the first person they can and call it a win. How do 3 people degrade a level 2? I can't get the logic. Do they want to drive people away? You can tell them that behavior won't keep people playing and all but that don't unpiss you off.
---
I've had people today start insulting before the match so I stayed in his way all I could. What's wrong with these people.
---
I can't understand people who get an easy match and decent BP being mean about it. They should be happy to have an easy match. Mad because it wasn't fun? Well guess what it wasn't fun for me either. 
---
They may claim dedicated servers will let them do something about some of the crap but I'm not buying it from people that put in a reporting system that they've admitted is just to make you feel better. 
---

Learn to run tiles. Scott has a vid channel is damnnohtml on yt.

I've played since beta and yeah this game has come a long way, so it's pretty funny to me when people complain about the Devs not fixing anything. When someone complains about 0 balancing it just makes me think they're new. I'm especially liking how they're being more transparent now and listening to the community more.
---
People actually do that? 
---
Shit I just do the gen.
---
Only thing is Pinhead isn't a Slasher. Horror yes but not a Slasher type.
---
Dont forget the time they added balanced and you could use both.
---
do all of them at rank reset,
---
yeah survivor is cake, do these at rank reset its a lot easier.

I would like more crouch focused add ons. And honestly...I kinda feel like the aura reading on Amandas letter should be part of her kit. But down to 8 instead of 12 meters.
---
I‚Äôve never rage quit, but nurse mains terrify me lmao. Y‚Äôall are really good at her.
---
It's allowed, and while annoying and shitty for the survivor, it's not holding the game hostage or game abuse in any way.
---
I mean, close enough? The hag doesn‚Äôt seem very slasher type.

Neither really is the Saw Franchise.  He's still one of the most iconic and scary humanoid villains in a horror franchise.
---
Lemme guess. You hated old Decisive?

You seem chill

True‚Äãbut the concept of a revenge type is Slasher. If we want a demon we need Angela from Night of the Demons.
---
That's....a terrible idea.
---
Ps4 struggles :-:
---
But it isn't a horror movie. It's a game that should be balanced, and NOED isn't.
---
Never heard of her.
---
this happens from time to time, just get back into a new lobby and run it. Can be the host crashing, someone else crashing, you crashing (not responding in TM) etc. It's part of the games charm lol... Hopefully dedicated servers fix this, or add rejoin.
---
This would be a bad idea because then the people who want to play killer will just keep queueing up until they get killer and visa versa if someone happens to get killer and wants to play survivor
---
Stops killers from taking the game hostage to troll the Survivior, and prevents slug fests. 
---
I see no issue. You want the points, feed them to the Entity
---
This is a way more consistent technique than spending five minutes trying, and failing, to cleanse all the totems.
---
And, once you know the locations of several totems, you can take a moment to cleanse the ones in inconvenient locations. Ones both very far and very close to the gates, as well as directly inbetween the gates.
---
Minutes you mean seconds ?
---
Its an explosion noise

well some Freddy mains are concerned because we put in a lot of time into turning his weaknesses into map pressure and didn't call ourselves Freddy mains because we just played Fred sometimes and would get kills by tunneling. =\
---
the rework isn't fully confirmed too, nothing is solid and no one knows which changes are gonna stay.
---
with that, fuck that smug faced guy who works on rework and not queen too because of how they both said "map pressure". Fred has map pressure. what he doesn't have is help in chase. if they don't realize that, i don't know how they can be judging or reworking anything.
---
Thanks for replying its probably our router then i suppose.

I used to so I could pip down. I'm sure some do it because they are tilted.

I didn't count, but I only bought 1 killer in this time, and somewhere around 8k worth of cosmetics(just for Meg). This however takes into account the shards I started with(when they changed the shard system), and I don't think I bought more than MAYBE 1 perk on the shrine. So I can't say how much i've gotten, but I certainly don't think it's reasonable for someone to have to grind for an entire devotion for one cosmetic set, since that would take like 600+ games.
---
They aren't notified if a dull is touched, only Hex totems.
---
Today I learned
---
I mean you have to take into account that if a survivor sees ghostface, he gets his red stain and terror radius while in crouch so
---
DbD balance is a screwy game of Whack a Mole
---
I sat through a year's worth of Crystal Lake fuckery. The people who bitch about BHVR being trash don't know what shit devs are.
---
They don't always get it right (lol spirit sounds after *^every* patch), but they're always trying their best, and that's all I could ask for.
---
I guess they want to make sure even no lifers who play the game like 6 hours a day or more can't even get all the cosmetics, so even they(the most dedicated players) will be more likely to spend money? Probably someone in a marketing department somewhere said that it would make them more money.
---
Don't know yet, this is a very unfinished build of mobile. I suspect this will be the new progression system and you will actually level each character with your playtime with them instead of bloodpoints (getting exp each game for characters individually)
---
Can‚Äôt not spend blood points. Can not spend blood points. Can not spend blood points. Can‚Äôt not spend blood points!!
---
I wouldn't say it's unfair. It is a lot more challenging. I do hate when a get a 4 stack of swf and they all have flashlight. I know I'm gonna have a bad time.
---
I mean that add on is one of the dumbest in the entire game. I can play the game perfectly and just get killed without even being hooked or hit once. Damn straight I‚Äôm going to hide in a locker if I know he has it. Why would I just wait for my imminent death? Hiding in a locker gives me a chance.
---
You're back! thanks for this!
---
You got a good giggle. Up front good sir.
---
WHERES PANDA? You can just see his soul die but he tries to stay positive
---
I wouldn't miss either personally.  I play both sides and both items are quite cheap for both sides.  I try to avoid using them personally.  I think it would be a fair trade but baby players on both aisles that use either regularly would complain enough to where it probably wouldn't be feasible.
---
True, but I only bought this game because my friends like it so much so...
---
Yeah, fuck that guy.  /s
---
In the mobile leak there was a thing called "Bloodmarket" it's basically what you're wanting, an add-on shop.
---

---
As a Megan main myself. Very fine job sir.
---
i never trust collision. it doesn't help these days, way too many times i'd bump into something but it's some gosh darn invisible hitbox of a stick in a wall  =\ however before Legion chapter, oh yeah... Spirit had all advantage. perfect sounds, smooth walls and obstacles. no weird bumping into shit, no confusion in chase. right now I'd say most of the time it's a guessing game for Spirit. survivors can just run cause stupid scratch marks don't show up a second after you ran anyway so just stay for a second near pallet and then run again. the Spirit will lunge. that's how stupidly confusing game is right now.

A slasher is characteristically a horror film where a single powerful slasher or monster goes around murdering victims by hand.  Saw is more of a movie franchise about John Kramer's attempt to "redeem" people by "testing" them with his traps.  Amanda is certainly a murderer, but she killed with unfair traps and she certainly did not do it for fun.  She did it because of a warped world view she had based off of John's.  There is not a Saw movie where she goes around killing a bunch of teenagers by hand in Slasher fashion; and there isn't even a Saw movie where her murders are the main focus.  Saw is as you stated Gorn; and it's mainly all about the traps themselves.
---
Have a friend who gets pissed when gens aren't popping every 30 seconds he's getting chased
---
That's what borrowed time is for. Two infinite-duration-inside-terror-radius perks would be ridiculous on top of Mettle of Man and Adrenaline.
---
They could make swf unranked, just like kyf. Proximity chat could bee done too.
---
do i know you? cause if i don't you some psychic abilities there bud
---
I mean can you gen rush in 5 seconds
---
There is no way they get me to play DBD mobile unless they implement some sort of cross save.  It's too much progress to try and redo on yet another platform.
---
Mettle of man is being nerfed to death soon. I‚Äôm a killer main lol and it‚Äôs too easy to just counter the perk by counting.
---
same i find it's just too loud for me to handle and i'm more of the type of how one would put it "a lone wolf"
---
Proximity chat wouldn't get used, people would just use external chat instead.
---
I hate that that's how it works, since there are lots of cool things that could be done in online multiplayer gaming that mess around with voice comms, but unfortunately if the players are able to party up together ahead of time, they can and will already have their own voice channel.
---
In fact, we actually see the Nurse levitating things, so there's no reason other killers couldn't as well if absolutely necessary.
---
It‚Äôs allowed, but it‚Äôs a waste of time for both sides.
---
I actually think it‚Äôs fine now, though I think it would be even better if it only went off if unhooked inside a certain distance from killer, like MYC.
---
Tuesday.  June 4th.  Midday.
---
on rank 4? no Enduring? no Bamboozle?
---
oh, man, you're about to have a bad time if you face somewhat good survivors and not use like fast dream transition or Class Photo.
---
Is it because the killer is tunneling?
---
Haha thanks dog
---
Yup and you made no points while they all teabagged at the exit gates! Am I right?
---
Lmao let him, the cops won‚Äôt give af even if you did. They‚Äôll just tell him ‚Äúthey‚Äôll look into it‚Äù

---
In what way?
---
I'm going to revel in all these people getting punishes once dedicated servers come online.  DC'ing is a shitty thing to do, unless it's an actual real life emergency, and I can't wait for them to start *actually* punishing people for it.
---
Objectively speaking, it‚Äôs crazy how many unspken rules ppl come up with, and how much it varies. I‚Äôm definitely guilty of this as well, (like 2 or more flashlights means I‚Äôm bringing franklins). 
---
I‚Äôve also been told that running 2 gen perks (ruin and discordance) on the spirit in red ranks is against these unspoken rules lol
---
Balanced Landing is superior to SB because you deliberately activate it. Lithe since it‚Äôs buff is also good, especially when you combine it with Quick and Quiet.
---
Its not even a chance. Its just annoying. If i cant mori them im hooking that son of a bitch and killing anyone who comes close.
---
Yeah, it's unfortunate. That's why making swf unranked is the best move.
---
Pig gets an oink emote.
---
tbh my only real problem is the possiblity of him supsending my account
---
Ebony is nothing compared to four Balanced Landing Haddonfield Mettle of Man Adrenaline Decisive Strike Self-Care users being guided around by a Laurie who dropped Self-Care for Object of Obsession and a Jake who 99s hooks near both gates just so they can troll you for three solid minutes once gates are 99d.
---
Even just a fraction of that is bad with how fast generators go by, and it doesn't have to be an SWF, there are so many survivors who use their builds to be toxic and run rare/ultra-rare items with addons and a billion second chance perks that you can end up with four randoms all with the same basic idea, when even one is enough to suffer.
---
Ebonies are perfectly fine until they gut survivor "kits".
---
Damn I learned something new today lol
---
The sad thing is if he had just stood in front of the gate he could've downed you easily. As much as I hate no-skill ResidentSleeper plays like this I always groan when Killers somehow manage to fuck up moves a toddler could do correctly.
---
Well of course you can read minds across internet connections, so you knew exactly which one was which.  I mean..... this is basic toxic logic here.
---
Mine too!!
---
Especially when it‚Äôs a spirit I feel like even more of a dumbass, but if we never cleanse it, it might be devour so I risk it anyways lol
---
Michael deserves his trademark head tilt especially
---
Personally, my problem with adding Chucky is that all the killers carry the survivors on the shoulder. Not to mention DS's description has you stab the killer's back with an object. So unless Chucky himself is levitating and carrying the survivors on his small doll shoulders I'm not entirely sure how BHVR is gonna handle that.
---
So instead of going AFK to stand in one position and bodyblock, I should sit at my keyboard but not move or otherwise provide input to the game, because then at least I'm not AFK?
---
with a dislocated arm and everything
---
I doubt that‚Äôll happen, you‚Äôre good man.
---
I believe they could figure it out.  They've surprised me enough times now that I'm happy to say lack of creativity is not one of their current faults when it comes to killer design.  .... Bad balance maybe though.
---
yeah in all he kinda was hypocritcal considering his despcription actually said "send me dbd hate mail, I dare you..."
---
Why is bodyblocking an objective too far? There's so many counters to traps in their current state before even considering the bugs, guarding the box is pretty fair.
---
Keys can spawn in chests even without Plunderers and you can bring them in, they prepared to abuse window and balcony spawns before the match and got screwed over by puzzle spawns. If they've staggered their generator completions so not all four traps activate at once, one might even get hatch without a key.
---
If all four got trapped without even popping a single generator and within any of the four reaching that one box, there's bigger problems with their group.
---
There is even a perk made to find totems. I sometimes just run that perk and spend my time getting totems.
---
Dwight's Ascension- The auras of lockers are highlighted when within 36/38/40 meters, and fast entries and exits to lockers give off no noise notification.

why is this so funny XD

You‚Äôre saying that because we don‚Äôt want to mash a button for five minutes 
---
We want the game to play itself?
---
I‚Äôve played since release, fun game, but u should try a friends account before you buy. The imbalance has pretty much at this point killed the game for me.
---
Why do some posts (like this one) completely fail to load and leave me looking at the Reddit icon
---
Then what do i do if all survivors are near the hook and not do gens? Let them get free unhooks on a silver platter?
---
yeah but doesn't really help when the 3 randos on your team are a bunch of chicken shits
---
Yeah, I'd say that's pretty accurate.
---
OKAY NO THATS DIFFERENT
---
Honestly, I did not have the patience to go through the thousands of sound files. I instead ripped the sounds off a site that was used to practice skill checks.
---
[http://www.mistersyms.com/tools/gitgud/](http://www.mistersyms.com/tools/gitgud/) 
---
&gt;!The sounds used were probably recreated or recorded from in-game. I heard many people were unsuccessful in trying to get the actual skill check sounds from the game's files. The one who created the website said it himself too, I believe.!&lt;
---
he has a couple of good perks, get him if you want to play him.
---
He used to use the trappers bladewipe, essentially rubbing the skull on his left arm. They changed it to the thumb blade flick thing probabbllllyyy like early 2017 or something, I can't recall. But basically he just used to use someone elses animation. Kind of like how a lot of killers shared the same Idle animation in lobby. 
---
Look left, look right, look forward, repeat.
---
always happens
---
what would you rate him? 1/10 i care more about perks
---
Third seal + monitor and abuse + sloppy butcher + thantiphobia. This build is seriously painful to fight.

Can't wait for a decent competitive game to DBD, with devs actually caring about its community.

Doesn't mean SWF isn't a problem.

No, M&amp;A IS AWFUL, I couldn‚Äôt give less shits about punishment TR, it hurts his passive madness too much to be useful

LMFAO that was me xD

Could‚Äôve also thought this due to killers internet.

The thought of spirits being able to stack up on prayer beads makes this a hard pass from me.

---
Can't see shit other than a blinding sense of regret and white
---
I feel like DS is fine where it is rn. 
---
Soon they'll be changing Enduring to only affect pallet stuns, so even if the killer has Enduring you'll get more bang out of your buck with DS.
---

"No one cares about Ghost Face"

99% of the community: Am I a joke to you?

If killers stop disconnecting when the map RNG picks haddonfield then I'll stop disconnecting when a ruin mori nurse shows up.
---
You spelled noise wrong:)
---
Yes, you level Hag to level 35 and unlock the teachable in her bloodweb for Hex: Ruin, 
---
This will then give a chance for Ruin to spawn in your pig‚Äôs bloodwebs, so you may have to grind a bunch of webs for it but it will show up eventually. üòä

That‚Äôs actually a great way to get rid of hook suiciders!

Ok. Thank you.

Wow this is really cool! So much contrast going on I love the focus points of the DBD community art. I just wish the Dev's made the ashy slashy puppet with the white shark teeth like they had in the series, real shame ash doesn't do anything with his puppet, or shotgun, or chainsaw, or metal hand... But hey mettle of man he's got that going for him, which is nice, I guess.
---
He's the new survivor
---
Just to further elaborate, when you hit level 35 on the Hag you have to buy the orange spawn of Ruin for it to start appearing for other killers, it doesn‚Äôt automatically unlock once you hit level 35.
---
The wiggle and x button mashing breaks $60 controllers on PS4 it‚Äôs a bad design that needs to be reworked, keep it like the gens, hold a button and throw a skill check in.
---
The problem isn't that it's op so much that it's annoying as hell. Like, Balanced Landing is strong, but nobody's calling for it to be changed. MoM's design is just godawful.
---
Ok. I understood in your first post but thank you for elaborating.üòä
---
When a survivor is inside the TR, they \*can\* hear the whoosh, my dude.
---
Ok. I understood from your first response but thank you for elaborating.üòä

Identity v wasn't a balant copy of dbd at all. Not to mention the devs of dbd are awate of the game. If you've ever played it you would know that there not that similar.
---
The idea of it though is just bad since If the killer chases you, you‚Äôre in a position to let him catch you. Which is just bad design. At least cause it to have an added timer maybe up to 3 minutes when I‚Äôm a chase. Like it stays paused for 120 seconds when In a chase while active.

---
I gave up on the ranking system awhile ago! They can‚Äôt fix it for shit and anytime they change or tweak something it makes it worse or bugged out horribly! Last week I kept getting paired with rank 1-4 killers and I was at rank 11
---
No worries, happy grinding!
---
Idk for sure man, ask the devs. It's something that I feel they would consider an exploit, but I'm not one of them so I can't say for sure. Traditionally, while bodyblocking in general (for extended periods) is frowned upon, specifically bodyblocking an interaction zone is kind of exploiting the technical details of the mechanics through which the players interact with the world.
---
I agree, there was a lot of counterplay and RNG to avoid the possibility of being blocked off the box, but that argument wouldn't hold up with basement stair blocking (not the hostage kind, the one where you hook someone and then prevent entry for a rescue) and I don't think it does here, either.
---
Once again, though, this is all just my opinion. I'm not definitively saying it *is* too far, I'm just saying *I* feel like it's too far, personally.
---
I don't really think it's a problem in this situation anyway.
---
They can still 99 all seven generators, pop 5, open both gates, find hatch. Sure 3 of them are gonna die when they try and leave, but one will live.
---
The whole point of NOED existing is to create a secondary objective for survivors. Either bash out the gens asap and risk a NOED killer or take time to cleanse the totems. I‚Äôd would say having a totem counter for Small Game would be a good compromise for the complainers. That or having the Hex icon pop when all gens are done, not when the killer whacks someone like it currently works.
---
It's on Xbox GamePass, so you really only need ten bucks to play or zero bucks if you can use the trial.
---
‚ÄúThe strong perks‚Äù didn‚Äôt get nerfed, the ridiculously overpowered ones did. The strong perks are still there. Or are we gonna sit here and pretend like survivors don‚Äôt have strong perks?
---
To be fair though there was people stating survivors denying a killer an achievement is cuntish (such as jumping in lockers to avoid tombstones) that is some entitled bs right there aswell.
---
Right!!? That made me uncomfortable
---
Exactly. The survivor wasn‚Äôt in the wrong. Clearly you have some explaining to do
---
It's not hook camping if I haven't even turned around before you're looking your buddy.
---
But he got dead heart
---
This actually looks super good, Susie ftw!
---
Weird, I could swear it used to work that way. I will still do it with a Hex too though.
---
Oh those seem fun too! Thanks for the ideas. ‚ô°
---
Those are Ghostface's sounds when he stalks?
---
Thank youuu!!!
---
That's a campin......
---
Big facts.
---
He had like 10 chances to hit if he lunged earlier or didn't turn arouns
---
That's what I was thinking!
---
I'm personally just been using more meta-ish Discordance, Save the best for last, Enduring, and Spirit Fury. You get to play so aggressively which is pretty fun and can pressure people into naturally making more mistakes.
---
Megan Main? Survivors are all the same lol
---
Lol, dude you nearly had me crying
---
Jk I'm just trash
---
Speaking as a Legion main, can confirm. That map is a piece of shit. Not my least favorite, but it‚Äôs super easy to miss your Frenzy hits on it
---
It is also the map with most pallets, and has always like 3 or 4 god pallets
---
I thought it was established that the Entity granted supernatural strength to killers by the developers
---
\&gt;Wait an hour for Survivors at peak times
---
\&gt;Is an SWF
---
\&gt;Immediately leave to start waiting another hour
---
It doesn‚Äôt look like she‚Äôs wearing any ummm...you know
---
Nah i dont stop because this game is 90% broken.
---
Selfcare shouldnt take priority in this case.
---
Well I mean, I wasn't gonna draw underwear because shes wearing leggings, soooo....
---
You‚Äôre probably some nobody who got the game through the most recent free weekend. Relax. 
---
Self care should take priority.
---
You can also just down them, stand over them for 60 seconds then pick them up. But that‚Äôs toxic af.
---
And that wastes time. Not really a great solution. I usually down them and move to someone else.
---
They tried twice. Survivors abused the hell out of it. Now it's gone forever. 
---
"Reap what you sow"
---
this isn't a complaint, and I'm new to the game, but Ruin being almost a necessity seems like the survivors have an innate advantage that must be overcome by something that should be optional. do you think that is a design flaw if many killers must stall just to stand a chance?
---
NOED,Bloodwarden and other endgame perks, Freddy is pretty bad but in endgame he is good. My build is BBQ brutal strength and corrupt intervention. BBQ for blood points and locating, Corrupt intervention to get people into the dream world early and slow the game and brutal strength because fuck pallets, shadowborn is just because I love big FOVs  but if you aren't like me then I would do STBFL because it's just great as a perk.
---
Honestly I wish moris were expanded upon with ebony mories having a higher possibility of showing off rare mori animations
---
I didn‚Äôt say it was a GOOD option. Best option is not tunneling in the first place. No point in it imo.
---
Hiding in a locker just delays the inevitable
---
Nah i have it since it was free on ps4
---
No why should selfcare take priority when i have someone unhookable or the gate next to me?
---
And? That doesn't disprove what I said.
---
Ah pizdec I get it good design choice the
---
The problem with being able to communicate across the entire map with absolutely no drawbacks for up to the entire survivor team (not to mention that the killer is not buffed or compensated for this in any way), in a game that was designed for all of the survivors to be solo and unable to directly communicate with each other, is broken as shit. And it's obvious why.
---
Why are you standing still after you get hit?
---
they really are*  
---
if i camp i'm an asshole
---
if i don't kill you i suck  
---
if i DO kill you i'm tunneling  
---
if i let you go i'm a pussy who's too afraid to try  
---
if i kill the squad in under 10 minutes i'm smurfing 
---
if i don't kill a single person i need to "git gud" and watch them smack their asses on the ground at the exit gate cuz these idiots can't just leave the fucking game without proving they can teabag first
---
you just can't fucking win with Survivors like that  
---
  
---
*not saying all Survivors, just the majority that i deal with as a Killer main
---
You might like this: https://youtu.be/D_vPchWT_sU
---
Prwtty good job so far...
---
Teabag? You mean butt dancing?
---
Have it be Tiffany+ Chucky. She does the walking and carrying, he does the slashing, is involved in the power, and the Mori. I would personally think his chat could in some way be incorporated into either his power or Mori too.
---
For those who don't know Tiffany is his girlfriend, who was human, became a doll, then went back to becoming human again who 'mostly' stood loyal to Chucky/Charles throughout the movies they were in together.
---
It will add a whole new level of uniqueness to the killer to have a sort of "pair" of them at the same time fulfilling different aspects of the killer role.
---
This post is not correct. I was the first to respond to that comment and the context of the responses don't match the timestamps. It sucks that they were downvoted like that but the information presented is not accurate. My post is not more recent.
---
Never skip oink day
---
What do you think of bbq, NOED, bloodwarden, and STBFL? Im a new killer so i dont have many perks, the only ones i have are for hag, cannibal, and myer.
---
u/Nitro03
---
Ahh shit, here we go again
---
There arent any other perks im interest to use. Deliverance, spine chill, dead hard are all that i need. The 4th perk idc about so i rather have the ability to not go find chests every game.

No, I was agreeing with you with your internet explanation. That‚Äôs why I said he had explaining to do lol

Win 3 chases? All they have to do is get hit 3 times...that's not winning anything.

No he‚Äôs not!
---
Just because you're talking to your friends about other stuff does not mean that's the only stuff you're talking about, at least when playing this game. That has absolutely zero to do with Dead by Daylight. Any exchange of information directly from anyone's mouth to anyone else is more information than you or your team were meant to have at any given time, if not found through in-game means. 
---
That part might be good, with some revisions.

It varies, probably due to how many of each are online. Sometimes my solo queues are minutes long, sometimes just seconds.
---
&gt;They adjusted for the fact that in plague games the plague will typically one shot down people since they're already sick, I can't wrap my head around why they can't reward hillbilly players for playing the killer as he's meant to be played.
---
The only adjustment made here is having the puke count as a regular M1. You still get only 1 hit worth of points. Before it was bugged and you got nothing for hitting survivors with Corrupted Purge. 
---
The fix needed for Billy is having 1-shot hits counting as two and this obviously can lead to a lot of bugs regarding other killers if they tweak the emblem itself.
---
Looks like a tricky situation to fix. 
---
Myers also gets punished for downing people during EW3 and so does Leatherface.
---
I feel like getting carried by Chucky should end with you punting his tiny ass across the map and running away.
---
Your in the right the other survivors were being babies about dying
---
So you just check everyone's friends list?
---
Confirming this is because of the flashlight. Legion currently does not suffer frenzy recovery if blinded. Probably a bug.
---
Pig is F tier now
---
Surveillance is such an underrated perk tbh. No one ever seems to run it in the matches I play
---
Theres only so much you can do if the killer is facecamping someone, especially if they had noed. Your best bet wouldve been to look for the hex totem and take it out if you didn't already do that, in hopes for the killer's attention would be drawn to that. Then go over and make the save.
---
Nice
---
They probably noticed you didn‚Äôt have 4 perks equipped on whatever killer you were playing. I tell people all the time to prioritize getting one killer to at least 15 to get all your perk slots ASAP
---
I was awake at 2am, it's not really wasted time when I should be asleep anyway. Sincerely hope you're having a nice day.
---
I killed someone with devour hope and they said ez report, and I said something like "what did I do" and they replied "you know what you did" it was great
---
That was switch not mobile.
---
Damn I got a couple of these too lmao
---
Depending on the map, the totems are a bit easier/harder to find. Some people just dont understand if the killer is camping you on the hook, its not a good idea for a teammate to try and save. I play witha couple buddies and thats happens to us on more than one occasion. I had a mikey hook me in the basement (1st hook) and wouldnt leave until i died. I told them to just do gens, cuz with him camping me that bought them time. If that keeps happening to you and they wont leave them, even when trying to make distraction doesnt work, just work on gens and try to escape. They get mad oh well haha
---
Yes everyone check it out Panda was super helpful for me in the beginning and his accent is choice
---
Booped tf outta the snoot. Big *OINKS*
---
VAC
---
Well I know how the survivors act since I don't have my profile on private xD always funny to get those comments
---
Yeah, but barely.
---
flip flop isnt the best but it can be useful, buckle up on the other hand is terrible
---
Well I know and that's a good chunk of my issue. With Myers its not that prevalent since he's not in tier 3 for a good chunk of the game and with leatherface he's not played as much. With hillbilly though your chainsaw is basically your bread and butter though and it hurts your pip
---
I disagree and it's a conversation I've had with other hillbilly mains with like thousands of hours who have basically said similar things. Your chaser is basically shit because you're whole job is to close out chases quickly which means chainsawing them since you dont want to play around pallets or windows.
---
I recommend watching no0b3 and monto. They‚Äôre both youtubers who recommend and teach really great ways to play the game. They‚Äôre also really fun to watch!
---
Bullshit, she strong girl.
---
I've been playing this game on and off for about 2 months now. After a few weeks break, I picked it up again this weekend, and I finally -suddenly - managed to understand how to move the camera which allowed me to consistently last in a chase for about 1 minute. Before I stopped playing, I'd go down within 20 seconds.  
---
Yes, this is basic for a lot players, but as a baby survivor that had been struggling with the controls, this was a huge achievement for me!
---
I also kept 180 the killer when they got close enough, it only worked twice but that was because I kept getting the timings wrong. I'm still really happy with my improvement, which was more of a "click" really.
---
I get a mix of swagger and Daniel from Second Life vibe and I quite like it.
---
Oh, look, a negative Nancy.
---
I am not going to be posting consecutively like I used to do, I've just been feeling the meme a bit lately.
---
WAZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
That is 100% not the reason behind NOED. Where does it say in the game that it is the secondary objective? We had an entire event dedicated to testing out a secondary objective and it went horribly.
---
I love that this picture was made into a template
---
His favorite position before David tops him.

This is really low quality bait. You didn't get the sequel names right. You said it was from the 80s it was made in 1996. Like if you're going to troll at least make an effort
---

the pack has been updated to include offerings: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1757661195
---
I play Ruin + Haunted Grounds + Thrill of the hunt on Wraith Nurse Spirit it's super effective :)
---
Survivor reveal their location to warn you they are about to get exposed :D
---
Don't listen to salty players, that's what. They will blame every mistake on someone else. I took a break from the game for a few months and forgot how toxic some of the people are.
---
Why would anyone think injuring hooking people would be bannable :D You might get reported for camping but no one would report for camping  after the gates are open and if they were toxic then please go ahead and camp. I judt hate it when killers camp at 5 gens, it is a dick way of playing the game but It's still not bannable.
---
what if we kissed üò≥ in the entity realm  üò≥   üò≥
---
This man respects the fuck outta pallets
---
1. Yeah it's still fairly active
---
2. Chapters are just a dlc pack of a survivor and/or a killer you can play
---
Okay tysm man!!!! Is ghost face cool?
---
I'd DC, too. No fun allowed build right there!
---
1. The game just celebrated its 3-year anniversary where it announced a lot of new content that‚Äôs coming in the next year. It also recently hit its peak on steam about a week ago so it‚Äôs still very active.
---
2. A chapter consists of DLC of a killer, a survivor, and a map though the map is available to everyone for free. Killers like Leatherface and Ghost Face and the survivor Ash are solo characters but every other chapter contains both a killer and survivor.
---
Not out yet but he seems to be yeah
---
had a match where all 4 (randos) spawned together right beside a lit totem, we surrounded the laurie to protect her during cleansing. The instant it popped as haunted ground the nurse was right over to eat our asses
---
So if I buy Ghost face, does it include its own map? And if so, will others be able to experience the map?
---
Take all the upvotes
---
not fair one for sure she has so much mind games ability and strong ability
---
Ohhh so if I buy a character and he has a dlc map or something and I chose that character if I'm picked killer, example if I pick the clown or something, will his map play?
---
You're a hero.
---
Nah, Amanda just supa stronk
---
I've seen my fair share of toxic killers. Don't just assume everyone plays one or the other exclusively btw.
---
What exactly is "BHVR official" here?
---
Every day her muskles grow stronker
---
Should i think about noed?
---
I'm fairly certain this pic shows rank 20 on devotion 2 and level 6 character.
---
What the Fuck
---
It's rather difficult to add something extra in a game like DBD though. And five bucks really isn't much. If you don't want to buy something for that much, just don't. :-)
---
1. Yes, very active.
---
2. The chapters are DLC. That the devs release every 3 months. Each Chapter has a killer a new one to learn and master.
---
Thank you!
---
Wait what. I am confused.
---
Are you reporting people for camping? You talked about a subject and then moved to reporting system.
---
That‚Äôs a shame in that case
---
No
---
Listen as big a defender i am of noed. I feel it should only be used for situations that need it (4 MAN squadette, sabo squad or 4 people pop up with flashlights.) I say learn to play without it and then add it if needed.
---
Yes, but it is "only" one gen. In comparisson to the old BNP, where 4 people would finish 4 gens in 10 seconds.
---
I‚Äôll check their channel out, thanks.
---
Lol
---
Thank you for advices!
---
When I play Killer if I ever tunnel it's because you were who I saw. I never camp, boring af.
---
What's reporting have to do with any I this, though? Neither of those are reportable.
---
Well i EXCLUSIVELY played survivor for 240 hours and switched to killer a week ago. In those 240 hours the toxicity i experienced was mild but it didnt affect gameplay that much.  but when i switched to killer the toxicity was so unbearable. 
---
Btw im not talking about face camping and tbagging toxicity, im talking about the toxic chat after the round.
---
Thank you.
---
I don‚Äôt know i really like these bugs / lightings. So nostalgic
---
Yeah lower prices would be nice, but if I really want a special outfit once every few months, I'll happily spend 10$. It's also an investment into further gameplay updates IMHO.
---
Bloodhound is honesty much better. Blood is more reliable to track and unless you use Father's Glasses, you won't lose survivors with Iron Will as once you come out of phase, you'll see a bright trail leading to their location.
---
If I knew this was you I would have linked you myself. I am grateful for you giving me the option to make oinkgirl memes.
---
Ah, I don't get that on Xbox, might be worse on PC. I mostly play killer and I get nothing from the survivors.
---
1. The game is pretty active.
---
2. Chapters are DLC that come with a new map, killer, and survivor. You do not need to own the DLC to play on the respective map. And killers and survivors can be bought individually but are cheaper when bought together.
---
Paragraphs are stand alone DLC consisting of only a survivor or killer. Bill is only on PC, Leatherface has his own paragraph, Ash has his own paragraph, and I believe Ghostface is going to be a paragraph.
---
~~Killer picks up downed survivor~~ Chucky grabs them by their hair and/or neck, and starts dragging them
---
~~Killer thunderdunks survivor on hook~~ Hooks are changed to nooses (but are functionally identical). Chucky quickly wraps the noose around the survivor‚Äôs neck, and pulls them up to hang
---
~~Decisive strike: Survivor stabs killer in back~~ Decisive strike: Survivor bites Chucky‚Äôs hand/arm/ankle, then runs away as Chucky clutches himself (this would also work for filling the wiggle meter)
---
&gt; If you don't want to buy something for that much, just don't. :-)
---
I don't. No one's worrying.
---
I mean, I could have stayed at the box and downed anyone that went for it. Outcome would not change much, now I got a drink.
---
Anyone who starts with "Dono why your upset" is usually a crybaby cunt.
---
I love you too buddy, oink.
---
Every game as a killer ends in an argument with either one or all the survivors. If you breath as a killer than you're considered a face camper. You hook someone then go to the other side of the map they'll say you "passive camped me". You use NOED they'll say youre a "trash baby killer".
---
I played the shit out of I.V., but only because it's a 100% win rate once you know all of the techniques.  There wasn't much strategy, because the way to win is to literally tunnel and camp.  That's it.  That's your 100% win rate.
---
On a side note, I hate that they were permitted to rip off DBD, but oh well.  (Just so you know, the idea that BHVR permitted them to do it, and even helped, is actually a publicity lie.  This has been well-documented by the Chinese fans.)
---

There is a 0.39% of all the keys spawning in the same box. They rigged every bit of RNG to their favor with map offerings and mist offerings. I had nothing I could do until they cleansed haunted. Then I get 0.39% luck from the entity. I know it is a dick move but they started the war I just finished it.
---
ahh yeah i knew there was another totem perk but i couldn‚Äôt remember what it was!
---
Since the Legion Nerf I have not run into any Legion at all.
---
Ruin, Nurses, Shadowborn, then BBQ for points but also Infectious Fright is better once you‚Äôve got a bit.
---
I calculated it, there is a 0.39% chance of it happening. I played over 200 Pig games. It was bound to happen once.
---
Yep and not a week have passed as a killer. Dont get the wrong idea, there are some amazing and nice survivors but most of them were straight up awful.
---
The new kimono! I‚Äôm sure not as many people have done it yet.
---
I didn't want to imply that. I just can't help commenting whenever this discussion comes up about something non-essential (like cosmetics in a videogame, or the price of a new TV set or some luxury good), because there seems to be an awful lot of complaining about prices going on everytime.
---
If I don't like the cost of something, I just don't buy it.
---
Camping, in my personal opinion, is a game breaking mechanic that ruins the fun of all players. That's why I feel like it should be a reportable offence. But tunneling might be a bit far and there is a lot of grey are where that's concerned. But if you're going to sit there and just wait for me to die on the hook then why would you be playing killer in the first place?
---
 I think they meant it would be easier to apply map pressure with the character, instead of investing hours into a single character just to learn how to do that.
---
This is *news* to me!
---
Yeah he has better antiloop on this one specific tile, on other tiles they will just keep running the loop.
---
My spelling mistakes are part of me now. I cannot type normal English sentences without making those mistakes:( LEt's keep this between us.
---
And why are killers punished for survivors quitting?
---
I figured this one will be most suggested, either this or school outfit üòÖ
---
Because the game doesn't know who quit when Killers force quit. It only knows that the connection was lost.
---

I run into killers that even if 2 survivors dc at the start they still go ham trying to kill. I have run into some guys being nice but most that I got up against are hard core sweaty but that is prob because they are like rank 5 and lower.

Reading it back now I realize that it is kind of out of the blue, this was written in a kind of rant so I just skipped and didn't fully explain. If I had composed my thoughts better I would have said that there should be something done for camping, besides them not pipping or de-pipping because that just ruins the fun for even more people not to mention the new guys that start making their way up the ranks and get discouraged by camping killers.

Thats normal. They thought they achieved smth.
---
I usually run against mostly in rank 5 and lower killers. But that is because I play with 2 people mainly and they are both rank 4 and 5
---
The DbD team helped make Identity V
---
Hell yeah she is.
---
\*Injured oink\*
---
Unless of course the killer has Hex Ruin, then you can't really do gens and all the time spent looping the killer must be used to find the Hex totem which has varying degrees of success.
---
Yeah, there‚Äôs some things I like in Identity V over DBD, but none of them are actual gameplay mechanics.
---
I'd say it's an absolutely inevitable camp
---
How‚Äôs that racist
---
Yeah that perks is pretty good, i dont run it but i think you have to be working the gen when it pops for the perk to activate.
---
Honestly, that's the face I make when I pop a gen in 30s with Prove Thyself and all 4 on the same gen
---
Yay, I inspire people.
---
''Switching to dedicated Servers is a complexs process.''
---
No it isn't. Period.
---
You are welcome, random citizen!
---
Again, that's just a publicity lie.  NetEase, the Chinese developers, ripped off DBD 1-for-1, BHVR confronted them, NetEase paid DBD a royalty, BHVR made a fake video about helping them.  If you just spend a little time searching for it, you'd find that the Chinese fans have documented this.
---
Yeah...we know
---
It reads as Rank I lol
---
Tbags I can understand. But how is everything else toxic?
---
What's this, the evil twin of Crab Rave, Shrimp Party?
---
No that dude knew because we had 1 dc and he knew that other dude was a closet person because the dude did not have quick and quiet and we all knew he was in the closet. At the end there was even just 1 gen left and it took 20 minutes to catch my friend and the dude never even tried to do the gen. The killer even said the knew the dude was worthless but that he lets the last guy live.
---
*insert internet explorer meme here*
---
I mean the same whiney ass logic you are puking out could be used here. I don't know why this upsets you so much, if OP doesn't want to support or buy into the gimmick of battle pass, then you pouting about it in reddit comments wont change anything. Its his money, hes allowed to dislike something. Now go pick up some tissues and write in your journal
---
Be glad it wasnt the one with the one direction music in the background
---
WHAT?!
---
&gt; So if I buy Ghost face, does it include its own map?
---
Ghostface chapter has no new map.
---
How does he has map pressure when all you need to dispel his sleep is a failed skill check? You either tunnel a person you managed to put asleep or you're just running around the entire map with the School Photo trying to keep them asleep while they are constantly popping gens.
---
Actually, it was.  It was a blatant copy.  Only, they got caught and paid off BHVR to say that they helped them make it.
---
My personal favorite is the schoolgirl outfit.
---
but Barry is a dick
---
you made the mistake of classifying michael and ghostface as the same body type. Michael is a Hunk, and Ghostface is a Twunk at best and a twink at worst.
---
We used to be able to see character portraits in the post game menu... I think. It used to be there until they revamped the ranking system.
---
They're getting their money, but only because NetEase paid them off to avoid a lawsuit.
---
But... isn't Switch mobile, now?
---
(jkjk)
---
Most campers are looking for easy kills, using the hooked Survivor as bait. Teammate comes to rescue, they down them, double the Survivors for half the work. Camping has always been considered a valid, if not necessarily valuable, tactic. The devs only recently added the emblem penalty for hook proximity, but since rank is still pointless and campers don't give shit about rank, it hasn't really changed anything.
---
None of the things you mentioned in your post are "toxic"
---
I said it before, I wait at the gate because I cannot leave, I did not teabag I unchrouched I did not deadhard I used my ambush. Stop disrespecting my Piggy.
---
I'm there with you.  There are things I like about I.V., too.
---
It‚Äôs not stealing content if I‚Äôm asking permission for the use of clips and giving credit for them so why don‚Äôt you rethink your statement
---
Devour Hope is pretty fun, but weak. I'm not sure how you could buff it without making it too strong though.
---
Also as a Kate main I would love a buff to Dance with Me. A longer duration and possibly a shorter cooldown as well would help a lot.

Zombie made the 100day memes which were all great, cookie makes amazing cosplays.

 Ok, so, I was playing with my friend against a spirit, and she was cleansing with no ruin, so my friend said: "Watch out, you are going to get haunted grounded" "OK" *Haunted ground pops* *Tries to take a hit so I have my dead hard* *dies* 
---
got em
---
Yeah, I know I'm not imagining it, but I THINK they removed it once the Emblem system was introduced.
---
Yes. Please do. Always cleanse totems. Especially against spirit. You see that lit boi you take it apart! What‚Äôs the worst that could happen? Not like all 4 of you could wind up slugged in the first 60 seconds of a match...

Yeah, played a fair bit of Myers today because Survivor ques have been terrible and I could never get better than bronze in chaser even though I was getting 3Ks on average. The only iri my infinite T3 Myers got was Gatekeeper. Yesterday was my first time playing in months, since before the emblem rework, and I hadn't realized they'd fucked it up this bad.
---
Some really fine piece of work &lt;3 . Love for Susie is still strong!
---
You are making good choises, any Pig player is a good player. Except the tunnelers and campers.
---
I'll give you some facts real quick. I dont even play killer, I just like her character so ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Thank you so much üíï
---
"What's in a new post by GlenOck?" - "Pig is cutest, she needs buff, yada-yada, Oink"

Boring, overdone stuff.

...and she's my favorite killer.

Seems about right.
---
no
---
DWIGHT POWER!

Anything with Pig is fine, just make her happy and treat her well.

Yeah. Sometimes I'll get the comment 'why tunnel me?' and I'll think.... Wait who are you again?

**Beast of Prey** - You do not emit a Red Stain. Actions in the Hunter category grant 50%/75%/100% more bloodpoints. Bonus bloodpoints are awarded post-trial.

Please explain this to my team cause i alone cannot always do all the fucking totems at least do 1 yourselves.

was in rank 19, and had these 4 stack swf that ranked 9-15. two only just escaped  and I killed the other 2. one of them started saying  gg ez even though that person was my first kill.
---
Thanks fam mine is usually building sketches and stuff but thank you!
---
In double bp events I almost exclusively play killer because they decided whether farming is going to happen or not. I pick wraith and dong around the map like a lunatic. If the survivors aren't brain dead they figure I want to farm.
---
Except the t-bagging
---
Probably internet. I've ran into a few lag switchers lately
---
\*Happy oinks\*
---
Occlusion doesn't make sense in this game to me.  
---
They also executed it very poorly, but that's not the point.
---
Ok where did you find all this info?
---
Stridor isn't a good perk to me because it makes me hear people as if they were next to me; I have a hard time knowing where they actually are.
---
u/nwordbot u/BadDadBot
---
Take note that they‚Äôre dead, and the second they died, they blamed you instead of themselves. You were smarter than them and they had no scapegoat for their fuckups, simple.
---
Small game sucks ass the 12 meters does nothing its so small that by the time you have already seen it or was going to look there anyway
---
I saw yesterday a Monto's video where he was playing those perks as spirit + devour hope. Every single totem on the map is active. Also, he used praying beads so he would just appear behind someone cleansing and pick him up instantly.
---
Yea he is very enjoyable to watch
---
SB is a really good exhaustion perk as it can get you from a dead area to a pallet or window.
---
Oh yes he has, he's got like 1ks and 2 ks in killer matches and he uploaded it on YouTube taking like how he could've taken much better decisions and there are countless videos on YouTube of him playing survior where he dies and often give props to killer about how good he played and all.
---
It can be frustrating to see someone rant but streamers are human too yall, chill out and have fun.
---
I am just happy he's playing pig again haha
---
The lit totem is actually to not queen's right

Dear u/baddadbot,

It has come to my attention that you have said the N-word, despite your lack of an N-word pass. 
---
Please refrain from saying the N word, otherwise further action may be warrented. 
---
If you wish to acquire an N-word pass, please contact the offices of Barack Obama.

I am, I don't run perks. maybe you should do the same.

Adrenaline and sprint burst stacked too... was insane looking back at it.

Those are the games where you're actually just doing a daily and fucking around and you end up covered in Dwight.

It‚Äôs my own version of the bell in the game. It‚Äôs definitely not copied exactly the way Behaviour would have done it, but I used the bell from the game as reference.
---
Hey tysm for helping, I played for like 2 months before I deleted it due to space. But it was always my favourite game tbh. I played that bunny girl with the axe hahah but the humming got kinda annoying!! And yes I guess its intense, even know you're experienced do you still find it intense and a bit scary at some times?
---
I understand what you're saying. You're right, the animations team could just work on moris while the bug team works on their parts of the game.  
---
I just meant that they shouldn't be pushing towards more cosmetics and animation.
---

&gt;  Except the tunnelers and campers.

So, except most of them

The good ol days when Sabo was meta.
---
XDDD
---
Why is she so calm???
---
Thanks, i guess.
---
i had a spirit doing that. I spend half the game pretending cleansing the totem then hide to make her waste her time.
---
She still came each time. Good diversion for your teamates.
---
Regular occurrence?
---
Very fitting seeing as OzStravaganza was this past weekend :)

People need to learn to play him
---
Sounds like a perfectly reasonable reason for Dcing tbh. Why would you want to reward a killer that apparently is exploiting by trapping you in a corner, which will soon mori you?
---
1). Absolutely amazing cosplays.
---
2). Skilled animator who remade memes with DBD characters and props for 100 days.
---
3.) "Pig = Upvote"
---
Also all three seem like genuinely friendly people from my limited interactions with them.
---
Nah dude most of us are upset
---
Was insta-saw Billy not good enough for you?  
---
Did you ever think omegablink Nurse just needed more range or another blink?  
---
Is Iridescent Head with 3 hatchets too weak?  
---
Just use another add-on!
---
You're the boss
---
Acronyms are so hard
---
Actually yeah. I have thousands of hours accumulated in game and a sneaky Myers/Pig will never seize to freak me out. Going off what I already know, Ghostface will also have a stealth oriented power.  
---
Perks like spine chill and premonition can help you out if you get too paranoid.
---
I‚Äôm a relatively experienced survivor, I don‚Äôt play killer because they normally take the bad end of toxicity and I just wanna steer clear of that. While I‚Äôm on a generator I scout out areas I can run to and work with, but killers like Trapper and Clown can knock me off track and make me think quick. Trapper gets me really paranoid, but sometimes they‚Äôre predictable.
---
Hey I mean that's just your opinion man
---
So basically "JuST BrEAk THe PAlleT" 
---
Or "Infinite take skill" :D
---
Good thing i never cared for those entitled rules said by either trolls or entitled brats.
---
Sad to see Devs catering to this toxic mass and trying to implement this kind of childish mindset/ruleset into the core of the gameplay, with some shits like : 
---
"If you stay close to me while hooked, y...you lose some Emblem's points you meanie :'o "
---
Again : LUL
---
He wouldnt dc coz we are playing together but want to struggle and die. He keeps getting found or tunneled till death by nurses. I have even seen nurses who blink away but hold the blink to tunnel down the victim right after unhooks. I take the heat if i can but man they keep going after him like a magnet. Now he is back to overwatch and stuff. Lasted for like a week tho.
---
I guess it's just practice eh? I gotta just play the game, watch tutorials, etc. I've never understood perks or med kits or something, cause I thought they were useless since you only get em once a game then gotta buy again, or am I wrong?
---
\*puts Borrowed Time back in the box\* 
---
Okay you got me.....
---
\*Proceeds to dead hard into MoM into Adrenalin\*
---
Killers are just too coward to open their mouth while they are alone against 4 retards bullying them. Most of the time they just close the chat asap.
---
But when they play themselves survivor i bet they are the same kind of spoiled childs.
---
I don't camp or tunnel, do you like me?
---
bruh
---
So if 4 people are working on a gen it will progress at 400%?
---
At that point the player who plays the survivor gets knocked out of the game. The spirit posseses the avatar of that survivor without TR or stain and can sneak up and kill other survs :)
---
So if I'm a low rank they will just target me straight away, and troll me? Or no?
---
YAY.
---
I've had a few survivors yell at me for going on a 4k and not letting them escape, or being mad at me for "wasting" their party streamers since I didn't want to farm. Luckily it's rare, but man, I hate how entitled some survivors act. I want my BP and I don't have to give you anything. Other great stuff is when they're hating you for using good perks (ruin, no-ed, survalience etc.), Add-ons or ANY Mori. 
---
I understand some of that stuff is frustrating to go against (I know cause I also play as a surv), but looping, MOM, and sprintburst are just a few things that are annoying enough to face as a killer without them pointing at you, or tea-bagging at hyper speed whenever they get a pallet or escape. (Note: I don't think that looping and the perks mentioned are toxic, just that sometimes it's annoying, and the annoyence is only worsened when they're toxic). 
---
It's the worst when you DO try to appease them and limit your tunneling, perk usuage, and stuff like that, only for it to harm you. They get mad at the strategies that are good and non-toxic (in small amounts) because it kills them.
---
TLDR: sometimes, people are mad at you for doing anything, even though the stuff they do is also annoying.
---
MY MAN, LET'S GO! Show these survivors who's the REAL BOSS! I LIVE from their salty tears in the chat ahahaha! Upvote from me :)
---
It‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll get into matches with them if you‚Äôre at a lower rank. SWF teams are usually littered with trolls, you can leave the lobby if you don‚Äôt want to play with them, this is known as dodging.
---
The last one should be the ranch
---
Just send these cunts to *THE RANCH*
---
what is so bad in investing time in character you like? pretty sure it's a choice. if i wanted easy wins I'd main Billy, man.
---
I approve this message, my girl is stong!
---
I'm thinking more about what we'd see from Docs, Spirits and Legions, to be honest.
---
Alright I messed up a bit, he doesn't have a broken very rare addon. Instead he has a very rare addon that considerably increases the rate at which survivors are marked by the stalk, while increasing the rate at which it decays. Also his very rare crouch movement speed addon is just moderately, not considerably.
---
And yes, he has a rare addon that increases his movement speed while crouched, too.
---
It was about as good as I get on PC, so I doubt frame-rate will keep people from playing it.
---
It's fine if I dodge them if I know they are ruining my gameplay though? Like positive dodging haha.
---
That fucking cropping job is wow... The level of shit post is amazing dude.
---
you clearly can't play Fred properly if you think it's the only way to play him
---
i only find it acceptable to camp if the gens are done/gate is opened
---
This is all from the dev build. Those addons might be different on Tuesday, since his first two perks that aren't furtive chase/simple formula weren't even in that build.
---
It is lol but you go off complaining about whatever you can
---
Yes, but only if one of the survivors has Prove Thyself.
---
&gt; The only issue that I have with the crouch speed buff though is it will incentivise Pig players to follow their trapped victims and I honestly don't have a good solution to this yet.
---
Don't buff it. There, fixed it for you.
---
Gotta get that 1K blood points and peace of mind
---
I don't hook camp either and I am pool noodle.
---
Lag switching huh? Haven't seen them in a long time sucks for OP, I have faced 2 lag switchers in my close to 200 hours and have reported both of them and they both have got banned 
---
Always report them
---
If this would happen, we'd see more rage quits and more sweatier builds than what we see now. As a survivor we wouldnt wanna run into a super sweaty 3 add-on killer, and as a killer we wouldnt wanna see survivors running boarderline insta-pop/sabo toolboxs and super flashlights. 2 add-ons are good enough, 3 would be alittle much.
---
exactly! in some other post op argues with me saying all you can do is tunnel lol sure, i tunnel and camp swfs on red ranks as perkless/add-onless Fred, this is how i get 2-3k, yeewaaahhh, not by mindgaming glimpsing and knowing when to give up on a chase and make them show me to other people or just waste time waking up. lol
---
&gt; versus a tryharding nurse
---
I'm not one of those though, i just play for BP and fun :P Although i must say, fuck Haddonfield.
---
If you‚Äôre in game and leave the game constantly you‚Äôre probably gonna get punished. Everyone does it once in a while, just don‚Äôt abuse the feature. 
---
I can link a page with the best perks for survivors + killers if you need it. It‚Äôs community rated :)
---
Removed - Unrelated/Oversaturated Content
---
Docs and Spirits I can understand, but Legion?  
---
Legion doesn't have amazing add-ons.
---
He came out at the start as well
---
Wont this just encourage more SWF?
---
ah yes the game hate the people who use those offeringa
---
There's nothing wrong with it. A lot of people are just turned off by the insane amount of work required to be good at Freddy.
---
If this were to be implemented, a massive add-on nerf across the board would have to be implemented which for me is far too much work to change a system that is not broken. I know you only want this as an offering idea but it would have such a drastic impact on the game that sweeping changes would be required to even half-achieve balance. A cool, quirky idea but it will probably cause more harm than good.
---
Play Leatherface so survivors will think that once they get downed their game is over, so they‚Äôll be much more scared and immersed. Larry has a bad rep for facecamping, and it‚Äôs justified.
---
Yep, but "I Pig, I tunnel" is a playstyle I see most often
---
People always complain.
---
I don‚Äôt mind the button mashing but what I really hate is the wiggle to get free. Really messed my left stick up with it. 
---
It is annoying to die on hook if you slow down the mashing though but I really can‚Äôt see anything else working as well
---
well i am not sure about the rework yet so waiting for ptb, naturally. but i and many other Freddy mains already put a lot of time into him and now we'll have to forget the whole thing literally after a year and a half since his release. that's really disappointing cause i spent 300 hours to become Freddy and i love him as he is and always thought he only needs some minor tweaks like 0 progress upon objectives in transition and maybe some small addition for help in chase like teleporting to pallets/windows or creating those to compliment the actual Freddy lore where he is The Dream Demon. i'm not happy about gen teleport and definitely not happy about how the Dream works now from the little bits they through in announcement. but of course i don't panic, it might be good. yet i am definitely not happy cause basically my main, my favourite killer is getting a full rework regardless how i do with him, how i feel about him. even though i literally only bought the game because of him.
---
Technically, yes. You have barely done anything for your team; you just sat on a hook for 2 minutes. The killer usually depips as well, though.  
---
There is already a system for negating these negative effects - killers get an emblem penalty for camping which incentivizes them not to camp. They can't just stop camping in general; it's a valid tactic.
---
You SHOULD NEVER DC, why in God's name will you DC from a multi-player game if you don't like what the other player is doing, the survivor here is denying to get morried then don't get caught ffs, just accept that you're bad and let the killer mori is is that hard? Plus it's not an exploit as during the stun animation the killer has no collision, if we really go past that defending disconnects in this game is truly maddening for me.
---
Yes
---
Love your wallpaper haha
---
I don't think I play any killer with end game in mind, maybe that's why I'm impartial to EGC changes in general.
---
As for "she's just a standard killer that gets looped hard"... My standard answer is to watch PsychoScorpionz on twitch. He's the best at playing Amanda in non-endgame style. I'd say he doesn't get looped hard.
---
why if i get grabbed from a gen and saved somehow, I get off the killer grasp in injured state?
---
So dumb..  I love it
---
The single best perk in this game is BBQ &amp; Chili; it gives you double bloodpoints as long as you hook all survivors as well as amazing tracking.  
---
Other great perks are Enduring(Billy), Spirit Fury(Spirit), Ruin(Hag), Whispers, and Sloppy Butcher.  
---
I recommend playing Wraith to learn the game, or Billy if you're feeling like you can learn another somewhat complicated mechanic.  
---
Tips for killer: Learn how to play basic tiles, moonwalk, and learn how to Slug.  
---
Huntress is one of the more complicated killers, so I wouldn't recommend playing her first.
---
Its probably going to lead to new killer players giving up or switching sides. Which is fine until it starts affecting que times.
---
Why do the eyes go through the hair? Kinda ruined it for me, other than that its great!
---
I legit got to rank 6 as doctor before the pipping changes, but his ability seems so non reliable it hurts my brain when even after calculating the time and shocking the survior before a vault, the animation still goes through and the survivor vaults it EVEN THOUGH THEY GOT SHOCKED AND THEY SHOUDNT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO VAULT IT..
---
MY GOD I HAVE SO MANY MOMENTS OF ME JUST SCREAMING AT THE GAME
---
Huh I thought it worked that way due to how Prove Thyself is worded. Thanks for the correction, I wonder how the game calculates it.
---
People get to play with their friends? Unacceptable.
---
"doing gens, you?"
---
An attribute of some anime styles I suppose. When I erase the parts that go through the hair, I end up liking it less for some reason ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
When I was a baby nurse, I kept trying to hit this Meg who greatly outskilled me around shack for the entire game. I easily could have gone after one of the others, or just been a sweaty bloodlust nurse, but I was DETERMINED to get a blink hit.
---
I managed to get her FINALLY after 4 gens popped and let her go. I didn't care that I depipped, I WON dammit!
---
Likewise, when I'm playing survivor and stubbornly go for that one generator the killer's defending. It's about PRIDE dammit!
---
Or has one of those sneezes that take awhile to let out, then she vomits
---
Additional notes- Survivors cannot attempt to escape basement hooks.
---
Some insight to these recommendations, 
---
When playing with friends i noticed the escape attempts were fairly stupid due to its restrictions which essentially removes an entire Hook process. I didn‚Äôt really enjoy this as it could lead to some fast games where you happen to be down, But when someone tries to suicide rescue you in Stage 2 of the hook the killer attacks you again. By adding an additional hook chance and having Escape viable it would lead to more situations where the killer needs to adapt and can‚Äôt rely on camping effectively.  
---
Having a hook break on the 4th Interaction is to give ‚Äúwiggling‚Äù more power, If a killer uses the same one too often he‚Äôll have to risk running across the map to hook someone which will lead to them escaping. survivors can use this by forcing the killer to the same hook before going down as a back up plan. 
---
Hatch changes- it‚Äôs an easy out with no actual work, By adding a second interaction it will give the killer a chance to react with a much bigger window for the survivor. He could press the button and start repairing generators while the killer is watching the hatch for example. I figured it would be cool to allow the last guy to ‚Äúbreak it open‚Äù which will take around 9-13 seconds with no aura but lots of sound, This interaction would be similar to a generator progress wouldn‚Äôt be lost if you were interrupted. 
---
This was also the reason i added the ability to destroy a generator, It would counter the one lucky guy to be on the empty side of he map, It adds tension as well since they could be close to escaping when the power is cut! However there‚Äôs a safer way to escape which is to power All of the generators, If he cuts the power you‚Äôll still be in a great position to recover. 
---
The ‚ÄúStamina bar‚Äù, This is to lessen the strength of ‚ÄúKiting‚Äù, It‚Äôs extremely effective as it stands and with the addition of the chicken dance of The Division 1 fame, It can be quite frustrating. With this the survivor will gain less of an edge when juking their killer.  Additionally the ‚ÄúSwipe‚Äù is specifically for the chicken dance (That side to side motion) By ‚ÄúSwiping‚Äù You can confirm a hit at the cost of damage but it will make fights less drawn out when you can clearly out play his jukes and get within melee range. 
---
The faster recovery- This is a buff for survivors having a second hook, It will probably need to be adjusted for killers like MM but having to wait in addition to the survivor usually gaining a speed boost is pretty annoying, Especially when they all have medkits. 
---
The ability to ‚Äúinterrogate‚Äù- This is to give the killer more options, ‚ÄúThey downed a player‚Äù, Where are his friends? ‚ÄúGenerator completes across the map‚Äù, Not going there. With this the killer can gain some insight and will be less of a camper as he‚Äôll be more aware that players are close or within range of a chase. Additionally because players can escape easier they‚Äôll have a possible out. 
---
The basement- It‚Äôs scary to go down there, The killer has a huge advantage and you usually trap yourself but that‚Äôs how it should be imo, So i‚Äôd like to buffed it. Originally characters wouldn‚Äôt be able to escape basement hooks and tbh I‚Äôd add that if I could edit posts. The basement is a fly trap and can easily get at least 2 people hooked and due to the hook placements they‚Äôll be hooked immediately. The killer now has a reason to Want them down there as it takes their allies much longer to free them which gives him some form of map control.

I've only been let go once and it was my first game ever, a Wraith actually let me survive and let me win!

That's still the only time a Killers spared me, all other times. They just kill me.

Ive been doing okay with her, i hit most of my hatchets and won both of my firts matches playing her.
---
exclusive content sucks
---
reeeeeeeepost
---
No need to get defensive. Dont we all want to play with decent ques and a more balanced experience rather than long ques and 4 disco bros t bagging the rank 20 wraith.
---
I think Stolen Sketch Book + Filthy Blade  + Cold Dirt/Stab Wounds Study would be DC-worthy if played right.
---
lmao tht too
---
My thought: you do not *deserve* to pip. If you are downed first and facecamped, you had a bad round. It's unlikely that this will haben to you every round, even if every killer facecamped, because there are three other survivors who could have bad luck as well. So, statistically speaking, you'd loose a pip every fourth round if every killer would act like this.
---
My conclusion: stop thinking about pips and how to make the game hand them to you for doing nothing and start promoting a way to play the game that makes facecamping unfeasible.
---
I'm just saying she's a complicated killer; she's the killer with the highest skill-cap.  
---
There's much more to Huntress than any other killer in this game. I still recommend you to start a few games with Wraith and get the basics down, then move on to the more complicated killers.
---
You're preaching the truth.  
---
Keep hanging on and killing those SWFs.
---
As a Jane main I appreciate how good Jane looks in this lol
---
Cold Dirt, Susie's Mixtape and Joey's Mixtape (I'm pretty sure it is Joey's) for virtually no cool own at all after stabbing would be DC worthy
---
God I miss how good this game used to look. Yes, it had bugs, and flaws, and absolute shit balance, but man, did it look phenomenal. Now everything's too bright, open, and altogether not consistent with the feeling I used to get of being trapped in an area with a killer.
---
I don't know who this repost fella is but he seems to be the talk of the town.
---
Every 13th of a month there's a "rank reset"  
---
The rank reset puts you a couple of ranks back(each rank up is 2 pips from 20 I think). You also can't go lower than rank 15 after getting there.
---
I've been insulted for gifting the hatch to survivors. (It's only been like 3 times, but still).  
---
I was feeling nice and carried the last guy to the hatch - he then proceeded to flame me in the post game chat saying things like that I suck and I only got him through bugs, exploits, playing an OP killer (Myers) and stuff.
---
Thye aren‚Äôt wearing the same vest http://gph.is/28PNQ7e
---
Better to get wins? Or to get DCs? Because when I was talking about record number of DCs I was thinking about amount of annoying builds that we'd see with 3 add-ons.
---
They should change it so if a shock hits a surv as they start a vault, it would actually fucking keep them in place for once. This is the reason why I, and many others, have quit doctor.
---
Fair enough
---
I‚Äôm on OG Xbox One so that‚Äôs probably a contributing factor as well haha
---
Dude doctor was the first one I purchased costumes for it hurts me now I can't play him sometimes.

I cant even imagine that anymore. Myers was my second p3 and I always run a buid on him I call "fuck you" myers. Enduring, brutal, bamboozle, bbq. Dont even need ruin anymore, dont run m&amp;a, dont even try stealth besides the very beginning, its amazing, it really feels like you are myers where they try and run, break pallets, vault windows, but you cannot be stopped no matter what, you just relentlessly chase.

Yet again, people DC against Billy, the killer I think is the most fun to play against.
---
True, but it doesnt have to just be SWF, alot of people play both survivor and killer regardless. Plus theres always the KYF where people can just mess around with random builds for fun. I think its good to see someone trying to bring a community together

Nah I'll be right thanks.

The Birth of a Nurse Main

I play both surv and killer. As a killer I DC when it's a SWF that genrushes and teabags, AS a surv it's when I get tunneled to all hell and blasted through the 9 floors of hell itself and or a Legion
---
What the point of that?
---
I get almost 1 DC/game with my Billy :(

People just DC against everything. There's no penalty. In other words, if you aren't having, just DC.

For me it was the other way arround (regarding your switch and hours).  
---
I've been playing killer for 400 hrs and hated survivors because of the unnessecary bming (Tea-bag, flashlight flicker after any pallet stun, not leaving at the end of the game) but hell ...  
---
switching to the survivor side made me hate survivors even more.  
---
If you taunt me because you won ... okay.  
---
You insult me because you lost? ... good. It's usually funny seeing them coming up with excuses and justifying their losses.   
---
"Oh you only won because you used perk X / did strategy Y". Well yes, how do you expect me to win otherwise? 
---
But being a survivor ... People are just incompetent.  
---
TWO out of THREE games you get atleast one survivor that disconnects after he got hit or downed. And if not, they try to free themselves on the hook immediately and proceed to sacrify themselves if the 4% didn't hit.  
---
And if they don't dc they just don't do gens.   
---
How many games did I have where I've been kiting arround the killer for minutes and not a single gen did pop.  
---
I've started to play with one premade and everytime when he's dead and I am kiting for minutes I am asking him what they are doing (since he's spectating) and they are allways hiding somewhere or just crouching through the map with no destination known to man.
---
Fuck, being a killer main made me dislike survivors because every other game you get a toxic shithead.  
---
But being a survivor player made me despise survivors because every game you get atleast 1 guy being useless who dc's which lowers your odds of winning drasticly.

The legion update was a buff, people just didn‚Äôt give it a chance. Legion is mid tier killer now.

Yeah this is happening consistently, I‚Äôve actually got to rank 16 3 Times now and rank 15 once and it‚Äôs put me back to 17 every time. All within the last rank reset.
---
Np
---
You don't want to rank up as killer because the game is no fun playing against toxic swfs. I recommend intentionally disconnecting to stay around rank 15

If this is your play style. Take this from a fellow killer. Your a terrible person and you must stop before you cause an emotional breakdown.
---
Well it's not "someone crouching a few times that makes me angry ", as I said, teabag + dc + chat harrassment. It's the toxicity of the community in general that makes me feel bad about the game. 
---
It's a great game, but the thing that's killing it it's the people who play it and enjoy harrassing others. I don't see Behaviour doing anything about it, like ok, you  won't ban anyone for teabag, it's ok, but make another game queue for dc + harrassing people so cool players can be matched with other cool players. Or really start banning people who harrass in game chats. The main problem that I see is that toxicity in this game is unpunished and ruin the experience for others.

Dance With Me (5 secs instead of 3), Windows of Opportunity (i think both should have the same CD as Q&amp;Q) and Boil Over (the aura reading to be increased up to 20/22/24 and the speed of wiggling of to be increased to 4%/8%/12%, basically the survivor's version of Iron Grasp)

Lies, I don't hook camp and yet I look nothing like a muscular weener.

Im pretty sure if you pass a certain rank, you're not allowed to derank back to Rank 20.
---
Nurses calling , bbq n chilli , butter murmer and discordance 
---
With nurse your priority is to know where everyone is at all times. It‚Äôs easier to predict movements but having a build isn‚Äôt enough. You need to know certain distance travels based on how long you charge your blink , know the movement speed , fatigue duration , chain blink windows and charge speed. This can be even trickier to have memorised when you use add ons that alter those blink qualities. 
---
In short. The nurse isn‚Äôt a killer you can just pick up and play, you need to learn and master her. Much like the spirit. If you fully master her and are able to play her adequately, you can use the worst killer perks and your still Guaranteed a good game. 
---
Sincerely, Console nurse main
---
no but my surv is rank 14 so I still face mostly yellow &amp; brown ranks.
---
I haven't seen a proper attempt yet tbh. The infinite hook was busted from the start. Don't remember the second attempt besides the fact that they increased hook timer which was needed because map sizes are huge and survivors had no time to get to the hook in time before struggle.
---
I think a real good start would be to slow down hook timer if no other survivors are around. The game already has this mechanic- read chaser emblem.
---
This can give survivors enough time to do all gens as intended *and FINALLY* buff leather face to something else other than just "look I'm good at facecamping"
---
he lifts them over his head. You look over a window you just see Dwight plank by on his back like hes being carried by ants
---
Playing SWF doesn't automatically make them gods at this game. You can still outplay them in chases and possibly win by slugging and knowing/ controling their position or perhaps camping if you think they are overly altruistic. If they are toxic, even better since they lose distance by tbagging, which means they won't have time to do as many loops at a possible pallet loop. All I can tell you is: git gud
---
Adept nightmare huh? Done that shiit
---
oink
---
Agreed, that‚Äôs my gen and imma finish it.
---
I get where you're coming from, but it'd have the same outcome. The survivors would stay at the very limit to slow it down but not necessarily be seen, because people always go for the path of least resistance. 
---
As annoying as it can be, camping is part of the game now, and we have to deal with it.
---
I see you are a wise man.
---
He gets more blood points the longer he struggles
---
I really hope they add another perk that can effectively slow down the game, I‚Äôm sick of seeing ruin every game as survivor and I‚Äôm not bothered playing hag for 10 hours to get it

Played both. I expected Identity V to be a blatant ripoff but the devs are getting really creative with it. The things that really make it stand out are:
---
There's a hunter who can hook and reel in survivors
---
An invisible hunter who can control up to 5 smaller hunters
---
"The photographer", a hunter which is basically what Freddy should've been.
---
A hunter who can place walls anywhere on the map at any distance from bird's-eye view (also gives the ability to survivors which in itself is only useful for killing teammates if you want)
---
A survivor with a lifesized robot that can be controlled to do the same things as said survivor
---
A survivor who can make portals through walls, buildings and/or across the whole map. You can make portals to the basement
---
A survivor with magnets that can attract/repel and stun the hunter if it makes him hit an object (it also works if standing above the basement entrance, making the hunter hit the ceiling)
---
A survivor with a lasso, which you can use to yoink the survivor out of the hunter's grasp or the  rocket chair(meat hook) and can carry them around. The disadvantage is that you're sexist
---
A straight up **blind survivor** with a cane that can reveal the hunter to everyone for a few seconds and is able to see him through walls by default with the disadvantage that everything around you (except nearby pallets) is dark and can only be seen with the sound waves your cane makes while you walk/run. You're completely blind while crouching
---
(and many more)
---
I seriously don't think mobile DbD can top that. Identity V is already standing on it's own on the mobile platform. Y'all gotta stop judging a game which you haven't even played. The only thing that is similar between the two are the core gameplay mechanics.
---
This message is like thumbs down as opposed to a middle finger, which hurts even more and I love it.
---
Hoffman trying to coverup is amusing
---
M&amp;A is disgusting for Myers.
---
Look, I understand that you're too much of a scrub to think of using it that way, but I play against good survivors who get off a hook, go and do a gen without bothering to heal and then when you stumble upon them 40 seconds later, they get downed and get a free escape. You don't have to be trying to tunnel, and the "counter"- of never hooking someone twice in a row ever, even if they're right in your face and asking for it- is terrible.
---
Devs don‚Äôt control YouTube‚Äôs recommendation system
---
Like I said, since camping is still following the objective of killing the survivor(s), it contradicts the definition of toxicity.  
---
And yes, there is a lot of toxicity in online games. Especially in PvP oriented games. But that doesn't excuse people being toxic.  
---
"jUsT gRoW bAlLs" doesn't work for everyone.   
---
Toxicity doesn't ruin the experience for me, but it does so for a lot of people.  
---
Try some empathy and start looking beyond your nose.
---
The solution to toxicity isn't: "The victims of toxicity/bullying just have to deal with it and stop being crybabys".  
---
It's: "Get rid/punish toxicity."
---
I feel like rank 1 would be a bit much of a punishment
---
I don't get why everyone is mad about that person dcing. 1 - He was dead anyways and didn't fuk his mate over with the dc and 2 - that, indeed, was a pretty douchebag move from the killer's side if youd ask me. Yet again, no im not a whiny survivor main. Im killer main and i still say that myers was a dick
---
"Am I a joke to you ?"
---
I know. But looking at their uploads to their channel, twitch etc. We see these twitch streamers/youtubers that literallt nobody's heard about. Searchinf up "Dead by Daylight", literally the only thing that comes up is Monto, Puppers, No0b3 etc. They held some type of event, a while back, whisperers of the fog? Basically, BH promoted those who have helped the game grow, and or give feedback. Neither No0b or Monto made that list, even tho they're easily the biggest part of the community.
---
no u
---
At least we don't have to deal with nurse ;)
---
this deserves it's own post for awareness tbh
---
I mean noob3 was banned twice so that‚Äôs probably a big reason on why he‚Äôs not a whisperer
---
You're hopeless with that mindset. Just report them and move on.
---
I may have to use it on my anti-healing Doc build‚Äîcould be interesting!
---
But Monto?
---
I‚Äôm not going to sit next to the hook, but I am going to keep checking back on the hook after checking a couple of gens. I know the survivors are coming for the rescue, and I have no reason to give it to them guaranteed
---
Good stuff! I love seeing this lol.
---
Yeah I have no idea about that. He should‚Äôve been chosen, he‚Äôs always pulling 6 figure view videos.
---
but then his ass would be so thique. gotta get them squadttss
---
I can't believe you got downvoted for this considering it's literally true lmao. Cote is a consultant on Identity V.
---
After they have been hooked twice. The Mori would just be an alternative way of killing them.
---
Dude. That's an attainable goal for a woman's 1RM bench, let alone squat. We should be realistic about the average woman being weaker than the average man and strongest woman being weaker than the strongest man, but putting up big numbers is a choice that people of all ages and genders can make.
---
I never get why people find teabagging so offensive
---
From what I've heard, he used an exploit like once. But once, that shouldn't be enough
---
Eh Identity V signed its own death warrant with some of its awful mechanics. Being able to instantly down a healthy survivor when they vault is just disgusting, also pallet hit detection is god awful and survivor movement speed is a bad joke.
---
Also the camping; Jesus Christ if you people think the camping in DbD is bad you‚Äôd hate this game die to the fact almost every hunter will just sit in front of the chair and wait for the survivor to die and there‚Äôs no real downside to it as most survivors die on the chair much faster than it takes to decode a cipher.
---
I wanted to enjoy it as the aesthetic style, weird progression system, maps and the survivors and killers and their exclusive buffs and debuts are all fantastic. But damn if the playerbase didn‚Äôt ruin it fast.
---
Yeah but not b/c she came out and stood in the way lol
---
Maybe devs don't like the image those players give to DbD?
---
Link?
---
Instasaw extra turning billy? Fast spirit, no phasing noise, and the ability to track blood? 6 blink nurse? No thank you
---
I've yet to try that out lol
---
So instead we promote a guy in his 50s on our 4 year anniversary who's screaming in anger to his audience/game. 100% a better "image" to DBD. And shout our a girl streamer nobody's heard about, and they don't even say her twitch name. Yee...

I do agree I find it silly they are not fog whispers but someone that dcs like every game to stay at a high rank and admits it is

my experience with it has made hiding while injured impossible if i go by cause i hear the moan of pain and "i got you in my sights

I wanted your ass out of my trial, deal with it.

I'm a bad killer? Then what are you, you died by my hands, that's just sad ;)
---
coxcomb clapper + the ghost add on makes you the splinter cell wraith and i can tell you that every time i go to pull someone of a gen i start the animation but stop instantly like game can you just not for one damn minute
---
Not a buff but don't wanna argue because it's a art thread.
---
True.
---
The thing is that it's still really unfun for the person being camped, which is why I wish they were more direct counters beyond "fix the gens pepehands."
---
"Rush gens". Literally the only people who use that expression are killer who hard-patrol/facecamp and then wonder why 4 gens have popped. 
---
Also, coincidentally the people who say "DoN't bE sO aLtRuSiTic, lEt mE lEaVe tHe hOoK",
---
He's "exploiting" because the Survivor keeps going in a locker like a bitch to deny him the achievement. Don't believe everything salty Survivor mains say dude.

No one:

And then your on death hook on your first

I messaged him and said "lol". Then we had a nice chat about Endgame stuff. He was a newbie so I told him how keys work etc and that he wont spot an item on a dying survivor. He said thanks he will look in hands when they are running from now on.

It was a nice salt-free exchange tbh

I kill to have fun, not to win xD If I see a dwight and I can kill him I'm already happy for the rest of the game, screw the results.

I bet youre the kind of person that facecamps any kind of person, not only the toxic ones

I can give the long version of what drives me but to put it short, two reasons:
---
The exit gates are open: it's strategically the right thing to do
---
The second reason. Because-I-Want-You-DEAD.
---
sure, send it via dms
---
There is already an official discord..
---
You won‚Äôt have a 100% win rate as hunter in manticore/dragon, or if you play when a new season releases in mid-tier where former champions can now four stack as whatever character they want (so you get seer spam!). A lot of people are complaining in high/mid tier that the game is more survivor-sided after the release of the survivors enchantress and prospector‚Äîwhich is kinda proven with the much longer survivor queue times happening right now. 
---
During end game, even if you do tunnel your first person out relatively quickly, against good survivors you could still be down to 1 or 2 ciphers. Then you are forced to apply more map pressure to keep that last cipher popping‚Äîif not, the survivors could still manage a draw. It‚Äôs a lot harder to camp well against a good forward, merc, forward or a priestess ready to try and teleport your tunnel target across the map. 
---
I also think it takes much longer to learn survivor in Identity V then DBD (and let‚Äôs be real, hunters like Joseph and Architect came out before DBD ever considered more ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù killers and still wanted them very streamlined) due to the diversity of abilities and cool-downs to learn. 
---
I think it‚Äôs unfortunate many players have their first impression tarnished by a clunky tutorial, the awful low-tier experience, and boring free characters‚Äîthough the weekly rotation of better characters for free helps that a little. 
---
Identity V also has a weekly update patch and a new character monthly. So balance updates (regarding certain under or overpowered characters especially) do not take over a year to happen lmao.
---
I suppose. But as my name implies, I like getting reactions out of people, so being nice generally either winds them up further or calms them down. 
---
Happy cake day btw!!!
---
I understand this. Just get triggered by the face camping Bubba after only 1 gen is done.
---
Ya, it was fun as trapper main.
---
Back then, most players considered every trapper to be a camper as they would always trap the feet and double check the hook every 10 seconds until you died.
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt even know lol thanks
---
It's so fun to do as well. Also stops me being tilted as much in the long run.
---
I‚Äôm watching this without sound and I‚Äôm just imagining the narrator from ‚ÄòWho Killed Captain Alex‚Äô yelling over it

Okay cool I thought I was going crazy when I couldn‚Äôt find any posts about it and anytime I did see something mention the bug it was from 2017.
---
Yes please!

and as killer i‚Äôm rank 8 getting nothing but 3-6 like ok my dude sure
---
MoM isn't OP, it's annoying to fight.
---
Using Spirit Fury as an example (Which is a  bad example because you have to pair it with Enduring to make it work): The Killer "gets a free hit" after 3 pallets. Now they release another perk, Spirit Anger: When a Survivor jumps a window 5 times in your terror radius, they are stunned for 4 seconds.
---
Then they release another perk, where you can teleport to a Chest when a Survivor opens them and the survivor flys back in a blast of confetti. Another Free Hit perk.
---
How many Free Hit Perks does  the killer actually need?
---
MoM isn't annoying. MoM + Decisive Strike + Adrenaline + Dead Hard + Instaheal medkit absolutely is.
---
Tbh it was a buff to the shitty party of the kit and nerf to the OP parts of their kit. 115% MS and longer FF was a huge buff. Slower Vault, ALL of FF goes away after a missed attack (which was a very much needed change), not able to see blood in FF, 32 Meter Terror Radius are all nerfs.
---
In this case though 115% and Longer Power is a fucking huge buff which kind of overshadows the nerfs. I just wish their add ons were way better than they are now. Being Blinded/Broken/Mangled for 60 Secs is dumb when it takes like 20 seconds to mend anyways...
---
It's true. Killers usually say gg or just leave without saying anything. Survivors is either gg or straight insults
---
Because he doesn't have a good enough internet connection. He's said himself that as soon as he gets a better internet, he'll start streaming

Honestly I'd just DC, I don't feel like wasting all that time. Mori me or hook me and get it over with
---
Just bought the spirit and really enjoying her, I want to get to a decent rank with her but I don‚Äôt have ruin should I just spend the next few days playing hag to unlock it or go with a perk like bbq chilly, or nurses calling instead ?
---
That‚Äôs why No Mither is the best perk for survivor. Can‚Äôt get instadowned if you‚Äôre already injured.
---
Lilth give 10% faster vault
---
Sprint burst give 3% speed
---
Dead hard can stun the killer

I would‚Äôve gotten my ass right off Freddy and put on spirit. Lol. With an EEbony Mori.
---
Role*
---
I love the meme and I love Amanda and all that but shouldn't this just maybe be NSFW considering the exposed guts of a female character in the image?
---
Probably because they are SWF, you should stay close to the hook so that they can't see across the map you after you catch one.
---
Okay...and what do I need to explain???
---
Sorry bro this is a yikes for me.
---
Real G's remember the stream where no0b3 taught Hybrid to be toxic and Hybrid taught no0b3 that dance with me/quick and quiet build.
---
Jumpscare myers is actually op in my opinion . Literally he does what wraith does but better .

You go after the survivors near the hook, I'd say theirs nothing wrong with that
---
Generally few animations overall in Dead by Daylight compared to other 3D games in this era of modern video games. Rarely do you see one off or completely isolated animations in DBD.  
---
Things like getting up from a downed state and healing could use some spicier animations in my opinion.
---
How bad did he rage in the post game chat?
---
Theres a fine fucking line between an "Opinion" and a blatent fucking insult. Jesus...
---
If you wanted the timer to stop when slugged/chased it would need to be shorter. Just saying.
---
Im pretty sure everyone on this subreddit needs to get a life considering whats on here
---
BP
---
My Spirit with Prayer Beads and Mother Daughter Ring would be unstoppable with an amulet too oh god.
---
You do realize its capped at 8k? (Shock Ability)
---
I just don't think Tru3 deserves it. Nobody does even. Not Morf, not AngryPug, not JenDenise. Nobody! Its petty. Its like talking about someone behind their back and then when they finally confront you, you turn it on everyone's head and act like you're the victim. Its stupid and I wish the mods would do something about it.
---
You say that but in doing so invalidate the entire game. This is how every hidden LOS loop works, just that instead of the survivor controlling the situation, now the killer forces the survivor to guess. In a lot of ways DbD is based off of little aspects of RNG versus long term risk assessment.
---
Lmao it turned out to be real XD
---
The game is far more survior sided thats why a lot of hunters camp in the early games
---
I'm sorry you drop a heavy pallet on anyone and they'll be stunned.
---
"you're exploiting blocking an interaction zone to get kills (which is something the devs clearly didn't want)..."
---
Well, the devs clearly don't want voice comms either but the swf was (safe to assume) using those too so...
---
Balancing hell, colorized.
---
Just one question - who will decide on perk values?
---
I wouldn't have raged, that was cool.
---
So MoM but way stronger?
---
Yeah, I don't even get mad when the killer DCs, the map is just unfair
---
&gt;fter my birthday! this is the greate
---
haha, its one day before mine! june babies!
---
I mean, devs obviously. Yes it would take a lot of work, but, it would make the game fresh again, and drastically change how people play, and the meta in general.
---
I say we have a PTB for a reason, but naw, it's just a glorified demo of new chapters at this point so fuck it I guess.
---
hell no
---
not to break it to ya but rank1 doesn't mean shit in this game lol, I derank on purpose to get more fun games.
---
Several of my friends just recently picked this game up due to it being available on Xbox Game Pass and I have to say I feel bad for the people I‚Äôve been going up against while I SWF with them.  I‚Äôm usually between rank 4-6 and since I‚Äôm with my new friends we always get really new killers and o feel mean but I‚Äôm just trying to play with friends ya know?
---
Points 4 and 5 contradict themselves, I think. With bigger playerbase it's harder to listen to everyone. And what some think is a major issue with the game (say, "gen rush") is not an issue for a big chunk of players. Add to that your 3rd point, and the players' consensus is impossible. And with that, it's practically impossible for devs to "fix" non-technical issues.
---
That‚Äôs so dumb how he managed to kick it even though it looked like you pushed the button first
---
What‚Äôs the item/killer
---
Never said I did
---
It just looks so fake. Like he's hitting them but trying not to hurt them. I know they do live action recordings and that's probably why, but use like a super soft toy sword or something so you can go to town on them and make it look realistic, not this lighting gently tapping nonsense he does now
---
I started just before Freddy release, sitting at ~670 hours
---
I absolutely love that he explains camping and tunneling and why it's not the best strategy. He explains things very eloquently, I appreciate his enthusiasm.
---
Why?
---
Joey gang rise up
---
I dunno about you guys but I personally feel like the game is at its absolute best it's ever been ( *so far* ).
---
Nice job
---
Yeah, you're gonna get there real soon. Dependent on the person but, you'll soon start to get apathetic and maybe cynical about the game. I can't obviously predict how you'll handle it but, as you can see I am very much fed up with the game.
---
I don't get these things, they let you go, if she downed you again sure, but what if she just wanted to give you a door? You people all assume the worst of each other.
---
It's allowed and yeah its boring and a bit annoying but like, go make some food or something, watch a youtube vid, or just dc
---
That pallet is unsafe provided there's no gen on the loop. If there's a gen you have to break the pallet.
---
Read your original comment. We.
---
Because the exposed guts of a male character would be a lot safer.
---
You could always not pick stuff like exhaustion perks, selfheal etc.  
---
When I play on lowranks I experiment with my builds on both killer and survivor.
---
"no one loves you" ok but I felt that. :(
---
Myers with increased stalking AND tombstone AND tuft... yeah no
---
Old Killer Ranking System was so nice and easy lol
---
Fake, addons should be Ataxic Respiration and Catatonic Boy's Treasure.
---
Maybe.
---
No.
---
Delete this
---
I guess
---
That really doesn't seem that bad. Could be a swf too.
---
Easy 8k though, killer games can be really short for lazy people.
---
Just chase people around, break pallets, break gens, 12k for doing almost nothing.
---
Trapper while setting traps
---
Ya most games have SWF
---
I was a survivor main for the longest time. They do have everything going for them. lol. Literally it's free to get to rank 1 as a survivor. I did it with no mither too! and you are forced to use hex ruin. No, no one is twisting your arm telling you to use it but to make the game even remotely fair, you have to use Ruin or NOED but then survivors cry if you do.
---
You‚Äôre only punishing yourself by DCing. It might be a waste of time and a BM by the killer, but all the time you spent finding the trial, loading in and playing the trial (as well as the BPs) go to waste. As well as the pip if you are into those.
---
Honestly, take your BPs and leave. Don‚Äôt give any salt because that‚Äôs obviously what the killer wants. If you really want to make the killer feel like a toolbag, give him a ‚Äúgg‚Äù then leave.
---
I‚Äôd put badham, haddonfield and temple of purgation over swamp (but grim pantry‚Äôs building is hell)
---
you are forced to bring ruin though. "Stop gen rushing" haha okay. You go run those free loops at haddonfield with balance landing and tell me how I can stop that without ruin.
---
Too old.
---
two wrongs dont make a right. No logic here. Next
---
Do you start doing squats after completing your homework?
---
Bottom image
---
I don't believe the devs are disconnected at all, actually. They obviously aren't perfect and we could fill a book with mistakes they've made, but most continual problems have been addressed in some way. 3 man games, pallet vacuum, double pallets, exhaustion perks, perk balance, weak killers, Brand New Parts, these things have all been worked on by the devs. Yes there are bugs in the game, but there's also been a lot of bugs who have been fixed (Just to name one, that one patch where Killers could get like 10 levels of bloodlust lol).    We also have to acknowledge that, as players, we have a narrow perspective of the game as a whole. 
---
As a matter of fact, "Lack of Incentive to Play" is being addressed in the form of the Archive and play rewards we're getting Mid Chapter 13.
---
Sadly, I do believe you are correct on the split community.  I don't think it'll ever be fixed. DBD is not just asymmetrical, but the two sides are so wildly different that it's hard to find the healthy middle in most issues.
---
Ok üëå
---
Bruh he did post cringe
---
Yeah I was mid animation, I thought I'd beaten him to it for a split second haha
---
Sounds like a lot of asset work
---
great drawing but maybe slightly nsfw.
---
I feel like it is expected as a Leatherface.  Face camping with insidious. Classic. I get wanting to "punish" the annoying things in this game but aren't you punishing yourself by face camping?  I feel like the killer looses out on more bloodpoints than the survivor does when this happens anyway. 
---
When I get face camped it makes me feel good. It tells me the killer is too afraid to let me go because I am too good.
---
Cos if he was doing that, why would he take me to the hatch and wait for the last second to close it?
---
That is the coolest shit ever really well done with this
---
Or just make things more mind game based. It's soooooooo free to get rank 1 survivor it's not even funny. I did it with no mither. all you have to do is get dead hard and loop something until they get Blood Lust 2, throw down the pallet THAT HE IS FORCED TO BREAK so he rids his Blood Lust 2, then while he's breaking it run to a vault he has to jump and loop him there. Rinse and repeat. No pallet in the game besides killer shack should be forced to break. It all should be mind games. There is nothing worse than going down a long hallway to have a pallet thrown down and you are forced to break it and lose your bloodlust to continue chase. Let mind games be the deciding factor. you saying get rid of loops. No one said that. Just don't make them free and brain dead.
---
He gets points and you get points.
---
&gt;Identity V is not a blatant copy of DBD at all.
---
Sounds like denying it to me.
---

Injuring a survivor isnt the same as catching them. Bloody coil doesnt catch them, it only injures them
---
Perk Name: Nurse became a survivor
---
The DBD devs are one of the msot interactive dev-teams I've ever seen. Compare to Valve or Riot for example.
---
Damn it, now I need tacos. Thank you, OP
---
I find it less fun, but also less frustrating.
---
For survivor play, there's a wide range of perks that allow for multiple playstyles. Play around with them, try a bunch of different builds. You can have an aura reading build, stealth, altruistic build, selfish build, immersive, there's meme builds, metta builds, and then just weird builds. Have fun with it, try to cleanse two totems a game if you're solo. Watch some streams or videos to get an idea of how to run each map in chase as well. 
---
My selfish build is adrenaline, urban evasion, decisive strike, and deliverance. 
---
My altruistic build is borrowed time, empathy, botany knowledge,  balanced landing and a medkit as well. 
---
My immersive build is urban evasion, dark sense, spine chill, and deja vu.
---
For killer, find one you enjoy the most. Some killers naturally are "better" than others but you can basically be any killer and  (if you put enough time into it) absolutely slaughter with them. The platform you play on will make things a bit different, pc is the best platform, console has some issues but it's by far still enjoyable. It's just harder to play killers like nurse, and I believe huntress as well due to controls. Perk builds aren't quite as varying for killers because some builds just won't work with a killers power, but each killer has their own sort of meme builds and such, just not to the extent survivors do. If you wanna use noed, use noed. Do what makes the game more enjoyable for you, but keep in mind others enjoyment as well when it comes to camping and hard core tunneling. 
---
For me, right now I'm playing hag (I main her), spirit, and I'm also learning nurse on ps4. Hag is great for mind games and strategizing. 
---
My favorite build for hag typically includes whispers, deer stalker, blood warden, and noed or insidious. 
---
I use a hex build for spirit, which usually includes third seal, ruin, haunted grounds, and noed. 
---
Nurse build has been whispers, deer stalker, nurses calling, and thanataphobia. 
---
Some people play leisurely and some play competitively, you'll get advice from both types of players, you'll get grief from both types from time to time for anything from your playstyle to your perk builds. Don't take it personally, do what you want and try what ever seems fun. I play for leisure, so I usually don't use too many "try hard" perks or builds and I usually don't care about winning, especially while I'm trying to learn nurse right now. 
---
Prestige, as of right now, only gives you bloody cosmetics. I wouldn't recommend it personally unless you really wanna just start a character over (been there) because the grind in this game has become tedious. Getting back up to level 50, especially if you're in better ranks as a killer, can be miserable sometimes. If the cosmetics are worth it, go for it. If not, it doesn't really benefit you in any other way.
---
Yeah obv answer but that does not mean the hooked guy will be left alone if he gets unhooked with no bt.
---
I find it really rewarding to play like this, personally.
---
After a minute I just gave in decided to watch til the end why not right
---
Rank Rewards: Good
---
Lore: Does not add anything valuable
---
Extra Challenges: Life Support
---
New Cosmetics: Cause we need more of those
---
Reworking Maps: Because everyone was asking for a rework of Preschool.
---
Oh, I don't know. I played TERRIBLY this game...
---
Only got the win due to EGC.
---
To be fair, I am a baby killer, I just wanted to know why specifically.
---
Yo, wtf??? Was the killer hacking/exploiting/cheating or was it just really bad lag/bugging?
---
Ok well what is it that you want that the dev's haven't addressed then?
---
Did you message the survivors and ask if they were swf? Because if they were then this post is pointless. 
---
Also rank is really nothing but a number. I used to be a rank 1 survivor but I stopped being so try hard-ish since the game doesn‚Äôt give incentives for reaching rank 1. I sit around rank 12-9.. my point is, I‚Äôm usually running these killers around and my rank doesn‚Äôt match my player level.
---
Imagine running Iron Maiden to counter MoM lol
---
use me as a down button
---
Isn't that the perfect conditions to pip if nobody does gens and presumably they all get hooked all the time?
---
I think for hooks it needs to be either we get an extra hook stage or increase the likeliness to kobe, but not both. The percent chance use to be 5, they lowered it to 4 because of add ons and such making it almost a guarantee you'll get off so 12 might be too high, not sure about a good percentage to go with. 
---
The hatch button sounds good in theory but it'll just create a new stand off.  Killer will camp button, Gates won't be powered so can't be opened, there's no other form of escape so killer is guaranteed a kill. Imo it wouldn't be the most balanced thing. 
---
The all generators would be very difficult and I think it could have potential as a playmode moreso than overall game mechanic. The reason you don't have to get all right now is because everyone would be on that last generator, survival for survivors would go down drastically while killers kill rate goes up drastically. 
---
Your chase mechanic idea could go hand in hand with the generator one as a game mode together. As a stand alone I'm not sure how it would work, but it seems interesting to limit survivor fov down to killer fov during a chase. It would make things more intense, bring more of a horror aspect.
---
feed my *down* syndrome
---
ok
---
**Survivor logic**
---
All have the same outfit
---
Killer can‚Äôt tell the difference 
---
*tunnels survivors*
---
You idiot! You should‚Äôve known who was who!
---
I agree and I don't think they were swf as they didn't look like they were on comms and red ranks have sweats
---
I kinda got lost, which way is Hell again?
---
is this the kid from stranger things
---
Maybe the hex totem doenst spawn until two tokens
---
Before the pip change it didn‚Äôt really but now it‚Äôs actually hard to get there because of the bullshit system giving you safety pips for 4k‚Äôs
---
... not... really?
---
Like, yes, the survivors and especially the hunters have different abilities, and a lot of the items have had some of their extra abilities removed, but the game is still mostly the same.
---
Survivors still have three movement modes, walking, running, and crouching.
---
Rocket chairs are just reskinned meathooks.
---
The killer can pick up survivors, and said survivors can escape in the exact same way as in DBD.
---
There‚Äôs a killer ability which allows you to break generators, and even though it works a bit differently than in DBD, it‚Äôs still practically identical.
---
The auras are ripped straight from DBD.
---
Many items, such as the syringe or flashlight, are reskins of items from DBD, minus the flashlight practically blinding you.
---
My point is, the game has aspects which distinguish it from DBD, but these aspects aren‚Äôt what people are focusing on, typically, and I feel no different playing IDV than DBD.
---
No idea what that guy is taking about. What I said above is my honest opinion.

damn, feels bad
---
SWF: 24/4 = 6

&gt;I should be against rank 8-4 right
---
A "gen rush" is popping gen after gen after gen. It's a specific thing when lots of gens pop in a row
---
It is fun to do the hero plays.
---
Rank rewards
---
New perk system
---
Better bloodpoints/shards gain
---
More interactive, thought provoking objectives rather than M1 simulator 
---
The game to actually have a horror atmosphere like it should
---
Eh a fatass pallet dropping on your head without the entity they would have ended up in the fog E.R
---
enduring spirit fury myers... damn.
---
I personally love it when someone gets hooked because if you‚Äôre sneaky then that unhook can be their death
---
Honestly im at the point where i dont care about either of those things. I just play to entertain my self and bleeding out isn't entertaining
---
Horror is hard to get in a multiplayer game. They are already adding rank rewards. Possibly BP/iridescent shards with the rift. I do agree with you that there needs to be more objectives in the match though however it would be hard without alienating a good chunk of the playerbase.
---
15-16???
---
We know Frank is 19+, presumably he would have made friends with people his age.
---
Did they make deathgarden good for once? Bc it was pretty awful on release
---
"To the Moon!", tier 1. You need tier 3 to actually get there.
---
I always cleansing everything, but if I'm not sure I will cleanse it when the killer is chasing somebody and that person is injured. I figure it's better now then later
---
Id be interested for you to explain swipe more and how it would fit in and work with killer attack, what the use would be realistically In game (situations). 
---
I like the idea of the killer just demolishing a generator after end game has started 
---
I don't think the idea of attacking a hooked survivor would be a great mechanic. It's already something people do when camping, it's considered bm, it would be abused more if that were a viable thing. I think it should be built in for killers instead to be able to see the furthest survivor upon hooking someone. 
---
The basement hook thing, I get what you're doing, but if someone's in the basement they're most likely getting camped in some form. It's already pretty risky to go down, I don't think it needs to be that kind of challenging to grab someone. The basement hooks can't be destroyed as it is as well. If the killer is camping the basement you will not be able to get the survivor out, end of, and killer is guaranteed that kill.
---
The generator thing should stay at six seconds per sacrifice, or increase in smaller increments instead of doubling for each one. It would be a good way to slow the game down and kinda force survivors to vary their play style throughout the match, as well as having the gens regress at the rate it would if it were kicked during that time. 
---
Speed boost for multiple players being chased yes 100 percent. It should lower as a survivor gets out of chase though. 
---
I know I'm probably sounding very survivor sided in this, but there are some things here that will make it too easy for killers. A lot of these ideas are actually pretty good, some of them even pretty solid. They're some of the most interesting I've seen that don't involve a completely new objective, good job for thinking of all this. It's difficult to come up with perfectly balanced ideas because you realize the killer, of course, should be stronger and instill fear, but at the same time it shouldn't be a rarity to escape as survivor- at least not with the current rank and pip system! If the system changed, I think a lot of these ideas I'm currently not all for could become much more viable. There's such an emphasis on everyone winning because it's what's most rewarded, and the system needs to change.
---
It's how it works for everyone.

it was YOU!
---
There is no reason specifically why, baby killer gets thrown to any killer for no reason. You could have had 4k, no gens they'd still say it. Just getting under people's skin
---
This is heresy towards daddy Myers
---
Thanks
---
Wait, since when do survivors get a notification when he enters stealth? dosent that kind of defeat the entire point? because when he enters stealth and they get notified they're gonna be on edge and more aware.
---
I like it. It sucks that a survivor who did nothing can get a free escape. Bit since killers can close hatch it balances out
---
The Entity warps it's own realm to make things happen.  Remember that this thing feeds off of the strong emotions involved here.  If it was truly an all-dominating and unstoppable killer, the survivors would quickly lose any of that fear and just accept their demise every time.  Killers would grow bored of repeatedly stabbing the same cardboard cutout survivors each time.  Entity has to dangle a worm on a hook for survivors to feel that hope and desire to escape, hence the generators, doors, and other means of escaping the killer.
---
It would he inefficient to just stick a bunch of survivors in a room with no escape and let a killer go to town.  I'm sure the entity tried that and found it wasnt getting much emotional energy after the first few times.  So it started slowly cultivating the trials we know today.
---
Unfortunately, there are quite a big amount of killer players with that mentality. I played against a very good streamer yesterday and a guy from  his chat said that he should facecamp me because I've been looping him for some time and I wasn't falling for his mindgames. He got banned right after tho :)
---
They're not, I'm a hardcore killer main with around 900 - 1k hours (haven't checked in a long time) and i know that theres as mich whining and children on both sides. We just run into 4 people every match so we notice it more on that end.
---
Personally, I think there needs to be a wide variety of killers otherwise there‚Äôs gonna be a shitload of 115 M1 killers running around. Killers need a couple really strong killers.
---
I really dislike em, I just can't deal with that shit
---
Sorry, but split roles like that would suck any form of fear or excitement out of the killer for me.  It isn't one domineering force trying to kill you, it's like, a small group.  Which just doesn't feel the same.  Especially if suddenly this deadly killer sicks his girlfriend on the body of your survivor buddy and draga them around like a sack of potatoes.
---
Man this new deathgarden update is crazy!
---
I think it‚Äôs map wide so you can never be so sure, smoke also emits from his location and spreads like 8 or so meters basically just so you can‚Äôt be right next to someone and going into stealth without them knowing
---
No DbD on chinese market tho. So Identity V is kinda safe

---
Dude you sure trolled him epic style there!
---
Yeah and what's your point? If only a small minority of the active community (that even provides feedback) why would they care? In fact listening to every inch of feedback from some gigarandoms would be incredibly damaging to the game.
---
lol really?  This is a "concept"?
---
WILF
---
This is fucking glorious.
---
No one noticed the baby Dwight died way too fast
---
dont worry, he just gave it sentience so it could float back towards you
---
Somewhere around the wiki or backstory thing says that susie is younger than the rest so presumably 15-17
---
Lol really? This is a "comment"?
---
Citation needed.  I just checked the wiki and nothing about that was mentioned.
---
Understandable
---
This &gt; hiding as a P3 Claudette and waiting for everyone to die so you can get the hatch.
---
They to have it afaik...
---
With sounds as they currently are Lightweight would be pointless. Survivor footsteps are impossible to hear even with headphones.
---
People who want to achieve an achievement.
---
You're correct ;)
---
But the old part, the old man had a good run, but every killer is fast, sure a fist fight maybe gun battle the old man can pull through, but... well it ain‚Äôt
---
Steam Achievement Manager/Modifier/Msomething, I'd assume. I'm not well versed in cheats.
---
Honestly there's some crazy amount to go through but I'd be willing to give this a shot. Whatcha wanna know
---
Cool bro, welcome. This game is rad.
---
I'd say your best bet is to watch some YouTubers and take some notes. HybridPanda is a great channel. TydeTyme made some guides a while back that might be a little out of date, but are good for some general stuff. I also watch Monto for his perk builds.
---
These were placeholders probably.
---
Yeah brah!
---
Insta heals are a rare occasion like moris
---
Ruin, Enduring, BBQ, Spirit fury. Addons: Class photo, pill bottle ;) Tactic: Hit and run, put everyone to sleep as often as you can \^\^  
---
Slug freddy is also nice. You need knockout for this :D
---
How do I delete someone elses post?
---
Hm, maybe.  It's a tough call til the devs reveal all of their ages.  They really only specified Frank's age.
---
You underestimated the power of Of her queen Crimson.
---
You toxic cunt I love you
---
Just play legion or freddy and stall the game out like a madman, don't commit to difficult chases and make them burn through pallets, it's hard not to pip on them.
---
Fine.
---
Still, the core gameplay is identical, and I don‚Äôt think it changes enough to be considered not a copy, personal.
---
Tru3talent is one I liked quite a bit he explains what hes doing as he is doing it most of the time as well. He helped me learn how to use perks more efficiently for sure
---
Actually i do. And yes, i'm an idiot.
---
Doing gens,you?
---
That's not a perk, that's the resukt of one swig of Powerthirst.
---
It's the flashlight blind. When you flashlight blind a frenzying legion it ends his frenzy but doesn't give the cooldown.

---
Well. I guess he would put up quite a fight, but would lose after some time. He might lose but I think that it wouldnt be easy.
---
That is fine. However, he can't complain about the game lasting forever when he is the one person with the ability to end the game at any time but refuses to do so
---
Naw, that's thinking like a killer. You gotta think like a survivor. From the moment you first put one of them into the dream state you were tunneling + camping. Also playing Freddy, cLeArLy OvErPoWeReD.
---
The easiest way is to look up End Game Collapse. It will explain everything about it
---
I personally prefer Discordance since it‚Äôs better against SFW, but I still think it‚Äôs a good perk
---
You seem to like slow killers :).
---
Btw, David scream like a little girl on the hook, so A tier is too high for him, change mine mind.
---
i love u
---
Spirit for sure.
---
ah yes true.
---
There you go devs! I am sure theyll do something in terms of quantity tho. Instead of placing 3 pallets you can place 4 or whatever.
---
cool
---
Most content creators don't do that. I'm happy he is taking up the mantle. I just hope plenty of them watch the video.
---
#BEAN ILL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EEEEEEARTH
---
Compared to 2016? Yeah this game is gold compared to what was
---
&gt;**I** dont care about your shitty videos
---
k because without context it looks like suggestive
---
Yeah imo if freddy comes with the snare it should be a green add on. If not the purple
---
Oh agreed. But I've seen people rage for a lot less
---
Well heres the thing, there isnt a whole lot of red rank killers and survivors so the red ranks get thrown in with purples and greens, if not red rank would be sitting for a while waiting for a lobby.
---
Barring the fact that you got completely screwed, why do people ever think that hiding behind trees or rocks is ever a good idea...?
---
It is a beautiful map. Just shrink it a little in my opinion.
---
So you can hear the hatch when it's closed now?
---
I had the exact same glitch happen to me
---
There's a lot of red survivors just a shortage of killers devs make killer fun
---
No. Not epic.
---
I dont like battle passes because i just dont have time to grind all the way to the higher tiers. This is why a prefer specific cosmetics in the store
---
THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE HORSE
---
Smh
---
Basically everything everyone else has said. A little specificity would help us out! &lt;3
---
And that is why one-sided maining is stupid
---
Honestly I dunno where am i
---
i... i use ds to prevent tunneling???
---
Are you on PS4? I need a teammate who likes to also run the white mage build
---
Uhm... no. God, I wish I could get this daily for once.

---
Better to show a pic of your emblems
---
Please kill it with fire.
---
i just tear through matches with hillbilly until people pop streamers then its farm time
---
I disagree.  While the game isn't as bully filled by design as the previous game, it still suffers from the same flaws as before.   A coordinated runner group will stomp most killers, while pugs get wasted easily by the hunter.  Hunter gameplay feels standard FPS, with twitch aiming being the most important skill.  They will absolutely need to have a better cheat detection than in dbd, as aimbotting will quickly become the norm, as with any FPS game on pc.
---
A faster paced DBD that copies many of the same mechanics, but not in a good way.
---
I dont mean it in a bad way. Gen rushing is a stupid term, if you get gen rushed as a killer you did something wrong or your ruin got rekt in 10 seconds and survivors are good, but in this case I mean that vs a tombstone myers all u gotta do is rush the shit out of gens as fast as possible and dont let him stalk u
---
1. You want to use add-ons which reduce Chainsaw charge time, this reduces dead time and makes "back-revs" (more later) easier.
---
2. Learn the maps as best you can and try to identify the areas where you can do long, continuous sprints with the Chainsaw.
---
3. Back-Revs - this is where you get right up behind someone and perform a Chainsaw Sprint. You will automatically lock onto and down the Survivor, even if they attempt to dodge. Start a couple of steps behind them to allow the lock-on.
---
4. Don't use your Chainsaw near windows or pallets, even the quickest charge is too long. This is where you use the hammer. After all, Hillbilly is still just a normal Killer without the Chainsaw.
---
5. As for perks? Any set-up works with him. But the best are: BBQ &amp; Chili, Discordance, Surveillance and Tinkerer (he can react to the information provided faster than most Killers)
---
No, you can use a keyboard but not a mouse
---
I agree that you'll find fuckfaces on both sides.   
---
At the end it's the same people playing survivors and killers.  
---
It's like you and me said - since you are encountering 4 survivor per game (as killer) the chances of getting a toxic survivor are pretty high.  
---
If 1 in 8 killers is toxic, you'll have 7 nice games and 1 bad game.  
---
If 1 in 8 survivors is toxic, every second game is going to be a bad game.  
---
Imo killers don't really have a "toxic toolkit". Yes, spamming the mori animation would be BM in my book ==&gt; Toxic.   
---
But I think that rarely happens? Atleast it never happened to me before.  
---
Camping and Tunneling is frustrating but not toxic behavior, since you are still following your objective doing that.  
---
For me it's all about the BM ingame (Tea-Bagging, FlashLight flickering/pointing at your face after a pallet stun, not leaving the trial and waiting for you to arrive to tea-bag you once more) and especially the end-game chat.  
---
And if you ask me, you usually encounter 1-4 survivors insulting the killer for losing/winning - and rarely a killer who goes like: "Gez you sucked. Kys and l2p this game."  
---
But maybe that's just my subjective perception.
---
I dont think there is a lot of red ranks in general.. I hover between 4 and 5, I mostly get purple rank killers and survivors.   
---
Killer is fun in it's own way, it's a lot easier now so I don't see the issue.
---
Yep, because if I remember right it was each survivor's head and a BP gauge around it showing how much of the old "Killer Victory Cube" you accomplished. So 1/4th of the circle = 1 hook state/ 'point'.
---
Not actually wrong though...
---
Well that's untru..  everyone I know runs it because 90% of the killer base are tunnelers... DS has saved my ass numerous times..  you my friend seem salty..
---
do you have the model from ingame on you?
---
This is almost certainly SFW. The game tried to find a killer somewhere in the middle ground. The party average is rank 6, so it wasn't too far off. Perhaps what surprises me the most is that so many high rank survivors are match against low rank killers, despite the fact that I see high rank killers also match against low rank survivors. It's common to see a full group of high green/ low purple survivors against a rank 2 killer. Put green rank survivors against a rank 2 P3 Nurse, and watch the game end in 60 seconds.
---
You know, on that subject a killer shouldn't get D-Striked if the Survivor is caught or interrupted. It should only work if the Survivor gets picked up because being interrupted is a sign of a bad play on a survivor's part
---
Same hes just a salty tunneler. Lmao

---
Then that becomes old DS.
---
The longer surv queue is because toxic survs are driving hunters away, not because the game favors the survs.
---
Do you play on ps4? I will play in a party chat and give tips for each killer as we play with them
---
DS, MoM, Dead Hard and that perk, on 4 people with insta heals
---
The smile that bans people of the twitch stream
---
Um I play on ps4 and have lots of hours to make my statement tru..  
---
Tunneling is when you go after the unhooked survivor.. that's it..  cant get mad at ds if you dont go immediately after the person who was just saved.
---
aaaand it goes with 200-400 ping even with good net, china players on Eu server who hit you through the walls (even animation of hitting wall,not survivor is played) and PrEtTy GoOd Terror shock system.
---
Score has nothing to do with rank, the only thing that matters are the emblem points (bronze, silver, gold, iridescent). The four levels of emblems correspond to different scores 1,2,3,4. You need a total of 8 points to safety pip on survivor in purple ranks, and 11 to pip. Are you sure you didn't safety pip, because I have no idea how you could have gotten a score of almost 21k without accumulating at least 8 emblem points.  
---
If you want to rank up I will leave a link [here.](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems) That will show you the conditions for emblems. Something to note is that as you rank up the pips require a higher emblem score. At a certain point it becomes almost impossible to rank up without touching all the categories. You need chases, rescues/heals, gens, and survival time. The problem with this system is that you are screwed if you are doing one thing all game. If you are chased the whole time, or working gens the whole time, you are likely to derank at purple and red.
---
The Hag had Franklin's and was chasing the same Feng that got unhooked. Feng was returning for her Medkit when this happened.
---
I, too, joined the ranks of The Pig just 3 months ago. She is really fun to play!
---
I mean I guess ? Do you have a problem with me little guy. ?
---
&gt; I sat in the basement so egc **could kill me**.
---
After a long game on haddonfield I was on my last hook and the killer was patrolling me. 
---
I watched a Jake stealth up to me almost right under the killers nose and I thought I was gonna get farmed or he would get hooked trying to save me. 
---
The killer turned his back for a second and Jake walks up for the unhook, beckon emotes, unhooks and then leads me to the hatch with the killer chasing and suddenly it pops open because I didn‚Äôt know he had a key!
---
My fucking hero &lt;3
---
I‚Äôm dead, I‚Äôm dead, I‚Äôm so dead... I‚Äôm... alive!?
---
Cheers for the quick reply, not yet I haven't thank god
---
5 perks would be ugh, 4 is fine
---
Mom said it's my turn to scare the survivors.
---
If you say so... people unhook in front of you are dumb, unless you're camping then it's a free for all.
---
Killer brings Ebony Mori and easily 4Ks
---
Tuesday
---
Hunters generally have to camp in higher tiers because the game favors survs, so by the time you get one down and on the chair the game is nearly done.
---
Not to mention tunneling is such a stupid term that people apply to the most random situations. Oh, he had an easier time finding me because I was injured? Tunneler. Oh, he hit me off hook because he was trying to punish altruism? Tunneler. Oh, he chased me for one generator? Tunneler. 
---
People don't ever seem to get what goes through a killer's head (unless they play killer), but some idiots also think that killers have to follow "rules" that are completely made up. 
---
Here's the approach that people should have to the events in the first paragraph: 
---
I was injured and bleeding and leaving scratch marks and making noise. Of course I was easier to find. 
---
Okay, that was my teammate farming me or he might have been doubling back. I come off the hook injured so I'm a target. 
---
The killer is trying to find out how easy I am to target. I'm making sure he wastes time on his own account by chasing me.
---
That seems to be the popular vote; such a bummer, cuz I feel like it could be so incredibly useful if it got a small tweaking.
---
Dbd is definetly not supported officially for mouse and keyboard support, so you use any kind of adapter?
---
Please just escape, I already know I failed you don‚Äôt need to rub it in ;-;
---
(Side note as a pig main it feels great when they teabag and then promptly get bear trapped)
---
That's true. Noed is a crutch perk too, but there's always a way to counter it. Just annoying if I'm going up against a few people with it n I'm not using one of the few who have a counter.
---
You're right, it is super funny
---
Thank you for stopping by!
---
Spirit and Hag are the 2 strongest DLC killers. The rest are mediocre.
---
Okay, well I suppose PS4 is a different beast. But with respect I would still ask you to consider Sun Tzu. Know thy enemy.
---
ugh that is zero fun to play with or against.
---
The random Kate who took two hits so I could wiggle off against Myers on Grim Pantry last night is a goddamn hero.
---
no its not
---
I am a rank 17 killer and yesterday I got matched with a rank 13 and a rank 7
---
Better than a camp or tunnel game for a beginner to learn
---
true, but still not much fun.   I still find slugging worst of all, id rather be camped than slugged
---
Not too long. The original had all the basic stuff done, so all I had to do was photoshop new images and line them up with the original video. When it comes to the number of hours this took, it's all worth it for the final result if it makes me laugh! And thank you!
---
Prooobably the Entity healing them or something because She wouldn't want them bleeding out, rather a sacrifice
---
If freddy lacks snares base he will have issues against good survivors since they are his only reliable chase tool; if he only has pallets good survivors will probebly just run round the map for a bit to memorise spawns. If freddy has snares on the other hand he can use them to shut down loops like clown and will make being asleep more of a threat. If anything if freddy only has the pallets survivors will have not much reason to wake up since while awake freddy can use his microsleep invisibility to mindgame.
---
Neither are particularly great imo but they have unique ways to play that can make them fun! Although having fun with Legion is a bit more difficult to play since his ability isn't great.
---
TL:DR at the bottom
---
I'll speak more on Plague since I play her a lot. Her ability can be amazing, allowing you to quickly end chases with the damage vomit variant. Thing is of survivors know what they're doing then they can avoid this by not cleansing. She can also struggle without the right add-ons as it takes some time to fully infect a survivor during a chase which means she wastes time if they don't cleanse.
---
One thing she handles really well though is the Three gen strategy, forcing survivors to make risky plays in order to escape. Overall she won't contend with a good hillbilly, nurse, or spirit even with her good movement speed but she can be very fun if played right.
---
And then there is Legion. His ability still isn't great, but since he got his movement speed buffed it kinda makes it better to play him. He can't done survivors with his ability anymore and the Deep Wounds effect is just a short annoyance now. His ability feels... sluggish. He is one of the greatest killers cosmetics wise, but in gameplay he is lacking. I'd say hes only worth discordinance.
---
TL:DR Meta wise, no. You'd be better off with buying someone like Spirit. At high ranks both are very weak and can struggle heavily if you can't mind game (much like most of the cast.) Plague is slightly better though. Neither have great perks other than Discordinance from Legion but they both have unique play styles and cosmetics that can drive the ball home.
---
It's not possible to argue with the truth. Also Wilf best companion
---
No mither and dead hard will cancel that
---
Seems pretty good, tho tbh I wouldn't have a benefit for cypress mori's unless you use them (eg. Mori someone with them). And as for SWF, I'd say that they should all have -100% BP's simply because of the advantage you get from being in comms with even one other surv.
---
what the fuck have you done
---
Aww she‚Äôs so happy!
---
when someone says shit like that i always respond with "i'm glad you had fun :)"
---
No worries! :D 
---
Please tag me if you wanna do any more, I love seeing some mejmejs! :D
---
I think it'll work once, but I think once Surviviors grasp that there's a Spirit, smart ones will avoid committing to actions for a long period of time and will do things that throw off a phasing Spirit
---
only actual rounds
---
Elaborate
---
Not Urban Evasion that's for sure
---
Oh don‚Äôt get me wrong tenant was by far the best doctor I just feel like Eckleston is forgotten about a lot he really paved the person the doctor became with tenant and the relationship with rose
---
Will do.
---
Never
---
It‚Äôs basically a free heal to injured from downed, only the killer has to catch you before it activates. 
---
I much prefer the version we have at the moment over the previous version though. 
---
I honestly think it‚Äôs ok, the problem with balance comes when you stack multiple strong things (perks or addons etc, both killer and survivor). 
---
Yes DS was nerfed but now you have MoM too which wasn‚Äôt a thing when they rebalanced DS. 
---
Now MoM is getting changed but just watch them add something else that they haven‚Äôt thought ‚Äòhmm maybe if our new perk is used with these old perks it will cause issues‚Äô.
---
OH SHIT, I never realized that meme was Donna's granddad...I recognized the actor but I guess I guess I didn't put 2 and 2 together. apparently I'm just a bit stupid. 
---
And also Tennant used to be my favorite but Capaldi's later seasons solidly put him in my favorite spot. I even went as the 12th doc for Halloween two years ago.
---
 Hey don‚Äôt worry man. just keep levelling up your killer, you‚Äôll get more. My wraith is level 50 and I once brought in an ebony just for the survivors to disconnect. I eventually got more. You will too.
---
That‚Äôs the shit I don‚Äôt like
---
I agree - the issue is pressing folks into doing only the gens that are unlocked after a hook.  
---
16 seconds of waiting is terrible for them with only having the gen available to work on that they were already on and is highlighted yellow for the killer.  
---
It would definitely push them to save hooked survivors though, to avoid painted gens.
---
This is art bud. You may not like it, but this is how a true masterpiece looks like.
---
Nah it isn‚Äôt. Just memed because people used to say frick when they were memeing about piggy :3
---
//Owner of the piggy meme photo ^ ^
---
Thanks for the kind words man, just was a little discouraged because Legion is the first killer I‚Äôve sunk any blood points into so it‚Äôs actually the first mori I‚Äôve ever had in a bloodweb.
---
I decided to give dbd a break for tonight but tomorrow those survivors better watch out! Lol
---
those pillager beast thingies?
---
I think if there needs to be more counterplay to it, for example if it proves too strong, then maybe buffing technician?
---
Too much to program. The Devs also want the game to attract people and not push them away. This is a SWF nerf of I've ever read one. I would like to see moris automatically max out sacrifice if you get 4K tho.
---
But he doesn't have Bond?
---
I looped a trapper for 5 gen's today and just when i got downed a random used his insta-heal on me so i could escape. Was very pleased.
---
Payback for playing Legion üö´üß¢
---
Any time this happens I make sure to message them and tell them how much I appreciated it.
---
As you can see, there was no prompt to pick the survivor up, and they could not move üòû however it was an interesting experience so of I find more, I'll be sure to post üôÇ
---
I'm the first to slaughter / face camp a survivor trying to rat out their teammates.  
---
I HATE people like that. I will give away an entire round to kill a rat.
---
Oof 
---
//the piggy grill
---
Well swfs do kind of need nerfing...
---
Ebony moris do need a little nerf, maybe not as execessive as ops suggestion
---
oof
---
I gotta show off my sick threads tho
---
One basement bubba game i did, i got 3 guys. One had DS but tried to save his friends. Then there was a Laurie and i left his ass on the ground for 2 min after he was unhooked just to be damn sure
---
Well he was definitely leading Michael to me despite knowing I was working on gens. Bond or not, scumbag move.
---
Yeah, in my mind, I can't really think of a suitable counterplay for the suggested build.  
---
It's definitely playing dirty already with the current grabber build.... adding in Tremors just makes it brutal.
---
DITTO! I feel like I'm not actually playing the game if I stay in one spot.
---
Random question: did you get the key from using Plunder‚Äôs instinct? I really want to run that perk since it increase the item rarity from chest searches.
---
Amazing hatch escape btw. Gg!
---
As a console player, I wish we had this option.
---
As well as playing as beaten up david. Saving people feels so good
---
Best counter to DS= don‚Äôt camp and try to look for all survivors individually. 4 stacks on BBQ, then it‚Äôs the same cycle.
---
If you're on PC I recommend putting turn right on q and turn left on e. Makes controlling turns easier imo for when you gotta make wide ones instead of just constantly swiping your mouse
---
Rules Set No. 2 for base kit is something I forgot to put on this list.
---
Sadly there are many players like this lately. And most of the time the killers don't care.
---
This, so much this!
---
Well you said it's a great way to deal with groups, but you can't anticipate groups, so idk how that works as a counter
---
dang
---
This image physically hurts me.
---
And another pallet is next to that broken one so survivor is safe anyway. Feels bad when that happends.
---
You might have to delete it and get another ritual my dude.
---
I want to know as well . I want to buy another killer and a lot of people say s/he‚Äôs bad .
---
He's pretty garbage yeah. After the rework, Deep Wound isn't especially threatening and he has a lot of weaknesses built into his kit. This adding on top of him being just a regular M1 killer just makes him worse than the rest.
---
Levels just changes the distance in which you can see chests. 
---
Tier 1= 16m
---
Tier 2=20m (not sure)
---
Tier 3=32m
---
It‚Äôs something like this I believe. Luck is still the same as I‚Äôve noticed.
---
Exactly, which is why Imo, a perk to counter it would be a good idea. I had an idea for a Survivior perk which obscured the auras of objects within a certain radius, but this also prevented the killer from knowing when their hex Totems were cleansed until after the Survivior left the area. 
---
A Technician buff that would freeze the aura of Generators, and streamline the "prevent gen explosion on failed check" to a token system rather than RNG and would help Gen Jockeys and stealth players (like myself when I play Survivior) to counter yet *ANOTHER* good anti stealth perk.
---
Console queue times. -\_-
---
It does lol. Haven't seen it a whole lot though
---
Grow a tough skin quickly because you will fail over and over again and you will be taunted for it
---
Like Timothy Dalton's angry bond in a time people were used to Roger Moore paving the way angry Daniel Craig.
---
Seriously....when?!
---
you all should give the guy a break tbh. he's a good lad that is ready to help people, so what he sometimes can't take a joke or ignore criticism?
---
This has to be a bait right?
---
Xbox is terrible today. I‚Äôm 12 on both killer and survivor and I‚Äôm getting rank 20s on their first match ever all the time! I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs because DBD was added to the game pass.
---
I want the next killer to be Alex from a clockwork orange . I doubt it would work because the character didn‚Äôt really kill in the movie only by accident . He could use his cane sword and shite.
---
Only if his Mori is to saw a survivor in half then put them back together with flex seal.
---
There is no Mouse support for Dead by Daylight on Ps4 or Xbox, not without 3rd party accessories that convert mouse inputs into a controller input.
---
i wouldn't call him garbage, he just need smarter play.
---
We need shirtless Myers. We must never forget him
---
Oh, I would 100% run Technician if they changed it to that.  
---
I too am of the "Gen Jockey / Stealth" persuasion.... LOL  
---
Mostly cause I SUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK at being chased.  
---
I'm just terrible.
---
F13 players are starting to migrate over
---
I never said I wouldn't do it, I said it's not fun for anyone. Right now the game's ranking is fucked for a lot of people and I am sitting at rank 9, but usually I am at around rank 15 and whenever I play against a new killer I feel bad for looping them. I usually only loop for a little bit and let myself get caught, despite my teammates being shit and not doing gens. Only time I have fun with looping is when it's against some Huntress or Billy, it's fun to watch the Huntress ready her hatchet every time you get to the pallet, but you just keep running.
---
I see a Sprint Burst + Lithe there ?
---
He isn't completely garbage, he buys you a lot of time but its hard to actually down anyone.
---
Swf
---
Sorry, but I don't understand the joke, can someone explain me ?
---
He's not that garbage, he's better than some killers, but he's pretty boring to play, at least in my opinion.
---
They are fine if you know when to not use feral frenzy and M1 survivors. Keep the survivors injured so you have an easier time downing them. Nurses calling is a must.
---
Hell yeah, that's respectable.
---
I think he was full of crap. He was clearly messing with you and trying to be toxic. Then pretended he didn't know what he was doing to save face. He knows the hatch can be closed but doesn't know about keys? Ninja please.
---
Billy is cool, the rest... Not so much
---
They announced it on the stream so you could also just find it with a Google. Or you could search on the sub reddit. It's been answered many times already : c
---
If you survivors stopped genrushing maybe it wouldnt be required
---
yep, been a few weeks since they messed up minutes and seconds :D
---
I don‚Äôt quite understand what to do for Teachables, I don‚Äôt know what makes a playstyle toxic and I‚Äôm trying to learn how to get better at being a Killer (if you have any tips &amp; tricks for general playstyle minus toxicity, it‚Äôs appreciated). I mainly play as a Survivor or on the ‚Äúeasy difficulty‚Äù Killers.  I‚Äôm sorry that I wasn‚Äôt specific enough.
---

---
Thanks for giving me these tips, I'll be sure to keep them in mind!
---
I was just kidding lol
---
So what are Surviviors supposed to do to escape if they can't do gens? 
---
"Genrushing" is such an arbitrary statement that if so much as 1 Survivior is doing a gen, suddenly they're "genrushing"
---
And also plague and grabs from windows  of palents. And?? Try to main wraith at red rank and face 4 MoM
---
To INFINITY &amp; BEYOND perk. 
---
The moments where you wish you had a Ejection button, well now you do, this little baby will get you out of tight spots in a jiffy. 
---
Has a 60 second cool down timer, can activate while in chase only, can be used only 2 times. 
---
Carl‚Äôs ultra rare perk
---
‚ÄúNot getting stabbed in the head ever again!‚Äù Carl
---
Sadly no. I play on PC
---
That was one game. Second game goes the same except i get found instead of one of the noob. First game one of the noobs killed on first hook because they attempted escape straight away before i could even think about running over to help them.
---
Still though you have to admit the design is just bad. I get unhooked and chased, ds runs out soon and idk if I am gonna survive. Should I get downed and hope he picks me up or keep running. It‚Äôs a bad perk for its use. Great when killers just facecamp and tunnel though.
---
Feelsgoodman
---
As much as I hate going against swf if they're toxic I won't even do that lol. I'll gladly facecamp one though if I catch him teabagging non-stop and I know I ain't getting the rest that game
---
If it counted as catching them, it would play the catching animation. If the only factor that affects catching someone in a bear trap was someone being injured, any killer could complete it using m1
---
new guy here, why does it hurt so much?
---
I love doc so i think i'll like the new and improved Freddy too.
---
SWF is one of the main draws for players of this game. It's the reason I started playing - so I could play something with my friends. I know play almost entirely solo, but think it would be a terrible move to discourage people from playing together, as the player base would likely see a noticeable drop.
---
I'm not sure why SWF is such a problem - I go up against groups, and sure, it's more challenging, but every game shouldn't be easy. It's extremely rewarding when you win or even split a full SWF (even though a full SWF isn't all that common).
---
How did you survive that landing lol
---
just spend points on her. No need to play her. Thats how I got all my Clown perks.
---
My idea his main thing was traps, but he has add-ons that allow Him to place other objects like fake pallets, maybe fake lockers and totems. Kinda like doctor
---
Goddamnit, I am so happy that Freddy‚Äôs rework will actually make him viable at my skill level
---
Moris don't work if you can't hook somone.
---
This-
---
Step 3-7 are useless.
---
You can only cleanse totems to not get hit by it.
---
Noed is just too OP once its activates. With every other hex you can tacticly do something against it. With noed the killer does not only get one hits but also extra speed.
---
The best thing is when the survivor they tried to rat out comes up to the hook they are on and the two of you just start head bobbing in unison.
---
More often than not, they will just rage quit on the hook lol.
---
As you can see [here](https://github.com/jesterret/DBDPakTrack/blob/master/DeadByDaylight/Content/Blueprints/Perks/SurvivorPerks/PlunderersInstinct.uasset.cdo), it's not ;)
---
As a killer main I show my respect to those people by shoving them on a meat hook.
---
????????????????????????
---
I solo queue alot and this happens to me fairly often, I'm in red but everyone else is super random
---
And try to play green rank nurse with NOED and BBQ
---
300+ IQ
---
They should at the very least add something that shows who‚Äôs swf after the match ends because sometimes it‚Äôs really not swf even though it may seem like it is
---
In my experience, NOED didn't secure more than 1 kill or sometimes even that if survivors weren't brain dead, so yeah, it's incredibly OP.
---
Poor Trapper :'(
---
Pretty much. Yes. 
---
If  a tiger was tearing your leg off, you wouldn't ask it to chill until you decide you want it ripped off. You have to fight it.
---
You‚Äôre talking about my body lmao
---
Right? She looks nothing like Jane, and the "concept" has so little detail. Might as well have linked an image of a girl in a dress.
---
Then you havent met the slugging noed killers who also cant secure more than 1 kill....
---
Oh.
---
I‚Äôm largely a Survivor main, so my advice (though I know some would disagree) is to stop playing immersed. Yes, there‚Äôs some value in knowing how to play stealthily and stay away from the Killer. I‚Äôd argue that there‚Äôs much more value in knowing how to prolong a chase and distract the Killer. Playing stealthy is pretty boring on both sides IMO, and hiding from the Killer wastes about ten seconds while he searches the area for any Survivors. Learning to chase and loop could make time for your team to finish multiple generators, even all five if you‚Äôre good enough and at lower ranks.
---
Learn where pallets and windows are. You‚Äôll learn the maps more and more as you play, and this will help a lot. If you don‚Äôt know how to pallet loop... start learning. I‚Äôd recommend just watching some YouTubers or Twitch streamers play Survivor. This doesn‚Äôt have to be tutorial type of content, just watch them play. Most of the time, if you drop a pallet as soon as you get to it, you‚Äôre doing it wrong. There are so many pallets on a map, and you want to learn how to use them to your fullest before you drop them. Windows of Opportunity is a nice Perk to use while you‚Äôre learning, if you have it.
---
You pretty much just gotta practice and put yourself out there... You can be immersed and play stealthy if you want to, but ultimately, good looping is what sets good Survivors apart. Learn what loops are good to use and abuse, learn how to stay tight to the wall, learn how to use the Killer Shack effectively, learn what pallets are safe and unsafe. Again, some people may disagree, but being able to loop is the number one key to keeping you off of a hook as Survivor.
---
It's indeed the flashlight blind cancelling Feral Frenzy without fatigue. This is an intended interaction because otherwise, a survivor with a flashlight would be basically immune to Frenzy, being able to cancel it and force Legion into fatigue on every pallet or window vault, gaining enough distance to make it to a window or pallet again. Blinding an in-Frenzy Legion is still worth it, but in this situation obviously wasn't.
---
I STARTED the contribution, and you are hanging off of it.
---
Don't throw that shit at me when you are basically a conversational parasite. Sorry.
---
You don't barge into someone else's house and ask them to leave because they don't think you have anything to bring.
---
3% of games on PS4 are 4 man SWF. I think you need to come to the realization that not every loss you have is due to SWF.
---
Meg Mains Master Race. Great job!
---
Negative, there are only 5 totems on the map ever.  For each hex perk you have equipped as killer one of the five starts the match lit up and becomes a hex totem for the match.
---
yes but that's the real world where it'd be possible to do that
---
this is a video game, and I guarantee most people given the option would rather rest and let something else fight off the tiger than do it themselves
---
Then we squirt tears because 
---
&gt;trash killer noob perk kys uninstall bbkiller ez
---
yeah ok weird flex
---
I like the videos I've seen so far. Thanks for the recommendation!
---
Thank you :-)
---
Do you have any tips for huntress? Can't seem to land hatchets.
---
Haha, I can‚Äôt stop laughing
---
How did you find something this crazy?
---
Is there more stuff like this that isn‚Äôt specified in perks ? Thats new
---
What about Bill? Have you seen the shit he went through in L4D?
---
The entity shows mercy. Garfield does not.
---
Only if you have a key afaik
---
If you don‚Äôt want me to share it, it‚Äôs fine I understand I do
---
I asked myself the same thing
---
This happened to me too but I was the one being healed. It was like the survivor failed a skill check trying to heal me but it still worked and I was healed instantly. Killer found us tho which sucks. It was on the Game map btw so I don‚Äôt think location has anything to do with it. Could be the item was just bugged?
---
I don't have to do homework anymore. So no.
---
Lol Tier is humans who Killers with powers similar to demons Ash has fought
---
Nurse in Shotgun cause Ash fought a teleporting mind demon named Eligos.
---
Huntress and Clown in Shotgun cause of their Ranged advantages.
---
Freddy in Chainsaw cause he's a demon lol and he uses physical attacks rather than range.
---
Trapper would prob have a awesome fight with Ash before his death
---
Leatherface and Hillbillies placements need no explanation 
---
For Myers see Leatherface and Hillbillies Reason
---
If you would have placed anyone Lower or higher voice your reason in the comments!
---
Sounds like a typical brain dead Legion main.
---
Oh my...yes plz.
---
Yea and survivors make alot of noise when injured, whenever I get outsmarted as killer I'd hear them out of my peripheral from over 10m away and go down them.
---
you're not as funny as you think you are
---
Nah, I wouldn't have hooked her. Just doesn't seem right.
---
All of the killers would prob stand no chance against bill lol
---
Noed doesn‚Äôt activate on open gate thou, but on 5 Gens done/closed hatch. Gates are closed and you can‚Äôt leave
---
Congrats though! With no NOED, very impressive.
---
It‚Äôs called Yeet. When a generator I completed within 5 meters, you are yeeted to the moon to escape the killer‚Äôs detection.
---
Thats  some real lagg you got there...
---
He has long arms
---
The item (the ebony memento mori) lets you kill survivors yourself, this type lets you do it to all 4 as long as they've been hooked once.
---
Got a cat? Care to give some tips on smart traps? I either hear them triggered or they catch one survivor, if I'm lucky.
---
you see it looks cute as concept art but you know in game it's going to be atrociously ugly
---
Well wglf doesn't work anymore on unsafe unhooks, but i know that's besides the point. I would like to know then how do you punish the sandbagger? I think they should just give double bp for hitting and downing a survivor that has just unhooked another. However i still think slugging is a fine counterplay for ds
---
Running 3 perks until the very end of the game.
---
How is this a shitpost ? It's honest-to-god truth !
---
Eh, game's still pretty shit. It's hide-and-seek with guns. You need to play _so_ immersed in order to not get caught by the Hunter because 1 slip-up equals death. As Hunter it's comb grass until you bump into a Scavenger because nobody cares show their face around you, and hope you can actually hit them because the fuckers are so insanely mobile.
---
At least last time you had the chance to be rescued after a down.
---
In theory sounds great, however an efficient red/purple rank team will always have 2 people working on generators while you're trying to hook everyone. I'm not saying you should hard camp/tunnel the first guy you find, but when there's just 2 gens left you NEED to hurt their team somehow, and you're gonna regret having all 4 survivors on their first hook. I think it's about finding a "balance" if that makes sense. For this reason I never use green/red moris because I feel like it completely ignores the survivor's fun, but they should also understand when you purposely "tunnel" someone it's not personal (and you shouldn't do it as your go to strategy but as a last resort); sometimes you just need to hurt their team to have a chance at winning
---
Thank you for the clarification! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Gotta snatch that wig tho
---
Tier 4 Myres can throw his knife.
---
Aaaaaand that‚Äôs why you make sure you‚Äôre close enough to the exit to teabag lmao
---
So your suggestion for countering 1 survivor perk is to run 2 killer perks lol? Do you see the problem with this?
---
It doesn‚Äôt make sense, but it does, that leaves them confused ! Well played
---
Even the common ones can be good. Even if people dont step in them, it stops loops. Such as Killer shack or infinites. Other good places are outside of windows and near incomplete gens. And I do have cats and am obsessed with cat puns. I changed my autocorrect to do it
---
I just figured out a simple fix for the endless loading screen that I vaguely saw mentioned on here somewhere but never actually figured out how to do. Hope this helps someone - saves a lot more time vs. Task Managering out of the game :)
---
1. Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Change Adapter Settings
---
2. Select your current network connection (mine is Ethernet)
---
3. Right-click &gt; Disable
---
The game will kick you from the loading screen because there is no network connection available. Then just enable it again.
---
Happy fogging :)
---
Is it a one-off or permanent item?
---
Regardless of why he lost, it's just completely pathetic to trash talk the killer after losing when you have four times the perks, at a higher level, and the best item and addons when they have none, on top of many hundreds of hours of experience more than they do.
---
Matchmaking put a rank 5 survivor against a complete newbie on a level 1 killer, the killer won and the survivor calls him garbage? Well yes, I openly admit I am bad. What's his excuse?
---
Yes you can, you check the friendslist or if they have the same name, thought I was clear on that.
---
Ola! Join our freshly made Facebook-Group: Deathgarden: Bloodharvest! And may the odds be ever in your favor!
---
Tier 1 is scarier
---
Just makes it look like Meg tripped lol.
---
It lasts for 60 seconds though doesn't it? Running a killer for 60 seconds, while injured, isn't a total loss.
---
Bruh he's going to lose subscribers
---
This made my day. Thank you so much for posting this
---
I found these in the game files, they have nifty little folders for each of the perk icons
---
This is Chopped, a cooking show on the food network
---
How is rank 1 indication of console? We have rank 1 on pc
---
I don‚Äôt think he will
---
On the beads or spirit in general? Because spirit didn't get buff, I said she was scary because of her face in the pic.
---
Holy moly that felt good
---
Then we really do need a casual mode.
---
Shack/infinite/loop traps only deny the current chase's current loop, slow me down, and are disarmed before I hook them.
---
*Near* gens gets me 1 in every 6 games. Outside windows means disarmed.
---
You have the best autocatrect.
---
Umm.. No you
---
its not often someone running sloppy noed and ruin is praised on reddit for anything XD
---
alright, thank you kindly, mister.
---
Public Beta environment
---
Ugh I think I have PTSD from yesterday. I bought a pink insta heal (almost never use them) and this David in the game was getting tunnelled hard, but he was decent at looping and although he was on last hook, there was one gen left. He went down at shack pallet and I insta healed him and took a hit, except before he even realised I'd insta healed him he just dc'ed because it was his last hook. 
---
Thanks for making me waste my insta heal David!
---
Id reccomend right clicking the game in steam -&gt; properties and run "verify integrity of game files". Usually fixes weird matchmaking bugs for me.
---
Should‚Äôve put Ghostface as the new guy lol
---
Haha they're pretty much the only perks I have, hags only at level 14
---
2 gates. one person gets downed with noed. the others should be near the gate to start opening it while the other gets carried and hooked.
---
and if the hatch was closed without open gates, it means there's only one person left and the survivors failed already. NOED only works if the killer hits you, and if you're the last person, he can hit you twice easy enough. you cant open the gate with the killer on you, so NOED merely shortens a game you already lost.
---
In-Phase collision should be removed, plain and simple.
---
I would've never even thought of that! :0
---
\*crying in Spirit\*
---
or killer should just have to 4k like they used to.... making it worse for everyone is a horrible idea.
---
Story of my life whenever I play survivor lately, then just see 3 green blobs crouched and slow walking towards me from every direction.
---
Legions power lets him to stab one person, and it shows him nearby people that haven't been bled out by his power. Which, doesn't matter honestly. As most good players are long gone. Forcing him to 
---
A) Wait his power out, become exhausted for a few seconds, and then chase someone. Taking forever I might add.
---
B) Go in to stab the same person again. Completely making his power useless. As it deactivates it, and just downs them. Making his bleedout useless.
---
C) Stab one person, then run halfway across the map. A Majority of the time, him never reaching anyone before his stamina is gone and he's stuck in the middle of nowhere with no power, and nothing really to show for it except 1 player mending themselves and him having no way to find anyone now.
---
On the Freddy side, it doesn't mean Freddy is useless. It's just that he's playing with a handicap. And in a meta where 5 Blink nurse, and "I AM THE MAP" Billy are everywhere. He just can't keep up.
---
On the other hand. I've seen some REALLY creative Freddies. There's a perk called "Insidious" that does some really cool stuff with Freddy specifically. Basically, when you have Insidious, standing still for a couple seconds completely hides your terror radius until you move again. While this isn't really useful on many killers outside of a Basement camping Bubba, it does something really cool with Freddy. 
---
Since if you're outside of his terror radius and asleep, he can see you. That's just how his power works. If he stands still and activates Insidious, his terror radius is 0. So, if you're asleep, he can see you. Anywhere on the map.
---
I‚Äôve taken on 4 man SWF before, on a bad day I‚Äôll just release that offering that should not see the light of day 
---
But any other time, beating an SWF really requires you to study their play style and counter it. If I notice they‚Äôre really altruistic I‚Äôll guard hooks more aggressively, alternatively if they hold out on saves I‚Äôll roam generators and apply pressure. Mad grit and Franklin‚Äôs demise are my go to perks for battling SWF, mad grit against super altruistic survivors is brutal, and Franklin‚Äôs will easily shut down attempts to insta-heal mid chase
---
hiT bOxEs aREn'T bRoKen
---
i feel like bashing my skull into a wall trying to do adept freddy
---
I'm in rank 10(survivor), and am constantly watching people step on traps near gens. I'm on console though, so maybe that has something to do with it
---
I went against a cocky SWF group all running flashlights and all over me once.  
---
They were literally healing folks on the ground right in front of me.  
---
So I started slugging and just downing, not hooking, and moving the group towards the basement, letting them sort of heal a bit before downing again.  
---
Eventually, I had 3 of them in the basement, and one on the ground.  
---
4k cause they were so cocky.  
---
Sometimes, you have to play their strengths against them and let them hang themselves.
---
This list assumes Michael Myers is stronger than Freddy, blasphemous
---
I dont like the guy but honestly these posts are just fucking depressing and borderline witchhunting. I legit dont understand what the point of these posts is.
---
No Mither Self Care is better
---
For Billy I'd go doom engravings, CTG, moonshine, and primer bulb
---
You are supposed to be able to hit through windows
---
\s
---
Huntress, billy, plague, bubba, Mikey.

Please devs, we need it
---
Coconut head couldn‚Äôt take the bullying anymore... and one day he snapped, and made his own rules to survive middle school
---
I want to upvote this 100 more times. ):
---
I also play League, they call it that way. DBD calls it PTB
---
yeah like a day after this i realized i have no reason to care about it so i just accepted
---
Y that might be true. He might even laggswitched :/ dedicated servers should solve it! Cant w8 :)
---
They should just change it back to 4K. I would rather make the achievement fair again then make all Adept achievements unbearably frustrating. 
---
Honestly posts like this need to get more attention. The Adept Killer achievements are aneurysm inducing now and I'm really hoping the devs see them.
---
Broken as in it doesn‚Äôt work not overpowered.
---
At first I thought that was me because I went against this Myers earlier and I wear that same outfit (on Xbox) but then I realized none of us even made it to endgame
---
I don't dislike any of those. I kinda suck with Huntress as I'm on Xbox, and Bubba seems a bit boring to me (which is good for when I'm just trying to mess around in a casual game but most of the time I prefer others)
---
Why don't you like the ones I chose, just curious? Any particular reason you dislike, for example, Hag?
---
But that comic is non canon.
---
Please tell me this is fake. 30 quid for what I can get on steam for 7.50
---
Watch it be in the battle pass so that people will want to buy the paid track.
---
I  faced a wraith once who pounded my teammates for not saving me off the hook before I got to struggle and hiding in lockers and not doing anything. The after game chat was hilarious. I faced him again and he  hooked us all three times each, never camped, never tunneled. He was one of my favorite games. He was a fun wraith.
---
This and wiggling
---
Gods have no place in DBD...the sheer thought of Phil being the killer is enough to crash the servers indefinitely. All it takes is hearing ‚ÄúITS PHIL HERE!‚Äù From the fog and men will break down in tears from the genuine fear that the Man called Phil Swift wields the power of the gods up above and is now heading in your direction to saw u in half
---
Maximum Entitlement.
---
YOu just have to look for those in-game and in DBD. It is not that hard, you could also press CTRL+F and highlight certain names.
---
What if distance traveled with the chainsaw increases the cooldown time?
---
No-one who knows what they're talking about is aying MoM *itself* is OP. The problem with MoM is its synergy with itself and other top-tier Survivor perks.
---
One person running MoM without any other good perks is not a problem. 3-4 MoMs? Supported by insta-heals, exhaustion perks, Borrowed Times, Adrenalines and/D-Strikes?
---
That is damn-near unbeatable.
---
I‚Äôve had this in a couple of matches recently. 
---
Someone standing still upstairs in Haddonfield, he wasn‚Äôt moving like he was letting me hit him and I was literally touching him when I quick swung and hit nothing. 
---
He realised and suddenly wanted to live and jumped out the window lol
---
Really weird though, like there‚Äôs no hit box there. 
---
I thought it was just me or a bad game etc but it was very strange.
---
They are not that bad, but they get boring rather quickly. since they are pretty much a m1 killer all the time, even with feral frenzy you just become a faster M1 killer.
---
i have an easier time playing as the wraith then i do playing as huntress or hillbilly personally
---
He outplayed you with his high skill gameplay.
---
Throw in a few XD next time to mix your emojis game and double the epicness!
---
what year is it
---
First, he dindt do this to karmafarm, he posted this cause people like you exist.
---
Second, you are being totally salty, and DC isnt a good thing at all.
---
Third, you did dodge a poor guy trying to get his achievement by being a absolute asshole, thst doesnt mean the killer was right by bodyblocking, either.
---
Fourth, even if people dont agree with OP, what that will change on OP's opinion?
---
R/dbdgonegay is calling
---
He gets more players playing the game. More more players leads to more lobbies. More lobbies leads to people not quitting because they can't play the game. 
---
Being able to actually play the game at any time will make people feeling like spending money.
---
I‚Äôve learned that you can tell if it‚Äôs HG or not by how hard the killer patrols the totem. If you‚Äôve never seen them even think once about walking over to the totem, it‚Äôs HG. If they patrol it every once and a while, it‚Äôs thrill of the hunt or devour hope. If they hard patrol it, it‚Äôs ruin.
---
U see, during pride this IS dbdgonegay..... happy pride
---
Nurse at least takes skill, MoM does not.
---
Can people stop with sexualizing this game in this subreddit? There‚Äôs a sub for that already r/dbdgonewild
---
Some people just don‚Äôt wanna see this shit you know? Go be proud in a more fitting place, stop trying to be everywhere (Not you, referring to the LGBT community)
---
This isn‚Äôt intended to be homophobic, I‚Äôm just tired of Lgbt community trying to be everywhere and get people‚Äôs attention, just fucking stop.
---
As a nurse player, i wouldn't remove the range addons, as you must develop a pretty good muscle memory for how far your blink will go. The first few times you run those addons you will overcharge your blink 75% of the time.
---
The only addons i would remove are the extra blinks (Torn Bookmark, Fragile Wheeze and Campbell's). You can use a nurse's extra range against her, but you can't juke a 5 blink nurse if she has half a brain cell.
---
To some I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs mostly rage.
---
I try not to. I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôve done some really stupid things as a survivor and just quit with out thinking , but yesterday I had something happen and I couldn‚Äôt stomach it.
---
I was in a killer match as the plague and was trying for adept, when suddenly a SWF group of 3 P3 Claudette‚Äôs join and all of them used the fog thickening regent. Each and every one of them had urban evasion , and to make matters worse, I had corn everywhere. 
---
I managed to hit everyone and hook the ash, but the Claudette constantly kept getting away. It was immature of me but I just saw them in discord laughing about what a good job they were doing and how many points they were going to get against this baby killer and I just disconnected. 
---
 Yeah no I‚Äôd take a soft ban for that one with zero regrets, but I digress , there isn‚Äôt much punishment for rage quits and de pipping is no big deal so I guess that‚Äôs the reason? Everyone has there reasons.
---
If reddit told you Prove Thyself is a good perk (which not few here do seem to think), that indeed has to be contradicted: Prove Thyself is negligible to an extent of basically being useless.
---
Survivors suffer a 10% action speed debuff when working on a generator together, for every survivor (so 10% for two, 20% for three, and 30% for four). That's around 8.8 extra seconds when working with two people - but since you are working with two people, those 8.8s have to be halved. So that's 4.4 seconds that you save with Prove Thyself, and only if you are duoing a gen. That's awful. With three survivors, the debuff increases to 20%, leading to 20 extra seconds - split by three, meaning 6.6 seconds. But you do not even shave the entire 6.6s off with PT, since it only increases repair speed by 10%; it leaves a 10% debuff for every survivor, which is again 8.8 seconds - split by three, around 3 seconds, or a saving of a whole 3.6 seconds. With 4 survivors, 30% debuff, 8.5 extra seconds; after PT 20% debuff, 5 extra seconds - a time saving of 3.5 seconds.
---
Cooping generators is not often a time-efficient tactic even if it didn't come with inherent speed debuffs (and even if you did consistently find yourself 2/3/4-working entire gens, which is not regularly the case), and certainly, Prove Thyself's numbers do not change anything about that - it doesn't even completely counteract the inherent speed debuffs, which are minor to begin with (again: 4.4, 6.6 and 8.5 seconds, respectively).

Don‚Äôt forget if you hit them with a legion frenzy attack and down them while they still have deep wound applied MoM won‚Äôt activate
---
Since they removed hatch grab it seems that killer closing it takes priority over jumping in afaik
---
I'd like every Survivior and killer perk to be good, technician I've always felt is too RNG focused and situational to be good. If Surviviors had perks that blocked anti stealth perks that killers had, it'd open up more avenues for stealthy gameplay, which would overall be a strong nerf to the top tier killers who are absurdly weak to stealth based gameplay (but bc of how weak and unincentivized stealth is as a mechanic, it doesn't matter)
---
*snags survivor off generator*
---
#HI SISTERS
---
Well wtf are they supposed to do?
---
Yes, it's fake. It's why I marked this as a "shitpost".
---
I wish I saved a clip of it but I had a dude teabagging me and using the flashlight to try and taunt me. I managed to hook his friend, hit the teabagger with a throwing hatchet, and then when I went to chase him he vaulted a pallet, started teabagging and caught a second hatchet to the back. Left him there for a sec while I busted a generator and then picked him up and tossed him on the hook.
---
I think the other whovian explained it pretty well already hahahaha
---
Sure, but BHVR already has to do asset work on the survivor skeleton for every mori they add, so it‚Äôs not like this is completely out of the question
---
Lovely Karma &lt;3
---
[SPOILER WARNING]
---
This is an edit. Not an actual thing. It's tagged as a shitpost, not as a "discussion".
---
That is intended to only happen the first time you play against a specific killer, though the spaghetti code of this game means that isn't always the case.
---
C'mon... give me *something* here, man. If you're going to troll, put at least *some* effort in to make me feel like I'm worth it. :'c
---
I once facecamped someone who pointed at a locker with a teammate inside. Fuck people who do that. They might have been in SWF goofing around but from my perspective they were ratting out a teammate.
---
The thing is though, either way, you're gonna get shit on.
---
But, as a survivor, forcing a killer to DC is 10x more reason for ridicule than a "baby killer" trying and failing.
---
Sometimes you're gonna face groups way better.
---
No reason to give them more reason to laugh at you, and at the same time give away all your points.
---
It's like giving them a win twice. Even three times.
---
This isn't the same thing though. dbdgonewild is for porn.
---
Well...I hate to break it to you, but it is kinda homophobic. No where did I mention my work would be nsfw. No where did I mention sex. I was gonna draw Meg and Nea holding hands, or susie wearing a Bisexual flag tee-shirt.
---
As a bi person, it is extremely hurtful to see that I can‚Äôt celebrate in a community I am comfortable in, and also told to go to a nsfw place to post my sfw fanart just because they mention LGBT pride. 
---
My uncle took his life when I was younger because of being told he was overtly sexual due to being bisexual, so seeing that I should ‚Äúcelebrate‚Äù somewhere else is damaging. Allow LGBT to celebrate, especially during Pride month. 
---
Please.

---
Oh my god. It didn't show the flair and it scared the shit out of me. I'm so relieved
---
So only one side is allowed to do wrong and airing your grievances about it is apparently not okay. 
---
Got it
---
I agree with you on that too, but the issue is that the experience gets damaged for newer players who go up against campers. The biggest problem is just that it *isn't fun* to go up against a camper, and while we can talk all day about how it isn't efficient or how campers will derank the final truth is that nothing is going to make a new player quit faster than being found first by Leatherface and having said Leatherface stand in front of them with their chainsaw revved.
---
I would also say that camping is very unfun for the Killer as well but if that was truly the case then people wouldn't do it. I'd maybe say that there should be less reason to camp in the end game (bad example: make hooks progress faster when the End Game Collapse is happening?) but that's really not a "push this button to fix it" issue either.
---
Basically this game isn't perfect, no game is, but it also isn't easy to fix some of the big problems with this game. There's a constant balance between adding mechanics/perks to counter unfun mechanics and those mechanics/perks being too strong. (Again I will mention Borrowed Time.) I'm sure Behavior has spent a long time thinking of ways to counter camping more directly and they couldn't think of any better ideas than I could've.
---
Survivors still hear it when it‚Äôs been closed. I don‚Äôt think killers do, though.
---
How in the fucks name is this positivity? You answered bantz with bantz then went the penguin of doom xdd im so random!! route
---
This is beyond cringe my dude
---
How much is it gonna cost?
---
Thank you oh my gosh.
---
I don‚Äôt have an adapter I just plug my keyboard into my Xbox‚Äôs usb and it works but the mouse doesn‚Äôt
---
Also you main a trap
---
cause you did a really dick move as kate
---
Ah okay thanks for clearing that up !
---
No time for pride there are stabbers on the loose!
---
I only leave if I lag to where I bounce back and forth. Other than that I just die with grace.
---
Yeah, you‚Äôre right about the extra blinks. Idk what they should do to the distance, I just wish nurse couldn‚Äôt blink from gen to gen without that much warning and then be able to bbq anyone down from across the map.
---
Always time for pride! :D we can run and be proud!
---
Billy. Ruin(hag) pop goes the weasel(clown) tinkerer and enduring are a solid choice of perks.
---
Primer bulb and carberator tuning guide makes the saw into instasaw so you can possibly sneak em on people trying to loop you.
---
For your offering most of the time its just bloodpoint increases. If youre not feeling all that confident in your upcomming game throw an ivory on there and just take care of one of em right off the bat. 
---
Being a new killer is a pain. You gotta farm and farm and farm to get other killers levels up so you can unlock their perks for other killers to use if you get the plague unlock her perk that cuts off 3 gens from the survivors its absurdly good if you dont want the recovery of enduring. 
---
If you want fun perk ideas id suggest looking up monto and his meme builds like drift king billy(handling attachments for chainsaw)
---
If you come across a toxic group of survivors and they clap you dont give up. If you come across them again give them the fucking ebony Moro
---
Because whiny crybaby survivors give me Strength 
---
Keep up the hunt mr thompson
---
Not saying you are wrong because you ain‚Äôt , but In my current frame of mind I saw it as a waste of my time, I only had so many games left before I had to crash for the night and opted to step out. Besides I also knew for a fact if I caught any of them I would not move. I‚Äôd face camp them to eternity and that is just something I hate to do. Shows they got to you just as much as a dc , but rage doesn‚Äôt always make sense right?
---
athompsona lot of games you might just run vegetable oil and Spark plugs because the other attackments are a pain to get at times.
---
Pride leads to overconfidence and that leads to getting stabbed and i take no pride in stab wounds
---
I like it too
---
Eh. It's about feelings, not logic. That's why people DC.
---
Play both sides, it will make you better at the other side. 
---
Try and treat people how you would like to be treated yourself. 
---
If someone does something you find ‚Äòtoxic‚Äô just don‚Äôt do it to to other people. 
---
Don‚Äôt take anger from a previous game into the next game and try to ‚Äòpunish‚Äô players for something they didn‚Äôt do.
---
Noted. Take pride in ur sexuality/gender AFTER escaping the trial. This has been a PSA!
---
On Spirit, *avoid* using Stridor‚Äîit messes with your sense of distance when phasing after an injured survivor. 
---
As for the pallet juke: remember, they can‚Äôt hear you phasing while inside your TR; if you just stand there staring at them, not phasing yet, they‚Äôll do one of the aforementioned.
---
No, I get it. I really do. I've wanted to throw my controller through the wall at times with some of these killers or swf groups.
---
Just have to remember.... The bigger waste of time is always walking away with nothing, rather than a little.
---
I agree.
---
Indeed
---
Was anyone sexualizing anything in this post? No. I'm sorry that the LGBT community makes you so uptight. No one is trying to get attention by saying "Happy pride!" How about you go be a douche in a more fitting place.
---
Get the politics out of here please. Happy month and all that shit but please stop.
---
It is the year 2374 A.D., may our serpentine Overlords forever prosper.
---
There is no map
---
What in the flying fuck happened
---
Hey, you're entitled to your opinion :-)
---
I agree there's too many niche perks out here. Seeing stealth being completely demolished makes room for only perks that are good for taking a lot of the aggro.
---
Where do you see politics?
---
Wilfred!! D:
---
What is political about me being happy about my sexuality? Like I don‚Äôt see anyone saying get politics out of here on straight fanart and whatever lol
---
*peeks around Corner*
---
*Inhales loudly*
---
*Performs emote*
---
"WAZZZZUUUUUUUUUUUUP"
---
He can already T-bag like a survivor. Let him do this while standing, crouching and, most importantly, learning around corners.
---
Waving at a survivor that sees you a little too late after you mark them would just be icing on the cake.
---
Which is why perks like MoM are as prevalent. If getting caught by the killer was harder, but more punishing, I don't think it'd be as strong
---
The Tokyo subway look is really cute so have faith
---
Killers dcing can effect survivors.  A killer DC'd as soon as i exited the gate and I didn't get my escape points yet I got a pip and the iridescent unbroken emblem. 
---
I don't give a shit about ranking up. I just want my bp üò£.
---
And I‚Äî oop!
---
Pretty sure Cahlaflour is not her real name...
---
My eyes had been playing tricks on me last night.
---
True again but in my mind them getting a full game and getting more points for evasion and gen completion , yeah no just thinking about it irritates me to no ends lol. I‚Äôve had some games as a survivor where once everyone has left I find the killer and point to a hook so they can at least get one kill, because it felt like they were bullied to no ends and always tell them I respect the fact they didn‚Äôt dc. 
---
I‚Äôve had a few games I wanted to snap my keyboard but I stuck it out , specially since a friend I recently started playing with rages four times harder than I do so I got to experience that on a receiving end, so that helped me mellow out a touch.
---
Yep, considering he gets exposed from it,
---
i'm still upset that you used self-care instead of healing with that fine med-kit
---
Agreed!
---
It‚Äôs particularly frustrating on console where it wrenches the camera to 3 different angles and you have to tap X with your right hand and reach the right stick with your left hand to rotate the camera and check auras etc while trying to keep that rhythm and not fumble the controller :‚Äô)
---
Sorry, I have astigmatism.
---
Well I thought you meant porn when u said ‚Äúlgbt fanart‚Äù lol
---
Yeah, that's like the only negative affect, that and the offering. 
---
But that's my point - I'm NOT leaving without my BPs I earned, I don't care how toxic you are. I'm not leaving empty handed.
---
That goes to show the over-sexualization of LGBT  people. Next time, don‚Äôt jump to conclusions, as they can be hurtful.
---
You seem way more uptight
---
Facecampers sure would enjoy a head tilt animation.
---
Repost from other thread but
---
Tried Spirit for the second time ever. Rank 15, level 1, only one perk. Somehow manage a 4k.
---
So this rank 5 Claudette with god flashlight and meta build calls me a garbage killer.
---
And says I only got a 4k because his "team was garbage".
---
And he was paired with rank 15+ survivors because of SWF.
---
So yeah, just calling his friends garbage and a killer garbage because he joined a newbie-level game with friends and didn't win.
---
I'm really starting to think Claudettes are the absolute worst.
---
Myers hitbox is almost as big as his dick
---
It may be more, dont know the exact number. You get it at level 35.
---
Killer emotes would be pretty funny
---
Yes, because I get online and complain about someone saying "Happy pride."
---
This is really odd, a long time ago when Legion was released someone made a video taking an ebony mori and playing legion and they got Haddonfield and got stuck on a window too!
---
lgbt people exist. We make up a significant portion of the player base. Our existence is not political.
---
I agree with that ambush buff idea. The Pig won't be rewarded free kills with my suggestion though because they don't work after the gates have been opened. Also, it is not your business to say what the traps are for. Why can't it have multiple uses? Why does it only have to be "built in Ruin"? It is more interesting to have different Pig strategies instead of the same old gameplay every time.
---
Ochido? Ew
---
Inb4 ghostface not scream dlc pepehands
---
Sweaty nurse lol I love it
---
That is definitely lag switching which is cheating
---
I think you missed the legion update bandwagon. I don't see whats wrong with playing Legion atm... unpopular opinion but it would be cool if he got some QOL changes.
---
Pretty much anything they make will be more fun than playing against Billy or Nurse.
---
I play against Spirits at rank 1 and the only streamer I'll sometimes watch is tru3ta1ent when I want to laugh at someone. No, tru3 would not be spouting what I said BTW.
---
Repetitve Strain Injury.
---
Mashing a button can cause this. It's pretty bad.
---
But she‚Äôs Chinese
---
I think killers would love it if they felt they could play a bigger variety of killers at high rank
---
Probably spirit. If you like high skill, high reward killers then you should pick her. She's the 2/3rd best killer in the game, flip flopping with Billy. Her design and skins are really cool too and her perks are amazing
---
She's also thicc but that's besides the point
---
Same dood
---
I‚Äôd like to take this moment to thank the random hero Jake last night who saved me while the killer chased me while all 5 generators were repaired. He saved me with a flashlight twice, instahealed me when I went down a third time and took the heat at the end, so I could open a door for us both to escape.
---
I like being toxic to killers so I do this all the time xd
---
I‚Äôm aware but her cosmetic line i‚Äôm talking about is called I heart 80s Tokyo subway lol
---
But thats battlefield
---
I'll admit it: I straight up D/C'd on them as they snatched me off a Jigsaw box. I wasn't about to give someone that scummy more points. I hope they depipped.
---
I've played Pig before. I've whacked a person or two on a box. But I always slug and let them finish up whenever they get up. On the rare occasions I've actually gotten a RBT kill I feel like the surv majorly screwed up.
---
I guess it's true what they say. Ranks 5-10 are just rife with scumbags.
---
Definitely. Pig probably needs a sweeping rework like the Hag and Trapper got especially because of her poopy add-ons.
---
Yea don‚Äôt listen to him.  NOED is fine on M1 killers, like hag for example
---
I was going for adept adam the other day and i used deliverance to get off the hook and make it to the exit, but RIGHT before I crossed the line to escape the killer DC'd so it didn't count.
---
You realize the over-sexualization is justified tho right? The loudest voices in your community are representing you, and more often than not, they‚Äôre fucked up people and you know it. Please don‚Äôt make yourself look foolish and disagree with this statement because as much as you want to deny it, it is a fact.
---
Best booty of the game besides jane
---
Wow, the homophobia really jumped out didn‚Äôt it. Why are you harassing me on a post that is meant to spread positivity?
---
Risk what? Im downing the guy that gets unhooked in front of my face too (unless he has bt) to deny wglf stack and free bp tp the unhooker.
---
Meh.
---
Alright I‚Äôm done here. ‚ÄúHarassing me‚Äù God I hope you realize one day how stupid you sound. Jesus christ this is why I stay away from Tumblr people.
---
This is cringe
---
&gt;I‚Äôm just tired of Lgbt community trying to be everywhere and get people‚Äôs attention, just fucking stop.
---
You have to understand that all this ‚Äúvisibility‚Äù is a pushback against all the discrimination that the LGBT community faces.
---
In a better world, if people didn‚Äôt mind the LGBT community and left them alone, they wouldn‚Äôt be so vocal. There would be no point to pride month, because it‚Äôs the norm.
---
Straight = Normal.
---
I prefer the word: **irate**. It's just more fun to call someone that.
---
Buddy, I regret to inform you, that is homophobia.
---
No offense, but are you upset because a killer didn‚Äôt follow your same mercy rule? That‚Äôs bad gaming etiquette.
---
They will though, with how inconsistently this occurs it can't be a hitbox issue, otherwise it would happen *every* time at a window vault instead of just 1/5 times.
---
Livin like barry
---
I had someone quit immediately after downing me so his friend could use the hatch
---
Bp and having fun is all i care about. I'm learning Nurse on Ps4 and have had to deal with a lot of survivors who run in circles around me and tbag and shit. If I DC'd that's just giving them what they want.
---
Survivor:
---
Ace In The Hole (rather, some item add-ons are basically useless, and those should be buffed), Alert, Autodidact, Boil Over, Breakdown, Buckle Up, Calm Spirit, Dark Sense, D√©j√† Vu, Detective's Hunch, Distortion, Diversion, Flip-Flop, Head On, Leader, Left Behind, Lightweight, No One Left Behind, Open-Handed, Poised, Premonition, Prove Thyself, Resilience, Saboteur, Sole Survivor, Solidarity, Stake Out, Streetwise, This Is Not Happening, Technician, Tenacity, Up The Ante (rather, the "luck" mechanic should do more actual things in the game), Vigil, Wake Up!, We're Gonna Live Forever, Windows Of Opportunity.
---
Killer:
---
Beast Of Prey, Bitter Murmur, Bloodhound, Blood Warden, Corrupt Intervention, Coulrophobia, Dark Devotion, Distressing, Dying Light, Fire Up, Hangman's Trick, Hex: Huntress Lullaby, Hex: Thrill Of The Hunt, Infectious Fright, Iron Grasp, Iron Maiden, Knock Out, Lightborn, Mad Grit, Monstrous Shrine, Overcharge, Overwhelming Presence, Play With Your Food, Predator, Remember Me, Shadowborn, Spies From The Shadows, Stridor, Surveillance, Territorial Imperative, Tinkerer, Thanatophobia, Unrelenting
---
Mind you, these are just the perks in need of substantial, direct buffs - there are more that could (should) be adjusted up or down, or reworked more fundamentally. Ideally, I would want most of all perks to be highly viable, powerful and impactful enough to regularly see play.
---
I love this.
---
Neat, didn‚Äôt know that.
---
Tbh here I don't dodge, but when i have a feeling things get bad I start to regret or rather feel embarrassed because lots of them tbag at pallet chokes and I'm unable to reach them. Not to mention it gets worse when they message me and accuse me of wall hacks and stupid excuses and I have to try and ignore it.
---
Exactly my point, tho. Why can‚Äôt they just be normal and act human? No one in the Western world gives a fuck if you‚Äôre gay or not and won‚Äôt harm you for it. But by being such attention-whores and trying to push your agenda EVERYWHERE, you‚Äôre only making enemies.
---
Just stop trying to be special because you like the same sex, just be human god damn
---
I don't celebrate being straight. So why should anyone else give a shit what you are? Homophobic? I couldn't give another shit if I tried.
---
&gt;If you had to choose a perk to describe your sex life, what would it be?
---
&gt;Mine is Quick and Quiet.
---
Breh. It‚Äôs always the homophobic ones that can‚Äôt get laid.
---
Angry that gay people are happier than you lmao.
---
People are being killed for being lgbt so like maybe that.
---
You are so right!!!!
---
Nurse takes some skill, and Ive never said nurse is balanced.
---
‚ÄúBuT tHe KiLlEr ShOuLd Be AbLe To SwInG tHrOuGh A wInDoW‚Äù
---
This looks really good, although his face could have a *little* more colour. Other than that, fantastic work
---
I don‚Äôt even use ruin on spirit cause I know how much I hate when i play survivor and the killer has ruin. I still do pretty good with her though! I‚Äôd say BBQ and Nurses are essential, though you could maybe get away without using nurses
---
Play Doc. They can't hide, when they scream &gt;:D
---
I will only ever camp if the survivor has been a dick to others. If i'm chasing you and you decide to unhook someone mid-chase, i'm not going to switch focus, i'm going after you for trying to farm that guy.
---
Im married lol. Good try though. Have fun putting weiners in your anus.
---
Theres the politics.
---
some people just mind-game them self instead of committing to the chase
---
Can you use the keyboard to play dbd? cause this is not officialy supported
---
Insert Freddy face camping and subsequent tunneling. Yeah I'm annoyed.
---
They nerf Remember Me but not Noed. ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶
---
What if I play Wraith and all the totems are cleansed? Haunted Grounds doesn't last forever and chase points eventually max out
---
lmao no it's not it's terrorist hunt on defend the hostage.
---
Theirs a special place in heaven for you &lt;3
---
But that‚Äôs not your point tho. Fuck that.
---
They are human and they are acting normal.
---
The abnormal one is you for caring so much about what other individuals do in their bedrooms. The Western World with its Christian values gives a fuck about what gay people do and won‚Äôt leave us the fuck alone. And yes, the Western World does harm gay individuals. Maybe not to the extent that other religious countries do, but don‚Äôt act as if a gay individual has the same privileges as a heterosexual. Because we don‚Äôt, and it‚Äôs an objective truth that we do not. 
---
&gt;just be human god damn
---
Take your own fucking advice.
---
I have faced so much homophobia in my life it isn‚Äôt funny. My uncle committed suicide because of homophobia. One of my best friends got kicked out of her house at 16 because she had a girlfriend. Pride is met with protests with people saying we should burn in hell. Our ‚Äúagenda‚Äù is equal rights.

What map?
---
Y'know, it used to bug me at first too, but I got used to it and now actually like styles where eyes go over the hair.
---
That‚Äôs not the girl filter though.
---
Oh sorry, did they put voice comms in the game?
---
This is the stupidest thing I've heard in a week. Go somewhere else. ( i bet you vote for trump )
---
Friendship ended with GHOSTFACE. Now CASHIER CARL is my best friend.
---
I thought their would of been a map like in the trailer
---
Everyone can play how they want but isn't this what Salt/Rants are for? To put the community on blast when you want to?
---
Tunneling a RBT just seems low-skill and cheap IMO
---
You seem really upset over a discussion that was held 11 days ago lmao
---
For Remember Me, you actually had to work for it whereas you get No One Escapes Death for free.
---
He also does it at essentially the same speed as survivors and therefore becomes ridiculously easy to loop
---
I‚Äôm just saying, that tunneling and all that isn‚Äôt exactly fun to fight, but it‚Äôs a valid strategy as well. Cheap? Yeah, totally. But completely valid.
---
&gt; I straight up D/C'd on them
---
So you fucked over your team and rewarded the killer.
---
bring a ebony mori
---
But you realize I DONT CARE what happens in the bedroom right? My whole point is that YOU need to stop thinking you‚Äôre special and be NORMAL. But nah, you cannot accept it, because you WANT to be treated differently. So stfu and stop taking words out of my mouth and making me look like the villain, I only care when you guys pop up everywhere with your immature little pride, yea good for you! You like having gay sex! Should I also march because I love eating pussy? Nah, so stop trying to be different when you‚Äôre just human like the rest of us. Done.
---
I personally feel like they need to do something to rebalance the way it works so that ruin isn't such a vital part in slowing down matches. It doesn't really make much sense for a single perk to be such a pivotal thing for something so universal in my opinion.
---
I'd be happy to see a more standardized killer feature that can effectively slow down matches and then maybe a nerf to ruin.
---
ghostface getting back at all those survivors who squatted at his friends the past three years
---
Dumbler*
---
I‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôs creepier like this or not
---
Well, excuse me for even suggesting anything on this stupid subreddit.
---
So you admittedly disconnect against a killer playing very poorly and make an unfunny meme blasting an anonymous player who happened to have a bad game? I guess there is a lot of scumbags in your rank
---
I think hes a tad bit special dont worry
---
confused boner
---
The Drawback is the fact you only have 3 perks for the match, And the fact it can be negated. The fact you're too lazy to even attempt to negate it dosent mean it's not a drawback.
---
YOu CAn saY wHaTeVER You WANT, but hitboxes are actually fine
---
From the devs, less than a month ago:
---
&gt;One of the most reported issue on the game now is the way the game handles hit registration and hitboxes. We investigated to find what was the cause of this issue and we found that the main culprit was different instances of desynchronization. Desynchronization can be caused by input lag, animation issues, registration issues as well as user lag. This is the core of this issue and migrating to dedicated servers will give us the tools to handle hit registration better. 
---
&gt;Being hit through the window is by design. A window is an opened element and killers should be able to reach through it. Players suffering from desynchronization issues will have the feeling that they are getting hit through the window when they are much further away.
---
Don‚Äôt have the dlc yet
---
It actually doesn't have anything to do with latency or desynch issues. It intended, your hitbox lingers at the window for about half a second after you vault it. The developers don't intend vault points to be completely safe resources, thats what pallets are for. Vault points=unlimited use, Pallets=Single use. If the hitbox didn't linger at the window for about half a second it would be impossible to hit you through the window which isn't what the developers want.
---
Looks broken, sometimes feels broken, working entirely as intended  though.
---
You literally get some blood points for "quitter bonus" tho. Sure it's not as much but it's points regardless. A killer leaves early game and survivors depip by 2
---
You have the right to suggest everything you want, and everyone else has the right to tell you how they feel about your suggestions, that's a non issue.
---
It's latency and they will, how about not speaking about stuff you are ignorant?
---
Doc with all 3 range add-ons + The tape that turns it into a column AoE? Say hello to shocking one gate switch while standing at the other one.
---
Usually I only DC if I feel like my team is a waste of time, not justifying it but their are times I get hooked after a 3minute chase, no gens have gotten done and I see people crouched behind rocks etc.. or I don't see them at all because they're in lockers.
---
I wish you had a button you could push to sob quietly in a corner
---
Yeah, that's the worst when you get a group like that.
---
Maybe they are another killer's sounds ;)
---
Nurse with Campbell‚Äôs last breath, Fragile Wheeze, Dark Cincture, and (the brown add on). The true, godlike 7 blink nurse.
---
Nea and the Pussycats*
---
I don't really agree that camping is following the objective because the objective is to kill all four survivors, not just one. (and ofc stop the gens)
---
I've been in plenty of games where the killer camps and if the team isn't super altruistic than that's the Only kill they get, plus way fewer blood points. 
---
(Though I 100% understand the desire to camp and tunnel toxic survivors)
---
That's racist
---
The only correct thing you've said so far. You're much worse than a sheep.
---
r/homophobia is calling
---
Meh. Idc anymore. Ive moved on.
---
Clearly you haven't. Lol.
---
The game is balanced arround killing 2 survivors.   
---
But that's not even what I mean.  
---
The definition or toxicity is:  Communication and behavior that BOTH risks harm (including emotional harm or distress) to other participants AND achieves no significantly higher objective. 
---
Camping achieves the objective or killing the survivor (if done right).  
---
It also doesn't cause emotional harm. You maybe get frustrated a bit, but major parts of the game could be seen as frustrating - so I wouldn't count that either.  
---
I agree that playing against a (face)camper isn't fun. And that's also a low blow. I am just saying that it isn't toxic.
---
Answer the phone.
---

---
They said they miss you.
---
That post aged well :‚ÄôP
---
I get notifications on my phone lol. Of course im look at them. Idc what people put in their mouths or butts. Not my problem.
---
Never met em.
---
I dunno, it makes the game extremely unfun which isn't just "a little bit frustrating".
---
It just continues the toxicity and creates more of a cycle, toxic survivors = toxic killers = more toxic survivors and the cycle continues.
---
Speak for yourself lol
---
You also can't get robbed if you just give away all your money.
---
Your name is on the Wall of Honor
---
I'll never understand the point of shitting on people for putting effort into the game, lol.
---
Lmao I love how these are all situational or based on chance üòÇüòÇ
---
Of course but there no need to be selfish
---
You can‚Äôt which is a bummer (although she‚Äôd be so OP if you could) but Nurse‚Äôs has still helped me a lot with her!
---
Exactly!
---
Nope! lmao
---
I can agree with that, but it's still not toxic if we go by the definition of online-gaming-toxicity, that's all I am saying.  
---
Going by that logic of subjective entertainment/unfun everything could be seen as toxic.  
---
Getting hit by DS. Getting kited through pallets. Hitting someone who has MoM active. Insta-Heals. Ruin getting destroyed in the first 20 seconds.  
---
Everything "could" be considered as extremely frustrating/unfunny if you care a lot.
---
Don‚Äôt play doc, he is not very good
---
r/Technicallythetruth
---
We don't care about your shitty comment
---
UrBUG EVASION 2.0 right there.
---
Thank you guys for all your help! &lt;3
---
There's a difference that people don't seem to understand between camping and being within 500 miles of the hook when someone is trying to unhook.
---
Also, where is the logic in not protecting your main objective? lol. That's like saying survivors shouldn't do generators if I'm too far away from them.
---
&gt;because you WANT to be treated differently.
---
Please elaborate as to how LGBT people want to be special and treated differently.
---
Because anyone will tell you that they just want to be accepted and treated as normal.
---
Would you say the same thing about Black History month? Would you even have the balls to complain about that like you do this?
---
I love it
---
This!
---
Hit boxes are the same they‚Äôve always been. 
---
Seems the laggy hits and desync are a symptom of some of the changes made recently to get ready for dedicated servers iirc
---
Aparentlty you do to comment on it
---
Honestly not sure which side of the argument you're taking here, but that still qualifies it as a legitimate issue. Just one that they're fixing when they do dedicated servers. It's 100% an issue in the game right now and it wasn't always as bad as it is now so I'm definitely hoping for a good fix.
---
You mean Will Myers?
---
I got 24 Ebony mori on my legion, just slowly getting bloodpoints, u'll get there.
---
I get the philosophical consistency bit.
---
But it wasn't just me. She did this to the entire team. As you said a valid way to play the game. But are the survs afterwards not supposed to be salty about it?
---
This community isn't welcoming. To *anyone.*
---
...
---
Or the Mori.
---
‚ÄúBecause anyone will tell you that they just want to be treated normally‚Äù
---
Then why tf am I getting downvoted if this is what I also want? I just don‚Äôt want anyone acting like they‚Äôre different, or be treated that way.
---
Nope
---
Sometimes I mins game myself on accident when they had already mind gamed themselves twice and get smacked
---
Nah an invisible ‚Äòwall‚Äô should keep you safe
---
I've never gotten that before. I'm flattered.
---
It may be you seeing their aura after MoM procs the aura detection. Idk.
---
So I'm right?! Wow. 
---
Yeah, you're name is kinda memorable haha.
---
That might have been me? Swamp over by one pier? Couple weeks ago?
---
Yay gay!
---
Ah okay, thanks.
---
Yeah I recently unlocked her with shards and I've played her a few times but I haven't really experimented a lot yet. I really enjoy her a lot though. I pretty rarely play killer but I enjoy it from time to time.
---
Blocking someone in the game from achieving any objective =/= perks used for either killer or survivor
---
I had a fraction of a sliver of my RBT timer and I was on my second hook because I spent the beginning of the game looping. I still had two Jigsaw boxes left.
---
Unhook altruism points aside, I was dead. I wasn't going to be helping the team.
---
I think you should stop, the first was okay but now its too much. Its not even a concept to begin with, this definitely does not look like a concept, it just looks like a 12 year old girl drawing.
---
*crouching*
---
*crouching some more*
---
#YEETED TO THE MOON#
---
*slight pause*
---
You still need to get a hook to mori
---
Yea Im %90 sure that you got stuck in the exact same room
---
Yeah but only 1. And once their down there's no counterplay if ur close enough to the hook
---
Yeah because the killer who pulled this shit on the entire team was the good guy in this story.
---
Calm down. Theyre just deawings theyre not gonna hurt you
---
Me waking up from my fifth depression nap of the day
---
Yes because NOED only activates if the survivors spend all their time rushing generators.
---
Ripppppp 
---
Everything that could go wrong did go wrong basically lmao feelsbad
---
Make sure to bring your Flashlight as a killer and pretend to be a survivor
---
So what your trying to say it this guy was a: a bot or b: he's just stupid
---
The same thing can be said about his MoM counters.
---
Sure you can be salty about it but why seriously call them out and be toxic just cause they didn't play to your standards? This would be like me playing against you and calling you out on here for using a flashlight or looping lmao it's just nonsense either way
---

---
---_I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically._
---
I use it on hillbilly, but I also run Ruin, and ToTh
---
Yea, once the survivors figured out he was stuck they just tbagged until he dcd
---
Cool.
---
I'll try to explain it one more time in a simple way.
---
If a killer is camping or tunneling a survivor, him doing that still follows the goal of eventually hitting, downing and sacrificing the survivor. 
---
That's the objective of the killer.
---
Is it funny and interactive gameplay for the survivor? 
---
Does it make the action of camping/tunneling "toxic"?
---
Proof?
---
Because it goes against the literal definition of toxicity.
---
Yeah mine did that except I didn‚Äôt dc cus I was hoping I might be able to get out :(
---
Dots to you too I suppose
---
Well, idk m8
---
&gt;Which is exactly what the LGBT community is doing, portraying themselves as special.
---
And this is what I disagree with.
---
The LGBT community is a victim to discrimination. 
---
This is the reason why there are positive things about the LGBT community, like pride month.
---
Now you‚Äôre saying that it‚Äôs because of ‚Äúpride month‚Äù that we are discriminated against? 
---
Because somehow trying to get people to accept us as normal is us wanting ‚Äúspecial treatment‚Äù? 
---
üôÑ Come on, man.
---
There are different levels of salty. 
---
You can be pissed off. You can message them. But you took more time out of your day to look at her rank, make a meme about it, and post it to reddit. You getting mad at the game is your own fault. It‚Äôs not that serious.
---
Nurse and sweaty are synonymous. This is just coincidence.
---
Yeah its an issue, but its not a hitboxes issue.
---
I will never understand why looping and swf is considered toxic. Here let me hand u my life cuz you'll throw a tantrum if u get looped 2 minutes at a pallet I didn't even have to throw down. And sfw still doesn't seem so unfair to me. This is a "team effort" kind of game right? Personally I don't understand why survivors don't have a game chat. Say someone is hooked and no one rescues thinking "someone else will get them" or everyone is on separate gens and all get off to save them and it wastes time incredibly. I don't want to hear a "then that's their fault" cuz it's not, how are they supposed to know? And if I hear "bring leader" or some shit I'll only mention that killers complain that "adrenaline is a crutch perk and all survivors run it" when they usually have NOED and still can't get a kill.
---
This is awesome.
---
a lot of claudettes overestimate their stealth skills and will crouch in the most obvious spots literally in your line of sight and then get surprised when you hit them
---
She looks like a japanese version of Karaba from Kiriku and the witch.

I‚Äôm a rank 1 killer who plays nurse a lot and I hardly ever use add ons. It fucks with my muscle memory of when I trained as her. You‚Äôll become reliant on add ins eventually and it will mess up you timing. The only ones I would use are additional blinks and recovery time ones.
---
I have no idea? Maybe connotation is different with killers so itd seem more negative? I‚Äôm not sure :0
---
we will
---
Well you posted something on a subreddit so i can state my opinions, if you'll call them skin concepts then at least try harder.
---
Like u okay there?
---
It‚Äôs latency. 
---
Jake and Dwight I ship
---
It doesn't really make a lot of sense that it's so noticeable from the killer's perspective though, so I still think that's not really the whole story. I can see it happening and I sometimes just let people go because I feel bad that I got a clearly unfair hit on them. If it was desynchronization alone then I wouldn't think that it would look off to the killer as well.
---
It could be a perk instead of an ability that while in the terror radius your vision becomes blurred by XX amount of percentage
---
oooh, kewl kewl kewl
---
I got a 3k and still depipped because the 4th dc'd at the start of the match after being hit once.
---
No worries. Very awesome drawing!
---
&gt;wait, what's wrong with Small Game? i feel like that's essential, since ruin is the meta
---
It could use a totem counter added to it. It would be a simple and welcome nice buff for solo players.

Get used to playing against billy and nurse if ghostface isn‚Äôt good enough for skilled survivors.
---
There's built-in recording software on consoles.

Not everyone is a one trick pony that only uses 1 killer at rank 1
---
Deceased omg
---
its me im the random
---
Hah this what I dont get when killers bitch about tbagging at the door. I love getting that extra kill or hit later nerd.. lmao
---
That‚Äôs true, agreed.
---
If by console meme you mean the game is a lot healthier with a greater variety of killers at all ranks then yes
---
Jokes on you because I'm gay.
---
Damn put it back. I was just kidding, im awful at drawing.
---
If you're feeling personnally attacked, maybe Reddit as a whole is not the right place for you right now. And I'm not saying that in a mean spirit, maybe you just need to not be here because the kind of social interactions that happens on Reddit is just not for you at this moment.
---
No its fucking fine.
---
Can I get a link from a cultured player?
---
They found you at a box. Do you expect them to watch you take the trap off?
---
The moment they let us have more than 4 perks at a time is the moment I quit, 4 perks is enough for an unbreakable meta and piling more shit onto that would ruin it.
---
So is a top tier nurse! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Uhh sorry?

Dont be. Youre right. Im packing in.
---
Were you wiggling on his shoulder before or did it glitch and start the wiggle meter at half
---
Wow imagine how they celebrate this in the realm of the entity. Everybody gets penetration to their bodies.
---
If she was so determined to get you, you staying alive helped the team do the objective as she waste a bunch of time on you.    
---
Plus you missed out on your bp, it may have not been much but it‚Äôs bloodpoints
---
I already have, its partially why I play got like 2-3 hours at a time before rage quitting. You play at any decent rank and you'll just see Billy after Billy after Billy. I've started to DC against them now. That killer has been broken since the start and still is, he isnt fun to play against and hes even boring to play, I refuse to play against it any more until that killer is rebalanced. Nurse is pretty bad, but at least she requires a slight semblance of brain cells to perfect her blink. Billy is brain dead and call pull off 4ks every game without even having to try, fuck that killer man
---
I'm uncomfortably energenic.
---
Or that, sure. I was just thinking of some type of radience or Medusa-like trait of a killer, which would be quite cool.

It does look like jane. Plus my drawings are too irregular. I'll just lurk from now on.

I once had my controller die next to the hatch right after I picked up a survivor. I was not happy.

I like to believe these kinds of things simply for the benefit of the doubt

No. I'm guessing from the footage that you are new at the game, and so is he. You can learn, he can learn, no need to shame anyone or call them stupid.

Didn't they say in the stream that there is no time limit and it never expires?

It is latency,

The second DBD machinima short I've made. The [previous one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nBbNXBX19k) was based on Ash's lore in the game. For these I use the various survivors as actors playing the roles of each character that isn't in the game (in the Spirit's case, to play her human form).

So someone being happy for what they are in the face of opposition is bad in your opinion. I don‚Äôt know how to tell you this bud but LGBT people don‚Äôt have the luxury of being non political. Unfortunately our entire existence is politicized as a result of continued oppression. It‚Äôs easy to say ‚Äúget your politics out of video games‚Äù when you can live an apolitical life. So maybe think about that next time you shit on someone‚Äôs parade because you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care‚Äù. If you actually didn‚Äôt care you wouldn‚Äôt have felt the need to comment. You would have just scrolled by.

You have to be more specific, which part of the message is unclear?
---
There is no reason for her not to have a vault animation, it's complete guesswork.
---
Deal. With. It
---
Well deserved.
---
Survivors are definitely the more toxic side. They will SC if they get caught in the first minute then message you saying you‚Äôre tunneling trash. They tea-bag, flick flashlights, point and bag, and verbally abuse you after the match. 
---
Just last night I made a 3-man swf quit in the first  90 seconds. The remaining time I got messages flooding my inbox on PS4 calling me names from all three. I found the fourth survivor and just followed them around while they did gens vomiting every so often. I let them stun me as well, once the gens were complete I lead the survivor to the hatch. 
---
It does suck to be grouped in that ‚Äú toxic survivor group‚Äù because on the occasions I do play survivor it‚Äôs either Claudette or Nea.
---
Every time I play with my friends, one of them ends up running out of batteries mid game. It‚Äôs funny and sad to see them running from the killer, suddenly stop, and get caught without resistance. 
---
Ps4 controller battery sucks so much.
---
Stunning the pug even though you know she has enduring and spirit fury just to hear the sound
---
No, it's not rng. You can read the other player and use the info that you have to make the right decision.
---
Spirit isn't is a coin flip, if you do evade her you just got lucky.
---
Plus it still doesn't change the fact that she should have a vault animation.
---
Oh I get it, you‚Äôre just a jackass

---
If you evade spirit then you just got lucky, you didn't really do anything.
---
They literally said in one of the recent patch notes that they fixed this, lmao
---
what if the person you're face camping did 3 generators and looped the killer while the person they ratted out urban evaded around the map doing nothing all game? 
---
who deserves to die more?
---
So when your experience is bad I guess you could say you lost the game
---
Its like you know I‚Äôm green rank lol
---
Key word: "if". That word screams situational. IF you bring an insta heal. And moris seem a lot more common than insta heals for me at least. I have nea p3 lv50 and I usually go for insta heals and flashlights (prob considered toxic for that but whatever) when I can and yet I literally haven't gotten anything but a yellow flashlight in the past 13 level ups and I only have 2 syringes and 1 of the other insta heal (forgot the name) yet my lv 36 Michael Myers already has an ebony mori, one ivory, and 2 cypress.
---
\&gt; literally everyone in the thread : "Get Myers"
---
\&gt; You : "I think i'll get myers because she can teabag
---
I went to play deathgarden until hitbixes are fixed. Been playing dbd since release and this is by far the worst thing to happen to it
---
Thanks.
---
I hate it.
---
What fuckery have you brought upon this cursed land?
---
uhm... gosh, you know.. now that you mention it... I can't remember either! Anyone?? Was it body blocking..? or was it voice comms..?? damn...
---
They will continuously come out with new ones, yet the old ones will always be accessible.
---
You can't prevent remember me once tokens have been acquired especially if The Obsession is dead you can stop no one escapes death from coming into the game
---
As in you could buy one pass like months later after it ended? Can you level up in multiple passes at once?
---
tempted to just start bringing noed out of spite until mom is changed
---
Im sorry.
---
this is awesome lol
---
I am a new player from the game pass. I do appreciate the video. One thing about it is, you said the tutorial was bad but didn‚Äôt explain what really to do. Now I‚Äôve played a couple nights and I‚Äôm rank 15 but if a new player rank 20 watches this, I don‚Äôt think they will get much out of it other then etiquette. Didn‚Äôt really go over survivor at all. Idk seems like a long way to say don‚Äôt puppy guard and don‚Äôt go after the same guy. Just my 2. Ents being I just started playing without looking at any sort of content or anything before playing.
---
A top tier Nurse takes skill.
---
The aforementioned builds take... none.
---
I'm on console and I set my messages back to private only three hours after I started playing again (following a several month break) after getting salt for not saving someone from an Insidious camping infinite T3 Myers.
---
I can only imagine the salty I'd have gotten over a few of my Killer games and the absolutely dumb shit some of the Survivors did. I've had them complain before about tunneling when they've run literally right at me. And not an "oh no, I've rounded the corner and just saw a stealth Killer" situation, but across *open fucking fields* with direct LoS and an active TR. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I love it! it's awesome!
---
The head is separate from the body in game tho so maybe that's why we don't have it
---
It's a head scratcher! But better get to the bottom of it you know, since we're saying whatever devs intended is what's fair.
---
well, did you kill them?
---
both gates were opened and i just killed myself so they could've had a reason to leave because i know that with altruistic survivors, all of us would've went down against Billy (but Nea was crouching in the corner of the shack for idk what reason and got downed but Meg, without having at least a brain cell, got grabbed while she tried to unhook Nea), idc that i died but i'm hella pissed that i died for basically nothing
---
I mean technically they are right it's not a scream DLC it's just ghostface
---
God that happened to me as I was escaping while the bloodwarden blocker popped up
---
Yeet, as the kids say.
---
Ngl, kinda cringe bruhmanüíÄ

---
Nope none of them, at the end of the game i resorted to camping because the 2 red ranks were running me around constantly. Scummy i know but i'm also running noed on huntress because i don't use her a lot
---
It's more like tree and nurse vs survivor. They're collaborating
---
lots of homophobes on this sub based off the downvotes but seems they're too scared to make a comment
---
In all fairness they didn't teabag
---
NO.
---
I don't think the third seal needs to be reworked. its not an amazing perk but i dont see how it would be changed, unless it was made not a hex
---
Well, we both know the squatter deserves to die, but, any self respecting survivor like the one you e described would know better than to rat out their TMs, regardless if they're trash.
---
Just my opinion.
---
Hit me! HIT ME!
---
Bloodpoints cap at 1,000,000. I'd recommend grinding to that amount on other killers that you're comfortable with, then putting the points into him, prioritizing perks (should get you to level 40), then play him or someone else to get the rest of the way to level 50. You can then prestige him or keep leveling him to get perks (I would recommend using up the good addons and offerings on him, and then prestiging him). Make sure you understand how prestiging works (it resets your killer level, and all perks, offerings, and addons, and gives you a cosmetic, starting with the knife).
---
What I do and see most people do is sit on a bunch of level 50 killers, playing them when they feel like or spamming one, and then when one of them needs more addons or new perks, they save up a bunch of points and prestige them.
---
There's nothing in the world more fun than M&amp;A Scratched Mirror Myers on Lery's. I live playing as him and against him. It's amazing.
---
Bbq finally has some competition with thrilling tremors, hope they don't nerf it
---
*"Yoooo Jake what did you put in that medkit man"*
---
Signature at the bottom left made me think I was loading into a map 10/10 would burn offering again

how do you know their killers level?

In the glorious words of Samination...

‚ÄúUgh, you‚Äôre such a Claudette!

Guys, serious question.  
---
Do you think dbd mobile can run on an iphone 6?
---
[This thread](https://i.imgur.com/1aZsQ69.png)
---
Very nice!
---
I mean, the people who don't agree with you are being downvoted into the negatives and the who who ARE agreeing with him are getting upvoted. 
---
Also, why are you acting so rude in the first place? Do you need to shout about how validated you feel from the rooftops? You sound really insecure about it. 
---
&gt;Wow. Now I don't feel bad about DCing at all hahaha. Keep being petty :)
---
Keep in mind this began *because* you couldn't just let yourself get mori'd and get it over with. You need to scramble to find ways to feel like you 'won' over the killer even if you DC'd which counts as being killed to the game and you end up wasting add-ons, offerings, and get no BP in return.
---
I mean they are right it's not a Scream DLC it's a Ghostface DLC.
---
*Destroyed 30 seconds later*
---
But you can just kill him by hooking him. You aren't entitled to a trophy just like a survivor isn't entitled to the hatch. A trophy isn't even a victory, it's something you earn lol.
---
Fuck that made me exhale so much air from my nose
---
ITT: People who need to learn battery management. üòÇ
---
It's the survivors responsibility to check their ping before a match begins, if the killer is lagging that's on you
---
Uma Compton
---
They just buffed dead hard I think
---
Don't think you'll find hidden blades, theyre very impractical in real life so Assassins Creed style is probably your best bet
---
I don't use either offerings all that much tbh.
---
I actually adore this map as Pig. Lots of foliage for me to surprise survivors with! 
---
One of my favorite maps as survivor as well.
---
If nothing else, you gave the killer the quitter bonus.  Also what Shelby said.
---
üëå
---
Do you have a preferred offering?
---
They should remove this from the game
---
Well assuming the picture is correct its free for players with game pass. In other words a very small monthly free for an entire library of games. Its Xbox's netflix.
---
*Urge to fiddle with it and make sexual noises until it falls apart intensifies*

Don't mind me, just here to read the comments.
---
If saying that IDV is an obvious copy of DBD is the hill I die on, so be it
---
Can I have one, please?
---
Pretty tame tbh
---
Oh no, those are the spirit/nurse players. Myers is perhaps a bit better than other m1 killers. He is pretty fun
---
It wasn't mine and I knew she was coming back for it.
---
not needing anything real, just something for a complete cosplay
---
Survivors are like moths to a porch light when it comes to hooked survivors.
---
Kill her again
---
If I see survivors picking Haddonfield I just leave the game before it loads in ;) This map is just imposible to win with BL and why would I bother playing the match?
---
Won't her traps not progress if you're in her terror radius now though?
---
Ill save you a couple games before you figure this out: if youre in frenzy and someone drops a pallet in front of you, vault over it (obviously), like 60% of the time they will try to immediately vault onto the other side after your vault animation completes. If you see someone stay at the pallet while you're vaulting it, right after your vault finishes do a 180 and attack. If you're lucky you will get a grab (actually not sure if you can grab while in frenzy) but you will at least get a hit 100% of the time
---
Nurse is my favorite killer.
---
No kidding? I had no idea that‚Äôs what the king Iditarod was for. I don‚Äôt play games over 100 ping. This was a spike
---
"Getting revenge" for fucking what? Playing the game, trying to get hardest fucking trophy in the game, and not just giving them a free win?
---
You realize you don't have to play hag to get ruin right? I never play the killers that I level up for teachables.
---
It would be pretty funny if you could emote spam like you can in For Honor.
---
I have fun even if I loose but it depends on they way I lost. If I got genrushed in 3 minutes and teabagged at every pallet on Blood Lodge(oh, you're so skillful, you managed to find a pallet on Blood Lodge) I don't have fun. Same with omega blink sweaty Nurse with ebony mori slugging everyone just because. But if I have some fun chases and die, it's completely fine with me. Same with killer.
---
Yeah lots of people are just downvoting comments that are just happy/non-offensive. I was just so excited to show some dbd pride!
---
PGJSF
---
It's like they are looking behind them as if I am chasing and then they just choose to run right into me.
---
Nah its good!!! Charges quickly.
---
It's viewable in postgame?
---
What would his perks be?
---
Actually Freddy is better than Doctor... I really like Doctor's design, his giggles etc but he's just useless.
---
What if they buffed the blindness status effect, what if it caused you to not be able to see other survivors statuses, you dont know if they're
---
Injured healthy downed or whatever, and it hid how many gens were left, that would be a nice buff
---
I noticed this in a match but assumed it was a glitch
---
It's not MoM, I see their aura before MoM activates ;)
---
Looking like Mulan!
---
Let's see for how long.
---
Good question, I assumed Flip Flop but he's not running it
---
I support this 100%. Frank West would be an amazing choice for a new survivor.
---
If you cleanse she can too and get insta down vomit
---
I either use the common BP offerings or simply nothing at all. I'm pretty chill as killer.
---
LMAO. *Love* the hypocrisy, dude. "I just countered his add-on and DCed when he countered my counter, what's the big deal?"
---
JFC.
---
I was really nervous to post this, because my previous post about happy pride just got too overwhelming. I just wanted to share with the community some happiness because this month means a lot to people. Like I came out just yesterday to my family, so it is pretty exciting for me to share this!
---
Go ahead it is all yours
---
You can save it if you want to
---
Ah shit, time to get flamed for ‚Äútunneling‚Äù
---
Yeah let‚Äôs just make plague a top 3 killer by giving her no counterplay. 
---
All 4 of these are awful, even if implemented separately.
---
She wasn't really nerfed so drastically. Leaving traps for the end was usually a waste, I alwasy use them up before the end. But yea, she needs some buffs. Faster crouch, longer distance with dash(so as she was able to mindgame longer loops), getting rid of rrroar until she hits someone(it is really hindering her). I would also make something about those keys. For example you have to find two parts of a key or something, ppl taking it in the first box is just bullshit. Waste like 20 seconds of their time...
---
And he would have, by countering the Survivor's counter, but the Survivor decided to be a whiny little bitch about it and DC instead.
---
Yeah, me too.
---
Love the sound of that killer!
---
No one except new players read the loading screen tips anyways, so it doesn't matter much
---
Are you on ps4? Because the past couple days I have been getting matched with red and purple ranks 80% of the time when I have very rarely before. I dont know if everyone seems to be groping out of their own rank or if matchmaking is just weird right now.
---
Getting stomped by people way above my rank is fun and all but I'd like to at least not depip so often when it is most of my games
---
BHVR: "hmmm we could sell this".
---
If you run Predator &amp; Bloodhound it will be almost impossible for them to get away once you find  them. It makes tracking sooooo much easier.
---
I definitely don‚Äôt camp, but whenever i put a survivor on a hook and walk away, i start counting down from 10 in my head lol.
---
Damn, he really loves Myers. Look how dilated his pupils are.
---
*g r o o v y*
---
Nope, i think it was the old red forest map a couple months back. Good on you for helping a random!
---
Hex: devour hope is so much fun on wraith. Yeah you‚Äôre gonna lose it sometimes, but when you don‚Äôt it‚Äôs fucking hilarious. 
---
My build is identical with hex dh and it‚Äôs tonnes of fun man
---
Plus the killers are all human. Sure many have been disfigured and/or given supernatural abilities, but still human.
---
I've gotta know, did you just completely rebuild this with the DBD stuff or did you just paste stuff on top of the original vid? Either way the amount of effort put into this post is fucking incredible
---
Yep ps4, i am complaining because i either get people that are 4-5 ranks lower or like 7-8 ranks higher. However it helps me to learn their strats because i've just started maining spirit
---
I got it from the zedge app
---
that'd actually be pretty cool
---
I'm not talking about the DC. The person I am responding to is saying that you shouldn't jump into a locker and deny the mori if you are the last survivor.
---
Hi not talking about the dc. the person i am responding to is saying that you shouldn't jump into a locker and deny the mori if you are the last survivor., I'm dad.

why the hell am I downvoted does anything without any context get downvoted here
---
I love Plague and play as her a lot and although it is annoying when no one cleanses that is her counter play. 
---
When I play survivor and i‚Äôm against a Plague I get so mad whenever someone cleanses and the whole match goes to shit from there as her Corrupt Purge is incredibly powerful.
---
In this game, there's nothing you can do to protect bad survivors, if they're boosted theyreally boosted
---
killer emotes or  \*\*R I O T\*\*
---
Few thoughts. 
---
1. I doubt the devs would make perks based around a survivor being male/female. 
---
2. From what I gather, her scream power is only useful if they have the exposed status? As in, it does nothing unless they‚Äôre exposed. Plus her scream gives little counterplay except jumping into a locker, in which you‚Äôre probably dead as soon as you jump out. 
---
The first part of her power is pretty cool though.
---
I float 15-12 as killer, West Europe, PC, and get green, purple and sometimes red survivors.
---
I honestly can't remember my last trapper game as survivor despite knowing I've had two this past week though I'm always wondering if I should swap to killer mid queue so I wind up against the bad players I was supposed to join, at least so that I'm not hook farmed without borrowed time for once.

Hey can you send me a picture of the shave I have a few days to check up on it and unlock it for me baby 
---

---
Why is getting snatched off a box scummy?!?
---
I actually did get it from Plunderer's. Not a bad perk. I also like it for knowing where basement is.
---
Thank you so much! Where did you a find a picture this great?
---
Please I need this
---
Happened to me last night, worth it to spectate and see everyone else survive though :)
---
I know people will cry about it anyway but if leatherface is Insidious camping just rush gens if the dude dies on hook so be it
---
He kept picking me up and dropping me. My mate I was playing with was telling me where hatch was, so I just kept crawling that way.
---
I died in a game once because a meg used autodidact.
---
Yeah bubba can get boring to play as and huntress is one of the hardest killers to master. Okay so the reasons are:
---
Hag-sudden teleport and getting hit feels cheap, and you are basically camping even when you are not which makes it really boring.
---
Clown-the visuals are annoying and he makes you camp pallets, unless they are close together in which case you can bait bottles, but that's it.
---
Spirit-i hate the guessing game with her, her whaaa is annoying and in good hands borderline broken.
---
Pig-dont hate her that much but the party hat makes you vulnerable manybtimes, there is too much RNG about it and many pigs are just tunneling(which is not too effective with her or camp while crouching.
---
Legion-much better after the rework but still boring, and the deep wound effect is too much for me.
---
Freddy-he throws me off so much, I'm sure I survived more nurses than Freddies, can't wait for the rework.
---
Soon my friend. We just have to wait out the storm.
---
Because its boring for literally everyone. Its boring for the killer who is just sitting there doing nothing, its boring for the survivor who is sitting there doing nothing, and its boring for the other survivors who are sitting there doing gens.
---
they've been saying that they're going to take a look at hitboxes and they'll be able to take a better look at them once we have dedicated servers
---
so the devs don't believe that they're fine, they believe they could be improved
---
Its very identical to battlefields one. The font, the color, the graphics.
---
How dare you compare gays to dcers smh, of all people gay people know how to stay and not quit when they're getting fucked, unlike the average dbd player
---
Great, after Pig, maybe you get Ghostface, he can tea bag too.
---
Wha...- how?
---
Wraith's ability doesn't give you easy downs, only easy first hits. That makes him pretty bad, as he has to chase in his uncloaked form(unless you use add-ons).  
---
I use the exact same build as you do on Wraith(I just don't run BS), and I do *okay* with him.  
---
Survivors getting gens fast is just survivors playing the game. In order to get pressure, you need to slug a lot; something Wraith has trouble with because he's an M1 killer.
---
I love dwight's little yelp as he's launched into space.
---
Yes but say I leave the two hooked guys. They're just going to get pulled off with me hunting the last guy. It may be boring but it works in certain situations. I don't do it with 1 hooked. and 3 people up.
---
Don't give them ideas!
---
The guy who threw down the pallet is a horrible teammate
---
What if it‚Äôs haunted grounds? üåö
---
I'm not saying it isn't a smart thing to do, I'm explaining why people complain about it. You're removing the only reason to only play DBD - fun.
---
How can you compare Billy with Nurse? Spirit's better than him imo.  
---
Myres is much weaker than Hag.  
---
Freddy should be lower than Wraith; Doc should be Higher than Bubba; Legion should be next to Bubba.
---
Billy in the same tier as Nurse ? Myers over Spirit ? Wraith is the last one ?
---
This list is a big NO for me.
---
There should be 1 for killers that I could press whenever I'd get a 4 member squad-gang of T-baggers.
---
Sweet! :‚Äô3
---
She was nerfed for me because that was how I played her lol. I agree with this though.
---
I hate getting canped.
---
So a survivor DCed because they were getting exploited and yikes you are here writing a paragraph defending it. .Exploiting not bad, DCing bad'.
---
Nice argument.
---
Just had a daily ritual where i needed to level up Evil Within 4 times. That's all. Easy 30k BP. Match starts, i walk around and hear a gen level up Evil Within twice off the same person because they wouldn't break line of sight even after they noticed me. I'm not actually even trying to kill, just want to do my damn daily. They fuck up constantly throughout the map, and i walk over and watch them. One runs right into me so i down her at rank 3 and throw her on a hook for points, then walk away using the stalk so see if anyone else lights up. 
---
They get the gens, finally. They get the door. I down one more before she can escape. and just let her crawl out the exit.
---
End game chat explodes with "FUCKIN CAMPURRRR!!!!!111" "FUCKING LOSER!!" "UNINSTAL LOSER!!!" Just mountains of salt even though i let them win.
---
The one time i try to play nice and let the survivors go. And these entitles little shits wonder why they get face camped, and tunneled, and mori'd, and NOED, and Ruin.
---
it's definitely a hitbox issue too tho, lol I've played against Nurses who have told me they had no idea how certain things have hit when the animation of M1'ing was already done and the survivor gets hit by the thin air 
---
this has also happened to me as killer too, sure latency plays a part but hitboxes are shitty sometimes
---
Sometimes I pretend^* to be bad at Trapper and just trap the shit out of the doors, and then go on a few halfhearted chases. And they get gens easily and run to the exits, probably thinking I don't know how to use traps. Obviously it doesn't always work and I don't get that many kills, but when it does happen... :)
---
^^^(*) ^^^terms ^^^and ^^^conditions ^^^may ^^^apply
---
&gt; climbing through slowly for no reason.
---
that's a medium vault, you have to be running straight at the window for a fast vault.
---
I protecc my boney boi :&lt;
---
Myres over Hag?
---
Right then. Insidious camping is the most scummy way of playing ever. It requires no skill at all and just makes people DC. Gen rushing can be done to aid against it. But the person is still pretty much guaranteed to die. And the killer will usually give post game chat talking about how great they are. Yeah, they are great at ruining the game for everyone and making dbd unbearable. ;)
---
Shes pretty strong already but if survivors never cleanse  her power is pretty useless imo
---
I never said that these would all be implemented together. I meant separately.
---
I could say the same thing about looping tbh.
---
Yeah, canping is the worst...
---
Shoutout to the 4 folks who said it anyway
---
lol we'll have to leave it to the community to unravel, this comment thread is getting too long, and don't want people to see us together....

Just give me some effort next time, and don't forget to call me in the morning big boy c;

*Spooky scary skeleton playing*
---
‚ÄúWhy do people cry when I make the game as unfun as humanly possible for everyone in the match?‚Äù
---
Truly a mystery.
---
After all this I'm sure the next original survivor they didn't start making yet will be him.
---
Eh. If you're last and you're locker juking just to dodge the Mori, in full awareness that a hook is death anyway, what's really the point? You don't *have* to do it, obviously, but if you've lost anyway why be a dick about it?
---
Winning is fun to me.
---
I don't really have trouble with losing people during chases. I would rather have perks that slow the survivors down or make me finish chases faster
---
Yea devs would never do perks based around female/ male but i think it would be interesting.
---
For the screaming power i thought it should only be able to hit you when having exposed effect because i guess a distanz attack with a bigger hitbox then a hatched that cant be blocked by walls would be to strong. :D
---
Give it an extra month or so and nobody will ever cleanse and she will just become absolute garbage.
---
Add ons or no add ons?
---
If add ons, which rarities? 
---
Lists change based on add ons.
---
That is the point of her power though. I don't see it as fair for the survivors to be able to completely bypass that.
---
The first buff seems reasonable, but it never gonna be implemented because developers don't want to make a new Freddy after reworking the current one. 
---
Plague doesn't need much to be a good killer, but I think she will never receive the buffs she needs.
---
Getting easy first hits does give you easy downs. If you happen to already have spirit fury activated you can down someone in like 20 seconds after you find them easily
---
You could try making one. Using the blade of a knife (blunted please, don‚Äôt want any accidents) on a spring mechanism would work great. 
---
If you can‚Äôt make one, then I‚Äôm not sure if you could find Piggy cosplay blades, since they‚Äôre really difficult to sell as an item (not many people buy them).
---
Camping=trash.
---
Right? I didn't want to think that at first because I main Claudette solely because she has healing perks and I always play healer, but the more I play killer the more Claudettes just bloody do that and I am starting to get sick of it.
---
I get my revenge though. You T-bag and are a douche in general? Enjoy getting face-camped, I know I will enjoy it.
---
r/dbdgonewild lol
---
im with you, not sure why people are so offended they have to get reminded that gay people exist 1/12 times of the year
---
these gamers think they‚Äôre too cool for the gays huh
---
If you happen to have SF up, you already get a free down.  
---
First easy hits do not give you a free down; look at Legion for example.
---
Okay, that was actually the exact perk I was going for next because I've never used it before. Def leveling my hag after I get MYC in my wraith web
---
She looks like a man now. Bring her back !
---
100% agree with the potential power of the actual screaming. Just feel like in most situations I‚Äôd rather them be exposed for the thirty seconds and actually chase them than wind up. Not a lot of counterplay. 
---
I missed it if it was in the actual power, but is it a cone ability? Or is it whatever she sees in front of her? The screaming power.
---
i‚Äî
---
No you can't, because interaction actually involves some interaction between the killer and the survivor.
---
 Like you wouldn't be able to see when gens pop? That could be good. The only problem this would be useless against SWF
---
I always let the last leave unless they were being a douche. Usually I down them but then bring them to the hatch or let them wiggle out if I closed the hatch earlier
---
Hey, we made [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/dbdgonewild/comments/bcugx9/parody_of_solidarity_nsfw/) a while back and wanted to do another! This is our second perk parody and we have plans for at least one more!
---
do you mean rank?
---
&gt;Plague doesn't need much to be a good killer 
---
Shouldn't the developers strive to have the killers be somewhat close to each other in terms of quality? In my opinion, there is a difference between a bad killer and a killer whose power gets ignored because of an oversight by the devs.
---
User flair checks out
---
That's too. And even Huntress is better than him. Most of the time, maybe not on maps like Lery's.
---
I actually was thinking about this and the limitations they have with their cosmetics, all they need to do is make the bunny ears a hat like Louise from Bob's Burgers and a simple jacket, then you have bunny Feng
---
It's same crap. Cheese.
---
It helps you find them when they try to hide as you get close to a generator, because you‚Äôll be able to see the exact path they took instead of a sea of scratch marks. And it will make you finish chases faster because you will be able to know exactly where they are running instead of fumbling to find the exact path when they break line of sight. My friend gets 4k‚Äôs all the time with that build + Hex Ruin &amp; Nurses Calling.
---
Again, no it isn't. When you Insidious camp, no one is playing the game. When you are being looped, at the very least you are in pursuit of a survivor and they are actively trying to evade you.
---
So you rather have the survivors just run into you killing themselves?  
---
As killer, you don't experience any killer-survivor interaction; you're just standing still looking at a hook for 2 minutes. As survivor, you just get to stay on the hook for 2 minutes doing nothing.
---
I've done it multiple times and was able to get to the hatch because the killer could not accept they weren't getting the mori. Plus, going by your logic, it goes both ways. Do I have to let the last survivor go if I know they are trying to get a trophy? It's silly. 
---
If the killer messages me asking for help, 9/10 I will help them get it if they are polite and I don't have an escape daily. Otherwise, I get more points and another chance to escape. You aren't entitled to a trophy.
---
Lmfao
---
What makes this a parody rather than a lewd drawing...?
---
and for lords sake why is this not censored by default for me. I usually have to click on stuff. I don‚Äôt want to see video game characters naked.
---
You don't have a guaranteed down just with spirit fury. Its a free hit but then they can still run you around while injured. I've played a decent bit of legion and legion is a good example of being able to get downs. After you hit tons of people in frenzy your next chase is almost always against someone whos already injured.
---
I am playing the game. That's what the perks there for. I'm waiting for the last players next move. It's a strategy game after all.
---
Pop goes the weasel - the idea of this perk is so great but really BHVR? 30 seconds? It should give you a token(maybe max 2 tokens) to destroy gens whenever you want(not like you stack 10 tokens and smash every gen to the ground).
---
How did a sexuality get a month though
---
Nobody cleansing against her already. All you need to do to get rid of her Corrupt Purge is just to pallet stun her and she loses all her Corrupt Purge.
---
So why are the fixing it if it isn't?
---
I thought keyboards were wired. When did they start running on batteries not even kidding
---
Reposted with minor changes, I didn't know the order in the rows were affected so my bad - this is my opinion btw please consider that, thanks.
---
Myres is the best M1 killer. Any non-M1 killer is better than him.
---
Uhm no? That makes no sense at all. You literally just made all that up.
---
Oh yes, 'body blocking is a mechanic for a reason'... yeah those killers blocking the basement stairs for an hour were only using a mechanic, I guess. Not an exploit btw.
---
People in this thread https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUomVzVcNR0
---
I don't mean you are literally not playing the video game, I mean you are not actively interacting with the other team, which is extremely boring.
---
Are you seriously not able to pull your head out of your ass and see how its boring? If you played a game, got downed in 10 seconds, and then were facecamped until you died, you'd say you had fun?
---
I've only played myers bubba legion pig and Freddy and I actually agree with those killers
---
Going to repost my original comment: 
---
‚ÄúIs this list add ons or no add ons? If add ons, which rarities?‚Äù
---
Idk I just don't see those perks being that helpful. It only takes a second or so to figure out what direction the survivor went if they lose sight, and even if you arent sure of their exact path, the general direction is almost always blatently obvious. I guess those perks would save me a couple seconds but I don't see it being significant as spirit fury + enduring. I'll give them a try though. I'll try your friends build
---
Trapper isn't the worst in the game imo, better than doctor for sure.
---
It is actually multiple sexualities and gender expressions and I‚Äôd look at the wikipedia for pride month. LGBT are people put into camps, killed, stoned to death, abused, and etc. all over the world. This is a way to light heartedly celebrate as it calls attention to the fact we are here to stay, and that we are strong and brave. It is like Black History Month, asian Pacific Islander heritage moth, Breast Cancer Awareness month, etc. it is a month meant to raise awareness
---
Im a 2017 player and still recognize most of this
---
Consider it addons and addonless, feel free to judge this list based upon either or give points on either addons or addonless.
---
Dont you mean your pretty...chili...sorry I'll go now.
---
The community?? Anyone but those assholes.
---
He's just doing his Micheal Myers impersonation, chill
---
I need an option. 
---
Lists change based on if a killer can have add ons, as killer concepts usually stay the same if their add ons are bad/worse than others.
---
You're contradicting yourself here.  
---
"Your next chase is almost always against someone who is already injured"  
---
"They can still run you around while injured"
---
Keep the minorities happy so they dont riot. I get it. I dont really like people who praise their sexuality that much.. HEY GUYS LOOK IM GAY! ACCEPT IT, I WANT TV CHARACTERS THAT ARE GAY TOO MAKE IT HAPPEN. 
---
Quiet gays are cool tho
---
Those are the exact killers I've ever bought.
---
oh hey its human being lol
---
Yeah I would say just give it a try, I know it doesn‚Äôt sound life changing - but those few nano seconds your brain is calculating the exact path can make a difference. I‚Äôve watched him using that build at least 100 times and I‚Äôve never seen him not pip (95% of the time he gets a 4K). BTW this only works with the level 3 version of the perks, the lower level versions are worthless and will not help.
---
You have no collision when the survior is dropped and you get stunned, the guy had to fuck up pretty bad for a few seconds to not run away during the animation and get stuck. (not an exploit) 
---
Nah dc fam for being a dumb fuck and not accepting the defeat
---
That's not even the scenario my post was about. Like I said earlier to I don't face camp 1 player hooked. Learn to read.
---
Or they could be people who don't want homo content in r/deadbydaylight, be it pro or anti? This is a subreddit for a game after all...
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Because camping is generally annoying and boring for both killer and survivors (unless you are camping when gates are powered up)
---
I don't know how Trapper is worse than Freddy.  
---
Where'd you get that Myres is better than Huntress and Hag?  
---
Just how is Spirit even close to Nurse? With Spirit's best add-ons, she might be the same as an add-on-less Nurse.
---
I mean that in a month or so, survivors at all ranks above 15 will just never cleanse. So are you saying that she is bad now too?
---
Lol.
---
*excuse me what the fuck*
---
Better than Freddy for sure?  
---
Doctor is much more consistent than Trapper.
---
I think a frost troll wandered into the entity
---
Pretty much like a cone ability yea. I thought it could be her way to deal with loops. When bringing a survivor into exposed effect she somehow still can manage to injure survivors in loops with the scream when she cant reach the survivor with a regular hit.
---
Even when I'm getting "ruin"ed by the killer, which is often, I never DC so no u.
---
I want you to give me your opinion on this list being with addons. Then I want another opinion where it's addonless is what I asked for, sorry if I made it sound confusing.
---
this was beautiful
---
Judging from your attitude I'm pretty sure your situation was way more malicious than you're describing, but whatever. Everyone has told you why and you don't give a shit, so what's the point of this post.
---
All tier lists are meaningless because of how many variables affect the strength of killers by wildly different amounts. Which perks, which add ons, combinations of both with huge synergy, moris, playstyles, etc. There is ridiculous amounts of variability that affect these rankings drastically. 
---
And you can't make a ranking based on "no perks or add ons" either because that's about as pointless as it gets. There is no scenario where you would have no perks or add ons outside of a challenge game.
---
thanks i hate it
---
No, devs don't want to make viable killers anymore. After Huntress release, all killers except Spirit were underwhelming at best or even just pure shit. The devs made Plague like this : you can't loop a killer while injured ? Then cleanse and try to hide from her Corrupt Purge or just pallet stun her. You can loop her while injured ? Don't even bother cleansing. They already said that they wanted to give the survivors the choice of cleansing or not ( because apparently killers needs the permission from survivors to be powerful ) and they also said that the broken status was the only effect survivors receive when they becone fully sick, because if they would add other effects in fully sickness, then it would become to "unfun" for survivors.
---
If you want to play a game so you can not play it and instead watch someone mash a button for two minutes, you do you. Sounds like the exact opposite of fun to me but it takes all sorts.
---
I hate people who do that when I‚Äôm playing killer.
---
Do you not understand what *context* is?
---
Everything I said makes sense, you just need a brain to comprehend it first.
---
preferences ‚Üí media ‚Üí NSFW Content ‚Üí Hide images for NSFW/18+ content
---
It's on by default, so you turned it off.
---
Oh yeah for sure Nurse is better than Spirit with addons, that's why she is the first one. Freddy has mindgame potential not just for the first hit, he can delay the game and shit-scare survivors with his lullaby, and blood warden is a good perk to stall.
---
Myers is a better M1 killer and a killer overall, he can literally have a wall hack style build, a literal little to none terror radius, and he works well on a lot of maps excluding the ones his wall hack builds are used on. Huntress is slower and she doesn't have the power to expose, Myers has better addons overall too. Plus, her hitboxes are broken as shit.
---
Something should either have super strength or it doesn't. Im sick of the "bUt ThE eNtiTy!" excuse for shit that doesn't make sense in the game. The entity "feeding" off fear and masterminding a game is a lazy way of conveniently giving everything game context even though the lore of this game is horrible, inconsistent, and like 90% speculation. Im hoping the new archives actually has writing above high schooler level.
---
Tier List based on brown/yellow add-ons ( I include these add-ons because they are cheap and easy to get from the bloodweb ) : 1 Nurse, 2 Billy, 3 Spirit, 4 Hag, 5 Huntress, 6 Shape, 7 Wraith, 8 Pig, 9 Doctor, 10 Legion, 11 Plague, 12 Clown, 13 Cannibal 14 Trapper +  Freddy which is getting a rework.
---
If I include green/purple/red add-ons, then Spirit becomes better than Billy, Huntress becomes better than Hag and some other changes happens, but green/purple/red add-ons already change the killer's base kit too much in my opinion, so they shouldn't be taken into consideration in a tier list. Brown and yellow add-ons are again, cheap and common add-ons, plus they don't change too much a killer's base kit, so they can be taken into consideration in my opinion.
---
Legion by far
---
Name checks out.
---
It‚Äôs not fair that the survivors are making their self choice to stay with a status condition of being sick and affected by the sickness ? A sacrifice to make so the killer doesn‚Äôt get powered up? Doesn‚Äôt seem fair or unfair.
---
That is a good point. If a characters whole personality is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gay‚Äù then that‚Äôs just boring. They need to have hobby‚Äôs and things they like, and them being gay is just something to the side that doesn‚Äôt govern an entire character but is a part of them.
---
But that was your choice. If the survivor had called you a dick for not letting them go, that would be fucking ridiculous. Of course killers let survivors get the hatch. I do it whenever I feel like it, but that shouldn't be the expectation. This is a game. Also, a lot of the time when we have these mori games, the killer basically tunnels people straight off the hook leaving people with pitiful bp gain. I should be nice to them? Yeah, no.
---
I mean technically it‚Äôs a Scream dlc and not a Ghostface dlc
---
No add ons: Myers is lower than huntress, hag is higher than Myers in the list. Pig, Freddy, and Doc drop to lowest tier. Clown drops as well. Trapper rises higher than wraith.
---
That's probably the worst comparison I've ever seen, because in no way shape or form was I calling something bad or whatever. I am saying that without context these lists are inaccurate at best. The difference between a spirit with and without prayer beads, for example, is MASSIVE, or the difference between Myers with and without a tombstone. So comparing killers without taking into account all the massive variables just doesn't work. 
---
If you want to rank killers based on no addons, then sure. That list has context. Most people do not have context. But you are still forgetting perk combinations that can make quite a big difference as well (admittedly less than addons though).
---
Eh then petition to have Insidious removed. I don't care. I'm only using him until level 35 anyway for BBQ then moving to a new killer.
---
Key in a chest
---
Try Surveillance on Wraith as a fourth perk, it's pretty good on him.
---
Other great perk would be A Nurse's Calling or even Sloppy Butcher.
---
yeah if identity V can I'm sure dbd could
---
We didn't play tho
---
Yeah, I didn't even notice
---
Huntress has a much better snowball potential.  
---
Huntress with add-ons is more broken than even insta-saw Billy. Huntress' slow speed is there to balance her amazing power(although, now, I don't think she'd be too broken with 115).
---
I don't know how you associate playing Freddy with always running Blood Warden. Being able to slow the game a tad bit isn't that great, honestly; at least Trapper has a chance to insta-down, and cancel loops.
---
I played Overwatch for a few years too so know what it‚Äôs like :‚Äô)
---
Some games are basically the equivalent of hook suicide on the first down at the start of the match because players will just throw in the spawn room if they think the team comp is bad or don‚Äôt get to play the hero they want to one trick (in a game about swapping heroes to counter the enemy team) :‚Äô)
---
Nah definitely leatherface. Legion isn't broken anymore but he is definitely more likable now.
---
Cute art. 
---
Side note: Speedo Quentin when?
---
it needs to be a ghostface skin just sayin
---
Almost positive they will
---
MoM is getting nerfed.  
---
You could've just misplaced the trap, or he Dead Harded through it.
---
You're dumb
---
I wasn't trying to say your adrenaline was OP there, I was just ranting because with a full SFW adrenaline can definitely be broken and require no skill to use. This poor Bubba just got screwed by bad timing.
---
There was no dead hard he simply hugged the wall and my thicc thighs have a larger hitbox apparently
---
Probably a visual bug; the killer DCd in the loading screen and you "escaped" although no one actually played and the game never really started.
---
&gt; Agreement (EULA)
---
To be fair, Tapp is only in the first movie too.
---
Grouchy.
---
Yes, killers have a larger hitbox than survivors; that's a part of what makes looping an actual counter to killers.
---
The best nurse vs. the best survivors and the survivors always win. Lol. Get over your persecution complex,
---
That's what I mean. You have to click to view NSFW content unless you turned it off.
---
Actually a ghostface dlc, not a scream one
---
Devour hope could be buffed by making that 10 second speed buff at 2 tokens a permanent thing
---
I'll let you in on a secret: I always save the Ashes first. No special reason, I just like the character
---
Someone is gonna say something good about legion in the comments.
---
Livin large- if the killer is in the radius of you and another player while said player is cleansing a totem or on a generator, noise and sound cues encourage the killer to go after you 
---
I AM the manager- your employees are your best friends, when being attacked by or chased by the killer your friends and the killers auras are revealed to you
---
Big Chonk- it‚Äôs just MOM with a funny name
---
What the fuck have you brought upon this cursed land
---
Spirit is great, but she‚Äôs not in the same tier as a killer who can teleport and who completely ignores pallets and walls. You can vault a window to put some distance between you and a Spirit, you can‚Äôt do that with Nurse. Nurse is in her own league for that reason imo.
---
The lullaby is not effecting by any terror radius altering perks, just an fyi, it is always 24 meters no matter what
---
I just wish her lunge was smaller. Takes a lot of accuracy out of playing her
---
That dishonor on him, dishonor on his family, dishonor on his cow!
---
I would totally run it. a 350% blood points with bbq and chilli is something this game seriously needs. And no more complaining for NOEDs from the survivors.
---
why is my overpowered perkless addon-less hag a "kill me please"?
---
Yes, John sliced Tapp's troat with it in the first Saw.
---
Platform: Xbox
---
Problem: In Game
---
Issue: When trying to Mori survivors in KYF the animation will start, then jerk toy forward, canceling the mori (with Legion)
---
Chances of Occuring: 100%
---
I MEAN, TECHNICALLY
---
even the name fits
---
**cough**
---
Toxic build
---
I think Hag should be A tier
---
Oh. Thanks, lad.
---
This is obviously a shitpost but I‚Äôll entertain you. For one, you are free to spend your bloodpoints however you want. You don‚Äôt need to play Leatherface in order to level him up. Two, Insidious camping is a good way to get 8k bloodpoints every game, so I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs the best way to level up a Killer.
---
Being canped sucks..
---
It's essentially a staple of DBD at this point
---
No problem, buddy.
---
You are the best friend that has ever lived. Anyone that gives people more Piggy is a great person.
---
I did not need to see this
---
Well, the way the game currently is, it can't even hold a lobby together after a game ends in the public matches, so I imagine that if there were dedicated servers it'd make trading for the game much better. On steam theres the market place/trading system, but on consoles, we don't have that. This sort of stuff is why I'm excited to be migrating to PC
---
I thought you were talking about spirit fury not counting wraiths power. 
---
With wraiths power and spirit fury you have 2 free hits. The free hit on uncloak and the free hit after the first pallet drop. Thats a very quick down from uninjured. Without wraiths power spirit fury only gives you one free hit.
---
being against homophobia equals being against straight people to you?
---
At rank 4, it‚Äôs a must to run that build otherwise it‚Äôs hard to survive. For me it‚Äôs hard honestly, I‚Äôm not the best survivor.
---
Can we see the full body?
---
I wish i could like the Dalton films more, but they were just so meh. Like trying to mix the SRS BSNS of the Connery films with the over the top villains of Moore. He was a great Bond, but his films were lackluster to me. Then Brosnan started off great with Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies, then went completely stupid again.
---
And insta hatches
---
&gt;Or they could be people who don't want homo content in r/deadbydaylight
---
homophobia is literally an aversion to "homos" if you dont want to see "homo content" you are a homophobe. There is tons of straight content on this sub, why can't I say I don't want to see straight content?
---
I just noticed I'd written "trade" and not explicitly said "for bloodpoints"  
---
I meant you'd be able to exchange your offerings and add-ons for in-game bloodpoints, which shouldn't be *that* difficult to implement.
---
No it's not! You're just a big meany entitled survivor for not giving him a free trophy. Fuck the fact that trophies are meant to be earned and lockers are a legitimate way of countering tombstone.
---
They are literally the ones causing the controversy. There wasn't a single negative comment until I pointed out the downvotes
---
They changed that back before it was in the game.
---
&gt;Oh and try to stack up on the add-on‚Äôs that give you a speed boost when you uncloak
---
Sick dude. Congrats
---
Still angry that they don't call the Neon set Joey
---
Then wake up would be useless
---
Nah. When someone is talking about Mulan, i just paste this quote.
---
holy shit i want to try it now
---
Amanda is waif
---
There is nothing wrong with playing an optimal meta build. There is nothing wrong with playing with a coordinated team. There is something wrong with doing all of the above and trash talking opponents for being bad.
---
Don't let people shame you for playing on easy mode but don't shame others for not playing on easy mode either.
---
Than, if you DC you're straight
---
Was the battlepass content given to us? If so, when?
---
The Cannibal smells like BBQ and Chili
---
Honestly the biggest advice you can give to new players, if you're a survivor and a killer is camping, do gens, you can't save the survivor, don't let him die in vain, and if you're a killer, dont camp, and not because camping is "mean" but because if you camp, survivors will just do gens, only low ranking survivors die to camping, so if you camp you'll never get better survivors and you'll never improve
---
lol wow
---
Thank you very much!
---
Alright, anybody else getting sick of the practically identical tier lists?
---
She just got a big clit
---
Sorry. I just get tired of it. The moment someone mentions The Spirit, everyone goes apeshit. They call her thicc and say they wanna smash, like, grow the fuck up people. It gets annoying and I thought you were doing that.
---
I gotcha- and does the DLC add maps or is it just to get new characters?
---
My friend on a hook against a garbage trapper, other 2 survivors already out, Trapper is camping hook to ensure he gets his kill but I have borrowed time so I'm like "ok no worries I'll open the door near to you and we'll get ou- SNAP" 
---
Trap on the gate... He just walked over and shook his head at me... 
---
Was this Trapper you lmao?
---
Absolutely! &lt;3
---
 r/technicallycorrect
---
Thank you so much!
---
Haha, thanks!
---
That's actually not the girl filter lol its the one that gives you the bowl cut and makes your face smushed. The girl filter adds longer more realistic hair and make up. Now im disappointed because I want to see the actual girl filter :(
---
Aww, I'd be happy to give you one. &lt;3
---
BOGO -  skill check success zones are reduced by 20/15/10 percent. Every Great skill check grants a token (max 4) that can be used in place of a good skill check.
---
Price check - unlocks aura reading ability to see nearby gens 5/15/25 meters and percentage of completion
---
The Pallet Jack - upon successful stun of a killer with dropped pallet your scratch marks are invisible for 2/3/5 seconds. Has a cool down of 45 seconds.
---
Can't it be both?
---
Teachable perks are awarded at 30, 35, and 40 that you can use on any survivor or killer respectively. In most cases unless it's a 4 man talking in comms, killers will get at least 1 person if not a 4k. The game has been really balanced around 4 people communicating and working together, 1 person lacking is pretty punishing. Killer is fun if you know what you're doing and dont go against a 4 man stack, if it's a 4 man or the survivors are all good you might get a bit bullied
---
I know they've given dates as to when the account info is taken before, but I don't know if they're going to(or have) this time.
---
Nah, huntress
---
We want it to match the actual perk!
---
Ok so what do you call an unsafe pallet? Thats not a 50/50? Like what do you think the game consists of?
---
That's not because they're good at it but because asymmetrical games (especially 1v4) are limited to... what? Deathgarden, which is another BHVR game?... Evolve?
---
Damn them, I just played two matches today and both of them were AFK. I guess I am going to main the killer for a while.
---
Maps are available to all, but the characters and their perks are restricted to the DLCs themselves and the shop.
---
Actually, no such thing as "better" perks. The bloodweb is completely random. You will get 2 at the same level from 25+ and teachables on 30,35,40. But you can only buy one perk at a level, so choose wisely. Also, think which teachables you want and level up from there.
---
Hunt for ruin in your immediate area, if you don't find it do gens, and if you're traveling somewhere look for ruin on the way
---
Michael Myers smells like straight cologne. Ready to daddy you up at any moment
---
I'll make another one in a few days if you want to. Or you can check it out yourself idk up to you. But yeah sorry I made a mistake it wasn't the girl filter I hope we can agree that he looks like she wants to see a manager though.
---
The problem isn‚Äôt even SWF, but it changes the game GREATLY on the Killer side.

I don‚Äôt mind playing with SWF as the Killer, but some teams are just toxic. They run circles around you, confusing the scratch marks, running toolboxes on gens, or instant heals in the medkits (ran into a group that all 3 had an instant beak), break hooks, body block, dog pile you, flashlight blind you REPEATEDLY, and then butt dance.
---
I won‚Äôt lie, I‚Äôve been salty enough the last couple of weeks to DC right before they exit to just deny them any more points since I‚Äôd gotten all of 2 hooks the entire time. It‚Äôs veru frustrating to go up against
---
only characters and perks, all maps are free, you can buy dlc perks if they show up on the weekly shrine with in game currency also.
---
That's what I do but it's not really fun, BP is cool and all but I didnt buy this game to play generator simulator.
---
Im actually getting more spooky velma vibes here lol
---
I would just wait. You can spend a few like 30k then play game or 2 to get it back.
---
A Nurses calling is one of his very best perks.   You have zero terror radius so it always works. VERY STRONG ON HIM.
---
What I hate about this is that baby Dwights usually go against baby killers, so the killers don't know that its a baby Dwight and kill them. Feels bad man :(
---
Killer can be annoying but that's only when you reach about green ranks and lower. Also, every month on the 13th there is a rank reset that sets a lot of the good survivors into the lower ranks, which will most likely be frustrating.
---
What about doom engravings, death engravings, moonshine, and spike boots?
---
LMFAO that meg, freddy just stood perfectly still and stared at the window and she just fucking vaulted into him for no reason, omega 1000 iq freddy mind game am I right
---
There are wireless ones that you can charge, they connect via Bluetooth. It's the same as wireless mice.
---
Cmon just make his story so that right before he bled out he was saved and captured by the entity or something
---
&gt; it's definitely a hitbox issue too tho
---
no no its not
---
&gt;lol I've played against Nurses who have told me they had no idea how certain things have hit when the animation of M1'ing was already done and the survivor gets hit by the thin air
---
 oh in that case...nope its still not a hitbox issue, and thats not proof in the slightest.
---
This thimble is a good drinking glass. Fills up quickly.
---
Who do you play?  And what perks do you use?  Maybe we can help.
---
Heeeey. My man might not be very good but I love him and you can pry playing him from my cold dead hands
---
Getting stuck is a part of improvement.  
---
Learn how to slug and play tiles more efficiently. Learn how to mind-game better survivors.  
---
I recommend running Ruin if you feel like gens are getting done too fast.
---
You know that hatch was kind of bullshit, you only got it because the meg dced, and dcing to open hatch is exploiting, not your fault of course, you can't control meg, but it's still bullshit for freddy
---

---
I just realized how wrong that sounds. Or how right. üòâ
---
Can u share the background (template) of the perks u used for spirit? I really like that, it's outstanding and I want to use it for my favourite perks. I just created a reddit account to ask this :)
---
It‚Äôs happened before but rarely. And after every game you need to make a new lobby. Just make a lobby and then they can right click your name on steam and join your lobby
---
Damn talking about making her over powered
---
I think she‚Äôs fine as is honestly as those who do not wanna cleans are a one hit down
---
It doesnt happen that often, in fact never occured to me. For the bonus question yes you have to invite them but at 3 year anniversry devs actually said they are going the change that so you can end up in the same queue with your friends. ( I actually submitted a ticket on that one)
---
If your the obsession and you dont have any obsession perks its pretty obvious that the killer is either going to tunnel you or completely ignore you to get stacks.
---
I think the insta-heals, as well as other survivor and killer add-ons, should be changed. However, I don‚Äôt see how using mechanics/tactics like breaking hooks, confusing scratch marks, and body blocking is toxic. Butt dancing is toxic, sure, so is unwarranted trash talking. It‚Äôs extremely annoying, such as NOED and Moris, but not toxic imo.
---
Like, when I am a survivor and the exit gates spawn on the same in-game wall I can‚Äôt blame the killer for using the mechanics of the game to keep running between them. Sure, it‚Äôs extremely annoying, but that‚Äôs the fault of the game not them.
---
Left out in the sun

Hairy shirtless David with shorts and tattoos. Make this happen people.
---
Spirit actually smells like dead.
---
Same can be said for eye strain, but you are supposed to take a break.
---
And you don't have to mash it too hard, nor do you have to always have your wrist in the same position the whole struggle phase. Switch hands too, because you don't always need to be looking around.
---
When hooking a survivor for the third time he should be able to do this and the thumbs up when he moris last survivor.
---
probably still legion
---
my vote is for bubba
---
What addons i should use for nurse? For Example Pocket Watch + Bad Man Keepsake?
---
Only the first few times you face them.
---
Plague's chaser is still broken too
---
i think spirit and billy would change their places and other than that no problem for me
---
probably going for BK myers but didnt quite get it right
---
Playing killer is like running a Daycare full of babies who cry and piss their pants constantly. Playing survivor is so boring I'm watching a movie on a 2nd monitor if I'm on a gen.
---
Actually it's a DBD dlc, not a scream DLC
---
It's still a worrisome topic.
---
People shouldn't have to actually hurt themselves just because of a game mechanic.
---
Though I don't know for sure I feel like that should almost be a law issue.
---
It needs to be changed. Sure it shouldn't have to be fun necessarily. But it shouldn't be a threat to health.
---
Yes I am taking it that serious.
---
DON'T TOUCH MY BOI
---
That wasn't what I was refering to in my message.
---
&gt;any mindgame made by the killer forces the survivor to pay attention to them, I don't really agree that it is the survivor who's in charge.
---
I am clearly refering to mindgames around loops &amp; obstactles. It is the killer that sets up a mindgame (unless we're talking about window fakes), and the survivor has to react accordingly. In that situation the killer is in charge.
---
 Your message refers to leading the chase, in which I agree the survivor is responsible for. The killer only decides the direction of the chase when they decide from which side they break the pallet.
---
A trick I learned at Rank 1 is to put an obvious trap next to an actual hidden trap. They disarm and run only to get snagged a few steps later. I've gotten some brutal anger from people.
---
ive had that happen to me before, kinda annoying but just leave and reinvite your friend, not that big a deal
---
and yes you have to reinvite after every game
---
Honestly? Rusty shackles Hag makes me insta die.
---
yea youre right. but he's got the closest thing that isnt actually bk myers
---
Sweet thx
---
Summon Da Bunny
---
Eh yeah I just wish after it would send you to the same lobby
---
Not sure, I just found it with spirit.
---
Im pretty sure it doesnt work for licensed characters.
---
Nah, bunny David: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYJgkFf9ZRg
---
Not true. I didn't know you weren't supposed to cleanse. I do now, lol.
---
It's like when you're hungry and you go look in the fridge, but there's nothing there so you go and sit back down. Then ten minutes later you're still hungry so you look in the fridge again, but there's still nothing.
---
Yessss!!!!
---
Yeah in the description it says I didn't realise it was running out.
---
Don't worry, you have to DC a ridiculous number of games to get banned.
---
Because that's when the shrine resets, but it never knows if it's going to be good, it presents that the shrine is most likely gonna be bad, like this one was

There was one brain cell between all of them

Nah sorry I don‚Äôt.

For my reference, I just used google, playing the game and watching a game played as Wraith so I could pause the video when he used the bell.

This model I have currently wouldn‚Äôt be optimised for the game engine

Story-wise... was she beautiful and men in the village still didn't want her? Or was she plain or ugly? I know you said the story was the weak point in your write up, but I was just curious.
---
Phhh I think that‚Äôs me as the doctor üòÇ. What map was it?
---
Matchmaking, amirite. 
---
NOED is realllly not good on Huntress, encourages M1 when you should be chucking them Hatchy bois. The extra speed might be enticing, but if you are trying to catch up to survivors you aren't using Huntress to her maximum potential.
---
 I'd suggest swapping it out for Sloppy, it's gonna help slow the game down for you and makes them easier to track, AND it applies to your Hatchets, even though it specifically says it doesn't. Even on the wikis.
---
Might want to also try running Nurse's if you have it, and Monitor is okay at your rank but when you get up to higher ranks it becomes less effective. It doesn't effect the lullaby radius, just the heartbeat. Could use Shadowborn instead if you like the wider FOV, as you will have it all the time and it is wider..er. Helps with Hatchet accuracy.
---
Ideally you would also run a perk to slow down gens, like Ruin or Lullaby, but if you don't want to do totems, might I suggest Thanataphobia? Slowing the game down, just a little bit, will help make up for your slow ass movement speed.
---
Also, if you are getting looped to death by a good survivor, just break off. Patrol gens, find the weakest link, and pick em off one at a time.
---
Source: Digusting PC P3 Huntress Main.
---
My go-to: Ruin, Sloppy, Nurses, BBQ(for points) or Thanataphobia(for maximum Salt)
---
Good addons: Haft (any of them), Shiny Pin, Manna Grass Braid, Leather Loop, Deerskin (don't use if you run Iron Maiden), Babushka, Belt, and of course, Iri Head. Ideally you'd be using some combo of these every game. All of the other ones are literally useless with good perks, except maybe Yew Seed Concoction, but again, you don't really care about catching up to the survivors, you just wanna hatchet them in the back.
---
Happy Hunting!
---
To be fair, you can make most killers sound good based on description.
---
"They run at base speed but can use their power to go even faster, apply a bleed-out timer, and vault pallets!"
---
"He can run extremely fast to cover ground quickly and turn invisible while masking his stain and terror radius!"
---
Until we see hard numbers and exact powers, I wouldn't say anything about his viability.
---
I don't think you can learn something from No0b3. He's fun to watch, yes, but nothing I'd recommend *new* players.
---
Monto at least explains the perks he uses, before a match.
---
Oh thank god. I'm kind of afraid to play rn. I checked my connection and it seems fine. I'm just too paranoid. Maybe in a few hours it will stop being weird, and I can play in games again without me being disconnected on the fly.
---
Pleaseeeee bhvr we all want Carl!!!!
---
I mean, at least our devs care about the competitive side and we get real tournaments with real world money as prize
---
PLEASE ADD HIM BHVR
---
I was pissed because I thought this was supposed to be a survivor perk at first. I like it conceptually.
---
You asked how I would respond if someone said they said they didn‚Äôt want black.
---
That‚Äôs how I‚Äôd respond.
---
Also, you mind telling me how I‚Äôm homophobic? I can‚Äôt wait to hear this one
---
I'm fairly certain theres a hit box issue on pallets. Like those situations where dropping a pallet would kill you on a swing but keeping on running wouldnt. It's like your hitbox is in the middle of the pallet when you drop it (which made sense back when pallet vacuum existed) but now it feels like dropping a pallet causes your hitbox to actually move backwards towards the center of the pallet.
---
Me when I try to do anything
---
This is correct, the forum post mentions that all licensed characters are excluded - even Ash
---
I'd rather have Sidney Prescott tbh, but since they probably can't get hold of her license then I'll take Carl, thank you very much.
---
Then it's just borrowed time. Pretty noticable nerf.
---
Plus the killer can just run along with you and not hit you for 20 seconds if you obviously let them hit you to activate ds.
---
They don't really have the infrastructure to handle banning quitters.
---
For console, you must report via the report icon and also report it in the forums. Nobody goes through that effort.
---
hell ye
---
yes, my community doesnt need to unnecessarily apply lgbt qualities to video game characters. without knowing theyre gay , trans , bi, whatever, its completely unnecessary to apply those traits.
---
well you have to be running that direction for at least 2.5 meters
---
KILLER QUEEN HAS ALREADY TOUCHED THIS GENERATOR.
---
this is the right wing hate you spread to other people?
---
Ordinarily, I think I would agree with you.
---
I *think*. This team was definitely doing all of that, and normally after the match, I just DC and go "Take your points and leave".
---
The problem was, they were up my ass the WHOLE game, spending time to catch my attention by running in circles, and that whole shebang.
---
Then on top of all that, two of them sent friend requests...one guy was polite enough, the other wanted to talk trash. It was kind of pathetic, all told...and earned him a steam report for abusing the system.
---
I‚Äôm actually pleasantly surprised this wasn‚Äôt another nerf NOED thread. Pretty refreshing to see someone voice concern over the other stuff for once.
---
Yea I do agree those perks, along with many others, do need some love.
---
If I see two altruistic players, one of which is teabagging and running in the opposite direction, I know the other guy is trying to make the rescue. If I stay, I keep 3 people "hooked" because the 2 people who are free don't want to leave. So yes, "DoN't bE sO aLtRuIsTiC, LeT mE lEaVe ThE hOoK."
---
Fantstic. Great screen shot too.   
---
Goddamn it I had rats in this game.  
---
One time I had one gen left and the asshole was pointing and leading the killer to me all around the map.
---
Enduring and brutal strength are definitely going on the grocery list
---
I believe games should have more at stake, so players cared more and games could be more intense, no one really cares, everyone dcs instantly the moment things aren't going good for them.
---
Price Check would actually be a quite nice perk, just for the ability to see percentage of completion.
---
actually yk what , sure i‚Äôd post this on something depicting the characters as straight . unless its proven in lore it‚Äôs unnecessary. a sexuality doesnt really define someone anyways, so why apply any sexuality without proof or lore
---
Looking at The Game, Wreckers
---
What about being hit through the pallet? What do you have to say about pallets hit boxes huh?
---
&gt;Also, you mind telling me how I‚Äôm homophobic? I can‚Äôt wait to hear this one
---
did you not read every single comment I posted in reply to you? you quite literally defended people "who dont want to see homo content" - ie blatant homophobes. Then you claim that all the DBD characters are straight because their sexuality is not identified. 
---
Someone who isn't homophobic would not be posting these comments. Source: all normal non hateful human beings
---
and the comercial center as a map and then we have a real chapter
---
So its just as unnecessary to claim they are straight correct?
---
Dr. Donna and Tennant made the absolute fucking best pairing in all of Dr. Who history. CHANGE MY MIND
---
its unnecessary to apply any sexuality . sexuality shouldnt define a video game character either way
---
For survivir I'd say start with David king, his perk "we're going to live forever" is great for earning bloodpoints. Just avoid no mither.
---
It‚Äôs from all the farming
---
Look man, I can tell you right now if you‚Äôd bait me to a locker with your loafer and then smack me with Head On, you‚Äôd get the hatch.
---
*Exposed*
---
Dude that's a pretty cool idea, but 5 points for spine chill? Why you dissing spine chill like that smh, the perk literally counters the entire powers of some killers.

No such thing as neutral, I suppose.

So what is it called when you don‚Äôt support a marginalizing group?

You don‚Äôt look that bad for someone who‚Äôs new. But then again you age going against new survivors also

"Why does everyone play billy? I wish sweaty killers would have more variety"

Bad mask, wrong knife.

You know not all survivor who T-bag are that stupid and will stand an inch away from leaving right?
---
Nono. Its just that the ptb takes a "photo" of your acount some days/hours before it releases, but it doesnt affects your normal account in any sense. I just wonder if its always the same amount of hours because I have the bp cap and I wanna prestige my beloved plague :3
---
you arent saying you dont like it, youre saying it shouldnt be posted. if you werent homophobic you would look at the content and say "okay random post i dont care" like im sure you do with most posts in /new. but you obviously *care* that this was posted. you are *upset* that someone is making content with the goal of empowering gay people. you are actively trying to stop the content that is empowering LGBT people and that is worse than just being homophobic
---
You clearly got outplayed.
---
Wtf...
---
&gt;So what is it called when you don‚Äôt support a marginalizing group?
---
Thought I looked cute. Might delete later I dunno.
---
Um... excuse me what?
---
Yes.
---
Thanks! Dev time as in EST?
---
This is why NOED is the most important perks in the game.
---
Make her dead again please
---
Yea, but they have been known to drop patches earlier. I don‚Äôt remember when, I think Legion??? I woke up at like 6am pst and ptr was out
---
Oh, you want me to guess? Hmm 
---
If you support LGBT groups, you‚Äôre pro-LGBT
---
If you support anti-LGBT groups, you‚Äôre anti-LGBT
---
If you support neither, surprise, you‚Äôre neutral
---
did you even read my comment?
---
It might be you disconnecting. Since Plague, there's been a bug where you're kicked from the match and it shows that the killer disconnected, but everyone else is still in the game. You can tell by whether or not you got 5000 escape points.
---
Escape points = Killer disconnected
---
No escape points = You were kicked
---
I think either you‚Äôre unlucky or yea it‚Äôs subjective. I play 50/50 and I definitely encounter a lot of killer BM too (like spam hitting you on the hook). Camping I think is absolutely toxic unless it‚Äôs the last survivor and the gates are open, or you know they‚Äôre all around the hook. But camping when there‚Äôs still 5 gens left? Nah, unless you‚Äôre super new the only people that do that do it to ruin someone else‚Äôs game, because at that point you‚Äôre literally not doing your objective as killer by camping. 
---
I‚Äôve been told to kill myself and get cancer etc by killers. Just loads of nasty shit. And as I said earlier, I play nicely to everyone. I think it just doesn‚Äôt feel as bad when you‚Äôre playing survivor to be on the receiving end of toxicity. Oh and I‚Äôve had PLENTY of ‚Äúgg ez‚Äù when killers have won.
---
Again I think it just doesn‚Äôt feel as bad because you‚Äôre in a team of four others. When I play killer and people are toxic in post game chat it feels so much worse. But I don‚Äôt think it happens more. At least from my own (subjective) experience.
---
Imagine running Bitter Murmur and you just see one fucking aura go launching
---
What you're saying doesn't make any sense, this is like saying a gun isn't dangerous, because 4 guns is more dangerous. What? MoM is op simple as that. Don't need to argue about it either it's getting nerfed.
---
I did, however I didn‚Äôt agree with it, so I added my thoughts into it 
---
(Funny how a two-sided argument works like that)

So what part of the hypothetical situation I described do you disagree with?
---
Are two perks dedicated to purely countering pallets worth it though?
---
Would be a shame if someone were to... ***cleanse it.***
---
4D chess.
---
yes, i am saying it shouldnt be posted . a controversial topic such as the lgbt community shouldn‚Äôt be posted on a place about a video game. i do care that this kind of stuff is being posted. lgbt topics aren‚Äôt necessary in a whole different subreddit. if u wanna complain abt how homophobic people are for not wanting something about a controversial topic to be posted on something about a video game, go to the lgbt sub and write abt how shitty of a person i am. and the fact that you think lgbt needs to be *empowered* is horrible. do you not want to be equal with non lgbt members? or do you want to be better than them? i really dont understand how not liking this kind of content on this sub is homophobic. if i wanted gay content i‚Äôd go to the lgbt sub?
---
O fuk its a Scarlet Macaw, the official bird of Venezuela, my 2nd favourite birb ( o v o)
---
If they slug you and refuse to hook you ever then you're good for the rest of the game? That's a pretty big nerf to the slugging strat and one stupid killer if they're going to let somebody go just in case they might stun them for 5 seconds.
---
If the killer runs along you for 20 seconds and you can't find a pallet or a window to loop them around then that's on you or your teams lack of pallet management.
---
Sorry. I have no idea what that was or how that happened. I wasn't even on my phone when it posted.
---
I love him too, he‚Äôs  a noob stomper. However, he‚Äôs just not a great killer chase wise.
---
Thank you! I did it in Photoshop mostly, reused the font that's used in-game along with some other stuff.

The fact that you used a gunpoint situation to describe our argument. The fact that you implied that all neutral people (bystanders) would do nothing while someone is about to be shot.
---
You‚Äôre trying to bloat this situation to an extreme using a very situational hypothetical
---
fan art literally gets posted all the time. this is just dead by daylight fan art. what do you not like about this art that you dont see in other fan arts?
---
4PM UTC IIRC
---
Ive never gotten a hate message from a killer, survivors on the other hand...
---
Sounds being buggy pretty often doesn't change the fact that you have to be banking on her not hearing you.
---
The time it usually drops
---
How is it horribly innaccurate when this stat came straight from the devs, it was released maybe 5 or 6 weeks ago. I‚Äôm not making it up. 3-6 %, with 3% being PS4 and 6% being PC. It is a very common thing for killers to believe they are facing a 4 man SWF whenever the survivors do well. People like Tru3 play a pretty big role in that I think. If you don‚Äôt want to believe the stat, nothing else I can say, but it‚Äôs a fact.
---
I just realised with the picture of the knife you basically gave us a joey crotch shot.
---
Not complaining just throwing that out there
---
No thank you

I rather play with someone without his caps lock button broken

What creepypasta is this from

"Well" "I mean"
---
To be fair I think Dying Light is a pretty bullshit perk. You have to get one player out of the game as fast as possible and it leads to frustration for both the killer (You tunnel-vision the obsession and he loops you, or you facecamp him as gens are done anyway) and survivor (Nobody likes being facecamped or tunnel-Mori'd off the hook and making generators even slower is boring) 
---
[This rework](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/buev90/dying_light_better_for_both_sides/?st=jwgzn0dw&amp;sh=c0933760) by /u/SameAsGrybe would be a great idea to make it so a survivor can "Opt in" to become the Dying Light for the healing bonus while still allowing the killer to manually activate it even if nobody takes up the task if he hooks everyone once.

Can sabotage a gen but only for the first minute of a game and gens take 80 seconds to complete...

Did you think this through?

You got premier pro but cant do a proper audio balance or cut the boring parts or even put gifs on a decente scale
---
Did this in a game yesterday. 5 gens left, 3 hook states gone, ruin up...
---
It worked. We all escaped on basically deathhook. Syringe OP.
---
That goes against the rules tho
---
One it‚Äôs decent and like I said it‚Äôs my first time. But thanks for the advice
---
The way she goes.
---
Can survivors pass the lantern once it is taken from the basement or are you the Dying Light for the rest of the match? I.E. if someone's on deathhook, can they pass it on to another survivor like a relay race or are you 100% committed to being the Dying Light once you take it from basement?

fanart typically has a purpose of applying romantic/sexual ideas, or just pictures of the person, not applying sexualities for no reason. i get the idea of making gay fanart of two characters kissing or whatever, but just to apply sexualities with no proof or lore evidence isnt ok. i hate to break it to you and i hate to say it myself but being straight is the norm and i guarantee these characters are straight. without any lore evidence everyone is gonna just kinda think theyre straight. its heteronormativity and its never gonna go away.

From some screenshots a friend of mine sent me, the OP is literally going round in a Discord talking about me and claiming that I'm harassing him when he's the one who has screenshotted my comments to try and stir up some more drama and rally people behind him. Petty? Even if I was being a bit petty to begin with, *THAT* is being petty. I'm not exactly sure what makes him think I'm harassing him, but he honestly cannot say he posted a screenshot of reddit comments under the sound assumption no one would seek out my comments to come and throw more hate at me.
---
also nurse
---
I mean it has potential to cut chases pretty short, so I‚Äôd say yes
---
Im tired of this useless posts
---
Op can simply go to discord or the playstation groups and find someome there
---
meg main big brain
---
Right now 19, not great lol, played on PC before, just starting on PS4, so I know what I‚Äôm doing just haven‚Äôt played much on PS4
---
Run it with Haunted Grounds and make sure you find someone in the first minute.

ill be on next bloodhunt or so
---
19, switched from PC to PS4, I know the game very well just haven‚Äôt played enough on PS4
---
Lol. That was a good one.
---
why are you so offended about this? they wanted to put lgbt flags on them because its their art and they can do whatever they want. there is literally 0 reason to get upset about this unless you are offended by lgbt existence
---
Any time I bring more than one perk dedicated to countering a situation it almost never happens. But when it works it‚Äôs sweet.
---
Entity? How are you? Are you hiring killers today? Oh great, I will be down in a momentarily to fill up a application.
---
&gt; The fact that you implied that all neutral people (bystanders) would do nothing while someone is about to be shot.
---
Vault points are not really unlimited, and being near the window and getting hit is fine but being 10 feet and getting hit is BS.
---
There's no such thing as toxic build lol
---
What happened there?  How could they *all* miss the EGC running out?
---
Gotcha gotcha, just let me know!
---
He‚Äôs in one of the games too, isn‚Äôt he?
---
actually please dont reply any further. theres no reason for me to continue this conversation. rot in hell
---
it‚Äôs an addon for the Map items, a marker of sorts. It is rarely used which is why you‚Äôve never seen it until now.
---
It's a map add on.
---
Let's other survivors know of potential items of interest i.e. a gen or the hatch.
---
Oh ok. I've played almost 600 hours and have never seen that before. Weird.
---
if you want equality for gay and straight people then you would support lgbt empowerment. if you want lgbt people to stay where they are on the social ladder you don't belong in the lgbt movement
---
I refuse to acknowledge DR4's existence. At the very least I don't consider it to be canon. It helps with the pain.
---
Learn that not only will you suffer from your mistakes but sometimes those of your teammates. Be prepared to placed on a team of complete numbskulls
---
And positioning the Survivor in such a way to prevent a locker is a legitimate way of countering lockers. Stop being a fucking hypocrite child.
---
I had an idea for Dying Light that I really liked. When they die, any completed gen gets undone. That's less obnoxious than the speed reduction, and also makes it so you're less likely to find that person and kill them before any sort of progress can be made at all. The benefit is that the obsession's aura is permanently revealed to every other survivor. So if they see them get injured or hurt, they can run to try to take chase, and their Aura is the 'light' essentially.
---
If the gates are opened/powered, much like now the kill does nothing for the killer.
---
Yeah I've played hundreds of hours too and never seen one either, people don't seem to use it. It's a bit useless really, I guess you could use it to mark where the hatch is but beyond that I don't see a use for it.
---
If you can't make out their name on the loddy screen, you can press pause/option or whatever button it is on your platform and it gives you the name of the survivors and what offerings.
---
..what?
---
I didn't delete, friend. It's still there.
---
Love this! Great work!
---
I believe they reduced bloodpoint prices on killers to incentivize players toward playing the killer.

Happened to my wife last night.
---
I play swf with my wife, and another couple, and she was the last one out......and did exactly this.
---
We all knew what happened, and she knew she was being a dumbass.
---
She says "Well, that was just stupid."
---
She knew she deserved it.
---
We moved on, laughing at her internally, but silent on the outside. 
---
She knew.
---
What's your average rank per season on PC?
---
I'm usually rank 5-4, occasionally 3. Dwight main.
---
That looks awesome! Great work!
---
God damn you. I hate you. *angry oinks*
---
This. So much this.
---
What are his perks? Davey Jones Locker better be something that'll make Dwight cry!
---
we shouldnt need empowerment honestly. equality would be nice sure, but we dont need to be equal to feel valid. the lgbt community (aside from many the trans community) has equal opportunities in near everything. we shouldnt need to feel empowered . we should feel like we‚Äôre valid. our community isnt going to be equal ever no matter how hard we try. we dont need straights‚Äô opinion to feel okay with ourselves
---
Are you asking if you'll be able to still buy the teachable perk for that character if you don't buy it when it's first available to you? For example:
---
First time playing Nea, you reach the first level to unlock Streetwise to be teachable to other survivors but instead of buying it you go for other stuff &amp; then you keep leveling up. 
---
Is that what you're kinda asking? 
---
Regardless, if i was wrong or not, I know you'll be able to unlock teachable perks regardless what level. Haha.
---
#KILLER QUEEN HAS ALREADY TOUCHED THIS GENERATOR
---
The biggest "Darn" look ever when you look back at him while peacing out.
---
well if you're fine being viewed as lesser by society thats on you, but the line is drawn when you attempt to stop others from changing that. you are actively contributing to lgbt oppression just because you personally aren't affected by it. continue being an asshole
---
Dave was so stern about him not being in the game... like fuck, it's not that serious my dude lmao
---
I use it just to fuck with people. Im glad to see everyone here doesnt know what it is.
---
That sounds pretty good
---
Every time devs changed something regarding emblems, they updated the ELI5.
---
I mean you are.
---
im fine with who i am because i dont use other people‚Äôs opinions to make myself feel valid. im confident and feel powerful by myself. but you continue being the reason the non-lgbt community despises us. and sorry im not soft and dont share the same feelings as you , and dont get pissed when we dont have representation in a video game. &lt;3
---
I mean, here's the rundown.
---
I lost all hope for this game, I don't like this subreddit, nobody agrees on anything anyway, I'm cynical as fuck, and I like to meme on everything that I lose all care for.
---
So, I am going to meme on all y'alls
---
Sweet, thanks.
