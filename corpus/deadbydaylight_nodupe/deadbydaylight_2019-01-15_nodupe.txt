The new killer is the Muffin Man his weapon is a sharpened baguette and the new map is that street in Paris. 
---
---
---
I like this idea along with giving him Trapper or Stitched Bag as a base part of his kit. And can I just add that DW status off self-trap rescues sounds more engaging and fair compared to Legion's whole schtick?
---
What the hell Michael?
---
I think this isn't as nightmareish as "Taking one for the team". With 500+h of gameplay I only got 
---
#180/250.
---

---
To actually unlock it in a reasonable time you would literally have to play like crap and be an antimate by bodyblocking every hook.
---
Probably that one and "Left for Dead" are the hardest achievements to get.
---
I dont get why people keep saying that either. Bloodhound makes it super easy to get people. People dont play around bloodhound at all and the only counter is No Mither actually so its hilarious. You can frenzy hit and then you stare at the ground and follow the blood to break chase and then catch them when they stop to mend. Its so broken on Legion.
---
Or you can do this while waiting for a game once you reach rank 1 and queues are a killer. Will probably print it and put it below my TV. Or even try wall sitting all game. Man you gonna make me look like Shirtless David.
---
Lol. Could have picked a Kate that was wearing the same outfit. 
---
I bet you are going to love when PTB hits live.
---
Are you sure this is the case for the achievement on PC?

*Incoherently mumbles* "You're really gonna like it here, the meat is real fresh!"
---
Not worth it. HG isn't such a great perk.
---
There should be a 33% chance of them getting ruin, but I find its more like 50-60%.
---
Plus normallt when they do activate it I'm normally in a chase and have already injured the person. The rest just go immersed at that point.
---
Even just actually getting downs without Frank's mix tape with feral frenzy was going to be a chore, but this is gonna take even longer to actually get. It's the only one I'm missing atm, but I am not looking forward to that grind.
---
For this game? Adept Clown (0.2%). 
---
Of all time? Probably the Evolve Platinum Trophy (0.1%)
---
Oh, my bad, I kept hearing that looping was toxic and that looping is just bad gameplay. Like vault and pallet looping. It feels like my only option to live a lot of the time. 
---
I throughly agree with everything you say here. 
---
nope
---
my first hook was generally a few seconds
---
She wasn't in the base game (technically an add on) and therefore has separate trophies from the base game.  You can get platinum without any progress on the licensed DLC, curtain Call, Darkness Among Us, etc.
---
a button works otherwise
---
Why 2 exhaustion perks? 
---
Crosshairs don't actually help with anything besides long range shots and whether or not those actually hit is on the survivor not being oblivious, so, no, not at all.
---
Please stop running tuft and tombstone, it takes waaay too long to get to tier 3, and even then, you’re at 106% MS. It’s better to just run Tombstone Piece and Memorial for the one or maybe 2 kills to trigger Dying Light, even then it’s an ehhhh
---
crosshairs essentially do nothing for short/medium range shots. only helps with better consistency of distance shots. so i agree with you.
---
...why?
---
Your tits are more visible than your face, gotta get them horny teenagers to click on it
---
I like it but as a legion main this hurts me lol
---
It's not a 3rd party program. Ever hear of monitors with built-in crosshairs?
---
Meg is the killer not Nea 
---
I mean by that Token you can Run deliverance instead, and get a guaranteed unhook if you rescue someone. 
---
Not even sure why I'm even being downvoted when it's the truth lol, classic Reddit 
---
Not really.
---
This isn't Tombstone, Pinky, or Iridescent Head. He's not OK without them and OP with them.
---
He's shit without them and decent with them.
---
Without Iri Stone, you can negate Trapper's power entirely by simply communicating and having somebody take out his bear traps.
---
Without Honing Stone, long range traps are meaningless and short range traps can be rendered meaningless if you're not lucky.
---
With both of those add ons, Trapper's power is always going to be punishing and you can no longer negate it. This isn't enough to make it OP, it's just barely enough to make it not shit.
---
I think Im missing some context 
---
I can change the PNGs in my game files too
---
Okay grandpa it's always the new generation it can't be just some people  who are impatient regardless of age.
---
I don’t directly check my totem because rank one players aren’t stupid they know if I’m going to check somewhere that has no gens that I must be checking a totem, as billy I’ll whip but it quick so that it’s just barley in whispers range (I’ve used it long enough to know almost exactly what 32 meters is) and if whispers turns on then I’ll check, if not I keep sawin by as If that was the plan 
---
Myers and Pig both give me spooks! Equivalent to the hag traps (that you miss because of BUSH!) 😬😬 
---
It’s been like that for as long as I can remember.
---
Now you can only escape with the trap on via the hatch, or IIRC you can actually escape through the exit gates with the trap on if the Pig puts it on after you’ve already passed the point where you’ll usually die.
---
r/woooosh?
---
This is so sad. Start a go fund me, I will donate for you to get some lasik. 
---
Well what if someone wants to run small game?
---
We ask them politely but firmly to leave
---
Noo :(( 
---
Sloppy Butcher with Thanataphobia right or with Hex Ruin?
---
It’s a long time issue that hasn’t been addressed. Sadly nothing you can do about it unless you stop at every pallet to see if you get the prompt to destroy the trap. 
---
Super annoying lol
---
It's okay if you think not having a dot in the middle of your screen makes you somehow a better Huntress player, but saying you "have **infinitely** more respect" for those that don't use it is what made me get a bit heated, because it's a small part of being a good Huntress, and you seem to think it's like a huge deal. It's your opinion anyway, so sorry if I sounded mad or anything lol.
---
Also, as I said, 95%+ of Zubat's playtime as Huntress he didn't use crosshair, if that matters to you.
---
No it's literally physically impossible for some programs for example, "custom desktop logo" it just puts an overlay on your screen completely and not just for DBD therefore it does not edit files at all and has LITERALLY 0 chance of getting you banned.
---
Clarity
---
Lunch is not an escape. 
---
&gt; Enjoy your DC
---
Oh, I will. I'm sure your survivor friends will, too. Salt like yours only fuels me.
---
I agree with what you said with jeff, his perks makes coordination easier in solo q.
---
In the other hand, i highly dissagree with the legion stuff. He sucks if played as intended and is uncounterable if cheesed.  Moonwalking and 4 stabbing will guarantee a down and the survivor cant do anything about it, at least nurse can be outjuked and takes skill
---
Sure
---
BigWilly_17
---
Iron Strength is ok, I will be okay is broken and the third one is literally just autodidact
---
I mean behavior dont listen most of the time unless there is actually noticable problems. I mean look at the October event and the shit show that was. After you got the vials you didn't play anymore, because everyone even after getting the vials were farming bloodpoints. There were no actual real games. Then it took them what a like a week to finally change it so you can get all 6 vials as either side. DC is only going to stop when behavior actually does something. That most likely won't be until the summer or some time after the dedicated servers.
---
make Devour hope, huntress’ lullaby and third seal unlit until they come into play
---
Keep in mind that you can use Infantry Belt (or whatever it's called) to increase the number of *instant downing hatchets* to three.
---
I play spirit pretty often, my build is generally this:
---
BBQ &amp; Chilli
---
Devour Hope
---
Haunted Grounds
---
Save the best for last
---
Everyone expects you to have haunted grounds as spirit so they unwittingly end up not cleansing devour hope (usually) before it's too late.
---
Shut up bitch 
---

Whatever happened to "I’m not going to waste my time"? You're still here failing to convince anyone that isn't a killer main that chat counts as "cheating".  
---
And no, the reason, as I already stated (twice), is because a vast chunk of players will stop playing, and they'll lose future profit because of it. You think Killer lobbies are bad now? It'll be so much worse if people start getting banned for using a chat app.   
---
Do you see how both of these parts in your last post contradict each other?  
---
"The reason it’s not a bannable offense"  
---
"but it is cheating."  
---
You concede that voice communication is not against the rules, but still stamp your feet in anguish claiming that it is. You are fighting a lost battle. 
---
yeah this has been happening quite a bit lately. During my trapper games I sometimes see a trap randomly clip under the map or into walls/objects whenever I grab a survivor at a weird place like a slope/stairs or a ledge.
---
[Example during one of puppers games, watch at 12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsJCj78QEUw&amp;t=1227s)
---
*Uno reverse card*
---
I say either leave it alone or take it out there is no in between for me seeing as how I don't have problems with these perks.
---
Freddy way OP. He kicks my ass all the time. 
---
But he’ll still lose. It takes too long to down a single survivor. I’ll agree that he needs counterplay. After connecting an attack in frenzy, maybe a stun for a whiffed second stab? Allowing for a crafty survivor to juke. It’d be harder than usual certainly but not impossible.
---
As it stands If you understand how legion’s vision works in frenzy you can juke him. But it’s not much and if he’s running a good build he’ll probably find you unless you’re running iron will. 
---
But with that fix allowing for more counterplay, I think he’d be a solid killer.
---
"Lunch is Not an escape"
---
They are silent until they come into play, you don’t get a hex notif until hit when third seal is active and you don’t know about DH until 3 (or 4 I can’t remember) 
---
Lullaby on the other hand needs to be changed 
---
Also yeah Jeff is a real solo q lifesaver.
---
Make Vigil so that you and your nearby allies recover from exhaustion faster and also while running (if you are not in a chase).
---
Give No one left behind the ability to show every survivor's aura to all other survivors once the exit gates are powered. Plus the usual effect.
---
Make Detective's hunch show all remaining totems on the map for 5 seconds after you repaired a generator.
---
Make Left Behind so that you become 20% more quiet every time someone is sacrificed (that includes breathing, grunts of pain and screams). Plus the usual repair bonus.
---
Give Wake up a 40% speed bonus while opening gates. And make it reveal you aura to other survivors also while you are inside the exit gate area.
---
~
---
Make Monstrous shrine so that it also gives the blindness status effect to survivors hooked in the basement.
---
Increase Pop Goes the Weasle's timer to 60 seconds after hooking someone.
---
Make Predator also increase the time it takes for scratchmarks to fade away.
---
Make Knockout unaffected by perks like bond, empathy or openhanded.
---
Its pretty much god complex
---
I would make monstrous shrine give you extra bloodpoints for hooking people in the basement
---
i know its just so they dont get destroyed that early on the game 😔 
---
Of course the devs would address this issue. Everyone is talking about it. And thank you for pointing out that I am a new reddit user. Wasnt everyone at some point? I am learning to navigate reddit as we speak and if you want to keep tabs on how many posts ive made by all means go right ahead. But for you to go so off topic and point that fact out along with my education or lack there of is "ad hominem" in itself. 
---
If you want to pay for me to take public speaking/debate classes i'd be more than happy to do so and can even send you venmo info or you can meet up with me at my local college so you can get your receipts after you pay for my classes, registration fees and books. If not then stfu and stay on topic. You can agree to disagree with me just like I have with the original post. But if you still feel the need to give me personal suggestions, point out any typos, or anything else, im sure there's pm on reddit. I wouldnt know, Im new here! ✌🏻 
---
Really not sure why isn’t already like that 
---
He could change it to while in a chase but then we just have another moonwalker
---
He didn't NEED it but he was still annoying to play against so it was well deserved imo 
---
That moment when this post has literally nothing to do with her.
---
you're a survivor main... at rank 15 probably 
---
Most legions at the ranks im in always bring franks mixtape every game 
---
I’ve wanted to buy this skin for so long! Maybe I’ll fork over the money and get it!
---
R words zubD
---
It's a vicious cycle. The huge increase in adrenaline is a response to 95% of games having noed. DS increase I think is a response to legion but idk for sure about that one
---
Right lmao? when people complain about legion it's NOT because he's "op" or whatever but hes just unfun to go against in every level
---
Ok 6 games now.
---
Azarov's resting place. It spawns at the opposite side to me. Get hakfway down the map then boom, its gone.
---
These devs are complete amateurs.
---
Aura reading perks need to work at all times not just when I am in the sadistic bastard fantasy world. The only time you know where he is, is when his arm half deep up yor but.
---
accurate
---
yet the killers complain about looping and DS?
---
as u/morinothomas said it's heavily implied.
---
I have this skin, it looks awesome. It’s sucks killers can’t see themselves. 
---
This golden mean fallacy shit is weird. 
---
&gt;it does not edit files at all and has LITERALLY 0 chance of getting you banned.
---
That's why I brought up MLGA, it's in a similar situation in which people will realistically never be banned for it. Can I ask why this is such a stickler point?
---
HA thats funny because the survivor community doesnt seem to agree maybe move to killer?
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_to_moderation
---
[removed]
---
Nerf him?!
---
Do you want another Freddy?!
---
Just fix him, making him worse won’t fix anything and removing him is just wrong
---
"Freddy agrees. Also doc somewhat agrees." People still DC/KYS against them although nowhere near as often. But I haven't seen many killers play them lately.
---
I mean rank 4 but it’s okay I figured that would be your reply that’s how most children act when someone doesn’t agree with them. Anyways don’t you get tried of trying to pass the blame on others in this community? Honestly don’t you realize you’re what’s wrong with the community. “DC till they nerf the killers” why do you even play? Lmao 
---
Read what you said but reapeat it out loud and say it slowly this time.
---
The entitlement is astounding.
---
Why walk backwards when you can just look down instead? I honestly don't understand why people moonwalk.
---
Didn't know that it was only *one* box on the map, I just thought it was a random chance of getting it off... thank you. 
---
Console is a completely different world from PC with different metas.
---
I dont get it 
---
RIP Bing Bong Boy 
---
😥
---
Well pig technically has 2 powers so that is only half of it. And that’s just to slow the game down not to get kills
---
Tbh that should just be a base thing, basement can be annoying as fuck to get to
---
Laurie dropped in front of the Spirit right as she swung at the other guy, injuring Laurie instead of downing the first guy.
---
Im gonna go with pretty cool! 
---
He's braindead easy man. Not like he requires skill like nurse and spirit
---
losing a second on a loop is enough for the killer to hit you. Just because you crouch doesn't mean the killer is going to stop in their tracks. Stopping or slowing down while in a loop with a killer for even a little bit means the difference between getting hit or getting another round around said loop, especially if the killer is running the loop and not randomly stopping.
---
Crouching doesn't make you invisible despite what many low rank immersed survivors think otherwise.
---
Or alternative increase attack cooldown by 20% to punish a killer for missing their insta downs
---
When I first started playing I thought it was base but when I found out it wasn't I just thought then what's the point of going to the basement
---
You can do this on PC, I didn't know that you couldn't do it on other platforms. You're playing  on console right?
---
Because I'm an entitled survivor main and killers misfortune brings me happiness :) nah but for real freddy and legion are both garbo and annoying to play against
---
deleting both of them wouldnt hurt the game at all, the contrary it would make it better
---
How is legion unfun to go up against? 
---
Satisfying
---
Behaviour doesnt give a fuck because they've already got your money. These spinless fucking twerps couldnt give a fuck about your enjoyment. Thats why they leave the game to fester as a broken rotten piece of shit.
---
Freddy is really bad and legion can be fixed if changed extensively, removing them would piss people off who spent money on them and their fans. I would call you an idiot again but that’d be insulting to idiots
---
i have multiple legacy 3 killers, and i've been around since the game came out. i promise i know how the game works, by now.
---
crouching does not make you invisible, no. but if there is something between you and him, yes, it often does exactly that. when the killer is chasing you around something and has to, say, break a pallet, where would you rather be: 7 yards away, or 5 yards away but completely obscured from view? the latter is (usually) a better bet, because it carries with it the possibility that the killer misses you altogether, or gets confused for a few seconds. both of those outcomes are so much in your favor that it is virtually always worth sacrificing those 2 additional yards of distance.
---
Same, I'd say basement is good for keeping pressure if you get a surv down there its near impossible to get someone out without anyone taking a hit but otherwise I'd just say hook where they are...if they added a bp bonus for basement best believe I'd drag every surv i could down there
---
Doesn't really matter if Freddy can't see you if his power locks onto people whether he sees them or not. Also, putting someone to sleep and walking away is a thing.
---
I seriously cannot figure out what the fuck whispers is. 
---
How does one get the mask for meg?
---
If you could make this but replace Dwight with other survivors I’d love you forever
---
As a very new player I'm glad to read this and hopefully people won't be too cruel to me. 
---
r/uselessredcircle
---
It ignores traps for a simple reason, the hatch favours survivors in every way. 
---
Frenzy and a cooldown add on actually make it (mostly) easy to catch survivors
---
Legion is just a group of disgruntled Canadians who killed a Janitor before the entity said "Hey! Get in my Belly!".
---
&gt; You can mend
---
No, in this case scenario im talking about when he decides to continue chasing you after tagging you. he literally just needs to refresh his power (which takes like what 7 seconds?) and he can have another FREE hit on you and you're downed after 30 seconds MAX  
---
Doesn’t bother me, I just leave and move on to my next game, I don’t really care what they used. 
---
A guy got high on bath salts and went door to door knocking and shooting anyone who answered on my Elm St. he finally had a big shootout with the cops and got shot 15 times, including in the head twice and the fucker lived. 
---
I was just there at my sisters house just before it began and then drove back and sat in an alley near by watching and listening to it. 
---
there definitely is lol 
---
if you don't think running the killer around for a long time takes skill you're an idiot
---
Its the huntress with the Infinity Belt
---
Turns out to be devour hope or worse thrill of the hunt
---
&gt; a kill I deserve
---
 Just no.
---
Myers isn't though? He's huge, and his face is bright white. Very rarely does a Mike get the drop on me. 
---
Just buy their other game, Deathgarden.
---
The only value is the Mask anyway. The game itself isn’t any fun.
---
Freddy buffs when?
---
Lmaooo, by far the hardest killer to be good with. Foh
---
I don't use it because I use perks that are effective the entire game
---
Legion doesn’t bother me, insta saw billy is worse. 
---
everything about this post reeks with entitlement lmao 
---
for your own sake I REALLY hope you're just being an unfunny troll. 
---
Waiting on that boar mask for Lunar New Year
---
Huntress and Nurse.
---
Sounds like you're saying he's OP, which you stated your complaints are not based around that. He has that nurse stun after every hit on someone with deep wounds already which is plenty time to get a start to the next location to stop them. Legion needs a buff my guy, a 4 hit kill using the killer ability which is meant to use to kill survivors easier?!, you just need to get better at the game
---
You must be new to DBD. Nurse is not the hardest killer to play.
---
If you don't think attacking a survivor and not losing them takes skill, you're an idiot
---
Anything is fair/engaging compared to Legion.
---
I only search for totems if I am in Mac Millan because I know it only spawns in the north.
---
When the myers has tier 3
---
lmao too true, dont know how many times i get downed under a pallet and i see a survivor nearby running away
---
like please, take a look, you might just be in a position to save someones life
---
Frank’s mixtape tho
---
It’s been that way since her release ? 
---
im kinda bored with arguing with you because frankly you dont strike me as someone who has played this game.. at all, ever
---
heres a video which might better explain some of my feelings towards legion
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqzBaPOnwtQ
---
And magical spider juice
---
Nurse
---
Huntress can't be that hard with a m&amp;k and a crosshair tho. Maybe on console
---
Man, we're never gonna eat at this rate
---
Not much you can do once you play the game long enough
---
Standing around doing nothing thinking I'm going to tunnel him because I can see him.
---
Sorry to say that if you are having issues hitting ds or greats then you just suck... Thats fine but acting like something easy is difficult for the sake of an argument is kinda bullshit. And yes I am describing a situation where 4 swfs are running optimal builds playing correctly.
---
 A game's balance is core to its success , balancing around new or unskilled players is a great way to create things that are utterly broken. Lets take overwatch for example , lets say instead of mcree's revolver doing 70 damage for a body shot it did 100.  This would make things easier to kill for unskilled or new players but would completely break the games ttk once you start factoring higher skill actions such as headshots. What would have taken 2 shots to kill before now only takes 1 , this difference doesn't signifigantly break the game's balance at a level where headshots aren't the norm but in the skill bracket that they are the entire game's balance gets turned on its head. 
---
Thats why you always balance around the top 20% of the playerbase , be inclusive but give players a goal to achive without breaking the games balance. Its definitely a tricky thing to do and dbd is horribly failing at it because that balance around rank 20 aka new or unskilled players. Hence the games overall balance has been so shit for so long , only recently have they started to balance things around the mid ranks , making the game healthier overall.
---
Then you should have to deal with their shitty optimization so that your team isn't fucked over.
---
To put it in the same terms as the video you released recently, why is your fun more important than theirs?
---
Not exactly fair, I know, but the minority will always get occasionally screwed over when automatic bans are given out.
---
Eh you'd be surprised at how many little intricacies there are. Learning the arc, learning the travel time, the effect on charging it, the gradient between no charge and full charge, the hitboxes of every object in the game, how long your windup is, when to ready it around corners. Not even close to how much there is.
---
But for the most part survivors are potatoes and you can just chuck them at pallets.
---
DS isn't near as powerful as NOED so it doesn't have to be nullified. It's far easier for a killer to get another hit than it is for survivors to avoid being hit by a now even faster killer.
---
Iron Maiden THIS
---
Would be fun to se dwight doing Huntress's mori. Would be like if he got his axe from the locker
---
I mean there’s 2
---
There’s the fact that blood has a lot of salt
---
And the fact that all survivors are generally salty
---
Shut up im a nerd and I feel bad for the dumb people that don’t get it
---
Is it? In the lore, it says that he was notified that his father "passed". That's weird language for a man who was murdered and buried by a bunch of teenagers.
---
There's a YouTuber that mains hag I think hes space coconut he does really well with hag
---
I thought our argument was over, why are you still talking?
---
"Whaow" - owen wilson
---
Gotta love the magical autistic spider god
---
Oh hey that was me! The story goes was that i was obviously the killer, and i wanted to experiment with the new Ivory Mori i got. i also had NOED with some decent perks, i was a wraith. So the game started then i realized we played in The Game, my personally hated map. So thanks to whispers, i got confused thanks to the many layers of the Game. and so i got pretty frustrated. also had to deal with a genrush and some good survivors. i didnt get a hook at ALL! and so with the last gen done, i did what everyone does, beat the shit outta one survivor and camp their ass. Keep in mind this was in the end game. and so 2 other people escaped... but this one person? he was amazingly altruistic. i fooled him quite easily thinking i was gone... but he unhooked the person on the hook. so i chase them to the eit, and thank GOD for NOED. i downed them both near the exit, and... well.. i did the most logical thing. i Moried one person, and put the other on the hook. it was a bad game, but i had 2 kills in the end... sorry if i went on a bit long, this is just a story ill remember.
---
What does dead hard do again?
---
It fixes your erection
---
Nurse...and it's not even close.
---
Hillybilly is the easiest character to play, what are you talking aboug?
---
That claudette almost sandbagged you lol
---
When activated you get a small speed boost and you evade and you're immune to hits for about a second.
---
Congrats man! I’m working on getting all perks on Freddy and it’s gonna be a long journey, but I know I’m gonna feel accomplished about it. 
---
Also don’t worry about prestiging her, my Freddy isn’t even P1. I think prestige is really not worth it.  
---
Hillbilly is braindead easy man lol
---
You can do a tiny dash with invincibility frames but get exhausted after. Basically used to dodge a swing from a killer.
---
Not really, at least for me. I’ve also heard from other people that he takes some time to use effectively, but not nearly as long as Nurse or Spirit. 
---
Yeah, I was expecting them to body block when they waited at the gate, but they almost got me back to the hook.
---
Hmmm, interesting idea I would love to see Jason in dbd but he has his own game that no longer gets content and still has players for some reason. Someone should make a character art
---
Oh cool thx
---
Gentler langauge for an ungentle end, some people prefer to deliver the news in a less harsh manner. Can also note that Jeff also painted the Legion's mural in the Lodge before they became killers for The Entity.
---
It can also be implied that the company Rin's father worked for is the cause of the defective rails that in turn caused the train wreck that pulled Adam Francis in to the Entity's realm from the minor details as well.
---
Each new Killer and Survivor is starting to be linked more in their bios now, if you look close enough in to the details.
---
Well the in game descriptions aren’t accurate. They say Doctor is hard, but he’s pretty easy. 
---
Yea man fr. Even if I can barely hear the girls he always seems to catch up to me and fuck me up 
---
Get chased, unhook people. Easy pip. 
---
except for the loud notification....
---
peekabu myers by the community as the best with jumpscares hands down
---
I got pips and got to rank 1 easily by unhooking others much more often. 
---
Deep Wounds is the only thing stopping Legion from being overpowered as all hell.
---
That system is what forces Legion to hit survivors four times, and is what makes remaining injured against Legion meaningless.
---
Remove the deep wounds interaction and Legion would be dealing **normal damage** with his unavoidable attacks, meaning that his initial double hit would down people.
---
But sure, let's not only buff him to be Nurse tier, but also increase his movement speed just for the hell of it.
---
Yeah but is this fandom asking for a shirtless pig outfit? No? Case Closed.
---
Gets me thinking about legion cosmetics...
---
But... but I've never used DS but I've still got killed by NOED. 
---
Sounds like you're a Fan of Camping. I hope your pc/console explodes
---
We're all ready 😜
---
Well those review bombs saying killer is op are now correct
---
It's bugged everywhere
---
I thought it was heavily salted so it would be edible... and it's just made of survivors
---
I would want legion to have a crossbow like in the movie Hush lol
---
What an entitled PIG.
---
ez baby survivor
---
Mixture of both but the text doesnt mention surviving. It says "in public matches unhook yourself 50 times"
---
You win
---
[NO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6gBu2Zd7Bc)
---
I don’t know whether this is changeable so easily too, but there are no perk level marks on shoe.
---
/r/2redditors1cup/
---
To for sure pip you need to do 2 gens, do at least 1 safe unhook, cleanse 2 dull totems or 1 hex totem. 
---
I can not stop laughing 😂🙈
---
It's raining ~~wo~~men, hallelujah
---
im literaly shakign and crying rn omg dwight would never do this😭
---
Why does the animation leave the victim with tits?
---
My friends &amp; i have also been experiencing this issue, we are lucky to get 2 games per hour. Tried everything we can think of, different hosts restarting the app, nothing consistently works. I noticed the problem started the day before the last event ended. The wait times have always been pretty bad but the last few weeks have been ridiculous. 
---
I seem to play mainly survivor but on your behalf I always though legion looked cool.
---
I'm really disappointed they didn't give Freddy good one-liners like he has in the actual movies. 
---
This is what I mean anyone can be dangerous with a knife lol
---
You only get BP if the Killer leaves the match via the pause menu. If they force quit the game everyone gets wiped to zero. This can not be changed so long as Killer remains host. Once we get the dedicated servers this should stop being an issue.
---
Cause it feels so empty without me
---
This is glorious 
---
BBQ is more than just a little bit broken on Nurse and Hillbilly (and maybe Huntress if she's good at long distance hatchet throws).
---
Dwight:  “Hello, what is up my fellow ni-”
---
All Adams in unison:  “Detention, now!”
---
The reason is so that a pig camping a box doesn't auto win. If the pig know which box a survivor needs, they can just stand in front of it, and a survivor is guaranteed to die. Having the RBT not be triggered by the hatch gives an opportunity to escape even if the pig is camping the box.
---
I really only use NOED if I’m going for an end game build, like with Blood Warden. That being said, as a survivor, I try to cleanse as many Dull Totems as possible and let my friends know if we’re in a group. It’s saved us quite a few times and takes hardly any time if you know how to do gens. Survivors forget that they have to keep their own level of map pressure in the game as well. It’s about balancing the time it takes to get generators while also combating chases and doing totems in case the killer brought NOED. While it is generally a crutch perk for shitty killers, I’ve seen some pretty decent players use it occasionally (for perk builds mostly). Not trying to start an argument, just giving insight into how I and a few of my friends play. I really don’t think it’s OP because it’s so easily combated. :) 
---
Tired of Wraiths that act like the bestest of the bestestest killers when they manage to get 2 kills using the Sloppy Bug and camping....the blood sprays so high that hiding, even in a corn field is almost impossible
---
I also play solo Survivor, Killer's perks are basically irrelevant to solos once you understand the game. If it matters that much to you, wait. If it's a ten minute wait... stop dying 2 minutes into the match.
---
What is that perk? 
---
He's guarding most of my posts.
---
What's wrong with sloppy on wraith?
---
My logic for using it is if others are using very strong perks why can't I. It's not very interactive or fun, but not using it feels pretty bad in situations where you land a hit on a survivor but they just move speed to the door 
---
No, I get that the stories of survivors and killers are becoming linked. I just think the janitor being the dad is a bit of a stretch. When someone says "passed", I just think of dying in a more natural way. Also, if he was getting a call, it would have been to inform him that they found his father because...he was being buried.
---
it constantly sprays Blood out your shoulder, even after being healed
---
Small game. Allows you to detect totems and traps in a small section of your field of view within a certain range.
---
Yea, I've got no clue how to do that. That was an actual bug in my game because I was going for Adept Quentin. My top perk slot was empty but her addon took it's place for some reason
---
I’m down to do this tomorrow ~430pm EST or later 
---
Jax_beach_904
---
I can agree on training someone to 3 hooks. it doesn't feel great to be that guy, but ruin is necessary. When I'm leveling killers without ruin I literally lose 2 gens before the first hook, and the rest is a snowball downhill. I wish there was alternatives to ruin. I think BBQ wouldn't be used if it didn't give BP, but at least it encourages roaming. 
---
The regrouping will be gone after dedicated servers are implemented. Probably not right away, but it'll be possible then to implement maintaining the SWF lobby even after joining a game. 
---
I'm also awful at this
---
I agree with you. I am just saying that slugging isn't the always the best thing for a killer to do. It is highly rewarding but also highly risky. So, survivors should not say that slugging is toxic or anything. 
---
What system do you play on?
---
Idk about you guys but I personally enjoy playing as and against Legion, even if I get stomped.
---
Commence the negative karma for having a conflicting opinion.
---
I’m still learning it myself but I will look behind me and if they swing or I feel they are about to swing because they are super close, I do my version of a 360 which I just explained above. It nice to also practice it on kill your friends. It confuses the killer when you do that and you can either get away or get a good distance from them. But timing it correctly is super hard for me and timing it is the biggest part of it. I’m sure there are also YouTube videos you could look up. Just search “how to 360 on Xbox one dbd” or just different jukes in general. 
---
Decisive Strike **tier IV**
---
Rank 8 mocking Rank 15.
---
:big think:
---
Totems can come in two varieties. Dull totems (totems that do not have the candles at their base lit) are just for bloodpoints to the survivor when they break them down a.k.a. "cleanse" them.
---
Hex totems (totems where the candles at the base are lit) are totems that hold perks for killers. A popular one is called "Hex: Ruin" It makes generator skill checks require a "Great" skill check in order for generator progress to continue normally. If the survivor hits a "Good" skill check instead, then the progress bar for the generator repair will go back 5%. This effect will stay as long as the survivors haven't "cleansed" the hex totem. Once they do "cleanse" the totem, the effect will go away and survivors will be able to repair generators like normal again.
---
The purple perk I used in this meme is called No One Escapes Death. It changes a dull totem to a hex totem once all 5 generators have been repaired. At this point, all survivors will be in the "exposed" status meaning they can be put into the dying state after one hit instead of two. This effect, just like the Hex: Ruin effect, will stay until the hex totem is "cleansed" by the survivors. Hope this was helpful 😁
---
Xbox
---
Yeah, every time you put a trap on someone the game randomly picks a box and goes "this one disarms that trap." Unless the Survivor goes to *that* specific box the trap won't come off, so it's entirely up to luck how long it takes.
---
Yeah but that's the answer. After this recent patch  of 2.4.0 they literally killed their own killer player basr on console. A lot of people on console desperately wanted the optimization they promised but all they got was worse everything. People were sick of it and left.
---
After attacking a survivor in frenzy who is not effected by deep wounds you will active "Killer's instinct", this is the thing that reveals the location of survivors in your terror radius. The achievement needs you to down people while in that mode.
---
Everybody always talks about needing to do some sort of crazy 4 man chain stab loop arounds. That will almost never happen, ever. The easiest way to earn it is while chasing somebody with their timer low enough to go down, if you see somebody you should attack them with frenzy and then try to catch up with the guy you were originally chasing. It won't happen to much but it will happen sometimes, thats how I got the achievement.
---
*The flashbacks... rip devour hope 00:00-00:10*
---
Thank you I really appreciate the explanation
---
The traps aren't there to kill. They're there to slow things down. A trapped Survivor is a Survivor not helping do gens. It's like a built in Ruin.
---
If you want to see why Pig isn't considered weak I would suggest checking out Ardetha's Pig videos on YouTube.
---
You're welcome 😊
---
I feel Spirit is pretty damn good at it too.
---
Can someone explain to me what’s happening here ?
---
It’s on my profile, but often times I have my name set to something ridiculous for the sake of meme builds. I used to have ttv in my name and people said some really cruel things.
---
See this is what I thought legion would be based on his trailer and name of the dlc pack(the darkness among us) a shape shifter that could take the form of the survivors and cause paranoia.  
---
Face camping is annoying yes, but it’s not game breaking if the other three survivors know to gen rush instead of all fucking crouching behind cover near the hook 
---
But instead we got...legion
---
Dumb survivors being dumb survivors 
---
This is definitely an issue. They’ve addressed that they’re working on it! Hopefully next patch it’ll be ok! 
---
They clarified the Unreal Engine is the FIRST step to optimization. 
---
I have better results against good survivors than I do with some "better" killers like Meyers. People not running self care nowadays is a huge buff for him as well.
---
I can only play him with a range add on and my crutch perks though. He also does bad on large maps but most m1 killers do as well. 
---
Long answer: Hex perks are perks that are embodied by 1 of 5 totems, and it appears lit. When the totem is destroyed, the perk becomes inactive. Some of the strongest perks revolve around totems, and it makes sense that totems should be relatively out of sight, so survivors have to actively look for them to counter the perk.
---
Short answer: bad
---
Hey, as a Killer, I'm not complaining that everyone doesn't do this. That being said, it's kinda frightening knowing that my one surefire way to slow the game down enough for me to do my job can be so easily countered if my opponents aren't braindead.
---
Optimization (((PASS)))
---
I’d definitely buy legion in a heartbeat if that was built in.
---
You mean doing the objective? Should I hide in a locker for five minutes after every generator then? 😂
---
I’ve been using other perks instead of NOED. Since Freddy is so bad he need those crutch perks, I figured I’d try to get better without them. Right now I’m using Make Your Choice instead of NOED and I’m having really good luck with it. Also yes after the self care nerfs it makes Freddy a helluva lot easier to use. 
---
Blood constantly sprays out of you even after you’re healed and messes with your FPS quite a bit.
---
&gt; Just like freddy.
---
Freddy did not break the game the way legion does. Freddy was not good when he released. I agree that legion needs to be changed, but DC'ing is not the way to get him changed.
---
It depends on how well executed it is and how good the killer player is along with what sensitivity settings they have.  You can practice this spin in the tutorial, and you'll notice that your survivor spins around faster when you rotate the camera the opposite direction that you spin your body. You can use that increased spin speed to dodge attacks relatively well, but it's obviously unreliable at best and always a last resort option.
---
So uh.... you haven’t played her I assume?
---
Nvidia freestyle baby. No dark corners for Claudette anymore.
---
r/uselessredcircle ?
---
Probably could if it forced you to move and pointed your camera at it, like what happens with Hag traps.
---
You know, NOED would get killers a lot less kills if people just left the hooked person instead of just fucking diving into the killer's arms.
---
Does it happen randomly? I use sloppy all the time.
---
in every Platform, but its worse in console, as it drains the fps even further
---
You don't see what you just said do you.
---
You are an idiot. Goodbye.
---
It can be a bit tricky but try to do it somewhat quickly but not too fast or else you’ll end up right where you were. You’ll find a sweet spot with practice. Also be sure to practice doing it both directions to change it up. 
---
You think that he is that dumb? He obviously wanted to de-pip.
---
Yes, he can down you in an open area with nothing in it.
---
...That's it.
---
He can't use his instadown anywhere else. It takes so long and he is slowed so much that any form of loop is a no-go for him
---
This look so Satisfying. 
---
Don't go in the basement
---
ah welp won't be playing wraith for awhile then
---
I assume Leatherface.
---
Just don't 
---
To my knowledge it doesn't show on the killers side, but it stays constant on survivor side and absolutely tanks frame rate making the game unplayable.
---
Fresh Meat! 
---
Ur mad lol
---
“RagingQueer” 
---
Checks out 
---
ah thxs for the info
---
You forgot Adrenaline, Sprint Burst, Borrowed Time, NOED and Ruin
---
Eh, you've got jerks and you've got joys when it comes to this game. I played Freddy on the Game map and ended up with a three person swf. Three megs one Laurie with OoO. They kept insta healing and teabagging me the whole match until the gates opened. Then for whatever reason the Meg who outplayed me the best came back in and started farming with me. I got 5k bp out of the pallets and hits and chases, I'd say she made an extra 10k because of all the stuns heals and totems she got. Angry at the teabagging but she actually decided to help me safety pip so it made the game not so bad. 
---
Perfect example for me that even though people play jerky they can still be.....not..jerks?
---
Its still pretty embarrassing for a veteran/cop to get his ass kicked by a bunch of teenagers. 
---
Which is totally fair, my only concern is that I'm racking up a bunch of completely unwarranted reports against my Xbox account and I think it's bullshit that I have to worry about that even a little. Like you said, I bought the game just like everyone else and I'm not obligated to follow the community guidelines of what the "right" way to play the game is.
---
Fire Up is not good. Yes, it can work in niche builds with BS or Bamboozle, but alone it has little use.
---
It might have been. I do shit like that all the time. In fact I've done that exact drop to save a teammate form being tunneled out of the game.
---
I’ve always thought of what would happen if there were 4 shirtless David’s vs a female legion
---
You don’t need to be bad to be gen rushed or to use DS. If your a that bad bad of a killer anyways NOED will not help you. If your bad at escaping the killer and looping DS will not help you but to buy a few extra seconds if you can hit the skill check. 
---
Now if you are good on both sides yes NOED can help you get more kills, and DS can buy your whole team so much more time! 
---
Also don't forget that the basement is SUPPOSED to be a bad area for survivors. It could be questionable, yes, but that be how it is.
---
r/uselessblackbox
---
Or Nea doing the hag’s Mori on survivors like the feared killer she is
---
Same. It’s really annoying. I used to play killer and survivor pretty equally but lately because of this I’ve been playing killer a lot more since I get nearly instantly filled lobbies 
---
“Hah Dwight, time for your mori!”.
---
“Ñø ü.”
---
Killers are sick of toxicity of some survivors, and the bugs in the game. I don’t agree with others who say the game is unplayable, but it certainly is annoying. They’re probably off playing something else in the meantime, til it gets fixed.
---
Why don’t you play Killer in the meantime then? That’s what I’ve been doing lol. Racking up bp and spending it all on my survivors. Figuring out hex placements. Understanding how killers work so that when they come back, I can do better as survivor.
---
Killers would also get less kills if survivors only unhooked when strategically advantageous but that wouldn't be very fun.
---
*oinks in disbelief*
---
Learn jukes, learn the killer's patterns (respecting pallets, doubling back, moonwalking, etc.) be resourceful and never waste pallets/windows 
---
Killer = ranked
---
Survivor = casual 
---
Done
---
He just said he needs a rework. Did you read what he said?
---
Yes I know just saying they can follow the blood trail before you heal completely and kill you if you don't have insta-heal.
---
The hex perk isn’t worth running especially since survivors can just break them I feel it’s a wasted slot.
---
Perk two could be useful and I would think about running it especially with Michael or leather face 
---
The last perk Is also a wash, I would changed the movement speed to repairing gens and opening exits. Sorrey I’m at work and can’t be more thorough
---
He can down multiple survivors whom are right next to each other in open areas. Dont huddle together, and remember, if he hits a wall hes stunned for a while.
---
If I load in nearly the same time as another person the lobby gets dodged.
---
So it's fun to farm someone and also die for it?
---
They have bbq and chili, survivor pudding, and for dessert, escape cakes
---
*That one scene from infinity war when Thanos gets the last infinity stone*
---
Trapper. For the most part, killers thrive on survivors making mistakes. With the trapper you have a little more control over that though. Second to him, I really enjoy running round the map with hillbilly.
---
I'd like to think so, I run Resilience, Spine Chill, Sprint Burst, and Adrenaline, I havent change my perks in weeks....
---
Might be time to do the laundry...
---
Michael Myers, nothing better than popping tier 3 behind a survivor
---
I would argue viability plays a part into how fun a killer is to play. I wouldn't say getting a 1k every game as Freddy is fun.
---
It’s called the entity kiddo
---
You cant insta heal mend
---
Myerino, it is fun seeing them get jumpscared, along with pig for the same reason, just wait until monitor and abuse comes out in the SOS and put on that scratched mirror and queue the ghost grabbing. &gt;:)
---
I'm a...I'm a leatherface main...
---
The feast for the entity one with 500 sacrifices completed
---
Or you could do like Sheva's Bow in Resident Evil 5 that has no crosshair and simply learn the trajectory of her arrows and be able to shoot perfectly without a crosshair
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
Indeed, but this question assumes you don't care about performance at all.
---
Protector of the chest
---
Honestly, that’s what it should have been
---
Are you having trouble reading?
---
I was experiencing long loading times as well, I think it is just a problem with the server because my games were always within 30 seconds beforehand.
---
LMAO. Classy. You got whipped by things like facts and proof, and the best you can do is come back with a pathetic insult.
---
Ad Hominem Fallacy, ya know?
---
Bye, Felicia. 
---
god, dwight is savage
---
Order the chili.
---
Is this like Nurses Calling but you just always see the obsession with DS when they are nearby?
---
Never really played him much but Wraith. I love the speed he has when invisible and ability to body block/mind game with his uncloaking in a chase
---
"did he play the game? Maybe he played the game, if so, i'll condone the piss baby survivors actions"
---
there, fixed it for you.
---
I have no idea what game you are playing but at rank 1 I RARELY ever see insults let alone half the shit you just described. I have 1.3k hours in the game and our experiences couldn't be further apart.
---
Wraith and Trapper always run NOED, no matter how bad they’ll do, NOED will come in a crutch and give them a kill. 
---
Huh didn’t know that! Thanks, I mean it makes sense. I guess it’s one of those things that were all just going to have to deal with. It is what it is
---
if there is a lot of salt in your blood you need to get that checked out fast
---
Dwight doesn't go in lockers to hide from killers. Dwight goes in lockers to keep himself from killing.
---
Tbh, survivor isn’t much better if you have a “toxic” play style. I’ve gotten far too much hate mail just from using DS at all or pallet/flashlight saving etc. I just play aggressively 😭
---
Yeah I never see nurses at high rank console and when I do they’re baby nurses (like me) or decent nurses crippled by the 2.5 frames per second when blinking 
---
Well running no mither is basically saying to the killer than they suck so much you can win while permanent injured.  Challenge accepted 
---
See how he's standing there, kinda hunched over, looking away?  That's just how it looks when you spawn!
---
I usually just brush it off as it is a laurie who never p pool says as laurie trying to get the adept trophy, but one time at the beginning of the match, someone used OoO and started me down as they went into a locker, and they weren't a laurie, I suggest not even using the perk, unless you are a god level toxic player who just wants to bully the killer
---
It took me a few games to learn the nurse blinks, it felt quite easy to estimate how long i needed to charge etc. She's not that hard as you claim her to be. Sure if you dont run charge addons you need to be on point with her but even then it wasnt hard to get a 4k.
---
I never said you needed 200 iq to play spirit, but the road of learning her compared to nurse is longer. You need to know when and where its useful to mind game / fake phasing etc. While as nurse you just need learn her blinks.
---
As a Freddy main it’s useless to camp the door. I just run away or stop moving at that point. 
---
I play on ps4 and still trying to do it. Ive dont like twoce now
---
My advice
---
Get gud
---
You should not have made it that far with the amount of distance between you, the gate and lestherface. Did he just stand still after the DH or some shit lol 
---
Yeah, and you know that makes it insanely easy for the Pig to just search around the Jigsaw boxes? So you're essentially saying "fuck you" to the last survivor? Nah, man.
---
I wanna keep prestiging Myers but losing M&amp;A everytime feels like I'm losing my kids
---
You are probably playing with the volume too low to hear it at the edge. 
---
She has two powers, RBT AND the crouch. A lot of rank lists judge it on who does best in a chase, and pig can use her crouch and get that ambush attack for 7 seconds.
---
Just kill them with kindness
---
Say gg for you too and they all go crazy, dont show to them your affected by hate
---
Only one of my adept survivors took a couple times. Often times it doesn’t register as adept if you go through the hatch.  
---
Also, with killers, Mori’s don’t count unless you had already hooked them twice and bleed outs also count as long as you have hooked them twice.
---
You don't get to complete the mend action, so the insta heal is useless.
---
Because your mocking someone and that is rude
---
Because they are fair strategies. Why should they be bannable? They are built in strategies to the game. 
---
The 3rd perk has that exact effect, at 2 tokens " The continued slaughter of your survivors friends further hinders their willingness to help others, upon killing your second survivor, the obsessions action speed is reduced by 15% for all actions."
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
How did the killer fake it?
---
What rank are you? A lot of low level killers do that
---
You should have given it a try.  You never know.  Their BBQ and Chili could be to die for.
---
The way I see it the entity offered them a chance at vengeance but didn’t tell them the exact terms of what accepting its offer would do 
---
Which you should be doing anyway since you get bp 
---
Just an update if anyone else reads this. I finally found the player on steam page 3800 and confirmed it was him because him and his friend were both in that game and are steam friends. Reported their steam acc to steam for hacking and behavior now has their profile
---
Song name?
---
Platinum
---
And thats fine. I'm happy some people get good streaks. Things I layed out are not an absolute rule, just an observation. It's just that most high tier perks and abilities in this game rely on taking away agency from players, winning by preventing them doing what they need. When I am not allowed to "fight for my success" I get frustrated and angry. And when top quarter of the ladder is a bunch of minmaxing players, taking away fun from eachother, overall atmosphere goes down quickly.
---
Thats not to say you can't meet nice players. Depending on time of day, server and luck, you certainly can have both single nice games and whole streaks of them.
---
Yeah. It's all cute when you see piglets in pics. But not when you eat then right? 
---
That moment where a coincidence does the lore better than the actual developers
---
Myers followed by Spirit.  I dislike Spirit's look, but she is very fun to play.  
---
Thanks so much!!
---
No\_Problem.com &lt;3
---
Lol this is actually funny
---
Thing about toxicity in this game is it can be genuinely annoying. As Survivor if they facecamp you endlessly all you can do is hang there and be depressed. And as Killer, depending who you are really, there is only so little you can do about the Toxette teabagging you behind the pallet.
---
Doesn't get kills? I slugged a whole team yesterday. I got him few days ago and I have probably got around twenty +2 pips. He is very good with good add-ons.
---
For groups
---
step 3 play on pc cause its better adapts to a play style and allows players to take more control of movement.
---
Lmao new meta
---
True, I still wish they'd work harder on the dedicated servers tho. It would fix a good portion of the things the community complains about daily and they have more than enough resources to implement them by now
---
So we should remove a Killer that you don’t like instead of reworking them? That is a lot of entitlement. Grow up kid. 
---
Also, I’m shocked you haven’t made a “delete Doctor because I don’t like him” post yet. 
---
Idk if I agree SC is selfish. If I see someone, of course I'll let them heal me and if they're injured I'll heal them. It benefits the team to be able to do it yourself if necessary though. 
---
Pig. If you want fun, try spooking survivors by jumping around corners really quick. If you want to win, try saving your traps until the last two gens and watch the survivors lose their fucking minds trying to get them off and forget about escaping the match for a bit. It's usually just long enough for you to get the upper hand on hooks.
---
Honestly, I thought it was just me. Granted me and my friends’ ranks are all over the place so I’m sure that doesn’t help.
---
Because they are legitimate strategies. I’m sorry, but you’re not entitled to an escape every game. Get good. 
---
Step 4: I don't have a PC I'm broke. 
---
If the legion is good, he will switch targets. He should not focus on one guy. That's what makes him very good.
---
They will either camp hatch or patrol boxes, it's gonna be hard for the survivor anyways because a lot of hatch plays are won by the killer, it just makes the pig a more viable killer, it isn't broken when you think about it. Along with how killers could just prevent them from jumping in by grabbing them, it just applies more pressure to the survivor, which arguably the killer might need. (Honestly I am just defending because I feel bad for the guy cuz everyone is calling him an entitled crybaby)
---
I main Pig, and I watch my roommate play survivor. Seeing it from the other side when my roommate is doing gens then all of a sudden Amanda is *right fucking next to you* manages to make me jump every time. 
---
I'm on it.. brb
---
What happens when you load in with 4 Decisive Strikes
---
The game isn't what was intended, because of competition and toxicity.
---
Players just have to learn the ropes and pray for good teams. 
---
Small game..... use it
---
Legion hitting more than one person is not good. he’s 10x better tunneling one person.
---
Were you able to load into games quickly?
---
It is just asking for a free hook
---
Last night we had a wait time of 20+plus minutes just to have the killer disconnect before the game started. We waited another 20+ before we just gave up.
---
We are playing right now and 2 games in and I'd say it's at about 10 to 15 mins.
---
Don't worry my concerned friend I thought about that there would be incentive to play other killers because one the killer you're shifted as could either have no perks or add ons or no add ons and their teachable perks so now if you actually want to play let's say trapper with perks and add ons you actually have to play trapper and also your cosmetics for the killer wouldn't carry over as an even bigger reason to not just play the shifter if you want to play as shirtless Myers you're gonna have to play as him. I will say if the killers did have their teachables it would make for some interesting plays like switching to LF for bbq right before hooking someone or switching to Nurse when you suspect someone is healing
---
You have to actually down the Survivor in order to do something. What good are they if the Survivor just keeps looping you? But then again, I wouldn’t be surprised if you’re really a rank 12-15 player who just wants easy wins. 
---
“Tunneling” can even be common sense. Why would I chase a healthy Survivor that takes two hits to down over a Survivor who’ll go down in just one? 
---
I find the hex a lot of the time because the killer goes straight to it lol
---
This game has such an adoring community that its members would wait 10-30 minutes for a lobby. I wish it didn't come to this though 
---
A friend and I sometimes wait like 10mins and we switch host, which kind of fixes it. Games sometimes don’t even last 10mins as well, it’s either all gens get done or we all just die. It gets annoying ngl
---
I mainly play legion?
---
So how does the killer have fun? At some point you have to run down a survivor  and bash his skull in.. someone has to get the first hook. I'm  not for camping but shit happens like SWF hook rushing just to get walloped.. if I see a survivor  farm another one right when  I hooked him best believe  his ass is getting my next hook.
---
That’s quite brilliant murder puberty explains the flaw with their power I hope though that it gets buffer better
---
Witch hunting someone is against Reddit policy so you might wanna delete this post. Do know that we all as a community feel for you and pray that one day the devs will have an actual functioning report system
---
Same. Had a Claudette trying to block a Feng Min I was chasing. So I just popped to Tier 3 and was using a Tombstone piece so she was dead in the first 60 seconds of the match. Helped that she was the Obsession and I was using Dying Light.
---
Add on frequency? Explain please 
---
This is what the Legion was supposed to be like in concepts.. infiltrator killer
---
no, it seems when you are rank 10 and below you wait eternity lol
---
It happens a lot but it shouldn’t be banable. If anything the deva should do even more to punish these play-styles within the game. A ban is going way to far
---
Legion cause I’m tired of dealing with looping such a stupid thing to see seriously its not something I wanna ever deal with and I refuse to loop when playing survivor unless it’s doctor
---
Same with my friends and I. We always make the joke “oh god guess what time it is...everyone is in bed.” Around 8PM. It’s really odd. We’ve noticed that for months now so idk. 
---
You dont hear a roar if you uncrouch and grab. 
---
Report them to PSN, since they want to be an idiot.
---
Well thats more an issue of shitty teammates then a design issue
---
I just make sure to always go after the healthy guy and I still win games and have fun. But yeah if I see a single farmer or sandbagger they're getting the facecamp I don't even care if I only get a 1k at that point. Put them in their place.
---
Yeah, it sucks, when it happens to me, I don’t mind as long as my team focuses gens. I feel bad when it happens to my friend. I want to try and get the killers attention, but I know my friend would rather have me just do a gen, and I’m here just knowing my friend is guaranteed to die, I shed a tear lmao
---
I’ve been playing since it came out on PS4 and when i play survivor I’ve always had that issue of finding games later in the evening like past 9pm. I just think not as many people play that late. Also there probably aren’t as many people playing as there use to be. 
---
I’m the Feng. Every. Time.
---
Me ;_;
---
Yet you probably do after you reach rank 1. 
---
How is the Killer bad if he’s managing to kill you? Doesn’t that mean that you’re worse at the game than he is? 
---
alert is better than spine chill but the information is worthless to me since i haven't given a shit about stealth in the last 2000 hours
---
Ur better Calling her a cunt and and an idiot? 
---
Considering that the game describes it as "rotting" with "rivulets of blood," and the fact the snout seems sewn shut, alongside that her map and base of operations in the movies was a meat packing plant with pig carcasses everywhere, I'd wager a guess that it's an actual pig's head.
---
Aside from the obvious tips like break them, play mind games etc. Never waste too much time in loops.

Literally about 80% of my games today have started 3v1 or had DC/suicides early. It seems like "welp ruin is still up and I just got downed, guess I'll suicide on hook byyyyyyyye".
---
Instructions unclear, played Jesus and took No Mither
---
Myers is nowhere near low tier. I am just speaking from a general consensus. When i encounter a myers on rank 1, i know there is a reason he reached that rank with him. Taking advantage of his low TR and built-in bamboozle speed on EW2 and knowing when to pop EW3 makes him a monster. He has the highest snowball potential and he is the only killer that his power benefts from pallet loops. Popping EW3 on first survivor you see is just inefficient and waste of a potential multi-down or preventing a loop. 
---
When I first started playing DBD, Freddy was the most annoying killer for me almost to the point that made me ragequit, now everytime I get on a match with him, I just resign and do the die.
---
Man i got news tonight that my grandfather has a tumor so i wanted a distraction and wanted to have fun not deal with toxic players so yes im going to get pissed off and treat them the same way they treat me 
---
Billy because I like race cars 
---
Go in!! Plus they deliver :)
---
So what are survivors supposed to do? Run straight?
---
Do you mean being targeted? Because that sounds like being targeted, not tunneled, even then, they have to go for someone, this time it was you.
---
Camping happens, it sucks to be on the other end of, but if it keeps working, killers will keep doing it. It works very well, survivors all drop what they are doing, flock to the hook like moths to a flame and the killer gets a whole bunch of kills. The problem is, that you sometimes just need to camp, you just have to do it or you're punished for it.
---
None of it needs to be bannable though. Tunneling is already a moot point, "*yes they are going for you, what did you expect*"? Camping sucks, but serves a purpose. If those *are* bannable, then we need to start talking about pallet looping, cleansing hexes and unhooking. 
---
I play only huntress, myers and leatherface... By far my fav is still the huntress.
---
I’ve had that ruin spawn before 
---
Awesome!  I love this game but the crashes and loading bug is super annoying.  
---
Let me just throw something out there.  I tried a new build tonight: small game, spine chill, self care, and Urban evasion.  As a relative noob to this game, new avenues of possibility have been provided to me.  I fucking love this build.  Swap out an exhaustion perk for Urban evasion... But spine chill is fucking amazing, and small game is a close second.
---
Just don't play DBD, if you aren't looking for / can't handle negativity. I doubt anyone is going to say this is the right way to handle it.
---
Usually I joke and mock them for their salty messages it’s pretty funny what people post
---
I heard before on this reddit that one person actually sent gay porn to someone they were sending salty messages to which is the funniest thing I heard 
---
It makes me wonder why they were able to quickly send it gives some funny implications 
---
Clowns bottle throw is honestly super wonky and hard to really predict without a lot of trial and error. They both have a great kit for if you don't like being looped but in different ways. 
---
Legion is bad without perks, the power feels weak and also offers little counter play from survivors especially if you're running bloodhound/sloppy butcher or both. With perks Legion is very very strong and a great (if un-fun to play against) killer. 
---
The Clown gets real dangerous based on your own practice and perks only make him better. That's not to say practicing Legion won't make them better for you but the Clowns kit really hinges on getting the bottles and tracking survivor movements right. 
---
It comes down to your own preference and how much work you're willing to put in to the killer. If you'd like to feel strong right away try Legion. If you're willing to take a few/a lot of losses on your way to being scary go for the Clown. 
---
If it’s anything like mouse and keyboard you have to turn the camera the opposite direction you’re spinning in 
---
This is one of the things i love about maining wraith for some weirdass reason people think hes shit. Heck on ranking sites for voting for best kill he keeps coming second last (freddy last). And i keep seeing people saying he needs buffing.
---
But hes a Beautiful Bing Bong Boy just the way he is. Averaging 40k to 65k bp per match.
---
Because if you could get banned for tunneling or camping the game would be pretty much dead. 
---
Every. Fucking. Time
---
A game where you're just trying to complete 2 gens so you can maybe escape. 
---
That actually sounds like a cool name
---
I’m sorry to hear that but is it really a good enough reason to treat others poorly? 
---
It’s probably best to just not play games during potentially tough times man.
---
Honestly i played as killer tonight instantly got a match, i just think theirs not enough killers playing 
---
Michael myers doesn't need any more help with having a 0 terror radius, but he still can use it. It is just one of those things that one killer might benefit in and others do not, which is aside from the killer's power in general. And idk if it's for you but for must games I play where hatch is necessary, it often goes to the killer winning, regardless of me being killer or me being survivor, it seems the same for most as far as I know l.
---
Same not really any reason to stay after I die or win 
---
Interesting i think u also have to escape im not 100% sure but most challenges require escaping 
---
Can I steal this for my wallpaper?
---
I can handle negativity and i handled it the way i felt to handle it you rather me send dick picks like that one guy a while back did? I love this game ive put way too much money and time into it i took a break before legion came out and felt the need to come back to it because im actually not bad at it so yeah sure not the best way but not nearly the worst let me handle my situations my way 
---
Did they say how they would do it
---
Feel free! I'm glad you like it!
---
By far trapper cause when my trap gets someone in my head i think mmhmm good job on placement of traps 
---
But the game sorta sucks at telling DC and failed connection apart from one another
---
it doesn't lower their bp gain artificially... of course you're gonna get less bp if you plant yourself in front of a hooked survivor but the really tiny emblem debuff doesn't remove bp. it doesn't even really do anything.
---
I think people that play like that expect to be face camped. If they don't they are stupid because acting like that gets you face camped. 
---
Ok but if you find that boring or don’t have UE looping is pretty much all survivors have 
---
Interesting
---
I had a game with a huntress with insta hatchets, +2 hatchets, NOED, BBQ&amp;C, and an ebony mori yesterday. It was something.
---
Woah woah there's a crosshair option!? How do I turn it on!? I'm PS4 and aiming with huntress SUCKS
---
How long was it till he left?
---
I really like a lot of them but in terms of which is the most fun the huntress for sure. Nothing beats landing an hatchet epically. 
---
&gt; why is your fun more important than theirs?
---
This argument doesn't work when you are talking about playing Killer. As the host of the match, if your performance is poor it directly affects the others in the match, because it will cause the people you are hosting to lag/teleport/spike all over the place.
---
So, in his case, the DC *is* also taking their fun into consideration because playing against a laggy Killer isn't fun, either.
---
Ah, the days of the sapphire lens, and odd bulb. May you stay six feet under, where you always belonged.
---
Upvote for smol billy
---
no dont
---
What killer is that?
---
Not really, there’s many post proving that difference is hardly noticeable. 
---
It lowers your gain you get more for completing it have an actual look at them sometime
---
Well, see, here's the thing. People suck.... That's all there really is to it. 
---
...what? emblems have nothing to do with bp
---
You think hooking a survivor once and standing in front of him makes the killer a better player? That’s nonsense
---
xdxdxd
---
Its all the casual players that go to bed around 8:30-9pm because school or work ect) but if u switch to killer at said time it will help everyone else looking for a match. 
---
Your first example will not work but adrenaline will trump the exhaustion and give you the speed boost+ heal.
---
Thank you, finally a person with some common sense 
---
Legion, I’m ready for the downvotes 
---
And always keep in mind, every pallet thrown and destroyed early in the match is one less later in the match
---
But the butt
---
I’d say it’s noticeable. 
---
I’m just pissed that the targeting/tunneling always seems to happen to me. I want to play the game and have fun man!
---
i don't see how legion is fun at all since they take away all of the skill and brains required to chase someone efficiently
---
You can, and I'll link it.
---
If you just want my thoughts:
---
Genrushing can't be used as an excuse for why a killer has lost, because that's idiotic. The origination of the term comes from Brand New Part and how genuinely bullshit it used to be.
---
 At this point, the only time I would call genrushing is when someone is so immersed that they'll let people die rather than leave their gen, only to later:
---
- Complain over being killed with NOED
---
- Whine about survivor BP rates because they are escaping with only 7,000-12,000 points.
---
- Kill someone by activating multiple of the Pig's RBT at once.
---
Tl;dr:
---
Genrushing isn't an excuse for why the killer lost, it's an answer for why a survivor got no points or fucked the team over.
---
wraith, freddy, nurse, billy, huntress
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Yeah, just report him if they do it more than a  few seconds to a few minutes. Like, it's okay to meme about it, but it's not okay to go out of your way to body block someone for an extended period of time, forcing a dc and zero bp.
---
What's not broken on ps4..?
---
Okay my bad i thought they gave bloodpoints for them. But even if its ranking only it IS punishing camping.
---
they're not dumb, this game is just poorly designed
---
I wasnt necessarily saying that 0 terror radius affects hatch plays, I was just saying that it makes killers more diverse because 0 terror radius helps myers in a way that pig RBT doesnt do, but rather another aspect of the game, for example, hatch. You stated that pig doesnt need more help, nor does myers in terms of having a low terror radius, but he still does.
---
‘Red Paint Brush’ slow Freddy’s movement down just a little bit. Why not ‘Class Photo’ as built in? This will give him a top tier killer, more strategy more pressure for survivors.
---
I’m on right now. It just seems there might be less killers on? 
---
Just reminds me of how brutal Legions mori is. 
---
I don't mind ds because I have enduring or I let those losers die on the ground HAHAHAHA 
---
👌
---
Anyone who uses ds should expect to be slugged, especially if they don't have enduring or hooks nearby. That's why a lot of ds users pair it with unbreakable. I don't mind it personally, and I use ds a lot. 
---
But they know the mechanics and still they run in.... its like running into a burning building and getting angry that you got burnt
---
I don’t play that much and it doesn’t seem to be a problem getting to rank one from rank 10 quite easily..
---
UE is meta though I haven’t seen many people who don’t have it
---
But how do you tell which direction the survivor is? I'm dumb 
---
Oh hell yes
---
Gems like this you only find by browsing /new
---
Their honor code is this
---
If you use a strategy that is effective against me then your a trash tunneler or camper 
---
Idiots
---
Yeah, I mean I don’t go to the extent of bannable, but the defense for camping in particular 9 times out of 10 is laughable. Tunneling is ok to an extent, but I think tunneling off hook is weak as shit. 
---
Dying Light of five gens left? Nah, I’d rather kms or dc. Not worth keep playing tho.
---
A discord full of Leatherface mains actually made an extensive Leatherface rework a bit ago. I can paste the info in a comment.
---
yeah, the other day I played Doctor and got completely trashed by swf on Asylum map. after it I thought using noed but then just slapped pink Mori on cause I was very pissed. 4th pink Mori in my 1.9k hours D:
---
then there was the same god damn map and I got another swf, this time with some streamer, so I lied myself I did it cause "toxic streamer privilege". even killed the streamer guy first. 
---
I got 4k. it was easy. but I didn't feel good about myself. I'd think it's how cheating feels like when you love someone but then you cheat on them because you were mad. 
---
but I haven't used noed since Curtain Calls, my pride with all the survivor nerfs doesn't allow me. 
---
Anyone can be dangerous with a killer instinct, and the determination to kill 
---
Yeah, lore wise the hatch is connected to (presumably) Vigo.
---
gives the options to throw the shoe at killer and if hit stuns for .212445 seconds. If the killer has a mask they are unaffected. Also puts exhaustion on CD cause why not. Give blindness while held cause that shit stank.
---
I only need 1 change and that is his MS during/after his charge..  MS during  charge should be 10% slower vs normal survivor  MS but after you let it rip he should  be at least 115% to 120%.
---
I like this cool feature they added where when you can always find a survivor by instantly going to where your ruin spawned first thing in a match! 
---
BASELINE CHANGES:
---
Leatherface’s movement speed when revving is now 100% (Up from 87.5%)
---
Leatherface’s chainsaw attack ends once he hits a single survivor (No more multiple instant downs)

---
Well at least Dwight is matching the colour pattern.
---
Dark Light Dark Light.
---
For what it’s worth rank doesn’t matter that much. There’s no rewards for being high rank and if anything it gets less fun the lower you go.  So long as you feel like you’re where you belong then I wouldn’t worry about it. 
---
When I first started the game, I started with the Huntress. I didn't know that I was poisoning the well by using IH and an ebony mori. The after chat was the most glorious thing that I had ever seen. Although I made no connection to it, they were looking up my twitch account and making threats. That's when I knew I found my game. 
---
I mean, I do that anyway because of Save the Best for Last. 
---
Maybe a little? I know there was a pretty major bug that let people basically brick your PS4 by message or friend request, I dunno if it ever got fixed. Report the guy tho, might get banned
---
Oh God this is so satisfying
---
Take my upvote, here
---
Then Feng turned around and gave you a blowjob and the other survivors clapped.
---
Oh fuck oh no you’re on PS4 oh no.
---
Sounds like the beginning of a happily ever after. Still by far my most favourite game withholding the toxicity in game of course. 
---
Voted for Laurie purely because the majority I encounter - both as Killer and Survivor - are waaaaay too keen to unhook players straight away for the points. I don't mind Decisive Strike, but she just always pops up as a hindrance to either side.
---
I guess her unique perks are pretty crappy, too. Not as bad as Ace's but he's a loveable, harmless peadophile.
---
Huntress of course, just look at those thighs
---
When I dress up as a badass prestige 3 Bill but get hanged to the hook by a teen with an edge is very outrageous
---
And if the Pig is blocking the correct box leaving the Survivor no option but to attempt to leave and thus die?
---
I think it's more of an issue with the servers than anything else.
---
That or people are playimg the games they got for Xmas.
---
Not surprised.
---
Among the survivors, he and Quentin were two that most likely snap first and turn into killers given the right nudge. All of that pent up rage and resentment can't be good. 
---
Unless I play doctor, coldwind. Its just too hard to see anyone through corn and I just don't like how easy it is to loose survivorsurvivors ESPECIALLY when I play shorter killers like hag, spirit, legion. Seriously if you play legion and you get coldwind, good luck to you
---
I really enjoy Spirit. Super satisfying and really fun! 
---
You ever try spider juice? It's a miracle worker.
---
Because for them, it is.
---
Spirit, easily. Try as they might, the only thing survivors can do to make me have an unfun game with Spirit is take the game hostage.
---
Those are typically symptoms of power problems. I would reconnect the pcie power cables (try two separate cords instead of the pigtail) and reseat the card in the pcie slot.
---
How does it screw you over?
---
So you can't satisfy your curiosity, but that's a small price to pay for preventing SWF groups from knowing about your end-game perks.
---
But it's not for everyone and it's not as bad as they claim it to be. I play with my friend and my brother almost every day (I've got a PS4 pro, they've got a standart PS4 and a slim), our internet is pretty bad but we always find games and wedon't experience any frame drops. It obly lags if the connection to the host is horrible.
---
She can attack on sight, making her better than Wraith (who has to decloak) and Freddy (who has to wait AT LEAST 3 seconds).
---
Her traps significantly slow the game down.
---
Her ambush allows her to soft-counter pallet loops.
---
Ty, i swear its red for me
---
When you really want WGLF stacks.
---
That’s you. Some of them might be lying, but not all of them. 
---
I don’t know why and all that. I just know I’ve seen enough video of what they’re talking about. I’m rank 1 also and have only a few issues here and there. I dunno why theirs bugs out so much.
---
I thought the spirit was going to be my least favorite killer to play because I'm not very good at killer and she's all about skill, prediction, and mindgames but she very quickly became my absolute favorite. I loved the idea, the lore, the look, and the power from the get go, I have to applaud the devs because she's creative, new, and disturbing; they genuinely outdid themselves. Actually playing her I lost a metric crap ton of games before I got the hang of her, but now that I've got some hands on experience how she works every game with her is an absolute blast. I still lose a game now and then with her pretty hard, but even when I'm losing I'm having a blast just zooming around the ghost world keeping people scared. But those games where I'm not losing? I feel like an absolute horrific god and the survivors stand literally no chance, chases end in seconds and loops are deadly for everyone who dares challenge me at one. Absolutely nothing is more satisfying in the entire game than getting a good possession off, and her potential to force survivors to make mistakes is unmatched. I used to play probably 80/20 survivor/killer, but ever since she came out I'm now probably 60/40 killer survivor.
---
We are not playing the same get are we? Or are you an ungrateful Fuck
---
I've never thought of it that way
---
Mobile game, silly adds, memes make fun of them.
---
My problem with gens isn't the speed they're done (though I agree it is a little fast). Its the fact gens get popped one after the other. Like seconds between. 
---
until you get gen rushed LUL
---
😕 sarcasm is great but like... Why doe

idk what console he plays on but I am on ps4 and I see NOED all the damn time also I hardly ever see billy lol
---
Uh, how did you find a 2 month old thread?
---
I can see why someone would say that Wraith is low mid addonless, but pig is high mid addonless for sure. You make a point about pig travelling the map at 92% speed, but only bad pigs do that. You should be uncrouched until you get 32 m away from a gen, then crouch, allowing for no time lost roaming while crouched. Pigs traps slow the game down quite a lot, and that time could be enough to win. Even saving seconds matters heaps in a game like Dbd. Sprint Burst won’t save anyone, as smart pigs should be uncrouching behind a wall then going for the grab/hit. Sprint burst can’t save you from a lunge if the pig is super close. Myers has some tools to help him with loops, but pig has her ambush, and good pigs can use this SUPER effectively, getting hits on loops that are usually safe as fuck. People think pig is low tier because no one knows how to play her, just like people think Freddy is trash because all people do is tunnel with him
---
Well regardless of how you change Learherface, he is going to be a worse Billy unless you directly nerf Billy (which, hopefully, will happen in the future if the game becomes more balanced).
---
Also, a character defined by a gimmick is a poorly defined character.
---
Mine killed everyone except me and caught me while trying to find the hatch. Not many things to do when theres noed and insta hatchets. 
---
That does explain it. I'm sorry if you didn't know, but Europe has way better player pool and way WAY WAY higher amount of high skill players. Cheap games like dbd get very popular in countries like Russia.
---
Maybe in NA you can faceroll without perks but it's often quite different here. Also I am not a survivor main, I have more time played as a killer and reached rank 1 with both including killer rank 1 without using Nurse or Billy. 
---
There is no elitism about one region being higher player pool and higher skill than the other. That is just a fact.
---
Why? Unless I suspect the killer of hacking their perks mean nothing to me if I’m dead.
---
this is an underrated post
---
Efficient looping makes it so 1 survive can keep the killer busy enough for all gens to be done. Even easier with DS involved.
---
NOED will 9 times outta 10 get you 1 kill against non altruistic survivors. If you run into a camping killer who has NOED you have no one else but yourself to blame.
---
And again, NOED has a guaranteed method of removal that actually aleviates one of the biggest grievances most killers have, games finishing too fast. But you whine and stomp your feet and refuse to do it.
---
So eat the NOED and shut your mouth.
---
Because they don't own the character.
---
Because they are game mechanics and if everything that pissed people off was bannable the entire community would get banned. 
---
I think it's random, to me it happens too and i have read others in reddit who happens too, i think they'fe fixing it, i hope faster than they fix the sloppy wraith bug
---
I mean not counting dlc. I have a bunch of them through playing but right now I just want this Plat and I've only got 1 offering left.

Trampoline?

Equip an ebony mori in my next match and bath in the salty chat afterwards. Usually works.

Hes grabbing the huntress axes and creeping toward legion SOMEONE WARN HIM
---
Submitting to babyrage won't work twice. Legion will get a rework. Instead of insta disconnecting like a fucking wanker how about you come up with some rework ideas that won't throw Legion in the Freddy dumpster? Since with the way they created Legion, they will end up either oppressive or useless with any amount of tweaking done.

The problem likes with the deep wounds mechanic and proxy chases, which is something BVHR needs to work on.

Well, I'm sorry for posting this... because it apparently upset a lot of people and it apparently means I'm looking for a excuse or whatever.

Sorry that I wasted your time.
---
You're right I guess
---
I enjoy all killers. Huntress has been my favorite since she was released, but I've recently started dipping into the wonderful world of console Nurse and it's actually been pretty fun.
---
You're a shitty DBD player and a horrible person.
---
If you’re playing against a swf group, One of them will purposefully take perks that only help them escape you and don’t help do gens because their goal is purely to get you to chase them and waste your time doing so while their team does all the gens. The best thing you can do is completely ignore them. They won’t have a toolbox or good gen perks so they aren’t much help doing gens and most likely they’ll chase you trying to get you to chase them anyway. Ignore them and they will just waste their time while you kill their friends
---
Debatable, I knew some pretty terrifying teenage girls when I was young.  
---
I always think to myself:
---
"I either go to the totem at the start of the game and reveal it to everyone, or not go there and have it cleansed by the survivor that spawned next to it"
---
Maybe he's colorblind. Yeah! EVER THOUGHT OF THAT! Stop being so insensitive!
---
I remember watching those monitors for a whole game with a hope to spot the killer/survivors, i was so sad when i found it it was just some 5 second gif on repeat, would've been an amazing little touch to make them functional
---
LOL!!!
---
Most myers players run M&amp;A, 8m TR on tier 2 which is basically nothing. So he has built in stealth. Can agree with clown actually, i just talked from a general consensus, most people see him as high mid tier. There are way too many open loops to nullify pig's ambush, even if it is an unsafe loop going for a mindgame will be shorter and more effective. On high ranks he doesnt get grabs but when you hear his breathing he is pretty much in lunge distance so it is almost guaranteed to get hit. Not to mention he has the best jumpscare build in the game, scratched mirror+M&amp;A+lery's/the game. But we can agree to disagree like you said. You wanted to hear my tier list(general consensus effects it so you'll see clown higher).
---
High-top: Nurse, Billy, Spirit(plausible)
---
Low-top: Spirit(plausible), Hag, Huntress
---
High mid: Clown, Myers
---
Low mid: Pig, Doctor, Wraith
---
High low: LF, trapper, legion
---
Lowest: Freddy
---
Doctor
---
Doctor. I just love when I'm wandering around a map and there's screams going off all over the place and a generator is exploding every few seconds. Doctors and fake pallets are appearing everywhere and as soon as you start a chase you see the red glow on the survivors back and know you've messed with them some more. Then you know you've done your job.
---
Second is Billy for the zoomies.
---
Well.  I may have exaggerated a bit,  Brutal killer a good portion of the time.  However,  now every match it seems is Entity Displeased.  Just a string of matches where I'm not even half as effective as I was. 
---
[When Dwight hits a Phantasm trap whose perimeter is perfectly tangential to his path.](https://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/020/001/krabs.jpg)
---
As a huntress main it's useless to camp the door. I don't want to wait 30 minutes when the survivor refuses to do gens. 
---
It's just Billy searching a chest
---
Wait, what the fuck? 😂
---
Leatherface and Huntress. Huntress because she throws axes and it's so fun to watch every survivor freak out when you raise that axe. Leatherface because he's challenging and everyone seems to underestimate him just because he's not billy but he's just as lethal in the right hands and can down survivors with ease...even when a good survivor knows how to run...it ends with him on a hook and almost every pallet gone leaving the rest with nowhere to go but at the end of a chainsaw.
---
Side mention to Nurse because I'm awful with her but it's so funny to go flying around the map and confuse the survivors because I'm not accurate at all with her. The meat plant level was the best game ever because I kept switching floors on accident then popping back up near the survivor.
---
Rank reset, most probably.
---
The devs KNOW why people dislike Legion.
---
Huntress. Nothing feels better than watching a survivor sprint burst away thinking they are safe just to have you chuck and axe super far away read their turn direction to take them down. Huntress actually feels more like I am hunting survivors rather than chasing them in circles. And her axes allow you to have control over to areas at once like watching a hooked survivor and a gen at the same time which I love.
---
Thanks man, I guess. 
---
I like playing Legion because he is just fun for me to play and I like the aesthetic, but he isn't my main. I also like playing Hag, Doctor, Clown and sometimes the Pig. 
---
It just gets annoy when people shit on the character constantly that you like.
---
But yeah... I get what you're saying.
---
How do you mean? It isn't my first rank reset, I've had DBD since 2017
---
Put controller sens to max and bind Q/E for turning. 
---
Don't use add-ons that affect your chargetime when you're learning.
---
My perkset is BBQ, Enduring, Spirit Fury and Knockout, but if you don't have Leatherface you can do Nurse's Calling + Whispers instead.
---
GET DOWN MR PRESIDENT
---
I tend to wait until the final Gen is done because NOED spawns on an outer totem 90% of the time. And that's simple enough to find. 
---
Same here. I reached rank 1 and it's being very rough. It's like a mix of overconfidence, really good survivors and silly ones who doesn't hide.
---
Ironically, as a survivor, rank resets are quite positive for my experience (minus the campers who try to stay on the same rank and that's it)
---
I agree a rework does need to happen, I liked the idea we got from the trailer, where they blended in with the survivors and then attacked them when they least expected it. It kinda makes me think that was the original idea but they couldn’t find a way to implement it. That said I still enjoy the current form of them
---
3rd time I've had this happen, first time I've escaped with it. As best as I can tell, even though it didn't say I'd obtained a new item in the post screen, I did keep one of them, but apparently only one. 
---
From previous experience with the bug I know putting a double item down turns it into a single, and dying with one still let's you keep the second. Certainly one of the odder bugs I've seen.
---
oh i get the feel :D i'm Freddy main, come on. he's nearly not as bad as reddit paints him. when used right, he scary. 
---
Like I said, its subjective. I think she can be decent it you are able to get early downs and early traps, otherwise her power is pretty mediocre and she has a rough time putting pressure on the map. That said, I dont think she is ridiculously weak, and I think Freddy is better than most make him out to be until the exit gates are opened.
---
Not sure where the hostility is coming from
---
yea, it's just the most stupid killer.
---
Except survivors derank too. 
---
This isn’t even a meme or a humour it is EXACTLY what dead by daylight is about
---
Man I agree with you, but usually the devs just say "it's a genuine tactic so we're not gonna do anything" and "you just need to genrush" I do the latter a lot with friends, we usually end up all dying anyway one by one... makes for a lame game as survivors and personally I don't understand why a killer would do this cuz its boring af. Id rather lose a game and hooked survivor than standing there waiting
---
M&amp;A, Whispers, BBQ, Enduring, Combat Straps - my build for "gen grab" Piggy. Carried me to r1 achievement. Not very kill-oriented build, though.
---
The entity gives them powah tho
---
Her power is pretty strong at loops with pallets. Traps early game don't do much as traps at late game do.
---
Looping is far more reliant on survivor skill than killer skill imo. A survivor that actually knows how to do loops properly can easily dunk on killers without a built-in loop counter
---
Yes, pure facevamp does indeed result in a 3k to 4k most of the time... at rank 20
---
After rank reset you have a chance to get more skillful survivors into your lobbies. Those, who played purple or even red ranks. So, games are harder for a couple of days.
---
I would say the Huntress, but i get stomped every game :P
---
Right now I'm very much enjoying Doctor and Wraith. Doctor because all you hear are screams and failed skillchecks, and Wraith because I am a slut for sneaky playstyles. 
---
Oh yeah... when I sometimes play survivor, I always get the chills when I hear his song slowly getting louder and louder
---
Plus the guys who were red but de-ranked pre reset to go even lower specifically to troll naturally low rank Killers.
---
I don't think that's necessarily true. NOED counters adrenaline, not the other way around. If people were building to counter NOED, they'd pick up small game or hope.
---
If they are just sitting in front of the hatch, just do gens so you can leave.
---
So i have read all the comments below, and I would like to address some of the points below.
---
1. Space Esports is VERY generous to be feeding money into the community and guess what you dont have to pay to enter. So in other words its FREE money if your good enough 
---
2. We are very limited due to upcoming conventions like pax and as we are based in NA we went for the best times for the crew.
---
3. This is DBD this game is far from perfect so we have to do the best we can with what the game allows.
---
4. Those in europe I am sorry these times dont work for you but this was the best times for us.
---
5. About my comment. You signing up to a tournament COMPETING for a cash prize.. you call it childish but it says exactly what was needed and people even agreed. People need to worry about their skill not the stupid oh someone can influence the map. So what if someone has there followers choose the map. Guess what the more publicity the more these guys can host more of these tourneys for you to WIN MONEY. These guys have put in thousands of dollars for this community to win... and guess what there has never been an entry fee!!! 
---
There are plenty of people who love the opportunity to win MONEY playing the game they love...
---
Beautiful.
---
Why should that slow down progress? Shouldn't that always give a bonus? What a weird decision.
---
Hope, Dead Hard, D-Strike, Resilience
---
I don't like to hide or lose killer aggro, so I don't use Iron Will
---
I don't run adrenaline, (I usually do) so that I can use dead hard in the final stage in the event they have Rancor or NOED
---
It's faster to de-rank right after rank reset, if I'm not mistaken.
---
Idk that I've seen people complain about finding games, but if you seriously don't lose frames when getting hit by like Sloppy or Noed, then grass on he ps pro.
---
For me and my friends, if we're struggling on the hook and the killer hits someone with Noed, the game skips so much from the status popping up that we die from missed inputs.
---
DBD is p2p connection that uses Steam to determine the region of the client to connect them to the host. Therefore noone connected to me should have a latency greater than one determined by how it was programmed. The only way to get high latency is by people using incorrect regions...which to my understanding cannot be switched through Steam anymore but can be done through other means. The other way is people using programs like netlimiter to reduce bandwidth for the application therefore inducing higher latency. So yes, I know what I am talking about.
---
Just because you dont want to accept the facts doesnt mean the other person is being egotistical when they are right. A small portion of the time they might lag and is not being caused by them is a degradation in their own network connection.
---
Lol, that last question are you serious? People who have "careers" in gaming have risked everything to win by cheating...(CSGO) and much more. Come on now stop looking at the world as if everyone has morals because unfortunately its not like that anymore.
---
Terrifying but not strong 
---
Tbh sloppy doesnt count sloppy is just a fucked perk
---
Not for survivor tho *laughs in killer*
---
It's not necessarily sloppy that causes it, it's the application of a status effect. Sloppy is just a common example.
---
Idk what ur talking about
---
Nah. Discord was just in a tizzy about the map selection. Its was more of hushing the complainers up and making them realize there was a bigger issie and was to focus on their game. No insults just more of a reality check
---
I can see that! I really like the vintage feel of the ski lodge--feels super 70s/80s--so I tried to pick colors that reminded me of it. I kind of want to make an old "band" t-shirt or something out of this.
---
I agree, even as a survivor main. I do tbag but only if the killer's a facecamping bitch
---
Because we love the game and want to give the community a chance to win some cold hard cash.... 
---
Oh, hi Marth. While yes, it's awesome getting paid for playing a video game, the commentators sucked and didn't know shit about the game. Wasn't very enjoyable for us viewers who cringed at how bad they are. Would've been better if TydeTyme was commentating on his own. 
---
i think legion should just completely reworked.
---
Trust me, its why when i had the opportunity to help i jumped on it. This org gets so much flak for the little things. Grant it i understand that point, but these guys are trying to feed money into the community at not cost to the competitors. This community is just impossible to please, but they have learned and adapt each tournament.  They are not a huge org to hire huge commentators for the event
---
Yes, this community is extremely toxic and yes, those kind of players are annoying as fuck.
---
I'd say its okay to camp/rush the toxic players
---
I did the same thing as you on Xbox, every survivor perk on my P3 Quentin... Now I just mess around ;-)
---
You can thanks the community for this one. They wanted a killer who can be mistaken for a player and who can vault through windows and pallets.
---
They're literally all nice but I guess it's opinionated.
---
he makes a handsome yet relatable "agh!"
---
his standard terror radius isnt 8 meters?  
---
when hes tier 1 its 6  
---
when hes tier 2 its 16  
---
and when hes tier 3 its 32  
---
those are his standard terror radius sizes
---
I love good teams. Idk what your talking about
---
Have you watched the old chainsaw massacre movies? Insidious camping leatherface is very cannon.
---
they should fix that, give my man myers higher eyes
---
I can confirm, he's still doing it.
---
As cool as this is, the blindness perk is worse than no mother. Not even the bloodpoint boost is worth it.
---
its a perk that lights up in the bottom right when a survivor is within 32 meters of you
---
Thanks so much for your support! I do hope you'll like the new videos I put out. Most of them will probably be tutorials for newer players and gameplay clips that are interesting. 
---
I don’t understand how this is fun for someone. When I play killer I enjoy the chase and it’s sort of like hide and seek, I don’t find enjoyment in just standing at one place. If someone or all players get out cool, I had fun regardless. 
---
Lmao
---
I got adept Nurse thanks to the magic of rank reset but I seriously just plan to try and farm out the void one because that's too damn hard
---
Oh sweet I wasn't sure since she was free
---
Without any other bonuses it's 75% for certain category post-game. So (ignoring other categories), 5000 Survival BPs + 75% bonus = 8750 BPs. But you'll see only 5k for Survival category on post-game screen, bonus will be counted in "Game bonus" string.
---
&gt; They wanted a killer who can be mistaken for a player
---
Pig wasn't good enough?
---
Because the hatch, from the killer point of view, is silly. 
---
if I have sprint burst im not gonna walk around the whole match, dont have time for that
---
Nausea: You periodically vomit similarly to bleeding. Killer gets new perk: Sawdust - Detect vomit
---
I think the whole appearence (despite they don't own the char) of the pig is a balance issue aswell, because the red is more visible, if they change something in the appearence she can get better or worse in some cases. 
---
Ofc this is an issue with other killers awell, but she has a stealth ability in her main kit.  
---
I know, I thought it was the « crop » buton and I was too lazy to remove it haha.
---
Not really. The top 5 really are the most annoying, try hard cunts I've seen so far. 
---
Because NOED is a no skill perk that gives the user a reward for doing poorly.
---
You're probably just doing them wrong (not the hatch one, hatch achievement was broken until recently). To get the adept killers you have to use only the 3 unique perks, no 4th perk, and kill all 4 survivors, and I'm pretty sure you can only mori 1 or 2 survivors
---
. . . . what was the name of this killer? 😂😂
---
If they are within X meters of the hook OR standing still AND not in a chase, I think generator repair speeds should significantly increase. 
---
yesterday I wasted my instaheal on Feng Min in the basement in case she didn't have any exhaustion perk. 
---
it was a Clown with no instadown. so I climb the stairs, get hit, run away. that idiot instead of doing the same or just hiding behind me tanking a hit, decided to hide in a locker.... rank 1(well, technically 9 that day), lads and gals. I know it's been a reset but come on...  she also had my Borrowed Time on her. what is wrong with people? she obviously got hooked again and died.
---
That's what sucks. Moris are annoying as sin to fight against.
---
Just watch puppers stream on a Friday on ps4. That should explain it 
---
I dont like removing multi hits, still a worse billy, and that knife addon seems really op
---
cooldown
---
I don't think he does.
---
they have the entity on their side, no knife required
---
the addons dont actually get better
---
Because we are all the same.
---
The number of people in this game with hundreds of hours who still play like this is so shocking to me, and it's far too common. Sometimes I feel like becoming a killer main just to take advantage of the fact that 90% of survivors don't seem to know what they're doing 
---
This post frustrates me on so many levels...  I don’t know why, but this was very frustrating to read given the time it probably took to type that.
---
you cant fool me with your big science words! this jake is obviously the killer
---
It would be silly to say that Europe is better than USA at American football. You can say that American football players in America are better than their counterparts in Europe. No elitism there. 
---
The difference is so big that you just have to acknowledge it and take it into consideration. The game is very different here and what works in high ranked NA might now work in high ranked EU because the level of play is higher. 
---
I've hardly seen swf teams using OoO tbh. You have to be a new level of tryhard for that. Wouldn't say 9/10 maybe more like 6/10 at least :p
---
This just in, no popular game in recent history has ever completely removed a character from the game because of community complaints no matter how loud. 
---
But if you wanna de-pip that much and give the killer a quitter bonus... go off I guess? 
---
My go to lately has been BBQ, Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, Nurse's Calling.  Whispers can also be solid for many reasons, like letting you never waste time crouch walking unnecessarily and giving you a heads up if you're fishing around for a nurse's calling proc.  It can also pair well with Monitor and Abuse to make sure they never hear your heartbeat before you're sneaking up on them, but I find it to usually be unnecessary.
---

I cant tell you how many times i self care at a pallet instead of dropping it and get hit

---
Ralph is a better huntress than scott, very underrated huntress main.
---
This totem looks bad but can be nice for the killer because, being so much in the open, you can easily check on it.
---
No nevermind, it sucks.
---
Owned
---
Not really. I had plenty of survivors escape and even teabag me when I was running Frank's mixtape.
---
you do realise it's not the fact they got 4k with this piece of shite build and killer that made me want to wish locusts on their crops? if they'd say "no" to my "remove Legion", i'd never be salty, i'd just laugh. but they said ez. as if we were bad and not the build+power broken. 
---
But Claudette's perks are great :o 
---
Hey, do you mind if I ask what kind of things you mean when you say  'the things that survivors have available that "reward for doing poorly"'? I have no strong opinion either way about this and just want a better perspective :)
---
honestly? i'm mad at devs. this is not owned. "owned" is perkless and with no add-ons. this is really ez but not because someone's bad, because the power+this build has no counter. 
---
I still have common Bloody Party streamers.
---
Teabagging says "I'm so confident that I can stop in a chase to taunt you and still get out."
---
Nothing toxic about proving that wrong.
---
Kick his ass c bass
---
or the killers dodge when they see it’s SWF
---
Prayer Beads Spirit has joined the server
---
I do the same thing they are the cockiest community I've ever seen cuz it's easy af to escape this game if you play with that Bs moral code. I torture them on purpose now and they don't abuse me at the gate or take the game hostage anymore!&lt;
---
Then you are a fucking dumbass if you believe that.But go ahead you are now the reason the community is toxic.Instead of being better than them you just chose revenge against others that did nothing wrong.
---
Nurse has 4 blinks. I don’t think balance is their top priority.
---
That's another thing that could be an option in the controls, the ability to toggle on or off the auto-aim.  If you wanted to get even crazier with it, it could be a slider for how much of the effect you want, but if that's too much then just a simple on/off option would be great for many players. 
---
You did well for killing him
---
Yeap, SFM. I am messed. Meg is beautiful, you're lying : )
---
Leatherface is worth the DLC money because he has this hidden perk that makes people so fucking angry just by being in his terror radius.

I can stream for you right now if you'd like to see how long it's taking to find a match as a survivor. It's been 15 minutes and nothing. I've even restarted the game.
---
If SB prevents you from running you don't know how to use SB. My younger self can relate tho.

I don't think they can grab you immediately after hitting you, giving you a few second window to jump out
---
If you use one fully do you lose both
---
I bet you bm.  Kill allsurvivors
---
I play survivor 80% of the time. I'm happy you tunneled the living crap of him. 
---
I just hate when my team mates do this kind of shit to the killer. Sometimes I wish I would see them get Mori-ed as I stand and watch.
---
Recently I had the most fucked up team - 1 DCed after being hooked once. I did 3 gens and dodged the killer quite well. The other 2 just ran randomly on the map after the killer, teabagging, body blocking me few times to get caught. One dies, the other runs away. I get caught by the killer and hooked first time. The last survivor just stares and points at me as the killer was to my right at 10meters. He didn't try to unhook me (he wasn't hooked once, he could). He survived cause I did enough gens to unlock the hatch as option. The killer apologized he caught me and not that asshole. Never feel sorry for assholes and always remember there are survivors that get screwed by their own so maybe be a bit merciful towards them :)

Trapper, i love that snap when i have a trap in a spot not viable enough to be expected at all but viable enough to warrant trapping thrle path, for example grassy corners of large objects like the mcmillan water tower, they circle it and run tight over it because running against walls amd corners is valuable time saved.
---
Sry. I recently on reddit.
---
That's really nice of you. I dont want killers to feel like they have to play a round a certain way, that's not fair to them either. I'd just like to at least not depip and then I would happily let them kill me. It just sucks. I dont care much about rank but I dont want to be pushed back into yellow ranks because I just dont enjoy playing in that rank. I prefer to stay in the green or purple ranks.
---
plizz dont gay
---
The survivor in this commented about why they tbagged. The killer downed them at the hatch and walked away letting them think they could have hatch only to quickly come back and hook them. That's just unnecessary and scummy.
---
Spine chill is the shit! 
---
Run spine chill, sprint burst, lightweight,and a perk of your choice (i run adrenaline or we'll make it) to disappear into thin air when the killer is on your heels, or if you hate sprint burst with your heart, run lithe and dance with me instead
---
Btw lighweight is also really underrated. It helps you not only get away more reliably, but even sometimes break chases in jungle gyms, buildings, and pallet loops

The answer is probably already on r/dbdgonewild
---
Facecamping isn't against the rules, and I don't know what else you'd expect the killer to do when there's an open hatch.  Is he supposed to just give it to you?  Having watched the actual full video, I didn't see him send any messages.  If he did, you could reply back to him and use that time to easily slip by and jump in while he's busy typing.
---
Why didn't you use a pic of legion in his female form?
---
If its early game just eat every single pallet. They wont have pallets to loop mid late match. If its past mid match and its a mastee looper leave him.
---
I have my notifications not shown in the video. But he did send me some hateful comments whether you believe it or not. And I don’t expect him to give me the hatch that’s why I was wasting his time since he just wanted to camp it. I don’t see how this is fun for anyone. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Here is a little hint if Leatherface has somebody hooked in the basement that person is dead unless Leatherface is preoccupied with something else if he's not preoccupied avoid going to save them.
---
Even then the thing is preoccupied with has to be at least a decent distance away if it's close enough that he could easily just come back don't go for the save
---
The hatch isn't a fun mechanic for the killer either.  It's boring and comes down to who has more time to waste.  From the video though, it sounds like you left the game due to having anxiety about the situation.  Your friend was right, if you did a generator you'd have gotten three ways to escape and if he just hit you with M1 you could use the speed boost to easily straight line to the hatch before he could catch up.
---
Same to killers w noed. I’ve had so many games where all 4 would have escaped but killer had noed so he got as all or 3 and yeah I could have just run away but I’m willing to sacrifice myself so that my team could escape. I know that some salty killer main will say that “LOL NOOB JUST CLEANSE ALL TOTEMS AND DONT GEN RUSH HAHAHAHAHAH” but to u just dribble with ds or use enduring

Legion. And I have a reason that, while most will laugh at, its serious for me. I suck at looping, mind gaming, ect, during chases. I have my moments when I moonwalk a surv and get a dying state, but despite watching vids of popular dbd streamers, I cant get it down. Legion helps me ignore all of that nonsense. It makes the game much more fun for me personally. 
---
Some of you guys might just tell me to git gud, but I just wanna enjoy the game the way I want with the money I paid for it. 
---
Thats not to say I dont enjoy playing killers that require mind games and such. Its just my fav killer to play is Legion, cause he ignores all that.

Came from an insta hatchet, BBQ&amp;C, camping Huntress. Saw Bill go down instantly, and realised it was gonna be a tough match. Freed him, only for him to get tunnelled and DC.
---
Huntress spent the next 4 gens chasing the obsession, so we gen rush. He goes down right as I pop the last gen. Huntress checks the other exit gate, and I unhook him. Somehow, we managed to open the exit gate, only to get down again by a long range throw. 
---
As Huntress goes off to the other exit gate, I unhook him and barely dodge her throw. And we escaped! 
---
So did the gen 😂
---
Haha, I'm glad you think so! That's what I was going for!
---
I see DS a lot on here and idk what that even is lol
---
What? 
---
Lmfao at him raging.
---
I had this too. I chased a Quentin (no surprise) late into the game (only about 2 gens left) who started tbagging at every pallet. I get him down and then stand over him while the rest do the gens (I had Rancor). They do the gens and I kill this clown because I'm fed uo of Quentin players being toxic little cunts.
---
Postgame he asks why I 'bullied' him.
---
Like wtf? How can you be a cunt and then try to play victim?
---
I'm hopeful but not holding my breath. They were supposed to have fixed some totem spawns once already

---
Doesn’t matter. David’s an experienced fighter (hell shirtless David is *fucking ripped*) and something like a good ol’ one-two liver shots/crotch shots/chin punches can take them out too 
---
It sucks when you get toxic survivors but not every survivor is like this. Please consider not going down to their level of toxicity because it only makes matters worse. Just hit them out of the gates if they're tbagging. If you get BM'd frequently which I don't see how it'll happen but if you are running into games where survivors try to hold the game hostage or wait at the gates consider investing in getting Franklin's Demise as a teachable or if already unlocked then use it. In my opinion one of the best things you can do to a toxic survivor is whack the item off of them and use it as bait in case they try to go back for it.
---
Whenever there is an opportunity...
---
Its funny because when you look up videos it was always killers like wraith getting bullied and never a Nurse (aside from rookie nurses). Hmm wonder why. Marth 88 has a video where rhey tbag him and act cocky as wraith and then he sees them the next game as Nurse and they dont even have time to tbag because they're getting downed every few seconds.
---
I can play Spirit or Hag and they may attempt a tbag early on but they soon stop it when they're fearing for their life.
---
Meanwhile if I play someone like Pig just for fun they'll do it over and over and over again because rheybknow you can't do shit with all the ultra safe pallets in the game. The devs need to fix the issue for bottom tier killers.
---
Believe it or not when I was playing killer earlier and chasing someone they ran straight past two different pallets that they could've use to create distance or even stun me 
---
They've talked about it for so long yet done nothing. The devs really are slimy incompetent pieces of shit.
---
Same thing happened to me! We even had 3 BPS but she just killed everyone within 2-3 minutes. I barely got a hatch escape. Who hurt you, Huntress

&gt;David is hooked near me so I wait about 10 seconds (I saw the Wraith leave
---
That doesnt make it safe to unhook. If the killer isnt far away or comitted to another chase, dont be so quick to unhook. You can hang on the hook for a minute. All the times i get unhooked immediately after the terror radius is gone, only for the killer to come back instantly and chase me again. Unhooking quickly just benefits the killer. 
---
Not the previous poster but:
---
DS = Got caught because you went to the wrong tile?  Stab him and continue looping elsewhere! :D :D :D

Instaheal = Got hit at a pallet because you were camping it or because you misjudged where the killer was?  *heals instantly* There we go!  All better now!
---
Adrenaline = Finally got caught at endgame?  Killer wants to make sure you die?  Nope!  Get pulled off the hook fully healed with a sprint burst!
---
Borrowed Time = Survivors are swarming the hook or not even waiting until you leave?  Killer can just down them, righhhhht?  Nope!  Borrowed Time! An EXTRA health state! :D :D :D  Killer gets to watch them tbag at the exit gate!

1 if you get looped that much you should move on to another person because that person is out of your league
---
2 no ed 9 times out of 10 will get another kill because one person will most likely be dead by then so no.
---
While you can guaranteed it doesnt go off 90 percent of the times we are not able to actually get the totems seeing how one of them are hidden.People are usually too busy doing the gens.Also if you want to slow the game down dont use noed maybe ruin or run thana.Last killers complain about looping yet its the only way to fight a killer unless you want them to take weapons in the game.So take looping and DS you losing to one person because you get tunnel vision isnt our fault
---
Last getting camped isnt my fault because its the killers choice of leaving
---
&gt;At least PC doesn't have sensitivity problems though, to where the auto-aim for lunges can overpower your ability to turn and follow the survivor with your swing.
---
Autoaim still exists on PC and can screw you over by turning you into a corner you want to swing around. Why it exists on PC i dont know though. 
---
How can that happen as the last survivor when the last survivor on the hook is instantly put into struggle mode?

I hear ya. Hatch showdowns are no fun. I know Freddy gets a lot of hate but he’s my main, I love playing him, and I’m garbage with everyone but Freddy. That being said, he is literally useless in situations like hatch grabbing, grabbing off of a gen, or when someone is activating the exit gate. You have to wait 7 fucking seconds before you can grab or even injure so unless they’re asleep and already injured there is zero point trying to find the hatch and wait. I see other killers do it more often than not when I play survivor. Hoping Freddy gets some love soon
---
Had a person tunnel off hooks immediately. Gets into a chase with me and couldnt catch me for a while. Ended up getting hatch after a 2 min chase. Then said ggez ace you arent good.
---
If you look up or down they can't blind you 
---
My spirit had been broken long ago. I let them have their fun and they let me eat my muffin! Win win in my opinion!
---
Survivor doesn't deserve hatch either. It's a trump all fuck you, and rewards the survivor for losing.
---
Unless I didn’t see a patch when rank reset rolled I literally just Deliveranced off a hook as last survivor this last weekend. Didn’t force me into Struggle phase when that other survivor left the match.
---
You know how hatch *only* opens if everyone except one survivor is considered escaped/dead? Those same rules apply to hooking insta-killing. So if someone is technically alive/still in the game when you get hooked and they leave after, you can still struggle/try to escape. 
---
The style reminds me of the Krallice logo I think. Very nice.
---
Double trap a dropped pallet. Maximum mindgame.
---
hm... pc? i had this happened to me and i know many others too. but it would usually go away in couple hours. which region do you live in? 
---
Tbh gen rushing is more like baiting saves and then proceeding to tunnel for fast kill. Not sure what is the equivalent of camping, maybe being super immersed and then waiting on hatch until your team mate dies.
---
i don't know what a bad person is D: but i i do hate those playing this build with Legion. it's disgusting, frustrating and uncounterable. 
---
It's even a safe pallet you should always kick :(
---
lol. what add-ons did they use and how bad could they be to not catch up? 
---
Your point?
---
That it's well-made and stable.
---
To shreds you say?
---
Fair enough
---
If only you could look up to avoid this.
---
Legion's Deep Wounds depleting if he's chasing the target, so bad Legions will take blood tracking perks and follow the blood while looking the other way.
---
This allows them to be on top of their target while Deep Wounds keeps counting down (Since they aren't looking at them, they aren't in a chase).
---
All in all, it looks like they're moon walking to chase you.
---
Both.
---
Play how you want, but getting offended by BM to a point where you're ready to throw the game to ruin it for someone else says a lot.
---
I'm not sure if that's gay or cute. 
---
I believe it. Muffins are Magnificently, Masterfully Magical 
---
There are basically two schools (or three) of thought on Legion:
---
1) He needs a complete rework given his current situation: His kit allows him to be extreamly obnoxious to fight against but also not as effective as most killers. The game basically turns into a "Guess who?" on who's the poor unlucky bastard that gets found first and then dies. This is of course caused by some problematic design problems on the killer (too effective in the chase using his power, very hard to nigh impossible getting away from him). Right now if you continiously use his power in a chase, they are practically a "Basic Bitch Nurse" with much more ease of use and much lower killing potential, with a good dose of tunneling.
---
2) His execution might not be stellar, but we can see what he was meant to be: It's obvious that the guy isn't meant to tunnel. Behaviour knows how shitty it feels and he had a counter to this strategy built into his kit (which was the double stun on DWed survivor hit) but community feedback basically told them to remove it, which was extreamly bad. Legion could be an amazingly fun to play and to fight against killer if only the "Chaser" playstyle was more encouraged and maybe even slightly buffed. The guy can vault pallets and windows with ease but the 110% movement speed limits his ability of winning loops, making mindgames way more challenging and fun for both parties, while keeping him at a decent enough kill potential to be effectively used in Rank 1.
---
1 and a 1/2 (The "3rd" SoT) ) Legion isn't broken, his add-ons are. Move away from their add-ons' power and make him a better killer as a consequence, or force them to break the habits some add-ons encourage (Stab Wounds Study to follow DWed survivors and Frank's Mixtape to just tunnel DWed survivors)
---
I might be biased but I love the Legion as a killer. Their concept is just brilliant: it's this mock-up of a survivor that shares abilites with them, stalls the game and runs around like a crazed maniac on crack cocaine, everything about the guy but the ability and some add-ons is top shelf shit. The entire character design, the walk-cycle (which took me a long time to realize it's a mock-up of the survivor's walk, it's literally the same) and the fun factor involved make me think these edgy bois have the potential at being the most fun killers in the game while still being somewhat effective, they just need some tweaking.
---
Didn't throw the game at all. Hooked him, left, returned when he got saved and tunneled. Still got the 4k :)
---
True but exhaustion perks help extend chases which is needed when you’re not a pro like me lol 
---
Yeah like when I was hooked first in a game. The killer downs someone and picks them up. I get unhooked and the killer puts them down and come straight back to me. FeelsTunneledMan
---
Usually in these memes the "Chad" is the good guy everyone loves and wants to be and the "Virgin" is the sore loser everyone doesn't want to be, so I made the meme accordignly :P

That every Nurse was hacking
---
Its still easy for them to cleanse totems just in case. Each of them will see at least 1, thats four totems gone already. Plus they can count them easy.
---
3-4 man swf tend to cleanse all totens anyway. Barely takes them anytime compared to 1-2 man who waste time running around looking for them.
---
Oh thats lame lmao, what are the supposed counters to this?
---
That the blood web’s nodes didn’t get consumed. I thought perks in your inventory were consumed like power ups and I also thought exhaustion made you slower. I ran no perks for my first 10 ranks. I’m an idiot.
---
How many times do you play against full sfw? I have played only twice and i have 800 hours on the game (at least I remember two)

Killer kills, survivor survives... games no more complicated then that. Unless you're cheating or breaking rules you play your way. 
---
If you impose a certain code of play on yourself like no camping or tunneling that's great and you're a person guy who wants to enjoy the game and also have some empathy about your fellow players enjoyment. 
---
If some arse wants to be toxic to you and you choose to tunnel and camp him and be a dick right back to him then so be it.
---
It makes me laugh because those guys who will tbag and flashlight you at pallets and other unnecessary things to be toxic usually DC or rage when they do get tunneled and it can't be a surprise to them when they act the way they do.

oof i just give succy succy 10 bucky and buy pc for 6k
---
Except that’s they way you’re supposed to play legion.  Wound a bunch of people and track them down while the bleed out.
---
People don’t understand that the whole point of legion is to make tracking lethal.  He’s bad in a straight chase without a very particular add-on and is quite susceptible to jukes.  You’re meant to use deep wounds to keep survivors on a short leash, and then track them down and finish the kill.
---
Whether folks enjoy this or not is its own issue, but the legion already does what they’re supposed to, more or less.  The folks who play them like a standard m1 chase killer don’t get it.  Much like nurse, the idea is to totally circumvent the standard gameplay loop.  Again, not saying this was the right choice.

Sprint Burst extends a chase in a different way. I can't tell you how many times recently someone has sprinted up to me as Legion, but since I have SB while I'm just sitting on the generator, they can't get close enough before I run away and then they lose their power. Wraith, Pig, Leatherface, Doctor, Freddy, Clown, all the same story. Not only do you use SB to avoid their power, you don't take the first hit so early in the chase like you might if you're using Balanced Landing or something. I'm not saying SB is the best exhaustion perk, I honestly don't know which one is best (I think Dead Hard is best in the right circumstances but I'm not positive). I just think Sprint Burst is better than people seem to be giving it credit for lately

Say what you want, but camping and tunneling make the game BORING!!!
---
It's a strategy that insecure and bad killers use. When I play killer I hook and leave. Usually get at least a 2K, often a 4K. ALWAYS have fun and get lots of points.

---
SB doesn't extend a chase, usually, it just gets you from an unsafe area to a pallet from basically anywhere.
---
Lol
---
So we just need more money...
---
Balanced Landing is probably the best, Dead Hard loses a lot of value when you're up against a killer that waits for it.
---
I main killer because i want to level up my survivors but survivors get little blood compared to a nurse with bbq and Distressing. 
---
I was talking about “tunneling”. Camping is most effective when the Survivors don’t rush the gens. 
---
Everyone deranks bc the high ranks are filled with meta stuff and toxicity on both sides so if you don’t use stuff like that you just hurt your chances
---
wow looks like 3d saw 
---
Maybe play what seems the most fun? None of them are fun to play against. But I am sure they will fix Legion so that less will DS when they face him.
---
Time to release Bunny Feng and make it ultra legendary and auric cells only then!
---
Yah it sucks bc the chad chaser is how legion is supposed to be played but he’s a very weak killer when played like that. When you bs and moonwalk chase or only use franks mixtape he’s much more effective but also no fun at all. 
---

---
I play legion and run sb, ruin, thanatophobia and noed but I dont tunnel. In my opinion legions playstyle is made to slow the game down. I usually get all survivors killed and only 1 or 2 gens were done. I have gone against some cunt legions that tunnel but I dont get were all the hate is coming. 
---
That totem went sicko mode and wound up there
---
what are you doing Wraith, you cant do shit.
---
Why would someone care if they miss DS. They can still use it later?
---
On console the same button for self care is also the drop pallet button, sometimes ill heal myself a get smacked instead of dropping pallet
---
I'd say Clown because at the very least his perks are much better. Bamboozle and Pop Goes the Weasel are top imo perks. Legion only have good Discordance on them. 
---
people say Legion is fun only because it's really easy to play them. Clown is much harder to master. you need to know maps well, lure survivors into zones with no loops and so on. 
---
&gt; stares at Survivors until the moment they are dead
---
oh my....
---
There's no possible way BHVR intended for legion players to equip bloodhound, then do all chases backwards while looking at the blood.
---
 The moon walking is what people don't like because it feels like a very cheap way to exploit the bleed out mechanic.
---
&gt;Except that’s they way you’re supposed to play legion.  Wound a bunch of people and track them down while the bleed out.
---
Yeah? That's not what the dude was complaining about, he was complaining about the moonwalking.
---
They're very different Killers.
---
Clown is built to shorten chases, end loops, and keep Survivors from Escaping a chase. He plays like any other 115% Killer except you throw stuff at people while chasing them (you don't even have to hit them, just hit near or ahead of them). His add-ons make him better at this, except for one UR that turns him into a poor man's Huntress.
---
Legion ignores chases and stealth in favor of running really fast and stabbing a bunch of people. You can get kills with Legion, but you can't play them like you play other Killers. With Legion you can: 1.) Run Frank's Mixtape and tunnel people until they die, 2.) Run Bloodhound and moonwalk people until they die, 3.) Play Legion with Frenzy duration and speed add-ons and just run around smacking everyone until you catch someone out and can down them (with BBQ+Chili you can get more points than Doc and in less time), or 4.) Run cooldown add-ons, smack people once run up to them in Frenzy, deactivate it and smack them again. Each of their Ultra-Rares have unique quirks, but those are the four main ways that I know of.

I hope this helps you make a decision.

Nurse really isn't as hard as this community pretends she is. A few hours of spamming her and I mastered her blinks. People seem to be grasping at straws to defend her brokeness and use her "high skill requirement" for it. 
---
IDk about that
---
It's too late for them now, Entity help them.
---
Yes, skill is pretty good against it. Not all killers have it tho
---
No they can't, DS is a one time thing. If you miss it, it's gone for that match, it's only when you don't try doing anything at all while the skillcheck prompt is there that you can use it again later.
---
There were no results when I searched for him :(
---
I just don't care about them most of the time. Med kits are the most annoying tho thx to the increases chance of skill checks add-ons.
---
The moment his girlfriend spoke accentfree german left me fallen out of my chair.
---
Legion is a lot more fun IMO. But both are very straight forward.
---
I just started playing DbD and I pretty much play legion exclusively for the killers, and I haven’t run into DC’s that often unless I do something that the survivors consider toxic (tunnelling, camping slugging etc) It depends on how you actually play the killer. for me at least I have yet to see a survivor DC when they realize that they’re against a legion. Personally I’d recommend legion but that could be some bias cause it’s a Canadian killer that is from near where I live
---
With shards, sure. Don't waste your money on Legion.
---
No he said he was going to break my PS4 in my computer and when I asked him how he called me gay
---
haha just get Lithe, much better perk
---
But not getting a bonus for working together is completely unnatural and doesn't even make sense in the nature of the game.
---
So if everyone works on a single generator, it's not only faster but if he finds one there are still 3 other people on generators continuing the work. But if he finds a gen on that 3 or 4 work, he actually breaks up the whole, complete working on generators at that moment and has a higher chance to get one, if not even more. So working together is already a risk for survivors and in the favor of the killer, so a little speed boost would seem completely normal, but also just from logic alone should working together gives you a boost. It's completely mind boggling to me that you normally should get a penalty for that. It's like "Ok game I finally understand, you just want to help me, working together is risky so I go away".
---
Pretty dumb.
---
Or if you want to Rant/ciclejerk about DS or NOED
---
Just got decisive strike for Dwight :D can’t wait to see that cool animation
---
I don't think that's a problem. What else are survivors supposed to do? Just run in a straight line and get hit? I don't think I've ever had anyone complain about juking. The worst that's happened is when the killer is just focused on me and wastes their entire time trying to down me while all the generators get done. When that happens to me, I usually get face camped when I get hooked. I don't tbag, flashlight spam, or even play SWF.
---
For a rank 1 killer, who cares if ppl teabag. I kind of wished all survivor would teabag at pallets for me.  Look at it this way, instead of running away, they stay there....much much easier to catch them instead of being halfway to the next loop. 
---
Franklin's knife is literally Devour hope, except actually op. It has no counter, and the downsides are far, far exceeded by free moris. you can't even get a full stack of BBQ without sacrificing an immediate kill
---
Oh right. 
---
😂😂😂
---
I started off with hag and then went to leather for bbq. Now i only play nurse because it's pretty much a guarantee 3k with normal addons. 
---
No u
---
It's annoying and 'maybe' something that is stretching game mechanics? But honestly, it's at least 100% player skill, even if it isn't the hardest thing to do, so at least you can say you were 'outplayed'. There are way worse things to worry about as a killer, so this really doesn't register.
---
Preach brother! The Chaser Legion is better than "Frank's Mixtape"
---
I didn't want a patch that fixes everything as you tried to pretend I said. I wanted the game to have an improvement. Not an entire patch of worse performance. But thank you for defeating a straw man of me.
---
I HAVE A PLAN. HAVE SOME GODDAMN FAITH!!

Doesnt hugging walls make u slower cuz of the collision? 
---
Just let the killer kill you, you wont waste a single pallet. trust me, im a survivor main.
---
What else are you supposed to do lmao. Stand there and get hit ?  
---
I also never t bag but somehow get facecamped when I run the killer around for several gens. Especially killers who can't handle T walls and shack loops, they get very angry. It's the price to pay I guess.
---
Pretty often actually, I'm usually able to do it when I have the full bonus though.
---
No, you'll run the same speed as long as you are running diagonal to the wall.
---
I love playing against a good Legion. Seeing that MF sprinting at you at full speed is goddamn terrifying. That being said, and as a survivor main, I fucking hate that whole "specific killer = DC" Shit. That's kid shit. it doesn't matter what strategy the killer is using, you shouldn't get to dictate what killer someone uses. We're all here to play the game, and sometimes it's not always going to go the way you want. But to DC and leave your team in the wind like that is absolute trash. I fucking loathe  Leatherface but I won't DC just because that's the killer I got.
---
Kicking the gen I hink, but he didnt even have overcharge.
---
Finally someone agrees that moonwalking is fucking stupid.
---
It was a hard choice between Meg or Caudette as both usually come with the standart DS, Adrenaline, Sprint Burst, SC Loadout, but Claudettes are just waaaaay to confident with their free invisibility that they think that it won´t hurt when I Shove my cleaver up their behind.
---
Killer Main: DS op swiver get of beck jst bi skell chuck *cries in killer*
---
I guess never. I reported this shit for several months now since this problem also occurs on his rowdy pants. This one has the same fucking bugs implemented. What the actual fuck. How do we raise awareness for this? It's annoying asf.
---
I wasnt worried until people started telling me to be worried. I did report him but it has been 12 hours and nothing has happened to my ps4 or computer. Since when have criminals been punctual 
---
That bright pink camo
---
Vaulting pallets or windows doesn’t consume the frenzy bar (as far as I know) and when the legion lands a hit on a survivor for the first time(resets each frenzy) it refills the frenzy meter, and then the second hit on the same survivor (during the same instance of frenzy) will automatically end their frenzy and completely drain the bar.
---
 Sorry about the poor formatting
---
His favorite song is a locker noise remix
---
Had the same thing happen to me with the clown today, thank god for dead hard 🙏🏻
---
Whoever voted ace is getting face camped
---
I never understood why survivors do this. It's not like you can't win the match without DS. I never even use the perk because I personally think there are better perks out there.
---
Better watch the wording there or survivors might start to get suspicious. 
---
Yeah thats what i mean aswell, but every big streamer thats not no0b3 says you have to play immersed, and i get a lot of hate from killers, im just wondering what killermains on reddit mean
---
The bloodwebs are mostly randomized (there will always be two perks and a certain amount of the various rarities, but mostly randomized). 
---
I always feel like I can never get any offerings, always just add-ons and items (which I never use).
---
No mither, object of obsession, sixth sense and self care
---
Thought scratch marks appear when you walk 
---
Didn’t know pallets could stun, so I threw down every single pallet I saw so I could jump over it if I was being chased in that area later 
---
Which streamer are you talking about ? Most of the top dbd streamers can and will loop
---
But you use Julie’s for more Speed and smack them and run in front of their safety spot and then cancel. 
---
Soon we will get Pornhub streamers
---
If that happens hold back walk and swing without lunging. Typically hits them.
---
Can they vault without using their pallet? I thought they could only vault if they were using frenzy?
---
Could you imagine if survivors could literally fight killers? I'd personally find that more entertaining than genrushing.
---
made with memeatic
---
I thought it was J-Hope too but could never get confirmation! 
---
^ This
---
Just look up, it's that easy. If you don't you'll get chain blinded forever.
---
sad the licensed killers wont get any cosmetics. 
---
i personally think itd be worth the investment. 
---
Adept legion soon adept nurse 
---
You mean suzies then I assume, Julie’s mixtape slightly reduces fatigue time, which doesn’t stack with the cold dirt
---
Food is not an Escape
---
the bill was fair, though
---
Spirit beads is great, although it doesn’t prevent what’s annoying about it or the annoying amount of pressure it applies. As a spirit player, you’d be better off moderately decreasing the haunting duration to sacrifice chase potential for gen grabs.
---
These changes aim to make the add-ons more interactive to play against, which they honestly aren't right now. Yes, you can dodge a Huntress hatchet and yes they have 3, since almost all of them run Infantry Belt, but it is frustrating to be punished for a single mismovement.
---
For Spirit currently, her power removes sound emission inside the Terror Radius by default, and running Beads removes it in general. With the change, you'd have to be more careful of when to start phasing in order to get a grab. The Terror Radius of your Husk will be slightly bigger than the range of Tier 3 Whispers, so you'd have to be more strategic if you relied on Whispers for beads gen/totem grabs.
---
For Iridescent Head, it currently is really annoying to play against, and it often encounters a lot of disconnects simply because survivors don't want to face it. Applying a Deep Wound status would give the survivor a window of opportunity to try and waste the time of the killer, or if Huntress decides to hit and leave, the survivor will Mend themselves. This makes Huntress have many options when using Iri Head. She either plays out as Legion, in which she tries to waste as much time as possible for the survivors, or she'll either commit to a chase and try to break it periodically, as the amount of time required for the survivor to be downed by Deep Wound is minimal.
---
I don't think I covered all points, but I'd like to know what other people think about these add-ons, and the changes I presented.
---
What does moonwalking mean in this instance?
---
I considered that, but wasn't really sure, so I posted it as is and try to get the opinions of others. I thought it'd be frustrating for Huntress to have ranged Legion attacks.
---
Working together on gens grants a higher degree of coordination, though, and is the very rough equivalent to tunneling.
---
If you concentrate your efforts into systhematically getting gens done one by one at a time with a 4x speed bonus, it all turns into a guessing game for the Killer and makes it so much harder for Killers without more map pressure (Hillbilly, Nurse) to play. Much harder. It's a very strong tactic and if left without additional rules it will just turn into the absolutely needed tactic at all times, which isn't what the devs are looking for. It is still a very, very strong tactic and in the hands of a good team will most likely destroy most Killers, but it was way too unbalanced before.
---
It's not less powerful, even after the "nerf". Quite the contrary, unless the Survivor team is made up only of solos without an ounce of teamwork. 
---
Yes, it’s probably better for new players actually.
---
I will say that I find it incredible that a small team like Behaviour (it was small back then) managed to birth such a great game. They didn't even expect it to become as popular as it is. This is why there are no dedicated servers. It seems now that they are realising that they could very well have a mainstream multiplayer game on their hands. Lets hope they work to that potential.
---
Actually I love using Third Seal on Mirror EW 1 Michael at The Game. The map's just perfect as certain locations are tough to call out, even for SWF, while the totem locations can also be damn sneaky. Plus, the less they know about your location, the more they're gonna crap their pants when you suddenly pop up behind them lol.
---
But as I haven't been on reddit for a good amount of time, would someone dare to explain me what that "moonwalking" term means in regards to Legion? I'm only aware of the Myers memes but this is new to me.
---
Reading all the comments and I gotta say a lot of this community can’t look at a game they just played and think “Hm, they just played really well. I couldn’t catch them” 
---
This guy clearly knew he had a bad game and just embraced it and had a good laugh with it, as well as a good snack. Good for this guy :)
---
I get almost too many offerings lol
---
The game is amazing. I believe that if they are able to keep the game alive for 5 more years or more, they will be able to fix their spaghetti code, we will have less bugs, more interesting chapters and much more. 
---
J-HOOOOOOPPPPEEEE!
---
Incorrect, I'm the asshole in SWF that pops it, even though I know it's haunted ground so I can laugh at my friends' fear. That's worth going down in one hit. 
---
I love when they teabag me and I down them less than 5 seconds later
---
Surprised Quentin is above Nea. 99% of the Nea's I run into are toxic assholes, yet I rarely see anyone play Quentin.
---
Yeah when they tbag me and I smack them down I give them a vigorous head nod
---
I'm still not sure how that works out. My total game BP was just 2x my in-game earned points. My total BP overall was only about 1k more than that (what I had before the match started)
---
Yup! Some people are just better than me and I'm not mad about it! Same goes for when I play survivor. It's all good fun at the end of the day!
---
Are we going back to the DS stun instead of escape as well? Maybe its different on xbox but I encounter these addons so rarely that they've rarely been an issue.
---
What you say applies to Legion, because they have no skill floor or ceiling. But not everyone can play Nurse. If you think it's the character and not the people playing her, then you do it.
---
Stroke?
---
You get their meter to a low percentage and then wait till they bleed out. No jukes, no nothing, just use bloodhound and follow the blood while facing a different direction. No need for skill if you can just do this. 
---

Even better copy pasta. Thank you danph, very cool. 
---
Tell that to my after game chat. People seem to hate losing no matter who it is because this community is full of babyrage.
---
Did they moonwalk after frenzy hit? 
---
It‘s not the launcher. It‘s being forced into a voice chat with my discord settings. That just sucks. 
---
Why would you delete something just because it’s being downvoted?
---
I just got the DLC, and I am not new, but I am very much in the leveling stages on both sides right now. Just got David King to 30, and Meg to 21, otherwise everyone is 1-5 or less. Killers, have Hag and Myers at 10 otherwise everyone is 5 or under. I want to play legion as I genuinely enjoy facing him, but I am in low ranks and don't see a ton of great killers. What perks should I run and what am I meant to do to not be toxic? He looks like a blast, but I really don't want to ruin anyone's experience. 
---
Neas are the worst. Either playing like idiots or killing their team. I never play if there’s more than 1 in my lobby as survivor. 
---
Because besides huntress, no other killer has a mechanic skill ceiling.
---
I don't know what to tell you bro. Because the minute they nerf nurse is the minute she becomes useless. 
---
&gt; we will just power through gens knowing that there is nothing to fear
---
The killer. Who shouldn't be letting you power through gens in the first place.
---
Thanks dude
---
Hey thanks for not waking me up, I’ve been having a hard time sleeping, but what I mean is that you’re a nurse Main so yeah.
---
Montage worthy.
---
How about that Adam killing you to get his Deliverance?
---
What systems? Do you have any ideas or are you just complaining? Because to be real with you, I play a lot of Nurse. She's the only killer in the game that truly rewards time spent on her and actually makes you feel like a power role. 
---
I'm guessing when they finally rework her she'll end up being a useless pile of crap, so just wait. You'll get what you want before you know it. And I'll end up switching to Huntress.
---
Why can everyone make better animations then bhvr?
---
Most likely discord paid them for exclusivity starting out to boost their userbase
---
He’s basically a shittier Nurse. His power achieves the same purpose, which is disregarding pallets and windows, and generally nullifying chases. Nurse blink however doesn’t require you to hit them 4 times to down them, and is overall more versatile. He’s a Nurse for people who aren’t good enough to master Nurse. 
---
On console half the reason 360s are effective is because it causes lag. 
---
I mean. Exactly? You aren't supposed to main Jason.
---
Yes.
---
He needs a safe unhook for that
---
Yes. Typically, you'll want to burn through all your inventory, at least the good stuff, before prestige. That way you won't be wasting anything worthwhile and you can get some BP to speed up the process on the next go. 
---
mom said it’s my turn on aazarovs
---
It's just convenience. Competition sure, but rarely do platforms offer a cheaper price on games than others. If you look between games on origin and steam they're often the same price constantly unless one of them is running a sale.
---
I'm kind of the same way, if it's a game I'm DYING for I'll gladly use another launcher, IE a I use blizz launcher due to WoW and such, but if it's one I'm on the fence about or don't know much on, eh, no thanks
---
I just dont find enjoyment out of playing against him with nurse you can loop back or any of that but my experience has been if he hits you he just moonwalks after you until you go down which isnt fun.
---
what are you a detective?
---
NOED
---
People that use DS and then dc after missing it are just really fucking bad at the game and because their ego can‘t even handle losing one game they rather leave
---
Hope you are able to get some sleep. Sleep deprivation isn’t healthy at all. I’m not all that great at Nurse. Still trying to learn them mind games. One day though. You might hear a Nurse reeing from across the map....
---
I pretty much main legion and i have had maybe 3 or 4 dcs honestly it doesnt happen as much as people bitch and say they do (it might help i dont play him like a complete scumbag but eh)
---
I might steal this idea
---
**J U S T A L I T T L E B I T**
---
Bet Bubba wishes he had a muffin.
---
Legion’s pretty boring and his perks are meh. I’d get clown
---
That useless hook in the middle of the map the Killer didn't even know it existed? Gone, no need to thank me
---
-The Entity, clearly "favoring survivors"
---
It's not a community issue there are just too many swf groups/survivors and not enough killers.
---
Que as killer or Solo survivor and it'll be fast. More survivors in a que=longer to find a killer.
---
Clown is good. I find him fun but some people don't. He's one of my favs.
---
Legion feels garbage to use imo but I like him now because he ruins the game for others. Sucks for good survivors but hes really enjoyable to use against toxic swf. Even if you lose you can be happy knowing you ruined the game for them.
---
Agreed its population was dying well before the news that no new content was coming as well as the Devs going weeks without saying anything.
---
I mean our Devs dont say much either but they give us the illusion that every Thursday we are gonna get something... while I'm on about the Devs not saying shit: *clears throat* Hatch Nerf, DS nerf, Freddy rework, Bunny Feng WHEN!?!?!?!?
---
Darn it. I was saving all the food stuff. 
---
didn't moonwalk. looked down
---
Wait, if a person is bad at the game so what if they pip up then rank up. You don’t get any extras to being a higher rank you just get to say you’re red rank and harder opponents. Once they hit red rank and they switch killers using your logic they won’t be good and will have to de pip making it easier for survivors. You’re a BBB. Just uninstall the game. 
---
Well they said they're going to change the spawning in the next match by adding a line of sight check to survivors, so it should be a little better.
---
What happens then if you open both gates? 
---
If getting 5 gens was all it took to win the survivors wouldn’t have to wait to open the door and then also escape through it
---
it would help the survivors, but not the killer
---
Now I’m not saying people have to like it, but moonwalking does actually require some skill. I don’t do it, but it does impress me every so often
---
both ring the alarm but the sound isn't all over the map but much rather like the hatch
---
Oh yeah those hag traps get me every so often and it scares the shit outta me 😂
---
Right after the Nurse released I didn't feel like she was very good.
---
Then people learned how to play her.
---
i guess so but if they hear it's open they may know survivors are close 
---
Isnt it ravioliti or something like that? I think i have play with him 
---
Those pallets in particular are UNBELIEVABLY safe, maybe 2nd safest tile in the game behind shack pallet. Even if the killer moon walks, you can just stand at either corner and you can always see them before they can realistically swing (unless there's lag or something like that). 
---
((Exposed))
---
But you are likely to make mistakes if you are facing away. After you hit them back away until the chase breaks and then you can simply look down and follow them. So long as too much of them doesn't end up on your screen, you won't start a chase.
---
I find it amusing to play against NOED, because it's double satisfying when everyone escapes. If not, well, it's just surivor's fault because I see a lot of people walking past dull totems and it doesn't take that long.
---
DS is fine, if you are good (not speaking for myself, I suck), then you are able to get that survivor either way, or not? There are more serious problems than two perks, which are just part of the game. 
---
Not really, because of legion's 110% movement speed. Any decent survivor can easily exploit this slow walking speed to be able to easily loop him much longer than a regular 115% killer.
---
I wonder why they don’t have a deserters penalty in this game. Like if someone leaves they get a 5 minute ban that slowly increases every subsequent DC. 
---
Why not?
---
first stop trying to act like your vocabulary is above the rest its a waste of time and this is reddit 
---
second if your chase last for more than 30 seconds in bloodlust leave and go somewhere else you seem smart enough to realize its going to take some time
---
third it almost secures a safety pip because its a nice kick to get enough points to do so
---
fourth I trap my totems giving me the notification that someone is trying to do it also most of the time I dont run it.I dont use thana for the gen slow I do it for the healing slow to give them another thing to do otherwise they are stupid.
---
Last if you dont like looping take it to the devs dont blame survivors for using the only way of defend themselves add more ways looping will go
---
cause they are afraid of losing their Karma xD
---
Running the game directly from my Steam Library fixes this for me. It's not a fix for everyone though.
---
LOL me too man 
---
i'm speaking in general, not you specifically.
---
you can't really say people don't do that because they really do.
---
I always save my ds for htach/exit gates. I see people use it early out of spite.....fools. 
---
I mean in basketball that 10% hitting the rim can cost the whole shot 
---
You realise the People working on skins, arent the ones working on stuff like optimisatsion
---
Console base is still somewhat decent after it was given away for free a few months ago but I do notice a lot less people on the mic sadly which was the most fun part for me. I met a bunch of great people in that game.
---
yeah but i don't know. streamers are usually cocky and get killed quickly. me and my friends send eachother the links to the streamers we get in our lobbies though 
---
And this is why everybody wants him nerfed, or at least adjusted.
---
He hits you over obstacles and through windows with that chainsaw. It's BS
---
Recently played against a spirit with Haunted Grounds, Devour, Thrill and something else, could have been Ruin - found exactly one Totem all game before things went downhill - that one, of course.
---
No idea then, but you should definitely keep trying and see if you figure it out and not be one of those survivors that doesn't put any effort into stealth because it's freddy. 
---
I try to play stealthy even as Meg. It might be a bit easier as you level her up and get more stealthy perks but the survivors are really just skin (for the most part), so I say just play how you want to.
---
As for Hauted Grounds your best bet is to cleanse a hex totem when a teammate is being chased and they’re already injured. If you happen to cleanse the wrong hex and it’s Haunted Grounds, it won’t make a difference if they’re already chasing an injured survivor.
---
Again, I say play as you want to. I change my perks up on Meg all the time. There’s no rules on how you have to play a certain character. Choose the perks you like and don’t care about whether it’s meta or not. Choose the perks that works for you.
---
Please tell me they got gens done lol
---
When the game was in beta, I thought it was going to be killer sided.
---
This could be an interesting way of buffing Wake Up! if the need ever arises
---
Maybe I should start using it after I’ve got the pig unlocked on PC. My issues with hag with such fast games nowadays is that you have to be good enough to know where to place your traps rather than just sticking them down where you feel like it, and that at the start of the game you have to take the time to set up your ‘web’. Maybe an insta down would help! 
---
I have seen this meme atleast 6 times
---
Youd think they learned about the moonwalking strat after the pig release
---
yeah true that could make it really useful and gives variety to perks
---
killer mains be like "he wasn't campin he was patrollin wtf"
---
ggs
---
They did!
---
What? Even perks? Like from the beginning?
---
Nah, I don't try anymore. Besides, most of the time my teammates are so pathetic at chases they go down within 10-15 seconds every time, so it's better if I take the aggro, so they can potentially do gens(though apparently even without ruin i'm the only one who does gens). I'm not incredible at looping, but i'm at least competent.
---
Maybe they could simply add a couple more perks for survivors that could just counter facecamp. I know there's already one that reveals the killers aura when they are real close to a hooked survivor (can't remember what it's called). Maybe another could the sacrifice process to take longer while the killer is within x meters, or increase generator repair of other allies while killer is within x meters. Maybe even one that increases your luck while tge killer is close by. Not that these perks would be better than others/prioritized like urban evasion, decisive strike, and self care etc. But it would be something 
---
Yes you would go back to have just the 3 basic character perks
---
Legion literally cannot be juked lol? Any random person can pick up the game, press button and they will automatically get hits. Lol okay. that's not an exaggeration at all. And I swear it's like people are missing the point here. I get it Legion is easy, and that's bad ostensibly to a number of people who would other wise be interested in playing him. But his Lack of "Fun" on the killer side due to ease of play is up to each killer to decide. If a Killer has no fun playing him then they simply don't have to play him. But from the  Survivor "fun factor" point of reference Legion's skill floor has no bearing on his funness to play against beyond the potential of there being more of him around. THe idea put forward by the DBD community is "Legion ignores X parts of the game, X is the fun part  so he is unfun to play against." But the same complaint ISN'T made against other killers that do the same thing. I think that's strange. On top of that why is it that X Part is the only fun part. Why isn't stealth a fun counter to Legion? Why is the chase the only fun part? That a far bigger issue in the game design to be discussed than harping on the Legion not being fun.
---
I don’t understand what’s happening here.
---
*¡¡¡BUT MY HOPE WILL NEVER DIE!!!*
---
When they release Jason Voorhees as a killer
---
Allegedly spring 2019. Don't hold your breath.
---
You mean start walking backwards or stop moving completely? 
---
It doesn’t say it doesn’t stack though. I mean, I’m getting their tapes mixed up I know but Cold Dirt plus any of the ladies mix tapes should be functional. I’m gonna play test that this evening to see if there is any difference. 
---
How would that work  
---
1.) Run in at full HP (so you cant even Dead Hard)  
---
2.) Get hit by instadown  
---
3.) ???  
---
4.) BT save
---
James and Aleks?
---
Cool thanks. I always miss my lunge because of the 360s and it’s super frustrating.
---
Ruin, Play with your Food does not lose token while installing killing. Find your obsession and get that 15% movement speed. 
---
yup. and be careful. had Balanced Landing 3 on my Nea, prestiged, now I'm at nearly level 50 again and only Balanced Landing tier 1... wish there was an option to at least upgrade unique perks *but*....
---
He stole Freddy's journal!
---
I got it by using Tombstone with an add-on that increased the evil you get from stalking so it wouldn't take as long. I had to tier up to EW3 3 times to get all four survivors. I got the 2nd and 3rd survivor quite fast after one another. 
---
Tuft of hair combined with Tombstone takes a lot of evil for you to get to EW3 since you'll have to drain 3 survivors completely. Imo it's better to ditch tuft of hair for an add-on that increases evil you get, and just re-stalk when you see a survivor when not in EW3. Only problem you might have is the last survivor escaping through the hatch and people jumping in lockers/starting to work on gens when you are in EW3, since you can't kill those, only grab them.
---
Ever since I saw this movie the other day, I can enjoy these memes a lot more. Lol the reality line is always the funniest to me 
---
I’m pretty sure nearly everyone agrees with this...
---
Yeah honestly it wouldn't be a problem if auto aim didn't exist. Juking abuses the auto aim so walking backwards stops auto aim from swinging where they "were". Honestly auto aim should go.
---
Thanks!
---
Slow the game down just a little bit
---
most of them won't have enough time to get there, the survivors have lots of perks to help them sprint burst to the doors when they are opened. 
---
It really doesn’t unless of course you consider tracking a skillful thing. 
---
I wish there was a killer offering to make all survivors spawn together lol. I'm nervous because if EW3 isn't infinite there is so much room to fuck up if I waste my EW3 but obviously I need to try something else out bc this isn't working. Is there a map you recommend going to? 
---
True
---
Yes. You will have access to the survivor's base perks.
---
In return of prestiging you will get a piece of bloodied cosmetic and bloodwebs from now on have a slight chance of including higher rarity items.
---
Doing it while walking backwards is what I’m referring to. I guess the slash marks do help out though
---
This is the reason I always die to NOED. My teammate can never bother to get them.
---
Looking at last year I believe the event was announced one day before the CNY ¯\_(ツ)_//¯ 
---
I have every single killer perk so I have yet to get ruin on old boye yet. I need it to complete this achievement but a girl ain't made of bloodpoints
---
Like it's literally a screenshot of a room from DBD as if it's something important
---
It's a nice wake up call for new players to git gud lol
---
You’re not alone on that one
---
There’s like 2-3 comments that are acting anything even close to this out of 33. Are you sure about that?
---
It took me playing two or three of those games a day for a week straight before I finally got it. I of course recommend BBQ and chili.  A map offering for something like red forest or haddonfield or Lerrys that provides good stalky walls to hide behind. And maybe a hex totem as bait. Like I ran ruin and just hung around it and they all came to me. Gave me plenty of time to stalk them up. PWYF wouldn’t be horrible but I never find that i get it stacked up. I used overcharge, pop goes the weasel, ruin, and BBQ. I played a three gen strategy after my ruin got destroyed and ended up getting the last one out of pure luck. 
---
Good luck in the fog my friend 
---
Why can't I change perks/update bloodweb while searching for games? 
---
Also, why can't I stay in a party with my friends instead of having to invite them every time? 
---
i sometimes just close the application and play something else, the wait times for survivors are crazy, i thought maybe people are slowly stopping playing this game. the fact that as soon as someone gets hit to the ground they immediately disconnect is also very infuriating 
---
Pretty petty imo but if that’s how you wanna play then go for it.
---
Because of crappy code. It's a very basic function (the latter) that they're most likely not able to implement because of the way they worked w/ P2P connection.
---
Ya if anything these shit survivors will intentionally de-rank so they can go back to t bagging new killers and just really ruining gameplay for all possible players, veteran and new. One day bhvr may actually do something about dc'ing
---
PORNHUB/PORNSTAR/PIPER-PERRI

Sigh, please if you want to point out why NoED is broken then fine. Just don't say 'u just dribble with ds or use enduring' stuff. Both perks are not that balanced and let's just end it at there instead of starting whole 'why noed is more broken then ds, ds is more OP then noed' cycle again.
---
It’s the create a lobby and rank that’s glitched. U also can’t go back in any menus without restarting the game if u have that glitch 
---
I like how people keep bringing up Enduring as a "counter" to DS. Well it's not, Enduring doesn't prevent the survivor from getting off my shoulder. 
---
Ignoring the gameplay itself (you should have done a gen and left) if he was messaging you with slurs and whatnot you can report him and see if anything comes of it.
---
*sigh*
---
when do we think the moonrise event will go live?
---
Yeah. Once the new update hits you could use something like spine chill prove thyself bond and some other perk. Leader maybe? Or streetwise if you have a toolbox. Thats a classic gen jockey build.
---
Do I qualify as well?

That’s the spirit. Deal with asshole abt being an asshole yourself, very adult like.
---
But you need to be in a chase AND there needs to be a window near by to use it. That's too many requirements I rather just Sprint at free will by holding it at 99%. 
---
I mean it needed stealth. But if you got save you also had bt.
---
The I want to die build.

I KNOW you bm going by this post lmao

Just use a build to slow down the game and put the map you want.

i usually put one mask on early game to make the game slow down and player getting mad to their teammates for activating the traps, its a delight to watch.

yo if you run with a pizza on your back isn't that shit gunna get trashed?
---
You're telling me Fog Whisperers at rank 1 that frequently get 120-150+ ms lobbies as Survivor, especially late at night, are all using a bandwidth bottleneck program or VPNs in order to make themselves laggier? Really? You realize the laggier you are the harder it is for you to play Survivor right? It isn't the other way around. You move about 1 foot every 5 seconds, get stuck on random objects and take way too long to vault windows/throw down pallets. I've never in my time playing DBD had a struggle catching laggy survivors. It's way easier to catch them than players with good connections to me.
---
BT is so good against tunnelers yes. Love this perk
---
F13=Killer sided and crappy game
---
DBD=Survivor Sided(?) and...okay?
---
LYTN=New, Balanced(?) Fun(?)
---
Lots of people disagree methinks
---
Sloppy is alright but it's not *good.* There are certainly better perks and the build that the big brain OP posted I'd swap Thana out for Ruin and Sloppy out for Discordance, M&amp;A, BBQ, Stidor, Remember Me, Bamboozle, or even Third Seal if you have it. Nurse's or Franklin's if you're feeling particularly big brain.
---
Well, that works too but y'know saving 5 traps until the end of the game is my deal. Especially since, that way, I can potentially RBT everyone at once. If it gets to that point... Neptune have mercy on your soul lol
---
My bad if this is considered shaming, I'll remove it if so. For the record I checked and over 200 people have this name and I genuinely can't remember which one it is.
---
She’s probably not pleased she got dragged into killing for a spider god for all eternity.
---
Legion is very fun to play. I just love running around map and going full stabby stabby stab on people.
---
Legion’s fun to play, even though I suck at it. It’s just a fun experience to chase people all over at super-speed. Even if one or two get out, I’ve still my points at the end of the day.
---
It only works when you dodge the hit but there's also a pallet or window very soon after. I do love seeing scared survivors just Dead Hard nothing at all with no possible escape after. Same with Decisive when they don't have a plan after
---
you lose all your items, addons, perks and offerings, but get a better chance of better items, which is only really noticeable at P3...
---
There is just a higher frequency of them. 
---
You don't need to dodge a hit to gain distance with Dead Hard, albeit it'll only be a tiny bit, which means you can sometimes make a pallet you wouldn't otherwise by just tapping Dead Hard regardless if they swing or not.
---
I didn't think I would like clown but I got him and loved him. He doesn't feel cheap and it's rewarding to land a good bottle. He's a good pick since he can end chases with well placed gas with a learning curve that isn't too steep but still hard to master (bottles always go further than you think).
---
Legion in the other hand I thought I'd like but don't. His base power is weak but becomes stupid strong with add-ons. You rarely get the "stab everyone" moments (unless survivors are huddled) but even then they feel unsatisfying since it doesn't impact the game much. 
---
Lucky for you. I rage hard. The fact that you will get banned if you swear at assholes who farm you in this game makes it even harder for me. But I guess, it's a way for me to learn to control emotions

---
As a survivor and killer main, the hatch is a poorly implemented mess of a good idea. The idea itself is needed, or it would be impossible for a survivor to escape with three gens left. It's just not very well done. It either ends in someone leaving their teammates to die so they can get it, or both sides sitting in one place for an hour.
---
They won't ban people for using the most optimal strategy(tunneling). They may nerf it but there is no way people will get banned for doing this.

---
DBD is not survivor sided or killer sided. It is pretty balanced right now.
---
It also suffers from a number of ass backwards design decisions. The game plays like it was playtested by a long time DnD group of best friends in that it only works when all 6 players are super nice to each other instead of looking for mechanics to abuse to grind the killer into dust.

Should have had Joey and Julie working on the gen lol
---
So when multiple survivors use a salty lips offering they all conflict with each other? They are supposed to stack 
---
Pretty sure I played against blinx yesterday, is he a streamer? I remember him specifically because I am rank 13 killer and the dude looped me for days, definitely deranking if it was him
---
I can agree with that unless your playing with friends against a random killer team work sucks and don't get me started on the campy killers who focus and stare at one person on the hook till there dead 
---
Not only that but they are completely different lol
---
So when someone gets unhooked I should always go for the person who unhooked to avoid tunneling?
---
I can always tell when I’ve been chasing someone too long but I always justify it by saying the time it might take to find another survivor might be longer than the time it would take to catch up to the one I found and I know where this one is. 
---
Please note though that the character’s teachable stay unlocked forever. So for example, you leveled Claudette to get her self care teachable. You then found self care in Meg’s blood web. You prestige Claudette. Meg will still have self care. You do not need to unlock Claudette’s teachables again every time you prestige. 
---
I just wanted to reiterate this for you because I was confused about it when I first prestiged. And people didn’t really understand what I was asking when I was looking for clarification on it. 
---
If you choose to prestige, just try to use the items and offerings you really love before you pull the trigger. As far as collecting cool stuff, you can always rebuild your collection when you get the character to their final form (whether that’s prestige 3 for you or whether you choose to stop at p1 or p2.) Even event items like winter party starters will most likely return next year, so you can collect them again. 
---
DBD is only survivor sided when you add comms and team builds.
---
LYTN is survivor sided because of like a dozen reasons that players figured out by the end of the week of release. One of the dumbest things is that one shot kill weapons can be built faster than the killer's respawn timer. 
---
Oh. Goes to show how much I play Spirit. 
---
I find it great on Hag because you smack them and trap their item. On Freddy specifically, it’s situational. It’s not a bad perk, just situational like Blood Warden or Pop goes The Weasel. 
---
Lol same. This game has brought out the zen in me. I haven't raged at anything in game in such a long time now. 
---
I thought all totems were hex totems, like if I broke a dull totem it would disable one of the killers perks 
---
and it'll probably run through february 5th, yeah?
---
How does premonition Trump stealth perks, does that only apply to Insidious? To be honest I read it at first and thought, "Maybe Wraith will be invisible and have a terror radius because of this perk" but it turned out all it did was tell me where the killer is when I'm facing that direction
---
(Heartbeat going absolutely crazy, but no killer in sight)

Dwight:  Where are you?!

My headcannon is that if they was in a sequel to a  movie them returning would be in a new costume
---
I could be wrong, or maybe they also do that when it stacks above the cap.
---
Easy:
---
1. Rage significantly increases movement speed and then there's suddenly a movement speed bonus AFTER Rage? Broke. 
---
2. During this meth-like sprint you also have no attack cool down. Sprint stab, keep sprinting, stab downed. And even if you miss and rage ends, random movespeed bonus to Really finish that "chase".

Just saying you would be surprised what people will do to win. And with some I have hit them and then they TP in front 6 feet and have no damage took even after hearing them grunt. There are many videos on this. And survivors and killers who do this can use it to their advantage 
---
Is that for consoles or just PC?
---
Depends on killer add ons and the map tbf

Yes DbD is P2P (For now), but that still doesn't mean people ON YOUR REGION won't lag when they connect to you. Your 1 Gig Fiber's Upload and Download speeds doesn't help that fact, the ping does and even then that doesn't help when connecting to other players in DbD. My ping with the internet I use is always around 3-5 when I do a Speedtest on the closest server to me, but in DbD on both sides, killer and survivor there is lag, as killer survivors usually have yellow bar ping in lobby and occasional green bar, and occasional red bar, and as survivor I get mostly green bar, but I still get yellow bars and red bars too, from killers that are on my region, that could for all I know be my next-door neighbor. I'll quote someone from earlier in the thread who tried to get the point through your seemingly thick skull, but to no avail as it would seem.
---
&gt; Then you should know that ping is entirely dependent on the distance between the host node and the client node, or between node 1 and node 2.
---
That point alone you seemingly chose to ignore despite it being reasonable and an accurate reason as to why people lag in your games, like you seem to ignore every solution or argument against your ridiculous points that makes sense. (E.G your entire thread here, and your entire "Why Does DS not have a counter" Thread, which ironically in that thread, satire or not I found one comment from you that simply says)
---
&gt; Pulling the Ethernet cord out of the computer could be a counter.
---
Also yeah you really are egotistical and arrogant for that matter, you want to blame this issue on anything or anyone that ISN'T you or your internet, because "your gig connection" so it must always be the survivors fault when they lag in some way. And yes, CSGO pros, or pros in other games have cheated before with however many hours, but those times were in tournaments where real money was on the line, they got punished accordingly and never played again (In tourneys at least) Making that comparison makes no sense, because the difference is way too big between the two, (CSGO Pro cheating ≠ DbD Vet "cheating") Cause I can guarantee that you weren't anything special in that game where someone would be inclined to cheat against you and risk a game ban after playing that long over a regular game with no real reward from it.
---
I'm done with this argument cause I know it's futile at this point to try and get it through your head that you can be wrong on some things sometimes and that pretty much this entire thread has been a giant mess of egotism and overexaggeration on your part.
---
I hate Haddonfield as Huntress. Yeah it's got some nice corridors for hatchet throws and all but I don't like walking around its long ass fences and hedges. Plus the siren lights tank my FPS
---
Is he German? He speaks English really fluently
---
Sometimes I forget the siren lights exist and they scare the shit out of me when I cross the map.
---
It simply means it will always go off, even if the killer is invisible (like the Wraith) for example.
---
I do, however, think it does **not** counter Myers Evil Within I.
---
Why is third seal good on legion?
---
damn
---
I know that the killer is tunneling when I save someone from the hook, and I’m trying to take a hit for the other survivor to get away, but the killer ignores me and only goes after the other survivor who is injured. That’s what I see as “tunneling.”
---
Yeah this is from an animated short based off that slender man game isn’t it?
---
Isn't that his other job, the messenger thing? I mean, nobody would ever transport a pizza like that, I hope...

If it’s Ps4, crouch and press O. For the longest time, I didn’t even know it was possible. Maybe I should’ve just looked at the screen where it shows what the buttons do!
---
I suck at flashlights and don’t know 3, so I’ll leave that for someone else.
---
The addons are what i absolutely agree with and it's been long overdue, like the Freddy buff and the recent Piggy buff.
---
it is so bad, that i play as the killer to make the daily BP and stop playing, just because i ain't gonna wait for an hour to see someone else just disconnect. 
---
You go down in one hit. Explained.
---
Redneck with chainsaw dominates teens
---
Changing the speed while charge speed to is really REALLY stupid, what is the counterplay to that? Try to move around like a spastic and hope the killer gets motion sickness trying to follow you and misses? Any killer with built in insta down needs punishments for using the ability poorly, Hillbilly barely has one with him being unable to interact with anything after his misses and his saw is on cooldown but at least he has it, taking the speed penalty away from Leatherface, who is arguably easier to get a hit in if you have experience and don't use it near obstacles like a dumb-dumb, is the shitiest approach to a rework. The addons do need a heavy rework and the ones listed are pretty good.
---
PS4 is unplayable atm for me, completely, the amount of bugs plus waiting times it's just horrible. it makes me regret ever buying this game. 
---
Take this from a guy who has participated in 7 DBD tournaments. (5 of them being fairly major ones)
---
Space Esports is being very nice in the fact that they are giving players an opportunity to win some cash and perhaps some fame as well. The thing is that they decided to make it long and arduous, which means that if they were able to schedule it to be truly fair, 12 weekends of staff time would be taken. To remedy this, why not consider condensing it to 6 tournaments, or even one big one? I can see that blowing such money in a small time frame might not be good in terms of the company, but what it looks like now is that this is a way to claim a large prize pool but distribute it out so that only 200$ a week would be used. Sure, in the end the total given out will reach 2.5k, but with each tourney lasting 4-5 hours, you're asking 54 hours for a maximum potential with the lowest amount of teammates allowed of 450. That equates to 8.33$ (repeating). But what if you lose? Well, it only goes less.
---
As for the entry fee, I don't believe it is a point that should be celebrated, but rather expected. Sure, it's good that they didn't make us pay to participate, but why should we celebrate them not doing something? It's a logical choice that I'm sure the staff decided against due to the outlast that would've occurred. To my knowledge, not one large DBD tournament was pay-to-participate.
---
Overall, I think it is disingenuous, but that's just me. The timing tells me that they wanted an event that would span a long time without breaking the bank, and that's what was delivered. I do believe if they condensed the event, it would've been better for everyone involved as better scheduling would be an option. Finally, I don't believe we should celebrate a company not doing something unfavorable. What you are saying is akin to praising EA for making a game without micro-transactions. But these are just my thoughts.
---
I hope they change it to give more bp for distracting the killer while gens are being completed! There’s really nothing you can do in this situation and for so little reward 
---
Just change your controls then.

---
Another one of these posts lol
---
I play tested when he initially came out and unless they shadow patched it and hoped no one would notice, nothing stacked at all. That being said, because of that I haven’t tried stacking anything in a long time because the last time I did it was a waste, and I don’t play much legion anymore because... well, it’s legion, so if it has been changed lmk
---
When camping fails 😂
---
When the Legion finds you, gets pallet-stunned three straight times in your first chase, then disconnects.
---
Don’t use the pig crouch in a chase. Use it to sneak up on gens or people trying to save their teammates. Also get Dwight to 40 if he is close. 
---
I’m sure you’ll get more chuckle worthy responses after, I did! They repeated the “K” a couple times and continued even more with their hate. And then I posted a screenshot of the trophy I got from their kills. 
---
Lol it’s okay man... I would go around with Jake doing nothing but sabotaging hooks. I didn’t know they came back!
---
This is excactly why i would hate to make it part of his kit, even though i love this addon (to the point of hating to even go back to base Freddy with any other addon in it's place) i do see how it would break Freddy, if you know what to do it's rather easy to 4k but you do need effort and planning, yeah alot of killers hate to do that and prefer basic m1 action but making it easier for them to track survivors every game will force them to actually put effort in the killer eventually, making even the worse Freddy players having a shot at 3k or higher while good players will be actually close to unbeatable except for maybe playing against survivors on the skill level of Marth's squad.
---
Use flashlights when killers are mud animation and aim at the head. For example when a killer is picking someone up, the second the stand fully straight point it in their eyes and they will drop them. Also use the flashlight when killers break pallets or vault windows. 
---
Why bot sent an email to the support team about it instead of expecting the Devs to check Reddit?
---
*shrug*
---
I normally punish the one that goes for the unhook in my range. I think it's less toxic that way since the hooked survivor can't do anything to stop it and it's really frustrating when you play survivor and someone unhooks you at a bad time. 
---
Now you are defining a gimmick as a killer's entire ability

---
Also have the same issue. But someone taught me a trick. If you’re in a lobby with SWF and you’ve noticed you’ve been waiting awhile. Unready, then do invite friends and if you get an error message saying something like you’re unable to invite because of some type an error, that lobby is broken. So my friends and I noticed we’ve been sitting there for 20 mins, check the lobby, it’s broken, and we make a new one and get a match sometimes within 5 mins. 
---
This isn’t the case all the time. Wait times are pretty bad even if the lobby isn’t broken. 
---
Claudette? Check.
---
DS? Check.

Salty DC? Check.

"Close Quarters Billy" is fine, it's just that the devs have kept him undertuned since release, so we've never had a chance to see his power shine.

Survivors gain madness by being in your terror radius, and being shocked. 
---
Perks : Distressing, Ruin, unnerving presence, bbqandchili/nurses calling
---
Very nice 
---
There really is no "best" way for things like that I'm afraid.
---
I would suggest leveling up Meg and Claudette a bit (like until you have 3 perk slots or so) and playing with them and their perks for a while to see if it fits your playstyle. That way you don't spend too much bloodpoints on them in case you don't like their perks.
---
If you do, however, like the perks just level them up until you get the teachables and unlock them on your Dwight.
---
Have have checked Reddit in the past. Maybe share this with them on another platform than?
---
That made me laugh quite a bit 
---
you wouldn't see it from a far 
---
relateable 
---
The others I get but Freddy? Is this some type of reverse parallel  timeline?
---
I have 3 killers and one survivor at level 50, but I'm not sure whether to prestige them or pump bloodpoints into the level 50 web to get good perks and add-ons stockpiled. What should i do?
---
No problem, those posts are super annoying.
---
Can anyone explain, please, what does mean "Loop"? within the game, of course. I play survivor, but I would like to play as a killer, however, I need to understand some terms everyone uses when play DBD. Also, my main perks are Sprint Burst and Self Care, as for the other two, sometimes I use empathy and Borrowed Time, or Urban Evasion but I'm not sure if those are good perks, heheh.
---
I'm glad you're happy! Kate was my favorite part of this drawing. Also Frank's mask, weirdly!
---
Aww, thanks! I appreciate that. :3 +5 thanks!
---
If they're at the center of the map or near a bunch of gens, let them throw pallets. Their teammates will want those later. If they are running to an area far away from everything break it off. They won't be doing anything useful for a bit and you can easily find someone else being productive to interrupt. You don't have to commit to every chase. 
---
Excuse you we do not camp sir the reverse bear traps make it so we don't have to. I believe you are referring to LF mains
---
Because there's a plethora of better words to use, and when was the last time you or anyone else used the word "exposed" to mean vulnerable and unprotected?
---
 And since it has a few variant definitions, how are we supposed to know exactly what it means? Op just described one, and you have another, how the he'll are we supposed to guess the right one?. How about they use a word that has fewer or a single defintion to make it more clear? Genius, I know.
---
Maybe its special kind of color blindness. Special eyes.
---
your title has lured me into the genius new way to play trapper.
---
For me its always the Wraith &amp; Leatherface that are the most toxic

I would never say it explains exactly what it does. I have yet to come across one person that correctly knew what that status meant when it first came up. Sure, it makes sense to us players that have spent plenty of time with the game but new people have no clue. I remember when I first saw the status pop up, I thought the killer could see my aura. I was even more confused when I went down in one hit. 
---
As for the tutorial, that really is a crappy way to explain game mechanics. Sure, it’s technically THERE but what new person is really gonna open the game manual, flip to the second page to find that info? They may eventually but not off the bat, especially since the tutorials only passingly mention them like they aren’t a huge deal.
---
I’m not saying we should demand a change to the term . That should be one of the lowest priorities at the moment. I’m just saying I would be open to something that better conveyed the general gist of what was happening. 
---
Most people can’t play her properly so they try to secure kills by camping. 
---
That’s the thing. YOU only have so many mori’s. While we’re sitting here dealing with pink moris all day. For an “ultra rare” offering, it comes up wayyyyy too often in matches, and it completely ruins the match for survivors. We don’t want to deal with it. Been in too many games where the killer’s only goal is to get juuuuuust far enough away from the recently hooked survivor to not appear to be camping, just to tunnel them off the hook and get moris. Who wants to be in a game where your number of hooks before death is reduced by 2/3 for every single player? 
---
Meanwhile, survivors have ZERO pink offerings that break the game to that extent. Imagine if you will, survivors having a pink offering called “auto-repair”, and for each offering given, it reduced the number of gens survivors have to power up by 1. Would you want to play a game where the 4 survivors have to only repair 1-4 gens before escaping? No. Because that’s would be ridiculous. But it’s essentially the same. You get way less chances to win a game because of a ridiculously over powered perk. So why play that’s match? 
---

y'know where the tutorials are there's a list of status effects and what they do.

---
Dropout's mask IS the best Legion mask. I don't make the rules.
---
If you are in treatment and they are in your terror radious it will increase madness, every time they scream and you see a blip they have gone up a teir. That is why you will see a lot of doctors run massive terror radius builds.
---
I don’t even know what kills I am missing. I feel like I’ve done most of them,  but hell if I’ll actually try and find out.
---
As I play more Survivor, I've started to notice this too.
---
Like, sure her power is good for camping (since you can use the hatchets to deliver two successive hits quickly, canceling out Borrowed Time, or downing the Saviour before they can unhook), but she's SO MUCH more than just a Leatherface 2.0! Stop trying to make her into a Bubba you guys!
---
*cries in Anna main*
---
Wow. This might be my favorite suggestion so far. 
---
Why save the best for last though?
---
Lmao. Woohoo, a Twitter @. 
---
Dude, email support and stop bitching. 
---
Adrenaline and DS should be default on all survivors.Your move. 
---
Natürlich
---
People if you hate DS, run rancor, you wont ever have to be DS'd by an obsession again. Heck I run it for the lulz of walking away from my obsession at the end of the chase. It provides you as the killer some needed time by getting at least one person off the gen to go get the person up.
---
Plus if they survive long enough, free mori, no hook needed, I call that satisfaction.
---
You're cranky because youre camped arent you. 
---
Dribbling only works if you're close to a hook and the thing about DS is that it is always good without regard to time, noed is playing the game without a perk until the very end of the match and a good killer counters noed just by being good but a survivor regardless of how good they are can always make use of DS. Noed is rough yea but has a 100% way to beat it clearing totems or just the killer never getting to use it but DS is strong constantly, from first pick up to last pick up it just needs a nerf.
---
I never used nurses calling on doc. Still don't have it and they made it so snapping out of it no longer reveals you to nurses calling. (And might not be affected by Sloppy Butcher) 
---
You slowly increase madness when in the doctor's terror radius/heartbeat when he's in treatment mode depending on how close you are to him. Because of this doctor becomes very niche in terms of builds. Many perks people thought might suck because they rely on terror radius (Coulrophobia, Unnerving, Distressing, Overwhelming, etc.) suddenly become great with doc.
---
I run a typical 3-gen build. Doctor is almost OP in terms of 3-genning because he is the king at stalling a game, slowing progress, and making it EXTREMELY hard for survivors to really get anything done. He also mines salt like crazy.
---
Distressing for more points and larger terror radius, which you want as doc. 
---
Unnerving for harder QTE's within your larger terror radius. 
---
Overcharge so they get a harder QTE (AND it stacks with unnerving and becomes close to Decisive Strike) and more progress lost if they fuck up once you kick a generator. Combined with madness placing the skill check randomly on the screen it's hard to hit. 
---
Last perk is your choice. I use BBQ and Chili to help find survivors and get even more bloodpoints, but some run Ruin (Don't have it yet) to slow the game down even more or huntress lullaby (don't have it either) for even more frustrating skillchecks but I don't really like Hex Perks because they can get cleansed early.
---
For addons the purple and yellow calm addons stack for a larger terror radius. 
---
Iridescent King and the green electrode are good too, but you have to zap people like crazy to make sure all afflictions stack. (Although to be fair as doctor I'm already zapping like crazy anyway. I try to get everyone in madness 3 as fast as possible. If I'm in a chase I'll shock them to madness 3 before downing them.) 
---
Jigsaw Piece offering so you get The Game, a very cramped map and since doctor's terror radius goes through the floor everyone will be miserible dealing with skillchecks.
---
Another fun build to run is railgun doc. Monitor and Abuse without disressing, (You want a small terror radius for maximum fun) BBQ and chili, and whatever perks you want for the last 2.
---
Then run interview tape and green electrode, and you can zap people from stupidly far ranges, outside heartbeat range enabling you to scare the living shit out of survivors. Just aim for the generator auras. Hell you could run something like surveillance or discordance to see which gens are being worked on and zap them that way too. After a hook, you can usually hit the survivor auras with your long range zap.
---
For some reason it’s always the Huntress! Like don’t get me wrong I’ve had my fair sure of toxic killers (and survivors) but it always seems to be the Huntress that’s the most toxic
---
Yes! With the lockers if they’re in the shack I’ll check the other lockers except for theirs and then leave. I know playing this way I’m probably going to have a hard time ranking up, but I can’t help it. It’s more important to me that newer players have a fun game I guess.
---
This x1000. It's amazing how survivor attitudes change when I play Billy vs Freddy. Nodding at a teabagger on death hook as Freddy can be just as satisfying as a cross map chainsaw snipe. 
---
Dude, STFU and go bother someone else. You clearly only cake her to argue.
---
Nurse on console is a horrible time and skill checks are harder to hit due to the horrible frame rate

---
I don't even bother with Ruin anymore. Waste of a perk slot at this point. Off the top of my head, I think it has been cleansed in the first minute of every game for the last 2 weeks for me. Stopped using it entirely a few days ago. It's a really stupid catch 22: it's almost necessary at purple to red ranks, but purple to red rank players will typically cleanse it super early. 
---
RavioliTime is my jam, what a gamer
---
this, the cablemodem signal at my home is so weak that if its hot day (most of the time here) when multiple people turns their tv in the neighbor my connection crashes because the signal goes out of range and the worst part is i cant do anything about it, i got the coaxial cable replaced from the street to my home with a wire just for the cablemodem and it still so near of going out of range that anything that put a load on the main wire crash the internet for all the users in the neighbor, we complained but monopoly is a fight you cant win

So are you saying a dog could play the game better than that Doctor?

---
Yes
---
It's not that hard to hit a survivor, even if they're doing 360s
---
Sounds like you just need more practice 
---
Its harder to play killer on console, and by extension its easier to play survivor on console 
---
I believe purposefully crashing a persons game because of macro flashlight is bannable. Do you have recorded evidence? Fill out a support form along w their details.
---
I see. Thank you! I was curious, because I've seen videos where the survivor manages to avoid the killer several times without being hit running throught all the stage, and I was like "Wow, I do not know what perk allows you to do that, but I want to learn now" xD
---
Much appreciated, dude!
---
Invisible killer lol, God. Weirdly I haven’t had these issues as killer though. 
---
i did, but on their steam account it said “macros=no ban”
---
3-Gens always bring a smile to mmy face. 
---
one thing i could suggest is always have 2k shards in case self care or adrenalina appears at the shrine so you can get them without lvling up claudette or meg just for those perks
---
We can agree F13 is a bit trash though right?
---
Lucky on that hatch spawn. Just started playing the game a couple weeks ago, so this stuff is still pretty new to me. Avoid “AFK” killers, good to know.
---
I believe they are lying.
---
The dying light change would make the best move for an obsession with the perk (they would know thanks to the altruism buff) is to suicide on hook to prevent stacks. Not fun for anyone. 
---
To be fair, there isn't a whole lot survivors can do to survive, besides doing gens and being good at running the killer around. 
---
Body blocking is also a way to play and even gives points when they get hit while the killer is carrying someone. If it is really a big problem when you play killer, you can counter body blocking by equipping the Legion's 'Mad Grit' perk. Also, hitting a bodyblocking survivor gives you an easy down as soon as you hook the survivor that you are carrying. 
---
Teabagging literally doesn't give any advantage in the game and is just a dick move. 
---
If you were that close to an unhooked survivor you were either:
---
-(proxy) camping/surveilling the hook area. Legit strat, but boring imo, doesn't give a lot of bp either.
---
-running after a survivor hook diving. Makes the unhooker a dick since the unhooked survivor has literally no say in this. Do all you want, but I prefer to punish the dick survivor as opposed to the unhooked one who has nowhere to go but back on the hook.
---
Also, staying close enough to the hook to tunnel makes you lose map pressure, giving the survivors you are not chasing an easy time doing gens since they have very little to lose since they'll have two more hooks to go before death, which makes them take more risks. 
---
The unhooker can go right back to doing gens since the killer won't chase them, the injured survivor will go down again soon and before you get to the 3rd survivor the gates will be open. 
---
So consider this: let the unhooked survivor go, go after the unhooker (if you are close you might be able to hit them during unhook), down the unhooker. During that chase, only two people might be doing gens, the unhooked survivor probably spent time healing themself and one or both of the gen jockeys might be going in for the save of your fresh hook.
---
Switching your target a lot applies more map pressure and keeps the survivors on edge. When it becomes apparent that a killer is actively tunneling, I'll actively try to pump out gens asap to not give the killer the satisfaction of getting kills.
---
Trees can do that on every map, I’ve had it happen to me on Macmillan and Springwood, possibly Coldwind as well but I’m not certain 
---
True. My curiosity got the best of me 
---
Or... people could just do the tutorial. No need to rename something that’s had the exact same name since release. 
---
It's an old thing, and not worth remembering.
---
No idea.
---
thought so, but wanted to be sure. also told me to “kill myself” and call me MANY racial slurs.
---
you already have Legion 
---
Thanks for the quick reply. Oh, I did not know Borrowed Time is bugged, so it does not work as intended?
---
tfw you left your legion at level 45 and use susie cosmetics when you do go to play them. feelsbadman.
---
Legion so weak even survivors can kill him 
---
Yeah, you can definitely mess around with them for a bit in the early game, but as soon as the gates are open and people start leaving: gtfo
---
Because Quitters deserve more of a punishment for ruining the game for the other players. As a killer AND a survivor its less fun when one side is down a player. Killers also need a punishment for quitting the game early (with some provisions to prevent abuse).
---
Add me on disc and ill tell u my disc- unzk1ll3d#1591
---
&gt;The resources are already in the game.
---
I already explained how that isn't a solution, but ok, continue ignoring my comment.
---
Its one of the MANY things that this game can easily fix and make it much easier on new players to get a hang of the game. There is so much counter intuitive bs in this game its astonishing, really. Playerbase just ignores it because everyone is used to it.
---
Can you really get enough evil to go around to hit EW3 4 times? Annoyingly if you Mori a survivor, any evil left over is "Wasted" and not redistributed to other survivors so you have to be super complicated with who you stalk, how much, and who you mori.

Actually on the topic of her outfit, the new Nea biker jacket helps the pig out quite a bit. I had a game where my friend and I were up against a pig right after I bought the jacket. We got spooked off a gen and decided later to return to it. She nearly shit her pants when she started approaching the get I was crouched next to when I told her I was about halfway there. The pig was the one crouched by the gen and she honestly thought it was me and nearly walked into them. 
---
You shouldn't have to connect the dots AFTER suffering the unnecessary consequence. You should be connecting them before. It's a simple mechanic that needs a simple signal. Your reasoning should be applied to more complicated perks, builds, and meta knowledge. Not something as simple as going down in one hit.
---
Shit game design.

I watched someone named Marth get a 4K in about 30 seconds with the Nurse last night and have decided to start practicing her with no consumables.
---
Can someone help me understand why her full charge blink sometimes feels like your trying to move through molasses in winter when you are in open space? It's like I'm going in slow motion and barely move 2 feet on the map. 
---
Yeah, Doc has a passive ability while in Treatment mode called Static Field. Your Static Field is equal in size to you Terror Radius and Survivors within gradually gain madness proportionate to their distance from the Doctor. So those at the edge go mad slower than those close by.
---
Another thing to note, that you may not be aware of. Shock Therapy has a 2.5 second stun effect. Meaning if you shock someone running toward a vault or a pallet they can not use it for 2.5 seconds. Great for catching Survivors out at vaults or forcing them to drop a pallet early or just abandon the loop.
---
As for perks, it depends on the particular Doc build you're going for. Doc's got a surprising number and variety of play styles. A few builds for him I quite like: 
---
Impossible Skill Checks - Distressing, Unnerving Presence, Huntress's Lullaby, and BBQ &amp; Chili for perks with your two best Calm add-ons. While *afflictions* do not stack the stat modifiers do, so Distressing + Calm Carter's Notes + Calm Class II provides maximum Terror Radius (but only in Treatment Mode). Unnerving causes harder and more frequent skill checks while inside the Killer's TR, Lullaby increases the failed check penalty and, if it lasts long enough for the stacks, makes checks significantly harder. Add all of that to the madness skill checks and hitting a check can be extremely difficult. Lullaby can be swapped with Overcharge if you prefer not to chance a Hex. Either way, pair the build with a Game offering for maximum effect.
---
Surprise Doc - Monitor and Abuse, Nurse's Calling, Tinkerer, and BBQ &amp; Chili for perks with, once again, your best Calm add-ons. This build subverts expectations with Doc and is *insane* when it works, though can be hard to pull off. Unlike normal Doc you **DON'T** want to use Treatment Mode with this build until near the end, to flush out the last one or two immersed Survivors or to locate your slugs. Rather, you stay in Punishment Mode and take advantage of the alternate effect of the Calm add-ons, the reduced TR in Punishment. Monitor and Abuse + Calm Carter's Notes + Calm Class II = a 10m TR in Punishment. And 0 TR once Tinkerer fires. You can frequently get the drop on Survivors. Works best, IMO, on Lery's where the walls can hide you.
---
Rail Gun Doc - Monitor and Abuse and Discordance with any 2 other perks (except Distressing) and the High Stimulus Electrode and Interview Tape. This one is more about the add-ons, so the perks are more flexible. Interview Tape turns Shock Therapy into a 3m wide and 20m long beam. The Electrode increases that size and range 75%. So a 4.5m wide and 35m long beam. M&amp;A keeps your TR down to only 24m out if a chase, meaning you can shock *well* outside heart beat range. Discordance alerts you to Survivors on a gen, get in range and zap em before they even know you're there. Also tends to work best on Lery's, not too shabby on The Game, either.

I think we both are coming from the same background. But please don't misunderstand my complaints, as you and I only want better for future tournaments. I can empathize and see where they are coming from as a company, not only is this method cost effective, it gives them more exposure. But with how the timings are setup, you are sacrificing proper scheduling in order to make the event longer. 
---
There are 12 different chances to enter, absolutely, but I do think that condensing by at least half would allow for better prizes, better scheduling, and possibly better attendance. I would like to strike a balance with these factors for future events. When it comes to actually playing in the match, you will be dedicating 4-5 hours out of your day in order to be available. As you said, the matches in DBD are short. One match in a bracket will usually last less than half an hour, but if you go out and do something, you risk losing that availability. You sure can go and do other stuff while waiting for your next match, but going for anything more than ordering food might pose a risk of you missing your match.
---
In the end, I think that a better balance can be struck when it comes to dates, times and prize money. I hope that it can be done in the future.

Playing killer on console is very hard. Survivors 360 all day (it's easy to do with joysticks), but it's hard for us killers to smack them out of it.
---
Nurse feels almost impossible. I was around when she had the auto-lunge after a blink, but that was taken away. With a mouse, you can just flick behind really quick and smack the survivor, but it's very very difficult to do that with a controller. If you do not teleport directly behind the survivor, then odds are you won't hit them.
---
I haven't even mentioned the frame rate.

Couldn't agree more. Im just biding my time for another asymmetrical horror multiplayer game. Last Year isn't very good so, still waiting.

If you use Frank's mixtape and kick the pallet you caught the survivor at you will break the chase and then just track normally. Frank's means you don't even need to 'wait' for them to bleed out, just hit them again.

seems like fun.

---
You alright there, man?
---
You are supposed to either get them stuck on objects enough (easier with a controller than a mouse/kb), or have a team mate make the killer try to swing at them. Or flashlights/pallets. Or having hooks be sabotaged in the vicinity of where you were picked up. It can be done, as long as they don't have Iron Grasp or Agitation, but on your own it is very unlikely.

---
It do be like that sometimes...
---
Hey man what's your  stream? I want to follow you. 
---
DS is awful on Consoles due to frame drops :/
---
Well, this is an easy break for the person in the video because the survivor is wasting time and flashlight energy doing that. What a perfect time to stop and eat.
---
*These are the quality dbd moments* lel
---
I always say gg as killer
---
So just to make sure I'm reading this correctly, you think a survivor shouldn't DC because it ruins everyone else's fun, but you think the killer should be able to play whoever they want even if it ruins the survivors fun?
---
I don't think survivors should be able to decide what killer someone uses, but I also don't think they have to sacrifice their time in an unpleasant game just for the sake of the killer/other survivors either. Seems pretty ridiculous that one side can do what they want and the other should just deal.
---
I’d say LoL is way saltier. And CSGO is god of salt.
---
I was wondering why I got stuck in place, I was by a tree root after breaking a totem and couldn’t move. Just rotated in place as my team got taken out one by one followed by myself.
---
Phase walk, more like p l u g  w a l k
---
Thank you! I've been using Photoshop CC lately. I recently switched over from Photoshop CS6 (which I did like better), but CC is also pretty good program.
---
He can down people in one hit, all they have to do is actually play the game and they'd get more points and have more fun. 
---
I know, it’s just that I know the pain of having to prestige huntress 3 times and getting whispers t1 until level like, 40 or something of each prestige. 
---
Yup, Kate is thicc
---
You could just play killers you like and put the blood points into Leatherface. 
---
Wait, you can draw in Photoshop? My life is a lie.
---
Edit: this kicked me out mid way through a fame whilst playing as Mike...
---
Yea I keep telling myself I’m gonna level her and then end up going somewhere else. Been putting a lot in survivors lately cuz they are just so much easier to play 
---
very this...
---
You can pump points into him without playing him to get the teachables.
---
Lmao I was sorting by new... and I just made a post about playing as leatherface. Lmao. This was two posts down and it’s probably guys like me grinding for BBQ&amp;Chili teachable.
---
&gt;Gets loads of GGs, Survivors love him
---
So the guy on the right doesn't exist
---
Just do what I did and play as killers you like and put the BP into cannibal, get his teachables and never touch him again. 
---
Honestly it’s all about getting right on survivors ass, I hated him too and slogged though 35 levels... then it just clicked. It’s worth it dude bbq is insane and I don’t play my killers until they get it.
---
The best ace comes when you get 11 kills
---
Yeah I’m an idiot for not thinking of this 😂😂 thanks 
---
It's probably cause of that reason is why they camp.
---
Hyprid Panda did a test on this, you don't get a lot of points if you camp every hook so who knows why people do it.
---
Some people find fun in just securing the kill, therefore completely destroying the fun for everyone else. Also the thing about Cannibal is, that he can down multiple people at once, so he's a pretty good freaking camper. But in time You'll see that the most of the people that camp with Leatherface are just a bunch of A-holes, that are probably too scared of losing the match without a single kill.
---
yo whatup it's ya boi ace pisscunti here to make it known that this joke died about 6 replies ago so any more of you unfunny dorks thinkin about adding on better think again or else there's gonna be trouble gamers...
---
It is also unfair for high rank survs who get paired with potatoes. All the absurd (and failed) flashlight saves attempts drive me mad.
---
Being a part of this is probably my greatest achievement
---
Yes, it's a really good perk and it helps so much with the BP grind, and it never hits the shrine. 
---
Why u bulling me? ;(
---
It’s like “gonna” or “about to”. I’m not sure if it’s new or not but it definitely became more popular the last few years
---
I mean when the other 3 have escaped and the last one isn’t able to because of the trap, but just ignored the trap completely and gets to leave because of the hatch
---
&gt;With the locker aura change, BBQ is useless 75% of my games. Especially in combination with Distortion. I use it for the double points exclusively now. If it somehow actually reads an aura, bonus! Until they add another alternative that awards points \*post-game,\* I will always have BBQ on to counter the slow progression in this game.
---
God damn it Spencer
---
No codes and from current knowledge the wolf mask will stay exlcusive
---
He has no counterplay whatsoever.  He can run at near-sprint burst speed, hit you repeatedly with virtually no cooldown, quickly vault pallets, windows, you can try dodging but it's pretty much impossible if they're not braindead.  
---
If you get away from him and start mending and he comes upon you, you, as a survivor have literally nothing you can do since your bleedout timer continues to go down when you start mending.  Your only choices are to fall into the dying state and stop mending or let him hit you into the dying state.
---
Honestly, it's just insane how both poorly conceived and executed he was.
---
That's interesting. For me, console has a better frame rate, because I was previously playing on a Mac with a dual-boot windows setup, &amp; it liked to shit out on me constantly &amp; make it impossible to hit skill checks. The sync of skill checks/the visual was always really off for me. Like, I had no way of predicting when I actually needed to press? While on console I've found so far that I can usually hit greats without much stress.
---
I did run into someone playing nurse last night! I was wondering about that, because it seemed like they were really struggling, but I wasn't sure if that was because they were rank 17 or because it was harder on console for whatever reason, but I don't really have a lot of experience playing killer on either platform, because the scenery wooshing by in first person gives me motion sickness.
---
DbD is quick bursts of intense salt, while League is just a constant flow of salt all-throughout the experience
---
I would use it, but the hook auras are so distracting when I'm trying to just get a quick glance where totems and gens are. :/ I hope they add a purple variant that doesn't read hooks.
---
Damn bro, respect. Shoutout to my Kate mains
---
Wait, wtf? You work in a video store? Like, with shelves of DVDs and stuff?
---
I haven't played magic is years but wouldn't your deck be over saturated with add-ons, equipment and mana to be of any real use since the amount of killers in this game is awfully low. The killer cards would have to be godly in health and damage output as well as cost to cast to make up for the fact your odds of drawing one.
---
But for real, if you are in a game where 4 people would have gotten away if it weren’t for NOED and then the killer gets 2-3 of you, what were you doing? It’s NOED, the 3 people who weren’t hit first should have just left and the killer would only get 1. Sometimes altruism kills.
---
Well tbh even at low tier games it just slows the game don a little bit
---
Urban evasion, alert, premonition and spine chill?
---
I dont think i need to explain urban..
---
Alert: i can see where the killer is beaking stuff and what direction he goes so im gonna go not that way.
---
Premonition: literally tells you if you look in the killers direction 
---
Spinechill: literally tells you when the killer is looking in your direction so you can use urban evasion to leave without sprinting.
---
It won’t make you magical right. Go ahead. Keep your long wait times as payment for your ignorance. 
---
Ahh classic camping pigs who forget survivors have third person view.
---
Had a hook camper once. I just ran infront of them and got her to chase me then slammed a pallet right on her oinkers and got the unhook (so satisfying)
---
To be fair I didn't click the link. I'll go back and read the post again because maybe I'm misunderstanding here but you better hope you have a lot of billies right from the start since that's your lowest costing cast until you can get the entity out of your deck. Because the way the entity card is worded you'll have to wait until your 4th turn before you can pull a killer out of the deck. Maybe make a killer that has first strike with lifelink to even out the fact you're about to take a bunch of damage right from the start.
---
I'm not familiar with the whole commander thing. Is that new or what?
---
Am I missing the joke?
---
I thought sirens made noise, like the mythological sea women monster.
---
Become you are so clearly intellectual.
---
Stop. Messaging. On. This. Thread.
---
You're basically contradicting yourself by the end of that post 
---
Either that or Save the Best for Last. Just ignore your obsession while getting increasingly faster in downing their teammates.
---
Maybe I don't know what you mean by lobby timeout. Do you mean a time before you can queue again? Or time you can spend in the end game lobby?
---
Thank you so much!
---
We really won’t, someone else with repetitive complaints will probably be on the next post. They’ll all still play the game though. 
---
Aw! Thank you :D
---
Yeah! There are different presets that help you get set up with painting, illustration, etc. Then again, my drawing style is a little weird (I draw with my mouse, not a stylus or tablet), so it might be an odder choice for someone who uses one of those methods.
---
Rip finding claudettes in pitch black
---
Maybe. What I mean to say, really, is that it's not so much a chase extender in the same way Balanced Landing, Dead Hard or Lithe are. It just puts you in a good position to begin a chase.
---
Do you really think players don't change regions? Lol
---
Do you believe that your region is blacked out to viewers elsewhere? Lmao
---
Do you think that somehow players in your region are somehow better based on location or what's on the water or something? Lmfao
---
OK, bro. 
---
Well, I don't draw at all, (I have horrible art skills, but I wish I could), still, I can't believe I've never known this.
---
Theres only subtle differences, like her in game model with pink hair had a red skirt, but the 4k model has a green one. I figured I'd just do both since it's so easy!
---
Coincidentally, the Nurse's.
---
No, idk, I think playing at times when many people are online helps so the overall pool is larger so you're more likely to get griefing troll jackass survivors of closer ranks instead.
---
Dwight mains rise up against your opressors
---
*Totem boom*
---
**Heartbeat suddenly draws closer**
---
At the very least rank 15 should be a hard cutoff that you can never go back below.
---
I don't play survivor much and this reset dropped me to rank 16. There are killers deranking all over the place on PS4. Playing solo survivor last night and the entire group got destroyed in under five mins by a P3 Billy.
---
Well, no, the killers normally chasing and killing people, thats why most slasher flicks have at least 4 kills not one... 
---
Otherwise movies like friday the 13th would be a rom-com with an hour of jason standing under a dying survivor on a hook
---
i had this happen ages ago a couple of times
---
Most pigs I face exclusively camp/tunnel the person with a trap on their head.
---
Maybe for the killer, but not for the survivors. Then again, I think it should remain this way for both, because a big chunk of this game is not knowing 100% of what's going on at any one time, for either side. Yet another way of how SWF breaks the game.
---
Yea, the point is, no one on RE5 needed a crosshair to learn how to use Sheva's bow.
---
Fact of the matter is, if the devs wanted Huntress to have a crosshair to make aiming easier, she'd have one.
---
She doesn't.
---
So you can make all the excuses you and downplay it all you want but using a 3rd party program to give her a crosshair is still giving yourself an advantage.
---
I'm not being an asshole by stating facts. Just because you don't LIKE those facts and think they shouldn't apply because you think it's trivial is irrelevant.
---
His hatchet throws couldn't have been very good in the first place if he felt the need to use a cross hair hack to make it easier either way.
---
Is this what art looks like
---
Had the same thing happen last night.  I’m sure teammates/killer thought I was trolling or something but should only spin in circles.
---
I already basically covered that it doesn't work like other exhaustion perks. But none of the other ones really work like any of the others either. Lithe you have to be in a chase, Dead Hard needs timing, injury, and a button press, and balanced landing needs at least a small drop to work. SB is just the most generic of them
---
The more I think about this the more I realise just how badly a basic zombie or elf deck would fuck this idea of yours all the way up. It isn't a bad idea. The deck is just super weak due to how slow it is. 
---
Spirit 👌👌👌
---
That’s what I’m thinking 😂 time to plug my Spotify for all those matches I save someone’s live and they feel they owe me 
---
Spirit is hard, but really good. Her perks aren’t bad either. Hag is great too and her perks aren’t that bad either, especially hex Ruin. All depends on playstyle. Do you like being a spooky bitch or a T H I C C trappy girl. 
---
Ranking in general on PS4 is bullshit. Absolutely no indication of skill level. I'm either flattening survivors who show zero stealth and evasion skills or getting absolutely destroyed - often in the same game.
---
Natürlich ! JAWOHL !
---
Mask on the right looking mad edited 😒
---
No it isnt. Don't kid yourself.
---
"You bring Iron Maiden into the game ! YOU BROUGHT IT HER !!! I WILL END YOU !!"
---
Dwight, propably not ! 
---
...in the past
---
They used to not come back lol
---
I mean the deck isn't done haha, so not sure how you figure that.
---
Just wondering what people think about for unique killer ideas! I'd like them to really affect the way the game is played, so I'm looking for ideas like I have on the pig.
---
Just a shitty paint job I'm afraid! I re-did the placement of the rivets and it pulled off the original paint. I did a horrible job color matching the base layer and tried to cover it up. In the future I'd like to start from scratch again but for now it'll do
---
If you want to be rational about it, only prestige them if you actually need better chances at their rare bloodweb stuff, otherwise don't bother or pump up your other killers first. Probably get a fallback survivor to have a decent setup before prestiging your main. Stocking up BP before prestiging helps (but I didn't have the patience to actually do it, lol). Get rid of your good stuff before prestiging of course (most important, you want some ROI on BP offerings).
---
Getting less random teachables before prestiging actually might be detriminal though.
---
Complaining about pallets be like

I get this error when I shut down the PC
---
Our dates have been based on availability of our staff. We have had weekend tournaments, weekday tournaments etc. For this one we wanted to try some things but the issue was that Pax east and other Conventions would of gotten in the way for this one. This version may not be for everyone, but I can't speak for them but it probably won't be the last either. 
---
Calling them Unprofessional I think is a bit harsh other then the fact that they are just learning to get there footing in a community that is not very receptive of the idea. There are many many ways to hold a tournament. They actually did another circuit before this but only for console as a test run and they loved the idea. So they decided to give it a run for the PC community. The biggest issue is the fact there is no dedicated servers atm and that really puts a damper on a lot of possibilities, but over time with new ideas, new tools and more experience we will be able to do more. 
---
I have been getting tunneled and/or camped a lot in the last few days - I‘d say 7/10 games- and it’s making the game very unfun and frustrating to me.
---
I am jut looking for things you guys do in those situations to keep having fun, or builds you use too drag out chases for as long as possible to punish the killer for tunneling even more.
---
Big brain Hag play: Put all your traps at the exit gate. You won't win, but you'll probably give someone a heart attack, and that's all that matters
---
I mean, not really? Europeans generally stick to whatever language they grew up with, but yes a lot of Europeans, in fact a lot of people around the world, learn English due to it being generally classified as the "universal language." For some reason everyone in the U.S. thinks that Europe is the greatest place on the planet and everything is so much better and there's so much diversity in everyone and it just really isn't true.
---
Everything else looks great, just something I noticed
---
Upvote for admitting this. 
---
Im getting the same, when they finally add dedicated servers its gonna fix just about everything wrong with the game. Or atleast it should 
---
I have to disagree with August. 
---
1. Hag is just as monotonous as any other Killer. Her gameplay is more akin to chess than cat &amp; mouse. Your goal is to anticipate survivors rather than chase them down.
---
2. Spirit does not take more skill to play. They are equal.
---
3. Mind games are very much a thing for Hag. Again, it's more of anticipation mind game rather than in the moment mind games. But there are times where that can happen too. Ex: Survivor goes for a pallet with a trap already on the other side. They slap the pallet down and trigger the trap. You can teleport and try for a grab if they hop back over, wait for them to hop back over or simply teleport and ignore the pallet if they continue running. OR if you have a bunch of traps laid down, you can herd a survivor towards them for free hits. That's mind games as well. 
---
4. You can jump scare people with Monitor and Abuse. Knocking your terror radius down + her short height = a grab off the generator.
---
5. Hag's perks are booty. Don't buy her unless you want to play her style. No judgement if it's not your thing. But she is fun.
---
6. Her Mori is the best in the game (IMO).
---
No worries! I appreciate the feedback!
---
i didnt get any response
---
Who's "they?" Every single survivor player? You're punishing the wrong players, in turn creating more of the behavior that clearly upsets you. Totally understand your frustration but unless you're specifically playing against those jerks again, you're punishing the wrong people. 
---
Next summer is far away. It's really bad atm tbh

Ye, he was an awful Huntress, he put on a cross hair, BOOM, dude looked like he had aim bot, crazy shit, man.
---
Since you can somewhat control the movement during the attack, you can backfoot a little to try and turn a pallet stun into a pallet destruction. Otherwise what he said :)
---
Do people  not realise you can crouch lol
---
Thanks for your input! I here her play style being compared to creating a web as well as playing chess, both being things that I really appreciate about her play style 
---
NOED needs addressing, but not until the game is in a state where half the roster is unplayable without it, and *certainly* not before DS is addressed.
---
It’s old and from the south. I think it came from conjoining from combining ‘fixing to.’ People just got extremely lax with the pronunciation and here we are now.
---
Ufff The Besto Husbando. The Legion's one is awesome too
---
2 definitions for me:
---
- overcommitting to a bad chase where you have no momentum and a survivor is able to waste lots and lots of your time while the rest does useful things.
---
- going out of your way to kill a survivor that has already been hooked, which usually is frustrating for the guy and, again, this can be a bad chase you spend way to much time on.
---
(Say, you hook Laurie, Dwight is injured when rescuing her and you see him first, but he hasn't been hooked yet but Laurie off in the distance is dead on next hook and your Dying Light... and you skip the detour to smack Dwight and go straight after her, turns out the area she ran to has a million pallets)
---
Less toxic and less hackers, but lobby dodging and disconnects are rampant.  Survivor is easier due to FPS issues and the aim heavy Killers aren't as popular. Apart from this, almost identical to the PC variant. Same amount of camping from Killers, same meta perks, no post-game chat so it is a bit harder to harass.
---
Freddy iz OP
---
It just be nice to know if all the surviors have it, it doesn't need a nerf or buff really
---
Oh. Gotcha. I liked fast decks when I used to play it. Or decks that can take a few turns to build up but would completely over run you in the long term. 
---
&gt;Easy:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Rage significantly increases movement speed and then there's suddenly a movement speed bonus AFTER Rage? Broke.During this meth-like sprint you also have no attack cool down. Sprint stab, keep sprinting, stab downed. And even if you miss and rage ends, random movespeed bonus to Really finish that "chase".

God you’re quite anti-survivor 
---
Ah well, I personally play both because doing killer instantly is so stressful. The skill cap for survivors is so low compared to killers, but killers (like spirit and nurse my favs) require a lot of skill to work 
---
how ironic 
---
It closed the game for me. 1 second about to chase someone next moment I'm staring at what you see here. 
---
She's just a VERY flexible person.
---
Stop judging her!
---
Damn that's beautiful
---
Sure, in contrived fiction and writing, I was talking about everyday real-life usage. I'd love to hear a casual example from you if its so common.
---
Don’t know what you’re talking about. Nurse is better on console. Survivors can’t run away if they don’t have any frames to do so....(/s even tho I don’t think it’s required).
---
Legion still sucks regardless.
---
It’s a 110% speed killer...
---
No, it's poor game design. They could have used any other word when designing the game. It was a poor decision.
---
What country do you live in? Because in the USA I've never seen it used that way, even once.
---
You could replace Legion with Nurse and this meme would work just as well, if not better.
---
I have my sensitivity jacked up. Can confirm. Usually still don’t hit them. I’m also dumb tho.
---
I can believe it, 10 trials today and the moment you unhook or get unhooked: back on the fucking hook you go. If the Killer finds you first it is game over, at least on PS4.
---
I do hope that with time, Space Esports will be able to provide a better experience for all. The main things I can see that would be best to get straight would be the scheduling. When it comes to getting the tournaments going and ending, you guys did a great job with the first Weekly Ritual match. Other things are more on rules and such, which I have my own opinion on, but getting scheduling down is what would probably be most important. When it comes to the unprofessional criticisms, you guys are a company. Putting down your participants is not ideal, rather explain to them why their concern is either wrong or take more time to listen to that person. The way you guys dealt with the person who was not happy with how the maps were chosen is utterly unprofessional. I think you should've thought about it more, as the poll really can be swung into one team's favor just because they have a large following. Again, you may say that maps don't decide winners, and that is true. But for competition's sake, why not edit the way maps are drawn? What is so wrong with that?
---
They could use another term that is more clear, I think everyone agrees.
---
20 would be a blessing compared to what I get
---
He may be easy to beat (without any add ons), but it's just not fun imo. Being slapped as a survivor, you have to mend and heal over and over again. The killer is not even going to chase every survivor, so it isn't really going to be an intense game, but an annoying one.
---
Spirit is the second best killer so her
---
But 100% i will carry this info to the team and add it to the discussion for futute events. People just have to understand we can't make it convient for everyone and not every version may be for people. 
---
Sounds a billion times better than last years tbh
---
Don't get me wrong, spine chill is nice and all. I just feel there are better perks. 
---
My current setup is Adrenaline, Self-Care, WGLF, Botany. I like this build quite a bit but I think it needs something besides Botany. Another build I used to run a lot was Lithe, Dance With Me, Quick and Quiet, Self Care or Lightweight. I loved this build until Lithe started bugging out and not going off or I would just get hit through the window. 
---
I can see a significant increase in the amount of oinks per second i can achieve, thanks
---
That's actually pretty spot-on! 10/10 would get stabbed by
---
But can you see through the mask?
---
Sow the game down
---
just a lil bit
---
The entire game in its current state is hosted by you, the killer. I have nearly 700 hours in this game and not a single time have I encountered this nor heard of it until now. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and say its happened to you. Sure. It's a thing that exists. But throttling your own connection wouldn't cause this. This would have to be a hack. Throttling your connection as a survivor would be idiotic. It would not benefit you at all. This cheat you're talking about has nothing to do with your connection or the survivor's. 
---
There are MANY videos online of killer's lag switching, which is possible as the survivor's connection is dependent on the connection of the killer. It is not possible for a survivor to lag switch as the current dead by daylight network topology uses something similar to a star connection.
---
 [http://prntscr.com/m7o1qr](http://prntscr.com/m7o1qr) Here's a picture for a visual. The killer is the node in the middle, and all the survivors are the monitors surrounding the killer. I'm not trying to degrade or belittle you, I'm just breaking this down so you can't misunderstand me, with that being said I will continue. If you were to cut off, throttle, or do other various things to one of the survivor nodes, it wouldn't affect ANY of the other survivors, or the killer as the killer is the host, and all the other survivors depend on the killer. However, the killer is capable of doing all of the above I've mentioned as he is the host of the connection and that's the nature of the star networking topology. 
---
It is literally, IMPOSSIBLE for the survivor to gain any sort of advantage for manipulating their connection. If you stall your connection as a survivor and run away, on your screen you might be running away, but on the killers (as they are the host), you will be stuck in place and are able to take damage as YOU, THE KILLER, are hosting the game. I implore you to link me some of these "videos on this" matter as I can link you hundreds of videos of killers lag switching, but I can't manage to find a single video of a survivor doing it. 
---
If a survivor is literally hacking it's possible to mess with the game's engine and have a teleporting effect. It's a speed hack though, and it has nothing to do with the networking side of things. In my 700 hours of playing, I've never played against a cheating survivor, only killers. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but it certainly doesn't happen enough as you've suggested.
---
Did you add the bottom part later? Or is everyone blind?
---
Been playing Nurse with NC, Sloppy, Bloodhound and an experimental slot for which I just got level 1 BBQ. Before, this setup has been working well for me, usually getting 4k while with other killers, it's a toss-up between getting some hard-fought kills or getting outright bullied.
---
But I feel that with BBQ, I'm overcommitting on tracking perks with only Sloppy to slow down game progress? Is that a legitimate concern and what can I do about it? I have no Ruin and not many teachables (Billy's, Trapper's and some random shrine stuff that included BH).
---
No this was in the middle of the game. Also her camping was no problem in any way. The situation was just funny because I was right there and she did not notice.
---
That feels like The Game
---
Survivor queues are awful on PS4 as well even though im solo. Takes me anywhere from 2-10 mins to find a game. 
---
It’s what he deserves

this is the best cosplay of her I've seen so far.  the only detail I noticed that didn't match was the white drawstring on the hood.  but that's such a small difference.  great job
---
Yeah he can make one or two survivor's match hell, but they spend so much down time walking around in 110% speed and "moonwalking" to break chase and start the Deep Wounds timer that the other survivors can just pound out generators. 
---
I'm not really sure what you're suggesting? You play against top people you are bound to get beat every now and then and you only lose 1 pip. 
---
Even he was confused at first 
---
If you can't win without insta downs..
---
I’m convinced the only reason No Mither is in the game is to give top tier survivors a challenge. Is this true? It grants no additional bloodpoints and you have to use up two or three perk slots to get advantages with it and even then it’s not worth being one hit all the time. Plus killers tunnel the hell out of No Mither survivors. 
---
You having a point in this conversation? Silly you 
---
Replying to this comment specifically. When I say that they have an advantage when it comes to the map poll, what I am saying is that they can predetermine the map before it is even polled and find game-changing bugs on the maps. There is a HUGE bug that I noticed while practicing and playing in the first Weekly Ritual on Cole Tower, and that is that Ruin will spawn in the same location consistently unless there is another hex perk. If something like that were to happen again, it's basically an upper advantage. Please look at the vod in the games that ruin was played. When looking from the center of the map, Ruin will always spawn in the left corner looking at cole tower or if a totem doesn't spawn there, just in front of the cole tower to the left. This is what I mean by game breaking bugs.
---
It increases the chances to get rare add-ons / offerings / items the further you prestige.
---
When you say that you now have less time to react to start crouching when you see whispers activate, it may not be as bad as it seems, since survivors usually can’t even notice the heartbeat when you are on the very edge of the terror radius
---
it’s fine lol
---
But I’d rather not get fucked by a P3 nurse and Huntress. 
---
F13 died before all of the licensing problems started happen. Honestly, it died not even three months after release

In most if not all matches the moment i let go of the gen there will be an explosion with no skill check notification before hand so it isnt like i am letting go in the middle of a skill check
---
It’s fine lol 
---
What does this have to do with de pipping teams? You said you have 1300 hours which I assume means you're low rank or rank 10 after the reset. Or were you a super low rank and they were too? I just see this post as you complaining that you lost I dont see where you're trying to fix a problem.
---
Sometimes people are better than you. You can either learn from this and practice to get better or give up. Your choice.
---
they can weed out the obvious bad apples where a player has more than one report against them, if there is an obvious pattern then they can take action
---
I second this 😂
---
Back when botting was allowed I used to do that all the time. It was so funny. I still do it every now and then just for shits and giggles. So if you see a Myers attack, then stalk for a few second then repeat for the whole game, watch out! Muahahaha!
---
It doesn't lmao. BHVR is a big company, even if they have to pay a royalty or smaller fee besides sharing profit, it's next to nothing for them. Not to mention if they started selling special costumes based on different movies, they'd probably charge at least 5 bucks for each of them, almost the same price as the whole DLC chapter itself. I doubt any IP holder would say no to that, because all they care about is money.
---
Yeah I had the bug 2x now (last month and about a week ago). Restarting the game worked for me but it‘s a joke..
---
Today I encountered a new bug: If you grab a survivor out of a trap it can bug which isn‘t new. After I grabbed one out, the trap completely dissapeared from the map. 
---
Additionally, it messed up the trap setting animation for the rest of the match too..
---
What a game
---
Ok I seriously need to see Nea performing Hag's mori now
---
I've never seen it before either, figured it was a typo at first since the keys are close :D
---
Yes, but you're *our* asshole, and we love you buddy.
---
An edgy teen murderer get fucked by 4 short, bloody black girls
---
Matchmaking for Survivor in general seems to be kind of messed up. 
---
Solo as well as SWF.. Hope they patch it soon tbh.
---
If you don't turn off messaging you still get harassed, and it they can harass you midgame too. 
---
You might also want to take whispers Incase the last survivor is hiding and you can’t find them
---
I absolutely agree. I enjoy Legion's, Myers' and Hag's mori a lot. Nurse's and Spirit's moris are my faves too. 
---
Cherry picking, ignoring everything stated and putting words in my mouth. Hoo boy you got a strong argument on your hands.....
---
Yeah I'm usually rank 1 for both sides on ps4 and I'm getting such bad teammates or I'm destroying as killers I don't really play
---
This was literally my friend when I was first talking to him about it he triggered me so fucking much

That’s a wraith add-on, it leaves terror radius but gives more bloodpoints.

Spirit needs no perks, she has lag switch built in. 
---
Well I feel dumb now. Thanks for the info, I thought it was a bug
---
It's an addon, it increases BP but keeps the terror radius even when cloaked. Run it with Distressing for a shit load of points and a very confused group of survivors. 
---
Ya, I know what you mean now, I think they were just better. There is always bound to be better people out there. There is nothing you can really do other than take the de pip and move on. I'm by no means trying to be toxic or sound like a jerk fyi. Just saying. It sucks sometimes but that's what  it is. Good luck out there next time!
---
Why? It's used by lots of people, it has a definition, its composed of letters. Sounds like a word to me
---
&gt;I think everyone agrees.
---
In response to someone who just **literally** disagreed. LOL, ok.
---
The word is *perfectly* clear if you're not an idiot. Show me ONE aura perk that uses Exposed to refer to revealing your aura. Go on. I'll wait.
---
Your tiers are massive. Slim them down a bit (A+/A/A- tier etc).
---
Huntress is above trapper?? On PC trapper is pretty darn good, I would put him up with clown honestly. And Huntress is tough to aim with am I troller. Spirit would have to be S tier with Billy, right?? She’s really powerful. 
---
I recommend not prestiging until you've hit bloodpoint cap. Use all your best stuff to get there or give it to friends in matches before you prestige.  
---
Cursed
---
I used thick foam and a heat gun to shape it, but if I were to redo it all I think I would have done a thinner foam covered in worbla so that I could make it a little more rounded than it is. 
---
I'm still really new to making things out of foam so worbla probably isn't necessary, I just felt like I struggled a bit getting it to keep its shape
---
The actual improvement in bloodweb rng in higher prestige levels is almost non-existent, so basically do it for the cosmetics. I have 2 P3-50 killers and a variety of other P1 and P2 killers, and the bloodweb rng hasn't seemed to improve at all. 
---
Saying it more to be a smart ass than to give a point lol
---
Eventually I will get a headphone/mic set. But I need to not be lazy and turned off by the ridiculous prices.
---
Me last night, got Lampkin as Huntress and had an embarrasing start, but once the first hook happened I started catching people left and right and Huntress' Lullaby was in a corner no one ever went to so came out with a 3K.
---
This would not be fair for console vs pc players. I.e. pc nurse would destroy most consoles survivors and pc survivors would destroy most killers, simply from the frame rate and input advantage
---
Must protecc the precious bean.
---
Dam I didn’t even know finna is so uncommon, in New York it’s a hourly thing 
---
Did you get the achievement? I didn't get it as Myers with 1 DC.
---
The basement thing is their own fault of course, IriHead is *easily* the most frustrating add-on in the game though.
---
Csgo , dota and league of legends all balance around the top 20% of their playerbases. Those 3 titles are some of the most massively successful and influential esports titles in existence.
---
You can disagree with me personally , thats fine your allowed to , but don't ignore the facts. There is a reason why gaming has its negative stereotypes attached to the genre. If gaming as a medium is ever to be accepted as a mainstay or actual artistic expression then it needs to be more than " just fun". Don't get me wrong I enjoy all of the devil may cry/god of war games. They are amazing works of art that have nearly flawless execution , wanna know the difference between those and a game like dbd though? They are single player exclusive , any multiplayer exclusive MUST have proper balance at its forefront for it to succeeded in the long term.  
---
Yup hopefully before halloween DLC i wanted Michael Myers my favorite killer and we got him many fans suggested to the devs like freddy leatherface etc and we got them Candyman would Have been a great Killer 
---
This never changes, just so you know. My teams at rank 1 farm me to death and crouch behind rocks while I do 2-3 generators alone (I use Bond, so I can literally see them sitting there doing nothing at all for several minutes).
---
What... is... this... This is hilarious.
---
Just as bad games happen as a Survivor, bad games happen as a Killer. Sometimes everything is against you, the procedural generation and map layout, the Survivors and their builds, everything. There are extremes on both ends (0 vs 4K). You get one of these out of 10 games thats still 90% decent trials, still getting stompef when you are supposed to Kill feels bad.
---
I deserve this for looking at your profile.
---
I don't think framerate and kb and mouse matter much for survivors. I don't notice a different anyway.
---
I agree certain killers will end up being stronger on PC but as of now, the game is balanced the same for both. It shouldn't cause much issues.
---
No Mither, Dead Hard, [This Is Not Happening, Resilence, Tenacity, Unbreakable] pick two here. If you run No Mither it’s literally telling the killer, please bop me on the back cause I’m Exposed. 
---
Huntress is definitely above Trapper. I think this applies to PC as well. The problem with Trapper is that unless you can place your traps well and people don't disarm them, your ability is literally useless in a chase, and you have to waste time collecting and setting traps. Unless you run Tru3talent's anti-chase build(SF/Enduring/Bamboozle), you can have a very hard time with Trapper against good survivors or on bad maps.
---
Huntress is lower B tier on console, I'd say B or B-. Aiming is unreliable with the controller, but she still has strong potential. I can't put her below Trapper in good conscience. 
---
I think Spirit is a bit weaker now since BHVR broke footsteps and scratch marks have always sucked. Still very strong, but imo, I think Billy is strong enough to be in his own tier. 
---
Of course, this is all opinion. I just thought I'd present something, since most tier lists you see have PC in mind. 
---
Thanks! I'll keep that in mind! ^^
---
I do really enjoy the lack of chat. It makes it feel much more relaxed. I do have my psn messaging turned off though, too.
---
I'm sorry.
---
well 2 things, the hex thing any team can figure that out EASILY in the 3 days leading up to the event after map is chosen. Also about bugs and exploits. This is game is VERY buggy and every map as an issue. Anything that is Exploited or buggy like areas of a map, will be brought up and will be warned if ABUSED will be bannable. We have to deal with the hand we got. So I understand the concern but we have the contingency planned for such an occurrence. 
---
Example, maybe a map will sometimes have a tile that ONLY the survivor can go through but the killer can't creating an Infinite loop. This being exploited will be banned, but the thing is it is RNG, it may or may not happen. So you have only a slim chance out of all procedural for it to work. Personally I went after the devs because of all these issues last year. There are always new changing bugs we will adapt and fix as we go :)
---
Also USA. See it in books and movies all the time. And so have you, you just never noticed. Which is super common. This isn't the first time I've had a conversation like this. "I'm feeling a little exposed here." is an *extremely* common term. Google it some time.
---
That's what was stopping me as well, but I found some really good ones with a USB connection to ditectly plug into the Playstation for only 50 euro. It's a Logitec G430 in case you want to look it up :)
---
😂
---
When common sense is so uncommon that people think you're lying when you say you use it.
---
Step 1 of playing Nurse on console... Where did that Claudette go?
---
No, just Adept - but the fourth guy was lost at the start of the game (and the other 3 gave me enough trouble that I saw no reason to give the last guy a free hatch or anything when I actually did get them), that must have been it then. Oh well, eventually...
---
Nurse has 2 blinks, last I checked. 
---
The Summer BBQ cosmetics (Kate's "Free Spirit" top and Billy's "Pro-Pain" hammer) were linited to just that event, but every event item released after can be found in the shop or are in your inventory (the Frosty Eyes cosmetics for Clown, Spirit and Legion)
---
I love doing this, but as a p3 Quentin
---
Ultimate corn plays
---
Except no , because if they play legion as they're intended to play him then they will not kill a single player at all and have a shitty gaming experience themselves. At the end of the day a multiplayer game with opposing side/goals will always result in one or more parties having less fun.
---
You or anyone else dcing ruins the ENTIRE game for everyone. A killer may not like they have to que up with a swf group running 4 ds's but it doesn't give them a right to dc because it ruins the experience for everyone. 
---
The same is true if any or all the survivors choose to dc because "they don't like the way a killer is playing/running" It makes it almost impossible for your team to win and leads to a much less exciting game for the killer. 
---
Moral of the story? Don't be that asshat , don't dc and everyone will be happier for it , be the bigger person. If you do though and you do it frequently then when you do get banned , don't ask why.
---
Joey's objectively cooler
---
I'm literally in love with Monto
---
That's true, the map layout is key. Maybe it was just particularly awful, that house with the pallet on the second floor is absolutely brutal if they have balanced landing. Can't even bamboozle the window because there are two of them!
---
Impossible. The game is not cross-platform playable as of now. Don't think it'll ever happen either.
---
Jeez 
---
Feelsbad 
---
Never heard that term used. If you've had this conversation before that should tell you something.

I like where this is going

r/expectedthanos
---
the obvious joke. i saw it coming
---
Yeah, I saw it the first time you linked it.
---
Chase the ones who immediately drop pallets not the ones who loop you first then drop it
---
We don't do that here. 
---
Honestly... I just want the ability to hear there foot steps while blinded again.
---
How it works is if you have dead hard and balanced landing (not restricted to these two, just an example) and you use dead hard, you cannot use balanced landing while still exhausted from dead hard. BUT if you have an exhaustion perk and adrenaline and are exhausted from the normal exhaustion perk and the final Gen pops, adrenaline will always take priority, giving you the heal (if needed) and the speed burst at the beginning even though you still have the exhausted effect from your first exhaustion perk.
---
TL;DR: you can't use two exhaustion perks at the same time but having only one and adrenaline is completely okay.
---
Well certainly it's partially a Wraith problem since even with his add-on buffs he's not that great, but it's basically a problem with any killer that doesn't have a chase ability (Pig, Freddy, Wraith, Leatherface, etc.). And what the hell do you mean people who can make chases last longer than 30 seconds are the team's "runner", literally anyone can have any perks and pallet loop just as well as anyone else, there are no character classes or anything. If you cut your losses and switch targets (which I did, once, in the match I described above, to great disappointment), you just lose the distance you closed on the one person in exchange for someone else who is equally efficient at looping.
---
And from your responses I take it you either haven't ever played the kind of match I'm talking about, or you have, and you're optimistic about your ability to improve in this game to a fault. I promise you, sometimes, there's nothing you, or anybody else who is even more skilled than you, can do.
---
Really? You would put trapper above huntress on a pc tier list? This is what my tier list would look like (completely from my experiences playing survivor and killer)
---
S: **nurse** obviously
---
A: **billy** because of the same reasons as console, **huntress** for the long range attack and easy hook defense, as well as shutting down short wall loops, **clown** because of the same reasons as huntress but with a slightly lower skillcap and no really long range presence.
---
B: **spirit**, was on the fence with this one but I think she is slightly worse than clown because of less reliable power (requires guessing, mind games, and luck), **myers** because of his instadown and stealth capability, very fun to play and play against imo, **legion** can’t say much about them because they haven’t been out long and are subject to change, but I’ve had more success with them as opposed to the rest of the killers
---
C: **trapper** because of his potential to stop loops very quickly and get free downs, however this requires a while to set up and can only be effectively set up in 1/3ish of the map, **hag** because of the same reasons as trapper, except she trades off trap efficiency for setup speed (also the traps are slightly worse, but hag with addons is infuriating), **doctor** because his power can be used in crazy ways to deny window and pallet vaults, and his tracking is great.
---
D: **piggy** almost made it to c tier but she never really gets fast kills. She slows the game down with her traps but it rarely gets her kills unless survivors are incompetent. **bubba** has an instadown and 115 movement speed but not much else going for him.
---
**Wraith**, i mean, if I’m honest my tier list gets really jumbled down here, but it is very difficult to make wraith work, however his better addons make him b tier at least.
---
F: is for **Freddy**, he’s bad. Real bad. Great for slaughtering noobs. Block addons make him almost good. But without them he is terrible.
---
Disappointed, I expected some hardcore Susie banging. 
---
In my opinion, no. Prove thyself is not worth a perk slot. Leader doesn’t do enough to drastically improve the survivors in the game so it’s not worth a perk slot either. Bond is his best one. But it maxes out at 32 meters and in my opinion isn’t worth a perk slot either. You start hearing survivors if they’re injured or gens being worked on just a little closer than 32 meters. And you can easily see survivors up to 32 meters on all but two maps. Empathy has unlimited range and even though you don’t see them unless they’re injured, it’s way better than bond overall due to the range. I’d use empathy over bond and bond is his best perk so I’d say no for any of the Dwight perks. 
---
ok first of all, you don't start with every perk unlocked. anyone who isn't an obsessive autistic tryhard isn't going to go look up what every single perk does before they play, they're just going to start playing. We're talking about a COMMON misunderstanding that new players have. Just look at all the comments in this thread. It happened to me too. I figured it out after awhile, but it wasn't by comparing perk descriptions. It really wouldn't be hard for them to change this term to be more "at-a-glance" descriptive. You're just arguing against it because... I don't know, you enjoy confrontation? You have an inferiority complex and want to prove a point about how smart you are to strangers on the internet? You're an autist who can't handle a tiny change? I'm not sure.
---
Well yes, but that'll still be a safe unhook for Adam to get Deliverance. Takes 7 seconds for the dream transition, and 10 for a safe unhook, so unless you hit them in the 3 seconds, he'll get a safe unhook for deliverance.
---
Been having the same problem on  Xbox since last week. I can’t even play with my wife and buddy because matchmaking takes about 15 -20 mins  I just said Fuck it and started playing a different game that actually works.  
---
I mean, Spirit is the only Killer I needed Stridor for. I'm more of a visual tracker, so I use Bloodhound and aura perks, but I'm sure this is make me better at tracking overall.
---
Not bad, not bad at all.
---
r/imagesyoucanhear
---
Just eat it now or it goes bad.
---
I think me and my friend wait up to 30 mins at a time on PS4 its pretty dreadful. 
---
No idea how much time I have ingame because PS4 doesn't keep track of that, but my devotion level is 2, so I think it's safe to assume that I have at least 200-300ish hours. All teachables unlocked on every other killer. Pig on P3, Leatherface on P2, Myers on P1, and the rest are 40-50, but I might prestige them one by one just for the sake of getting good perks on them (I leveled them up only to get their teachables so they barely have a page and a half worth of perks). I've unlocked all the teachables for about 6 survivors. My time on survivor is pretty minimal and I've only hit Rank 4 as a survivor once simply because I dont quite enjoy playing as survivor, not to mention the usually minimal BP gain.
---
I hope this answers your question(s).
---
I see. I don’t use dead hard personally but I do run balanced and Adrenalin. It’s toxic but I works.
---
Anyway, I appreciate the info man!
---
I dunno, k&amp;b gives you a lot more control over your character, killer and survivor, and it helps with watching the killer, scouting the map and routing your loops, and the extra FPS always helps
---
Legion is intended to be played as someone who goes around hoping to catch multiple survivors at a single gen then go on a stabby frenzy. Your "supposed to stab as many survivors as you can then go down the last one you hit without your power at 110% movement speed. The issue is the 110% movement speed is simply too slow to do anything against competent survivors. What would have only been 3 loops at max with both parties playing correctly is now 5. 
---
Another issue being it only takes 16 seconds to mend the deep wound , what this basically amounts to is you taking allot of time to go around and stab everyone only for them to spend significantly less time mending. Another problem is your base power doesn't last very long so you can't really use it to get around like you can with billy because you need ALL of you power gauge to hit a decent survivor.
---
What this ends up resulting in is you stab 1 or 2 people then tunnel the last survivor down with you 110% movement speed and waste a gigantic amount of time trying to down them. Spend a massive amount of time just getting around doing normal killing stuff.
---
This is why anyone who is actually trying to "win" with legion moon walks or runs franks mixtape , those legitimately are the ONLY ways to do well with him when facing competent survivors. The issue is legions power really doesn't give survivors any form of counter-play , those addons enhance his power so he uses it more and it ends up being pointless to even try to get away from a legion , hence the shit killer meme.
---
Okay, but why was it playing Christmas music in the background
---
BBQ shows all auras of all survivors that aren’t close by the hook. Unless they’re in a locker or have a hidden aura perk. It’s an anti-camping perk which is why it’s funny it’s a Leatherface perk because he’s the killer most likely to camp since he can down two people at once. Sloppy Butcher drastically slows down heal time and any perk that does that slows down the game and gives the killer an advantage. 
---
It's a fair mistake to make, especially since this game doesn't like to explain what debuffs do what and you have to figure it out on your own or through a wikipedia.  Regardless, "Exposed" does make it sound like they have vision of you.  "Fatal" or "Lethal" would likely work better.
---
Wait does it not?
---
https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/exposed
---
gee I wonder how people could have gotten the wrong idea
---
If you’re a PS4 player it’s because huntress players on PS4 often get bullied because of all their misses due to controller limitations and low FPS. Huntress is a good killer, but one of the most punishing killers if she makes a mistake. Because of these punishments and how frequently they get punished due to the difficulty of playing her on console, they end up doing rather poorly and will most definitely get teabagged at the exit gates because of how ridiculously poorly they performed, so they at least want to get a kill. How do I know this? I was a noob huntress console player once as well. 
---
Sloppy Butcher is good because it makes healing take longer, which means more time spent healing and less time spent working on generators.
---
BBQ is good because it's an incredibly strong tracking perk, and an incredibly strong farming perk. BBQ lets you see anybody outside of 32 meters when you hook someone, which lets you immediately have a direction to head to pressure survivors after a hook instead of having to start searching for survivors again.
---
For blood it should be sort of obvious if they're crouching/walking. If they're running just follow scratchmarks. Blood will leave an incredibly dark trail if they're crouching, and only have small spaces if they're walking. Use this if they're trying to crouch around a building you know they're near.
---
That is the most cursed thing I've read in a while

She's lonely, what do you expectm
---
Thank you! Follow up question, does Sloppy Butcher making them take longer to heal ALSO make it take longer for them to recover from Legion’s Deep Wound?
---
Don't worry about being toxic, man. You're just trying to survive, that's all. Now see, if you go out of your way to fuck with the killer then that's toxic but don't worry about that kind of stuff.
---
point in progression, imo
---
Sloppy Butcher is good because it slows down the game (just a little bit lol) especially when all the survivors Self Care.
---
BBQ is good because of the bonus bloodpoints of course and the "BBQ-chase"-cycle. Like, you hook someone, see the survivors auras and can immediately go to your next victim and don't have to waste time searching for survivors. Then you chase them, down them, hook them, see them, repeat.
---
As for the tracking blood part I'm afraid I can't help you as I don't play killer that much.
---
If you’re struggling by chasing a survivor who can loop you well: *don’t chase them*. Break off and go after some of the survivors on gens. There’s no shame is breaking off mid-chase to go after someone else if the person you’re chasing is going to buy a massive amount of time for their team.
---
Knowing which pallets to break and when is a good thing. Some pallets can wait to be broken and others need to be broken ASAP. Killer shack pallet (AKA God Pallet) is one that should be broken as soon as it’s dropped. Any pallet with a long “wall” attached to it needs to be broken immediately. Some pallets that have very short “walls” are considered unsafe and you should be able to easily hit survivors trying to loop you on those if they drop the pallet.
---
Aside from Ruin, what perks do you normally run? Do you pretty much only play Doctor? What rank do you usually sit at? (I know people say rank doesn’t matter but it sound like you may be newer to the game/killer)
---
I think differently, I’ll dc ASAP, especially once I found ruin / bbq in 3vs1. Cuz I don’t really like to play a handicap match with try hard killers. I had too much of this bullshiit lately and 90% of them never go easy on us anyway, so yea. 
---
with addons she can get up to 5 I'm pretty sure 
---
What is “getting a 4K?”
---
Are there any good Wraith builds that don’t require many teachables? I just started and therefore don’t have any, but am loving Wraith and Legion
---
Sloppy Butcher increases the amount of blood they leave behind while injured as well as making them take longer to heal. It does not apply to Deep Wounds. Legion *does* have add ons that increase the Mend action timer for Deep Wounds, though. They look like knives in the add on page!
---
Spirit, because her power doesn't get shut down by organized survivor play.
---
Not base 5 blinks, just like Huntress doesn't have base 1 down hatchets. 
---
I remember playing killer with no HUD at all for an entire game
---
It was obnoxious
---
I also remember dealing with what you dealt with as well, mid-game, skill checks wheels stopped appearing.
---
Thanks 
---
Huntress is above Trapper on pretty much every tier list I've ever seen.
---
no one's talking about her base kit, just that she has 5 blinks
---
Well you kept her busy long enough so other survivors got some free gen time :)
---
What is this...Fortnite???

No Shadowborn yet either - back in 2017 (took a long break), I was usually working with Nurse's core build, but since Stridor currently feels less useful (can't hear anything, I'd rather see the trails) and a lot of people say Thata is not really worth it, especially over buffed SB, I sort of threw them out...
---
Whenever it takes a long time, I just cancel and restart the matchmaking and it usually works in swf
---
I'm afraid I don't understand the point, then. I'd say it's balanced decently, given how powerful Nurse is to start, and how crippled it makes her against stealth. In the example here, a near invisible cosmetic for Pig would make her much more dangerous via what's supposed to be a non-gameplay affecting change. 
---
Xbox one X and I’m still getting like max 30 frames, unless I play nurse then ya... like 20
---
Another lie my teacher fed me. 
---
My first flashlight save!  I suck at aiming this but thankfully it works this time.   Also, at least the whole attempt, including being downed myself ended up in all of us escaping (Meg later escaped via the hatch as Billy was guarding the exit like a goal keeper).
---
Billy isn't in a tier by himself lol. He gets looped for days man. Spirit doesn't. If anything she is s tier.
---
I don't love WGLF.  I think it's an offering, not a perk.  I do love your QQ/ DWM build, and have run this before.

Moonwalking is just a more game-ified version of what they intended, which is for legion to not be actively chasing all that often.  I agree it doesn’t feel good to be on the receiving end of, I’m not arguing that.  I’m arguing it’s intended to be used with tracking features, or just good spotting.  Bloodhound makes it easier but is by no means necessary.
---
I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but BHVR has a very idealistic view of gameplay, which is to say that it will follow horror movie tropes.  I’d argue it feels just as bad getting Evil Within 3’d or Rancor’d as it does to bleed out to deep wounds, but those play in to the base features of the game so they aren’t complained about as much.
---
Again, I don’t think Legion is in an ideal spot, but they are definitely working as intended.  It’s also partially a matter of getting used to, and playing around, new game features that communities time and time again are resistant to and instead of attempting to learn the new system just complain.
---
No, no, no, no--I'm gonna have to stop you right there, man. No PC/console crossover. Jesus, us poor console players would get our doors blown off just based on machine performance. 
---
Rank reset just happened, so a lot of people will be doing SWF and sweating just as much as killers do during rank reset. If I were you I’d focus on becoming more precise with the blinks then worry in about a week how badly you may or may not be getting your ass kicked.
---
Its sooooooooo bad 
---
That's just what I've seen from gameplay. By design, anything that requires aim is better on PC, an I've seen gameplay of fairly ridiculous Huntresses on PC. 
---
Which is why I tried making a console tier list, since things like Nurse are very different. 
---
Are both purple. It's not like you can run a purple add on every single game.
---
Wait til it happens
---
If you're on xbox, the frames are ass for everyone, its just harder for killer and survivor.
---
If you're on PS4 survivor is still easier because the killer has to aim attacks with a stupid little stick, and frames are less consistent and lower than PC.
---
It's best to play on PC.
---
Yeah I really can’t imagine huntress with controller
---
Hardly. All it will do is cause survivors to hide rather than search for the hatch and this will cause a massive hindrance for any killer player.
---
Depends on how he plays, moon walking has no counterplay and is scummy af. Chasing normally at 110% is laughably bad, and going for 4 frenzy hits is doable, fun, and has counterplay.
---
Pallets the killer has to kick in order to get to you when you use them properly are in safer positions because of the long perimeters of the adjoining structures, other pallets can be easily sidestepped so they're more like traps if you use them, because you'll lose time with the drop and the intelligent killer can easily walk around and stab/chop/slice you, are in unsafe positions (most usually on Lampkin Lane). 0beast09's video has examples... but I feel calling the pallets themselves safe or unsafe to be unecessarily confusing because the pallets themselves do not determine safety, rather, their position does. I do understand this nomenclature was probably more convenient/faster for those already in the know, though.
---
That'd be nice, except the devs won't do that either.  Believe me, I had a lot of fun stomping on that hatch and shutting it in front of a survivor when it was in the PTB.
---
If it makes you feel any better, I usually tunnel the shit out of snitches.
---
Saying blue Susie is better is quite possibly the most triggering I’ve ever read 
---
Lmao look at all the racist wypipo
---
Yeah it’s still BS they took that away because it “wasn’t fun for survivors” when DS and NOED exist and they haven’t done anything. 
---
Imagine if BP's were tiered separately to individual killers and survivors. The game is already such a grind, that would be insane. 
---
Bing bong boi me when you get to it.  Good luck with your next games. 
---
I don't feel like playing survivor requires many delicate movements beyond 360s. If there is some advantage, it's far lesser than what you'd get in a shooter anyway.
---
Pink hair Susie is the superior superior 
---
My tactic of leveling is to level up a character to 50, then before I prestige, I use that character and add the bloodpoints to the next character I want to use until they have 4 perk slots. Then I prestige my lvl 50 character, and play the new one until they hit 50, and the cycle continues. 
---
You will find that after a certain point, there's no point in maining a survivor (other than skin preference) because you can get any perk you've unlocked on anyone you like. I learned that its better to just focus on unlocking the perks I want to try rather than sticking to a character I like. 
---

THESE DAMN KIDS NEED TO GET OFF MY INTERNET!
---
best theme
---
I think this is the best idea. Keep farming BP with current perk set and prestige until I have enough of them to quickly level back. 
---
Yeah it's pretty nice for that.  I tried it during double BP event... Very nice.
---
same, my friends and i think the default menu is too intense for the menu, usually while i wait for them i just enter the store to quiet down the game
---
I thought they could see my pp, so I hid in a locker.

change tyde for zubat and its perfect

This isn't how you should play Survivor, FYI.
---
Good Survivor Gameplay is wriggling around on a hook.

The more you know.

Increased item rarity
---
Well, I mean...I have Laurie as my flair but I primarily play Stalky Boi, Lisa and Rin.  If I'm playing survivor then I'm either Laurie (Laurie's scream best scream.  Change my mind!) or Ace.  Because finger guns.
---
*wypipo?*
---
We don’t use that kind of talk ‘round here, partner.
---
basically the daily life of a technician user
---
That’s the thing people don’t realize a lot in this game. They get perks that are amazing when you use them. Unbreakable. Deliverance. Etc. But they don’t use them enough to warrant a perk slot. Sprint burst and urban evasion are with me all the time because I always use them and they’re great perks. Lithe and balanced landing some maps will screw you and dead hard against good killers is useless after the killer knows you have it. Like you said, aftercare is good but it’s limited and you sometimes don’t get the full use of it. I want my perk slots to be things I’ll use a lot and are good perks. 
---
The devs have stated by summer, with the release of dedicated servers, is when the game will be optimized for all platforms. Considering they first promised it would all come in a December Patch I wouldn't put to much faith on everything being done by summer. 
---
I have to admit I rarely die to freddy. Mostly myers and damn leather face.
---
What's weird is I'm a survivor main never bothered with the perk, thinks it's cheesy and I stopped playing for legit a year and around the time I stopped there was constant mention of them looking into changing it so I come back to dbd recently expecting it to be completely different but to find it was the same 0.o?
---
I usually sit around rank 8. I am a survivor main but I mostly use Billy and gain advantage over my matches mostly through Nurse's calling and Bitter Murmur. My Doctor set up is M&amp;A 1, Brutal Strength 2, Bamboozle 1, and Ruin 1. I have mostly been focusing on leveling up killers and survivors to unlock their perks but almost 400 hours in I have become impatient with survivor and am starting to play more killer for more BP. The only problem with this is that I haven't played enough killer to get great match results meaning a small amount of BP without BBQ. I am starting to delve into tactics such as moonwalking and slowing myself down and hugging walls to trick survivors into thinking I am going a longer way which does not always work. 
---
You've gotta run a 4-man petrified oak + sabo boys build
---
That's fucking awesome. And I don't even like the legion in their entirety 
---
If you were in there a longish time you can get AFK crows, but it doesn't sound like that. If I had to hazard a guess he either got incredibly lucky, was checking out of curiosity or possibly heard you. Though survivors ratting you out could still be on the table. 
---
probably around... the 22nd? 
---
I was playing Cannibal for daily today and ruined a SWF group’s day. They were trying for the four man hatch achievement. I was running Franklin’s and cost them a pink map and let.

I fucking love this theme holy shit.

You look just like her! Good work on the mask and the hoodie stitches too!
---
What’s wrong with Predator? I run that on my Wraith quite often. 
---
I had my FPS dropped to 5 when I first encounter a Warith with Sloppy Butcher and Hemorrhage. 
---
Last 2 are basically mori's but for Survivor, especially the Ultra-rare one.
---
If a Killer takes an Ebony Mori they basically auto-win. If a Survivor would take Vigo's Journal they basically auto-win.
---
How does this fix hatch? Hatch is supposed to give the last Survivor a chance to escape. The problem with Hatch is that it's uninteractive as Killer and hatch stand-offs are cancer for both sides.
---
I can agree that there are hag mind games, but I was referring to mind games in the chase. Like trying to fake people out with window vaults, phase walking or just straight up hitting them. Maybe I’m not that good with the hag, but since she doesn’t have an ability that is directly involved with the chase she just gets a little boring for me after a few games because I start to feel like I’m doing the same thing over and over. However, you have some good points about the hag so I might try to give her more of a chance. 
---
He is right tho, enduring will do in a bit of an open field but they can still reach a pallet in time it they're lucky and get looping again
---
Well, I just learned a new trick.
---
they're cool, but i'd probably give them two feet 
---
People meme Freddy, but he's entirely dependent on add-ons and build. He gets rekt at r1 reliably if you run a random shit build. 
---
I mean, situational in the sense that you have to be close to someone, which happens multiple times every game. It's not that situational. I definitely think Leather is underrated. He has normal movement speed, breaks pallets fast, and an instadown. He's like Billy's retarded cousin, not awful but not nearly as good. 
---
I put Nurse on C for console because she's so hard to use correctly. She has high potential (obviously) but whatever difficulty there is to learning her on PC is multiplied exponentially on console. Most players are going to find Nurse on console to be mediocre without a shitload of practice.
---
Is there not an official subreddit discord or am I blind? I looked everywhere for it
---
I’ve seen countless legacy 3s try to kobe off hooks then just let themselves die 
---
I use bamboozle instead of hex: the third seal. It still works while in his power so it makes him even more annoying to verse. And it's especially good if you want the m1 down instead of a frenzy down because of how it blocks certain loops. 
---
Missing DS doesn't mean you will lose the game at all...
---
Sure, but it's there *now.* And when I think exposed I think I am exposed, I'm vulnerable. Like, even if you take it as meaning "visible" that **still** implies that you're vulnerable, no?
---
Nice
---
Third seal works better imo because you stab people so easily. Thanataphobia would be good if it wasn’t a shit perk. 
---
Would trim Huntress' bush ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
i mean wat
---
That's 30%, usually that's rarely a thing however you're right. That's FAR less likely, however, I appreciate the note.
---
r/ahaego
---
NSFW btw. 
---
Honestly couldn’t see you til the camera moved
---
That car won't go anywhere
---
The 30% is pretty fair considering how many tools the developers are given, and if the Devs are unhappy about the price cut, Steam lets them generate keys which the Devs can then sell elsewhere without Steam taking a 30% cut.
---
Also the Epic Store is pro-developer but not pro-consumer, and gamers are consumers, not developers, so using Steam makes more sense to them than the Epic Store.
---
This shit is just stupid. I have no idea why the Devs would keep it this way.
---
I agree. I think it might have been funnier that way. Still laughed though
---
Without Urban Evasion, its waste of time. Also, some traps are barely visible.
---
Legion mains after watching me try to play as legion for a daily
---
F13 is still a really fun game. It’s unfortunate the team lost their licensing, but with the release of stabilized servers it isn’t so bad. I don’t have to rely on another person’s connection to play the game anymore.
---
I’ve had tremendous amounts of fun with people I’ve met through the game. F13’s proximity chat and use of gadgets is refreshing compared to DBD’s chat and gadgets, but both have their pros and cons.
---
Trees have honestly been busted since at least the Beta (way too many personal experiences) but it's gotten much better over time. If I recall correctly the Asylum and Haddonfield trees were the most common ones to cause this bug.
---
Been awful the past couple of days on PS4. SWF especially. 20 minutes isn't unusual right now, it's ridiculous. 
---
I'm not normally much for cosplay but you really killed it on the mask. 
---
I’ve been away from this game for a while,does moonwalking have another meaning with legion?
---
Eh, not so sure "unprotected" would work. I wouldn't really consider the healthy state "protected." Vulnerable, yeah. Sure. Though it loses the context of Exposed. Vulnerable just suggests weakness, where as Exposed suggests the discovery or revealment of said weakness. And even the state of being "uncovered" or "visible" implies vulnerability, the notion that you're an easier target.
---
Honestly, rather than changing terminology this late into the game I think it'd be better to put status effect meanings in more visible places. There are effects that are far harder to figure out from their names than Exposed. Maybe just an extra few words after the effect name on the HUD. Like "Exposed - 1 hit down" and "Blind - auras blocked" and so forth.
---
I mean if I don’t do it someone else will while I’m being chased 🤷🏼‍♀️

Always clear the totems...always!  No matter what lol

You realize that comment is buried with the other child comments, right? If my goal was attention, then I would have made a stand alone comment for every reader to see when they scroll through the comments instead of replying to an extensive comment chain. All I did was express my feelings towards a game with many fundamental flaws that has made little progress towards fixing them after years. Sorry if that somehow comes across as attention whoring.
---
...? What does that prove? Wanna clarify?
---
Nice!
---
Adding on to what the other guy said find the closest 3 generators and try to protect them the most. If you are always losing pressure then guarding the 3 closest generators will enable you to slow the game down immensely when only 1 gen is left. 
---
But the main thing is knowing when to stop chasing. If a survivor runs away from all generators, or if a generator close is almost done, or if a survivor goes to an extremely good loop, etc. Sometimes it's best to simply hit a survivor and move on, unless you can guarantee a down quickly it's not worth it. Also some pallets are better broken once you down/hook the survivor, that way you have created pressure and have time to spare to get rid of pallets. It's mostly about learning loops and knowing which ones will waste too much time and which ones you can secure a kill at. With doctor certain loops can be a guaranteed hit if you can time his shock properly (only at vaults though, so windows and pallets. Pallet drops are pretty much guaranteed if the survivor is decent), also you can mindgame with the shock by usually shocking when someone gets near a pallet, then changing it up by switching back to punishment before the shock and going for a hit instead. Doesn't always work but it does sometimes, but that's the same with all mindgames. 
---
All in all, you just need to play more to get more practice. 
---
That wouldn't be bad, but the issue of things like STBFL and Noed *might* be difficult
---
Can only get better when you play against higher skilled killers. 
---
I do play it's really fun imo
---
