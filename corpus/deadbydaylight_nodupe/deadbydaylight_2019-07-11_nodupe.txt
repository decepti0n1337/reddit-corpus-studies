Mhmmm I think people are really jumping the gun calling his snares worthless
---
---
---
My man, don't let your anxiety win, fight that bitch, use your cosmetics.
---

---
You like them, you paid for them, IDC if you go down in the first minute an suicide on hook, show them digs mate!
---
So until Freddy hits someone he's just a M1 Killer? No thanks.
---
My only issue with old freddy is that it felt like nobody played him, I literally never get into games against him and with the rework more people are probably gonna be playing him. It's better than just seeing Billy and Nurse and Spirit over and over
---
Are we really defending D/Cing?
---
#I am you bitch
---
Whoosh. I literately used that same argument as you about Freddy not being stealth with Huntress and you fell for it lmao. I don't care how you put it Freddy is not a stealth killer. If you think so then you should probably write a letter to BHVR cause I'm sure you know a lot more about Freddy's design then they do and I'm sure they would be happy to offer you a job on the balance team.
---
It uses your charge according to how long you were channeling it, with a minimum of about 25% of your charge, it seems.
---
Nope, everyone needs to cleanse totems to show the entity they can't decorate worth shit.
---
Her outfit is badass!
---
Do we
---
Repost
---
Yup üò•
---
I mean, she's the perfect survivor, she is thicc but not so much like jane, she's has the best face in game, she has physics too, she is not quiet but is not fucking loud like jane, she's is our queen, she is a country singer and the most important thing, she is badass as hell, praise kate denson the queen
---
Its so long because one: Its passive and he has to do nothing. Plague timer is about 30 seconds when she does nothing, Deep Wounds is 20. Hits also have it happen immdnetly. 
---
Two: The Dressers can give him away anyway. So can Trapper Traps, Jigsaw boxes, fountains, Myers tier up music, any killer with a debuff on the status screen, Billy and LF with their loud chainsaws. 
---
Freddy isn't a stealth killer anymore.
---
Ok man, think what you want. It seems to me like you're going out of your way to try to be dismissive of his snares without giving adequate time to practice and figure how you can effectively use them.
---
Ikr, such a queen
---
Idk every time I play I get more heated over my idiotic teammates than the killer. I mean you shouldn't bitch at the killer for killing lol
---
I'm not speaking for all survivors you derp. I'm talking about my own group. I understand that not everyone on either side is exactly the same.
---
Treasure Hunting gang roll up
---
Also don't care about the survivors if you're the killer or even if you're solo, I edited the comment a lot (lol) but you're playing for your enjoyment. I'm not saying to be a complete dick about it but my general rule is to give what you get. If its an even game then I definitely try my best to win or escape, if I stomp the survivors then I might start to ease up, but you're job is the escape or kill so you gotta do what you gotta do.
---
damn that sounds awful. well i'll bet you know to try reinstalling/verifying/ installing on a different drive. I wish you luck in the issue not persisting
---
He is invisble up to 32 meters where he still has a complety normal TR. From everything ive seen, you barely even notice his stealth at all in any game because the ranges of it suck for it to be useful.
---
I do see myself liking new Freddy, but I‚Äôm really gonna miss old Freddy. Part of the reason why I liked old Freddy was because he was a perfect stealth killer to me. They essentially changed everything I like about Freddy, but I do like new Freddy. Guess I‚Äôll have to find a different stealth killer to play.
---
I kinda feel that you lost some credibility on that obsession D-strike comment. The obsession can no longer just use DS you have got to be tunneling off hook for that to happen.
---
Also guesses are not mind-games but luck based.(Some seem to like that only when it benefits a certain side) Also with every update the totem placement change as well. So unless you bring maps or use small game(which is at best an okay perk.)
---
As I said before I want counter-play not nerfs.
---
Broke: 2blink nurse
---
Woke: 1blink nurse
---
Bespoke: noblink spirit fury nurse.
---
Bateman, the Psycho, coming this fall to Dead by Daylight.  
---
His power is called Ambiguity. When playing as the Psycho, survivors aren't sure whether or not you actually killed anyone, and everyone will be at each other's necks disagreeing about what parts of the trial really happened and which ones were just made up in your head.
---
is this a sc from the mobile version?
---
He just means triggered while Freddy's not around I imagine
---
[removed]
---
Mount Ormand resort with the basement in the main building?
---
look at it this way; since his new power is actually fairly decent it'll take you less time to get the hang of it than the original.
---
They put a fair amount of effort into reworking Wraith (not as good as Billy or Nurse but imo he‚Äôs better than before) &amp; Freddy so they deserve praise for that, albeit BHVR took 1-2ish years to release both.
---
No but you are injured the whole game and cant heal
---
I just had a thought while I was reading this. Imagine STBFL on Freddy. Everybody's asleep all the time, especially when they're clumped up.
---
I dont main them either, for many reasons. I play them yes but i pefer to murder everyone in my path.
---
Which will still cause you to scream and reveal your location to him.
---
Then what's the point of this perk lol
---
I think they mean that if you have a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù SWF and a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù killer, the SWF will always win &amp; escape.
---
Some perks benefit from being injured so maybe having it active kicks in the other perks
---
‚ÄúHEY BOIS, ITS A WRAITH!‚Äù
---
Is this outfit matching with Kate? Because it looks that way to me. ‚ô•
---
That‚Äôs when you bring the noed, blood warden, mori triple threat
---
Na i think Myers with tombstone works better, it's awesome!
---
Billy that needs Ruin is usually a bad Billy.
---
I love it! How are you able to see these outfits?
---
I'm not nea but I'm in this post and I dont like it
---
Same
---
Thanks! I'm looking forward for the midchapter
---
Then african americans should probably stop wearing Tshirts, baseball caps, cargo shorts, etc.  
---
  
---
Nobody is saying "this is african american culture".  It's something imitating it because they like the style.  That should be taken as a sign of admiration or respect.
---
A true gentleman
---
Is the 3.0 leaked dev build, my friend copied the ptb 3.1 outfits to the dev build so well be able to look at the cosmetics in depth
---
At least it was you spanning next to it and not a surv
---
3.8 Roentgen... Not great, not terrible.
---
Hey, I'm minding the gold perk, why is it gold?
---
You knew this was coming, pete!
---
Don't feel too bad man I'm mildly autistic.
---
I won't see it even if I wasn't looking for it
---
You really gonna sit here and say the majority of the community are killer mains????? Lmao
---
Good work, fellow pig
---
Two power squats and a point emote final offer
---
Honestly why don‚Äôt we have Shia Lebeouf as a killer already
---
At higher levels it‚Äôs muffled, but it‚Äôs mainly a perk that provides unlimited recoveries from dying. Most people use it with tenacity to recover faster while moving, or dead hard so they can dodge when they need to.
---
yes
---
So guys
---
it was perfect. I just waked around and looked at them and they looked at me and looked down
---
The only two reasons I could think is because he knows people can be dumb and still try to save, so he‚Äôs been on a spree of free kills lately and you just happened to be the one he camps, or if you were playing one of the first four survivors, leather face unlocks a head cosmetic once he kills enough of each, so if you were playing as one(Jake, Claudette, Meg, or Dwight) he may have just wanted to get the cosmetic and needed to sacrifice you for it.
---
But he IS a bear...
---
Everytime I see a survivor who teabags a newbie killer or blinded killer, I simply sandbag them.
---
It keeps getting worse too. I want Ghostface but I'm not even done leveling up the Spirit, and I haven't even started leveling the Plague. It'd be nice to be able to enjoy the DLC I bought within like a few hours of purchasing it...
---
You'll make it cupcake
---
It's crazy how when survivors lose the power role and the killer is actually scary that survivor players cry, but when every single game balance is catering to them and the idea of the game where you are supposed to be scared of the killer finding you is thrown out of the window it's all good...
---
There's a reason she's my main! üôÇ
---
Spirit's super strong. Plague can be strong but has a fundamental design issue that can't really be solved cleanly (maybe give corrupt purge after a minute of all survivors being sick, that'd be huge, or at least some sort of debuff for having all survivors sick at the same time, like Freddy's old 50% debuff). Ghostface is arguably the strongest stealth killer in the game (but is lacking on big maps). Legion...yeah Legion is dumpster tier honestly.
---
The issue isn't that they're afraid to make strong killers. They would've nerfed Nurse and Spirit into the ground by now if that was the case. The issue is that the map design is so bad and has been bad for years now. Look at Asylum, look at Haddonfield, look at Torment Creek/Rancid Abattoir, look at Ormond, look at new Badham...the list goes on and on.
---
Fix the maps and you'll fix DbD.
---
Known bug and of course it's getting bigger now. Killers are exploiting it hard
---
Yup. Fun and pretty strong.
---
He‚Äôa chasing you, you‚Äôve vaulted into a snare
---
He gains bloodlust and breaks into a sprint!
---
He‚Äôs gaining on you!
---
F R E D D Y  G O T  B U F F E D
---
Leave the ugly representation alone
---
This hurts me.
---
I‚Äôll play a few games as a killer I enjoy/have with some BP offerings and save up 1M before I buy the next killer. This usually results in me having decent things to play with right away. But yeah, I know the struggle. Especially with there being sooooo many killer perks, half of which are garbage, it sucks a lot.
---
and?
---
Glad I‚Äôm not the only one, hopefully it‚Äôs fixed soon.
---
this aroused me way more than I wish it did...
---
Pallets are reliant on survivors falling for them. Thats the reason. Dream snares allow freddy to do everything clown can without the slow or need to reload, this includes shutting down all pallet loops and forceing insta drops as well as Fing up jungle gyms. Pallets are stronger when they work but otherwise they are not nearly as reliable.
---
Look at the diagram but in reverse. I didn't know how often I would mind game myself at large loops until he pointed it out
---
I mean, the killer already knows he's camping you. You're not really giving him information other than that you're trying to give your  teammates information. He can't know what they'll do with it any more than you do. With any luck, he'll decide that nobody is coming and leave the hook. Spoilers: this isn't gonna happen, but that's like the only thing he can do with that information.  
---
Also the times you're being camped are much less frequent than the times the killer immediately leaves, so it's more efficient overall to make the passive option the more commonplace situation.
---
I don't mind Legion. His power plus Thanatophobia can be great for stalling out gen progress since every survivor is either mending or healing to stop the repair penalty. Not A rank, but he can be fun.
---
Huntress Vs Doctor at arm wrestling, who wins and why??
---
Yup survivors don't acknowledge how long it takes to frame a lobby, just to get gen rushed, blinded, looped and T-bagged, that is until they get NOED.
---
Then they cry like babies.
---
People just want to separate the community further just to make old stale memes and farm karma.
---
I give hatch if there were multiple DCs, I had a moment with a survivor (such as getting stuck in a pallet and they let me grab them to get out), if they were noticeably a lower rank than me, or if they got farmed/sandbagged in front of me
---
Ah did they ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù leaked this one too lol
---
I couldn't take a choice so i p3 my meg nea and kate, but with this new outfit i think i am going to play only kate for a whilee
---
What's up with the golden perk?
---
I mean you play a killer who bypasses everything survivors can use to defend themselves against the killer. If you're happy about winning then so be it but don't think you're good.
---
And before you whine that I'm a survivor main I have over 2k hours on killer.
---
fuck the ladies, this is for me
---
Made it a post [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cbooyc/i\_miss\_old\_freddy\_c/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cbooyc/i_miss_old_freddy_c/)
---
Imagine being this upset about somebody watermarking a meme LMFAO
---
Well, they always leak their new outfits with the ptb updates xd, is nothing new
---
It‚Äôs pathetic how weak your comebacks are. Lil creep. Dont you have dudes or trannies to go stare at and fap to? Weird fuck.
---
I just want to confirm if it isnt some BS created by other people
---
You're clearly in the purple ranks then dude, I play solo and am rank 1 every season.  Get your anecdotal bs out of here.
---
You didn't respond to anything in my initial comment to you instead your response went straight to criticism of Freddy's power in a different way, that comes off as dismissive to me.
---
I thought you could only use Moris during BP events
---
Every killer should be able to hit that shift, then it'll be fair.
---
English, do u even?
---
We did it
---
lol, it isnt. The Devs said so, multiple times and it has all the same Sounds/assets
---
My bloody Valentine
---
Ah, okay. Noted
---
He still has teleport, and 2 additional methods (1 passive, one active) to have you in the dream state the way i mentioned it above as well as it being harder to break out. This gives at least a few seconds to remember pallet positions before a chase starts.
---
Uh huh never give up tho even if it‚Äôs a certain death never make it easy for the killer it might even buy you team some time
---
I shouldnt laugh, but its true
---
Yes and No. 
---
You are purposely keeping a survivor inactive and to keep them from playing. At the same time, you are doing the objective. Not effectively doing the objective though, because if the team has brains they will just do gens and escape faster.
---
In the end you are the only person who suffers from camping.
---
It's as if the killer is supposed to have the power role and the second survivors stop being able to loop the killer for 5 gens it's unfair
---
I got rekt by old Freddy so I can‚Äôt wait to be absolutely reemed by the new one.
---
Could you show Claudette‚Äôs and Jane‚Äôs next please? Also how are you accessing them if you don‚Äôt mind me asking üòâ
---
When Thanos drops that sweet cosmic cube
---
This is me alongside my rank 15 friend. In rank 1 though most swf teams are like the above picture
---
YTA. The point is to kill survivors and stop them from doing gens. Not only is it a total dick move, it ruins the experience for everyone.
---
Y'all really proud of your mutilated dicks huh
---
That's why I don't stay around for endgame chat (as either survivor or killer). I don't really care what people have to say, good or bad. Just hope they had a good game and move on.
---
They do it for points. You‚Äôll get used to the killer fucking you in the ass with mori‚Äôs, noed, and tunneling. If you‚Äôre lucky you may get used to being cucked by teammates so they use you as a distraction
---
I really don‚Äôt determine someone‚Äôs skill with what they are wearing. I just assume they have quite a bit of money if I do encounter someone with cosmetics
---
Hey look buddy, I'm an a survivor main. That means I loop killers, not killers like "the nurse‚Äù Because that would imply I haven‚Äôt already disconnected upon hearing the first blink. I loop helpless killers, for instance: how am I going to stop this wraith who‚Äôs just trying his best from hitting me? The answer, use a pallet, and if that don't work... Use more pallet. Take for instance this perfectly structured loop, abused by me, spammed by me, and you best hope... Not used on you.
---
Even if Clown had pinky finger baseline, he'd still be worse than nurse and billy. If people think hillbilly is fine, I'm not sure why clown needs to be so bad.
---
shouldn't the rest of Freddy's body have burn scars as well...?
---
I just changed my steam name to "sorry Im feeding" and learned how to play the game better.  
---
I used to be a stealthy gen rusher, but was useless in a chase.  I decided to just spam games until I learned to loop and how to use a flashlight.  About halfway through my journey I started gaining pips every game and now Im just a better player overall.  I still prefer stealthy, but I can loop for a decent while.  
---
TL;DR: Dont be afraid to derank to learn skills you mightve missed out on.  Youll get better and be able to rank even higher if you learn.
---
Open the door John!
---
wdym rebuild database
---
Boi who said I was using noed
---
I'll look into it; this didn't take too long to make and I had to cut out a bunch of other stuff I wanted to explain
---
But that's... YEARS from now! Probably!
---
The best part is that Mclean posted this meme on twitter
---
Hostage would be not allowing the game to end, that's why the EGC was added, so you don't get trapped for 30+ minutes. 
---
*duh.*
---
BBQ, Ruin, Enduring and Spirit Fury IMO.
---
this allows you to get some teleport snipes after hooking and lets you force/waste all pallets to use fake ones
---
I think a Marlin Brando outfit for Freddy would be cool.
---
Uhm you say duh... but he glitched it so the entity couldn‚Äôt kill me. Read it before you get cocky??
---
There's a trap in front of the locker (for those who didnt see the dark trap)
---
Link?
---
Would upvote if it wasn't an old ass repost
---
Changing to a flashlight isn't my favorite thing as killer, but when I see someone enter a lobby already holding a flashlight I exhale a little bit.  
---
I just wonder about the poor souls who have already been tortured with the same flashlight, possibly minutes beforehand
---
pardon me sir are you having a stroke?
---
That's true, I used to be better about always having some BP saved up but unfortunately a few months ago I started working a lot more and don't have as many opportunities for extended gaming sessions anymore.
---
no way lmfao
---
I got my rank 1 for the first time as old freddy, not a freddy main in any way but i was bored and decided to make it memorable. I love new freddy but a ultra rare where you could play old freddy would be nice
---
I had to do that for every single fucking perk on David because it would not give me any better version of WGLF
---
I'm inside of you bitch
---
Also i just noticed my title, i dont even play Nea, im a kate main ffs
---
Wait so I am not gonna be able to hear over her humming again?
---
Love bloodwarden. Was getting bullied. Tbagged and flashlight stunned all game. I think this was my very first hook.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MAAdxQLA-PQ
---
Why teabag 1dc and 2 kills ya big dummy survivor
---
You can crawl through the killer when downed, you legit have no collision with them in that situation, so...
---

---
Nowhere left to loop at and teammates where doing absolutely nothing, which was annoying for rank 2‚Äôs. I knew I lost the chase so I figured I‚Äôd go out with some respect to the killer.
---
https://twitter.com/DeadByDaylight_/status/744196616043790337?s=20
---
Lmao, r/amitheasshole
---
please tell me your joking? please? DS was NOT weak perk as its been proven multiple times it was a OP perk, name some perks better than old DS and ill start listening. 
---
Also if you think killer is easy you haven't gotten above rank 15.
---
Oh shid thanks
---
APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE FOREHEAD!
---
You must not have a lot of play time in this game hahahahaha you have garbage opinions
---
As a killer main I always imagined it as the second. 
---
‚ÄúHey I‚Äôm by X location‚Äù ‚Äúhe downed me nearest hook is behind him‚Äù ‚Äúok he‚Äôs picking me up go for flashlight‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs not some super strategic planning. Simple fact is the game is built for the four survivors to each do their own thing, two of them should survive as long as everyone is contributing. Once you add in even a little communication the balance starts tipping heavily in favor of the survivors
---
This makes me think we won't get a Summer event :/
---
Looks like a Summer billy and it's just going into the store?...
---
Would be super disappointing to skip summer bbq this year.
---
no
---
Say if someone‚Äôs wearing bright colored cosmetics that look nice but stand out, the killer might think they don‚Äôt want to be stealthy and want to be chased
---
...2020
---
I am pretty sure the survivor getting camped also suffers.
---
The best part about playing Freddy was how much red ranks underestimated him
---
I‚Äôm really gonna miss his old play style as a p3 Freddy
---
Why would I do that? I do not  use the nice  flashy cosmetics, because I want to look invisible - a Claudette wearing a  completely brown outfit.
---
Huntress, because shes a loyal milk drinker
---
WHY DOES POST GAME CHAT DISAPPEAR WHEN THE KILLER LEAVES? IF I HAVE A GOOD GAME AND WANT TO THANK THE SURVIVOR WHO SAVED MY SORRY ASS, I CAN'T BECAUSE THE KILLER COULDN'T WAIT 10 SECONDS FOR ME TO SEND MY THANK YOU!
---
Srry it's too late and my friend can't play right now to show u these , he get them because he has the dev build in another folder and he copied the outfits from the 3.1 (actual ptb) and place them in the folder of the dev build so we could see in depth the new skins and trying to combinate them
---
While the difference between the Dream and Normal world isn‚Äôt as jarring I‚Äôd argue new Freddy is just as if not more true to the spirit of the character as old Freddy.
---
Old Freddy didn‚Äôt really have any control over the dream world, new Freddy does though and plays very much like a trickster. Fake pallets and weird blood pools seems very Freddy esque imo.
---
It's not a scam. Someone else saw this and ended up making a fake listing for it, yes, but this post is innocent and some garbage person saw the popularity of this post and made a fake listing.
---
They said sometime in summer, seasons are each 12 weeks. We are not even 3 weeks into summer yet so sometime in the next 9 weeks.
---
Old Freddy needed the boot. How is having to wait 7 seconds to interact with survivors a good idea, especially given how easy it was to wake up?
---
Wraith main for life
---
Don't think that's a good idea , maybe for survivors 
---
But your gonna have to learn the majority of the game through reading or playing anyway.
---
fuck that's hot man
---
His base kit just automatically made him weaker than any other killer is the problem. All other killers were able to at LEAST be M1 killers, Freddy had to tag you, wait up to 7 seconds, and then hit you. While any other killer could just M1 hit a survivor. 
---
That wait period between hits allowed for so many bullying opportunities, and gave survivors a good chance to lead you straight to a loop. Old Freddy's kit was just not suitable for the game when facing people who knew what they were doing.
---
Should have given fake pallets to doctor but other than that I like the new Freddy.
---
Being ‚Äúfixed‚Äù was making him easier to detect instead of changing the underlying mechanics of it to be better for both sides.  His stalk addons were nerfed as well, which is the core of what makes him effective so it‚Äôs an important nerf.
---
Did anyone else see the Myers
---
Haven't tried the PTB yet. Are the Snares really that bad?
---
Again no one fuckin asked
---
"What idiot let Michael get to Tier t- OH FUCK"
---
That's okay! No worries.
---
shit, i've watched so much Puppers and Monto recently that I just assumed the bottom pic was them
---
That only makes him good against bad survivors. Wasting time doesn't mean anything if you can't secure a kill during that time, and that's really hard on Freddy if the survivors know what they're doing since pre-rework he had no way of ending chases
---
I saw a nea get into a locker, instead of yanking her out, I grabbed a nearby trap and reset it in front of the locker.
---
That might have been this guy's first game... Yikes!
---
I'd like that
---
might be, but wanting to be chased doesnt mean you're good, just like being chased
---
Yeah I saw the same thing with someone working on a Pig box, was really confused
---
Hello I'm Jake Park and I'm a fucking retard. AMA.
---
One day us PS4 players will get post-game chat. Probably not.
---
I communicate with my friends a lot because we used to play R6, we made our own callouts (big ass tree with animals hanging off of it, meat room, temple basement) but its still nowhere near us having an actual plan.  In loading screen we're almost silent except for idle chatter, but in game its always us swearing at eachother for bodyblocking or doing something not useful.
---
I don't know she looks fine with makeup
---
Looks cool af to me. Best huntress outfit imo.
---
I'm just confused how the survivor got 21k. I rarely pull that much, even when I'm doing 2+ gens and saving people from hooks. Maybe from hatch escape, but I was just confused
---
I main Freddy but I‚Äôm not going to miss old Freddy at all.
---
New Freddy is an upgrade in almost every way.
---
You're a good man, thank you.
---
I really don‚Äôt have any idea what the licensing agreement is like, but I imagine that a different dream demon might anger some people.  People with much larger pocket books and legal teams than BHVR
---
Because sleeping Survivors had their action speeds halved, their auras revealed, and could only Wake Up by regressing an action or showing Freddy where another awake teammate is.
---
Old Freddy had a lot of issues but he also had quite a few unique and interesting strengths. All of that is being erased when the rework comes out. 
---
I think it's totally understandable that people who put tons of hours into mastering him don't want to lose the character they learned how to play.
---
It‚Äôs as if the survivors should be able to survive if they play well enough, and when the killer is so powerful that there is close to nothing the survivor can do to escape (regardless of how good they are) it‚Äôs unfair.
---
Is there any leaked legion outfits
---
you do understand how fundamentally game-opening it is to communicate all of what you mentioned? like
---
Killer isnt getting any feedback loop of survivor locations. even little shit like "they're on me" is important info, even for the most potato of survivors.
---
He is well worth the purchase, he is my new main.
---
Also imo he is the most fun killer to play.
---
Thanks
---
I wonder if they actually flip flop.
---
Probably not :(
---
Windows of opportunity showed the pallet as being a real pallet for me (till I threw it down and d i e d)
---
No one care
---
Catching people is less about speed and more about anticipating their changes in direction and stuff like that.
---
Ghost Face leaked PTB cosmetics https://imgur.com/gallery/Dm2UmGT
---
They are sadly not hd since I've taken them per Bluetooth from my laptop, but I hope it is good enough to look at without your eyes hurting ;)
---
I only play huntress for dailies or to yeet shit because I'm bored.
---
Just had a game with looooooots of yeets
---
Thanks. :)
---
Just as a note, most uses of the point against a killer are perceived as toxic. Bad survivors have tainted the gesture, along with telling the killer to come here unless you already know you're farming. Best to avoid it if you don't want people to think you're being rude.
---
Unless she means an alternative to dairy milk she is just damaging them bones! 
---
Doc wins all day. 
---
But the real trump card is Hag. She wins every arm wrestling comp ever.
---
But there are other summer skins and i think it's Beach themed.
---
Billy , Trapper , Near , Jane and meg cosmetics. It will probably be similar to hallowed blight/lunar new year.
---
And I'm less than 50% sure that they mentioned it during the stream.
---
How can spirit a killer with her arms chopped carry anyone
---
You have 60 seconds and longer to remember where pallets are and aren't in the current version. Really don't see the point.
---
Thank you for the images
---
Use whatever perks you want. Noed is fine.
---
If everyone in the match cleanses one dull totem, NOED won't activate. Killers don't pull their own weight when it comes to cleaning totems and it's time they start
---
I would have helped out but your on PS4 sorry bud
---
Yeahhh...it's bad

Is he out on console yet?

These are some nice tips. Great job!
---
I knew most of these, but just always panic in a chase, and completely forget how to loop xd
---
No, they won't
---
You're welcome :)
---
That's fair. I think it can still be very useful, but I don't think it's the best perk in the game. It's definitely one of the best, but I think BBQ's gotta be the best one
---
It's always fengs with masks for me. Instant targets.
---
I felt the same way after I mastered using legion. You know by just using the two reduced bleedout timer perks and just relentlessly chasing. Lol get ez'd
---
They're gonna do it no matter what, what does you being toxic back accomplish?
---
Hell no.
---
At the very least I would try to die away from the basement. I'd even crawl away if the killer slug me, hatch or no, I'd try my best to make sure they can't hook me.
---
Oh snap, didn‚Äôt know you played dbd! Knew I recognized you from somewhere sand it was YouTube!
---
Never called Freddy a crutch kiddo, you should swing by your 1st grade teacher to brush up on your reading. 
---
I‚Äôll have to try my drugs individually to figure out which one it is, but I‚Äôll keep you updated.
---
Dream transition mindgames budy.
---
If I'm the last survivor at the exit gate and the killer is near I sometimes just stay so the killer can hit me again and get a few more bloodpoint
---
Thanks for the info :)
---
I love the moment they start to breathe just so they can start screaming again
---
Online hanging out in green and yellow. It gets predictable higher than that.
---
yea, not his best
---
They actually suffer consequences for their actions. If they are going to do it no matter what then so can I.
---
I used to do One Punch Freddy with Save The Best For Last, Play With Your Food, Monitor and Abuse, and Rancor.
---
Ignore the obsession entire match for STBFL and PWYF, one hit mori at the end. No Mettle Of Man, Dead Hard, Decisive, Deliverance, or buddies with Borrowed Time. You go from Hero to Absolute Zero in one attack after Freddy zips around from PWYF Machine Gunning people down super duper fast from max STBFL tokens.
---
You know it doesn't have to be dream themed, right? There are three different killers that all have traps that are all themed differently, but if Behavior wanted to, they could all do the same exact thing as far as gameplay. They could very easily have the same gameplay packaged differently. Or better, they could've kept the old one and made a new killer with the rework ideas, so the game could still have the old mechanics and character.

getting a 4k as a killer doesnt mean there op

Yeah, she's not

I just wish that there was someway to know how many totems are left. Like some sort of indicator saying ‚Äúblank totems are left‚Äù

"I offer you friendship and you spat in my face"

---
youre right she's not, she is very good however.

I think this is more how it goes:

*Playing 4 man swf*
---
Hear laughing on discord. 
---
The game piece shows up on the offering screen
---
"Who the hell"
---
"It was X"
---
"Everyone lead the killer to X"
---
Or
---
*load onto map*
---
"Shiiiit, I forgot to bring in an item/I forgot to change my perks"
---
When I play with friends it's all jokes or meme builds.
---
It‚Äôd be way better if someone edited Myers into the bottom pic
---
kinda a repost on the most popular thing on this sub rn
---
I rarely see them and when I do, most aren't toxic
---
Actually I have yet to see survivors complaining about the rework.
---
I‚Äôm not understanding where all these posts of survivors wanting Freddy nerfed took the info from.
---
Maybe Maybe Maybe
---
Myers is my most played killer- I‚Äôve got him to P3-50 and beyond. Whenever I get a Lery‚Äôs in the bloodweb, I slap on SM and my go to build. And it‚Äôs a fun as fuck time.
---
However, I‚Äôd never played AGAINST it until a few weeks ago. Fuck me I haven‚Äôt been so paranoid to walk around corners before in my life. God bless this addon, from both a killer and survivor perspective.
---
Which works for exactly 1 hit
---
As far as I know this error code *typically* shows up when there's a problem with EAC (EasyAntiCheat) and some aspect of your computer's online connectivity. The only thing I can think of right now is verifying the integrity of the game files or restarting steam/pc. Also, depending on the circumstances the devs may not be at fault here, no need to complain about them when they may not even be at fault. Hope this helps somewhat.
---
SAME HERE! PING LOOKS GOOD IN THE LOBBY THEN WHAT DO YA KNOW, INSTA LAG AND A SHITTY MATCH THE REST OF THE GAME. HAD A FUCKING GF LAG SWITCHING THE OTHER DAY ON PS4, WE ALL KNEW IT BECAUSE IT WOULD ONLY START WHEN SOMEONE WAS IN A CHASE WITH HIM AND HE DID IT SO MUCH THAT HE LAGGED THE GAME OUT! 
---
GOOD GOING DICK FACE! YOU WERE SHIT AND  COULD ONLY GET SOMEONE WITH YOUR LAG SWITCH AND YOUR A RANK 5! FYI WHEN YOU FACE CAMP DONT LUNG TO HIT THE UNHOOKER, GRAB THEM! YOU ARE THE WORST PLAYER IN THE WHOLE DBD UNIVERSE!
---
What I do is save my Shards to buy a new killer and then if something good comes up, I'll grab it. Try working on buying the Clown, all of his perks are good and you get another killer to play.
---
Use one blink to get the feel for their dodge, prepare for it on the next blink
---
Not every killer needs to be strong. Like I said, wraith is weak, but still enjoyable. Everyone loves a good bing bong every now and then. Otzdarva even made a video recently about how the old Freddy isn't bad at all. He has several builds showcasing the character's capabilities.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The dream transition also enables you to change targets and waste time, especially with monitor and abuse.
---
Lmfao had my volume way too loud for this one holy damn LOL
---
Ah I just realized he‚Äôs on Xbox idk if he can do that
---
You're going to have to add more details if you want help. Also, maybe try posting this on the steam forums where there is a much better chance of you getting the help you need and contact support.
---
Sucks to suck I guess
---
Mid tier.
---
Against rank 5+ survivors they just break you out of stalk and he becomes an M1 killer
---
Agreed. As a former Doctor main Freddy felt like a doctor sidegrade to me. Good tracking, good stall, and just like Doc you were encouraged to change targets often even if it was only to zap/sleep someone and look for other survivors and waste survivor's time snapping out of it/waking up.
---
She is OP when the killer mastered her. But that happens with every single killer in the game.
---
Sucks to suck üòÇüòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠üò≠ broken hit boxes and I get punished with a hostage game get fucked
---
thumbs up and finger guns
---
By basing your opinion on facts instead of feelings.
---
Hi,
---
How do you start the game ? (Through steam or shortcut ?)
---
Is your steam up to date ?
---
Is the issue occured on steam scheduled maintenances ? (Tuesday mainly)
---
So, being able to instantly teleport to a survivor isn't op? Mind = blown.
---
You shouldn't get rewarded for being hooked more than you already do (SWFs being able to coordinate from the hook without Kindred or Bond; hooks should come with built-in aura blindness or something).
---
It takes awhile for a survivor to fall asleep, and Freddy's reward for chasing them and downing them and hooking them is... A complete negation of his mechanic including the teleport cooldown and any addons?
---

---
Gonna add the fact that with randoms it‚Äôs almost impossible to get all the totems without dying.
---
Pls bhrv give us solo players a totem counter :(
---
It‚Äôs aura blocking, and it‚Äôs an old bug that‚Äôs managed to resurface.
---
Like... if you're going to do that, at least make sure you're positioned so that if you get hit you fall into the exit.
---
Imagine caring about someone reposting a bad meme.
---
Unless you use freddys aura reading to fuck off, apply pressure to other survivors and do it again to down them. I run clourophobia in order to prevent them healing to full before second hit.
---
I realize that. But this is a licensed character. Licensed characters had predetermined rules due to their lore. Freddy literally CANNOT hurt you when you‚Äôre not asleep. That‚Äôs the entire point to who he is. But yes again I hate the un-unique hybrid they turned him into.
---
Yea rank 1 players already know most pallets so they should do pretty well. I barely know how to loop :P
---
Calm down lol
---
Lol
---
FUCKEM, THOSE ASSHOLES WOULD CRY NO MATTER HOW FREDDY GETS WORKED, THEY ARE LIKE THE 3 BEARS AND NOTHING WILL APPEASE THEM!
---
You mentioned the small terror radius. If you combine Red Paint Brush with Monitor &amp; Abuse, you get 0 terror radius in the dream world when not in a chase, which was one of the funniest builds to run with thickest mist or Lery's. You could just run up to a survivor and whack 'em.
---
Bro he has a perk that prevents people from failing skill checks to wake up. People can't wake each other up if either are injured. Getting picked up from down state doesn't wake you. And having others wake you up gets worse as it goes on. AFAIK you only get one box to wake yourself up as well.
---
It's not hard to keep people in the dream world. But his map presence is so strong in the beginning that a good Freddy will likely only have one or two people left by the time people can escape.
---
And plenty of killers struggle to get the final kill as is. Sure you can outplay his powers. That applies to everyone.
---
Like sure he's not as good as nurse or spirit. But he's deff better than most killers. Him being bad at the end isn't a big deal when he's good most of the game. There are only a few killers that are even good at that point and said killers are basically good all the time.
---
I get that you're trying to say that he's not op or anything and that's fine. But I think your under selling him for whatever weird reason.
---
The PTB has tried to bridge the gap between killer and survivor bloodpoints. Certain survivor actions, such as cleansing totems, bow give more BP allowing survivors to get more BPs for specific categories (up to the typical max of 8k per cat). They have also added some more things for killers also
---
Or easily countered by the meta becoming do a movement easy to do 3rd person but not 1st when you see someone.
---
Thank you just loaded this build against a killer :)
---
I was literally thinking the same thing lol.
---
JK, I will post the pictures when I get home in 2hrs, I still need to do some things \^\^
---
THERE CANADIAN AH!
---
The outfit itself is great. It's the weapon that I have a problem with. They designed this badass goat-woman costume and for a weapon they gave her a fucking stick. Disappointing.
---
Always doing an excelent job Skemooo \^\^
---
You do realize some of the killers are real people...
---
No, I saved it on on purpose. Btw, the game is on mobile. I just wanted to know if I was dumb coz I'm new to the game
---
*I goddamn hate indoor maps*
---
Learned what "safe pallet" means! Thanks for the infographic!
---
They are on the ball recently with GF prior to this.
---
It‚Äôs not really that easy, but you‚Äôre right. Gotta account for the Dwight who decides to thrown down every pallet on the map in the first 2 minutes.
---
He isn't teabagging, he's twerking.
---
AM I THE ONLY SURVIVOR MAIN THAT'S HAPPY FOR A NEW CHALLENGING KILLER TO LEARN HOW TO BEAT?
---
Have perfect memory.
---
#*DEDEDEDEDEDEDEDE DEDE-*
---
Like I said it's all based on how people play the game. If you have idiots that just run in with no regard for a save and you are able to catch everyone easily or people that struggle on their first hook and die faster you're going to have an easy game. What platform are you playing on?
---
This is actually me and it hurts but im open to change and i just have to adapt.
---
I thought Ghostface was from a fictional novel someone wrote
---
New waifu
---
*happy oinks*
---
What‚Äôs looping?
---
He's been out on console for a long time now. The rework however won't be out for like 2 more weeks or so.
---
Yea, because with your 3 second stalk to a 1 hit down (compared to Myers who takes way longer) and your ability to do that an infinite number of times per match (unlike myers who is limited) to any survivor at any time (unlike myers who can only stalk each survivor for a finite amount), you should also be able to stalk openly out in the open without being easily knocked out because you need an even bigger easy mode killer?
---
He's fine as is. Use corners to stalk instead of standing out in the open. It's for balance sake, otherwisr he may as well just be a 1 hit down m1 killer the entire match which would just he stupid.
---
That sucks man I had the same thing happen a while back but I was trapper and I wasn‚Äôt paying attention so I got stuck in my own trap and a survivor showed up and hit me with a pallet so I was stuck all game
---
‚Äúlet me just ghost her hex ruin infront of her and i‚Äôll be-oH FUCK-‚Äú
---
Basically going in circles with the killer, wasting their time.
---
Not sure what you mean, Hag is mostly considered to be a top 5 or so killer.
---
1 win =/= rocksteady proof
---
Same thing happened to me while I was billy
---
Rework is what I was talking about
---
Thanks for the downvote of a simple question folks
---
I always give the last survivor the hatch if there's a disconnect. Just a personal rule.
---
Reworked Springwood is really hard to loop. Can someone give me tips for that? Killers won't destroy the pallet and the obstacles are too small to try to jump on the other side without the killer noticing and going backwards.
---
Yeah, I'm glad I have good trigger safety. I nearly camped a SWF that was actually extremely friendly and just happened to kick my ass, but thought better of it when I realized they weren't teabagging or flashlighting at all.
---
Great guide. Wow. Thank you.
---
adrenaline fully wakes you up is what I'm getting at, and for his power to work you HAVE to be asleep, unless he's running that 1 UR I guess. He virtually loses his entire power at end game, I'm not saying that's good/bad, but just pointing it out that it's funny because originally he had a strong end game at the very least.
---
Or maybe they will realize what they are doing is toxic. Doing nothing just rewards bad behavior and just let's the killer keep being douchbags. If your going around throwing punches then dont get all pissy when someone finally has enough of your shit and gives you a hard one back. Sorry but doing nothing like a pussy never fucking works and it let's evil continue to steamroll good people just because you couldn't have the balls to stand up to it and say enough is enough. If someone does something bad and nobody stops them then they will just keep hammering away because they arent suffering any consequences to their actions.
---
Ah, got it. Cheers.
---
Ok. It's a fact that I miss freddy because he was more interesting than the rework freddy.
---
I dont think freddy needs a nerf. I think survivors need to develop a strategy that isn't built entirely on running to pallets and letting them be their end all, be all. Literally.
---
Why do people hate nurse? Hell why do I hate nurse. She destroys your pallet loop dreams. Why do I hate spirit and some people hate spirit? She's difficult to loop sometimes. But survivors will always complain. Need my pallets after all
---
And that‚Äôs why you body block
---
Playing on ps4, people do stuff like that all the time but then I'll get in a game every so often where theres 3 generators finished and somehow I haven't seen anyone, kinda down to luck I guess.
---
He is fictional.
---
But then again (Devil's Advocate), the timer is sixty whole seconds. There's opportunity there to rarely be in the dreamworld unless Freddy actually hits you.
---
I legit thought you were making a Smash Bros joke.
---
A de-pip series sounds borderline spiteful to opponents, though. Especially when the opponents are Bronze.
---
Am I just supposed to ignore the two people on the same gen? I don't understand what you mean by "exploiting". I am given information and I don't have a choice to accept it or not, I will use the information I am given for my benefit.
---
As a Ghostface main I despise OoO users and tunnel them to death.
---
why use it if they never get all the gens?!
---
Please don‚Äôt make 4 man swf groups even more cancer
---
Hard to say, the Doctor looks like he has been hitting that MILK hard
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhmyO2-tNzE)'s a good example of a build that does well, and some opinions on the overall strength and utility of the killer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OgCvfzNyHc).
---
My point is, for around the same bullying potential as wraith, you can have a much more interesting power mechanic. Really recommend you check out at least one of those videos, they're a good second opinion on the subject.
---
Not should, but can. Play with no respect, get no respect. That's how it is.
---
As an OoO user, I have found that extreme camera control and constant LoS breaking is the best way to deal with Nurses. It always feels really awkward compared to my usual play style, where I usually don‚Äôt give a flying fuck if I‚Äôm seen.
---
Was I saying Freddy is op
---
That would take GF t-bagging to q new level.
---
Probably restart the game?
---
‚ÄúDid you have fun?‚Äù
---
What about almost every match I‚Äôve played
---
Of course you should, most survivors with DS will make sure you eat it at some point even if you're not "tunneling" (which makes the endgame a horrible experience of getting stunned if you haven't chewed through it yet already) and borrowed time giving them two hits isn't any different than chasing the healthy survivor (who also has two hits).
---
If they lead you back to the hook or attempt an unhook before you can break the nearby pallets/generators and leave, then punish it all you want.
---
\&gt; Because you weren't camping, camping is staying in proximity of the survivor just to watch them die for no reason (BBQ&amp;C not proccing anyone or scratchmarks being a reason).
---
\&gt; Because you weren't tunneling. In order to tunnel you have to neglect generators and abandon other chases, returning to the unhook notification because you haven't found anyone yet, or getting led back to the hook, isn't tunneling.
---
Of course there are times it's better to hit and chase the healthy survivor (or down but not pick up the recently unhooked survivor) if you think the 16\~ seconds it takes the injured survivor to get healed when they move to a generator someone is already on is worth not taking another hook state from them, but since getting a survivor killed ASAP is basically the only way for lower-tiered killers to salvage a game...
---

Goodbye, pink haired Fengu. I'll miss seeing that.
---
What outfit is that?
---
Saaaaaame lol
---
They dont want to do any real killers, even if we dont know who they were. Some people feel its a bit disrespectful to the victims is all.
---
dwight main for life
---
Never stated that information wasn't valuable and why SWF is broken in this game when compared to four solo survivors.
---
As someone who has played since the game was released in 2016, I am telling you what I listed is literally the only valuable pieces of information for a competent survivor. I repeat, it seriously does not matter if the killer is coming towards me or is in a chase with another survivor. That includes billy, nurse, and spirit. Hell, with the amount of shitty survivors in high ranks I would prefer if the killer found and chased me.
---
Now, that may be useful to the group of blendettes you play with so they can go hide like the scardettes they are, but that's boring as hell for any veteran of the game.
---
Haven't seen this one in a while
---
Mostly just me and my buddies freaking out when we get spotted, and in lobby we're just talking smack to each other and hoping it's either The Pig, The Plague, or The Clown cause those are our favorites to go against 
---
I love the Pig cause she can get a jump scare outta you
---
Same things been happening to me I even uninstalled and reinstalled same thing still popped up
---
I‚Äôm not gonna argue with a great opinion
---
Well I mean if you've got proof of you 4k'ing every single match as a ghostface, I'll be happy to believe you, maybe not even then since it's only low ranks
---
People are stupid lol
---
That has to be the greatest commentary ever!!
---
yeah no shit sherlock
---
what is this adorable show you keep posting?
---
I just did the same thing to no avail.
---
good call
---
That is THIS UNIVERSE, TEABAGGING IS LITERALLY A HELLO
---
How does decisive even work? I got laurie today and it‚Äôs not triggering
---
So you've just gotta remember. Tricky for sure. So is everyone asleep or how does this work?
---
Hapenning to me currently. Annoying as shit
---
This is an amazing addition to the sub and you deserve a lot of praise for this, good job mate.
---
Again, its what they want and you're giving it to them. You teabagging back is giving them the attention they want. I'm not telling you to be a tool and do nothing because you're powerless, I'm saying to ignore them and move on because they aren't worth your time. But sure, keep contributing to toxicity and being no better than the killer.
---
Why does hillbilly have to be a joke to the devs
---
Damn
---
I‚Äôm shit at survivor and I got some rank 2 freddy on the PTB who was demolishing us while I was 4heading into rocks in chases
---
One of my top 3 favorite upcoming skins. So hyped for Ghostfaces!
---
Most important thing to understand about escaping chases is understanding just how fucking loud you are as a survivor.
---
Daaaaaaaamn üëÖüí¶üí¶üí¶üçë
---
There it is, ya did it. I will now reference this when needed. Thank you.
---
Got it, everybody is shit at the game, even red ranks, knowing where the killer is somehow both doesn't matter, but is also valuable, and the only way veterans can have fun in the game is the way you have fun
---
Then leave and don‚Äôt read end game chat? lol
---
If I was the killer I'd be laughing my ass off

Pig is best killer. You can‚Äôt change my mind

All 2 of the Freddy mains
---
It usually common occurrence to *NOT* glorify a murderer/serial killer.
---
So unless we get "inspired from X" based killer I doubt we'll be seeing any Jack's or Zodiacs running about willy nilly
---
Mao Mao: Heroes of Pure Heart. Good show, created by someone who worked on OK KO lets be heroes.
---
i dont think this is worthy of having lisa rant about it
---
That meg is a spy.
---
Wait the effect of devour hope still continue even if the totem is destroyed?
---
&gt;I'm not telling you to be a tool and do nothing
---
&gt;I'm saying to ignore them and move on because they aren't worth your time.
---
Which one is it
---
Can't you play around that tho? And I mean ig it's ironic.
---
It's funny because you know by the end of the first month he's released he'll be unplayable again. Devs will give Freddy the Freddy treatment
---
I just don't want this game to constantly consolidate odd yet interesting killers into a more easily balanced formula.
---
Maybe add the effect, if you aren‚Äôt already asleep and run thru them, they immediately bring you into the dream world?
---
Fuck that'd be so cool. I imagine being the wraith and seeing one of the phantoms and scaring myself
---
Let the teabagging commence!
---
Is surveillance a good perk to buy,ive just started playing killee and i mainly use huntress and wraith but i barely have any good perks for then since theyre both lvl 5
---
Honestly I think survivors trash talking me in post game chat, but I still find it weird that they think that killers are forced to play so survivors have fun
---
Get downed after being on a hook VERY recently after getting saved
---
You'll be fine. There is a ranking system that should place you with similiar ranked people. It's very pick up and play, but harder to master.  
---
Survivors have to do 5 generators and power up a gate to escape. Though it's useful to sometimes try and save your mates if they're hooked.You can be hooked thrice before you're out of the game. And generally don't try to escape on the hook, unless you have a perk that allows you to get off it instantly. You gain perks and more stuff by leveling up your character. Each survivor act more like skins, but have different starting perks that you can teach to others by leveling them up to atleast level 30.
---
 
---
Killers basically do the opposite. they patrol generators and try to stop the survivors from escaping by killing them. Each killer plays differently and also have different perks they can teach to other killers. 
---
Overall the ranking system is mostly to keep people with good game knowledge and with a  good perks away from people that are new. You might end up against good skilled people and sometimes you don't. Every match is different. But you shouldn't feel like you'll be squashed by experts every game.  
---
Toxicity only really happens in end game chat. You can choose to just leave before they start talking. I personally never really get effected by in game actions like teabagging at the gates or anything. They can be annoying, but that's all part of the game. Both sides try to win by achieving different goals and that can cause some friction.
---
Not every single, almost every
---
It isn‚Äôt even balance. It‚Äôs just clear they didn‚Äôt know what to do. They could have reduced the time to fall asleep like everyone was originally asking for. If anything that 7 seconds WAS what Balanced him. He is seriously Op I. The right hands pre rework. Maybe not top tier but god I ALWAYS double pipped with him. He did not need this ridiculously over complicated overhaul.
---
I think the crows need to be louder. I remember spectating the last survivor in a locker with 3 crows above her head.
---
Noob killer needs to tunnel all 4 of us at the same time!!!
---
Once you encounter SWF teabaggers you will no longer give a fuck about playing what people deem 'fair'.  Survivor rules are made up, they don't need to be followed.
---
&gt; And for shutting down loops, clown is just better.
---
This is a meaningless comparison, Clown can't lay his bottles as traps and clown doesn't have any of Freddy's other abilities.  It would be stupid if Clown was worse at shutting down loops
---
Really? I thought it was any time the killer picked you up. I guess that would‚Äôve been too op
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests 
---
Data sheets show at the highest ranks Self Care is the most used survivor perk.
---
Does an Error Code come up?
---
Facecamping Bubba, and that‚Äôs about it. Every other killer is very fair, takes practice, and people are generally OK with playing against, with the exception of spirit, which some people don‚Äôt like playing against for some reasons.
---
I haven't actually played against either of them yet so I guess I'm lucky.
---
outside of functioning like a regular M1 killer not really. He loses his teleport end game, and his traps only work on sleeping survivors. Old Freddy can at least very easily put survivors back to sleep albeit still not being great.
---
Like I said it's fine overall and I think this Freddy is still better overall.
---
Addons cause the Phantom Wraiths to Decloak near survivors and just vanish. Or cause them to run out from the wraith after you cloak.
---
Have you seen Freddy‚Äôs power in action? All he needs to do is put one down after he breaks it without even slowing down.
---
Hnngh Fuck üòçüòçüëÖüí¶üí¶üí¶üí¶üí¶
---
It used to be that way, until it got nerfed
---
I don‚Äôt wanna sound rude, but the best way to get better is to Git Gud
---
I have played swf before and I can confirm that most of the time we‚Äôre either screaming at each other (in a friendly way mind you) and then sandbagging each other. Much fun!
---
I only said it didn‚Äôt matter if they didn‚Äôt have certain addons or wanting to avoid traps. I just feel that before you wanted to wake up as soon as possible. Now it feels like you can push it off with out too many consequences.
---
I will never say that waking up doesn‚Äôt matter with the new Freddy it just doesn‚Äôt mean as much as it did before.
---
It's been like this since 5 fucking pm üòê
---
Yea I guess. Do crows land on lockers without anyone in them? Anyway now that you can close the hatch dealing with an immersed final survivor isn‚Äôt terrible.
---
Im cum inside you bitch
---
He was always an M1 killer, he is now able to out more pressure. Being in the dream world doesn't allow down survivors anymore which is a shame.
---
Not respecting pallets and destroying them is a way to be better. Also having better perks can help, like enduring. There is also add-ons that you could use to be better and practicing
---
Stop sucking
---
Imagine getting a SCP killer, who would that be?
---
AND I ALSO WANT TO RETAIN THE RIGHT TO COMLLAIN ABOUT FACING THOSE KILLERS ALL THE TIME. NO TAKE, ONLY THROW!
---
Nice this is the hair I was planning on using with it
---
Quick run down of the new way sleep works is, people automatically fall asleep over the course of a minute. So 60 seconds after the match starts everyone will fall asleep. The 2 previous ways to wake up are still options: failing a skill check (now also includes hook sabotage skill checks) and an awake survivor can wake up sleeping ones (though now each consecutive wake up will take 4 seconds longer up to a max of 16 seconds). In addition to those there's now a third way to wake up, when a survivor falls asleep a clock will spawn on a table on the opposite side of the map, if the survivor goes and rips the clock off the table then they'll wake up and get an additional 30 seconds before falling asleep again (so it'll take 90 seconds instead of 60 seconds for 1 cycle). Freddy no longer has a distinct power to pull people into sleep, he can hit anyone at any time, but if he hits an awake survivor it will instantly put them to sleep.
---
You can tell with some of them. When the survivor does a head twitch because they jumped and their mouse hand spazzes, or when they just stand still for a second you can tell the player got spooked.  It warms the cockles of my heart.
---
try to play both sides evenly.
---
It wasn‚Äôt destroyed.
---
The slow vault on snares is nice, but otherwise, yeah they're definitely a lot weaker as far as i can tell
---
It pains me that this is so unlikely to ever actually be added lol
---
This happened to me once on PS4 as well. It‚Äôs terrible having to tap an entire gen, especially in a high pressure situation.
---
I‚Äôll take that score though
---
Wait, 2 totems right next to each other? Thank god only one of those was a hex
---
Never
---
I've been wanting to play survivor a bit lately and this just makes me want to do that more, but I only play killer and I don't want to play survivor since I have almost no levels on any character, and I don't want to play survivor without really good perks, I'm just not confident enough to do that. So I just always play killer.
---
Is that just something that benefits me or does it have some effect I don't know about?
---
The leg wrap acts as a slider for his cheeks
---
Seen nothing from survivors saying he should be nerfed tbh, only seen posts from killers saying this... ü§îü§î
---
I think crows can land on any locker, regardless of if someone‚Äôs in it or not. But crows that make a honking sound and are circling around a space the size of a survivor means that there‚Äôs a camping survivor there.
---
When being chased a fake pallets a fake pallet when the survivor desperately needs it.
---
Fml
---
A perfect serial killer ending
---
Thats tough. Guess I‚Äôll use a different perk lol
---
Honestly, just play to have fun.  Don't let anyone tell you what you should or shouldn't do.   I agree with the other reply that says play both sides too.  You will get a better idea of what kind of playstyle you enjoy by just playing the game.
---
It was dimmed so I thought it was destroyed
---
The games meant to be played so both sides have an enjoyable experience not just the killer or the survivors. Some killers think they are entitled to having more fun and enjoyment than survivors and most survivors are the same way.
---
A not safe pallet would be one in the rooms of the hospital
---
Nea is bae
---
Red ranks are the toxic tryhards of the community, it‚Äôs the main reason I won‚Äôt play past purple ranks. Most are ignorant and self entitled
---
Finally a good ace skin that doesnt make him look like a guy who works at a candy store
---
I dont use it as much as I used to, but it comes in handy against killers tunneling / camping . Especially towards end of the game
---
I have no idea lol
---
Sorry to say but it seems you've been banned....... nah I'm just joking. Got no clue as to why because I'm stuck at work. XD
---
That kind happen to me with 3 new players last month
---
New killer - the Unabomber. Blowing up a gen immediately puts the survivor into dying state
---
Jokes aside come on, there is no way they would take a real life serial killer and glorify them by them having people play as them.
---
Sure, there's plenty of the 3d models already hovering around out there. It'll be a matter of time before the Wasteland skin is ripped too. My usual haunt is to search for XPS format models, and import them into Blender with an XPS tool.
---
Do you play on console? What is your highest rank?
---
I always get salty DMs.
---
Tbh after the rework is the best hair for meg and the p3 too
---
This skin is fuckin hilarious, instant buy and I don‚Äôt even play Hillbilly
---
as I said, lower ranks
---
HOW TF DO I FIGHT BACK AGAINST THE SPIRIT? IVE FOUGHT FOUR IN A ROW AND COULDNT DO JACKSHIT IN A BARREL
---
Except it's a lot harder to bully a wraith because he doesn't need to wair any amount of time to pull you off of a gen, a hook, or just hit you. Wraith's power at least didn't actively hender him.
---
For most people, yes. It'd be cool to see some sort of speech-to-text system integrated.
---
This is why I kinda like purple ranks. People seem more chill there, rather than the sweaty style in reds.
---
Instead of running away you're challenging me?
---
Imagine walking around with this on lmao.
---
Well thats a fair point but, It shouldnt be so widespread that killers or survivors cant play the way they want to play, It's just a video game after all.
---
Opdor
---
They changed it into an anti-tunneling perk, so it now activates after you've been unhooked.
---
It's beautifully horrible
---
I'll never understand  why people do that.
---
litterally rank 7 vs rank 20
---
It will help you learn what the other player may be thinking. As a killer, you'll learn how to avoid survivors looping an area of the map over and over by changing your course/swinging your weapon at the right time, but as a survivor, you'll know more about what the killer's goals are and when to throw pallets and such.
---
Me:
---
"Get out of the exit gate."
---
"Stop self caring in the exit gate when literally everyone can survive if you just don't stand in the gate."
---
"GET OUT OF THE FUCKING EXIT GATE AND HELP THE TEAM."
---
Swf:
---
"Oh the killer's here now, I had no choice, now I have to leave everyone!"
---
\*Tier 3 sounds\*
---
Where can you find them? Any specific site?
---
I too don't see the Killer's red light on the S7. The devs on twitter mentioned they're still working on optimizing the game across the various devices, so maybe we'll get some improvements.  Or I'll just have to get myself a new phone lol
---
Lmao. That sure helps them.
---
I will gladly sacrifice myself for a baby Dwight.
---
I was gonna be irritated that they were discouraging a new player but then I saw their flair hehe
---
Don‚Äôt respond to people who call ‚ÄúToXiC‚Äù it‚Äôs a waste of time

Pro tip: detectives hunch is a perfect counter to NOED dull totems.

That makes sense. I've never looked at it that way.

Look at those swole calves. So worth it.
---
Why does it feel like almost every Kate skin makes her look like the protagonist of an Urban Fantasy novel?
---
Ham bat from don't starve
---
Sometimes if you‚Äôre really having a hard time catching a particular survivor let them go. They‚Äôre just wasting your time so their team mates can get a lot of stuff done while you‚Äôre fruitlessly chasing their buddy.
---
Lol, thats funny. Bl tho.
---
*cleanses ruin*
---
*cleanses devour hope literally right beside ruin*
---
Ggez

Or escaped chase.
---
She exists now, only in my memory.
---
They need to change the base mechanics of detection entirely to fix it correctly to be fair for everyone, not just make it easier for survivors to detect him while ghostface still can‚Äôt stalk people through grass or disjointed hitboxes even though he can see them.
---
new killer leak
---
inaccurate. Megs never hit skill checks
---
Did you seriously just fucking say that you don't see anyone asking to fix or balance SWF?
---
I do mention that
---
I personally learned how frustrating it can be as a killer when survivors are running all over you during the match and then make fun afterwards in the post-game chat (EZ, get gud, etc). I always say "GG" now and try to give them some slack, especially if they don't seem very skilled using their killer power. Just gives empathy and perspective.
---
Ggs, my dude!
---
Nurse or spirit
---
That's one of the best parts for me because I always shut them down and they don't know what to say.
---
Wait what? Whats the outline? Also are lockers sounds fixed? I swear im super easy to hear in them still.
---
Me: ‚ÄúGuys, he‚Äôs chasing me again! You better be doing gens!‚Äù *gets caught and hooked*
---
Friend 1: ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs gonna go get her?‚Äù
---
*5 minutes later*
---
Friend 2: ‚ÄúI thought you were gonna get her! Goddamn it!‚Äù
---
hag's the one that gets me. I can't do jump scares
---
Not sure why you‚Äôre being downvotes because this is true. If I know a killer is chasing someone, that means I‚Äôm free to do gens with zero precautions, run around, use sprint burst up, etc. It‚Äôs a distinct advantage.
---
In terms of hooks tho, I‚Äôve always kinda thought Kindred should just be built in and balanced around tbh.
---
Ha, I didn't even look at that.
---
Wake up.  Find pallets, remember them.  When running away in Dream State, don't trust any new pallets.  The only unknown then becomes if Freddy forced another surv to throw down a pallet elsewhere and you later try to use it, akin to mindgames.  Seems fine, people are just kneejerk reacting like they did with original Freddy.
---
Things you should avoid are ragequitting, disconnecting (Doing it for IRL reasons are fine but not because you don't want to fight a certain killer, etc.) calling people slurs, exploiting bugs, etc. 
---
Don't go out of your way to be a dick towards either side (I.E. teabagging and flashlight blinding on every single pallet then gloating in post game chat how much of a "EZ baby killer" the killer is as survivor, or facecamping everyone hitting them on the hook as killer.)
---
Don't screw over teammates as survivor. I.E. don't fast-vault with shift (it gives the killer a noise notification) while another survivor is working on a generator so the killer goes over there, etc.
---
Really just don't be shitter and you should be good. As long as you're not going out your way to be toxic and working with your teammates you'll be fine.
---
Bless this ma
---
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO RAGE AT GARBAGE PATCHES TO LET THE KNOW THAT THEY ARE GARBAGE SO THEY CAN IMPROVE THEM AND NOT MAKE THEM AS GARBAGE IN FUTURE UPDATES, WE WHINE WITH REASON.
---
Yeah those are unsafe pallets. You never wanna be caught going back and forth on them; you only ever wanna use "EXTREMELY unsafe" pallets as bloodlust cancellers by stunning (cause killers won't break them) or when going from a straight line from another area to another with it being right in the middle and forcing the killer to give up a little distance by going around it
---
Killer Q is always unbearably long anyways. Literally too many killer mains that I'm always forced to play the shitfest that is solo surv.
---
They can do with forcing some of these killer mains to play the other side.
---
Oh yeah I've seen a ton of that, I usually just walk away and explore the map until they decide to escape.
---
I don‚Äôt get it. Meg‚Äôs can‚Äôt hit skill checks.
---
Oh I can make a great guide for optimal SWF play, this isn't even close
---
Everything from how to truly counter NOED without wasting time on totems to planned downs and proc'ing anti-pressure by baiting killer away from an unbreakable survivor or forcing grabs for DS
---
Should have been the Pirates Who Don't Do Anything :/
---
They need to rework the entire totem mechanic.
---
IF YOU WERE NOT ONLINE FOR OVER 1 MONTH WHY DO YOU CARE ABOUT A 2.5 WEEK BAN. AND MY GUESS WOULD ALSO BE THAT IN TIMES WAY BEFORE THAT YOU MAY HAVE GOTTEN REPORTED AND THAT IS WHY A BAN WAS FINALLY ISSUED.
---
About tree fiddy
---
PLEASE NO
---
Eh you don't always wanna escape a chase
---
They almost always end with getting hook- it's just a matter of how long you can make the chase go on for. You also don't want to spend every damn pallet on the map, especially the "easy to see" ones. You need to keep some up in all areas so the next survivor has something to work with.
---
Oh definitely, but we've seen it all with him. When he was to easy, when he was to hard, now he's just eh. Hopefully they fix it but they should focus more on some other killers before they go recoding Ghostface. 
---
Legion rework, pig buffs? Things like that, right now Ghostface is quite capable and sits peacefully at mid tier,possibly on the higher side of it if the game decides it. And is fine if they divert their attention onto others for the time being
---
Not all of us red ranks are like that. I'm sorry that happened.
---
HEAD ON BEING ABLE TO INFINITELY STUN THE KILLER IN THE PTB DEFINITELY SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED/GOTTEN PAST THE QA TEAM.
---
I fucking hate people like that and go out of my way to fuck them over as killer, which I guess is kind of hypocritical, but they had it coming. Is facecamping when the killer just guards someone on a hook until they die?
---
What are dedicated servers?
---
Yeah I get fucked by the one pallet next to the gurny (gourney?) in the crossroads sections of the hallways, where there's literally a fucking door right around the pallet next to it.
---
ENDURING NOW ACTUALLY HAS A LONGER STUN THAT IN DID IN THE PREVIOUS PATCH EVEN THOUGH THE DEVS SAID IT WOULD BE A BUFF TO PALLET STUNS MAKING THEM 1 SECOND BUT NOW THEY ARE 1.2 SECONDS INSTEAD OF LAST PATCH AT 1.1 SECONDS
---
Day 1 buy for me.
---
HillBilly is the redheaded stepchild of the original 3 killers. While Trapper and Wraith keep getting great outfits one after another, HillBilly outfits are nothing to talk about.
---
Are people already complaining about Freddy being too strong? Do people never learn?
---
*sprint bursts away*
---
-Survivors can now hook Freddy in microsleep
---
Playing survivor helps being better at killer, a ton. You learn a lot from other killers, their loadouts, or what you thought wasn't toxic actually being unfun to deal with.
---
I play it mostly cause the queue time isn't abysmal.
---
Just letting you know most killers never get to see the full potential for just how dirty SWF can be. Cause they're honestly not that bad as is from my anecdotal experience.
---
"Oh no, she's hot"
---
\-my meg friend
---
"WE WHINE WITH REASON" MADE ME CHUCKLE BUT STILL FEEL THE GLORIOUS WEDNESDAY RAGE. THANK YOU
---
Especially at red ranks. I can tell you haven't played the game long enough to realize rank in this game is nowhere near like rank in League of Legends, Dota, CSGO, etc. You still feel like because you're red rank that  must mean you're really good. One of the best right because "red rank". Lol...
---
Truth hurts man so here it is...scardettes/blendettes are not good. Get a couple thousand hours under your belt then revisit this thread, until then this conversation is clearly a waste of time.
---
Nah, me and my swf just find ways to meme at this point. The other day we just went to the killer shack and crouch walked around it till the killer found us.
---
I relate to that David sadly
---
First off, what rank are you? That can help knowing what you need to fix.  
---
Another thing is looking at what you striggle with. Do you struggle at finding survivors, winning chases, or better managing your time?  
---
There's plenty of things you could be doing right or wrong. Your killer choice might even be what's holding you back
---
Ah guess I'm not a strong reader.
---
It does on the mobile version.
---
Skill requirements do not negate the Nurse's strength as a killer.
---
The objective is to sacrifice survivors. Doesn't matter if it's off-rip or end game. Not every squad of survivors is gonna let you sac em all after a few gens
---
Canadian?
---
NOW I AM RAGING AT POSTING THIS SEEING THAT THEY FIXED IT IN THE NEW PTB PATCH NOTES.
---
SWF was always Freddy's enemy tho.  I still wish they would add like a -15% gen speed to people who lobby in as SWF.  People who aren't grouped as SWF don't get the debuff.
---
What good perks show up a lot in the shrine? I wanted bond last offer period but I was short on shards :(
---
I mean, I have played some survivor way back when I actually had friends that play this game. And my little experience as survivor definitely has helped me as killer, mostly because I know how reliant survivors can be on the red stain, so I learned how to hide it. And there's the unfun stuff I know about-I hated playing against clown, spirit, and myers.
---
I mostly just don't play survivor because I always find myself dying on first hook and doing all the gens by myself, and I very rarely am able to escape a chase once I'm in it. I feel I would play if I invested bloodpoints into a survivor, but that's a huge investment for me.
---
Okay so what would the point be of running across the map to wake up? Progress is no longer slowed right? I don't see the point of running across the map only to save 30 seconds. It would take longer than that to go there right?
---
Nice try. Yes I dig it that u love ur girlfriend &lt;3
---
It's alright, but crew's cache, musketball, and the skeleton crew are a bit eh, Skele crew shouldnt be able to attack survivors,  it would be better though if they emitted a terror radius or such, or when they 'hit you' the next skill check you get is very difficult. like, harder than a normal very hard skill check.
---
Well they are accurate to Freddy's character, he puts down pools of blood in the floor to slow survivors down.
---
He‚Äôs decent, definitely not top tier
---
And musketball making 3 survivors(if all hit) broken for the rest of the trial? thats way to powerfull.
---
How do you know when you‚Äôre obsessed when playing as Mike? Sorry I‚Äôm new.
---
I don't know why either. Unless it's a really boring killer to versus and the killer is good at that killer when you just want to play for fun (which I'm not a good Spirit rank 8 or not) there's no reason to DC not long into the game
---
I hate wraith. I'm rank 7 survivor(ps4) but everytime he is the killer everyone dies and fast, I mean I would prefer any other killer with a mori than a wraith and yes I suck at looping
---
Same lol. I had 4 survivors get killed by the entity cuz I had bloodwarden as a huntress. They couldnt leave in time :) I get ppl want to be altruistic but ure taking risks if 4 of u are there.
---
Lmao you immediately assume he‚Äôs Canadian because he said sorry? That‚Äôs racist.
---
YES AND YES. SOMETIMES I NEED TO VENT ABOUT HOW SHITTY THE KILLER OR ANOTHER TEAMMATE WAS! I HAVE NO CLOSURE!
---
ON ANOTHER NOTE, WOULD DEDICATED SERVERS CHANGE THAT?
---
I had some bastards do this to me too. Just turn of follow notifcations' they arent really needed and prevent stupid shit like that from happening again
---
The most boring shit you will encounter as a Killer
---
good job!
---
Maybe a bad internet connection. Lag. Don‚Äôt take it to heart.
---
Damn, im lucky I got 4 lmao xD
---
Yeah if you play killer a bunch you'll have plenty of points to spend on one survivor in particular. Pick one you like cosmetics for and just main it.
---
Dead Hard, DS, Unbreakable, and then Adrenaline/ Spine Chill/ dealer's choice. Dead Hard is a must imo.
---
Lol he looks so fob üòÇüòÇüòÇ i love it though
---
Thank you, ill do that now :)
---
Electric man. I like it.
---
Did you report yourself for hacking?
---
Buy ghostface, get to purple ranks.
---
remembers me of tf2 for some reason
---
Facecamping is if you camp right up in their face or next to the hook. Not a distance away or nearby, but right out in front of them. 
---
IMHO camping's a shitty strat to use unless gens are done to secure a kill. If gens are still left by you camping them you're not pressuring the other survivors who will rush through gens the meantime. Once gens are done if you don't camp they'll likely be rescued though.
---
And yeah toxic survivors if they manage to set me off enough (Which is hard as I am a very patient person) I will gladly throw the match to camp them. For them to piss me off to that point it's not a case of "Baby Killer getting mad LMAO" but toxic shitter wanting my undivided attention, and they got it. 
---
People who teabag + blind at every pallet, sabo all the hooks, and use OoO for cross-map teabags or otherwise "Bully" the killer like that can't really complain about being camped. There's a difference between playing optimally and going out of your way to be as much of a dick as possible.
---
ok
---
You are correct in that stand point, but some play styles can and will ruin others experiences
---
Yes It would be stupid. But to freddy snares work the survivor need to be in dream and takes time to place them. They could make pallets base kit, and snares a rare add-on but in with that add-on he could use both pallets and snares.
---
Thanks! My equipment is pretty trash so I‚Äôll probably remake it eventually
---
So I probably hate Billy more than anyone, but you really can't judge a killer onlybplaying them ONCE
---
Can you get it with shards? I feel like I already know the answer.
---
Cool guide! 
---
Unfortunately most players are just absolute pussies lol. 
---
Looping takes a lot of practice, patience, memorization. Even after 1200 hours it's always interesting to see if you can squeeze just one more rotation in to a loop.
---
It's still incredibly good, just not universally excellent like it used to be. 60 seconds is a long time, and if you're halfway decent you can use it aggressively to give yourself an extra hit if the killer isn't a tunneler.
---
Flashlight blinding is part of the game! Yes it sucks when you‚Äôre the killer, but it actually requires quite a bit of skill to aim it properly.
---
Bruh
---
I always bring a Grip Wrench with my BNP. I still sometimes miss the skillchecks but it happens significantly less often.
---
And clown can "sorta" use the bottles as traps.
---
Lol. Im guessing you are rank 17ish.
---
Yea it just seems so situational tho
---
You are bad guy, but you are not 'bad' guy.
---
Today, I let two survivors go because they‚Äôre other two teammates DCed after I hooked one and the other got trapped. There were 4 generators left still, so I felt really bad.
---
That‚Äôs why you gotta juke em my friend. Be as toxic of a survivor as possible haha
---
Wait... Does bamboozle work on region's vaulting?
---
"Hey uh, \*wheeze\*, Dwight drink that bottle over there before you circle back to the pallet"  
---
"Why the fuck would I do that clown"  
---
"It's got locker juice in it"  
---
\*sips\*
---
Unless you have iron will escaping by pure LoS against experienced killers is nearly impossible. 
---
You need to loop long enough where they choose to leave you.
---
Why did the bar not slow when Jake was downed?
---
No idea who this is, but I wish the game was this exciting all of the time. I am in too deep to find any actual enjoyment.
---
Why does the side of her head have to be shaved though? That's a nea thing..
---
It happens every time a Killer is released. It's just entitled idiots being idiots.
---
Kinda unfair how we paid for old Freddy and what we bought is getting thrown out the window.
---
I've seen ambushes where you run towards survs while teleporting behind them to throw them off, and I think its gonna be crazy once people really learn how to use him to the fullest.
---
It‚Äôs me haha
---
Ayyyyyy let‚Äôs go!
---
They were both injured
---
Perfectly balanced
---
Aye, it is. I just get annoyed when people use the flashlight macro which is genuinely painful for my ears as I have hyperacusis, or blind at literally every goddamn pallet with a purple flashlight, odd bulb, and intense halogen so I'm blinded for a long time. That's super annoying because sometimes it feels like I'm staring at the blind overlay (thank god they removed the white screen) more than the actual game.
---
Having the same problem here brother.
---
wow this new doctor cosmetic sure looks strange.
---
It's only situational if you never get hooked or if you die on first hook. Like I said, if the killer isn't coming back to the hook, you can use it to be aggressive, take hits for other people, and just generally waste the killer's time, and if the killer is coming back to the hook, congratulations, you don't need to worry if the person unhooking you has BT.
---
You're bad at getting karma.
---
And now you resort to ad hom with your superiority complex because you have no valid arguments to pose. You can't explain because you don't actually know what you're talking about.
---
And for the record, since i care about the validity of my argument, i went and asked my friend with thousands of hours in the game, who will loop killers the entire game if they're dumb enough, what he thought was valuable about swf if anything. He listed the exact shit i said. Knowing where the killer is is very valuable information, this is why aura abilities are useful at all
---
I have a few perks on some survivors-notably Feng Min, cause my cousin mained her and he used to play on my account. I've got self care, lithe, urban evasion and spine chill on her but I still can't seem to get myself out of a chase unless the killer is extremely bad. Survivor always feels so sluggish to me.
---
Yeup, not on pallets tho, obviously.
---
Being good don't get you nothing but tunneled.
---
More bamboozling potential than the actual perk Bamboozle
---
(Did you just described urself?) Again with a really wonderful TRIGGERED mental health from a kid. Again you SLAP yourself ( your insult pathetic af). And again, 2 days to insult me in a desperate state is so adorable! =))I mean are you look at yourself when you trying to THINK about something "new" to insult me that complete bounce back to you? you really didn't know how many time you insult yourself each time you said i'm a gay (as in stupid)????. Honey i don't like to insult you with lies, i said the truth about you. And now you triggered all over the place and said i'm a creep. It's like you are really hopeless to insult me with something that i don't even care, cause that insult is so original, like kids that like you, they used those words all the time when they triggered lol. And yeah, i tried to educated people, why they don't used gay to insult other. And a dumb kid jump in and tried to insult me with some triggered cute words. Babe, it's look like you are trying too hard to be a real dick HEAD. So educate people like you with knowledge with be a wasted of time. Cause your brain is like "super flat", words bounce out as they try to come in. And no, i don't need you to read this babe, you are too gay(as in stupid) to understand all of it. :)) Triggered kid.
---
Idk but i love it cuz looks like natalie dormer in mockingjay part 1
---
"nurse is just m1 but she teleports"
---
"Myers is just m1 but he stalks"
---
i wish they would make more skins for the entity, shes like the best character in the game!
---
Hahaha
---
Then they should stop screaming for nerfs like babies. If nothing else works as well, people are gonna go for the strongest. ie Nurse/Billy/Spirit
---
I use to camp when I first got this game. I've started patrolling further away after hooking survivors and I noticed that I got 3-4k more consistently
---
Well for each survivor asleep, Freddy's gen teleport ability cool down is shorter. (I could be wrong but I believe the base cooldown rate is 45seconds and each survivor asleep shortens it 15%)
---
Maybe it's not worth it to run across the map immediately after falling asleep, but the clock doesn't move until the survivor wakes up.. so maybe the survivor finishes a gen and then moves in the direction of the gen nearest the clock.
---
Just because the clock spawns on the other side of the map initially doesn't mean it'll far away from the survivor all the time. 
---
I think it's a pretty interesting balance that bhvr has for waking up here.
---
Just seeing this long ass paragraph makes me laugh. Not reading it though. Get triggered. Lmao
---
Why would I go around wasting my time looking at pallets halfway into the game when gens and totems need to get done? Makes no sense. If the last time I saw a pallet up and didnt see anyone use it then I'm going to drop it down. Not my fault if it was previously broken and then put back up by Freddy within milliseconds.
---
Canadian isn't a race, its a nationality.
---
Hood up, hold up
---
Why the hell would that sound "toxic"? In what world is saying something true bad?
---
Describe yourself again =)) lol.
---
...You know, this is probably why I am so bad. I really thought the end goal of a successful chase is to break LoS and escape. This thought here may actually help inform my choices a bit more, if I'm getting chased I have to delay and waste time as long as possible. I'll stop trying slow vaults and stuff until I get perks to help with that.
---
I'm not sure if it's supposed to.
---
You say look at yourself alot. Is that some self projection goin on? You get tired of looking at yourself? Everything you‚Äôve said so far relates to you waaaaay more than it does to me. It‚Äôs hilarious.
---
Theres a tutorial?
---
You described my life right there.
---
I‚Äôm really bad against billy and bubba. For some reason I just panic. Also haven‚Äôt quite figured out Ghostface yet
---
I dont remember getting too defensive. I was just so surprised by so much backlash. Not that anyone asked, but I was tired as hell when I made that essay of a post. I exaggerated on a lot of the content (such as spirit stun and clown bottles) simply out of laziness. I didn't feel like pinpointing exactly what I felt would've maybe been better. My mistake of course. üò¨ü§∑
---
(Note: The hag section was also my mistake and I can admit that. It just seemed like she was so fast because I'd almost never lose survivors when playing as her)
---
Obviously a 5 sec stun on post-phasing with Spirit  is ridiculous. I was thinking more that if you didn't hit someone within X seconds of post-phasing, there's a Y sec stun. Something like that anyway.
---
I've recently gotten A LOT better at looping and mind-gaming as survivor (and a little as killer too). Nonetheless, I still find the game challenging. Maybe I need more practice.
---
Still though, if everyone looked into the statistics, I think we'd all agree that there's a balancing issue. That was the main reason for my suggestions.
---
I don't need you to read it! Honey your brain is flat. I know. I laugh my ass off each time you replied, it's funny u read it but lied to me each time. So adorable
---
I mean one costs an addon, it makes sense it'd be a bit stronger. It does make them his best addons though.
---
I think you‚Äôre self projecting brotha. Should really figure out what you want lol. Also get triggered again nerd.
---
Fair enough.  I hope I came across as whiny. 
---
I wanted to imitate the tone of many people I've played against and with.
---
Trust me, if things get to tough for me, that's when I go play the Nonary Games or Breath of the Wild.  üòÅ
---
Well, if you have a good understanding of the map or even have gain familiarity with the spawns of the tables, you could gain an advantage of the time. That‚Äôs only possible if he‚Äôs not already tunneling you though. Best bet is to escape him and go straight into failing a skill check. It sounds like survivors haven‚Äôt figured out their priorities when against the new and more accurately depicted Freddy
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Lol. Keep describe yourself. I'm having fun =))
---
man i wish M1 killers could teleport to generators like rework freddy .
---
His shirt should have said #Stressed
---
Sorry i read a little bit then your grammar is hella hard to comprehend. So i dont feel like putting in the effort after that. But again that self projection is pretty rough. Id just kill myself if i was that confused tbh. You a tranny or just a dude who‚Äôs gay? Curious to see where your mental health is at. Kinda concerned.
---
Late game freddy with 3 gen rotation is probably the strongest killer, the hardest part about him is getting to that point while maintaining pressure.
---
Freddys sleeping 1 person then chasing them until they hook them are doing it so wrong.
---
Nah, killers keep getting better and better skills to work with and survivors have stayed the same/nerfed for a while now. No wonder why it takes a minimum 25 minutes to get in game as a killer- nobody wants to play as survivor.
---
I know there are some straight up on the steam workshop, but I‚Äôm not sure how up to date they keep that stuff
---
now this, this is epic #relatable
---
Well it used to be that way before it got nerfed, imo its still a pretty powerful perk! Good luck with future decisives!
---
No, Freddy has always been bullshit. Especially if you have to rely on shit rando 20s. Requires communication or some competence
---
Oh yeah there's a bug where like every 3 or 4 matches I can't use my stuff like dead hard or self care nor can I mend. I really hope they fix it cause it's so annoying.
---
Were you making a joke?
---
Lots of children online playing games now days.
---
They get butthurt easily.
---
You can either just ignore them and move on with your day,or antagonize them for a little fun.
---
While it's amusing to watch them lose their shit,i usually just say gg and move on to my next game.
---
Amusing as it is,i don't have the time to sit around and listen to a 10 year old throw a temper tantrum now days.
---
Wish i could give you his name, but I don't wanna be that douchebag who starts a Witch Hunt.
---
Until you get enough been reported enough to get a ban then have to go through terrible customer service to get your account back
---
What makes you say Freddy is better at stealth then Ghostface other than Freddy's invisibility out of dream?
---
If you avoid lines of sight and crouch correctly, GF is technically just as sneaky but doesn't have to worry about lullaby or terror radius.
---
You really don't even know what it mean. Lol. Nah,  i explained why =))). U just dense haha
---
Dude, we should play sm time
---
Nurse takes alot of skill to use correctly what are you even on
---
EXACTLY! THEY KNOW THEIR INTERNET IS SHIT AND USE IT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE AND I SO FUCKING CANT WAIT TILL DEDICATED SERVERS BECAUSE ALL THOSE TRASH KILLERS WONT HAVE A CRUTCH ANYMORE AND WILL BE In THE SHIT RANKS WHERE THEY BELONG!
---
My primary source is Deviantart. I know for a fact I can find The Pig and all four The Legion there, I'm sure the rest will be hanging around eventually.
---
For sure. I can‚Äôt wait to learn him again, since learning the original Freddy was really fun and challenging, and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll love it again.
---
That was only like rank 10 lol
---
Mad grit + unrelenting, head on bug, blood warden bug. Thats what PTBs are for!
---
I'd staunchly prefer the man never get any clicks in the first place, but to each his own.
---
Both nurse and spirit are the easiest to juke imho, you don't need a special park to counter them
---
A man of taste!
---
Unbreakable, Tenacity, Detectives Hunch, and Adrenaline.
---
that fucking title, god damn it, take my upvote
---
Self Care is activated by pressing the perk Icon, this is most likely how other perks like Dead Hard and Diversion work.
---
(This is a copied response)

Not that anyone asked, but I was tired as hell when I made that essay of a post. I exaggerated on a lot of the content (such as spirit stun and clown bottles) simply out of laziness. I didn't feel like pinpointing exactly what I felt would've maybe been better. My mistake of course. üò¨ü§∑

Same thing has been happening to me for the past few months. I sent a ticket to BHVR but nothing has been fixed.
---
How do I find the models? Where are they in the files? ü§îü§îü§î
---
Did you get dead hard from the shrine at some point? If not then I would guess a bug, but hey that's a pretty cool bug I suppose. It might be worth looking at the character info on David to see if there is a checkmark by dead hard or not, to know if the game thinks you have the teachable.
---
Hah you probably sound like the person who wants to pick the most annoying killer to mine some serious salt.
---
People hate Doctor. If you run a build like Distressing, Overcharge, Unnerving presence and a flex perk (I use BBQ for points, but you could run something else like Sloppy Butcher), with double calm addons, you can defend 3 generators and basically make the game unwinnable. Throw on a Jigsaw Piece for the smallest map and you got yourself a 4-man DC. 
---
My least favorite to play against is Nurse and Huntress. Both of them absolutely destroy me and all they do is remind me how much I suck when I play them. 
---
My favorite to play against is probably Myers just because you have no idea what type of build he's going to be running, and even if I get tombstoned I find it more funny than frustrating. (Myers with a tombstone just grabs and stabs you and you simply die right there)
---
That‚Äôs gay.
---
why can‚Äôt he just have a good skin why do they keep giving him bizarre facial hair don‚Äôt do this to my boy
---
That‚Äôs fair. I could definitely be more passive or just leave. It just irritates the hell out of me.
---
The first guy I knew from a discord server. He dcd because he could. The other 3 dcd for no reason
---
The only thing they need to fix imo is her prestige. They removed blood from her arms, neck, and beanie and her prestige just looks horrible now. :(
---
Hmm. Interesting. So in your opinion where does this bump him up to among M1 killers not named Nurse? 2nd behind Spirit?
---
This has been posted so many times on this sub...
---
...and I'll always upvote it when I see it. This is the licensed cosmetic I want the most. BHVR please.
---
I think the servers may be breaking right now. I've been trying to play for the past 30 min and I keep getting lag spikes and DC'ing. It my not be intentional. ( or it could just be my internet dying)
---
Yall know Im right, I like to be honest in my criticism, so you all can downvote but my reality checks are here to stay.
---
So badass! Can you show ace's new outfit pls?
---
&gt;Why do people think that I am forced to play killer to make the survivors have fun?
---
People are responsible for their own fun, not other people and certainly not the opposing side. They're just salty and expect that they should be catered to.
---
When survivors get a decent perk (MoM, Self Heal, Decisive Strike etc.) Killers constantly beg for reworks and get them.
---
https://youtu.be/4jwkbO-2so8
---
I play on console. I'm not going to go out of my way to message anyone. Good or bad.
---
Try a killer that plays to the strength of your playstyle.  Really know the ins and outs of the killer.  Then either use perks to cover your weak areas or to strengthen what you know will work.
---
Noed users don‚Äôt have enough brain capacity to fit anger and an above average IQ in one brain so yall are some angry motherfuckers that are prone to stupidity.

---
Yes please.
---
Okay that makes sense. Thank you for the explanation.
---
I'm sure they've worked on this for a long time. Sounds like he will be a really fun killer to play as as well. I'm sure watching people throw down fake pallets is hilarious.
---
Is it consistent at all for you too? Because I‚Äôve played 3 matches and all 3 give me this bug. Am I affected forever now? It really sucks coming to pc and being immediately faced with such a game breaking bug
---
Seeing the killer's aura in any situation, is EXTREMELY powerful information, but I could see it becoming intrinsic to survivors if a) the killer's terror radius is suppressed to 0 for any reason and b) they are within 8 or 16m of the survivor
---
He doesn‚Äôt need a nerf but mettle of man didn‚Äôt either .
---
Let me innn, LET ME IIIIIN!
---
When you say everything...?
---
Have you tried reinstalling, verify cache? With dbd normally a PC restart fixes everything for me. I‚Äôve also have had this problem because either McAfee or Windows Defender has blocked one of the files from running, try deactivating those security measures.
---
It's on the patch notes, at the bottom, under the 'known issues'.
---
Wish my wife played. Maybe not. She would pick Dwight and hide in a locker the whole time
---
Woah. MoM was high risk low reward.
---
amateur. you always get as close to get exit as possible so you get hit out if you're going to teabag
---
This 100%. I got a SWF group where everyone could loop like a god but they made three incredibly stupid plays and I had them all downed within 40 seconds of getting my second BBQ stack
---
That‚Äôs why survivor escape rates have been constant for the past three patches right?
---
I mean, regardless of how much any info SWF gives, it's more than the game devs balanced their game around...
---
Ya know I was worried that people would think that lmao. Is tombstoning something people don't like because it sounds like it would be.
---
once i got matched with a 3 man swf as a solo survivor , they were full on toxic with their flash lights being clicky clicky swarming the killers . Needless to say they got slugged and i had to solo 4 gens and go rescue them , what surprised me was they had the nerve of saying gg ez when they basically got rekt.  (There is no doubt in my mind that they would have left me to die if i ever got caught at the end)
---
snakes
---
Couldn't have said it better myself.
---
Yes definitely, I love it. 
---
Very easy to keep track of gens late in to the game, brilliant for maintaining some form of map control.
---
Bump
---
WOW THAT REALLY FUCKING SUCKS, I HOPE A 10 INCH BEETLE CRAWLS INTO THEIR PENIS AS THEY BEG FOR MERCY.
---
Fake pallets are always better than any form of snare
---
Am I the only immersed player who actually plays this game as if I was personally in a horror movie and trying to escape from a killer?
---
I try to get the gens down without being seen by the killer a single time and leave immediately once the gates are open. The only reason I'm making a save is if the person is literally next to me or I know the killer is on the other side of the map and I think I can unhook someone and and still get out safely myself.
---
I have zero interest in attacking the killer or interacting with other players unless it's to coordinate on escaping.
---
if you think killer has the power role in this game i invite you to play a killer that isn't nurse, huntress, billy, or spirit.
---
Can't relate
---
I have a buddy who's pretty good (way better than me at survivor, but I think I could take him if I was killer) but he gets super fucking tilted when he gets sandbagged and he and I will get in a 4-stack with two of his friends and one of us will purposely sandbag him every now and then and dude it's the funniest shit you could imagine
---
That's what I'm saying lol. To many people rely solely on pallets and killers that destroy that option people scream nerf at
---
That's how my gf was when she started playing the game
---
Where are you getting that info? On Steam I can see it went down 10% from last year to the beginning of this year. Besides that idk the current %- but I do know I can get a survivor game in 10 seconds or less and a killer game in 20 mins or more
---
I though discordance/surveillance were a yellow aura, not green, as is says in the perk description. And if it is, shouldn't the colour of the teleport be blue or something?
---
This is good. I like this
---
I know nothing of how to rip from ingame, most people have done the work for you already.

2 Options:

1. You leveled David (said hes lvl 1, maybe prestige?)

2. You bought it in the Shrine (might have been long ago)

But what if we use a door

Wow, you're friendly.

Stop Being Rude. He Was Just Asking For Help!
---
Damn not calling it the meat tree in 2019?
---
I guess people hate it esp with Judith's Tombstone and Tuft Of Hair but to be blunt I don't find it a toxic build, given it's hardly "overpowered" as tombstone slows you down + running judith's and tuft means you have to stalk for AGES to finally hit tier 3. It's nowhere near something like Iri heads and infantry belts for huntress.
---
I find being tombstoned pretty hilarious given how rare it is but I can see it could be frustrating for some people to just be insta-killed like that. If I'm running it and someone's teabagging I like to save the tombstone piece just for them.
---
Well to be honest it‚Äôs been quite some time since I‚Äôve played a lot of dbd. I played it hard all the way up until the point after Spirit came out. Not too long after she was out though. I also haven‚Äôt watched or had gameplay of the new reworked Freddy which would give me a more accurate rating. As a estimation though from what I‚Äôve been reading of his abilities I would put him around where doctor would be
---
Petition to force all survivors to read this when they search for a lobby
---
My one friend literally said when I asked him if he wanted to play: "You're gonna make me run aren't you?"
---
Yes. Yes I am.
---
Can't tell you how many people with UE on that I've mistaken for the Pig/GF. Half the time it makes me mess up the gen when they shuffle on over lol.
---
I save all Dwight's. Even Daddy Dwight's. Too cute. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
But the difference between the two is huge. Getting even remotely close to Doc's pallets makes them vanish immediately. You can start running to a nearby window or another loop. With Freddy's fake pallets, you can only tell they're fake by paying enough attention and having already been in the area to see there was no pallet at some point, keep track of that and memorize up to 10 changing placements, or throw it down and get hit by Freddy.
---
One vanishes immediately, the other causes you to waste a pallet or get hit. There's a big difference.
---
I think only games where I pip up
---
Shirtless David with No Mither, Self Care, Iron Will, and Object with a flashlight is my favorite meme build of all time
---
Yes
---
Yeah it's about cutting corners, seeing their red light, and actually learning how the killer players during your first interactions with him/ her so you can get to call out mindgames the rest of the match.
---
I think you can actually, I was surprised myself.
---
Everyone waste 5 minutes every match frantically finding all totems just in case on the off chance the killer has a perk that only activates at the end of the game which probably won't come because we wasted so much time and gens didn't get done...
---
I question how good your "friend" actually is then. If knowing where the killer was as valuable as you're making it sound then perks like alert, object of obsession, spine chill, and premonition would be the meta perks. They are not. Why? Because that isn't super valuable to competent players. Again, if they were absolutely the most valuable piece of information in this game those perks would be meta perks. They would trump perks that prolong chases for **solo** survivors if they were that valuable. Why? If you knew where the killer was at all times via these perks then you would choose to hide instead of learning how to loop effectively. Guess which way good survivors lean towards...hiding or effective looping.
---
Learning how to loop effectively and prolonging the chase is much more valuable than knowing where the killer is, plus it is just downright more fun to get involved instead of avoid the killer. Hence why veterans who have played the game long enough would agree that hiding is boring as hell (especially at the hours they have put in the game, hence veteran), so again, knowing where the killer is doesn't matter when all you're doing is working on a generator.
---
What makes SWF overpowered is coordinated saves and communicating about lit totems. "I am going for the save", "alright, I will stay on this generator then". That's HUGE HUGE advantage over solo survivors. THAT's valuable than "hey the killer is by the shack, don't worry man" "uh....ok...I am doing a generator anyways, not like I need to save anyone". That is useless. Who the hell cares? Nobody. "The killer left the hook to go towards the garage, come save me now!" "I'll do it, stay here on this generator". THAT's valuable information. You just stated killer left the hook, so you don't have to waste time (losing generator progression) going to the hook to see he is just camping it. "Another survivor is coming to save me, just stay on the generator, oh wait the killer saw him and is chasing him now, come get me". THAT's valuable information.
---
Shit that you're talking about like "the killer is chasing me now" and all I am doing is repairing a generator with no hooked survivors. I don't care, but cool more information is always better than none. How valuable is that information though? Nowhere near as valuable as the other scenarios listed above (what I mentioned in the first place). That information is going to change how I am currently playing now that I know that information. "Killer is coming to you". "Ok, cool, I was already panning my camera around looking for him anyway, guess I will continue doing so because I am going to stay on this generator to get as much progression as possible since by the time the heart beat comes in range I will get to a pallet anyways, so I don't need to get off the generator yet." Do you see how useless in comparison that information is?
---
Again, get a couple thousand hours under your belt, learn to get more involved in the game instead of hiding so much, then you'll realize how little that information matters in comparison to lit totem locations, killer location when you're on hook, and whether or not someone is already going for the save. Nothing else will change how a veteran will play the game. Seriously, go watch survivor main twitch streamers who commonly SWF (jen, kitty, etc.) and just listen to what they talk about. "His totem is near X", "ugh, hes camping again", "I am coming to save you now". The only time they change how they play based on killer location outside of what I stated is when they state "I am going to go down, come save me", so their friend can come with a flashlight for a save.
---
That's my "justification" and my last reply. If you seriously do not understand yet then just go watch those two streamers for just one session listening closely to what they are communicating about.
---
The only time I often don't teabag back is when I'm on a generator, because knowing my luck a skillcheck would pop up right when I get off it and blow the gen.
---
Meh personally I actually find billy boy to be the easiest to juke. Its weird when I play against billy I am completely comfortable not depending on pallets and making him fall in holes with chainsaw or bumping into walls with it. But nurse I just panic and drop pallets or vault. There are games where I do well against nurse and games where I get destroyed. And with spirit I just cant. I struggle every time I fight her. I think I have a 0% survival rate against her. I just don't have an answer in my brain. She uses power and I cant juke cause I cant see her, I cant drop pallets right because I won't even know if she's actually there or not and if I'd even drop it on the right side and I cant vault for the same reason. Killer scares me lol. I'm usually the one who runs killers when playing with my friends but if its spirit I'm just like well good luck boys. I hope she never finds me.
---
Now give us the channel link, i want more o that lol
---
&gt; I also have purposely used other survivors as bait to save myself by leading killers in chases towards other players if I have run out of pallets.
---

It‚Äôs a good form of karma farming on this sub
---
I hate going into a match against real people if I've never used the killer. I feel naked. Practice mode would def be appreciated.
---
Dude! I had no idea you were a gamer too!
---
i did this once. billy used his ability and killed me on the spot. karma is a bitch
---
Tricking the killer usually gets you a bunch of distance for sure and can save oyu using up a pallet.
---
What I've found most handy though is just yeeting the fuck out of a tile while the killer is trying to overcomplicate things by mindgaming you with a super omega triple back deluxe special mindgame.
---
Then they look around, can't find you, and realize you've fucked off to a completely new jungle gym.
---
The Creeper it could work really well with the terror radius too, could get some gnarly perks.
---
You're correct. Freddy's lullaby wasn't directional, the patch note only really pertains to huntress.
---
You dont really need to play nurse, just gather the bloodpoints on a different killer or survivor and spend it on the nurses bloodweb
---
Well to be fair, MoM and DS were genuinely busted, granting an absurdly powerful effect at little cost. MoM just required you to play the game, and DS was a free extra life and a waste of a ton of time for the killer. I think the change on MoM was a bit too much because the game doesn't register protection hits properly 90% of the time, but even so the way it was before was just too strong. Especially when more than 2 players ran it. All benefits, little to no drawback.
---
That said, yes I'm aware there are still borderline busted perks in the game for both killers and survivors and need reworks. Here's to hoping they get reworked too.
---
That bloooooows
---
Can't let it get to you.
---
That's what they want.
---
Just laugh and move along.
---
I‚Äôll try this, thank you!
---
That's the problem.  Freddy players adapted to him sucking and turned him into a high investment (bloodpoint wise, christ his add-ons get expensive after a while)  killing machine.
---
Now to toss all of that into the trash and start over again.
---
Darn. Darn indeed.
---
Thanks for the in depth clarification
---
But teabagging the Killer and general trolling is wholesome, amirite?
---
The dude is obviously fucking dumb. ^(I don't even think he plays in red ranks)
---
That was the joke you fucking incel.
---
Nice

Fuckin' boner material

Don‚Äôt know if this a movie candidate killer, but a killer scarecrow would be pretty cool.

Stonetoss is a nazi
---
Freddy's abilities (The snares aka the blood puddles, or fake pallets if he's running the addon) only affect you if you're asleep.
---
You hear the lullaby instead of the TR which is harder to discern when dreaming. 
---
More sleeping survivors = faster cooldown on Freddy's gen teleport.

I'll never let myself be red. I spectated some reds after I died once and they just looked like boring robots. Not sure why I was in their match. They knew were everything was and just generally had a try hard vibe about em. They honestly looked completely ridiculous.
---
Surveillance is pretty good imo
---
That's why you gotta snipe. 
---
Most people expect you to be standing right behind them when they fall asleep -- but if you sleep someone and are nowhere to be found, they panic and hide.
---
Just keep an eye on them while sleeping someone else, usually, it's always a good idea to keep at least two people asleep at all times if you're running a Sniper Freddy build.
---
With spirit you just use your track marks to mislead her, run a certain way (twords a loop) and when she goes invisible start walking a different way, as soon as she looks away from you immediately run and do it again- I do that till my team can do the gens or she gets tired and goes after someone else. 
---
With nurse you can really just loop her around a tree but if you can't do that just run in different direction when she blinks twords you. Gotta be on your toes and don't panic, it's fun when you get the hang of it.
---
These are a stretch, but i feel would fit in the game.

The Fisherman from I Know What You Did Last Summer
---
Maniac Cop
---
The Strangers
---
I think these would make great additions to the game.
---
Okay I just spent like 4000 shards i was saving up to get the spirit but now i used them to get bloodpoints and level up quentin. I'm heading into a game now with my level 49 quentin, wish me luck
---
I haven‚Äôt seen a more accurate meme/representation of BHVR patches than this. Hilarious, yet accurate XD
---
Totally.
---
Hellraiser with a roadhog hook be fun.
---
imo was great, keep going!
---
I was watching someone stream a survivor game on the PTB against a Freddy who only had blood warden as a perk. He managed to trap all three with blood warden and watched them walk right out. I felt so bad for him.
---
I think that‚Äôd be awful to play against, unless disarming traps didn‚Äôt alert the killer. You can counter Hag traps by crouching, which is fair.
---
Just dc omg if you are bug and cant play the game just dc isn't that hard and im pretty sure people will uderstand
---
I never said Billy had better mind games. But to say he's as bad on loops as an M1 killer just shows that you don't know the true potential of Billy in a loop. Check out some of OhTofus latest Billy games on YouTube for some seriously good Billy mind games and looping
---
You can already nod and shake your head. Stop definitely seems useful though.
---
But that's how you stop being sucking. You stop sucking
---
No I mean take ruin off and replace it with haunted grounds
---
I've played four games so far against the new Freddy. I have had two were it was a 4k. the first wasn't that memorable, just like any other match and killer got a 3k, last survivor got hatch. 
---
Second one was a good close game. Could of maybe gotten an all escape or half escape if we didn't have a meg that dced when she got pulled off trying to unhook me... right in front of Freddy.... (I was seriously like WTF when I saw her even considering that) freddy got all of us that game with 3 gens
---
Third game was a genuine 4k but was a great game with Freddy running Hex: Ruin but we got down to 2  gens before freddy got his first sacrifice.
---
Fourth game was an all escape but was a fun good game.
---
My opinion from what I've seen so far as a survivor and as a freddy main is that he's fine as is and people just need time to adjust and figure out his new counters and work-arounds like any other new killer.
---
Steam Forums
---
Huh? This is why I said just make *Kindred* built in vs. being a perk. It‚Äôd address camp hooking and lack of hook coordination in an instant and allow the Devs to balance around this information.
---
Not gonna lie though, sometimes if the killer does a 360 and flails wildly when you round a corner it's because you spooked the bejeezus out of me and I wasn't expecting a blood covered Nea/David right then.  
---
Also a Hag main.
---
gun
---
Never said you did. 
---
Although we could delve deeper into why you feel it's a dick move, in a fictional game, to escape by any fair means necessary. Why should get myself killed to save some random who has gotten themselves caught 3 times in the last 2 minutes just because of made up"chivalry" rules this community has invented? The community in general every day posts threads laughing the enjoying the "social" aspects of the game like trolling the killer, screwing around with other survivors and such.
---
I thought it was really good before, the new texture looks kind of gritty and I don't like how it's glued to her back :(  
---
Give us the floppy hairstyles back!!
---
Then you might have some fun playing around with other killers. Wraith would be better for locating survivors, since he's faster and can turn invisible.  
---
To find survivors easily you'll want to walk around to each of the generators, which are shown from the glowing red auras.  This is survivors main objective and usually where youll see them.  I head to the furthest gen when I first spawn in.  Usually find someone there.  
---
It's also beneficial to play with sound/good headphones.  If you listen closely youll be able to hear survivors moving around, or their moans if theyre injured.  Try using the perk *Whispers* itll light up when there is a survivor within 40 meters.  
---
Finally, playing survivor is a great way to get better at killer. Itll let you think like a survivor which will help you locate and outplay them easier.
---
Ouchies
---
1: Nice strawman, never said it was the most valuable piece of information, just said it was valuable, that it's important. also spine chill doesn't tell you where the killer is, and premonition only tells you direction, not distance, and not where they're going. object is actually a good perk, but comes with a heavy cost, which is why it's not meta. none of these are anything near almost always knowing where the killer is
---
2:I actually agree with you, knowing how to loop IS more valuable, i'm just not pretending that knowing where the killer is isn't valuable.
---
3: Never disagreed on you with what was valuable, only what wasn't valuable. also knowing the killer is at the killer shack, lets you know where you can go safely if you just want to grind out some generators. knowing if they're headed towards you lets you hide and go right back onto it after they leave rather than getting caught in a chase. this is especially valuable if your entire team isn't veterans who can effectively loop, which is most of the playerbase.
---
4:all of this is covered in the previous things i wrote
---
5:now you're just trying to act superior again, experience in the game that you may or may not have isn't an argument. also what entertainers mention =/= what is and isn't valuable information. and again, most of the player base isn't veterans. if you have an entire game of only good veterans playing, then your point is way more agreeable (albeit still not totally agreeable), but that's a very small portion of the playerbase and a much smaller portion of games that will be played, and therefore doesn't apply to the argument that the information is useless
---
Ahh yeah I have Android
---
Do you have any perk guides I could watch?
---
Cool thank you for the feedback.
---
Hey man know your enemies tactics right?
---
Welcome chief
---
I say that because of Freddy‚Äôs complete invisibility. Maybe it‚Äôs because I need to ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù at ghostface, but I think Freddy has better stealth. His complete invisibility and 3-7 second dream transition allows for an easy first hit if you time it right. I dunno, I haven‚Äôt played the game in a month so what do I know :/
---
I was having this issue earlier and am still having it. Several game and xbox hard restarts as well as reinstalling the game.
---
Patrick Bateman lol.

I‚Äôve always wanted Chucky. I have no idea how it could work but I would be curious as to how they would make power. 
---
Not sure if another survivor I would want added.
---
Mr. Clean, right behind you.
---
I meant a dedicated button, but you're right. Stop would do the same thing as a head shake. But what would the other one be? We already have go.
---
Me too
---
Lifelong!
---
How do you do fellow **survivors**?
---
It couldv even been just their internet. Plus surviors will try to find some thing to complain about even if it didnt actually happen.
---
Reporting and cleaning out the community will eventually fix the problem. The only issue with also like I said, no party chat and only proximity chat. F13 give you the ability to play in party chat. Giving other players the ability to talk privately to Jason and that allows them to work together.
---
Wtf have I've been seeing then... Idk, hopefully he won't get nerfed because I haven't even played him yet cause I'm on consoles.
---
Fun, yes. Once I got to rank 4 on PS4, it's really tough to mark anyone. Survivors always spot me before I can apply exposed.
---
If you accept that you have to use him to just run up on gens from cover to get that first hit and then just m1, he's good enough to get 1-2 kills per game at higher ranks.
---
Again, very fun to play, but "decent" at best.
---
a three year old post from an fan account.
---
THIS!
---
Half the time I SWF I end up leading the killer to my friend RIGHT as he would finish a gen and get him killed.
---
It's realistic for us not NOT good for bloodpoints.
---
Haven‚Äôt played against him yet, but I‚Äôm excited to
---
Same here, but I doubt they'll do him like that again. The only thing i could see are minor tweaks based on community feedback, and possibly pallets becoming part of his base kit
---
Just makes you wanna stick your tongue in there!
---
*Starts pointing at them* Fuck you mane *points again* that is rude
---
HE'S PICKING YOU UP,
---
YOU STAB HIM IN THE BACK,
---
HE DROPS YOU DOWN,
---
YOU SPRINT BURST AWAY,

HE'S CHASING YOU AGAIN,

YOU RUN TO A WINDOW,

YOU HAVE JUST BEEN SNARED AGAIN

Milk=strong bone
---
Neither side is favored so stop acting like they are, survivors have gone through a lot of nerfs to balance them and the same can be said for killers like Legion. There is no favoritism so stop acting like there is.
---
 ~A guy who actually plays both sides.
---
Ugh, The Game?! Give me a good map like Shelter Woods!

People that play killer using wifi should be shot.

And if you even have to ask why, you should also be shot.

Whoever downvoted your comment are fucking idiots.  This literally factually happened.
---
I always t-bag, and if they respond with the same vigor and speed, I protect them with my life.
---
If they do one t-bag, they are respectable.
---
If they don't t-bag, I could care less if they died.
---
There's not really "*our* things". I also play survivor, those are also "my" things and a lot of killers do the same, that's not a "us against them" thing; again, your statement is pointless or out of place. 
---
Also, both DS and MoM were reworked because they were being abused and used outside of what was their intended purpose (mostly anti-tuneling tools). Also, decisive specially is still widely used at high ranks, which, **again**, shows that your statement was pointless.
---
I mean... I don't? My console is plugged in via Ethernet
---
But what if no one says anything?
---
Dexter Morgan
---
One thing I think would be a good change is making his terror radius bigger, so that way the lullaby part of his power has more meaning.
---
Lot of maomao memes in the sub recently, this what we're doing now? I'm game just wanna know XD
---
Guys... You know what to do...
---
F
---
From what I've seen, waking up definitely matters. His lullaby can be pretty confusing to pin point him
---
Isn't it standard killer terror radius?
---
Hey can i ask what sandbagging is? I havent been om dbd very long and i dont know this terms meaning
---
Same for bming
---
That was my initial argument though, competent survivors only need what I stated. Majority of the survivors, especially at red ranks, are just not good. Watch some streamers with 5k+ hours in the game (some now have 10k hours!), see how they play, now watch the blendette in your game urban evading across the corn field from one side of the map to the other. Ranks in this game are a joke. Game experience is purely the argument because two rank 1 survivors can be on completely different leagues in terms of actual skill level in this game. I specifically stated that information was valuable to some people (low ranks, inexperienced survivors) so they can do what you stated "go hide".
---
Jeepers Creepers
---
Not being toxic is still saying no to toxicity
---
Candyman would be freaking insane. Also possible considering the candyman actor did a horror game recently (LoF2)
---
This is me but normally I'm screaming "Come on spine chiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiilll"
---
The game avoids gruesome bodies imo for the politicians.
---
Yeah, but the way his power works is you can't see him until he is closer to you if your awake, but being asleep makes a lullaby play that makes it harder to tell how close he is to you. Larger terror radius might increase the range so that way you can see him coming before he is on top of you.
---
Hannibal?
---
i like the skin, dont get the hate around it
---
Some people like to give killer a free hit before leaving so they can get a few more Blood points.
---
Suffocation always seems to have hills scattered about the map.
---
Same thing happened to me.
---
Probs just a wide problem then maybe, ill try playing a bit later then
---
No where did I say you need to be ‚Äúnice‚Äù their is a huge difference between being nice and playing the game fairly so both sides can enjoy it. And yes you‚Äôre right other survivors can ruin experiences of others but that‚Äôs also why I said it comes down to having the matches enjoyable for all players. And not just fun for one and a painful experience for the others. Do you see my point?
---
Already do lmao.
---
How do you not know? They get extra points for being chased out n shit
---
I'm a survivor main and I personally don't care how the killer plays. I expect them to play to win. One time a ghost face slugged me, took me to a few yards from the hatch, let me crawl to it, then shut it right before I reached it. That was brutal.
---
Exactly what I expect a killer to do, tbh.
---
Maybe it's because I'm an adult but I had a good laugh when it happened because it was just... So cruel. Kudos to him for the roleplaying. I could see younger players getting really upset about it. 
---
As long as you're not exploiting (too much) or purposely griefing someone's free time, I don't see a problem.

Pennywise (the clown from IT)?
---
Couple it with Deliverance, Decisive Strike and maybe Mettle of Man, Unbreakable or some other Perk of your liking get the offering to spread out Hooks and annoy the Killer, have it to where after they Hook you (ideally with Deliverance up) and have it to where they aren't able to easily Hook you. Decisive Strike for when they tunnel you, Unbreakable if they slug you. Effectively waste their time and annoy em a fair bit, isn't too bad.
---
[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cbmptt/a_quick_scuffed_guide_for_players_not_good_at/)
---
Yeah when I play with most friends. But when my nigga Kyle is on it‚Äôs a sweat fest out here
---
Thanks for this. I knew about most of it, didn‚Äôt know that killer actions break bloodlust. If there killer goes for an M1 and misses does that break BL? What if the M1 hits?
---
You get 50k each
---
Studs are way cuter on chicks, but the ring is more metal/punk, so more thematic with the outfit.
---
Yes, the community is toxic.
---
I will say this, no matter what your playstyle is, you will get toxicity. It's just this way this game is. Dying makes survivors mad. Alternatively, survivors surviving and taunting makes the killer mad. 
---
That being said, your playstyle is called "patrolling". Not camping but definitely focusing on the hooked survivors. In this community, a lot of people will still call you a camper because of it, but at the end of the day, your goal is to kill everyone. Survivors often make up rules to make it harder for you to win because of "game etiquette". As you've probably seen, patrolling doesn't always work. It's easily defeated if survivors are doing gens.
---
*Laughs in calcium*
---
I know I just jumped straight in after reading a bit of the reference papers they have. They actually do have tutorials, I just completed the survivor one last week.
---
If the M1 misses, they keep bloodlust AFAIK
---
If they connect, it resets
---
Not all of us are that bad I‚Äôm sad about people complaining about him
---
Good idea.
---
Freddy looks like he‚Äôs going to be fun, running from him and playing him, waiting on the console
---
I think i found my new main.
---
I'm in your same position, I started 2 weeks ago and am rank 6 for both killer and survivor.
---
Your first 8 ranks are going to be a blast (20-12). Lots of learning and screwing around, even some laughs. I loved the first 8 ranks and they convinced me to buy some Cells.
---
Shit gets real after that. 
---
As Survivor you are gonna have some issues with decent teammates for 6 or so more ranks.
---
Killer just goes to shit. 1 or 2 gens will pop before your first down because you don't have ruin and youll get 360'd all the time. Most survivors know about the frame drops that occur when killers take a swing or get bloodlust. They use that to circle around you and confuse you.
---
Most survivors also have borrowed time, resulting in a shit sandwich for both sides. As killer it just results in survivors being cocky,swarming the hook and unhooking in your face. It feels shitty. As survivor, you usually get tunelled (which usually makes the killer lose) and that sucks.
---
You wont have the meta perks either. So as killer gens will pop like crazy and survivors will disappear constantly. As survivor you'll feel kind of shitty because your chases wont be anywhere near as long as others.
---
TL;DR No issues you describe for the first 8 ranks. Tons of those issues after. Dont rank past 12 until you feel ready.
---
If you‚Äôre a high level killer and you‚Äôre smart enough to be able to predict the movement of killers then you‚Äôll be a good survivor
---
I really appreciate this. I main survivor but I‚Äôm trash at chases I think this will improve my strategy!
---
I'm new what does NOED mean?
---
Ok go ahead, since you can go on name me 8 other things, since there is so many complaints from killer. I implore you
---
I'll miss Freddy's tracking ability and wallhacks not since it can make him 'easy' or any of that but because so few people expected me to just turn around the corner knowing they're right there and WHACK before they even have time to react. Sometimes, I'd GIVE them that time and just stand there watching them as the realize 'I fucked up trying to hide.' Gotten a fair number of DCs off those last.
---
She does indeed... I used the correct torso textures for her skin so i guess they were intentional.. however the light patch on neck and atm bracelets were because of my render ebgine.. i had to seperate those meshes which iforgot to do..
---
Can I get this NOED guide PMed please? Lol
---
I've only ever done it to look for hatch but if I hear them close I nope it right tf outta there
---
This will probably look better in game and with his hunched over walking animation.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with slugging?
---
If you don't hear the DC noise it means the game kicked them. Not saying people didn't just quit because they were unhappy, but some times it is unintentional.
---
Still happening
---
Send me your Steam username, if you want, so we can play together!
---
Have fun out there in the fog!
---
Actually shards, I think they're doin a lot of the cosmetic s with shards to get the store back up to their 80% promise
---
No One Escapes Death. It's a hex perk that takes the place of a dull totem once all the generators are done. It speeds the killer up by 4% and makes all survivors one shot down. It can be prevented by cleansing all 5 dull totems before the endgame.
---
Gist of it is don't cleanse totems you find that are kinda easy to spot.
---
DEFINITELY don't cleanse totems next to exit gates or unfinished gens.
---
Cleansing every totem you find will often end up leading to the NOED totem still spawning on that 4th or 5th illusive totem that no one could fucking find. Hence why *not* cleansing easy totems is usually a better idea.
---
Just keep track of them and when the 5th gen pops just scan them real quick.
---
If you left ones near your unfinished gen, you will literally see it turn to NOED in front of your eyes. If you leave the ones by exit gate, and you get smacked by NOED, your teammates will open the gate, turn around, and see NOED right there, waiting to be cleansed. EZ Clap.
---
So yeah. **DON'T** cleanse totems is ironically the counter.
---
I‚Äôve seen  it before kinda happy sometimes

Your comment about ‚Äúbeing an adult‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have any merit in the post, it‚Äôs not about age or maturity level. It‚Äôs solely based on being able to enjoy something you spent your money on. And no I‚Äôm not saying I want a mushy killer to let everyone escape, I want that intense thrilling match of back and forth with the killer. And when I play killer I don‚Äôt want survivors to just sit there and give me free hooks, I want a hard fought win, I don‚Äôt like the throwaway matches those are completely pointless. It‚Äôs the people that purposely go out of their way to make sure that the other survivors and killer has a horrible experience.
---
Stranger things demogorgon
---
This is really helpful, thank you!
---
This actually. I did a game with Thank/Sloppy Butcher for an anti-healing build and it payed off well. They either don't want to risk getting found by a short 0 TR/RS killer while injured, or they take the time to heal so that they're not making my job easier since I also back those 2 perks up with BBQ and PGTW.
---
Yeah something definitely needs to be done. I hope with the increased BP for doing totems, people are more likely to do them
---
Yes! Explain infinite‚Äôs.
---
Okay ty!!
---
Better star cleansing them totems lol
---
Consolidate (v) -  to bring together (separate parts) into a single or unified whole; unite; combine. They're making more killers more similar, which is boring. Streamers are realizing you play the new freddy basically like clown.
---
Easier to balance isn't bad, but in this case, it makes characters less diverse.
---
You see that 2nd perk she has at lvl 1? She gets a token when survivors unhook each other within a 20m range of her. Once she gets 5 tokens she gets the ability to kill survivors
---
I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm ranking up quickly. I doubt I‚Äôd see this moron at rank 10 lol, he safety pips every at the most
---
It's neat, but, like I said, I wish we could have this in a new killer rather than eliminating the old Freddy.
---
wp
---
The only infinites I can think of are like some incredibly unfortunate (for killer) RNG on Lery's, or haddonfield with balanced landing on those 2 story buildings. Even then they aren't really true infinites like those that existed back in the day.
---
"Infinites" in modern day DBD usually just refer to a *long* fucking wall with a window smack in the middle. And I mean a **really** long fucking wall, like ironworks of misery window.
---
These used to suck way more back when killer vault speed was even slower, bloodlust wasn't a thing, and no perks like bamboozle existed. Back then these were *true* infinites.
---
Reminds me of a gay prono I saw with Ghostface in it.
---
Make one on flashlights. Not running after the killer, not trying to blind the killer already breaking the pallet cause that just wastes your time and charges, running away gives you more distance
---
To me, it has a lot to do with maturity level. Video games can be frustrating and a bad match isn't fun, but people who trash talk in post game chat or even go so far to DM killers are immature.
---
I've had some rough games where I felt pretty irritated, and when the match ended I clicked the "Leave" button. IDGAF if the killer knows my feelings, it's a video game. I just move on, or do real life stuff.
---
If you think insulting a killer after a video game session does anything at all, even if they were a griefer, you're simply wrong.
---
Throw the game by dcing on first down
---
The issue I foresee with Noed is that as long as Adrenaline exists, Noed isn't gonna get touched. It's seen as balanced regardless of how it rewards bad gameplay, since it is the only major answer to Adrenaline. It's the old D strike of killers, it gives them a second chance where it isn't merited.
---
I remember one that was particularly good, in a free weekend shortly after the Pig got into the game. Ambushed a Bill right at the beginning of the match, he tilted his head upwards and begun running in circles until he hit a bunch of tires in an arch and trapped himself there in between them.
---
All this in a couple of seconds. Been a Pig main ever since.
---
The first perk really pisses me off how close it is to being a good perk, I almost actually believe it‚Äôs real considering BHVR made furtive chase.
---
As the old D strike I believe it should be reworked. But you are right, even though I have no issue with Adrenaline, it won‚Äôt be changed unless adrenaline is.
---
And then when you don't bring it you get nothing but Haddonfield and the game
---
Or 90 copies of dbd with CD keys on pc.
---
Lmao appearntly Google images bc that's where I got the image from --Remmy
---
What is this from? I get the meme but don't recognize it.
---
I don't think they think they fucked up, but they know it is the only viable killer at high levels and against swf, but to be viable, she needs also a super high skill guy with perfect muscle memory, so it's a killer balanced to play against those kind of survs.
---
while in hands of a bad player, she is still a shitty killer.
---
It's a killer designed to play against very specific survivors by very specific people
---
And from behing? 7u7
---
Like I've already mentioned, you can use the dream transition to your advantage, and also like I've already said, this isn't a discussion strictly about power, it's about intrigue and variety, which I think has a place in this game. Players should be allowed to do dumb, fun stuff even if it's not powerful. That's why no mither, diversion, head on, and deliverance exist.
---
The Freddy got hit too hard in the head the first time
---
Honestly, I think just not camping and tunneling is enough. People play games to play, win or lose, and if they get a chance to actually play the game they get to learn and get better.

---
I'm just wondering where this came from, and which situation requires you to body-slam a woman with duct tape over her mouth
---
Worst for me is when you successfully hit all the checks, get the gen to about 40%, only to get chased by the killer and afterwards escape and return to the same gen that regressed to ~10%

Thank you! All I really knew about was the loop with balanced landing at Haddonfield or at The Game maps.
---
I feel like flashlights would be horrible to do on diagrams, and even I'm still trash at the exact timing on when to start the blind on pickup animations/ where to even aim on those weird spots on some killers.
---
It's best shown through an up to date video on the topic. Pallet flashlights still can be effective if you have duration add-ons stacked on it (I think)
---
It's not super effective at making distance, but it IS super effective in pissing the killer off.
---
"bc we don't wanna be too gruesome".

"So why am I getting fucking nightmares of the Hallowed doctor skin? Y'all think that ISN'T gruesome?!"

You have 500 hours and can‚Äôt understand their powers just from regular gameplay?
---
The vomit is green by default and turns red (counts as an injure) when a survivor cleanses the sickness in the fountain.
---
Legion‚Äôs fetal frenzy causes legion to be able to vault and chase the survivor to cause them to be in the deep wound effect. They have to mend to prevent from going into the dying state. After Legion‚Äôs nerf it‚Äôs mainly only used to injure and then a regular m1 attack to down the survivor
---
WATCH THE GAMEPLAY WHEN, THO IT IS NOT THE SAME. JUST SEE THE LIMITATIONS. 
---
ONE ADVICE, IF YOU RUN STRAIGHT WHEN SHE TRIES PHASING, YOU DED.
---
This is great!
---
How about looping advice for non-m1 killers, hag, spirit, nurse, huntress?
---
What are you talking about? That's witchcraft!
---
You also forgot to mention how vulnerable you are spending 32 seconds exposed to the Nurse‚Äôs Calling perk. This time is cut in half if a teammate heals you. 
---
Also I‚Äôm glad you striked out the second paragraph, that was probably one of the dumbest things I‚Äôve ever read. Though not surprising coming from a Self-care apologist.
---
I did the survival one, so in my first games I always only had 2 hooks untill dead.
---
Lol I love your voice üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I like how you are shitting on players with no basis when we are all talking about greeting fellow survivors.  
---
Such an uncultured person :(
---
Did nothing to earn? What did you do to earn that Dead Hard, or Decisive Strike, or Adrenaline, or Borrowed Time, or any of those other perks that just giv e you get outta jail free cards? Stop whining every time the killer gets some advantage. The whole point of the game is for killers to be this intimidating presence that survivors have to play skillfully to avoid. Learn to stealth
---
The Nea part is kinda creepy... You sure it was the game?
---
These are amazing btw. As someone that watches popular streamers of DbD, I get what they‚Äôre doing; but these graphics are so great to help visual it from a third person perspective.  You should make more! :}
---
have you figured out how to use insta heals cause i can‚Äôt
---
I don't like perks that provide second chances unless they are earned or counter toxic behavior. The term "genrushing" is extremely arbitrary and doesn't really have a baseline to constitute using as a term. Surviviors only have one objective. Press BHVR to add more objectives instead of running a second chance perk that punishes you for not doing ur job well. Noed doesn't counter toxic behavior and the killer does nothing to earn Noed (no. Being "genrushed" is not toxic and it is not a reason to reward the killer.)
---
What I find funny about the "genrushing term" is that it's a term used to describe Surviviors who do their objectives too quickly. But when that logic is flipped, it's seen as a "git gud scrub y u complaining" moment. Bc what is the parallel? A killer that downs Surviviors quickly. That isn't seen as "hookrushing" or "killrushing". It's seen as good gameplay.
---
Honestly most games for me atleast is that it depends if the survivors want to be hero‚Äôs or if they are toxic  and get punished for it... very rarely in my games does noed works well even in my surv games if I know the killer has noed me and my boys will ditch a hanging dude because it‚Äôs not worth it attempt to save him.. 
---
I try to have end game start with someone on the hook so I can get other survivors and that is the nature of this perk.. it‚Äôs extremely powerful yes but it‚Äôs a high risk high reward gamble most of the time especially for killers who are bad at the game. Situations will arise where it seems unfair and that‚Äôs unfortunate but it‚Äôs bound to happen in game such as this
---
I can‚Äôt wait for those DC penalties
---
a good swf team does not lose, no matter who the killer is.
---
Emailed the devs earlier they said that Xbox was having problems
---
Alright, I'm both excited and scared to get started haha, appreciate the tips
---
Positive. Never heard it before until just recently because I just started to play using actual headphones.
---
That worked for squidward so if we use that it might make Nea *TOO* beautiful
---
you are supposed to say "GG" if it was an actual good game,if you say "GG" every game you are killing the purpose of saying it in the first place
---
Those have different strategies
---
Hag: you wanna actually have someone, similar to Trapper, following and heckling her, never allowing her to get a setup going. You can walk into *just* outside of her trap range, sprint, trigger it, and have enough distance where she still needs to walk a bit to hit you.
---
So if she does it near windows, just tap the trap, run to window. Or if she traps one side of the window, you can sprint from the other side, trigger it, and she can't actually hit you. (You can trigger traps through walls)
---
If the Hag places traps in random as fuck locations (namely corners of buildings or tiles and not predictable spots like windows or pallets) you're fucked. Especially since those traps don't have an easy out usually.
---
For huntress you wanna be mindful of actions that lock you into an animation. Tall walls and corners are your friend. You can loop the huntress very VERY easily on jungle gyms, since she's just 110% speed. If she pulls out a hatchet when you're near the pallet, just don't drop the pallet and keep running. Do this as many times as you can until she learns her lesson and just goes for the M1. Whenever you think this happens, smack the pallet down on her face.
---
For Spirit and Nurse: go fuck yourself. That's all the advice I have for those. Just hope they suck, win coin flips, and go fuck yourself. :)
---
Did you just call pinhead "hellraiser"?.........
---
You knew what I meant. Don't be a smart ass lol. DS is not ran nearly as much as it used to and if you think it is were playing 2 different games. It's super situational at best. How is it pointless lmao it was my opinion. If you don't agree that's fine you don't even have to respond. It's the beauty of having an opinion. And DS wasn't being abused it was a strong perk that changed the game if the killer couldn't secure kills early. MoM had a pretty fair requirement of 3 hits for a one time block that then gave away your position if you healed. MoM was way more fair than DS but I mean even with DS it was hard countered by enduring which made the stun a literal second so there was definently counterplay to it. How was DS being abused? I'd love to hear your explanation.
---
This is unbelievably good
---
Dude teleporting and then not seeing a survivor and then suddenly seeing them run right by my face gets me sometimes and I feel like an idiot.
---
Appreciate the thorough breakdown, sounds like it'll be a game I can jump into and try to learn the meta without getting completely slaughtered right off the bat
---
Where did I say anything about insulting people
---
Did you heard it clearly or they were murmurs that you could associate?

Too bad this has LOGIC. My friends would rather blame the ‚Äúgarbage hit reg and network latency‚Äù instead of admit they suck at chases and get hooked within 30 seconds of getting spotted by a killer...

But Dead by Daylight is a Good Game
---
Dude im not tryna be rude but ‚Äúfetal frenzy‚Äù conjured up the FUNNIEST IMAGE in my head
---
I like to play trapper, so when i had a bad game and I don't think i can down anyone else before they can escape, I just find a nice corner to boost my deviousness score with setting traps repeatedly. I almost always get an extra 1 or 2k in points as the survivors twerk at the exit gate and wait for me to see them leave (which I won't :) ).
---
Once they even went out of their way to go find me to click their flashlight at me. I had NOED, so on the hook they went and others suddenly left. Yes, I could have went after them with NOED, but I was a bit crestfallen after all my misses all game and I didn't really want to bother.
---
Protip; As Killer you have a red flashlight duct-taped to your forehead that shows survivors where you are looking. Most survivors will assume that is the direction you are going and you can use that to your advantage.
---
Survivors get Dead Hard, Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, OP flashlights(with mods) instaheals and a bunch of other get out of jail free cards. Those things FORCE the killer to resort to things like NOED and Hex : Ruin just to get some semblance of a fighting chance. Especially when a team of 4 has all said perks. As a killer main I can say the only way a killer can win is when the survivor makes a mistake. If they play perfectly then the killer can literally do nothing about it with the exception being Huntress and Nurse
---
Okay,

Now I know you probably just wanted me to type out 8 killer complaints for the joke of it but I did it anyway, but if you're serious dude stop and smell the roses, it makes zero sense for the devs to be biased because they need both sides happy for the game to work. Enjoy new Freddy, enjoy the game and don't be so cynical.
---
Lot gun
---
They were quiet but clear. Once I hit Madness 3 they got louder and easier to hear. I almost didn't want to Snap Out Of It. I haven't got the chance to test this on other survivors yet.
---
Yeah I guess so, I‚Äôm just thinking of all the times my teammates who don‚Äôt have borrowed time take me off the hook in front of the killer‚Äôs face, very rarely do I get safe hooked, and then chased
---
I believe the problem mostly arises for solo players however, as randoms usually kill themselves for a clearly unsafe unhook.
---
&gt; Legion‚Äôs fetal frenzy causes legion to be able to vault and chase the survivor to cause them to be in the deep wound effect. They have to mend to prevent from going into the dying state. After Legion‚Äôs nerf it‚Äôs mainly only used to injure and then a regular m1 attack to down the survivor
---
I was told that Legion's power was that when he gives somebody a deep wound effect, he has the ability to see where every survivor is outside of his terror radius?
---
:)
---
Honestly, play whoever you want, other survivors can be shitty.
---
I personally hate spirit because she's super ass to go against especially if you're still trying to get better at the game like I am. Her with prayer beads is the worse and it honestly removes the main counter play she had when she's not in the direct line of sight of survivors. Bubba also has some rept behind him because he's super easy to camp with, but I've honestly never dealt with campy bubs so I can't say much there.
---
That would be an interesting idea. Make it a very short 1 or 2 second timer, and the killer can kick it once every x minutes (if he comes across it) and that increases the timer. Maybe 0.5 extra seconds per kick? At endgame moments those 1-2 seconds can be make or break. I think killer being able to close hatch is garbage. It's easy to find when you have no fear of cruising around the map.
---
Capitano reposti!
---
You paid for the character. The character needed changes and has needed them for a long time. He could not function to the best that the community and Devs wanted, so he was changed to make him a stronger killer with new mechanics. It‚Äôs completely fair and you‚Äôre still getting your moneys worth. If you choose not to play him, then that‚Äôs not the Devs being unfair, that‚Äôs you making the choice not to use what your money got you.
---
Nintendo Switch DBD?
---
Yeah he should know by now. I have way less hours then that. I just look it all up because I don't like not knowing how to combat or use abilities in a game. 
---
BUT he is correct. The game shouldn't force you to look up how shit works. The game should provide you info on how its mechanics work. I. Need. Details.
---
Guys... He's not wrong.
---
How do you establish what "north" is?
---
I think it's very underrated, and a decent choice to take Saboteur's spot in a Sabo build
---
*How it looks

*What it looks like
---
Oh, sure man! It's Crowteeth, I'd love to play
---
r/neverbrokeabone
---
Maybe, instead of every totem, only the dull totems give the penalty. Ex:
---
1 hex totem (therefore, 4 dull) = 20% penalty 
---
2 hex totems = 15% penalty 
---
And so on
---
I wouldn't really call myself a "high" level killer, lol. I've only ever reached rank 11
---
there was a leak that said it would be pyramid head  
---
don't really believe it because his most iconic weapon is the great sword and he moves slower than james's walking speed so they'd have to go with the less memorable Spear
---
I love the outfit and hair! They need to just make her look less like someone struggling with a meth addiction.
---
i still feel her cinderalla outfit is the best for her.. i had to tweak some PBR for this.. her torso skin and top were made as 1 material ingame usually they seperate skin from cloth since both should use different materials. so im not sure how this will look ingame.
---
Still, don't you think it's just a bit too short? Even an extra 15 seconds would be a nice increase. Dam that thing goes fast. It makes you sprint to that door and now you become a predictable, much easier to herd target.
---
No, dont think so but you have to be in one for a long time for them to appear and its three of 'em. I think they also fly around your head and make noise when you leave the locker for a minute after.
---
Same for me
---
Most games these perks were used in weren't laggy.  Your excuse is that we need to introduce perks that reward people for failing that they can ALWAYS use in order to address a problem that only sometimes occurs?
---
3 crows is a loud noise indicator or at least should be.
---
Hmm link is broken.
---
Wow. Not the best conversationalist in the world are you? I literally stated the best, most accepted argument for why ruin is still useful despite going down early and you shoot me down. Am I missing something here or are you really that much of a jackass?
---
Her RBTs got rekt with one of the newer updates.
---
Hmm, this is a better idea I'll admit. It actually makes killers think.
---
" Will I rely on the reduced action speed or will I bring a hex?"
---
If you click on the killer and put your mouse/pointer where the toolbox/medkit/etc is for survivors next to the addons it tells you what your killer's powers do.
---
Good, I'm not the only one
---
I hate you so much for that lol
---
*Subscribe to Pallet Facts*
---
D strike can be countered by slugging or by just not tunneling. Borrowed time admittedly needs to be looked at but then again you can wait out the timer and not tunneling. Flashlights are never op (just look at a wall, at pallets they‚Äôll obviously be nearby) not to mention you can run frankins, overwhelming, or light pen if you see them in the lobby. Adrenaline you at least have to work for, instaheals need to be fixed but then again franklins, etc. (franklins is a good perk) and I don‚Äôt see what else is get out of jail free except infinite‚Äôs which should be looked at, however you could just not chase them.
---
WENT UP AGAINST A HAG WHERE ANOTHER GUY AND I ESCAPED, BUT SHE STILL HAD SOMEONE ON THE HOOK. I KNEW I WAS TAKING A RISK, BUT WE WENT TO SAVE THEM.
---
IF I'D JUST BEEN DOWNED DURING THE RESCUE, I WOULDN'T HAVE MINDED, IT'D HAVE BEEN MY FAULT. BUT THE MISSION WENT PERFECTLY, WE WERE ESCORTING THE PERSON TO THE GATE, AND THE HAG WAS TOO FAR BACK TO DO ANYTHING. I RUN OUT THE EXIT... AND THEN TELEPORT BACKWARDS, SLAM INTO THE CORNER BY THE GATE, AND GET DOWNED AND KILLED.
---
FUCK THAT HAG.
---
Hey yo, the Cropsey legend actually inspired Friday the 13th, so maybe that's how we get a Crystal Lake map...
---
When aren‚Äôt people calling for nerfs? I‚Äôm not buying jack for this game until I know whatever outcry becomes normalized in a patch weeks or a month later. It just isn‚Äôt fun and almost seems intentional.
---
Usually we use a main building. Coal Tower for example, north is looking at it from the shack.
---
And he wouldn't be wrong.
---
Nah man show off what you got, if you're gonna go down go down fabulously.
---
I honestly love seeing other player skins because some people can pull off some nice combos that I want to copy when I get the money for it, both on Survivor and Killer sides.
---
thats what makes it so beautiful
---
It's a reference to the engineer class of team fortress 2
---
About the second part I was thinking about that the other day lol. An actual purpose to totems besides countering noed would be nice, maybe at least even a totem counter idk.
---
Xbox.

 &gt; It's not useless, being able to heal oneself is great in certain scenarios, such as being the last one alive... and that's pretty much it.

Don‚Äôt choose your perks with the mindset of ‚ÄúWhat am I going to do if all my teammates die?‚Äù

Go with the mindset of ‚ÄúHow can I help my teammates the most so we can all escape?‚Äù

It makes the experience better for everyone.

No no- part skill checks

That is true. But the "deep wound" status effect will still down you if you never mend yourself and the bar hits zero.

Why do you keep reposting less than a month old memes

I always do locker dukes because qaq and it either saves my life and let's me clutch the game or the killer is litterally right in front of me.
---
*If* the killer is right there and *if* they come in right away I'll stay at the edge and let them down me out of the map, but otherwise it's just a dick move.
---
Yeah but still need more deeetaaaails.
---
Xbox live is currently having issues
---
You‚Äôre literally reposting anything you can find on top all time posts

Also not really relevant but idc about hex ruin too much. Like yeah it‚Äôs an outing and boring but it‚Äôs usually dealt with unless you‚Äôre teamed with potatoes..
---
Ohhh ok, thanks

Ego.
---
They like being able to teabag with 0 chance of being punished.
---
Until NOED hits.
---
The actual counter to NOED is simply not doing totems that are near unfinished gens/ exit gates
---
I just thought that he was fun, and although not strong he could still get the job done.
---
Couldn‚Äôt wake someone else up, no prompt appeared and was only for one person consistently throughout the match so that‚Äôs nice.
---
why are they booing you, you're right
---
I 4k with most killers most of the time. Killer has the power role. Survivors can win but isn't that expected from time to time? Killers dont need to 4k every match.
---
Learn to play.

It's not just gen auras. It's hooks when you pick someone up, Doctor illusions, doctor pallets, wells, etc. Anything that has an aura. It's been like this since 3.0.2
---
I wouldn't call excessive bugs and connection issues "mechanics of the game"... That just drastically exacerbates the piss off of getting screwed in game with usual actual mechanics (camps/tunneled, etc.).
---
Is tunneling REALLY that bad?  It just makes so much sense, and i don't even play killer.
---
In all fairness, when someone is running a roulette build you gotta get those totems.
---
&gt;"How an easy free-out-of-jail card was being abused???"
---
My my, I wonder.
---
The perk is fine now, it isn't situational, it's simply an anti-tuneling tool, as it should have been from the get go.
---
MoM **was** stupid. Just like people talk about NOED rewarding you from losing, MoM basically did the same. Your job is to *not* get hit. If you got hit 3 times already, you're doing bad at it, why should you be rewarded?
---
&gt;Don't be a smart ass lol.
---
So, now we're name calling? What a shame.
---
it's a very old repost
---
I just kept trying and it eventually worked
---
Fixed it!
---
Only real homies body block
---
oH, the brand new part add on gives you two pretty small skill-checks when you start a gen and if you hit both I believe it repairs 50% of the gen
---
I enjoyed the bold. It breaks up the words and makes reading it much more pleasant.
---
it‚Äôs called having friends to play with

I even renewed my gold and restarted my console and i cant even sign in now lmao.
---
Dosent has haven have a hill?
---
Tunnelings smart but it really sucks when you got found early in the game and you don't even get to play :(((( especially when a baby surv gets tunneled game after game bc baby killers only know how to play like that. In that regard, no one can really improve or learn a way to improve in that particular game --Remmy
---
Theres one in the farm maps too, so long as they dont break the pallet. The one with the trailer to one side (longer) and a stack of hay on the other. Kind of difficult to describe it... If theres a pallet there and they dont break it, you can just loop them forever
---
Was she the best player in the match?
---
God the salt must have been legendary.
---
This right here
---
Same thing with me, and still happening
---
I think there should been some sort of sidebar saying how many totems are left on the map. And I think survivors should know if they are exposed the second the last gens pops
---
Yes. Tier 3 doesn't last forever.
---
And Mike isn't an amazing killer, you will not see him much in red ranks (if at all).
---
lol same. Godda keep the survivor gene pool diluted.
---
Bm is bad manners, and sandbagging is blocking a survivor from moving where they are trying to go. 
---
Tea bagging a killer, not leaving when doors are open(unless you have a reason to), etc. is usually considered bad manners. 
---
Sandbagging typically happens when you run to a pallet, or a narrow hallway, and can‚Äôt drop it down because someone is at the pallet blocking you from doing so.
---
Big crazy dude chasing me with a chainsaw, sounds even more crazy and angry when stunned, plus childhood fear of "chainsaw man" scariest killer in the game for me :/
---
I think there‚Äôs an add-on that makes it so it does. Idk
---
Yes, I assure you Huntress, your hatchet pics are needed to please the entity
---
Finally a Nea head without some crazy ass color!!!
---
There is, but that doesn't mean noed should never be used on a Myers. It's situational.

I saw something earlier from a survivor main that NOED is a counter to gen rushing, and I kind of agree.  If a killer is bad enough that he really didn't deserve any kills, they wont get any.  you'll be able to unhook and loop until the gates are open like you did the whole game.  
---
I also feel like it's a direct answer to Adrenaline.  Both get bonus move speed.  Survivor gains a health state, killer gains the ability to take an extra health state.  
---
With NOED it's not a free kill.  You still have to locate a survivor and win the chase, and as mentioned, there's very easy counterplay; something that should be done anyways, cleansing.

BMing is essentially ‚ÄúBad Manner‚Äùing‚Äîtbagging, unnecessary vaulting to noise spam, etc

THE POT CALLING THE KETTLE BLACK
---
Well done, I laughed my ass off and will definitely be screaming this to amuse myself.
---
I think your really underestimating the snares. Pallets are better later, snares are better early.
---
I do Agee on the Teleport being weaker.
---
I do think it's fine they are separate, Doctor can have different illusions and Myers can change how his tiers work.
---
Most if the add ons are fine but the blocks.
---
If he had both, they would need to be lowered in number maybe 5 total
---
Yeah, guessing its a problem with everyone and not just me, they'll address it and fix it soon anyway
---
I agree. If the won‚Äôt change the perk directly then that would be the best course of action in my opinion.

Ruin. NOED, devour hope, Haunted grounds 
---
Just power through ruin

Cleanse as many totems as you can for NOED
---
Get on your feet and start looking for Devour hope otherwise you and your team are fucked 
---
Please just check is there is actually ruin before touching a totem
---
The noises he makes when swinging his chainsaw genuinely strike fear into me. I can‚Äôt and refuse to imagine hearing that shit in real life. Especially considering the fact that he carries around that hammer thing doesn‚Äôt help. Can‚Äôt imaging what it feels like to be bashed over the head with one of those things.
---
R.I.P so I see.
---
Whats that mean?
---
Saw that glitch yesterday with Legion, before that I saw it on Claudette with that one poofy curly hair cosmetic that came with the white dress, you could see it's outline on all auras, think it's a connected glitch from the coding.
---
Also, don't waste pallets at the start of the game, because usually no one is doing anything productive, no point in wasting pallets. They are searching for the ruin, opening chests. Find an LT wall, or some other loop and waste time where as much as you can. Don't drop a pallet when where is 5 gens left, you gonna need them a lot more when where is 2-1 gen left. 
---
Learn how to loop on a "tractor" in coldwin maps. For me it's one of the most powerful loops in a game, if killer decides not to follow you, and most don't. And if you have balanced landing you can waste solid minute on it without getting hit and run to the pallet after. And if you completely fucked, just drop on a toolbox on the left side, killer will have to swing few times to hit you, and when go all the way around and vault a window to pick you up. What's good 15-20 seconds wasted for doing nothing.
---
Do middle gens first. I know gen on the side of the map is nice and cozy, but do gens first, where all the looping will take place later on, like killer shack, or middle gen in a house, and also you will split the map and don't 3 gen yourself. You will open looping spots, so people don't have to worry about teammates doing gen where, when where is 1 or 2 gens left.
---
But you can use your dead harrrrrrrd!

There is plenty of reasons to wake up. The lullaby makes him super hard to track and is confusing the Teleport has like a 15 second cool down, and his dream abilites are deadly. He can also have the action speed debuff.
---
I dobt even see why it's bad if you don't wake up, makes him stronger
---
That actually makes me happy.
---
Hex: No One Escapes Death. If there's a dull totem after all gems are done then one of them gets activated and let's the killer one shot any survivor.
---
That... also sounds like a joke lmao

Scp femer breaker

It's a fact they you are a idiot.

People hate being told they have it easy. I mained nurse in 2018 before pallet vacuums and other nonsense was fixed. Now I dont play her outside of dailys due to fairness.
---
People just want their fix and hate being told they're part of the problem. Nurse needs heavy nerfs. I'm a killer main and I agree with that.
---
Fuck me with console framerate survivors can just sway back and forth and I lose them
---
The speed boost for survivors only lasts five seconds while the killer gets a speedboost until the totem is down. The killer should never be a minute without finding a survivor considering how many tracking perks there are and how they can only be at two places. Cleansing totems would be a viable counterplay if it was swf which many people do not play. Not to mention there is no guarantee of noed, so guess what you cleansed all the totems for a few points instead of doing the objective. Good job! Also it‚Äôs hard to tell if your teammates cleansed totems either. As mentioned above you are punished for not getting all five even if you are actively looking for them.
---
Nurse: Break LoS ASAP, be sporadic and strange with your movements. Theres still a lot of guessing involved but strange movement+no LoS makes it a LOT harder for a Nurse.
---
Spirit: If you know she's phasing after you, drop a pallet, wait, and then slide to the other side. 95% of the time a Spirit will think you just wasted a pallet and go around it. Easier said than done because you gotta time it up a lil. If you slide too soon, they'll get ya before they even had a chance to go around the pallet. Slide too late and then she'll hit you as you're sliding.
---
They're difficult killers that require you to switch up your gameplay and itll take A LOT of trail and error before you have a sound strategy against them, but it's far from "go fuck yourself"/you cant do anything... Unless its Omega Blink/3+Blink Nurse. Then yes, you're pretty much fucked lol
---
I agree. I think they need to buff the snares.
---
Today I played three games and wanted to try the perk.
---
I literally played in those 3 maps :')
---
nope, she died like the bitch she was. she hid in a locker with scratch marks in all beside a hooked Claudette
---
I feel you. 
---
That's how my first leatherface game went. I got someone who was really toxic that kept baiting me and when I finally won after getting used to the mechanics they screamed at me in chat after. I wish this game had like a free-roam or practice map you can just wander about in with a killer to learn his mechanics, maybe with some bots.
---
I really wish they‚Äôd just let killers breathe in public servers for a while before adapting to fan feedback.  PTB matches are a wild mishmash of different ranks that don‚Äôt represent normal, wider play in the slightest.
---
That and it takes time for people to adjust to new play styles.  Of people are going to do worse against a killer they‚Äôve never faced before until the correct counter strategies have time to be developed and spread.  As-is by the time survivors learn how to play against a new killer, they‚Äôve already been nerfed.
---
They wouldn't remove a core part of her balance no. Probably removed it on killer side so you can hear suviviors easier
---

---
I have a different problem I have a "Initialization Error" on my xbox :\\ wtf
---
&gt; Theres still a lot of guessing involved
---
Good nurses know not to blink right on top of you with their first blink.
---
The first blink is to get an easy angle regardless of where you decide to randomly switch directions to. The 2nd blink is for the precise hit.
---
&gt;you know she's phasing after you, drop a pallet, wait, and then slide to the other side. 95% of the time a Spirit will think you just wasted a pallet and go around it.
---
I try just about everything and it's random for each Spirit. Every phase is a coinflip whether you get hit or not.
---
Although the snares could use a buff. That‚Äôs about the only thing they need to change.
---
Im watching tru3 and hes saying the same thing lol.
---
From my experience, there are two main uses for SWF:
---
"Are you closer to him? Can you get him off the hook?"
---
or
---
"YES, HE'S *STILL* CHASING ME, DO THE THING **NOW!!**"
---
Then just dont use your mic.
---
Big sad
---
The funny thing is when i post about nurse needing a nerf before any other killers, people here downvote me and say nurse is fine. But in game, when i actually do play the nurse, i get 4Ks and people cry that she's broken lol
---
And yea freddy is fine :)
---
No, it is about an extra 13 seconds to gens, an extra 2.5 seconds to standard healing, and an extra 2.2 seconds to totem cleansing speed.
---

---

---
4 insta heals in my game earlier. What's your point?
---
I has the same thing until I restarted my xbox, which then after doing so, gave me the network message
---
Rank 15 is going to have a lot more people like that because it‚Äôs the lowest you can derank. They don‚Äôt like facing players at their proper skill level so they derank to bully newer players. 
---
I think the reason there is so many assholes in this game is because it‚Äôs 4v1. The four Survivors team up and start bullying the lone Killer.
---
That's a biiiiiiiig yikes
---
I think it's just a meme. When it's used though, it's always referring to the pallet in the killer shack since that pallet is commonly acknowledged as one of the best spots in the game to be in a chase with a killer.
---
Snares are better at windows, but that's not saying much since pallets do absolutely nothing at windows.
---
They wouldn't have to change the max number of props, since they would count towards the same cap.
---
It would just mean he'd have some versatility.
---
As a survivor main gen rushing is most definitely a thing. At rank 6 i try my best not to do gens to quickly anymore, because you won't pip if you just gen and leave. Most the time i stop at 2 gens to go totem hunting or take aggro from the killer. If all the totems are gone noed never pops anyway, and if a killer isn't running lullaby or ruin he probably has noed just for an end game build. Like mixing it with remember me and bloodwarden. It can be easily taken care of early on in the game and, if you have a hard time finding totems run small game for a bit. You'll start figuring out where there normal spawns are and destroy them with ease. The killer may have to do nothing to get it, but you can easily deny him the chance well before the last gen is complete.
---
NVM, read the username. Just cause it's smart doesn't mean it's well liked
---
Yeah because garbage killers use this perk now
---
Yeah u make a good point, but I feel like using any other perk like Surveillance or Pop Goes the Weasel complements his ability more that's all
---
Yo Scooter! I've seen some of your NBA vids. I didn't know you played dbd.
---
I hate how BHVR is gonna look at the pallet situation and instead of budding snares, they're going to nerf pallets
---
Several circumstances will arise preventing you from cleansing totems, I know where they spawn. Such as being chased, needing to unhook someone, doing a gen, helping someone up from the floor etc. rarely do I ever get to do totems, and when I do, turns out they don‚Äôt even have noed, so I just wasted my time. All for some points that won‚Äôt but you a brown offering.
---
Ngl I thought that was Dr Phil at first
---
I‚Äôve been playing for the last 4 hours and things seem to be working well
---
Why noed are u bad?
---
Ok you‚Äôre just cheating yourself outta points
---
OINK ON BROTHERS WE ARE ETERNAL
---
You new to reddit as well?
---
No one escapes death -- it's a killer perk that causes all survivors to become exposed when all the generators are complete.
---
The exposed effect makes it so survivors can be downed in one hit instead of 2.
---
Adds extra spice
---
Legit my first few games as a lvl 1 wraith I got into a game with a rank 7 that was tbagging at every pallet choke. Ever since that happened I switched to other killers with more map pressure like hag
---
That‚Äôs fine, almost all my survs are prestiged. I just don‚Äôt like killers that take the easy route for a mori instead of earning it. It‚Äôs not the mori that bothers me, it‚Äôs how they do it
---
So? 4% movespeed helps alot
---
Look at the issue from the killers side: You got unhooked, you're Red Ranked so you're probably good enough to where they likely won't get another chance, so in order to get that sweet sweet 4k (or a kill at all if they aren't running meta/survivors ARE running meta) they have to make sure you don't get to break for that hatch. Also, dear god do those Moris look good
---
Survivors can avoid stepping on them though?
---
How do you sleep multiple people to give you information without add-ons? You're missing out on this information if they're awake.

---
Detective's hunch is the one that reveals an area when you finish a gen right?
---
Was actually farming for that teachable now that the map scouting score got buffed.
---
Well technically that's not true. If all 4 survivors do a totem each, that's 4 totems. Soooo noed still activates...
---
Im guilty of this i can‚Äôt stop myself i just hope no ones getting chased
---
Freddy has an add on in the ptb that does that, it's one of his ultra rares I believe
---
Ever played rainbow six siege?

Eeeeehhh. Nothing in the purge is really "iconic" or recognizable for DbD to make any money off of. Like the whole draw of those movies is the idea of that once a year all crime is legal. How the fuck do you incorporate that into DbD? There's no main hero or killer that's even somewhat recognizable enough. cause they're all just normal people with no eye catching design.
---
I only stay around to wait for my friends and then I GTFO.
---
I would like this I just finished season 3 the other day, who would you choose as survivor from Stranger things?
---
For Killer's there is Thrill of the Hunt - nothing for survivors *yet.*
---
Lucky you, there used to be around 20 - 50(not a joke) pallets on maps, every maze tile had double and back to back pallets
---
For the love of God, can we please stop uploading these? It literally does nothing for the community. "guys, this guy was mad lol" - Congrats?
---
&gt; but don't think you're good
---
Nice. I like to think there's a high skill ceiling on Nurse gameplay :) After all i've put like 600-800 hours on her alone.
---
Dont get me wrong freddy is better now, but still lowtier. The snairs are just a bad version of the clownbottles. The teleport is to slow to get a secure hit. Survivor can just stay asleep cause they dont get nerfed for also they can see your traps. Sooo still better but not good.
---
ASH! THANK YOU. 
---
I couldn't fucking figure it out for the life of me. After the first time I saw it on this sub with Feng Min, it was immediately familiar but I couldn't remember exactly which make survivor stood like that. I knew it wasn't Dwight, he stands with his shoulder up and his head down. I knew it wasnt David because he stands very intentionally imposing and his fists clenched. I knew it wasn't ace because he stands very relaxed. Adam stands tall and alert, and Tapp stands tense. 
---
Ash is the one who stands exactly like that and for some reason I forgot about him! Oh, and Quentin.

The way that the character bio is written makes me think that it‚Äôs fake, it just doesn‚Äôt feel like the other ones. I don‚Äôt know anything about stranger things so other than that I can‚Äôt say much
---
It stands for No one escapes death. It's a killer perk that any killer can get. During every game there are 5 totems spread around the map. These are small sets of skulls, that could be destroyed by survivors, put around the map behind rocks and in corners of walls and such. After 5 generators are repaired or you enter the End game collapse if 1 of these totems are still standing then the totem lights up and NOED is active. While NOED is active you will become slightly faster and all survivors become exposed. Exposed means that they will fall into the dying state from 1 hit of your melee weapon unless they have some perk that helps them take another hit. NOED can be broken if they find the totem that that it is applied to or it can be prevented by survivors breaking all 5 totems before it activates, but don't count on that. Survivors never cleanse all 5 totems.
---
Finally nea can actually be a killer? Since he has that weird mind ability, that would be so cool! It would be kind of like spy from tf2, you can disguise as a survivor from the 4 survivors in the game and when you get close enough you pop out like that one scene when the kids are watching the tape in the new movie. I wonder if the devs have ever thought about something like that! ( I don‚Äôt even care having two clowns, IT would be amazing )
---
There are five dull totems. One person would need to cleanse two.
---
Sometimes when I play trapper I'll trap dulls to make it look like I'm taking NOED. It's a big time waster if it sends someone on a goose chase.
---
Spongebob is actually a garbage killer with noed
---
I think you're thinking about it to hard lmao.
---
I crush dreams by pretending to give hatch.... then mori
---
or even back further when there were legitimate true infinites that if run correctly literally just couldnt be countered (eg main barn on cornfield when it had all three windows, pre-nerf autohaven building, etc.)
---
I think this Freddy re-work is great. However, I think some small adjustments for launch will be much better because people will continue to cry for nerfs and he may get nerfed hard again. 
---
The ability to lay down the snares should have a short cool down, say 10s, and a 1s animation placement. Limiting the number of dream pallets because you can put far too many as is. And the cooldown reduction of his ability needs to be tuned down a bit. 
---
Notice how these changes do not change how Freddy plays or the extent of his powers, but they do give SOME consequences of his actions. I think that's fair because every killer has this so far such as Nurse getting fatigued or Legion's darkness.
---
I wish players weren't toxic to begin with and that it's just a video game. Sometimes you win sometimes you loose but that's no excuse to be an douche canoe to someone just cause you won or lost
---
Personally I stopped running it because I felt like other stuff helps more in my build.  It's so rare to have a circumstance where I need NOED.  NC, though comes in handy quite a lot.  
---
I play 50-50, and while I can see why NOED is annoying for survivors, I just don't come across it enough, nor feel cheated enough for me to want to nerf it.  
---
~~we definitely need those goddamn totem counters though &gt;:( ~~
---
Thrilling Tremors is the Ghost Face perk unless I‚Äôm mis remembering the name, it‚Äôs the one that blocks unused gens
---
100% there isnt really a reason to use snare. I feel like the only reason pallets arent the default is because its rlly good
---
WAIT, is it out yet????
---
Mmmm yes, delicious totem counters.
---
Sure, I'm pretty new myself, and it's been a bit of a challenge learning the lingo people use in this sub.
---
Doctor's also break the second you walk under or through them. Freddy's remain until you try to pull them down.
---
Now if they made it so Doc's fake pallets acted the same way....
---
What he said! But it can be countered by breaking all totems throughout the trial before all generators are fixed. If NOED activates after all generators are repaired and someone is insta-downed, youll need to find the lit totem and break it or run the risk of being downed.
---
For good nurses, don't completely double back after first blink, but do like a 120-150 degree turn so you're still moving diagonal, then repeat for second blink. The angle turns are way harder to predict and counter than just straight 180s
---
Mate anything feels viable in lower ranks, but play against a team of survivors who know how to play and you're most likely going to have a very hard time unless your ruin is in such a magical spot it doesn't get immediately cleansed
---
Spirit fury
---
Hilarious
---
Man they really need to fix this match making, I keep getting paired with 3 people around rank 10 with one rank 18-19. I really dont mind if anyone plays SWF, I personally love playing with my friends as a survivor but they should have it ranked off of the lowest rank in the party.
---
Im really just trying to learn killer and I keep getting bullied, tbagged, flash lighted at the gate when I'm doing the "yes" head nod and letting them go. I know how toxic killers can be and I like to try and let atleast the last one go.
---
Im just a baby killer trying to learn the game and spread some GGs but these guys are creating monsters by being bullys lmao.
---
If you are the only one I can find, it's not tunneling. It's that you hide the others well.

---
Sounds to me as if you aren‚Äôt cut out for pvp games, there always is some verbal abuse in any of these games, be it asymmetrical or not (and most of the time, it is your own team).
---
Lol garbage killer relies on noed to win
---
Oh, absolutely. OoO is part of my main build,. I always play solo so it's an amazing information perk and when needed, i can (try to) get the killer's attention away from X teammate to take the heat.
---
I'd say 90% of OoO users try to BM with it though. I personally don't care about BM so i don't do it nor do i tunnel/camp/etc people for doing so.
---
Nail it
---
There needs to be a survivor in a locker for a minute without moving. Every 15 seconds after that is another Crow
---
It would be perfect if it said ‚Äú1st totem cleansed‚Äù and gave the points as an indicator, the problem is that only one person will see 5th totem cleansed and non-swf groups wouldn‚Äôt communicate that, so a teamwide indicator for cleaning all totems (as a bloodpoint award?) would be ideal.
---
This skin is a meme, yall should stop hating it
---
I knew what was coming and I still jumped. My heart can‚Äôt handle the jump scares in this gamr.
---
You can crouch and it won‚Äôt activate her traps. Even on unhooking if both keep pressing crouch, nothing will activate. 
---
Most people just either don‚Äôt know or don‚Äôt care.
---
I'm gonna be real here, I think (theory) that Freddy's power will be recycled into a better one for a future killer. And hearing all this news about Stranger Things collab is really making me think that the Demogorgon in particular will be a killer and it will have an iteration of the "dream world" where it can travel and tear holes in. Possibly even drag survivors into.
---
It's 2019. This isn't news.

Thanks for telling me, I was so confused and sad ;-;
---
I recently got rank resetted so I'm still at low meaning I get matched with new players and pros. Shame they think their supposed to win 100% of the time.
---
You can't counter D strike if all survivors have it
---
. also you gotta wait for 40 seconds after they're unhooked for it to wear off if I'm not mistaken. So if a survivor unhooks them and you go for them again they can easily just revive themselves by the time it wears off if you slug them or they can DS if u grab em. And I won't go for the other guy if they aren't already injured cuz to me that would be a waste of time. Also the flashlight perks require me to level 2 killers up to 30+ just to get an option to get it, and even if I do I'd rather just not use them because their are better perks. Admittedly the flashlights is definitely the smallest problem on the list, but every now and then there will be that one god survivor that knows how to use that thing like a freaken lightsaber xD
---
They're probably downvoting more so because of the meme mentioning he's getting a nerf post-rework. Probably just taking it out on him in the comments. Emotional whiplash over a misinformative meme and what not.
---
I'm bad to so I dont have any tips sorry but camping is just when the killer stays where the survivor is hooked making it impossible for them to get saved. Dont do it or else people will get mad and you'll lose blood points.
---
Well if your in a chase it's understandable, there are 2 others that could be doing any of the other things, I'm always looking for the best way to pip up and from what I've seen doing one gen with at least one other and doing one more even by yourself will get you at gold for object then you wanna heal at least 3 ppl and unhook one for altru and break two totems and get a pallet stun while lasting in a chase for about 45 sec for bold.  Though i normally run autodidact and max out my altru, with 5 stacks i basically insta heal people really been trying to get botany 3 with it just to be that much faster
---
Which one? The one with the muscles and dresses like a junior high janitor, the one that wears a Halloween costume robe and likes to peek around corners, or the edgy teens? There's a lot of stabby daddies ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
It would be more of a waste of a time if you know that they have d strike and go after them, make the most of your time that they are slugged, teammates will come in and you can take advantage of that. You could always snowball pressure.

---
I think totems don‚Äôt contribute to emblems sadly. They should tbh.
---
Ok look when all gens are done you don‚Äôt automatically win if the killer still has a chance to make a comeback. The game is over when all survivors escape, also does remember me blood warden and fire up counts as playing badly since it‚Äôs for endgame?
---
Oh I thought you were referring to the plague one where it blocks gens across the map for like 2 minutes
---
True, I usually try to do that if I can still see another survivor after the slug. Only problem is that you never know if they have DS until its too late ;_;
---
I'm not even a Kate main but I'll convert for this outfit. RIP Wallet
---
Billy is absolutely not the most balanced killer, dude. Survivors finding him OP have a *lot* of points, and I‚Äôm a killer-only player, lol. Huntress has always been the pinnacle of balance.
---
was it the obsession?
---
They should:
---
* increase the Snares' slowdown effect significantly
---
* decrease the setup time to 0.5 secs
---
* have Survivors leave blood trails when exiting
---
* have Snares decrease the subsequent sleep timer by 5-10 secs
---
No, because you work for them, that‚Äôs what separates them for noed. Even though not fire up but it doesn‚Äôt really need to be earned since its effects aren‚Äôt as powerful as let‚Äôs say noed or adrenaline.
---
This new cosmetic for Quentin sucks!
---
He also stopped skipping leg day
---
I'm laughing too hard at this comment üòÇ

If someone‚Äôs the obsession then immediately assume. I agree though that sometimes it is unavoidable... but I don‚Äôt see any way to change it. Unless they make it so it‚Äôs active until the next person is hooked idk. :/

Tbagging survivor, deserved to die.
---
But how could they nerf him?
---
His teleport is already slow, with a very long cooldown. His snares are already weak and they can't nerf how his dream pallets work without making them useless.
---
The only nerfs that would even slightly make sense are: only having 5 dream pallets and the removal of passive sleeping.

Do not respect pallets. A stun might ‚Äúfeel bad‚Äù but forcing the pallet to be dropped by just taking it is quicker than running in circles around it.

There are also great perks to help going against pallets: Enduring (Hillbilly perk), Spirit Fury (Spirit perk), Brutal Strength (Trapper perk).
---
He deserved to die and also, survivors get away with using every perk and defended MoM to the end and still complained about noed. Just stop being a baby.
---
When ms paint slides are more useful than time wasting 15 mins videos
---
This. Extremely this. And this does not only go for Freddy. Whenever a new perk or killer comes along, or a new tactic, there often is an outcry of survivors who only know how to braindead-loop. I am not hitting on looping per se, it's part of the game and a necessary time waster. But it should only be \*part\* of your tools as survivor. Many players that I encounter, be it playing survivor or killer, just loop from the nearest point to the next, with a jungle gym in between. If you completely rely on this and never consider other options, you will have a very bad time against certain killers and/or perks.
---
So: adapt, learn additional techniques besides looping. I don't understand the entitlement of some survivor players who'd rather scream "OP!!!!!!" than sit down and think about a new, viable tactic.
---
Feng Max.
---
I second the idea of a tile-centric part 3. What to do at T-walls, jungle gyms, killer shack, etc.
---
A few button presses is strenuous? And illegal..... not sure where your information is coming from but pretty sure it isn‚Äôt illegal to change the region in your settings.
---
Man, I need some more Cowboy‚Äôs videos man! I guess watching you play DBD would be the next best thing.
---
No it‚Äôs part of the game, your teammates should punish him by finishing the gens before he can get a second person
---
no one knows at the moment
---
Just be a killer main and don‚Äôt look at comments
---
Indeed. I always roll my eyes when explaining additional tactics and the usual response is:
---
"But it's too situationaaaaaaal I want a surefire way to escaaaaaape"  
---
Like, dude, juking/mindgaming/hiding/... is only too situational if you don't want to learn how to do it \*right\*.
---
Grab Object of obsession and outplay him. Tou know hes going for you so use every pallet on the map and let the other 3 do work.
---
What's the grit+unrelenting bug?
---
Oh forsure, at this point if we are SWF I‚Äôll tell them not to get me. Let him get his rocks off by doing this.  And if possible when I‚Äôm solo I‚Äôll say ‚Äúthis is {insert killers name here} leave me on hook, he has NOED.‚Äù     It‚Äôs just bullshit because they single me out every time. And I get into a LOT of games with them. It‚Äôs a miserable experience.
---
They‚Äôre much brighter person!
---
I'm not sure if you are aware that nerfs to Survivor perks, infinites, pallet density, flashlights, hatch and buffs to Killers like pickup speed all affect Hillbilly as well.
---
So even if he was balanced at some point (I highly doubt it, especially with Barbecue &amp; Chili), he definitely is overpowered now.
---
If you play legion people are gonna dc
---
Lol I'm a 50/50 main and NOED is easily the most overpowered and boosted perk on the game right now.
---
Well that certainly isn't working now. Plus this would finally give some more time for killers, which is their main problem
---
Problem is then you have 2-3 "heroes" on totem duty for 5 minutes meanwhile no gens get done and there isn't going to be an endgame because everyone died. 
---
Just look for NOED after it's revealed it's not that hard.
---
This is how programming works, let‚Äôs be honest
---
Also not tunneling if you try to hide right behind me when I‚Äôm hooking someone so you can attempt the ninja save and I hook both your asses.
---
is there name batman by chance or something similar
---
Yeah but you already have to guess a lot against certain killers, it's part of the game.
---
You don't know whether that window you run to is trapped.  
---
You don't know whether the spirit is haunting you or just standing there.  
---
You don't know whether that loop you're running to is hag-trapped or not.
---
It's just part of the game. The usual counter-play is: don't overly rely on pallets and don't assume every loop is safe. Mindgame/juke/lose the killer, Freddy hasn't got his aura reading anymore.
---
my thoughts exactly!
---
Or maybe a perk that rewards totem cleansing. Like get a token whenever a totem is cleansed and every token gives you 2% faster interaction speed or something
---
Grats I put hundreds of hours into nurse too and I can wipe the floor with nearly every team. Be less stupid.
---
"Battle (KILLER)" is always a fun build.
---
i bet my ass that it's auric cells only
---
i mean i usually end up with one survivor and hatch open so Noed is never really needed since im pretty fast as is when it comes to killer, i understand if new killers need to use it beacuse they are new, but once you are better theres no need for it really..
---
Sounds like my friend
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIyCWC0RZ4c
---
Camping is staying too close to the hooked survivor. I guess you lose points for it as well to discourage it? You can definitely get more points by going after other survivors to hook instead pf insuring one dies on the hook. 
---
Damaging gens is very useful and maybe I play the asshole by not letting hatch spawn in depending on what the survivors are like.
---
Really funny.
---
Could have body blocked ;w;
---
Yesssss üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
**gotcha, ya spastic lil‚Äô gremlin!**
---
Well, you certainly have an attitude :)
---
repost
---
No lol.  Prime is in the name.
---
*edited 3 hours ago*
---
u messed up ur comment LOL loser
---
God, yes please. Next Generation is my favorite Leatherface look.
---
This is really useful as someone who plays both. Thanks!
---
The game is fantastic
---
How does this even pass a superior, one of the ugliest game models I‚Äôve ever seen
---
Grr..
---
What???? I do play killer. I know how to counter Michael.  That‚Äôs not the point of my post at all, no disrespect. I can still do the best I can but there‚Äôs only so much I can do... then boom, face camped lmao
---
Has the name Prime in it? Lmao. 
---
It‚Äôs so sad.  Then he will message us like ‚Äúhaha fuck you slut‚Äù WHAT???
---
And you can put them in high traffic areas. I understand how he works dude. I'm not saying snares are amazing. I'm saying that they're better at giving info than ending chase enders like his pallets.
---
I'm not here to debate with your opinion of him
---
Nobody was an obsession iirc
---
Why are you running light weight instead of Adrenaline with Meg lmao it could've helped you
---
Nope, your wrong.

&gt; There was supposed to be a second change that would award more points at the same time. We lowered the escape points to balance it out.
---
Why change anything at all when you intend to "balance" it with another change, keeping the status quo?
---
Gideon Meat Packing Plant is probably the best map for wallhack Myers. Unstoppable.
---
True but I've always pipped up getting 5k in obj alt and bold even if i get sacked. And breaking totems still raises your boldness so if your not great at running the killer its a good way to up that category and if the killer run noed your golden when the last gen pops, ive been up against killers who run ruin,  lullaby, Toth, snd noed sometimes leaving those totems alone wreck you in the end and if your the first one to get hook with noed up 90% chance that you will be left to rot.
---
That just got changed in the Ghostface patch, actually.  
---
&gt;Added events for Lightbringer emblem scoring:
---
&gt;20 points for cleansing a dull totem.  
---
5 points if a dull totem is cleansed while you are in a chase.  
---
10 points if a Hex totem is cleansed while you are in a chase.
---
Just let them be. Most of the time they follow you around or start vaulting endlessly - means they are not doing gens
---
Thats a good tip, but man it sucks that there is a situation in which a killer has to go "i literally have no power in this situation so i should just leave". But anyway back to the issue with noed. I see noed as a way to counter survivors that take advantage of all their strong perks instead of playing carefully/stealthy. In a scenario where 2 or more survivors are alive and communicating they could split up and each watch a gate while hiding. When the killer is at gate 1, survivor 1 could tell survivor 2 to open their gate and to stop when the killer leaves and then proceed to open their gate. I get sometimes it won't work out based on other factors but that's the best solution I can think of ATM. Also I don't get the problem with " not earning" the perk. Survivors have a ton of strong perks that just work without needing to meet a requirement(except making a mistake)
---
Jake: OMGYOUFUCKINGNOOBLEARNHOWTONOTUSENOEDWHYDIDN‚ÄôTYOULETMEESCAPE!!?!!?
---
I need this information,  I'm good at Doing the Objectives &amp; Hiding (Classic Claudette)  But in a chase I Crummble.
---
You can go at the speed of light if you spam attack while carrying someone. I don't think it's necessarily op but it's hilarious as fuck
---
Id usually give the Exit if 2 people dc/kill themselves.
---
Is survelliance any good? I just started playing killer and i have hunteress lvl 5 and wraith lvl 6
---
Actually he can get in trouble for tunneling across multiple games. 
---
https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000442326-Can-I-report-a-player-for-face-camping-
---
That argument goes both ways, imagine he came out good but hard to learn, everyone would be crying for buffs long before they even tried learning/mastering the character.
---
Most survivors that don‚Äôt need to earn perks can be easily countered by the killer or are just not strong enough or too situational to have to earn it. I do want most perks to be earned though, at least powerful ones.
---
Me neither, but we need to let the others know that if they start whining about Freddy, we will bully them
---
Im so confused
---
Much wow! Too bad that there‚Äôs still not too much incentive to cleanse...
---
I think you're on to something!
---
OK, So when you see 2 ppl hooked in a basement while playing against a leatherface will you rush him?
---
Because it basically makes you use less if your medkit IE the killer hits you and your on 49 hp etc you use a medkit to get to to the lowest point of the healthy stage and shit like that by the way I‚Äôm talking from my mouth
---
*encounters baby Dwight somehow in rank 10, and his entire team is dead 3 minutes into the match*
---
*picks up Dwight and fucking YEETS him at the hatch*
---
Don‚Äôt give me his name lol I‚Äôm toxic all the time as killer üòÇ as a ghostface main I tbag every chance I get
---
I don‚Äôt have the ptb as I am a console pleb but teaaa
---
I was just asking since I didn't really see how'd they give information. That's all.
---
I love when the survivor doesn‚Äôt think I know I can pick them up when they try to unhook others
---
*laughs in 2/4 dead, 1/4 hooked, 1/4 attempting rescue as I camp during gate exit opportunity*
---
LET ME OUT- LET ME OUUUUUT!!!
---
Making medkits more viable, If a killer hits someone once, Odds are he‚Äôll hit them again. Unless for your example to hold any water involves every killer to only hit players with medkits once. Additionally, the healing times with the numbers i gave would slow the healing speed, So yeah, You might wanna go brush your teeth or something, Can‚Äôt imagine how you hold conversations with that kind of mouth
---
You can find mega links for the apk &amp; obb file via Google or set your region to netherlands
---
No real incentive, so why would they?
---
It's not like they're losing money from skins being leaked, and it's not impacting the game negatively.
---
Playing tombstone and thuft of hair is a deserved mori as well
---
Snare is useless and buggy.
---
To the top with you, its bloody beautiful to see constructive stuff on here.
---
Is it just me or does huntress get way more skins than anyone else
---
Can I eat that
---
I'm not sure if it's this game or if it was Friday but I thought tunneling across multiple games was a reportable offense
---
The issue is that, to my knowledge, BHVR can't actually do anything on console
---
Some of the best post game chats are discussing with new players actions they should try to take in the future when they have the chance to. Life's too short to stay salty after all.
---
They've increased the blood points you get for cleansing them in the current PTB as well. Hopefully it pushes people to cleanse dull totems more often.
---
It's funny cuz my name is this pic
---
Bullets don't work Jon
---
Hopefully...
---
You love the snares?  I think they‚Äôre pretty frustrating to use
---
Knock out- ise the teleport mobility to deny survivors information on where you are
---
It's this community, honestly. Toxic shitheads. Killers. Survivors. All of them. I've had nothing but this kind of shit all night.
---
No Dwight why are you teabagging the Bubba at every pallet he is going to camp you oh God oh fuck no
---
Well congrats? You managed to use insta heal against wraith wow outskilled.
---
Good thing this isn't r/news
---
If they‚Äôre too good as a character it becomes too easy and boring playing as them, though. So that goes both ways.
---
I think the DBD team should just introduce a "Hardcore" game mode or something that gives EVERYONE like 25-50% more blood points and easier pips but there are NO PERKS ALLOWED. Or at least limit the perks to character unique perks
---
Finger guns and middle finger. Lol
---
Camping üò≥
---
*sees survivor trying to farm the hook rescue on a poor innocent Dwight*
---
Yare Yare daze. you can pay back what you owe... with bloodpoints!
---
*lets him unhook victim, tunnels farmer and lets victim escape*
---
Yeah he had to be a BaBy KiLlEr
---
Doesn't make it right but I can maybe see why they did it if you were actively running past gens to search chests instead. Nothing worse than having a teammate who isn't contributing to the objective
---
You've got it exactly right.
---
I don't think of swf as a top of the line military trained teams lol but  as you describe it, they will just ask their friend if they are next to them or not and that will counter it easily. Either way, hope the devs will take another look at Legion instead of ignoring him.
---
That would be pretty cool, but that would make queues more ass than they already are... rip.
---
Pyramid Head, the Demogorgon or Pinhead
---
See this is a guy I'd wanna play with.
---
My advice would to be just block him or do the ‚Äúavoid player‚Äù or whatever it is that play station has when you know it‚Äôs him. Continuously report him for harassment if need be and if worse comes to worse, change your gamertag so he won‚Äôt know it‚Äôs you.
---
Shit yeah... Also the amount of squadettes for that self heal perk xD
---
Isn't this from the original
---
This and classic Freddy please
---
*3/4 DC leaving a little baby Dwight who somehow got to rank 10 without learning anything*
---
I‚Äôm sorry little one... *raises machete, downs... then FUCKIN YEETS TO THE HATCH LOL*
---
No, he doesn't need any tweeks, he's perfectly fine as is, aside from that dream pallets should be the default. I think you should be allowed to use them as you want, since it's your goddamn powers.
---
BTW I use noed on myers because he's level 16 and I don't exactly have Better perks
---
Had someone say that to me and I replied with a joke about it being a failsafe for getting my ass handed to me by survivors. He typed "lol" and asked me if I was girl, and when I said yes he just said "o ok" and that was that???
---
Still have no idea what NOED would have to do with that lol
---
Ap Yi.
---
Swain. 
---
Nunu. 
---
Ap Xin.
---
Oh I totally agree. The match had just begun, though. That's why I was so upset
---
More survivors like him please ty
---
I mean, I did learn most of how to play survivor by watching the better players I have chased.
---
Every. Time.
---
Taken, not stirred ...
---
MOAR
---
I mean, real people look like that. I am fine with the ugly survivors because it's realistic.
---
Idk if this is a 3.1.0 glitch but I lost 2 pips from leaving a match after it ended
---
Okay thanks, that sounds about right with patrolling, ive been absolutely smoked whenever they've just played the objective.
---
You can‚Äôt get them in bloodwebs but they definitely still work
---
Agar.io killer confirmed
---
When I saw this, I said in my buddy's discord, "WHAT THE FUCK IS THE HILLBILLY"
---
Jeff skin? I NEED TO SEE THIS
---
invisible blood warden?
---
Totem indicator for survivors pleaseee we need to see how many are left
---
Stalk get tier two. try and hit and hook survivors while stalking for 3.
---
The only thing I dont think he needs are the action speed slowing add ons. Going against a Freddy with Ruin and I try to work through it like a good little survivor but with all 4 survivors starting asleep the gens were going slow anyway, then you have Ruin on top, and then you need to piss about running around to find a survivor or alarm clock every 60 seconds to wake you up. It just felt dull.
---
What I would do is I would change those add ons to Snare add ons, since everyone agrees snares are a bit shit right now. Maybe something to increase the slow or decrease the setting time.
---
Also his snare set up needs to stop cancelling if you move a fraction too far towards a wall. Its awkward for most people to use. Just lock the red set-up circle in place if it touches a wall while freddy moves like other games do.
---
You right but I just can't camp as killer, I play way too nice (no tunnel or camping) and that probably hurts my rank probably
---
I remeber the first time I played against the doctor in a kill your friends group with my internet buddies
---
I was drunk as shit and my doctor main friend kept zaping me and I was crying
---
"He keeps laughing at me, he knows Im a Virgin help."

Survivors TEND to get smarter at red ranks.  But keep in mind there are megHead survivors at all ranks
---
This was a variation for him in MKX and i always loved fighting him because he just looked fucking hilarious.
---
On ps4 the game downloads the software then the rest of the other stuff after so when I opened the game the tutorial was the only thing I could play
---
Report every foul message he sends, PSN will ban him eventually
---
Friend just tried it with Jake Park and said he heard whispers in tier 2, but couldn't make out what they were saying.
---
Feng? I find OoO is always Nea or Meg.
---
I think Freddy is just fine thx
---
Surveillance is way better. Thanatophobia isn't worth the perk slot
---
If he sends any curses over PSN, you can report them for offensive language and have their account banned.
---
Otherwise you need to record the briefing occurring over multiple games, and then send them to support otherwise BHVR are unable to act on it.
---
Points are capped at 32000, multipliers like BBQ multiply this value. So max you can get with 4 stack bbq is 64 000. Max you can get with bbq and party streamers is 96 000. So absolute max possible with bbq and 5 party atrrameds would be 192 000.
---
She look like her weeve can get snatched
---
Nice play but the head shaking is so cringey.
---
Hexy mentioned that he likes the traps for early game pressure, and pallets in late game. I think people will have to learn to use the traps appropriately, as we've never had anything like them before. Like, don't place them next to pallets, you need to slow the survivors and catch up to them before they can vault/drop pallet.
---
Don't get hit. There's no downside to being injured if you can keep a chase.
---
My mate does it when we play SWF and it pisses me off lol.
---
I actually saw a very good killer concept here, this could work with your idea: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cbfxsn/robama_killer_idea/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Yup, GF being able to be spotted behind a tree, hooked and downed Survivors ruins GF for me. So much for stealth.
---
From what ive read hes posting it on YT, if he does a series or something on it I'll be sure to sub just for that
---
&lt;3
---
Some killer players want everyone to have fun (not just themselves) and also don't want to feel like they're taking the cheap, easy way to a win
---
Totally thought GF meant girlfriend at first and I interpreted that as your girlfriend threatening you in a thong to make these cosmetics happen. 
---
I need to sleep.
---
Good job I have a vita aswell and I actually like the vita
---
&gt;My main problem with using the teleport is that I have no clue where I am going to end up.
---
This so much. At first I thought they would make it so you'll face the direction you were looking at at the time of the teleport, but that's not the case. I don't know the algorithm that decides on which side the husk will spawn yet, but it feels random and very disorientating. I guess they did that so it matches the husk's animation, but nobody will look at it that closely anyway. Please Devs, this is significant for control.
---
Like when you wanna use it in a chase, there needs to be a way for Freddy to know where he ends up and which direction he will be looking when coming out.
---
Is that... Pocahontas?
---
Guess what you‚Äôve now explained in one picture why survivor mains will forever be better then killer mains!
---
Like 8 points of Chase? Is it worth it?
---
Don't get hit then. If you need multiple chances to keep a chase with a killer , you're most likely trash.
---
Were they swf? Im on PC and played with a SWF group the other night, all rank 20s while I'm on the opposite end of the rank scale. We usually got green-rank killers. I guess the game splits the difference
---
The first time I used it I missed and was so disappointed in myself I accepted death
---
She's going through her emo furry phase

Hell if I know, I‚Äôm a killer. But I do know that‚Äôs the reason

Just dont get hooked lololololol

nah, play whatever side you find most fun
---
Every cosmetics are available at any given time except for a few. You gotta look inside the character option of the shop to find cosmetics.
---
What show is this?
---
I‚Äôm not sure honestly, didn‚Äôt seem like it to me.
---
Probably just your RNG, sometimes you get streaks of the same few maps
---
[deleted]
---
It already got given counterplay.  Now if survivors are properly doing objectives, it will never even come into play whereas if the killer is playing properly, survivors still got to use their "rewarding me for failing" perks like the old MoM and DS.
---
He really does, and if he's close to death then you can allways hit the Dc
---
"surprise, motherfucker" from doakes when he enters a lobby
---
"Somehow"
---
Swf 
---
Like when 3 rank 1 survivors bully a rank 20 killer because they have a rank 20 friend hosting swf and then shit talk post game.
---
Oh shut the fuck up about camping, obviously face camping is annoying, but if I leave the hooked survivor for 1-2 minutes they always get unhooked and tunneling is annoying if it go‚Äôs on for too long but again half of the time is killers don‚Äôt because we get flash lighted palett dropped and teabagged
---
ew no. jeff is his own soft and handsome man. his skin is the best
---
When I go against high rank survivors using a lower-ranked friend to get easy killers and Bully them... I always kill them and let the low rank get the hatch. Baby survivors are too cute to harm.
---
trolling/trying to annoy you
---
I would genuinely just be happy if he got a mask for the other survivors. I also wish he would take their hair as well to make them more discernible
---
This is a god tier meme template
---
So survivors aren't supposed to use flashlights and pallets for what they were used for? And I wasn't complaining about camping or tunneling I'm just saying that that's probably what most people did to get 4ks with Fred.
---
Because it looks good and is different from her typical loose hair or ponytails. Gives the character some variety. Although Meg's Jersey Shore haircut and neck chains look horrible no matter what cosmetic they come with.
---
A weird habit I have as a killer is if all the gens are done and I have hooked/killed three survivors and there's one more left, I close the hatch to activate the endgame timer and let the survivor get to the exit gate. When they see me tho they run, but I just stand still, doing a nod. They then open the gate and I let then leave. It's a lil bit of sympathy I have for the last one. Believe me, BBQ/Insidious/Survelliance/Ruin is a pain in the ass to play against. But if ONE person manages to survive, I let them live. Respect to that homie tho
---
No it isnt. It requires you to complete a generator and only shows belongings within ~60m of the gen you completed for *5 seconds*. One of the worst perks ever. 
---
You‚Äôre better off bringing a green map that can track killer belongings
---
yeah same here he seems pretty cool to watch
---
Kate is just a Jane that is easier to hide with, who isn't making constant noise. Jane legit sounds like a pornstar whenever the killer hits her. Which actually could be a big plus now that I think about it. Plus Kate has some badass tattoos and a pretty good backstory... Huh.. Kate does deserve more love. She seems very underrated.
---
Keep coming up with excuses for running NOED. That will surely make you better.
---
Gotta give him props for not DC‚Äôing though, people usually do that when this happens
---
Guys chill with the dislikes, he is obviously joking
---
all i asked for was manbun jeff and viking jeff, we halfway there boys
---
HAAAAAAAAAAAAW
---
Idk but hear me out do you think my killer idea is balanced 
---
ROBAMa killer Idea okay so robama‚Äôs killer perks would be Swag punch a bitch; when ROBAMa is looped for longer then a minute he gets anger holds his arm up like bubbles from trailer park boys, gets 50% speed increase and everyone gets the exposed effect for the rest of the match. Rhonda; when Jane aka big Rhonda is hooked if one person unhooks her they get the exhausted effect for two minutes and everyone is put in the one health state from and earfhquake big Rhonda made from getting off the hook and the person who saved her gets downed. ROBAMA; when a survivor starts to work on a generator ROBAMA get the options to teleport behind then and grab them off the gen, also teleport to totems when they are being cleansed. Seems like a good kiler idea to me but just want the redit upinion.
---
Yes that‚Äôs fire idea.
---
I didn‚Äôt play killer at all until GF came out, I feel you
---
Get ALMOST to tier 3, and then trigger it when close to a survivor. Best bet is if you‚Äôre near 1 or more so you can down a few at a time. Make sure you have BBQ and Ruin so you can find survivors easier and slow the game down just a little bit.
---
Me, running at a killer because I have decisive and unbreakable so I can take another hit definitely and save that other survivor
---
*misses DS, dies on hook*
---
Because arguably it is useless against survive with friends or survivors running small game. Or people who look at their surroundings and remember where pallets are like a good Survivor. If you don't plan your route and run it carefully you should be punished. Survivor shouldn't be able to Sprint off in any direction and survive a 5-minute Chase because pallets everywhere. You're in the dream world and Freddy has the power there.
---
It is too late... his fate has been sealed...
---
Well now aren‚Äôt you just a little cunt
---
Literally how i swf: any idea of what killer? doing a gen. need help? goin for the rescue.
---
I don't find it bad if they camp me during end game, i feel like it's justified in some way, but during the normal game, it gets annoying real quick
---
Mortal Kombat X had both versions of Leatherface why can‚Äôt we? Especially if licensed characters are beginning to get cosmetics!
---
I highly doubt that is the reason
---
Why is this so fucking funny üò≠

Get out of Tier 1 as fast as possible. Sometimes you'll be able to get an early gen grab if you're lucky, but if it ain't happening forget about sneaking around and stalk to get out of it quickly. Don't chase in Tier 1 either, you're incredibly slow with a super short lunge, just stalk them to get out of it.  
---
As others have said, stalk Evil II to about 95-99%, then get close to someone and pop Evil III when you know you'll get a hit and instadown them. Then repeat the process.  
---
When you're roaming around looking for people, pop stalk every now and then for just a second or two. The way it highlights survivors sometimes lets you see even the most immersed of Claudettes whereas normally you'd possibly miss them. Just remember not to do it when you're really close to Tier 3, so that you don't pop it on someone way off in the distance. 
---
The rest is just killer basics. Tracking, mind games, manipulating red stain etc, just try to get better at those.

---
There is no point in complicating it further, 103% cakes are not even on hloodweb anymore. I think perks like distressing only add to the base score (you get to 8000 faster per category) and are not applied as bonus after the match.

Freddy's was always non directional. Huntress' was added. No idea why it's written in plural though
---
I straight up agree xD
---
Yeah but 90% of the ghostface feedback was he's broken and needs to be fixed (+ devs even admitted he was buffed) and was too underpowered. His status effect crouch-hit addons were changed too. Hopefully they do that for Freddy's blocks. 
---
Anyways Freddy's feedback mostly seems to be "He's too strong!".
---
[Case in point](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/74726/freddy-rework-is-op) I mean there's plenty of people saying he's just right not to mention the PTB is a "Sterile testing environment" compared to live servers, but there's a ton of "he's OP please nerf" shit too.
---
Yes. Tenet generation has tits.
---
I have been guilty of this, there was a toxic survivor who would play swf along with instaheal and pallet teabagging while his friend would be lurking with instaflashlight
---
Mind you this was before MoM nerf so he would have, OoO, adrenaline, MoM and DS and would deliberately go in chases with me.
---
I avoided his BMing and Toxic chats at first but then instead of replying I came up with best reply. 
---
As soon as he will enter my lobby, I will put on a green mori. And hunt him down first easliy thanks to his own OoO and facecamp for 2 mins until I would spot his friend. As soon as he would appear, I will give him a window to reach the hook only to down my main prey again and then InstaMori him.
---
His toxic rants became more enjoyable after that.
---
No, downvotes usually mean people don't take advice and just are to ignorant to actually try it instead of whining how unfair it is when they play Freddy! Meanwhile I get 45k+ BP every game with him and 3/4 of my games end in 4k matches! So yeah, I clearly don't know what I'm talking about...
---
- You really believe downvotes on one of the most toxic subreddits on Earth mean something to me?
---
Bubbette
---
Sure ty for keeping me updated btw i think you are 10 or 12 yo but ye keep calling other kiddo and you Said ghost myers freddy is crutch or you probably meant only ghost is crutch but then you need to learn how to write, but its ok you are young you will learn
---
Oh... Ok and even when he teleports thru the pallet?
---
You're saying that like camping with freddy is a good strategy
---
PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY CRYING THAT HE IS OP?  THEY LITERALLY MADE HIS POWER WORSE. NO NEED TO WAKE MYSELF UP NOW.
---
Yup so true. Although the past few days has been really bad for survivors arguing amongst themselves in post game chat for me.
---
If he face camps just do gens, quit being a baby if he wants to play the game like that (yes being a dick) then he‚Äôs allowed to play like this, he‚Äôs not breaking any rules, he‚Äôs not exploiting he‚Äôs just hurting your feelings so instead of being a little bitch just move on to the next game.
---
Only the gen you are facing becomes white, so you know in which one you will teleport. You can't teleport in closed gens I think.
---
But I think there should be more nuance to that, because lets say the exit gates are open, there are 3 survivors unhooked and you hook one. There I can understand facecamping. 
---
Or obviously if you hook someone and you see two Megs running around the hook. There I could also understand not leaving the hook.
---
But outside of that I dont understand how facecamping is oo, it literally prevents the survivors from playing the game. And, unless you're SWF, the killer is 100% gonna win because your teammates instead of genrushing are going to try to get you.
---
You must be fun at parties.... he explained how the bp are calculated, no need to go the extra mile for 3%. This aint science.
---
10 snares at a time is a bit much imo. That‚Äôs the only ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù I have about the rework. He got the buff he deserved.
---
The guy was confused how points are capped. I explained it to him and brought him examples with clear numbers. Now stop complaining and go back to your kiddie corner, I will not respond to you again.
---
HELL, I'M RANK 10 AND WHEN I SEE A NURSE I THINK WELP, EASY GAME. HONESTLY I CAN'T SEEM TO SURVIVE A HAG FOR SOME REASON LATELY AND HAVE BEEN FACING HER A LOT MORE.
---
I really don‚Äôt know what to tell you because I can‚Äôt do anything about it I‚Äôm just a person who plays the game. I also play on ps4 what rank are you? I hope I don‚Äôt run into this raith.
---
Extra mile? Its 3 fucking percent. Hop off me
---
I hope you solve your problems
---
&gt; Yare Yare daze.
---
I will use my stand **„ÄåTunneler„Äç** to defeat you vile farmers.
---
HIS ANIMATIONS ARE GORGEOUS AND HE CAN AMBUSH YOU WITH PROJECTION OF YOU DO NOT PAY ATTENTION, ALSO YOU CAN GET FUCKED BY DREAM TRAPS, NOT TO MENTION SOME OF HIS ADDONS SLOW YOUR REPAIR SPEED SO YOU WILL HAVE TO WAKE UP
---
Yeah, but as OP said, it gets confusing. You can miss a yellow gen because it goes white due to the power, meaning you could be looking at a regressing gen if you have surveillance, or a gen being worked on with tremors, and not know if someone is working on it.
---
Yeah I know but I think it should have more risk for the killer, now is free on solo queue since you cant tell your teammates to genrush. Or at least make it so if a  survivor is hardcore facecamped you get a safety pip. Im tired of deranking because of this.
---
I hate seeing the pig,ugliest character ever
---
Can I ask for a link or something where they said that? I was trying to prove a point to someone but couldn‚Äôt actually find anything
---
I know I was just giving my 2 cents. He's rank 11.
---
It's also worth pointing out that there are five teams per round of Dead by Daylight (one for the killer, and one for each survivor), as the game is designed, it's impossible to be a liability to "the team" in the context the title is implying, especially if you're the kind of survivor to waste pallets repeatedly.
---
I don‚Äôt actually have the link but I‚Äôm pretty sure I saw it somewhere and u can ask almost anyone that plays the game they will tell you that camping is no reportable.
---
It‚Äôs you who has problems üòÇ It‚Äôs a game what you are saying is like the equivalent to killers complaining about 4 gens being done within 3 mins . ‚ÄúThese guys gen rushed so I‚Äôm gonna report them because they hurt my feelings and ruined my game‚Äù is exactly what you are saying ‚ÄúI died early and can‚Äôt escape so i should be able to report him‚Äù
---
THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD FUCK ME IS THE FAKE PALLETS, BUT IF I PAY ATTENTION TO WHICH ONES WERE ALREADY BROKEN THAT WONT MATTER. I DONT MIND SLOWER REPAIR SPEED AS LONG AS IT'S NOT 50%. MAKES THE GAME A LITTLE LONGER. I HOPE THEY DONT TOUCH HIM. HE'S NOT OP, JUST DIFFERENT.
---
Like I said, I was trying to prove a point. The guy said camping is reportable. I said that the devs said its not reportable. He said link it. Now here I am
---
Fuck off
---
I would delete this post, because you are promoting cheats
---
"We wanted to stay true to the lore by including the Dream Warriors..."
---
I still think it's useful because even if the survivors can hit greats ruin stops them from getting the progression bonus

Yeah i meant lower ranks (currently rank 13 and still having exciting and fun games)

Because it's their fault for putting things like this into a build the public are going to use. They know this happens every time so clearly they're okay with it by this point.
---
But on the other hand, you're the kind of moron that thinks Speed Limiter is a good addon. I think, on balance, I'd prefer to be me rather than you, because at least I can fucking add up.
---
I'm not going to review your post history to determine whether this is an aberration or if you are just normally this stupid, because that's a weird thing to do.
---
Lmao at people in this thread saying "aww you can't deal with it?" Just sort of proving OP right here

Ruin, bbq and pgtw is my go to build. Usually switch between thrilling tremors or bamboozle for my fourth perk.

Sounds like someone just got a spanking from Fred.
---
The impressive thing is that the cocky survivor got his comeuppance.
---
It took hours to lvl her up and I get nothing in return :(
---
Nothing to be helped here. It's a perk available to you, use it as you see fit. Don't think survivor players would do anything else.
---
OP is salty survivor main

Well, it is mobile and it‚Äôs only in beta, you can probably prestige her when it‚Äôs in alpha

Why would you camp as Freddy?  
---
\- You can just walk up hook save and walk away he has 7s. to stand around doing nothing.
---
you say gf in a thong, i say completely naked michael and freddy
---
Sometimes you need to negate the meta and try some fun-meme builds. Iron grasp +Agitation+ Mad grit +infectious fright on invisible Freddy while carrying survivor. Just thinking about it gives me suicidal thoughts
---
Killers don't need an "excuse" to play the game and kill you. Stop whining about dying.
---
On one hand, these are very good and informative, I really like them.
---
On the other hand, 90% of the tips center around running in circles. That's not OP's fault, but it still makes me sad. In an ideal version of DBD, hiding should be at least as good as looping.
---
If i remember correctly in a Q&amp;A the devs said the game wouldn't have cross progression
---
Alpha is before beta
---
Tunneling and face camping themselves are not reportable however if it's done to grief other players it falls under the griefing category which is reportable. Gather as much proof as possible and report him.
---
Whoops you are right, I‚Äôm dumb lol
---
Sure. 
---
Also how long have you been playing the gane the perks are super weak and the power is as well? 
---
Im getting tired of these concepts that are obviously flawed and wouldnt work being posted every 20 minutes.
---
WRILLEX
---
Had this experience. Got insta-downed and mori‚Äôd immediately at the beginning of the game. Decided to take a walk outside and came back to see ‚ÄúGG EZ. Went for the adept achievement.‚Äù
---
Yes, insta-down hatchets and a mori is going to just GIVE YOU a merciless victory because you shut the game down in 2 minutes, even though merciless needs you to stretch the game out, use your power, win chases, get multiple hooks and stay away, alongside a number of other time related things, but you know, gotta say ‚ÄúGG EZ‚Äù for the one down hatchets you can‚Äôt hit unless you‚Äôre literally on top of someone.
---
Nice, I avoided FOV perks for the longest, but I‚Äôve heard they come in handy for mike and GF, definitely considering giving one a try
---
Hits both skill checks and immediately has to leave because killer has decided that he was all outa gum
---
I can assure you, most Huntress players also find Iri Head to be busted and unfun
---
&gt; I quit using Ruin
---
There's your answer.
---
I might not be rank 20 anymore but I'm a Baby Dwight and always get killed :( I even have the red hat and Pizza shirt to show that I'm a Baby Dwight
---
Aaawwww (?)
---
&gt; If you're good enough to make people quit
---
I'd say it's closer to the bottom of the list of reasons why people DC
---
My signature move is the tbag in a circle while looking up. It makes for a very hilarious look on most characters.
---
You're in luck! Some changes coming soon that should help alleviate the issue.
---
&gt; Following the migration to dedicated servers, we will be better able to detect who is at fault and handle the situation accordingly. Since all players are connected to a server rather than directly to one another, if one player experiences a connection issue, we can be sure that the connection issue lies between them and the server.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; This also gives us an opportunity to strengthen the way we handle disconnections. **Survivors who disconnect from a match will leave a ‚Äúhusk‚Äù behind. The Killer can then hook and sacrifice this husk to receive the points- and perk tokens where applicable**- that they would have earned had the Survivor continued playing.
---

---
Michael can be a bit tricky to use since hes purely an M1 killer. Learning how to mindgame and manipulating your red stain is the best tool in your kit for him. 
---
Strategy? He usually has a very basic game plan. Get out of tier 1 asap, then start going for chases in tier 2. Best times to stalk are when they drop down a pallet or hop through a window. Go for hits when you can but your goal is to get your tier 3 at 99% for your next chase or for pressure.
---
Perks? 
---
-Save the best for last allows you to keep pressure during chases and punush tiny mistakes by survivours. You can one shot your obsession to keep alot of your stacks. Very underrated perk
---
-Infectious Fright (Plauge perk). Allows you to use your tier 3 to its max potential. Survivours will scream in fear when you down someone and thier with in your terror radius.
---
-Ruin. (The hag) Its ruin. Pretty much needed past rank 9. Only about 20% or players can consistently hit great skill checks so its really good for slowing the game down
---
Moniter and abuse (Doctor) [optional]. Incresses his stealth potential and increaaes your terror radius in chase for Infectious Fright.
---
Add ons? Something to make you stalk survivours faster and Dead rabbit for MORE terror radius in chase.
---
I dont use Mikey alot alot but this is the set up I use. Hope it helps
---
You are very much supporting cheating.
---
*Gamma lol
---
Use corrupt intervention or PGTW instead to slow the game down just a lil but
---
Wow I love this guys nba videos, never knew he played dbd haha. That‚Äôs awesome
---
So....i hate to tell you but you cant camp with pre re-work freddy. Just FYI.
---
Little did he know, that pallet was destroyed earlier when the P3 Claudette dropped it within the first minute against reworked Freddy
---
Meaning?
---
How do I get others as it's been the same for 3 weeks now, i only got purgatation once and the map that came with the legion.
---
I really want the hospital ma but will there ever be a map vote system?
---
Ok but do you play against him often cuz this post is giving me that kind of vibe. If so then how?
---
She got hit by those pallets way too many times
---
For me it's the legion, with leather face at least you can get a 4 one shot, one in life but it's posible
---
Does this affect console? Unfortunately on console we haven't even got dedicated servers yet
---
*Approving oink*
---
Check his Reddit bio. He streams on Twitch.
---
Well you can use a map offering, for hospital it‚Äôs the glasses, but otherwise it‚Äôs just rng
---
Don't bother it will be the ghostface situation all over again
---
LoS breaking is very efficient against Nurses. It makes me so fucking angry when people do it against me, but it is so fun to do it against them
---
Just for explicit clarity that this will be the standard for current and future killers (should they have lullabye-type terror radiuses), I imagine
---
even in red and purple ranks its usually Clauds or Neas
---
Baby survivors always deserve hatch &lt;3
---
I still remember my third game where a full p3 Hag gave me (an immersed Claudette) the hatch.. I still remember you dude! Ily
---
When people DC vs you it doesn't necessarily mean you're "too good" for them. It can be obnoxious build you're using (on top of killer-sided map), extra bad connection, they're tilted (for any reason, not even DbD related).
---
How is Windows of opportunity working with fake pallets?
---
Can you vault faster too or is it just for blocking?
---
It's because he was released as a very annoying character and even though he has been changed a lot some people can't let go off the past. 
---
He's quite a balanced killer now.
---
Nah at this point its intentional just to hype up new skins
---
I rly like to play him but everytime i get kys legion sucks its annoying
---
That all depends on your rank. At low ranks legion and trapper are godlike but pit them in red ranks and legion just barely squeezes by as better than trapper though both are pretty low tier

---
I think they should remove it being a hex totem and instead make it a token based perk. One token per hook. Two tokens for one instadown in egc. Four tokens for two instadowns. Etc. Then it just becomes a rewarding perk instead of what everyone sees as a "cheap win."
---
Why are you allowing a game to cause you anxiety and stress when there are literally so many more perks you can choose from? If it‚Äôs bothering your that much, don‚Äôt use it. All Ruin does is buy you about thirty more seconds to two more minutes because once the survivors realize you have that perk, all four of them search around for that totem and immediately cleanse it. It‚Äôs even worse if they are playing as a group and in a party together. And if you waste your time trying to protect it, they can just work on the generators and finish them anyway, even though it may take them longer. Just don‚Äôt use it and stop stressing like that over a video game.
---
What‚Äôs your psn? Maybe we can play this sometime
---
I'm sorry Jon, I was **so** hungry
---
Just played a match against a Doc with Calm and Obedience carters notes (both very rare) addons and once we hit 3rd stage madness we couldn't interact with anything. No prompt to use dead hard, nor to wiggle or heal or snap out of it. Just putting it out there in case anyone else has encountered this. We were able to attempt escape though, once hooked.
---
Even as a former rank 2 survivor this guide is very useful for experienced players and easy enough for new players to understand
---
I mean, I figured I was missing something. I just honestly couldn't tell with the wording which was why I added a little story to it/something fun to try.
---
It also doesn't hurt to help fill in some details incase they genuinely didn't know there were 5.
---
I can think of at least two reasons killer goes after you after unhook.
---
1 you ran to the weaker side of the map, where traps are or pallets done, etc, etc
---
2 I personally like having people dead on hook, that makes them usually play slower, doubting if they should go for the rescue etc.
---
You can never actually be sure he moris you, and if you dc, you leave your teammates in a weaker spot.
---
I would agree with you in terms of polish, the devs put way more effort into the pallets than the snares, however gameplay wise the chanel to place them can be aliviated by just predicting when you intend to use them in advance, and the 1 second arm time is neccesary to prevent placeimg them at survivors feet just before hit. Although going around the trap mitigates, in most scenarios you can still land the hit as you can go through the puddle but survs cant. Also the slow time is 3 seconds and not less than 2 seconds.
---
Still i feel freddys strength isnt strong enough in the dream world, snares still are only a slightly different clown and pallets are not reliable enough to be a good alternative. In my opinion freddy should have a smaller amount of pallets (say 4) along with snares base, and the snares themselves should be harder to see and should be outlined for freddy like trapper and hag traps. A lot of the time you find a survivor if you dont land the first hit your going to waste a lot of time chaseing them which is very anoying and i dont think freddys power is strong enough to counteract this.
---
Its one of my complaints with Dream Master as well. Where as in Dream Warriors, Nancy was killed off at the very end, Dream Masters just felt like a very sore attempt at a shock at the beginning of the movie. Nancy's death felt more earned as she died swinging like we've come to expect of Nancy, and because this character honestly had an impact in the movie, even if she wasn't the Final Girl.
---
Like the guy above said, it doesn't matter where you switch vs a good nurse unless you have a godly structure at your disposal. A good nurse will use their first blink to have a good angle on you, that means going to a place where they can just see you and you can't hide, and then their second to get in and hit you.
---
This meme is offensive, please remove it. How dare you even compare our lord and savior Norville Rogers to the parasite called The Legion.
---
Not everyone disconnects because your ‚Äútoo good.‚Äù I never rage quit, as it is just stupid to do so. You don‚Äôt get any points at all, and the 2k points I receive for dying in the first 3 minutes is better than nothing. When I disconnect, it‚Äôs usually because of bad connection or power outages and things like that. Stop being a cry baby, get your points, and move on to the next game.
---

Find a pal to play with swf isn't some tactical espionage like it gets plastered here. Don't have a pal? Just message GG to players when you mean it and most players respond back with kindness then ask if they wanna play a couple games :)

Good point. Yeah not being alerted would be good
---
I know it was just a typo but ‚Äòsharts to blood‚Äô is killing me
---
Yeah, that's DBD for you, 90% of what a good survivor will do is run around in circles. Since survivors' hitboxes are smaller than killers' and they literally have a function to run perfectly aligned to structures, running around something is much more ideal than running out in the open, since killers have to make wider turns and because of their bigger hitbox they have to run around a longer perimeter.
---
Exactly, thank you. People rarely ragequit because "oh no this killer is just too good for me!" In fact, even if you are good, ragequitters will always have an excuse in their mind that tells them you're not. They get frustrated over whatever happened and either don't want to deal with it, or want to get a reaction from the killer by leaving.
---
You tell me https://i.redd.it/tl9nfrm5h5j21.jpg
---
It‚Äôs because when he was first released, he was faster than the other killers and vaults and pallets didn‚Äôt really effect him because when he went over them, he was just as quick as the survivors so you were downed a lot faster with him than any other killer and it was quite annoying. He was super buffed so a lot of survivors mains cried about it. I‚Äôm a survivor main, and it was tremendously annoying but they really balanced him out. For me, he‚Äôs one of the easiest ones to escape from now.
---
You're getting downvoted for raining on the meme parade, but you're right, I saw the same story.
---
It's crazy to me how different foods go from super-food ultra-health to "it will kill you even in small amounts, stay away" in the span of a decade.
---
David x Jake is the bets ship
---
This is so good
---
Regardless of the reason, there should be some penalty for doing so, and a way to get what you need from that survivor. What the other person commented saying is a good idea, that way the survivor can leave and the killer gets what they need from them
---
I haven't thought about it! Maybe it can tell you which are real! Windows of Opportunity Meta inc!
---
I‚Äôm saving a shard just to try out new freddy once released. Want to see if it‚Äôs worth the buy.
---
Is it possible to make ones for Legion and Clown
---
Didnt they make the hitbox of killer smaller just to get rid of that?
---
It doesn't show which one is true and which one is fake.
---
Me: buy 5 copies of DBD during the summer sale to play with friends in KYF and SWF (each being the Halloween ver. with one killer of each of their choosing

Ayye it‚Äôs 4 AM here as well!!

As someone who can't play the ptb and is a survivor  just give Freddie a month out in the public without anything I'm sure people will learn the counter eventually and if he turns out after that month he needs a nerf/buff then do it then?
---
they had us in the first third, not gonna lie
---
Sad. It's so specific that it should imo.
---
Will you be doing the killer skins too?
---
Oh ho!  I see what you did there ;)
---
that‚Äôs cute(‚âß‚àÄ‚â¶)
---
&gt; there should be some penalty for doing so
---
There is a penalty for DCed player. What you want is a reward for a killer. BTW, what about other players? They don't get even "quitter bonus" right now.

LOL I seriously think you had to channel Mariah Carey for that scream though!

Yes sir legion I am currently in a locker pretending to be baby dweet my plan is to get save the best for last and rain hell when they are all on the same gen
---
You see, this would be everyones reaction if survivors had to actually survive. If the killers were terrifyingly strong
---
Now all i can imagine is them saying ‚Äúweird that they allowed 5 of us in this time‚Äù and then getting shanked from behind simultaneously.
---
Lmao
---
I mean-
---
You aren't wrong-
---
I ways give hatch if they‚Äôre not toxic. If they are i close it and patrol the doors until endgame kills them.
---
Wrong sub
---
I have the same problem. I hate the map and usually bring one in just so i can drop it for something better. Always keep my rainbow maps though.
---
Not everyone is pretty, just accept it
---
One of the things that I really gotta compliment this game in is that they do a really good job of giving you hope, just to have it snatched from you. There's almost always SOMETHING that can be a saving grace, or you can just get SO CLOSE to the exit like this, then it gets snatched away. 
---
And when it works, it's AMAZING. The last second DS followed by a Body Block to the exit is SO FUN, ot in this case, even just seeing the door open and victory is a couple feet away. And when you die, you can let the excitement cool down, maybe laugh it off if you have an attitude as good as yours, and go for it again. It still can be fun. I love it.
---
Imo it‚Äôs when the killer sees multiple people but goes for the hooked guy anyway.
---
This is fucking great
---
Why is breakdown 2700 shards?
---
Thrill of the hunt billy's exactly that
---
Hot
---
Yeah and I get it, I loop myself. It's just sad that there is not a good alternative at the moment. If they'd make stealth worth it (gain survival points for being stealthy for instance), it could change and make things more interesting.
---
Good to know my main‚Äôs perk is useful to you Ghost Face mains.
---
BBQ or PGTW, Ruin, Haunted ground, Nurses calling.
---
Doctor is still best anti stealth killer so he has his use. His add-ons are ok but nothing much. Shock can be used on some loops but is useless most of the time.
---
Bubba has one shot but its not easy to land. You can still zone pallets with it so it has its uses especially with good add-ons.
---
Legion gets first free hit but as you go up in rank it gets harder and harder to chain hits making his stall really unreliable. Blades and cooldown and duration help with that but dont do anything to actually down.
---
Trapper is really add-ons dependent his best add-ons put him (in my opinion) far above trash tier. Not only you waste less to no time with traps you can deny strong structures. With weaker add-ons you have to depend on survivors not following you to disarm traps.
---
Wraith got a lot worse with enduring not affecting pallet stuns while invisible but once that gets fixed he will jump above trash tier again.
---
I didnt include Pig in trash tier since her trap give rng dependent stall. In one game she is trash tier in other they will not get traps off untill last box and she is pretty ok. On average it should be enought.
---
I've brought this up before, but yeah you can see the survivors silhouette on the Gen if they are between it and you
---
Hey I got those cosmetics too, how did we get those?
---
They really need to crack down on the toxicity in this community. It way too out of hand. Not talking about camping, tunneling, insta heals and tea bagging. Things like OP mentioned, survivours working for killers, post game chat harassment, shit like that.
---
Usually the people telling you to suck it up are the toxic ones themselves. Don't listen to them.
---
I hope this dude doesn‚Äôt live in shared housing of any type wow that was loud AF
---
Most likely. They were part of the loading screen for the anniversary right?
---
I believe so!
---
That should be an subreddit of its own.
---
The old one was more like the original. The new power is more like the remake. It really fit.
---
I don't think he's gonna do very well in red ranks anyway, but he is really nice now
---
If you have found the captioned version I can remove the texts
---
A face not even a mother could love
---
Neat! You could also add on to these guides with advanced gameplay. For instance, the tip about reading behaviour and not dropping your first pallet to see what the killer does, obviously opens the realm of pallet play mindgames, where a survivor can drop their first pallet(s) very early, to try to condition the killer to respect pallets against them - then abusing that respect to get more loops later on; or vice-versa, playing the first pallets very greedily, to condition the killer to disrespect them - then abusing that disrespect to get stuns later on; likewise, the killer can start out respecting pallets, conditioning the survivor to play pallets more greedily - then abusing that greed later on; and vice-versa; and so on. (If the killer has Enduring, playing for stuns is never really worth it however, especially given the existence of Spirit Fury. So if they don't respect pallets and don't swing too early either, dropping it when you need to is the only real play, with the exception of course of how killer powers play into that decision.)
---
More advanced aspects of pallet play would be stuff like using pallet pull and vault prompt ranges to your advantage, as well as more advanced mindgames on dropped pallet play, where you would run from the pallet baiting the killer into thinking you are comitting and following you, then doubling-back into the pallet vault (where prompt range comes in handy again as well).
---
Wtf from the thumbnail I thought this was some old school horror fan made film shot from a first person perspective with your hand reaching out for mercy...
---
The Doctor didn‚Äôt get any closer and you tickled him then I got it!
---
I think my highest is about 212k points. BBQ, double BP event and 3 or 4 party streamers.
---
So are you complaining about losing to trash? You should probably get better.
---
Instead of complaining Freddy has multiple abilities we should complain the others have one \^\_\^
---
I dont think they should. Thrilling tremors is crazy strong on him and it should take skill to use imo
---
I wake up in a cold sweat from it
---
Doubling door opening time with aura reading and free deerstalker is much better at endgame than being an M1 killer.
---
You have to remember other BP perks like distressing and hex: thrill of the hunt
---
This very well done
---
Not every human is pretty and perfect, just accept that ;)
---
Hahaha ya even I thought ‚ÄúHuh. Kinda my hand look like from a horror film!‚Äù
---
Yea, that's why playing killer in red ranks is super stressful, they are just terrbile people who are sure they are the best players in the game while actually the game is in their favour. Then they call you trash and tell to KYS, almost every match
---
What does RNG mean lol I'm new to this.
---

---
Thank you!
---
It's basically when you just dont care about the other 3 survivors and only target that one like they can unhook in front of you and you only go for the hooked person. Imo that's tunneling
---
This is why you need to look behind you when you run. You can dodge hits with a properly time juke, but only if you're watching properly.
---
They are regular cosmetics that are unlocked from the beginning on I think
---
big brain plays
---
*sneaking into the basement to heal and hearing killer coming closer and entering the basement because he has Nurses calling*
---
Killer main here.
---
Good diagram, my dude. It's pretty accurate. One thing to look out for are wildcard killers that will completely change their playstyle depending on the survivor's playstyle.
---
And for extra fun, try using only those two perks and no items in a game!
---
They're gonna be the next 2 weeks back-to-back since all the other outfits are out
---
gg ez
---
Random Number Generator, fancy way to say the outcome of something in a game is random
---
Thank you very much for your explanation, have a great day :)
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but those help you reach the gap 8000 faster, they don't multiply the post-game score.
---
He was worse than the old Freddy. Bubba, Doctor and Legion are the complete garbage imo
---
happy cake day good person
---
Survive with Friends is definitely a mixed bag. 
---
Sometimes you'll get a group of idiots who don't know what they're doing or play so suicidely altruistically that they throw the whole game. And then you get the 'OTHER' SWF team. 
---
But communication, no matter how minor it may seem, can make a huge difference in how the game goes. Early confirmation on who  the Killer is, small details about their movements, and what perks they may or may not be running are all important pieces of information, and you'll adjust accordingly. All stealth Killers will immediately lose any (or almost all) element of surprise, as you were away of their presence, making you more vigilant in your watching. 
---
You don't have to be The Depip Squad for SWF to increase your chances of winning. Just having the ability to know where your teammates are and what they're doing can be enough coordination to make the Killer's job an incredible feat in frustration. 
---
Then, of course, there are those that purposefully troll the Killer, which help give SWF its bad name. 
---
Every time you face a SWF team, you're taking a gamble. And if you lose that gamble, you're in for a real pain.
---
I'd rather not take the chance.
---
I've been on both, it just depends on which kind of people you're teaming with.
---
Most of the time, yeah, it looks like the second but...
---
If you can find people that are smart, know what they're doing and want to win, first panel will happen naturally. You'll ask each other what perks they're using and then you'll start sharing on what everyone can do best and what items you're going to bring. You tend to escape with 4 people about 90-95% of the time with this kind of teams, depending on totem RNG, NOED totem RNG, face campers, etc.
---
In the ptb he seems meh I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs gonna be in the top 5 but he will at least be viable-ish
---
Depends on the survivors.  I don't even bother looking for it anymore, I just power through it and hope I see it on my way to the next gen or someone else finds it
---
Haha guys look at me I did the funny twitch reference üòÇüëå
---
Thanks for the info. I can't wait to try this out
---
If they did that well then they'd see how actually broken this game is. With survivors being bold and showing themselves all the time, it can be impossible to win some games. Now imagine if on top of all the chases you had to spend time searching immersed survivors... yeah.
---
Thanks, can't wait to try these out
---
Currently a glitch on ps4....
---
r/imsorryjon
---
Bamboozel
---
The objective isn't popping the gens, that's a means to an end, which is surviving/escaping.
---
After i finish rendering survivor video.. yes. Hag and nurse seem so good
---
Or bug should I say
---
I only posted this because I said I would last time someone posted this exact meme for ghostface lmao
---
I still use it but I don't bother checking it at the start unless it's really close to a gen.  You could use some other alternatives to slowing the game down though like Corrupt Intervention or PGtW.  Ruin is unfortunately a gamble.  All hexes are.  You could slightly extend the length on it with Haunted Ground but once they're both down you're basically playing the game out with two perks.
---
One more thing, if you're at a tile and are being mindgamed, don't stand in the middle of the long wall, because you'll have to turn your camera a lot more. Rather, stand at the corner and you'll have easy sight of both pathways
---
I found out Nurses Calling is really good on him because face it, you're in night shroud mode as much as possible, and no TR means 
---
smart survivors can't figure out to abort the heal if they assume you have nurses.
---
What
---
Your username tells me you might play killer a lot. I play survivor but even after hundreds of hours with this game I still have these hype moments by myself.
---
Head on
---
Just cleanse lol
---
Yoooo what the heck! The real scooter macgruder plays dbd now? What‚Äôs ur twitch?
---
Also, if the nurse is using range add-ons, then her second blink will hit you before you even have time to react. That's why omegablink is so broken, and getting nerfed.
---
&gt; High ranks partnered with low ranks so they can get lower-ranked killers and Bully them, overpowered item
---
Lol. Or you know, they are friends. Not everything is a conspiracy against you, loosen your foil hat a bit.
---
That's what.. she said?
---
Breakdown would be OP if everyone ran it.
---
Ah, my mistake, my friend who plays PC said they're out on PC, might just be trying to convert me, who knows
---
Thought the beard was a noose
---
Why does truetalent get black pips when he gets 4 kills then?
---
Please
---
Flashlights doesn't work on madness 3
---
Well...you know what I meanüôÉ
---
They are a couple, they both skip leg days... But she's literally floating and blinking so she doesn't need legs
---
Sure you can. You'll never be able to not get looped, but half the things on this list are how to punish mistakes as killer. Don't respect pallets, don't swing thru every one, hold tight angles around obstacles and play your red stain smart, and you'll do fine.
---
What's the penalty? Losing a pip? A lot of people don't care about pipping, there's no incentive to even pip/maintain a good rank anyway. Yeah, you're right, it's not fair for the other survivors either, it ruins it for everyone. Although people leave the game mostly when they get picked up and they're on death hook.
---
Isn‚Äôt that what the ptb is for though.
---
You do realise that all killers can get 4 kills above red ranks, right?
---
Lol, I baited a Claudette with Spirit's phase, she didn't even know I was just standing there, I beat her ass.
---
@DiamondPelel &amp; @firecracker786
---
Isn't it logical to go for the weakest link? I understand that it's not fun for the Survivor in question, but from a logical standpoint why chase a guy that needs 2 hits if there is a guy there who only needs one.
---
Look I never camp a hook, but I swing by it from time to time if you rescue a person while I'm near that is on you and even though BBQ would compel me to go for the rescuer first to get that extra token, if it's an easy swing I'll take it.
---
We're assuming everyone has adrenaline since the original comment assumed that also. They wouldn't be asleep as the adrenaline woke them up, and they'd rush a door. Let's also assume Freddy was also already in a chase. Now he has to give the survivor an extra 8 seconds of God mode, and hit them twice again. Unless you completely break chase to check the doors, those survivors are probably gonna have them open by the end of that chase. Then what? If they have borrowed time too, and you hook them anywhere near a door, you can't even camp them. Another free 8 seconds of God mode plus BT? Yeah, no. Give me the Freddy that doesn't have to wait to hit people. And you're wrong, doors took 50% longer to open which isn't double.
---
Don't tell the dev's Trapper's S tier. They might nerf my boi.
---
Try spirit fury + enduring Kappa
---
I did not know that. Thanks. Why doesn't it work?
---
It's not supposed to be fair, the survivors aren't meant to get found, pallets and Windows are supposed to let you lose the killer, not make him chase 1 person for the whole game
---
Zubatlel is arguably the best player out there, both on survivor and killer. He's got a bunch of vods up as well, as he doing 100 days in a row of streaming.
---
The head is nice but I'm not a big fan of it
---
that is exactly what we need. That is not breaking or nerfing the totems in any state but just shows how many totems are left in the trial.
---
This is painfully familiar. Always love to get that split second of hope right at the end.
---
i think that just means that the speed boost wasnt active
---
You complain about him playing game? What?
---
I‚Äôm playing at like rank 18 right now perks and stuff aren‚Äôr super important. Plus knowing how the base is can tell if it will be op or underpowered.
---
Mainly because the only thing you can do in madness 3 is snap out of it, no items, no repairing, no healing, etc
---
You can still vault windows and drop/vault pallets, but nothing objective wise
---
As a Kate main, I noticed many killers leave me the hatch, if you play on PS4 maybe one of them was you! But why Kate though?
---
EVEN THOUGH I WENT TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE MAP FROM WHERE THE PERSON GOT UNHOOKED THEY JUST HAPPENED TO BE OVER THERE AND THEN THEY GOT DOWNED A THIRD TIME AND NOW I'VE BEEN REPORTED FOR TUNNELLING AND WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? JUST LET YOU GO BECAUSE I HAVE ALREADY HOOKED YOU? I'M NOT HUNTING YOU SPECIFICALLY BUT IF YOU GET IN THE WAY OF MY KNIFE THEN YES YOU'RE GETTING THE STABBINGS FUCKING DEAL WITH IT!
---
Getting looped forever and not being able to do anything about it, since most loops have no counterplay, being teabagged and trash talked in the end game chat
---
And people say Fortnite is infested with 12 year olds ^^
---
See that's the difference then, I would rather make sure everyone has fun because at the end of the day it is just a game to me, I get where you're coming from but I'd rather not let the survivor get no points for just trying to play.
---
An organized swf is borderline OP.  Most swf are boosted.  Avoid the one survivor who keeps waving at you to chase them.
---
Well now I know why ochido boi likes 1:10, it‚Äôs a claudette spamming flashlight
---
Add prestige clothes and you have 99% of his playstyle
---
Don't forget DCing when he gets outplayed.
---
My friend refuses to actually attack anyone until 2/3 gens are done on KYF. Instead, he just follows us zapping. Didnt even know what was going on the first time
---
Some of that is redundant; they are just part of the sleep mechanic. It's like saying clown can throw bottles AND can mix new bottles AND gets a ping noise when a bottle is fully charged. It's also not necessarily related to age. Doctor's power has a lot going on and is older than clown. 
---
Trapper's power is slow but it's not garbage. 1-2 good traps can win you the game.
---
He's just really annoying to go against because you constantly have to mend, if you're in his terror radius when someone gets hit by Feral Frenzy he gets wallhacks, and if you're unlucky enough to be the last one to get hit then you get tunneled because that's just how the Legion is meant to be played. He's not OP, just really annoying and unfun to go against like Ghostface or the Pig. I don't like sneaky killers they always scare the shit outta me. I can never seem to break Ghostface out of Night Shroud :(
---
Manipulating your red light is half the battle; knowing what to not bother kicking unsafe pallets, knowing tiles and small tricks, zoning, forcing strong pallet drops, not letting yourself get juked
---
There is a lot even a basic M1 Wraith can do in many circumstances. It's when the map's stacked against you is when you're fucked.
---
I‚Äôm so glad he was yeeted out of the dbd community, was even happier when I found out he couldn‚Äôt play console either, cause I play pa4 and didn‚Äôt want to have to personally deal with him
---
Nah, at this point I just hope the person playing fucking sucks. Also, he just has so many aspects to his powers that it feels like future killers will be underpowered with their skillset.
---
Looking at your BPs you didn't do too well...
---
Black Canary lookin ass
---
In a PvP game there will always be a loser, losing isn't fun. But in DBD it's important to consider what losing actually is. If you get decent BP and a pip even though you where tunneled... Didn't you technically still win?
---
Like with a killer if you get 2k in a game but top the BP charts and don't lose a pip isn't that still a good game?
---
A win doesn't mean you completely humiliated the Survivors/Killer it's the end score and your advancement that shows who won. In the higher ranks you can Gen Rush and end the game in 3-4m. flat and you will earn little to no BP and don't get pips. That is a loss no matter how good you did!
---
I used to do this all the time but I‚Äôd always get pointed at or get sent messages asking why I was bothering with a dull totem.
---
Unless you're killer, the map has a ton of safe pallets.
---
[Ruin, slowing the game down...](https://youtu.be/GllEDACUbNo)
---
It's sad that this term has been laid before killers in order to shame them even if they have 1 gen left, everyone else rushing the last gen and no deaths. I don't feel tunnelling is productive or fun at the beginning of the game, but if the killer needs momentum often it's either this or lose. I don't see Survivors jumping off the gens when they're being completed too quickly so why is it different to when a killer is trying to force THEIR objective too quickly?  :/
---
Pretty much
---
you play against shitty survivors
---
Ok let's buy Unrelenting 2 and Spies 2 and hope I get Nurse's Calling, BBQ Chili, Ruin...
---
Next Bloodweb contains Unrelenting 3 and Spies 3.
---
Yeah but aren't there nasty buildings like basement of pain
---
Very nice post =)
---
&gt; What's the penalty?
---
0 BP and time wasted
---
I see... Well it's never bad to be able to give him trail run even if it's a little gimped, it's better then shelling out 7-8$ for a class you don't like and will probably never play! Game on, good sir!
---
It‚Äôs still one of the objectives and they‚Äôve completed it, like the killer failed one of his, protecting the gens
---
Really cause when i did it i got 100k max
---
If im playing a skiller and i see that im 100% going to face camp that guy
---
&gt; Literally had someone DC yesterday because I pulled t3 with Myers and caught them.
---
If that's "you're good enough to make people quit", then I'm afraid this game is doomed.
---
I hate legions, just hate em...... Not the actual player but the killer
---
Listen, I'm tired of all the swf who bring Haddonfield. Yesterday, I got at least 6 full swf and each time they would bring Haddonfield. It sucks. Thank god Hag carried through it most of the time.
---
Where?
---
how do you run away if someone is healing you?
---
He's not supposed to be a stealth killer, wtf.   
---
But the same thing is with Pig, Trapper or Plague, you can see items connected to them at the begining of a match, nothing special about it.
---
oh yeah, that's true. not a lotta people play hag so i tend to forget she's pretty decent as well lol
---
&gt;noed can‚Äôt be countered
---
Noed is just as counterable as any other hex totem, except you can even stop it entirely by breaking the totems ahead of time to completely counter it.
---
Very nice guide.
---
I know this is a shitpost, but bugger off with this patter.
---
Nurse: DC asap.
---
I'd rather die than not tea bag twelve times to get those minuscule extra bloodpoints that don't matter!
---
Imagine disliking someone because he‚Äôs better at the game than you.
---
*Territorial imperative
---
I used to find hiding fun, but after enough experience in chases or watching streamers and how funny chases can be, I much prefer those now
---
It's kind of like playing fortnite and not building- yeah you're allowed to not like it, but once you open the can of worms you can begin finding out why people find it dynamic and interesting
---
You love playing killer on this map? The map that has like 20 safe pallets?
---
The area around the bathroom literally has 4 safe pallets that you have to kick to continue chasing.
---
I like it! Great ideas
---
God bless you, kind soul.
---
I find killer more fun and much easier, it just feels more natural to me... but when I play survivor, my God do I suck balls. I always panic in a chase. This is SUPER helpful! Thanks!
---
Dude.  He's got TONS of masks for cosmetics.  TCM 2 mask, TCM 3 mask.  the fat lady in Next Generation, Remakes Masks, 3D Masks.  This is a goldmine, BHVR, GET TO IT!!

I was just explaining how the bp multiplication works. I don't care if you have 5 million stacks of 103% cakes.

Yeah I forgot to include that detail in my last post
---
*because hes an annoying a s s.
---
Id be insanely proud if Monto commented on my video
---
Well. Idk, but it is more probable. Game is 1v4. So, yes, it is very likely that most players prefer survivors
---
are you ok?
---
No, I dislike him because he's extremely toxic. 
---
I'm guessing you're an OchiDO fan since they always seem to go for the 'better than you' argument because the only thing OchiDO has got going for him is being okay at a video game.
---
I never run NOED
---
Omg !! Call the dbd team right now !! Let‚Äôs make this happen üëèüèªüëèüèª over powered ass killers I think survivors deserve this !
---
So you don‚Äôt use stuff you paid for just because you‚Äôre afraid what some random internet people‚Äôs opinion of you?
---
That‚Äôs honestly bad.
---
Dude just wear whatever cosmetics you like. I would genuinely laugh out loud if someone pm‚Äôd me after a match complaining about my cosmetics.
---
Focus on pleasing yourself, not random internet kids
---
Iron grasp is kinda shit
---
You probably tunnel and camp them, making it impossible for them to pay the game at all.
---
The game is safe pallets city. Most ppl think it's killer-sided but it's actually super survivors-sided if you know where to search for pallets
---
Thanks mate!
---
Username checks out
---
It's not the worst even if this change was implemented. It's actually quite a fun perk.  
---
Also: Furtive chase and Left behind, have you heard about those?
---
wait how does the game look like this? mine, especially this map, is much brighter and more saturated
---
Grats on all your maths and numbers but your premise is flawed (and stupid). You're comparing farming bloodpoints to farming shards. **No one farms shards**. Saying 2k shards are worth 7 hours of your time is, simply put, completely stupid. You just get them as a byproduct of playing, and they are only worth what you can get with them. And what can you get with them? Shrine perks, bloodpoints or cosmetics. Shrine perks are a better purchase than bloodpoints if you don't intend to play that character and shrine perks are also a better purchase than cosmetics if you intend to just buy cosmetics with money.
---
If you think 2k shards are more valuable than 150k bloodpoints then I have to assume you're trying to get all the cosmetics, in which case, by your logic, buying a 10$ outfit would be worth 35 hours of "grinding shards". Reconsider the logic you're using.
---
He's not saying it's because he's good, he's saying the survivors just leave for the most random reasons
---
gf's body though.......... damn
---
What about leaving the gen teleportation at 5 seconds but make it so the blood start gushing after 2 seconds?
---
The keyword here is chasing until they get hooked, you sleep them, injure/slug them and move to the next target, if you see someone else while the other is falling asleep, sleep them as well.
---
Since you get vision of them until they fail a skillcheck you suddenly start to control the game and gain a lot of information. You see the part of the map they go to, you see the generators that are not being completed quickly because of failed skill checks, and if they go for a teammate to heal/wake them up, you immediately get the option to control 2 people, and it just snowballs.
---
Otzdarva does a really good job showing this in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OgCvfzNyHc), if you just hook the first person you sleep there's literally 0 reason to even pick Freddy.
---
&gt; I know it was just a typo but ‚Äòsharts to blood‚Äô is killing me
---
Well you should see a doctor then, it may be serious.
---
KISS ME, FATBOI

It is extremely good. Abusing large distances, gathering all kinds of valuable information more or less at-will. Here's an old post on the topic that covers most of it: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9583pf/is_object_of_obsession_any_goood/e3rg7cx/?st=jxynh1he&amp;sh=24f3d311

I think its the settings on my monitor that make the game darker and I have my graphics settings up

I have barely seen anyone say hes too strong. Most people say that hes fun but needs some little tweaks to be good.
---
Yess I've always wanted a perk like breaker. (Even though I'm literally garbage at stunning, I just feel like it's weird they dont have a perk like that.)
---
only the last 2 sound reasonable, the other ones.. too op :\^)

Just because you suck when not using your beloved meta-perks doesn't mean killers are overpowered

I love the first one.

# "Tried to sneak through the door man, can't make it, can't make it the shits stuck. Out of my way son -- DOOR STUCK!!! DOOR STUCK!!! PLEASE, I BEG YOU!!!!"
---
I must say, those perks could be in the game and I wouldn't mind it. one of the most balanced custom perks I've seen on this sub
---
it's more of "please don't do stupid shit that gets everyone killed so I don't have to leave"
---
Could've replaced it with one of the actual hints from the game you lazy ass
---
Funnily enough he's nicer high
---
ohhhh
---
also u sound like dustin from stranger things lol
---
as much as I don't like him either, I think this post is against the rules, as it's "shaming others".
---
They could put on the glasses from the movie
---
Hes not hard to play. I dont know why people are saying that.. He needed a rework because he was shit without strong addons.
---
Then also people say he is really strong late game, which I dont understand, since he has to wait 7s until he can hit people, so he cant even snowball from a hooked survivor. 
---
What hes good at is the hatch game, since he just knows where you are..
---
That it is lol
---
Look out, we have an Einstein over here. Shouldn't you be curing cancer instead of demonstrating your superior IQ to us, NOED users?
---
I think they're just as toxic, they just have more of a sense of style, so they're often slightly charismatic with it.
---
Nah I looked but it wasn‚Äôt me
---
This is propably one of the best outfit ive seen from BHVR
---
What about baby jakes
---
Oh rank 4-1 c:
---
This is how programming works when you're on your first job out of college maybe. BHVR has demonstrated their greed time and time again by continually opting to push out new chapters and cosmetics, rather than focusing on the health of their game. Any developer is aware that introducing more code into a system that is already riddled with bugs will only create more and more, and I honestly do not think BHVR's devs are bad and programming, but rather they're susceptible to a team of managers who don't understand the development process, and need to show "results" for their own bosses.
---
Preemptively leave that, "but the artists aren't in charge of the game code" hurdur untyped. It doesn't matter, when priorities are making money,
---
I love this thread rationalizing dcing and trying to talk down someone playing the game as intended
---
I don't cleanse tho
---
Fighting fire with fire only makes the flames higher. 
---
Not like there‚Äôs a way they can know what rank you are ahead of time.
---
Why would you ever use coin offerings if you can just get a new item every minute?
---
Her power is RNG because it can literally kill you. If you don't like how rbt work, I'm not sure why you'd play pig (stun squeak?) 
---
Her UR are weak though.
---
I said that in a Scottish accent.
---
"YA GOTTA LET DA BEBY DWEET OUT DA HATCH!"
---
Territorial imperative is ok in a weird kind of way, because nobody expects you to run it so they think the chest in the basement is safe. If they decreased the trigger range then it would be better.
---
Whenever someone loops me, I just ignore them and go for the gen-rushing survivors. When I slug them and drop them in a remote corner of the map, I slug the looper. That‚Äôs how I get the 4-survivor almost every time.
---
True. I missed that small detail :)
---
The killers objective is literally to kill survivors; How the fuck would "stopping the survivors from playing by killing them" be reportable?
---
Rusty Shackles are ass and only good for camping. 
---
But yeah Pig's add-ons are pretty underwhelming besides for Combat Straps
---
Xbox here. And I tea bag everybody. Hide yo wife hide yo kids
---
Freddy: *Runs bamboozle*
---
David: *Puts gun in mouth*
---
I think he is playable. Watch not otzdarva's video on him and you might learn a thing or two on how to play him. I did and he's not too bad.
---
I didn‚Äôt know that Leatherface was also a master in the ancient art of Slav Squatting.
---
What if 3 emot was a short "Pssst!" ?
---
Whoever got a flashlight spam clicks anyway
---
and crouching is easy to spot from a distance
---
He was rank 11
---
Play the game. Ruin's only purpose is to make it easier for you to get a good start. Once you hit your first down Ruin has done it's job, it's up to you to snowball from that.
---
I used to be a Freddy main (Ghostface now), and I‚Äôm so happy that they‚Äôre finally giving Freddy some love. I guess Legion really is the new worst killer.
---
NO RAGE BUT, I JUST PLAYED A GAME AGAINST NURSE AND THERE WAS A LIGHT COMING FROM THE GROUND UP TO THE SKY AND I WAS WONDERING IF IT WAS A BUG OR WHAT THE FUCK IT WAS I AM REALLY CONFUSED
---
&gt;Obv my emblems werent enough
---
How about you heal some other survivors and/or do a chase yourself?
---
Might even make it fun to play for the killer too!
---
Because why else would a killer disconnect?
---
I actually had a Jane in a chase and someone was struggling for the whole minute. As soon as I hooked the Jane the hatch spawns right next to her.
---
I think Leatherface isn‚Äôt actually too bad, he feels like a Billy with a different purpose to me. He can chase a bit more safely because he can always hold his chainsaw ready to break pallets instantly and it‚Äôs a lot easier to not run into stuff and to hit your target. I still prefer Billy though to lock down the whole map as much as possible.
---
unfortunately it seems like Legion is probably one of the worst, and it‚Äôs unfortunate because they‚Äôre one of my favorite killers in terms of their mechanics
---
Bruh I was waiting for a Hillbilly skin, this was disappointing.
---
Justice sounds pretty op, I‚Äôd love to see that one
---
I came here to suggest candyman as well! üíï
---
Justice would be cancer, and would heavily encourage slugging.  Leave sabotage alone.
---
We all know everybody runs noed for the 4% speed, who needs the exposed status effect?
---
I've gotten countless 4K's with Freddy including a few as recently as yesterday and I don't camp or tunnel.  You really sound quite inexperienced if you sincerely believe this.  He's actually one of the worst killers to even attempt to camp with due to the dream transition.  You a rank 17 or something?  I know Freddy is a noob stomper at those ranks and every killer up there is more likely to camp.
---
Maybe for the runner-up spot. Dota 2 wins by default.
---
I wanna pet it
---
I was taking it as the survivor deserves it....not the killer. I took it like he was saying flashlights are toxic and he deserved to die lol. My bad.
---
They live is a documentary
---
congrats üéà
---
ACTUALLY VIABLE, FREDDYGOTBUFFED
---
Just use your brain to remember which ones you saw the aura of before you fell asleep around you and which ones are new.
---
I've been doing this with Windows on PTB all the time and it works great.
---
[waiiiit a minute.... *who* are you?](https://youtu.be/nycaCnKqXh4)
---
Ok you‚Äôve started something. You‚Äôve got an obligation to do all killers now if possible
---
I think they honestly just need to implement a maximum difference in rank of friends you can queue with. That would solve most of the problems and require the lower ranks to learn to play for themselves a little before grouping up
---
As a bloodpoint horder myself I would just find the info of how many totems are up to be useful, but yeah I understand. *Just* the information isn't that great, it'd need some ability like thrill does.
---
Makes sense
---
I'm running Ruin / STBFL / Surveilance / Nurse's
---
Ruin and Nurse's are self explanatory.
---
With Surv you can kick a gen and if someone gets back on it thinking you left, you can double back and stalk.
---
With your ability you can get only a -2 on your STBFL while downing the obsession and sometimes you don't have the time to stalk them fully. Walking up to them with 6-8 stacks in stealth and just hitting them pretty much accomplishes the same feat as stalking: putting them in a one-shot situation.
---
Definitely ran into him atleast once then I remember a wraith face camping two guys sadly only 1 died, couldn't rescue him
---
I assume it was prepped before the rework was even out
---
If the devs have any sense they‚Äôll make sure they get him away from mobile asap, tbh
---
For real, that would be annoying af. It would also strongly incentivize killers to just wait for the pallet drop instead of trying to swing through.
---
I know there are five totems I'm not stupid lol
---
Dont mind me, just a killer main looking for counter play
---
lmao
---
Oops maybe other people can try to tickle the other killers, I‚Äôm a Doctor main so I got him.
---
Go away
---
Bruh yeah wrong sub
---
Not canonical but that's what a lot of the community calls it
---
Is the toxicity higher at lower ranks? I'm a 17 survivor and 18 killer on PC and people so far are cool.
---
Lol, thats new to me.  I'll use that name tonight
---
Not gonna lie, you have to force the game to be longer, nothing you can do about that.
---
I wish I could be more helpful but genuinely that's what you need to do if you are fully demolishing them.
---
Imagine if you swing through and hit but still get stunned. The perk should be coded to activate but not to stack with the speed boost you already get from being hit.
---
It honestly gets worse, go read some steam threads or see how a livestream interacts, it's a great game but wow it's almost a case study for garbage behavior
---
Survivor or killer?
---
Iam 13 killer and its rly bad
---
I've seen killers disconnect 3 times in over 200 hours, I can't even begin to count the amount of times survivors disconnect.
---
I'm not saying it's not wrong to disconnect, believe me I know it sucks. I see people disconnecting all the time when they first get downed, won't even allow the killer to hook them. And then it's just a 3 vs 1 game, easy for the killer, hard for the rest of us.
---
What I'm saying is I understand how that killer must have felt when (s)he choose to ragequit. I don't condone the behavior though. And if we can all make the game more fun for each other, we can have some less ragequitting.
---
That‚Äôs survivor
---
&gt;I came into a thread about joyfully greeting people with teabags to detail how I intentionally screw *teammates* over once I've used every single pallet, but ***I'm*** a dick?" 
---
Uhh yeah man, that's actually how level of dickery is determined.  You should stop drinking, you've become *that guy*.
---
Survivor.
---
I mean, I thought your joke was funny. And him not getting it right away was also funny.
---
For some reason, I think it was me the entire time.
---
[Ahem](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cbjgcl/achieved_with_paint/)
---
Blendette
---
We already have that perk, it‚Äôs called breakdown, it‚Äôs in the shrine rn as well.
---
Gross
---
I always found the term "nice killer" to be the definition of a oxymoron :D
---
uh....sigh
---
just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks. i'm rank 17 (maybe 15 at most) and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ them, i just hunt and hit them ONLY if they're not injured. don't down them after u already hooked them. that just slows down the match. and not that u asked but i recommend BBQ, Distressing, Nurse vision, and NOED. the downside is the company still hasnt given us an update that shows the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not yet. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are.
---
With a name like Blood Hero I think it should require that you‚Äôre already injured in order to gain the endurance, could maybe up the duration due to that requirement.
---
You realize that that's exactly what survivors running MoM were doing but everyone wanted to call them toxic meta ass holes as well.  
---
Stop being a hypocrite.
---
You guys suck. You must suck too much ass to play without knowingly exploiting game breaking bugs.
---
I do play on ps4 :) and because she is my favorite of the lady Survivors and the only survivor I bothered to prestige, and I got her to P3. I guess you could say I have a soft spot for Kates :)
---
Blood Hero, Justice and Breaker nope
---
Hex: Devour Hope is fun when nobody breaks your totem, but we all know what happens to Hex perks...
---
Makes sense to me!
---
They can just drop it early to play around sf.
---
Then you haven't played Hag at a rank that matters, you cant call her easy. Play her at rank 1 for a bit, you'll change your mind.
---
"balanced" ü§£ü§£
---
TBH if I was the survivor in this situation, I would stop wiggling and laugh my ass off along with the killer.
---
Is really map &amp; perk dependent though with mostly bad addons that affect the chase/escape ability of the one survivor you are supposed to ignore.
---
I first played Jake, idk what you mean ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
&gt; on reddit, how the heck do you put a paragraph enter so you can have more than one paragraph?
---
press enter twice
---
Someday, Wraith will become not bottom 3.
---
Fair enough. Was just trying to help anyone that might actually not know though.
---
The same happened for me, except with Ghostface. Then I plaid Leatherface to get BBQ, and I went from 16 to 14.
---
It be like that sometimes. If you ever want to play together I'm on PS4 as well.
---
this happened to me right after i was unhooked in the basement. killer was hooking a second person down there claudette waited until she finished a full heal to move out of the door way.
---
Never thought somebody would complain about not being able to see the hook states of survivors. 
---
You ever think that isn‚Äôt in the game for a reason or?
---
Totems are no affected by thanatophobia. Only repair, healing and sabotaging.
---
I play killers that are garbage because I always have the most fun with them.
---
It happens with every game, the worst characters are the ones I have fun with the most.
---
Yeah three rank Ones playing with the rank 20. Not suspicious at all. Especially when they shit talk post-match and tea bag at every palette. It's pretty important that you ignored the fact I said that that's not all survive with friends groups.
---
upvoted for cat
---
Yup, Small Game will be a meta perk in the initial weeks once Freddy is live
---
See that reminds me of when I play survive with friends. That's why I said not all groups. Those are the ones that are fun to play against or play as. I'm talking about 3 rank 1 survivors with a rank 20 Smurf account so they can bully new killers.
---
Damn, boi... DAMN, BOI! HE THICC, BOI! THAT‚ÄôS A THICC AS BOI! DAMN!
---
LATE TO THE PARTY! 
---
FIX YOUR DISEASE RIDDEN RANK SYSTEM BEHAVIOR!
---
  MAYBE ILL EQUIP SOME NICE SHIT THIS MATCH! MAYBE ILL BRING A FUCKIN SWEET MAP! MAYBE YOULL PUT MY RANK 8 ASS WITH A RANK 8 KILLER BUT DECIDE TO INVITE THE KIDS TABLE BY POPULATING THE MATCH WITH RANK FRICKEN 14 SURVIVORS!!!!!!!! FUUUUUUUUUCK!
---
That would be pretty cool
---
I honestly feel like hag Trapper and nurse are the only Killers who can dominate on Haddonfield. No other colors seem viable on that map. Picket Fences are the bane of my existence xD
---
Justice should be a once per match mechanic.
---
Congratulations
---
What? I think they did well with their design of the new killer.
---
She looks like she's about to give Ace the Anaconda dance as shown in "From Dusk Til Down".
---
I knew there was a reason I chose Feng
---
I find your lack of faith disturbing, Detective.
---
YO HOLY SHIT THAT LOOKS SICK
---
All of the this. First hook with only 2 people on gens is better than first down with 3 people gens. Thats all we ask of it.
---
Or if they are shit survivors. No way am I giving hatch to someone who killed their teammates with completely unsafe hook rescues.
---
.....but they all were Claudette's what was I supposed to do??
---
If Freddy's Heartbeat is 32 meters, then Gen Teleporting gives less time to react.
---
Fron the moment they hear your heartbeat until you get to them, they have around 6.8 seconds. Thats how long it would take you to get to them. If you teleport, thats 5 seconds they have to hide.
---
He has a bit of stealth, his teleport has less time to hide from then normal walking.
---
If he has a 24m terror radius, its about the same, but teleporting is still a bit faster.
---
I count bad survivors under toxic cause that‚Äôs basically farming for point.
---
Get Noed‚Äôtd
---
FUCKING YES
---
THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO COME WHEN SPIRIT MCDIPSHIT HAS POOR AS SHITE INTERNET, SO THE PHASING BECOMES MORE LIKE AN UNEVEN STUTTER ACROSS THE MAP.
---
Then The Clown began to beat Dwight repeatedly with the hatch.
---
This is why some games make a punishment system for quitting a game. I feel this would be nice to implement once they have dedicated servers.
---
Nah, I actually think this is correct. David is more into the darker, shady side of being a Jock. Goth Jock is quite apt for him.
---
If you say so üòë
---
No, but learning killers in the game isn't actually that hard except for the harder killers (i.e nurse or hag I will always suck with.)
---
KYF is good for practice, and if you don't have anyone to play with you can fine people on this reddit or on facebook or steam (for PC) that will usually be willing.
---
If you really have the time to search around the map for all 5 totems and get gens done then the killer can't assert any map pressure and it's already gg
---
That shouldn't be how you have to pip. Why do I not see more people complaining about this?
---
He camps it up enough already! But jokes aside, why not.
---
Dude's slow as shit, seeing him run faster than a slight meander would look really weird.
---
If you have the audacity to literally unhook in front of the killer, it‚Äôs on YOU, the person who unhooked your teammate haphazardly if they get downed again.
---
These are all really good and honestly don't sound too op.
---
Somebody did this to me. Thankfully I had a firecracker. Dropped it right in front of that assholes face.
---
Wait he said the person has no skill because they were running bamboozle on the hag? But doesn‚Äôt he run bamboozle on the huntress?
---
That I don't hurt anybody, and just let them escape.
---
It is. It only activates the *first* time you are downed.
---
The mask makes it so much better
---
"This is fine"
---
Its only the first time you get downed
---
Spine chill
---
Please, state which one of those is overpowered and why.
---
I mean there are some nasty xombos you could do with these but for the most oart these seem pretty decent. Especially conpared to some of the other custom perks I've seen in the sub.
---
I'm sticking with photosynthesis for now.
---
I think legion will be the new worst killer
---
I just miss my Eve. The old champs had the most build diversity, now she doesn't even play the same as well as being forced into AP.
---
I‚Äôm not sure why it couldn‚Äôt happen; they‚Äôve already got a bunch of licensed characters, surely they could get another classic one.
---
Breaker would make for some truely uncatchable survivors.
---
I want The Beldam (The Other Mother) from Coraline
---
i want button eyes
---
maybe they could work similarly to RBT. You only have so long to find your eyes before something happens...
---
Rank 17 with level 3 perks from 4 different survivors üòí. I see that all the damn time.
---
Stopped watching 5 seconds in. Seems like something Ochido would edit. And that guys a shit stain.
---
I do the same where I keep poking The Hag until she hisses at me
---
Great meme perk, funny to run especially with swf or in synergy with quick and quiet and dance with me but terrible overall
---
Defenlty not a 10 second cool down thats awful. Maybe a 5. And don't slow him down from his traps that's a main part of it
---
Very cool ideas indeed
---
There's only four of them.  Really not that much trouble, unless they're all using the same outfit on the same character, then it's just an added pain in the ass of remembering them by name or icon position.
---
Not a fan of ochido myself, its not really like ochido style since there is no t-bag or any kind of toxicity. Suit yourself.
---
You should take a video, it‚Äôs kinda hilarious
---
Clip?
---
I know a lot of people just dc upon it but my advice to you is sadly just suffer through it. If the survivors aren't that great then nice, get your win but if they are decent then just hope the next game will be better
---
Killers usually delight in dragging me next to the trapdoor and kicking it down, but no use wasting an easy doublepip when you main surv like me
---
That‚Äòs smth I noticed as well, build diversity is dead. Nowadays you are considered a maniac if you even diverse from the item order.
---
I need Shirtless Michael, and I don‚Äôt even have the Halloween chapter.
---
I agree. I used to like his videos but he has become really stroppy lately and often ridicules anyone in his chat who disagrees with him. I‚Äôd imagine DBD all day every day can do that to a guy.
---
Time to buy
---
It‚Äôs not camping if all the gens are done. I‚Äôve went from no kills to 4K when they can‚Äôt help but try and get that rescue .
---
They bought themselves off of Starbreeze (and used to have the same stupid policy payday 2 had) so idk if tgey really have any dumb managers. 
---
Maybe they just think it‚Äòs too late anyway who knows
---
Who cares?  Dead by daylight has hired killers before, how would his be any different?
---
If it‚Äòs really bad for one, you notice them rubberband. Absolutely disgusting if you try to play huntress.
---
Are you just not going to believe that someone is a nazi until it‚Äôs too late and someone gets killed?
---
Ohhhhhh yeah, thats what he looked like at the end of the original. Everytime I see that outfit i instantly think of Next Generation. I still want Next Generation skin though.
---
I definitely agree, (I love horses) it‚Äôs just that I didn‚Äôt know if he did something or not.
---
I swear Reddit just likes to complain. Literally maybe one in ten matches I see BM in the post-game chat and usually the others will call the person out
---
Dragging his giant sword behind...
---
But imagine this: Pyramid Head's terror radius would be those little critter-like monsters that accompany him in the first Silent Hill movie. They would cover the ground and hamper a survivor's ability to run, reducing their movement speed. Regular killers are 0.6 meters per second faster than survivors, so Pyramid could totally walk at like 3.6m/s, with the critters slowing survivors down to 3.0m/s. Could be funny, and reduce the loop value survivors get out pallets, as well as make tile-to-tile runs more dangerous. There could be different densities to that critter distribution too, depending on proximity to Pyramid, with survivor movement speed growing slower the closer they are to him. And then his ability could be something to do with charging an attack with his sword, which obviously has like twice the reach of a normal weapon.
---
No there are some good ones. Personal favourites are noob3  and hybrid panda.  And for youtube Videos also monto.
---
Doing the world a service, one Claudette corpse at a time.
---
How the hell is Kate either a Nerd or a Jock? She plays no sport or have any nerdy hobby, she's just a musician.
---
Breaker is basically just lithe but with a pallet rather than a vault. The exhaustion timer keeps it from being OP.
---
Generally the higher you go the more toxic it is, from the games I've played over the years, this takes the cake for the most toxic community, it says alot when even the fog whisperers acknowledge how bs it is.
---
Picked the game up in the sales, got maybe 2-3 4Ks as Myers and already have had people leave negative steam comments and talk shit in the after chat. Think I'm gonna like it here.
---
If you kill the survivor super fast you won't get as many bloodpoints and won't pip. The objective of the game, ultimately, is to pip, not just to get an ez 4k 
---
Chances are if they are ballsy enough to unhook in front of you they are running Borrowed Time and it's not the smartest move to go for the hooked guy.
---
So I'd say it's not logical
---
Rank 17, probably only has a few hours into the game. I mean..."nurses vision"?
---
It‚Äôs obvious that it‚Äôs disabled when exhausted...
---
Personal preference but I don‚Äôt see HOW anyone can watch their videos. They over commentate. To the point of it being annoying. They remind me of porn commentary ‚Äúyeah you like that you little slut, huh‚Äù. 
---
Idk how to explain it. It‚Äôs just awkward and weird to watch. For me at least. 
---
My favorite guy to watch is NotOrzada. He is so humble when he plays and constantly gives props to his opponents. He also has so much game knowledge. It‚Äôs insane to me.
---
*rank 20 pizza dwight*
---
I've played this game for 2500 hours roughly and have seen plenty of killers dc.  I've had multiple killers ragequit in the same night.  I don't bm I just loop and try to survive.  Just sounded like you were creating a justification for the killer to dc which is never the case.  It's wrong when either side does it.  Killers that ragequit so it because they're immature and can't stand to lose (the same reason survivors do it).  It's the action of a toxic dickhead and I don't think anything we do as players is going to help it.  That's on them everytime it happens
---
Both of those are horribly wrong imo. It's "more-ee" and "mih-ther" with a low i, not "myther". But hey who really cares? Everyone will get what you're talking about anyway
---
Now this is podracing!
---
I used a new part today and hit all the skill check and I really felt like that lmaoo
---
You sound like you're 13
---
It only respawns once no?
---
Meh.  Noob3 is dull, Hybrid sounds phony with his happy-go-lucky shit and Monto can just edit out his bad moments freely.
---
Because he'll have no power if survivors run adrenaline, a SUPER common perk, for a whole minute provided he hits nobody.
---
He'll have no traversal option, no traps, no slow down, no aura reading and be at the mercy of being a basic M1 killer at that time.
---
Weird that it's called an Anaconda dance when she had a Bernese Python around her neck.
---
you're telling me that you are unable to suspend disbelief if they made him a little faster? 
---
this is the same game that makes a fatass, out of shape clown faster than a thin track star.
---
So...doctor?
---
Laurie is a nerdy prep. Without a doubt
---
I only watch noob3 on youtube but for the last videos you could basically hear how tired he is of DBD. He's not even done the intro and i can already tell he'd rather do something else.
---
I want that suit yes
---
&gt;Monto can just edit out his bad moments freely.
---
Making his Videos quote enjoyable in my opinion. Ans the others just fit my Humor.
---
My dude are you copy and pasting lol
---
Gotta make the free karma bait posts by emphasizing a small minority that isn't even noticeable.
---
Can someone please rig Hags Mori to be a Meg and who she's killing be a totem, you know for memes
---
The higher my ranks get, the more true this becomes. And i'm only a rank 6. i definitely miss the lower ranks
---
??? I'm not a killer main, have never ran MoM, and have no strong opinions on the perk in either direction. Did you reply to the wrong comment?
---
i'd rather have an op killer than a weak one, make the game more intense and actually give me a feeling of accomplishment when i escape a trial.
---
Biker songbird? Im sold

Killers will stop tunneling survivors when survivors stop tunneling generators. All these gens and you choose the one that has the most progress. Pathetic. 
---
*See how fucking dumb that sounds?*
---
gotta agree, i got really hyped for the parachute dwight when i saw it leaked, and i instantly bought it here when it was released not too long ago
---
When the game first came out I had a bug where I freed myself from a hook and it teleported me out if the map barrier wall. I ran around until I found an exit and escaped. All of this was when only like one gen was done and the gates were closed.
---
That head is hideous, but I'm SO buying the pants. I guess I'll just stick with Halloween blight Billy
---
Like an add-on that makes Freddy play the old way even?
---
Counter shit meta is always nice.
---
You got cute fingers !
---
&gt;It's the action of a toxic dickhead and I don't think anything we do as players is going to help it.
---
It's a toxic reaction to some toxic action by a certain toxic meg in this case. 
---
All I'm saying is: if you see some toxic behaviour as OP was seeing, do *something* about it. Earn some chase points. Be the change you want to see in this already mostly toxic community.
---
What.
---
Is that a GAMER GIRL!?
---
I‚Äôll give you the rundown. 
---
Hag ‚Äúproximity‚Äù camped someone into their second hook phase, tunneled them off hook to kill them, found tru3, hooked him in basement, hag then NoED‚Äôd the last two remaining survivors for a 4k. 
---
Some people in chat started defending the hag for not being bad and more blah blah things. It‚Äôs a game on wretched shop where true had a flashlight if you need to find it yourself. 
---
His chat is being weirdly toxic today so that might be contributing to it.
---
I enjoy running it on wraith and nurse, but o agree on the trigger range, it so damn big that by the time you get there with most killers the survivors are long gone
---
ThanksüòÑ! But I think the Doctor is cuter
---
&gt;My rank is 11
---
that's why. killers dominate poopy, piss and green ranks but inferior on purple and red.
---
The ranks in PS4 can be very squished. You tend to get the same people fairly often. It's like red ranks on PC, you see the same names a lot.
---
Sounds bout right
---
I literally just got permabanned from his chat. I just said something like ‚Äúomg survivors op pls nerf‚Äù after a sickomode huntress hitbox and he fell for the bait and called me out. Then later I said it was just sarcasm and I got banned LUL
---
He always says how he has a fact based opinion and how he isn‚Äôt toxic at all, but he is a whiny bitch, really
---
The other user is saying that NOED should be nerfed just like MoM was. Because they're comparably strong.
---
You're arguing against this saying killers don't need an excuse to "play the game" as if that's what he's arguing at all. Even though that's all MoM players were doing as well.
---
&gt; I'm not a killer main, have never ran MoM, and have no strong opinions on the perk in either direction.
---
Okay? And? It was killer mains bitching about MoM that got it nerfed.
---
Did you actually read the thread you're replying to?
---
Console bans are possible and happen often. People just tend not to report because they think BVHR can't do anything.
---
I thought of making him the jock jock but I wanted to not go with the obvious choice but instead put Meg there to kind of break the expectation.
---
Haha, yeah.
---
Some people forget that this is still a horror game, but they still want their hands to be held all the time. Remembering a few pallet spots while awake is NOT too hard, is it?
---
I just saw the stream playback, it was a camping and hardcore tunneling hag using noed. He didn't say anything about the killer being unskilled because of bamboozle.
---
Lil question xd. What does "OP" mean? (except Overpowered which is clearly not meant here)
---
Yep. Tru3 was talking about how chat would rip him apart for playing like that yet the same chat proceeds to rip him apart for calling her bad. 
---
Not his community unfortunately. I‚Äôm in his streams most days but I‚Äôve never seen it be like a cesspool before. 
---
Today is definitely a bad chat day.
---
Yes cause you were in almost every game where these perks were being used? Be realistic. Everyone knows this game has horrible hit detection and latency problem. It hasn't been a secret for 3 years. I don't know where you've been.
---
you just ruined my day
---
I really like paramedic.
---
I don't know what you're trying to say with that? Survivors still quit more than killers, Survivors also dodge more lobbies?
---
That doesn't justify toxic behaviour from either side though.
---
That's nothing I had 2 STEAM PROFILE COMMENT PAGES from one game because I dced
---
No Blood Warden. Game wouldn't let me crawl out.
---
If you lose with omegablink nurse at high ranks then the killers aren‚Äôt to blame. Its you
---
Nope. Got Mori'd right after the clip ends.
---
You can hear self-caring and groaning noises in the basement pretty easily lol
---
Didn't stop. Game didn't let me leave. Dunno why.
---
here is one i made a while back 
---
Knock First
---
When Injured by the killer without a chase started you will gain a token that will increase your action speed by 10/15/20% up to 3 tokens but if hooked lose 2 tokens.
---
This community is so wholesome toward noobs
---
*NO, NOT THE BEES. THEY'RE IN MY EYES*
---
How do i get bbq and chili? Btw thx for the info
---
I only ever spare people with less than 35 hours on their Steam profile. It's not always visible, but when it is I always make sure to let that person leave.
---
Sometimes if I want to chat with a specific Survivor I may let them live too. Or if they're a friend of mine.
---
If I'm just playing around or farming, obviously I'll let them live.
---
Otherwise everyone dies with little exceptions.
---
Killer for sure, Plague is my main. That is until HOPEFULLY a certain Demogorgon makes its way into the fray.
---
of course survivors quit more than killers. there is a 4:1 ratio. you immediately started attacking "survivors".
---
OP's point is why should they de-pip when a killer bitched out. it is 100% a valid point. it has absolutely nothing to do with survivors quitting.
---
Probably won't ever happen. Google the creator of Jeepers Creepers and you'll see why.
---
Yes, I think we shouldn‚Äôt look on meta and some people saying what‚Äôs best when for everyone it differs by their playstyle and by what they enjoy playing the most.
---
Pages? Man, that's a lot of pent up rage.
---
Yeah and that's not fair because that all there is in high ranks
---
as an ex-wraith main, i can understand the flashlight hate.
---
Nope wrong again you have not played killer in high rank
---
Try getting a 4k "too fast" and barely black pipping. The emblem system. Is wack as fuck.
---
hey, these guys ruined mine, i‚Äôm just passing along the message.
---
Smurf accounts lol
---
Lol then you can bother her til she puke on you(?)
---
[Based from this meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/what-if-i-put-my-minecraft-bed-next-to-yours)
---
Yeah, figured it out lol
---
Agreed. I want Next Generation the most.
---
"Once per match"
---
Agreed, the white/black hair with makeup is the only decent one.
---
Ash and David are goths? Sorry you‚Äôve completely lost me
---
Then explain me why am I being the best in my team while others are already dead, despite being in good ranks? https://i.imgur.com/8Pu1U5A.jpg
---
I wish my bf liked me.
---
You can‚Äôt always get all of the totems as I said in another thread. Also you waste your time cleansing totems for a perk that might not even exist.
---
God, I‚Äôm imagining a full team of sabo Jakes running Justice... *shudders*
---
He has add ons that slow progression, and sleeping survivors add to his map presence thanks to the reduced teleport cooldown. Freddy is also a lot more powerful these days, one of his ultra rares prevents your obsession from **ever waking up**. I get that some people will miss the old fire and forget dumpster tier Fredster, but I love the new one. He's far more active and less restricted.
---
How dare you put down puppers:( 
---
*he‚Äôs a really good dbd streamer who Dwight looks like*
---
Damn brother. 
---
- H.H.
---
I loveeee puppers! One of my favorite dbd content creators
---
He has a god complex.
---
I mean I wouldn't put them under the stereotypical description of a goth  and Ash sadly got the same treatment as Kate and Laurie, which you can read about in the other comments. A lot of these labels are pretty much up for interpretation and people have different assumptions and ideas of what the labels mean so none of it is written in stone or anything. It's just for fun and I tried my best, I think.
---
There‚Äôs clips of him dc‚Äôing when he was playing killer because survivors were looping him and flashlight raping him. Hilarious.
---
F A K E E N T I T Y
---
Playing killer is the harder part of the game so i think its ok that they earn more points
---
Only people who think this is a good idea are people that never actually played Silent Hill 2 so they have no idea who pyramid head really is. It would be outrageously inappropriate to see him in DBD and I would hate it
---
For a partial skin in a game, hell yeah that's a lot of money.
---
What map do you use for this? I can‚Äôt find any DBD maps on the workshop
---
Will do, thanks
---
KiLlEr iS hArD sO wE dEsErVe mOrE pOiNtS

...what do you mean lmao
---
Because that‚Äôs what hero‚Äôs do :)
---
Love tru3 but I can't stand noob3. His constant "dewd" "man dood" "dood dude" just irritate the hell out of me.
---
So I'm supposed to let the injured person get away so they can heal him in 2 seconds and rush gens while the healthy survivor loops me for 3 gens? No thanks.   
---
Don't dive for the hooks when I'm nearby and your friends wont get "tunnelled"
---
Whats P3?
---
the developers honestly aren't entirely to blame here. theoretically bhvr has a qa department that should be catching these bugs; I say theoretically, because evidently they're treating reddit's reactions to ptb changes as their qa. I don't work for bhvr and I don't know how things work there, but the amount of bugs they allow into production is just embarrassing by this point.
---
That is hard to do. Because the definition of "ruining my experience" varies from person to person. For some people, the simple act of losing ruins their experience. I don't have time to cater to everyone's view of "fun". The way I look at it, as long as you aren't griefing or hacking then people need to get the hell over it.
---
Yeah, people should be able to enjoy the game they paid for. But I bought the game too, and following a bunch of "honorable fun" rules isn't fun to me.
---
Lol im not even killer main im just sayin. This is how the bp system works life with it
---
That‚Äôs some ho shit...
---
What? Hes a footballer, he goes to the pub, and he slams drinks every night. He pickes fights with everyone. Thats about as Jock as it gets.
---
Jeff is the best all those other survivors are chumps
---
The OP of the comment chain made a single offhanded mention of MoM in a larger point about NOED, then **a different commenter** later down in the thread made **a different point** about NOED **completely unrelated to MoM**.
---
Despite the fact that my comment is **4 levels removed** from having any relation to **an offhanded mention of MoM** you're trying to insist that I have a strong hypocritical view of the perk even though **I've repeatedly tried to correct you**.
---
You are clearly just trolling at this point and trying to put words into my mouth to complain about a strawman that you created in your head. Go troll a different thread.
---
That's pretty accurate for Jane honestly.
---
That‚Äôs what I keep seeing everyone say... but literally nobody is showing proof. Lol
---
It's a shame, he seems kind of fun to be up against
---
FIX THIS STEAM OFFLINE GLITCH
---
Eh I feel like it‚Äôs a soft counter since those two perks are already meta m1 killer perks. Plus it‚Äôs also another exhaustion perk so they won‚Äôt be able to stack w any other exhaustion perk
---
Yo b if you need background music for your videos then let me know!
---
I made a name called "PugsLiver" and kept doing the crying Twitch emote, BibleThump or whatever, and got banned.  It takes a sharp eye to see that, I must admit.
---
That's why I like to play pig with at least one totem. You give survs an objective to clean a totem, slightly slowing their progress on gens while it's up if it's ruin, you give a surv an opportunity to get score from disabling a party hat, and while they're trying to get a party hat off, you can focus someone else. Everyone wins. It's gonna be even more win when survs will start getting BP from surviving time.
---
But I have played against a lot of killers in high rank, I stay in red rank as a survivor
---
Does her leather skirt actually go with the jacket? Her skirt sadly does match any of her current cosmetics (big bird top doesn't count).
---
Damn i guess you gotta write a mesage to support i never heard about that problem before
---
ash for the voice lines ;))
---
I guess but someone will make a build that is super toxic out of it
---
It's viable at maybe the lowest of the low ranks, because of how the new crappy emblems work, you could lose everything in your sacrifice emblem but still hit people who try to save you for the brutality emblem and still pip, they need to make camping lower all the emblems instead of the sacrifice-(this is coming from a killer main)
---
Trust me, he‚Äôs not fun to play against
---
I just dont play killer enough to get to rank 1.
---
you‚Äôre in a sub specifically for dead by daylight and telling people to calm down about the game?? lol maybe if this were like r/games or somethin
---
Why? 
---
I mean I had this David constantly selfcaring everytime I put him in dream world. Pallet slammed to living hell.
---
Just goes to show how people in this community are so eager to proclaim something is OP.
---
Trapper is pretty bugged rn lmao, sometimes it stops you from placing traps and sometimes it stops other people from escaping traps
---
This is why we need an option to push/kick another survivor out of our way when shit like this happen, for sandbaggers and unhooking with the killer next to us.
---
They aren't dealing with an ordinary looper any more
---
Oh wow. A killer being able to disguise itself as a survivor. Like that idea hasn‚Äôt been though up about over a thousand times. Oh please. This killer would be destroyed against SWF
---
Why would you chase somebody with wallhacks? You just end it and watch, where people going, cutting edges. This map is amazing for x-ray add-ons with ambushes and bad for chases.
---
I WANT TO USE HEAD ON BUT IT NEVER WORKS. NEVER
---
Yeah I main Freddy and people tell me he's trash but I destroy as him at rank 12 and now the rework will allow me to destroy more at rank 12
---
yeah, bhve will remove safe pallets and keep bloodlust in the game, just wait!
---
I wish I could block him somehow
---
C o w a b u n g a
---
That is untrue it depends on how you kill him.
---
If you hookcamp him then yes you won't pip and get less BP, but if you allow him to get rescued and re-hook him 2 times it's all fine.
---
Even with "Borrowed Time" it's more interesting to go after the hooked char, he will go to stage 2 and is one step closer to be Dead-on-Hook. The fact that the punishment befalls the guy that can't do anything about it isn't really all that important *(Maybe BHVR needs to implement a button you can press if you don't want to be rescued at that point and it show above the survivor)*. Again it sucks for that survivor, but in a SWF group it's unacceptable to claim it's the killer's fault he tunneled someone. SWF groups are hard enough as is you take every advantage you can get it's technically a competition if you don't play to win then don't play at all...

Can't go wrong with the solid BBQ/Ruin/Enduring/Spirit Fury build. It's not very creative or interesting, but considering she's still just a basic M1 Killer at the end of the day, it's always a good go-to build.
---
Freddy does his job better now, so play him lol
---
Clown definitely isnt very popular to play. He's kind of in an awkward spot where he isn't good enough to play seriously and win (ie, nurse) but isn't shitty enough to just meme around with (ie, no perk prepatch Freddy). He excels at ending chases quickly but the thing is, more often than not at high ranks it just doesnt matter because he has no real way to pressure the map. There are a few builds that can work well with him but more often than not I find that I get 7 or 8 hooks and the gens just fly anyways. Any wins I get tend to happen because the survivors mess up and get overly altruistic. Because of this, clown tends to stay on the bench in favor of the better killers I like (spirit, plag, huntress, piggy).
---
Gotta love the hag fidget spinner move at the end üòÇ
---
ok this is epic
---
I find it satisfying to close the hatch right before they jump in. One person just accepted their fate and let me kill them
---
I did, but their support keeps redirecting me to a W40k webside for some reason, not even kidding
---
What about Walter Sullivan from silent hill 4? He would be fire as a killer I'm just not sure what he would do
---
yup pretty much this
---
I don't think so, they also already stated that any add-ons you have you can keep, it's just what the add-on does that'll change.
---
*(I secretly hope that pre-revamp P3 Freddy's get a Gold Fedora, but that will never happen...)*
---
he's still a mediocre killer after all, playing him against smart survivors will get you 1k or maybe 2k at max
---
You‚Äôll wake up to this going viral
---
He's cancer lol.  I've said he's basically just Bubba with face paint for a while.  A large chunk of them like to proxycamp hard at hooks and use their ability to tunnel you back down.  Lots of bm too like spamming bottle refresh, chucking them at you while facecamping etc...not sure if this is most peoples experience with them but they often play scummy as shit in my games.
---
bc it was never on the shrine before, first time it's always 2.7k
---
Same. Calm Wilderness attracted me.
---
GOD DAMN HIGH PING LOBBIES. IT'S EU NOT ANTARCTICA!
---
With most killers you find a survivor and chase them until they are down.
---
You don't with Freddy and if you do you are not getting any use out of his power at all.
---
Yet people try him out, play him that way and then think that he is the worst killer.
---
The new abilities are alright but I do not want them on my main and not being able to play my favorite killer anymore because people fail to realize not all killers are played the same way.
---
ofc this post get downvoted and all comments defending current Freddy since the mayority of people are too brainwashed by the memes to realize how good he actually is.
---
True
---
You press shift. Before that change you werent able to do anything . I had someone dc,who was healing me and I couldnt do anything anymore,because he was technically still healing me
---
Probably the only game where I'm not excited to reach higher ranks. I've been playing with limited time the last few weeks. A bunch of low rank people have sent me GGs. About to hit rank 10 killer and survivor and I'm already seeing how bad it's gonna be.
---
It won't bother me, but I know it's gonna suck the fun out of what I've been experiencing so far when I hit the threshold.
---
The imagery these two comments brought in my mind...
---
I am guessing you are one of those rank 1 survivors that claim that they lost because "bad teammates" when they lose against Freddy.
---
I am not talking about NOED. I am talking about your 50IQ ass claiming that it's okay to be toxic if someone runs a certain perk.
---
That's retarded to say. So I imagine that you aren't the "brightest tool in the shed".

The roller coaster of emotions where they drop you near the hatch, then close it, then down you again after adrenaline pops, then carry you to the door and let you open it, then down and mori you once you get the gate open

This actually happened to me on my first game xD. Same killer and same Dwight. All of my teammates left me when I was in the dying state. What Clown did was he carried me to hatch and gave me my first victory on my first game. Now, when I go killer, I always make sure to give the last dude hatch. Warms my heart when they say thank you at the end :)

Well with the upcoming partnership with Netflix I would say the demogordon from stranger things but with the upcoming cosmetics that are going for sea/jungle theme I‚Äôm not sure anymore.

I definitely get a lot of the same killers repeatedly on PS4. Especially around the time I play.

He was the angry Jock type, which is goth jock is. The Jock Jock type is the ones who excel at their sport but don't actually drink much if at all because that's how they are good at their sport. They can't compromise their achievement by drinking alcohol.

That‚Äôs interesting so a stranger things dlc hmm never really watch it I‚Äôve seen rumors on this topic I‚Äôm down for some sea/jungle cosmetics

So what did he do?

Didn‚Äôt try it on Facebook. There are YouTube tutorials to show you how to download it on your phone. I live in the US and it worked.

No, hag is way too small

Did that ever actually happen? Also, did the huntress come with a survivor?
---
I like the way you think
---
Word thanks I‚Äôll into it anything else you excited for?
---
Unfortunately your were being tunneled down by a toxic pig who just wanted a secured kill. In that case your only real hope is your teammates figure out what happened and leave asap so you at least have a chance to get the hatch.

jeff isnt jesus, he is god

A survivor perk sounds fair
---
Oh shit that‚Äôs next week fuck me I haven‚Äôt be on DBD in a minute to busy playing new games that are out you a PC or console?
---
There's a difference between suspension of disbelief and just straight up going against the character. he was threatening in silent hill because he was slow, deliberate. he was terrifying in a five meter long room. now have him be able to outrun everyone while still keeping a walk; it'd look out of place.
---
Well come to hell. I hope you enjoy your stay, where you‚Äôll find only 3 killers ,nurse, spirit and hillbilly, but congrats nonetheless just brace yourself for the nightmare that is red ranks.

If I do this, will the auric cells  and purchased killers translate when (after the game is released everywhere) I download it through my apple id (US) and sync it with my facebook?

I thought they were implementing that where we would be getting survival points based on how long you survived the match. I thought they mentioned it in a post about re balancing bloodpoints for survivors so multiple play styles would be as beneficial.
---
Wtf is that üòÇ

yes but by the time you ate half of them, the gens are done

...and if you‚Äôre not down with that, DX trapper has [2 words for ya ](https://tenor.com/view/dx-suck-it-wwf-gif-12703155)
---
That sprint burst is attractive
---
Suggests not to hide when you hear the heartbeat. But I carry Urban Evasion 100% of the time, and hiding behind a tree results in not being found 8/10 times. Even in red ranks.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and rank 3 ghostface because I depipied  from rank one
---
we had artistic renders of these as well as the full leaked album for a few days, but it's nice to see in-engine
---
I can‚Äôt wait for this
---
Personally I will target the shit survivors who farm teammates and let the hooked survivor get some more play time.
---
After about 500 hours of play time you start to care less about blood points and more about gameplay fun.
---
There's gonna be a dream pallet nerf?
---
Handsome leatherface ftw
---
Pallet loops are already infuriating enough lmao. good perk idea tho
---
The renders look sick, but people really need to know how the outfits will actually look ig \^\^
---
Most of the time slugging is pointless. You get less points for it and overall it just waste everybody's time trying to pick up everyone. Slugging to look for the last person can be optimal at times but I really don't recommend making slugging as a regular thing.
---
That sum topkek shit right there
---
Shadowborn, Enduring, Brutal Strength, Bamboozle. Shadowborn because default killer FoV is freaking nauseating, the rest to deal with chases. Go with two ‚Äòshorten distance to Reveal‚Äô addons to make it easier to stay Cloaked in chase, or two charge increases to you can cloak faster after breaking it.
---
I just mean you can use your own Apple ID whether you live in the United States, the UK or Denmark. You just follow this tutorial to download it using your own Apple ID and you can buy the cells from your account as opposed to your friends. 
---

---
It's super hard to precisely keep a sprint burst like that unless you want to not do any gens and just sprint around the map all the time. 
---
Otherwise, it's a good perk. you use it once to either speed your way up to a gen or get a quick burst away from a killer while you're busy but it's to get distance away from the killer. It's about as easy to use sprint burst to avoid a hit as it is to do a 360 or use adrenaline. 
---
and you can counter it; just keep chasing them.
---
Nothing currently announced but knowing BHVR..... who knows.
---
I get it. It ain't funny, but I get it.
---
Please no
---
Death is not an escape üò≠
---
Haha. That moment was so good :D
---
I find it boring and you get a lot less points
---
Its where the nsfw stuff goes bud
---
Would you like to play against yourself? If yes, than it's not toxic in your book
---
the killer has to be hit. as killer im p good at baiting pallets w/o getting hit by them  
---
if you're against a good killer Breaker would be like a sprint burst that you never get to use
---
yes they will.
---
Ok dude
---
I don‚Äôt understand the Paramedic name for the first one. It does t remove the blood, just scratches so the name doesn‚Äôt fit.
---
I just want her to look feminine is that to much to ask for
---
God I love that coat
---
well i make sure im smart with the slugging so ik when to leave them and when to hook them so i cna get the sacrifice points  but most of the time i am knocking them down for the slugg. and the idea is to waste survivors time right? they focus on healing instead of gens
---
i always thought he was making the face i do when having to wear a turtleneck sweater
---
Streamer idolization, the decline of humanity.
---
Claude is great for all of her perks. Self-care is great but Empathy is really under rated and an awesome perk that has saved my but a ton. Most people see it as a perk to farm healing points, which admittedly it is, though it is also useful to track killers on the map. By seeing the aura of an injured survivor you can tell if they are in a chase or not and help track the killer and if they are coming your way. Also it can help you see if they are wasting pallets.
---
close enough
---
Yeah, because she doesn't really smash the pallet with her katana. She just kind of smacks it and then it breaks.
---
Huntress tho, could have some sick animations for breaking pallets if they wanted to rework them.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs just you.
---
The doctor likes getting patted? Who wouldve guessed! Gonna try that out next time I face him
---
idk i found it fun going around chainsawing peeps and finding the next guy. but were different people right.
---
The problem is right now it's exploitable to allow you to sprint normally and activate the exaustion whenever you want. I just had a match with 4 people doing it and taunting me by making loops last significantly longer and cover there mistakes. This shouldn't be a thing.
---
what do you mean play against myself?
---
They addressed this in the devstream where they talked about him: it doesn‚Äôt distinguish between real and fake, but it only shows fake while asleep.
---
A lot of people are saying its broken but all you have to do is slug people for 20/40 seconds. Also if it only works the first time you get downed its more likely to be triggered in early game, when the entity hasnt claimed that many hooks. it should be hard to find one nearby  
---
Also I main pig so for me personally, this perk is shit lmao
---
Again it can be useful but it's just a huge time waster and turns the match into a slow drag. Honestly when I see a Killer doing a slug build I want to get sacrificed as quickly as possible and load into a new game.
---
Honestly I think the ptb is just to make sure they don‚Äôt add anything game breaking, then they worry about balance later.
---
Slugging works very well if you know when to do it. It can create more pressure by getting another survivor off a gen. If someone gets unhooked and you run into them again, slug for ds. If you down someone and you see someone nearby whos injured, slug the person you just downed to down another. Slugging with one gen left is risky though because of Adrenaline, so keep that in mind.
---
I really like the detail of the red light coming from the clown
---
Which makes nurse balanced how exactly? She downs someone the instant they‚Äôre found, giving them no opportunity to use windows and pallets to lose her.
---
Even if they make it to a pallet or window, nurse can just blink through it and continue the chase with no downtime, completely negating any effect that the window or pallet might have had.
---
I understand where you‚Äôre coming from, and it‚Äôs true in the case of almost every killer, but my comment was referring to specifically nurse, for whom you‚Äôre comment is invalid.
---
YES
---
I actually did notice this. Thought it was a cool throwback to the original movie.
---
this is a really good diagram! Hats off to you :)
---
When the hero runs loudly into a locker in the middle of a chase I always put hero on the hook to try to train the hero. Hehe.
---
We might get him as a killer
---
Okay then what would *you* suggest?
---
I love how this game is just filled with little easter eggs, like Hillbilly is just littered with them from Texas Chainsaw
---
I don't think the Freddy rework is OP. I do think it's a misguided mess that is annoying to play against -- not harder than any other killer, just less fun.
---
Then again, I'm not a P3 Claudette. üòè
---
*girlish squeal* found you, you little betch!
---
Fine, if you wanna get smacked, you‚Äôll get smacked
---
Krampus is an awesome idea! I really like the idea of adding more non human killers kind of similar to how hag is designed to look .
---
for real though, who plays online games at McDonald's and expects low latency?
---
i tought he was ü§î
---
Oh yes I like this much better than the artist one. Finally some more delicious Jane cosmetics
---
This is great. I have to learn to meme make now. I'm missing on so much grand karma
---
You said you use a wired connection so I imagine the survivors probably were on WiFi. 
---
There are instances of ‚Äòdesynch‚Äô which can cause this around certain map structures, the devs are aware of this and are fixing more of them every patch with a mention in the patch notes.
---
Cool idea, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs evil enough for the entity‚Äôs taste though.
---
Idk. If there really was a killer able to disguise itself as a survivor‚Äôs I think that something they could do is make the killer have some sort of freeze power. If a survivor is within 30 meters of the killer for 40 seconds and not in a chase their location is revealed and they can‚Äôt move for 7 seconds
---
Part of the crew, part of the ship
---
Poor freddy
---
Sometimes it's not fair tho, I got this afk doctor the whole match till we opened the gates, I was leaving while I start hearing the heartbeat and while trying to use lithe by vaulting a window I got a slow vault and he got me with NOeD and camped me and my teammates couldn't do anything. I then asked him why he was camping and he said "to secure the kill" but there's no point, I know that we both got a depip because we didn't see the killer the whole match and he didn't do shit, in the end I got bored for the whole 5 generators, got camped for about 2 minutes and got a depip :) (he also called me salty bc I complained, I wouldn't have complained if he didn't camp me, he could've just farm with use since even if he got a kill he still got a depip)
---
He's not my top pick either, but i don't find him that bad. His editing is on point though.
---
I like tru3 too but ever since ghostface happened he seems quite defeated, and i feel that when freddy gets nerfed he will break completly.
---
Old Freddy wasn't even that bad, just started playing him before the ptb, just had a different play style really. Just my opinion though
---
If he's not a stealth killer, explain his invisibility to awake survivors outside of a certain range.
---
Like hypnosis.
---
Trolled ebic style üòéüòéüòéüòéüòé
---
Because generator speed isn‚Äôt an issue at high ranks
---
I can't wait for this
---
On live servers or ptb?
---
I think they must have implemented a threshold system or something and not told us. I have noticed a weird thing where the longer of a que I have the more range in levels I see in players. I had a killer game where at 12 I faced a 18, two 5s and a 9. I know it might be a SWF group though they joined in the lobby about 40 seconds apart.
---
Honestly I hope they'll take the time to redesign some of their older Killers rather than add new ones.
---
Not in the Freddy way, but more in a way to make them all feel more unique. 
---
Things like changing Trapper and Wraith's lame Moris, making it so not nearly every Killer just stomps on pallets, gens, and the hatch, giving them chase animations like Ghostface, giving them unique chase music, and maybe giving the Killer's with visible faces more dynamic expressions like Spirit does.
---
Maybe I'm alone in this, but honestly I wouldn't mind going six or nine months without a new chapter if it meant they would give some love to our current cast of characters.
---
He's saying would you like to play against a killer that plays like you do
---
Opinions can't be wrong but ok. You're the one typing essays üòÇüòÇ
---
My dumb ass thought that was a whistle for the longest time
---
Yes I know, already clicked on it
---
What the living hell is that?
---
Basically
---
i did not realize that. if this is a PTB issue it'll probably be fixed before next patch, same even if it's not PTB.
---
When my friends pull me away from my beloved position as Killer to help them in SWF, it's more of a mix of both honestly. We don't really plan that hard, but there's a lot of "NO FUCK OFF LET ME SAVE HIM I HAVE DELIVERANCE" and "YOU FUCKING IDIOT YOU LET HIM FARM TIER 3 OFF OF YOU" and such, not to mention that one friend who's like 12 ranks higher than everyone else who runs DS, Deliverance, DH, and SC every match as Lori and makes the Killer want to die the whole match through.
---
That would also be nifty. I just think the loping around, form, and teleportation/moving through the map is very similar to how Hag works
---
Stranger things thing, I think
---
The Demogorgon from Stranger Things
---
&gt;Buy ~~Jeff~~ you won‚Äôt regret it

You mean thicc Jesus
---
Are girls allowed to play this game?

Ah yes my bad fellow intellectual

What? The?

I'm pretty much the only Dwight main I see in red ranks
---
Go figure my screen name is Baby Dwight too
---
Why is meg a jocky jock
---
Yea, If I am going get face camped might as well it's be a sexy face.
---
You're correct. Brain pulled a dumb.
---
Mangopurrs is my gt.
---
Will buy!
---
Just slug
---
Didn't they fix that in the last patch?
---
I played Hag for the first time to get a daily and went up against survivors that sabotaged all my hooks. So frustrating. I just ended up slugging everyone and it kinda sucked. Still got three people tho!
---
"Competent players", as in the ones who regularly play. Not the competitive players that play for 8 hours a day. I mean the players that actually pay attention. Like the middle ground. You're 100% correct, this isn't a competitive game, and shouldn't be balanced for Rank 1 only.
---
i've had similar issues, but when attempting to throw pallets. i shot back a few meters and threw the pallet down, with the killer right behind me.
---
My friend is telling me how spirit is amazing, I just need 500 auric cells lol.
---
You don't argue with opinions (:
---
So cute ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
This theme suits her so much more than any other character. Awesome cosmetics.
---
It‚Äôs ok on spirit, but bbq, surveillance, or discordance is better imo
---
One of the top tier characters and her mindgames are *spicy*
---
No.
---
What?
---
I have a feeling the Netflix thing will be unrelated to DBD. I'm expecting they're working on something new, like how bhvr is helping on a game of thrones mobile game for HBO
---
I knew he was holding his throat, but I never made the connection until you mentioned it because I'm not really a big Saw fan.
---
Thrilling Tremors is a good anti Gen perk and helps find your next target, but the combo of BBQ and Ruin just does the job better. You could stack the two  though.
---
That would work too.  Hypnosis is a pretty big motif of the They Live monsters, along with camouflage.
---
Against killers using your build and playstyle
---
Ooopfh my back hurts...
---
We still lost though, Feng DCd and the killer slugged the other two again and came for me.
---
Against killers playing your build and playstyle
---
You shouldn't take damage when breaker activate if your already injured.
---
Very nice, I'll probably save these and show them to my brother when he gets home.
---
Daed hatd is wwwwwaaaaaayyyyy overrated. Id suggest using lithe instead.
---
Ggs mate
---
Or the Xbox and Playstation apps with the whole remote control thing and keyboard so you just type on your phone.
---
Are u feeling generous right now?
---
I noticed it start to get really bad at green ranks, then I saw it start to slowly get worse into purple and then calm down a bit into red. Could just be my experience though
---
I think ash would also be a jock jock he‚Äôs not particularly goth but everything else hella accurate I never thought to do this üòÇ And I think there needs to be a category for like greasers/rebels bc Nea is more of a Greaser Jock
---
What does SFM mean or SWF??
---
I really hope the next chapter is back to an original killer and survivor.
---
What's BM mean in DBD? Sorry, not sure I want to risk googling this one. üòè
---
Complete with beer running down her leg into Ace's mouth
---
Doctor says hi
---
Due to overly altruistic SWF groups, camping bubbas normally get 4ks and rank up. Especially insidious bubba.
---
I barely watch streamers at all and I'm not subbed to any. But keep telling yourself that buddy
---
I get what your saying, but no one is arguing that.  If killers didnt get more bloodpoints then survivors, then I would personally only play survivor.
---
Old trapper setting traps animation
---
Yeah, it's a free dlc
---
Honestly TCM 1 is so great. Glad BHVR did their homework.
---
*then again Hillbilly is literally Leatherface, just not the look*
---
Yeah now that I think about it the second they figure out what you're doing it becomes extremely predictable
---
One word, depiping. Camping lowers your emblem score and essentially allows you to 3k or 4k while also losing a pip. And we all know who the king of camping is...
---
I fought Huntress and David were free on every platform.
---
*me who uses unrelenting because I suck* 
---
*under my breath*
---
Maybe some people need unrelenting...
---
BEAUTIFULLY TIMED
---
I approve of this
---
I'm literally agreeing with you. it's obvious and doesn't need saying. The point of this post is that Hex: Ruin is a high risk perk that *sometimes* really helps. It can be useful, that's obvious, but if you're not getting what you need out of it that means it's time to look for alternate strategies
---
I think he Deliverance'd because he got the Broken effect, but still, the timing was perfect!
---
I swear it always prompted me to spend 9000 shards on her
---
I know she was never in my playable killers list until last night
---
is that... a big meat stick ??? why 
---
im probably gonna get it but who made this lol idk what i feel towards it
---
Something that I find quite interedting is how whenever I look for tips or an explanation and it goes to the steam forums of DbD there's like, at least two banned people on the topic lmao
---
Wild emotional ride beginning to end
---
Rank 1 Spirit main here. TT is not a top tier perk. Go with BBQ, Discordance, Ruin or Devour. Nurse's with Sloppy is a great combo. M&amp;A with prayer beads is popular too. Btw you can use in game currency to buy her, you don't need Auric cells
---
You're just wrong. Literally go watch Marths experiment. He wins against the best killers in the game with above 90% win ratio. That is not the sign of a balanced game. Survivors having 75% survival ratios at the highest ranks is not signs of a balanced game. The fact that you need to play a Killer (nurse) who is so overpowered that she should've never been developed for this game at all to even have a chance at winning, and even still lose is not signs of a balanced game.
---
You will be the reason this game does.
---
Obviously the emo teenager.
---
I mean, have you *heard* her mixtape?
---
Does this break the hitbox of the locker so they can't leave, or were they just that scared of a trap?
---
I agree; the time to BP ratio is not worth it IMO. I'd much rather just get into a new lobby.
---
CAN WE GET MORE INTERESTING DAILIES. FED UP OF THEM ALL BEING GET 3 HITS WITH YOUR CHAINSAW.
---
I have my PSN messages set to private because of the amount of salt and toxic stuff you get sent (especially if you're playing killer).
---
I‚Äôm gonna take a stab in the dark and say you‚Äôve never seen a clip of someone abusing the perk to infinite-stun a killer.
---
Or the survivors can end the game against Billy/Nurse in 5 minutes. I've literally lost matches in 2-3 minutes as Billy pre BNP nerf. How can you be this dishonest?
---
To avoid toxic shitlord whining I'd imagine
---
I main Myers and do this all the time. I just feel bad for torturing their pals so quickly but I think the last survivors are more afraid of my face to believe I will lead them to the hatch.
---
sometimes?
---
She's so thic lol. Bout to drop it like it's hot on that killer.
---
Indeed ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I‚Äôd swap her with ace honestly
---
How does that even happen
---
That's odd. Good thing you didn't though
---
Part of what got me hooked on the game. A random hunter guided us through how I do the gens and win. It was our own little tutorial that he didn‚Äôt need to do
---
What kind of scumbag can‚Äôt spend 5 dollars on a killer? Goes and asks a subreddit for it, then proceeds to say Thank You in Advance. Like you expect one of us to give you 5 fucking dollars. Don‚Äôt beg this isn‚Äôt the place for it. But here I will help you out.
---

Don‚Äôt be a scum bag get it your damn self. I‚Äôm not gonna spend my hard earned money on you and neither is any other random person.
---
These are all really good ideas! Personally I love breaker the most. Justice sounds great but it might be a little OP as is, but I don't know how I'd change it. It would make sabo strategies way more relevant

Is anybody feeling generous enough to gift me spirit on xbox? My gt is mangopurrs.

Original Poster

It‚Äôs not really a horror game and shouldn‚Äôt be balanced as such
---
Was their name Madam Legit by any chance? I've come across a Huntress with that name a few times, and every single game has really questionable lag that spikes up once the gates are open and always ends in a 4K. Lag to the point where in a 20 second time span 4 injured survivors all go to dying state after movement stops.

Originally I had the warden's power be like a maze of halls which is clearly inspired from 106 haha but then I thought it would be a bit imbalanced and strange
---
What planned Dream Pallet nerf??
---
thought the dude was just stroking his chin
---
Same. i wouldn't want to deal with that shit as killer, and some of these people really need to be put in their place. 
---
once i sent a friend request to the killer following another survivor telling them to "kill yourself" and told them that survivor was full of shit, and they did nothing wrong (killer had left the chat before i could reply).
---
That's beautiful timing
---
Who do I get lithe from?
---
* Reposts within the last 60 days are not permitted.
---
I mean, if killer dc's survivors lose their offerings and go down a rank. Not any compensation there that I am aware of. Killer recieves at least some form of compensation.
---
On some of my killers, I just don't have useful perks. I don't feel like running Bitter Murmers and Unrelenting on my Doc just because they're tier 3. 
---
I also don't have Ruin, so I run NOED because if I can't play the early game, I might as well play the late game.

:/

Yes... but actually, no!

how to give the killer depression 101

Do not quote me but if I remember correctly he said something like "Head on is busted or broken" in the after game chat :D

Yeah the thing that annoys me rn is I'm getting punished for someone else trying to depip, really goddamn pissing me off
---
Yea, and you can't Dead Hard if the Warden is trying to sentence you, since you suffer from Exhausted. It also takes away possible Adrenaline plays, or Lithe/Balanced/Sprint Burst.
---
Maybe make it so the killer power has a cooldown, and everytime you sentence a person 2 times, you get a token, for a max of 4 tokens. For every token make the cooldown shorter by 1-2 seconds, idk.
---
He's asking if it's a good strategy, not if it's toxic.
---
Y e s
---
* **Paramedic** - Allows for risky plays and on certain maps (The Game) this can really be a life saver. Should also probably hide Bloodstains though. A bit weak on its own but it could be merged into another perk. (Buckle Up?)  
---
4/5 Design, 5/5 Balance
---
* **Blood Hero** - Basically the Mettle of Man effect right? It's interesting but really situational, and suffers from the problem that if someone else opens the gate you don't get it. Allows for risky plays though. Another effect I'd love to see merged onto another perk. (Wake Up)  
---
5/5 Design, 4/5 Balance
---
* **Justice** - Really wonky effect that I feel would be a bit too hard to program, and is a bit too situational. Could also be extremely obnoxious to play against.  
---
3/5 Design, 3/5 Balance
---
* **Breaker** - Missing the ever-crucial "does not work while Exhausted" text but I think that's implied. On topic this is essentially just a more conditional version of Lithe. It's an interesting idea but I doubt it would ever be run. 5/10
---
* **Timed Wealth** - I don't think anyone would run a perk that in essence reads "spawn one extra chest." (The effect of a Yellow offering) I think the idea is really cool and there are ways to retool this to perhaps be allowed to "trade in" an item for another item of the same rarity (and probably same durability to avoid exploits), so if you got a Green Medkit from Pharmacy and wanted a toolbox you could trade the Medkit for a Toolbox.  
---
5/5 Design, 2/5 Balance
---
~
---
Overall interesting ideas that I think are a bit too weak on their own but could easily be merged with other perks for very fun and potent gameplay.
---
on live, it's been here for like 4 patches
---
Had a match like this couple days ago. Killer DCed and we all went down a rank.
---
it's on live, it's been here for like 4 patches
---
nope
---
The killer then bamboozled us all by killing himself
---
I‚ÄôM REALLY FUCKING SICK OF THIS STUPID FUCKING BUG THAT STOPS ME USING ANY PERKS THAT REQUIRE YOU TO PRESS A BUTTON/WIGGLE/RECOVER/SEE MINE &amp; OTHERS HEAL PROGRESSION. BHVR PLS.

Of course! You are correct. So by unhooking himself too soon he doomed them all.

Still rocking the outfit that dropped with clown lol

I didn‚Äôt know you could use the app to chat in game.

The thing that sucks is that when jake finally gets a cosmetic instead of it being something that's cool or looks good they make him an ugly mining child

You can check my twitch account for yourself. Why would I lie about something so mundane?

Spirit is fine. She's probably the most balanced killer in this game

And deprive you of BP if the survivor dies after one hook.

She needs Jesus

Right, we're obviously playing barbie's ponyfarm and she's chasing us with god damn delicious cake. Jokes aside - the devs declare it as a horror game and that's what it is, there's no debate here. The fact that some people downvoted me tells me that obviously it's hard for some people to remember a few pallet spots or they didn't like me saying that, but god help me, then they don't belong in any rank better than rank 14, I'm serious. Knowing the resources (pallets/windows) and how to use them efficiently is what it comes down to in this game.
---
No get it yourself. Ask mommy or daddy you fuckin mooch
---
Issa joke, nothings been announced, hence ‚Äúhaven‚Äôt shown yet‚Äù
---
Hop off him for missing 3%
---
You wanna be anal about such a small ass number yet get mad when people act anal to you over it.
---
I think a lot of people would really like that, but unfortunately that has less pull to players than a new killer or survivor and new perks. Brand new shiny thing usually brings in initial heaps. Not saying it won't happen, just that these things are usually on the back burner at best until they become a significant enough quality problem that their player retention is falling
---
-this post was made by the jew gang-
---
Literally all the survivors are the same, you can put any perks on them that you've unlocked.
---
HOLY SHIT
---
How am I going to break a hook while I'm downed?
---
If a Jake has a hat, he gets to escape if he's the last one
---
I would 100% take Freddy over spirit at high ranks. Fuck spirit
---
Mao Mao: Heroes of Pure Heart.
---
*it's good, okay?*
---
I swear by breakdown! It really comes in handy when the exit gates are open and you get hooked next to the one near it. Or just in general for campers as it wastes their time having to look for another hook.
---
I've got the same problem, but I got it on video.
---
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ

I dont play Pig bcs i like her power i play her bcs i like her design and love the first Saw movies.(And that lovely stun squeak)  Yeah her power can kill you but cmon Myers can do that too,and lets be honest the main purpose of it is to waste survivor time.Other Pig players will brake my bones for what im going to say but IMO our pork is pretty weak.And i dont think that she will get a buff. I like to compare her to Traper both are weak but Trapers addons are actualy doing something.
---
why would he reset?
---
Pretty weird, hopefully you‚Äôll report this right
---
I mean from the moment I see Jeff it's inaccurate.
---
Yes, give me another reason to almost pee myself when she pops up looking like this. üò≠
---
Not remotely true. The current implementation of player collision in this game is garbage, which is why it constantly gets exploited. Fixing it would be easy.
---
First, make the player colliders a sane size. Look at that video. There's a couple feet on either side of Meg's actual body that "realistically" you should be able to shove past easily.
---
Second, add some goddamn physics. If a killer barrels into a crouching Feng Min at 20 mph, she absolutely should not behave like an immoveable fucking boulder. She should go sprawling and need a brief animation to get back up, or at the _absolute minimum_ slowly get pushed out of the way. The same concept should apply when a survivor walks/runs into another survivor. 
---
Third, if there are still any situations left where it causes problems after the above fixes, look at games like _Silent Hill_ that have "squeeze through a narrow space" interactions. This would work similarly to vaulting, but allow a survivor to basically slowly shimmy around another survivor that's blocking them. Make it too slow to be useful in a chase, but prevent survivors from trapping each other in narrow spaces (accidentally or intentionally).
---
Was asking a question, you didnt need to reply you fucking neek.
---
Don‚Äôt disrespect him, let him have the childhood his parents robbed him off
---
Havent seen a mention of Bill. Is he that bad?
---
The same problem: https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
---
He pulls the clown‚Äôs cart/trailer IIRC
---
they are, who in their right mind farms a game then thinks an end teabag out the gate is malicious
---
Feng Min has lithe on her. It takes a little geting used to, because not every window or pallet is safe to vault, but its satisfying to not just get away, but to really get away with lithe.
---
They should sell animation packs for survivors and killers. Since we're paying they'll have more motivation to make them.
---
As a Dwight main I‚Äôm hurt but at the same time Jeff isn‚Äôt the only chad
---
I think the most annoying thing is the teleport. Sure you get a warning but nowhere near enough time to get away. 
---
It‚Äôs going to be another slaughter at 20-12 ranks, 50/50 11-8, then bullied still at 7-1
---
And it could change with brutal strenght to something even more agressive. I think it would be neat
---
It's okay, just go heal at one of the conveniently located fountains. Encourage your friends to do so as well. It is very important to be healthy and there's definitely no reason not to cleanse at a fountain.
---
I answered your question get a fucking job you mooching piece of shit
---
so...you're complaining that they gave you a more fun moveset? interesting
---
Pls be purchasable with shards...
---
Yeah I've always wondered why the killer closes the hatch faster than a Survivior jumps in
---
my friend looked at my profile, it‚Äôs there for him so i‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs just a visual thing
---
These are really great ideas!
---
Send me ur credit card number and pin, ill plug it for ya
---
&gt; more fun moveset
---
full disclosure, i am not a freddy main, never played him in either iteration, but this statement is an opinion. OP may not like the new "more fun moveset"
---
You can use shards to get her.
---
Awesome, thank you! (:
---
Found the little kid who downvotes anything that he doesn't like
---
Yeah, but... https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
---
If only david had a legacy skin :/
---
You know we can see the video's thumbnail, right?
---
They work and they won't expire so don't worry about losing them
---
Thank you! Someone finally gets it. Freddy was not fun on either side. 
---
From what ive heard, the new Freddy is super fun to vs as a survivor now
---
Okay. Where do i sign up?
---
Yea I can understand why this is bad how I‚Äôm using this bug
---
Oh yes
---
Seems like some salty survivors are downvoting your comment. I‚Äôve had teams try to aggressively run at my face while one of them tries to get their friend off, who I hooked less than 30 seconds ago. Guess I should just let the injured guy go immediately? I know exactly what your complaining about dude, and it‚Äôs a huge double standard.
---
I also think it‚Äôs funny how every killer is ‚Äútunneling‚Äù if they kill someone early. Facecamping is one thing, but like you said, don‚Äôt rush the hooks if you don‚Äôt want to give your friend a shitty chance of getting away. It‚Äôs not the killer‚Äôs job to make sure everyone has ‚Äúgood clean fun,‚Äù especially if you‚Äôre making unnecessary, foolhardy reduces.
---
To be fair, even if you like it, you cant deny that Freddy was not fun to go agasint as a survivor. It was just boring.
---
I don't know, but this is why I don't consider Insta heals toxic, cause it can prevent matches ending almost instantly like how it could have here. 
---
Also, these were red rank survivors. Smh.
---
It's an A+ for concept and a D- for execution. She should be bashing it with the hilt or something.
---
They should also move away from it always being two stomps/smacks, would give them some room for character personality. Trapper and Mikey are two thick boys who should be crushing pallets in one go, Plague should be swinging her censer for momentum before hitting it, just all the pallet animations need a rework.
---
You're not wrong.......
---
Wait what?
---
Damn! That's some solid work!!!!
---
In my last 2 game dive given last survivor hatch, literally, no BS closing it right after
---
Oh just a visual glitch but still it could be reported tho
---
David can literally hurt himself before the trial and Go the whole thing without healing. That is a goth jock if I've ever seen one
---
Legion got a rework tecacally and nearly everyone was happy with it because they were not fun to play agasint as survivor. Freddy was the same. He was terribly unfun as survivor. I think Nurse and Billy belong here as well. 
---
Games rework characters. You gotta learn to deal with it. Take League for example. You know how many times they end up reworking characters in that game? 
---
Also saying nothing is left is just dumb. He still: Has the Dreamworld, Some invisblity, puts survivors into the dream world. Everything he had is still there jsut better.
---
It's pointless, he has Terror Radius anyway
---
I just liked that he was a survivalist, but yeah I ran Calm Spirit as well lol
---
I think if they add new gamemodes it would make lobbies take even longer. I'd like temporary ones for events though.
---
Why? As long as the Entity nabs James as well, why couldn't it construct it's own Pyramid Head based on his memories and shattered psyche?
---
I mean that's how the maps in DbD exist anyway, I don't think it's too much of a stretch.
---
In any case Silent Hill already messed up much of the symbolism behind Pyramid Head themselves by having Pyramid Head reappear in a number of later games sans James.
---
Praobly because Pallets are an add on, so its good to judge it without add ons first.
---
But she does look feminine \^\_\^
---
I can wait for this
---
Your comparison kinda lacks. Its like going to Wendys they give you a rotten nugget first and then something else, presumeably better of their menu. I guess you are kinda true but the old Freddy was just trash and got trolled left and right. You couldnt properly play him at high ranks and have fun. So its kinda fine
---
True, but playing Killer is even more so to me I quickly realized ;)
---
*Killer emotes when?*
---
&gt; It was just boring.
---
i 100% agree with that. i was just playing devil's advocate. i love playing spirit, but i'm sure there are those who hate playing as her.
---
I mean he is holding the game hostage
---
If you have questions feel free to use Google. The games been out for a few years now
---
Yeah except you already shown you're some salty killermain c#nt who's angry ata someone shittalking the braindead killer he mains. Or should I say she because that's how you argue.
---
Actually, a big part of the community doesn't remember that he exists (as he has been a PC exclusive)
---
Bill has the worst perk in the game and two great perks, but both are situational
---
Surveillance.
---
I think her power is fine but her lagging body makes it impossible to loop her properly
---
I'm 16 and I've just finished school and you're a grown man spending ur time on reddit arguing with people. Fix up you wet wipe.
---
Did you know if you DC during the Mori animation, the animation still completes and they get the 1000 points as well as 650 Quitter bonus points? I love when survivors DC during mori, it makes it extra spicy
---
yea, but it's a very big part of his kit and there are 3 add-ons that let you have them. Snares are terrible, pallets are amazing. I don't feel like anyone's going to play freddy for his snares.
---
What's confusing
---
Actually, he should have done it sooner; earlier, and Blood Warden might have run out before the Collapse timer did. Although it would have been slowed down less because he wouldn't have been hooked for as long...actually, I think him being unhooked at ALL at that point doomed them! If they could have guessed he was running Blood Warden, then the Survivor should have stayed on the hook for everyone else to escape.
---
Source film maker? That‚Äôs a thing for DBD??
---
For real OC is the best in my opinion
---
This is a business ethics question, and I love your analogy between a Wendy‚Äôs and McDonald‚Äôs meal. However, the difference is that online games have a Terms of Service and User agreement. They basically make it clear that you have next to no rights on their game. For the most part, this is fine, but unethical practices can still occur such as false bans and bait and switch. Whatever the customer paid, can easily be switched away.
---
Only worth it late game. I don't do it though. 
---
Doing it early game is just a waste of time for everyone imo. You won't get as many BPs, matchmaking sucks so you'll be waiting ages for your next match, no one wants a match to end within the first 2 minutes.
---
I call it tunneling when the killer goes for the unhooked survivor before they really have a chance to do anything. Downing and hooking the person who got unhooked in front of you is the most clearcut example. Bolting back to the hook after an unhook is the other most common example. Tunneling involves a conscious choice by the killer.
---
I don't think it's tunneling to come across the person later and down them. They had a chance to do stuff, they were found, they lost.
---
I don't think it's toxic to tunnel late game or when facing swf (although granted I think a lot of people are just bad and think they are facing swf and so excuse their toxicity that way).
---
I'm rank 13 and I've seen better survivors what the fuck
---
Billy has to be one of the most fun killers you can go against. He can be countered easily. Insta saw billy is some bs tho.
---
No, but you can use it to type on your phone any time you need to use the on-screen keyboard, so if they implemented a post-match chat like they have on PC, that would be a good use for the app!
---
bad ones
---
Hehe...
---
I always make sure the Dwights die.
---
Because.
---
They are.
---
Dwights.
---
And.
---
All.
---
Must.
---
Die.
---
Ghostfaces daily isn't that bad you just need to lean stalk a Survivor then down them 3 times.
---
Most people on console are braindead children sadly
---
Slugging is quite valid with some killers, but you need to makes sure you never leave 'em to die on the ground. No matter how long you slug 'em if they die you get 50 pity BPs if you hook 'em you get 500 manly Killer BPs not to mention it hurts your chance to pip, the entity doesn't eat of the ground he wants his meal on a hook!
---
Lern 2 spel
---
thanks
---
I find, as with the other person above your comment, that comparing the two foods as one being cuisine or one being rotten isn't a good comparison because that's opinionated.  
---
New Freddy isn't objectively better than old Freddy, it comes down to a personal preference of, do you prefer awake and asleep states or do you prefer being the Lord of Pallets.
---
Hahahahaha gutted I can't see it to be honest. I might make a post asking for a new Ferrari. Haha 
---
I've got every DLC because I want to support the Devs but I wouldn't buy some random child the DLCs to. Just a lack of respect.
---
Is this based off their looks, perks or lore because some of these seem accurate in different ways and then some in no way possible.
---
Just so you guys know this is Switch exclusive
---
bruh, i died
---
There really arent any bad killers just people who are bad at killer.
---
&gt;I suppose it is unethical for them to just swap out a paid for meal.
---
This is my point.
---
You forgot the sweaty Huntress that hits every snipe
---
I just lost a few brain cells reading this.
---
Are hooks gone for good or they get restored later like with sabo?
---
This should also be addressed, amount of times I put on party streamers and the killer leaves because their ruin gets destroyed..it goes both ways, I think it's unfair that when the game loads in the survivors automatically lose a pip and waste an offering when the killer leaves. 
---
Should go both ways I agree!
---
I can wait for this.
---
Because I think it looks horrible and I don't care if it gets added or not.
---
Freddy with dream pallets and bamboozle
---
Rip loops 2019
---
Every time I bring a Mori I don‚Äôt tell tunnel. If I‚Äôm chasing someone else I finish the chase and go on gen patrol. If I run into someone I can Mori and down them, oh well
---
Yes. Snares can let you trigger bloodlust for a start, and they counter loops in the same exact way as a clown slow would, slowing them down, espcally since you can place mutiple down in a single loop to chain slow them.
---
now that you mention it, why in god's name does a little girl have a fucking samurai sword?!?! I get it was like a family relic but like hell she fucking died with it
---
Missed opportunity to call Breaker "Hit and Run", but overall this is pretty damn good!
---
I had an idea of ‚Äúpick up an item 15/20/25% faster
---
Not a great perk I know 
---
But when I don‚Äôt want to spend any more on the bloodweb I go in with an item hunting build. And this would be a cool edition. Specially with Franklin‚Äôs being a somewhat common perk.
---
What the fuck are you doing here ?
---
I dont know if Im suppose to upvote or downvote that XD
---
Pig gets bullied hard at high ranks. Good luck
---
Then you cant claim a killer is easy.
---
What the hell
---
Yeah, totally agree. Thats a pretty good solution. I'm actually a killer main also but sometimes play survivor.
---
lmao i 100% agree with this, snares can be OP if used right, place them at windows or pallet loops and you can get a free hit. people don‚Äôt understand how much difference there is time wise between fast and medium vaults.
---
Ok yeah it is subjectively better. I just don‚Äôt understand how you would ever prefer a Freddy with no mindgame potential. That‚Äôs what Freddy is. He messes with your head. The original Freddy never did that and he was just bad. Like in design. This Freddy is nearly a direct improvement to many people.
---
I thought he was running all this time.
---
Well in most games people dont let killer stalk them after first insta down.
---
Only person here that‚Äôs whining is the kid who posted asking for adults on a sub to buy him something.  Quit acting like a punk fucking kid and grow the fuck up. Get your own shit like everyone else. You‚Äôre pathetic.
---
As someone who runs a chest looting build because I have a hoarding problem with items- Timed Wealth is something straight from my wet dreams.
---
&gt;Has the Dreamworld
---
Literally boiled down to nothing more than an aesthetic world change.
---
&gt;Some invisblity
---
None that is in any way helpful.
---
&gt;puts survivors into the dream world.
---
Again, the dream world is literally nothing more than an aesthetic change.
---
&gt;Everything he had is still there jsut better.
---
No, it isn't and that's just bias bleeding through.
---
I'm biased, your biased, everyone is biased; that aside everyone has to do their best to be objective and to say that "everything he had is still there" is just frankly absurd.
---
Freddy only has invisibility outside of his terror radius, thus, if you hear him coming, you can see him coming.
---
Dream World has *no* side effect what-so-ever. Freddy can no longer sense your aura nor are you slowed down unless he has add-ons. Therefore, there is no side effects to it. Dream World is nothing more than a gimmick. Not a main part of his kit. Lest we not forget he doesn't even need to put people to sleep because apparently every survivor forgot their daily naps before going into a trial with Freddy.
---
Lol why are u so salty over a stupid question, I thought I made it pretty obvious that it wasnt a serious question. Obviously no ones gonna give me ghostface for free so idk why tf u have started whining like an absolute bitch over it syfm
---
Ah, what a coward, take the trap like a man!
---
That's actually really cool. Love it. I always kind of thought he was holding his badge up anime style.
---
He also has a limit to them doesn't he? And survivors need to be asleep I think that balances out the fact that they don't dissappear until you interact with them.
---
Right sub
---
Heres mine. 
---
Killer dailies: as the pig kill one survivor by your hand
---
As leatherface chainsaw 3 people
---
As the wraith uncloak and hit 4 people.
---
Survivor dailies: Non-existant because this game only gives me killer dailies ever because it knows I'm a survivor main
---
Lmfao they are everywhere üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
You could get all the autohaven maps one after the other, then the game and back to another autohaven. *No map offerings were burned*
---
What about head on though. As I feel like breaker and head on would clash. Probably make a few head scratches.
---
sounds bad! i'm guessing it happens on PC. i'm on PS4
---
It honestly is, look at the rank 1 spirit main post. Lol
---
If he did that, I would just immediately stop playing Tapp.
---
***pig is better***
---
Once you unlock the teachables, the stay unlocked regardless of prestiege
---
yep!
---
Haha I'll take a look now.
---
Don‚Äôt worry. If it makes you happy DC penalties are gonna be here in a while
---
Lmfao play it cool kid üòÇüòÇ find another sub to beg from
---
Imagine making a mobile version of a game before adding rank rewards in a ranked only online game
---
&gt;more fun moveset?
---
As u/fuck_you_microsoft so very well put, this is opinionated.  
---
Current Freddy is buckets of fun to me. It is the entire reason why I bought him and mained him for so long. I just tried new Freddy for the first time. He is nothing more than the Lord of Pallets now with an occasional map teleport. That isn't much fun for me. Might be a lot of fun to you, but I paid for something completely different that is *way* more fun but it's being ripped from me.
---
Justice and Decisive Strike would be cancer together.
---
&gt; How would anyone feel if BHVR suddenly said that Nurse was too good, unhealthy for the game, and needed a rework and she became a completely different killer?
---
I'd say about damn time
---
lmao opinions can be wrong if they go against proven facts.
---
In my opinion gravity doesn‚Äôt exist, that can‚Äôt be wrong right?
---
The Dream world can be more then just a look change if you get the action speed add ons. Besides the fact that its much harder to see for suvivors in the dream world, and its becomes really, really hard to track Freddy because of the lullby. 
---
The Dream World isn't meant to be a debuff to survivors, but a buff to Freddy. Which makes sense for his character. People aren't inhertly weaker while they are dreaming, but Freddy is. 
---
He has everything that matters. The action speed slowdown was just not a good mechinaic to play around with.
---
I probably could have explained it better in the post, but there would be a Skill Check as soon as he grabs a Survivor and one every second following the first. So, in total, there would be five Skill Checks. Without Add-ons, a Survivor needs to succeed on 3 to break free. Failing more than 2 will immediately put the Survivor on Jason's so he can carry them to a hook. Hope that helps.
---
People also forget that he can place them down instaly without being slowed at all, and can place like 4 or 5 in a single loop area which can add up.
---
How? They both require exhaustion so you can't use them back to back and both their uses are different.
---
Survivors dont need an excuse to play the game and escape from you. How come all of you cried about MoM yet for some reason dont cry about NOED?
---
Stop whining because you didnt get your 4k handed to you on a silver platter
---
There‚Äôs a difference between being sweaty and being good... huntress takes some skill
---
Pathetic player is all I can say... run ds!  Camping is rank 20 shit and nobody can change my mind on that.

Breaker is a counter to spirit fury enduring, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

U are the saddest human I have ever come across lol ur a grown man responding to kids on reddit I think that just shows how much of a sad life u live
---
I agree. I bought Freddy not just because I like his character/movies, but because of his powers. I have learned how to play him effectively, if I get started right. The devs literally did not have to scrap Freddy's entire kit. All they had to do was remove the many ways survivors had to screw him over. There was a good killer in there, all the devs had to do was dig him out.
---
He‚Äôs a braindead reddit killer. They are a sad bunch of killers. It must be exhausting to have such a victim complex when you‚Äôre supposed to be the power role. I hope they get better.
---
Yeah it's pretty annoying to deal with but auras are broken for killer rn so I can see what gen survivors are on at anytime so it's like I have a perma BBQ so I can't complain too much about sprint burst.
---
i like the old freddy, but i have PS4, so i cant try the new one yet. should be fun to use him like a new killer. but he had a different concept, so i think they shouldve just made a new killer, not change a good one
---
He looks like a child
---
I'm not whining. I simply asked a question without any expectation whereas you're sitting here crying like a bitch about it. Stfu you annoying asshole.
---
Pizza Delivery:Take a break with the killer and eat some pizza together while laughing instead of getting salty,only Dwight mains can use it
---
Pig = Upvote. Oink oink!!!
---
Imagine her destroying the pallet with a single overhead ax swing.       
---
It'd look glorious.
---
But if you've been stunned, you don't have a clear view of where the survivor has gone, and you are stuck in one place for those few seconds as they sprint away. 
---
With lithe, you can actually see where they're going, and you don't have to stand still while they run away, you can close the gap much quicker.
---
A normal pallet stun already gives the survivor more than enough time to get to the next loop, so I think a perk like breaker would be overkill. In the right hands it's a free escape, making it much more OP than any of the other exhaustion perks.
---
I don't see how if they'll just loop you through houses even when broken and don't even let you get corrupt purge
---
It's only 40 seconds though at Max rank sooo they're not down very long. Just long enough so annoy the killer and potentially block for an escape.
---
Yea I know but people act like it's really damn complicated when it's only 2 things you need to do 3 times.
---
YOU are a 13 year old kid with no morals. YOUR parents must be so proud of YOU. Begging other people to spend money on YOU üòÇ
---
This is a great one
---
enlighten me
---
Mind my asking, what is interesting about no warning, being pulled off a gen and slapped on a hook.  
---
Meanwhile being caught and *very minorly* punished for a short period is not in-fact interesting?
---
or maybe have like a "prison break" feature? Like when you sentence someone it lights a totem, and when cleansed, all hooked survivors are released? Giving you a max of 5 sentences, and also using hexes would limit the number of sentences you can use.   
---
Then again, perks have always been the only thing tied to hexes, never totems, so it could be some kind of box around the map that needs to be activated instead. But the totem mechanic would immediately balance this thing outright
---
MAXIMUM THICC
---
I'd still thing call pallets great and snares not that good. I'd rather play hag than pallet-less freddy
---
Head On would cause Exhaustion first, so Breaker wouldn't be able to activate.
---
Your parents must be so proud of their grown son that spends his free time replying to kids on reddit smh
---
Footlong chicken teriyaki sweet onion sause is a right sub
---
Well...the no warning thing cant always happen without add ons. And yes, i will agree that add on is a problem. 
---
How is it any different then freaking instasaw billy that can down you in less then a second?
---
üò≥üò≥what if we kissed in the basementüò≥üò≥
---
Sorry but these perks are actually decent and not dogshit. BHVR only adds F- tier perks for DLC survivors and killers.
---
Bloody hell what a joke. I bet he asks for all DLCs on a few games haha.
---
I tried to do this on the PTB, couldn't reproduce it, I wonder what exactly causes it.
---
He's essentially the lord of pallets with a map-wide teleport on a big cooldown.
---
Better ask mommy for a napkin to wipe those crocodile tears away. So sad that a 16 year old kid wants random people to buy him dlc on a subreddit for the game. The funniest part is you could just play the game and unlock it your self üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
except that it gives the killer her bullshit power. often in 4 man swf my teammates and i don‚Äôt cleanse at all. it makes the game way more fun
---
Just adapt. Killers have a perk that completely neuters sabotage. If sabotage ever becomes meta, killers would just incorporate it into their builds if they wanted to counter it.
---
What is a prep
---
I bet he does lol
---
I‚Äôd pay money for a Sam and dean dlc where there have bonuses to each other if they were together
---
I only ever get killer dailies as well. You‚Äôd think with how bad killer queue times are they‚Äôd maybe change that to encourage people to play survivor more
---

It might be fun for you to play, but did you think about how UNFUN it is to play agasint Freddy? You just have to sit and wait as a timer ticks super slowy, unable to do anything else. 
---
Freddy barely even had a playstyle before. His entire power is just a glorfied passive. Myers has the same problem. 
---
You click them once, and thats it. There is nothing else you can do.
---
More like light on fire and watch it burn
---
The amount of pink is impressive but that's a hard pass for me. Brand new parts aren't worth it anymore imo, I rarely use flashlights and if I do I need 2 batteries cause I suck at them. I'd rather have them all be instaheals lol.
---
STONKS ^^^
---
I always step back and let the survivor through the window if I get there same time, I feel bad. I‚Äôm polite killer.
---
See..the problem is. You can't really buff Freddy. He will then become super unfun to play agasint like he was on release or old legion. 
---
There isn't much as a survivor you acautally do vs a Freddy. You have to just do gens, get pulled in the dream world, then sit and wait 1000 million years for a skill check. All the while, Freddy can see you no matter where you go making it immposbile to do anything. 
---
Thats not fun.
---
Toxic survivors are just going to exploit the Z wall infinites against freddy.
---
Hahaha. This is the first time I've actually witnessed this on Reddit tbh. I've heard of people having a good game and gifting a DLC ect as they have cheered them up. But nothing like this.
---
Annoyed we didnt get black skins for the anniversary...
---
I don‚Äôt really use these either by i night keep them in case of dailies like repairs 3 gens or something like that
---
That's why I never do toxic shit vs killer. Being a survivor main I FUCKING LOVE seeing killers like you who do their job but respect their opponents.
---
Oink squad represent!
---
Some of them are based on looks, others on lore, because it would have been more impossible than it was like this if I were to just base the positions on one thing. It's heavily up to personal interpretation really, because there's just no one "accurate" spot for them.
---
I havent seen one survivor complain about the dream pallets, but I‚Äôve seen at least 10 posts of people complaining about people complaining about dream pallets.
---
Dead if used right is better it's not about dodging hits it's about extending loops so you can get chased for multiple gens. (Rank 1 surv and killer) people using it wrong doesn't make it worse than Sprint burst
---
Why? Whats go great abouy Pallets? Sure they can stop a loop, but: A good survivor can tell a pallet is fake, you need to smart with placement as it can be super obivus when a pallet is fake, pallets don't help you counter window loops, long drop loops, jungle gyms, anything.
---
Yes but I see people run stuff like Sprint burst and Balanced Landing wondering they didn‚Äôt get a boost after jumping off.
---
No it's on everything
---
Bad manners. Tbagging, flashlight clicking, hitting a hooked survivor repeatedly. Basically anything you do to someone that serves no purpose other than  to piss them off.
---
Wow that would be legit
---
*My Anaconda don't...*
---
I'm actually a killer main (well ok, the wait time is fucking attrocious right now so I'm a "dailies" main until it gets fixed).
---
The basic problem is twofold. First, people can't choose when they get unhooked and are completely at everyone's mercy. If they get screwed over by both their teammates and the killer, they can be effectively prevented from playing the game at all. This goes beyond winning and losing to the fundamental reason we play games...to actually play them.
---
The second problem is that for the majority of games it's just not necessary for the killer to do it to still win. If you aren't hot garbage, a team that unhooks right in front of you just declared that you are going to easily win the game. Then it becomes a choice of winning while being toxic and screwing over the person who already got screwed, or winning while not being toxic and getting the unhooker. Until rank 7 or so, any halfway decent killer is going to trounce everyone but the random swf that managed to sandbag.
---
I have empathy for other people and, since we frankly need a selfish reason for most gamers to not be toxic fucks, actually letting people play the game is good for the health of the game and makes it more likely that we will be able to continue to have survivors to play against. The choice is easy for me. I'm going to win anyways, so I am not going to fuck over the person even further. I already caught them, it will happen again.
---
Similarly I see no point in racing back to the hook, especially since that would suggest I'm sitting around close enough to the hook to do so. After I kick gens and break pallets, the only reason to do it is because I want to tunnel, which goes back to the issue of it's toxic and unnecessary.
---
You can (and will) play as toxic as you want, it's not like you are going to face any consequences beyond people saying it's shitty to do. You asked though.
---
Then please enlighten me on how i'm supposed to get more than 2k on that map as clown or bubba
---
oink oink motherfucker
---
Gifting is different lol I see this shit every once in awhile and it‚Äôs sickening man. How‚Äôs anyone going to ask for something from random people and expect to get it. When I was a fuckin kid I mowed lawns just so I could buy shit for my guitar and my ol 360
---
It's a lincensed cosmetic, so I don't think so, but hope I'm wrong
---
me too!
---
Alot, what's your point?
---
That's prestiged meg, not a claudette.
---
Im not gonna lie, i feel the same of freddy not using his claw hand like hags slappy claws, or that bubba and hillbilly dont use their chainsaw on it. nope only 3 smaller and slower female killers are allowed special ways to break pallets that doesn't include their feet
---
I mean that‚Äôs your opinion
---
IF SONEONE ON YOUR TEAM HAD A MAP THEN THAT WAS THEM SETTING A MARKER ON A SPOT IN THE MAP FOR ALL SURVIVORS TO BE ABLE TO SEE
---
*^^Stupid ^^sexy ^^Ghostface*
---
It's my opinion dont like it oh well!
---
Getting hit with a 5 second ds stun and then having them have a dull sprint burst away sounds really unfun.
---
These are all really nice. Paramedic could pair well with we'll make it for those times you have teammates who insist on running away.
---
Blood hero is a very neat concept that could lead to some clutch saves. Breaker seems like it'd be good against the enduring and spirit fury combo.
---
Ok dude I'm not arguing with you about a game avatar... lameeeer
---
America is like a mess right now and I think the root of the problem is exactly as you described. Entitlement is such a wild thing now a days
---
Not sure about you but if you're tracking killer location during a chase with his heartbeat then you're playing the game wrong. You need eyes on the killer, you cannot simply rely on sound. Being in the dreamworld does not make Freddy suddenly impossible to see, he is still easy to see and even if he wasn't the *giant red spotlight attached to his head* ***is***.  
---
The action debuff *is* something that was helpful and another great thing that made him unique. That comes down to opinion I guess but objectively speaking, *everything* Freddy had originally was gutted and butchered. Dreamworld is only helpful with addons and even then it's fuckin' useless because there is literally no downside to it. You don't get your aura shown and you don't suffer action speed penalty. It is *literally* an aesthetic change with no other downsides.
---
Why? It works
---
when i play killer i always feel sorry for Nea and i let her escape

She drinks lota of milk, she don't need no axe to break a pallet

Having decent internet and playing the game on an a decent computer?

Laughs in rank 17

categorizing it as a horror game and balancing it as a horror game are very different.
---
I‚Äôm listening to you but no I haven‚Äôt seen it, and like, I don‚Äôt do it lmao. All I‚Äôm saying is the perk is fun
---
If I'm not in the mood for it, I turn into a toxic shithead like the rest of them in endgame chat, so sometimes it's easier to leave it off and not worry about losing my cool.
---
And how can you always relay on sight when you can't always simply see them? There are things called walls and mindgaming that red stain. 
---
The Action Speed was helpful yes but it was frusting, boring, and not fun on the survivor point of view. Just having to sit there waiting for a skill check was not fun. 
---
And as i said, the Dream worldf ISNT MEANT TO BE A DEBUFF! Its meant to buff Freddy which it does, quite well. Also, even when out of the chase the lullbay is hard to track
---
they won't have time for that cuz they are being chased or downed and you can always put a next one there for others as it costs you nothing and you can put them through walls
---
Its a fact though? Looking at it from a numbers point of view, how is a 15% slow you can place anywhere at any time without needing to stop moving and can stack in an area that also reveals bad?
---
plague looks like her wig snatched
---
We used to have a rainbow feather duster, this reminds me of it xD
---
She does look little manly in this picture but I like it anyways
---
Wait why is songbird a nerd?
---
I've never know a community to be so toxic. Got called a camper and tunneler because I wouldn't let survivors save their friends right after I hooked them. Not my fault you played dumb. They literally would run towards them before I moved from the area and got mad at me. Then i was trying to trap the hook and got called a camper. Not to mention the toxic flashlights and pre endgame match hostages survivors would pull. Got so bad I disabled my messages on ps4. Bad enough survivors have the power role, but the game punishes killers for playing decent and the devs nerf killers every chance they get.
---
First of all I am in England. Second of all, idgaf if you're a veteran, you've gone from serving your country to whining like a bitch and arguing with 16 year olds on reddit. How pathetic. Lastly, I dont think I'm hard you're just a bitch and you think you can talk down to me.
---
How is seeing someone a mindgame? You still are invisible to some extent. Lol what the fuck?! Are you actually putting a 7 second wait time as a pro? Seriously?! That‚Äôs just wrong on so many levels. You neglected to mention gen teleportation. How coordinated do you think SWF are? People aren‚Äôt reporting every pallet location to the friends. Even if they did it would be really hard to tell them exactly what pallet was fake.
---
Or..another survivor who sees you place it can get rid of it or they can do it after the cahse is over. 
---
The same thing with the snares apply. They cost you nothing to place.
---
XD
---
Yeah I'm using a different app where the canvas is a smaller window, it gives better quality.  I didn't really know what i had in mind tbh.
---
Breaker would need some change to its speed (i know 150% is the norm for speed perks but this directly after a stun will extend a chase alot)
---
Justice is interesting, but will cause killers to run more slug builds so lets not do that
---
Love the rest though!
---
she¬¥s serving as usual
---
I think the pallet power should be his primary power. With a few tweaks for balance.
---
range of putting snares? right in front of you
---
range of putting pallets? 16m
---
&gt;nope only 3 smaller and slower female killers are allowed special ways to break pallets that doesnt includ their feet
---
what does that have to do with anything?
---
That's guy's a little pussy who had to call him his friend so the two of them could cup each other's balls. Don't waste another second giving a fuck what they think.
---
It‚Äôs more Freddy than what we had before.
---
Good! Keep it that way, I need adept achievements!
---
This game is going great so far there are only 5 g‚Äî
---
I think itd be cool to have a mystical nurse. Glitter can fly from her body when she blinks.
---
So there‚Äôs no way to know what days they will stream or not stream until they update that? That‚Äôs a shame.
---
YES I NEED THIS!! Isntead of a whale you hear sparkle noises
---
You can acually place a snare on the other side of a loop.
---
Look if you find snares good that cool I won‚Äôt stop you, but others just don‚Äôt find it as good as dream pallets
---
Si
---
There is nearly no difference between facing a Wraith VS facing a Freddy as a Survivor.  
---
Wraith shows up and you have a few second buffer until he uncloaks and the chase begins. Freddy finds you, sleeps you, and you now have a 7 second or less buffer to get to the nearest pallet. Survivors *not* being chased by Freddy are ***entirely*** ***unaffected***. If Freddy happens to find more than one survivor or you cross a chased survivor's path then Freddy *may* swap to you, or he *may* put you to sleep. Either way that is a matter of walking to the nearest gen, blowing it up, and bam, you're fine. Then you play the game like you would with *literally* any other killer.  
---
Complaining that facing a Freddy "isn't fun" is just silly because he is functionally, no different from Wraith.  
---
But if we're here to discuss fun then do explain the fun parts about a good Nurse, Huntress, or Spirit.  
---
Also, saying Freddy "barely even had a playstyle before" is just wrong and biased. Freddy *doesn't* have a playstyle now. He 1000% did before, but that shit is gone. He is literally nothing more than a Pallet God M1 killer. He makes fake pallets. That's his entire playstyle. There is no more "sleep people as you pass them to slow the game" or anything like that. There is *solely* "Fake Pallet, loop, win". Which itself is *extremely* situational.  
---
You have a SWF? Your power means shit now. The Survivors take note of what pallets exist at the start? Your power means shit now. Did the survivors bring small game? Your power means shit now.
---
Freddy has ***FAR*** more variety in his playstyle now than he ever will with these changes.
---
Haha mate I'm in the UK and it's not just a American problem it's most of the "first world countries" we all need to step up in that case.
---
As for the kid in the other topic just leave him be you will always get keyboard warioirs.
---
Or she does a wahhhh but its very gentle.
---
They know that this skin is wanted by A LOT OF people so they will make it with money 99.99%
---
What is it?
---
I love this community.  In my 2nd or 3rd game I was guided to the hatch when I was the sole survivor (okay, hacked apart and then carried to the hatch).
---
I only have 25ish hours in right now and a recent game I was the last survivor and the killer found me before I could start opening the gates.  He chased me, and my buddy who was in discord with me at the time said, "you gotta ask him if you can escape or you'll never make it."  So I stopped running, and gestured toward the gate.  The killer let me go to the gate open it and escape.  It's so wholesome and so hilarious.
---
It's always so frustrating.
---
A while back Kelsey‚Äôs boyfriend posted a few perks she painted for him in the sub. Started talking to her and she does commissions. So I ordered a few perks! Im going to hang them in my new sun room/game room!  Next up.. killer.. ü§î thanks Kelsey!!!!
---
What do u mean
---
It looks so cute and wholesome.
---
Guys there is a NOT wtf are y‚Äôall complaining about
---
SUCK IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
great.. now my keyboard is sticky
---
Can customizing icons get you in trouble? I was thinking about downloading a pack but if it'll get me in trouble I won't.
---
While this is common in lots of multiplayer, there‚Äôre some good games that tend to have quite the opposite, like Warframe or Elite Dangerous, games where the longer you play, the nicer some people seem. Maybe that‚Äôs just my experience, but it‚Äôs much more pleasant than the situation being discussed here.
---
Just wanted to sprinkle a little positivity into your day. ^~^
---
Because I have a daily limit of conversations with folks with the mentality of a 12 year old.  It does not take long to reach that limit in this game.
---
Not sure, might be fake
---
She a majestic girl
---
It's more like a coin flip now that can save you from losing. It may spawn near you. If it doesn't you gamble searching for a hatch or bet on the killer to find the hatch and search for the exit. That's not something you should rely on for sure.
---
If everyone ran justice then that meant your one perk countered their 4.
---
Well if you see the killer storming for the hatch and you don't know if you'll make it, go for a gate... even if he doesn't kick it closed he will just pluck you out of it anyway!
---
Reading is hard dude. Give them a break.
---
I know she said she was working on a website. So hoping she can link that. I wasn‚Äôt too sure if I was allowed to post too much about it. But seriously I can‚Äôt say enough about her. She did a fantastic job. The picture does no justice. They are amazing
---
That's the exact reason why sight-blockers are so effective for killers in a chase. Survivors cannot judge a chase by the heartbeat of the killer. In a chase it is loud, you have to use your eyes, LoS blockers help killers mindgame and catch up. Lest we also not forget that moonwalking exists.  
---
I agree that as a Survivor playing the waiting game for the skillcheck isn't very engaging gameplay but literally ***every single action*** that Survivors do, aside from pallets and windows is literally waiting for a loading bar to fill up or deplete.
---
Working on a gen? Loading bar.
---
Unhooking a friend? Loading bar.  
---
Healing a friend? Loading bar.  
---
Need to mend? Loading bar.  
---
Need to heal? Loading bar.
---
Opening a chest? Loading bar.
---
Opening a gate? Loading bar.  
---
Breaking a totem? Loading bar.
---
Bleeding out? Loading bar.  
---
Borrowed Time? Loading bar.  
---
Exhausted? Loading bar.  
---
Want to know the extent of Survivor gameplay? The shift key, the W key, and left click. Therefore, I am one to argue that saying "waiting for a skillcheck isn't fun" is flat out not a viable complaint when literally *everything* survivors do in terms of gameplay ***is*** waiting.
---
You know what is "frustrating, boring, and not fun on the \[killer\] point of view"? Literally most gameplay. Looping isn't a fun mechanic. Nor are stuns in general. Neither is being blinded by a flashlight. Or decisive strike. Or Survive With Friends as a general rule. Or old Mettle Of Man.  
---
Killer's face frustrating and unfun gameplay *constantly*. Survivors facing a 50% debuff on *only one Killer, only if they get caught and put to sleep and can be canceled out within 30 seconds of waiting for a skillcheck* is *pretty* damn tame if you ask me.  
---
&gt;And as i said, the Dream worldf ISNT MEANT TO BE A DEBUFF! Its meant to buff Freddy which it does, quite well. Also, even when out of the chase the lullbay is hard to track 
---
That's *your* opinion. A direct buff to a killer is a direct nerf to survivors because they are now stronger. Therefore saying that it isn't a debuff but it's also a buff to Freddy is an oxymoron. You *think* a survivor debuff shouldn't happen. I think it should because otherwise there would be ***literally no point to having the dream world in the first place.***
---
David is a jock prep. His lore was he lived in a rich family if my memory is correct
---
That‚Äôs 100% why they have the different animation.  Neither the Hag or the Spirit would look very convincing kicking a pallet.  Can‚Äôt say about the Plague because she‚Äôs huge, but my guess is it would look weird with her dress.
---
Can people not read? There was a bug where if you hit a trapped survivor and they freed themselves they were not put into the dying state. They have fixed it.
---
Dude, and screw everyone over with a hairy/dirty foot fetish? You‚Äôre a sicko for trying to take that away.
---
Trapper was already struggling to do well in high rank games. Unless you're facing potatoes, 4 gens are either half way finished or done by the time you set up a few traps. The only way I manage to win with trapper is REALLY good traps and snowballing via slugging. Them being stuck in a trap for that additional time really helped him snowball and was a great tool in his kit, even if it was a bug. Trapper really needs anything he can get as he really struggles since his high risk game play can outweigh his rewards. Please don't nerf my precious Trappy boi
---
the fact that pallets are more "limited" to where they are put makes it easier to get them where you want easily and them having a bigger range only makes easier
---
Run along the wall with your camera slightly tilted towards the wall. Your character will lean into the wall if you're doing to right.
---
That's a Grey area.  Practically speaking, no, it won't, and never has.  Per BHVR though: if eac DOES decide to trigger on them, they won't unban you.  Certain streamers have been using them for like, years, with no consequence.
---
The thing is that it's not survivor A makes mistake and gets punished, it's survivor A makes a mistake and survivor B is prevented from being able to play.
---
Further, everyone already agrees that survivor A in that situation sucks. I don't think that removes the responsibility from the killer to see that happen and decide to *also* act shitty. We are capable of making choices, and if we choose to act shitty then we've acted shitty, even if someone else enabled it first.
---
Ive learned so much, all I knew before this was blendette followed by scream die
---
why does the weakest perk have the strongest con? The chest one is byfar the worst one and it only works once
---
Well done
---
I wish we could just select colours separately. Like the customization was just the model and that each customization allowed for 12 colour variants. I know BHVR make most of the colour models available for more money but is that really needed? And they're usually just different shades of the same colour tbh...
---
So..its fine that the 'loading bar' just suddenly moves 50% slower for doing littrely nothing and having no real way to counter it yourself? 
---
There is plenty of reason to have the Dream world: It lets him have debuff addons (Which he does) Give some counter play to his traps/pallets, adds some built in stall/stealth for Freddy, makes his map pressure have a stupidly low cooldown without it being overpowered. 
---
You clearly haven't played vs him or as him if you didnt understand how much of a differnce it makes to Freddies power.
---
Same. I'm a huge fan of Saw. Kind of a shame the series just devolved into torture porn...
---
Right! Great price too!
---
Or 4k with the right build and the right amount of brains
---
These all actually seem reasonable, good job.  The hook one will make me want to die as killer though lmao.
---
Bruh, you're really not getting this whole "Opinion vs Fact" thing...
---
You THINK that snares are good.
---
Other people THINK that pallets are good.
---
I don't know how you don't see your statement is an opinion by definition.
---
Protip, don't wait near the gate stand farther away, don't give away where is 2 of you near the door.
---
Befor they would stay in the trap and when they freed themselves, then they'd be slugged. Now they just flop off the trap when you hit them
---
It's negatively impacting your teammates in ways you don't easily see though
---
For one, any combination of Spint burst/ Self care/ Urban evasion is met with a groan by teammates who know what they're doing. That sort of hiding and being nervous around killer/ doing objectives is a huge leg up for the killer.
---
Beelining between objectives, like gens and saving people off hooks, is necessary for a lot of the high rank loadouts people run. (Adrenaline &gt; Self Care mainly)
---
People depend on you to either be 100% stuck on a gen, making saves while killer is occupied, or running efficient chases.
---
When you hide or preserve sprint burst you're just giving the killer leeway. Every now and again you'll get a situation where a killer spends too long pointlessly looking for you, but that stops happening with good killers who can just hear you or simply not bother to deal with immersed survivors until you're the last one left to lay pressure on.
---
But to effectively hide from even the best, you have to prepare for it and make some distance between gens and yourself. This is why hiding is just considered an all around bad play- it takes too long and the pay off isn't worth it when you could've used that health state more wisely during a chase to guarantee about ~20 seconds of the killer's attention at bare minimum.
---
Yep, same.
---
There are only 4 killers here. Do you have a link to the rest?
---
Indeed I did.
---
I nearly thought I was the dumb one who didn‚Äôt understand lol
---
She didn‚Äôt. The sword is just glass from the window the was thrown through.
---
EAC pushed a fucked update, banning tons of people. So you're likely innocent, though EAC is notorious for not unbanning.
---
i'd like to hear about that season
---
I'm stating facts as to why the snares aren't as bad as people think.
---
Yes exactly. They wouldn't go down. They'd stay in the trap till they freed themselves then they'd be slugged. Did you not read?
---
&gt;How is seeing someone a mindgame?
---
You know where they are. If they get picked up, now you know where two survivors running loose are. It's a risk vs reward scenario.  
---
You are *literally* only invisible when outside of Freddy's terror radius. If they can hear you, they can see you.  
---
Yes. I enjoy the 7 second wait. It is unique gameplay and it's fun to me.  
---
Gen teleportation is on an incredibly long cooldown, and takes a very long time to actually occur. Without whispers it's basically pointless as a method to find survivors because they can easily hide from you.  
---
SWF groups are not stupid but because you cannot see the ***extremely*** obvious answer. Here, allow me to display it for you:  
---
**"Hey guys, I dropped shack pallet on Freddy, if you see it then he made a fake one."**  
---
Congrats. Your power is now useless. No one will drop that fake pallet and you will not get the free hit. Saying it would be hard to tell them the exact pallet is ridiculous.
---
spirit would win a killer beauty contest, but use BBQ and nurse vision
---
And you cant do that with the traps? You can littrely place snares while moving at full speed without stopping.
---
[The Scene if anyone wants to watch it (NSFW)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LZfv0tLZKE)
---
Put some respect on Maurice's name
---
I've been in games where I'm mid jump animation and the hatch is closed by the killer and then I'm fucked
---
Bear*
---
nice. a bigger head and smaller belly perhaps for realistic proportions
---
Idk why but he looks...
---
Fat
---
That‚Äôs how the game is played tho? The survivors pick perks that will help them, the killer chooses perks that will negatively effect the survivors.
---
This game is all about planning, if it‚Äôs known a lot of survivors use these abilities you adapt. 
---
Examples we already have:
---
NOED kinda blocks adrenaline.
---
Iron Maiden helps against head on.
---
The pigs perk that effects sabotage(don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs name) massively blocks jakes Saboteur perk.
---
But you don‚Äôt have to run anything to block ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù if you don‚Äôt want to, it would only work once for that survivor and you can just slug him.
---
thanks bro
---
Its a 3 month old post how did you get there ?
---
you have to be more precise with the snares and if they touch the wall slightly they might end up nowhere close to where you wanted it to go
---
What? No that‚Äôs not what they meant. They mean that after you‚Äôve hit en they wouldn‚Äôt go into the dying state, that‚Äôs due to a bug that has been fixed. Now you can do it again without worrying of they being slugged or not. It‚Äôs not a nerf
---
You would use your time moving around the map to reach said gens and totems, while *also* noting pallets...you know, using your time wisely.  Hell, just learn 2 or 3 near your chosen gen and take your chances if you don't wanna scout.  Just don't bitch 'whaaa freddy too strong' if you aren't willing to adapt.
---
Finally, if despite this Freddy tricks you with his power because someone used a pallet, then that means *his power is working as intended*.  Freddy is built on misdirection and trickery, and you can defuse the fakes by noting which ones show up when you fall asleep and throwing them down.  
---
Freddy is good where he is, and will get weaker as people actually learn to play against him...maybe slight tweaks but he doesn't need a nerf.  People just need to actually respect Freddy and his kit now.
---
How about every other pallet. Here let me say one. The pallet behind the garage is fake. Which one. The one to the far left. My left your left? Your lef- I‚Äôm down.

The preschool isn't a map itself. It's actually a set of props assembled together to make the full thing. [Here's the first part](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1794479075) and [the second](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1794482834).
---
The actual map I used is [Really BIG TOTALLY Black Void](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=428111383).
---
Maybe if enough survivors get punished this way they'll learn that you don't save that way? But do they? No, no they don't!
---
\- Look, I can forgive this after a rank reset and your thrown back into the barrel of higher ranks, once you get to green/purple/red ranks I have no compassion for your shitty teammates... they should know better! I'm a killer not a carebear...
---
I havent seen that happen

---
Key word there is "IF". The killer has less resources than the survivors collectively, so they shouldn't have to make a build designed to counter a potential survivor perk option, it should be the other way around. Survivors have to pick speculative perks to counter the killer's.
---
have you played the new freddy?
---
That was a part of him for a while. I always thought it was intended. If anything, I thought people getting free when I hit them was the bug
---
Cool, keep drinking the breast milk from another species, you have every right. But milk is for babies :P
---
Pretty good perk ideas actually. I'm iffy about Justice, I think that would be difficult to implement, and maybe too strong for premades. Breaker is essentially just Lithe but you risk the chance of getting hit through the pallet so I don't think it is too strong. Would be strong to extend chases or counter Spirit Fury, but not OP.
---
Me: Haha its a cowboy  
---
Billy: Youve yeed your last haw. *chainsaws into wall*
---
Can you not get a hook without agitation?
---
70. Game was kinda twitchy on default (I had 60hz non-g-sync monitor), so I've tried to make it look smoother. Now with g-sync monitor I think I could go back to default, but I'm just lazy, and don't need 100+ fps in this particular game, so it stays on 70

Snares &gt; Pallets
---
Missing the point, mate
---
Yeah...great price!!!
---
Cause that‚Äôs...the bug? I can‚Äôt understand if you‚Äôre being serious to be honest
---
That's not Freddy's thing.
---
That's Doctor's thing.
---
I‚Äôm not afraid of getting laughed at, it‚Äôs okay, as long I get the gamerscore. Also, playing killer and getting 4Ks a lot is just asking for hate mail so I‚Äôm used to it!
---
Insta heals are fine...I'm guessing you mostly play survivor
---
Dear god no, it used to take 8 years for Trapper to set one trap.
---
U said she cann't shorten chases. What about ambush at medium loops? That's a tool. And at long walls her crouch helps her with the missing red stain and terror radius, buddy.
---
Yes. A couple times. Que times are too long for me to play, but ive watched Steamers. I have not once seen that happen
---
Well, I dont think milk will kill you, lol, but if you have bad lactose intolerance you may wish it did.
---
It's the PLAAAAGGG my dudes!
---
Yeah, it can only happen once.
---
I wish we could add the bloody prestige to any of our desired cosmetics instead of just having the boring basic outfit that generally looks like shit.
---
Holy shit dude, read a book.
---
I'd say if she's using the insta down red addon, she can probably compete even with the nurse. But with weak addons, she's mid tier.
---
I would love to see just one huge overhead swing and smash the pallet
---
Thanks! I like your flair. Playing as legion, I‚Äôm amazed how easy it is to find everyone. No wonder I‚Äôm scared of legion when I play survivor.
---
Freddy was bad. His base kit was terrible. A killer shouldn't need addons to get kills. End of discussion.
---
Bubba and Hillbilly can already use their chainsaw on it though and it is actually faster than the normal pallet break, but sacrifices bloodlust.
---
Same when I saw this üòÇ
---
No, those are masochists.
---
I haven't seen a single one
---
I played against a 4 man swf as ghostface. We spent like 5 min teabagging at each other in the middle of the map lmao. Fun match
---
well it happend to me a lot. I wanted to put a trap near the loop, it ended up on the other side. wanted to put the trap where i was standing, but i had to move to the side. wanted to put the trap upstairs? welp have to go upstairs for that.
---
with pallets you can simply look there, hold rightclick, there.
---
Those axes are not for chopping wood. They are for chopping people. Use the right tools for the right job.
---
Oh shit, would disabling Vsync or removing your FPS cap also trigger a ban?
---
F A K E G A M E
---
If her mori was redesigned into her chopping the survivors limbs off(like one leg and one arm or whatever) and chopping they're heads off that would be worth seeingüòÇüëå (but shes cool anyway)
---
They keep adding shit to outdoor maps to block hatchets and indoor maps make her low-tier, so yeah, I agree.
---
I mean...A dream is a dream. You cant know whats real or fake during Freddies Dreams.  
---
If you see a giant ass pool of blood have hands creep up and grab you, wouldn't you scream? That would be horryfing. 
---
The Dream Pallets is an odd one i will agree on. 
---
The Dream Pojection fits Freddy fine. 
---
The Doctor's madness should be more about hallusions and illusions, not evioermental changes. The Dream world is a different plakce so it makes sense it changes it around.
---
You have to break that hook when someone else is being carried.
---
Then next time YOU are downed, 2 hooks break.
---
If you mean, Lets say someone steps in a trap, I hit them, they free themselves and they're just in injured state, not downed. Is that what you mean? Do you mean when I hit them they immediately get freed from my trap in dying state? Or when I hit them they just stay in my trap?  
---
It's always been a thing for survivors to be stuck in the trap till they free themselves, then they go into the dying state, assuming you hit them.
---
I never had it so maybe im lucky.
---
Holy shit don't be a dick because you disagree with me.
---
Pretty cool. What buffs do you think they could get from the doll? Also, it would be cool to have a add on that gave warning when someone started messing with the dolls
---
Not really sure. But hey it's there and I made a comment so . Oh well.  Nothing is ever old on the net, someone is always discovering something new to THEM. Perhaps block the thread? Idk
---
What's SFM?
---
No..not really. Freddy in the movies does fuck with people's minds plenty. Doctor also does it. It fits them both.
---
Yeah? Didn‚Äôt you mean that after you hit em they‚Äôll just be injured and free out of the trap? That was the big right?
---
I am. It's been like that for as long as I remember. No one has EVER called that a bug.
---
To be honest I don't view this as a dick thing since survivors get blood points for u closing hatch.
---
Are you trolling or are you actually this stupid?
---
I DON'T WANT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE FREDDY REWORK BC I KNOW BHVR IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO GIVE PPL WHAT THEY WANT AND ALL, AND I AM ACTUALLY P EXCITED TO PLAY AGAINST THIS NEW FREDDY, BUT AS A KILLER I LOVE FREDDY AS HE IS, I HAVE SO MUCH FUN PLAYING AS HIM, AND I THINK IT'S REALLY UNFAIR THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE AWAY A WHOLE ASS KILLER STYLE/ABILITY/WHAT HAVE YOU, /ESPECIALLY/ ONE THAT I PAID TO PLAY.
---
im hoping to get consistent with her.  right now people wanna play around with me when im the nurse because they can very obviously tell that i'm awful.  but it does lead to some good practice.  
---
i was messing with this dude at a loop fro a solid 3 or 4 mins yesterday.  just kept trying to get the blink down, eventually i downed him.   by that point his boys got like 3 gens done.  but hey i gotta get better with her somehow.  i got the distance down just need to get much better at loops.
---
All of the licensed killers (Micheal Myers, Freddy Kreuger, Ghostface, etc) have to be bought with money. Either by buying the DLC they come in or buying them with AC.
---
Quick note about the lunges for the killers:
---
If you want to lung at a pallet, don't make a long lunge. Don't hold M1 while starting the lunge from a long distance.
---
Instead close the distance and tap m1 instead while still holding W. The momentum will still push you forward to get a hit, and by waiting to close the distance you can see if the survivor is faking the pallet drop and continues looping, at which point you just don't swing and catch up to them instead.
---
You put on an offering that spawns you in as Freddy. They have them for a few killers.
---
Never seen saw. Read his in game lore. Read the perk description. Immediately understood.
---
I felt so dissapointed the first time i saw Trapper's mori, i was expecting him to do something with his traps...
---
yes. I agree 100% on that.
---
You used a offering that lets you play as licensed killers
---
He's great fun and really good at  ranks 7-20. But once people know his counter of staying apart, hitting with pallets, and 360ing to make him miss. It takes him too long to finish a chase.
---
He used an offering to play as Freddy and once the match is over, DBD "equips" Trapper for when you go back to the menu instead of showing the killer you burned the offering with.
---
Hasn‚Äôt this been around for awhile too? Like I‚Äôve heard of people losing legacy and the devs not giving a shit
---
*WHHHATTTTT THE F-F-F-FUCK-K-K??????*
---
Yup.... I really wish we could get them to at least acknowledge the issue
---
Lmaoooo just noticed
---
probably takes over a month to get enough for just a single unlicensed killer, twice as long if you want the survivor that goes with them
---
Haven't seen anyone say she was since december 2017
---
I normally let people live but if someone is still watching after they been killed and are not in a swf they report you and said you were teaming
---
The problem with this is that a vast majority of the playerbase all agreed freddy wasn‚Äôt good or viable because of his kit. He was hated upon release. (I don‚Äôt agree with this mindset, I thought he was good but you had to play him differently than other killers, but that‚Äôs a different discussion). The developer‚Äôs job is to fix the game and any issues it has. This includes balance issues. People refused to play freddy because of his kit, and they demanded a rework, so the devs listened. This isn‚Äôt a new thing. Overwatch did it with Mercy (her ultimate used to be Reurrect, allowing her to revive any dead teammates within a certain radius at once- now, she has a new ultimate, allowing her free flying and higher healing ability, and she can now res 1 person every 30 seconds). My point is if the majority of the playerbase actually hates something about the game, it is the devs jobs to fix it, and that‚Äôs what they did with freddy. Do you not even realize how much hate this killer got because of how they designed him? He was consistently ranked in the lowest tier, never used in red rank gameplay (with the rare freddy main exception, but these are few and far between). Comparing this to food is a nonargument; theyre completely different subjects with different values. Comparing your Wendy‚Äôs meal (a meal specific for you only) to a character in a video game (available to the whole playerbase who purchases it in this instance) are not equal statements.
---
not all the characters i play being at the bottom we-
---
Just use cool down add ons and slap on franklins noed discordance sloppy and you clap them (sometimes)
---
Makes sense now thank you guys. I was just throwing up offerings I don‚Äôt use so yes I am that stupid not to read it. Only been playing the game for about 2 weeks now
---
it's sad that they removed my favourite killer from the game. what hurts the most is that they're releasing a new killer with the same name and model as my favourite one ) :
---
The people playing this game are honestly disgusting.  
---
Never seen a game have this bad of a community.
---
I'm a console nurse and the best tips I can give are to avoid campbells plaid as you begin to rely on it, and avoid multiblinks. Use first blink for distance and second for accuracy. Also, to avoid people cutting back when you go to blink, cut the teleport short, and they'll turn into you
---
Ugh ikr. 2 sexy 4 me
---
Generally speaking, if you engage someone else in a chase and win, there's now an unfinished gen they were working on they can't simply go back to and top off, and the other guy spent some time healing
---
When you tunnel, everyone else in the match gets an M1 simulator on gens. Hence why the general levels of toxicity rise when a killer is seen evidently tunnelling; they want you to actually start playing the game instead of focusing on one survivor for no reason.
---
Try it; instead of going for the injured survivor chase the guy who unhooked, or just slug the injured and chase the healthy. Magically more pressure is applied on everyone.
---
Cause the survivor cant move or recover till they free themselves from the trap. It added pressure, Immobilized the survivor so you know where they are, makes saving harder and take longer. It was one of the few good things Trapper had.
---
And that leather face has ‚ÄúFranklins demise‚Äù to make you drop a weapon. 
---
In the first movie when leather face kills Franklin he drops a flashlight.
---
My opinion on video games cant be wrong. Let me specify because some redditors find it hard to use the rock in their skull and reach for everything just to find a desperate point. :/
---
Huntress came with David King, also yes, of course it happened. She can uproot them with her bare hands as well
---
If a killer needs NOED in his build to "clap" them sometimes, he's not the greatest killer. However, he is great fun to play as.
---
If they are waiting for you to finish the gate then that means they could've already done so without the perk.
---
They would've opened the gate, ran up to the finish line and then do all the things you've said they would. There is literally no difference.
---
Also you can just... hit them without waiting out the timer?
---
Ayyy. üëèüèº
---
But for real. Just lemme know Dwight.
---
&gt;They keep adding shit to outdoor maps to block hatchets and indoor maps make her low-tier, so yeah, I agree.
---
They literally just added some props on top of red trucks present on Preschool so you can't throw over their truck bed.
---
I mean it‚Äôs not that important after all, you can just leave em there and keep going after someone else

Lol as soon as i saw pulse rifle, i was like the fuck did freddy get a rifle in his fucking rework.
---
Yeah he is fun and annoying but i mostly get 4ks even when there is no noed
---
Appreciate any advice I can get :)
---
He was the weakest killer, his power was very negligible to anyone who knew how to play. Acting like an addon magically took away his biggest flaw is just stupid. Waiting ANY amount of time to interact with survivors was a terrible idea and made him easily the weakest killer in the game.
---
I reallt don't understand why people try to pretend that he was actually good. He wasn't, especially in high ranks. But please keep trying to defend him by saying "but addons make him good." If that's your only argument then why bothee defending him in the first place? His power was trash, and needed to be reworked.
---
Thank you, I will :p
---
I copied your exact post except for survivors and now its an ‚Äúunhinged rant‚Äù. These reddit killers never fail to impress me. Never seen such a community for a game so ignorant and delusional.
---
Source Filmmaker. It's an animation made by Valve (Half Life, TF2, Portal, ect.) they used for their cinematic trailers. You can download it for free on Steam and it has workshop support so you can download DBD models for use in the program.
---
I'd say that it giving him pretty much the best map control ability in the game is an objectively better part of his kit
---
I have one and he‚Äôs honestly just like an chubby dog.
---
well with that list youve juts showed me then yea shes high tier. i resent  what i said earlier
---
Because of map pressure. If you focus on killing people one dude at a time and not dishing out altruistic objectives (making them want to heal, slugging, hooking in different areas of the map pulling them away from gens) you're gonna get genrushed.
---
On top of not being fun for the dude being tunnelled, it's not fun for everyone else either. They don't get to engage in chases, just M1 gens all match, and leave with barely any points and a possible depip because the killer put all their attention on one person.
---
You need to consider that when people go to save they're often ditching a gen that had progress on it, and if you go chase the injured survivor again, the rescuer will just go back and top that gen off. They know its location and progress, EZ gen.
---
But when you swap targets, you now have 2 survivors worrying about taking the pressure off themselves, and the guy who was on hook usually doesn't go in for the next hook. (They've already been hooked once, it's someone else's turn!)
---
Which means they're likely to have not found that gen with progress, and just started a new gen.
---
Tunnelling unintuitively shoots yourself in the foot. You also get way more points and lay in more pressure/ get to "play the game" more when you don't tunnel injured survivors.
---
Maybe their not making excuses? lmfao have you ever considered they were lagging even if you're not? Not only that it'd be really hard for you to see the lag because the game is hosted by you. Hence why you have priority over everyone else in the server...unless you didnt know that ;0

Buy the biggest and loudest survivor in the entire game you won't regret it
---
Extra lot gun
---
True, but I don't think we're getting anywhere here. Have a good day, lad.
---
For every strength she has, she has a weakness to compensate. You cannot say that about any other killer. Any killer better than her has too many strengths and any killer beneath her has too many weaknesses.
---
not in the slightest
---
Congrats, man!
---
Do you think it's my internet I can try to do a couple things to fix it
---
If the scatman can stutter [so can you](https://youtu.be/Hy8kmNEo1i8)
---
How can anyone play DbD without levelling Meg
---
Boggles my mind how killers have mori dailies, that you can cheese with rancor. Even so, if you have a mori, it isn't exactly challenging.  
---
60k points.  
---
Survive and escape with survivor: 25/30k.  
---
And killers already get way more points to begin with.
---
It's quite significant. A save taking a few more seconds longer can make a huge difference in a game where every second for a killer counts, especially with a killer like Trapper. A save possibly taking 5-10 more seconds is very huge.
---
If you're referring to gen teleport then I'm forced to disagree. It has a massive cooldown, its disorienting, it takes forever to actually teleport, and when you get there, there isn't even a guarantee that gen had been worked on or that a survivor is even there. Heck, you can start the teleport and a survivor can waltz behind cover and you'd never know without whispers; even then it's more beneficial to gen patrol than it is to search every nook and cranny for a survivor that might already be running away from you.
---
Some weird homemade slime stuff with balls in. Curiosity of my sister and a friend

You literally took my post and replaced every part of it with a strawmen and are now getting upset at the strawman you created. Have fun complaining about things I never said and telling yourself it's an equivalent argument.
---
Not rly. For every strength she has. She has a weakness to even it out. That's not true for any other killer. They're all either too strong (Nurse. Billy) or too weak (everyone else).
---
Excuse me # NotAllP3Clauds
---
As the legion: Figure out what exactly is wrong the the North American Economy

I dont have enough fuming mixtapes to even begin that
---
Sorry if I'm stupid but who's Mandy?
---
That joke went straight over your head didn‚Äôt it?
---
I'm not sure if you know, but the killer gets freed when he grabs a survivor
---
Just change it to pallet stun like Enduring, boom now its perfectly balanced
---
Casual player here...why is it bad to cleanse against Plague? If you don't cleanse, she can 1 hit down you, right? I asked this question to someone else last week, and got an answer that didn't answer my question at all! Thanks!
---
Thanataphobia may be one of the worst perk you could pick on ghostface because he revolves around instadowning single people and has no toola to get or keep multiple survivors injured at once
---
He can't ven capitalize off AOE stalks, he's not going to be rocking thana
---
What does BHVR mean?
---
He can't interrupt a hatch escape. That was removed with EGC.
---
Except that gold dress outfit, that was fugly
---
But if I dont leave, I get called out for tunneling?
---
One health state is far better than her corrupt purge, picture huntress except it‚Äôs a stream
---
of hatchets that lasts a couple seconds each time. I‚Äôd much perfer having bootleg no mither against a m1 instead of her ranged attack
---
See that at least makes sense as you can control them both more effectively than sprint burst.   Granted there is the sprint burst exploit you can use. But I don‚Äôt know how many people know about it. 
---
(For those who want to know.  If you hold crouch. And then hold run.  And let go of crouch. You‚Äôll run without activating sprint burst. But when you do want use it. You have to let go and re hold run again)
---
Nowhere near dead. Especially considering F13 is still alive on PS4 haha. Just wait for dedicated servers
---
You can have the opportunity to play the plague by being lucky enough to unlock a glass shard offering. 
---
In killer bloodwebs there is an ultra rare offerings called shards. These shards can allow you to play killers that you do not own yet with no perks or add-ons. 
---
For the pig, you need to get the glass shard. Using this shard will consume it and allow you to play the pig in the trial you burned the offering in. 
---
To actually own the pig you will need to purchase using real money due to her being licensed. There should be a sale at one point which will reduce the cost of the Jigsaw DLC. Otherwise if you want the pig alone then spending $5 on auric cells to purchase her is the only way to go.
---
Kinda ironic because if it‚Äôs your first time you can‚Äôt have all perks on you
---
Thanataphobia is awul. People run it becaue its fun and they really want to use it so they may as well use it on legion becaus they can stack it effetively. It's still ineffective on legion because it's just ineffective period.
---
Me

Salt? No,sorry for that you propably misunderstod me bcs of my english it is not my motherlanguage.Im trying to write as good as i can.I thought that i anger you in some way so i tried to say ,,calm down it was just for laugh,,.
---
How dare you insult my god
---
That link doesn't seem to work.
---
The endgame timer is an excellent touch
---
i takes definitely some time. but it all depends on where your priorities lie. i for one prefer buying cosmetics with shards. if you dont care for style you should buy characters.
---
It probably doesn't hurt your rank that much if at all. Win or lose you get more points when you are on the move, kicking gens, chasing, injuring survivors, and using your power. All of that goes further for pipping than securing a kill and letting survivors escape.
---
Light. i got bbq and chili in my first web. but on my p3 billy lvl50 still havent gotten bbq at all :)

---
What‚Äôs it called? I can‚Äôt find it
---
OH WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING i thought you were saying smtn different
---
honestly just buy them with real money. it would take way too long to grind for them and besides, you can use the shards to buy teachable perks of survivors/killer you dont own/ddont want to buy
---
With that logic, anybody who uses pink addons goes to hell. Or is it just survivors? You sound completely one sided buddy.
---
yea in the booger and piss ranks maybe
---
If one of the other survivors actually recorded the match and Claudette helping the killer find them they will get banned as it counts as teaming which is against the rules.
---
why
---
It takes a while to get the shards for a character and I like using them for the shrine or cosmetics. I would pick one or two characters grind for and then wait for a sale and buy the packs. I think you just missed a sale if its not still going on.
---
No fucking wonder my dead hard has been fucking up. I assumed it was just ping since I have bad wifi at the moment, but NOPE. It's BHVR doing what they do best...
---
I dont understand what you're saying
---
No need to diss the devs.
---
I mean at worst that's a healthstate- you kind of want teammates beelining between objectives and not hiding around waiting for a safe moment to unhook
---
&gt;Freddy then makes the game last 2 hours with the slow down and tracking making it immposbile to do anything while still being easy to loop.
---
It's like you didn't read past my first sentence.  
---
*"Survivors* *not* *being chased by Freddy are* ***entirely*** ***unaffected****. If Freddy happens to find more than one survivor or you cross a chased survivor's path then Freddy* *may* *swap to you, or he* *may* *put you to sleep. Either way that is a matter of walking to the nearest gen, blowing it up, and bam, you're fine. Then you play the game like you would with* *literally* *any other killer. "*
---
&gt; Freddy does have a playstyle. Able to control the map. 
---
Okay, since we're breaking it down to the literal most bare-bones elements I'll play that game too.  
---
What playstyle is there to finding an empty pallet, M2, then chase and M1? If you break that shit down, then again you have no case.  
---
Freddy now has less to his kit than he ever did before. Pre-change he had stealth, the ability to slow gen progress, mindgame potential, etc. Now the only mindgame he can do is "Is the pallet real or not? Spin the 50-50 wheel and find out" which itself *is not mindgame at all.*
---
&gt;I've already seen like 5 or 6 different builds alone for new Freedy. Late Game, Early Game, Gen Control, Chaser, Slowing the Game down, Tracking.
---
Oh look. Almost like you can do the ***exact same thing with literally any killer, especially current-day Freddy.***  
---
Your logic here is "Oh well he can make builds". Everyone can make a build. You can make a late-game build Freddy, early Freddy, gen Freddy, etc. All with current day Freddy.  
---
This argument is invalid.
---
Pre-work Freddy is far more varied than rework Freddy. There is literally nothing varied about "Plop down fake pallet, loop until you inevitably win because they'll drop the fake pallet on you."  
---
Doctor has passive bonuses. That's his entire thing. He sp00ks Survivors and gets them to have fucked up skillchecks and the likes. Plague also has passives. Myer's power is literally an active power. If it was a passive power then you'd be stalking the entire game no matter what and constantly going through a cycle of Tier 1 to 2 to 3 to 2 to 3... etc. Myers has a lot of strategies he can use *because* he's an active power killer. It's ridiculous that you can incorrectly say he uses a passive power. The only "passive" powers he get is movement and vault speed and those are fundamental mechanics, not passives.
---
I think it just depends on your situation. Heck by the time you're grinding for the shards you might not even like the person or side you're playing. I suggest not buying anything extra until you get a couple hours in on both survivor and killer. If money isn't an issue just buy who you think is cool. Also the game is perfectly enjoyable without any extra add ons.
---
Pig
---
I don‚Äôt play immersed so I don‚Äôt care -_-
---
I think the next killer may be somehow connected to pirates or sea at least, looking at the leaked cosmetics
---
I bought the halloween edition of DBD in the steam sale with like 12 minutes of the sale to go haha, but alright thanks, i might just grind a bit and wait until the steam winter sale to start dropping cash.
---
Someone doesn't know how to cleanse totems it sounds like... Poor big brain survivor... Over powered perks getting ya buddy?
---
What fucking cartoon is this? I must know!
---
Who cares, most trappers placed them under hooks and under the geometry so it was invisible anyway :p
---
I do run DS since it's perfect for anti tunnelling, but they are so relentless that even if I kept looping the whole game I'd still only get a depip because I can't partake in any other emblems.
---
Wasn‚Äôt she the first DLC?    I think they‚Äôre keeping it that way so it doesn‚Äôt mess with her hatch closing animation if anything.
---
Hahaha that was pretty clever.
---
You got caught by a killer who is complety invisble and can pull you in from a range. What do you do about that? 
---
The fuck you mean it does nothing? It gives his teleport a massively lower cooldown, makes it harder to track him via the lullbay, gives him stall, and makes the dream ablities work.
---
His weakness was that you literally cannot do what all other killers could and just hit or pull people off of things giving them ample time to unhook, finish a gen, or lead you to a loop. He was bad. No build was going to change that. And again, none of that stuff means anything against a competent survivor. 
---
Not to mention anything about how his end game is absolutely abysmal, even with his perks meant to make him strong during that phase of the game. Exit gates open? Got a survivor on the hook? Have fun with everyone just bum rushing the hook right in your face with no way to counter them for 7 seconds.
---
Hello to everybody on this post. I've been reading a lot of DbD on Reddit recently. I thought everyone might like to know there is a DbD forum you can go to, and plenty of people there that would love to talk about these kinds of things with you. This is the link.
---
 https://forum.deadbydaylight.com
---
BHVR kinda fixed this tho, either you take the swf assfuck or you wait another 20 mins in queue to either get the same swf lobby or a new swf lobby @redranks
---
I was gonna ask the same question man. I‚Äôm having the hardest time finding a game as the killer, which is a little weird.
---
Play as survivor or another killer, get bloodpoints, level legion up to level ten to equip all three legion perks. Play a game.
---
I'd replace farming with crouching all the way up. Then when they realize they have to run before you go into second state they have Sprint Burst but they don't make before you go into second state.
---
I really hate those types that play with Sprint Burst and Urban Evasion that way.
---
Ok. Then I guess freddy needs a power that lets him molest children.
---
One day, Balanced Landing.
---
It is complicated. Ghostface's power is absolute shit and getting one exposed down as rank 1 is hard enough.
---
idk if hag is actually that good (i‚Äôm a rank 5 killer and 8 survivor) but she‚Äôs honestly the most unfun killer to fight when you don‚Äôt have a flashlight or urban evasion
---
That would be cool
---
Right?? 
---
Can we get one of the paper mache ones from Saw 8 when John decided what his divination would be represented by?!
---
Huntress was the 5th DLC. First was nurse, then Michael, Hag, and Doctor
---
Thanks for the explanation!
---
Dream pallets are fun but won't do much against good survivors.
---
With dreamsnares I just rather play hag.
---
I liked stalling and mindgaming people more than placing traps and hope that the survivors are bad.
---
Enlighten me then.
---
No problem, knowing how to counter is half the battle
---
Favorite is Myers, least favorite is Trapper.
---
&gt;Overwatch did it with Mercy
---
Bad example. She kept her powers but with a slight rework. Unlike Freddy.  
---
An appropriate comparison would be to say "Imagine if Mercy got reworked to become a new tank". It's something completely different and her original power is completely scrapped.  
---
&gt; Comparing this to food is a nonargument; 
---
I did ***specifically*** say ***ANALOGY*** did I not.  
---
Do look up the definition, please.
---
It‚Äôs Behaviour‚Äôs (the devs) shorthand name.
---
I wanna get the black and red hooded robe John wore in Saw 1
---
The majesticiest.
---
Just a little bit
---
Don't ya mean... Groovy?
---
That‚Äôs why I can never find her!
---
Umbra &amp; Ralph are both insanely good as Huntress. Very talented. But honestly they are so good that it‚Äôs not fun playing against them.
---
P3 Claudettes;
---
Quick and Quiet
---
Urban Evasion
---
Spine Chill/Premonition 
---
Calm spirit/Iron Will
---
And don‚Äôt forget the outfit
---
I prefer snares. I play Clown a lot and a speed reduction that lasts longer than Clowns and forces medium vaults is really strong.
---
I really want pig reworked now to have a shit ton of bear traps and no hooks on the map now.
---
It sounds hilarious.
---
I‚Äôm not one sided bro but if survivors can be toxic with these add-ons and not go to hell then why do killers who camp go to hell they are pretty much the same
---
"Nice" is reserved for 69. Do not disrespect the meme.
---
Super omega majestic mode
---
There are also too many decent/good survivors to make anything non nurse/spirit just fking painful to play at red ranks :(
---
Very true. Sadly, I've only went against Plague once, and I was one of the ones healing every time I got puked on! I won't be doing that anymore!!!
---
Favorite is Hag least favorite is trapper
---
We All know there are a small percentage of you out here who actually play the game like you are suppose to. But even as a survivor playing solo, if I see 3 identical Claudette‚Äôs in the lobby with similar names I bounce out before the killer even has a chance to. I‚Äôve had a few funny games with them and most of them end horribly because the 3 amigos are fucking around the hole time!
---
Why David? lmao.
---
I mean, it's on the killer coming back to the hook by the time someone ditched a gen to go for the unhook- it usually means they couldn't find someone else or injure someone else
---
Yeah unhooking like 5 seconds after someone is hooked without the killer directing attention to someone completely new, that's sandbagging.
---
But it's also the incorrect move to go and down the unhooked survivor to try and hook them immediately again. You typically wanna go for the guy who unhooked if you don't wanna see gens pop in your face at blitz speed
---
&gt;Freddy still has built in stealth and stall
---
He does not. At all. For the record, "built in" means without add ons. So do kindly explain yourself as to where he has a stealth and stall because, as I have said many times before, *if you can hear the heartbeat. You can see him.*
---
&gt;addons
---
And there it is.
---
Actually, her ultimate ability was completely and totally changed into something new, something very unlike anything she had in her kit before, so, no, it‚Äôs not a bad example. She did keep similar things, just like Freddy will. 
---
And your analogy fails if it‚Äôs something that can‚Äôt be compared in an analogous way. Sorry.
---
Lmao Jeff my bad
---
Myers is that one killer that is fun to play and play against. Trapper is if he's good the game sucks, if he's awful the game's easy.
---
Fav is clown. Least is nurse. I don't like the blink power, it is boring to me.
---
My Dalies:  Hey, remember Spirit?  You know, that killer you‚Äôre no good at and have shit add-ons for?  You know how for half a millisecond after she stops phasing she keeps her phasing speed?  Hit 4 people in that half millisecond window with console framerate.
---
Also my Dailies:  Co-Op actions are broken and barely even register.  Do 3 ~~hours~~ minutes worth of them.
---
Seriously, I get so many Spirit and Hag dailies compared to any other killer it‚Äôs ludicrous.
---
Or maybe they're somewhat new to the game
---
OINK I AGREE
---
It's best to just play with the standard survivors and killers in the beginning, if you enjoy the game and want extra characters just buy some (or all) DLC when it's in sale. Personally i wouldn't waste shards on it, just keep them for the shrine or cosmetics.
---
Because you and others seem to try to make the ***extremely unrealistic and invalid argument*** that you're ***ALWAYS*** asleep.  
---
You are not.  
---
Again.  
---
&gt; Freddy chases ***ONE*** survivor leaving ***THREE*** others unhindered unless you fuck up. 
---
***If you are always asleep, then it is YOU who fucked up and YOU need to get better at facing Freddy. NOT the other way around.***
---
Ah.  It‚Äôs different on console.  That‚Äôs my bad.  
---
Dead by daylight only comes as ‚ÄúThe Special Edition‚Äù
---
It comes with:
---
The Trapper. 
---
The Hillbilly. 
---
The Wraith. 
---
The Nurse. 
---
The Doctor. 
---
And The Hag. 
---
So I guess it was the second DLC for us scrubs then, but it was still free and still fairly early in the game I suppose as a few killers were already there for the Beta.
---
keep in mind that one a day you get a bonus "300 xp" for playing a daily survivor match, and another 300 for playing as a killer. this can help speed up how quickly you earn those shards
---
Yeah, on console the nurse sucks to play as. But the clown other then map pressure he is very good.
---
The mostest for sure.
---
Blood hero is the one i need
---
Well I didnt go into detail because I realistically dont think theyll do it, but also because I feel like the post will get downvoted to oblivion and not get seen anyway, so no point in going into detail lol. But Id say the way it work would is like.
---
For each Doll that exists, the Dollmaker gets a token on its stack. And there can be a total of 6 Dolls placed in the world
---
1-2: Speed buffs
---
3-4: Increased chance of survivors having the Exposed status when hit, so they enter the Dying State from 1 strike
---
5-6: Decrease Terror Radius
---
Add ons would increase the tokens in each stack further, making them faster, stronger (even further increased chance of survivors having Exposed status), and maybe an Add On that gets rid of Dollmakers Red Stain as well lol.
---
As you mentioned, Perks that would alert Dollmaker when a Doll is being tampered with. After all, they are their pride and joy so maybe called it "MINE", or "My Precious", or "DONT TOUCH". Lol. Maybe a Perk that allows the Dollmaker to place a Doll on a single gen and block it from being used. Some proximity Dolls that will alert the Dollmaker if a survivor is within a certain distance of them.
---
That would look spectacular, Behavior wouldn't have to change how long the animation takes either if they add a little time of her drawing back the axe or recovering afterwards.
---
Now I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how they‚Äôve cheated us out of amazing palette animations
---
Very true. I absolutely love playing and going against Myers. Great jump scares!!!!!!!
---
I tried to play the Trapper this morning, just for dailies....I had no clue you could step in your own traps. That was a little disheartening. I'm a terrible killer (decent with Myers,) and got absolutely wrecked this morning! LOL!
---
And if you dont upvote this comment...
---
Then monto will never look into the camera seductively again!
---
You want that on your shoulders?
---
adrenaline
---
ds
---
borrowed
---
dead hard
---
Atleast you're green rank. You can mulch their asses.
---
Hm interesting choices, both are trap based killers. But why don't you like the trapper? I'm just curious as why.
---
Same! But with what kinda mask?
---
"Sometimes"
---
Didn‚Äôt know they did the killers out of order on console. At least you guys are finally getting Bill
---
Update: I have literally just been unbanned...not entirely sure what has happened
---
And what are you supposed to do. You cant just force yourself awake you need skill checks which, mind you, take longer since you have a 50% action speed pently. You cant control when you wake up. 
---
BHVR is doing everyone. Your just salty because your main was changed and refuse to accept he was unfun to face.
---
You have infinite head on and can spam jump in and out of lockers constantly stunning the killer
---
Like 1000 people got accidentally banned today. Tons of streamers were banned also. Several people have been unbanned already. It's obviously an accident.
---
as The Ghostface, on a wednesday evening, lean around the god pallet and stalk 2 survivors, downing 3 within 10 seconds
---
should they make pig dash away so survivors won't hear it coming and make her dash attack along range
---
It‚Äôs not that other killers are allowed to use their ability after use, its Legion that‚Äôs the outlier. In my opinion (and it is an opinion), Legion is (after the Freddy rework) the worst killer in the game, and part of the reason for that is that his ability actively harms him in a chase. Legion‚Äôs stun after his ability is a feature meant to ensure the killer can not capitalize too well on other parts of his power. However, this means that Legion is one of the worst killers. Thus, Legion should not be the basis for what other killers are balanced upon, instead, we should be talking about how Legion is not up to par based upon the other killers.
---
They give you more daylies for the side you don't play as much to get you try it
---
Since you are new I will give you this advice, only level 1 survivor to P3 status that you will be mostly using as your main survivor. This will give you the trophy achievement and save you a ton of blood points because it‚Äôs not worth spending the extra BP leveling all your other survivors to P3 status. You get the same shit in your blood webs at P3 or before you prestige and this game is to much of a grind vest. 
---
GOOD LUCK and we will see you in the fog!
---
i feel like a better comparison is nurse having less stun after blink rather than comparing it to freddy teleport (that survivors can see)
---
Interesting, haven't seen that one before.
---
I love that Ghostface idea, like he gently returns it to the starting position and the entity appears behind it to smash it against the opposite part of the doorway.
---
TIL, that's awesome.
---
He is invisble to survivors when hes 32 meters away, and appers and dissaepred randomly if hes not withen 16 meters, which the same as a tier 2 myers TR. He also has the lullbay which is non directinaol. 
---
Addons improve his stealth, but he does have it.
---
&gt;You got caught by a killer who is complety invisble
---
You can literally hear him coming and see grass moving out of his way.  
---
&gt; and can pull you in from a range 
---
And then you have ***seven full seconds*** to get away from him.  
---
And assuming that he's chasing someone else, then he literally did a driveby sleep on you. Blow up the gen ***ONCE*** and you're back to being a normal survivor 20 seconds later.  
---
&gt; The fuck you mean it does nothing? 
---
You are speaking of add ons. I'm speaking of his built in kit. So I would like to say that you should stop trying to argue base kit by backing your argument up with addons.  
---
That's like me calling Hillbilly overpowered because he has instasaw.  
---
Plot twist. Hillbilly isn't overpowered, instasaw is bullshit. It isn't his base kit though. So don't argue that.
---
It just takes practice, all killers are viable. If you know how to use their power effectively. A great example is the doctor. If you know how to time your shocks at a loop, it will cancel the loop. He has a little map pressure but not much.
---
Well you can still be just as good as PC players. I have a friend on ps4 who is just as god tier as you a think a 3000 hour nurse main would be
---
The devs do watch the sub, so maybe they saw the mistake? Idk
---
I‚Äôm in UK on One X and this issue still seems to be happening full console reboot made zero difference. Three friends also been having same issues for 24 hours at least.
---
I was just banned for no reason tonight. I sent a ticket to both EAC and BHVR, hopefully I will get unbanned as well. I didn't modify game files or cheat in any way.
---
Well yeah but my point is that you can still be just as good
---
Its not complety invisble, but he can still apper out of no where. And what do you mean has no draw backs? The luillbay is cofusing to track. 
---
READ MY GOD DAMN SETENCE. All i said is ADDONS IMPROVE IT. He still HAS it in his Base kit. God damn read my post.
---
Glad to hear you got unbanned soon after and it wasn‚Äôt just a false positive and left to be banned :)
---
At least we can‚Äôt see her nipple
---
Trapper's power is easily avoided if they aren't good. But if they are good, you will step in at least 2 traps in a game. If you get chased, and he herds you towards his traps.
---
Lame.
---
Cool, a sort of late game killer. It would be nice as well if he could collect the materials from survivors after downing them, then make a doll based on them.
---
 If you're going to say something is datamined provide proof. These sound incredibly fake lmao.
---
Hey c'mon give me a break guys, It was just an idea. I'm a super low rank Player (Rank 16) and I am awful at hitting survivors. I'm sorry I'm not some pro rank 1 that can just say something and then everyone agrees.
---
Didn‚Äôt they nerf it though?
---
And I never see the point in dead hard. Every killer expects it so they just wait it out.  Then you use it.   Then you‚Äôre screwed.
---
No need, self-care isn‚Äôt honestly that good of a perk. Convenient? Yes. Useful time management of 32 seconds? No.
---
it‚Äôs just better for someone else to heal you
---
There is a very small percentage of P3 Clauds that  aren't toxic (toxic as in tbag and *click* *click*)
---
Haha amen
---
Yes, however my point is that the way consoles are designed and the nurse's ability make it more difficult to pick her up and expect the same amount of time for both to give you the same result.
---
Same happened to my boyfriend today, he got unbanned just now.
---
what that neck do
---
I'm pretty new to the game still but I've gotten a good amount of experience with a couple of killers, my favorite is the Pig (something very satisfying about the RBT, plus she's the best at jump-scaring survivors when they turn a corner and run right into a crouched Pig). 
---
Least favorite is probably Wraith, I don't think the invisibility is very effective and it's very hard to get the drop on survivors anyway with that huge bell.
---
Does that mean prayer beads are unbalanced?
---
As a killer main I don't believe, I only get killer quests
---
Yes Prayer beads are OP. But base Spirit is fine
---
My roommate got this last night while I didn't despite being on the same network, and it eventually just sorted itself out.  Although now I'm getting it lol.
---
I googled it and I've read different ways to fix it, but none of them are consistent.  One dude apparently had the error for 9 months, which is just nuts.
---
I'm having the same issue
---
With the wraith if you can pit on coxcombed clapper. It scares the daylights out of people, it's comparable to jump scare myers.
---
that‚Äôs because i made it up lmao. i‚Äôm getting back at my friends, so i needed to make a ‚Äúdataminer‚Äù post about the perks on reddit so i could screenshot it. the post is hidden now though
---
Huh, someone told me that a long time ago maybe not then
---
Whoever you like using the most or you think looks the cooler, perks dont matter once you get teachables and you don't really need a character that blends easily on dark environments.
---
Yup
---
&gt; Sure you can hear and see him, but his pwoer is still RANGED and unblockable, meaning your going to sleep if he gets close enough to you. 
---
His power has literally no affect on you for seven seconds and during those seconds. After that you have forever to wake up by blowing up a gen or failing a healing skill check. You're acting like it's a Huntress hatchet. Falling asleep sucks but it isn't the end of the world.  
---
&gt; then you have the deal with the action speed pently to get randomly placed skill checks all while he can still see your aura from acorss the map. 
---
1. Action speed penalty has exactly ***no effect*** on skill checks.
---
2. Seeing your aura is useless if he's in a chase with another survivor.
---
&gt;Lullbay to make it harder to track him, dream ablities to work, teleporter cooldown, stall by the form of waking up, and the visoon to make it harder to see. 
---
Lullaby? Yes.  
---
Dream abilities work? Yeah.   
---
Teleporter cooldown? I figure you mean this as the more survivors are asleep the faster it regenerates. This is one of the few things I did not know but nevertheless, the generator teleport is a nearly pointless addition to his kit. It takes forever to recharge, it takes forever to channel, it is disorienting, without whispers there's no way of knowing if a survivor is nearby, even with Whispers it is better to just leave the area rather than scan it for the one survivor who is very likely to be sprinting away anyways.  
---
Stall by waking up? There's no real incentive to wake up aside from being affected by dream abilities. Hardly worth blowing up a gen over unless Freddy has addons which, again, makes dream world *even more pointless.*
---
&gt; His new kit does fuck all? 
---
Yes. His global teleport is nowhere near that of Nurse, Hag, or Billy's map control. His traps and pallets are *extremely* situational, even more so than trapper's, dream world gives no debuff, he barely has any stealth and tracking is non-existent compared to before.  
---
But I'm not going to reply to you any longer. I have no desire to continue a toxic conversation.
---
I'm on right now playing xbox so I don't think it's a problem with their servers, but I could be wrong
---
It'll hurt my play style quite a bit since I play a super aggressive Trapper and rely on slugging with traps since I used plenty of my time setting up. I'm also worried about the bugs it may bring. Trapper has fair bit of bugs that go unnoticed since no one plays him.
---
most swf just want to fuck around anyways. usually they‚Äôre too altruistic as well
---
to play Legion and Doc are the most fun to play and the least fun is pig to play and hag to fight
---
But what do you do when that's not an option?
---
If we're going off of what the killers do, then there's a bit of a problem.
---
Myers, Ghostface, and Leatherface are pretty easy to get right. You can just drop them in here with their weapons, powers, and techniques and they'll get to stabbing.
---
Jigsaw is hard to get right. I think the devs failed to properly translate Pig into the game, but it would be possible with a lot of work on unique addons for different traps.
---
Freddy is just impossible. He can't do anything while you're awake, but when you fall asleep you're just dead. It takes Freddy several days to do what Myers can do in one night. Freddy is inevitable and inescapable, but none of that matters in a game that only lasts **10 minutes**.
---
That's why, before Freddy came out, people thought he wouldn't come; because we knew he it would be damn near impossible to get him right.
---
Freddy getting a change is necessary. This ***complete*** overhaul wasn't. That's the biggest issue here. He retains exactly nothing from his past iteration.
---
*Killer takes less than 5 hits to down a survivor*
---
Reddit survivors: Killer is unfun, has no counter, and needs a nerf
---
It‚Äôs really easy to game the system. If you want survivor dailies, just do a single game of Killer and delete a daily for a new one, or wait for the next refresh.
---
Not proud, just happy. I really thought I needed a 4K to get merciless. I was confused.
---
I mean, sure if you can't find someone you'll come back, but in most instances you should be able to. Enough so that you aren't "called out" for tunnelling.
---
&gt;Also you‚Äôre going to have generators popping in your face regardless
---
Well of course, but if you tunnel you guarantee them popping faster than usual, cause you're just letting survivors comfortably work gens while only one person has to bother with the unhook and then go back to doing their gen.
---
Now this, this is omega kek
---
That's kind of what I was trying to say. Obviously I'm just a salty little legion main here, but it just baffles me that his power is so substantially more hindering than other killers.
---
I‚Äôd believe it. As someone who flips between stretches of killer and survivor main, I just play a game as the side I don‚Äôt want a daily for- so a killer game if I want a surv daily - then lo and behold,my next dailies are all survivor
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cc0lvc/identical_bloodwebs_bug_or_intended/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
My roommate got this last night while I didn't despite being on the same network, and it eventually just sorted itself out. Although now I'm getting it lol.
---
I googled it and I've read different ways to fix it, but none of them are consistent. One dude apparently had the error for 9 months, which is just nuts.
---
Jesus, that's amazing.
---
Lol I did the same when I first started playing killer. I was insanely confused
---
It's still an escape that can happen before all 5 gens are done. They didn't have to put it in the game at all.
---
Nah the killer was a champ and kept playing
---
Did you ignore my 2 posts talking about his power and just saying "He is just trash".
---
If you patrol/borderline facecamp, sure, you‚Äôre giving away free gens, but if you‚Äôre not doing that and your timing is right to catch both the unhooked survivor and then chase their friend, you‚Äôve just occupied 3 survivors (including the one presumably running to help the crawler). If not, cool - the killer can rehook the first survivor and occupy the second with heals or actually hooking them. At that point, who cares that the other survivors got 2 more gens? They‚Äôve been cut in half, and now only one will be working on the remaining gens while the other tries to save the man on the hook.
---
Also the killer‚Äôs ability to find someone when they leave the hook depends on the window of time we‚Äôre talking about. Do they have to go check 3 gens before coming back? The whole map? Are they tunneling if they come back at any point? If I find someone quickly, then sure I‚Äôll leave the hook alone. But if I don‚Äôt see anyone and I want to find a survivor ASAP (also known as playing the objective) then your guaranteed to find one about to unhook the survivor you just hooked a minute or two ago.
---
Tunneling is shitting on unhooked survivors only and not having the balls to find new targets.
---
do not question the entity.
---
Yeah and then the good Surviviors that get matched with potato's de facto lose
---
Exactly, just pick someone you like the most, perks is where it matters and all the survivors are the same just with different skins. I main Nea and Jeff myself but haven‚Äôt P3 her, because I have all the perks in the game unlocked from the grind web and like messing around with different variations of perks. Jeff is P3 and slowly getting all the perks unlocked from the BW with him. At least get each survivor to level 50 but don‚Äôt prestige any of them until you know which one you wanna go to P3 with and you will know which one...
---
Are the progress bars finishing faster than normal for you?
---
But if what you said was fact, they wouldn't be able to disagree. "Snares are good" is an opinion. "Water is wet" is a fact. Your entire post is an opinion, and you're entitled to it. But don't act like your opinion is a fact. Shit like that is what's wrong with reddit.
---
What scenarios of insta downs are you talking about? Like Myers, Well that all Myers Has going for him besides a smaller terror radius that's his whole power. Make your choice? NOED? Devour hope? Haunted grounds? These are all perks that a killer has to use a perk slot on and has to meet certain conditions to use. Survivors having all 4 of their perks plus the ability to make your entire chase worthless by instantly full healing a survivor.
---
And for the record I think things like irri heads for huntress and the insta down bottle for clown are scummy too. It's making people too strong when they don't need to be that strong.
---
Yeah I didn't expect that too, it took me 5 minutes to delete, block and report all 3 of them, I hope they get ban or something like that
---
They have a cast time, and an arm time. I don't know where you got this "instantly" shit from.
---
Consistency is what I mean. Coming from PC, I think the skillset of the players on PC and Console are meaningfully different, although Huntress does get a leg up on PC. She is viable, but not consistent.
---
Damn she didn‚Äôt have adrenaline. That‚Äôs rare
---
Smol boi
---
I'd rather play live Freddy than dream snares.
---
How the hell is Nurse not #1?
---
Good one ü§£
---
Yah Justice is a great perk idea but it I‚Äôm telling you now if it went to a PTB the PC crowd would be screaming for a Nerf! Hell look at Freddy its only in the PTB and they have been crying.
---
Dm me the spoilers and I'll confirm or deny them as I've already watched all of season 3
---
Ping is an exception too lol
---
Sorry, turns out my controller was dying, analog stick was not responding as it should be. Strangely enough only dbd was affected hard by this, took me a while to notice it in other games, and when it went completely dead.
---
I haven't been rick rolled in like a year. Thanks for reminding me how much I miss that song.
---
Because end game chat was a mistake. I don't know why it was implemented in the first place. It's just a salt mine.
---
and could you post your pc specs?
---
No, pink add-ons are the same. Running an op pink add-on for a killer is the same as running one for a tool. Your'e comparing apples to oranges here. Camping is a different mechanic.
---
Lmfao! Nice!
---
Then go watch it.
---
That may be what your opinion on it is, but according to the majority of the playerbase and apparently to the devs, a complete and total reiteration was necessary because his kit didn‚Äôt work for consistent high ranking gameplay. Again, probably 98% of the community agreed that he was poorly designed before. I personally felt that he wasn‚Äôt badly designed, he just required the player to play him differently from most of the other killers and many people couldn‚Äôt adapt to that. But in communities like this, majority rules, and a majority ruled that his old form was outdated and poorly designed.
---
and could you post your pc specs please?
---
Both are good in their own way. I just love when I‚Äôm getting looped by a survivor and they finally drop the pallet just for blood to fly everywhere!
---
Yur welcome lol
---
On the other hand, not even starting a chase to begin with prolongs the time it takes for the killer to finally get a first hit on a DIFFERENT survivor they find. I dont ever carry exhaustion perks, but when I Urban Evasion, I am not hiding all match. I stick to gens, and when I catch wind of a killer coming, I UE away to a tree not far away, strafe around it until they leave, and IMMEDIATELY go back to work on the gen I was on before. There is no downside here.
---
Camping is equal to what action by the survivors then?
---
they most simple fix would be to switch the locker positions and doesn't make it directly next to a window, but still that would a nerf since you need a window if you are doing a lockers play :///
---
O-O
---
Cool, thanks! Another game to try out is always good.
---
I would love that
---
maybe nothing important worst thing would happen is nerf the amount of pallets / snares the killer can use
---
Holly shit it didn‚Äôt see this! Thanks!!! ü§ò
---
i don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs toxic here..?
---
They don't balance the game around people who suck at it. Your ideaology is that you're bad so it should be buffed you just said that your rank 16 tho so ????
---
yeah i have the same
---
Except for the fact that you have no rights to their game, it's their intellectual property,  and buying it is you merely buying a license to use their product. Not ownership. 
---
**Use a better analogy next time.**
---
nice job, like always. 
---
I love your skin renders
---
Holy shit... what rank were they on?
---
Xbox is having problems as well, unable to sign in.
---
But what is wrong with it?
---
Same here!
---
Hello, I've been having this problem for 2 days already. I've tried reinstalling the game, reinstalling my steam, restarting my steam, restarting my internet and nothing works. I can easily play other games but just not this one. I really don't know where the problem is and It is kinda annoying because I would love to play and I can't. Can anyone help?
---
Red Rank survivors.... smh...
---
*Wow I've never seen this happen before*
---
I‚Äôm getting this as well, been trying to sign in for 10 minutes now, gonna give up soon.
---
Because the complaints about Legion nearly crashed the internet so BVHR overnerfed them.
---
And what tradition do cornrows come from?
---
yes, but the t bagging in your face is worse than them waiting at the gate
---
People who bring bps when it‚Äôs a SWF have a special spot in heaven
---
just to let you know it can be ridiculously hard to pip sometimes I black pip 3 to 5 times in a row
---
Yeah no thanks.
---
but all of my friends can play except me, so I don't get it :(
---
Pff, who needs facts when you have speculation and assumption?
---
Lol I laugh when I see him, you know one of the devs probably thought that dude up while sitting on the shitter!
---
Not if you don‚Äôt run any hexesss
---
Enlightening the mentally poor is as important as curing cancer.
---
I already said it. Do some research. You can google and educate yourself. I‚Äôm not your parent.

Fuck them. That's all.

Plague is not that low

No you

‚ÄúGone from that game for a week and firearms get introduced!‚Äù Sweet!

r/cursedcomments
---
Ah man I wish I could, I'm too shit Ruin is my only chance hahah
---
I just mean playing against him. There's just no hiding. Taking away one of the best tools of a survivor
---
But that's the best part. To each their own I just enjoy seeing them worked up. I never try to do it on purpose which makes it better.
---
Dwighterina
---
Actually it was on console..
---
It‚Äôs also good for shutting down loops- even a small decrease in speed will either force the survivor to bail out of the loop or slow them down enough for you to get a hit off.
---
That's a bullshit excuse every survivor that dcs runs to when they suck. I've spent games where I dont get anyone until 3/4 gens pop not finding a survivor, find 1, down them, then they DC because they got downed. Survivors are babies against killers that have a brain. Get fukt in a mindgame, DC. T3 Myers? DC. Stalked by gf? DC. Hatchet hit? DC because no one sees huntress, but knows shes nearby. Hell, theres survivors that dc just because of who the killer is. Dont try and act like survivors DC just because of camping and tunneling. And either way, survivors that DC are dicks. They just screwed their team out of time they could've spent working on gens, while you waste the killers time.
---
in the lore dwight‚Äôs not a nerd, he‚Äôs trying to be a nerd and a jock.  And Feng is not a nerd either.
---
I‚Äôm pretty new to the game so I don‚Äôt have any hexes yet haha, I‚Äôm just a mad chainsaw Billy
---
While I agree that tortureporn became a hallmark of the Saw series, Saw actually has a pretty complex (and at times convoluted) storyline that spans through all 7 films.
---
Then there‚Äôs Jigsaw which just retcons a bunch of shit.
---
I just lay there like no thanks.
---
Ah I read over the consistency part my bad. I will say that Huntress has it worse on console because the game just does not run as well as it does on PC (tho it has gotten better). 
---
Good Huntress players can find a way to get 2Ks on big maps but often you‚Äôre forced to stay on one side if you want more than that. Which sucks. I mean, not all killers are consistently viable across all maps  but Huntress seems to have gotten it worst recently with Yamaoka Estate and the Plague‚Äôs map.
---
Thought so, people can have their hair how they want, if thats the case black people can't straighten their hair because its appropriating white culture.
---
Yes, because Trapper and Wraith need the game to be even harder for them I agree.
---
With the exception of Myers, the M1 killers are not very good. The last thing we need is one of the few perk combos that work on them to have a counter.
---
shut up cracker
---
Some of us cleanse all the totems bc of NOEDs, and it worked lots of times.
---
swap laurie and ace, perfection.
---
That's the struggle of the Freddy Main. The only alleviation from that is that you can sleep them right away again.
---
That's why the range and skillcheck chance addons are the best, you can sleep from half the map and feel relatively secure that they won't wake up right away.
---
Would say that 3 of them where swf.
---
Unlucky.

I‚Äôm having the same problem, I think it‚Äôs a server error.
---
So you think because I don‚Äôt sit here and type and essay on why it‚Äôs not okay for white women to have cornrows that I‚Äôm wrong? Don‚Äôt mean to be rude, but you‚Äôre being very ignorant and childish right now.
---
*Huntress Daily:* Hit 4 people with your hatchets
---
*Me:* FFS I'M TRYINGGGGGGGGGGG
---
I think it‚Äôs a server issue. Glad to see it‚Äôs not just me but still sucks. Haha I‚Äôm in USA NW if that helps.
---
TUNNELING IS NOT A PROBLEM ITS PART OF THE GAME
---
Why does Clown on second pic looks like a Borderlands character
---
The only one I see is Breaker, as it's a hard counter to Enduring + Spirit Fury, a combo thats most effective on the bad killers like Wraith and Trapper. So the very existence of this perk would nerf them.
---
these are pretty good.
---
Those are cool, any survivor ones?
---
Same issue, probably server problem. 
---

I stopped dodging all together. I just go in expecting to be looped to infinity. So I only run meme builds and dumb stuff.

Like fast as fuck boi bubba. That‚Äôs just funny.

Oh, I know, its Handsome Jack
---
Which the clown does 10x better, without having to lay them.

I fixed it lol

This is my build that I use except I rotate BT in and out for any of Unbreakable, Hope, and Head On.

Why does everyone say that huntress has the worst map pressure? Sure, she's a 110% killer with no mobility skill, but the mere fact that you can land distance hatchets with BBQ/NC allows a (good) huntress to put far more pressure on the map than Clown or Leatherface with 115%
---
Down for me too on Xbox in the UK
---
Doc's pallets are an addon, though. But the point still stands.
---
I wouldn't
---
Same here (Xbox one) been trying for 20+ minutes now, gonna give up soon and move to another game.
---
The only thing that comes up is that its origin is from Africans. Your whole logic is just double standards.
---
Exactly! He did it for COD zombies and even voiced the lines! But yah I wasn‚Äôt upset when I first started playing heard there was a Freddy in the game and then was disappointed when I seen him. Freddy was a nightmare when I was a kid back in the 80‚Äôs
---
Same here, about 30 minutes now, I‚Äôm gonna give up soon and move to another game.

If you‚Äôre not face camping, go ahead and just kill everyone around the hook. Honestly, if people in my game are getting unhooked quickly, I stay pretty close to them (not camping or face camping) but you‚Äôre damn right I‚Äôll be waiting to kill the survivor that got off the hook/unhooked. 
---
It sounds like the people you‚Äôre playing against are just butthurt that you‚Äôre doing well. Don‚Äôt sweat it just play.  
---
As long as you aren‚Äôt standing there, staring at the hooked survivor, I think you‚Äôre fine imo.
---
But can the Clown also teleport to any gen he wants?
---
By itself, the snare wouldn‚Äôt work well as Freddy‚Äôs sole power. As part of his bigger kit (Dream Projection, only becoming fully visible at a range), they‚Äôre alright. A buff is needed, sure, and Dream Pallets are better in general- but they‚Äôre underestimated.
---
Just watched a streaming using his primary attack infinitely fast, dashing forward, while carrying a downed survivor, it's incredible OP.
---
How did you even notice this, the cynical part of me says it's the same bloodweb.
---
Oh. I know true days the game is survivor sided does hexy believe its killer favored?
---
Yea we three were one Swf but still wtf.
---
I was thinking about this, i feel it would be good if you‚Äôve hit p3 lvl 50 with a character, that if you want you can prestige again and give one of your acquired outfit pieces a bloody design, and there would be toggle option on cosmetics so you can swap between bloody and non-bloody so your cosmetic inventory doesn‚Äôt get cluttered.
---
The fact you had to post about it implies you do.
---
maybe monitor your cpu temperature. the game shouldn't restart your pc and  watch in the event viewer and look for the error and google the event id.
---
since when is this happening?
---
Yeah that was who I was talking about too
---
And Bill is just old.
---
This was happening to me last night
---
Please sir stop, I have a son. He is very sick.
---
Wow this is good. Wholesome
---
Depends on what I feel like doing in the match and who I'm playing with. A standard loadout for me would be Small Game, Borrowed Time, Balanced Landing, and Prove Thyself.
---
If I'm getting a bad camping night I'll use Borrowed Time, Deliverance, Decisive Strike, and whatever for a 4th perk.
---
If I'm just goofing off then Ace in the Hole, Plunderer's Instinct, Small Game, and whatever else.
---
My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
---
In your fantasy. In reality, most killers target Dwight first. So do I. They have such punchable face.
---
Whatever you say lol
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you mean Claudette
---
Bruh...have you SEEN dem toenails?
---
She's using an axe animation, TRUST ME Lol
---
I LOVE YOUR WORK!!!!!
---
You have to ask that guy showing the skins since he is probably the only one using the dev build to unlock the new content.
---
So close!!!!
---
it is not, i screenshotted it because of the 5 manna grass baid addons. I have proof on my steam profile ( they are 2 seperate screenshots with different dates )
---
 Very true, but I‚Äôve learned other ways of playing against him. It all depends on the person using him, the Dr. Can fuck up a hole game or be left in the corner crying because he got steam rolled...
---
It‚Äôs cool too because you can actually see the scar on his neck
---
its nothing.
---
It's been working fine for me and all my friends on ps4
---
I think I just went into A Fib
---
LOL @ Dwight Incel because they sure sound like one. Delusional too.
---
We'll get the first collection of Pig and Tapp cosmetics next week (probably the leather Pig and undercover Tapp) and then the week after that we'll get the next (test subject Pig and beat cop Tapp).
---
I‚Äôm more concerned about Spirit‚Äôs googly eyes
---
I'm a killer main and i only get survivor dailies .
---
Gen-rushing is (for survivors) the same as tunneling (for killers), they are both the best strategy to "win" the match, and that's way some survivor/killer see it as a toxic behaviour, cuz it ends the game faster for one side or the other. So you can see these start as "toxic" (but you have to accept both them as toxic then) or just see them as a way to win the game and just play the way you want to.
---
I shall press X to doubt
---
Pretty dope!
---
Stop you're gonna give me nightmares
---
It‚Äôs pretty obvious if you look at his comics
---
Why dodge when you just can play Spirit
---
Nah, David was lagging, he deserved it :P
---
Dat hollow shell tho
---
But I like the fact that I can break pallets with my feet or chainsaw as Bubba/Billy :c Them using their chainsaw for a normal pallet break would just end up being a recycled animation.
---
Happends a lot when I'm being chased and about to get that window, thrn someone with sprint burst passes by and just blocks the window to heal herself.
---
There's nothing wrong with survivor dailies...
---
I use adrenaline dead hard self care and ds at rank 12 and have had success
---
Butwhatabout the other guys, time for me to explain why they suck balls to! I'm not insecure! You're insecure! Shut up!
---
happening to me also
---
probably
---
And delicious.
---
Yup same here. Really wanted to play too
---
obligatory "yes" here
---
You ni
---
Instead of hooking survivors, you chain them to hook poles and lie motionless in front of them.
---
Due to cross map hatchets being too unreliable. So many maps have clutter that would make it impossible to hit unless they were out in the open. That being said, there also is OoO, which counters her VERY hard.
---
you might wanna try it now. i just got in
---
Is he a nazi only because he has different opinion?
---
Thanks for the answers dude, I will try. 
---
I don't really know since when but some months for sure. Btw I had this pc for a lot of years and this is happening only recently.
---
I'm being called trash etc all the time, it's just for mental health
---
this,   I have seem to forget this, ALWAYS face a wall when picking someone up if not some meg with a flashlight is going to ruin your day
---
Still failing to load unfortunately, on both mine and my fianc√©‚Äôs systems. Was there a process to getting through? Or just pressing okay to continue etc.
---
So the ridiculous queue times are a feature
---
Right, true. Just in case I happen upon a 8-man sfw with 4 toolboxes and 4 flashlights. I'll need all those moris then.
---
Honestly, im a killer main and havent touched a killer in over 2 months. The lobbies are painfuly long, when i can get a survivor lobby in 0.0001 ms
---
Do you realize ppl don't dodge cause of "toxicity", who even gives a shit about tbaggers as long as you win the match, the problem is swf itself, shit's fucking broken, communication gives a huge advantage to survs, an advantage that shouldn't even exist for the way the game was designed. That you like it or not, the sad reality of things is that an optimal team of swf will always wreck even a good killer (take nurse out of the equation), because there is mechanically no time to do random hooks and put gen pressure against survs who always know what you're doing so they consequently make little to no mistakes. Dbd Is an assymetrical horror game, that means that there's a "power role" (killer) and a team (survs), but vs good swf most killers are unable to control the match, gens fly, and unless you "tunnel" somebody to get a kill in the first 2-3 gens (and you would get genrushed anyway since the others know that ur after that 1 guy) you pretty much lost the game. THIS is the reason people don't want to play against them, because they lose that feeling of control which the role of the killer implies. Maybe BHVR will wake up one day and make a casual mode where u can play with ur friends and leave rankeds for the solo experience (which is how the game was designed to be played).
---
There is a lot of great responses, Thank you!
---
I have decided to go ahed and try Meg.
---
Lots of love!
---
Same here. Me and a friend cannot log in
---
First day I can play all day and this happend... Fuck this
---
Depends. I've been able to get plenty of games where I just juggle the survivors and keep everyone injured and almost always have a hooked survivor. But if they do decide to legit gen rush you're fucked.
---
IM FUCKING GOING TO RAPE FUCKING TOXIC SURVIVORS WHO USE CHEESEY AND UNBEATABLE LOOPS AN UNHEALTHY AMOUNT
---
Your opinion on video games, just like anything, can be wrong. Getting hit as a survivor is losing the game, how brain dead do you have to be to not understand that?
---
One guy managed to get in after the error, not sure how though. 
---
I‚Äôm going to tweet at BHVR and see if they‚Äôll address
---
Her legs are gross, its freaking me out
---
This has to be a bug, this would've been too strong. But hey we have noed in the game so who knows
---
I like it as a filler perk. Really fucks some survivors up when they go to teabag or think they have more time to run past me than they do.
---
After checking my fianc√©‚Äôs console, it‚Äôs also getting the error, I‚Äôll update the post and reply to you if I find a way.
---
do you have the newest version of windows installed?  
---
the problem is idk what exactly fixed it for me, I did too much to try to fix it.  
---
I reinstalled windows, turned the fans up, disabled fast start up, removed the cpu cooler cleaned it and put it back on it and it still crashed, after cleaning the cooler it only crashed 1 more time and since then it didn't.
---
maybe windows 10 1903 fixed it, idk.
---
Beautiful!!!
---
people actually do this? lol pussies.
---
Which one are you talking about? Queen or the censored one?
---
That‚Äôs why I said that I let them chase me down, the moment I get knocked I dc. Reason why is I‚Äôve noticed when you get tunneled this bad they always mori you
---
I think we are all hoping that killer awoke their inner face camp and camped the shit out of that meg
---
Can still hit üòÇ
---
Broken killer
---
Please tell me youre joking, thats the only cosmetic ive liked so far
---
Yeah, can't start the game either :/
---
Blood Hero is basically timed mettle of man, but better!
---
Ey thanks I wouldn't have noticed!
---
Can‚Äôt start either
---
this comment isnt really related but they need to kinda boff nurse, doctor and huntress in dbd mobile. well not buff, they just need to rework something. so killers like: nurse, doctor, huntress and hillbilly have like this red arrow pointing to them. but the hillbilly has a red arrow pointing to them then they use their power. but the other killers always have this red arrow pointign to where they are which makes them really weak in chases or outside of a chase in general. hope they rework it soon
---
It's BHVR, of course they're gonna be scummy as hell.
---
There's already a counter to Enduring/Spirit Fury.
---
it might be timed after all it is on the pc files
---
As far as I know, all your saved data is on dead by daylights server not your console.
---
maybe try disabling the fast start up, just look for it at google or youtube if you don't know how to do it.
---
This was with 4 rank 4 survivors and a rank 3 killer
---
We had a ruin spawn once tucked behind a fire barrel. My buddy and I did a gen directly next to it and never even saw it. He only found it when the Billy walked him to it and showed him where it was.
---
If they‚Äôre going to make your job as the killer so easy for you like that destroy them all without mercy and slake the thirst of the Entity with their blood.
---
Dead hard isn't to dodge hits. It's to get you that last little bit to the safe window or pallet to keep on running.
---
Check out the screeching rank 20's on YouTube. It's the real Nightmare.
---
Sorry for the crap screen recording I don‚Äôt know how to crop them.
---
If that's true, Jesus fing Christ, I deal with so much bs allys and killers spamming my messages. I feel bad for Killer mains lol
---
I'm talking about my survivor games, dumbass.  I see people vault late all the time.  It's like people dont realize killer can still hit you through the window.
---
You got me üòâ
---
huh?
---
I would‚Äôve cried if I was the survivor lol this was awesome üëèüèªüëèüèª
---
After about a week or two you‚Äôll start to understand what to do and watching streamers can help too, you won‚Äôt exactly get bodied since the killers/survivors you‚Äôll be going against at your rank will most likely be as new as you are, go ahead and give it a shot
---
There is a large learning curve (at least in my experience) and it will be tough at first but the game is really fun.
---
Nobody will disturb my quiet life.
---
Cry bout it
---
Guess not being an asshole is also harder than we give you credit for.
---
What the fuck do you mean ‚Äústrong advantage‚Äù you need to learn how to play them you fucking dumbass, it‚Äôs clear as day you‚Äôre just shit, no wonder you‚Äôre rank 11 if you think you just buy a killer and automatically get 4ks, You don‚Äôt know what pay to win means, 
---
you‚Äôre just a dumbass who happens to be shit at the game, All the best killers are base game, your argument is null and void by the very fact Killers are supposed to have an advantage, that‚Äôs the fucking point of the game, it‚Äôs a 4 vs 1, when you actually know how to counter play your opinion will mean something but at the moment you‚Äôre just making shit up to excuse poor playing , ‚Äúpay to win‚Äù fucking lol
---
Don‚Äôt listen to them, they‚Äôre just being salty. You can play whatever you like, you want. Also welcome to Dead by daylight community!
---
Just know that I liked this meme enough that you have recieved the first gold I've ever bought.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cc1sdb/m1m2_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Killers like Michael, Bubba, and Freddy cost money cause they are licensed
---
Killers like Plague, Spirit, and legion can be bought with iridescent shards since they are original made killers
---
Yeah, that's the part I was unsure of. I didn't have any other objectives and they were trying to save the hooked guy
---
I'd suggest watching ScottJund or Zubat's huntress. (While they do use crosshairs) the only maps that they rarely hit BBQ hatchets on are L√©ry's and the Game, for obvious reasons.
---
Its just the game
---
Indeed haha
---
Crazy old Maurice, eh? Crazy old Maurice....
---
thanks man
---
Yes it should be the newest one (but I have to check to be sure), I think I'm going to try to see if it's a temperature problem and maybe reinstall windows. 
---
The only recent thing that changed in my pc is the monitor. I bought a benq 144hz in February but I don't know if this can have something to do with the problem.
---
good to hear! The 1 dead guy was super salty at the end lol
---
Wait this is out?? I can't find it on the play store!
---
He has made comics where he flat out denies the holocaust happened. He's also made comics that are, among other things: racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, islamophobic, and more. He's not even subtle about it.
---
I agree. Additionally, there is now a tutorial (not available when i bought the game) that does ease the learning curve a bit.
---
The guy you‚Äôre replying to is unironically claiming the game is pay to win, he doesn‚Äôt know what that fucking means lmao
---
On my pc reinstalling windows didn't fix it
---
thanks! Really fun game so far :)
---
PLay as wraith to build confidence / chasing skills. Its easy to find survivors while invisible aka( Predator stealth mode ) removes the anxiety completely in my mind.
---
I‚Äôm about to Mori you to death
---
I haven't gotten hit with noed in ages, cleansing totems through out the match is really easy.
---
I‚Äôm on mobile. It‚Äôs a screenshot because I don‚Äôt know how to do anything.
---
smh when did megs become evil? Ive always found the Neas and Clauds (esp squadettes *shivers*) are the bad ones
---
Nah, Dwights.
---
The first saw was a cop movie with trap scenes that were made of schizophrenic editing to induce a feeling of panic rather than focusing on how cut up people got
---
I honestly hate people that do this. Stop being toxic, just kill me or let me live.
---
No I‚Äôm pretty sure it says Claudette‚Äôs
---
See that happens about 3/10 times when I‚Äôm playing as killer.   And I don‚Äôt run DH but when I‚Äôm survivor 0/10 use it that way either.  I see people do it on YT and what not and it seems handy so I‚Äôm surprised more people don‚Äôt use it that way.
---
It took me a long time to even care to read the descriptions of offerings/add ons. I just focused on learning the base game first so I went through the same situation lol. All good.
---
She looks gorgeous.
---
I usually play on ps4 so keyboard control was impossible for me lmao
---
Disagree. It would force survivors to take the time to get sabo hooks ready, it only works once, plus the timers are really short.
---
don‚Äôt throwing axe the messenger*

Lol is this good for spirit and myers
---
SWAMP THING!

Ok

To send a message, kill the messenger

what killers do you not have leveled that have good teachables? them

Oh yeah that comic where that hippie said to open your mind. On his site he has a comment that says "oops, too open" so cant really say if 100% serious.
---
Also its comics that attack mainstream ideas
---
I tried to play after i wrote the comment lol. Also the lobby fix was january or last year even. Shortly after the ds fix.
---
They should just lock pc at 10fps too since we need to have all the same conditions as console players do.
---
People still haven't figured how to use ghostface?  I do really well with him (rank 5). Here's a hint, stop spending most of your time trying to be stealthy to get the stalk off. Ghostface can be really good if you can juggle objectives. When I play him I'm only trying to be stealthy like 10-20% of the time.
---
Almost all my dailies end up being killer based. This is how I end up playing with killers I don't normally. Like my Level 1 Doctor whom i have needed to use on several "shock therapy 4 survivors" in nunerous occasions
---
Right the plague, didn‚Äôt touch her at all
---
nurse dailies suck for me because i can‚Äôt  play nurse lol
---
I just said that I kill them afterwards????
---
Yep. Also lock the mouse sensitivity. And lock the controls to default only. Also make it so your aiming when you are nurse is 1% of your normal sensitivity.
---
I think his other powers are amazing, but his snares suck there no reason to use them over pallets.
---
Not my proudest fapp.
---
I guess he ate too many pieces of pizza...?
---
yea rbts are now practically useless after gens have been completed
---
and you know what is sadder?
---
that when you close the hatch it dosent complete gens it BLOCKS them so rbt isnt active...
---
and you wont really get a kill, timer is just too long for that
---
it can now only slow the gen progress little bit
---
Yea my problem with most survivor dailies is your reliant on other survivors to achieve them. Rescue people? Ok so I have to farm them so someone else doesn‚Äôt get them before me? Anything CO-OP, I have to find a random survivor on a gen and risk losing the game because I was looking for someone. And getting chased, ok so what if the killer never finds me, you want me to go and play toxic? Or if another survivor keeps looping him the whole game how tf do I get them to chase me? It‚Äôs ridiculous. Same goes for pipping too, it‚Äôs up to the killer being good enough to do anything so you don‚Äôt escape in 2 minutes and up to the survivors being decent enough to live but also die (otherwise you can‚Äôt save anyone)
---
No they're just blatantly inferior, the camera flick is infinitely better than an uncertainty-factor
---
I‚Äôd do it for free if it were that easy
---
Fave is Trapper, least is Bubba
---
I wanna make a correction. Stunning a killer with a pallet or otherwise DOES NOT break bloodlust. I believe this was in the game at some point but it isn't anymore.
---
[I recorded a short video on the subject with the help of a friend as proof.](https://youtu.be/UMqC0mhyAkM)
---
just walk up super close and almost always charge ur hatchet throw to max so they can't dodge
---
I love watching them stare back at me The the entire chase making it very clear that they have it.  So I just angle myself so that they run into a wall or a tree when they use it.  Idiots üòÇ
---
I played Huntress today for the first time since like December and idk if I was spoiled by Freddy/Clown but it felt so different. She felt slower and heavier if that makes sense
---
German be like One Titty
---
Getting downvoted is exactly why I Tea Bag lmfao I always escape you don‚Äôt have to believe me I don‚Äôt give a fuck about your life or what you have to say about it I‚Äôm just putting it out there because I can. And don‚Äôt bother replying cause I won‚Äôt be responding show your saltiness by downvoted rofl
---
FUCK THESE DEVS CAN'T FIX UPDATEPIP ERROR CAN'T RANK UP OR TYPE AFTER GAME BECAUSE IT KICKS ME OUT.
---
nah thats not camping. shouldnt listen to survivors tho, theyll get mad at nothing and call it facecamping. if they had it their way they'd win every game.

I was almost certain it did... hmm
---
yea but everyone just played ghostface thats why lobbies took so long for the past month or so
---
Okay bud. Legion is by no means weak. Using his ability you can easily track and injure all 4 survivors by just finding one. Pair that with the fact that each one you find now has to not do gens for a few seconds so a slight (not major granted) slow down to the game is applied. Now, if you're using a good build, he gets even better. Try "Save The Best For Last" on him. Every hit you get that isn't the obsession now makes your hit recovery faster. And with his ability, that QUICKLY gets to 8 stacks. Thanataphobia can fuck them up as well considering how quickly you can get and keep them injured. His stun is nothing honestly. I just strike twice for more stacks once everyone's injured then get my now super quick stabs in. 
---
Legion isn't easy to play, I get that, but he can do well with thought applied and some strategy.
---
They are comics. If he makes them, it doesent make him one. Fastest way to spread your shitposts today, is to make edgy, opinion dividing shitposts.
---
no please no...
---
it would ruin my p3 nurse...
---
That tripwire trap, damn... I'm glad they left that to the imagination
---
I guess that could be the case, but still, waiting over 5 minutes for a lobby when i can get one in 1 second is really off putting.
---
exactly that. i always switch to leatherface when i go against 3-4 man swf because they always play overly-altruistic, and leatherface is really good and punishing that
---
My sentiments exactly

Vigo‚Äôs has a long saggy butt though, if you look at it facing you. It looks like Dwight‚Äôs pants are going to fall any second.
---
Well yeah since she has 110% movement speed
---
I think that Paramedic should only work for the unhooked survivor, because as a killer I hate finding the unhooked survivor first.
---
Actually nothing happened. Just because I made a meme doesn‚Äôt mean there is any backstory. I made it just because when I saw this format this was the first thing I thought of.
---
The first film focused more on the philosophy and ideas behind the traps. Why were these two men chained in the bathroom (it's the bathroom from The Game map in DBD), how do they know each other? What did they do that pissed off whoever is doing this? 
---
Then as the film goes on, you start to realize what is happening. Is there gore and torture? Yes. But not that much. It focuses more on the audience asking "What would I do in this situation?"
---
The newer films, while I admit have a very complex story involving a ton of characters, tend to just be "Hey this guy stole money from a client, make him rip his small intestines out to get this key or else is eyes are yanked out of his body from a fishing hook". Then there's just a ton of yelling and screaming and swearing while heavy metal music plays, then they almost always die. 
---
Just watch [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZOMiFk2ThE) from the 7th film. Yes, that's Chester Bennington, and he can actually act better than half the cast of the newer films. But that's not the point. None of these people in that scene are main characters. None of them are plot specific, and yet this scene takes place during a hot moment in the plot, and leaves you asking "what, so he just found this group of racists and tied this whole trap together?" which makes no sense. The first film every trap had a reason. It was the start of jigsaw and his "perfect rehabilitation" as he describes it. 
---
Basically, go and watch the first one, enjoy the film, enjoy the cool music, see the iconic Reverse Bear Trap scene, and then if you really want to see what I mean, watch the others.
---
10/10 post
---
Maybe not OP, but at least strong, or viable even. You still get an upvote from me pal :)
---
It‚Äôs think it all boils down to an ‚Äúus vs them‚Äù mentality. Most games usually have the same kind of play style vs each other whereas dbd has two VERY different play styles for killer and survivor. Usually someone in red ranks on one side rarely is red rank on the other and usually doesn‚Äôt play the other so has little compassion for the other.

killer has no rules. only reason you shouldnt do things like facecamp or tunnel is it allows the other survivors to do gens.
---
"He's not racist. He just says racist things to get a reaction."
---
Yeah, that's called being racist.

Players did it all the time in Rocket League for the post-game chat. The word predictor works pretty well to speed up controller typing.

Pff I agree with him. Don't like it? Then don't be a bitch to people on the internet.
---
Because console is always a toxic wasteland especially ps4 i know I've got it too and self care is the ultimate old freddy counter
---
What does m1 mean?
---
Nice work!
---
You're not alone. Even the wiki has it wrong!
---
I have messages only on for friends. I laugh every time I get a friend request after having a 4K game against SWF. It shows just how salty they are that they are trying to friend request me just to attempt to send a salty message.
---
I feel like it can be buggy, because it seems on PS4 at least if part of the stalk is when you‚Äôre leaning you can finish stalking while chasing and it counts
---
I got, ‚ÄúMori a survivor as *The Ghostface*.‚Äù I don‚Äôt own Ghostface. And then there‚Äôs always, ‚ÄúChase your obsession for 120 seconds as Myers.‚Äù Wonderful.
---
Really? I've gotten tons of them. Enough to where I thought it was a worthwhile investment to get Rancor on all killers.
---
At low ranks I've played like 10 matches and have yet to get hit by a dream snare, but I have yet to survive a match.
---
~~maybe this is why I'm at low ranks~~
---
Good does not mean OP.
---
I just want them to give us the chance to choose a survivor daily or killer daily for that day.
---
Or a survivor and a killer daily a day would be nice as well.
---
SWF is innately toxic because the game simply isn't designed for it balanced around It. It breaks most of the game's mechanics, gives the effects of several survivor perks without the need to actually use a perk slot for them, and nullifies several killer's basic abilities.
---
It also prevents many gameplay possibilities. For example, one of the most requested killer powers is the ability to disguise yourself as a survivor. Basically everyone agreed that this would be the most logical ability for Ghost face. Yet that didn't happen, and never will, because allowing SWF would delete that killer's power entirely. 
---
"hey Steve, is that you walking towards me at the shack?"
---
"no."
---
"ok, we're up against The Disguise. Everyone make sure to report your location, that way he's just an M1 killer with no power. EZ."
---
Are those your only options... yikes, I'd say jeff
---
I like to use Unnerving Presence, Overcharge, Distressing, and a perk of your choice. (I use BBQ for more points but if you REALLY hate the survivors, and face it most Doc main's love mining industrial grade salt, run something like Franklin's Demise or Dying Light)
---
If you use double calm addons with distressing your treatment mode passive insanity AOE will be massive.

If you wear it with the original black slip dress shirt it looks like a full dress

I reckon there should be a random queue so you either go killer or survivor and it‚Äôll reward you a slight bonus for using that queue... or something.
---
Good catch
---
This it's literally me with my friends though! Must have bond so I know where mommy is
---
I feel that. I had to win as Jake, someone I never play as, and I kept getting bad games and the first chance I got for the exit gates to open I took it.... While someone was on a hook. Low-key might've been a dick move but at least I'm owning up to it.
---
No you where not camping it‚Äôs actually their fault he died. They kept running you around the house which as a survivor you should never do to help your team get the save.
---
You just put the image of Wraith karate-chopping a pallet in my mind.
---
I've very much so enjoyed the Wraith. I get my most confident victories as him, likely thanks to his increased movement speed while invisible.

Myers knows when he sees a Pizza Dwight. Praise

You‚Äôd think giving us 6 dailies 3/3 split would be the answer....

I've got mine open purely for my own enjoyment.
---
New Freddy is fucking terrifying. He's fast, and disappears from sight at a distance he can close quite quickly. He can teleport to gens, play loops like the clown or mind game with pallets. It feels like the survivors are always in a dream and the clock you need to wake up is across the goddamn map while you're working on a generator at the equivalent speed of ruin. Fail a skill check to wake up and work on the generator faster? He's already teleporting to your location. When you're in the dream you can kiss the heartbeat goodbye. I haven't been hit by a dream snare or fake pallet yet I can't seem to escape this killer. Mind you, these are people picking up this killer for the first time and kicking survivor's asses.
---
This is great lol
---
You described how I imagined Clown's perfectly.

Ok.
---
So Timed Wealth would either create a maximum of 4 extra items per match or would be completely useless for at most 3 of the 4 people in the match. Either way this perk is shit.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôm happy I got it even though one survivor went through the hatch. Didn‚Äôt know I could get it without a 4K.

Sweet heart, just because you suck at something dosen‚Äôt mean everyone in the world does

I spent almost 6 hours yesterday trying to complete my daily which was open the exit gate as Ace. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been more tilted in my life, I got the worst survivor teammates, the most camping killers, etc. I was fuming lmao. Quite a few times I‚Äôd be right at the gate to open it and a Claudette would get there RIGHT before me and open it no matter how many times I motioned her to get off. Absolutely horrible.
---
The dev's have ups and downs. They have alot of charisma and do listen to good amount of feed back.. Though most of the feedback they do listen to aren't the people they should listen to. They have "Fog Whisperers" For a reason. They also should really crack down on the toxicity. Alot of new players are either getting harassed or poorly influenced. Love them to death, though.
---
maybe i dont have bond lel
---
Just play both and then suck twice as many balls ez
---
sad

The Entity's Realm is Northern Ireland confirmed

Just do what you can to avoid that situation. Once you‚Äôre there the odds are against you.

---
I love the one where you can't see her boxes. More chaos and pressure every time. She needs more than 2 though (the fast timer one is good too)
---
S: Nurse, Spirit
---
A: Hillbilly
---
B: Hag, Huntress, Plague, Shape, Ghostface
---
C: Clown, Trapper, Doctor, Pig, Leatherface
---
D: Legion, Wraith
---
F: Freddy 
---
This coming mostly from a survivor‚Äôs perspective and not rework Freddy since I haven‚Äôt played him yet
---
Didn‚Äôt state how we are ranking the killers...   
---
S- Clown      
---
B-Bubba    
---
D- Mother Russia        
---
F- everyone else      
---
 Clearly this is the tier list for *thicc*ness
---
This shit just got real af. I am sorry for your Mom. As someone who has issues with mental health, I am sorry she has to deal with that.
---
But yeah, Nurse is a different beast.
---
Jesus Christ... You're a sensitive person, stop assuming people are racist based on stupid shit like hairstyles.
---
I don't give a damn about skin colour but im not going to sit here and be like "black people should be allowed this hairstyle but white people aren't"
---
Like I said earlier, the article can't call for equality for black people when it wants to also segregate people, equality does not work like that, you can't pick and choose.
---
Xbox my guy, get ps4
---
That‚Äôs actually kinda funny.
---
When you don‚Äôt know how to say the word ‚Äúentity‚Äù but you also somehow have a job
---
I wouldn't put Spirit above Billy
---
(Post rework and only considering these killers at their base ability): Nurse, hillbilly, Huntress/Spirit, Freddy, Myers, Hag, Trapper, Clown, Wraith, Doc/Pig, Leatherface. 
---
I do not own Legion or Ghostface, and I have played very little plague, thus I won‚Äôt include them in my definite tier list. However, from what I‚Äôve seen I‚Äôd put Legion dead last, Ghostface after Myers, and Plague would likely be on par with Clown. Another little thing to consider: I would break the killers into 4 grouped tiers, of Top (Nurse to Spirit), High (Freddy to Clown), Neutral (Wraith to Pig), and BAD, with the last tier having quite the drop off on ability from neutral (Leatherface and pre rework Freddy with potentially Legion).

---
Only since day one.
---
As a killer main, I know that if I dodge a lobby it'll take me two hours to find another because there are too many killer mains
---
Best comparison would be abusing an entity bug on the same window loops. However, that‚Äôs a bug and can‚Äôt be done willy nilly like killers making the conscious decision to camp. 
---
Killers have a lot more power than survivors if they want to be an asshole that game. A survivor is an asshole if the killer isn‚Äôt good enough to catch a more experienced survivor and all a killer has to do is stand in front of a hooked survivor to ruin that one individual survivors game. Does that make sense?
---
There‚Äôs been plenty of times where I just let myself die on the hook. Sometimes I just can‚Äôt be bothered :D
---
I'm good
---
Billy is overrated. Good, but overrated.
---
It's already impossible because of the stupidly long 5 second warning time the survivors have with the blood spewing out of the generators.
---
Ye that's where it came from
---
Jeff has better perks, but Jane is dummy thick
---
I agree. I mostly use his stealth mid-chase to help mindgame. Also, if I get at least 75% stalk on someone before they notice me, I'll move on and come back to them later.
---
It goes all the way down her arm. The severed head is on her leg.
---
I don't agree
---
Correct. At least on PS4 the game doesn't save data on your system it's just on the server so it shouldn't be a problem
---
Yeah this is big brain time.
---
This.
---
Sounds like a real swell guy.
---
oh my god it makes him so handsome you wouldn‚Äôt believe it

Gotta be a gentleman nowadays since no one else will be one. Be better than your worst enemy or there is no difference between you and them.
---
Hello, Satan.

That‚Äôs the one!

Ok I just had this happen to a nea on chapel asylum when I was doing a spirit daily

Never knew this. Good thing I know now
---
Yum yum yum politics In my gaming subreddit yum yum yum I really do like the taste of politics in my gaming subreddit yum yum yum
---
In my own personal opinion:
---
S - Nurse THEN Spirit (usually)
---
A - Hillbilly
---
B - Hag, Huntress, Pig (if she knows what she‚Äôs doing), possibly Plague
---
C - Doctor, Myers, Legion, Clown, New Freddy (either C or B, not sure yet), Bubba
---
D - Trapper, Wraith, Ghost Face (C or D)
---
F - Current Freddy
---
The bug:
---
A survivor gets caught in a trap. The trapper hits them. Once they struggle out they are only injured.
---
The fix:
---
A survivors gets caught in a trap. The trapper hits them. Once they struggle out they are in the dying state.
---
I have been summoned
---
If it helps, there's a shit load of toxicity on the survivor side too, from face camping and shit talking killers to sandbagging survivors that forget it's a team game.
---
After the third time I saw kys, I just stopped opening messages on the game. It's fucking ridiculous
---
This legitimately looks like my dad as a killer in dbd. Not sure how I feel about it.
---
These would make for some really good yellow rarity cosmetics. A little upset that they didn't do an anniversary event similar to Hallowed Blight and Moonrise where you could unlock said cosmetics during the event and purchase them with cells later on.
---
That‚Äôs my boy *weezes and coughs*

A lot of the time people think you are camping when they are practically throwing themselves at you because they are not half as good a player as they think they are.

---
Really cause that last sentence seems like something a killer would see in end game chat  a lot. JS.
---
I don't think the weapon fits the outfit, but I do appreciate its "rugged simplicity."
---
It seems pretty straightforward to me, people don‚Äôt like Nazi‚Äôs. Why would you use a template created by one when they‚Äôre are plenty other templates just like it and not created by terrible people? Gaming subreddits can have standards too
---
I bet it has less bugs...
---
To make it less troll like a successful stun should result in no scratch marks. An experienced killer can still track survivors by listening for noises.
---
Hey, 
---
I submitted one for Nea and I don‚Äôt see it ?
---
So YOU'RE the survivor crouching 15m away who leaves me on the hook because you "DoN't KnOw" where the killer is, and when someone else saves me you're the one who brings the killer to me as I'm healing after you already almost let me die on the hook. Thanks!
---
As long as it doesn't have noed I'm ok with it.
---
Add new cosmetics as well
---
But... But what if there's a 12-man SWF... The hole keeps going deeper...
---
oh my bad which one was it ill add it now
---
/r/antifastonetoss
---
While I agree the pallets are way better and more interesting, I think it's a slick little design trade off to force the killer to essentially forfeit an add-on to use the stronger power. I think that's a cool design space that they could do a lot of interesting things with
---
I wouldn't say Freddy was the most boring, it's probably the Nurse imo.
---
Maybe just make it being held instead of pressed.
---
SAIGHTS
---
I probably missed it lol

---
Thanks I think I accidentally listed these under doctor i'll add them now.
---
*sad spirit noises*
---
I'm going to assume that you meant those perks to be beginner perks given the whole **"practice"** part. Dead hard is only useful once **USUALLY** IMO. Once the killer knows you have it they can just get into lunge range and opt not to swing. If you try to predict the hit before you see the animation you fucked yourself. To make dead hard a good perk is to use it reacting to the animation of the swing. As a killer there are too many trigger happy survivors that dead hard the second i get into lunge range and end up being a potato.
---
Or at the very least keep or put the 'Stonetoss is a Nazi' watermark on them.
---
I love this format.
---
I dont play solo because I want to play with friends. tf kinda question is that
---
im guessing person of interest
---
There‚Äôs lots of apps that rip off other games. I don‚Äôt remember the name of it but there was one that was like a ‚Äúmonster battle‚Äù game and it had its own artwork in the store and everything but when you downloaded it it was literally just Pok√©mon, like you had charmander, squirtle, bulbasaur and whatnot lol.
---
I don't know how to feel about the green screen that's still visible in some places
---
"I can proudly say I eat poo"
---
&gt; Dead hard is only useful once
---
It's incredibly handy for closing distance to windows/ pallets even when the killer knows you have it. It's an S tier perk for a reason.
---
You only use it out in the open if you're super desperate, and you're not expected to pull it off there.
---
But yeah the other perks are for practice.
---
THANK YOU! I ENDED UP WITH A 3 KILL AND THE FOURTH ONLY ESCAPED BECAUSE THEY LUCKED OUT AND FOUND A BLOODY KEY AND ABANDONED THEIR FRIEND ON THE HOOK TO GET OUT THE HATCH SO CLEARLY I WAS KEEPING MY GENS UNDER CONTROL BUNCH OF DUMB DUMBS!
---
Im okay with it being mine. üçë
---
Thats fine.
---
I think you‚Äôre way oversimplifying the films by just boiling them down to the traps. Each movie is solid. 7 gets over the top and downright silly at times (as you pointed out with the Bennington scene) but imo delivers a satisfying ending to the series itself.

Added
---
These are good, I feel they'd add something new and exciting
---
My SO hates it more than I do, it wakes her up and she complains that I'm playing that "button mashing" game again lol
---
The Palpatine one is good too
---
1 Nurse ( good at base, OP with range and 3 blinks add-ons ).
---
2 Spirit ( good at base, OP with Anal Beads )
---
3 Hillbilly ( maps can f*ck him ).
---
4 Hag ( OoO + flashlights f*ck her very hard ).
---
5 Huntress ( some maps are unplayable as her ).
---
6 Shape ( he can be looped and gen rushed quite easy ).
---
7 Pig ( add-on rework when ? ).
---
8 Ghost Face ( OoO f*ck him very hard ).
---
9 Wraith ( needs strong add-ons ).
---
10 Legion ( interchangeable with Wraith ).
---
11 Plague ( needs strong add-ons, but she can be interchangeable with Legion and Wraith ).
---
12 Doctor ( needs strong add-ons like air ).
---
13 Cannibal ( at least he can secure 1 kill ... ).
---
14 Clown ( 40+ bugs ).
---
15 Trapper ( needs purple/red add-ons to be mediocre, completely garbage without them ).
---
I am not sure about Freddy yet, I would say around Shape or Huntress or even higher than them, but I might change my mind untill his release and devs might buff/nerf him.
---
Cant tell if its a SWF if you are on reddit upvoting memes until the game starts :)
---
My spirit is P3 and she‚Äôs fun to play cause it‚Äôs a simple ‚Äústand still pretend to phase‚Äù then phase to wherever they go. 
---
She‚Äôs super infuriating to play as survivor unless you have iron will, and even with iron will a good spirit will have good killer sense and can just guess where you are going 
---
I love her and Freddy for being strong but it makes me sad that them being strong is ‚Äúsurvivors having no/wrong information‚Äù but that‚Äôs how this game works. Billy still remains as my favourite high rank killer to face tho
---
‚ÄúOld level of Strength‚Äù
---
lolwat
---
Eh I could make it better if you'd like. Paint.net doesn't get everything with the wand tool
---
some maps have the strangest hatch spawns
---
You can drop em?
---
Weird cause I've gone up against a pig already?
---
Pig desperately needs her add-ons reworked. That and a few tweaks to her stealth/ambush would do her a lot of good
---
You can only buy licensed killers with cells?
---
I think they just reverse it to how it was before. They will stay in the trap, after getting hit, but they‚Äôre in the dying state if they struggle out.
---
That‚Äôs what it sounds like to me
---
You start swf game. After a start killers offering doesn't reveal. Yep, he knows.
---
All you need to know is that you really only need to see the first 2 movies, especially the first. You are permitted to ignore the rest.
---
I don't know how much rank really means for skill level. I'm not very good (just started a few weeks ago, when the 3.0 patch came out) I'm already to rank 9 and only play a few hours a day on the weekend. As long as you're consistently okay and doing gems and a couple rescues, you'll get a pip every round
---
Yeah. That's how its always been. Trapper has many rare bugs so im hoping they just fixed a bug I never encountered. Thank you for not comming on here and calling me stupid.
---
Not sure what you quite said here, but if I am thinking correctly. Yes, you have to use the wraiths perks given to him and get a merciless
---
Fucking perfection xD
---
Decisive Strike? Adrenaline?
---
Holy shit I didn't know they added Dora the Explorer into Dead by Daylight!
---
If you've watched enough gameplay and you're a decent gamer, you should be doing okay by the time you hit your tenth game or so, if not sooner. Start with Claudette so you'll have self care to help
---
it's like anal
---
rough
---
but you'll get used to it
---
Jesus you're dumb XD Thanks for making me chuckle !

And you really don‚Äôt need to thank me for not insulting you :D
---
even if the bonus made you pick up the item instantly it would still save you like less than a second in terms of total match time.

Do you realize devs announced adding in points for surviving certain amounts of time? This is obviously a change made to balance bloodpoints for survivors but the part of adding more events is yet to come

You are being obtuse if you think I was suggesting someone would sit there and play 7 hours of games straight just to farm 2k shards. For a significant portion of players who have bought the game and have no intention of spending more than the base \~20 dollars, shards are their only means of getting new characters, unlocking cosmetics, and unlocking the perks of licensed characters who can't be bought with shards.  
---
I'm not saying 2k shards are worth 7 hours of anyone's time. I'm saying that amassing 2k shards TAKES 7 hours of in game play. If one character is 5 bucks or 9k shards then 2k shards is worth about a $1.25.  
---
The point remains that buying BP is almost an absolute waste of shards.  
---
"Grats on all your maths and numbers" I didn't think your point of contention would be me backing up my argument with actual facts.  
---
My main point still stands: "Anyone trading shards for BP either has everyone and everything already unlocked and then has shards on top of that, or they are effectively wasting 6.5 hours of their own time."

actually, you might think tbose scenese were edited like that for a reason, but it was really because of their low budget making the film.

:(

Sure maybe Jane is viewed by the community as dummy thicc but truly Jeff is ‰πá‰πÇ„ÑíÂ∞∫ÂçÇ „ÑíÂçÑ‰∏®ÂåöÂåö. Plus Jeff has better perks, and is just generally the man.

I dont even use addons on nurse lol. Messes with blinks too much.
---
When no more pools are available, I believe they all reset and the Plague gets Corrupt Purge automatically if I remember right.
---
The pools reset once all are filled.
---
If all the pools are gorrupted, every pool become non-corrupted
---
You are more dense than a bucket of lead dude. I was describing you. I have nothing to admit to. 
---
This was fun, hit me up when you have some more bottled up rage and frustration that you want to take out on a complete strange. Like the next time you just can‚Äôt get that jar of pickles open or when you can‚Äôt quite reach the birthday cake flavored ice cream that your parents put in the back of the freezer, I‚Äôm always hear if you need to vent üôÉ
---
I need them nurse skins
---
Had this same thing happen to me a few days ago.
---
It‚Äôs just really bad luck.
---
Aint that a bitch.
---
Amazing
---
I‚Äôm actually not shit at the game but thanks anyway, and I can name multiple games that are absolutely not pay to win because the only things you can buy with money is cosmetics.
---
Lol wasn‚Äôt dense just saw you wanted to admit you had no argument, thanks for admitting your argument was bunk to start with and that you‚Äôre just bad, have fun trying to climb the ranks with that 0 knowledge of counterplay ;) such a poor argument easily deconstructed and debunked lol
---
Same here ü§¨
---
You have to get a 4k with(i believe) a majority bloodpoints possible earned.
---
Bro that Kate died
---
It would be nice and this has been brought up a few times on here but falls upon deaf ears over at BhVR Interactive. Would like to see a dev post back on this thread but we know that won‚Äôt happen!
---
What's a p3 claudette? Sorry I'm a noob lol
---
Just hanging with the boys
---
What an actual cunt, why would anyone ever do tha- Oh there's a cat so fluffy I love it.
---
This hurts my eyes so bad. It looks like a bad copy of a bad 70‚Äôs aesthetic.
---
Can confirm me and my friends are just like "its too quiet" "bout to prestige which items should i use" " is hag and she has ruin"
---
Derank to rank 15, wait for rank reset, derank to 20. 
---
Lower ranks you are, the more lenient the requirements for a double pip. You can get a 4K with 5 gens left and only safety or single pip because survivors suicided on hook, or you used insta-downs and thus didn't hit enough, chases too long or too short, etc. 
---
Stupid as hell but blame BHVR. Survivors only have to escape to get their adepts so they can sit in a locker, let everyone else, die, grab hatch, "GGEZ BABY KILLER" and get their achievement while you can work your butt off and not get it because of a DC or because of some arbitrary bullshit like a gen got completed too fast since you didn't have ruin to slow the game down just a lil bit, etc.
---
Shhh don‚Äôt spoil the moment
---
Yeah but his name isnt even on this so dont give him free publicity you 4head
---
I usually get 75k playing as Leatherface with wreaths or bloody party streamers/pudding and BBQ.
---
Who cares?
