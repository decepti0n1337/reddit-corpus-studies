Played a match on coal tower w/ Bubba using Infectious Fright. All survivors spawned in one corner, and I ended the match in the first 2 minutes. I don't get why people camp as him lol.
---
---
---
Lol no. Slugging isn't toxic. Teabagging is toxic but if you get offended by it you're just bad
---
Ah, so it only happened against these particular players? Sounds shady, you should report it and include the video link.
---
That happens now even without Insta-heals, those killers are low tier for a reason since they can't catch up in seconds like Nurse or they can't instadown like Billy. If it makes it better, instead of the addon being an insta-heal, Now they have to hit a difficult skill check before it happens and if they miss, oh well so sad no more medkit.
---
Can you put wraith below them rather than behind them please?
---
If you can keep steady downs it works fine with stalling.
---
Nay. This is a brave Claudette. She does not depend on the shadows. She wears a bright pink jacket with pride
---
Is it hard to grind for Ebony moris? I'm leveling my first killer and I get one nearly every level.
---
I’m enjoying pop more than thrilling because it makes me feel strong. The regression is nice too ig lol
---
if this is okay, tea bagging is okay
---
You got a clip of that on twitch? Not saying your wrong, but don’t want to scour over hours and hours of content to find that. Also, I’ll try at somepoint, but homie streams before sunrise and im not about to wakeup that early. Maybe I’ll watch a VOD
---
*looks over list of planned pig nerfs*
---

---
Sorry bud, doesn't look like it's on the schedule
---
If you have Noed on this will be even more satisfying
---
Yeah it's difficult. But it's either vs an m1killer while wounded or vs shotgun huntress. If you can run an m1 killer then I don't agree with cleansing. On certain maps it's not a terrible move though. Like on Lery's. Basically what op said though. Whole team needs to follow through on the decision made.
---
Exactly
---
its just so DS cant be countered by slugging
---
More bulge
---
He gets around 8 million views a month by uploading that much. He only averages 15-20k views a vid I think too
---
Turn around!
---
Agreed. If I’m gonna mori u by the hatch. Then I’m gonna mori u by the hatch. It’s the game it’s A game. People need to calm down lol
---
but i really wanna know tho :(
---
What can I say? I'm an angry Chihuahua- get in my space and I will either pee on something or bite you. Being a lapdog is hard work. 
---
Disengaging now, have a wonderful night and enjoy getting the last word in.
---
People like you will always be salty, no matter how BHVR performs. There's nothing ridiculous about anything I said. You don't magically fix things by bringing in more programmers. Anyone unfamiliar with the way the game's put together would have to spend time learning it so they don't immediately break everything, too. It's not a problem you throw money at until it gets fixed. You also have no idea what their teams are like and how much of a budget there is for each. Speaking like you know how to fix all their problems just makes you look like an idiot.
---
It's pretty clear you've had no interest in a real convo from the start. Your response to the things I said was to call me a boot licker. You're definitely not the type of person I'd ever have any interest in having a discussion with. Enjoy being angry at a game dev for stupid reasons, I guess.
---
Based on your response I can tell for sure it got under your skin. And a silly response as well.
---
Look, I don’t personally care, but be honest with yourself.
---
The way you instantly tried to get on me for mistakingly replying to the wrong person makes me believe my questioning of you bothered you.  
---
It’s fine, but that’s why I said calm yourself.  Don’t be ignorant, you know exactly what I mean when I say that lol.  That’s cool though, you can play it off all you want. 
---
Have a good one.
---
It is, as a killer I don't have a problem with it at all I know what they are doing and it's to piss me off and it doesn't work, is it annoying sure but is it doing anything game breaking or causing my game to suck no.
---
Yeah I get randomly kicked a decent amount on ps4 lately.
---
He doesn't look normal to me hes hunched over, dragging his leg, wielding an axe with messy hair with a psychotic expression
---
Yeah. I feel it isn’t super strong except in large amounts. It was definitely worse back when MoM was strong.
---
It's not, you should give it a try. It's really fun to use against Freddy. My friends and I do it all the time. Unfortunately, they disconnect a lot.
---
I mean, aren’t most perks crutch perks? Adrenaline, Ruin, DS, Borrowed Time, BL, DH, Pop, Bamboozle, Spirit Fury, Endurance, etc. 
---
The only reason I don’t use NOED is because it’s not fun to play against. But saying that you shouldn’t use NOED because it’s a crutch seems a bit hypocritical to me personally, considering 95% of perks that people use at the red ranks are crutches.
---
Thana, Sloppy, 3rd Seal, Tinkerer. The hex is a gamble but Legion can apply it to all 4 survivors so fast
---
No I do not but i think it was sometime last week. I hop in his stream here and there to see if he’s changing. Followed him for more than a year but a year ago he was fun to watch and now it’s dreadful which is sad. But I’ll see if it can find the vod
---
The trapper in this image looks cute, I love it!
---
Appreciate it
---
That’s the thing - you should be regularly committing. Worst case scenario, you lose an hour or two worth of work by not committing, which surely isn’t enough to push back release by multiple days.
---
I never farm as killer unless there was a dc or two.  I don’t get why some of those killers that only farm do it straight away, knowing full well that some people will just try to escape immediately.
---
I find farming games boring, but you are really just coming off as an ass. Farming games are not that common in my experience, just move on and let it go.
---
Gotcha’ can’t argue that!
---
Overall jack doesn't look like a menacing dude
---
I'm done I cannot fathom as a killer how you can't understand how horribly inefficient her approach to the game was.  I play quite a bit of killer too and literally hope to see 4 Self Cares in every lobby because I know how much free gen pressure that is going to equate too and I play gen pressure loadouts as well as heal punish loadouts for this exact thing.  I'm not going to explain to you the stalemate that exists against an intelligent killer that prioritizes gen defense with heal punishment loadouts.  The game is very much in their favor if you play into their playstyle like that.  Instead of a 2K he 100% would have 4k'd everyone if we all played like Nea.  I've ran out of words to communicate this to you.  Throw on Empathy and start playing survivor.  You'll get it over time.
---
Do you have a link to the files? I'd love to print some of these.
---
But noed can turn a 0k into a 4k none of those other perks have that potential.
---
For some reason this reminds me of the cover art of one of the Pig Destroyer albums. Maybe it's the red backround or art style. Very cool though.
---
NOT GETTING FAKKING HALLOWEEN MEMES
---
Your proposed build is actually pretty solid though I'd consider replacing BBQ with Pop, Discordance or Sloppy.  BBQ is still solid too though.  But for someone asking for loadout advice you're already starting off with a pretty nice one for him.
---
That is not the equivalent of teabagging, tebagging doesn’t affect the killers gameplay in any way this on the other hand affects the survivors.
---
I think lightborn is what saved me on that
---
Frank looks daddy af
---
If you don't want to farm then just do gens and leave, or disconnect or something like damn dude they're not holding you at gun point.
---
If you really hate farming then haul your ass to the red ranks, you won't find any friendly killers there.
---
[deleted]
---
Head On is borderline so I looked at the judges and they said they accept it.  Also great fucking play man.  Head On Saves are by far the most satisfying way to save a survivor in the entire game.  Head On &gt; Firecracker &gt; Flashlight &gt; Pallet &gt; Slugged Adrenaline.
---
its rude to pick up the survivor like this, then move them just to kill them with a mori. I wouldn't have minded it if they closed the hatch before they were slugged, but this was just BM
---
Franklin’s Demise ftw
---
Like a damn fiddle
---
He thought you meant that OoO was worthless against Freddy, considering BT is that way against him. 
---
Either way I don't really see an issue. When asleep Freddy has snares/dream pallets to his advantage so mindgames don't really matter against sleeping survivors.
---
Fucking TRUTH. Most of the people in the green and under ranks need the fucking BP to level.
---
I never understand the worship people have for these streamers. They're not even celebrities. And if they are celebrities, they are not your friend.
---
surviors being able to stun the killer within 60 seconds of unhook from only be unhooked is not ok
---
Its once all gens are done. Try bringing in the saw map offering if you can, it's a tougher map sometimes but the hatch will only spawn downstairs not upstairs
---
If you don’t care about BP and want to play properly then just DC if it’s that much of an issue to spend a few minutes doing the gens to leave.
---
they might have meant to not come across you again as a killer (because you gave them a hard time/you were really good) but maybe play with you as a survivor
---
The only way i could see you justifying this type of response is if you are getting farming killers constantly. Which i highly doubt it's a rare occurrence at best and a nice change from the sweaty insta downs and eboy mori killers. 
---
Someone else said it you can either DC or gen rush and leave the game, lecturing someone on being nice is just kinda silly.
---
While I get that, the problem arises when there are only 5 Totem spawns and that the Killer can make use of all 5 of them, meaning either the perk would be useless in those scenarios or another Totem would spawn, making Thrill of the Hunt that much better.
---
And that's not going into the idea that every survivor could run it, so you could end up with 9 totems spawning on the map.
---
I don't worship anyone, nor do I see him as a friend. Hes a content creator that I watch for a maximum of 20 minutes a day.
---
It really is, if the killer picks you up you can escape and it can be countered if they know how the perk works. If you really hate slugging that much run unbreakable there's really no issue it's a a top tier perk nonetheless
---
Is it not worse to close the hatch then do this as well? Isn't that toxic? Because people complain about that being toxic too, everything is toxic apparently.
---
This isn't toxic *in my opinion* if this ruins this game for you then that's on you personally, this game is about killers and survivors in a horror setting.
---
He looks more menacing than some of the killers in game
---
This has happened to me a few times also. Sometimes I’ll loose an item that I picked up in-game too, even if I escaped. It’s a bit frustrating so I just stopped bringing items in until it’s fixed...hopefully.
---
I think you're the blind one and even sound shallow about it to be honest, the person is being nice and you're complaining?
---
 Just do the gens and leave if you dont want to farm lol. It's not your choice how others play the game dude.
---
Help, I don't understand please dont woosh me ;-;
---
The "horror" part of dbd might as well be a side plot honestly. I consider mori'ing on hatch as a dick move, in other words, toxic.

OoO should work against Freddy when the user is in any state, awake or asleep, just like it works against every single other killer.
---
To you yes to me no
---
‘Member when flashlights could literally instantly blind you? Cuz I fuckin’ ‘member
---
Buddy *most* perks have been disappointing
---
Idk what rank you're at, but that almost doesn't happen ever. I've seen very few coordinated teams who can pull off stunts like that and if you can get outrun for THREE GENERATORS ON RUIN it isn't the survivors who are doing good. You're just not doing well. Multitask. Make sure they waste their things BEFORE you let them pop all 5 gens on the second chase. Make sure you have perks that allow you to win the beginning and middle instead of relying on a crutch perk for the end game. And if you're tunneling someone for 3 gens and letting them live, I'm a rank 7 survivor with probably less than 100 hours on all of them combined so I'm barely any good and I'd still know to look for totems if we completed 2 gens. And if they're on comms, they're gonna know how many were taken out and if they aren't, the lack of coordination makes your life easier. If they're the top 5% of survivors who are deadly coordinated, have insanely optimal perks, and can run you like its a park jog, then they earned the win if they get it. They played better. Being a killer main who dabbles in survivor really taught me just how broken survivors will be if you let them be.
---
1. I said most people want to play the game properly; not everyone. However, its a fair criticism if you're trying to say I shouldn't assume that. But you justify the killer doing it by saying they are doing it "to make someones day better". This is the exact blindness and obliviousness i'm talking about; it doesn't make everyone happy (me for instance) and its not right for the killer to assume that it is. See you criticise me for my assumption, but then you made the exact blind assumption that I am criticising here. Open your eyes to the concept that not every survivor wants to farm.
---
2. Farming to complete a daily is so obviously selfish, it's not a defence for farming killers. That would mean killers would decide that nobody is having any fun next game just for their own challenge; its not their place to assume that every survivor wants to farm.
---
3. It's not fair to dismiss my point by saying "just dc" when my time, items and pips are wasted from that, meaning I still am put at a negative because someone decided to farm.
---
While we're at it, which perk should I skip on the docotor? Overwhelming presence or Overcharge?
---
I own Franklin's Demise and I play on Ps4 where skill checks can be a bit more tricky so I guess Overcharge will be good
---
I LOSE MY ACCOUNT WITH ALL DLC OF DEAD BY DAYLIGHT
---
To be fair, if DBD and Deathgarden: Bloodharvest are any indication, balancing *without* letting the Survivors attack the Killer is already pretty hard to do, and it's not something that they've managed to keep well over the years.
---
I mean, it's plenty frustrating when you finally down a Survivor, only to get flashlight blinded, have a pallet dropped on you, and be body blocked, and have the hook in front of you saboed. No real reason to add dying and being stunned to that list.
---
I know, right? Imagine bringing and relying on a perk specifically designed to get hook saves... for hook saves. It's so senseless!
---
/s
---
Its fair if you think i'm over thinking it.
---
Ok that is exactly what I'm saying, closing the hatch then doing the mori is a dick move then. Anything other than letting survivors win is a dick move then as well, what isn't a dick move in this game then?
---
But it is not the killers place to make the assumption that all survivors wanna farm and so they shouldn't make the decisions. They should play the game how it is meant to be played.
---
You mean, outside of 32m? That would be nice but conflicts with the Oblivious status effect the devs added.
---
If you like 3 gen doc or trapper fire up is really good, I recommend freddy
---
I love it so much xD
---
The way hatch works: number of alive survivors+1= how many gens need to be done for hatch to spawn
---
There should be an unwritten rule where if you face the plague, DONT CLEANSE. Honestly her attack when she has the red vomit is kinda broken
---
Mori, no need to be scared lol
---
You said you love him though. 
---
That's what I'm saying. Keep your love and affection for someone that actually deserves it. Your relatives, your best friends etc. Not some stranger that likely won't give a hoot about you.
---
Like him for sure but always keep it on the back of your mind that like most people, their kindness is probably limited to people that they know.
---
Why should I have to waste my time or my items and pips just because some guy assumes the whole lobby wanted to farm?
---
Like a simple child’s toy in a box.
---
Killer is doing their main objective which is killing players...
---
Possibly. You could potentially proc that twice in one chase, but it definitely would be better than now.
---
Rin yamaoka is the spirit's actual name
---
Now Kiss

Looks like Neo

I love his content and personality dude 🤦. Your telling me things that dont need to be said.

He looks blind 😂😂
---
I remember my favorite moment of post game chat, a new baby dwight was talking to the killer
---
(Paraphrase because I have bad memory)
---
Killer: Sorry I was such a jerk, I don’t have any friends for swf
---
Baby Dwight: I sent you a friend request, wanna play?
---
Killer: Sure, accepting right now, thanks
---
*Chat offline: Disconnected from Host*
---
Aren't they supposed to do that?
---
Yeah, that could definitely be a logistics problem. I wonder of you could tie it to anything? I would really like to see some mechanic in place that could allow for a sort of selfish survivor build.
---
Trapper is the most unfun killer to play against. Yes, even more than Spirit or Nurse. All they got to do is herd you to a trap, and if they are competent and placed it in the path of a loop in the grass, they automatically win. Survivors can't see the trap in time in the grass, and if they run around, if the trapper didn't place a trap there, they get hit once. Even if he did, that's a loop shut down. And this repeats for every tile in the game.
---
Looks amazing!
---
meg because quick and quiet, adrenaline are both amazing perks. sprint burst is meh but if ur new to the game its decent
---
The council shall decide your fate
---
That's assuming people are playing lots of game. What if someone hops on for two games? or a game before work. For instance, the game that this occurred was the only game i had time for tonight.
---
also where did I say I lectured someone on being nice?
---
[removed]
---
The power of dead hard is such that it even evades EGC timer if you hit it at the right moment while next to the gates. Hard to pull off, but possible
---
Lmao that's awesome
---
Except bt and ds during end game means they did well enough to survive until endgame and u failed at killing them meaning u didnt do well that round and they did. Now add noed to the mix. Survivors do well and u do bad during the game just like before but now ur bad plays etc are being awarded with free instadowns and kills just bc they didnt cleanse all the totems. Keep in mind its not bc u did well or bc they did bad its all bc they didnt cleanse totems. See how that can be frustrating and seen as undeserved kills.
---
Even when I literally said as much, that the game's coded to be such a mess that they'd be better off writing a new game. And once again, you have no idea how many people are already working on fixing bugs and untangling the code. No excuses are being made here, I'm just stating how it is. If you can't accept that, that's your problem. And I will have a wonderful night :) Hope you do too!
---
WHY DOES THIS GAME HAVE SUCH GARBAGE COMMUNITY MANAGERS
---
**WHY CAN WE NOT EVEN GET A FUCKING 2X BLOODPOINT PITY EVENT**
---
[IT'S FUCKING SCARY GAME SEASON AND THE SCARY GAME IS FAILING US](/intensifies)

everyone who gets to middling-high ranks must have streamer-time and obviously has a million of them
---
Thank you!
---
Fingers crossed for STBFL next week :D 
---
Don't really want to play Myers but I want that perk for Demo.
---
He's dumb. Like his actual intelligence is low. It takes him so long to figure stuff out and he constantly forgets stuff despite however many thousands of hours he's played.
---
It's just so frustrating after a while. Still watch his highlights vids tho.
---
Ya it’s the equivalent of a survivor teabagging at the exit gates. But since you do this I’m sure you don’t mind it when they do that anyway
---
I thought cold wind was the best map for bl. Can someone explain to me how I can abuse bl on Haddon field lerys etc cos I've always been happy to get cold wind but not Haddon field etc
---
&gt; BHVR is not a AAA game studio
---
Bit disingenuous. While we don't have exact numbers given they're not a publicly traded company, we do know that they have about 500 employees, we know from their published works that they do have a serious spot in the industry, and we know from them pumping money into Deathgarden development even after it died the first time that they definitely have money to throw around.
---
No they're not Konami, but they're nothing close to an indie dev or a small studio either. There's really no excuse for game-breaking issues that have been in the game for ages to still exist, especially with the massive playerbase DBD has maintained.
---
Yeah but MoM was a stupidly easy to activate second chance perk.
---
Every Survivor running MoM because it had a really high chance to activate from simply being chased wasn't healthy nor fair for the Killer successfully doing their job. (especially if the Killer had ZERO options to get around it)
---
First thing that comes to mind is that you accidentally used a wrong perk. Just double check and make sure you have the right ones, and only use those three, no fourth perk allowed.
---
Second thing is that you arent in public matches, kill your friends won't work.
---
Finally the only thing I can think of is that you have an outdated steam window open. If you open the achievements list and then unlock an achievement, you have to close the tab and reopen it to see your progress.
---
Edit: Also for survivor achievements you have to escape. Pipping or depippng doesn't matter lkke it does for killer.
---
Did you have them in the right order sometimes it's weird about that. Also can't run a 4th perk if you're running a full build.
---
dae spirit BAD??
---
What have I missed???
---
I just got hide and stab a week ago because it seemed like the perfect Halloween game. So I kind of feel like a kid watching his parents fight. 
---
I'll wait all of this out in a locker. Good day.
---
The order of the perks never matters, but you’re right about not running a 4th perk
---
Is it really his real personality though? Given how disappointed you are after knowing that he could be rude.
---
Let's be honest here, you don't really know him. That's why you are upset when your assumption of his personality is revealed to be wrong.
---
New survivor buff looks great.
---
Once again, someone making the assumption that it is "being nice". This is as 'shallow' of a view as it gets, as it assumes that every survivor wants to farm and that the killer is being nice to everyone (clearly isn't nice to me).
---
Using the logic "its not my choice how others play the game" is ridiculous when it comes to letting the opponent win. It's fine in the context of letting people have their own play styles, however if the way they are playing removes all fun for all parties involved, then i can definitely complain. For example, if I play FIFA and all of a sudden everyone decides to let me win every game then i cant complain because its their choice to ruin my experience and their own?
---
As a killer, its a nice change of pace from having to be sweaty to just shredding through teams with sadistic fun. But that doesnt mean that i’m in favour of it or think its fair
---
Long story short, the hallowed blight update was delayed.
---
Dead hard is even more "stupidly easy to activate second chance perk" and you can use it more than 1 time per match.  But killers seems ok with that.
---
Several? the only somewhat decent perks survivors got were fixated and inner strength
---
Yeah I definitely checked all those boxes + I play on PS. Thanks though
---
 Why should I have to waste my time or my items and pips just because some guy assumes the whole lobby wanted to farm?
---
Oh shit there's an order?! That might just be it thank you thank you good sir
---
How? They definitely don't lol
---
No the hag could have killed her she didn’t need to drop her near the hatch to trick her then Mori her
---
\&gt; BE ME
---
\&gt; TAKE A WEEK OFF JUST IN TIME FOR THE EVENT

\&gt; EVENT GETS DELAYED
---
\&gt; PRESS F
---
Ffs
---
Literally no one cares
---
Seems your pretty set on thinking in this instance the killer was wrong.  Fair enough not your cup of tea. 
---
But in response to your question. 
---
&gt;After a match ended with a farming killer, I told him to "never play killer again" and told him that I reported him. He then couldn't get through his head, despite me explaining it to him that not all players only play the game for bp, and that most want to have a good game. 
---
That my friend is a form of lecturing, without seeing your chat logs i doubt that you're response was a civil on here.  
---
In relation to your statement. 
---
&gt;What if someone hops on for two games? or a game before work. For instance, the game that this occurred was the only game i had time for tonight. 
---
I play very casually on weekends or friday nights to have a couple of games, as stated it is very rare to get a farming killer.  Now of course i don't have exact statistics, but i'm sure if you ran a poll you'd find the numbers skewed to very low levels of farming killers. 
---
The exception to this would be bloodhunts of course now in that instance, i could understand how having multiple games of farming in a row could be boring. 
---
Now if you'll excuse me i'm going to crawl back into bed and pass out from illness.
---
Ruin needs to not be a Hex, but a perk and make it so repairing doesn't pause when missing a skillcheck. Maybe make it regress a little bit more to compensate. That gets rid of the most frustrating parts for both killer and survivor.
---
The Oblivious status effect is what I'm getting at. The perk should only work outside of 32 meters. There's a clear and obvious reason why the perk isn't usually allowed to work at any range with no restriction.
---
These two look ready to fight a horde of survivors
---
I like hybrid
---
But I stopped watching because he hinders himself too damn much lol
---
Like refusing to attack someone he unhooked, even if it’s been a minute and he just happened to stumble upon them again...  like ffs, play the game and stop making silly rules for yourself
---
But to each their own I guess lol
---
But it is not the killers place to assume that everyone in the lobby wants to farm; not everybody is experimenting or playing multiple games a day and such. Not everybody cares about bp either, no player should decide to stop the fun of the match for everyone involved for some progression
---
Ok dude
---
I think this is a *sight* overreaction.
---
It's not the survivors' place to make the assumption that they control how the game should go. It's the killer's game. If they want to farm, so be it.
---
Cant be a halloween event if its not in halloween
---
👌 just do it!
---
it’s probably bc of the stranger things update. i couldn’t get nancy for a week, doctor and david both i had to do three separate times for it to finally register. it’s just a bug with the game currently. if you’re not happy with the survivor or playing them more than once with only their adepts id recommend waiting until the blight update maybe??? it’s definitely a problem i never had before the ST DLC
---
Dude, evertyone can be rude. Can you actually stop? You sound dumb asf thinking I have a professed love for another man that I've never met in my life. Literally the only thing I know about him or his entire life is his name, that's it.
---
Dead Hard is nowhere near as busted or easy to activate as old MoM. Literally just get hit. Dead Hard can be baited, doesn't give a speed boost for being hit, and could be ran with MoM.
---
Then just do gens and leave, geeze dude it aint all about you sometimes.
---
But it's true
---
She didn't drop them by the hatch, survivor crawled toward it, killer picked her up dropped her back a bit to do the mori something killers should do to get in the right position to do a mori, this is normal play nothing toxic
---
That’s why it’s a hex could be there whole game or a minute
---
I think with Dead Hard, there is a good balance. Yes, the perk is easy to activate, but the payoff is also not overly strong. It can give you an out in the chase, but it´s not an instawin and I often managed to either bait it out or even catch up after a survivor using it. Also, it is skill-based, you need to know when/how to activate it, and killers need to know when/how to counter it.
---
Whereas MoM was easy to activate for an arguably stronger payoff, and there was no skill component to it. You didn´t have to time the immunity, you just ignored a hit, and you didn´t need to go out of your way to activate it, you just got hit like you usually do in a game.
---
If I say I'm gonna book a flight to Moscow and go fuck a bunch of cows are you going to take that literally too?
---
It's not supposed to matter, but I've had times I've not gotten when I should have and haven't had that problem since I started putting them in the order you get them.
---
I personally think Ruin gives a bit too much for being basically free (you have to do nothing to activate it or anything). Pop goes the Weasel is similar in regression but needs a lot more to happen (hook, run to gen, kick gen) and thus „feels“ better/fairer if you know what I mean. 
---
I agree on noed as well. It actually rewards you for losing which is terrible game design.
---
Lol when a group of survivors start tbagging your killer friend
---
havent see a good survivor perk since the halloween chapter
---
if anything the change makes slugging not a counter. since you ahve to hook someone before downing the survivor with DS
---
Lol also in that case if they let you win everytime that's the person's choice, you're being shallow thinking you can tell people how to play the game. The killer is the power role and if he wants to farm you can't stop it, just move on instead of trying to argue against it. 99% of people think it's ok or at least understand it and just move on, what's so difficult about that?
---
The fact you would report it is pathetic too dude. If he killed you and farmed with everyone else that would be wrong. Just farming with everyone is him playing how he wants and NOT reportable.
---
Not mad at the devs for that per se just mad about it in general. I do hold bad communication against them though
---
That's not the kind of love I was talking about. I was talking about the 'can do no wrong' kind of love fans give to their favourite... Stars/singers etc.
---
Also you need to not take things personally. I noticed that this is not the first time you got offended when someone responded to you out of malice. Maybe he wasn't intentionally being rude and you only read his response because you are being defensive.
---
It's an opinion wasn't that know from the start
---
No, but I'd say you're being hysterical for no good reason.
---
I love how Jake and Dwight are pretty much just Monto and Puppers and how well it works
---
i notice that this mostly happens if i’m hit within like 5 seconds of escaping the trial. if you have an item escape as quickly as you can, also if the killer DCs (i’ve had a lot of problems with killers getting kicked out of games without intentionally quitting???)
---
devs confirmed Wraith is in a relationship with nurse sadly :/
---
I didn't say it wasn't lecturing but you said I was "lecturing people on being nice". I think you just misread me quoting my teammates telling me that the farming killer was "just being nice". But we're just arguing pointless semantics.
---
Just because the amount of farming killers is low doesn't excuse them. I don't want to farm. ever. It's not any killers place to ever make the decision that the lobby wants to farm. Doing so means that people not wanting to farm have to waste time doing gens and leaving, or lose their items/pips while having already waited 5 mins or so to get into the match.
---
If I had the chance to get 30K+ Points as Survivor for a match then why wouldn't I go along with it?
---
Being boring or not seems irrelevant with how big the grind is especially when you can have regular matches where you get barely anything and it was still boring.
---
What did it do originally?
---
I love playing her. I had a good lengthy match where I received a 4K and got some “GG” from the survivors. Only one sent me a message saying “You literally wouldn't be able to win if it weren't for your OP power and cheap tactics.” It was a well-rounded game..
---
Then why the fuck are you taking me saying "I love Monto" literal?
---
Wack
---
Corrupt Intervention is better.
---
Yeah she’s one of, if not the best killer in the game,
---
It can work both ways. Survivor juke and loop killer all game, getting max chase points. All gens done. Then killer gets them with NOED at the exit gate, and says "gg ez" despite the fact survivors most likely double pipped from getting all those points.
---
Ops, someone didn’t call Microsoft
---
The killer decides what kind of game it is, and survivors respond to it, that's how the game is meant to be played. You can always d/c and reque, survivor wait times are non-existant. The worst that happens is someone reports you and BHVR does nothing about it lol
---
How is it the killers game? Because they are the host? You think that they wont do it when dedicated servers are out?
---
Using your logic, I should be able to throw your ranked games on any game. If its not your place to control how the game should go, then you are in no place to complain, right? That's ridiculous.
---
I think the dedication goes to whoever put the time into making this image so  unreadable, good job
---
I've told you I didn't see it as literal love. I see it as you thought he's a good person for no good reason just because he's your fave content creator even though you don't know him.
---
*LAUGHS IN PALPATINES EVIL SITH VOICE*
---
Where's Nea?
---
Cool, can we have the event now?
---
I literally thought this was a screenshot lol. Nice huntress!
---
Killer Ideas: 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Monika from Doki Doki Literature club- I want to see someone who looks beautiful and cute being intimidating. She will look like an ordinary girl when she is not moving but she looks glitchy and distortedly out of place once she starts walking. Since she have reality warping powers, she can have abilities like distorting the appearance of the progress bar of generators,totems and hooks. Hooks are replaced with Noose on her level as a tribute to Sayori's death. She can also summon a Psychopathic AI Yuri stabbing herself on your front to body block you.  Yuri will dissintigrate with pallette attacks and headon.
---
I had seen perk ideas of her before. Monika will have a slow walking speed but she will have projectiles like glitches. When she attacks survivors, it looks like they are disintegrating.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b5dhn0/dead\_by\_daylight\_the\_doki\_doki\_chapter\_fan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b5dhn0/dead_by_daylight_the_doki_doki_chapter_fan/)
---
Carrie White- Her stage will be the burning gym of her school prom.  Any stage will be burning and filled with debris if she is the killer. She can use telekinetic attacks with glass shards, stone debris and fire as her weapons. She can also use her telekinesis to choke her targets.  Chris Haggersen will be her Survivor. So for the first time we have a pairing of an Evil Survivor and a killer she created.
---
Dracula- He is public domain so  Behavior can have all the freedom in the world to portray him the way they want to.
---
Lipstick face demon from Insidious- He is one of the scariest modern horror demons I had seen.
---
The people arguing with you are probably guilty of many disconnects and are just trying to defend their toxic brethren.
---
I remember when Pig was first released, Dead Hard was able to dodge the killzone of the trap at the exit gate, so you were able to run out the gate with a ticking RBT on your head.
---
I think the perk is literally coded to just make you 100% invincible for that split second.
---
Playing fair isn't a dick move. I prefer to give people a chance to win, cause I don't want to get tunneled straight away and have a 3 minute game with 5k BP. If you start running BL loops on Haddonfield or running it on the Harvesters, you are asking for me to be an asshole.
---
This hag was at 4 gens with ruin still up, likely at low ranks due to their perks. They didn't need to BM on the hatch like that, they could have closed it then killed the surv, but they didn't.
---
It is not the killers place to decide that the whole lobby should turn into a farming game. They can't know if the people involved want to do it. Some people don't care about bp (like me) so it is not a defence to say that the game is too grindy. Holy shit this is so obvious
---
“Quack and quiet” LMAOOOO Nah I need perk descriptions!
---
If I thought he was a good person I would've said I thought he was a good person...
---
Fair enough lol. I like tremors more personally because info and shit
---
Well, you are the only one resorting to swear words so I'd say that you do take things personally.
---
You just admitted to reddit that you were surprised to know that he can be rude. But you claim that you knew he can be in the wrong?
---
The moment of realization when I recognized you as the original creator lol.
---
Yeah and Im giving mine..
---
tinkerer though? could you explain that?
---
This will be even more perfect when bare bum myers skin comes out.
---
3 basic attacks let you ignore a hit. So it hurt all the worst killers while not doing anything against the best ones since it was bugged where Nurse hits didn't stack it. This ignored hit still gave the speed boost as well.
---
Perfect comment, the thread is closed pretty much.
---
Yeah and I gave my opinion and defended it...
---
Things don't have to be said for meaning to take effect. For example, his words to you were taken negatively by you even though to others they look benign and not rude.
---
Good luck sir
---
Legion.
---
So whats the problem..
---
Then the people that don't want to farm, lose the 5 mins it takes to find and load into game then the 5 mins to leave. How the fuck does what i'm saying make it all about me. The killers assuming that it is their place to decide whether the whole lobby wants to farm is making it all about them. Holy shit this is so obvious its ridiculous.
---
True! I feel BBQ and Whispers is enough for me, but I’m more aggressive and manic.
---
I'm going to be honest: McCote has the worst fucking PR skills I've ever seen. There's so many things the man says that just accidentally come off as condescending or rude without any intention. He seems to try his best to be nice, civil, and funny but more often than not it feels like he's either trying too hard or not trying enough.
---
At risk of sounding racist: his thick French accent doesn't help. A French accent always makes you sound like a dick.
---
Exactly, you dont work on a game the day before it comes out, you have that shit ready atleast a week in advance for an update. The power outage didnt happen 2 weeks ago. Edit: yea i know the outage happened a week ago but still, this is a major event and they didnt have it ready a week ago?
---
You looped her for minutes. Teammates couldn't finish any gens in that long?
---
Yeah, might replace it with sloppy or even nurses because when you face a legion (most of the time) the survivors will be healing a lot so you could interrupt their heals and make them super scared
---

---
Monto has a dickish side to him but tbf...everyone does lol
---
She's also a lot of fun right now considering how many people are using up their instaheals.
---
*GRINDED a total of 5 blood webs for it*
---
Well worry not, the knife has long since been taken away and put in a box till Halloween
---
please explain how reporting a guy for breaking the rules, and wasting my time is a scumbag move.
---
That’s the thing no one even got hooked it was the first 30 seconds and I hit 2 people and then 3 people dc.
---
Tombstone is best with J Myers Memorial, Tombstone and Tuft of Hair rarely activates
---
it isn't p2. i have mask and no trapper prestige
---
I mean, as long as he’s not going tier 3 on you guys you should be good. But Halloween is my favorite holiday. You got some nice feet tho. No homo
---
&gt;I prefer to give people a chance to win
---
And how do you know OP didn't? How do you know the survivors got outplayed and that's just it? Even good gamers get games where you get slaughtered and don't do any Gens at all doesn't mean they aren't playing fair at all
---
And that's your personal opinion and choice and it doesn't mean picking up and doing a mori isn't toxic as is this situation at all nor does it mean you're toxic either, both aren't toxic
---
The Marshall Coat, the Valdez Vest, Leather Gloves, Cuffed Town Pants, and Burnham Boots.
---
The mask is the default swine mask that's currently available for the mini event of Halloween
---
Why would it only happen against those specific players, two games in a row, out of all of the plague games I've played?
---
Every meme post apparently needs the "it works both ways" comment.
---
It is fair if you think I should not overthink it and move on. However, it is a reportable offence, if you need me to get the report descriptions, I can.
---
Have you really not heard people say they love something? "I love this song" "I love this comedian he/shes great". I'm sure that's what they meant. People say love for stuff like that all the time it's not the same as the love for their family and friends.
---
Look I’m down for a duck as the killer but it has to the “AFFLEC” Duck... i wanna see him Mori someone with a high premium...
---
Half of a foot. Unfortunately that costumes like 2 sizes too big. Won’t stop me though
---
Yeah :/
---
A lot faster  than i thought he could go
---
If the killer wants to farm.
---
And three survivors want to farm.
---
And one person doesn't.
---
Who is being selfish? Who is trying to dictate how the game is played in this scenario?
---
**-SNAP!-**
---
*F U C K*
---
Give me a break im lazy!
---
It's accurate
---
My point was that you're like really invested in this guy, making an entire thread about him, and then when anyone offers a counter point you type like a paragraph or two response on why its not really like that. It seems strange to me is all.
---
The way he hopped off the gen after missing a skill check with no ruin I can tell he just doing what he seen the steamers do 😭
---
I'm literally staring at a BHVR employee saying they don't ban for farming as long as it's not malicious. They don't necessarily like or condone it, but they're not going to punish for it. 
---
Unless it's one of the scenarios I already described:
---
* AFK farming killer bot
---
* Bullying/farming at the sole expense of another survivor
---
If your only argument are the insanely outdated report descriptions in game, then I don't know what to tell you other than let it go, your reports aren't doing anything other than making some poor intern drink a little bit more after their shift.
---
Were they the same characters?
---
And some people aren’t Devotion 8 with all characters P3-50 too. Filthy plebs./s
---
You must be clinical insane or mentally disabled which is giving me conflicting feelings about telling you how fucking stupid that comment was.
---
Thats not even a whoosh.
---
Absolutely fantastic! Loving the scenery as well.
---
He's just trying to make the game fun. I also try to make it fun.
---
Just voicing my opinion, pretty normal thing imo.
---
*sad oink*
---
Everyone thinks i'm pathetic is a reason for me to stop? So if the majority disagree then I shouldn't have an opinion? Or is it just a childish jab at me?
---
If they want me to report killers for picking favourites, then tunneling would be reportable, sooo...
---
WHAT BUILD IS THIS ?
---
Only for campers, especially basement campers, especially Leatherface. Though I did just see someone do something funny with it on Legion the other day where they'll stand still to force a survivor to sit and mend nearby so they could try to down them faster. Don't remember who it was though, probably Monto since it wasn't just that perk but a whole terror radius build and that's the kind of stuff he's known for.
---
Thanks it was in a big city location and our photographer tried their best to hide that!
---
99% of my plague games I forget corrupt purge exists and my survivors end up with like 2 available fountains on the entire map lol
---
Laurie should be in wins or wins but dies. Have you seen how armed to the teeth she was in most timelines?
---
I can get that. But I also don’t like hindering myself.  It’s not fun for me to let them get away free even if they make a super bad play that places them in front of me again lol
---
I like to kill survivors and I also like the survive or save someone and have them survive. 
---
It just bothers me if he’s trying to do well with a build or something, but doesn’t even try to truly win.
---
I do enjoy tru3 for that reason, he always puts in his best effort
---
They said thanks!
---
Is the huntress missing an arm or am I blind
---
In truth dude would’ve been able to wiggle off most likely if there wasn’t a hook 3ft away cuz she dropped him
---
Was it all at the same time or a domino effect
---
Cry about it.
---
I didn’t even notice you were wearing the workman’s overalls. I just thought you were wearing pajamas ngl
---
Lolol never realized that, its hiding in the grass
---
No idea who this is but great cosplay! Spot on.
---
You’re totally right. DD is making its first appearance. I’d say you should buy it while it isn’t fixed.
---
I'm taking you to court, be ready to spend 50 years in meme jail. &lt;3
---
The game being grindy is not a defence. Even the people against me on this post will tell you that. It is ridiculous. Just because u dont start with all advantages to survivors doesn't mean the fun should be ruined for the whole lobby because the killer decided so xdd
---
Knife
---
Have em reset everything platform router modem.
---
If prob continues it's prob isp or server issues
---
Any fan made chapter ideas?
---
It’s certainly not making me invincible for that half a second when I use it on dedicated servers
---
Because they farm they have no life? Ok then.
---
Yeh it is a report under the in game descriptions, however someone has told me here that they are outdated.
---
Yes, yes  it does.
---
Every rank reset feels different, but the one consistent thing I've noticed is that it takes more than two weeks for things to get back to normal... and then we have the week before rank reset where you run into people who have decided they need to get the highest rank possible before reset.
---
They literally said they dont condone it. smh
---
The thing is if you're against a huntress and you're in the open you're at a disadvantage but you can still juke your way out if you guess correctly, plague just sprays and prays and theres no juking that, besides when windows and pallets exists its easier getting 2 guaranteed vomit sprays than 1 basic attack
---
No way! lmao I wouldn't have expected dollar tree to supply with aerosol reeking masks. I get more legitimate masks are very pricy, but it's for the quality. I once got an '18 Myers mask too from a Facebook site regrettably, and it's like this one, but 10x worse. I finally got an official '18 mask and wow...what a dang difference.
---
Condone is not the same as saying to report it. Lol stop trying to twist words while you're at it. Smh.
---
All the survivor mains getting rowdy in the comments but to be honest I found it quite enjoyable
---
Its just you seem VERY pro this guy even when others bring up things they don't like you're defending him. I found a few videos where he's calling survivors toxic when they aren't teabagging or doing anything. I don't even hate the guy but it just seems strange. I guess you're just a big fan of his and hate to see people dislike him.
---
That aerosol is no joke. I didn’t realize it before hand and I put it on, the smell hit like a truck
---
holy shit you are reaching. Re-read what you just said. You gonna argue the connotations of not condoning something or what?
---
i agree
---
Yeah, they updated what was reportable ages ago on the forum and that's what I pay attention to, but I also thought it quite likely that they did have listed somewhere as reportable because BHVR has been known to make mistakes before. As far as I know this is the best [updated list](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system).
---
That was before Endgame Collapse
---
stopping all fun of the game to get some bp in dbd yeh, lol. U gotta be pretty sad
---
FINALLY, A WORTHY SHITPOST
---
OUT SHITPOST WILL BE LEGENDARY
---
Until you pointed that out I was very confused
---
If anyone were to take me to court, I'd want it to be Otz &lt;3
---
I have an opinion, yeah. Why are ya messaging me and not the others down talking him? Theres plenty of other people writing paragraphs on the opposite end lol
---
I get what your saying and I agree but don’t underestimate dead hard
---
WHAT ON EARTH IS THIS MATCHMAKING.
---
I QUIT THIS GAME FOR A LONG TIME. A REALLY LONG TIME. LIKE, OVER A YEAR. I CAME BACK RECENTLY, I'M INTO IT. BUT I'M RANK 20 AGAIN. I KNOW NOTHING ANYMORE. MY FAVORITE CHARACTER (SUSIE) IS REALLY REALLY BAD NOW, BUT I STILL WANNA PLAY HER.
---
BUT THIS MATCHMAKING. FUCK. I MADE IT TO RANK 19. I SPEND GAMES AFTER GAMES GETTING LOOPED ENDLESSLY, AND WHAT DO I FIND? RANK 8S. RANK 11S. THE HIGHEST I EVER FUCKING GOT EVEN BEFORE I QUIT WAS 14 AND THAT WAS A LONG TIME GO. I EVEN RAN INTO A PAIR OF DOUBLE RANK 2'S WITH 2 RANK 13'S. I'M RANK 19 STILL.
---
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS.
---
He nailed the stereotypical video game character "looking around for no reason" moves. That's a nice cosplay!
---
Name checks out
---
Dude they dont CONDONE farming, they also made it very clear they dont give any trouble for it cause it's also not a big deal. You're trying to convince me that you're in the right to report something they dont care about. Am I missing something or are you really that dense?
---
What I'm saying is that people call that being sweaty.
---
It dont increase vault speed lol
---
I guess :/
---
But I don’t see why lol. He’s just playing the game effectively
---
Yes; the killer can do what they want. now i'm saying what isn't right to do as a killer.
---
Also how do four survivors farm when the killer doesn't want to. Unless you mean when they farm each other like unhooking them next to the killer for bp
---
Lithe has always been and will always be my favorite. I've tried all those others from BL up to Dead Hard and Adrenaline but none of them compare to me. Part of it could be that I started playing the game as Feng Min so I just got used to using it with her and now know how to do chases better with it.
---
When I play killer, my lunges are very long, like even from my perspective survivor is already over the window and I still get to hit them, same with pallets, they drop it and I still get hit on them and then get stunned. If I start my lunge early, where it shouldnt even reach somehow it connects.
---
Yea they had 4 gens left and I had ruin. Maybe if the whole team wasn’t trolling me I wouldn’t have been a dick. I also got hate mail from the whole team for doin this when I literally got flashlights and teabagged the whole time. In the end I still won clearly but the survivor got what they gave you be an ass to me I’ll be one to you 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
I didn’t tunnel I didn’t face camp I don’t do that cus I play both sides I don’t main one over the other. I teabag as survivor and troll I mori and troll as killer 😭 it don’t matter to me. But in this instance that player deserved exactly what I did 🤷🏽‍♂️ and I didn’t close the hatch cus I wanted her to feel like she had a chance as I proceed to eat her insides 👌🏼💪🏼
---
Oh. But occasionally I still experience the bug where I’m looking dead at him and the reveal timer won’t kick in until a few seconds later. Those few seconds can do a lot lol.
---
i dont blame them for defending them. Big twitch controversial streamers have there whole chat sucking them off constantly, I would say Hexy fans are much worse and hexy is just worse in general.
---
If he's wearing the dress Myers skin this will be perfect
---
I hate that argument of how the game is meant to be played. People find enjoyment out of different things. I don’t personally like farming killers either but it’s just one match out of a couple dozen that I even get a farming killer. Just finish the match and move on
---
Tell him to just stay for the entire match....... lol
---
I have plenty *goes through filing cabnets of ideas for DBD chapter ideas*
---
Follow up edit: could work for my stealth killer the wendigo, could be terrifying to hear this play as you see this scary as he'll monster crawling on the wall to get to you.
---
That’s true that the game would still continue for a few seconds and I do think he dc himself, but there are bugs were players just instantly dc with no warning. It’s constantly happening to me on dedicated servers. I’ll be mid chase, no lag or anything and then suddenly staring at the loading screen while the game continues for my swf
---
It's pretty much a troll perk, honestly.
---
The report is not even the point of the post. i cba for arguing something that doesn't even effect the main point being that farming is selfish and bad for the game.
---
Man you speaking the truth
---
all 4 survivors aren’t burning salty lips? yikes
---
Overcharch I have had postive results with as well
---
Weird, I've been playing a bunch of killer and most of my window hits felt normal. It's normal to hit someone after a medium vault because the hitbox on those are so wonky, but if you're hitting people after they land and start to walk away from a fast vault, then there's a problem. 
---
Hitting someone through a pallet is a lot more iffy though. It's definitely been happening more since servers. I've experienced it and my friends have as well. It's honestly hard to tell what's "normal" and what isn't anymore.
---
If you can't even stick behind your post and leave it up, I have no reason to continue having a conversation with you. You wasted way more of your night whining about a farming game than you should have lmao.
---
&gt; as a killer who stays till the end of every match
---
You don't say?
---
It’s more of an aircraft carrier at this point.
---
but when there are two new survivors and 4 of the 6 new perks are trash that's not exactly very good
---
I swear anytime I bring a med kit or healing perks I face a plague. That's really the main frustration with her for me
---
Xbox
---
Just run Corrupt Intervention with either Pop or Dying Light or all 3. Plenty of perk diversity right there...
---
It it hard to pickup the context of the match when you don't show any other gameplay other than you Bming on hatch.
---
and please, don't use emojis if you want to be taken seriously.
---
PC,  XBox, or PS?
---
It was said in a curt manor because by re-reading even the perk name, no description, suggests when that perk is active/useful. He plays dbd for a living, I'd be annoyed if someone said "shoulda done that" about something that doesn't make sense. Lucky to even get a comment tbh lol
---
That's amazing!  Is black scratch your normal medium?
---
I have one it could kinda work for named the lost. Basically a killer who can possess and shapeshift into objects around the map.
---
Oof, that must have been rough for them. Huntress is already iffy sometimes on 50-60 ping (which is what I get). You didn't feel any weirdness or delays? A lot of people say killer's almost unplayable on yellow/100+ ping.
---
Feel like it would belong to a new killer. Probably something from South America, maybe La Madremonte?
---
Teachable’s keep appearing until you buy them
---
Just in time for the Halloween even.. nvm
---
You like horror movies?  
---
Name every horror movie then. /s
---
they arent trash, Deja Vu is trash, they just arent strong. and over time the meta might change and balances and changes might come where those perks come into the spotlight, but the devs cant design 100 perks to all be uber useful or they would all just be progression speed and running speed buffs with survival and stealth perks mixed in. basically 10 or 15 different perks.
---
&gt;The game being grindy is not a defence. Even the people against me on this post will tell you that.
---
The game is built around it, undeniable fact.
---
The game being grindy is a valid defense and you can't just deny it because "Some people don't care about bp (like me) so it is not a defence to say that the game is too grindy."
---
&gt;Just because u dont start with all advantages to survivors doesn't mean the fun should be ruined for the whole lobby because the killer decided so xdd
---
Everyone has a different form of what they find fun, don't assume all 4 Survivors immediately are against farming.
---
Don't like something in a match? then open the menu and hit the big "leave match" button because it's there for a reason.
---
yup.. as long as he is following me, it makes my job easier.
---
1. he is not working on the gens
---
2. he is close and i know where he is
---
so when the time comes i'll humor him. until then, i'm more than happy if he follow me around and try to provoke me.
---
usually they are the one getting triggered instead and become really salty in the endgame chat.
---
No, that's not how you're supposed to play the game!
---
no 4 survivors initiate a farm and dont play propoerly, as in run, hide etc, if the killer doesnt want to they either have to farm or just slaughter them, both of which arent very exciting. Youre sounding like a survivor main dude, try playing both sides.
---
ALL ACCORDING TO PLAN
---
Once you reach level 40 with a killer you will have had the ability to unlock their teachables. From thereon you will be able to unlock all base killer perks. To unlock other killer specific perks you will need to level them to to 30/35/40 respectively. Their perks then should be able to appear in your bloodweb.
---
Tips: shrine of secrets is you shrewd friend. Killers you are not interested in playing you can try and power level. By: trying to manipulate the bloodweb to buy only greys and yellows mostly. You can also skip leveling perks as well as teachables (except reds) to conserve your bloodpoints. It's a long grind pray for double bloodpoint events.
---
Im good, thanks.
---
For every M1 you do on Billy you add unnecessary time to a chase. Obviously there’s some fringe scenarios where you have to M1 but this wasn’t one of them. He SHOULD have just canceled his chainsaw the second you ran off with balanced, and chased you til it ran out then try to saw you again.  If he did M1 there he would have stacked another speed boost on top of the one you already have from balanced , you would zoom off like sonic the hedgehog with the double speed boost and that would make the chase longer than it needed to be and the pallet you made it to outside the building wasn’t a safe pallet, if he followed you outside and tried to saw you there he’d be in a pretty good spot to do so. But that’s just my opinion lol
---
"die fred"? the exposed shoulder? this is so emotional. im nominating this piece for the national art registry
---
How is Open Handed good? Legit question because I never see it and doesn't seem that good.
---
Being rude isn't synonymous with insulting. You never attempted to stay on topic. I ask why should I play Identity V and you never responded. I say perk balance is bad because no one uses the majority of the perks and you never responded. You just concluded I am illogical and controlled by anger. Your first comment was smart ass, condescending, and rude imo. I might be an asshole, but you're an asshole on a high horse. If you can't understand that you lack self-awareness "and I hope that you learn from your ways because you're already burning bridges with your friends...and you're gonna burn a whole lot more." It's too bad you'll never read this to see how condescending that sounds.
---
I know but i'm just saying I don't think it's fair to say they don't use github or some backup system. No need to be condescending.
---
desu.
---
Compared to other people I’ve seen:
---
You did good. You didn’t go into a rant featuring homophobia and racism. You get a gold star on the fridge
---
Thank you I love it
---
I love a good “kill em with kindness”.
---
Lol I don’t need my whole game up here to get my
---
Point across. I used a mori on the hatch. It’s not toxic it’s the game. And emojis lit 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️ idrc if u take it seriously or not
---
Neat.
---
when you get daddy's approval &lt;3
---
That’s awesome
---
I've experienced this. I submitted a ticket on the DBD website, and they accused me of lying.
---
I suggest just taking the loss, BHVR doesn't give a shit.
---
You sound like an overly sensitive little girl. Wahh someone was rude to me online wahh. Actual crybaby. Grow some balls you chicken shit. I can't imagine what you're like IRL if something so meaningleas hurt your precious little feelings on the internet. Lmfao xD
---
Why would freedy stutter?
---
He is great with comebacks and jokes.
---
It makes them confused and flustered, which, in turn, will make them leave you alone for there is no comeback to kind words that don't make you loom like an ass.
---
Well I am, mildly...
---
Who said they hurt my feelings 😂?
---
They said unforeseen circumstances, not a power outage. If they had a power outage fine, but you better link proof considering the devs said "unforeseen circumstances"
---
Surge does more than that, it has an 8 percent regression penalty ON TOP OF, the normal generator explosion penalty, 7 seconds? Not at all. It's an 18 percent regression plus the after explosion effect that doesnt let progress happen.
---
&gt;Its once all gens are done. Try bringing in the saw map offering if you can, it's a tougher map sometimes but the hatch will only spawn downstairs not upstairs
---
Preschool is also a good choice because 8 out of 10 matches, hatch will spawn by the boiler room.
---
Maybe DBD is the only game they play? Why are you being such a condescending asshole?
---
&gt;havent see a good survivor perk since the halloween chapter
---
Inner Strength is amazing.
---
It's not the same for survivor perks, you only make up 1/4 of your team, even if you do a full meme build that's the killer equivalent of using up one perk slot for a meme perk, but yeah, I agree in general that there are too many garbage perks on both sides
---
I love killing them with kindness when I get salt like that. I'll even give proper advice and stuff. It either gets them even more made to where they just lose it at you. Or they calm down and you can actually have a decent conversation with them. Either way I think it's a win.
---
I’m very intrigued- got footage?
---
To turn around and make sure they can do the mori... Like you're making this out to be something it's not honestly
---
&gt;Noed applies Survivors with the Exposed Status Effect. The Exposed Status Effect is only applied with a Killers basic attack.
---
Unless they fixed it this patch, it always worked on Chainsaws. Some people always played a meme build with Speed Limiter + NOED.
---
Please tell me you got an idea for the power. Also, you could have a Steve gank squad now
---
Because he used

I pretty much felt nothing, the only outlier was breaking pallets, the debris from the break just stayed there a little bit longer but I could walk through it before the debris from the break dropped, if that made sense. All of them looked normal akin to how the actual hitboxes work. 
---
This was within one of the earlier tests a couple weeks ago now though FYI, and my normal ping on my servers is 30, where I've felt the game to be pretty much the same apart from pallet breaking that is iffy when on low ping.
---
It does seem that the higher the ping goes the more the game breaks, sorta like how the Fallout and Elder Scrolls games break above 60 fps xD
---
Ignore the random 'a' xD
---
Yeah veey very tough
---
Are you trying to defend the cooldown?
---
GOD I REALLY LIKE IT WHEN THE PIG TBAG ME THO. THE SLOW TBAG IS JUST TOO CUTE
---
I love when myers headbangs
---
F for the man on the hook
---
Thats alright, its often disregarded because it requires synergy, but its synergies limits are often underestimated.  
---
Open handed extends the range of ALL auras, even on broken keys and maps, and for all your teams perks too, and their keys and maps. Its good if you figure out a build solo but its colossal in SWF, find any hatch, any hex, any other survivor and the killer in any spot using say, kindred? yep kindred, if someone has kindred and another has open handed you can see the killers aura at 24m from the hook is which some killers entire terror radius, and you see their direction.  
---
On keys people can use it to instantly find the hatch on the map basically,  scan half the map and if no hatch scan the other half and there it is. Or keys with the killers aura readin add on, no more mind games from the killer in loops.  
---
Its not a top tier perk on its face, but used right it is. remember, in dbd there are 2 critical resources to success, time and information.

yes but the killer is pretty new. she didnt look down/up the first time and the second pick up made no effort to evade the flashlight either.

the true window for flashlights is probably a couple frames only so its incredibly easy to evade if youre not brand new

Just let the killers have fun please. If you die to them it's your own fault.

JUST FINISHED A MATCH EASILY WORTH 100K BP, AS I HAD BURNED A BPS, BUT NO. NETWORK CONNECTION REQUIRED ***RIGHT*** AS THE MATCH CLOSES AND I GET TO THE STAT SCREEN. HMM, ODD HOW I AM STILL ONLINE, I WAS STILL IN A WORKING PARTY, THAT MY INTERNET DID NOT TURN OFF AT ALL, NOR DOES THIS HAPPEN ON ANY OTHER GAME I PLAY. THIS IS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING CONSIDERING THAT YOU LOSE YOUR ADD-ONS AND OFFERINGS, XP FOR THE MATCH, AND ALL THOSE PRECIOUS BLOODPOINTS YOU EARNED. JUST REALLY MAKES MY BLOOD BOIL AFTER A FUN AND CHALLENGING MATCH JUST TO GET SLAPPED IN THE FACE WITH A "YEA NO BLOODPOINTS FOR YOU, CLEARLY YOU AREN'T CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET DESPITE YOU JUST BEING IN A MATCH MERE SECONDS BEFORE WE GAVE YOU THIS ERROR RIGHT BEFORE THE MATCH COMPLETION SCREEN."
---
Let me know what y'all think, I do plan on doing this for killer perks aswell
---
He flexing on the other killers with D O M I N A N C E

You can go to the second floor of any house and jump off, and your perk will come in use. Even if you are exhausted, the reduced stagger helps you relocate. If you don't have it, if you jump off the house you get hit because you can't recover in time to relocate, and it's much easier to use the houses to relocate instead of running around on the ground.

Unfortunately, I have no idea what his powers would be

What the hell is going on?
---
Ghostface can stalk 40 meters away but survivors must be within 32 meters to reveal him.
---
Everyone complains about breaking him out of stealth but maybe you should just break los before trying to reveal him, idk, I have literally never had any problems revealing him unless he breaks los, so I'm at a loss as to what people are talking about.
---
I HAVENT HAD INTERNET IN A WEEK AND IM HAVING DBD WITHDRAWLS 
---
BUT AT LEAST IM NOT MISSING THE EVENT
---
*Pulls out Iridescent Axe Head and Ivory Mori*
---
Being able to instakill anyone on the map is pretty damn strong given that he can already instantly down and you will have zero idea he has it till he uses it.
---
I'd say if Instaheals are OP than instadowns are also OP, given Clown, Huntress and Myers have them specifically, Myers just gets to skip to the kill over having to hook.
---
Hope you’re feeling better
---
Spawn Mobs
---
It's not.  It's RNG but it's not like a fucking achievement.

Also they are def annoying bare minimum so you using them makes you an asshole, kinda like how using instaheals ALSO made you an asshole.

Dude, we need to slow that video down.......Just a little bit

Maybe his power would be something like you seeing illusions of him or his eyes will blind you or something im not sure. this would be hella cool tho lmao
---
I’m glad you never have any issue ever and have perfect games. Doesn’t mean those that do have issues don’t have a right to be annoyed. I am aware of the mechanics but I already stated that it’s inconsistent and buggy. 
---
And the advice to “just run away” is ridiculous. It’s an instant down ability that is supposed to have a counter for balance. The counter being broken is unacceptable and unfair. It’s there for a reason.
---
It looks awesome! Nice job !
---
I don't think you get perks idk
---
tombstone slows him and by the time he reaches t3. All or 4 gens are done. Its a meme addon

It put me in the match as my Bubba with my full perk kit

BIG F

No, that’s dependent on the situation.
---
The splinter says you don't, though
---
Sounds accurate
---
Survivor: "I'll survive with you!"
---
Trapper: [immediately turns into a survivor]
---
P3 Rank 1 God Nurse: [kills all of them]
---
P3 Rank 1 God Nurse: "lmao get bodied"
---
I mean honestly that's a rash head-canon lol
---
Pfft rad*
---
The sad truth is that Ruin is balanced around being a Hex Perk. Meaning that it is officially allowed to be more impactful than perks that are consistently active and even some that have cooldowns and/or restrictions.
---
However, other stalling method's simply requiere too much synergies in order to work efficiently. That is the very issue when it comes to stalling elements. Freddy can become absolutely disgusting but only once you almost dedicate your entire loadout to these stalling features. 
---
Regardless of what kind of stall you attempt to go for, aslong as it doesn't come up to Ruin, you are forced to dedicate several perks and / or even Add-Ons to it. May it be Sloppy / Caulro / Distressing, Overcharge which requieres Unnerving Presence and Distressing, or underwhelming stalling features like the Snap Out Of It and Piggies RBT.
---
This is the very reason why Billy and Spirit are that good after all. They have lethality AND mobillity, and in addition also pressure, by default. Nurse doesn't just obviously break the rules but is also a beast thanks to her insane non-conditional mobillity. These 3 are just absurdely time efficient in comparasion to everything else. Even when Spirit and Nurse (atleast now) requiere a decent amount of knowledge to be played effectively.
---
Another prime example is the popularity of Pop Goes The Weasel. It rewards the Killers for something they'd do anyway. The stalling amount it provides is pretty decent while it also doesn't need any requierements to work properly, impactful or consistent. The very same goes for Nurse's Calling. Survivors will always attempt to heal each other or themselves, making it absurdely consistent but also impactful because Aura Reading in general is pretty strong, but even more so on a Killer in pretty close range. 
---
And before Pop was actually buffed, which removed the enforcement of heading for some gen kickin' immediately, Sloppy Butcher was (and is) also still pretty good. Having the blood tracks is neat, but the fact that you "gain" 4 seconds from a Survivor everytime they have to heal stacks up pretty. Besides of the fact that the Haemorrhage can be quite handy when being on rather grassy maps. So Sloppy is consistent and rewards you for something you'd do anyway, smacking Survivors. So it also kind of belong in the same category, even when the stall provided by the perk doesn't always blossom thanks to non M1 Killers that may find themselfes in the situation where using the abillity is more efficient than applying the debuff.
---
But yeah, Ruin is just like that but in a bigger frame. Impactful, consistent and most importantly independent in terms of synergies, something almost everything else that is capable of providing stall simply lacks.
---
You look weird but welcome to Minecraft, here’s a shovel start digging
---
How hard is it to not be a prick 😂
---
no problem I'm a ghostface main and I commonly see some people making fundamental mistakes that I capitalize on so I thought I'd point them out.  I enjoy when survivors put up a fight.
---
In what way am I being a "dick"? Or are you just looking for an argument?
---
By broken you clearly mean that the projectile is literally broken and even on direct hits will miss (somehow). Seriously, it's very frustrating to clearly hit a survivor with the vomit and it not count because of how poorly its done.
---
Why just mostly fine? He deserves an apology.
---
I can’t wait to see the new currency system and the other things they put in. Anyone play from last year? Not me but there’s an offering they brought back that I’d like to know what it is.
---
Generally, cleansing is best done at clutch moments in the game if you're far away from Plague. Such as a hook standoff or when she's chasing more than one person. This way, the killer can't get the fountain without abandoning their current objective, and if they do that, everyone can take the time to hide and prepare for her to have Corrupt Purge.
---
AS A SURV MAIN I COMPLETELY AGREE
---
Honestly, I think making trapper bag and tar bottle base kit would make him B tier with Meyers and Ghostface
---
For a relatively minor rework, just change his traps to spawn in lockers, and not natively be placed in the world.  Let him carry 3 traps base (So Trapper's Bag.), but not pick up placed active traps.   Snapped traps will decay on their own (Or automatically disappear if he grabs more traps from a locker that would put him over the limit), or survivors can sabo them in like 3 seconds (destroying them completely), or he can pick them up or just directly re-arm them.  Set trap max to 10 traps, increased by addons.
---
I’d make his arms a little longer and give his body more emotion, right now it’s just straight down. Other then that amazing job OP
---
I like your smile!
---
That definitely doesn't strike me as rude per say but from his perspective he may have thought you were being one of those people who backseat all of his videos with ways he could have done better...even though the dude is probably a better player than 80% of his viewers
---
Lmao have you tried solo survivor? It’s a ducking nightmare
---
Upstate Fog
---
For a second I thought he'd come right back for one last nod before the camera pans up.
---
No. It isn’t.
---
Legion: exits frensy 5mm from survivor
---
Survivor: runs 27 miles to next pallet
---
Legion: exits frensy stun 5 hours later still 27 miles away from survivor.
---
I'm hoping it drops Thursday, but at the latest...I'd assume Tuesday.
---
I mean I kind of expected this due to the power outage. They would've lost some work due to it.
---
Yes it is. How many pallets were around? Could he have made it to a jungle gym? A T-wall loop? If any of these don’t work for you, you’re a bad survivor and getting downed is your fault.
---
I felt this in my soul 😂💀
---
He's a fun killer to play but as you rank down he is especially useless against experienced survivors turning hin roughly into a M1 killer. Despite complications as you rank down he's solid and overall fun killer. His addons simply just don't compliment him enough.
---
I have no idea why you were downvoted, you are entirely correct.
---
Bubbatrain? I'm not even new to the game and it's the first time I heard that term XD
---
There wooing you not booing you
---
Thanks I made it myself
---
Beware of Mihacel!
---
I hate survivors that insist on healing me, if i want heals ill come to you just get on the dang gen lol 😂
---
No. Unhooking a survivor where they’ll be downed in 15 seconds means you’ve farmed them, by putting them directly back into a losing situation. You’re bad, not me.
---
COULD BHVR *AT LEAST* HAVE GIVEN US A DOUBLE BLOODPOINT EVENT?! I GET IT, "UNFORSEEN CIRCUMSTANCES" BUT COME ON. AT LEAST GIVE US *SOMETHING* AFTER HYPING US ALL. DAMN. MONTH.
---
&gt; He’s fucking good nasty good at the game but he is ridiculous when the game doesn’t go his way
---
he's good at killer. 
---
every time i see him play survivor it seems like he's camping pallets though.
---
Obsession: aight imma head out.
---
Ive been playing 3 years and she still lasts longer than me .-.
---
NOT YOUR FAULT FOR THINKING THE DEVS WOULD FUCK ANOTHER PERK IN THE ASS. STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR THEM AFTER ALL.

F
---
*Tbagging Ghostface Intensifies*
---
Oof, just a natural then!
---
Well they did a pretty good job, I thought the was photo actually taken in the woods.
---
Nice bait
---
Indeed!
---
I don't really like Nurses on him because typically only potato survivors are going to heal against that build of his and you won't really need a perk to find that grade of survivor anyways.
---
What's a blendette? I've never seen one before.
---
Tends to trigger people for some odd reason lol
---
I honestly thought he would be camping them lol
---
“Sorry, sir. VIP only.”
---
Wish I was that good a survivor. I'm a good killer tho
---
When the survivor doesn't struggle this making it easy.
---
It has uses, but not many.
---
When I first started playing, i liked hiding around corners and using it.
---
Playing survivor would be that much more hard but also that much more interesting. 
---
Playing killer is about the same.
---
Every. Single. Time. Without fail.
---
Yeah it really is quite a solid perk and you can make some fantastic plays with it.  I still haven't purchased GF yet but I'm wanting to chiefly to run that perk as I play a lot of M1 killers.
---
The doctor was White as a child
---
Same Im much better as a killer but unfortunately you cant play kill your friends and get points .-.
---
Making his traps much harder to see on most maps would definitely make him stronger. Imagine running his really good add-ons with those as his base kit.
---
Yeah... tis sad
---
I have this issue too. Everytime I use a killer offering it doesn’t work. After that game, did you then have Freddy selected? That’s what happens to me.
---
RUN ALL THE POWER RECOVERY ADD ONS (PEN AND ADDRESS BOOK) AND DON'T STALK JUST REMOVE YOUR TERROR RADIUS AND STAIN. CAN'T MIND GAME HIM CUZ NO STAIN, CAN'T SEE HIM SNEAK UP ON YOU CUZ HE NEVER FINISHES HIS STALK. NURSES, BBQ, RUIN, etc
---
&gt;I have been rank 15 on survivor, match up against rank 8 survivors and killers. Im a rank 27 killer, i got ranked against 4 rank 10 survivors. I didnt have this problem before the reset though.

This really knocks my nipples.
---
Are you Plague mains having trouble rapidly charging and releasing Vile Purge or is it only me?  
---
I also had match where I lost my Corrupt Purge half-filled after a pallet throw that didn't hit me, but I think that's related to dedicated servers like Myers' Evil Within misfire.

It took me four tries to read it as intended.

Absolutely under no circumstances should you ever intentionally feed a NOED Gamer another free kill.  Don't ever let anybody guilt trip you about that.  Goal should always be to get as many as possible out against that BS not to reward them for running it.  You did the right thing.
---
Holy shit I just checked and yeah he's selected. I'll try playing a game as him i guess?
---
BOY I SURE DO LOVE GOING AGAINST THE TUNNELING BITCH THAT THE GAME REFERS TO AS "HAG"
---
none you always vault at the same speed if its fast 
---
slow and middle vaults are affected by resilience and spine chill
---
New killer: Willy Wonka 
---
New map: candy land 
---
New Clown skin: Oompa Loompa
---
With this glitch I’ve cracked the game. Whenever I use an offering it lets me play that killer for as many games as I want. I can even put bloodpoints into them
---
Maybe more of a bug idk
---
I was told I legit scared people when I play ghost face when I got creepy stalker rather than t-bagging bastard
---
Holy shit time to get all my pig teachables
---
seems you're fully convinced with yourself. ruin is included with the 4-5 gens done, thats how hard it is. Im telling this from my experience going against and going as tombstone
---
killer would use a pickax and his power would have to do with building or destroying. i'm sure it would take a lot of work to make a killer that can break all walls and obstacles in the map. maybe it would be easier if it were only a temporary break, that just makes the models invisible and passable til the power is done. but of course it'd be cooler for the destruction to last all trial.
---
Awaken my masters
---
4 totems would be too easy to locate at least a few of them. I'd suggest either increase the cleansing time (possibly with skillchecks?) or increase the amount of totems in general
---
Scary mask. Wherefrom?
---
Ok but have you considered that this is all Joe's fault
---
Shits hilarious
---
It’s useful when you know a survivor will return to a place, ex: 99% gen and then you’ll get an almost free hit on them. Other than that and camping however, not really
---
How was it playing against him?
---
At my mall at a store called Spencer’s I think not too sure would have to ask my brother
---
ah yes the add on that requires you to t3 at a tremendous penalty to EW and makes you move slower, and that is easily cucked by a locker
---
v e r y o p
---
I mean you toss the word braindead around in terms of using Borrowed to counter a Camper/Tunneler but what word would you use for the killer in that scenario?   He ain't exactly making 1000 IQ plays there.
---
Most of the games were meme builds so it was pretty fun. The more regular builds it was just a normal game. Didn’t camp or tunnel unless it made sense to (like someone rushing the hook or whatever)
---
And then when they do release a strong perk it's strong for the wrong reasons and they then nerf it into utter uselessness. 
---
See: Mettle of Man, which requires you to basically sandbag now in order to get a use out of it.  They could've easily made it be a counter to NOED instead (i.e. "If a hit would put you from healthy to dying state, MoM activates and only puts you in the injured state") or something.
---
𝓒𝓸𝓻𝓻𝓮𝓬𝓽
---
Please just buff surge
---
borrowed isn't just for campers my dude it's a perk that legit makes it where u can save any time u want to while in chase even
---
Yeah that was a horrific change they have him.  Hey guys I got a great idea.  Let's take that killer we just reworked to top 4 status and give him a James Bond License to Tunnel.  Brilliant!
---
Slug them and don't forget to say "EZ" at the end
---
95% of the time, yes
---
freddy looks like something straight out of persona 5
---
Dang i always wanted to get a game against monto lol
---
Yeah, it isn’t really op but it certainly is great fun, yo! I bought him and Freddy just the other day and I’m loving Freddy. Not too good with Myers yet but I enjoyed my time, thoroughly, so far.
---
Well yeah, dragging Tru3 is a meme itself now. I used to like tru3, but I think that people got a bit sick of the way he complains sometimes. Half the time he’ll say something accurate, the other half he’ll say something inaccurate and be mocked for it. As time has gone on more people will just jump on anything he says now without really thinking.
---
Nahhhhhhh, just had to many high ping killers and am taking a break to Reddit, though this is what I normally do
---
Or he just moves closer and exposes you anyway. Haven’t found a method that works against ghost face. If you hide, he can just move around to get you, if you run, he will expose you, if you reveal him, you won’t reveal him in time. I hate that bitch.
---
Mookel Miers.

GOT STUCK WITH 3 RANK 20S, THE BABY MEGS WERE ADORABLE TRYING TO GET CHASED AND DO GENS. IMMERSE CUNT JAKE WALKING AROUND THE MAP HELD GAME HOSTAGE TILL I FORCED HAG TO FUCKING KILL ME. WASNT EVEN HUMBLE ABOUT HATCH, THE CUNT.

Rank reset? It feels like you did something to him that upset it...

It was literally designed to counter camping and tunneling.  Like any perk it can be repurposed like your proposed scenario but I'll share a super secret elite strat of "mine" just keep it between us.  In that scenario you can hit the unhooker as he approaches the hook, he will unhook the survivor, your blood wipe animation ends, you smack him a second time before he gets to take 2 steps from the hook.  Voila!  No Borrowed Time to deal with, no Decisive either and you still got a meatsack dangling from your hook.  Again keep that just between us I don't want everyone knowing about it.
---
Wrong flair.
---
Bad-fucking-ass!
---
Then why blast the audio to 1000%? I was having a good time until that point.
---
This was very well thought out! Thank u!
---
i facepalmed so hard my hand went inside of my skull
---
hey since you’re a Meyers main can you pls explain to me how you do the thing where you just instantly kill someone? im like very new to this game
---
:(
---
#Justice4rank20’s
---
Yeah, I'd be damned if the game (any game, in fact) somehow becomes worse than the launch.
---
Thank you, fren!
---
That’s why you stand on top of it cloaked, wait for them to get nearby, and then slam it right in front of them.
---
I’m not sure if you can bodyblock the whole thing anymore, but if you’re quick you can slam it before they reach it
---
They should increase Rep.Time for swf groups imo and remove ruin from the game
---
I haven't achieved that kind of status on him yet. 😂 I do try and grab dem bois. I never talk with him though u less I have a super big lead on them. What perks do you use?
---
It's also annoying that in a typical scenario:
---
One survivor is hooked
---
One survivor is being chased
---
One survivor is either working on a gen with a regression or is going for the unhook
---
The obsession, the biggest threat that has no regression, is free to work on gens or go for the unhook + heal, which they do even faster
---
It makes the biggest threat immune and the effect is only good with Thanatophobia, as it isn't big enough without it AND due to how math works
---
The more regression there is, the more each %point matters
---
3% when there's 0% reduction already: 3/100 = 3% of the speed
---
3% when there's 40% reduction already: 3/60 = 5% of the current speed
---
If you can spell "unforeseen circumstances," you definitely can spell "We got a power outage."
---
I've seen some of his replies on his videos, and let me tell you, the way he responds to comments is really rude a lot of times. This applies even more if you're wrong, asking something somewhat basic (something that a lot of players would know), or challenging his ideas.
---
The first time I really noticed this was on one video where he claimed that you don't pronounciate NOED (No One Escapes Death) as "No-Ed", but instead you should say it the same was as you would say  "Node". Some people were disageeing with him and he seemed pretty mad in the comments.
---
I always have enjoyed his content, but I really just don't like the way he responds to comments in a rude manner when he could simply answer normally/politely or outright ignore the comment.
---
Yes 8k x 4 is 32k. Killers have a better shot at getting it (since 8k Survival points in addition to 8k in everything else is borderline impossible as survivor, though I’ve seen it before). I’ve only done it twice and I have 746 hours in the game currently.
---
Maybe he was the one sitting in queue for a long time. Matchmaking goes both ways.
---
I've done something similar, instead of vaulting a window in a chase, i got sucked into the locker nearby..rip
---
That’s probably why people want to 4K lol
---
Especially the longer the match goes on and the harder it is to kill the survivors. They worked hard so they want to finish all 4, like a little reward lol
---
But I’m confused. Is this meme from the survivors perspective or killers?  I can kind of see this as a funny killer meme or an anti 4K survivor meme
---
If you were the one who threw the ax over the car and smacked me from a distance I applaud you
---
Apex:Legends wasn’t too bad. But yeah, Overwatch and TF2 are all just recycled crap with more cosmetics to buy.
---
the huntress is spot on my god well done
---
if you're on PC it might have been but probably wasn't because i got this game on saturday and couldn't hit a survivor who was standing still
---
Honestly, it'd be really strong. Killers like Wraith can use their power to get an initial injury when they start a chase, Legion just gets free injures on healthy survivors, getting bear trapped...
---
There's lots of injury events getting thrown around for some killers.
---
or they haven't played in a while
---
Until bloodlust 3 hits and nothing matters anymore :(
---
this one clip perfectly summarizes myers not just in game play, but as his entire character.
---
Ruin is mathematically stronger than any other slowdown. You won't get 3 gens done especially since Survivors will just ignore gens to drop Ruin in most ranks. 
---
Tombstone doesn't need to kill EVERY CHARACTER to be good either: Michael himself is quite good even in tier 2 and if you play aggressively under no circumstance should you need to tier all the time, even if you just kill one or two you will win with a 4K given odds, at least 3K not accounting for hatch. 
---
Again, it's not hard if you honestly just run the literal other purple that makes stalking insanely fast, it's far from weak.
---
Its happening to me also, i get dailys and go to do them, and i look at them again and they are completely different everytime.
---
I hate to be that guy because I look at this and say “that’s really cool!” And at the same time I look at fredwards hand and it’s hard for me to accept his glove is on the wrong hand 😭
---
You'd at least think a company would have some kind of backups?
---
If you meme with me, I will protect you with my simple Quentin life.
---
huntress can miss tho. Plague can just spray all around over obstacles and you'll get hit most of the time
---
Okay, but the Lery’s Center top-and-bottom infinite loop is still BS.
---
If you get someone with Balanced who knows how to run it correctly, they will literally be able to run you the whole game.
---
He is really good though on a serious note lol
---
Like, in the top branch of killers
---
Ignoring all the perks that literally do early pressure for you. 
---
Also you can pop it strategically and chain kills. The act of killing one survivor at any point will make the game a fuck ton easier yet you act like the fact that he's slower even matters: Survivors can only run for so long period.
---
FUCK TEAMMATES WHO BODY BLOCK ONLY FOR ME TO GET SACRIFICED AFTER I DID THREE GENS, SAVED THEIR ASS OFF THE HOOK, AND FOUND THE NOED TOTEM
---
I mean, I spend most of the game injured anyway so what's the big deal?
---
There's absolutely no way you're doing everything every round unless you play with literal bots. If you're sitting on gens for most of the game, your teammates are doing the work actually keeping the killer busy so you can m1 the entire time.
---
Also, hooking Survivors took for fucking EVER for some reason.
---
Look back at old game footage, the hooking animation was so sluggish for no reason.
---
You know why AAA games have day 1 patches? Because they finished the bulk of it and then before releases they QC more and patch bugs. Typically until the week of, and beyond release.
---
Do you mean like kill them or like knock them on the ground in one hit. If you mean kill them that’s a certain add on that allows you to kill them if they are in a healthy state and tier 3 is for one hitting them.
---
Many people just don’t realize it lol.  
---
Once you stop trying to stalk people and use his power for the tricky chases. He is a monster
---
Don’t know why ether but meh
---
You killed Miranda Cosgrove??? You motherfucker
---
Thx
---
Did that on PS4 this afternoon. 3 games in a row. Lol
---
Yeah was gonna comment this. At least that will always work there. 
---
Just had a Gas Heaven where there were no hills, no claw machines, no trucks and basement was at the servo. Bad rng sometimes
---
I..... I don’t get it.
---
Harry Warden
---
I'M JUST TRYING TO A FAN FUCKING TASTIC TIME PLAYING THIS GAME IN MY OFF TIME AND FOR SOME REASON PEOPLE IN SWF WILL NEVER HELP ME WHEN I NEED IT YET I'LL HELP THEM THIS GUY GOT HOOKED AND I NEEDED HEALING AND I RUN TO THE OTHER TWO SURVIVORS TO HEAL AND THEY DIDNT DO JACK THEY JUST T-BAGGED AND TRIED TO SAVE THEIR FRIENDS AND THEY ENDED UP DYING LIKE A BUNCH OF CLOWNS
---
Yea, especially when sometimes you reveal him from the other side of the map and in the same match he's just standing in front of you and the game gives you the reveal sound like once or twice and you get exposed eventually.
---
The biggest problem is that when he's not very far away, his model is too big to be kept in the center area for long enough and the fact that grass can cover up to 40% of his model
---
Thanks for letting me know I struck a nerve 😂
---
Literally the first page of your Reddit comments are you being salty/angry over things. Take a break and go outside dude
---
I'm speaking about them spending tons of cash on cosmetics, but "not having enough" for dbd
---
Blame the new swf system. You're forced to play with ppl's low ranked swf buddies
---
Ok but this update has been planned for awhile, your telling me it wasnt at least very near finished, and or backed up a WEEK before it came out? Thats just poor time management.
---
Your proposed scenario relies on there even being a pallet still up AND that close to the hook.  Which of our two examples sounds more niche?
---
if you won, you might as well have lost, as you're probably 90% stalked and he's just waiting for his power to recharge
---
RIA RIA RIA
---
Killer worked hard for the 4 kill. Only got brutal killer instead of ruthless or merciless.
---
I was trying to decipher what "WTH" might mean, as "What The Hell" didn't quite fit, for way too long...
---
This is incredible.
---
Yeah ok. That’s what I thought XD
---
Sorry I thought too much about it lol
---
Feels bad for sure when that happens, on a side note though lol
---
They probably don't want it man, let them be.
---
Has anybody tried playing killer with VR? I've been wanting to try it out on my psvr but haven't gotten around to it yet.
---
Daddy Myers lookin real sexy
---
I doubt it was you but I just did this to somebody about half an hour ago on PS4. Heard the generator chugging along so it must have been close, snuck around it and snatch them right off it. Very satisfying.
---
Any other killer
---
I have a ball with myers. I love stalking people and getting to T3 and downing them...man oh man, that's satisfying.
---
True I literally have the quickest games when I play him and get a small map easy blood point farming lmao
---
Make ruin more punishing then. Smaller success zones with heavier regression penalties.
---
On a time limit, it'll balance out fair.
---
This is why you leave when you have the chance
---
Well if you want actual discussion the forums are open, although they are salt mines as well of people hating spirit for being bullshit in their eyes
---
I've found its better to use Frenzy as sort of wallhacks for a second or two then turn it off and commit to the surv you were chasing.
---
i mean like straight up kill them like press a button then grab them by the neck and stab em like twice, saw a vid where someone did it as him when he got to tier 3 and also his tier 3 never went away
---
&lt;/3
---
What is a 4k? Keep seeing this on here no idea...
---
Glad you like it!
---
Yea that’s a like pink or something add on and I can’t remember if it’s a perk or an add on but it’s called tombstone which means your tier 3 never goes away
---
Who the hell are you?
---
When the killer sacrifices or moris all 4 survivors
---
dead hard and borrowed time are literally meta perks
---
"Went to Mars"....
---
Lol how so man?  I provided pretty straightforward logic to your criticism of the perk and showed you how to quite easily hard counter it in 90% of your situations.  
---
This just sounds like a stubborn dismissal of a valid response.
---
They really didn't have to do ghost like that.... I miss him so much. He was an amazing character. And he will forever be missed. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
It’s actually Janto
---
Mine went through my skull and hit my clones face
---
my arguement was that borrowed already gives survivors the ability to save any time they want to no matter the circumstances. while I agree it is used against shitty killers who camp that's not its entire purpose and it's more used for "I can save any time this trial without being punished for it". it even provides a free escape end game when a killer is forced to camp that last survivor because the exits are 99ed.
---
The perks are actually very decent
---
Thanks!
---
u/vredditshare
---
poor huntress lol
---
Pretty good perk powers and ability but they need balancing, mainly the downward smash and the first two perks are overpowered.
---
He's Prestige 1. Most certainly not a baby.
---
RIP asshole Ace.
---
Ignore him until they start body blocking and give you a free hit lol
---
if he could carry 2 traps without a trapping bag that would be a good update for him
---
Gives no excuse to camp though. If there's a moment when you can't use your chainsaw, just basic attack them. That simple

With some luck and a coordinated team, Survivors can complete 5 gens in around 5 minutes. If gens took longer, the Killer could find Survivors more often and chase for longer so you know... Survivors and Killers both can have some gameplay.
---
Instant karma. Hahah

And then swiftly proceeds to don his pinky necklace and laugh in tuberculosis.

I must see this later

r/ImagesYouCanFeel

~~btw this sub is super cursed and I hate it~~
---
Again it isn't a free escape.  Don't tunnel...trade bodies.  Focus the unhooker.  Ggez
---
Its like why you gotta be so mean to the killer regardless of what rank you are? I just play casually and I don't go out of my way to harass the killer or smack them with every pallet on the map. Killers are just trying to have fun same as the suvivor.
---
I would pay actual money. Someone start a go fund me.
---
It is, which is why she's horribly designed. Plague either doesn't have a power or has a power which is so overbearing everyone hides in a locker until it goes away.
---
exactly miss a skillcheck when the gens nearly 0% and for the next 10 seconds u get a massive gen speed boost especially if u pair it with prove thyself and a toolbox
---
Definitely one of the better iterations on the Myers mask. It maintains genuine resemblance to the original, and whereas the ways in which these masks deviate from the original usually end up looking weird, funny or uncanny at best, the ways in which this one does are actually unsettling.
---
Good job outplaying that rank 20 nurse man
---
It's things like this that prove that Behaviour can buff Trapper, because he has so many counters built into the base game that they wouldn't need to add more counters if he was stronger.
---
Myers is daddy and Ghostface is your little brother who suddenly is bursting into your room.
---
r/woosh
---
But have you raced to see whats faster, the nurse teleporting or the hatchet being thrown?
---
Imo this wouldn’t be a bad idea IF plague was top tier and running around kicking everyone’s shit in, but as I don’t see that being the case I don’t really feel like it would do any good to do something like this.
---
I think me and you played a few hours ago and I missed my 32k by like 20 points lmao
---
Exactly how I play as killer and it's so frustrating to see how many people tunnel and camp when 5 gens are still up. Matchmaking on survivor for me has been miserable because we either stomp or I watch everyone get slaughtered.
---
I cant tell if this is a compliment or if you're making fun of me for out running a low ranked nurse.
---
When people with cosmectics join your lobby
---
The fucking nerve of some people i stg
---
Lobbies just kinda suck, it’s always been that way and it just got worse and worse
---
Mikey has  camel toe
---
Id rather do the easier counter of treating her like an m1 killer
---
It's either insecurity or the same tribalism that makes people obsess over sports so hard. Maybe actual sadism in a few cases, but that's probably rooted in insecurity.
---
BIH Asshole Ace.
---
Trapper: Goes back the other way, pretty much making you either step on that trap or try to run away
---
E D G Y
---
That's got nothing to do with programming but latency.
---
Yeah people complain about Plague but she's never ranked as a top tier killer for a reason.
---
He has no map pressuring abilities or map control and he's slow as shit with no way to move around faster.
---
He legion and Trapper need reworks ASAP.
---
You need to learn to zone and to trick survivors  into being greedy.
---
Zone: make sure at every chance you get you move in a way that coerces the chase into an unsafe area with broken pallets.
---
Tricking as leatherface: 
---
- if theres flashlight save attempts then next time you down a survivor bait the save by pretending to walk over and shoulder the kill (just walk up to the dying state surv and stand on them for 3 seconds), when they run out expecting the animation to start they will be close and you should be able to run up and chainsaw  them.
---
- similar situation is if a Survivor is downed under a pallet leave them for a bit and go and stop a generator or something, come back in 10 or so seconds and again pretend to pick the Survivor up, anyone looking to get a pallet save will expose himself and run right up to you
---
- Moonwalk to a pallet when the Survivor may try to extend the loop, if they turn to go back and slam you should be able to body block them and then it's an easy saw, otherwise they commit to the loop and you are already very close.
---
- baiting a revive is a great way to get more kills, when you down a survivor leave them for a few seconds and try to come back from an angle that will force any Survivor trying to heal them off the ground into are corner or open area.
---
- when they are running around in a circle around an object that is big enough that if you chainsaw you will come up short just switch directions after the first swing and they will run into you.
---
I think Tru3 is starting to fall down the same hole that TydeTyme fell into. He's played the game for far too long and is suffering from burnout. Once you've played against enough people (especially against enough toxic assholes which, ima be honest, Tru3 goes up against a *lot* of toxic assholes) you start to grow sick and tired of the game. He's not as bad as Tyde because [Tyde has an obvious superiority complex](https://youtu.be/cImWSBqeC0E) but it's quite clear that he's cursed with the knowledge that comes with playing this game far too much, as well as the curse of fame which comes with the constant stream of "aoh hez streem snopin' meh" and "foken tockic d'ik 'eads tryin' toh ruen me ma'chez."
---
As much as I hate AngryPug he's proven that branching your content out (especially away from the admittedly buggy and infuriating mess that is DBD) does a lot of good for a content creator. He seems a lot more chill in-game now that he spends some time playing games like Apex along with Dead by Daylight, or at least he did last time I checked. As much as Bo0b3's upload schedule sucks the big maple syrup his sparse upload schedule does allow his videos to be a lot more invested than I assume they would be if he did actually keep to a consistent upload schedule. While some of us (myself included) might play Dead by Daylight as our main game of choice with some occasional breaks for other games you have to realize that for Streamers playing this game *is their job.* They do it for several hours at a time and they also have to try their best to be entertaining while doing it. I completely sympathize with Tru3 that, after the 10th match in a row against flashlight clicking assholes or with teammates who don't do gens I really want to quit the game. But the thing is that while the rest of us can go play Civ 5 or something he has to keep playing to get his paycheck.
---
So at risk of digging a dead meme into the ground I think Tru3 really needs to go play Civilization or something. If he doesn't find DBD fun anymore he shouldn't play a game he doesn't enjoy. He has enough of an audience that people will watch him play other games. I honestly think he'd be really fun to watch play something like Hearthstone. Hell I'd even watch him play Fortnite not gonna lie.
---
r/uselessnobody
---
Oh yea doing 4 gens then dying on first hook right next to the exit gate. Gee thanks teammates i can see how you all made it to rank 1 youre all so great
---
I FUCKING HATE PEOPLE LIKE THAT, IF YOUR GOING TO BE A TOXIC LITTLE SHIT AND TEABAG AND SPAM YOUR FLASHLIGHT I AM GONNA BE A TOXIC BIG SHIT AND TUNNEL YOUR BITCH ASS, CAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU IN MY FUCKING GAME.
---
Yes
---
I’m just imagining “Free hatches” spray painted on the side of killer shack
---
Yep
---
That’s when I switch from Bubba to Spirit
---
is it worth spending the 2k shards on an already known perk for the 150k BP? :thinking:
---
You....can trade them out.  This keeps a body on the hook.  Increases your BP and helps with your emblems.  Killers are not entitled to uncontestable camps and tunnels.
---
Only way to get into a Killer game lately.
---
EVERY TIME I PLAY AGAINST A NURSE NO MATTER WHAT RANK THEY ARE THEY ALWAYS TP INTO A WALL HEAD FIRST AT LEAST ONCE AND ITS PRETTY FUCKING FUNNY.
---
I quit the game because it wasn't fun for me anymore. This was a very long time ago.
---
Play With Your Food lets you compensate for the slowdown while revving the saw, but you have to be good at finding and proxy-chasing to really make it shine. Leatherface is ultimately too compromised in his chasing, especially when Hillbilly is available.
---
Yep they suck. Been sitting here for 15 minutes now
---
DON'T YOU LOVE WHEN BILLY SPEEDS IN THE SCHOOL ZONE? JUST PLAY OFFICER TAPPS AND GIVE HIM A TICKET!
---
Here's spirit, but who cares look at her gigantic fucking taped ass
---
The best way to slow the game down is to have people forced to do things other than gens (run, save, heal, mend, crawl, sit on hooks). The problem is that by the time you've downed a guy, three gens are usually on the verge of completion. 
---
The point of game slowing perks is to buy enough time to down survivors, starting that snowball before the games practically over. 
---
Ruin is the only perk that does this to a significant degree.
---
Every time they get a skill check, it will either stop them from getting 1.6 seconds shaved off the action or it will increase the required time by 7 seconds. Since it's actually an average of 6.4 checks per gen (that's before accounting for the extra charges put into the gen from the time ruin buys you, so I'll round up to 7), that's upwards of 49 extra seconds bought on each gen until it's lost.
---
That's easily enough time to get a down and start exerting pressure. 
---
Perks like pop and surge do nothing until you've already downed a guy,  meaning it's still entirely possible to have 2-3 gens popped after a single early game chase where you break one safe pallet and down the guy on the second tile.
---
Pop is at least a decent regression; 20 seconds each proc. It can come in clutch, inlike Surge, which is pathetic. The time it buys you isn't even enough to hook the guy you just downed.
---
Other game slowing perks have issues too.
---
Sloppy doesn't directly slow gens and has several counters. 
---
Dying Light is still trash, since by the time it's stacked up you don't have any gens left to slow. 
---
Thana has trash numbers. 
---
The only really good options are Ruin and Corrupt.
---
take it up with the dev's who designed her that way
---
GOOD FUCKING STORY BUT MAKE IT CAPTIAL LETTERS CAUSE ITS MAKING ME [ANGRYASFUK](/intensifies)
---
&gt; if you chase one guy off the hook all game and still don’t get that one kill you probably just aren’t very good
---
I don't really disagree with that. The only bit I would add there is that with gen speed as quick as it is, a rank 1 team could do every gen on the map while someone loops you until adrenaline pops. It's highly dependent on the killer you're playing, along with your own skill, but it certainly is possible with the proper tile spawns. 
---
&gt; Notice I said I also base my
---
I noted it, which is why I didn't accuse *you* specifically of moralizing the issue; however, the line you used of "like to try and make sure everyone has fun" is a commonly used phrase when someone *does* moralize the issue. They plant themselves way up on the moral high ground and stick their nose up at anybody not in line with them. 
---
&gt; In the same sense that eggs are a part of a cake
---
I'm sorry, but this is one giant false equivalence. Cakes are comprised of multiple ingredients to construct one final piece, and improper balance can ruin the finale. Alternatively, this game is comprised of multiple elements that all lead to the same two endings: living, or dying. Some people will spend more time doing generators, others saving and healing, and others leading the killer on distracting chases. The same two results will always be present. You live, or you die. Note how you don't hear the same level of indignation from those that do generators all game as opposed to those chased all game. Generators don't threaten your mortality, and they don't require any real level of thought. The only time you hear really heavy complaints is when someone is targeted for death. They lash out and throw tantrums. 
---
&gt; No you’re not obligated to do anything as I’ve stated numerous times
---
Perhaps I wasn't very clear in my original post, and you have my apologies for that, but I'm not really pointing anything at you. The responses are more generalized and applicable to those for whom the shoe fits. I have no issue whatsoever with someone imposing a rule set on themselves. My issue is with those that try to enforce it on someone else, and this is definitely a thing that happens through shame and social censure, and it occurs on both sides. 
---
Aside from that, my other problem is that this only ever goes one way. While whiny killers exist and call looping toxic, I don't ever really see anyone that suggests survivors have to purposely do anything that positively influences the killer. On the other hand, I *repeatedly* see survivors trying to force killers to do things to positively influence them. Whether it's not "slugging", "tunneling", "camping", or not doing anything else they find unsavory, there's always some sort of "you can't do this unless you're a scumbag piece of shit".
---
I personally have stopped running hex perks just because of how bad my rng is with totem spawns ;-;
---
The greatest masterpieces are created from powerful emotions
---
Well I mean technically he doesn’t see your aura :b
---
Most rank 1-4 survivors i play against actively try to reveal me though. You can’t get one shot if GF is revealed.
---
Mad Grit is a counter to bodyblock, so you might be happy to have it down the road. They REALLY need to let you disable teachables, though. Just have a menu where you can demand that some you've bought still not show up in bloodwebs.
---
In fact, that'd be great data for what to buff or rework. "Oh, literally nobody wants this perk, time to merge it with a similar perk and help reduce the clutter over 120 perks causes!"
---
God my last game I today I was Hag, and for some ungodly reason I couldn't lay traps. I would right click, and I would start the animation and it would instantly end.
---
I assume it was caused by someone not connecting to the game, as the game ended shortly after it started but I was mad.
---
PLAYING HALLOWEEN EVENTS IN NOVEMBER
---
I feel you, its a real love hate thing as mainly a solo player with 1.7k hours, but i can also say some of the best survivors ive gone against mainly play solo aswell
---
Seems to me solo players are some of the best in this game
---
Jeff?
---
It probably depends on connection
---
It would be if there were a Killer who could use some 3rd person vision while immobile.
---
Currently, rarely, and never more than some alternative.

You can see total play time over all games in an email thet send you every week but thats it :/

No your reports wont do anything, and it would be very stupid if they could because this person is not breaking TOS by simply blocking you from moving. In all actuality the ate screening themselves over buy not playing the game and just trolling you, less blood points/ ex ect..
---
Damn. I guess I’ll never know how long I have played this game. But people can’t call me couch potato so that’s a plus
---
It is, do the report thing. Despite popular myths, it does work.

This isn't true he held the survivors game hostage.  That's an example of the reportable form of bodyblocking and there is an option for it under the report tab.
---
If you have limited access to perks then 'Sloppy Butcher' is good for slowing the game down.
---
You have Huntress Lullaby and that can help slow the game.
---
Obviously the hatchets can help with certain loops, so that's always a plus.
---
Bitter Murmurs and Whispers are also useful tracking perks to keep pressure us if you have limited access to perks because they're also universal.
---
I don’t even play this game and I feel personally attacked
---
lol that must sucked so hard!
---
Oh what the ding
---
if they fix gen speed or add a second objective then less killers would use it
---
Lol bodyblockling is when a fellow survivor intentionally gets in your way to screw you over, this doesn't couth for the killer.

I had to giggle , take my upvote sir.

Doesn't help that matchmaking is being a bit wonky as of late. I'm rank 12 on survivor (haven't played in ages) and I've had several matches with all rank 20 survivors and a rank 20 killer with 1 perk.
---
for people who don't get this. sometimes the killer gives you the hatch if you are the last downed survivor. by wiggling you deny the act of kindness from the killer so the killer hooks you instead it is 50/50 :'). would not work if you play Claudette btw.
---
its capped so that is incorrect
---
More please.
---
&gt; I know a healthy portion of my losses is me not playing as well as the survivors with hundreds of hours at this point but I cannot accept that it is 100% because of that.
---
The faster you acknowledge that, the better. You are not playing vs bots, so every game will have different "difficulty level". Sometimes you'll get a lobby full of potatoes, and you'll wreck them. Sometimes you'll get a spec ops team, and will feel like a complete noob. Just don't think that every game you've lost was against 4-man SWF on comms. That's not true.
---
&gt; Don't have anything to slow down the Gen's they do ridiculously fast. I just cannot compete.
---
That's because you're not good enough, yet. Thinking that at 20 hours you're good at the game is naïve. You don't need Ruin to be at red ranks playing any killer. It's easier with game slowing perks, but they're not mandatory.
---
Weird 🧐
---
That'd be a great system if I could ever get into a game as killer Haha but good to know
---
Nice when you can see it in the opening screen
---
Lame internet joke is lame. 
---
You tried.
---
Of course they can. In a way, they were kind of right to try to make me go away from the hook.. But in this case i was sort of forced to keep an eye on the hook. But i admit i did a mistake and i should have patrolled. I played a few games yesterday and i managed to do a little bit better :)
---
Dude, I have Huntress Lullaby (T3) and never get to use it because they find the Hex withing 30 fucking seconds of the match start, every fucking time. Still waiting for Sloppy to show up on my Huntress. Finally got Bitter just now.
---
Sprint burst is definitely not the best exhaustion perk
---
I know this is a joke but it’s jabba the hut or PewDiePie’s dog maya
---
LOUD NOISES! STOP BLOWING GENS!
---
This is like arguing that the sun isn't hot man.  It's a fact that that is reportable and bannable.  You need to report the option on post game screen and submit a video clip of them doing it to Behaviors support.  They won't ban without video.  You can deny this as much as you want it won't make it true.
---
I honestly think that no one has ever had a single survivor daily ever since the stranger things dlc came to the game.
---
I had ONE.... just 1 survivor daily recently. I decided to finish my killer daily since I only had to stalk 1 more person with Myers. After the match was over the game decided to replace "heal 3 health states" to with the shape kill by your hand 1 survivor. 
---
The funny thing is that I literally trashed a killer daily in Hope's of getting a survivor daily and finally got it. I used up my 1 and only trash option and the game switched it right after the match was over. I was furious. 
---
I just let them stack and do 3 in one go now. Playing killer is boring for me.
---
I love to play alone but I love to play with my friend Alex for a few rounds. But I can see why people hate that. We don’t win all games. We just talk about life while playing. It’s nice
---
Oh my god I have to do this
---
Than you're using 2 perk slots for an exhaustion perk
---
Top ten haunting pictures taken seconds before disaster
---
not really easy when being sick makes you super, SUPER easy to track. also doesnt work in higher ranks, where I and a lot of other killers get good at predicting survivor moves.
---
And imma slap you with karma to...have an upvote
---
Doubt it was delayed for that. If I know something it was problems with the rift.
---
She looks fantastic!

As someone who plays GF and plays survivor against him, there are situations on both sides that are bs. The hit boxes on some objects definitely need to be touched.

Who cares! Looks Great!

##JOE MAMA 🤣🤣🤣
---
Yeah, saw one yesterday, my gf pointed it out as we played together. I think it was a Coldwind map.
---
A single person? No. The game progresses, your team does gens and they leave while the timer ticks down to your inevitable death. 
---
Now, if the killer manages to block all 4 survivors then goes afk all day long then yeah, ban-able. The game can't progress since neither side are doing their objectives and the game is fully held hostage.
---
Imagine no matter what killer or surviver you are when you load onto the map you turn into a minecraft character version of yourself! That’d be awesome.
---

If I'm walking towards the hatch and you're still wiggling, I'm putting you on the hook right next to it instead. 🤷‍♂️ You could have lived but you chose death.

I dont like monto tbh. He seems like a real douche based on all the videos I've seen and it's a lot. I prefer Noob3 and hes a self procalimed toxic player but herdoesn't talk down to his audience. I also watch a lot of tru3talent and I think hes the best content creator in the dbd category, BUT I pretty much rely on hybridpanda for shrinewatch since I dont check the shrine every tuesday. Idk monto is my least favorite creator but I appreciate his content in the long run

---
fair, but what makes me an idiot? i want the reasoning.
---
Probably terrible connection. I’ve had it happened to me before and seen it happen to Killers who were doing extremely well. Idk if it’s dedicated servers that are messing with connections but it just seemed to pop up now since they came around.
---
1. Understand that being 20 hours into DBD is like being 5 seconds into a Call of Duty campaign.
---
2. Play Survivor to get BP that you can then invest in your Killers.
---
because there are now good people that link and mention the origins of the memes they posted. they're doing the entity's work.
---
Post proof of a killer getting banned for body blocking then I'll believe it, until then keep mashing that report lmaoo
---
It's a technical issue on their side, they postponed it. It should release on Tuesday with the mid chapter patch.
---
At least in that scenario you now have the end game collapse. Before the collapse update people used to have 30 minute hatch stand offs. XD
---
It's postponed one all platforms, no ETA. Hopefully, we'll get an update next week, but that's not even rumors, just a blind hope.
---
No they didn’t 😂

As a fellow Myers Main, I can agree that this has happened more times than it should. It’s always the same reaction too, they start to teabag and then hide around the corner or something.

I think you guys have to agree to disagree. Both sides have beneficial perks, neither of which give them a guaranteed win.

I had that exact survivor daily yesterday, I was so excited and jumped into a game as a survivor. End of that match I saw that I had it half done. Went to title screen... it was replaced by a random killer daily. I was so disappointed.
---
We'll make it is just a really nice perk to have imo, might not be the most efficient but I haven't tryharded since 1 year of release

noted. the thing is that I think he was afk for a while and I was using flashlight on him for like 5sec straight on the head and nothing happened. BUT it may be cuz I aimed mainly on head, not like you say between the shoulders and neck
---
Im sorry but thats weird as heck
---
Devs shipping killers r they gonna write a lore abt it too? Lol

I thought you were done, dork?
---
Wth?
---
I was sandbagged by a Nea a while ago. She wasn’t a good sandbagger though because I didn’t get caught luckily. I saved her with BT when she was hooked near an open gate and this little bastard still tried to get me killed by throwing a pallet on me when the killer was behind me with NOED. Luckily, I managed to vault it before getting hit and escape. I guess some people are just dicks.

---
You are the one who talked about TOS first. I simply corrected the wrong things you said with actual quotes from the TOS, because apparently you are not capable of searching "dbd tos" on Google. I also never said body blocking by itself is a valid reason for a ban
---
One thing that I always mention and what people fail to see when they ask to buff Calm Spirit is that when you shock or tier up (etc) people, when they're using Calm Spirit, it STILL gives the Killer the deviousness points on their screen! So even if you have it on, if the Killer is aware (See most red rank Killers), they will see that they hit someone even if it doesn't show the scream bubble.
---
This, in my opinion, is 100% step one of making it even *moderately* viable against the Killer it is supposedly best against: Doctor.
---
People can say "Oh but if you tier up it doesn't show the scream bubble so he still doesn't know your location". Well my little pretties, if you're in a chase as Doctor, knowing if you shock someone is very key to how a Doctor chases survivors at Pallets or a Window, specifically his pathing so he can optimise his route.
---
This is the step 1 change for Calm Spirit. The rest can come after like quiteter breathing etc. But this needs to be step one.
---
ROIGHT! Now i'll be having you replacing "god" with "Mathieu"
---
Janto Parkno
---
Nah they removed instant dropping after pick up when plague came out to fix this. In this clip you can see the huntress dropping the survivor after 2 seconds.
---
R/UnexpectedApexLegends
---
This wouldnt work alone bc ppl would be playing killers that synergize well, f.e. Doctor and Nurse, Spirit, Wraith. And dont get me started on the perks. If killers would get notifications from each others perks like if one had Infectious fright while the other walks around with distressing it would be overkill.
---
Nah, I don’t believe so, I have both and my PS4 has everything while pc doesn’t.
---
They can kick it as long as it's not at 0% and it's not regressing at that moment. They can do it an infinite amount of times. The myers situation maybe because he didn't fully destroy it; if you release destroy a teenie bit too early it doesn't count as a full kick and the gen won't regress

Otz and Puppers are my fav DBD players to watch

Is the original exactly the same or was it just a "template" for people to use?

I'm so proud...

It only starts regressing after the full break animation so if you stop sooner you abused a gen for no reason.
---
you're so fucked up in this sub guys.
---
every day we stray further from The Entity
---
What happend during the games? Where you looping then exceptionally well or doing something else? Otherwise I'd say keep his attention for as long as possible so that your teammates can genrush him and leave. It sucks for you but at least they get a bunch of points
---
Other idea: do you have TTV in your name? That also paints a target on you
---
Michael stalking people in the library since they can't scream in there. Big brain plays Myers
---
i would agree but ive faced otz a few days ago and he didnt want to say gg to me and his entire chat was essentially harrassing me for no apparent reason. i like otz tho but that kinda soured my experience with him
---
So what happens if we put Puppers, Monto, Bruce Campbell, and Kyle Gallner all in the same place?
---
I'm a bit newer to the game compared to the rest, what was the old Mettle of Man?
---
Rework early game overall like they did with end game, then you can adjust Ruin. M1-Killers are just too dependend on that few Minutes extra, especially on big maps. 
---
Personally i believe that ealry game pacing is one of the biggest problems in the game, hence the little possibilities and no additional objectives for survivors. It generates the "hate-sprial" imo, because: Killers get stressed, Gens are flying left and right... so the Killer gets frustrated, camps, tunnels. But that's just my 2 cents.
---
I don't feel as bad for laughing at this then xD. This is 100% not a mindgameable area, esp before and when a pallet is dropped
---
Except keys can't be used to find the hatch. And killer aura reading on the key already covers 32 meters so any plausible loop would get covered by default.
---
I do that all the time.
---
or object of obsession, against a ghostface its like just saying "pls tunnel the living shit out of me and then camp the hook until i die"
---
Why not
---
What happend exactly? I can imagine it sucks having 1k people jumping you

lol thanks, i knew i had something mixed up when i was writing it, its been ages since i have SWF'd so ages since we used open handed.
---
Ok sweet, I just always felt a little guilty like oh shit is this allowed?
---
Description checks out, also would be helpful for those who are laggy or just bad at skill checks, as long as they make it so it can’t stack if they do add it
---
No. Infact you can even farm with people if you wanted and not get banned. So if you can farm obviously letting the last person go isn't against the rules either.
---
And probably a random survivor telling you that you got reported for teaming with a survivor.
---
Had those so often as both survivor and killer, i lost count. 
---
Nothing happens with those reports of course.
---
I saw xD Ahhh, times like this make me see DBD as a comedy xD
---
he cant control what his viewers do, and some people cant see a joke name when it hits them in the face even though the joke name has some merit. you have some pretty big balls if you play killer without ruin and otz didnt use it so big balls on him
---
Ah ok thanks for clearing things up
---
I would agree, but drawing the aggro of a snares Freddy is never a good idea, no matter how good of a looper you are, he is a freaking beast.
---
There's a difference between a viewer **asking**, "Why didn't you run Furative Chase?"
---
And a viewer **stating**, "If you used furative chase it would've been zero terror radius"
---
I had a wraith a while back hook survivors in the basement and cloak while face camping the hooked survivor. I think I still have the screen recording of it but as soon as everyone caught on what he was doing they all DC’d. I really doesn’t  make the game any fun.
---
A saboteur survivor idea just doesnt work because its be too obvious. If you're working on a gen with someone and the generator randomly spikes downward, that's an instant giveaway. Especially if they are trying to sandbag and miss skill checks, etc. There's no point in trying to keep the puppet a secret.
---
Guess you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. It sucks!
---
Not really.... Monto’s an annoying prick
---
Or make it activate always, the TR was a restriction i imagine was put on old BT because it was once per match and the devs didnt want people wasting it. There is no need for it now that it is unlimited.

Just down someone and drop them on it, that's how I start a farm.

In the Fractured Cowshed with no hills, basement in the barn and the tree in the middle, you have exactly 0 possible spots

Where exactly do you stand to make this work?
---
If it doesn't break the game then the devs don't care
---
How can the killer lag like that? He's the host.
---
I have too many memories in general of being face camped, especially on PS4, it just draws people away from the game, myself included. It just felt like whatever I have done to not get face camped, majority of the time I'd get camped anyways. That's the only time when I d/c. I always feel bad as killer when I stay around a hooked survivor for a little because I thought I heard someone.

---
Good thing they don't spawn in LOS of survivors anymore!!1
---
I mean I guess if you like guaranteeing yourself a hook at the end lol, sounds great
---
I love the delicious taste of salty survivor tears when they say I was tunneling after a game where I kept finding them cause they ran Object Of Obsession and didn't know that you shouldn't run Object if you aren't planning on trying to distract me. If Im not doing something else, and I just see you over there to me that is just an easy find for a survivor to chase
---
Iirc move slightly to the left right after you hook, then turn away from the hook and do all the nods you wanna do. :]
---
Thankyou so much! I’ll get it done as soon as possible and post it, taking a break for now bc my neck is absolutely killing me.
---
Entitlement alert. LOL
---
Horrible perks you wot mate, just ESCAPE THE HOOK, that's perfect!  
---
This meme was made by Ace gang.
---
Possibly a reference to the Otzdarva video “BUBBA TRAIN HAS NO BRAKES”
---
Theres a few reasons its better to just drop survivors on the hatch:
---
1. Killers generally are faster than survivors, so they can cover more ground
---
1. It's faster to walk in a straight line than swerve around everywhere
---
1. The stun from survivors wiggling out slow you down
---
1. Survivors that wiggle out may not realise your giving them hatch and prolong the game by running or hiding
---
1. The killer has a greater chance of having seen the hatch beforehand since they spend the whole game on the move.
---
Thanks for the trapper tip.
---
rip you better change that key bind now :/
---
Yeah and they need to give him more cosmetics he doesn't have many .-.
---
Ehh
---
Yeah but you aren't asking people to pay you to watch that. I hope.
---
wholesome streamer btw
---
Not even Australian but good for them. They... \*sniff*... they deserve to win one, y'know?
---
You see us teacher mains are just trying to protect are students for it would be weird if they died before the next parent teacher meeting.
---
Bro he gets left behind so much that even newer people have more cosmetics then him and he is been out a lot longer.
---
&gt; Survivors do it *too*!
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Killers do it *too*!
---
Right? Like no shit. We don't need the exact same post on literally every single topic.
---
Or equal to the amount of players in a match.
---
Obsession sees dying light icon 
---
Obsession: dkcinf DCs
---
Yea that's messed up, and dont call me shirley.
---
Yeah, it's a known bug, but there is a way to prevent it from happening. If you want to make sure your dailies don't change after completing them, all you have to do is look at them (this is the time to trash any dailies you don't want), then relog. The dailies should be the same ones you saw before and upon completion they will work as intended. For some reason, relogging "locks" them, preventing them from changing mid-match. 
---
This is obviously a workaround and isn't a "fix", but it's how I make sure mine stay put. This has been a thing for a while now too, unfortunately. I think a great way to stop these kinds of things from happening would be to have a known bugs section in the client and ways to prevent them from happening, or ways to let the community know that abusing a bug is bannable. Oh well, maybe someday.
---
Gotta say not sure I like the direction the devs went with pantless Myers....
---
Myers does this ecstasy face when he stabs me
---
very cool. i would love that cod×dbd crossover
---
I can relate, the first time i tried to get to rank 1 i needed one pip and got three dcs, so the killer farmed with me and i got 2
---
I was thinking that she needs to watch the doors and not the totem and then the jake scared the shit out of me thinking it was Myers
---
The sad part is that they've sold over 5 million copies of this game at 30$ a copy which already is 150 million if we just take the 5 million and assume it as being an exact number of copies sold. Then take into consideration dlc. Which we can only assume that half of that number who bought the game decided to buy 3 dlc packs at 8 bucks per at minimum which is another 80 million (rounded up from 79,999...) on top of that.
---
230 million at a rough estimate has been made by just this game alone and that's not accounting for various microtransactions with auric cells for cosmetics. 
---
But yet people want to throw out excuse after excuse for them. With that kind of money plus the incoming cash cow because of  the stranger things and the switch version released there's absolutely no excuse for the game to be in the condition it's in now. "But dey r smol cumpani duuuuur" 
---
If you're making that kind of money then you can afford to hire competent staff to replace the incompetence that's clearly evident within the current staffing.
---
Happened to me today. Has anyone experienced that? Oh and sorry for the non-english commentary, but it's nothing important, just my confusion.
---
And all the gens are done meanwhile :)  
---
Unless it's me looping the killer, then all my teammates are urbanly evading around corners of a map.  
---
But still BL on Ormond is BS. Mt. Ormond is BS.
---
Nurse should be in Unforseen circumstances
---
Just think about it
---
Dedicated servers
---
Clown occasionally smiles
---
You can't throw down illusionary pallets
---
It's gotta be 100% what he's referencing.
---
Basically: Play with Your Food grants a token if you win a chase against the Obsession, because when you knock them down it counts as no longer chasing them.
---
Which means that if you have an instadown, you can one-shot the Obsession to achieve a net 0, no stacks gained or lost, each time you put the survivor down.
---
Farm Three Stacks of PWYF and equip speed addons for your Chainsaw, and you're chainsaw sprint is faster than fuck, it's basically impossible to escape from, and when you use it to knock down the obsession you STAY at three stacks to chase the next person.
---
It was already a good build, but then Furtive Chase came out. Which means, you can wait for the unhook, get a new obsession, run them down at unholy speeds, down them, hook them, repeat. You basically have +15% base speed *forever* and something like 160% movement speed with your power. It's nowhere near as OP as it may sound since it takes setup time and is vulnerable to pallets, but is insanely powerful if played well.
---
I've been stepping forward and slightly to the left.  Probably photobombing, but not as aggressive as the full facial photobomb.  I'm about to go see if there's a youtube tutorial lol.
---
Are you saying nurse should be buffed then?
---
Fixated is just gross. Seeing your own scratch marks is like drinking your own piss
---
Because they need the satisfaction of GIFTING the survivor the hatch. They will probably lose their shit if the survivor thinks they outplayed the killer by wiggling off.
---
Also in the basement on haddonfield

I told my friends to remove it from their build untill they fix it. Dead Hard is broken right now. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
---
Tru3talent made an amazing playstule on ghostface, basically he proves that stalking is not as good as going around and m1 people, and it works wonderfully well
---
Why is he so fast in the end?
---
I like how OhTofu absolutely hates blendettes
---
HEY HEY IT'S A LEGIT STRAT
---
&gt;if you don't hit Greats and are unlucky Ruin can make a generator take nearly double the time
---
Those times where you get a ruin skill check in the first two seconds of starting a gen 3-4 times in a row are infuriating.
---
Keep in mind you can unlock non licensed killers for free through playtime.  9000 Iri shards unlocks one of them.  Spirit, Plague, Legion, Clown etc....you don't have to spend money unless they're licensed.  And you get those shards a lot faster than you think.  I've purchased my last couple killers and survivors that way.
---
Totally relate! But sometimes I be aiming for the 4K, and when they don’t wiggle I feel bad, like, sorry dude I just gotta
---
I am in the bathtub
---
Happened to me, none of us could save anyone so everyone died on the first hook
---
Highly true, yesterday I just accepted my death and didn't fight it and for my surprise the killer spared me just because of that while I was the last person
---
I would tie it to two generators that when one of them is completed the ruin gets disabled. This would give the killer some guaranteed usage of ruin while it not lasting the whole game. It would also force survivors to work through the ruin instead of searching for it. 28% it’s gone after first gen, 33% for second, and so on.
---
I don't question why a killer has it.  
---
I question why it exists to begin with.  
---
\- A killer main boosting on survivors.
---
The purple addon now applys endurance only and the seringe now takes some time to heal (only one health state btw)
---
That's a loooot of reaaaading
---
You immediately get a random killer and seven generators pop into existence. Better get working
---
I mean we are just arguing semantics but tru3 never cries over survivors
---
Yeah I was looking for hours, but I started at around 27/8/2018. Adds up considering I stopped around the Halloween event last year and came back around endgame collapse release
---
Really depends on the time for me on switch, I can have nice ques where I will wait 1-2 mins max after each game, but later on it can be up to 20 mins and it seems there is about 6 players on haha.
---
Been a few times where I have been playing survivor and we're waiting on a killer for a while, so I will jump out and rejoin as killer it's that quiet lol.
---
Its a power thing for the killer. They only want you to escape if you know that it was off their back - then their ego doesn't come into question.
---
I'm saying 2 mechanics serving 1 purpose is ridiculous and silly. Great example of devs' incompetence
---
Glad I'm not the only one
---
Who cares if they wiggle or not
---
I love this!
---
Okay, so you basically say I shouldn't let anyone escape because I was trying to kill them earlier, ok.
---
 I was rank 1 p3 adam awhile ago. I only get to play 2-3 nights a month now. I'm not a hacker. I'm almost always between 16-20 now.

---

---
I see you are a person of culture as well...xbox mains rise up :)
---
I think devs should completely remove that 50% thing and that would be enough to make that perk stronger
---
Honestly I think people just forget that nobody is perfect. Otz is a great guy to watch, but thinking of him as of some sort of a saint will only mess with our own minds. We're all just people who don't have an infinite perfect mood and control over everything.
---
And this is a comment both for people idolizing Otz and for people who tend to harass other players in DbD.
---
It's actually a really good strategy for guaranteeing the 4th kill.  Eliminates the 50/50 from the gate check
---
Myers can get you so immersed in being a killer that it's amazing.
---
Also, it's almost Halloween, I recommend that if you get him, run a spook build where you have no terror radius and yoink people off generators.
---
'Tis the season for spook tactics!
---
And now ur post got deleted well done

Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah..... no.
---
Pretty good job so far
---
An it's people like you that make the devs stressed because they are trying their best to fix issues (that could have something to do with the power outage last week) and meanwhile they have to hear people whinning about how they cant wait three days without having them explain in detail what went wrong and how they are fixing it. You know how big this patch must be? The archives are a whole new system and requires a lot of work and hard checking to make sure it works correctly, that with the halloween event makes it more difficult to keep in time.
---
Give the devs one week and if nothing has happened and they havent given any information theb you can be angry
---
I have only watched a few of his videos in youtube and he is really good at this game. This post makes me want to explore his channel and discover why people here seems to make a protection squad for this man.
---
If you're too close to Ghostface your survivors own model can sometimes block revealing him
---
Plus if the killer returns they’ll need SB to ensure the safe unhook points in addition to that half a healing bar of altruism points.
---
I love the man, but these posts are starting to get annoying. At least make a meme.
---
But you got Iri Gatekeeper, that's rare these days
---
I hate SB on it’s own but combined with Fixated I’m loving it. Also somewhat decent counter to Spirit.
---
Seeing your own scratch marks sucks tho I’ve missed red stain a few times due to all the red scratch marks.

git gud

&gt; You do realise that the patches generally release without fail two weeks after the PTB begins right?

&gt; Like fuck me, stop commenting on my post because you’re fucking clueless.

&gt; You have no idea what you’re talking about, you’re just spouting shit and you’re wrong.
---
&gt; So fuck off.
---
&gt; Everyone knew it was due then, that’s why the event was pushed back, the Patch was expected on the 22nd, it wasn’t ready for some god unknown reason, the event got delayed with it.
---
&gt; Literally you must be a spastic or something if you’re not grasping this
---
lmao
---
And it needs fixing why? Just bad trap placement.
---
Noob but knows where to hit the flashlight. Amazing!
---
It's 5 lines, you'll manage I'm sure
---
Doctor is the least fun to go against imo. He's not OP or Broken, just boring as hell.
---
With this update I’m fully expecting what happened with the store where we ended up waiting almost a month for the damn update.
---
The company is a flop, they’ve been working on the game for over two years now, shit like this should not be an issue.
---
They’re just bad developers.
---
And I wouldn’t be so bothered about them delaying stuff if they weren’t so fucking greedy and cheeky as to have already released the damn event cosmetics but only for real money. 
---
Literally, so many apologists. I hope that McCote dick tastes good because you’re GAGGING on it
---
&gt;Plus they are French Canadians, meaning they are not native English speakers so they can't be expected to communicate too well.
---
They're a professional game company, not a tourist. They have PR staff, who very clearly know English. And the game they're developing has flawless English, aside from a handful of typos.
---
Honestly, that excuse is more condescending to BHVR than anything else.
---
This made my want to die
---
IMO I don't like the direction we are going with this system. I'm scared the game is just becoming about cosmetics
---
Aww thanks everyone I feel like a right hero 😎 I was panicking so much cuz the flashlight was taking so long to work 😂
---
Hex Ruin to ruin the killer's game just a little bit. (Sorry I had to...)
---
“There’s no counter to DS.” Don’t tunnel someone straight off the hook? The perk doesn’t last forever, and if they’re running straight at you, it’s pretty easy to tell that they’re probably running DS. Or yknow, slug them.
---
Also the adrenaline vs. noed argument just seems very biased. If you’ve got a survivor with adrenaline vs. a killer with noed, the survivors adrenaline wont really matter in the end, since you still only need a one hit. But I can’t be too sure, to be honest. It would depend on the survivor team and if they found hex totem, etc. Very environmental, and I will admit that I haven’t seen NOED wipe a team in quite some time, probably since I was just starting out the game.
---
Well i read it like him saying "if you want to do it yourself" means struggling and trying to get off shoulder.
---
Sometimes they coincide for me, e.g; Spirit and Plague are boring because they're impossible to counter (Plague literally gives you a choice of being constantly injured or giving her super goop and there's no way around it is what I mean) hence why they're low, but Clown is just so so boring to me, at least with M1 killers like Trapper you have the constant thrilling anxiety of stepping into a trap.
---
Since when Inner Strenght is not a hell of a good perk? 8 seconds to heal yourself! This is the best healing perk so far.
---
Damnit
---
I love playing against Demogorgons because of how intense it is being chased by this 9ft tall horrifying monster which can leap across the map at 300mph, while roaring every 4 seconds. The chase music is so “oh shit he’s after me” and that’s why I enjoy it
---
And because me and my friends have named him Greg and it’s funny to hear us shout “Gregs after me!”
---
Its funny that what these people think pr how they percieve the situation bugs you so much.
---
If you have an advantage, why are you here whinging? Are you trying to give them advice to play better against you?
---
What dc penalty can you please give me a source on that?
---
Release blood hunt cmmon.

In other news, man committed suicide while playing a video game.

One of the deceased's roommates gave a statement, in which he described he heard incoherent screaming from the other room. Another declared he heard a keyboard breaking over the desk and some babeling about "popping a weasel" and declaring he would be "dying lightly".
---
More at 6
---
I don't care if they wiggle or not- actually caring about it seems weird though
---
Like you're power tripping- "you only get mercy if you graciously accept defeat"
---
I can’t resist the D-strike if I have it tho so wheeeeeeee
---
You guys sound fucking annoying
---
So never.
---
nice, you didn't teabag thats rare these days
---
i love using head on with  quick and quiet
---
I literally said it´s a great perk in my post. What are you on about?
---
You know how few hackers there are in this game?
---
It does not. The icon stays lit until the Thrill totem is destroyed. There is no other notification the perk gives other than the explosion that a survivor has touched the totem
---
Hint: it's both.
---
Kyle Crane.
---
-Agile: Exhaustion duration reduced by 10/20/30
---
(Can run two exhaustion perks with this now)
---
-Creative:  When holding an item and interacting with an other (same type) item, the item will (if same quality) improve in quality or (if different quality) provide 2 addons gaurenteed the same level of the higher items quality.  The interacted item is consumed in the process.
---
-Contact GRE:  The killers terror radius sound changes to radio frequency static that grows louder when he is 10/15/20 meters close to you. This radio detection trumps all killer radius mechanics and ignores all stealth perks; cannot be heard by other survivors but can be heard by killer. When within half the range of the detection
---
Now that's a bloody good reason to love playing against a killer if I've ever seen one
---
Discrimination be like
---
I love watching him, but lets not make this a weird thing by idolizing him.
---
It could be worse. You could have been the P3 “doing gens, you?” Claudette.
---
I imagine he/she received a looooooooot of flak.
---
Lol no we are getting dedicated servers if you are on PC then you know they are already force testing them on us since I guess PTB has not enough players 
---
Sooner or later dbd will have dedicated servers and people will just have to accept it if the majority can get good ping
---
Dedicated servers are live right now on PC
---
If you *really* want to give them hatch let them wiggle. You cover more ground looking for hatch by splitting up
---
Spine chill works/lights up for an invisible wraith?
---
i was being taken to the hatch by the killer once in this situation, i am new to the game and even after i wiggles off, he picked me back up and brought me to the hatch.
---
Little information about Gregory: he likes Monster energy and eating cigarettes, some say he can smell tobacco from a mile away
---
Masturbation with extra steps?
---
No it's fine they loose two pips if they DC which will definitely be a harsh enough punishment to stop them! /s
---
Only if it's a cute dweet or Jeff
---
I think it’s a controller. Skill check said LB that’s Xbox.
---
*Literally* every week we've got a post about someone being banned for Unsportsmanlike Conduct, and these dipshits are seriously trying to pretend that reports don't work. Astounding.
---
Now he‘s grey
---
He's not saying hatch is easier than being hooked.
---
He's saying he doesn't want to be given a free escape, an "easy way out". He should earn the escape, or else die with the other survivors.
---
How do you lose progress to a power outage? Do they not source control their code?
---
are these shrines random?
---
U love this
---
That's a good point. By giving hatch, killers are sacrificing bloodpoints. So if survivors want hatch, they should sacrifice their wiggle bloodpoints, or else they sacrifice their free escape.
---
[lol](https://imgur.com/3rtyAdd)
---
Also applicable if you've ever played against me playing Iridescent King Doctor. XD
---
It's why I'm considering running Corrupt Intervention instead of ruin. Ruin at higher levels just gets cleansed way too quickly over 90% of the time. CI at least has a 2 minute effect.
---
Damn, you got me
---
Truer words have never been spoken
---
Don't play survivor. That's pussy. Play killer and learn how to deal with frustration and humiliation.
---
At least theyre fixing it instead of releasing a bugged event
---
dead hard buff
---
Ripley
---
-Ripleys Gambit: 100% chance of becoming the obsession.  When earning points in the boldness catagory if you have been chased by the killer for 60 seconds in a three minute period, any points that would earn the killer points instead are reduced by 50% and given to the player. (Meant to discourage friendly killers AND tunnelers)  Killers earn no bloodpoints while Ripleys Gambit is active and it does not end until 3 minutes have passed without the player being chased for 60 seconds (non-consecutive or concurrent).  The effect persists through death of the obsession until 3 minutes is up.
---
I'm not even gonna give her 2 more abilities bc this one is so fucking powerful especially if every player has it.
---
You level up the free battlepass thingy to get the serum by the looks of it, don’t take my word on it though because the image I saw could of been a fan made picture
---
It's also just unnecessarily wearing out the switches on your keys (or giving stick drift).
---
Side note: I'm frugal and want my products to last so don't always think like me 😂
---
Honestly killers don’t need that kind of buff. Stealth killers if they play it correct can still get those gen grabs... because they’re stealth killers and it’s already harder to detect them. 
---
Also gen grabbing should take SKILL not having an overpowered perk that makes it the new norm.
---
I once was the last person downed by a Freddy. He picked me up and I didn’t struggle and he started taking me into the direction of a hook and actually brought me pretty close to it. He ended up turning around the taking me to the exit gates and let me escape. I ran through some of his dream snares just before leaving as a thank you
---
I remember when he did this in the new Halloween film.
---
Headbanger Michael is such a mood
---
He's just patrolling
---
Not sure who's rank is lower, yours or killers. Wasting 3 great pallets on a 1 minute chase is the worst game play ever from a survivor point of view, you're too bad. The killer chasing with the nurse without blink lol probably a challenge like bk Myers? Too bad.
---
Assisted masturbation?
---
Ballin’, she be
---
&gt;Literally every week we've got a post about someone being banned for Unsportsmanlike Conduct, and these dipshits are seriously trying to pretend that reports don't work. Astounding.

I can't even be bothered to continue replying as they continue to downvote for some reason. People are cynical about the report system until it happens to them. Had a close friend get suspended 7 days for DCing to derank and that opened my eyes.
---
Great film now I have to find that
---
The Killer Rulebook for Survivors rule #241: Default clothes only. Dark clothes are too hard to see. Bright clothes are toxic.
---
Survivors are supposed to run away from the Killer. That's like the entire point of the game.
---
Dude you just posted cringe
---
I totally would!
---
Showing videos of Otzdarva to my friends is how I get them into Dead by Daylight, and it's what got me into it a few months ago myself.
---
Yeah, Monto is very good at the game...but you watch him when you want to watch DbD content.  Otz has these games that just transcend dbd, games where he's explaining his every thought and action and you're just sitting there thinking "Now this is big brain stuff" as he systematically kills entire groups of survivors.
---
And his recent video of Freddy vs a crazy optimal SWF showcases it.  40 minutes of strategic reasoning and gameplay to show you exactly what it means to be a great killer at this game and to show off what makes dbd a great game in general.

amen brother
---
I hope the additional revenue will also go to balancing and more quality of life features. Maybe a proper competitive sythem that could lay a path for some e-sport tournaments. 
---
I know they wan’t to keep the game casual. But if they copy the battle passes from other games, they might aswell copy the leagues that go with those most of the time.
---
Have you seen your memes?  Just meme templates with reddit captions
---
it cuts both ways to be fair
---
there are plenty of times when i cant stalk the survivor i can clearly see the top half off, yet they can break me out of stealth
---
 Due to unforeseen circumstances doesnt apply when they want your money
---
He proves that going around M1ing people is better than failing to stalk people. What he doesn't like to talk about are the times when it *does* work, and you actually get the instadown and cut the chase short because they will have no Dead Hard and no speed boost from the first hit.
---
Sounds to me like he needs to get better at moving around unnoticed.
---
I also do that for their death hook. If they don’t wiggle I’ll just drop them in front of the hook
---
Imagine taking someone saying cringe seriously
---
Tmw all of the pallets in the loop are fake pallets.
---
10000% accurate
---
Ds in late game is bs and literally on a somewhat bigger map until you reach the gate with the adrenaline speed boost it's already gonna be open and also noed has counterplay and can use a perk slot and not help with anything . And also if you down people too quick you will be punished by ds if you get to the same person you've hooked 40 seconds ago .
---
Yeah, i find it interesting that theres two like schools of thought where Tru3 goes for just stabbing people, wheras Otz likes to 99% people. I'm interested to see which is more efficient honestly.  
---
Personally i think stalking is more fun - but if they balance around it, with how buggy it is, i think GF will become a much weaker killer
---
Can you guys start working at behavior with this game???  These sound terrifying and amazing!
---
Not camping all 3
---
That's dirty man
---
You want a few wiggle points or a hatch escape? Make your choice.
---
1. No 2. No 3. No
---
The fear that struck in this man’s heart is hilarious.
---
That’s because generally you don’t get three good teammates
---
All 3 scenarios. No. Not camping.
---
Camping is when you have the intention of not leaving regardless of what other survivors are doing
---
I literally sweated so much, in so many games, trying to get the Adept Plague achievement only to be slapped in the face with "Brutal Killer"
---
That’s literally not at all what I said. Just simply running doesn’t make you safe. He can and will still stalk you. Not even attempting to reveal him is very dangerous.
---
The game is 4 v 1, it only starts being even at 3 v 1. So everything's on the table first blood.
---
Otz is a national treasure and we must protect him
---
Indeed
---
Honestly tho any reference to Jojo is a great meme. Thank you for this content.

Oz is so wholesome
---
I watch his streams and they are so informative on builds and funny when they don't play out.
---
Amen /s
---
IMO most tea bagging isn't inherently toxic. If its in the middle of a chase or right after a missed hit then yeah, but on the other side of a pallet then nah its fine.
---
Hag smiling is so cute
---
Can he find me a hatch so I can escape from my life
---
No no no no no, you don’t understand! The Last Year devs are working veeeeeerrrrry haaaaarrrrd on the steam release and are communicating more with the community... in a parallel universe that is
---
Who is that
---
Is that a Jojo’s reference?
---
How does he come off like a douche?
---
The last day it could feasibly come out this week is today, friday isn't usually an update push day because devs have weekends off, but with how incompetent they are i wouldn't be shocked to push late friday and have the game broke till monday.
---
honestly i see absolutely no reason not to just rework/remove OoO from the game. (I'm aware its being reworked for stealth killers - its not enough imo)  
---
it completely cripples some killers to begin with. Stealth killers aside, playing Trapper/Hag vs an OoO just feels miserable. If they're playing in a SWF it's pretty much game over unless you're significantly better than they are. It's not even a case of feeling like you're up against things that are tough to deal with like multiple DS, DH, Toolboxes etc - it just feels straight up unfair. 
---
Outside of SWF it just encourages tunneling, and if the person is good at chases you'll waste a huge amount of time on it. Obviously you could say to just ignore them, but then you dont *know* they're not in a group constantly telling the other survivors where you are. 
---
It just feels really unhealthy for the game
---
Theres plenty of shit players on either side, i dont get this its just survivor argument
---
That's not camping for all 3 seneriors
---
I don't think you need a 24/7 live feed of the devs doing things my guy lmao, its been 2 days.
---
This is why playing both sides is so important imo. Makes you more respectful as a player.
---
This is funny but if you had a pc I'd edit all their eyes closed in the first pic so in the second they look [STARTLED]
---
I had that with someone before, I went up to them and they were just t-bagging before I closed the hatch. They said they forgot Killers could do that, lmao
---
And thats exactly why its a shit idea.
---
i feel like SWF would be more manageable if it said who was grouped in the lobby. I feel like most games do this.  
---
i still think SWF is the primary cause of imbalance in the game, but i'm not foolish enough to think they'd remove it so this little step could at least help
---
This. Toxic players exist on both sides and it’s unfortunately but you can’t change people and while reports could be taken more seriously, I feel like in the current state of the game you just have to learn to ignore the toxicity and move on to the next march and report when you feel necessary
---
They get no points and get banned if they do it too much what more can be done than that. People DC if they arent having fun or a salty idiot.
---
Sydney literally did nothing wrong
---
The story here is that he mains survivor, and had no complaint. Only after switching to killer does he see something  worth mentioning.
---
I'm not very experienced with photo editing, I don't even know which program I would use, but thanks for the suggestion anyway :)
---
The whole point was that you couldnt get any distance with her fatigue. she only has about a seond more now til she gets her blinks back.
---
No to all 3 although I can see people getting a bit sweaty around scenario 3 since it means now the last standing survivor has to save his three teammates.
---
Scenario 2 could be camping if you hit the survivor that was unhooked and it could also just be perceived as proxy camping. Keyword being **perceived**
---
But still, no camping.
---
They should add an animation for survivors disconnecting like using the End game collapse animation or the pig’s trap going off where blood just explodes from their face.
---
Add a penalty for disconnecting like a 5min cooldown where you can’t join games which would slowly increase the more disconnects you do, going up to a maximum of 6hours before you get a is week ban and after 3 week bans, you’ll get a month ban and then a perma ban (maybe).
---
Something like CS but without the month cooldown because I accidentally shot my teammate at spawn
---
Have confirmed this the perk slippery meat actually reveals the dream pallet. Tested it with a friend
---
She, but yes that's exactly it. Obviously there's shitty killers. I've played opposite many. But I didn't get just how bad survivors can be.
---
Stop being cringe both of you and start being epic by stopping this
---
Yeah. 
---
Also Otz have been a little less chill the past few weeks, more easily tilted (even introduced a tilt-o-meter recently). I think it's in part because since the instaheals nerf announcement, a lot of survivors are spending their stocks of Syringe, which is understandable (better use them before the nerf, especially since you sometimes have huge stocks, I myself had to use around 30 syringe this month to empty my inventory). 
---
But still, you currently can't do a fucking red rank match without facing at least one syringe, just like as a survivor you get a lot more of omega blink ebony mori nurses. It's always like that before big nerfs, gets worse before it gets better. The few weeks before Legion nerf earlier this year were fucking torture.
---
Absolutely!
---
What?? Source ???
---
but unlike freddy's, those disappear once you get close
---
how?
---
Oink is right
---
Like what?  Aside from bodyblocking a survivor for the whole game or something. Id say thats more griefing/exploiting at that point.
---
How is GF the only killer whose power feels unfair to both sides? As survivor I'm like fuck this shit I cant even reveal him before he can mark me when I'm standing there staring straight at him.
---
Then I play as GF and I'm like how are these survivors revealing me in 0.5 seconds around a wall? His power is literally useless for stalking time to be a stealthy M1 killer. 
---
I think they need to just rework GF and make him more similar to how Tru3 plays him. No stalking, but just a solid stealth killer who can easily sneak up and get free hits. Obviously he would need some kind of buff of he could no longer stalk.
---
Although if you think about it, even without stalk GF is basically just a better wraith since he goes in and out of his power instantly
---
Yes its incompetent, but they are doing their best and have been spoiling us with regular and major updates lately that require tons of coding.
---
 Not all game companies care enough to create new content regularly for their players, just cosmetic and p2w updates. If you cant imagine the disappointment of this, you dont know disappointment
---
Possibly play with your food, he could still have 2 stacks, or he could be going normal speed and it just seems fast
---
Not otzdarva
---
When ash moris the entity
---
**G R O O V Y**
---
Completely agree, anytime I’m on for the 4k and had a good, non-toxic game I always shake the camera so they don’t wiggle, once we get close to hatch or an open gate I wiggle again and nod so they can break free if they have time, if not I drop them - good non-toxic survivors deserve the BP/awards as much I do if we’ve had a good/fun game and babies need the encouragement to stay and hopefully become great new additions to the community
---
That’s a big thonk
---
Nobody is debating, buddy. Just pointing out that I've obviously seen the discourse in the community, but never understood it because I never saw it. Until today. I keep giving people the win because they end up with 2 teammates dc'ing, which is just such bad form.
---
Still bought me one or two extra hits when survivor thinks there is a safe loop, but it isn't.
---
Who can say no to the Doctor's fantastic laugh?
---
Everyone I need your attention. We need to sign a petition for behavior to change the wiggle standards. If you agree reply to me and we can make a group chat for everyone who wants to be in it. Now what they need to change is when you break free from the killer, when you break free the killer should fall over and not be able to track footprints for 5 seconds. If you guys agree or have other ideas reply to me

They simply said “regarding nurse and wraith...  I think there’s something there.

In the case that you didnt read the other comments, Otzdarva, dbd streamer who used to play darksouls and other games

I generally respect Clauds who wear the bright pinks and such, but I see a P3 and there's no mercy. I don't have the patience lol

Doesn't everyone? Play Yamaoka's or swamp against them, chances are you won't see them all match.

DE\_Steve: Hey guys this is the cool new lighting I'm working on for Warframe, DE\_Rebecca just put up a post explaining we have 49 pages of patch notes for this update we just delayed, we're working on it hard as we can!
---
Lmao yes.
---
Not camping for all 3 of those.
---
You right dude. In the near future I'll drop this game too. I am tired of this behavior of behavior. For stress, yes , one dude as a killer (Billy) tunel one person for 4 gens, and we of course did a gens and easily escaped, in chat killer types "gen rushers" xD community, bugs, behavior of all devs and people, game that become game-service this bad. So dude you really right ! I am not quit for now but for a near future...
---
Duck slippers or riot✊🐣🐣
---
The day I stop wiggling is the day killers stop dropping me near the hatch just to make me watch them close it. I now have killer trust issues.
---
Otzdarva
---
Probably around 1-3%
---
Your argument just proves that the particular person is invincible for 1 minute , it can only be slugged .
---
Damn that’s good
---
You are wrong.
---
Nc. Wanted to see this but his stream starts during my work shift.
---
How come
---
Wiggle = maybe a couple hundred. Hatch = 5k for living and 2.5k for hatch. Not gonna bother considering greedy wiggling
---
Lucky for you, you can unlock the perks for other characters then you can slowly dump points into them to get their perks unlocked.
---
It's really annoying though. Had a bad match where 1 guy DC'd at the start, 1 person killed themselves on hook, I did the only gen and the other guy died immediately. I had already been hooked so they had my stack.
---
Sat at the exit gate as soon as last person was hooked for literally like 2-3 minutes, waiting for them to close hatch. Had an open gate daily too. Said fuck it, went to find hatch. Dude was just standing on it cloaked, closed it, then hooked me.
---
No fucking chill.
---
How can you get oppressed by something you'll never see?
---
Are you me? I thought I was me.
---
I... yes?
---
I’ve stated multiple times that I’m not saying these perks don’t need balancing,
---
Even stated that DS is around to prevent tunnelling.
---
Your best course of action is to leave that person alone for one minute.
---
I’m not sure what you’re getting at here.
---
I completely agree with you...he is my fav. to play against!
---
This is so sad, I have already made a post similar to this but yours gets more fucking attention
---
Or literally anyone else that isn't immersed Adam.
---
Dropping a pallet can be a bit tricky though. If you stun Plague with a pallet, she'll lose her Corrupt Purge.
---
Oh man, you give them a lot of chances.  If they dont wiggle, hatch.  Wiggling at all gets them a hook.  No chances.
---
Hey, whoever dislikes this guy, dude just wanted to make sure it's legit. You can't know these days. dud doesn't deserve dislikes for being cautious
---
He stops the vid a few times to explain certain plays, and at the end takes a moment to finish up, AND the gameplay doesn't start immediately. So the game takes 15-20ish minutes. He ran Unicorn Block, Jump Rope, Ruin, Corrupt Intervention, Pop and Discordance.
---
It’s no different than people meme’ing. 
---
If you don’t like it, sorry, but it is part of how some people play.
---
Most played is more like 7 because you counted 3 for 1.
---
I don't explicitly hate them, but yeah when I see a 4 man blendette lobby, I expect pixel hunting
---
Yes and to quote myself exactly, “I’m not saying these perks don’t need balancing.” If you maybe read my whole comment...
---
And being tunnelled is also bullshit? That’s why I said that it was made to counter tunnelling, because that’s the truth. Yes, it’s not a fun perk to run against, but also slugging or leaving one person alone for ONE minute, really isn’t that much to ask, I think.
---
Late game is a bit harder, but like I said, slugging works, and most killers slug the last two survivors to prevent hatch escapes anyways.
---
I mean. It's the objective to kill all 4 though?
---
r/madewithmematic
---
Legion
---
LF with PWYF is actually pretty deadly.
---
As a Huntress main who mostly no kill farms, it gets real old when ppl sprint around the exit while I'm just trying to get like 1k bp per throw before they go. Then they just bail when I go to reload. Love people like you who just give the free points and let it be
---
Leatherface.
---
Clown is okay, he still shreds through pallets he just does nothing else.
---
base game or multiplayer?
---
simple rule
---
if they wiggle, just hook them

whenever anyone offers salty lips me and my brother scream "VIGO'S JAR OF SALTY LIPS!" over and over

Don't think anyone actually watched the vid and saw it was Haunted Grounds...
---
two steves in the game and survivor looking similar to the killer?
---
Alex would most likely take the survivor spot
---
Welcome back to kek or cringe with BHVR
---
We talking best add-ons no add-ons? Perks?
---
Puking is a cheap tactic to make weak killers stronger
---
You still "win" if 1 dude gets hatch/ escapes through gate before 5 gens ever got done.
---
Like in the real spirit of things, winning chases matters more than kills.
---
I've only been playing for a few weeks, so this is all news to me and I've got a few questions:
---
1) do you have a 50% chance of freeing yourself from the hook if you're the last survivor?
---
2) why does this not work for Claudette?
---
Thanks in advance!
---
*laughs in iron grasp and Agitation*
---
you can do that in MS Paint. it's easy enough
---
I take this as a personal attack
---
white, black, gray

No add on, no perks

Knuckles : Cracked
---
Hex: Expected Hatch
---
The last survivor in he match becomes your obsession. Your obsession can see the aura of the exit Gates and the hatch when they are within 15 meters of them. You can see the area of your obsession when they are within 40 meters of it. Only one obsession per match.
---
*"Get siked, bitch!" -Killer*
---
Haha I thought it was more like see me as a killer in their home hence why I said I don’t know what you’re talking about
---
Well that's just a downright lie. It may not be as commonplace as a killer giving hatch. But survivors DO give killers kills at the end of games. I personally have done this.
---
I thought you decided to use Jeff's mesh not Quentin's.
---
Eh. I can't read his mind. He wanted another 4K under his belt, needed the extra BP, or i'unno.
---
Because I'm giving this to then out of my own kindness and they wanna make it harder for me? I'm not gonna be so kind.
---
One time I was playing killer, I downed a dude but heard a gen (it was pretty loud) so I left him downed, the person then DC'd, when they explained themseves, they said that I was tunneling... because there were other people to kill other than them... they ended trying to tell me that I should always go for the chase as Hillbilly because I can end chases quickly (Which isn't ALWAYS true), rather than going for people who can do gens. I was speechless, This dude honestly thought I was tunneling after I downed him because he was doing a gen...
---
Those killers are what we in the killer world call "massive cockheads"
---
Thats a no on all counts
---
Fucking love this show
---
Aren’t you a joy to be around?
---
&gt;How is GF the only killer whose power feels unfair to both sides? 
---
*Laughs in Huntress*
---
If its on the other side of a pallet they could be running away or attempting to loop to buy time/survive. All teabagging on the other side of a pallet does is tell the killer you have a hook fetish and the pallet suddenly shatters.
---
If it’s to agro you so their pals can get away/buy time then I don’t mind, altruism. (never happens with pallet teabaggers from my experience, they just like trying to toy with me, even going as far as dryhumping me during endgame collapse which results in their demise)
---
I cant reliably hit greats, but i'm starting to learn fairly well where to look for totems.  
---
So it prohibits me from blasting through gens via brute force, but doesnt take me years to find the totem. I feel like this is how its supposed to be (i'm like rank 7/8 survivor). But below me its just unstoppable because survivors cant find it, and above me it can just be ignored
---
Depends, for me. Yeah, I could have killed you. Hook, simple as that you fucked up. You fucked the family pig, and if you're gonna struggle? Yeah fuck off, no escape for you
---
You forgot the B.2 addendum : Nea and Claudettes absolutely not allowed whatsoever. Warrants an ebony mori and tunneling. Ideally, you should only play vanilla Adam Francis or Dwight.
---
Welcome to hell
---
**now get back to survivor while you still can before the lust to constantly catch people with 8 STBFL tokens and bear traps keeps you there, trust me ya don’t wanna be here too long!**
---
Please tell me that’s people screaming in agony and not people having sex on the sweatshirt
---
I play nothing but killer and I have great games where everyone is chill after... and then... there are the other games....
---
The ones that make you think to yourself "Gee it must be nice to be able to have people to play with and use an exploit to communicate in a game THAT WAS NEVER MEANT FOR IT!" The people who come loaded for bear and just wanna bully someone else. 
---
It makes you wonder if they could even play the game by themselves without the crutch of that headset giving them info constantly.
---
I don't care if you salty mofos downvote me. A lot of you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about and now so do you OP.
---
Oh? I'm sorry is choosing to let a survivor escape when you could hook them easily  NOT merciful?
---
It's not as though 4K's are hard to obtain. With like mediocre skill or just behaving like an asshole you should be able to squeeze a 4K out of most of your matches, with how bad a lot of survivors are lately.
---
And unless you're not maxed out on deviousness the 4k doesn't earn you that much more points.
---
wHAT DO YOU MEAN, MOOOOM? LOOK AT THIS P3 CLAUDETTE! IT'S A LIKE A TROPHY FOR ME

judging from my experiences in a majority of games, yup.

Run around with a perverted scout loadout crouching, throwing milk while looking straight down next to teammates and enemies then killbinding and saying “I creamed” in chat with a conscientious objector that has ribbon girl saying “ram my ass”? Check.

Reminiscing on metal arms: glitch in the system? Check.

Helping people beat expert missions and parallel quests in xenoverse 2? Check.

Hiding behind a tiny rock just right to evade killers in DbD to hook rescue after their terror radius becomes mute and it’s clear they won’t be coming back anytime soon? Check.

Not killing friendlies in tf2? Check.

Making stupid lists just because I think it’s funny or just plain fun? Check.

For good reason, what a cunt. A leatherface tried to do this to me once but he topped it off by whirling around with his chainsaw. When he started walking me towards the hook I said fuck that and dc’d. Only time I’ll dc.
---
Only got to episode 6 or something, straight up dobt want it to end
---
valek
---
It’s not paid and free content. It’s literally just free content. You buy for 1000 auric cells and you get 1000 back as you play through the ‘battle pass’. Idk why people are not understanding that.
---
It's his fault for being toxic
---
If its on the other side of a pallet the killer hasn't started breaking the pallet yet, cause if i run then he just follows, the teabag is to let him know hes not gonna get away with a free hit till he breaks this pallet or looped twice.
---
OoO players tend to lean more toxic side. They also tend to be over confident. The longer you ignore them. The easier they become to down when the time is right.
---
otzdarva is the speedwagon of dbd
---
If it ends up bugged this statement will be laughable and made fun of

**so let’s hope it’s actually fixed**

I like it cause maybe the guy being chased wont come to you while the others may help

Outlast lockers in a nutshell
---
Lol. Sure.
---
I'm hoping it will, so that the story of the offering comes to life..... Oh yes....
---
And after that, he's still able to not be a complete tryhard and destroy casual survivor groups who just want to play the game like him
---
New template time.
---
Only have episode 8 left... I'm afraid to watch it and have it end on a bad note
---
Wiggled anyway and escaped multiple times. Fuck your advice mate ✌💁👍😝
---
Some of the ideas in this thread have been Sam and Dean Winchester, Ripley, Joel... these are all certified badasses. I know we have Ash, David, and Bill already, but personally I'm against adding more Survivors that could easily handle Killers like Legion or Plague so easily (Really only certain killers like Spirit, Demogorgon, potentially Freddy would ever pose a threat.) because then it's like we're not actually getting them added, just whimpy versions which kind of defeats the purpose of their addition in the first place ...And I'm not a fan of the "Well the Entity has rules..." excuses, like no, go away Entity, you're not interesting just because you're vague. This game is about Killers and Survivors, the Entity is only there to justify Survivors respawning.
---
I'd rather get more original characters: They've improved their ability to make original characters immensely. I really want to see what else they can do. Characters like Rin and Jane are infinitely more interesting than the Wraith and Meg. If they were to add another licensed Survivor, I'd like to see another like Quentin or 1978 Laurie Strode: Mostly defenseless, just like they would be in-game.
---
Yeah I agree. I’m perma red rank and I see a massive difference in between ruin and not. People might say it’s not needed but idk how you will legit lose all your gens in 4 minutes lol
---
Otz almost singlehandedly got me back into DBD. Dude is so positive and wholesome. Love the guy. Plus he’s damn good!
---
Sometimes they pick you back up and carry you to the exit so you can open it yourself. I understand wanting the hatch closure points if you’re giving up hook points.
---
I found it in the top posts of all time section of Meme Economy if you want it, template is in the description, have fun
---
Thanks, btw what do you mean by immersed?
---
You hate to see it lol
---
I just say let players play however they want. At the end of the day, it is a video game, a damn good video game.
---
PSA FOR KILLERS: Swing your weapon at a wall while shaking your head once or twice, if they still wiggle, kill em, if not well you know what to do
---
Because this is a weird power trip.
---
I do this with every good series, refuse to watch last couple of episodes lol
---
Jeff gang gang
---
The problem is also that they can't add really good gen-stalling perks to replace ruin because... people wouldn't replace ruin, they would just add the new perk on top of ruin. We already have Ruin/Corrupt/PGTW builds and they're just unfun to go against.
---
Considering that, I guess that base gen speed is key to the issue, but I also understand it can be hard to balance since nerfing base gen speed would basically impact white/yellow ranks (where survivors are way less effective at pumping gens) way more than red ranks.
---
The current situation is a bit sad gameplay wise, but according to the latest statistics earlier this year, it at least led to a good overall balance (all around average 50% survival rate, so 2kills/game, closer to 60% at red rank and 40% at white ranks). I'm afraid any big change to that would completely fuck up those numbers.
---
Dedicated Servers back at again
---
got fixed
---
It’s starting to turn into Last Year the Nightmare.
---
I have no idea why youd even play that match out
---
How are they supposed to know they’re getting the hatch? Mind reading?
---
Survivors are literally just playing the game.
---
You see killers that give the hatch at purple/green ranks. At red ranks 95% of the killers won't give you the hatch. Because at red ranks playing killer is often very stressful and there are a lot more toxic survivors.
---
That's just a bad Left Behind with a huge downside
---
Indeed, hense why it's a killer perk
---
Wow. I’m at a loss for words. Can’t even think what to call you? Boring and annoying? Video game nice guy? Just old and unfunny? You radiate so many energies it’s confusing but I also stick to my statement. I’d rather drink grape bleach than be in the same company as you.
---
/r/instant_regret
---
I feel like this is going to become an outdated rule when they implement the wiggle BP
---
I'm likely finishing this one today or tomorrow but yeah, I get this sentiment.
---
Mhm, what if they are going for merciless. I’m never angry I get hooked, but I don’t wiggle because usually no point as last survivor, and I like to see if the killer is friendly or not.
---
camping is purposefully staying on the hook just so they move to the next stage. if there’s a survivor near or you go back after the unhook it’s not camping
---
Everyone using them up before they're nerfed lol
---
Im prettt sure thats on your end
---
The fact that it's a pretty well known thing in the first place?
---
 The fact that I shake my head a couple times/swing at the air?
---
My bad, missread
---
The match was fine until this happened :/
---
Yeah i hate that one, almost have to use a red addon for a stupid daily. 
---
Should be changed to just expose any survivor 4 times to lign up with the other killers dailies, or bump up the BP to at least 60k
---
I swing 3 times at the air or a object and if they are still struggling they gotta die
---
Oh I know why. It's still intolerable
---
Ethernet bro shit made me lose all traces of lag
---
PS4 :p
---
We dont really see the fun in it plus they could RQ .-.
---
One time I had 16 it was crazy lol
---
Honest question, how are survivors supposed to tell if the killer is being merciful? This just feels like a power trip.
---
Idk imagine releasing a lore abt killers being together :|
---
I promise you, the season finale does not disappoint
---
The other side of this is ruin being in a really good spot and dominating survivors who can’t deal with ruin
---
Noob3?
---
Rank 1 in 3 days damn that its impresive or sad or both
---
Can confirm this is the torch girl xD
---
On the contrary, I personally will not give hatch to the last survivor if they just “give up” only if they struggle to the very last.
---
Yes, kids favorite reddit streamer
---
If I can 4k in a match everyone goes free that hasn't been killed. Normally that means 2 but can mean 3 or 4.
---
Well that's some reassuring and seemingly unanimous verdicts. Thanks folks! 
---
I guess I will have to work on not getting tilted by post game chat, but at least I know I've not been accidentally camping.
---
That's what i did when i switched to Steve
---
Maybe it’s because I lagged or glitched and started zooming around running super fast one match so the demogorgon really hated me! 
---
Also one match I sabotaged hooks right as killer was carrying survivors to the hooks and got two survivors to get away from him so when he saw me in end game he dropped a Claudette and gunned it for me.
---
It didn't. Just saw a video made a month ago and it's still working.
---

There was no change to spine chill in the last month, I'm sure.
---
I’m gonna be honest. I’m a killer main but have played a lot of survivor lately because killer is too stressful sometimes.
---
The amount of facecamps and tunneling I experience are absolutely ridiculous. Killers can be VERY toxic. The worst is when they have NOED
---
I never use NOED as killer, but I’m for sure never touching that fucking perk again. Jesus Christ it’s too fucking broken. 
---
I’m rank 7 btw. I learned a lot from the survivors I go against. It’s actually a lot of fun
---
I think the footage is sped up. the hooking animation, and the entity taking the survivor seem to be fast as well.
---
Where is this from?
---
Aye and I doubt they can hack into your keyboard
---
Pig and legion are fun as hell tbh
---
Hiding in grass because she's hard to see. Its really annoying knowing that there's someone nearby but you cant ever find them
---
German, sorry :)
---
Glad to hear!
---
If I get the devour on you, there is no mercy.
---
Thanks for making me laugh on the toilet. Now everyone in the bath section of Home Depot thinks I'm a god damn weirdo.
---
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I was playing last night and in the lobby when I returned it just came to me and I was really excited so I posted here.
---
What show is it?
---
I had two matches in a row with the same Meg running OoO who straight up ran to me in the beginning of the game and when I ignored her she disconnected. Twice. Those ppl I stg.
---
I normally shake around and swing ti try to get them to stop. I brought a cypress but I heard the hatch open (didn't actually gear the hatch though) so my girlfriend told me to give him watch. After the third time he wiggled out i was annoyed by his shit and to use my cypress
---
I got sabotage 2 hooks for survivor yesterday, did a few rounds of killer to finish my 2 killer dailies. When I decided to go eat dinner I closed the game for a bit. Came back to have my survivor daily disapear and replaces with chase a survivor for 180 seconds with nurse like wtf?
---
classic cant defend yourself move
---
Maybe ghostface with discordance I guess
---
I've seen survivors escape during the closing animation was that lag or is it a feature?  Surprised he didn't escape while it was closing if that's how it works.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dmfudr/can_someone_explain_obsession/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Grabbing doesn't take skill though. Grabbing literally depends on if the survivor is oblivious to their surroundings.
---
I too work at a home depot, so i feel your pain!
---
You are automatically sacrificed if you're the final survivor.
---
Tbh I haven’t really had any problems. I play docked mode exclusively. I did one game on handheld but I like a bigger screen for this game. 
---
I’ve played for over 200 hours so I’ve played a lot of games. Things seems to running just fine on my end.
---
where am i being an ass. can u quote something?
---
That's terrible
---
"Die Blendy!"
---
He played against a killer recently who he was familiar with who mains Blendette as survivor. They apparently mori each other back and forth, it was really funny.
---
I think we really don't need another Dead Hard perk, when most people would consider it one of if not the strongest exhaustion perk in the game, and this is basically the same. People generally use DH the exact same way they use this - to gain distance for a vault/pallet. So what's the point in a perk that's the exact same, except it's non-injured vs injured?
---
I mean I don't think anyone would ever use this over DH anyway, because you generally don't want to use your exhaustion perk until you really need it, and you don't really need it when you're not injured, unless you're up against a 1 shot killer, then it might be useful
---
Takes the aggro? Killers are't NPCs they can use common sense and not go after their obsessed...
---
To further expand, super heroes have been privatised by a large company and are often locked behind corporate bullshit.
---
Yeah, I’m someone who’s new to plague and the games are so much easier when you don’t cleanse. 
---
Sure don’t cleanse initially, but you can definitely lose pressure going to get the corrupt. Also make me get the hit. It isn’t like cleanse = auto lose, I feel like people treat it like its completely busted. Its not, just play smart against it and you’ll be fine.
---
Myers tier 1 (very hard cause slow as hell and big boi)
---
Ghostface
---
Pig
---
And a bit of luck
---
True that would be better
---
I never said I *work* in the bath department. I just like to stop in and sample their products.
---
If you wiggle against me you're gonna go on the nearest hook available. If you don't wiggle I'll probably try and find the hatch if I'm not in need if max blood points.
---
It’s situational but it sounds fun to use to like make it to an area you can’t reach and clutch
---
Cool! Thanks, I'll have to check it out sometime.
---
Yes, you were camping because you were still on the map while the survivors unhooked.
---
In all seriousness though, don’t worry about whether or not you were camping. There’s no rule against it, and in some situations it’s necessary to either confirm a kill or if the survivors are rushing the hook. Salty survivors just like to complain when they lose.
---
Not bannable just a dick move
---
If you own him, Ghostface can do a solid job while using nightshroud, you just have to approach rather carefully to ensure you’re not seen, similarly wraith with coxcomb clapper and ghost add ons can also do it well.
---
Sorry I can't hear York behind my wiggling meta perks
---
Usually the dribble you if they are gonna give you the hatch. But I've had some dribble me just to kill time so the entity can get me when the time runs out.
---
Let's just all stop complaining and be more positive and friendly.
---
I find that miles more productive than complaining about the one or the other group
---
This isn't fucking psych 101 dude maybe we just want to be nice and help other people have a good game
---
I’m saying skill as in it should be harder to have happen for that reason. The proposed perk buff would make it easier to sneak and grab someone — which imo you shouldn’t be able to do as easily. Also grabbing does take some skill if you’re smart about it certain killers can really be stealthy and sneak up.
---
Otz and Tru3 say a lot of the same things about the game, but Tru3 is a salty bitch and Otz is nothing but a lump of sugar for some reason...
---
I actually feel sorry for uploading this. I'll delete it in a few hours, first I wanna make more people regret opening Reddit for today
---
Lets not start this shit again please
---
I think this would be a bad idea. I understand where you're coming from but it would be far too easy, when there's two survivors left, for one to abandon the other when hooked just so he or she can get the last survivor bonus.
---
Ahh damn, good thing everyone gets in at rank reset and quickly smashes their way back up to high ranks right away.
---
It does get above 30 though. Let's not overreact here
---
try using surveillance on a stealth killer. it makes it so you can tell if someone is on a gen way easier.
---
Spook hours are here
---
Ghostface is probably the best way besides using prayer beads.
---
Apparently we're supposed to be mind readers? I never wiggle anyways if I'm the last person alive, because I get into the "let's just get this over with" mentality, and in all my hours of playing I've never gotten a mercy hatch. So either this is a lot less common that people are making it out to be, or I've consistently gotten killers with no mercy.
---
Imagine making of someone who joined the game late. Also people who had legacy but had their accounts glitch out.
---
It was just a joke that fit perfectly with the character from the Boys. I wasn't trying to start anything, pinky swear &lt;3
---
okidoki
---
Both sides can fuck off. I’m a killvivor main!
---
I hate new people dont mind me
---
Well that smash only affects a survivor if they are like right in front of you, and has a slight charge up
---
I did it in a few ways.
---
If you're in a chase NEAR a generator, try leading your target to the gen. If there is a surv working on it, pretend they're not there and keep focus on your main target until you're close enough for a grab on the other surv.
---
Might not work as well for you as it did for me but here it is anyway.
---
Good luck :)
---
Which killers can be "really stealthy" and sneak up against very aware survivors?
---
 When pig uncourches, you hear her blade.
---
When ghostface is on stealth and moving, you can hear the sounds of flags waving in the wind.
---
You can hear Michaels breathing.
---
And when demogorgon comes out of a portal, you hear loud footsteps. 
---
Getting grabbed is entirely based on the survivor.
---
Forget it all by snorting ketamine, we must
---
The Special Edition By Vigo, this ketamine is
---
Fun, this will be
---
I really want a 2 killer gamemode but how to ballance :/
---
Play survivor lol
---
Tbh i kinda like rank reset as killer. I Just manage it so that I don’t pip too fast and get games to try out meme builds. Sure I’ll get some sweaty swf death squads, but I can sometimes get em and its not the end of the world if you don’t. 
---
Survivor though? Yeah fuck those games. Lower rank teammates not playing or reacting as I would expect my normal rank team mates to, God rank killers, even baby killers, all of this doesn’t really make for fun games. Lot of frustration hours immediately after reset here
---
I really love it. This is great!
---
For me, it takes a lot longer to que a game with killer than survivor. It sort of forced me to be a survivor main.
---
You're something like a year too late. The game has been just about cosmetics for a long, long time now. The only reason we even still get DLC anymore is because of the potential for cosmetics. It's why normally licensed characters that didn't have cosmetics are now magically starting to get heaps of cosmetics; hospital gown Myers, Pig outfits and unique weapons, Ash Williams getting new cosmetic sets, so on and so forth. 
---
The game has always been about selling you cosmetics, it's just now it's more noticeable because whereas they used to release a set or two every handful of months, now we're getting several sets every month without fail, and they now come with enticing new artwork to showcase them outside the game. So even if you're not looking for it, you're going to stumble across it somewhere. Production has cranked up, and this is the new state of the game.
---
Luckily, you don't have to buy the cosmetics if you don't want to, but then you can't run around as Scoops Ahoy Steve Harrington, you penniless slob.
---
L
---
Yeah Ghostface was 100% at fault. The others, debatable.
---
FFFFF  
---
F  
---
FFF  
---
Yet they both are also doing it....that is modern live service games and honestly I'll take battle passes over loot boxes any day
---
Yep you'd be correct
---
I like when they wiggle a little bit and then stop. Makes me feel 10 feet tall.
---
Because the objective for killers is to kill all 4 survivors, regardless of points. as a survivor, it doesn't matter if you're the last one, if your team sucked or any of that. you're not entitled to the hatch, and you're not entitled to survive at all. Being salty about that makes all of us survivors look bad. take the hook, take your points, and move on to the next match.
---
Holy shit that's awesome!!!
---
Nobody said they lost everything, unless I missed something. They lost progress.
---
What I love about Otz is how he plays DbD like it's chess
---
I'd say Meg or Laurie overall
---
Absolutely beautimus!!
---
Hag players are the worst with this. Their first move 90% of the time is to go set a trap by the totem
---
They did ghost dirty just like they did Gaz dirty
---
flip flop moron
---
Ghosty or mikey are your best bets
---
But this is the fact, all battlepass system are structured in way that you have to play the game to earn stuff, if you know that you haven't that much time to in est on the game and you are not a dickhead you are not going to buy it. that's it, I don't see the problem
---
I love how he zooms away in the end
---
A streamer's chat can definitely ruin watching that streamer. I tried watching a streamer unrelated to DBD a few days ago, and I said something in chat that was blocked. I got into an argument with someone who called me a dumb ass for no reason, and later the streamer saw it and talked to us about it. I apparently said something wrong (I said it was my first stream, when there was a stream in July I attended for a few minutes and left a comment). His chat immediately started spamming how I was a dumb ass, and how I was "Exposed". The experience left a sour taste in my mouth, and I haven't attended his streams since.
---
This is the worst fucking thing I've ever seen, thank you for posting this.
---
That already happens with hatch though, and 1k points would be only slightly more than what you would get for struggling.
---
&gt;"It's not paid. You have to spend money to access it, but it's not paid."
---
Yikes.
---
I understood their question
---
Yeah, I know the error of reinviting, but thats actually not that bad.  
---
I am playing with a friend most of the time and he is having the suffers from purple textures as well (from time to time) and also says the framerate is less than ideal.
---
What I am wondering about is that he plays docked all the time and he doesnt suffer from lags like I do. So I am thinkin to remove and reinstall the game once more.
---
Have you installed it internally or on an SD?
---
Why would I trust this though?
---
The one time this happened to me, the killer was trolling. They placed me next to the hatch but when I starting crawling, they would pick me up and put me back where I started.
---
Killers are scum that can't be trusted.
---
Hard to see
---
The upcoming ones dont include him either its depressing .-.
---
I usually give people hatch if they either got really far but didn’t quite escape, or got merk’d immediately into the match. Also sometimes if the team is really good and I know I’m not gonna get any of them, I just kinda meme on them. Like smack the bell a bunch at them and it usually ends with everyone having a gay ol time at the exit gates blinding me and getting a bunch of blood points. Everything is right in the world at that moment.
---
Sadly never happened to me. They make me watch them close the hatch, bleed out for 2 minutes while they run around hitting random objects, then hook me and give me one last hit for good measure :( I know that's just bad experiences though. A lot of killers are nice!
---
Freddy and Frank look like shounen antagonists
---
Bubba looks like the vibe check emoji
---
Kenneth looks like he is about to call a downed survivor pathetic
---
Lithe is life
---
Corner of the map. More specifically, grass
---
Gen rushing is annoying af but it IS the objective of the game. Being toxic, yeah fuck off, and playing with DS is perfectly fair, DS is actually a weak perk imo. Camping is unfair, tunneling is unfair, and ebony Mori is un-balanced. Pretty sure survs win here.
---
Better gamer won
---
nnnnyeaaaa ur right there killers have it kinda easy at this point just really weird to me that I'm mentioning a bug and all people are talking about is Noed.
---
Wait, really? Fuck I forgot to check that week. Guess I grinded the Hag to 35 for nothing then last week.
---
That "boss is a killer" thing needs a explanation
---
As killer last survivor has a choice. Wiggle and get hook or be still and we go on an adventure to find the hatch... The choice is yours, live or die!
---
I spin. If you spin back when downed, you live
---
"The sacrifice"? Ballas wants to know your location
---
This is terrible advice. You just described someone who doesn't know how to use sprint burst and then gave that as the proof for why you shouldn't use sprint burst. Good players know how to manage their exhaustion meter, and in the hands of them sprint burst is very strong. It's absolutely not the worst of all exhaustion perks, not even close. You can say any perk in the game is bad when you're using it wrong.
---
I'm open to criticism, what i can't stand though is people going through new only to whine about noed.
---
No need to remove the stalking, just fix the revealing. Make it so that survivors can't reveal you 8,000 years after you crouch behind a wall in Montenegro and make it so that you can reveal him when he's standing in the middle of an open field with several thousand stage lights shining on him.
---
I’d be fine with paying for it If the skins in it werent recolored skins and we got something better than dumb little charms
---
No! bt is so unfair.. It is impossible to tunnel or camp.. my favourite 2 play styles.. Its so anti-fun what am i ment to do?!?!?!?!!
---
As a Quentin main, it's only happened once.
---
I didn't say THE weakest, but Wraith is no Spirit. In terms of viability I'd say Wraith is in low tier along with Clown, Legion and Leatherface.
---
It's funny because the only Halloween worthy game does not have a halloween event during halloween it seems :P
---
h-how is it fun, i tried it once and it was a boring 1k and everyone else got out
---
Okay its bait whatever glad you aren't that dumb
---
Im rank 1 on survivor and rank 7 on killer because killer is a lot harder to rank up because gen rushers and bt players
---
If a killer is bypassing hooks, they're looking for hatch. If they're swinging their weapon wildly or shaking their head, they're also looking for hatch.
---
claudette was actually crouching whole game and didn't save last guy
---
Your bitching abour hair??? What about the game breaking bugs and matchmaking bugs?? Fuck the hair I just dont like it when the game crashes mid match or the constant errors and disconnects frok matchmaking
---
Do you think it won't be bugged, there will always be quite a lot of bugs with every update they release no matter how long they take with this one, it will only not be game breaking.
---
DS = Mori ( Perks to add/remove chances)
---
Gen Rush = Tunneling (Focusing an objective till its completed)
---
Camping=Toxicity (camping is barely acceptable as a response to toxicity, and vice versa)
---
The only reason you have problem with borrowed time is if you're camping which will lose you emblem points anyway so idk why you're doing it. It surprises me that you have nothing to slow down the game or you're getting 'gen rushed' because you're camping, it takes two minutes for them to fully die.
---
wiggilng is rather useless unless the killer is miles away from the nearest hook
---
Ah, oke
---
Noob3 makes money off playing DBD at least.
---
My profile picture applies here
---
I've seen that there's more free content in this battle pass then in the other games. The free one skips a level every 3 or so I think, and even then cool cosmetics cost 10 dollars so I don't see whats wrong with it
---
This is a very serious matter.. Bt is so unfair.. How are you even ment to counter it? Like when people use ds you can just wait standing above them for a little while for it to run out.. but on bt they have a chance to run
---
I only do it if the killer has been an ass during the match.
---
Im a patient guy and now im a "supposedly no skill killer" main, this killer is the only reason i ever wanted to rank up, and im really good with her, but people always dc and say it takes essentially no skill to use but starting out as her was really hard
---
Ps talking about the glassy girl
---
XD lobbies already not working right
---
Usually only takes me 5-7 minutes
---
@haterankreset is my favorite streamer
---
Not Object of obsession, ghostface can see you once you reveal him, dumbass.
---
he says it's serious but I can't help but think that it's a bait
---
Ahah! you are obviously a survivor main.. sent by bhvr  to trick me into not playing like a smart killer! i am just a smart killer patrolling  by the hook with my chainsaw!
---
Of course ur not allowed to use it, because it no FUN for the SURVIVORS obviously. Insta-heals,Flashlights,Toolboxes pfffftt those are nothing compared to ur add-on that makes you slow as a dying old man that gives survivors plenty of time to gen rush for the prize of a de pip weather you win or lose
---
And the whole time you were, what? Acting like you were chasing them and trying to hook them?
---
What is with this influx of killers acting like they're nice guys who give hatch all day every day or something when I constantly see posts of killers "wrecking" survivors who don't leave right away or who stand in hatch or don't get hatch right away.
---
If in 99 percent of games the killer would close hatch, hook you regardless of how the game went, etc etc, what on Earth makes any of you think chasing them normally, to the point of being able to be pallet stunned, would give absolutely anyone the idea that you're going to give them hatch?
---
These posts are so stupid. If you're giving someone hatch, or farming, or being nice, try doing absolutely anything to act like that's the case instead if starting this idea that people shouldn't struggle when they night get out and be able to rush to hatch, which I've personally done more than once at end game.
---
Especially when were going to get points for struggling soon.
---
Lmao I've done this before, post-game chat was hell
---
My survivor rank is 18 and my killer rank 6 but yes I'm definitely a survivor main...
---
Wait, what's wrong with P3 Claudettes who don't wear bright clothes?
---
This game is so weird for social etiquette.
---
Do you wanna end up in the basement every time?
---
Yeah so right like I am a massive Tru3talent fan I learn from him because he is the best and he knows whats good and not he says that BT is too unfair because I cant face camp and tunnel the way i want to.
---
Bill’s worst nightmare
---
Why would it be a bait? Bt is so unfair.. I dont understand how anyone can complain about noed or insidious.. If they can use a perk which makes it almost impossible to win!
---
I give hatch to scoops ahoy steves and baby dwights
---
Alright so I have a Shaun perk:
---
Fix your life:
---
After being unhooked you gain a 6/8/10% boost in all actions 
---
It’s probably shit but I thought it would be an interesting idea
---
There was a chinese new year event as well and a 3 year anniversary when gf came out
---
He's the reason I got into playing Legion, I saw part of his stream and saw how decent it was
---
I play my ukulele and fiddle with cosmetics while waiting. Nothing gets me in the killing mood like playing relaxing Hawaiian music on a cute li’l guitar.
---
Yes, it's Xbox One
---
Is it only me or does his Adam's apple look like a ballsack
---
Thanks, skemooo! Very cool!
---
Survivor main here. Used to play on pc then switched to xbox so I could play with friends. We had learned about the "don't wiggle" rule early on. But I gotta say, after switching to xbox it's like the dont wiggle rule doesn't exist. Anytime I'm the last survivor and the killer finds me it's instant hook. Is this more of a thing for pc vs console players?
---
Yeah, it was added very recently, largely in response to virtually every game being players burning through their syringes. One too many games of that while Otz was being Otz and running off-meta
---
Things like syringes and intentional Haddonfield add a point to the Tilt-o-meter. When it reaches the first tier, 10 points, no more free hatch for last survivor. When it hits the second tier, 20 points, no items allowed. I might have missed a more recent stream, but while it *can* go higher we don't know what the consequences are at those levels.
---
"Meaner and sweatier".
---
I’m on ps4 and it takes me 1-5 minutes to find a game as a survivor
---
The problem with all perk concepts is that we will never make something that is situational or bad and will only ever make something that is good in most situations. If deliverance was suggested to be made, it would never have broken on it for instance, it would just be "If you have safe unhooked someone, you can unhook yourself 100% of the time" and the community would go 
---
&gt;"Wow very cool i can see myself running this"
---
- Survivor that runs adren/borrowed time/deadhard/self-care.
---
I wasn’t stunned. I was just standing there hitting air and nodding. I was meters away from the pallet.  I was power walking behind them and only downed to bring to the hatch. You are salty. Take a break and play Killer.
---
I never wiggle on my last hook, if the killer is good enough to hook me three times, or i'm just stupid enough to run into the killer multiple times, he/she earned the kill. And i'm not even mad about that, they get a gg wp after the match and that's it, no hard feelings for someone who's just doing their job :)
---
Also solo q doesn't make it easier to wiggle free even if i'm the first survivor to get hooked, in my experience no one even tries to bodyblock, i've played for a couple of hundred of hours as a survivor and yesterday was the first time someone palletsaved me 😅
---
If I spot a Blendette squad I just switch to doctor.
---
You wanna hide all game? *psychotic giggling*
---
Mixer has FTL protocol that you can enable, which is almost instant. So far every other platform has varying degrees of latency delay.
---
This happens when the killer has a lot of hex totems.
---
It is I, the Blev
---
Yeah both sides are toxic. But that’s what you get in a competitive game
---
Yeah, why should you hand victory to those who give up instead of fighting to the end?
---
Otzbarba good gib upvotes
---
Hopefully they do what fortnite does where they give away 200 of the currency, so after a certain amount of rifts we can finally unlock 1 after missing 5 of them.
---
I personally like the rift just cause we get plenty of content in terms of skins for just $10, at least I look at it like that cause I put in roughly 50 hours every week. I can understand how it's not worth for someone who has too much on their plate to play the game for a few hours everyday.
---
In terms of time you have to play, it's not worth to the people who are busy. But in terms of money relative to content received, its 100% worth compared to any other cosmetics you could purchase. This is because you could easily unlock it once and continue to buy it with the cells earned back.
---
Also if you dont have the time, you can always wait until the last few days of the rift to see how far you've gotten so you know if it's worth to buy. If you only got to tier 25, you'll probably not buy it for $10. But of you've been doing well at 57 tiers, it'll be more worth to buy for $10.
---
So basically it's both good and bad, just mostly bad for people who either have too much going on in their life or people that only enjoy playing 1 or 2 matches everyday before getting bored.
---
Bold of you to assume Adam hasn’t been hooked already
---
Eh. The original movie was better.
---
Are you kidding? I love fightin nurses, the Adrenalin of being chased and at any moment they hit you with that unexpectedly good blink gives the experience so much joy to me
---
What about bald Dwights who wear the red shirt and red jeans?
---
Yea it’s fine. If you can’t catch the survivors then don’t be killer. If you can’t survive then don’t be survivor. If you’re going to get butt hurt cus someone’s trolling you then don’t play the game.
---
Damn, this looks awesome! I can’t wait to see the final product.
---
Scenario 3. U had a hunch- yes.
---
As a killer main this is the code I abide by.
---
It makes turning toxic a little less likely. Toxic survivors and killers were made that way by other toxic players. You abuse me, I abuse everyone else after forever mentality. And the film reel spins on.
---
I might be biased here, but Ghostface might be one of the few killers who’s fun to play as and against.
---
Those are monster cards, not trap cards. But the idea is good.
---
you know, why not? we already get 1k points for dying as the obsession... like.. ok???? at least this would be fair treatment for not being hooked until you’re the last survivor.
---
I agree, but I do enjoy the similarities between kid Willy and the Doctor lol.
---
You forgot the Shitpost flair
---
Replace boring with annoying and it's spot on
---
Hag? The drums remind me of hag for some reason
---
Though I don't think shape-shifting necessarily needs to be The Things power (as in the movie it does that to survive the temperature and to get to the rest of the world without being caught so in dbd's realm it wouldn't have to depend on it or use it as it simply just needs to kill which it does best in its monstrous form) but if they did want to use shape-shifting as a power a way around SWF ruining it would be to have it automatically transform at a close proximity giving the victim not much time to ask all survivors if its them or The Thing as it is happening too fast giving the killer the advantage of getting a head start in chase and it would be extremely frightening to see a survivor walking to you in a distance only for it to burst into a creature when close and happen so rapidly.
---
Getting a rank progress
---
Bear grylls
---
bro
---
Borrowed time is not unfair. I’m a killer main and sometimes I can go up with bubba and instant down both of them. Their has to be some sort of counter to that. Plus it slows the game down because they have to mend.
---
 I think it really only applies when stalking doesn't work like right now. Stalking in theory is significantly more efficient but in practice it's  just too difficult to do and wastes your time. If it gets fixed though it'll be much more efficient than his build
---
Ah shit you got me lol.
---
Bold of you assume the dwight has borrowed time 
---
Truee adam is always the first one to get hooked xD
---
If you're willing to farm a few games just do it with survivors that will let you grab them and drop them to be healed up over and over
---
Way too true
---
I’ve won so many games because of NoED it’s op
---
Kinda hard to kill a perk that decreases game's grind by half indefinitely as long as you run it
---
Looking cool!

I don't play killer much but when I do I understand the frustration that can ensue while going up against a killer with a bad internet connection (most of the survivors I go up against have fluctuate between yellow and red) so I almost always try to give one person the hatch. However If you wiggle all that goes out the window and I just put the survivor on the hook. Also I do this because I have to repent from a sin I committed once as killer. (I pretended to give survivor the exit gate and then downed him before he could leave and then put him on a hook)
---
In my defence, I waited till the last endgame bong.
---
Thieu Macote would swallow his opponent whole.
---
More like two snaps without screams :(
---
I did mine with wraith with the silent bell and no terror radius/red stain for 6 sec after uncloak. Easiest on the game, just uncloak before you turn the corner. The speed boost will do all the work and the survivors will be scared shitless after seeing you so youll have a good window to do your thing
---
Ffffff
---
As if a nolife like me wouldnt notice.
---
If the last surv wiggles when I pick them up, then they get hooked unless it's endgame then I let them wiggle off and toy with them until the timer's done. Otherwise I let them live.
---
Just ignore this guy. He literally ruins the game by only tunneling and camping,
---
It sounds like they were purposely trying to depip themselves.
---
What did the girl from the first Halloween movie ever do? He was just stalking her and them tried to kill her (save the best for last, btw). Did I miss something in the movie?
---
That short paragraph is a lot of reading?
---
sadly, yes....
---
Choose one and live with the consequences
---
Ten gens for 4 survivors and "two killers" is way too high not to mention the two exit gates, the puppet could sandbag the first door while the killer guard the other results in a doomed ending for survivors.
---
I would envision it as all players are able to talk to each other when withing x-amount of meters from each other. Also, as mentioned, it would be its own game mode so people who prefer the less meme-y traditional play can still do so!
---
I don’t even do the swing.. I decide to kill them the moment they try beating me. HOWEVER, sometimes I take them not wiggling as “oh you’re not wiggling so you think I’m gonna give you hatch, bitch? Nah” then I kill them. It’s definitely in the air with me what I do with them and how I’m feeling haha
---
The problem here is that splitting the gamemodes with our level of population is not feasible. Either both modes double their queue time in the best case scenario or one mode is completely dead and a waste of future dedicated server space.
---
no this is 100% a bait and if it isn't you are the dumbest dude alive but if it is a bait you are the funniest man ever
---
again, delay is a setting on twitch. it also depends on connection. just because you’ve never seen a low delay stream doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist lol
---
Its all a nickname now. Saddly our beautiful dart didnt get to adulthood
---
I would actually enjoy skins for the killers that show them before the entity warped or just skins that show a normal face(cough Myers, freddy, leatherface, and ghostface)
---
Well for sure, I get this, and I would want there to be 2 separate queues. But in my humble opinion, when I would play killer (I queued as both back when I played) I would always run into discord SWF buddies and it was tilting. I would probably spam proxy chat lobbies as a killer for the memes, and at least it's fun while I'm winning/losing.
---
Just a thought
---
THIS. As a merciful killer it's so annoying when the survivor just won't take the hint. I wanna let you go, dude. Just let me find the hatch for you.
---
I was more so thinking just having 2 separate queues, one with it enabled, and another queue that runs the game as is. So people can go into their safe haven if they want to!
---
Why is it toxic to save your friends? It's their job as survivors to survive, it's in the game for a reason. It's like saying NOED or mori are toxic. Sure, not fun for a survivor but I wouldn't say it's toxic.
---
Not always. Some survivors are very dense and/or doubtful
---
I need metal music in the background.
---
How playing Billy be like
---
I’d imagine a lot of killer mains don’t want this and I can see why, but if proxy chat was added it would make balance a lot better in the game. Right now, any nerf to survivors is small to swf but often quite huge to solo survivors. Proxy chat between solos would lessen that slightly (still not equal but full balance will never be achieved between swf and solos) and because of that it would allow the devs to balance the game easier without so many differing integers. In my experience 4 solo survivors at red ranks is a more miserable experience than a killer at red ranks against a 4 man swf. 
---
Personally I’m not bothered if they do or don’t add proximity chat, I can see both sides of the argument for and against it.
---
No it's not, I main Claudette. Just stating what I've heard others say.
---
Her *mother* on the other hand..
---
If a gen is constantly being worked on the moment you kick it and leave, or if they fail a skillcheck or if the killer has Whispers or if there's scratchmarks leading no where
---
Just started playing ghostface, saw this and went 👁👁
---
it’s really good though! I love it
---
Problem is, when two killers are chasing one survivor, instead of two, the one survivor is down in literally seconds
---
Console player here! Queues aren't bad if you're playing killer with myself personally getting into a lobby in around two minutes time at most. Survivor I've noticed can take a decent amount of time if you're higher up in ranks or playing with friends but the most I've ever waited has been around nine minutes.
---
Ay more killer rules. Cheers.
---
literally the only thing determining if the survivor gets the hatch or not is if I hear it on my way to the hook.
---
I will only hook the guy if they were just a gen monkey/ didn't give me good chases or fucked their own team over.
---
I'll almost go out of my way to make sure the last survivor that gets hatch was one of the people who could run me. It's my way of correcting the pipping system.
---
He is being down voted because she is already balanced so why randomly nerf her
---
Only if Shaun actually looks like Shaun! I am not really interested in a second Laury/Quentin Fiasco...
---
Whispers, stridor, maybe they saw scratch marks, or maybe the survivor was taunting them with object of obsession.
---
This is the best argument against it. Not really worth the time or money for the payoff, imo. Just would be cool to experience the game with it. Too bad.
---
Laughs in “Breakdown”
---
Problem on the other side, imagine you tryna hook a survivor but 7 survivors are here to bodyblock
---
Solo que is miserable but still more interesting then a full swf sweat squad. I have a love hate relationship with it but I rarely ever will swf. Solo que makes you a better player period
---
&gt; This just feels like a power trip
---
It is. Just do whatever you want, they'll do whatever they want.
---
I have no idea what any of those things are lmao I'm so bad at this game.
---
Teabagging from the other side of a pallet is the universal request for please hook and camp me.
---
This is always 1000x better than smacking me on the hook ten times like you’re a god or something
---
I know this because they usually explain in excruciating  detail how they were gonna win but they lost because I apparently camped with NOED and Ruin active despite having only brutal strength, enduring, STBFL, and iron grasp on trappy boi.
---
True, True, If You Go LiMp I Will Personally Carry You To The Hatch. If You Wiggle
---
“YOU DiE”
---
I just get tired of the entitlement I  both sides. No one deserves to survive just as much as no killer deserves to kill everyone in the match. Fuck both sides of these arguments tbh.
---
Now learn how to float.
---
Ghostface and surveillance. I got at least 3 grabs last night in the handful of games I played.
---
The thing is that a lot of them are wannabe Noob3s so it can be assumed they're going to be toxic. I personally don't do anything out of the ordinary when I'm playing against them because it's completely possible that they're just normal players but I understand the fear
---
I litterally only gotten one for my main, trapper, who is p2
---
Leatherface would like to have a word
---
At first my thoughts were HELL NO I don't want to listen to all these random kids screaming. Just imagine all the sounds people make seconds before they dc... But considering how solo survivor is miserable you might as well make it an utter mess and joke lol.
---
It is a case of. "If you are a good little survivor then I will let you free but if you are not then I won't".
---
Sorry but it is a power based decision. Hence why you have loads of people commenting 'Na I aint no bitch'.
---
XD
---
No
---
If proximity chat existed it still wouldn't fix the problem with SWF with mics because those guys will continue to use discord so they can communicate with each other no matter the distance.
---
You made him uninstall lol
---
NOED on a Michael...what
---
tbh, I quite like this dbd battle pass, seems you'll have enough time and you get the currency back. Seeing as I still have enough cells lying around atm, I'll prob be instabuying it.
---
However, I am definitely a little concerned about where this whole thing could be leading in the future.
---
Some of it is a bit cheesey, but I like the camera concept a lot. Freezing a pallet, locker, gen or so on. Maybe the time is a little long. Endgame would be her specialty if she could freeze the exit gate for a few seconds to run and check the other
---
In before the down voting begins, their mentality seems to be that their not going to have fun so they want to move on to the next game. Note sure if that's true for all of them.
---
Scratched mirror Myers on Lery's
---
Pig with Whispers/M&amp;A
---
If They ever give us an unranked mode then yea i wouldnt mind it , as long if its only in the unranked mode
---
Doesn't also dance with me counter Freddy's pallets?
---
Pig with whispers and M&amp;A with combat strap add-ons. You can get one gen grab every match early game.
---
No, we don't like when people wiggle because if they escape that's more time we have to spend finding the hatch and it's really annoying how it fucks with your movement. It's not some power thing I just want to waste my fucking time
---
Wrong comma, meant to go "Depends. For me, yeah"
---
 Which although what's wrong with that in the first place. It's kinda the main time you have complete control of what happens in the game. I can't think of any other time besides a survivor willingly dying to the killer or EGC
---
No sys admin can help a software company that doesn’t have back up generators or use GIT. Lmao
---
If it were a time thing you would just hook them no? If you cared that much about a few extra minutes.
---
Or do you doubt your own abilities to catch them before they find the hatch? And don't want them to think that they won off their own accord?
---
I really didn't mean anything malicious here. But it is the truth. I play enough to know why killers are only happy "As long as they know that you *let* them survive".
---
These other reasons are just pathetic. There is nothing wrong with being happy that you have power in the game- especially when you are the power role...
---
But that isn't the point. You just need to break LoS before you do something. If he sees you, then make sure he doesn't  before acting so he can't stalk you more.   
---
Is it still buggy? Yeah. But at least he won't be getting you exposed as fast that way.
---
My technical writing professor would give that a gold star
---
For me 
---
Movement speed/power? 
---
There's no base movement speed but due to his power being to gain movement speed via hit he would have to be faster than the survivors base speed which would make for an awful experience of players literally being Legioned without the deep wound meaning frustrating. Additionally would eventually gain dashes which on paper sound like nurses blinking without the disadvantages of not being able to see and being slow. 
---
His powers range? In addition to the dash, You mention a power that curses players and slow gen progress with no max range, so would it just be overall? Would it be based on his Terror radius? This are important stats lol Are you taking terror radius extending perks in mind? Etc etc. 
---
Perks- My precious 
---
Survivors will be oblivious after what? Hitting an obsession causes your terror radius to expand across the map in addition to lighting all of the hexes which would make haunted grounds "Literally" fucking annoying since there's no give away for real hexes so we'd have to destroy them at random instead of breaking down active effects to deduce wether HG is active or if it's DH. It sounds painfully annoying tbh. I would rework it rather than improve upon it. 
---
Hindsight- Some killers do rely on scratch marks but I don't think it's strong enough to be a perk for itself as most players tend to walk around the map while the people like me would run gen to gen ti avoid wasting time, Because scratch marks are more LOS based than anything I would think of a better buff to this. 
---
Lastly the last perk is just a bad power creep tbh Plus the more speed buffs the killer has access to the less playable it will be for survivors. 
---
Summary- Tbh I feel like he's lacking interest, He doesn't seem interesting to me if I'm being honest and not even bluntly so. among that you need more stats ( not including the empty % labels showing that you haven't thought too far into it) But for movement speed, TR etc. A lot of his powers just grant him speed and hit recovery which is in bad design as he has to be faster than a player to even get his power to ramp up which means he'll go from faster to even faster. Ultimately it looks like you rushed it to Reddit without giving him too much thought, There's no shame in taking your time to think of interesting mechanics and ways to balance him out. I would say take a bit more time and don't ask for constructive criticism if most of your stats aren't even in mind xD it's rude.
---
It is weird. But after hundreds of hours you eventually switch from playing a party horror game to a game where you just observe player behaviour, poke and prod at it, react, surprise them. The game kind of becomes a formula, and after playing both sides you don't exactly have this roleplay mentality of a horror movie. It's like  "during the match, I liked what I saw" or "You're a piece of shit, you know that?"
---
"Whatever it takes to survive" is kind of weird concept to me now, because you could always bring stacked shit that is dramatic overkill (4 SWF all with balanced landing, someone with prove thyself, haddonfield offering + 3 hook offerings, insta-medis, humping infinites) and just guarantee an easy match. But you don't even have to do that, since most killers are just average and you can beat them with a semi coordinated team/ just by yourself if you have map knowledge and good habits along with decent enough teammates.
---
And same goes for killer; they can make the game RIDICULOUSLY easy for themselves. Master Nurse and you'll flat out get bored of killing, and look for more "fun" stuff to do while playing the role.
---
If you put your mind to it, doing something like surviving or killing is easy and boring. But the individual elements across all games consistently building into that result is way more fun by themselves. **Chases, map pressure, map knowledge, teamwork/ team plays, mindgames and decision making, risk**- shit is fun.
---
People generally hate the stuff that omits those fun elements. Killer makes chases one dimensional and boring? Killer camps someone in a deadzone, leaving no choice but to hookswap in order for that guy to even have a chance? Killer running boring builds that stalls the game out to ages of you just holding M1? Survivors humping infinites/ busted buildings that guarantee wasting 40+ seconds of your life just holding W while everyone else works on gens?
---
Yeah that true
---
What do you play on?
---
Rank 8 Nea here but ooookay. With 300 hrs as a Survivor main but OKAY. Survivors like you though kill any desire to go easy on other players.
---
There is nothing wrong with that. That is why it is so hilarious that these people are attacking me as if they have been insulted.
---
It is just fact. It doesn't make you a bad person.
---
People seem to think any use of the word power or ego is instantly an attack..
---
Ps4
---
Oo what an edgy post title. You reek of white, pathetic, uneducated trash. Nice attempt that pretend to be noble by giving a hatch when you probably are more likely to pretended to give hatch and hook them with your feeble attempts to reason why they died. Your comments on your post don’t paint you in the most flattering light. Keep trying, maybe one day you’ll amount to something, perhaps a fast food chain would hire you if you begged hard enough.
---
Do you mean windows of opportunity? Cause I see no reason dance with me would even affect his pallets
---
one time my adrenaline hit while I was in a bear trap..so that went as well as expected
---
Clown is not viable, he played well that match and got snowballed. He is right in saying that, when survivors are toxic and there are only a small amount of killers that are actually pretty good, it is expected to have the other side be toxic and only use those killers, unfortunately
---
I’m always sad when I miss my free 800 struggle points
---
He's trolling you, dummy.
---
Why did the put the hag’s face on the clown?
---
I mean, tbh while insults are just useless you did kinda sound aggressive there mate. I think it's just the implications that word has most of the time, and not as easy to tell the tone of a comment through text.
---
I’d say demigorgon or spirit but ghost face is really fun to play
---
That’s not hybridpanda
---
I don't watch his vids but I keep getting them recommended on YT. Does he really say that stuff?
---
Thank you😋
---
Also I have no clue why it rotated, before anyone asks!
---
thank you!
---
"we" - you are speaking to someone who plays killer as well by the way. Stop acting like everything is killer vs survivor.
---
If you cared about time you would just hook them - not spend ages carrying them round looking for the hatch.
---
Hey man - maybe you are different and that is all you care about on the basis that you *must* treat the final survivor nicely. I don't buy it. I have played this game enough on both sides to know the humourus power games a killer will play with the last survivor.
---
You act like claiming power as the power role is a bad thing...
---
I got a doctor hard tunneling me for no reason at 5 gens (i admit i teabagged him after he kept tunneling). A ghostface camping in stealth mode and tunneling and a hillbilly who was yes-nodding with his head everytime after i cleaensed ruin
---
I know dont not. Hard is english. /s
---
Yes I mean windows of opportunity fuck me lmao
---
And haunted ground. We can’t be letting them have too much fun, can we?
---
I delete this one. I rather get the Freddy one where the game has to exist for a minute lol.
---
~~entity dammit that was clever as hell~~
---
Well... you literally titled it "chase music" so-
---
As a huntress “”””””main”””””” after watching gods of some streamers I’ve faced, huntress hatchets are bs for both sidedly. Sometimes you are like that’s should have hit and the rest of the time it is that shouldn’t have hit. I thin’ it’s just dedicated servers being flawed right now.
---
No problem 😊
---
Bullshit, I’ve been given hatch as Claudette lol
---
It's almost as if there's some kind of connection between going into a thread full of something or someone's supporters, and getting masses of downvotes for announcing to them that you don't like what they like.
---
Camping tunneling etc
---
It happens to me too it’s not an accomplishment that happens to me (takes me less than a week for survivor)
---
Nah man, I’ve had too many killers burn me. If you don’t swipe the air or something I’m wiggling.
---
Well.. I viewed it as the kinds of killers who 'leave it up to the survivor as to whether they die or not". Lets not pretend that killers always either do it or don't. It depends on the way the game has gone too. I see how your point plays into it - but I stand by my first comment - which was not meant to be an attack, but to put straight some of the silly reasons people were giving.
---
.. I do realise that the killer isn't 'All powerful power role' (even though they are in early ranks). I meant in the general set up,  fiction and mechanics of the game - but obviously this is somewhat balanced (somewhat unbalanced sometimes with SWF players). That is what plays into the killer 'having fun' with last survivors.
---
Sometimes they will let them hatch, sometimes they will let them do gens. Sometimes they will let them get all the way to opening the door, then down them and kill them. Usually always involves some form of taunting or punishing or obedience play - which I find quite funny. The killer feels all powerful here and can relax. Similar to the way survivors can relax at the exit gates and can  start celebrating.
---
New person question. If I buy this perk is it rng when it will appear for my other killers? Or should you get it by  level “x”
---
I heard people say that you would have to play 7 games a day after completing all the quests before the delay.
---
Why does she look like, *that*
---
It doesn’t have to be over the top though. It’s not written anywhere that chase music needs to be bat shit insane.  Anyways I think it does a good job of keeping an up beat sound especially near the end while keeping suspense and ambience.
---
Poor little doggy...
---
Okay but as a survivor main who, just last night faced a killer that, after two DC's and my friend and I doing all the gens, failing to open the door and escape, did not take mercy on me. Most of the killers I face don't, I always get hooked. 
---
So I'm gonna wiggle cus I'd rather take my in-game chances than chance the killer being a bro for now on
---
Its a very interesting idea, I agree hindered might be better, she might be someone to utilize stealth against, maybe give her a way to regain pictures similar to hundreds, but at the cost having a big cool down timer might be best for her.
---
Yeah but they have to dc many times in a row
---
I said David watch out for the wraith! He didn’t hear him in the pouring rain...because I didn’t say anything I just thought “oh this is gonna be sweet”
---
Found Satan in the comments
---
Demogorgon I'd say is the most fun and therefore the "best" killer but I've never taken amount of kills or won games into consideration when deciding who I like the most
---
Ya but that was her mom, not her
---
Demo and Ghostface are all pretty fun aswell, you can buy spirit aswell if you want to annoy survivors, she can be really good with a bit of practice
---
I would absolutely play Shaun but Dwight stole his damn outfit. Damn you, Dwight!
---
So what? Instead of taking the win normally, people try to flex and tbag like they did something amazing, beating a mid-tier killer. But then they cry when that same person they tbagged switches to the best killer in the game and embarrasses them. Its true.
---
Wait so where you healed when you got free or did you go down instantly after the trapper hit you?
---
Except that no0b3 is actually good
---
You do know what chase music is right, how its supposed to make you feel n shit, because i was avoiding using blatant honesty but dude your theme is garbage my man, like I'm sorry but theres nothing going on and the sounds you used are boring as fuck, also no one set any rules on music, but just look at the reactions dude, its obviously just not good, you're not good
---
Camping and tunneling if they're an experienced killer.
---
What is a p3 Claudette? Prestige 3?
---
They're gonna run him into the ground if they don't chill with these.
---
I love the chalk pouch, best offering.
---
LOL cute. please tell me this was drawn by a girl
---
he hit me sorta at the exact same time so I went down and then adrenaline hit but since I was still in the “getting smacked while in a trap” animation I got zero speed boost and he just hit me right back down again...
---
Wasn't Freddy a pedo?
---
My Myers is at like 25 and I've got two of 'em, myself. Plus one or two tombstones. 
---
Saving those for a rainy day.
---
They get no points and get banned if they do it too much
---
"Try again sweetie"
---
Why didn’t you just scroll by instead of just sitting here and typing hate.  It takes less effort.
---
To be honest, if I was the last survivor alive and the killer picked me up and started swinging at the air for no reason, I would assume he was giving me the cue to wiggle free.
---
nurse nerf is fine luv
---
Other coworkers: This is kinky.  He must have paid extra.
---
I mean i tend to no life many things so...
---
why not both? ;)
---
Thanks :)
---
thank you &lt;3
---
Question, why does it annoy killers to wiggle as last man ? 
---
Killer/Survivor hybrid here
---
they get ignored in real life and in the game too and want some attention.
---
Not according to a lot of people it isn’t.
---
Why tf you upload this 4 times
---
Yea I’m more worried about the one person who probably doesn’t know anything about making music and producing to criticize me.  Just being honest I guess.  Also didn’t want to argue but whatever ✌️.
---
This is what I like about playing killer. You make the rules. Survivors have to play your game. Don't like how they're playing? Change the rules &gt;:)
---
i mean, every good nurse streamer was making fun of the people who acted like they killed her. oh no, it takes her 1.5 seconds more to catch people now...shes still good
---
I watch his YouTube every morning while I'm getting ready for lunch. He's the best! Keep it up, u/Otzdarva!
---
Multiplayer. On a female chracter
---
But what if the survivor is in panic, or just dumb and doesn’t realize you want to give him the hatch ? 
---
Happened to me as survivor and as killer
---
My bad
---
Farming with the baby killer be like
---
Clown is simple and fun I think he’s best killer in game in my personal opinion
---
Thanks! I'm wondering though, does it matter I'm a boy or a girl? just curious
---
Lol, true.
---
For me: if a killer let me farm the whole game and is super friendly, if I'm the last survivor they get to kill me. Mori. Final hook. I don't care, just kill me. You deserve bloodpoints too, killer mains
---
This is me. I've had so many 4ks as adept plague  and still haven't gotten that damned achievement.
---
I would recommend replacing ruin with corrupt intervention.
---
That's... so... cute
---
yeah ruin devours my hope
---
What he said is still true. Nobody just wants to let survivors escape. They take the power and give it to them. 
---
I play both.
---
You act like what he said is an attack on all killers?
---
Maybe it takes someone who plays survivors to know what the majority of killers do in this situation..
---
What about when the survivors are all nearby hiding behind a rock waiting for the killer to leave right after he hooked a survivor? The killer would disadvantage themself by leaving in that scenario. And yes the killer knows they are there for obvious reasons (wounded and healing eachother, parts of their body peeking out, etc.)
---
Inb4 the Nancy spawns on ruin
---
He only has good stealth and people at lower ranks are just hiding more so he gets easy hits. People at higher ranks play more aggressive and he can get looped pretty hard
---
Do a Claudette cosplay
---
I was playing against swf and there was a Claudette, which was the low rank one. who kept running in a straight line and didn’t even bother going to pallets or anything. she had seen the hatch before too but she never went to it she just kept running for her life. She wiggled out like 10 times before I finally got around to the side of the map where the hatch was and I could drop her there 😂
---
On guy tried to hid in a locker after one hit right in front of me. I baited a head on but he didnt fall for it so I assumed he indeed didnt have that perk. I put a trap on the exit of the locker and left lmao
---
Actually that’s not at all true. Tru3 has been saying base Nurse is balanced since before the addon rework was even confirmed.
---
And Otz isn’t a good Nurse, there’s no MMR on the PTB and he’s a top level player. He’s playing against potatos. And if “well X tested the nerf and it was fine” is sound logic, then what the hell did they think they were doing reworking Freddy. People can get 4ks with him all the time his power was fine lmao.
---
Yeah it’s pretty evident you don’t play Nurse. What you are saying is flat out wrong and taking shit out of context
---
I don't mind Ruin getting destroyed, after all that's why it is a hex perk in the first place. What I DO mind is when it lasts shorter that me on sex.
---
Like, sometimes I don't even find a survivor before ruin just explodes.
---
That just feels bad man.
---
right try comparing it with warframe's battle pass. not only is the game free but the battle pass is completely free
---
Rough day, wish you a better luck next time
---
What about when all other survivors are hiding nearby waiting for killer to hide so they can rescue instead of doing gens and totems, and the killer knows they are there and they will get away and hook rescue if he leaves the hook to attack their hiding spot?
---
I get twice but 4 times?
---
Nancy and ruin is a valentines love story
---
That’s why I main killer :,(
---
Stuff like battle passes are carefully designed by psychologists to keep people playing. Not by BHVR's, obviously. They don't have any. They just do what other games do.
---
Thank you! My own experiences are the best inspiration I have :')
---
I'm very proud of you. My boi is being well represented
---
Felt really bad for that nurse but nice vid actually
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dmhj5m/bug_on_new_map/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
It seems a bit OP. Only in the sense that she has a lot of opportunities to expose a survivor. I agree that hindrance might be a bit better option.
---
Her backstory is good, but doesn’t seem as bloodthirsty as others. I’d maybe add in something along the lines of her heading out to murder others just to get her photos, instead of just insinuating it. Maybe have her being a serial killer before the entity scooped her up.
---
Also 60 seconds is along time. I’d maybe do 10-30, maybe making it 10, and having add ons that would make the effect longer.
---
"I'm gunna give this guy the hatch" *survivor wiggles* "cowabunga it is"
---
Sweating starts when you lose 2 gens before first surv is downed. But by this moment you're already defaulted to "brutal" killer. For ruthless or merciless you should get 2-3 hooks with only one gen done, i.e. most rewarding games are the easiest. Emblem system.
---
Alright, if you thought original Freddy was fine (and I used to main Freddy) I am done arguing with you about nurse—your mind can’t be changed lmao
---
Weren't we spelling Cuniculus?
---
Me me big poor
---
Who is this dude?
---
Use it pretty sure if u go to another killer u can’t use her anymore so click off her when your done her
---
I thought the same thing, but I've been rewatching the originals with my kids and he was. It certainly downplays that aspect of it, but when he was alive, he targeted young children and wound up killing 20 of them before he was caught. I do not recall if the word "pedophile" is ever uttered by any of the characters, but it is certainly heavily implied.
---
I've had this happen to me several times these past days! I always get disconnected in the middle of chases too... Losing all my points and depipping. Fun.
---
Agent orange throwing Bill/Clown will haunt me.
---
❤️
---
SD card
---
This is what I mean. You are just taking shit out of context. I’m using your own logic to prove why your argument is shit and ur just straw manning. 
---
Thanks for proving people who like this Nurse change know pretty much nothing
---
Cool, thx!
---
if someone dcs during loading, you don’t depip. literally nothing happens.
---
thanks! \^\^
---
Camping doesn’t make you good btw
---
Yeah, just figured it out.
---
Sometimes I’ve had killers haul me around the map in search of the hatch while I am not wiggling and then proceed to hook me right in front of the hatch. Then they close the hatch on front of me. I guess it’s because they want the “late sacrifice” points.
---
Awe Ms Young is so sweet ❤️
---
Good art btw
---
noob3 was my intro to dbd 😎
---
this is bait. probs best to ignore it.
---
I feel like face camping is super scummy, but proxy camping isn't anywhere near as bad as it gives a window for an unhook. But my God if you don't hook someone and teleport 3000 miles away you're ToXiC
---
I'm the bestie 😄
---
Go ahead, break it. You can break my totems, but you will never break my will.
---
iron will i assume
---
Insidious bubba it is
---
If the numbers say that it makes gen repair take significantly more time and you say it doesn't based on your own personal experience, then that means either the numbers are wrong or your subjective experience has you underestimating the impact of Ruin on gen repair time. We're trying to figure out which it is.
---
As an aside though, I would like to know what it would take to make Ruin not worthless to you. Does it need a buff? How much longer should it make generator repair?
---
I think the wholesomeness comes from he’s very friendly with people in his chat and as long as I’ve been watching isn’t a dick to them. I have 0 proof but I saw in another thread that someone suggested Tru3Talent try a build and got wrecked and he proceeded to curse at the guy and berate him. I have no clue if that’s true but if so that could be where people say he’s wholesome.
---
I am rank 1 on PC and tbh, ever since the nerf got announced I have been seeing less nurses at red ranks and more spirits,huntresses,plagues and hell even Freddy is making a comeback.
---
Oversaturated meme.
---
Yeah, but I feel bad for the rest of the team:(
---
On that note, dont take it personal if I go around with you on my back (no wiggle) find the hatch and then close it, I will give you the gate its just that I am collecting hatches for the "Denied!" achievement.
---
The game was fine in 2016
---
I think battle passes is fine in any game as long as it's only cosmetic, cuz you always get all the money you invested in it back + more cosmetics on the side, and all you have to do is play the game.
---
So by paying a small amount of currency (which you'll get back) it encourages you to play the game more through the month(s) the battlepass is active
---
Normalement sandbagging veut dire un joueur qui joue mal exprès pour saboter le jeu ou par fainéantise. Mais dans le cas de DbD, c'est souvent utilisé pour parler des joueurs qui sabotent les autres survivants, en les bloquant par exemple ou en le ramenant le tueur pour qu'ils se fassent attaquer a sa place.
---
mine does, every single time
---
Fuck g hate this meme
---
No. Not Star Wars. The biggest challenge would be fitting a children’s show into the game. They boutta drop some Fairy Odd Parents on us.
---
I’m just confused on if a killer is already planning on giving you hatch why you wiggling for extra blood points would be the last straw or something. You want to carry me to the hatch that bad? We can’t walk there together like homies?
---
nurse got nerfed?  oh you mean the slight cool down and actually healthy changes to her op as fuck add ons....
---
I've been re-reading the description on the styptic agent and syringe add-ons, and I'm a bit confused about the syringe :   
---
  
---
''Instantly and completely heal on secondary action.''   
---
This means you can't use it on yourself to heal completely, right?
---
It also gives survivors another week to waist there 500 red insta heals
---
5. Ace ?
---
Sorry for non-english "commentary", but it's just my confusion. Did it happen to any of you?
---
no, it doesn’t. unless ur the one dcing you won’t lose a rank pip.
---
Camping and tunnelling are not advantages, at least they wouldn’t be against the Survivors I have in my games. If you can’t do well using the Killers add-ons or the perks you choose maybe improve your playstyle.
---
yeah that’s basically the definition of me
---
OMFG I FORGOT ABOUT ADDONS ily😅😅😅
---
I'm curious if I can get her teachables that way
---
But that thing... M A D E W I T H M E M A T I C
---
Not sure if this meme sucked more the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th time I read it.
---
Exactly people always make assumptions bet you never ever played the other side when I’m pretty sure most people do
---
Exactly what I do.
---
i was a rank 15, pip 2 someone dced loading in and i went down to 1 pip, it’s happened multiple times before too
---
IT SCARES ME how poor I am
---
If you were playing on ps4 a bit before last rank reset, I'm sorry I did this to you
---
Yup, sometimes if I've not gone into the game with the want of a 4K and you don't wiggle you might get the hatch. However when you start wiggling you're going on a hook 100% of the time.
---
It's not worth the risk, don't wiggle.
---
it’s a visual glitch. If you paid attention, as soon as you leave the lobby you get that pip back.
---
Killer mains are fucking weird I’m convinced after reading this thread.
---
Because... playing the game is the fun part for me..... I enjoy chasing survivors / downing them / hunting.... etc.
---
DCing punishes Bloodpoints / Gameplay / and rank....
---
(That match, only received 14K blood points).
---
Over the past few months of me playing this game, I have gotten very good at finding dull totems.  Hex totems, not so much.
---
Yeah, when i posted this meme i got a lag. Not thinking what will happen i pressed again and again and again and boom, you have got 4 same not funny memes.
---
where’s my pip at then lol
---
Yes you can. But don’t tell people I told you
---
Maybe it's not the killers that changed but you. Maybe your playstyle includes stuff that killers might consider toxic.
---
If you teabag even once I won't give you hatch. If you were a nice survivor then you'll get hatch.
---
Unless there was...
---
lol get fucked dickhead
---
Also object hit boxes cam really vary if the hatchet will clip the invisible wall or if it will go practically through the box/crate/etc.
---
You have never told me anything
---
Omg delete all the other posts
---
Lmao, what’s your gamer tag?
---
bitch idk but you don’t depip from someone else dcing
---
I was literally not 5 feet away from him one time trying to unstealth him and it didn't do anything
---
Omg I love that perk, I always take it. It is very effective against fucking altruistic SWFs. I just love the feeling of chainsawing someone who tried to blind me while i break pallets
---
See the thing is: there are both shitty survivors AND shitty killers. If you choose to forget about it and hopefully don’t bump into them in game or online, it’s easy to not be a shitty survivor/killer. But then you see someone being mean, saying stuff that honestly makes no sense and it offends your playstyle, you start feeling salty and take it out on the next opponent. Which in turn continues the toxicity cycle. 
---
In this case, I tried to make a funny, not trying to offend anyone or be toxic. This is genuinely what happened to me. Yesterday. I started playing Killer this Monday. I thought it would make for a funny meme. People got offended by my wording? By the fact that they felt “called out”? I seriously don’t see how this picture could be offensive to anyone who played DbD a great deal and has seen and done many things. I also don’t see how this is controversial and/or could spark a debate and bullying in my direction. 
---
Does this clear things up?
---
You’re welcome.
---
In my lore, the dog isn't wearing a mask, it is possessed and the photo captured it.

---
You made me run into a wall, that’s the last straw mortal!! my mercy has run out.
---
not really. i saw a video on youtube of toxic guy running object of obsession, and he kept saying omg, killers always afraid of me, they never wanna chase me, and 90% of the match he was sitting in the middle circling around himself and crying for his teammates to do gens.
---
Quite a few times I’ve got out of it with the Ashley Williams recovery into wiggle perk
---
It is super underrated for the things it can do ok never see it remotely near the good perk tier list
---
Go watch the video. "Freddy vs ACTUAL Optimal SWF Group..." is the title.
---
Otz decides to treat a very skillful SWF he keeps running into as if they're his opponent in a Dbd tournament, and proceeds to create a build that uses no offerings or rare addons specifically designed to deal with this SWF and it's perks.
---
That’s just bad luck homie, honestly I barely use offerings cause I can have just as much fun even more by just fucking around with my friends and doing gens
---
You're missing out on some really wholesome moments imo! Some will be a killer but others just want to mess around and have a laugh
---
check please
---
Anyone who walks up to that table is getting stabbed
---
I knowwwww
---
Yeah that's why I'll usually give hatch if they don't struggle, if they can't take the hint of me swinging and shaking my head then I'll just hook them because its not worth the time because it will just turn into a ["why are you running"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6oQUDFV2C0) moment.
---
It was deleted lol
---
Despite it being Noob3, dude didn't really get a chance to be toxic the three games he played as Tapp
---
Aw such an adorable thing
---
It took me way too long when I started playing this game to realize I had to hold the button for the full progress bar and not only till the end of the animation. I'm not sure why the two don't match up.
---
I find that the best way to be polite and a sportmanslike player is to play both survivor and killer. Killers will always complain about toxic SWF, and survivors about camping / tunneling.
---
 I always try to put myself in other people's shoes. This is easier to do when you have matured a bit, due to age. You can't ask teenagers not to behave like idiots, because we all were kind of idiots at that time.
---
All that is legal in this game is doable, period. As survivor you have to understand that if the gates are powered and the killer downs you, you can very much get camped, as it is normal for the killer to try and secure at least a kill. Tunneling someone to get him out of the game if gens are being done fast is also understandable.
---
There are also killers who are well suited to defend hooks, specifically basement hooks. Just locate the basement and don't try to loop near it.
---
Survivors also need to understand that this is a 4vs1,and a killer must apply pressure by any means possible. 
---
The devs by the way are slowly and steadily trying to remove some toxic stuff from the game, like instaheals. I also think the ebony mori will be nerfed in time. There are perks that discourage camping and tunneling, such as make your choice, devour hope, decisive strike, borrowed time...
---
Then again, it all comes to what you say: toxic ppl are toxic so sometimes you just have to ignore it, or just laugh at them when they rage.
---
go get a drink instead, they want to see someone DC since its one of the few 'communication' methods to show that someone was affected by what they did.
---
Well yes, but actually no. Those fuckers can finish gens even with Tier 3 Ruin in like 1/2 Minutes.
---
This is why I screenshot a template in my photos, crop it to leave a small black bar on the bottom, then use mematic, then I crop out the black bar because the watermark is on the black bar
---
My guy I understand what you say but there is no way this many people with photosensitivity are the ones I go up against.  I played doctor all day for an experiment and I got 22 dcs within the first minute of all the matches I played....if they are all photosensitive then so be it but I doubt it.
---
Huh I’ll need to re-watch them. Watched the original not too long ago and didn’t get that idea, but I haven’t see any of the sequels in years
---
There's no guarantee that the survivor will just calmly walk with you to the hatch. Most likely, they'll assume it was unintentional, make a mad dash for the hatch, and then message you afterwards saying 'EZ BABY KILLER'.
---
Also, as petty as it sounds, the killer wants you to 'admit defeat' graciously, and if you do that, then you get the reward of the hatch - but it's painfully clear that it is at the mercy of the killer. Think about it - if you're playing a game with someone and you let them win, you want that to be acknowledged. Especially if it's a stranger who you don't really care about.
---
Doesn’t look familiar lol, this isn’t based off of a specific event, just something that seems to happen when killers run NOED
---
Kate with the biker skin = toxic. Kate with any other skin = not new but probably not old player either
---
I play both roles frequently but it pains me when a Kate joins my lobbies as a killer. Not because they're toxic but because I main Kate myself and I don't want to hurt my girl
---
ALLL PRAISE LORD OTZ!!!
---
NEW KING OF r/deadbydaylight !
---
son of Monto
---
son of Tru3Talent
---
I don't take them chances anymore I'm tired of de pipping
---
Sometimes that's works. One match I was in, the killer made the mistake of sacrificing everyone close together and he was determined to sacrifice me. Yet I kept  wiggling out. On his final attempt to hook me I decided to wiggle out and rush to find the hatch, he was chasing me trying to hit me but i should mention we were in the cornfield, I ran by the "meat tree" and boom, there was the hatch. I escaped.
---
No worries. I’d probably do the add-ons to extend the times rather than having it as part of her ability with the stack. 
---
Now does she only get three per round, or does it regenerate? I’m assuming there would be add-ons that would give her extra photos as well.
---
Those damn pests finishing those dam gens except all the ones I'm agianst can't hit skill checks
---
Congrats, you wasted like 5 dollars I think on a post I literally forgot about, well done!
---
*if it was ruin*
---
Insta-dc.
---
*happy spirit noises*
---
So your victimizing yourself...
---
t3 Myers lunge is long as fuck and a laggy lunge in t2 will appear to hit from very far away I wouldnt sweat it people have done worse faster without cheating
---
No shit there are toxic players but if you feed into the cycle it's your fault now cause you got mad enough at a damn game to be a prick elsewhere. If you contribute any way to a problem you are now the problem and by the way you two are arguing back and forth about the sides makes you both look toxic.
---
See it may be burnout but that’s no excuse for how he treats his chat when it comes to donations. Like I said above I’ve litterally seen someone type something along the lines of “I really want to see if my current build is viable at high ranks your stream has helped me so much” and they donated the correct amount and Tru3 used it lost and proceeded to call this build absolute shit and said the person who gave it to him is a green rank player (like it’s an insult) and bitched for about 30 minutes about it. He gets paid to play video games he can be alittle grateful when someone gives him fuckin money.
---
If you stream then you run this risk. It's like saying the SWAT is cheating because you are streaming your bank robbery.
---
If it glows 
---
it goes
---
You're fine. They were probably lagging and were surprised by a evil within 3 lunge probably. Even if they recorded it will mean nothing because you weren't even cheating and you're on ps4.
---
Yea whenever a survivor brings a secret offering in (there r only 2) I assume it’s that and go directly diagonal across the map haha

This is why pop is extremely good on Freddy.
---
Those are usually pretty decent
---
Kate mains are pretty cool. They’re usually very altruistic which tends to be their downfall as I’m able to snowball pretty hard when they’re not focused on generators.
---
Yare Yare, of course it isn’t.
---
I support this format
---
Yeah, and in one of the later movies, it's mentioned that he liked children, "especially little girls."
---
500 points as last to die, extra 9,000 if you message the killer and call them garbage.
---
He is pretty wholesome and nice and it usually comes from how be interacts with his viewers.  And usually he tries to be a good sport about things.   
---
Just because from time to time he can curse out survivors even if its uncalled for.  That doesnt make him not Nice. I'm sure the times he's done it he could reflect later and think it was an overreaction.  
---
Dbd is compeitive and it definitely isn't the most balanced game.  So yes. You're gonna get extremely frustrated sometimes and you'll say or act a way whether its called for or not.  Thats just being human. A lot of people can talk shit she frustrated. Doesnt mean they particularly me a what they say. But in saying that. That doesnt mean he isn't wholesome boy. He tends to just be easy going and fun to watch and informational.  I don't play him for sometimes slippin up about cursing out someone unneedingly it is a spare of the moment thing
---
“It’s paid. But you get that money back to use on other in game cosmetics and possibly more battlepasses. But it’s not free.” I suppose, “one time payment that you don’t even end up losing on the thing you are paying for” would be a better description. Or free.
---
So well said! Also Devour Hope would be amazing perk! Problem is its almost never up until the end-game. The thing is, even Ruin is useless because its get destroyed so fast. 
---
Early ranks, its nightmare for them, anything above rank 5 its just a minor setback. 
---
And i understand them, i see from their points, thats why i report and move on, its just that, people should stop complain about stuff which they dislike if they do them on their own.
---
Sounds like they want a taste of no heal ebony Mori Legion. I hate I get a ton of those Neas with names like "Wolfyloopedyou" or some other cocky bullshit. They put you in Haddonfield and bring BL and all their other meta shit. Then a bunch of toxic abuse whether you win or lose post game.

Enjoy camping
---
A surprising amount has to do with simple knowledge/ taught understanding. You can get fucked on Shack, let alone those T+L walls if you run them incorrectly.
---
Chases are 100% what makes playing killer interesting for me. In my games I'm basically downing people enough so that gens are stalled while they're busy saving downed/ hooked survivors. I could sweat kills and make sure people burn through hook states by proxi-camping them, but I'd rather give everyone a fair shot to "show me what they got" with chases, and actually lean forward + up my strategy when there are busted setups on the map.
---
Playing killer and feeling powerless is a common thing. It's INCREDIBLY difficult to understand what you could have done better outside of whiffing some shots. Understanding how to run certain tiles/ buildings, knowing when to commit to chases or bail, knowing where survivors are without seeing them- there's just a LOT that goes into it.
---

---
You won't get banned for this at all don't worry
---
He’s one of my favorite killers to play when I’m more so looking to have a fairly low stress game and not really care about getting everyone sacrificed. His power is very simple and easy to master so I don’t have to be as laser focused on the game as I can be whenever I’m playing someone like Spirit or Huntress.
---
Lullaby is kinda meh and thrill isn't needed imo. I wouldn't always use mirror add ons since they're very rare and it means you can't get tier 3 but thye can be fun to use sometimes, I'd say use memorial or jewelry add ons over it, dead rabbit is pretty good but I don't use it very often. Apart from that yeah it's great
---
stonks
---
It’s random, yeah. The by level “x” thing is when, if leveling that killer, THEIR teachable will be purchasable. :-)

---
First of all, I wasn't referring to the meme I was talking about you and that other user bickering back and forth like children claiming the other doesn't play the other side and is toxic yada yada but if you wanna bring up your meme the whole point of it is to call the person who tried to blind you a clown because they didn't get the hint that you were letting them go. Last time I checked calling someone a clown is taken as an insult by most people rn
---
Delete the Archives and leave the Nurse’s base kit alone.
---
Well tbh I got most characters and all the characters I want so 🤷‍♂️
---
I rather proxy camp, but if i see someone close, and i see they are in numbers, i cant leave a hood radius, or it will end in me losing the one survivor. 
---
And yes i agree, i had many games in which i tried not to tunnel, not to camp, still been called names because they lost. I gave up trying to play with some "Killer code" they play dirty, why should i play with some made up rules?
---
Honestly, I never see the Killers who say they let Dwight escape when I have one on my team. Maybe I just always get paired with the unlucky Dwights lol
---
I'm not planning to do so
---
Everything is toxic to someone.  The real question you've got to ask yourself is "Does Bruno Mars is gay?"
---
skemooo i understand you have the power of god at your fingertips but sometimes i wonder if you should
---
Its because most killers run to the opposite side of the map as soon as the game starts
---
Then my existence is bad luck
---
I hate that offering, I had better chances without it
---
You better or else my dad gonna ban your Minecraft account
---
It’s a Winter event boys
---
If you go diagonal, then you would have faced me. But the pig hit me from behind, there a WALL behind me.
---
Plague is pretty good against worse survivors because when they cleanse the corrupt purge you get from doin the shlurp is very effective. She becomes weak when survivors just decide not to cleanse and deprive you of your kill power and you essentially become an m1 killer. I personally really like playing as her. If you are struggling with survivors cleansing her apple addons give her 1 pool already ready for shlurping to use in a pinch. And her ultra rares make survivors more incentivized to cleanse, as one just give you your power anyway and one makes it super easy to track them if infected
---
That's just a bad person using OoO. I love using OoO just for the information. Where are the killers traps? Is he a stealth killer and nearby? Sometimes you can even juke them my looking at the killer while running one way, then look away and turn around.
---
Freddy quite literally can't mind game you if you are asleep because you have permanent wallhacks.
---
Coolio
---
oh, blow off it already.
---
It’s not your fault for playing the character you want to. That being said, killers like legion/doctor are just generally unfun to play against because of the the way they were designed. These killers are meant to be used to stall out games having survivors in a constant state of chase, heal/snap out of it, be bullied off gen, repeat, as opposed to the more interactive and engaging playstyles of billy/nurse/huntress where it feels rewarding for both killer and survivor.
---
Agreed, especially because I'm between three games right now and dropping from rank 6 to 13 or whatever and having to trudge back up to decent player pools makes me not want to play as much dbd
---
Thank you man! Yes, i knew i knew i will get downvoted and hated by survivors here. 
---
Because lets face it, camping and tunneling, are really strong tools in this game, which killers shy from doing because they are considered toxic, and when i seen some rank 1-2 killers, they dont shy from camping and tunneling, thats probably why are they so successful ... 
---
Its tactics like Hemorage Syringe or New Part ... Nobody forbids those items.
---
Eww the clown has the nurses head
---
Ay no argue ✌️
---
Pfft you can me both
---
not my Minecraft account please
---
Eh, but you're one of very few merciful killers, honestly.  If I had to tally up how many times wiggling vs not wiggling worked out in a killed vs not-killed outcome, the killed outcome is waaaaaaaay ahead and it isn't even close.  Seriously.  I'd say 9% of the time I don't wiggle, I am allowed to live and escape.  85% of the time I don't wiggle I still get hooked, and 6% of the time I wiggle I escape.
---
I'll be honest and say that I only really watch Tru3's YouTube clips where he doesn't post stuff like that (for obvious reasons.)
---
With that in mind the guy no doubt gets a bunch of trolls who give him garbage builds and try to make him throw rank constantly. After the 10th person asks you to survive with "funny ha ha No Mither + All Healing perks" or "funny ha ha Insidious in a Terror Radius build" when you lose with a not *completely* terrible build it can be really hard to keep a level head. Yes people pay him money to play with those builds but I can understand why he feels an obligation to use them because of the cash he's paid. People pay a lot of people to do things they don't want and there are plenty of people who are willing to throw $10 at the screen to watch the funny Scottish man get mad when he runs 4 Hex Leatherface.
---
Going back on my original point I think Tru3 really needs to limit his donation builds to once a week, or perhaps even biweekly. A lot of his salt does seem to originate from people giving him meme builds and it's not healthy for him to keep dealing with that.
---
It's easy enough to see him get mad when he loses with a "genuine" build but you have to realize that after losing with a hundred other "genuine" builds it really starts to get on your nerves. Yes he might be living the "dream job" but while I'd love a job where I get paid $500 to bash my head against a brick wall I'd start hating it after an hour or so too.
---
Because playing violent video games automatically makes you a killer irl. I could get behind asshole though. But only because too many people were an asshole to me trying to just have fun so now it's fun for me to be the asshole.
---
If we want to break the 4th wall we can add an worlds end or an Paul outfit.
---
EXACTLY (Steelers fan here) the nurse dident deserve to be represented by that clown
---
Plague is not considered a weak killer, but an average killer. She is better than any other M1 killers like Clown, legion, maybe ghostface. Being able to oneshot all game or to have a machine gun-like range attack is a big deal. She can be the most devastating killer and lower ranks because survivors tend to cleanse a lot. 
---
Why people consider her a weak killer is because experienced survivors learned that Plague is easier to handle without Corrupt Purge and refuse to cleanse, making her an M1 killer the whole game that can one shot instead. Being able to one shot is cool, but good survivors will just pallet chain you. She is not weak but is considered weaker than Spirit, Nurse or Huntress because you can't loop them several minutes because they have a power that can shut down loops.
---
Plague has many advantages, tho. Medkits or healing perks are useless, you can defend exit gates by vomiting on them (if survivors cleansed) and survivors are way more noisy and infect everything they touch. 
---
To counter Plague's weakness which is hard looping, you should take Enduring+Spirit fury which helps a lot in chases and Ruin to prevent gen rush. For the forth perk, you can take BBQ if you want points or Thanatophobia, a good perk for her.
---
In lower ranks, survivors will cleanse a lot, so the best add-ons would be Vile Emetic that makes survivors sick really fast and devotee's amulet, that makes corrupt purge last longer. 
---
At higher ranks when survivors refuse to cleanse, Black Incense and Ashen Apple are the best add-ons.
---
"If you get to the end" wanna know how many players actually get there?
---
She's fun! Good at chases but not impervious. Usually fairly immersed so they're a lot of fun to play with because you can tell they're enjoying the action
---
The words flash behind your closed eyelids at night right behind your grey rank
---
I love the concept of 'chilling on the hook'.
---
I'd prefer it if you'd hide and try to escape. Play the game, please. Running up to me in hopes of a mercy escape isn't going to help you, and makes the game less fun for me.
---
Looks like it's the basic frame work but not the textures on it
---
still paid. normally a very good deal compared to whats currently available in a game that uses the system, but still paid.
---
Wait a minute...
---
STATUS UPDATE ON OUR PROGRESS??
---
WE MIGHT GET AN ETA LADS, WE MIGHT GET IT TOMORROW LADS.
---
(disclaimer : everything here is 99% theorised.
---
... probably because the entire thread your responding to is about Tru3?
---
Or possibly because you responded to a post comparing Tru3s salt to Otz using a similar scenario?
---
And as a Kate main, I love you for that lol
---
Essentially how her power works is normally it is normal puke (caller vile purge). You can puke on both objects and survivors to infect them. Objects stay infected for a limited amount of time. Survivor infection is sort of like a progressive thing. When the survivor is first infected the only way to become uninfected is to cleanse. Well get to what that does in a bit. The more you puke on a survivor the faster they become broken. When a survivor is not yet broken and fully infected, they will slowly gain infection overtime. 
---
Now for what happens when they cleanse:
---
What happens is the survivor starts to see the auras of things called pools of devotion, and can go to interact with them to remove their infection progress, and turn the pool into a corrupt pool. When it becomes a corrupt pool, it’s aura is highlighted to you, and you can go slurp it up, which upgrades you power for a limited time to corrupt purge. This is essentially normal purge, but instead of applying infection, it damages survivors. This is incredibly powerful because you can charge it and spread the shots out to make it nearly impossible for survivors to dodge in a chase.
---
For a more comprehensive run down of the plague, check out a YouTuber called interact (I think some of those letters are number so something like “1nter4ct” or something, he does a series called “entity education” where he goes and spotlights killers, their powers, their addons, and good builds for them
---
Playing against a full group with comms that knows how to loop is one of the most stressful moments in gaming for me.
---
Lovely, so we legitimately aren't getting a halloween event until November
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far.
---
Get you a survivor that does both.
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure it doesn't show you fake pallets
---
I don't know when this was posted so i cant "timezones LUL" you yet but it did say hope to have, not will have.
---
I watch Puppers all the time. And I used to watch True, too, when I first got the game. He did help me a lot, with a lot of tactics and ideas. But once I got good at the game he wasnt helpful anymore. Plus his just unfun attitude was really annoying and boring to deal with. I looked around some and found a lot better players who were actually fun to watch, and True just drifted out of my watch list.
---
He's burnt out as fuck. He is a "Dbd streamer," he can't just stop playing even if he wants to. Which he clearly does.
---
So is "If I had Dead Hard I would have made the pallet" or "I don't use Ruin because I have the worst luck with it"....
---
I decided to swap adrenaline for decisive strike the other day, the amount of times adrenaline won’t trigger in a game (I play with rank 20’s aka my friends who are busy in irl) but DS will always trigger for you in those lower rank games.
---
Yeah man he is
---
Annnnnnndddd next week update. Knew it wasn't coming this week after delay.
---
*grins in stake out*
---
Honestly it's a huge problem with the state of the game as a whole. As Otz has stated in a lot of his videos "the problem is that if this perk was better it would be insane on Nurse because every perk is insane on Nurse." There are a lot of perks that, if made stronger, would make the game a lot less fun to play.
---
With that in mind I wish Behaviour would at least *try.* One of my biggest criticisms of the company and how they work with DBD is how *slowly* they try out new ideas. One of the best examples I point to is Streetwise, which didn't have its numbers buffed for **three years** before getting a mere **10% increase. [Ten percent?](/intensifies)** You couldn't have released a ten-fucking-percent increase on the PTB at any point before three years had past? Behaviour is far too scared of a meta shift and they impose all these limits on the perks for pretty much no reason. As quoted by Otz in this thread:
---
&gt;"After successfully grabbing your Obsession from working on a Dull totem, all injured survivors outside of your terror radius that are currently working on a generator that's has less than 50% total progress suffer from the Hemorrhage status effect for 3/5/6 seconds.
---
&gt;The effects of this perk have a cooldown of 45 years."
---
While I respect that Behaviour doesn't want to give us anything overpowered like Mettle of Man I'd honestly much rather a shifting meta where we get periods of the latest thing being overpowered as opposed to a stale meta where everyone runs the same perks for 3 years running. I'd rather have League of Legends than Call of Duty.
---
No.
---
What the hell are you saying?
---
That's not a complete sentence, moron.
---
I’m not strictly for killer or survivor as I play both.  Hell, more survivor than killer actually.
---
But it’s a matter of tactics and understanding it.  Sure, camping isn’t fun for that person. But it CAN work under the right circumstances 
---
I would say always use those tactics though, because they can be outplayed super easy.  It just depends on the situation 
---
For example:
---
Facing a team that constantly stays around you while hooking someone or downing them and unhooks the second you start walking away.  These survivors may fall victim to camp/tunnels, as they become blatantly obvious how they will play.
---
...what? Why does it matter?
---
Ive watched several of his videos, he really isn't toxic from what I've seen. Cussing to yourself/stream and not shit talking to the survivors/killers directly isn't toxic. Hell cussing in general isn't toxic. Hes nothing like OG Tyler1 or Tobias Fate. Who are actually toxic.
---
I don't want all of these changes together. Honestly I think that if Second Wind didn't have an activation requirement the heal time should probably be made longer. (About 5 to 10 seconds longer at all ranks.)
---
This one time I literally had a Bill throw down the Killer Shack Pallet in the first 15 seconds of the game. Turns out he was rank 20. Gotta love the shitty matchmaking.
---
Unless its the unicorn block. If I suspect its a Swf that might run OoO I run unicorn block, and a green skipping rope
---
Gotta remind myself to stockpile on halloween items. I love having event stuff.
---
So cute!! Pigs in my experience are always super nice, and the artwork is so good. Don't sell yourself short with that mediocre, this is great!
---
25% in 5 sec? Yes
---
play killer sometimes. it'll improve your understanding of what tools a killer has to find you, and you'll end up being able to use that knowledge to improve your survivor game
---
Halloween in November?
---
Gives me another week to dc on nurse and not give a shit lol
---
Very nice! Now do the survivors!
---
YES!!!! I JUST WANNA BE A FRIENDLY GHOST :(
---
I don't understand why people downvoted this
---
Agreed, I’m more likely to give a mercy escape if the last survivor played really well and I enjoyed the final hunt for them.
---
No... He's not. Freddy gets hard countered by OoO.
---
Honestly there has to be a pip security system.
---
After 2 DC’s your pip is automatically secured.
---
Same works with survivors.
---
What if you [actually understood that they’re fixing bugs]
---
But god said [these memes]
---
They should rename the event “Withering Expectations”
---
Correction: they *hope* to give us info tomorrow.
---
With BHVR everything's always vague and non-committal. Dedicated servers have been enabled for weeks now, but are still in a vague, no-statement "testing phase", probably because they are scared to go and officially say "these servers that don't really improve the gameplay and add nothing new and actually make laghits worse are the final product we've been working on and hyping up for over a year now, enjoy!". Instead they are saying "test" and "first step" and "we hope in the future we might be able to do more with these servers" (like using them to improve hit reg - you know, the very thing people wanted servers for to begin with).
---
The new party handling system and even keeping the lobby active when a killer dodges are things they could have (and did) implemented without servers, so there's not even an excuse why they didn't for years prior (after initially saying they would do it in 2016).
---
Yeah I’d definitely go with the hindrance effect if it’s going to regenerate. Unless you find some way for survivors to counter the photograph, etc.
---
Example: Breaking line of sight with Myers or revealing Ghostface, since both of their abilities give you an exposed effect, but you do have a way to counter them vs. just never being able to be seen.
---
Oh nice.
---
Yeah right now I have Spirit Unlocked and have her Hallowed blight Costume, but Plague has always sounded kind of cool.
---
At least they're giving info. I'm pretty sure they're doing their 200%, i just ask for info. every 2 days or so.
---
Honestly when I first started playing this was a thing I did just out of a sign of defeat, but then I realized some of the killers would keep dragging me around so I let it go, now I do it every game regardless of it's a benevolent killer or not
---
Something is seriously fucking wrong with you.
---
What if you took your time out of your dayto post this comment
---
If a person doesn't cleanse their infection rises on it's own, and then they become broken correct?
---
Actually I should just watch the video but thank you!
---
But god said OP also took time to reply
---

It’s enough to make a grown man cry
---
Seriously though, this was awesome !!
---
Yeah. lost my pips, my Addons, and my offerings. For a game where I walked for 5 seconds.
---
laughs in terror radius
---
Most killers make the mistake of walking directly to the totem as the first thing in the match, which in turn just shows all survivors exactly where it is. 
---
So unless you have a trap to put down by it, just leave it.
---
yeah basically
---
Nvm this is silly 😂
---
You are obviously mad because you don’t have bubba dlc get good survivor he is just playing smart killer
---
I dont wiggle when im on death hook......
---
Im not really offered hatch too often. So.... haha
---
They just tweeted about it
---
it would also make it more toxic, and incentivize cheating (for excample wallhacks:).
---
I'm not claiming they're indie or anything, but the amount of hate on here is insane. They missed a date, and yeah it's inappropriate but I wish the community would just chill out a bit. Yeah, they've done shitty stuff, yeah missing that date was bad, but all of us are playing a game they made that (I would hope) we enjoy. I agree with many of your points, but I just find the amount of hate insane is all.

---
God I’m being jebaited a lot.
---
&gt; be me
---
&gt; jump on Xbox for event.
---
&gt; new update.
---
&gt; fucking rocket league.
---
Leave what?
---
I thought I'd make it the whole week without seeing this meme, but imagine my surprise when it was Claudette instead of Wraith.  
---
5/10
---
Normally i'm all about giving them a break when things go wrong with an update, but this is a Halloween event for a horror game! This stuff should be ready to go Oct 1st even if you have no plans to release it until the middle of the month. 
---
If there's one update every year they need to not mess up, its this one. I'm not confident at all that we'll get the event before next Tuesday which would already be the 29th.
---
I play console, Nurse has been Q tier since release.
---
Yes in DBD it's based off tiers, and both the sections are tied to each tier. Meaning you could complete the whole set of 70 tiers, then buy the pass so you know you'll have everything.
---
Wow. God forbid we give the devs a bit of extra money(that can be a one time payment if you play enough) so they can further improve this game we love. Especially since none of the content even has any actual effect on the game.
---
But I spawn on ruin as survivor in most of my matches so I’m kinda glad you’re not telling them to check on it first so I can get that out of the way lmao
---
But does he cry like a bitch while injured?
---
That’s why I don’t run any Hex perks, even Ruin. They’re not consistent enough for me to run unfortunately
---
Freddy is very simple and easy to learn along with being very strong. Spirit is harder to learn but definitely stronger. Either of the two is a good choice.
---
Its hard to argue with people that don't know whats best for them.. Sadly too many of you are eager to accept this system that is absolutely not at all designed with you in mind
---
It's adorable! I'm having a shitty and it made my day so much better! Keep drawing! 💕
---
Ok we get it, otzdarva good
---
The community/Game, whatever dude, don't take it too serious.
---
I will change her stats to lower her base abilities so these actually matter👍
---
What advantage are you imagining, exactly?
---
Damn I wish I was as cool as you’re making Kate sound lol
---
Very cute
---
I mean I already left the wreck we once could call hype train.
---
Let's not be disingenuous. Cursing survivors out to yourself out loud is 5000% different from deciding to go into in game chat and start slinging insults around. To say that he has episodes that are even worse than "toxic" streamers is a HUGE stretch. He'll drop C-bombs but in the EU that word doesn't carry the same weight at all.   
---
Being toxic isn't "not getting tilted." Being toxic is *being toxic*. To be toxic you have to spread, you have to be poisonous to other people and make others toxic just through contacting you. That's not at all what he does.
---
If you don't support a Battle pass, don't buy it. Simple
---
It's me! [Hashtag Trashly](https://instagram.com/dragtrashly/)
---
I mean clown may not be smiling but he sure does laugh a lot.
---
Not sure where exactly Q tier falls but I'll just say this: Balancing a character, item, mechanic, aspect of a video game is not a penance process and it should not be treated as such. All the "penance process" mentality gets people is left in a position where the people who liked whatever it was that was overcorrected frustrated that it happened and it creates a divide between them and people who are happy that they borderline never get to see the thing again.
---
This is so Wholesome!
---
Naw i want strugfle points
---
So did they ever mention why the update was delayed?
---
This sub will eat up anything with the pig and a wholesome-ish theme to it.
---
I can follow survivors fine even blinded by sound, but it is funny when they can't even blind you at pallets and give you a free hit down. Bonus points if they do it again and don't catch on.
---
I will never hear anything better than describing the pig with “her dirty trash mullet in her plumber pants”.
---
It's a meme about a teacher arriving 15 minutes late to class you're legally allowed to leave, and its just for shits and gigs
---
I think things like that *need* a requirement, otherwise it's another DS all over again. And let's be honest, Inner Strength works like a charm even despite it having a requirement. Other question is, how hard it is to execute that requirement. And it's where Second Wind fails miserably.
---
I never use those offerings because of that. Almost each time I’ve used them, the killer finds me first. I’m assuming good killers just go to the opposite side of the map to check because the offering is hidden and the only other hidden ones are ones that group survivors together (I believe)
---
I think I was a little unclear in my post, and I apologize for that. They messed up, pretty badly, and I agree with that. I just think they're getting an insane amount of flak, especially here. I get that what they did was bad but I just want to go back to what this sub is about; a community based around a game we all enjoy.
---
You've Got Red On You: The Killer's red stain is extended by 5/8/10 meters.
---

Feels bad.
---
I’m actually saying sorry on behalf of all dcs even tho I’ve dc’d like twice.
---
Switch when it’s corn/swamp map and you’re looking for survivors.
---
They’re gonna tell us when the winter event starts....
---
This is really good. I never understood how people could draw so well. I can barely write my name since my handwriting is so crap.
---
Christ this meme is stale.
---
no? i think she has decisive strike so nobody really wants to deal with her
---
Stop being a merciful killer, please.   
---
Not every survivor wants to be given a pity hatch. Some want to play the game the way it's meant to be played.
---
They actually posted a twitter update today, so I guess they are still keeping us posted.
---
&gt; For some people not giving the hatch is mean and sweaty
---
Oh I met this kind of guy. Funny weirdo, that guy. I'm lucky he didn't thought I owe him a BJ for a nice game tho.
---
Points for points. A fair trade.
---
I don’t see enough of them to really form an opinion. I usually tend to not judge survivors based on their mains (except for perks they may have, like a David will prob have deadhard, etc). I still take mercy on players who are obviously new and punish survivors that teabag and flashlight click every time they drop a pallet.
---
Nurse absoultey needed all the changes she recieved.
---
Basekit nurse is only slightly worse than she was and her addons have been nerfed accordingly. Shes still the best killer in the game but she at least takes some skill now to get there
---
I do this everytime &amp; I play with my girlfriend &amp; I never wiggle &amp; I usually always get dropped at hatch as the last survivor. She always wonders how I get so lucky lol.
---
I feel like if this pass goes well and it becomes a good way for people to get the skins they make while also paying money for them with the pass, on top of all of the skins people buy right now, tht the game might eventually shift to free to play. I don't get why people don't understand that just because there's a battle pass in the game that a lot of free games use that the game needs to be free for it. They aren't free because they don't have the playerbase or the revenue to support it being free yet but if it gains enough support or more people buying in game things then maybe it will be free who knows
---
stupid survivor should've known not to look directly at you with OoO if he was trying to cleanse your totem. he set himself up to get killed.
---
Glad to see you reconsider and make another! I love the art style!
---
I can def agree with this, my build isn’t for looping so my chases are either one and done or I get lucky and scurry away. But I do try to play as if I’m actually in the game and try to avoid doing things like popping out and tea bagging in the killers face as I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t do that to a killer in real life, although it would be pretty epic lol
---
I do this, but then I let them escape by the gate. I want those hatch close points - especially if it was a short match or there were dcs.
---
Killers need to stop being "merciful" and play the game until it's over. Not give the last survivor the hatch.
---
Apparently we’re getting a status report tomorrow so save those bastards lied to me until then.
---
If they come through and tell us what is happening that’ll make my day.
---
Kate mains tend to be fine. Biker skin Kates I've found can be toxic at times. But I more worry about Clauds and Neas. I prefer Kates any day. This Ghostyboi main spares those who teabag with me during hatch hunt. And my Scoops Ahoy Steves. You may live my sweet scoopy Steves. But only if you live long enough to give ya the hatch.
---
Also, survivors get points for opening the gate.
---
&gt;Because it was so quick I felt bad and wanted to let the last survivor live
---
Stop feeling bad! It's just a game!
---
I wish I'd been the one who inspired you for that comic hahaha
---
Pretty much. I know that as a killer if I see a hidden survivor offering I know it’s either grouped together or that so. Not to mention I usually start by walking to the far end of the map anyway, because survivors never spawn too close to the killer anyways
---
In my opinion (separate from the stereotypes), I generally am relieved to get a wraith. In my experience, most Wraiths I play against are pretty bad at the game. I assume it’s because new killers think his invisibility power is gonna help them, but then they don’t know how to work it well enough for it to help them. Other than that I imagine he could be a good killer if you play him right.
---
Pretty much every killer is add on reliant though.  Doctor is trash without his add ons, Billy is no where near as scary without drift or charge add ons, trapper baseline one trap and base speed is trash.  
---
Sorry the S tier killer that dominates the PC world is getting brought down a few rungs.
---
Take my blue arrow.
---
She has always required skill to be the best killer in the game. Ironically she's the only killer where it is 100% skill based. She's slower than you and needs her power to beat you. If you are the better player, you'll juke her and she'll lose you. If she is the better player she will catch you and down you. She can't bloodlust at pallets. She's always been the most skill based killer in the game.
---
I'd go with Ghost face. Brough him about a month ago and I've used him ever since. Such a fun sneaky killer. Use his power to have no red stain or terror radius, do t really bother with exposing them, just pure yank them off gens haha. He had my vote.
---
Legion is THE weakest killer (according to me), so putting wraith with legion really does mean he is weak
---
otz usually use slugging strategy, that wasnt i expecting from popular streamer, ( slugging is ez since u need 1 hook each survivor and make slugged survivor bait ). i prefer normal balance game play like hooking, chasing, hooking chasing like tru3talent or monto or panda which is play game more balance and pick both sides ( otz play killer like 8 in 10 matches )
---
No you can increase it
---
So the solution would be to make LESS addon reliant killers, not more of them. 
---
And quit with the condescension.
---
That's EXACTLY what it is and I never thought about it before. Such weird people dropping survivors off at the hatch instead of killing them.
---
Does leader increase vault speed ?

---
Yea looked like he panicked and didn’t want him to try and crawl away. Should have ran the other out or downed him then picked him up.
---
Less on the free side is incentive to get you to buy the pass, but like the dude you commented on said you can wait to buy it until you're through most of the pass and it will unlock the things from the levels before you bought it when you do so you could just wait until it's capped out if you wanted to buy it
---
I never play for stealth so I honestly dont care how easy I am to track with how many un-mind game able pallets are in this game
---
That's fucking hilarious. Mean, but funny.
---
That’s true I don’t see many of her either, maybe that’s why she doesn’t have a really solid stereotype like other survs. I honestly only started playing with her once I realized I could change her hair color to what mine is in real life, now I luv her &lt;3
---
He’s not really that op. He’s pretty bad in higher tiers especially considering he doesn’t have anything to help him in a chase other than the small speed burts after coming out of invis (which good survivors will know and watch out for)
---
Unforseen circumstances
---
I know it used to back when it was only 9%, but I believe they took that away when buffing it to 25%. I’m not *entirely* sure if that’s the case though
---
As a killer main sometimes I see this and just think to myself  "okaaay just this once you little bean but I better not find you again."
---
People really overexaggerate nurses skill level. It takes a few games to get a handle of nurse, and for that she ignores literally everything. Base nurse is fine, and can be countered somewhat though the small nerf is great given shes the top killer since she was released. 
---
Omegablink/ 3+blink had no counter whatsoever
---
Somebody could use these and make a mini dbd pixel game
---
You must be blind cause it’s impossible for any survivor to hide from me on that map
---
But how can I excuse my bad gameplay?!
---
Lithe is the worst of the 4 imo, because once the killer knows you have lithe, your options become very predictable.
---
I don't see a lot of stuff by THE MERKINS here and I thought you guys would enjoy it. We just need Jason to finish the full on boy band.
---
In my experience they're often not that enjoyable to play against, but I don't see them very often so that might be bad luck/saltiness on my part.   
---
That made this one so remarkable to me though, especially since 2 already escaped through the hatch, which I know most killers hate. It's like a month ago already and I still love that pig.
---
Are you new here? Because BHVR literally cannot update or change anything about this game without it being buggier than an ancient crypt. 
---
They'll release it and half the stuff still won't work, but they won't extend any potential double-BP period to account for that, and thus everyone will be angry still.
---
Or as I like to call it: hex ruin my day by spawning right next to the totem
---
If only lol we were going to do shots where I jumped up but forgot about it
---
You just read that somewhere and tried to apply it here to sound smart, didn't you? You should search up what Stockholm Syndrome actually is next time.
---
meh, otz is optimal playing killer. but not good killer since he slugging almost all game which is easy game play that u need only 1 hook survivor instead 3 ( phase 1, phase 2, dead )
---
Please no don't add a battle pass those things are ruining everything
---
That is the current state of the game my friend.  How many killers would you say are effective without add ons at red ranks?  I can't play bing bong up there without two purples, clown's a joke without extra bottles or bigger gas (now he's slightly less of a joke), hag needs the teleport distance add ons, Mikey needs his Dead Rabbit.  
---
Why should nurse have been the only killer that doesn't need add ons to dominate?  She's the only real stand out.
---
Take upvote for being smort boi
---
Seems like my job is done here!
---
Thank you though \^\^
---
Except the amount of times a killer will actually give you a hatch is a drop in the ocean. Not worth
---
As much as you think her skill level isn't that high, it's still the highest thing DBD has. 
---
"that she ignores literally everything"
---
I hate this argument. She ignores all of what she ignores at a VERY SPECIFIC COST. She's SLOWER than survivors. She NEEDS to ignore and flip chases on their heads or else she's D tier at best. This "oh she ignores core chase mechanics so she must be OP" yeah fuck off. Legion ignores core chase mechanics, does that suddenly make him auto S tier? Last I checked, no it doesn't. 
---
"Omegablink/ 3+blink had no counter whatsoever"
---
I literally said both of those need removed but yeah go ahead and insinuate that I never said that.
---
" shes the top killer since she was released."
---
BALANCE IS NOT A PENANCE PROCESS. You do not gut things just bc they used to be OP. That's how you piss off everyone who enjoys whatever it is and divide the community by force.

More perks, more options. Some incredibly strong perks are stuck behind a pay wall (BBQ&amp;chili, pwyf, stbfl, make your choice are some examples for killers, for survivors you have decisive strike, and the strongest perk in the game, object of obsession).
---
Even perks that are not considered as good still enable different powerful builds that cannot be achieved without spending money (eg. inner strength combined with other perks can be very strong)
---
I never had any problems with survivors like people say. I play a lot more survivor, but have 400 hours on clown alone and every single time survivors are teabagging or messing around i just try my hardest and almost always i win
---
I don't think so, and I wish. The devs seem to forget that Freddy's invisible to awake survivors outside of a certain radius, and that makes him a stealth killer too.
---
Played in red ranks for a bit. They went out of their way to tease hatch and gate to me only to hook me. 
---
My favorites are the cannibals who down me and rev their chainsaw in my ear for 5 minutes straight
---
Well done!
---
I don’t think you understand that a P3 Blendette is also a survivor...
---
Whispers is a perk that makes noises within a certain range of a survivor. Stridor makes a survivors breathing louder. Object of obsession let's the survivor see the killer when looking in their direction, at the downside of the killer seeing them too. Scratch marks are visible lines that the killer can see when a survivor runs. They last for around 8 seconds if I can remember correctly and are bright red.
---
He runs noed though.
---
Mood
---
Leaderboars can be cool I like that
---
I had a ghostface pick me up and carry me around looking for the hatch. We found it. He drops me, walks over to the hatch and closed it to be toxic of course. My adrenaline popped and I had a key so I jump in as he swung at me. 
---
“Dont wiggle! You’ll get the hatch!” No. There are toxic pieces of shit in the fog.
---
Ohhh, don't mind me while I'm gonna post there
---
Have you seen hawkins lab to this day I can't find a totem
---
Punishable by death.
---
Good eye sniper
---
How many times are we gonna see this new player spirit meme?!
---
It’s better than walking the entire game until the killer starts coming for you. And it’s only predictable if you act predictable. Faking vaults and other shit is a good way to confuse them, and besides that it almost always works the 1st chase
---
And stop arguing so hard for anti consumer practices.  Imagine thinking they created the system with you in mind LMAO
---
True true
---
The doctor is actually African American
---
What happened to that game?
---
you are the one who play, you know what is right what is not. camping and tunneling specially not at exit gate open is okay. but at start the game its not. why? i believe you already know what reason and why. you can do it? yes you can, you play what you want. its about standart anyway. i play both roles. if i found killer face camping or tunneling me. that is not fun at all. i play for fun, so i wont take any fun from other player if i play killer.
---
I was referring to P3 Blendettes *specifically*.
---
I’m the same way with the game For Honor💀
---
It’s just a literal joke, not a new player being spirit joke... well at least it’s supposed to be a literal joke... it’s referring to how the new player is confused in terms of THINKING they bought the grudge girl, but they “got the spirit”.
---
I don't think you understand what he was saying.  If you're being a *merciful* killer (not hooking the last guy, so sacrifice points you brought up are moot) the survivor you're letting escape will benefit more points with escaping through the hatch as opposed to having them leave via the gate.  Comparatively the killer doesn't receive a crap load of points from closing the hatch, so often times it is a better gain to have the survivor poke a few generators or drop a few pallets for you to break before you let them take the hatch, that way both sides receive the most bloodpoints possible in a merciful ending.
---
Just died HARD. Devs were supposedly being dicks, everyone in the community hated them, etc.
---
Browsing r/all and legit thought I was on rainbow6 subreddit. RIP to this community too gl trying to convince the devs not to do it

Type of Bug: Game Won't Load Into Menu
---
Description: I haven't been able to play the game for almost five months now. I've sent several tickets to dead by daylight support but nothing has been solved. It originally started as error 8013, but now it has developed to it saying "Your status ins team is currently offline. All game functionality is unavailable under these circumstances. Please make sure your internet connection and steam connection is active." It says this as the game goes to load into the menu. My steam is online, and I have a feeling it is something to do with the internet connection, however all my other games work. It's getting really frustrating at this point and I would love to be able to play the game again.
---
Honestly that's not all that rude. Yeah sure he could have been more polite but it's a pretty neutral comment.
---
Because she’s being brought down to the same level as Trapper? Wraith? Plague? Where I have to run the same fucking addons every single game? Ur damn fucking right I’m mad about that. The game is already skewed towards survivors, Nurse was the only killer that was more powerful than a group of SWF playing optimally. 
---
More accessible? Lmao yeah 2 cool downs for the same fucking ability yeah real user friendly and accessible. 
---
I don’t prestige anything bc I don’t wanna go through the grind for perks and addons again. I have hundreds of addons burning holes in my inventory that I never want to use. Now instead of playing with new addons I’m forced to burn the same ones every. Single. Game.
---
And you aren’t reading at all. I clearly said that I agree Nurse needed nerfed. Not like this
---
You gotta be a Spooky Sneaky Stalky Boy to stab them in the spine. I love scaring survivors and sneaking around. And as long as I teabag first I don't attack. Or if they slowly teabag and wait for a response. But pallet throw and teabag? Oooooh you 'gon get it. Teabagging to communicate with GhostFace is easier than others because he can speak the same language. And pig but GF is more fluent.
---
But 9 times out of 10 killers won’t give hatch or escape and my anti-slug build is all about wiggling out
---
I never wiggle and still get hooked most of the time 🥴
---
I really love the tiny hag
---
Now that was totally unexpected /s
---
No but seriously, I haven't played her for more than 1 and a half years. It's just too easy and becomes boring pretty fast once you hit a certain skill level. Got that flair just because of my Legacy 3 Nurse.
---
Bubba worse than legion? Is this some kind of sick joke? At least bubba can do something with his power, Legion might as well not have a power.
---
FINALLY SOMEONE SAYS IT 
---
SO SO many times I'll try to give last the hatch and they start to wiggle so I drop them and say "no" by looking left and right (I'm on console) and then I pick them back up and if they wiggle again I'm like " *sigh* what a shame"
---
shush, don't tell anyone
---
BUT IT'S THE SAME MEME, THEY CHANGED ONLY ONE WORD
---
Yeah, it would be super cute :)
---
You’re next, _*DWIGHT*_
---
SICK shot! HA!
---
But the points
---
You aren't otz...
---
Again, Ignorance.
---
This is free cosmetics, A lot of people don't have money to dispose of on the game. Now if they can scrape together enough auric cells for one pass, they might be able to get them all.
---
&gt;Imagine thinking they created the system with you in mind LMAO
---
Well I personally like battle passes so while they may not have made it with me in mind, I'm happy with it.
---
What changed?
---
I always spare last if they don't wiggle. Also if there's multiple dcs I just farm with them because their game was ruined anyway and it's not fair for either of us.
---
"i proxy camp ( which is looking around the hook ) if i see someone close i will not leaving the hook" , well how the hell survivor going to unhook if not going close to the hook? can they unhook like 100 miles away so u wont camping? that is just an excuse to camping. but hey, play what you want.
---
It's like when designing a killer perk nowadays devs have to say to themselves, "Ok it's good, but we can't make it too good because it might upset the majority of our player base. Why don't we reduce it's effect and give it a timer?"
---
This.  Except I didn't have MORI.  As a killer I pretty much always allow the last survivor to live.  If it's down to 2 survivors and 1 of them is toxic, I kill the toxic one, and let the other live.  I did this once with a David.  Caught him in a bear trap, downed him, and left him there.  Hunted and killed the Claudette.  Came back to David, carried him to the hatch, and dropped him at it.  Waited for a couple minutes, swinging at the hatch.  He went afk.  So I closed the hatch and murdered him.
---
Damm holy shit
---
Shut
---
"Grudge Girl", Last time was something about stranger things. This meme was posted inumerous times.
---
Yeah... I know, but I'm talking about a functional competitor if you dont care about bloodpoints
---
Wow, this post is getting a lot of hate. I think the meme itself is pretty light hearted and fun. : /
---
Youre happy with it and insist everyone else should be yet you try to claim Im the one with ignorance lmao.  Delusional.
---
It's so so so good, what are you on about? Simple doesn't equal mediocre :3
---
Hence why you give hatch when you can. Why would you want to pip as killer, when every regular match is a guaranteed 1-2 pips
---
70 to 80 hours is what you need to unlock everything, the rift stays for two months and ten days  I play 10 hours per week in the worst case I have everything in the last days of the rift
---
Yeah Lauries get the short end of the stick because she has DS as base kit. Most killers would rather use their Mori on you and get you outta the game than risk a DS after that first hook.
---
Edit: Spelling
---
Yet the battlepass is a huge money maker...Can't tell if you're trolling or just dumb
---
It's funny to camp the hatch with Pig Wraith or GhostFace
---
I don't mind killers camping late game or even tunneling when the exit gates are powered/open, but if you camp at the first person you hook you're a straight up cunt. (With the exception of the survivors being toxic first lmao)
---
What does this even mean?
---
Tiny Freddy is defiantly my fave
---
Every regular match ISN'T guaranteed 1-2 pips. I've depiped from a 3k. Ive black piped a 4k.
---
ah i dont like the name. look like going copy hunter from identity v.
---
Oh yeah it's big brain time
---
&gt; Youre happy with it and insist everyone else should be
---
Nowhere did I insist everyone should be so stop pulling shit out of your ass. 
---
I just called you out for your bullshit response of "I know what's best for you all so it's pointless discussing it."
---
Can confirm. Don’t wiggle and 9/10 I’ll hatch you. Wiggling as last survivor is begging for a hook.
---
Yikes, you're way off base.
---
People do that to BM all the time
---
That is beyond adorable. I love it.
---
Did she boop the snoot?
---
I mean... I always hope the killers have noed and 4k if the survivors are fecking bullys :P You get what you deserve. Sometimes, at least!
---
Legion has insane stall potential. Go against my rank 1 Legion you will stop underestimating this killer right away
---
Excuse me? When did the add that window?!
---
Well, thank you. I also thought it was pretty lighthearted.
---
Le salt😌
---
Isn't everything that we so both
---
borrowed time need rework and buff it so downed survivor and recovered will be have endurance too. all to avoid the slugger
---
I actually did it myself, I bought a cheap Ghostface mask as a template and did some changes. Its not done yet though, I wanna add the hood someday. I believe you can buy a Ghostface mask like this on Etsy tho I'm not sure
---
They always fill the hole just right.
---
It is legitimately more often a power trip.  I want you to know that **I allowed you to escape.**  How can you know that if you wiggle free, and run to the hatch yourself?  Fuck that, you will be dropped at the hatch ***by me*** or get nothing.  Absolutely a power trip.
---
Cursing at someone, behind their back or not is still cursing them...
---
Brought to the same level as any of the killers?  You think those billies and spirits in red ranks are playing all of their games add on free?
---
I am reading what you're putting down my friend, and I'm telling you the straight facts.  She is getting brought in line with the other high tier killers and will have to use add ons.  Don't be disingenuous and try to say "she'll be the same as trapper, wraith and plague," bruh all killers use add ons.  Nurse is the only one that generally didn't have to because of the muscle memory issue.
---
At this point, i just hope we get it by Halloween.
---
People are never grateful to be alive ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Everyone says she's weak but Myers is strong - Plague has permanent instadowns or omega puke if they cleanse, Myers needs to stalk for ages to get tier 3. Yes, he has faster vault and longer lunge but meh, imo Plague is better than him.
---
Her main problem is genrush tho. They are broken so they don't waste time on healing/selfcaring, they are just doing gens. Infectious Fright is very good on her, because of her snowball potential. Play with your food is great too, she doesn;t loose stacks so easily(vile piurge doesn't waste stacks, so you can break them and m1) Pop for regression, ruin or corrupt, discordance. Some people like spirit fury + enduring, because of her oneshot potential, but I'm not the biggest fun of it. Watch some Fungoose videos about her \^\_\^ He had 105 win strike on her, but I'm not sure. Rotation is the most important, get everyone sick asap, don't waste too much time on one survivor.
---
She still can get fcked by maps like almost every other killer, but Spirit.
---
Found the hurt feelings. lol
---
I'm sure he "seemed to enjoy it" and you didn't shove his head into it forcefully
---
If Freddy isn't chasing me, I am going to step on the trap to eat it. I will know if he sees me when OoO lights up, whether I see his aura or not. If he begins chasing me, that's still time he wasted on a different chase that he has left, and that's all Object needs to do to be a good perk.
---
If he started on me, which I wouldn't just let him, I have to step in a trap for me to become blind (and hit if I was awake), but I always know where he places his traps.
---
This is all assuming he's brought the exact right add-on to try to soft counter my perk.
---
I think it has to be related to playing or owning the game at a certain time. I played a few rounds when i bought the game and didn't play for a long time because of some jerks right off the bat but when I got back into it and figured things out I already had it and I cant look now but I don't think I got an achievement the first time I picked the game up.
---
They 3 gen themselves meaning all the gens that were left were really close together so he stood still while cloaked which makes you completely invisible you don’t even have your outline anymore and waited for someone to walk into him
---
Well said, the difference between the two toxic versions is that one is sweaty, and one is mockery. I personally found mockery to be the worse one, since they really mean to annoy and provoke you while you just try to play the game. It doesn't feel like an act against me instead of something inside the game
---
I was thinking about it for a long time but so far I haven't seen a good one. Making one myself would be out of my league though
---
that was 1 year ago
---
gen rush is not a thing
---
be toxic? idk, is it affecting the gameplay?
---
play with ds? that was 1 year ago, now ds is not best
---
I forgot , but I will boop the snoot next time!
---
He probably doesn't have legacy he's just trying to act cool
---
when you’re too bad to complete gens
---
I never wiggle as last person in hopes they gift me a hatch but if they hang me they hang me. Its not much but its honest work for killers
---
Great now I'll get called out for being an Insidious Gen Camper... In all seriousness though amazing artwork :)
---
Ehh, as someone that uses WoO on their build I don't think it's really needed. It would be a decent buff sure but that would just nerf a Freddy who is already nerfing themselves by opting for pallets over snares. No need for it especially with how many different ways are available to wake up now.
---
Indeed, i only camp when the gates are powered, its highly un-rewarding to camp at the begining.
---
why do you hate wiggling? new player
---
It really isn't that common.  The people who give mercy hatches are indeed the minority.  Based on only my experience I'd say a mercy hatch happens in roughly 6% of my matches.
---
the battlepass is a scam, While you have to pay for the game they also want you to pay for more than half the roster of characters. Its such a grind of a game. The game already has it dedicated playerbase that will buy anything this game throws out.
---
Yeah, and then they complain on forum how killers are broken, and then we are suprised each killer game is so tight and frustrating.
---
you can remember who is you hook anyway. if you not remember it and instantly grab him to the hook and got DS. its not DS fault. if you says they are 4 man 3p claudette, you can know who is the hook on survivor icon.
---
I remember watching him go from 2nd story asylum to a window on the first floor as Myers. I just had to sub on twitch.
---
Original
---
Thank you! It's mostly that I just started out with making comics (like this is literally the second), so I feel like there is still so much to learn, but I'm excited for that though :')
---
Hahaha downvoted for idiocy dwi
---
ELI5: the difference and strategy of OoO and SWF. I dont even know what those are. I'd like to. :)
---
That moment when you're an absolute ape
---
What's that? Wait nvm I'll google it. Edit: Oh..OH it's like coraline and dbd had a baby.....cute. Yeah no I'm not copying that game however I should do research to see if I can draw inspiration from it.
---
*laughs in Decisive Strike*
---
Enjoy it, endless looping, god loops, 20 pallets all over the map. We as killers dont have much fun either. Have a good day.
---
I've always hated kate and cant explain why.
---
So this is why this game never took off, hmm
---
Right? Geez I know *I* died at least twice just waiting for a tweet, when will the torture END!?!?!?
---
talent
---
The chases the main focus of the game, that is what's fun for both sides, direct interaction between surv and killer instead of just walking around or holding m1 on gens.
---
I mean you do what u want, dont let ppl tell u how to play, but u aren't playing as well as u can be by tunneling and camping and this is coming from a killer main. You can get so many mpre points and pip by prolonging the game as best u can, but if the survivors are obviously better than you then u should definitely use wtv tactics necessary to win. That being said u should try a less lethal playstyle to maximize your rewards
---
Thank you \^\_\^
---
this is an old clip but i had never seen it before that and i have never noticed it since.
---
Yes same exact issues, still in need of some patches, when we will get them, fuck knows lol... It also depends on what map/killer I'm on with the FPS, on Hawkins against spirit is very poor, makes people quit half the time, which ain't good for anyone.
---
Kate’s are usually not toxic but they seem to want to try risky stuff and stupid shit ie body blocking killer mid chase, flashlight blinding a killer even though he’s moving running at full speeds attempting to get a pallet save stuff like that BUT the minute you see a Kate in that winter skin she’s about 80% likely to be toxic I don’t even know why this is just what I noticed  
---
PS my survivor main is Kate
---
I never posted this before. I’ve never seen any grudge girl posts before here. Need a link so I can understand, got any?
---
Idk why bhvr isnt giving bans to people like this. you wont get new players cus the current players are jerks.
---
They can get banned for telling you to jump in front of a bus, hope you reported them, the last thing we need are people like them playing this game
---
You say this but let’s be real here
---
*we’re here forever*
---
Yeah I saw that too and made me facepalm
---
I always dump this one
---
It's not dead, it's in the Discord Zone. F13 still has players, it's just paralyzed for apparently life. White Noise 2 is dead, but for the record, it's a way better game. Undermarketing can kill anything.
---
Biker skin toxic???? Nah it’s the winter skin that’s toxic
---
Agreed, definitely would rather teabag with Ghostface rather than Bubba lol
---
Just ignore the toxity and move on is really important. I don't necessarily agree on the reports since as a survivor I will see more tunneling in the game than the killer does, and as a killer I will see more I'll will than there is, but move on is the best thing to do
---
This. Can't give a shit if someone is toxic, I can make their game miserable without ruining it for myself, but can't stand boring players, that's the type of shit that's actually annoying.
---
I've died plenty of times for this reason.  Would I like to escape?  Sure.  Am I okay dying so someone else can survive?  Yup.  I've ran right up to killers, spin around in front of them, until they smack me down and hook me.
---
Probably had something to do with the power outage in their office a few days back.
---
Maybe you’re an OG player who remembers her original hook scream lol
---
Yeah, but then they complain you play bad, when you just adapt to their playstyle. And they are angry it works. Then flame you post game lobby because you know how to adapt.
---
Not the Grudge Girl, the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air meme talking about The Spirit
---
I saw this shit too. Completely dumbfounded how this person can be that stupid.
---
Where’d you get that poster???
---
When has that worked? Name one time not buying a BP had stopped the awful copy paste practice.
---
Try playing Civilization, Mcote strongly recommends it.
---
Fucking teammates leaving her behind
---
Awesome sketch you should post the other one
---
It's fucking annoying how whiney some people are. They need to chill the fuck out and move on to the next match.
---
Dying an asshole hurts less than betrayal, though.
---
Buff Hex: ruin?!? 
---
Make it invisible for the first 3 gens
---
Leatherface has an instadown, yes. But compared to other instadown power and add-ons, his is difficult to use. It slows you down heavily, and if you miss you get a hefty cooldown. That's his only benefit. He has no way to track survivors without perks, and no high mobility giving him low map pressure. Legion's power, while lackluster, DOES give you a little bit of tracking. Killer instinct shows you if there are any teammates nearby after you frenzy stab 1 of them. Having an option to injure multiple survivors also forces all of them to waste time healing. Instead if you instadown only 1 of them, that would mean the 2nd person has to come for the save, while 2 others can work on gens unbothered. So I think that's why Legion is ranked slightly higher.
---
How is that different than getting on a lobby with a guy who spent a bunch of money flipping through his cosmetics. People who want to spend money in this game are going to have more stuff making you look like a peon. Its no different. It's cosmetics, if you don't like them or even agree with it don't buy it. Your point doesn't even make any sense unless you're just trying to find more reasons to justify your dislike with their battle pass. I'm probably not even going to get it but I'm just not one to buy much cosmetics in any game really. I do but some, but I don't think I've ever bought any for dbd. I may in the future but how much cosmetics someone else has literally means nothing to me.
---
~~cuz scoops is ten dollars~~
---
#G R O O V Y
---
Doubt that. Baiting killers with ooo and then juking them a couple times to waste their time will get them to avoid you until later. Not a bad use of it. After 4k hours I needed to change something drastically and ooo has been really fun. With half the killers being anti stealth and me missing when stealth was a survivor strength, I'm loving it. So sick of being caught because of stealth killers. Great against the spirit too.
---
Yeah I’m pretty sure it’ll release on the 29th.
---
Thanks ! Yes it is an attempt at Laurie’s face :)

---
Awe that deserves a good snoot boop
---
The only advice i can give is to try and play in the evening, other then that... get lucky?
---
Feral Frenzy is so different from the way the nurse's power functions I can't believe you would try to compare the two.  
---
Legion wasn't broken because of his vaults or runspeed, he was broken because of infinite mending and triple stabs with frenzy and frank's mixtape.  Without those two add on combinations he was still pretty weak against survivors.
---
Seriously? Who says this shit?
---
I agree, I feel very conflicted between wanting to get tf out and be stealthy but also not wanting others to die or be hung by running out thinking I can save them so that does lead to me doing stupid shit lol
---
I love this
---
He had to make a Not All Survivors edit lol
---
SUPER CUTE!
---
I am very skeptical of the math that people did on that. It hasn't been released for real yet and BVHR could have adjusted numbers based on ptb testing which also had bugs. For example, on the archive news page we see a challenge that rewards 3 rift shards and in the newer video we see a similar challenge award 5 rift shards. They could also lower the experience requirement for rift shards or fixed a bug that prevented experience from rolling over to the next rift shard resulting in wasted experience and more time needed.
---
I've felt like a second-class customer ever since buying the game wasn't enough to get half the Killers, even with in-game currency.
---
Well, I’ve been drawing since I was very little and since I’m 22 now I’ve had quite the practice :D thank you :)
---
I like Monto and I think he has a demeanor and sense of humor that can come across rude and douchey but when you watch him, it’s mostly pretty much good fun - but I do have to say his outro doesn’t give the best impression. And sometimes when he’s like “LIKE the VIDEO or the Clown will come play with your bunghole” is a little much, like yeah it’s easy to tell when it’s a joke, and I fully understand YouTube algorithm relies on likes, but demanding likes sometimes can come off a little wrong. 
---
I don’t think he’s a douche, but a newcomer might think so at first. Honestly, all he needs to do is change his outro to be less “all I want is money so get off my f’ing dick” and he’d be golden.
---
Headset:on
---
That’s fucking rude.  You hook non wrigglers?
---
Cry harder
---
Wow thanks man ! Much appreciated :)
---
Thanks !! I will :)
---
Thank you !
---
Had to be something horrible considering how buggy and rushed the last patch was (but was still released).
---
Legit had a game where all I did was protect my ruin. Got all of them. Hell even one of them could have gone off to do a gen. But all good fun after game was just like" MY TOTEM!" and they just said it was their sole objective to break it if nothing else.
---
Didnt slug or camp hooks they all died on 3rd hook. I only attacked people going after totem.
---
Nah, i play survivor fairly often as well, if you think killers dictate the game you are deluded  (WITH ALL THE RESPECT) but, survivors are super easy to play as, with right perks, and skill, Killer is just someone you can litelary circle around and laugh at him, i played enough games againts red ranks to realize your "fair play" wont get me anywhere. If you want someone to play by a code and be "fair" go for a different game.   
---
Those no camp/tunnel rules been invented by survivors to make easier game for them, why we wont make survivor code? No god loops, only one jump trough window, only one loop around objects, why not add that? That would work as well, also NO T-BAGING!!!
---
Can we get rid of forever freddy? Thanks.
---
Thanks 😃
---
I will !! Thanks :)
---
Ah, thanks mate.
---
I love this.
---
These are fantastic, good work lad!
---
Again: healing twice per match and saving a grand total of at most a minute isn't going to be "another DS all over again." I do absolutely agree that Second Wind's full heal requirement makes it awful, as you can get screwed by someone Self Caring for a milisecond. I really think that Second Wind should work like Aftercare in the sense that after you bring someone *up* a health state (IE when they're healed from slugged to injured, or from injured to full) the perk activates. Yes there are some "exploits" that can be done by having your teammates stay at 99% Self Care and then find you to give you your perk but people aren't doing this for Aftercare so I doubt they'd do it for Second Wind.
---
This would also give Second Wind some interesting utility with Aftercare, though honestly AC is kinda counterproductive with SW since less people can heal you to activate its effect on you.
---
Thank you very much!
---
sounds like someone has never actually played plague in ranked before
---
:3 &lt;3
---
Oh I did. No one deserves this response but it's funny because I wasn't even toxic. I mean come on, I used a bloody party streamer, the 3 base perks, didn't camp and for ages in game I couldn't even use M2, couldn't break pallets/gens or vault windows XD Just glad it was me and not someone that would take this to heart. Hopefully they get banned.
---
......What the hell is the point of the battle pass then? :-DD
---
That is not nice...
---
Lol that's crazy. Literally makes no sense. If you left when the store opened then maybe, but because of the battle pass? It's a cosmetic system. You're acting like they installed a pay to win system into the game. There's plenty of reasons to stop playing this game but a battle pass is probably the silliest
---
I reported them, so can only hope aye
---
*she, and to be fair I had already put that in originally but I think it might have been missed..
---
It's beautiful, now all my love is yours
---
BHVR needs help. They have the money now. Something needs to be done about the coding or dev team. They actually don't know how to program and code a video game. Each update is a mess with new bugs.
---
Just had a game with a Nancy who lead me on a super toxic chase and kept flash lighting and beckoning/teabaging me at every pallet, as soon I downed her she disconnected hahaha! This was beginning of game and would of been her first hook
---
Battlepass bad because Fortnite bad. Please give orange internet points.
---
unless he waited at the hook just for you to come running and get close then unhook the person in your face, that was a dck move lol. if you were both running and he got there first, it was his save anyways
---
The uninstall button is the meta for spirit.
---
I'm pretty sure it was supposed to be fixed when the event came out on the 22nd, but so much for that..  
---
Gotta endure *at least* another week of this.
---
Lightborne.
---
We're booing you because it's a repost.
---
YOU KNOW WHAT??? BOTH OF YOU ARE COMPLETELY FUCKING RIGHT AND I NEVER THINK HOW HARD SOLO QUEUE SURVIVORS HAVE IT WHEN IT COMES TO SMALL SHIT LIKE THAT I APOLOGIZE FOR BLAMING SURVIVORS FOR NOT CLEANSING TOTEMS.
---
Normally I'd just disconnect but I was confused as to why they were so mad XD
---
Lol were u one of the ppl who DC'd on me 😑😑😑
---
Prayer beads, MD ring

If you don't have bt and deliverance on Adam, don't play adam
---
Are you hurt because I called survivor main. lol
---
Warframe has whales that pay to win and buy anything they can, Dead by Daylight only has limited amounts of stuff you can buy, and if you buy the first one and are able to complete it then it pays for itself and future rifts are free if you save the 1000 cells earned from each rift to unlock the next one.
---
Ok I’m not trying to be mean but, how could you make such an amazing drawing with so much effort, then post it sideways?
---
The Doctor is good, but only against bad players.
---
His shock doesn't really help in chase unless the survivor makes a mistake.
---
The madness effects are at best a mild annoyance and survivors giving their location doesn't matter if you can't hit them.
---
And I might add: they highly advertised this.
---
Oh i love it
---
There's so many spawns and all 4 survivors gonna spawn on ruin
---
Improbable but possible
---
As you can see the Freddy is kill stealing, and running away with my Feng. We kept slashing at eachother for the entirety of the game and I'd try to drag survivors away and pretend to help them with gens, ended up giving the last guy the hatch. Was just a hilarious set of unusual gameplay 3v2.
---
"JuST FaRM LoL." The nerve of some survivor players.. "It's your fault you didn't stop doing your job effeciently."
---
Well, I wasn‘t taking it srsly I had genuinely no idea.  School is a few years back for me, no clue why pol are down voting lol
---
I don't understand this silly rule(?). If I'm going to let someone go or kill them, I'll just do it with no regard for the wiggles. In fact I dislike to look for the hatch with a survivor on my shoulder, it's so much slower that way than letting them break free.
---
The King of Halloween.
---
Good shit.
---
Exactly what I'm going for! Thank you so much &lt;3
---
r/whoosh
---
The photo wasnt sideways when i took it, for some reason Reddit did this, my apologies xD
---
(Can find the 1st one and more @aviaryart.ncl on Instagram and https://ko-fi.com/aviaryart )
---
I may literally burn my house down if I don't get this event.
---
Plus I’m the one who got hooked with deliverance active and I wanted to use it but instead David decided to unhook me right next to the killer
---
If I recall correctly tl;dr: Lies, shitting on community, being mad at valid criticism and silencing/banning people for it on discord, unfulfilled promises (Kickstarter) and a lack of updates/content, unbalanced game. That's it I think, maybe more.
---
Also. This is their roadmap https://i.redd.it/gjdayrba0z421.jpg
---
They have less than 2 months to release all of that.
---
The Blackest Eyes
---
I love how you say you have to buy it. You do not have to buy the battle pass to keep playing the game. Save your money if you really have a problem with it. We both know you're gonna buy it though, making your whining on reddit irrelevant.
---
(shrug) typical survivor, they're all assholes.
---
I wouldn't mind a speed bonus for every gen if the last one didn't heal you.
---
Yes please, this is awsome
---
I will definately also do freddy, was already planning to :D thank you !
---
The ghostfaces look like the mini bosses you have to beat before you can face the trapper
---
I play against Purps and Reds, and I constantly have what I described. Games are flip floppy. I can down the entire survivor squad in the first 5 minutes and the game just ends there. Or they can be long as fuck.
---
Thank you !!!
---
I don't think I have the heart to put piggy through that lmao
---
OP this is precious.
---
This isn't just a 1 time thing. This is a constant issue. They have millions of dollars at their disposal and refuse to replace incompetent people with those who are competent and proficient at their jobs. It's at the point I'm starting to believe they hired interns just so they don't have to pay them for this shit work they do.
---
Oh no there’s nothing wrong, I just always wonder about that… amazing work btw
---
Looks very good my man, but why the wrong orientation? Would be nice to have it vertical, so I could take a proper look at it
---
A little bit of kindness goes a long way &lt;3
---
It would be good if more gestures other than point and beckon were put into the game like being able to wave. Something non-toxic for killers at the end of a trial.
---
The Devils Eyes !
---
I have watched some videos. I'm a big horror/slasher guy so that's what drew me to the game. Honestly should have had it a long time ago but never heard of it until I saw an ad porting it to switch. I'm still into the role playing aspect I guess you'd say. I really just want to be the famous killers. Freddy is fun. Wish I was better with Myers and ghost face but I think they're all really fun to play as. I convinced some friends to get it and I play survivor with them and I've learned a lot about survivors just playing killer a lot. I almost think survivor can be easier. At least to get that pip. But I've since decided I don't care about that at this point as it's more fun for me to just enjoy the game for how I want it to be. Which is like my favorite scary movies. When I play survivor I want to be scared and I still do get spooked sometimes haha. Plus my wife loves to watch when I okay survivor since it can be suspenseful.  I really like the game and I plan to play it a lot. I'm sure I'll eventually get around to playing more for the points but just trying to have fun overall. Aren't we all?
---
Whenever I see a killer trying to farm I just do the gens and leave. Usually I'll let him hook me twice for my teammates to get points. I dont have enough gaming time to waste 15 minutes farming points.
---
PLEASE do a Ghostface one. You're amazing.💖
---
I would change lullaby for Monitor and Abuse, and Thrill with either Pop or Ruin. Monitor and Abuse with dead rabbit makes his killer radius really in tier 2 out of chase, so you can sneak up on people if you like. Pop or ruin for increased gen time.
---
Wow so it's really happened. Did you befriend her/him?
---
Good girl Miss Piglet. :3
---
It is so funny because he didnt realise you cant vault while phasing and he thought you would just get to him
---
If it’s not dark clothes you’re fine. I hate blendettes, but I have nothing against Claudette’s.
---
The worst punishment for a dcing killer is having to wait another 2 hours to find a new game L0L
---
Punish friendly killers why?
---
They saw this post and gave an uptadete
---
when ur about to head on the killer but someone completes a gen so you get exhausted and just jump out of the locker regular
---
Aw, frank looks so happy
---
The only problem I have with your argument is that the game is over three years old now. Some people already have everything they need, and grinding the battle pass could be the only real reason they have to play, besides waiting for new DLC to drop.
---
Also about the greed, again, it's over 3 years old and still has an active playerbase. All they can do is give us DLC and this battle pass to keep making money. I don't know the financial situation over at bhvr, I'm assuming its pretty damn good because of all the licensed cosmetics we're getting, but still. They gotta keep the game afloat.
---
This is the final nail in the coffin for me and this game. When the dev's decide to announce a Halloween event on October 22nd when other games have been doing it all month, like Final fantasy 14. Then they say something happened and now its been delayed. Really? Stop focusing on cosmetics and your sellable stuff and make the game balanced already.. I won't touch this game until they do. And I can only imagine how this will hurt them.
---
TOO MANY PERKS IN THE PERK POOL!
---
Well.  I guess my punishment is over then, although I still have another three hours before my work shift ends.
---
I could actually get to him there, if you look carefully he is next to an open balcony.
---
Oh not at all! I'm not sure if the other 2 were swf, but when this happened I had almost 500 hours in the game, most of which I spent on survivor. I'm just still very panicky lol
---
That would be pretty cool
---
I was just gonna say - we can't set aside queue times when we're just talking about playing games. Queue times are an intrinsic part of that! I'd play so much more if killer queue times were shorter :( Takes me about 20 minutes to get a game, I lose steam pretty quickly! Bleh.
---
He’s trolling for sure
---
Yeah but just running to the other side of the house and falling would be better
---
Exactly this is why wiggling during the game with others up is key.  I've had survivors do that for me and it's like welp thanks for the free hook upgrade.  You just upgraded us from coach to first class baby!  Please keep your elbows in while they deliver the food.
---
&gt; pay to win because you can buy power.
---
The best killer in the game is free. Almost every good survivor perk is free AND you can get every perk from the shrine for free. Except for licensed characters, you can buy the characters for free. 
---
&gt;Now you get to pay to grind more.
---
If you want to, and for cosmetics only.
---
I didn’t even think about that... I think someone would break a strap off their headset.
---
The logic ur using is that ignore chase mechanics=OP. By your logic Legion is OP bc they ignore chase mechanics. I’m explaining why that’s horseshit
---
I like it. Good use of the meme.
---
They could easily fix legion by changing the whole lose your power if you miss in Frenzy. Let me stab the shit out a survivor multiple times until the power runs out if I want to or run after somebody else if I want to. Keep it that multiple hits doesn't lower the mend timer though to keep it fair.
---
I'd love to wave at people! Though knowing the kind of person I am, maybe a bit too much, it would make me useless lmao
---
Offerings that affect survivor spawning are like maps, the offering just makes sure that the spawn is like you want it
---
oh no
---
It's so nice to see that you are continuing to make these comics. :) I saw your first one and thought it looked great and very cute and this one is the same. Your art style is amazing and please continue!
---
It was a situation where I stalked them as they walked and didn't notice me slowly crouch walking towards them before it was too late. I run a few obsession perks, primarily focusing one guy at a time while I got nurse... Nothing funnier than night shrouding and sneaking up someone as they heal.
---
Thats not even a theory, isn't that what they literally said? Vials are tied to the the rift, and the rift is only in the mid chapter patch. No vials, no rift no event.
---
Downvoted for speaking facts😭
---
regarding the skill check thing, I think I'm going to change it to make it harder to hit skill checks maybe you can't hear or a generator has to be done and you need to hit 5 great skill checks. The reason being that you are using the done generator to shock yourself.
---
No it definitely does. But it’s helpful in that if Freddy is close and puts down one, you can see it go down
---
I just had a killer tell me they wouldn’t give me the hatch because I didn’t wiggle. And a survivor asked me why I didn’t wiggle and that I could have been given hatch if I did.
---
Felt like I was living in bizarro land. All these new players reversing the rules for some reason.
---
Watch the video from Usyllis where he got 39 escapes in a row or whatever. Him and his friends are all on discord and playing super optimally against ridiculous shit like 5 blink nurse, prayer beads spirit, etc.
---
You can get all of those perks for free on the shrine.
---
&gt;the strongest perk in the game, object of obsession
---
Maybe vs ghostface. Vs characters that don't rely on stealth it doesn't do much for you.
---
Spirit outclasses billy and freddy, especially vs good survivors. Ask any experienced player.
---
It‘s on the official Discord server (posted 2 hours ago)
---
This is me as well. So many people as of late have been adding me to their friend list, but I never say anything and then get anxiety when they message me to play with them because I SUCK ass and don't want to ruin their games. lol
---
:D
---
And also, the first perk is very op. Myers doesnt have 3 meters of lunge in t3
---
And you were still nice just carrying her abit. I would teabag the shit out of claudette for this
---
do you mean emblems? emblems don't depend on bloodpoints, as many things which give lots of bloodpoints give nothing toward the emblems
---
also, the higher your rank is, the more emblems you need to save/go up in rank
---
Oh shit really? I Could change it to .5 meters per token.
---
There should be an alert icon for both BT and Deliverance, honestly
---
You think emojis are bad, yet do things like this...? Okay.
---
Again it's two heals through the entirety of the game, which is why I think it's not that big of a deal if you're sacrificing a perk slot for two heals.
---
Adrenaline is a perk slot for a heal and a Sprint Burst so I don't see why Second Wind is that bad by comparison.
---
Ah yes, the classic bufoon who thinks he knows everything about warframe's monetization just because its free.
---
You did such a good job of my baby haggles 😍. Clown needs to be thiccer.
---
D'awwwwwwwwww how sweet!
---
Of course killers get more over a match. That wasn't his point though.
---
I guess that's true. I missed the point above his I guess.
---
Sorry for the 3 Downvotes, I don‘t understand that because you‘re completely right. I just think it‘s a bit annoying to wait for a halloween event that already started in literally every other game
---
Leaderboards would be the worst thing this game could get. Tons of people wanting to boost their ego by spamming mori spirits every game, yeah no thanks.
---
I don’t tend to mind Ruin since most people running it also waste a slot on TOTH and it’s so easy to troll them by tapping the totem and walking away. They get so focused on the totem they forget that they still need to patrol or it doesn’t matter.
---
Yeah for me it's the fact that it's a missed Halloween event in a Horror game. Hell Michael Myers is from Halloween.
---
„We are just as excited as you are for Patch 3.30 [...]“
---
Time to get my boom stick.
---
I'm actually the opposite, I've grown much more comfortable when I can see peoples faces. The hard part is actually meeting people with similar interests since I'm inside most of the time ~~and they're probably too lmao~~
---
I like the idea of the alien, and is definitely more iconic, but with the powers I had in mind the perdalien just fit my vision better. The predalien is at it's base a demogorgon/pig hybrid.
---
But apparently they wanted to release it separately, which makes no sense. How dumb can one be xD and then call it certain circumstances lol
---
Yeah but I didn't expect this much pumpkin carving stuff. That's all
---
Orrrrr maybe by no fault of his own they just aren't deciding to give him hatch.  I never like automatically assuming survivors are doing wrong or being toxic when absolutely zero context from their comment exists to support this.  Some killers just sweat for every 4K.  Hell, look at all the ones that still mandatory slug 3rd to last to cheese the EGC hatch from spawning period despite the fact we can close it permanently and the mechanic in general leans towards our side.  Absolutely none of those players give away dick and there's a lot of them still lol.
---
This probably won't go anywhere even if it gets a ton
---
So glad you decided to make more of these! This is so cute!
---
Glad to know I'm not the only one lol
---
Well I was talking about your point of survivors getting more and killers getting less.
---
It’s impossible to find a reason with these kinds of people, if they really wanted to give the hatch to the last survivor it’s much easier to search for the hatch/open a gate if you just let the survivor walk around as you now have 2 people looking instead of one. Due to their reaction to wiggling it’s clear they just want to have the power of “deciding” that they let the survivor go, they couldn’t really care about actually letting the survivor go.
---
I'm all ears instead of dying light. You'll get more out of IAE. By the time Dying light really hits hard, you're nearing the end game and maybe 1-2 gens left. IAE let's you wall hack basically.
---
That's basically dbd
---
Nurse big epic gamer
---
Stay where you are at, lower ranking is a toxic playground
---
I do have the bubba dlc and I main him. Stupid shit.
---
Of course pop goes on the shrine two days after I leveled the Clown to 40 instead of waiting.
---
Are you pretending these screens are the same? Or?
---
5 blink = 4 DC amirite
---
lol honestly bro but the game would be so much more fun.
---
she smoked a joint in the car so she must be evil
---
I run spine chill, self care, empathy and fast sneak around the map. Maybe they just like chasing me because I look so fine.
---
There are people who call Noob3 toxic for making jokes about killers and other survivors. Even though he makes jokes about himself. All in post edit btw.
---
I feel like anything that's not sunshine and rainbows is just toxic to these people. Lol
---
truetalent bad
---
It's not that I hate wiggling and as a new player I want to clarify, if you have any amount of teamates still up you should be wiggling everytime.  But when it's just you left it's just this weird unspoken almost meme like thing.  If I had to attempt to provide logic for it I'd describe it as if I decide to give you a free escape I want you to know you were beaten and it's me choosing to let you go.  If you're wiggling to break out it feels like you're trying to take that for yourself.  Just a courtesy thing for me.  It shows they understand the situation.
---
Yeah, i guess less people play her since she is arguably the worst dlc
---
This is a whole new level of talent! Do you have an artwork page or something I could see more of your work on?
---
If you're halting progress by increasing skill check difficulty and revealing survivor locations, that just means you're playing doc as designed
---
Otzdarva is a 860k Sub Youtube channel with a lot of highly edited youtube videos from a small variety of games, including Dark Souls, Pubg, and Dead by Daylight.  They're a lot of fun and look to be super involved. I don't really watch this channel.
---
Not Otzdarva is, contrary to the name, Otzdarva.  It's Otz's designated second channel and it's primarily about Dead by Daylight and it's where he puts the majority of his gameplay analysis.  I originally found this channel looking for Trapper gameplay guides, and in some of his video's he will mention how he has a certain standard to the videos he uploads on his main channel.
---
You actually get 0 extra points for escaping through the hatch if you've maxed out your objective points. Just sayin.
---
bruh, why is it always the claudettes
---
Which Legion mask are you going to get?
---
Not to be a Negative Nancy, but I would just like to point out how it's a little awkward how 2/3rds of the way through your post the **Bold text** changed from **These are my own points that I support** to **These are arguments I've heard from others that I'd like to debunk** without any warning or indication.  It threw me at first.
---
As for the actual content of the post, I have no opinion.  I am a console player and have only ever played against 2 good Nurses ever, the rest either failed to get a single kill or face camped every hook because they knew they couldn't handle the survivors otherwise.  Personally, I thought Nurse should have been balanced separately on Console and PC due to the inherent difficulties of controlling her power with a joystick and extremely limited sensitivity options.  I got both of my Nurse trophies and now I'm never going to play her again because it was a miserable fucking slog.  I don't know how she should have been handled on PC, and I agree her add-ons needed fundamental changes (though not necessarily these changes), I think that the changes should have come with some QoL buffs exclusive to the console build (aim assist, a more forgiving horizontal hitbox, a base speed of 100%, or something small but noticeable like that) just to give people an actual incentive to use her on the systems rather than making her even more unusably terrible.
---
Nurse Dwight pls.
---
Quality stuff you got here.
---
So then you give away being the The Thing because you're cruising around faster than other Survivors...
---
I've heard people say the same thing, and those people look behind them for half a second, so explain how I'm always revealing him when I try to, especially when he's chasing me.
---
"OMG I died killer is too op" bruh you fed me tier 3 and then killed yourself on hook, grow up
---
OoO by itself lets the obsession see the Killer and what they’re doing and vice versa, which is pretty strong.
---
OoO with SWF is wallhacks for the entire team, as the person with OoO can tell their teammates where the killer is at all times (lets say the killer is trying to mind game a loop behind a wall, the OoO can see them trying to mind game and tell their friend who is being chased “the killer is trying to mind game you, just wait at the corner and I’ll tell you which way he goes”) this means that unless you focus and kill the SWF OoO immediately then you’ll have to deal with every survivor knowing exactly what you’re doing all the time.
---
Why does Michael Mayonnaise have an afro? Ruins my immersion entirely.
---
I like it :)
---
But Ghostface THOUGHT that she did. Because slut-shaming.
---
Yeah so in that scenario what I do is leave them slugged until the person on hook dies.  Then pick them up and you're good to go on your hatch search.  I just try to do something goofy with my character so they don't think I'm bm'ing them and they usually get that they're about to get a hatch so they don't DC.  Had a really chill GF do this to me the other night.
---
Neither, unforeseen circumstances comes out the victor
---
Not trying to have a rude response I thought this was funny I never saw it I made it on mematic I made 34 people enjoy It I am happy enough
---
Super cute, I like the wave at the end.
---
typically I am more likely to Give hatch if 1 guy had already escaped bc u know I can't miss that 2500 bp "no one escaped" bonus.
---
To be fair, the later movies are both bad and out of Wes Craven's hands. One could argue that only 1, 3, and New Nightmare are canon. They're certainly the best 3 to watch, anyway.
---
uarerite
---
I just saw that gf mask in family dollar. Almost bought it.
---
When Shirtless Myers finally comes out, the demands will increase to Pirate Myers.
---
If you turn to look left and right, are you revealed?
---
I just used it for the first time in a meme build day with my buddy and I have to say it actually felt pretty nice paired with Bond.
---
unprotected underage sex?
---
UNACCEPTABLE
---
Verrry niceu, Ceasa-chan!
---
Ranking is strange, you can do all five gens alone but de-pip due to not gaining points in the other categories. I find you have to do a bit of everything in the game in order to get the better emblems. Bloodpoints don't mean anything when it comes to rank
---
Tbh i was willing to take the ds because the match just started. I saw the person drop from the second floor and was just gonna use feng as a slug at that point in time
---
Is there something wrong with keys that I'm unaware of? For them to work for more than 1 person you have to be failing your job as a killer anyways and it gives the last person alive a chance to escape. 
---
I'm really not seeing the issue with keys here at all. Why are people constantly crying about them recently?
---
As a constant ooo user it's amazing against all killers. Let's you know where they coming from and when they'll get to you so you have time to run to a safe tile. Just hearing the terror radius doesn't give you a lot of time to go to a safe spot
---
Strongest perk in the game is DS imo
---
It did. But we can't have anything nice.
---
If it makes you feel any better, myself (and a lot of other killers) only ever hatch someone if they were carrying their team. So if you're getting the hatch from some of us, it's a sign of respect. "good chases, you've earned it" kind of a thing
---
to be fair, it costs 10 dollars and it gives you 10 dollars worth of auric cells.
---
Don't tell them; OoO users don't deserve help.
---
Totem Toucher!!
---
Honestly why is this getting downvoted
---
Doing it the now
---
He sees me watching him. It's not he won't know what's happening. I run OoO while solo and killers still ignore me while I break their traps, which is their fault. I almost never run an exhaustion perk, and only really bring flashlights to click at other survivkrs, so if they chased me, they should catch me relatively easily if I don't read them consistently.
---
Wait...theres a window? 
---
Now that i think about, Plague is probably the only person who could possibly use it.
---
I did leave the game for like six months, but they pulled me back in
---
Ummm excuse you sir, I believe we have a bit of a misunderstanding here.  I run Small Game so I regret to inform you that those are in fact my totems.
---
Ya that's why I feel it's easier to get points as survivor. But when I play killer (which I think is harder to get pip, even when I do what I consider to be good, and why I eventually decided to stop caring about pipping at the moment) the only thing I can think of to do that would make the game a higher scoring game is to specifically let people go. But as of now I like the chase and I like it more when it ends with a down. I mean yes I would rather hook each survivor 3 times. Which would probably be more fun for everyone. But I also don't go out of my way to have that happen. If you're there I'm gonna try to get you if that makes sense. Also you are probably at a higher rank than me and therefore your games are a little different?Even though I'm sure you remember what it was like at lower ranks. As killer I've only gotten to 15 and 14 is my lowest as survivor. Have had the game since the 1st of the month.
---
How to fix the key.
---
Make it unusable during the Endgame Collapse.
---
Toxicity not a selling point.
---
Fuck your totems / git good n00b / ez kill3r /rekt
---
It'd be a start. People like to argue that Killers would dodge more lobbies, but it's not like SWFs are always inconspicuous. Or like many people have the 40 minutes of patience it takes to get TWO games as Killer.
---
Is feng cosplaying as killer perks
---
i like it but my one critique is the facial expression in the knife reflection
---
it looks like laurie is aroused at the idea of being stabbed to death instead of terrified
---
I got Adept Hag off a 3k, granted plague gets kinda screwed over by her own power.
---

Staying in green and yellow ranks is where the "toxic playground" is at. Face camping killers in almost every single match, killers that let you touch the switch for .00001 seconds then continuously slug you over and over again until the timer runs out, killers that slug for the entirety of the match. Survivors who derank on purpose just to annoy the baby killers. I don't see any of this shit in red ranks.
---
At least in ranks 1-6 people are just about evenly matched in terms of perk loadout. The only difference beyond that is actual skill level.
---
I'll only use it for the extra bp
---
Absolutely agree.
---
Still! This is so fascinating and since I’ve never seen it, I found it entertaining.
---
What if Ruin took 2 totems, but its effect halved after one? I guess if it's already meta, you can't just buff it more without destroying the value of other perks.
---
The meme got old, but The Boys is actually a great series.
---
How about, you know, grind all before paying it? If you made the 1000 ac you buy It, If not, don't pay...
---
Oh it's just an iconic meme that Mcote made a while back claiming that if people were frustrated with the game they should just play Civilization.
---
oh no the nurse didnt get a 4k! this game is unbalanced!!
---
Not camping
---
Haunted ground time
---
My plan was just to get Myers, sneak up on everyone, and stare them down while never popping Tier 2.
---
Survivors like that, right?
---
I agree it's a good perk, but I really don't think it takes the theoritical "best" spot. 
---
Imo that would go to balanced landing or Dead hard. You get to use it every chase (besides shelter woods) and you get a lot of value out of them.
---
If you have decent map awareness you don't need ooo for killers that dont use stealth since you can just get to those safe spots as they approach, and for some it might get you in a bad spot. You sure as heck don't want the Nurse/Spirit to know where you are. It's pretty nutty vs huntress, at least.
---
&gt;You can get all of those perks for free on the shrine.
---
Show me right now at this very moment how I can get all those perks without paying. Please. Oh I might need to wait a year to get BBQ&amp;chili? And you're telling me that's not p2w?
---
A lot of people these days lost sight of what p2w originally meant and take the definition literally. Paying for an advantage is pay to win, including paying to speed up the grind. People don't want to admit they like p2w games. Best example of this is Warframe. You can literally buy every single item by dumping money in the game. Is the game pay to win? Yes. Is it still an awesome game? Fuck yes.
---
&gt;&gt;the strongest perk in the game, object of obsession
---
&gt;Maybe vs ghostface. Vs characters that don't rely on stealth it doesn't do much for you.
---
OoO is by far the best perk in the game against any killer and that's not an opinion that's a fact. I would suggest to "ask any experienced player". Its like having a permanent wall hack and you will never be caught off guard. It gives you incredible amount of information about the killers whereabouts at all times.
---
&gt;Spirit outclasses billy and freddy, especially vs good survivors. Ask any experienced player.
---
See, that's why I said it's a controversial opinion. I've been rank 1 both sides for years, over 4k hours in the game. You need to play differently vs spirit but she's very overrated at the moment in my opinion. You need to adapt your game vs a spirit which is what a lot of people fail to do.
---
Is spirit annoying to play against? Oh fuck yes. Is spirit a top 3 killer? Nope. Not in my opinion/experience anyway.
---
 Why do I consider Freddy better? You can't loop a freddy. Freddy has map wide pressure. Freddy has no directional heartbeat. Freddy can both bait teleports and use teleports to catch survivors off guard during a chase.
---
lol ok
---
I don't think anyone really cares about the music being there or not but OK?
---
Totem inspector. 
---
I believe I have the right to inspect and if necessary "confiscate" your totems.
---
We don't know, and why would you save points?
---
That's not me but the person in the image (u/RykerTheRuler) did that
---
Dbd: *makes a way to make money without forcing people to buy it by not allowing stronger in game stuff*
---
Dbd community: I feel like a sub class, how dare you try to have a bigger crew and make the updates helthier and less buggy?!!
---
If my team shows they can properly play against a nurse, I will probably stay. But if they keep getting downed 5 seconds into a chase then I'm out
---
Cool. 
---
I would actually like the devs to hold a contest where people cosplay, then they add in the outfits to the winners.
---
seems pretty silly to me
---
Or at all. It's not like the rank means anything when you can depip by:
---
-Being mori'd
---
-Doing too well as Killer
---
-Having people DC on you
---
-Overspecializing, since your emblems (and BP) cap rather than having any spillover.
---
I'm pretty sure your lobby was bugged. I find faster lobbies with killer than Survivor
---
Console player here! The entity is displeased. Enjoy your depip. Maybe next time let the survivors tramble all over you and drag the game out unnecessarily.
---
(Honestly though sorry that happened, DCing is such a bitch move.)
---
Oh that's super cool, dude!
---
I was thinking they might have Pustula plant offerings or something like that.
---
Oh stop it man.  Keys are the biggest survivor crutch in the game.  They're just mindless free win machines like moris are for the other side.  Zero skill demonstrated or required and insanely difficult to counterplay.  You can put on Franklin's which I do but that still only helps so much they can always pick it back up later or send someone else for it.  
---
"For more than one person you have to be failing your job as killer"...... 
---
Bro are you serious right now?  You do realize it only takes 3 gens to get 2 survivors out right?  If you think a killer fails everytime they don't end the game with 3 gens still up for repairs I can't even comprehend that line of reason.  Ending the game with any amount of gens up means you did your job pretty well.  Having to end them with 3 gens up isn't reasonable.  Not at red ranks for sure.
---
Playing on two different platforms ar once
---
holding crouch for 10/8/6 seconds allows you to go into a fetal position and reconsider your life choices
---
&gt;yet to see Discordance a single time.
---
I bought it at Demogorgon level 39, didn't appear until 45.
---
Me when I take the last survivor to the hatch 😂
---
PleZ go back to school bt lover it is an op perk and tunneling and camping iz the only way to play killer you are bad killer get good
---
I’m saving my bloodpoints up for all the spooky flashlights
---
They're not free: You need to play enough to unlock them. By your logic, all of Overwatch's Halloween cosmetics are free, since playing long enough will EVENTUALLY roll them.
---
But I'd rather have Michael than 6 Halloween cosmetics, since he affects gameplay.
---
Trust me I don't care about getting my 4k that much but it just goes to show that keys like moris have no counter. I play both survivor and killer at rank 1 and can say confidently that keys are concentrated cancer.
---
I just provided you with a video example of someone looking at the ghostface, with the screen pointed straight at his torso/chest/face and the reveal not even starting. Please, show me how you reveal him "always" outside of just claiming so. 
---
Here, [have another one.](https://clips.twitch.tv/ObliqueTenderKuduGivePLZ)
---
It's buggy and inconsistent. Sometimes you reveal him, sometimes you don't.
---
Its still greed, doesn't matter how old the game is.
---
They're not doing this off the goodness of their heart. I seriously do not like this kind of corporate apologist talk. They could easily keep the game afloat with paid dlc and paid cosmetics. This battle pass is just greed.
---
&gt; You expect them to reply with a message "Hey, we banned this guy. Thanks for your report."?
---
What are you going on about?
---
When you submit a ticket, they notify you that they received it and are dealing with it. I never received such a thing, and I triple checked to make sure all the information is correct.
---
Well, good point. The event has been pushed back to at least next week.
---
Fair play gives bloodpoints. Camping only gives you 1 point for hooking, but chasing and rehooking gives more points and hooking different people slows down the game more then tunneling.
---
But hey, enjoy your 18K games.
---
apparently its shit. last years was a stroke of genius. all they had to do was repeat it. this year it sounds like a barfed up chinese new years event, ie gens give u extra points. no satisfying flowers to progress the next vial for cosmetics. no need to save points to get halloween event items
---
 **༼ つ ◕\_◕ ༽つ**
---
Clown could toss a bottle
---
I have 1 million blood points and I’m tempted to use them but I really don’t know when the event is even going to begin
---
Well you're free to wiggle as final everytime but you're likely to be killed more often than not for doing so.  It is a thing with a lot of us lol.
---
*sobs*
---
What's it like being this entitled? Just curious
---
that has nothing to do with the game itself any licensed cosmetics have to be paid because the license has to be paid for allowing it to be used. Any that are non licensed are eligible through gameplay.
---
Dead by daylight allows people to earn items through a set amount of time OverWatch has a loot box pay-to-win system that tries to force you to spend tons of money for a chance to earn something with a much lower chance of completion. 
---
if you still feel like a second-class player based on this system I don't know what to tell you except you shouldn't be playing games in this day and age if you think the system is bad because this is miles above other systems.
---
this gave me a head ache
---
This is awesome! I think his face is a little too... detailed? I was never into comic books, so maybe I’m not the target audience, but I feel like on the cover, the mysterious, ghostly slasher should be a little more, well, mysterious. I feel like we can see a lot of details as to what he looks like. Maybe if it was more of his silhouette through the thick fog, it would look a bit cooler imo.
---
Regardless though, this is super cool!
---
This is amazing! Nice work.
---
but you can also obtain platinum ( the paid currency ) by trading with other players, you don't have to spend a dime
---
on the other hand, to get dbd and all of it dlcs it would cost 134 euros ( ~90 eur without cosmetic dlcs ) on steam, this is without any deals
---
OoO is Object of the Obsession. SWF is Survive With Friends.
---
OoO is a survivor perk that lets them see the killer through walls when outside their terror radius. It can be pretty devastating to stealth killers or killers that need to set up traps. The drawback is whenever the survivor can see the killer, the killer can see them back.
---
SWF is the game mode where friends can play together as survivors. Groups of friends are often much tougher opponents as there is better communication and coordination between teammates.
---
When a survivor uses OoO on his own, he has basically put a huge target on himself. A good player will try to make it so his perks revolve around getting the killers attention and then wasting his time as much as he can. As a killer, If you see one trying to get your attention, ignore him. He wants to waste your time to give his teammates more time to finish the generators so ignore him. 
---
If a survivor uses OoO with some friends, that survivor can now call out the killers movements as long as he stays outside his terror radius to his team. This is an immensely strong advantage and it's VERY difficult to play against unless you have a specific set of perks and a mean play style. For this type, the survivor with OoO will actually try to avoid you and stay out of your terror radius in order to give his teammates the most amount information. As a killer, you need him dead ASAP. Usually it's considered impolite to focus on one survivor but this is an instance where it's the sole method of winning.
---
Otzdarva made a pretty good video on his second channel (not otz) where he goes more into detail but it's worth mentioning that Otz is pretty good at the game and even with an optimized load out and strategy created specifically to counter this play-style, he still struggled to win.
---
tl;dr OoO is a pain in the ass to fight against, especially if the survivors are in a team
---
Sorry for the long ass comment but I hope this answers your questions
---
K....but played like a fiddle suggests a play was made period and there simply wasn't.  For a play to be made some form of counterplay needs to exist.  In this scenario there was literally nothing the killer could do that's a free escape.  It's like a killer using a mori to "play someone like a fiddle".
---
Yeaa its great having 1 week to play the event
---
It was allready short
---
But 2 weeks is even better
---
wheres the withered blight dlc with "unforseen circumstance"
---
Key is a guaranteed escape if you find the hatch, Nurse isn’t a guaranteed 4K if you find a survivor
---
Thanks for the nice words everyone! And yes I will consider turning them into character potraits. (Also I might try redo plague and make the Clown thicker without looking weird)
---
That's the thing though, it's not always a solo queue that uses keys, if anything most of the time it's a swf that want the easy alternate if they 3 gen themselves or something in that direction, it's pure aids. But leave that aside, I have no problems with it except for one: it's not fucking counterable.
---
No matter what you decided  you would properly regret it :) so better to just focus on what you did, and enjoy that!
---
Your bias is blinding you. Killer tried to be a clever cunt closing the hatch in the survivors face. Survivor used a key to escape as a fuck you to a killer who was being toxic. I love how the hardcore killer mains of this community say keys are op but are silent about ebony mori, which is comfortably the most op and ridiculous thing in the game.
---
Can't wait
---
I’m sorry. 😫
---
I havent seen it yet but im already upvoting because i love dbd art 
---
Edit: I love it! You are very talented.
---
I think a Xeno would just make more sense. Predalien as a cosmetic would be badass tho
---
You have paid and they have given you what they promised, the events are special events nothing your paying for and you have zero knowledge as to the reason of the delay just your angry screeching because you *assume* to know it's laziness and they didn't have time management VS hey we found some issues that popped up polishing things or something else.
---
But go on please
---
I did an anger to somebody
---
Kill the one with the key. Why is this so hard for people to understand? If you have Franklin's and use it, make it your mission to find them first in the match and it makes it that much harder to find after they've been hooked. I honestly have never had anyone ever get a hatch escape with a key when there are 2 or more survivors left unless they've messaged me trying to get the where did they go trophy or unless I'm memeing around with the killer because I'm bored as fuck with this game playing killer. If I'm actually playing for real though not a single gen gets done so the hatch will never spawn for anyone except the last person anyways.
---
Keys are not a problem in any scenario that you create unless you're really just bad at playing killer and tracking.
---
Why though?
---
Yea same
---
Its still good because they would have got a great if ruin wasn't there and progress faster
---
Last years event included a secondary objective where you had to harvest from flowers (as survivors) but it is removed in this event due to everyone complaining last year (rightfully) about how their teammates wouldnt play the game and would just farm for the flowers to get cosmetics. There is now an offering that spawns pustula generators &amp; hooks which are just differently decorated hooks and gens. You get extra bloodpoints when using them. The flowers were replaced by getting serum (which is used to unlock the halloween cosmetics) from the rift.
---
I wouldn’t you’ll always get those shards back and what’s the point of saving up shards if your not going to use them
---
I find it hard to believe this person is not being sarcastic.
---
What’s it like being this much of an arse-kisser for the devs? Just curious
---
Adorable
---
Oh k
---
&gt; In this scenario there was literally nothing the killer
---
&gt; could do
---
Jesus Christ, did we watch the same clip? He had so many chances to down him and that’s a gg. But he instead chose to close the hatch in the survivors face. Play stupid games, get made to look like a fool.
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
ik me me joking
---
👍🏿
---
 https://www.mediafire.com/file/q4kcb4iv72rhrjy/Kate\_Arrest.rar/file
---
Its not from the new update, the new update is that the killer rank is equal with the highest survivor rank but at rank 17 they are not many players so thats why the game match you with higher ranks instead of 30 minutes wainting
---
Also, the make your choice joke went over your head lol
---
just run small game lol
---
Hope you'll consider doing Ash sometime! Ur really talented!
---
Small game epic gamer perk
---
That's not the case actually, I knew the meg had a key. I always close the hatch without hesitation and start patrolling gates, but you can see me look around in the clip because I'm looking for the Meg and hoping I could see her in the distance to down her. I didn't close the hatch because I knew she had a key and if I closed it then I would've given her 3 escape routes, an unwinnable situation for me.
---
Not a good kinda stress though. An excruciatingly painful kind.
---
That is incredible.
---
I need an HD scanned version to make my phone wallpaper.
---
Superb sketch
---
I was waiting for someone to make a G-man/Half Life reference
---
Many characters have dark outfits. Nea has a dark-dark green shirt, black hat and dark pants. What colour/shade is acceptable? Is there a palette chart like when you want paint mixed at the store?
---
Lol!  Oh my God my bias?.......I have zero bias and I'm not a main of anything.  I'm a 50/50 player that plays both sides evenly.  
---
How was closing the hatch being toxic?  They both made it to it and he was toxic for not automatically giving it away to the survivor?  You want to talk about that bias word again friend?
---
Oh my God lol!  Dude your mori argument you brought up...if you want to feel really stupid right now scroll down and read my next comment.  I literally used moris as an example for the other side of a cheesy mechanic that also requires no skill for the other side in direct comparison to survivor keys...Please read the threads in the future lest you make a fool out of yourself
---
Keys and moris are two sides of the same opposing crutch coin.  Talk about biased?  Damn bro.
---
Imagine being this petty over a key lmfao. I've got shit tons of green keys and the useless addons to go with them to bait out your pettiness. My friends and I do this pretty regularly just to waste 2 slots for killers. 1 being a perk that would have otherwise been useful to you and the other an offering. Your pettiness can be played upon to make you weaker in the game.
---
It's better to just not give a shit than it is to let your pettiness dominate over you. If you're actually good at killer then keys won't come into play during the match anyways.
---
good comic, take my upvote!
---
to buy dbd and every dlc you'd have to pay 134 euros ( prices without sales/deals, ~90 eur without cosmetic dlcs ) and not only that but they can keep releasing additional dlcs which they also sell 
---
in dbd there's no way to obtain auric cells without paying money
---
now warframe, is a completely free game, and you can earn everything in game without spending a dime, you can even trade with other players for the premium currency
---
i spent $5 on warframe and i have everything i wanted, spent over 70 eur on dbd and i still have to grind ( i figure i'll have to grind for 1k more hours to get every killer/survivor to 40 ) to get useful perks
---
Your the reason this subreddit is full of shit memes
---
Good job
---
That's definitely DC worthy imo
---
I think the archives are going to be way too much for them. But it's too late now...
---
What's it like being a complete and utter moron and not understanding that these things happen with games and software and any release all the time and it's not due to devs being lazy or time mismanagement? Just curious
---
Yeah, shitty situation and people are angry, but it sounds like something catastrophic has happened. I doubt they would hurt their own business like this for no reason.
---
5-11 on both sides. Fun games with competent enough players without the try hard ‘must win OR ELSE’ attitude that you get when you venture into red ranks.
---
Another bhvr fanboi lol
---
0 knowledge
---
Its just the devs making the event shorter soo people buy more skins
---
Fuck the community am i right?
---
You like bhvr you got this attitude also right?
---
A Mori that exposes players would aid in tracking and downing a player before they reach the hatch.
---
Good keys are just as rare as a good Mori.
---
Side note: how can you tell players are swf? 
---
I always solo cue so I dobt know the difference
---
Pettiness? So taking a key to just head out whenever you'd like isn't petty? What you just said is a complete hypocrite statement.
---
How do you know that they won't make the event last longer due to those issues? You are only being petty, play the game and wait, your Complains won't make the event come fast and won't help in any form
---
I would consider the mori a fiddle play too. Like for instance if the survivor got unhooked and ran to the gate but let the killer down him so he could d strike off to troll them, but instead the killer moris them
---
But yes that's what made it funny to me is the fact that the survivor knew he had the game in the bag and toyed with the killer for a moment, at least that's how it appeared. The Meg could've also not known that the killer can't pull survivors out of the hatch anymore and hesitated for that reason
---
90% sure this guy is trolling.
---
Good shitpost
---
Translation:
---
-This killer knows how to (gibberish) and tunnel, huh?
---
-I tunneled?
---
-Yeah
---
-Wat
---
-Am I supposed to let you guys rescue eachother freely?
---
-Trash Camper
---
The game was in that map with the school, and I hooked a survivor to the basement, and they tried to rescuse before i even got far away so I really had no reason *not to* go and punish them. I still find it funny they started the trial with that thing that makes them be together, and one of them was decked out but their need to rescuse eachother just made them easy prey.
---
I mean it has 22 upvotes and my other post has like 200 likes I'm sorry that I don't meet your meme standards master ogway triggered boi
---
You honestly had me excited when I saw the flair, then scared, and then relieved.
---
I love how it's flaired as a Guide. :D
---
keys do require more work then a mori but i feels way worse to get keyed 
---
esp if you got your 1st kill and you are making a comeback then the game just ends
---
I once was escapi g as the last person alive with endgame ticking down. I had just started opening the gate and I was pretty sure I didn't have enough time. Then the killer came and opened it for me so I could escape.
---
Yeah I was planning on actually buying him very soon for Pop cause I very recently finished the grind for Ruin, so the Pop at the shop couldn't have come at a better time.  
---
Thinking about getting Plague for Corrupt Intervention next
---
run the hunch like all chads do
---
Shitpost flair exists
---
I started playing without interaction with others or research beforehand and found that stealth is the most effective method. It also makes chases more exciting
---
Then they get a big head, run around flashlight stun / teabagging the rest of match.  Just kill the asshole.
---
Enduring doesn’t mess with DS anymore, it’s only pallets
---
Add me as a survivor, and wait 4 years, then we’ll talk
---
22th month of next year? that's like in 24 months!
---
I was thinking Dead Hard. My bad. I said thrill instead of DH because it’s better with totem builds. The notification saves lives.
---
Not even comparable to warframe dude, literally everything is free and earnable in warframe, that stops before you get to the title screen of dbd.
---
The monetization is whatever to me, but don't act like you can earn "free" characters in a paid game
---
What? Honestly, did we watch the same video at at all? He only had one perk, BBQC.
---
1. He hits her, waits on cooldown, and she still makes it.
---
2. He does nothing, she still jumps in.
---
3. He closes hatch, doesn't mater, she has a key.
---
Literally nothing he can do, do you not understand the game mechanics or am I missing something.
---
The event will be the same length dude. If it starts a week late then the end date will also be pushed back a week.
---
So you're saying that you can't buy all prime stuff, and all needed mods, and all the currency you need to upgrade?
---
These are really cool. How could I get started in creating pixel art? Like what program do you use to create them? I'm interested in making a game in unity, and I thought I might try my hand at this.
---
The counterplay is killing them. You know, doing your job. If you see something that you think will ruin the match for you, a key in this example, bring Franklin's. 
---
Me on the other hand? Idfc who's in the match or what they bring or even if they're all swf. It doesn't matter. I just sit and stare at my phone reading news and other interesting articles or scroll through that nature is lit sub until I'm actually in the match. Keys are literally not a problem. Dude let you close the hatch and wasted his key anyways. He beat you to the hatch and stood there just to reopen it in your face. Yet here we are, crying about how a key is supposedly "op" when the fact still remains he beat you to the hatch to begin with. He let you close it for points then dipped out. For the same reason people let you hit them before they leave. It's to give you a little more BP before the match ends. Everyone is tryin to have a good time and you over here crying over a key he didn't need to use to begin with.
---
Am I confused, or was insidious not used? And it doesn't seem that toxic - someone ran into your face, some folks gave up...
---
I’ve played a lot where they let me escape or at least help boost me before they kill me if I don’t wiggle
---
It’s a game played by people, we can still be nice to each other
---
There's a meme about Dwight players either being really worthless and staying in a locker every game or actually being really good and toxic. To me it's just a meme. I don't mind Dwights.
---
Boop snoot
---
Happy birthday to me then!
---
That's definitely not true. I have paired with killers more than 6 different on solo.
---
The game was in that map with the school, and I hooked a survivor to the basement, and they tried to rescuse before i even got far away so I really had no reason not to go and punish them. I still find it funny they started the trial with that thing that makes them be together, and one of them was decked out but their need to rescuse eachother just made them easy prey.
---
Need? Doubt
---
Want? Yes, definitely.
---
What’s HL ?
---
His perk Prove Thyself increases repair speed by 10% so its used for genrush a lot.
---
His perk Bond can let you see your teammates so sometimes people lead the killer to a different survivor during a chase.
---
The baby Dwight meme is because he’s a default survivor and also the first on the list, so a lot of new players choose him.
---
Happened in the US a couple months ago, bought like 5 chapters for the price of 2 1/2. Definitely a steal.
---
Here's your stupid upvote.
---
How long ago exactly? because the 6 rank hard cap update wasn't too long ago
---
I really love this! Was there any reason why you chose Meg's hair to be blonde instead of red?
---
I mean for sure, Xeno is more iconic. But for the powers I envisioned  Hybrid is better.
---
Now that instas are getting killed keys are the next thing to complain about.
---
&gt; bamboozled
---
Pun intended?
---
Yeah, you're not in reality man. They do need to keep a 3 year old game profitable if it's still popular, or else we wouldn't be getting new DLC anymore.
---
But dropping someone off at the hatch isn't necessarily nice. I would not appreciate it as a survivor because you're taking away from the game for me. I don't need a handicap. I don't want pity points, I want to play the game.
---
And getting a 4K isn't mean in the first place, so there's no need to be "nice" to someone.
---
Oh my god, use Franklins then. Key are not over powered, you just got outplayed. Period.
---
Again. You’re not going to always get a 4K.
---
At this point I don't even know if you're being serious or sarcastic lol
---
Huntress Lullaby. Makes Ruin skill checks near impossible.
---
What can I say... I love it
---
I am 10000000% serious. 
---
Get good.
---
Your totems are bush fire hazzards I'm just saving the forest.
---
&gt;What's it like being an arse-kisser for the devs?
---
You see this right? Where you couldn't come up with an argument and your first comment was throwing insults? Like come on lol also 1st amendment means government can't tell you to shut up, not that I can't tell you to shut up and that you're a moron who doesn't understand what free speech actually means and is a hissy fit crybaby about a free event devs make for the community and apparently a child because they need to delay it
---
Don’t worry, the mask was huge, nothing hurt her. I love my big bundles of fluff, I’d never do anything to hurt them
---
To be fair you insulted them first
---
That looks pretty satisfying.
---
Hahahaha, I'm just going to cut the conversation short here, because I can't take you serious.
---
Aww they must have just changed that I remember watching an ohtofu video recently of him talking about how well it counters ds
---
Lmao! My first game of dbd I was a bubba. I thought that the hook timer went down when I hit the survivor. Boy that was a bad few hours for survivors until someone told me it was an actual timer and not a health bar.
---
The only thing I like about keys is the aura. But that's not really enough for me to use it over another item.
---
This just makes me want a vaporwave Ghostface.
---
Ok, fine, take your upvote.
---
There's alot more killers than I thought
---
I was hoping someone would say this when I posted it.
---
Are you trying to justify face camping?
---
For real! I always tell survivors this lol. 
---
If a killer does really good in a match, he/she can give a person hatch while still pipping. The question is, who will it be that gets hatch hehe? You can't expect a killer to give you hatch if you wiggle. Survivors have to understand that the killer is giving you hatch. You didn't outplay the killer or do really well to get it, you're on the killer's shoulder and he/she is GIVING you the hatch. Loooool
---
P.S. Memeing is the ultimate counter to every killer ❤
---
Enjoy getting outplayed and further crying about how everything that beats you is unfair.
---
I donnt really care for the aura reading add-ons, those things are just fine.
---
Let's make you a celebrity
---
Get lost, kid. Go back to your Fortnite sub.
---
I’m down
---
No. Now I wish there WASN'T a hallowed blight event.
---
Thanks guys, I appreciate it
---
Video game development takes a lot of time. They’re still adding and improving so many things about the game. Try cutting the developers a little slack👌
---
Personally i level for perks first and then level just because. Only reason my Nea is level 15 is because i had a daily and thought “might as well get adept as well”.
---
No, I’m asking is it bad when I stay there if I know every survivor is nearby hiding waiting for me to leave instead of doing literally anything else despite me having JUST hooked the victim?
---
Don't worry. Pain relievers is garbage. He's dogshit at the game  dpn'r use him 4 advice.
---
I can't find any game as a killer, sadly playing survivor only atm
---
Yeah I dont know why its highlighted because it would have gone straight to struggle so Im confused
---
Why are you hiding the ranks tho?
---
My whole team lost a stone/emblem which caused me to rank down
---
Dafuq...
---
Once you have played survivor a lot, you learn their common spawnpoints on any map, the offering is pretty useless against any killer with a lot of experience as survivor.
---
Okay.
---
Hey if you say so. I'm not here for a big dick contest. Just stating facts. Sorry that you're bad at the game and don't know how to run loops as a killer. I feel even worse for you if you only ever play 1 side. That actually makes you less effective in chases if you do. But hey, you do you. Keep crying about a key in the game because all the best players in the game cry about the most mundane and useless things in the game. Right?
---
Just a tip for the future my dude. Put somewhere on the image your signature, cause some folks are garbo enough to steal it and claim it’s theirs. Cheers, and awesome work by the way!
---
Yaa give him a male kill bill outfit xD
---
Ok good needed to see your opinion on it, glad to see you understand mate. Take updoot.
---
You should still be able to earn the currency to get the pass without paying if youre dedicated enough.  Thats fair
---
&gt; one for getting around quickly without causing scratch Mark's 
---
Why not just walk then?
---
But I need inner strength!
---
&gt; Why did you make another post? 
---
IKR. Couldn't even wait 30Mins either. Kinda sad TBH.
---
Last time the killer wanted to give me the hatch. They spent a couple minutes looking for it, then gave up and killed me.
---
Couldn’t have hoped for anything less lmao
---
Yeah...
---
Welp, guess there goes my sleep schedule
---
Ok as a fan of tru I hate to say there’s truth to this and it’s his worst trait imo. He doesn’t curse the person directly but he will repeatedly say “oh this build is shit” “well what can I do you gave me shit build” throughout the match. Like someone paid you $10 so you can run this build and you’re over here complaining about it, it’s just so rude and I can’t understand why you would do that when someone is paying you to play it.
---
I prefer surveillance over discordance for him, gives me more pertinent info. I also just yesterday replaced ruin with PGTW which is in the shrine right now. I think I'm going to start doing that from now on as it worked great. And don't have to worry about a totem getting cleansed and wasting a slot.
---
In that case it's kinda debateable if the perk is too strong or not, but 4 people being able to run it, or worse, a sfw who has 1 person run it is unarguably too much information to keep the following gameplay balanced.
---
You can’t derank for killers quitting, ask anybody and some may not know but majority knows.
---
If you don't like it as an addition to the game don't buy it. It won't make a difference unless you buy it
---
Thank you for understanding, I honestly thought you were trying to justify face camping for some reason.
---
It was a limited edition that came with the Trapper mask. I believe the first 500 orders got a poster
---
Thanks for explaining. I appreciate you :)
---
Ok so on my end I can't see who you're replying to so all your comments are replies to yourself from what I can see and it's the funniest shit I've ever seen on this sub so far.
---
I'd probably get the basic Frank mask, it's the most iconic one
---
Lol i grabbed 1 dude off a gen and 3 ppl DCd i was dying 😂 survivors are babies a lot of the time
---
You are a compulsive liar or a troll either way I'm not entertaining this it's absurd.  I got 3k hours in play both sides evenly through red.  We both know you don't end every game with 5 gens up.  This is akin to Kim Jong Un's rounds of golf where he only shot holes in one.  I've been playing long enough to know how thoroughly full of shit this claim is.  You would literally be the best killer player in the entire game across all platforms.  Did not happen sell your Bridge in London to someone else my friend.
---
Or a waifu shirt with a knock off naruto headband and goku pants.
---
Didn't even boop the snoot smh
---
Just dont forget the game offering
---
Yesterday I had to deal with this while player a 110% killer and they still lost.
---
odd, might be bugged or something
---
Michael is also my favorite! Beautiful drawing :]
---
Turns out people are preeeeety dumb
---
Ooo good idea it kinda reminds me of Mortal Kombat too
---
Thanks for the tips, I'll keep them in mind. I saw some mannequin-heads in a nearby dollarstore, might be good enough. Also didn't know I could use cornstarch for the moisture
---
Gonna be honest while I don’t try to justify it, I don’t mind when people do it to me. I just hook suicide and move on if it’s clear they got all the tools to keep me there.
---
The freddy one is kinda fucked up, not gonna lie
---
TrU3 slugs aswell, typically with the final 2 players to get the 4K.
---
&gt;And your response after two years is to only give stealth killers aura reading immunity against it - not to change OoO for the better of all killers. 
---
Not only does Undetectable for stealth Killers *not* solve the problem of OoO for the majority of Killers (including non-stealth Killers like Trapper who can be just destroyed by it), it also has the (unintended?) side-effect of nerfing other, more fair aura-reading perks that were *already only mediocre perks* (e.g., Dark Sense, Alert), and destroys one perk that was the only counter to the worst campers in the game (Kindred vs cloaked Wraith, Insidious Leatherface, etc., who Borrowed Time won't work against because they have no Terror Radius).
---
Immunity from aura-reading should be removed from the Undetectable effect entirely, and Object of Obsession should just be reworked—probably from the ground up. I have a couple different ideas how that could be done: Either invert the range, or dramatically cut down the information it provides. (But not both. That would be overkill.)
---
**1.** **Invert the range.**
---
Right now, it only works from just outside the edge of the Killer's Terror Radius, out to an extremely far distance. Because Survivors control when the aura-reading is active and can watch the Killer from very far away, they are at virtually no risk except against super-high-mobility Killers—if the Killer moves in their direction, they just stop looking for a bit and go somewhere else, long before the Killer can get over to them. So it's currently a very low risk, very high reward perk, which is a big part of what makes it such bullshit.
---
Solving this is pretty easy: Make it only work from *within* the Terror Radius, or possibly from a set range similar to a typical Terror Radius (e.g., 24/32/40m). This is still really useful—other Perks warn of an approaching Killer, but no other Perk shows you *exactly* where the Killer is approaching from, and it basically destroys mind gaming at loops. You can even still use it to spy on the Killer and report back to your team—but now you have to do it a lot more carefully, because you're too close to *easily* get away when the Killer sees you. It becomes a high risk, high reward Perk.
---
**2. Dramatically decrease the information it provides.**
---
Being able to see the Killer's aura at all times provides an obscene amount of info. You immediately know who the Killer is, you can see exactly what they're doing, where they're laying traps, call out every mind game they attempt while chasing teammates, etc., etc. I don't think the devs thought through just how much information it gives when they created it.
---
Solving this is pretty easy too: Instead of showing the Killer and Survivor each others' auras, it could show them location indicators (like Rancor or Infectious Fright), or perhaps a Killer Instinct blip for the Killer and an equivalent for the Survivor. On top of that, give it a reasonable cool down after each use—say, even just 15 seconds.
---
Now, because you only get a generic indicator, you can't tell who the Killer is or what they're doing—are they walking past the Killer Shack, camping it, or did they just put a trap down?—and you can't call out real-time plays during a chase. The one thing it would still do is give you running, if not quite real-time, knowledge of the Killer's approximate location. Even updated only every 15 seconds or so, if you ask me, this would still be pretty powerful.
---
You should posylt the other one cos this one is really good:) 👍
---
&gt; Your money doesn't give you access to some special content that's unobtainable for non-paying players that gives you an advantage, like those repair kits in fallout 76. That's what pay to win is.
---
The original definition of pay to win means that you get any kind of advantage over anyone by paying. That's what dbd is. Doesn't matter how little of an advantage it is. In your definition, Korean MMOs where you can pay for top gear isn't pay to win because everyone can grind it once the next tier releases.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;&gt; OoO is by far the best perk in the game against any killer and that's not an opinion that's a fact. 
---
&gt;Object being the best is your opinion, there is nothing definitive that makes it a fact. You can't exactly measure values that it has and define that it's objectively better than every other perk. I'd agree that it's a good perk, tho personally I wouldn't take it over dead hard or balanced landing. I have enough map awareness to know the general whereabouts of the killer except for some stealth characters, which is gonna get changed next patch and ooo won't help with that anymore.
---
It gives you a lot more information than location. Is spirit phasing? Is trapper setting up? Is hag setting up? Is billy zooming in your direction? Is huntress about to cross map your ass? OoO is incredibly strong solo perk and then if you consider that it allows an entire team to also know all that information, you should be able to see how it becomes bonkers.
---
Is dead hard good by itself? Sure. Is it 1000 times better if you're also running OoO? Yes. Having a couple extra seconds to prepare means you can loop longer before you use your dead hard for extra loops and extend your chases even more.
---
&gt;&gt;You need to play differently vs spirit but she's very overrated at the moment in my opinion. You need to adapt your game vs a spirit which is what a lot of people fail to do.
---
&gt;Yes, I'm sure a character that can't get looped and gets near-guranteed hits on people is worse than characters that get looped for days by competent players.
---
That's only once you're injured. I do agree that she's very strong once you're hurt unless you're running iron will, but saying you can't loop her is just straight up wrong. Start playing like your exposed vs a spirit and you be much better.
---
&gt;&gt; You can't loop a freddy.
---
&gt;Yes you can? Let me show you loop a freddy around the map, I can do it all day. He's just a stronger clown when it comes to chases, he's still a m1 killer. All he does is make you drop the pallet slightly sooner. Spirit ignores the pallet, and gets on top of you.
---
You can loop any killer around the map if you drop every pallet early. That doesn't mean it's a good thing. late game you'll be fucked. Most safe pallets become unsafe vs Freddy. That's where his strength is. Force rotations. You can't loop a freddy efficiently is what I should have said I guess
---
&gt;&gt;Its like having a permanent wall hack 
---
&gt;You know, I can see how you'd think OoO is the best perk in the game, I'll admit that it shits on freddy's day, which I guess is a good reason why you'd value it so high. Against anyone else you won't be able to use it in a chase.
---
Just because I think Freddy is incredibly strong doesn't mean I only play Freddy. The point of OoO isn't to use it in a chase. If you can use OoO in a chase the killer also sees you, which isn't ideal. He can't mind game you but it also removes any possibility of you being able to take risk with irregular pathing.
---
&gt;&gt;Freddy can both bait teleports and use teleports to catch survivors off guard during a chase.
---
&gt;Any mildly sentient survivor won't fall for this. Freddy in chase is a better clown, that's all he is. He has slows that force the survivor to drop a pallet sooner. He doesn't down them faster, he gets looped. The only thing that's really strong about freddy is his bs forever freddy build which honestly should get looked at.
---
There's no falling for it. If you're running towards a gen I basically trap you between myself and the gen, and force you to change direction because you lose either way.
---
Be careful, this sub universally condemns TrU3 and worship Otz.

---
I know. I watched like 3 vids and already realised that he is cherrypicking clips for rank 20 survivors.
---
Ok that’s now what I’m saying, On xbox the game is quit buggy we play games and the killer quits and sometimes u will lost a progress emblem still even though it’s not supposed to happen. It’s happened twice. Idk if this clarifies what am saying.
---
She should've booped da snoot, that spanking off screen was because she didn't
---
Show us on the doll where he hurt you.
---
You can use baby powder as well but just make sure it doesn't have any talc in the baby powder since it can cause respiratory damage. Cornstarch is safer and cheaper. I paid 2 bucks for a pound of it for my mask and in all honesty you don't even need a full pound of it since you only need to lightly dust the inside of it after you're done using it. Just dip your fingertips into the cornstarch and rub it around the inside of the mask and pat it around. You can flip the mask inside out to make applying it easier. 
---
After you wear it make sure you wipe out the sweat and moisture with a paper towel or a rag before you dust it with the cornstarch since the oils in your sweat and skin will destroy the mask over time and allow bacteria to grow inside the mask.
---
if your not loosing point idk why you would just get mad about nothing. But i guess that’s just the internet for you
---
Maybe but right now they need to fix it more than anything so we can have more goodies
---
Generally what I do is I might look for hatch for about 30 seconds or I’ll give hatch if I find it on my way to the hook
---
Yup gonna get it all :)
---
Hmm usually when they fix something, something else breaks or goes haywire.
---
'Your part of the problem'
---
And if  i am young hypothetically, wouldn't that be embarrassing that you got schooled and roasted by someone who happens to be younger?
---
Alright then. Whatever you say. Like I said, I'm just stating facts. I really don't give a shit if you don't believe it and I don't gotta prove a damn thing to anyone. 🤷‍♂️
---
I think you're splitting hairs. There are people behind the players. You're not just venting at the screen if you are cursing at the others.... Some of my steam friends will often curse at the killer the entire game. And then in chat. Cursing at them in game is devaluing them as a person and setting yourself up for the urge to do it when the game is over as you've already decided what you think of them. Sure it's worse to say it to the killers/surv face but calling your opponents obscene remarks the entire match for whatever reason isnt much better. Mean thoughts are still mean thoughts. All bad habits start in the mind and grow from there. I dont expect to get upvoted. Cursing has become so acceptable and desensitized our own president does it on a daily basis to whoever he doesnt like.
---
I think this is undeserved. They do a good job balancing the game, they keep updating it and adresssing the issues that the community talks about like the nurse, instaheals and dedicated servers. It is no easy task to balance a game that in its nature is  just unbalanced (4 survivors vs 1 immortal killer). 
---
They are doing a decent job
---
0/5 face is clearly of a humanoid and not of an  equus ferus caballus like the Laurie in game.
---
The event isn’t the problem, it’s the whole patch, the event is easy to put out but the problem is that you earn the currency through the archives which is part of the mid chapter patch. If there are bugs with the mid chapter patch they can’t release the event.
---
Thanks nevertheless
---
It's all practice. There's no such thing as talent. "Talent" is the determination to become good at something you enjoy.
---
I’d say Laurie or David honestly
---
Fredy:has toddlers in the mix

IMO, I think it’s better to use shards on DLC characters as it saves you money. Depends how much you play though. I’ve bought all unlicensed dlc with iridescent shards. Then max out all my characters. Personal preference

Clown is totally a roofie dare raper. That’s his POWER. Also LF/Hag/Demo/Billy all have an oral fixation. And use teeth. 
---
Vre I want one of these with what kind of lover they are. 
---
Like Huntress will break you, and Spirit is crazy wild  sex plus flexibility cuz of floaty limbs. (And glass shards ow), and Myers is awkward confused teen.
---
True I hope they can get it to how it was before because it used to be perfect
---
Yeah but if you can mark someone you don’t have to deal with hitting them twice assuming you get to them in time, which is what the perfume is for. And if I get my power back, I can use it to mind game pallets and get a free hit, which is what the pen is for.
---
If they managed to fix hitboxs and lag and they would take a big part of the problem out.
---
No, I just wanted to voice my opinion about their shitty and scummy practices.
---
This is wise because I wasn't born yesterday.  There are brand new players on this sub though too so maybe use your 5 gen line on them I guess?  Could work.
---
Honestly it’s fine with me that the killer kills me. I appreciate the gesture but I’d rather everyone just played the game as intended
---
So yeah. Legit clicked that thinking it was gonna be fake.
---
Nope. Definitely not.
---
I just wish I could somehow play on US servers. Instead, I'm stuck with EU servers whose players are 85% Russians that have the exact opposite "rules" than the rest of the world, it seems.
---
If a Russian does pull-ups on the hook, it means it's safe to unhook them. Everyone else does it to signal killer camping...
---
It's always - wait for it! - *Russian roulette* to unhook someone on EU servers. :D
---
I love Dwighty
---
This makes me wish each survivor could put a killer mask on the side of their head to show their appreciation for their favorite killer. Maybe we’ll get charms of each killer one day though
---
Anything that prevents progress like that should not be considered toxic. You would classify that as pressure.
---
It has a 0.00000000000000000000000001% chance to work.  10x more effective than any other method.

This exact thing happened to me and I recieved the exact same email. Their database must contain incorrect information, they threatened me with an unwarranted ban, too.

Holy fuck the quality of this, it's amazing!
---
The battle pass is paid cosmetics though, that's all it is. Its paid cosmetics for a better deal but you have to grind for them. Why do you draw the line there?
---
Once again, I stated that we don't know what bhvrs profits look like. They could need the extra money, but either way, you're ignoring that a game has to be profitable. Typically games aren't as profitable 3 years down the line, so I can totally understand a new method of making money.
---
Once again, it's a business. They can't do anything just to be nice, they have to have incentives. I'll leave it at that, because you're clearly not in the correct mindset for this. Just remember this isn't a charity and we're not in need.
---
Suffer the consequences, you must

I find it funny that you call me mad when it seems like you're the one who's mad at people expressing appreciation for this guy. Also that's your subjective opinion.

They sorted it for me mate. I joined the discord and PMd a developer with my ticket number. They did sort me out eventually. It's a little worrying at first lol but I'm sure it's just bs anyway.

alright, goodnight

“Prime time” it is

I shoot, you run!

They only acrivate when a generator is completed, so, if you get one put on after all 5 are done, you're fine. You can leave with it on.

Pain Relievers is actually good lmao. Quit hating
---
Actually it's really fun on hospital map... especially if you get the basement in the laboratory room with all of the  crazy T.V.'s. What I would do was I'd hook someone down there in the basement, and then go upstairs watching through those windows with my eye on the basement. Survivors would come sneakily looking around, but never look up to see the leather face (me). Then I would wait a bit and go make my move downing both of them. 
---
The feeling and pleasure of hiding so well and using insidious to absolute perfection.. was so overwhelming it was almost better than sex.   
---
Of course they were salty at my amazing hiding skills. I think it takes skill to find a nice spot to hide and not be able to move at all, and only having one point of perspective (first person) while they can check around corners. IN MY OPINION, it is balanced... they just didn't look good enough.
---
This is about as 13 year old Redditor you can get.

This is absolutely adorable.

Loved it. I bought DBD like the day after the event started (coincidence, didn’t even know about the event) and fucking loved this theme. When the event ended, and the theme reverted to the original, I was so disappointed. The Halloween one is by far my favorite, followed by the Christmas one (though that only fits during the winter season, and also it at least came back last year I believe). 
---
I really wish they lit you pick and choose which version of the theme you want on the main menu.

Holy FUCK your drawings are amazing.
---
i miss it too, was my favorite track and it sadly may never come back :(
---
i love this!
---
I really don’t understand why people use this argument. we all bought this game planning to have fun. so if we get into a game and aren’t having fun, who gives a fuck? I mean it’s a game. will your parents disown you because you de-pip? if I load into a game and see iri heads, omega blink, or plague(this is more of a personal wait I cannot stand her) that’s an instant dc because it isn’t fun to play anymore.

For me, once I hit purple ranks it takes around 20 minutes to find a match (survivor). I stay in low ranks for Killer to get BPs but I imagine it's the same higher rank. Most of the time I see the same people in lobbies too.
---
Yeah just checked, might be a user that blocked you or a user you blocked.
---
No, I don't think I will.
---
I might have been the Pig here,,, I had something identical happen recently
---
Eh.. Personally I think you're better off picking them up and eating it. Unless you're close to some bad loops it shouldn't take too long to down them again. However, I always go for the person trying to farm their teammate and either straight up ignore the one being farmed or maybe just down them and let the survivors take the time to pick them up.
---
I take it as an offense to farm your teammates that deserves punishment lol.

He never posts on his main channel anymore though T_T

You wanna hear something cool X is actually an emoticon for hug, no one is likely going to know that though

i got bodyblocked from the last box the last time i play against the pig, so yeah pig is a no-no for me

Thank you :))

Same she got me from behind a freaking wall .-.

It's worse when you get that one team mate who realizes dream pallets are out, so they get paranoid and start throwing down every pallet they see even when they're not in a chase, wasting about 75% of the real ones. -_-
---
Thank you, I posted it to my friend before editing it. Thought the same thing as me which is cool though
---
When the killer quits, and you’re at the leaderboards, everything you see (besides the total blood points) is a visual glitch. I play on all platforms but mainly main pc.
---
Im glad to hear that, unfortunately it's just happened for me, too. How did they contact you afterwards about this?
---
I would appreciate a DBD2. There are several core mechanics of the game that could be improved.
---
Man I didn't know they buffed huntress this much.
---
The trick is to stab them
---
Tested it. It actually worked.
---
Kill them anyways?
---
[Too bad. ](https://youtu.be/6lgpOdRXXu0?t=5s)
---
I sincerely doubt it because they also just released the game on switch and are still working on the mobile version.
---
I definitely wouldn't mind if they released it still on next gen where xbox one plus scarlet or whatever its called can play together, ps4 + ps5, and then pc can just keep getting graphical updates if they want to do it that way.
---
But I agree there really isnt a need to release a new game, but I like the idea. The DLC kind of takes care of that need with the new maps and stuff though, so.

This is so awesome man

The go to argument for the battle pass I've seen on this subreddit has been "you just don't like it cause Fortnite has one". While some people hate it for that reason, I feel like the big problem with it is that the majority of the content in the game is already paid DLC, it just feels greedy to wall off more content in a game you already have to pay for when over half of the content in the game you have to buy separately.

If he doesn't have PS Plus he can't play it.

The line is something like "Play this game as long as you want if you're a PS Plus Member"
---
Just remember to take off the tin foil hat during Thunderstorms.
---
r/woooosh
---
thanks for this comment, i got showered in downvotes just because saying the same thing ^^
---
You're acting like this game doesn't already have microtransactions
---
Like you said, it's a tad rude but it's not like he's tricking anyone. He'll play your build, that's the deal. He doesnt have to like it/praise it, just *play* it. Plus he gets a lot of joke/meme builds, it can be hard at times to differentiate those from serious builds. Still, theres times where it's like "We know your build is not the strongest, please stop complaining about it..  Especially because you're doing pretty well still"
---
Post the other, please. 😊
---
I feel you, sometime so use them but eh, I can take it or leave it lol
---
"Don't end up like this" was probably in reference to being downed and carried by the Killer. It has nothing to do with the outfit or Dwight specifically. This is the thumbnail video btw: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U\_j02YEDmV4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_j02YEDmV4)
---
Since you're already watching him, PainReliever does have plenty of videos that offer advice to Survivors and Killers. Definitely check the channel out, it doesn't hurt to listen to that soothing voice either. 
---
And btw, there's nothing wrong with playing Dwight. I'm not sure why you think that. The stereotype for Dwight players is that they're often new players who hide in lockers a lot because they're so scared, and as such Killers are more likely to show them mercy. But that's not hate.
---
Hit ‘em with the reverse franklin’s
---
Discordance and Surveillance are good in this case. Both are tracking perks and help you keep an eye on how many survivors are on gens and where.
---
I do intend to
---
Unless you want to jump through some flaming hoops to get devour/ rankour to work
---
Ok first question what perks are you running because without ruin or some form of gen regression perks this is bound to happen every game?
---
I can attest to this: Ive been playing trying to use perks instead like Devour Hope and recently I only get like 3 tokens max because the survivors either let their team mates die on first hook, or they unhook immediately and then I win like 2 minutes after because they don't work on gens or do anything.
---
Yeah no kidding. Hard pass on that
---
That's freaking adorable!
---
Truth. I always hook P3 claudette. Also if you are overly aggressive in gesturing, tea bagging, body blocking, and flashlight clicking.
---
I think devour still has a place in the game, but honestly screw trying to daily with it.
---
E x p o s e d
---
Sorry that I value something that you don’t?
---
Wait but doesn't killing somebody give you less points towards pipping up than getting 4 sacrifices?
---
It is a really fun perk to play with and honestly for the most part survivors haven't been able to cleanse my totems quickly, but I just can't get the damn tokens to mori.
---
It's definitely not dead. I have around 5 minute wait times as killer, and 8ish as survivor on weekdays. Weekends seem much faster. I'm in the lower ranks, because I mostly play PC. 16 killer 15 survivor.
---
They will release a dbd special edition for the next consoles and sell em for 60
---
It might have the same content the switch version comes with out the box
---
Awww
---
This is getting out of hand
---
Yes, but you get to watch a cool animation, plus 60k bloodpoints if you mori someone for the ritual.
---
Aaw, this is too cute :3
---
Agreed. The exposed status effect is all I ever get to
---
I dont have very many at the moment, pop has been my main one as I havent gotten ruin yet. I probably should just level out hag to do it tho. 
---
I bought pop off the shrine. But most of my perks are base. I havent really thought kuch about getting the perks yet as I just was focusing on trying to get my gameplay down before enhancing with perks.
---
I play on Xbox and everytime a killer quits there is an emblem failsafe that works so you just safety pip and get 5k bp.
---
Dab
---
Ruin with pgtw will make a huge difference
---
Looks really cool!
---
I personally think they should make a part 2 and just start fresh with a well optimized game and better looking engine, instead of wasting time and money trying to optimize a game that looks dated and runs poorly.
---
Now I want to go in with kyf and see if I can get a perfect ark shot with huntress
---
True quiet a few killers do it, in fact I feel kinda bad if I don't
---
It can make swf’s dc before the game even starts loool
---
Shoutout to that one doctor who had 5 stacks on hunters lullaby, ruin and unnerving presense.
---
I am on xbox so I already got hag for free, and I have enough for 2 more killers. (Bought spirit and ghostface) so I guess I'll go for pog maybe and cannibal. Not sure.
---
Alright. Guess I'll pump hag some blood
---
These are so great
---
WAIT A MINUTE THIS IS ILLEGAL!
---
I hate pity-hatches so I always wiggle
---
I play survivor and killer, but sheesh decisive is the most annoying thing in the world. A free 60 seconds is tough to deal with, especially when exit gates are powered and they're crawling to the exit. Its the saddest ending ever when you pick them up right before the escape and they run out :( lol
---
Good day sir! You just won the Internet! So much win!
---
All these perks works the 1st chase, that’s not an advantage. Vaulting itself creates distance but the moment you are vaulting is when you are most vulnerable. Other perks helps you to get to the vault safely whereas lithe only effects you after you vault which imo helps the least. When other perks and vaulting offers multiple ways to gain distance, since your main way is through vaulting, you objectively has less options and higher probability to lose the mind game. Also, you don’t really have to walk the entire game to use SB, it helps you to get around the map faster if you have awareness of the killers position. You can also store your SB to be used at any location any time if you time your exsaution correctly.
---
Dude you need to calm down before you have a fucking heart attack
---
Did you boop the snoot?
---
thanks... I hate it
---
Yeah im sure he gets attacked, but he is kinda a dick over a video game. I can never tell whats a jokr and whats truly being an asshole
---
&gt;I have 0 proof
---
Because it's completely untrue. Tru will be brutally honest with his opinion but I've never ever seen him curse or berate anyone besides his stalkers. In fact, I'd actually say that Otz curses and berates people way more often than Tru does.
---
New Dwight cosmetic confirmed
---
I’d smash
---
I have the same exact problem. You’re not alone
---
Nah
---
"just cosmetic" is a meaningless distinction anyway. Cosmetic items play into people's preexisting understandings of social hierarchy and class. Kids are literally getting bullied at school because they can't buy as many "just cosmetic" items in Fortnite as their wealthy peers can.
---
I love this super well done
---
I've seen the same people disconnect 5+ times in a row as soon as they're downed. Clearly they need to be harsher.
---
&gt;it's not a serious game
---
It's not fun when two of your teammates DC fuck you.
---
Yea I would do the same as killer main. I can’t stand key escapes. I once got 5 stacks of devour only to have those lil bitches escape and force me to derank
---
Welcome to the wonderful world of "Pay to Enjoy". This game is brutal as killer without certain perks, especially the higher in rank you go.
---
Same as ebonies lol. I don’t even get them since they are expensive and get the challange out of the game anyway.
---
okay but... what about with wiggle points being added
---
You should make a blogspot of your comics, it has monetization potential.
---
I'm confused... where are the t-bags?
---
I'm not used to seeing dead by daylight with out toxicity.  
---
Anyway its awesome, shame I can't upvote it more.
---
Weekdays at night are practically dead, weekend nights are active
---
rip my weekend off
---
That would only fix one scenario of where the key is broken. Doesnt change the fact that half the survivors can easily escape before the end of the match.
---
Exactly.  Its ingrained into us as a culture to judge based on what you appear as.  Especially as a gamer that doesnt just play on weekends but cant afford all the cool stuff.  These idiots dont realize theyre PREYING on that.
---
I can see this happening already it hurts me physically.
---
Play how you want, survivors can be salty if they want to be
---
In Scenario 3 I thought I made it clear that you go back to get the person doing the unhooking, not the person that just got unhooked. So it’s in no way tunnelling. So you’ve misunderstood that one.
---
In Scenario 1, again you seem to have misunderstood it. You are only blinking back because you got the unhook alert.
---
Whole reason why spirit is horrible right now. These Hitboxes make her so unfun to play against. Not to mention there is no counter to her says my Rank 1 survivor friend.
---
Remindes me that umbra has like over a thousand or something crazy like that
---
That's adorable. :)
---
Unrealistic though. Pigs are the meanest killers, hands down.
---
Wholesome.
---
Wow this is amazing! Down to every last detail
---
same, I recently discovered the 2017 track on spotify and I haven't been able to stop listening to it since. those were the days of vacuum pallets and instablinds, sure, but I miss em a lot :&lt;
---
For sure if u only have lvl1 with out enduring its pretty useless, but if u had lvl 3 without enduring it's definitely still worth using. If you can have both then ur good to go
---
I know you of all people won't want to hear this, but right now bear traps are unfair AF: They're extremely hard to see on most maps (and this is coming from someone who can spot a Blendette from a mile away on MacMillan), imprecise collisions can be exploited to hide them completely (and don't pretend that's not a straight-up exploit, a hair's breadth from actually cheating), they injure you AND give the Killer your location AND prevent you from getting away for a really long time, and getting out of them is totally RNG-based. And don't get me started on Honing Stone—pretty sure that's the only thing in the game that can instadown a Survivor without *any Killer interaction*. Fuck that.
---
But—and I'll admit I don't play Trapper much—I think the OP does get at the biggest problem Trapper seems to have: he's the only Killer who has to waste excessive amounts of time wandering around the map moving his power items around. And in a game that is essentially a race, that's fucking crippling. Letting him start with more traps, and carry more at once, seems like the best way to address that.
---
Right now, Trapper suffers from the same problem as most other things in Dead By Daylight: He's ability is too binary. Somehow both too strong and too weak at the same time. When his traps work, they feel fucking unfair and are awful unfun to deal with as a Survivor... But it's also too easy to avoid the areas where his traps are setup, making him effectively powerless. The devs seem to have a huge problem making things actually fair on both sides, so instead they make everything unfair all the time, but make it situational which side it's unfair to.
---
In my opinion, Trapper needs a major rework, but making traps stronger should absolutely *not* be a part of that. Instead, they should be made more fair—and yes, that means nerfing them a bit—while giving Trapper the ability to deploy them more liberally.
---
Not that anyone cares, but here's what I would do:
---
* Start with and carry multiple traps by default. (Similar to OP's suggestion.)
---
* Fix trap collisions to prevent hiding them inside the floor. (This should be relatively easy if you calculate trap position from the corners of the bounding box, not just the center point like they seem to be doing now.)
---
* Make trap escape time more predictable, skill-based, and a bit shorter, but add a secondary effect to compensate; e.g., Hindered until healed, possibly Hemorrhage. The idea here is that a Survivor being caught in a trap outside of a chase shouldn’t be a free kill, like it often is right now unless the Killer is on the other side of the map; the Killer should still have to chase them, but it should significantly debuff the Survivor in ways that make them easier to track and catch.
---
* Replace insta-down trap add-ons with add-ons that cause the *Deep Wound* status effect. Getting insta-downed at random with no Killer interaction is unfair.
---
* Require skill check to disarm without becoming injured.
---
&gt;As of right now, you can heal yourself to 99%, step on as many traps as  you want, and then quickly finish it up to 100% no problem.
---
Easy fix: Anything (traps, Feral Frenzy stabs, etc.) that "injures you if not already injured" should simply reset any healing progress to zero.
---
Also: What kinda RNG are those Survivors getting? Clearly not the same one I get. In my experience, it takes *so fucking long* to get out of a bear trap that if you step in one, you'll be on a hook before you get the chance to step in another, unless the Killer is literally on the opposite side of the map. It's fucking ridiculous.
---
But like, why not right?
---
This is my favorite artwork from this sub. Absolutely adorable and I love anything about Oink Girl!
---
Nothing is toxic unless you're using all exposed perks on one-hit killers, then you suck and you should feel bad.
---
It's not just you it punishes the other 3 survivors in the game as well. As soon as that guy who gets 1st downed dc's theirs almost no chance the game will go well. unless the killer shows mercy which these days is rare since toxicity is so high.
---
No, but I will disconnect.
---
That's dedication
---
borrowed time is so unfair - i hate borrowed time because it is so unfair to the survivors team surviving, survival on hook unhook is so unfair when i am play bubba (who i love to play but i just can't cause it's no fun because of borrowed time) and then i hit then i am hit borrowed times and i hitted them and they didno't go into the floor where i can hooked them again to get the kills for the adept bubba achievement (my favourite achievement i need for profiles' showcase) and asslo for rank 1 achieevment it, is so unfair when i try to hooking the surviving it is like basement is useless, im taking off monstris shrine and iyorn grasp it's so unfair cuz even when i run instasaw i only get 1 kill at the end of the game with NOED (thank god we have one good perk for killer in ghr game) and then the stupid survivors cry in endgame chat about how unfair and "0 skill" noed is even though they died to it but it's ok cause i can just roast them :D stupid salty survivings
---
I have it on level 3 but idk. I've never gotten a free hit outta it. It just barely shortens the chase but even then it rarely procs
---
Half Life 3 by Daylight?
---
But rin is Adam's counterpart we must love her whether we like it or not.
---
Your rank 1 survivor friend is an idiot
---
Decent fps
---
How is selfcare a great counter?
---
An interesting add-on idea I’ve considered for pig.
---
As we all know, the ability “Jigsaws Baptism” belonging to the Pig, is entirely RNG based. As a killer who mains pig, her ability does take some time out of the objective to make survivors run around with a metal cage on their head. However, I thought it would be cool to improve a current add on that pig has. 
---
This particular add-on change was inspired by one of The Nightmares’ (Freddy) add-on called “Red Paintbrush”. To summarize what his add-on does, whenever Red Paintbrush is equipped, all survivors will start the match in dream state, and additionally can’t fail skill checks to wake up.
---
I thought it would be an interesting idea make a change to the Pig add-on called “Rules Set No.2”, which says “Disables the Survivors ability to see Jigsaw Boxes highlighted until their Trap is activated.” 
---
This is a pretty basic add-on that includes freedom to wait until your trap is active to get it off, or to search around the map and take it off ahead of time. 
---
Here’s my proposal,
---
What if pig had an ultra rare add-on that would look a little something like this:
---
(Concept Name): “All survivors start the match with a Reverse Bear Trap on their head. Disables the survivors ability to see Jigsaw boxes until their Trap is activated. 
---
Reduces additional Bear Traps to 1. 
---
This is just a basis to what I’m thinking for the description. I would like it to have a penalty, but not be so overpowered where it can be abused. Another thought could be if survivors fail a skill check, their timer could be activated faster.
---
TDLR; the add-on: “All survivors start the match with a Reverse Bear Trap on their head. Disables the survivors ability to see Jigsaw boxes until their Trap is activated. 
---
Let me know what you guys think! I’m open to any comments or constructive criticism.
---
They’re already fucked with a killer as broken as Nurse
---
I think its super funny when people say a good way 2 fix an OP addon is 2 just increase the rarity, then i look at pics when people have like 200 prayer beads
---
No, the only instance it's bannable IIRC is if you repeatedly stream spine them specifically to grief and harass them
---
The nice killers are usually the ones who've played both sides.
---
Noice!
---
Legion likes to stop you from healing with your team mates and self care is just good
---
This is incredible! I’m really loving this whole series that you’re doing; I would totally buy one as a poster.
---
Oh i see, definitely go get enduring lol.
---
A free event in a $30 game with $100 worth of DLC and microtransactions
---
This list makes literally no sense, you say self care is a great counter but Inner strength isnt? a good legion will be running Thana and sloppy. Self care will be more useless then it already is.
---
Hope is a great counter since it gives you a speed boost, And why do you put Scratch mark perks so high? you know he cant see scratch marks while in frenzy right?
---
**Hollowed Soul**
---
Haha ikr! 
---
When u said about yelp reviews, is it common to review dbd chars on yelp? Would love to read some haha
---
AWWW I LOVE THESE
---
however, if you play this build, you shouldn't complain when others use it against you.
---
Killers get pips if they delay a game, get tons of hooks and win chases and such. By reducing all of those numbers the killer can’t move up. Spirit is hands down the worst killer to play and be against. Worst fucking S-tier killer.
---
Nurse is the other S-tier killer that I call S because she takes time to learn and when you know her you can win  plus she is better at looping than a damn spirit. I am skilled in the art of looping a rank 1 nurse and stunning mid teleport with pallet
---
The Wes Craven clique
---
Huh. Didn't know they added Commando Pro as a new killer perk
---
How can you say that to the Bing Bong boy with party streamers
---
I guess that’s fair
---
sounds like an issue with people who play killers to me
---
I really like the first part! Can u apply for a job at behaviour then implement this? Hahaha
---
Its not possible to be balanced. If its stronger then its basically a free 4k at the start of the match because they got unlucky with the jigsaw spawns. If its weaker its worse then you stated now. At best the only thing that could be changed is to prevent the ability to remove it when its hidden so they can't check for the addon at the start.
---
Your basically setting yourself up for a 4k if you just use Crate of gears + this, if every survivor has to go to the same one and its the last one they check its a guarenteed kill on at least one person if they were far enough from the final box to check.
---
The dedicated severs are not finished yet.
---
There's people who have dc'd hundreds of times and are still playing.
---
Pop goes the weasel is a meta perk in my opinion. I also think discordance is better then bbq,
---
And whispers is great on any killer
---
Bruh my perk is a joke 😒
---
I mean he had those real long arms in the dream sequence of the first movie
---
have him renew his licenses in the PS4 options, maybe even redownload the game again
---
Edit: additionally, its not an issue with PS+ like the other comments are implying since they didnt see this picture. If it just straight up didnt let him load the game at all, it would be
---
Okay? It just doesn't really apply at all
---
When I saw the perks I knew what Feng was dressed as
---
Imagine that, Entity cosmetics for Killers and gen cosmetics for survivors.
---
So you make an events reward purchasable weeks before and then delay the event so people who want to play for the reward cant. Guess more people will just buy the reward instead of playing a recycled event.
---
I had a survivor last night that spent the entirety of the gaming jumping in and out of lockers. She would come find me and get me to chase, and as soon as she went to an infinite loop I’d leave and she would start doing that. I ended up getting a 3k I believe just because she wasn’t doing any objectives.
---
Adrenaline just save you time instead of healing for popping that last gen or can come in clutch when you get downed or hooked.
---
Gen are already fairly easy to do, we don't need something to help us with getting gens faster lol
---
Yasssss bithhhhh
---
That's so heckin cute, stop it!!!
---
No, it won't happen
---
He isn't tho lol. First off he is immersed. He suggests stealth. His perk loadout sucks and the rounds I've playef with him he's died.
---
Expert troll? Literally no other explanation. I refuse to believe this person believes that.

For sure. Just maybe not Halloween 2019.
---
What do u mean
---
I’d recommend replacing dying light with STBFL or nurses, it can lead to some fun sneaky plays
---
My favorite
---
Realease
---
Well okay.  I think the devs are thinking of turning DCed players into bots so the killer can still farm/sacrifice them.  Same with survivors being bale to farm it.  Not immediately but still.  What will you do then?  Besides the killer can still safety pip anyways.
---
I like the word play! This would actually be kind of awesome imo.
---
I think people really underused and misunderstand Ghostface's stalk... more useful than you think
---
If I see people farming their teammates then I’ll target them, however quite often I’ll return to a hook after the save and if ur in the area healing (which I can see with nurses calling) and I don’t see anyone else because they were smart enough to leave then of course I’ll re down and hook u, I’m not just gonna walk away and let u pop a gen while I’m searching randomly for 3 other pple who were smart enough to hide after the unhook
---
Yawn. Move on.
---
I'm curious... watch my next reply over the next couple of days (if you can do that) new to Reddit. I personally enjoy otz, but I always love a good experiment
---
The only thing you said that remotely was a counter was perks. Perks shouldn't ever be the only decent counter for a killer.
---
I don't like otz.
---
Wish it went just a second longer to see if the other surv also got dragged into the EGC.
---
Or the fact that they promised an event and then realised last minute that the event was tied to the mid chapter patch that they weren't even halfway done with ...
---
He didn't unfortunately.
---
❤❤
---
lol same
---
Make your choice, Noed, Haunted Grounds, those are the three I remember, but there's more than that.
---
???
---
It's definitely crutch but I wouldn't refer to it as toxic at all.
---
Yeah maybe think about your teammates first?
---
Do you play on PC?
---
Yes. Yes it is. Don't go there though. I had to bleach my eyes
---
You forgot to boop the snoot.

The ultra rares are way too strong jesus fucking christ

Too late to edit.

Both, your an omega blink nurse, you can travel half the map in one blink
---
Inb4 a laggy doc snipes you with shock from across the map
---
This is fucking fantastic!
---
\#toomuchaltruism ha ha
---
Nurse. Blood warden/NOED/Insidious/Agitation build. Teleport into an exit gate and wait. There’s a 50/50 chance they pick your gate.
---
I love it
---
Oink
---
That’s literally the only counter to DS
---
Use charges quicker because you’re healing quicker. There are separate items that give more charges tho
---
This is great
---
&gt;What I DO mind is when it lasts shorter that me on sex.
---
I would be more worried about your premature ejaculation than your DBD performance
---
Kate’s my main
---
Want not wants.
---
Lower profile and less noise
---
Just ignore those guys and play the next one...
---
The second best killer and most of the best perks are DLC. You’re not being forced, but very heavily pushed
---
That's why I'd prefer it to be countered by hooking another survivor Instead of downing the one with DS then having to wait 60 seconds
---
Yeet
---
They "hope" to have a status update tomorrow, but they might not be able to get on Twitter and type a few sentences due to unforeseen circumstances.
---
I don’t give to many comments but this is FUKING great. U get a live your dreams from me
---
It’s funny though.
---
How are Overwatch's cosmetics you can gradually amass over time pay-to-win when Dead by Daylight has characters and perks behind paywalls?
---
And how would other systems being worse make a bad one okay?
---
This exact same thing happened to me last week. The other 2 had a key and left me there, and when the killer found me I dropped my toolbox in front of him and prepared to get sacrificed... he opened the gate for me and let me go!
---
We're always legally allowed to leave. I just want the horrible clownface before I go.
---
You can't get the currency for the cosmetics through the event anyways. The currency will be part of the Archives.
---
Y'all really more pissed that there's a battle pass instead of the fact that 75% of the content is locked behind paywalls LOL
---
Literally just happened to me.
---
oMg fUcKiNg tUnNeLeR.
---
Well if you wouldn't have healed under the hook for the 5th fucking time in a row now, maybe I wouldn't have caught you.
---
Let’s be fair here, they could be shit posting. But I know people are that stupid sometimes.
---
A very wise man once said "there are no good spirit players, only players with headphones"
---
Thats THE REASON were pissed genius.  Because THERES ALREADY PAID CONTENT
---
bruh
---
Maybe we should establish a casual play queue discord?
---
I feel the same way, friend. I try my best to keep a smile and positive responses regardless of how toxic the other person is. Toxicity makes it really disheartening to play other killers rn too. I typically play Ghost Face, but I've been playing Legion to get his perks. Unfortunately I do shite as a lvl6 legion against lvl30 survivors haha.
---
Just smile and wave.
---
Did he actually steal it?
---
which releases at the same time as the halloween event
---
You should sell prints of these covers.
---
I wouldn’t say start with them, I think the best thing about some killers is not knowing who they are at the beginning of the match. I know that some of them you know right away, but my favorite matches are when I’m scared shitless by a chainsaw in the distance while working on that first gen, or turning around to notice there’s a Meyers staring me down.
---
D E M A N D S
---
You husband now!
---
But you dont have to do it during the halloween event lol.
---
Except they have outright stated they will return to the shop months later.
---
you didn't acknowledge what i said, Acknowledge it, Why did me and ONE other friend make it to red ranks very easily( we weren't taking the games seriously) and when im killer, i have to put on try hard pants, and u cant even use mori cause the game will just black pip u
---
I just wanna scooby doo RP Ghost Face and jumpscare survivors T_T but I have to sweat and run ruin so I don’t get gen rushed. I wouldn’t even mind 4 escaping if I could get some good jumpscares in.
---
I don’t know what this has to do with what i said but ok
---
Yeah it's real fun for you when you bully me big brain Bubba and I come git u wit  3 stacks pwyf into unhookable face camp. 10/10 chance messages in post game about how if didn't camp could kill more people, 10/10 chance your night ruined but can't admit
---
You’d know if that have rancor tho
---
Imagine thinking killer are the power role in DBD lmao
---
We haven't seen the content that R6 is putting into the main passes yet, or how expensive to premium track will be, so I'm just cautiously optimistic about it. There is nothing inherently wrong about a Battle Pass, other than it relies on FOMO which impacts people in different ways.
---
This looks sick dude! Keep it up!
---
Next week? Are they out of their fucking minds? Ffs.
---
That's what I thought but sometimes it doesn't let me even after they're powered
---
Can we please buff ruin, it's way too weak and only works on 7 gens :/
---
I mean, based on the "demo" we got, which was just a bunch of shit charms, it's not looking great, especially since there has been no word that Year Pass holders will be getting the premium track, and knowing Ubisoft, they'll probably start locking elite skins behind it.
---
How is it good though?
---
Ohh that makes sense. Thank you :)
---
Wait... This is still a thing?
---
(a tactic with this = heal a downed survivor while the killer is confused why they can't pick the survivor up)
---
Ohh yea I know those lol I was confused for a second, I don’t think the hatchets 1 hit during “exposed”
---
I doubt they're going to give Year Pass holders BP premium tracks simply because its bad business. People are gonna be buying those Year Passes anyways, and the Venn Diagram of people who are willing to buy the BP track and already have the Year Pass is a circle. That being said, the benefit of a battle pass is you lose nothing other than cosmetics if you just ignore it.
---
Yea I hate that
---
Pop is 25% current progress. It's not a free 20 seconds. If a gen was 99% finished it wouldn't even be 20 seconds (79/4).
---
Yeah, you absolutely **do not need DLC** to play this game and bitching about a delayed **free event** is the top of absolutely ridiculous. Unless there was some other point other than a free event for the base game
---
Edit and Fallout 76 is a paid thing which hey maybe they should have idk.. Delayed it so they didn't throw a shit extra content product out on a game who's release was a shit show. And there's no reason besides you want to for buying DLC for ea sports Games, sorry but that's a shit argument just like "needing" to buy the DLC for DBD you can be effective still without the DLC if you know what you're doing
---
Really? In my experience like 50% of killers run ruin and like 1% run TOTH
---
Is that monto
---
Standing still prevents going into broken state??
---
Don’t lewd the flower doggy, please. My eyes can take no more.
---
Somehow i knew this was going to be about wholesome/merciful killers
---
Not sure they can mix with death.
---
I mean, we really don't.
---
But thats Your opinion have fun with it!
---
Sounds like bad luck
---
It's an opinion, you're entitled to that. :)
---
But the thing is that, in a way, cosmetics are the only progression in siege if you have the year passes. Ranked? Yea I guess but the ranking system is ***STILL*** in "beta" for years now, and leveling up gives jackshit nothing.
---
Freddy: fingers you hard
---
He just stole it put it on a poster so you can buy it for 32.00 he was trying to profit from op hard work
---
That sucks man. The only time I have met an actual toxic pig was when she was first released and killers were trying her out. A good chunk of them would just sit by the hook crouched. I very rarely see that any more though.
---
One time the hatch didn’t even spawn in. The survivor was running around the same area like 10 times and I was chasing him we both heard the hatch and it wasn’t their but we heard the sound it makes. I caught him and out him on the hook. Right after I put him on the hook I noticed something spawn in right under me. It was the hatch. That hatch didn’t spawn the whole game until that last guy was on hook.
---
That was my initial thought about it... it can be interpreted in different ways.
---
I was about to add that in my comment, sorry if I came off as a rude person
---
Yes and because of insidious they’ll never know you’re in there. Down one with NOED hook them ASAP with Agitation and then Blood Warden makes it so no one can escape
---
These are so good, cant wait to see the next one keep it up!  As someone else said I can really see these as posters or t shirts would be amazing! Congrats
---
You use the changes per progression the same, just faster because the action is faster.
---
It’s bannable on twitch. Not in dbd though.
---
You didn't, no worries!
---
Hang in there guys!
---
So you’re gonna give someone excessive bail if you play spirit?
---
I was thinking that as well but if they can add Tony Hawk, they wouldn't hurt.
---
[The pause between me downing him and picking him up was me pressing the capture that button, but then he did it again.](https://1drv.ms/v/s!AlKWtKLN5pb_gQxEDk-kDkPLVx3U?e=Y0evr9)
---
I was a child of the early 80s and I still dont get this fascination with Scooby Doo but you do you. I'm sure I like plenty of shit that is lame to everyone else.
---
I understand your upset about them being assholes but their is no reason to message them. It’s just a waste of time plus it’s not like your gonna change their mind.
---
I've gotten a few cheeky downs at the gate before as Ghostface like this while crouching. It's so satisfying.
---
pro strategy
---
That sure was...Dwight move.
---
...
---
..
---
.
---
I’ll see myself out.
---
Like the killers can see the perk charms in the pre game lobby lmao
---
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
---
I'm a survivor main but i wanted to try out killer so i bought and played legion because i thought he would be fun, welp it was probably the most frustrating and stressful time I've ever had on the game and i likely just won't play killer anymore. Idk how people can do it lol.
---
With play with your food he is just a bloodlist killer
---
I just hope this patch fixes the Medic trophy on PS4, it's the last trophy i need and it's glitched, so oof. Also I'm low key happy this hasn't dropped because it's allowed me to focus on an o chem test and a physics test instead, so woo I guess.
---
Noishe.
---
Sadly, this never happens to anyone else.
---
Also known as: "I can't play Ghostface. Here's a list of suggestions that make him way too OP."
---
Exactly, but complaining about something that's free and only delayed is absolutely being an entitled brat that OP is being
---
I'm aware of what a meme is? It still had nothing to do with my comment and I was just wondering why it was sent as a response to me. You people are whack.
---
I'm? Not? Sure? You? Know? How? To? Use? Question? Marks? Properly?
---
At this point I feel like I have to try really damn hard every killer game And I don’t really want to have to sweat every damn game for the entire game! A sweat at the end I don’t mind cause it gives tension but to sweat the whole game and get no one at the end and then get bm’d is enough to make me stop playing for the day.
---
You are right, it is pretty obnoxious. I guess it's a good thing that those 'statements' are actually questions, huh?
---
Solo survivor is a shitshow, I play more killer but I do like the challenge of playing solo survivor and trying to be a good teammate though.
---
Again, you people are whack
---
Really? I always imagined females have it easier when making friends in gaming? The expectations are typically low when its a female (from what ive seen). 
---
Im genuinely intrigued btw. Not saying youre wrong or anything.
---
I guess if that's what you believe
---
I warn you. They get really salty in the game chat after lol
---
Great drawing but personally i don't like how the mist covers wraith, its probably near impossible to convey the shimmer wraith gives in comic book style but it really doesn't convey wraith to me in this picture, maybe if he was dinging the bell instead of going for the swing.
---
None of them are questions. They are all statements
---
I've had the game since just before Freddy was first released and honestly, it's gotten to the point where I only play a couple matches a day, a couple days a week, solely to keep my rank low while not exposing myself to prolonged salt and sweat. These days I only want to grind Bloodpoints to keep up because I STILL don't have every perk ever and don't play enough to keep my shard count up because I simply don't have the mentality to be able to play full time, let alone seriously. The game needs a special kind of change it's never going to get.
---
Not actually the case. But anyways, please find someone else for your strange targetted harasment
---
Was just going to say that, I would buy.
---
Yep, i think they should have some sort of 2 killer mode or a casual mode or just some other fun game mode that takes some of the stress away. But it's dbd so that'll never happen.
---
Just got you to 69 upvotes my friend
---
I remember a zubat video with that happening to demo. 10/10 would buy
---
Petition to get a jumpscare mode where the killer get’s more points the more they scare the survivors, they can only kill them when they’re at MAXIMUM TERROR
---
Find me one of those that isn’t a question.
---
PC
---
so cute!! (I love the skin, too)
---
What do you mean, mediocre??
---
What system? You could always find a group to play with
---
They're secret offerings, so they aren't shown. That's just bad luck
---
A key can save all four survivors before a killer gets a mori. I'll give you Ebony mori and any key in the same category, but cypress is definitely not in that league. Both DS and Cypress, when triggered by a specific circumstance, intereupts standard game flow for an automatic favorable outcome for the user. Literally the same coin.
---
The worst!
---
I guess we're all salty sometimes
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
&gt; What I DO mind is when it lasts shorter that me on sex.
---
Dude, it already lasts 15 seconds to cleanse the thing, even if they spawned on it it would last longer.
---
like he would know which game i played against otz in. i can say for a fact that it was on his stream and we didnt run OoO. if you want specifics i can give it
---
Not sure when it became a thing, but you may want to do it after you hook a survivor to put pressure on the rest of the team to make a move or get out since the collapse timer will begin.
---
Killer running iron will, i like the idea.
---
i mean sometimes because theyre like “omg a girl” lmfao. If im playing with a group of guys sometimes its weird cause they’ll say something and im like “okay how do i respond not sounding like an asshole” im not sure about expectations though are they supposed to be low?? Also the bullying, being harassed for finding out im a female or continuously call me a little boy because obviously my voice is not deep.
---
Bullied by billy next 😂😂
---
So noones gonna point out that this dude changed the tense from frame 3 to 4?
---
They do need to work it a little it was killer sided without dedicated servers and now it’s more survivor sided with dedicated servers. Or it’s just his ping was better than yours
---
I know. Issa joke.
---
Cause... it's Not Otz.
---
I would rather have it in an empty field than right there near a survivor’s main objective.
---
Best. Thread. Ever.
---
Claudette: shouldn’t we stop this?
---
Dwight: she brought hatchets with iridescent head.
---
Claudette: never mind.
---
You always know it's a pig because of the boxes.
---
I'd be a good meme
---
I personally run BBQ, Pop goes the Weasel, Ruin and Dying Light.
---
Fuck you bhvr
---
But a killer that know about the offerings will k iw if it's a shroud
---
Try 
---
1. Ruin/corrupt intervention your preference 
---
2. Pop goes the weasel 
---
3. BBQ 
---
4. Sloppy butcher 
---
Nurses is always good too if you find yourself struggling to find survivors
---
Survivors shrouds are useless by themselves anyways. It's a big fuckin sign that says HEY WE'RE ALL OVER HERE! Or my favorite, the obvious combination of shrouds that literally screams "WE ARE STARTING OUT IN THIS EXACT CORNER OF THE MAP FARTHERST AWAY FROM YOU!" 
---
And as a killer, you don't want to use the shroud of separation because that means 4 people soloing gens and you can only chase 1 dude at a time so that means that 3 gens are gonna pop real fast unless you down the guy you're chasing very fast. 
---
Shrouds need to be removed from the game for real.
---
Save the best for last is meta on legion
---
Weird flex but ok.
---
Awesome work! Would love to see it resized for a phone wallpaper!
---
Damn imagine getting toxic over people making a joke lol
---
I use bbq, ruin, brutal strength, and discordance.
---
Why is she afraid of such a low tier killer. Jk I actually really like wraith with coxcombed clapper and the ghost
---
You say that but bugs get really weird. A couple days ago, my game froze when I hit madness 1 and then crashed. Everyone probably thought I dced because I hate doc.
---
But wont' know which Shroud. This wouldn't change that
---
But they did pretty good job so far.
---
Demogorgon: **Wants to scream**
---
Iron Will: "Shhhh, shut the fuck up“
---
I understood that reference
---
😂 if it makes you feel better, you're not the first person I've heard who thought this when they first started
---
Because it's pretty basic and common knowledge that if a survivor uses the only secret offering they have then the killer knows exactly where to go at the start of the match because it can only ever be 1 of 2 things so they're either right or they're wrong and soon find 3 people on a gen.
---
Yup and Halloween is Thursday!
---
The shop will stay. And plus I like having a goal in a game
---
They made Demogorgon a Dick, amd Masturbaited into the Camera while Recording as Ghost Face.. Is some strong stuff there..
---
Right now I run BBQ, Ruin, Nurse’s Calling and Fire it up. The latter only because I am waiting for something better to show up in my blood web. Sometimes I switch it out for something like sloppy butcher.
---
DS is still the best perk in the game even after the nerf. the timer is so long the killer normally gets a stun even if he wasnt tunneling and it prevents you from dying after the exit gates are open.
---
That's true. I want to see more offerings that aren't so useless. I think it could be cool.
---
If you play killer you have to play solo anyway. So I guess it depends on what role appeals to you more
---
Well as a killer you dont really want the survivors to spawn separated, since that will probably make them work on a gen each. Not good.
---
As survivor using the shroud that spawns you furthest away from killer will get you found first, since most killers are just going straight across the map to where the survivors have to be. Having a shroud here that instead spawns you really close to the killer will probably be better, it will be unexpected and he will probably walk past you going to the other side.
---
I've played solo survivor for roughly 1,200 hours. It's not as bad, but inconsistent: One game you'll have a great team that plays efficiently, one game you'll be left to die on a hook while your randoms cower in the corner. I find this to be true at all ranks.  
---
But I'd say the game is still fun. DBD is a team game, but most of the game play doesn't need team work. You just have to get used to losing a game every now and then due to potato-tier randoms on your team lol.
---
tIER list OF kILLERs tHAT hAVe EyeS
---
That's why I always give people the benefit of the doubt. I'm pretty sure monto is a dick at times but so is everyone else who plays multiplayer games. I try to not hold any streamer up to a standard since they are just regular dudes at the end of the day, and regular dudes are dicks time to time.
---
Why didnt you scroll past this then
---
I'll be cool if the survivor hasn't been a toxic little shxt.
---
Wait, they sell Masks aswell? Last time I've checked (today lol) There weren't any Masks
---
Pop Goes the Weasel and Discordance are his 2 core perks imo. Other than you can use what you want, though I use Thrilling Tremors and Sloppy Butcher. Freddy has a lot of map pressure so you can go without Ruin unless you’re facing a really strong swf or it you’re still learning him. Plus the combo of Pop Goes the Weasel + Sloppy Butcher gives you some good slowdown. Don’t be afraid to use BBQ if you need the Bloodpoints. All in all use what you want just make sure you use Pop Goes the Weasel and Discordance.
---
Also forgot to add but he takes the game very serious at times
---
It took them three days to say this?  Also, if it's a full week until even the Q&amp;A, I have no hope that we'll be playing the Halloween event this month.  Massive failure by BHVR.
---
Sooo good. Thanks so much for taking the time to do these.
---
Shit and you don’t think even after they drop the new patch it still won’t be filled with bugs, you can forget this event boys and girls, Halloween is Thursday next week and are they planing on doing the dev stream next week on Halloween??
---
&gt;Jeez! Do you sweat to beat a 6 year old at street fighter then say "git gud" as they cry and run off? No! You act like an adult and give them hope and and encouragement, lose if you have to!
---
No, but you don't lose on purpose because that doesn't teach them anything. A kid can tell when you let them win, and they generally don't like that shit. I never did. Not only that, but playing 1v1 Street Fighter is WAY different from playing this game.
---
&gt;If I'm playing killer and I clearly am vsing new survivors, I'll get my two hooks, give them a good scare, but let them escape. 
---
That's really pointless and you're not helping them learn to play well, nor are you providing them with any real fun. Being given an escape is not fun.
---
&gt;If I'm playing survivor (I ONLY play a bit toxic, like clicking the flashlight etc, if I'm trying to save someone by get the killer's attention), I'll usually drop my item at the end for them, you know, to say like "sorry for causing so much trouble, I'll give this as an offering, and it means I won't be taking it back with me" 
---
This is straight up insane to me. You're overthinking stuff and worrying WAY too much about the other players feelings. It's just a game. If they get salty, so be it. Don't feel bad for being successful.
---
&gt; You don't play games soley to cause someone else pain. We play it to have fun and have safe thrills! 
---
Playing well and winning is not the same as "causing someone else pain" and you shouldn't relate it to that at all.
---
&gt;The Redditor clearly had their fun already, and they were being merciful and letting someone else have fun too! 
---
Carrying a survivor to the hatch is not "fun" for the survivor at all. It's demeaning, if anything.
---
A lot of people don't like the hair, but I love it. Deffo worth the money.
---
I had the hatch move spots for me. I ran past it three times before the end, and when the third survivor died i tried to find it to escape. It fucking moved to halfway between me and the killer, giving him just enough time to find it first, since I was very confused looking for it. That kinda pissed me off.
---
Don’t you mean 3/5/7% luck bonus?
---
Survivors: lmao guys i just hit this dude wit a pallet then insta healed in front of him, bagged at him while he tried to break it, and then ran him around for 5 minutes
---
Killer: well i guess im gonna use noed.
---
Survivors OmG tHaTs So UnFaIr AnD tOxIc
---
Because this post doesn’t bother me in the way tier lists bother you
---
They can't even be bothered to make sure the skins work either. Plague has her shoulder freaking the hell out sometimes and Clown is stuck in a perpetual "Thumbs Up".
---
They're funny as hell but man is it telling they'll gladly push these skins out broken as fast as possible but the actual event is looking like a Thanksgiving Special.
---
Already better than AHS 1984
---
“Unforeseen circumstances”
---
I prefer to play solo honestly.
---
When I play killer (Spirit) I run hex ruin with haunted grounds and thrill of the hunt (I think)
---
It's guessing game now. "Sure mister Survivor. Go ahead and smash that glowing totem."
---
Just link the videos.
---
Camping yourself
---
I Wonder which is worse what happened to Friday the 13th or last year the nightmare.
---
Beware that you'll most likely end up playing on the big screen as it's hard to see things at that size. The amount of time I bumped into tree or other objects when playing on handheld mode is too much of a hassle.
---
Same. I’ll gladly pay for it. The grind is just too long.
---
Naw man survivors are toxic but NOED literally rewards you for losing
---
You're a special little guy, huh
---
But it's bullshit when the spawn directly on it
---
Serving that Snowpiercer looks.
---
F13 is not really on the devs. LYTN is worse imo because its purely on the devs as they were the ones who made shitty decisions not someone above them.
---
NO
---
That whould be great, because I feel like we get an 10/20 Minute long Event.
---
They have already said the event is gonna be the same length just pushed back.
---
Every time I see a pig perk idea I just assume a dev has read this and that very same dev is the one that thinks to themselves, what a perfect opportunity to nerf the pig for no reason. Every time I've seen an idea pop up for pig it is very quickly nerfed on the following update.
---
So do instaheals. As far as noed goes, literally all you have to do is break the totems. There arent that many, most of them are poorly placed, and if you break them all, the killer just lost out on their noed entirely.
---
Duh. He’s running Adrenaline, bro.
---
I mean killer does technically with their abilities
---
And a killer hasnt lost until the last survivor is out the exit gate.
---
You two look amazing, also based on your user name I see you are a woman of culture
---
damn 😔😔
---
The accuracy of this is 101%
---
As a hag main, I approve.
---
"Halloween in November"
---
Halloween is literally the last day of October, how do people get this worked up that an event is probably going to launch ON Halloween.
---
Just cos Americans have stupid holidays every 2 weeks in this half of the year.
---
It was what took me hours more for this piece was actually deciding how to position the wraith mainly related to these problems! I settled with this just because it suited the 70’s comic vibe, tried to get across the emerging look with the strands at the back but it was a challenge to try get the aspects to pull together and stay in the context :) I’ll totally do some more ‘serious’ art and cover the more accurate and sinister parts of the killers some time in future
---
Thank you! They’re v good points, I’ll make sure to next tine
---
Seriously go touch the bones for those sweet sweet 1K Boldness.
---
The problem is that it wasn't just the two of us standing on top of the hatch waiting to see who could hit it first. He hadn't even reached the hatch until the close animation was already halfway through. If my ping was that bad the entire match would have been unplayable.
---
Thinking Billy since he was in the original trio :)
---
For the 10 billionth time, latency. There are at least 50 posts of the same exact thing happening on this sub everyday.
---
Wait, they have illusory pallets in dream world now?
---
Looks perfect to me? Unless you meant great without being sarcastic.
---
Myers had a stroke
---
Trash company, ever since 2.0 introduced the cosmetic shop every Event and big Update is about skins, probably because every crybaby here is demanding shit like shirtless Myers aswell.
---
I think i heard there was a power outage and they lost like a week of progress
---
How to make secret offerings not so useless: Secret offerings don't appear on the offering screen.
---
Also add more secret offerings ffs
---
Still bullshit that you spawned on a totem
---
Hes good for a stealthy player. I'm not immersed myself but it's interesting to see other play styles too. He has good game knowledge as well.
---
4 ranks below not to mention they should be purple ranks
---
I feel like you're the same survivor that says "just apply pressure" when you play against clown. Also, nurse isn't the most mobile before the nerf, billy is prob the fastest at traveling the map.  And you're right, no one is going to always get a 4k when they play, but it is unfair to be in a situation where the survivor is in control because they have an item. Survivors should never have control over the killer in any situation but keys break that rule.
---
Wow, usually fan made perks are super bad and uncreative but these are actually cool
---
Playing on playstation 😎 takes much more effort to be give salty messages.
---
*chuckles* We're in danger!
---
When I read "demands costumes and roleplay" and saw Huntress in there, I couldn't help but think of "You husband now"
---
I Guess your right F13 still has people playing while Last Year only has discord groups and even those aren't active
---
&gt;4 ranks below not to mention they should be purple ranks
---
Matchmaking is supposed to do that.
---
&gt;* If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank. 
---
Ah yes. Good point. 
---
Never thought about it like that.
---
a battle pass in which you can earn your money back so it is essentially revenues neutral you just need to play enough
---
that is the part I like about it
---
Don’t care about ranks. It means nothing in this hame so just play your best
---
This was instant like 10 seconds after i got into a lobby these toxic cucks joined
---
I’m a rank 20 killer and this happens too
---
If the killer was huntress, theres a super precise angle they can throw through a hole in the roof but shed have to know you were there.  Even then that shot is ridiculous if it is true..
---
Ruin, BBQ, Pop, and Thrilling tremors is my build atm, Pop especially is just insane on Freddy when combined with BBQ, or my personal preference, Thrilling Tremors
---
Legion looks like a lego man lol
---
Thank you! :)
---
He was being a dick
---
So I'm assuming you are against using the hatch?
---
I can’t believe you just typed that unironically
---
Too late. OP is dead. His anger and sodium overflowed and he has now perished in the best way possible.
---
He drowned in a mountain of salt
---
this was so cute, please keep making more!
---
Sorry for the bad quality, my phone's super old &gt;_&lt;
---
I suck at her but she is fun to play as, especially if you have good experience as survivor, you know what they are going to do (although that last part applies to a lot of killers)
---
lmao, you gotta pull back to your keyboard or controller and try not to fail, huntress lullaby is a total monster when it comes to scratching an itch
---
I play killer as well as survivor and as much as the hatch thing is unfortunate, survivor in this one case kind of deserves hatch advantage in my eyes, obviously not if it’s due to lag, but if it’s up in the air in any respect, since as killer it’s our fault for not slugging the 2nd last survivor to prevent the hatch from opening in the first place. And if you’re just camping the hatch, it could go either way in my eyes but I’d default to seeing this instance for survivor advantage. When you watch the top killers on YouTube or twitch, they know to generally slug the 2nd last survivor to prevent such a situation from appearing on the horizon. Im going to assume you’re a good rank killer. I don’t believe in the “survivor rule book” or any such things, I get flamed in post game chat on my killer rounds so understand that whole scenario too well. I feel in regards to hatch access, I feel survivors should have a slight frame advantage over the killer due to the killer having free reign over being able to look for the hatch danger free where the survivor is at risk the entire time.
---
I love this series so much. I want these on shirts.
---
everyone has there own opinions brother
---
Groovy.
---
I play against purple ranks when I’m green. And reds when im purple. That’s just how matchmaking is
---
Look who's shiting in the tall grass
---
I am the other way around. If you don't wiggle, you have given up and thus deserve to die. As survivor, i wiggle when i'm on the killer's shoulder unless they signal me or is obvious that they wan to give me hatch.
---
Would you want this phrased in a way that doesn't interact with other obsession perks, or are you fine with having this show the aura of one of the people that brought DS before it gets to last survivor?
---
Oh boy it’s the Tinkerer 2 glitch all over again 🙄
---
Don't expect the entitled pricks to understand
---
I have no problem with this.
---
These are so absolutely amazing! I love these so much.
---
Oh no..
---
“facecamping hatch”
---
T qui?
---
Ok guys we get it. We all love Otz.
---
Oh shit how do you unlock these
---
idk, I've been on both sides of it, if they're wiggling i assume they think they can escape still, if they don't i just assume they've either given up or i'm looking for hatch. as a survivor i just give up on death/last person hook because there's no point in fighting it at that point.
---
you need to sale these in poster form I need a framed one for each cover. Incredible please make posters then shut up and take my money!
---
True. Ghostface is fine where he is right now. Getting of a lean stalk mid chase is where it's at.
---
Laughs in Australia

It was 32 friggin degrees yesterday, I hate hot weather

Killer is underpowered as a whole meaning that nothing a killer can do is truly overpowered. Things can be good, annoying, powerful, ect. But no matter how good whatever they have is, whether its a mori, noed, good addons, decent killer, survivors can end the game in three minutes. That doesn't really give killers enough time to do things. I play survivor and killer and I'm able to say with an non-bias opinion that survivor games are easier than killer games. Moris are really good, but, if a killer can only get 1-2 hooks with 30 second chases before the gens are done, does an ability that works after youve hooked someone matter. Obviously, moris and keys are both bad for the game but keys will always be better as long as killer is worse than survivors.

EDIT: also, id like to see the statistics for nurse being used mored than keys. Seeing as there is a one to four ratio of killers and survivors every match i find it hard to believe that nurse is played more than keys are used. Feels like you're spitting bullshit for you're argument to sound stronger, it's making it worse.

Not JUST a rapist.

Vore

Probably just Knock Out with a custom icon. You know, for slugging.
---
You have to sacrifice each of the original four survivors (Dwight, Meg, Claudette and Jake) 25 times.

I level her up with BP from the last Blood hunt in about two days to unlock ruin. There might be one during the upcoming event but it hasn't been confirmed. But then I started playing her and she's actually ridiculously fun, it's very interesting trying to find good places to set her traps. So you might honestly just have fun playing her to level her up as you already have her.

I can't say for certain but it's most likely Deerstalker.
---
Actually wasn’t Legion, it was Plague that made me leave. Thought she was way more annoying
---
Deerstalker. He just edited the image on the files.
---
You're right. Those were the two that came to mind then thinking of those eggs sacks
---
These are so cute! I need more!

Huntress is the one that was just a child when she lost her mother. My guess is that she wouldn't know how to react.

DC’ing makes you scum, end of discussion. If your teammate is being camped and a save can’t be made, bang out gens and leave. If you’re being camped and a save can’t be made, struggle as long as you can so your teammates can bang out gens and leave. The best way to fight camping is to punish the playstyle by counterplaying, not by DC’ing and getting yourself banned

Bruh I'm a survivor main. The joke is funny, no one is siding with toxic killers.
---
I have played her but I hate playing so many hex totems
---

"Alright, I've hooked that guy just now, so I'll check on some gens and- oh he's off the hook. Well then I'll proc the BT- oh he doesn't have it. Right I'll just eat his DS- oh he doesn't have that either. Huh."

While it hasn't been long at all since last bloodhunt, they really should attach that to this event at release just as a consolation prize and a token of their apology for it all. I'll be happy with that and can forgive.
---
Still just genuinely confused as to why I'm being personally attacked, for asking what the meme had to do with my comment, or why it was directed at me, but alright.
---
I would love to see this on a Christmas sweater
---
I find it really funny when you are stumping survivors and they get ruin 2 sacrifices into the match. Yeah guys, that's gonna help you a lot.
---
I mean, I literally asked what the joke had to do with my comment, and I'm getting personally attacked, all I've said is "whack" Not sure how I'm the toxic one here?
---
People debate facts all the time. Saying that something being debatable makes it an opinion is just wrong.
---
Well, you know, its pretty popular to hate on America, so honestly, I'm not surprised.
---
Just like its popular to call the opposing side you disagree with names.
---
For real tho, maybe she could have an add-on that starts the timer straight away?
---
I mean c'mon, Pig needs some love
---
Lol with this build they might out of their way to spill their hatred lol
---
The type of people that camp would be ecstatic if everyone rage quit and killed themselves. Easy 4ks, lots of salt, plenty of GG EZ to be made.
---
thats the corrupted monk from sekiro
---
&gt;Still just genuinely confused as to why I'm being personally attacked
---
For a) being oblivious to the joke and then b) doubling down
