So from your context I guess it was the pig who said this? Because then she's just mad because of you denying the RBT activating
---
---
---
No real unique designs that couldn't just be a cosmetic for other killers. Also Stranger Things is the bigger property that would get more attention if a chapter was announced
---
It doesn‚Äôt let you get. This game is still in beta, so you‚Äôd really need experience with the non-beta game versions.
---
Yeah she was real mean lol. But it‚Äôs like, why does the RBT matter if she‚Äôs just gonna camp the hook?
---
It says it is installed
---
Because he excels at tracking, not chasing.
---
If you don't realise that you chase for too long, you are bad at this game.
---
They're not always going to be around loops. Catch them in unfavorable positions, chase them down. Track them down.
---

---
Doc is only good with right addons and perks. And in good hands.
---
I'm prestiging my pig at the moment, so I'm using up all my mori's. I set the rule for myself to only mori people on last hook or when everyone is about to die anyways... earlier today, a Nea made me break my own rules...
---
Damn.. you got messages from upset people too? I didnt know so many take this game that serious. (In a sentence of ranting on other players by their choices). Tbh, I also wanna learn everything about this game. I like it so much. üòä
---
I won't. Atleast not until I am sure I can do it! üòä
---
I get what you're saying but maybe a base common flashlight with no add ons shouldn't blind the killer that fast
---
My two favorites, awesome art!
---
Haha, I shouldve replied with that yes. And thank you. I'm enjoying it again! üòÅ
---
That‚Äôs why I would use thrilling tremors so that way I eliminate any chance of me accidentally teleporting to a gen that‚Äôs not being worked on
---
Lmao I love seeing all the I instas the survivors wanted to use after the match as Plague
---
I'm pretty sure someone made a concept of that and posted it on this sub some time ago, seemed p nice.
---
maybe he quit dbd or life got in the way, i would try asking in there discord.
---
Why not just upload it to YouTube?
---
Jeez.. I don't even know why people take the time to messages other players just to "rant". It makes it less fun. But you are right. If it ever happens again, I'll ignore. ü§ó
---
Well if that happens you won't be right back online waiting to join a game. All it takes is paying a little attention to your latency in the lobby. Bounces all around ya back out and find a new one.
---
Woowwww.. reported for? Damn. People get really salty on this game. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Laurie and Quentin look nowhere close to their original characters lmao.I dunno who modeled these survivors but that dude/dudette needs to get their vision fixed
---
It worked! Thank you. It's in account management.
---
Oh yeah I'd much rather have Stranger Things by a long shot. I was just saying that's another on-theme option Netflix has
---
I'm mostly looking forward to Pop Goes The Weasel. Hook someone, see which gen is being worked on with BBQ and/or thrilling tremors, teleport over there to scare them off, and kick the gen to activate Pop Goes The Weasel.
---
I thought that was avgn for a sec
---
Oh shit yeah
---
I will kill these survivors, but first let me consult the flowchart.
---
Solved
---
I want to have an actual discussion about this topic as I see it brought up super often and the people involved usually just avoid the questions and go to insults, so...
---
If I understand you correctly then you think that NOED is a "Crutch perk" meaning that killers who use it lack skill in a majority of the game and rely on that perk **heavily** to make sure that they have massively better results by the end of the game.
---
If I'm correct in defining "Crutch perk", why do you think that NOED is a crutch perk?
---
u tried, which is the most important part
---
Just take your death like a reasonable person.   If you are worried about wasting a few precious seconds maybe don't game and go make something of them that matters.
---
It's not supposed to. They did not negotiate likenesses. So none of the killers can look like the originals either the actors or the models.
---
Swf
---
very true
---
Best part is, they did 2 generators I think all match. 3 people kept hook rushing and staying nearby (ffs, i got all 3 in the same room throughout the match).
---
Do you collide with air or just stop sprinting?
---
Buy one you can only get with real money you can buy most characters in game
---
I love when someone tries to heal me on the basement steps.
---
Another problem that I have is the ranking is garbage I constantly bounce between killer rank 10 and 9 because the survivors in 10 are super ez but I get trashed on by rank 9's and so I'm pretty much garenteed to win one round then lose another because I think I've reached my limit on skill
---
A+ thumb location.
---
!solved
---
ok. this is like such a dumb idea lol, who the fuck wouldn't trade going from healthy to wounded to save someone off a killers back. plus killers already have so many ways to get countered holding survivors anyway ie. decisive strike from a survivor u forgot u hooked and BT in general making some end games very frustrating if you dont play spirit huntress or leatherface, this is just trashy lmao
---
Highly recommend the perk hex:ruin, it‚Äôs a perk from the hag and once you hit a certain level (I believe 30) with her it will be teachable to all other killers. It slows down all gen repair speed and on good skill checks progress is halted. The only downside is that it‚Äôs a hex so it can be removed from the match via survivors cleansing the totem it‚Äôs rooted to. Even with that con It‚Äôs basically a must for high ranks and is never a bad pick for any build.
---
I love how big Herman is, lol.
---
How is this not at the top already?!
---
What do you mean, this clip was recorded today.
---
Majority of the killers are bought with IRL cash. And the ones that require auric (spelling?) cells are ones i dont want/have the sweetest hatred for.
---
Just play another game that you can pickup/putdown while you wait for lobbies and turn off mute focus (i play pokemon mmo myself)
---
If you‚Äôre queuing in green ranks there‚Äôs a decent chance that you‚Äôll be matched with browns for teammates. Maybe that‚Äôs the reason they‚Äôre getting bodied hard
---
Do what you want then I personally don‚Äôt like using  money on things I can get for free
---
Yeah! And if they send you a voice message, ignore it till the end üòÇ

Wait they can do that? Omg üòÇüòÇ
---
And only 5 of them you have to spend real money  on , Freddy Michael, the pig, bubba and ghostface  the rest you can get by just playing the game
---
I suppose the concern would depend on the ability of survivors to outwit Freddy‚Äôs new mind games and quicker teleportation.
---
If only this was a skin
---
She‚Äôs not an original character she came with the doctor DLC. 
---
Doctor DLC is included in the special edition, which is the only edition on console, but on PC you have to buy Doctor and Feng Min. 
---
Currently Jake and Wraith are the only original characters not included with mobile.
---
That‚Äôs insane! Is this on all systems?
---
Then you get someone like me who don't use the flashlight well and will probably trade it for anything in a chest and you waste the slot.
---
Flashlights used to insta blind. They‚Äôre fine now, I don‚Äôt know why you want to change them. The timing must be perfect to perform a flashlight save.
---
How do you control her blink?
---
How do you know where you'll teleport to? How do you controls her distance? How in the he'll can you control multiple chained blinks?
---
The teeth kind of makes it look like the Toy Soldiers Unite logo
---
High sensitivity and a lot of practice
---
Awwww super cool! I love that ghostboi is peaking from the doorway :D
---
What I was asking is, if I die FULLY before anyone else, do I have to sit and spectate them for another 15-20 minutes or am I free to leave when I hit the postgame lobby when I die?  15-20 minutes is a little but more than a few precious seconds, you condesencing prick.
---
Not allowed to use Michael with his see everyone add-on.  Otherwise it's whatever
---
I think a good balance to NOED would be
---
1. Totem counter beside the gen counter.
---
2. As someone else said, letting us know we're exposed before someone is hit, like Haunted Ground.
---
Lol it isn't dumb. Idk.
---
Isn't it kinda creepy to anyone else that when something with a little skin or ass is in a post, you start to see users you've never seen before in the comments? Or is it just me?
---
Surprise: NOED
---
Hell even getting dropped by the game itself causes you to lose pips.
---
If you‚Äôre going to play a killer that can be looped (most of them), then some good perks will be; 
---
brutal strength (break pallets quicker: Trapper - level 35), enduring (reduce pallet stuns: Hillbilly - level 30), and whenever you can get the clown, bamboozle (vault windows faster and block off that window for some time: Clown - level 30.)
---
Some that are good no matter who you‚Äôre playing (some perks have a few exceptions) are;
---
Monitor and abuse (smaller terror radius and fov when out of chase, bigger terror radius and normal fov when in chase: Doctor - level 35 (Not good on Doctor himself, you want a big terror radius, and doesn‚Äôt affect Huntress‚Äôs humming)), shadowborn (larger fov at all times: Wraith - level 40), and, once again when you can get the clown, Pop goes the weasel (after hooking a survivor, next gen you kick loses a quarter of its progression: Clown - level 40), You already know about hex: ruin and BBQ and chili, and I would recommend getting the clown if you‚Äôre just going for perks since he has two very good ones.
---
How will this destroy SWF?
---
Your version 9/10. Their version 6/10.
---
I don‚Äôt have an account.
---
balanced landing or adrenawin instead of breakdown
---
Are red rarity mystery boxes only these splinters?
---
Bingo. Sorry, but if I don't feel like going against the 3rd hag in a row then I will get out of the game one way or another.
---
It's free to sign up.
---
Because you can be good enough to do it and still win the game. It's possible. 
---
The chart is a great strategy don't get me wrong. It's just made for low experienced killers.
---
I hope mobile gets their own sub.
---
FIRMLY GRASP IT.
---
Yes, I am aware. But I don‚Äôt want to have an account.
---
Yeah! I got one when I played Wraith one and was accused by someone in a SWF for camping. When really, the Claudette I had nabbed the first time and hooked, I left for a while to check on the other gens. When the bar went halfway, I went to check if anyone was going to save her and her friend was doing just that.
---
No Auras, No Moris
---
People who act like that deserve to be camped. I'd be sure to Mori him or something in all subsequent matches I find him in.
---
He a Twitch streamer? If he is the rage during the stream must be off the charts.
---
Oh well enjoy your USB stick process then.
---
Thank you.
---
I am a prick yes. Nice of you to notice. You are a fuckin moron if you think leaving the game because you are dead via clicking the leave button is the same thing as pulling your ethernet cord. you certainly put the re before the tard.
---
Lucky boii, 4 Claud‚Äôs rarely die, or just get found
---
Proof?
---
Pretty much. Once I hit that high queue limit, I will just load up Dying Light or play a game on the Switch until the queue time drops.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Not to mention staying in games decreases your queue times. So it won't really deter me from leaving unfun games since I don't do it often anyway.
---
Look at a wall while picking up, look up to avoid flashlights.
---
Iron Will is necessary because the build wont work otherwise if you‚Äôre injured.
---
PC: Plant Boi
---
Rank 12 survivor, but always lookin for more buds to play with, and muck around in KYF hmu yalls
---
Stalk the ghostface
---
Shit players use it and shit survivors cry about it. 
---
Thats all it is.
---
These are interesting. Not a huge fan of Sorority Row but I like this concept.
---
It‚Äôs not that difficult all you gotta do is wiggle ur analog stick at a angle
---
Maybe it refers to how the killers are hollow shells of what they were in the mortal realm. Doesn‚Äôt the entity rob them of all their hope and then turn them into killers? I haven‚Äôt read the lore in over a year but I remember something like that
---
Sounds cool. Any tips for a fellow console player who's trying to learn her?
---
Wow, looks like that was hard!
---
It literally works like that when I played today so... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Depends on the amount of total survivors left. 3-4 yes, 1-2 no.
---
If you read the text it says players, not survivors only. The specific point out for SWF was to state that your SWF can't find a game until everyone is off cd. This has no bearing on killers because killers can only lobby solo.
---
So unless you no longer think killers count as players I really do not understand your comment.
---
Folks don't like Urban Evasion? Why is that?
---
Thank you a lot. One question: should I get the Clown before Leatherface, then?
---
Thank god for the circle and arrow, id be so fckn lost rn.
---
Ye it is, you just got to spend a lot of time practicing it!
---
Thank you so much! That means a lot considering the fact that I worked on it and my other fan concepts aren‚Äôt that good.
---
It's very useful when you're trying to distract the killer for a moment esp when they're chasing the obsession with dying light
---
Huntress sounds like she's going to pick up the damn pallet and chuck it at the survivor
---
Photo Credit goes to Dwight, also in his natural habitat.
---
The only reason I say it's detrimental is because it reduces the amount of invincibility someone has coming off the hook. But in all honesty you're probably right. I just think that it should be a bit more exciting is all. Unhooking already takes a relatively short amount of time anyways.
---
SWF.
---
I agree with this as well. I think adding both would be something to consider.
---
No Moris, Mori perks, or Mori add ons. 
---
No keys. 
---
Killer gets to choose the map because they are the ones who chased the survivors form the campfire into the playground of their choice. If killer doesn‚Äôt want a particular map, they forgot the choice to the survivors. 
---
No one likes being insta killed or insta escaped on in KYF. Lack of mori‚Äôs reduces chance for toxic game play on both killer and survivor side. Lack of keys gives the killer a better chance overall. Only time a key can be used is if it‚Äôs found in a chest, so we usually also ban Ace In The Hole by default.
---
It's lame when people try to tell you how to play tbh. Unless they are trying to help you get better ofcourse. That's a different story.
---
Shock the Doctor
---
No. He was updated to be less annoying and exploity but was compensated well enough like having 115% movespeed now
---
Yup. Play how you want, either seriously or memey, just have fun : D
---
Oh, I know all too well :(
---
YYOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I saw you guys and I took a picture with y‚Äôall
---
üòä Couldnt agree more!
---
Just chucks them in there and the entity eats them or smth
---
Combining it with We'll Make It is a good idea. 
---
With that being said, the power role comparison isn't really a fair one. A perkless killer should always be more powerful than a perkless survivor. The important thing is that those perks scale up correctly. That way, in the end, a killer with perks will be more powerful than a perked survivor on the same ratio as perkless killer : perkless survivor. It doesn't make sense for killers to get even stronger than they already are as they get more perks (in comparison to survivors).
---
But this is not the Silent build, this is the Vault and Vanish build. You vault, get to the other side of the map without leaving any trace. Also on console there are not as many headphone users as PC, I would say Iron Will for PC and Lightweight for console.
---
Anyway this build gets boring very quick.
---
Eat the hag. Wait no that‚Äôs grose

---
As u/MrSunBro said, they only go to three. It's worth noting that the rarity difference between perks doesn't really mean anything other than the supposed likelihood of getting them to appear in the bloodweb.
---
I'm glad I could help! Have fun, I love the shattered bloodline DLC because spirit is my favorite killer to play.
---
In my honest opinion, as someone who has never watched the show and loves dead by daylight, I feel like people are WAY over speculating this. Like on the surface it would be cool I guess, but you guys might be hyping yourselves up for nothing. But, considering the partnering with Netflix, AND this (I thought it was bullshit at first but listening to it I get it a lot) I'm just going to say, as an outsider, I would NOT be surprised if they did do something like this, being real tho, Stranger Things is huge, so getting the rights to that could be seriously hard, like SERIOUSLY hard. This is an ongoing and changing series, unlike the franchise's such as Michael Myers and Ghost face and such. So in the end, I wouldnt be surprised in either outcome
---
I‚Äôm just wondering the point of punishing dcs when they aren‚Äôt punishing killing yourself purposely on hook which is basically the same thing and will just take DCing‚Äôs place
---
I have been playing for 2 days now. There are some bug and unfinished ui functions but over I am having fun. 
---
I think they are definitely on to a good approach. I will answer anything I can about the 3.0.1 beta build based on my experience and would like to discuss the game with others playing it.
---
Ewwwww legion
---
When you are a pro photographer üî•
---
If a survivor is a good sport I let them escape
---
Encountered this on Xbox as well multiple times
---
"I have 5 tokens on Autodidact you potato, let me rub your back!!!"
---
Not even a proper hardcore squadette. It's like they're playing at it. Amateurs.
---
Wraith: ‚Ä¢O‚Ä¢
---
It‚Äôs been speculated that some killers may have been survivors at some point as, yes, The Entity is harvesting survivors for hope, but as if yet we are to see a killer who was once a survivor. Additionally, every killer added since release has simply been ‚Äúcollected‚Äù by The Entity.
---
This could just be a case of outdated lore. Maybe we‚Äôll get a killer who was once a survivor eventually.
---
if a there is a last survivor and they go to gates i normally just down them like 3 times and wait til its near the end game timer then let them get out really scares the shit out of them every time
---
The stalk thing was once you were fully exposed, Ghostface could continue to stalk you to "top off" the red exposed timer and basically extend the duration.
---
99ing people like Myers I am not sure if it's a intentional or not. Do note hitting them resets their stalk progress if they were not exposed.
---
Thanks! I was working with just the model they had used, so I couldn‚Äôt add any extra geometry to change up some of the more drastic details. For instance, Michael‚Äôs signature puffy cheek creases are very subtle on the game model but almost comically overstated on the real thing, but the geometry wasn‚Äôt complex enough to let me sculpt that in so I had to make do with the mesh at hand. I think I improved it though
---
And survivors can be good enough to escape without going down. I've never seen somebody go to deathhook just to prove that point though.
---
Unbreakable instead of BT is good. Counters slugging which just so happens to be D strikes counter.
---
Neat idea! Personally I think Vigorous is pretty OP because even at rank 1 you're outrunning all 110% killers and with a bonus 12% to your usual speed just about every loop is now an infinite.
---
They weren't good at it. I kept marking them, and spotting them in stalking ez
---
Have you tried looking up?
---
You can get Clown with iridescent shards, but you have to pay for leatherface, but I would still recommend Leatherface if you were going to choose instead of getting both, because BBQ and chili is just that good of a perk.
---
Bricky gang rise up.
---
Real Leatherface players use a basement build and camp down there.
---
This is a baby Leatherface.
---
Before I lower it, I wanted to ask a question. Aren‚Äôt the Nurse, Spirit, and Hag the only one with 110? Or am I forgetting one?
---
Yeah maybe in black ops but prestiging even in cod used to mean losing everything. Not carrying over your strongest item or perk etc. Prestiging is meant to reset. You get a chance to build up again from scratch. The cosmetic is just a bonus.
---
cursed image
---
How‚Äôs the controls are they good or bad
---
200 IQ play right there.
---
Nice.
---
Look up ASAP, it always works for me. Or try to face against a wall if available.
---
If you notice they are SWF, be extra careful
---
Teabagging is toxic.
---
Well the streaks on the corners of the screen from frenzy are there after the hit. But the power itself ended. Either way that match happened today.
---
Thank you for the clarification. Also, do you know if it was mentioned somewhere in the lore that the entity tortured killers until they submit? I vaguely remember someone telling me that was why the trapper was so mangled.
---
Me: I don‚Äôt get it what do axes and cleavers have to do with written exa- OH they‚Äôre pens!
---
How good does it run on mobile?
---
In the "Note:" section I left the order. For medkits with instaheal or toolboxes with any addon that would reduce charges, put the addon that reduces charges first. Say you have a medkit with 16 charges and you put on an anti hemmorhagic syringe. This reduces those 16 charges by 50%. Now you have 8 charges. THEN you put on an addon that increases charges by lets sayyyy uhhhh 12. Now you have 20 charges. If you were to do the plus 12 first, you would have 28 charges, then put the syringe and you are left with 14. Of you put the charge reducing addon first, THEN an addon that adds charges, the addon will only remove the items BASE CHARGES and the bonus addon charges will not be effected and will be added normally. This means if you put the reduce addon first and the add addon second, you'll be left with the most charges possible.
---
I might also make a guide for toolboxes and med kits later on down the line.
---
Aw, Stake Out is like my favorite perk.

It does not make a difference with total length of use actually. That's why I put them together. With the same addons, the standard flashlight and the sports flashlight will last the same amount of time.
---
Interactions are very intuitive and the revamped skill checks are actually pretty cool.
---
Movement control is where things get weird. For survivors it is not a big issue. You get a neat "rear view" button which is handy. Killers on the other hand. Unfortunately as you move with the left thumb and move your camera with your right which is also where your attack button is. The creates situations where you have to stop turning your camera to attack........during a loop.
---
Lucky the game does have an aim assist which makes it actually possible to connect hits in chase. 
---
Don't even ask about Billy. I have no idea how anyone will be able to control him or nurse.
---
You're a lucky man

Huntress too I'm pretty sure.

Freddy mains are very hyped. Most of us anyway.

Detective Tapp too. Im wondering how much was a likeness issue more than the character rights then. Can't use Danny Glover's face so well make up similar...

Description: Thrill of the Hunt isn't working as intended. One of the perk's effects is "gain a notification when someone starts working on a Hex totem." This has never happened to me. I get an alert when the totem is destroyed, but when someone is cleansing the totem it doesn't even get highlighted.
---
Flashlight saves are much more difficult to explain through text but I did give it a try in the "P.P.P.S" section. I'll update it.
---
Bing your bong on Philip
---
T bagging at the other side of pallets/exit gate/infinites are toxic
---
But t bagging before a pallet to get a killer to follow them is at most taunting. There is much more toxic stuff out there.
---
Best generator in the game &lt;3
---
Huntress and Tier 1 Meyers I believe. Plus there's also Doc in Treatment Mode
---
Fake a pickup, look up or down, use Franklin's demise or lightborn

Flashlights are not op by any extension
---
He was always a bit inconsistent since his videos take a lot of time. I also hope he comes back
---
Nope, it was perfect!
---
And myc
---
I had a match recently that lasted maybe a minute. Ghostface found 2 survivors and downed 1. Left to find the other and downed him nearby where the 1st had crawled. It was clear the killer couldn't find the 1st downed survivor, and was running all over the place in one loop area. I saw the other safe survivor nearby, so I tried to draw the killer out so he could save 1 or 2. Dude just watched Ghostface chase me around and down me. THEN he went in to save the survivors. He got downed as well. I just had to laugh. Killer didn't even have to look for anybody after finding the first 2.
---
That looks so much like a swf team unless it was just by coincidence.

SWF really get you down I think. GG on the 4k though!

---
Yeah. They kept sabotaging hooks when i got near them. Then i would get punished if I slugged.
---
Honestly I'm not sure how I would feel like they released some Stranger Things based killer just because it's popular right now and not a true horror icon like Pinhead or Candyman.
---
ghostface for sure, I do highly recommend running discordance on him it's really good for his power
---
Really? I swear legion was some like insanely hard to counter killer but then again I don‚Äôt fully understand his power.
---
I beg your forgiveness!
---
One of the biggest things a killer can have is a way to end the chase fast, legion does not have that       Legion is only viable with certain builds that can make his power somewhat useful like stbfl 
---
He‚Äôs good at finding people and/or injuring but that‚Äôs about it 
---
Ghost face can expose multiple people and end the chase with a single hit
---
Jeff mains are honestly some of the most altruistic teammates I've had on PS4, I've never had a Jeff not try to defend their teammates/me. I had a Freddy tunnel the hell out of me and camp the hook with insidious, and this Jeff tried so hard to keep him away from me.
---
I don't like tunneling or camping cause I think it makes the game cheap on both ends, but being toxic or shitty to the killer really doesn't solve anything.
---
So just to clarify once someone is exposed they are a one hit?
---
Vigorous would probably make you invincible against 80% of killers lol
---
thx u bro like the community already
---
K.
---
Yes exposed effect is 1 hit down
---
The effect lasts 45 seconds but can be done over and over
---
Addons is up to personal choice.
---
As for builds I like to run : 
---
Distressing : Having a bigger terror radius is very good on Doc. It also makes you a BP farming machine.
---
Unnerving Presence : Makes skill checks smaller within your terror radius. Goes hand in hand with Distressing since it increases your terror radius size.
---
Nurse's Calling : Reveals healing survivors, which includes survivors doing the 'Snap out of it' action. Very useful regardless.
---
For the last perk you could use :
---
Hex : Ruin : I've found this one goes very nicely with Distressing+Unnerving. Makes the Ruin skillchecks even harder.
---
OR
---
Coulrophobia : Gives a huge debuff to healing speed withing your terror radius. Again, pairs well with Distressing. Slower yealing slower gives you more times to find them with Nurse's. Remember that Coulrophobia *does not* work on 'Snap Out Of It' though.
---
So essentially ghost face is a mix of pig and Michael but is better than Michael
---
It is only officely available in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. A Google/youtube search may find you some "alternative resources" ;)
---
Are you literally that picky? Like nice job but it was close enough!
---
This bloodweb better or worse do you think? 
---
Does it work the same with perks?
---
Pretty much
---
Michael is better in some situations and ghost is better in others
---
But ghost face is pigs and michaels kid basically
---
I already have Michael and I know how to use him fairly well so i hopefully should be able to use ghost face
---
Nice
---
Thank you, honest help
---
Thanks
---
I strategy I like to use is to down a survivor, stand over them like your about to pick them up, and then wait for the one with the flashlight to come sprinting towards you to blind you. You'll almost always get a hit on the flashlight survivor.
---
Who hurt you?
---
No. You get unsafe unhook if the unhooked is downed within 10 seconds of the unhook.
---
Bullshit, man. I play games all the time where the killer disconnects after a lengthy game and I don't get shit for bloodpoints. But killers get extra bloodpoints. So lame
---
yes,  legion is good at slowing the game down tho.. with nurses calling, monitor and abuse and discordance you have a good build ; Its just very situational tho
---
everytime I read this i still hear it multiple times lol
---
I think you might have meant to post this on a war hammer 40k sub
---
I‚Äôm betting on just a map of based on a location from Stranger Things or maybe a Survivor. I highly doubt we‚Äôll get a Killer unless it‚Äôs Billy with Exploding Rats and basement abilities lol.
---
The only thing that‚Äôs throwing me off is the hood, great cosplay nonetheless
---
I still believe the 2.7.0 sound files that were found were place holder sfx for Ghostface that the Devs werent sure about yet, one of them sounds like the stalking muffle, the other when you get exposed, the other being the subtle music you get when you get exposed and the other for when Ghostface went into stealth, one for when you trigger exposed on someone and finally one for when they outlive the exposed effect, but thats just me and I always enjoy speculation on new content
---
I love this meme. I read it in their voices and it was 100% times better.
---
Nah, its your survival first. If you think there's a risk, unless you are good and you know the killer doesnt have NOED (or any exposed perks) then yeah go for it.
---
But like its a humanoid you k? Idk i see what u mean tho
---
... possibly
---
Alright, thank you. One more thing: should I go for LV 40 Hag and keep Doc and Nurse where they are or do something else?
---
Is the difference in rank based on color a visible difference?
---
Tis what I play on and I can agree wholeheartedly. Never find lobbies with people who do the team thing. If they aren't DCing early, they're leaving you on a hook or can't escape the killer for shit. Buncha ragamuffins
---
No. The swf doing a sabo build.

I was having similar issues with killer and couldent see auras I think its an xbox/console bug, I was also playing on xbox
---
I am all for this idea, but considering BHVRs history and how different dedicated servers are going to work compared to the current system I think there needs to be a delay in adding this lockout.
---
Imagine they drop the dedicated servers with this enabled day one, and due to some BHVR magic you drop out of every other game due to network issues. If you risk playing again after the lockout timer ramps up and up, if you give up then you miss out playing until they fix it, which could be a while.
---
killers can always get me down cuz i always go for that one
---
tOxIC sWF oMg
---
We just had one, so we wont have another for a few months.
---
They haven‚Äôt given a specific date but it won‚Äôt be for a while considering we just had one last month
---
Ok sorryyy. Did not know that. But i read through it and its actually really good. Seems fairly balanced.
---
Gotta love teammates. Am I right?
---
Not really possible. If you have the game "detect" leave buttons and alt+f4s people will just pull cables to seem like an unintentional disconnect and receive no penalty.
---
i mean, i wouldn‚Äôt mind that either but they‚Äôd best watch how much they boost the BP gain anyway. you don‚Äôt want to actually make gen rushing worthwhile
---
I only had to look for 1 survivor my whole game, felt kinda bad for hooking him but I was in the zone. Poor guy was doing gens while the rest derped out. Best part, the last survivor literally did nothing all game other than 1 HORRIBLE unhook (I had just turned around to leave) t-bagged at the hatch. I always hate people that do that after doing next to nothing useful all game
---
That must have been fun walking down the street.
---
I would totally buy this immediately. I LOVE this theme so much.
---
Bond over it
---
They lose BP, 10-15 mins of their lives and their items. It will help a bit I think
---
Huh, steam sale doesn't actually include ghost face. How nice of him
---
Feel like the survivor should be dead. Like Barb or 
---
**(SPOILERS DONT READ AHEAD OF THIS TEXT)** hopper
---
If the killer dipped and leaves you alone yeah I dont really blame you, if killer is facecamping get the struggle points and leave the rest with time to do gens. Hell, if I'm almost done with a gen I wont leave it to go save someone. I'll finish first, then get the unhook

Ando you still manage to get 4k and with 2 reds. Whoa you felt bullied but they got rekt
---
Killers face the same thing though.  Destroying a team is not the same as overcoming a skilles team on even footing.  The same as you 3 talking on comms and obviously being able to gen rush to victory is not the samw as facing a killer on even footing and actually being challenged.  If I go beat the fuck out of some Kindergarteners I'm not gonna be hailed as a boxing champ.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs supposed to mean that solo survivors are left until the last moment as there is no worry, they aren‚Äôt my friend
---
That perfectly understandable, and I support your decision to leave the game.
---
Now, why don't you do everyone a favor, and *stay* out? At least until you've grown up and accepted that you're not always gonna get what you want.
---
I think noed is a crutch perk because of the one shot capability, I‚Äôve only ever seen noed be run when the killer is unable to sacrifice any of the survivors. I‚Äôm a killer/survivor main and have experienced both sides of the spectrum, it is super easy to kill the noed, while also making you rage as a survivor. You can hardly know if a killer has noed unless one of their perks are unknown.
---
As I said, I play both killer and survivor, and yes I try to the best of my ability to cleanse totems, but that is when I can find them. I am somewhat new to this game and do not know where the totems can spawn exactly
---
Calm down you two, where would I be without my thick skin. I can take it, and you know what? I DID TRY AGAIN. And I'll keep trying until I strike something good. Those last ideas were weak (especially Stage Dive good god) but I've got a new batch for the DBD community to poke and prod at. It's a killer this time though, sorry ya'll. But I will redeem Mr. Eric Quinn, just you wait.
---
I was playing DBD with a friend the other day. He doesn't play the game very much at all so he sits at about rank 15 he plays so little that he never gets further than that before rank reset. While playing against Ghost face he got 1 shot during chase and asked me how long the exposed lasts. I told him 45 seconds an he replied "what the fuck? it should only be like 15 seconds" and at that moment I thought to my self, these must be the kinds of people that the devs balance the game around....
---
Small Game is a good crutch perk for learning where the totems spawn.
---
facts then they thinking they can loop you until you come with that side lunge
---
Are we sure about this? I know for sure I have gotten safe hooks before while I heard the terror radius. So this can‚Äôt be true. I think its when the unhooked survivor goes down...meaning this perk literally encourages killers to tunnel for it to activate.
---
That has nothing to do with my question. If a killer depipped from Survivors DCing it would also be bullshit. But the fact we were in SWF is irrelevant to me losing rank for a killer choosing to quit.
---
Ok? Good for you?
---
Because not sprinting is a waste of time.
---
No insta kills, no dull or skeleton keys, and no perks that influence toxic play unless they are used strictly for meming.

I wish these mobile post were more appreciated

Lol that other guy was right. You are an asshole.
---
Yeah forget about that guy. Some people would just rather be negative.
---
And then you have some other ones that are so hard to complete in 1 go: teleport and hit 4 survivors with hag, hit 4 survivors during post phasewalk state as spirit and catch 3 survivors in bear traps as trapper, are the ones I have the hardest time with. Only time I can complete them in 1 go is in a farming match
---
You mentioned Tru3, hate boners incoming
---
Jump into a locker if you can't get away while d strike is active. No more slugging.
---
I had a game the other day with a Bubba, and the way it worked was just such bullshit. I vaulted a window previously while he was chainsawing, he doesn't get the hit and ends up just doing his tantrum on the otherside. Makes sense that he was not able to get the hit because I was already through the window and a little bit aways. Next time he's after me I vault again, he's chainsawing, same circumstance, I'm already through the window I should not be hit. I get instadowned and Bubba is on the other side of the window throwing his tantrum.
---
The way I feel like they should work is that: Starting vault/in the middle of the vault you should be hit or grabbed out, that makes sense to me. If you have already finished the vault and you are starting to run then you should not be hit. It doesn't make sense for a Legion or a Ghostface to be able to hit be through a window when I am a gap away from the window.
---
Pallets should automatically stop hits or stop a chainsaw from hitting you, it makes no sense for the chainsaw to be able to down you, break the pallet, and also stun the killer.
---
Never came across a doctor doing this, but I did do it myself
---
I dont see how. Youre the one who brought up a day old convo, expecting me to say something else. If you had tough skin you would have just went on with you day. So i say again Ok? Good for you? No one cares.
---
Ptb is in a few weeks
---
A lot of killers feel games go too fast at red ranks and will generally try to kill one survivor as soon as possible.
---
"Be grateful" is the wrong way to phrase it. I congratulate them on implementing this feature, and I'm glad they are. But after three years of games constantly being ruined, because they never implemented a feature that any online game needs *on launch*, we've earned the right to be cranky about it.
---
Thank you for the constructive discussion.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ca1u7s/dx11_error/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Sounds like a normal Friday. Next time let them watch you teabag while they are hooked and get a hatch escape.
---
Yeah she‚Äôs actually the entity, it‚Äôs an Easter egg.
---
The one shot capability, and the speed bonus for that matter, can both be prevented by cleansing the dull totems. You may not want to spend the timing clearing the totems but it has to be done.
---
People see NOED as a perk used to get easy kills at the end of the game when in reality its a perk used to slow the game down, similar to ruin. As the game is currently survivors can do gens extremely fast. Which is why people usually bring ruin, which can be worked through if you are good at hitting great skill checks. NOED gives the survivors a choice, clear out all of the dull totems or risk activating NOED.
---
I have also seen the excuse that you don't know if the killer is running NOED. If you are not sure if the killer is using NOED then clear all the dull totems anyway, unless you can confirm that the killer has 4 different perks before you break all the dull totems. Some people say it takes a really long time to break all of the totems and they are right. You know what else takes a really long time? Hitting and downing multiple survivors, picking them up, bringing them to a hook, searching for other survivors, and chasing around loops. Survivors want to be able to gen rush and just win but NOED helps bring the time management to a balance on both sides. You can even bring in small game to help find the totems but if you don't want to use your time to break totems and you just always want to gamble on the killer not having NOED then I don't think you have any right to criticize it.
---
Personally I don't think it would be a bad idea to add a global audio indication when ALL totems have been broken so that even a team of solo survivors can know when 5 totems have been broken. I understand having all 4 survivors searching for every spot to make sure all the totems are broken because they can't communicate that they broke X amount of totems would be too time consuming.
---
Yeah, they just got hooked. 3 survivors on a gen is at most 33 seconds (no misses). That hook state is 60 seconds.
---
Makes sense to me that they would rush out that gen first
---
If you wanna turn play bubba
---
Did they just let you die through 2 hook states?
---
Nope, paid for the game too. Its not a competitive game by any means so I will not treat it like CSGO, Dota, or League of Legends. I play the game purely to have fun. If a game is going to be boring and/or miserable then I will move onto the next one. I find like 95% of games to be fun. I don't care if get downed first nor die first. That doesn't determine if its a fun game.
---
As I stated in another post, I rarely leave games. However, decent iri head huntress? Next game. Insidious basement camping leatherface? Next game. Freddy/Hag (two killers I loath playing against) for the 3rd game in a row? Next game. Freddy/hag for the 2nd game in a row on a map I hate (grim pantries maps or hospital)? Next game. That's a pretty specific list to make me want to go to next game, so again it doesn't happen very often.
---
Yeah most streamers I've played with/against have been huge jerks. It wouldn't be a problem if they just played normally but it seems like they go out of their way to bait reactions or play selfishly.
---
Hell yeah! This game is fun as fuck
---
Odd bulb is useless
---
True ! But don‚Äôt post their twitch names because nobody wants them to get views tbh
---
Thanks lad, I'll take notes and try to improve!
---
I have seen people define camping pretty inconsistently in this game online so how would you define camping?  To me its when the killer is within a few meters of the survivor on the hook without leaving at all.  I feel it is perfectly viable if the survivor team has repeatedly shown they are overly altruistic and the killer hides within eyesight but farther away waiting to down either the rescuer or the victim as they are simply reacting to how the survivors are playing.  
---
I only got into the game about four days ago and am rank 13 as a survivor and have played the killer 4 times with 3 kills at least per match and never found camping/tunneling to be a viable strategy for the killer on either side (I would just down, hook, set a trap nearby, and then go find another survivor to hunt while playing hag so I was never fully camping but ready for when they go for the rescue).  Like whenever I see the killer employ those strategies the other survivors typically work on gens and almost everyone escapes except for one person which is  a major drawback for points and winning the game on killer's end.
---
In your games at that higher rank has the killer usually come out on top while camping/tunneling or has it adversely affected them and allowed your teammates to benefit and "win" the round?
---
Trrooooooonnnn FACE my dude
---
You didn't specify that it was on the first hook. The way you phrased it was misleading.
---
Okay? Its a corporate decision and requested by many. Pull up your panties and live with it
---
True. Instant downvotes and losing all credibility in whatever I just said.
---
I have been successful with the Plague as well stacking Devour Hope. I used addons that sped up the infection rate to one hit them once broken. It was more efficient with normal puke that I never used corrupted puke to notice this.

the ritual to sabotage two hooks is broken as of right now. I completed it and was not rewarded any bloods points from it.
---
He's really not that bad to play against normally. A skilled killer is a skilled killer regardless. If you don't like him or feel bad using him just play enough to get BBQ&amp;C sharable and drop him. When it comes to people complaining about killers he's not usually near the top of the list.
---
People hate the cannibal for one reason the chainsaw is stupid as hell and very powerful. Every cannibal runs and basically hugs you then starts their chainsaw that‚Äôs why people hate him
---
Literally üòÇ he just sounds so annoyed when he gets stunned
---
No because they would tweak that mechanic most likely. It's considered an unsafe unhook and a dick move to unhook someone in The Killers Terror radius. Or if the killer can see you. Much like borrowed time I'm sure that's how it would activate.
---
It should legit just be a close-range make your choice. Equally situational.
---
Anyone with a brain would choose to instadown a fully healthy Survivor over someone who just got off the hook and might have DS.
---
Plus it would punish those greedy overly altruistic survivors who Farm their teammates off the hook while in the heartbeat.
---
If you can't tell how needlessly abrasive and confrontational you're tone is and has been since you joined this thread, than it only proves my point. And I'll bring up a year old convo wtf it's my content. Don't like it, go troll someone else. And you obviously cared enough to respond. You have this undying need to place others beneath you in this subtle way, as if were all just a bunch of naiive dumbasses that simply aren't worth your time. And that's fine, but keep that toxic nonsense to yourself. There is literally no way to be friendly with someone like you, who take kindness and sincerity as something to be mocked or taken advantage of. All you've presented in your feedback for example, is a million reasons why an idea wouldn't work and why it is a foolish one, without giving the slightest thought about how it could work or affect gameplay. Please refrain from commenting on my next post if you truly don't care, and those that do, will. I would tell you to have a nice day, but you'd probably take it as sarcasm and a reason to badmouth me instead of talking to me like an equal. So, I'll just say peace.
---
Yeah but you can still do a generator or put up a good Chase and waste The Killers time. If you're decent at the game and it's anyone but nurse or Spirit you can probably survive.
---
Surviving isn't winning. Pipping is technically counted as winning and I'd rather die with 16k than escape with 10k.
---
Camping can mean staying next to the hook or going a few meters away and coming back (proxy camping). It usually happens from the start of the game. The people being camped and tunnels die of course but it‚Äôs annoying when it happens most games to you. At lower ranks it‚Äôs not a problem. But try being a higher rank and you‚Äôll see what I mean.
---
I know that. That's a literal unsafe unhook. That's when you lose points in the emblem system. I'm saying it's a dick move and still technically and unsafe unhook if you unhook someone right in front of the killer or while in their heartbeat. Taking a hit is basically a must, to avoid tunneling. That's why I think this perk would be a good idea.
---
For some reason when I read your original post I missed the part about him disconnecting and while my original comment still applies, I also feel like the disconnect causing depips could be more easily fixed and I wish they would do that as well.
---
DUDE imagine if the Demogorgon has an ability to pull people into the upside down and traverse the upside down to pop up next to survivors. If someone gets pulled into the upside down they have to either escape or someone has to pull them out before they get attacked by the Mind Flayer.
---
&gt;quitting on first hook is shit, but if you reach phase 2 on first
---
What else could this mean
---
Same. Every time I lead the killer on a 3+ minute chase and I go down and see 3 people urbanly evading around the map, it's an insta suicide on hook. Dont care.
---
The Screwdriver one sounds cool but i thought Michael Myers was the one suspending people in the air with a kitchen Knife?
---
Well I don't blame Killers for quitting against much higher rank players. Can't be fun and most of the time they're in a survive with friends group and Bully the killer while carrying their team.
---
Although yeah I do think it's bullshit that sometimes you still depip when the killer quits, but then again the killer will be ranked if they don't get enough hooks. One Survivor dying on the first hook or attempting to escape will cost killer points and possibly stop them from getting merciless.
---
I'd argue that rage quitting affects both sides equally and for different reasons along with similar reasons. I'm glad to see something done about it. Although it's impossible for me to play a match as Survivor or Killer without someone on the Survivor side quitting
---
The fact that you even *have* a list of conditions is proof that you put a pedantic amount of thought into what you consider "fun". You're the kind of person that the phrase "You must be fun at parties" was invented for.
---
When you clicked the button to join the match, you agreed to everything that happens in that match, within the bounds of the rules. You don't get to go back and change what you agreed to when when it becomes inconvenient to you. That's not how life works. So either play a different game that you can more assuredly enjoy, or grow up.
---
No worries. I edited my statement as it was a bit rushed and didn't really explain my question. I do hope they fix this issue because whether you're a survivor or killer, someone disconnecting shouldn't damn you.
---
Yeah. I mean, I wasn't too mad because I'm used to it in solo in low ranks. Once you get into the purple ranks your survival rate is higher.
---
Tapp with vest = Altruistic
---
Tapp with Jacket/Suit = Gen Jockey
---
Don't disagree with anything you say here really. It does come down to the game though.
---
Reaching 2nd phase while people are popping gens, making use of the time you got chased and your first phase? I'll stay for that.
---
Reaching 2nd while watching one guy fail through ruin, another circle the map twice looking for it, and a third already in chase? Not worth wearing out my spacebar.
---
That honestly sounds about right. I don't think I've had a killer quit in two weeks. But I have a Survivor quit every other match. Especially when they're on my team and it's to the point where I stopped bringing items or offerings.
---
This is the problem. The devs appear to balance for their own skill level, which based on video I've seen, is between 10 and 20. They don't know the first thing about balancing for purple or red ranks.
---
PTB comes out this Tuesday
---
You sound like teen boy. I havent even been rude I've been honest. Seem like you cant handle when someone is critical of your work. I recomend you play the game more so you dont remake 2 perks in the game. I'd be a troll if I didnt give legitimate reasons behind my statement. Im not some kid who's gonna read this think wow Im wrong here and apologize when I've done nothing wrong. You thick skin must be paper thin all things considered. Try again.
---
Am I the only one who thinks they should remove the timer on hope, especially with the EGC?
---
At level 40 hag you get devour hope, which isn‚Äôt that good but is fun enough. Just level whoever you think you‚Äôll play, and if you want a specific perk than level that character up.
---
I think I'm going to dispute it. I have never insulted or trash talk to anyone in the post game chat. I don't even use add-ons as killer.
---
When I play Survivor I often die for my teammates or never insult the Killer. I usually just say good game and move on.
---
I've never used exploits glitches or hacks. My connection is consistently good. I have no idea what I could have done or what I've been reported for.
---
Honestly I think I played against too many salty survive with friends groups and they might have all given me unsportsmanlike reports or spam reported me. I've heard of that happening before
---
It‚Äôs relevant I‚Äôm a good spirit and swf is the WORST

Yes, you have to unlock it.
---
It will only turn back to normal once all of the fountains have been used by a survivor, so they‚Äôre all corrupted, that‚Äôs when they reset
---
The same reason we get depiped if we kill you too fast.
---
because the pip system is wrong. The idea behind is cool, but is not practical.  it wants killers playing around with survivors and survivors being chased, saving each other and such.
---
Did it work out well for you?
---
Oh yeah. If the teammates are legit idiots and not trying to save or they aren't doing generators. I don't think they're worth the time or effort.
---
If that's the case I'll totally give up on hook. Don't want to help those who aren't helping me or themselves.
---
Playing with friends is bad? How? I don't see how I'm in the wrong when I'm playing a game with friends.
---
You better post this on r/imsorryjon quick.
---
Cuz that works when you get Billy face camping or basement camping. Big risk to auto lose when you lose a second person because there is no way you get them out of the basement.
---
This picture makes me think skeleton doot but in reality the noise is actually that of jango fetus seismic charge
---
BHVR doesn‚Äôt have the license to his original outfit, just the mask
---
You seem like a baby who hates to lose.
---
ITS OUT?!
---
No bubba in DBD mobile. Unfortunately due to the current controls I don't know how Billy will be playable. Kinda interesting that mobile may create it's own meta.
---
Games are for fun, have fun either way you decide. If you want everyone to have fun then do you, Leatherboi or not.
---
&gt;If you're the first survivor to reach phase two
---
Your intent could have been very easily made obvious by saying
---
&gt;quitting on first hook is shit, but if you reach phase 2 on first hook, the game is over for you.
---
Instead, it sounded like
---
&gt;quitting on first hook is shit, but if you reach phase 2 first, the game is over for you.
---
Grammar is a fickle mistress.
---
Michael.
---
Hatch mechanics are entirely in Killer's favor and endgame in general now with EGC so kind of a weird angle to go for. Adrenaline doesn't one shot the exit gates and is only for 5 secs (plenty of time for any high mobility or one shot killers to catch up if in a chase but no counters lol) so no not the same at all.
---
Edit: So if someone gets downed by NOED everyone should just leave and let that be a free kill?
---
Where did the darn came from? I have listened to the audios but can't find it.
---
Denmark
---
This is the energy we need
---
Bastards lol. Too bad it didn't give em a win.
---
Unless the killer was camping that just sucks
---
My wife and I still do this :) you guys are cute.
---
Are you talking about Matt playing hag and getting bullied?
---
Good explanation, I understand completely how that was confusing. Will edit, thank you.
---
Doh... I got confused.
---
It's still a good perk on the Hag though
---
I originally saw the first 4 then started scrolling down to see next thing in my home, but suddenly shirtless myers...
---
You just don't listen to people.
---
Can you show it full?
---
Right....try again
---
This is exactly what my bf and I do. 
---
But we're a terrible team
---
Makes your phone use more data. Also puts you in roaming.
---
I know about that, but, as a low level player and as someone who devoted himself to play as Nurse at least a couple of times everyday, bloodpoints are a fairly lacking resource, that's why I want to have some priorities on who to level up first.
---
Nah he was [over here](https://i.imgur.com/NZrMA6C.jpg). I guess they were scared, new survivors seem to be scared of the Doc in particular.
---
Ah a fellow fedora man
---
I *think* Jason did that in the remake but I'm not sure
---
Just thought it'd be cool tho xD
---
That's definitely a big factor, which you really should have mentioned in your first post, since it completely changes the tone.
---
Even die-hard folk who never give up, occasionally have games where they know there's no chance of winning. We stick with 'em anyway, even though we've lost all hope in our teammates.
---
I‚Äôll be the one to make it complicated...
---
-Billy‚Äôs saw instantly activates when the gauge is full. However, Bubba‚Äôs saw can be activated as soon as you let go once it is full.
---
-Likewise, Bubba‚Äôs saw is only active for about 3.5 seconds or so before a short cooldown, while Billy‚Äôs lasts as long as you hold the power button.
---
-Billy‚Äôs saw can only hit one target at once, but Bubba‚Äôs can hit multiple within it‚Äôs duration.
---
-Billy has slightly longer range on his saw.
---
-Billy has a short fatigue when he bumps into an object during the saw, however Bubba has a much longer tantrum that allows him to still move but at a much slower speed. Survivors who touch him during this still get hit, though.
---
-Billy moves at effectively double speed while his saw is active, and at no cost to his movement. Bubba moves slightly slower when charging his saw, but has a kind of ‚ÄúAcceleration‚Äù that increases speed after each swing (Pretty sure it‚Äôs currently broken).
---
-Bubba‚Äôs saw makes a bit less noise and is not heard from as far as Billy‚Äôs is.
---
-Bubba has full control during his saw, while Billy can only stiffly turn to the right or left with no option to backpedal.
---
this is goals
---
I could not imagine walking barefoot around an expo, your man's is brave.
---
What‚Äôs the first letter of her twitch name :)
---
Its the only exposed perk that can be destroyed before activated. You get hit by noed, you deserve it. Cleanse totems and downvote.
---
Nice anime profile pic. Really bring out the badass in you!
---
Sl√°inte!
---
I like BBQ, Ruin, Unnerving Presence, Distressing
---
No I havnt played for a while and when I did I always thought tier 3 had a speed buff. It was my mistake I guess
---
This won‚Äôt kill the game and if we lose some players because they trash and wanna ruin other players games with a pussy DC, we ain‚Äôt losing much with them gone!
---
It sounds like you'd need one of those attachable controllers if you wanted to play even remotely as good as people on the other ports do. Though I imagine the mobile community will be a lot more casual so who knows if that will even be a problem.
---
Yes but at high ranks against good players playing strong killers, survivors don‚Äôt have time to find and cleanse up to 5 dull totems.
---
Pffft imagine not having a $1000 dollar gaming pc or a $300 dollar console to play a game, imagine using what you already have to play a game.
---
Blur out the names fam
---
If the killer is detected to have been inside of the middle of a pallets hitbox longer than 10 seconds, the pallet should be destroyed. Easy fix.
---
Why? We all escaped
---
I'm not calling anyone out D:
---
Her name starts with y she‚Äôs in rank 8 and on Xbox and live right now with a tiny amount of views
---
More people are playing killer on PS4 because of GF and it‚Äôs not so much of a grind fest, only downside is more campers and tunneling
---
Lmao. The Claudette is gold!
---
Do you have any links or queries one could search for?
---
Life Guard Billy
---
Weird, My chases go a lot like that, but imagine not being able to make it to the next looping spot because he‚Äôs too fast. That‚Äôs my experience lol
---
And if you call them out on it they call you salty.
---
Ah yes, Mr fetus.
---
I mean what did you expect from mobile
---
I hope that is not all you do ;) haha

Yeah, this community is trash. Evident by replies in this thread focusing on the same shit you get messaged about.

Just turn off the messages and play how you want, the game is great otherwise.
---
I‚Äôm in love with this game atm! I play on a 6s Plus and it runs SO smooth for what i‚Äôm used to on my phone (always at 30fps) I love the new bloodmarket system and the character progression system. Instead of hoarding bp to level up a character just to get their teachables, you actually have to play as them in order to unlock them! I‚Äôve had a P3 lvl 50 dwight on my Ps4 for about 4 months and I use a good amount of items but on my phone in the 2 days I‚Äôve been playing on my phone. I already have 20 yellow flashlight and 12 sport flashlight. 14 syringes (you cant use them yet but still) 9 syptics. 19 yellow medkits, 8 green medkits and 4 purple medkits! 12 brand new parts and over 30 toolboxes all together. Like the game is just giving me stuff for free, especially since the bp prices to buy something have been significantly decreased! I love everything about the game so far even killer is fun (trapper at least, hilbilly is unplayable atm) I use two fingers on the right side of my screen 1 for tapping or holding the attack button and the other to look around mostly or help me linge
---
I mean Isnt that how hes supposed to be played. His chainsaw only works in close range
---
Not sure what this subs policy would be on links but if one were so inclined to search an apk or obb file with with the title dead by daylight.
---
default killers are Trapper and Hillbilly.  survivors are Dwight, Meg and Claudette only . the rest you need to buy with Auric cella/Iridescent chards.
---
I tried looking for it but got nothing
---
Or you could just not die by the basement and this problem is solved.
---
Total shitshow on PS4. Killer can see survivors auras through gens right now. Good luck survivors gg
---
I dont think I'll feel bad using him and I think I'll have fun playing him. I just wanted to know if people are gonna report me just for using him
---
Rules.
---
Alright, look, I cleanse totems, but I do not know where each of them is, and I won‚Äôt spend valuable time looking for these totems when I could be doing gens. It‚Äôs unlikely that you, a survivor will find all the totems, and I usually play by myself. I have no way of informing my teamates that the killer may have noed
---
I‚Äôll add you. I‚Äôm Tiberius_42.
---
I actually LOVE getting the gens knocked out of the way if someone can keep the killer distracted, not that I don‚Äôt mind looping, saving, etc. I feel like every other time I play a game, I‚Äôm with survivors who farm points at the hook while I get 3-4 gems done myself. Then, I get hooked and I‚Äôm left to die on the entire hook duration. It‚Äôs a huge pet peeve of mine.
---
Legion used to be that when used with the "Frank's Mixedtape" add-on. Old Legion was impossible to counter, but that still didn't make them good. That single add-on took them from being one of the worst killers to being one of the best while still being uncounterable. Legion was reworked a few months ago though and Frank's Mixtape add-on was nerfed significantly. Legion is still weak, but they're also in a much better place balance wise.
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but you‚Äôre saying that it‚Äôs bad for killers to make survivors lose time, yes?
---
I‚Äôm gonna respectfully disagree and here‚Äôs why; time is the key for survivors in this game. The generators are really your only escape. If survivors don‚Äôt have the time to do generators and are dealing with traps or whatnot, they don‚Äôt have any time to finish generators, etc. Especially if there are survivors on the hook already.
---
Disables Mindgames and Runs down survivors between pallets in seconds. Nope!
---
I believe it was mentioned in early lore that he would bend certain killers he had an interest in to his will, thus why some like Trapper have hooks piercing them. The Entity isn‚Äôt wholly malevolent though and is known to gift his chosen boons, like Wraith‚Äôs Wailing Bell.
---
Really the Entity just seems to nudge those already doing horrible things on a path to continue killing without punishment, seeking out those while malice and pain in their heart he can direct towards survivors.
---
The point is they don't give a shit
---
Is not that hardware cheating? Like attaching keyboard to an XBox is.
---
Ghostface is fun to play against. Legion on the other hand prepare to make enemies.
---
No, the basement should be a really bad place to be.
---
And no, devs should not listed to prodigies/liars. You might be telling the truth and don't need to do any cheap tactic to win, or most likelly you are a survivor main and are just lying, in both cases your feedback is not what the main experience is. you are either too good to be someone telling what other players need or don't because you are basing it on what you need, or you are just salty and wanting to leave the other side without any advantages.
---
SaturnSiren ! 
---
I'm a PS4 player , I play both killer and survivor , rank doesn't matter to me ! I have a mic and usually like to talk . I don't take games really serious but as others have said , I play to win . 
---
And hello t-bags are a must !! üòåüíñ
---
So I think imma get ghost face then
---
Thats what I think, games are for fun if survivors hate 60% of the killers and rage everytime they go against them. They shouldnt be playing survivor
---
It could be a polygon/resolution issue. Too much detail lowers performance from the extra math needed for rendering.  It could also (partially) be a matter of time invested vs likely ROI for that time.
---
So you'd rather have a shit tier killer than a reworked, much better version? This is like living in a shitty apartment and turning down a free mansion.
---
Just sent a request! I‚Äôd love to play with a group who are all about communication!
---
I can understand that. Alrighty then. Agreed.
---
&gt; Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but you‚Äôre saying that it‚Äôs bad for killers to make survivors lose time, yes?
---
If the other choice would be a power that downs survivors and gives killers high movility, then yes.
---
After a ton of Suffocation pits of getting looped endlessly and coldwinds i got a game on Lery's and got the double pip,
---
seriously these achievements are ridiculous
---
&gt;In the 2.7.0 PTB sound files leaked 
---
"leaked"
---
I'm only playing Leatherface to get to level 30 and get BBQ perk up. So when I do main someone on the killer side. I can use BBQ as well.
---
I thought Xbox had an official keyboard and mouse you could play with?
---
console peasants
---
Always face directly into a wall obstacle when you pick up to prevent survivors from getting in front of you. If you're in the open and can't face a wall, when go to pick up a survivor and then hear or see someone run up to try to blind you, immediately spam the drop button and usually you'll be able to get them off your shoulder before you are blinded. You can also use perks like Leatherface's Franklin's Demise, the Doctor's Overwhelming Presence or the Hillbilly's Lightborn to help you against flashlights.
---
Really? I figured it wouldn‚Äôt be a great combo due to her teleporting everywhere instead of running
---
That sucks!! I hate when that happens to me. If you play on PS4 and want someone to play with, lemme know!
---
PS4 sonimusprime. Looking for other ladies to show them dudes in the fog how it is done. 
---
I am around a rank 8 usually.
---
Thanks! Yea not sure what I‚Äôd change it for. Maybe sloppy butcher to slow the game even more
---
You can't even use them cuz they are buggy you can only do the emotes , walk and crouch with the xbox controller
---
I mainly use it for the bloodpoints haha
---
are you actaully playing him. Because you know you can just use the bloodpoints you earn from playing another killer and spen it on him. Or are you using him for bbq  to level him up so you can use bbq on other killers?
---
Thanks :)
---
So nurses instead of BBQ, got it. Should I swap out pop goes the weasel for butcher then?
---
To use BBQ for other killers. Plus he isn't bad to play.
---
I build the scene in Blender, and then I port it into sfm \^\^
---
Play survivor
---
Thank you!!!
---
For me iron will doesn‚Äôt work when I‚Äôm slugged. Since when does that happen?
---
 I build the scene in Blender, and then I port it into sfm \^\^

I know it‚Äôs not gonna be as performant as on console or pc. But it‚Äôs a basic thing.

Norwegian app store
---
Was this on PS? I think I may be the killer you stunned lol
---
I like the sound of it what 4th perk would you run here? Sorry I know this is an old comment
---
New strat: Get a shitton of burner phones, enjoy free Iri Head Infantry Belt Huntress with an ebony mori.
---
I'm a Kate and I approve this message.
---
I don't play swf and I run small game. I cleanse totems and do gens. Nothing hard about it. People need to get out of the mindset that gens are the only objective.
---
I was thinking like an exhaustion perk of your choosing or maybe solidarity so you can heal yourself just by healing two people
---
Feel free to add me on steam Bowlingdude, I‚Äôm at rank 10 now and while I don‚Äôt take the game too seriously I‚Äôm killer at getting gems done, sometimes committing to my own detriment.
---
At least they'll give the killer the BBQ stack and waste 30 or so seconds of the killers time.  That's a win-win for the other 4 players in the game over a straight up DC.  And if the extra time means they decide not to rage quit because it's no longer "in the moment"; then that works too.
---
fyi odd bulb is terrible
---
Dang regardless great stun
---
Not sure what you want me to say.  Just think its a dumb idea.
---
It isn't relevant.  The topic was never are SWF shitty to play against.  The topic was about a killer ragequitting and a survivor depipping as result.  Stay on topic.  Objectively you can't defend this the same way it would be wrong if a killer depips from all the survivors ragequitting.
---
No. No it shouldn‚Äôt be.
---
I just had a game where I couldn‚Äôt knock GF out of stalk because my camera was shoved into the fire barrel behind me. So, that was annoying.
---
He tries to tempt you to the dark side. Don't give in unless you enjoy the idea of being the Entity's bitch slave.
---
If you go from crouch immediately into sprint burst it won‚Äôt activate.
---
Im being wholly genuine with what I said. I end up playing more survivor than killer, but I enjoy killer more than survivor by a longshot. I definitely do not believe that rank 5 makes me a prodigy by any means though. The amount of times I actually get to use basement in my games is almost 0. I think that I could play around it, but then the games are unfun and unfair. Awhile back I got some basements with pig, and I can confirm that make your choice literally left me with someone in that basement the whole game.
---
Wow that must of been annoying good job though
---
&gt; I'm a survivor main
---
Survivors can only go a whole game without being hooked if they're outplaying the killer constantly. If a killer is getting outplayed then why would they be able to hook them?
---
As much as I'd like to agree, let's take into account situations where survivors know they have this get of jail free card and will unhook in front of killer or bodyblock for others purely because of the long timer.
---
Yes, Mathieu during the Korean Twitch event
---
Not very much honestly. The bloodpoints is all its there for.
---
Sounds good! I‚Äôm definitely taking nurses after all the comments about it
---
THe moon is made of cheese, so get your well deserved upvote.
---
I reduced the speed (again)! Hope it‚Äôs better!!!
---
You're the type of person i message pussy to on psn
---
I was referring to Jake and Wraith.
---
What does this mean?
---
‚ÄúI dc‚Äôd because of the killer playing Spotify‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm so confused.
---
Honest question, and forgive me if I am wrong.  I'm of the opinion that both survivors and killers get more points for dragging a game out and therefore it is better to play kinda dumb on both sides than to genrush or tunnel/camp.  Is this not the case?  Am I missing something here?  When I play (Survivor main not by choice, I just suck at killer), I try to do all the things.  Cleanse totems, do gens, unhook like crazy, heal, All of the above.  I actively want to be chased as much as possible because I'm getting points for surviving.  I'm not running out and finding the killer, but I am playing to earn bloodpoints and emblems, not to do five gens and run away ASAP.  I don't see the point.   Am I doing it wrong?
---
It's kind of an platform thing. Just like Nurse is God on PC but shit on console. The nature of the mobile controls and setup will change the viability of characters and perks. 
---
For example the way audio cues have visual components on mobile it makes whispers nearly useless. So other perks will likely be stronger due to the differences in gameplay.
---
Wrong. You must not play much.
---
It‚Äôs because it is not just the character‚Äôs look, but the actor‚Äôs actual likeliness needs to have permission too
---
It's worth getting but it isn't a beginners perk. A killer may waste a ton of time looking for survivors when they shouldn't be, but it's great for  things like "which door are that at during endgame collapse, or which gens are they working on as soon as you spawn in"
---
Ahh fair enough. I thought you were referring to Feng my bad.
---
So you preffer to make them lose a few seconds over the ability to take them down faster, progress in your objective and definetely slow them more by killing team mates?
---
Got about 2500 hours in so swing and a miss man.  Nice try though.
---
That sounds preferable if your a survivor lol, att least I never start killing until 2 gems left, otherwise bps art worth it.
---
RIGHT lol
---
I didn't even get to read it
---
Just so you and top commenter know, it's very possible the totems spawned outside the map.
---
I see it once maybe every 100 or so games as killer
---
It means he can't eat his sandwich and hammer a nail too :/
---
&lt;3
---
100% these guys defending the basement have no clie what they're talking about lmao. I have 3,000+ hours in this game and the basement is bs. Especially against LF because of his defense with his chainsaw. It's stupid. Killers can also hold the game hostage on some maps with how small the basement exit/entrance is.
---
If you're the killer and you're not chasing anyone and then see an unhook you know there are at least two people there in not more. The smart play is to go back and if someone is still injured that's one hit instead of two to down. Survivors tend to be too quick with unhooks and often blame killers for camping and tunneling because they got greedy for WGLF stacks.
---
I'm exaggerating a little but not by much.
---
Which then begs the question: *Why.*
---
So defensive. Why is this attached to your ego so much? I guess since you've spent 3 years playing it. This is very important to you, isn't it?
---
YES
---
Oh, I'm not a beginner.... well.... depending on what you consider a beginner I guess at least. I'm about 180 hours in and always reading a ton of guides and stuff
---
And yeah, the, finding where did the spawn is the reason I was asking this
---
Exactly. This is why DS can affect anybody, even non-tunnelers.
---
But, have horde scream "I hAvE rEd SoCkS" randomly. Please.
---
It stops you from making noise, including the coughing, when you get hit by the Afterpiece Tonic. The Clown still gets notified he hit someone via the scoring pop-up; unless he didn‚Äôt see you AND a teammate also got hit by the bottle, Calm Spirit won‚Äôt help vs Clown.
---
How am I defensive?  You keep just telling me I'm wrong and then toss out a baseless false assumption.  Me responding to you is defensive lol?  Jesus man
---
Current Freddy would be happy with that.
---
Right I definitely see proxy camping a fair amount in my games if the killer feels hopeless at continuously injuring and hooking people in a game and just wants a kill on the board.  I know what you mean by it feeling like it feels like you are targeted repeatedly by different killers though.
---
What would you want to be done about this?  I like a few comments about how against good survivors make the game short by gen rushing so perhaps they should add a few extra objectives to give killers more time?  Not sure how that would affect the lower tiered killers and survivors specifically.
---
If my killer was a lower rank, i'd bully her swf for you, I just destroyed 3 Object of obsession users, two flashlights and an Insta-heal in five minutes. As huntress lmao.
---
I mean, Netflix *did* tweet about their and Behaviour's upcoming project
---
A DbD stream a couple days ago announced that the rework is playable on July 9th on a Tuesday. Some of the people commenting have no idea what they're saying.
---
I added a flair so it should be visible
---
Exactly that‚Äôs why everyone hates him
---
If you don't like the game and all it's bugs stop playing. If survivors are body blocking hooks, I'm going to body block them from escaping and vice versa. Stop being a wuss.
---
If we go by what we see at the intro, that could be more lore friendly, because they are almost unconscious.
---
Should be visible now
---
Nice wish I had a gf that was into video games or a girlfriend just in general.
---
Now I understand the smile.
---
Sign me in Entity.
---
He looks fine in-game
---
Huntress hatchets will still tell you youre exposed by noed despite not insta downing you, it probably does the same for devour
---
Holy fuck that is a cursed image.
---
I invited them to the party and asked him if he had Spotify on and he said yes
---
Rank 21
---
Yes you hear it over her humming for sure, it also lights up too. Whispers is a go to for my huntress. Great at the beginning and end of the game also when they're being immersed
---
Then why we'll make it, does it speed up healing?
---
He was lag switching
---
The basement was made that way for a reason.
---
It's basically what I said, yes
---
Maybe I should strengthen my ego by throwing out how many hours of my life I've put into this game like you are.
---
Leatherface clearly only did what he did out of fear of his family shaming him. He was mentally unable to really understand what was wrong with his actions and only killed to please his family members. 
---
Also, ghostface‚Äôs low kill count shouldn‚Äôt excuse his cruel motives for the murders he committed.
---
Dude you kept responding to me telling me I'm wrong, you made an inaccurate assumption about me barely playing this game, so I in turn responded with play time to clear that up.  You sound super salty right now after falsely calling me out and I don't quite understand why.  You sound very "defensive" right now...
---
Yes, it speeds up heal speed by 100% after unhooking someone.
---
Thx for the info
---
ok well everyone feels diffrent about things. and im pretty sure people hate him because he does that and the people who play him are known for face camping but everyone else says to get him or to do what i want so imma get him.
---
Oh hello there beefcake, hope I get to heal you. Rub my hands all over that.
---
Wait, when did Rin kill her father?
---
If you do 3 does it work? Ive always had that problem. Hopefully it's not completely broken.
---
Not to mention, It was their first attempt at replicating a licensed killer and their budget was way less than it currently is. They did an amazing job though, gameplay wise at least,,, for the most part
---
Had same problem on ps4.
---
Then don't say anything. 
---
Leave the discussion to the people who are trying it and interested in it and go do something else.
---
Don't let this distract you from the fact Console still runs like shit.
---
Gotcha. Tho strange it was never explained in a game.
---
Yea he was. That's why the villagers burnt him alive.
---
Her backstory says that the entity promised her vengeance on him, so it can be reasonably inferred he's decorating a meat hook somewhere.
---
Check out the emblems post game. They tell you why you/your team lost points towards the pips. How many people got hooked, how many gens you participated in, cleansing totems, etc. all count towards your pips score.
---
Jesus christ.
---
i tHinK wE diD a pReTty gOod JOb sO faR
---
Wdym
---
Shouldn‚Äôt a got caught dewd
---
I'm glad that with new killers they are introducing more ways to earn them, like cleansing, mending, snapping out of it, etc. But this isn't for all killers...
---
Also deletes all of your apps.
---
If they are trolling me I tend to just troll them back.
---
How do you get access?
---
I only saw the first one of the originals and the remake, it is only implied in the original but in the remake (which is the one this Freddy is based off given Quentin's presence) he is directly stated to be a pedophile.
---
Ok.
---
I only started playing recently, so this may change over time, but I really just want to put all their unique perks and one that seems fitting on them.
---
last time i played against a toxic SWF team they were body blocking, teabagging flashlight spamming and just doing their best to try to make the game as unfun as possible for me 
---
i hooked someone and the last gen popped right behind me and one went for the unhook while the other 2 body blocked me
---
but they missed a single hex totem and thanks to noed they were all on the ground in a minute 
---
but i didnt hook them. no i got my revenge! 
---
the other exit gate was way on the other side of the map 
---
so i went all the way to the other side of the map and opened the gate triggering end game collapse 
---
then i waited. anyone who managed to crawl all the way to the exit gate had me waiting there to pick them up and put them on a hook
---
This guy gets it
---
That word Pedantic probably made this dudes head explode!
---
The most important thing is to have fun
---
There is counters to hag rescue with crouching and flashlights. But now consider running enduring and agitation. You guarantee get to basement. Now think about you getting people normally from the hook with traps. Now add 3 traps to the basement. They arent going anywhere. And what are they to do? Crouch the whole way down, and the whole way back up the stairs? Not before you walk back and one hit down the injured survivor who was just on hook!
---
I've been doing this for awhile, just havent had any motivation or funny jokes. Best not to force them, ya know?
---
There's been a huge influx of quality shitposting since the subreddit changed its policies. I'm very happy to see all the creativity and high quality memes over the past year or so.

Yes, while most people believe that bringing self-care is essential and you should only be making builds with 3 perks instead of 4 (similar to how 90% of my killers bring Hex: Ruin instead of a strong 4-perk setup), there are other builds out there that need synergy of all of the perks. Using self-care, especially in solo matchmaking, can be helpful like any other perk, but I find in most of my games that I am able to find a partner to ask for healing while getting on gens or running into them while we chase down totems. Most times than not, the person who unhooks me will attempt to heal me anyways. The only real reason I like bringing self-care now is in case everyone I'm playing with doesn't like to heal others (strange, I know) or I'm lucky and against a Freddy, in which I can use the healing skillcheck to wake myself up.
---
Please tell me that‚Äôs you‚Äôre joking
---
It wasn't made to be camped. It was made as a consistent hook spawn, while being "difficult" to escape. Not, "impossible" unless the killer decides he wants to leave and be fair.
---
It hasn't yet (i think) but it will be! The beta is already out in some places.
---
The power is really OP. The 1st perk seems fine but pretty much not useful 90% of the time, the 2nd one seems way OP I don't think that even with a really low cap would be balance since movement speed in this game is really important and for the last perk is a good idea but actually only usable for spirit, legion and your idea killer since other don't use a cooldown ability
---
Spicy mate cheers :)
---
Good shit
---
At least it'll taste good when a survivor forces you to eat it later!
---
I agree with you. Chainsaw killers make face-camping it horribly hard. Trapper and hag make it almost impossible to save because the killer can walk away go kick stuff, maybe find other people, then BOOM trap is triggered or disarmed? Time to go back and get another free kill on top of the other one.
---
It's a bug I think. I've seen a few people post about this.
---
U might have shitty connection
---
Yeah there really is not a counter to it unfortunately if the killer decides to camp or proxy camp the basement as the hooked survivor is almost certain, unless the killer is bad but all they really need to do is sit on the stairs and wait truly.  I hope the devs will modify it but from my knowledge its been in the game for so long that they won't probably change it right?

---
So cringe lol.
---
Keep in mind that they are a swf group. If you're chasing someone and they are leading them away from a hooked survivor there is a 1000% chance someone is trying to unhook. If you break off of the chase you can catch them by suprise and maybe get the dude you hooked. Know that they are going to be communicating constantly. Try to be unpredictable. Good swf survivors will tell their friends about habits that you show. Catch them off guard.
---
That is not vanilla, it's obviously a pretty good job so far!
---
Empathy is already a good aura reader for that build. I'd take We're gonna Live forever for the extra Bloodpoints, and an offering for alturism. If not that than pharmacy so you can get more medkits.
---
Play as the ghost face mask killer. He‚Äôs now the easiest killer in the game.
---
He‚Äôs Sooooooooooooooooooopooooo OP NoW! 
---
I like it, take my money!
---
That's why I hoped that I could make a post to gain attention. Yes, a ton of killer mains could say that this needs to stay for killer strength, but the killers strengths should be elsewhere. I just think the games of DBD should be fun, fair, and competitive. But, I also think that being face camped is almost literally a waste of time and not getting to play. I dont even know how killers do it because there is NO FUN in that playstyle. The only fun you COULD get is rage from survivors who feel cheated.
---
I would just keep leveling up everyone else until bill comes out. When he does it's honestly up to you. If you manage to get everyone p3 50 before he's released you wont have to worry about leveling him up to get borrowed time.
---
Did anyone else see the claudette?
---
The entity wouldn't fulfill that promise.  It has no reason to.
---
I will admit I never actually saw a Texas Chainsaw Massacre film, but when I see clips online he always seems to be giggling and psychotically gleeful about the killing, but yeah if what you say is true he should probably go above Trapper on the list. As for Ghostface I just don't feel right putting him higher than he is, I think his body count was pretty high considering how much attention his multiple sprees caught (his bio says his career took him from  ***Utah to Pennsylvania*** that's like 9 states he murdered his way through!)
---
It's a nasty ass bug thats killed me 5 times in the past week. The only way you can escape when this bug is active is if you escape through the hatch. It might be best to report it. It sucks and theres not much you can do about it as of right now.

Congratulations!
---
I feel like it would, I mean it's the entity, it doesn't really need a reason to kill people.
---
For sure I think the issue deserves a spotlight and larger discussion.  It is boring to be camped and I could never do that as the killer as standing still feels lame and honestly is disadvantageous overall against good survivors.  Camping will always be a part of the game but hopefully this impossible situation outlined in your post can be amended to make it a bit more interesting and less one-dimensional.

Wraith actually had no clue he was killing people at his job. Finding out is what made him snap.

Did i not say that it takes around 1 hour to find the lobby

It SEARCHES for a lobby for 1 hour and when i join that lobby i wait around 5 more mins to find survivors for teh game.
---
Ive been stopping the search and searching again but nothing is working
---
Btw odd bulb isnt that good! If you want the best flashlight use a utility flashlight with a long life battery THEN a low amp filament. The order of addons matter. All addons other than batteries and low amp filaments aren't worth using. Trust me. Check my profile if you wanna know more I have a whole guide on using flashlightsm

Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice
---
Just leave them downed then.
---
The dbd community is hella toxic so its normal to get messages
---
No mither, self care, sprint burst and lithe.
---
Go for perks that make his terror radius bigger. The bigger the better. The survivors will tell you where they are, will constantly have to snap out of it and wont be able to do anything until then, and you can use addons to let you switch from treament to punishment mode faster and you'll be able counter vaults and pallets because if they scream they can't do anything for that short amount of time.

Best bet would be to hide the chat all together [if you're on PC] or don't read the messages if you're on console.

I'm sorry, man, I really am. I hope you and your partner have a ton of fun gaming, and I hope you run into as little toxicity as possible.
---
You don‚Äôt need those perks for him. He‚Äôs already really good with what he has.
---
How does it benefit itself by doing so?  It loses a valuable asset, the killer.  Once rin gets her revenge she'll just pass away.

I don't do the hatch, mostly because these killers were meant to be ruthless and brutal, not benevolent. All I am doing is filling the role.
---
For Nurse you just need to practice. A lot. The only way to get good is to get used to how long you need to hold down the trigger. Also don't try to break pallets or vault windows. Don't chase survivors without teleporting. You litterally can't catch them. I don't know what else to say other than GOOD LUCK :D
---
It would be one thing to critique it for its flaws but to just shit on the existence with no points to reference isn't good discussion.
---
It would be like me going to r/fortnite and saying "Why would anyone play this stupid game." I don't like and that is a valid opinion but it adds nothing to discussions so I don't go or post there.
---
There are people who don't have PCs or consoles who would like to play.I personally own PC's and consoles but as a fan I'm interested the adaptation. The ability to play on the go is appealing too.

The best tip I have for ghostface is don't go into stealth mode after hooking or downing a survivor. Hooked and downed survivors can break you out of steath. It happens a lot.

Yes, or make up your own. If you make up your own, tell me their stats.

Silent step: You have developed the art of being invisible while in the open. No one in your family seems to notice when you come out of your room. You have scratch marks that last 4 seconds and all sped up actions have their aura time cut in half.
---
Glutton: You are a fatass. With eating a bag of chips in one go and downing a liter of mountain dew whenever you get the chance you have the ability to eat almost anything. Grants you the ability to eat another dead survivors body to regain 1 health state even while injured. (15 second ability time and can only be used if another survivor was either mori'd or DC'd.)
---
Annoyance: You simply talk to much. While the killer is in a 30m radius of your position on a hook their ability to hear loud noise events is prevented. Survivor sounds are cut down by 1/4 sound while in your radius. (Can still see auras and can hear faint whispers of survivors in the abilities radius.)
---
I would either say self care or no meither. With no meither I would also be sick and injured by I would technically never die lol. With self care i could keep myself from being sick or injured indefinately. But if i am about to die i wont be able to heal myself because id be in the dying state.
---
If you face off against a spirit at red ranks, they are very notorious for tunneling every person off the hook the majority of the time. PS4.
---
She is pretty fun... sometimes...
---
The kill holds his arm over the survivor‚Äôs waist in the game to hold onto them, they don‚Äôt hold their ass like in this picture so I don‚Äôt think you could slide haha
---
Look at a wall? Jesus. It's easy to counter so don't bitch for a nerf
---
I don‚Äôt use those perks when I play as killer. Kind of takes the fun out of it for me. To each his own, some people need it that. 
---
Surprisingly I didn‚Äôt play against many ghost face mask killers during the release, but the past two days have been insane. So much so that I wanted to see how easy this guy was to play as. I played as him today and he was super easy and I only used his perks.
---
You can down someone quicker than any other killer that personally adding those perks to his build would be too much. It‚Äôs way overkill.
---
Back-revving is when you go up to someone's back and chainsaw them - revving your chainsaw on the survivor's backs.

**Sorry, I'm Going To Stay In Tonight**

- Grants +10% bonus while working on a gen alone. If another survivors joins you, you experience a -25% loss of gen repairing ability.

**You Need to Meet More People**

Gets rid of red stain
---
i dont sorry....jks
---
I am cleaning up my add ons before I prestige my main survivors.
---
So even basic tool boxes with low grade add ons I am getting rid of slowly
---
Its a mindgame, makes the survivor confuse because they do t see the red stein infrint of you, in some loops that goves you a free hit, try to moonwalk  in tiles;)
---
Red stain, you walk backwards at corners the survivors will take if they think you're going a certain direction. but since they go through one side you can 180 and hit them
---
I'm not sure I have ever used the auditory aspect of Whispers, and it's one of my favorite tracking perks in the game. I didn't even notice it made noise until I read it somewhere else.

What i do is go to building and try to 99% everyone, and then down them one per one, pretty fun and great at rank 1

My friends always make fun of me for choosing to play this game over and over for months. Jealous you got people to play with. Have fun!!
---
watch other people play nurse on youtube or twitch. Sadly since you're on console its going to be more difficult for you to do well since you have to have very precise blinks but being on console doesn't affect how well you can aim the distance of your blinks so that's good.
---
Getting the "I'm all ears" perk from ghostface will help a lot because breaking line of sight is the nurse's biggest counter. Also if you didn't know you can fully charge a blink and then into directly down and the blink will stay in the same spot you are standing, it's good against players who run back into you when you start charging a blink. This does become hard on maps like the game though because you will instead go to the first floor if you are on the second. One more thing, you dont have to swing as soon as you blink, wait a second and make sure that you are looking the right way and that you are even close enough to land the hit.
---
Good job
---
They must have had a key.
---
Used a key
---
Ghost face has to shut his terror radius off to even start stalking someone.....
---
"Mondays"
---
Actually pretty good perks! I really like the last one. It feels a bit like autodidact, but I don't know.
---
How would Chucky even hook someone in the first place?
---
This is incredible!
---
They used a key. If the hatch has spawned and a survivor has a key they can open the hatch at will but it should only be open temporarily.
---
The hatch spawns for 2 different reasons
---
1 - There is only one survivor left alive. The hatch will spawn and it will be open.
---
2- The amount of **completed** generators is equal to the amount of remaining survivors + 1.
---
So for example if 1 survivor has been killed and 3 remain then you take the living survivors (3) and add 1
---
3 + 1 = 4
---
So that means 4 generators need to be completed and then the hatch will spawn. However with this condition the hatch will spawn closed. The only things that can be done with it are use a key to open it or make a mental note of where it is in case you need to use it later.
---
Leatherface is stated to only do what his limited capacities allow him to, even with the entity all he does is what he thinks is best to keep himself and those he cares about safe. So in the end at heart he is a good person.
---
Michael reminds me of something I heard a priest say, about pure evil, he said it is hard for us to even understand what that would be like. We can understand how some people put their pleasure over the lives of others,  but it is hard to understand someone who puts evil above his own interests. And Michael is that, he doesn't care about himself, he has no goal, he is pretty much an empty carcass all there is left is evil, he knows what he does but I can't even say he likes it, he just does it because it is evil.
---
Perk 1 : what am I doing again? : your focus isn‚Äôt that great, but gets better over time. Your great skill check bonus starts at -5%/-4%/-3% for each great skill check hit, you receive a bonus of 2%/3%/3%. This bonus maxes out at +3%/5%/6% ‚Äúwait a minute what were we supposed to do again?‚Äù
---
Perk 2 : ignorance : you tend to ignore many things. Ignore status effects and hex effects for 20/25/30 seconds when a generator is fully repaired. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù 
---
Perk 3 : Lurker : The time you have spent lurking in the darkness of your mother‚Äôs basement has increased your vision through the dark. Your fov brightness is increased slightly/moderately/considerably and your aura reading is increased by 3/6/9 meters. ‚ÄúOh come on mom! I don‚Äôt wanna go upstairs!‚Äù
---
Ash, he's literally the only reason I bought the game.
---
And a lot of other killers are annoying to play against. Doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm throwing a fit like a child demand other people‚Äôs fun get taken away just cause I‚Äôm not good at countering them
---
aww im srry to get your hopes up lol
---
How do flashlight saves work? I have tried them as survivor, and have had them used against me as killer, but they never work. Does the timing need to be precise, or is it that they have to be blinded at any point during the carrying? There have been times where i was blinded as i was picking someone up, and i did t drop them.
---
I think only bad survivors  complain about noed. It makes the killer play with only 3 perks for 90% of the game and can be denied.
---
I don't have Legion, so I'm guessing all the named characters are people who are Legion?
---
Pal I do the same when I play survivor, if you want bloodpoints, that is the way (That or if you trust your skills you can use We're Gonna Live Forever) But as a killer... You see, you cannot afford to drag out the game, every second counts an if you try to take things slow you will be greeted with 5 gens popping out of nowhere and getting buttdanced at exit gates (If survivors are experienced enough of course, I am not laking about rank 20 game.)
---
Plus even the developers admit that (You can read the devolopers notes, I believe it is pinned in the frontpage) there is a big unbalance between killers and survivors in the bloodpoint gain section. [For example when I play killer (With BBQ and Chili) I get AT LEAST 40.000 bloodpoints per match (Mostly goes up to 80.000 if I use good offerings), in the other hand as survivor I have had matches where I got only 1.000 bloodpoints (You didnt read it wrong, first to get sacrifaced) and the best I managed to get was 30.000 (I dont know maybe I suck at the game)]
---
How do I get dbd mobile?
---
Can confirm, it's easy mode now, because you know which gens are being worked on
---
The entity has a reason for what it does. If killing her father would calm her down, Entity could even lose a servant, on the other hand it might make her go more insane, then entity would grant her revenge.
---
In the end, we don't know if she did.
---
Agreed
---
lmao that's stright bullshit and you now that there is a whiny killers and toxic as much as survivors they are not gods or angles or anything
---
You are a bad guy 
---
But this does not mean you are a bad guy
---
What kind of phone do you have?
---
I am with you to the bitter end on this
---
Try play with your food on him. I still think hes a garbage killer but play with your food makes it a bit more bearable.
---
Nah man, this is just to help newer players get an understanding of choosing their prey. Most of us have the core consept of this flowchart already in our mind.
---
iPhone
---
Ps4. 
---
When you go out of survivor menu to main menu sometimes ash say one of his one liners. I don't even have ash unlocked.
---
Terryfing,I will send pic to friend
---
Can confirm, ps4 feels laggy as fuck since the last update. I've noticed that my character feels like he's teleporting all over the place most of the time. Killer hits downing me when it didn't seem like they even connected.
---
Well, I will be glad to read your tips and tricks, kinda-rude sir.

rockthrow is a nazi
---
xD this one was funny
---
Perks I reccomend on any GF build.
---
- Discordance (Helps with finding people in the early/mid game)
---
- Pop Goes The Weasel (A solid perk on almost every killer)
---
- Bamboozle (Situational but pretty good for securing those Marked kills)
---
- Enduring (Also good for securing Marked kills)
---
- Devour Hope (I've used this one for the lols but it's actually not that bad. Never a great idea to leave a perk slot to RNG though. After 3 tokens all survivors are Exposed, meaning you don't need to use the marking system anymore. Just sneak up on them and stab.)
---
- BBQ (BBQ is universally good. Pretty much every killer uses it. It's especially helpful for finding the other survs. Plus a lil' extra BP never hurt anyone.)
---
K
---
They did you dirty
---
It's something happening to my boy
---
I don't remember where I saw this but wasn't Trapper reluctant to kill for the Entity? I swear he had to be tortured into obeying.
---
*laughs in Legion*
---
Try hooking someone on the basement and then go for another survivor, they won't see you coming. Hell even if they see you they'll just think you are just another survivor with a very bad case of tachycardia.
---
I'd do anything for Freddy from the first four films (even if I just got the one from the second movie, cause the meaty face and flesh claw are cool in their own right). It doesn't have to be cool guy Freddy like shown here, just anything to get from this remake skin. Who wants to look like Pedo Freddy when you can look like Robert Edlund?
---
Which add-on allows green key to open black locks? I thought green was purely for aura reading things with addons
---
Correct. He was playing trapper and got maybe 2 hooks out on haddonfield before we finished gens. He then hooked and camped a teammate to death. Me and another teammate got to a gate and I took the L so that the other 2 could escape. I fucked up a loop and he got me. Then face camped me til i died.
---
The Legion memes still going on? I barely could pass rank 12 before the re-work, and now I can get to red rank with him. I think Legion's a lot better than before
---
[\[COPYRIGHT VIOLATION TIER 3\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB9Cw5q-mmM)
---
Too good looking. BHVR would step outside the art direction of the game and make something cool
---
LMAO the killer would get moried if you throw a pallet at him
---
A leatherface who doesn't respect pallets is just a thicc trapper with no bear traps, his ability is useless as pallets unless the survivor is brain dead
---
"When she says her parents are not home"
---
(Plays DBD)
---
Yeah it applied to all addons on all items and also Killer addons
---
Frank, Joey, Julie, and Susie are the Legion
---
Still garbage.
---
The salt is real, lmao. Theres been times where i‚Äôve had like 3 gens get popped within a couple minutes as I chase one survivor, but even then i‚Äôm just like ‚Äúwell fuck, that sucks‚Äù and take the L and whatever kills I can get if any. No need to resort to camping or tunneling, just get what you can and try harder next match
---
I played survivor on the mobile cause I main killer on ps4.
---
To be honest I am enjoying it. The controls are strange at first but you get into it pretty fast.
---
The leveling system (perk gain) is better as on original game in my opinion. (it is linked to character level which is linked to character progress = exp gain in the trials)
---
That is sooo cute!!! I‚Äôm happy for you two! üòä
---
Bubbas/trappers basement is way too funny though
---
You literally just got hooked, and killer could've been camping you and other survivors noticed that. Your own fault for getting downed next to the basement.
---
Noed crutch into BM EGC cheese... You were just as douchey as they were from the sounds of it, but it's cool because you were the killer right so it doesn't count?
---
He deliberately went out of his hook route to rub the hatch in your face. He deserved this! Awesome job
---
Thank you! I definitely could have made her look more Asian especially with the nose and eyes, but I tend to go overboard when I spend a long time on drawings lol. 
---
Also I‚Äôm actually not sure if she has yellow eyes, I  think they‚Äôre brown but I probably added too many light layers and didn‚Äôt bother to look up another reference photo to double check oop. 
---
Also also the pin that you linked is very pretty! I would say it‚Äôs definitely a mix between semi-realistic and anime style, which is why it looks a lot more Asian than mine  B)

Yup. If you put a low amp filament and then a low life battery on a utility flashlight, it'll last about 20 seconds. If you put the long life battery and then the filament it lasts 22 seconds. Thats enough time for almost 2 blinds. Same with instaheal medkits. If you put a charge boost addon first and then the instaheal, it'll last for less time. Example: yellow medkit = 24 charges. 24 + 12 (gauze wraps addon) youll have 36 charges. If you then put the instaheal you'll be left with 18 charges. If you put the instaheal first it goes like this. 24√ó.50=12 12+12 (the gauze wraps) = 24. That basically means if you put the instaheal first and the charges addon second, you can squeeze out 2 full heals instead of just one. If you do it the other way around, you'll only get 1 (one full heal takes 12 charges)

LMAO
---
He‚Äôs not the worst killer, he‚Äôs just harder to master. I‚Äôve played against some really good Leatherface players who were really good with him and destroyed us. 
---
Which Is rare as most of the time they just camp the hook or swing wildly with their chainsaw and hit nothing but trees.
---
But the Honk is more satysfying. Hell, even as a Killer I enjoy it.
---
Like i said. I have a flashlight guide on my profile and im planning on making a guide for a bevy of other things.
---
And that‚Äôs different from all the other killers in what way? They just took pieces from other killers and pieced them together to make this new shit tier Freddy. The natural transition isn‚Äôt worth the sacrifice of the things they took nor the garbage skills they gave him. His key aspect was that he could see the auras of people in the dream state and slowed gen progress while in the state giving Freddy great control of the field while slowing the game down that‚Äôs without perks which also massively effect how he can be played. Now all you can do is slow people down if you‚Äôre lucky enough to have them run into a trap(trapper) and you can teleport to generators(hag-wraith) and hope that a survivor is there and an add-on for fake palettes(doc). all around worthless and absolutely non-original.
---
Sucks when its you but just use decisive and waste as much time as possible
---
Botany doesn't stack with we'll make it. Check the patch notes.
---
How you identify swf groups? Is there a sign or logo in the lobby?
---
16 seconds of 0 gen work is pretty strong if they always try to counter it. If all 3 survivors are working on a Gen when someone is about to be picked up, you just stopped 48 seconds of repair time, and that just keeps adding up the more times you pick up downed survivors.
---
You could make the argument that survivors can spend time else where, cleansing totems, sabo hooks or searching chests, and it's technically the perfect time to wake another survivor up since it lines up perfectly with how long it takes at max rank, but I can't help but think countering it wastes so much time, especially considering that the perfect opportunity to work on gens is when the killer is occupied.
---
That‚Äôs the point of the meme though
---
Is it on the App Store?
---
No im not saying that at all, NOED is just a counter to gen rushing, if you take your time and get to know the map and cleanse all the totems then NOED doesnt trigger, if you gen rush and get out as fast as you can then the killer can chase everyone down
---
Lol oh ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Pretty sure autodidact caps healing speed at 100% which means that botany knowledge with autodidact is useless. You cant use autodiadact with anything else that increases healing speed. Maybe aftercare instead?
---
It one of the films there's actually a scene where he's playing with an old childs toy where you type in the name of what it shows on screen (So say an apple is on screen you type in apple), it showed a man on screen and he repeatedly typed in "food" and was just confused as to why it was wrong. I feel like that scene in particular is a good indicator of LF in general
---
just as toxic as any other pvp game.
---
Ya you‚Äôre completely wrong in every way except the tunneling it happens somewhat but oh well grow up. Your not gonna gen rush when Freddy has nearly if not all survivors in the dream state and knows where you are. If you attempt to break out of the dream state with a friend Freddy will see you crouch down and knows you‚Äôre with another survivor and put them in the dream state if they aren‚Äôt already forcing people to spread out (then spreading his attention across the map) or risk everyone getting downed. then he can work his way down the list hooking and watching to see who comes to save them and hook a second forcing the other 2 to either continue working on gens  or going to save their allies slowing the game down even more. I could go on and on and into a lot more detail but I don‚Äôt wanna spend the time. Gist is just cause cause your not good at him doesn‚Äôt mean he needed a rework.
---
This game is perfect. There's nothing wrong with it.
---
Sometimes I go for a hit that looks far/absurd on my end and I still get it 
---
But yeah this is absolutely true. If a kill looks absolutely impossible, it didn't look that way to the killer
---
Nah not really. I play a lot of pvp games and this game is the most toxic one
---
I never really witnessed it as a survivor, because no one plays the Huntress, and when I am playing the Huntress, I always hit everybody with the hatchets or attacking.
---
Ya not really the first match I played with as Freddy I got a 3k and after that I‚Äôve never had anything but 4K‚Äôs playing as him. Just cause others can‚Äôt figure out how to play him doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs bad just means you are.
---
You realise you can straight pull it out of the back of your PC right. How does where you live change that.
---
Naw I wanted him to stay the way he was not this new garbage.
---
I wouldn't mind if they had an add-on or something that kept his old playstyle, I kind of like its simplicity. Or maybe a seperate character Freddy.
---
No you're not and ya it's pretty fucking stupid
---
Worthless: You have the uncanny ability to be absolutely terrible at everything you do. All action speeds are reduced by 70/60/50%.
---
Tactician: Your ability to plan ahead is intriguing. Every Gen/Chest/Totem/Hook you interact with has it's aura revealed to you in a 60/80/100 meter radius.
---
Faith: The power of your faith is unshakable. When injured, your luck is 30/40/50% higher
---
Player base is mad toxic. Would say it's the most toxic game I play but Rocket League takes the crown on that one
---
Waste of a pallet
---
He is like the Lebron to hook-jumpers Kobes, he just free-throws them up onto the hook. 
---
Maybe a stepladder?   
---
Or how about a mechanical hook, one that flips over on itself like a trebuchet once a survivor is placed on it.
---
The Myers ain't thicc enough
---
There's not enough room for the pallet to fall flat; he just crawls underneath it!

For...for who?
---
Nah the killer just ain't payin the Internet bill.
---
Nice tush
---
There is a very precise window to start the blind when the survivor is "readjusted" on the shoulder. This window overlaps with killers ability to move or look up though - so if mistimed late they can look up and too early it'll blind without a stun. 
---
This is why on good killers it's nearly impossible - you have to walk in front of them as they go to pick up. If they fake even a little it'll throw off the timing. 
---
Also odd bulb doesn't make the blind any "faster." A plain yellow flashlight is as strong as any get but you get less tries.
---
Mike in general REALLY needs a visual overhaul, idk why all the other killers look fine and mike looks like he‚Äôs from a PS2 game
---
Joy? You must be a low rank. 
---
Only thing this game gives in abundance is frustration. 
---
Oh wait! You're drunk.....
---
This feels like a low rank game. But hilarious OP. Proud of you bb
---
also fuck yeah
---
Wrong, Nea‚Äôs who T-bag the whole game DC when they get downed don‚Äôt ya know?
---
Both sides, depends how you play the game.
---
Competitive people won‚Äôt like it, the people who piss around will see the funny side.
---
Big sad times.
---
Instead of autodidact I would go with solidarity. Sometimes I like to throw in sprint burst or urban invasion so I can sneak in, unhook and heal fast while the killer is off doing something else. We're gonna live forever is also great if you're going for more bps.
---
&gt; gonna get destroyed in the first 5 mins
---
that's a lot of time
---
I'd replace breakdown with an exhaustion perk, people dead hard'ing to get to pallets is pretty annoying.
---
Healing others is over kill and the weakest of the three.
---
I actually really like vault and vanish.  I'd recommend getting windows of opportunity in there for newer/low rank players.
---
I love your drawing. My favorite Kate cosmetic combo is Caribou Beanie, green plaid shirt, and the dark jeans.

This happened to me but the killer was Myers. In the end he game me the hatch for all the free stalk.
---
When is bill gonna be out? Is he going to be free
---
I don't really care how survivors play, they can t-bag or flashlight or whatever. I just hook what I see and sometimes it's the same guy.
---
As killer, when i have my thumb on the far right side of the screen it stars rotating my camera to the right which ruins chases a lot and i can‚Äôt turn it off

Maybe killers pre-entity? Doing post-entity might require some custom content.

Bug Description: Sometimes during the middle of a game I am unable to heal myself, wiggle, recover, or escape through the exit gates. I've died to the endgame collapse 6 times because of this. The only possible way of escape is through the hatch.

This happened to me when I was playing the doctor. The entire team gathered to laugh as I shocked them for the blood points. Who was the real winner?
---
Well for America it's 3-4 am so alot of people are sleeping so I'd imagine it would be kinda difficult to get a match but for other places I have no clue
---
I'd take a lobby full of head on vs a lobby full of dead hard any day
---
can this be the new killer and jon as survivor
---
I dunno.  We‚Äôve just had our first ‚Äúchapter‚Äù to show up with only a killer.  That used to be a pragraph, but I guess that that generates less hype and going forward they might just call everything that includes a new character a ‚Äúchapter‚Äù to generate more hype and drive up sales.

He's been reworked. He is viable now.

Hollup, when was DBD becoming a mobile game?
---
Hopefully not
---
Hillbillies chainsaw is really difficult to use. So I‚Äôd prefer to start of with trapper. 
---
Playing as survivor I found it way to difficult to look behind myself in a chase, so I pretty much had to guess where the killer was. I somehow managed to get a flashlight save lol! 
---
Overall I love the bloodmarket system, but do you think it‚Äôs worth getting David for We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever if bloodpoints just affects addons and offerings?
---
Iron Grip on dat ass
---
Just because i went after you right after you got unhooked dOeSn't MeAn yOU WeRe TuNnElED
---
That idea for original Freddy was not used and he was made into a child killer only. Remake is pedo.
---
Is wifi actually used more than ethernet cables for online games now? I must be getting old.
---
Yeah, I think that's holding the game hostage. Has happened to me aswell.
---
That's a good question. So far I really haven't seen a need to anything more than the blood point offerings. The blood market is pretty efficient for addons used vs gained (BP per trial).
---
I like that the perk/progression just encourages you to play the characters you like separate from bp/addons.
---
So while BBQ(if we get it) still offers tracking WGLF is probably useless. You could still get David for dead hard.
---
No it needs to be an option available for everyone no matter the perks
---
I don‚Äôt want to be a person to put a damper on this because it‚Äôs really good. But in the right side of her neck it looks like a oval of one color that deviates from the rest and I cannot unsee it. Looks really good though!
---
Platform: PC
---
Type of Bug: Visual, Audio
---
Description: The FPS drops drastically during gameplay since the last update (3.0.2), and I'm also experiencing cut outs of audio. This is mostly affecting games when I play killer and Hillbilly to be more specific but I also experience drops when playing survivor.
---
Screenshot / Video: N/A
---
Steps to reproduce: Load into the game, start playing normally. Sometimes I task switch between Windows and the game during queueing as waiting times are long, but this haven't been an issue before.
---
Expected result: The game to run smoothly.
---
Actual result: Sudden FPS drops (62 to 22-32 FPS), lagging or completely missing audio (in-game sound, music), sometimes even framedrops.
---
Reproduction rate: 5/5 games as killer, 3/5 games as survivor. Stopped playing since then, as I don't want to lose rank because of this.
---
System Specs (PC only): Intel i5 3570k, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD (the game sits on the latter), GeForce 1050Ti, Windows 10
---
I‚Äôd like if his face gets a rework.
---
Try to play legion there
---
Depends on the person honestly.  Hardcore gamer dudes still do ethernet since its faster, and more casual gamers go with whatever is easiest.  Most desktops are ethernet but a lot of college aged people play on laptops over wifi.  
---
But thats besides the point.  The original point was that pulling the cable can be a little more difficult than just yanking out the ethernet cable from the tower depending on your setup
---
There are a lot more killer mains then there are survivors
---
I wouldn't mind having mercy hospital as a map
---
Won't work on high ranks when you're running around like that.
---

_DoInG GeNs YoU?_
---
I guess 14 face camping leatherfaces are the equivilent of a thermal lance then :p.
---
Yes. In fact this is related to one of the bugs in the game as well. When you 1st start the game it tells you by completing the tutorial you unlock the 3 survivors and 2 killers as well as rewards of 5000 Bloodpoints, 300 Iridescent shards and 7000 Auric Cells. Which is kinda crazy.
---
In fact you ACTUALLY get 50000 BP, 7000 Iridescent Shards and 300 Auric cells. This leaves you 2k IS or 200 AC short of another killer/survivor.
---
Yea, all good points. For movement speed, I'd opt to make the killer move at 115%. This is allowable due to the Wendigo's "panting", and is frankly necessary due the Wendigo lacking any skills to end chases quickly. I'd possibly even make the Wendigo ever so slightly faster than normal killers and move at 115.5% or 116%. There's precedent for this in the form of myers, who vaults faster as a chasing tool even when his power isn't at T3.
---
For Dark Devotion, I'd say it's probably allowable atm due to the fact that it's very likely that the player would be within the terror radius for the 20 seconds after it's applied (since it will only be applied on a hit, thus meaning that it's usually the start of a chase or the survivor is about to be picked up). Plague wasn't revealed when I made the Wendigo, so this was all made without that knowledge, so it's a bit at odds with the killer, but I think it's ok. Additionally, it removes the terror radius from the Wendigo, thus taking the control from the killer somewhat. The only 2 things it might be useful for are that it would increase your terror radius to 32 m during the chase with the obsession in order to apply more pressure (which distressing already does, and distressing doesn't stack with dark devotion), or to spread your pressure elsewhere while you're chasing by hitting the obsession and chasing someone else. Both things that I think aren't significant enough to warrant an exception.
---
In terms of the power being mostly passive, I think that's probably a valid concern. While this killer would probably result in a tense and exciting game for survivors as they'd be watching their allies for betrayal, it might end up being a somewhat boring M1 killer. With that said, I do think there's room for killers with mostly passive abilities. Myers, for example, is a delight to play, but he doesn't stop being fun after he hits T2, even if you never stalk again. When I play Myers (he's easily my favorite killer to play, and best), it's not uncommon that after I hit T2, I don't tier up. It's not common either, but it happens every 1 in 5 games or so. Myers doesn't stop being fun there though, because I know I'm being stealthy and it's a ton of fun to watch survivors get surprised with my tiny terror radius, a completely passive component of his power (which, lets be real, is the real power, T3 is a bonus in the same way the Wendigo tracking is a bonus). The hope with the Wendigo is that it ends up being similar. You know your power is causing chaos, and while you might not see the effects exactly, the aftereffects should still be enough to see the chaos being caused. I tend to think that the problem that the plague suffers from isn't that her power is too passive, it's that it's not dangerous enough. The survivors don't feel threatened by being infected because of two things in concert. Firstly it's super easy to remove her debuff, so easy in fact that it's actually beneficial in some cases to get yourself infected. Secondly, the consequences of everything the plague does are super delayed. Get hit by her vomit? Well she'll have to hit you 3 more times or wait a minute. Cleanse yourself? Well plague will get empowered, but not until she gets around to it. The power doesn't feel threatening to survivors nor does it feel strong to the plague. I'd hope that the Wendigo would alleviate this. With all that said, I'm not 100% confident it would alleviate it, but I'm hopeful. The Wendigo's power has a pressing effect. While the hunger effect isn't applied immediately, it's not trivial to clear (and can't be cleared prior to the effect being active, giving survivors less control over the situation and giving them less ability to optimize around it). Once the effect is applied, it's bad and unlike the Plague's, it must be cleared before progressing, meaning players can't ignore the power's effect. Clearing the effect is easy if the survivors are working together properly, but doing so can still be a risky proposition since you'll be injuring an ally and revealing the location of both of you. From the killers side, the scream will hopefully be the feedback needed to make the power feel powerful. Much like how with Myers it's fun to watch survivors scramble when you surprise them, it will hopefully be fun to watch the survivors injure eachother then scramble to safety. That's the hope anyway, I feel confident that the Wendigo would have more control over the somewhat passive portion of their power than the plague (though likely less than Myers) and hopefully that control would translate into feeling like you can outplay the survivors with it, whether it would be enough to negate the issues you pointed out, I don't don't know.
---
Glad you're enjoying them though!
---
it was a poorly implemented thing the devs did
---
the game wasnt balanced around survivors being able to communicate so when they can they have a huge advantage 
---
they talk in discord groups and control the entire game
---
so whenever they try to balance things around SWF groups it leaves solo survivors at the biggest disadvantage
---
fuck you beat me to it
---
GG
---
Yeah, would be great except my game has been crashing several times a day the past few days..
---
I was playing as Ace the other day, and me and this David King were going around together doing all the gen and saving the claudette and Jake who kept getting hooked. As soon as we got the gates opened he went to get Claudette one last time with me and jake, then jake went down, and Claudette again, david just went to the exit gates and I followed, sadly they were dead on hook, very sad indeed 
---
But I‚Äôll always remember that David King, it‚Äôs as if he and I were best pals doing all those gens together

Sure, I was running on the assumption people still preferred ethernet over wifi. Even with wifi you can just disable your network in a matter of a few clicks. Not so much "pulling a cable" in the literal sense but the idea still applies. The connection is cut.
---
From What i Can tell rn you cant play swf let alone communicate with teammates. There is No chat after either.
---
It is just a beta and these things Will probably be implemented
---
Yeah But i guess when its  available everywhere it Will.
---
Well there are not enough survivors to go around I guess? I don't know if there are drastically more killer mains than there are survivor mains but it seems like there are too many killers and not enough survivors to go around. It takes 4 survivors per killer. So there is probably more killers than there are groups of 4 survivors.

Nah, he just took a photo during *special time* Haha.

And Tapp
---
Yea, I'm not fantastic with the "coming up with lore" part, hence why I'm completely ignoring it and just grabbing , but I imagine an actual implementation of any of my theorycrafting would end up tied to a specific fictional figure (in much the same way that the Doctor fills the "mad scientist" trope with a specific entity).
---
Glad you're liking the concepts though!
---
My god she's obnoxious...
---
Anyone rememebr the instaflashlight glitch?
---
I bought 700 auric cells for huntress Bc i thought she would be good  (she is lol). Then i bought nurse But she is super hard to control imo.
---
That Myers  tho
---
Had worse results than just going around a nd shocking people
---
Totally forgot about Tapp
---
I like it actually there is less of a grind to get rare stuff and its also less randomized.
---
Perks work by leveling up each killers level. This is done by just playing the game.
---
ü§£ theres a reason I don't make killers, ... balance  but I actually don't that the perks are bad, also the "cooldown reduction perk" would work with nearly all powers, for example Michael would get 25% stalk, wraith could be a movement speed increase while cloaked, pig, traps are faster to kill etc anyway thanks for the feedback
---
In *my* opinion the tier list looks something like:
---
Nurse &gt; Hillbilly &gt;/= Spirit &gt; Hag &gt;/= Huntress &gt; Myers &gt; Ghostface &gt;/= Plague &gt; Doctor &gt;/= Clown &gt;/= Pig &gt; Wraith &gt; Legion &gt; Freddy (current) &gt;/= Trapper &gt; Leatherface
---
For me, survivors essentially have a "mercy pool" of 100 seconds; each survivor has to spend 100 seconds repairing generators to escape (assuming solo repairs without toolboxes), if I'm in a chase with them then this equals 1.25 generators worth.
---
This also means I have to hook a survivor every 33.33 seconds (their third hook being at 99.99 seconds, keeping the rate I sacrifice survivors equal to the rate they're worth in generators) or less, and it also has to be less if the survivors are using toolboxes or perks (prove thyself, resilience, etc) to speed up the last few generators.
---
So whether the survivor on the hook gets to go free mostly depends on whether I've gotten a hook in the last 33 seconds - if I got a hook 28 seconds ago then I need a hook in the next 5 seconds to stay even, and will probably go for the injured guy unless the unhooker bodyblocks.
---
There's not much time in the trial to be nice.

Please be pennywise
---
Urban evasion is booty man
---
Actually suprisingly good!
---
I have an iphone 7+ and it Never lags for me except Once when i blinked and hit a survivor and got a framdrop.

I've noticed that when it gets down to the last 2 survivors, they usually stop working on the gens in hopes that killer gets the other so they can escape. This is because one of them has typically found the hatch and is just trying to wait the other survivor out. This especially happens if there's several gens left to repair (usually 3 and up). I've played multiple games like that, and I know because I've done it.
---
I use perks that generally show me where the killer is at or if he/she is close to me. So, I'll typically try to repair the gens myself if I'm able and hide nearby when the killer gets close enough to trigger my Premonition and Spine Chill perk. I've done this when there's been 2, 3, 4, and very rarely 5, gens left to repair with only me and one other survivor, and most of the time the other survivor doesn't do jack while I risk myself trying to play the game. Then there are the times when I just don't care and also try to wait the other survivor out while keeping on the move so them damn crows will stay away. It really just depends on who the killer is and if I feel the only gens left aren't worth the risk, such as the ones out in the open with little to no cover to hide me, or near the center of the map. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it don't, and sometimes the killer let's me go free cause he/she has noticed I've done all the work. 
---
So to answer your question, I don't think it's holding the game hostage if at least one survivor is still trying. But it's also a lazy, yet sometimes effective, strategy to wait when thr risk is too just too great. Either the killer will leave from boredom, or eventually find one of us as we're bound to make a mistake at some point. It's a cheesy and cheap way to win, but then again so is camping the hooked. It's such a common thing now that it just can't be avoided.
---
No, because the game can still finish based on the actions of either side. Holding the game hostage would be if one side completely stops the other from doing anything, such as blocking all four survivors in the basement with no way to do anything other than disconnect.
---
Love it!

PWYF was patched
---
Its becouse we will get a map rework.
---
Figured I would make a list of bugs I have noticed so far.
---
I stated in another reply, The rewards for completing the tutorial are incorrect.
---
On Gas Haven the garage door texture does not render. You can't tell if the door is open or closed until you run into it.
---
The character models do not appear in the after trial screen.
---
The texture resolution on Lery's is non existent. 
---
On occasion a missed attack will result in the sound and animation of hitting an object when there is nothing there.
---
Quite often you will glitch on top of pallets when you land a hit through a pallet drop.
---
Twice I have been stuck in a gen grab animation. Had to swing to get unstuck.
---
Not as much a bug but a missing UI item.
---
There is no way to read the description of addons, offerings or perks other than when you buy/unlock them.
---
Really that's the thing, your ability isn't used for downing people. Legion is most effective when played extremely anti tunnel. Initiate your chases with Feral Frenzy to land an easy first hit, and if you now start seeing survivors nearby, go for them and try to chain as many Deep Wounds as possible.
---
When there's no survivors around, get as up close as you can to the last survivor you hit before going into cooldown, and then chase them as normal. During the time it takes to chase,  hopefully a few survivors are now stuck mending and can't progress gens or prepare themselves to save.
---
Most of the time imo SC even solo isn't worth it because you can have a gen done in 80 seconds (maybe more with ruin or less with items/other people) and when healing takes 32 seconds with SC (38.4 with sloppy) thats 40% of a generator that could've been done as well. Not to mention if they have nurses or if they catch up to you before you've finished healing you've just wasted all that time. Idk man it does come in handy sometimes but I'd much rather jsut bring a medkit or not heal
---
TCM 3. Good film.
---
The game is NOT balanced around that. Hooking a survivor up to two times is OK for a survivor.
---
[Just gonna leave this one here.](https://imgur.com/a/Skiv2a9)

Sort of. He willingly killed the miners, but he was only reluctant to leave Earth. He wanted to stay in his home world, and presumably kill others.
---
We can all be friends here! We're all gamers
---
Yes, but he was a kiddy diddler AND a murderer.
---
WHY WONT SOMONE CRY UF THEIR MOM DIES YOU LITTLE PIECE OF NEA r/sarcasm

How can I read item and perk descriptions? For items I only find their description on the blood market, but can't get it for either of them when equipping them from inventory. I tried tapping on them but that merely equips/unequips them.
---
Never specified which tier list....

---
Yes this is obviously a tier list on cuteness
---
yeah iknow your post is true, but people don't the joke of mine apparently
---
Short answer is yes. They talked about that in the Dev update that there are too many killers for too few survivors
---
Disagree. He's good at getting first hits, but without Iridescent Button, he struggles in chases. The long stun after Frenzy also makes follow-up hits difficult.
---
Just creepy.
---
The Deathadder mouse seems to be one of the most used mice for this game. And I'm part of it xD also, please, if you somehow see a max coughfield, let her be. she's having a cold in the summer and can't stop coughing.
---
Lolz.
---
Ye
---
The thing that helped out the most was the 15% increase to vault speed. Fuck the 15% to gen repair but oh man...if this company blames all lag on latency and on the killer and the reason why you get hit after taking a few steps after a vault is because of the connection, WHY don't they keep the vault speed boost since it fixed the issue.
---
I don't understand.

Keep "optimizing game" and when done that app will close after optimizing

Dodge every lobby then?

Deja Vu helps me find the gens faster, and I feel like Jake helps me personally. But thanks for the tip!

Welp, do u ever tried to close the gap with his frenzy? Also his power slowd the game to thats nice
---
I wouldn't say it's better than ruin, but it sure is more consistent.
---
Karma is a B
---
I had a myers today who brought a Gateau that wouldnt stop camping his ruin totem. 4 gens were done with him still camping it and he hadnt hooked anyone, then he left to chase someone for a minute and it got destroyed then he instantly DC‚Äôd. Idk what he expected was going to happen if he kept camping it and let us complete all 5 gens.
---
The fact that you're actually complaining about that perk shows how fucking ridiculous you are.
---
Do what you would in real life.
---
Because bhvr isn't don't much till nothing with reports, and ragequitting.....
---
I meant bodyblocking as In when killers used to bodyblock survivors so they couldnt move. For example in the basement, or in my case I had a wraith who bodyblocked me in an area where I couldnt move. Both cases force the player to disconnect as they can not do anything else. Its not about being a wuss douchelord, its about the game having some very serious issues.
---
But I‚Äôm guessing you just want to camp hooks with iri head huntress and not have survivors spoil your fun by disconnecting right?
---
If there was no in game BP cap, people would farm. A lot.
---
lmao
---
Not everyone uses Ethernet? And I was assuming you meant unplugging your router not unplugging your ethernet cable.

You could also just turn off your wifi, but that's still a decent amount of hoops to jump through that only the most dedicated of Dcers will do.

Thats such a dumb fucking defence it biggles my mind. ‚ÄúJust sit there for 2 minutes while the other guy gets his kicks‚Äù.
---
Its pointless. Its literally a waste of someones time, even if its only 2 minutes. Its 2 minutes I could have spent doing something else.
---
But it needs to be left in why? Just so people can troll? Just so you can slug a guy and make him bleed out to compensate for you being picked on at school?
---
Idiot. Just give the survivors a bleedout button and problem solved.
---
same here xD
---
Tokens? Hope does not have tokens. Hope has a 120 timer where you have +7% movement speed as a survivor. The timer starts from the moment the exit gates are powered and after that timer is over, you lose that 7% speed boost
---
What i find even more noticable, is red ranking on console, where the framerate is your bighest enemyüòÖ
---
Legion is far from the weakest killer.
---
Proud of you bb
---
Forget about the lore and edgy nu-metal design, pick a killer whos power you actually enjoy. You‚Äôre playing in first person anyway.
---
Here's an idea; just turn up your brightness a bit more, and she won't be that well hidden anymoreüôà

Ooh, I was automatically thinking hope was short for devour hope, forgot it was its own perk.
---
Doesnt really work considering billys chainsaw hitbox is fucking ridiculous.

This is one tier list I really like. I agree with most all of it, but might put Michael at the bottom. His character concept is 'ultimate evil personified.'

All Coldwind maps suck.

Disturbed Ward's main building is horrific.

Might as well bring the ebony. From my experience the ttv guys mostly play swf, normally a low rank swf member so they can bully low rank killers too.
---
I did see a tweet a while back that had bhvr tagged along with something involving stranger things, but I'm unable to look for it atm. Sorry.

You could probably say this is as about as much confirmation Ghostface had before he was leaked, since it started with a tweet. Unofficial, but still holds some weight.

---
Or when they call you NOED using trash after getting a 4k without even needing to use NOED, and they're running perks like Adrenaline, makes me chuckle as I say ggez and move on
---
I'm not sure if you're joking or not :D Hag and Spirit are omega easy to do but I really struggle with Trapper's daily since nobody wants to step in my traps &lt;/3
---
They were making a tab specific to new lore they were adding called "The Archieve." You complete a pseduo story mode (in game challenges, no difference in gameplay) and unlock more lore iirc
---
And this is why I was saying in the other thread that perhaps dbd isnt in the best position to punish disconnects right now. The game still has a lot of issues.
---
Learning to make a good game (trapper teaches jason)
---
OHHHH THAT SOUNDS AWESOME. I've been wanting more lore for this game!!!
---
I partially agree with you, huntress is a pain to play on console, but don't forget nurse. You simply have the framerate and lack of precise aiming against you too.
---
I think LF is just a fun to play killer, and takes time to master..... some times you win, some times you lose, there are much more factors that work against you besides the killer you choose....
---
99% of Leatherface players are going for BBQ and Chili, the remaining 1% is split between mains and people trying him out
---
What part of the community saying he good in the hood?
---
Map Pressure - Billy
---
Facecamping - Leatherface
---
It's going to be great. If the graphics for the tab will be what they showed off on the 3rdy live stream, then I'm extra hyped.
---
The streamers I like are the ones who play in a sporting way. Ones where you learn new tricks on how to git gud as killer.
---
These ones where its just a 2000 hour swf bullying noob killers... I really dont get why people enjoy watching that shit.
---
Not joking, I have a hard time completing hag's and spirit's
---
A real pain in the ass? 
---
OoO, DS, BT, Dead Hard + insta heal or a flashlight.
---
Shhh, don't let the devs know about a bug that helps killers. üòÜ
---
so you have that too?
---
Same. The last one gets the hatch if they aren't toxic
---
That's vile
---
What game?
---
I use their abilities, but it's hard to get a hit in within the time limit for me. I often screw up the initial swing
---
See ya in top
---
I always let the last one escape. I make sure to down them beforehand though because back when I didn't they called me a noob in post-game chat.
---
The last one is disturbing :D
---
Nea tried to help you and you attacked them?
---
Man rescuer would be so good. I RELY on those scratch marks my dude. xD

---
Increases movement speed when all gens are powered. 5/6/7%
---
Now that I think of it, same goes for Freddy. I am not exactly sure, but I thought that all you had to do was put 4 people to sleep
---
You can gry Horrorfield for now, its like dbd with low budget but still playable
---
Same people who are demanding that the new Freddy is op and needs to be nerfed; it's mainly low ranked survivors, or survivors who get high by bullying low rank killers and doing toxic things.  I think Ghostface is good, I wouldn't change anything about the way he plays right now, he's definitely not overpowered if you know what you're doing against him. Some people just dont like that there's new mechanics they're not used to and make everyone else suffer by complaining, because the devs only seem to listen to rank 20s for advice...
---
I usually cannot tell whether they know where the hatch is. If it looks like they are searching for it, I struggle because the killer tends to stay close to me. If it looks like they found it, I stop struggling. I also stop struggling when the teammate is going for the save and they don't know that the killer is right there (due to Insidious or because it's Amanda or Danny). Better to die than to let the last one get close and get ambushed by the killer
---
Good drawing, but does not look like feng
---
Yes, it's an issue that's happened for many killers.
---
Right I'd definitely buy them too, But I wonder if they could even get the license for these outfits, it's probably wishful thinking though.
---
we can make arrangements. don't worry, i'm a shirtless david main.
---
Hee hee hee

Great Artwork. Thanks for the submission.
---
The current Freddy is already better
---
I appreciate the mantle of responsibility symbol on Michael's shoulder
---
Amen. And if you are the one getting off the hook, injured of course, then I'll take the sure takedown and hook you again. Simple. This community is more toxic than the LoL and CoD community combined, no shit.
---
After encountering incredibly shitty teammates and terrible killers, I have been playing only killer for a solid week
---
Luckily toxicity is less common on consoles due to no ingame chat. It‚Äôs always joy when a survivor takes the time to enter in your gamertag and message you though. I have a simple name so I get them often and it makes me giddy every time
---
Guess what? Your grammar STILL sucks and you‚Äôre STILL gay. I didn‚Äôt even bother to read your little issues you got goin on there. Sounds like you‚Äôre confused. Should probably figure it out bub.
---
That ain‚Äôt dope
---
That is dope dope dope
---
All the killers on the list had a chance to be something different at some point in their life, Billy never had a chance. Since he was born he was doomed, being walled all his life and knowing nothing but loneliness, rejection and pain it's no wonder he is completely feral, the sole fact that he didn't die while growing up is a miracle.
---
Boohoo
---
My brightness is always up tho lmao
---
When you use legions power and mark all players you not only delay them with mending, they are also injured, so they either waste time healing or are oneshot for a 115% killer.
---
Leatherface may have a onehit power, but it's near useless unless you are in a deadzone. Have anything vaultable in the surrounding and the power becomes completly useless.
---
Also legion has some interesting play with perks like STBFL. Stabbing everyone really quickly and getting stacks super fast and then basically double hitting people without much chance of getting to safety after the first hit.
---
While leatherfaces most quoted recent idea is play with your food, which is quite shit in comparison. (Loose the obsession a few times and then lose stacks from chainsawing)
---
The photo is mirrored.
---
Ooof
---
Because looping killers is easy enough as it is without a 15% speed boost. Most people who complain about getting hit after a vault don‚Äôt know the required distance needed to perform a safe, fast vault. There are some cases where latency is involved but i‚Äôd wager most people just don‚Äôt know that you can still be hit on the other side when your feet touch the ground.
---
Unpopular opinion but it's true. As someone who used to play Identity V before buying DBD, Identity V encourages teamwork way more simply because if you are the only one who escapes, you don't win. In DBD, you do get rewarded for altruism but it still values surviving more. It doesn't matter how many of you survive, what matters is I'd you survived. In Identity V, you gain points for winning, which means that the majority of you survived, also gain points for a tie, which means 2 survive and 2 die, and you get nothing (you might even lose points) for only one surviving. That means that you actively have to try to work together and value one another more than yourself
---
Yup, it's even more obvious than Doctor's daily :D
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that isn‚Äôt confirmed, but if you can prove me wrong that would be awesome. Although it‚Äôd be dope if we were getting a Stranger Things Chapter, but it was 13. Star Court mall would be such a cool map.
---
Jesus. You sound like a religion more than a sexual preference tbh. How about you stop trying to be proud of what you are, and understand people are gonna use the word gay in a derogatory manor no matter how you feel about it. You‚Äôre gay (as in stupid) just for your simple confused mind to comprehend. Bye probably mid 20‚Äôs thing.
---
Watch out for that crutch perk haunted grounds though.
---
Perhaps he asked the Entity to be that big. "Daddy Entity can you pls make me a big boi, other killers shove me into lockers for being a smol twiggy nerd UwU"
---
&gt;Because bhvr isn't don't much till nothing with reports, and ragequitting.....
---
To being with, you aren't supposed to report DCing anyway... The system that bans people for that offense is automated. 
---
Reporting only creates unnecessary tickets for them to immediately discard.
---
True!
---
I kind of like the idea of Hope as if you can outrun a teammate you won't be the first one to go down.
---
I hate The Game a loz more. I actually like crotus prenn. Cornfields...idc tbh
---
Isn't Freddy only a pedophile in the latest version though isnt he? Thats not cannon?
---
Wow this is incredible!
---
Things I've tried to "fix" it.
---
- Installing the latest audio/gfx drivers
---
- Validating game files
---
- Relocating install folder (from HDD to SSD, still experiencing terrible FSP drops and audio problems)
---
- Checking temperatures (HDD, CPU, GPU were all fine)
---
I tend to 2-4k quite comfortably, at rank 1, not even trying all that hard. So do countless streamers I watch, and those that try hard even with such ease and consistency that I get bored of watching them. It is totally possible, and so maybe more of a "you" problem if you really are this hard-pressed to have success. And while people have been arguing about "power role" and "survivors should be afraid" ever since the game released, you indeed just have to accept that this is a multiplayer video game, not a genuine horror experience, and the gameplay is what it is. If you don't enjoy the more "stressful" gameplay type of killer, then maybe it's just not for you.
---
Queue times are indeed bad, but that's also due to how many people play killer, disproportionate (not in a 1:4 ratio) to survivor, meaning people seem to enjoy playing killer, often even more-so than survivor. Which, the solo survivor experience can be quite awful, and I guarantee that your survivor games are not chill and easy wins all the time, by much of any stretch. Don't get me wrong, I do know the killer experience can be quite awful, as well, but this idea akin to that you are constantly drowning and fighting for air and games end in 5 minutes and survivors are still taunting and trolling, is just something I mostly see purported by sub-500 hours killer players on reddit, when the reality I see in my games and on twitch, is that killers can do quite well quite consistently. Seeing some killer streamers 4k with only 1-3 gens done, hours upon hours on end, and then coming to reddit and seeing so many apparently hopelessly lost and overwhelmed killer players, just is always a little... funny. There are BS elements on both sides, and I do think the core balance is more so tilted in survivor favor, if you have 5 equally skilled and experienced players playing hard to win, but not tremendously so, it will still be competitive and challenging for both sides even then - and in the majority of public matchmaking matches, survivors really are not that good, let alone all four of them. Again, good killers 4k like 80% and more of their games, if they try to.
---
Serves you right for chaseing as freddy in his current state. You should be dishing out sleep on multiple survivors and useing the dream transition invisibility phases to mindgame them for hits as well as useing his aura reading and smaller terror radius for ambushes and rotations.
---
*cries*

I escape the majority of my matches with Urban. Self care is much more of a waste of time
---
"I take you home. You husband now."
---
If they are good you just loose, it's as simple as that. Bad game design.  
---
You may do something as Nurse or Spirit or capitalize on their altruism if they are too cocky about it. But if they are well coordinated and know how to loop/do gens you don't stand a chance.
---
Urban is wayyyyy better than Self Care my guy. With bond I just run to a teammate and have them heal me. Plus urban works great with sprint Burst which is the only reason I run Urban to begin with
---
I don't know why everyone thinks Whispers is so good on Huntress, there are way better perks to use.

Well it‚Äôs part of the risk, get behind a cover and reveal him

---
Swap Meg with Nea.
---
Because Bubba and Trapper exist and are infinitely weaker? Also I'd say Legion is a bit better than Doc.
---
I stream when I play and I'm not a jerk! Though no one watches me and I'm also not a superb survivor! I mess up constantly...wait where was I going with this? Oh right shameless self promotion of myself even though my reddit name isnt my twitch name and you have no way of finding me
---
You don‚Äôt even need to hook someone else first. If you are the first one found after an unhook, and the killer didn‚Äôt actually see the unhook to know where you both went, that isn‚Äôt tunneling.
---
Survivors are annoying to play against, remove them please
---
I'm a dickhead for sharing the original creators post because you never credited? Okay then, chief.
---
That's actually possible?
---
I love this game but you are totally right...most toxic community ever.
---
I always get mad and I always want to scream at the other survivors when this happens. But as a 27-year-old guy with a little family and a few hundred hours of DbD I just can't do that.
---
Try using bond to find a teammate. That, plus being able to see what your teammates are doing is a huge help. Are they on a gen nearby? Tag team it. Are they running around frantically? The killer is probably on them. Are they crouching in a corner? They‚Äôre doing gens, you?
---
BRUHH
---
Did I miss a meta or something? Like... do we call it stabby stabby or knife? I don't know anymore!
---
A full heal has needed 16 charges ever since they increased the heal time
---
Thanks for letting me know!
---
Yeah it‚Äôs usually the survivors fault if they end up in a situation like that.
---
Im not being sarcastic either thats actually really helpful to know
---
They are actually.
---
But why waste your unbreakable on a situation where you could be picked up by another survivor? I'd save that for a dire situation. Like most of the team is down and the killer is hunting the last one, or at the end of the game, you are on the ground and the killer is chasing out the other survivors through the gates. 
---
Also you can't heal while spinning so you are wasting your time as well in order not to waste the teams time (and probably your perk).
---
I'd rather take a spinning survivor as 'i'm 99ed, come pick me up'
---
Yeah that's also something I noticed. Usually there are 3 rank 1-5 survivors with one being 18-20. Also another mate of mine picked up the game in the current steam summer sale and instead of being matched against the usual 9-12 killers my mates and I usually play against we just get really bad rank 20 killers everytime we play with this guy... odd but thats just the way it is i suppose.
---
Claud is B
---
I like the last one. It could be good with Mettle of Man I think. In general, the last one is an overall decent perk. These are the most balanced perks I have seen so far.
---
The life of a socially awkward cosplayer
---
I think you may be the one projecting.
---
A bunch of people downvoted like every comment??
---
Socially awkward cosplayer harassed by horror fan
---
Pair it with Dance With Me (Kate perk). Can be great for losing the killer!
---
That's not the point
---
I use self care all the time. I use empathy a lot as well. BK is also ok. Why do you think she is B? I would love to hear your thoughts!
---
What
---
Couple goals tbh. This is what I want.
---
what's your twitch
---
Same honestly
---
This is why they need to allow killers to opt out against SWF
---
Bt is not too bad.
---
Sc is bad takes waaay too long.
---
And empathy just isn‚Äôt that great. I‚Äôd run Bond or Aftercare instead of empathy.
---
Fuck Jane I guess
---
It stays like that till it will create a lobby. There has been many posts about killer waiting times so you may have a good wait.
---
Agreed. My guess is we're getting Pinhead for chapter 14. There are no well known survivors to come with a Pinhead chapter, and although it's a shame, the Labyrinth would be difficult to create as a map.
---
Lol i find all of her perks very niche
---
We weren't SWF, but I get what you mean, totally unfair to be queued against a rank 7 at rank 14, also vice versa, it wasn't fair for me to have to play with rank 20s as a rank 7.
---
I know, and i meaned to say that by seperating those two. So reports, and disconnects to clarify
---
OH SHIT I FORGOT HER. ok well shes a b or c lol
---
Yeah bond is better. I like sc a lot though because i like to bring flashlights or toolboxes or keys instead of med kits.
---
If I change my region then download the game, would I be able to switch my region back without any issue? Or should I just keep the change as long as I want to play?
---
This is why reddit needs a "mute everything this person says"-option.
---
David is S tier for his dead hard and Were gonna live forever
---
 No they aren‚Äôt
---
We're gonna live forever is *okay* when your farming bloodpoints. The only reason he's in A is because of dead hard. Though at higher ranks it kind of sucks because the killer knows when you're gonna use it and for me personally i can never get to use it right. No mither is ass
---
&gt;Or they are stuck in a locker and cant get out even when the killer opens it? Don't DC! You need to think of the other players!
---
You're literally just making up scenarios that noone has ever said it's toxic to DC over and using that as justification so that BHVR won't punish the people that openly brag about DC'ing.
---
Noone is saying that the survivor who quits 1/200 of his matches when a gamebreaking bug occurs is toxic, they're talking about the survivors that disconnect literally any match where they're the first to be downed, or the killers that DC when they end up on a map that's slightly hard for their killer. Especially the toxic killer streamers that openly brag about disconnecting to waste survivor's offerings. That's who these changes will deal with.
---
Same
---
Well I can see why you put Dwight in A tier now lol
---
I really like bond and his other perks are good for gen rushing.
---
What was so bad about what I posted?
---
That‚Äôs not always the case. At least not with matchmaking. I never play SWF, and lately I‚Äôve been the only one ranked as the killer player with level 18 -20 ranked players.
---
I‚Äôm currently ranked 9. Needless to say matches don‚Äôt last long when that happens. Matchmaking is awful in this game.
---
"It was too hard to break him out" as per every person saying so in the first week of his release. Stealth isnt a real option as killer and the devs should know that.
---
I've had quite a few of games like this recently, it's strange.
---
Give me all the Adults please. Fuck I wouldn‚Äôt care if we got Smirnoff lol. 
---
I don‚Äôt care if we got a single survivor but skins of all the adults so they don‚Äôt have to make 12+ perks and 4+ survivors.
---
Also I would rather have the Mind Flayer if anything. But I agree.
---
I also tried to avoid putting survivors in S tier just because they had 1 fantastic perk. I tried to pick them vased on how many good perks they had. Meg has 2 fantastic perks and one good one, claudette has 1 god tier perk 1 great perk and 1 decent perk, and nea has balanced landing (best perk in the game imo) urban evasion and streetwise (streetwise is okay?). David only really has one fantastic perk. Thats why hes in A.
---
Might be an iPhone thing, works fine on my android.

Nope.

---
I hit em with a ‚Äúgot em‚Äù everytime
---
Yea saying sprint burst is good just shows that you‚Äôre new. And balanced landing is the best perk in the game I agree
---
Me too. Yesterday was the only day where it wasn‚Äôt so bad and that was on Xbox. It‚Äôs been awful on PC and since the update my game has been crashing mid match. 
---
There are AAA developers that can‚Äôt get match making right. Both DICE and Treyarch run circles around this team and in Battlefield and COD is just as bad.
---
I'm talking about these babykillers who want to literally remove SWF because they're bad at the game, legit seen guys with 30 hours who never even reached rank 10 on either side parrot this ridiculous idea.
---
All of dwight‚Äôs perks are medicore. He‚Äôs B tier at most only because of Bond.
---
I'm a rank 8. I personally don't really like sprint burst. I do think its a decent perk. All exhaustion perks are pretty good tbh.
---
Idk man i put this together after like 5 minutes of thought
---
Except for sprint burst. It used to be the best perk in the game but now it‚Äôs only used by urban evasioners.
---
I feel like Aftercare could replace both Autodidact and Empathy and free up a fourth slot.
---
This isn't toxic lmao
---
If you wanna know my actual build that i run is DS, Balanced Landing, Borrowed Time (or adrenaline if i dont care about being altruistic), and Self Care (or deliverence if im bored)
---
He's not?
---
I fuq nibbas up with Trapper at red ranks, overall good list tho
---
All the killers so far have been human, it wouldn‚Äôt fit the game if it was an actual monster.
---
I just got back into this game like 2 weeks ago after not playing since 2018. I haven't used sprint burst so im not to experienced with how it is now
---
Honestly, there's so much survivor choice in Stranger Things, I just fail to see how the Demogorgon's power could fit
---
Don‚Äôt listen to him, he believes Dead Hard is is S tier.
---
Tbh i dont really run dead hard so i cant really rank it fairly
---
I didnt put it at S because its easy to counter if you're a good killer
---
If you play on console, sure, then it's a big deal. If you accomplish anything on console it's a big deal, lol.
---
it's gonna be a small event with two shitty cosmetics
---
I was the survivor...
---
Let alone being a monster and not a Hooman. Bright side is a Demogorgons body structure is that of a human while The mindflayers isn‚Äôt. 
---
But I could see dbd working something out just for us and stranger things.
---
Nurse mains: I'm just gonna teleport to survivors general direction and wiggle my mouse, someone is getting hit.
---
This is outright false. For one simple example to prove as much, Huntress has been substantially buffed just a few days ago.
---
This aura bug by the way has been here before too, and is now back. Decisive Strike sometimes simply won't work, either when within hooking prompt, or sometimes simply not freeing you for no apparent reason at all - imagine the sheer outcry if NOED sometimes simply did not activate, despite there being a dull totem left on the map, or sometimes simply not downing a survivor in one hit, despite being active. It would be fixed within days, because of that outcry. Yet there is no urgency to fix DS, and no outcry. Same for this bug.
---
Either way, survivor gameplay has been consistently nerfed for about two years straight, and killer gameplay has been directly and indirectly buffed, mostly. https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bi1ehq/i_got_banned_by_steam_community_and_offical_forum/?st=jxsvr28c&amp;sh=89bf6cd7 That thread compiled some of that trend, which has been continuing. Spirit was buffed considerably from PTB and initial live release, and is now the second-strongest killer character in the game. And just in recent memory, survivor vault mechanics have been nerfed substantially, Mettle Of Man - which was the first metagame-relevant survivor perk to have been released in two years, by the way - has been killed, Coldwind tiles have been shut close, Lery's window spawns have been made less random, creating lots of unsafe setups, pallet spawn algorithms have been adjusted, which as Shelter Woods shows, has reduced pallets overall, Ghostface was buffed from the initial PTB design, most significantly the stalk meter now not decaying, which makes it basically impossible to prevent becoming Exposed, totem spawns have been adjusted, hiding them better and preventing them from spawning in survivor Line-of-Sight, the Collapse has been introduced, Trapper and Wraith got reworks...
---
That doesn‚Äôt always happen and good survivors can wait read the bait
---
I think if they made Wake Up! the same as the bugged state, AFTER the gens were powered, it would actually be usable. It would fit with the theme, and it would make the late game a bit easier. Wake Up! was meant to counter Remember Me (somewhat), but ultimately, it just doesn't justify sacrificing a perk slot to something ONLY effective after the gens are powered and/or the hatch is closed. Adrenaline is so powerful because you play without a perk the whole game...using Wake Up! doesn't grant you that power. So, healing, sabotage, cleansing, vaulting speed increased by 15% *after* the gens are powered, wouldn't be that bad. It might be a bit broken, sure, but it would be a hell of a lot better than a whole 3 seconds faster of an exit gate opening.
---
swap Bill with Nea (which the only good perk Nea has is BL and Bill has 2 great perks) and Laurie with Claudette (i feel like her perks make you lose a lot of time while Laurie has 2 godly perks)
---
For example, Killers just wasting time in End Game Collapse for no reason when they could have hooked you but didn't do so just to piss you off, or slugs.
---
Not if killer has ears lol.
---
It should be it really early in the build so I would think so.
---
It hasn't been confirmed, and seeing as Fortnite got the Demogorgan, well doubtful entirely. More than likely BHVR is collaborating to make a Stranger Things game.
---
Freddy is still at the bottom of every tier list *sad cowboy emoji*
---
This is the
---
Whats bills other great perks? I thought borrowed time was great but not the others. Also yeah I should have rated laurie higher. Object and DS are fantastic
---
Alot of things aren't fair in this game that actually could be fixed, SWF is unfair but it's never gonna be removed for very obvious reasons and if you can't figure out those reasons on your own AND you're rank 15, maybe less talking about nerfing everything because u lost once and more practicing the game yeah?
---
Oh yeah I didn't mean it doesn't mean we could I just meant that fortnite x dbd is still a thing that could happen just because bhvr could use it to try to get more players since fortnite is so big also I wouldn't mind that since I do enjoy fortnite would love a huntress and legion skin would be nice
---
Not sure if the bolognese code will be able to handle such
---
Holy shit this is amazing.
---
People will still complain lol
---
Also how can it be incorrect? It's my opinion?
---
why tho?
---
Do you mean that DbD is badly coded?
---
Power: A fucking fist.
---
you literally have doctor as a top 5 killer rofl
---
She looks like Alita from Alita: Battle Angel
---
Well at they time I thought she was messing with me, but maybe 30 seconds after she got healed and did the same thing. I ended up leaving the glitch once I caught her while she was vaulting.
---
"Sometimes gens go too fast to play nice"
---
Dude just fucking slugs you through a wall. Picks up Dwight, uses him to beat Meg.
---
Works everytime
---
&gt;Only run when you don't hear a heartbeat
---
Or when you are in a chase... üòÇ
---
I think that sounds good, but the sabotage part isn‚Äôt really necessary since no one really does that and it doesn‚Äôt even give you points. I also think they should keep the exit gate opening speed, and buff it a little, maybe tier three gives 25% faster speed for opening gates because there‚Äôs always the possibility you get stopped right at the gate because you‚Äôre injured or because of noed and that can help with that. Also, did you mean adrenaline is powerful despite playing almost the whole game without a perk?
---
????????????? No? I didn't? He's not a top five. I never said he was a top five? Do you know how these tier systems work?
---
I'm down. Do it before I go to work is my only request xD
---
As salty as dying first and quick makes me, it's usually because I got farmed by the dumbass who didn't wait for the killer to leave.  And while I rage about it, deep down I know it's not the killer's fault.  I swear, some of the potatoes who play this game need to learn what a "safe" and an "unsafe" save is.
---
How do you moonwalk? I can do 180s and 360s but not moonwalks
---
yes cancels rescue and triggers adrenaline, but lets also make it that it still does damage because they deserve it
---
Yeah could you imagine being permanently stuck with the crouch vision of Pig or Ghostface? 
---
Have fun watching the grass grow
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature
---
Cry in a corner?

I wish people would understand others points of view. I play survivor quite a bit too and if i die, well I'm just unlucky/ not good enough/ maybe i had a bad game.

Balanced Landing definitely needs to be added to Vault and Vanish. Dead Hard too
---
Marguerite would be much better sir to her uniqueness. Otherwise go to RE2 and use Mr X, with Leon Kennedy as the survivor. I‚Äôd prefer the latter tbh
---
 Nah ghostface isn‚Äôt S, A or B maybe
---
Does Huntress hatchers work with sloppy too? Because I thought otherwise which is why she has addons for it.
---
I always thought Slenderman would be an awesome addition
---
I mean it's a opinion. Not everyone Is gonna agree.
---
I think you are on to something.
---
And you know what? 2 days to justify an negative action is so hilarious. I'm actually laughing so fucking hard right now. What? You ask your kiddo friends to give you an advice how to insult people on the internet to look cool? Or your parent that don't know how to respect other people properly? =))) What a pericious thing!
---
I play with a friend in the lobby shown, level 16. We consistently come up against really bad killers and very nooby survivors who can hardly play the game and never do gens or do very little to contribute to the team. Why do we consistently get put with people at least 15+ every game?
---
You‚Äôll get used to it. Why do you care if you get karma for your opinion or not? That shouldn‚Äôt prevent you from saying it, whether you‚Äôre in the right or not. 
---
BTW: David King is definitely not S tier just because of Dead Hard.
---
It‚Äôs less opinion and more factual. Factual is Nurse and Spirit are SS but Billy is A.
---
Doctor is D.
---
But that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt post tier lists of anything. Never! Unless you can gather evidence and back yourself off evidence.
---
Yes huntress hatchets do apply sloppy butcher.
---
Me: I see nothing out of the ordinary
---
Not necessarily... he could have hatch, as far as I know hatch still works with that glitch
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted so much, people need to understand that when the killer hooks a survivor and leaves you don't just immediately unhook them.  
---
You wait and finish whatever gen you're doing, because the killer will be close to the hook and guess what, if you unhook the survivor, the killers going to come right for you.
---
It's a great combo especially combined with m&amp;a, allowing you to sneak up on people while they're healing
---
Yeah I'm not gonna post any tier lists again. I didn't want any karma but I didn't expect to lose like 60 karma lol.
---
The Clown's skin and pose goes so well with the sarcastic vibe of the title
---
Thanks for sharing, now I know its possible
---
True lol. I'm just gonna stick to trying to be helpful instead haha
---
David King is more A in my opinion. One perk shouldn‚Äôt bring you to S tier. But he‚Äôs A because one perk is a staple in many builds. So he‚Äôs very useful in that regard.
---
Imagine thinking this is toxic
---
Yes, now i am not a code specialist or something but from what we are seeing everyday that could be the case. Now i don't know to what extend they can pull out really good and fascinating results. The fact that they are still providing for the game, i love it.
---
Nice cosplay hope the best for you
---
Even when you murdering never forget to take your vitamins kids.
---
Centimeters per second? Wow, that puts them at an almost literal snails pace
---
I had a group of streamers who complained i tunneled one of them, and the one i said it to i was chasing for like 10 seconds. They also hated that I used an ebony mori. Saying that I hated streamers and refused to give them content. Like that's my job üòÇ
---
I switch my region to Denmark to be able to download it.
---
I can agree on that. Dead Hard is useful in many situations, but as a whole he has no mither, so he can‚Äôt be S tier. And, well... we‚Äôre gonna live forever can be nice if you‚Äôre whoring for BP like me.
---
Oof
---
I don‚Äôt think she will be available at all on mobile. I don‚Äôt recall seeing her in the killer section.
---
I think this needs to be said. Survivors, sometimes you're just unlucky and get found, the killer doesn't always know where everyone is and just wants to get kills because that's their job. Killers, stop making decisions on how to play based on "toxic" behaviors like t-bagging or flashlights. Flashlights aren't toxic, it's a mechanic. And t-bagging is so dumb to be angry at so just ignore it or laugh along. And to everyone, stop being so damn rude to everyone in chat. The game is meant to be fun, and yeah it sucks to lose or maybe you wanna bully the killer for doing poorly or maybe you really hate one survivor for playing well against you but man just be kind. Thank you for attening my TedTalk.
---
Sacrifice me now instead
---
Thought i now have someone who is jus  like me
---
I wouldn't pit doctor that high. He can track well and interrupt some loops, but other than that he doesn't have much going for him...
---
That thumb is dangerously close to her ass.
---
Just saying..
---
For vault and vanish i would replace Dance with Me for Lightweight. If you know the maps well enough identifying windows is easy and having 2 second scratch marks will REALLY make you disappear.
---
Even better, ignore the toxicity and move on. It's impossible to change a commuinity because games like this attract people who like to grief. You can't change other people but you can change your own attitude. Brush that shit off your shoulder and keep going, don't let griefers win by getting upset. OchiDo' s entire YouTube channel is him being toxic and he has a sub count of 300k. That says something :p help yourself, not others :)
---
If you don't have an obsession based perk, you can still be chosen to be the obsession if the (a) the killer has one and (b) if no other survivor is running one. 
---
Any benefits of being the obsession depends on the perk. For killer sided perks, Dying Light gives you the ability to perform altruistic actions faster (unhooking, healing). If the killer runs Remember Me and you get hit, every other survivor takes longer to open the exit gates but you. 
---
Go into Kill Your Friends and switch between survivor and killer to get a better understanding of obsession perks and their effects. Every perk is available for view in that mode.
---
Only faggots need karma anyways
---
_Sweet home Alabama_
---
True. I spent like 5 minutes on this lol
---
If this is a real roblox game then it interested
---
Karma doesn't mean anything, people downvoted to feel like they have control over something :P don't worry about it. Besides David isn't S teir because he is so loud as a character. Deadhard is good thou, but no mither is a meme level perk :P move on and don't worry about it!
---
The Collector would be neat, but might end up being a rehash of Trapper and Pig.
---
Technically leatherface's map is grim pantry
---
Billy isn't better than Nurse or in SS tier, put him in S tier. Hag should be S tier and Huntress should be A tier, because Hag counter looping better than Huntress and she isn't as map dependent as Huntress. Yeah, Hag has bad maps too, but Huntress literally has maps where it's worth to DC from them.
---
To be fair, rank 20s are probably the majority of their playerbase (or you know, somewhere near that range of ranks). I personally think it still makes more sense to shape the game based on feedback from players who *actually know what's going on* but I imagine it would be difficult to get them to listen to anything besides the majority.
---
Yeah they are really heard for me.i imagine playing billy without any addons is hard for new players.

&gt;"Should Huntress mains be rewarded for fantastic aim"
---
Considering current hatchet hitbox is a basketball, you don't need a "fantastic aim" to hit survivors on the head. 
---
https://www.twitch.tv/scottjund/clip/SparklyWealthyOrcaKappaRoss
---
It comes from my potato computer
---
If you're having problems tracking them down after you attacked them, take bloodhount with you. i use it too, it's great to keep track of the survivors.
---
There is no learning the hitboxes cause they would be inconsistently fucky. 
---
Huntresses can already get free hits behind soft cover if they aim slightly over a survivors head. Giving free iridescent heads for hatchets that shouldn't hit in the first place would be *fucked*
---
Hitboxes are already as messed up as is
---
damn thanks for the advice!
---
Exactly. Legions first hit is free, and its rasy to run around and hit all the survivors. At which point they either spend the entire game healing or they run around injured all game.
---
Toxic game has toxic reddit community. Are you surprised? People here are so fragile.
---
i have spine chill doe
---
Well with an update like that I am also inferring that a hitbox rework would be made. Like what if the hitboxes were much smaller with the huntress thus good aim would actually be needed?

Maybe he didn't see the baby worth his time? That scene could be taken either way through I believe the writers said the reason why he didn't kill the baby because it was an ethical issue.
---
It also had a timer because it was released when NoED was a timer, I'm not sure how it'd balance out if it didn't have a timer since killers can't cleanse it
---
candle wraith owo
---
But then couldnt this just promote face camping? Why is it fair if a killer is camping, and I have BT and I know the other guy has DS, to go insta down because of a perk? 
---
Sounds awful tbh.
---
It‚Äôs a 4:1 ratio between killers and survivor per match. So if the player base were 50:50 killer mains and survivor mains that means 75% of killers have to wait their turn

Thank you. Long time ago that I saw that movie but only the first one.

Bruh^2
---
Until they give points for being camped at a hook, expect it to continue because unless you're an SWF, he has two options for depipping, now or 5 minutes later.
---
I am obsessed with his newest skin. It‚Äôs so cool. Like, it‚Äôs what I dreamed of before we could even get skins.

Ffs yes, me (rank 5) friend (rank 5) qued against a clown (rank 10) and had 2 rank 13 survivors for teammates

and now that i look at it again i realize that scooby do is a survivor xD

Paging /u/epicgamer_1812

For medkits, the best add ons are insta heals, extra charges and increased healing speed

For toolboxes, extra charges, increased speed and efficiency

For flashlights, increased seconds or time and low Amp filaments

I believe they made it, accidentally or not, muffled by generator sounds and wall obstacles.
---
I don't blame people for dying on hook. Videogames are meant to be fun and if someone isn't having fun then they shouldn't keep playing. Some killers are really no fun to go against :P
---
I survivor main mostly but when I do play killer I like to make the match enjoyable and profitable for everyone. To me it‚Äôs about points not ‚Äúwinning‚Äù so I purposely don‚Äôt hook, only chase and not hit, stalk, let the last survivor get the hatch, etc. Unless it‚Äôs down to one gen and I haven‚Äôt had a single hook yet, I need my points too!
---
I'm not a big fan, it just looks like a pile of sticks :P
---
I know this is highly unlikely due to whatever deal was made to get 2010 Freddy in the game over England. I'm sure this kind of cosmetic would require to negotiations with New Line or coukd cost more etc but I'm still hoping for some kind of cosmetic change up costume options and faces
---
he's been playing alive for daytime
---
Map pressure is everything. Keep them from doing gens at all costs.
---
Dying over and over is part of being a survivor main.
---
The saboteur buff could easily backfire as a popular strategy is a 4 man SWF sabotage build with anti slug perks.
---
True... maybe 50/60/70 would be better.
---
He couldn't move, he was completely stuck
---
Yeah he would tell her: hey mind if I grab you're ass?
---
The fallen opera something that goes along with the wraith x nurse ship thing
---
There‚Äôs a difference between a Claudette and a Blendette
---
Absolutely I like it almost as much as the original. Orobably tge only sequel I like lol
---
But from the advanced players I learn. So in my case, I like to be with advanced players in a match. I learn from what they do. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Assuming he is left-handed since he holds his knife in the left hand, it's actually on the good shoulder. Even thought killers in dbd carry on left shoulder, this one couldnt carry and hit someone at the same time, in case they bodyblock him, because he is a leftie.

Went against a Hillbilly yesterday and now I will never doubt the power of some random rocks and trees, they save lives.
---
This the type of creative freedom this sub needs! Fucking awesome piece, love how everthing around crosses over between the Disney tale and Dead by Daylight
---
I thought it was placed instantly and didn't slow at all when placed, it looked like he was still running at full speed with the target ready
---
Oh? You‚Äôre approaching me?
---
Once you get your first save they just don‚Äôt stop coming
---
Anymore the window is so small almost making flashlights useless these days. I get so many blinds but they dont drop.
---
As someone said before me, do you think if he was a stranger, she would have let him grab her ass? Of course no, unless she was a paid hooker. And I don't think she is a hooker since she is cosplaying as well(look at the fake cuts on her legs) .
---
Plus he came in to voice the, what? 5 lines he speaks in game? LOL
---
The games in the gutter glad I got out when I did
---
Almost dbdgonewild :p
---
All Coldwind maps suck. 
---
Disturbed Ward‚Äôs main building is absolutely horrible. A lot of Survivors will actually run there first no matter what and abuse it.
---
As a killer you can lunge to get out, I dont think you can do anything as survivor
---
My headcanon is that he thought that the baby was defenseless so it had no way to defend itself, so he spared it. kinda like how the Predator does.
---
I watch quite a lot of dead by daylight gameplay as well and look at best loadouts and stuff so I‚Äôm not suprised that I‚Äôve got a better game knowledge and ability than other newish players. I Probably should have took that into account I suppose.

Ive noticed it espeically when im hooked, absolutely no heartbeat. Its very strange.
---
respect for fire up
---
I'm already there, and theres no pill to swallow. It's literally impossible. You cant simply "apply pressure" unless you are playing a killer who has map pressure. Rather let me rephrase, you can only apply as much pressure as your chosen killer allows you to. Like to play leather face? Fuck you and your pressure because he is a 115 killer with a no boost punish saw. Playing nurse or Billy? Good for you, they can swiftly move around the map and apply pressure. There is no applying pressure with, doctor, we'll say. Thinking otherwise is naive.
---
Nah dude, you got that wrong. Wraith didnt know what was the deal with his boss, he found out only after seeing blood come from one of the cars.
---
Seeing his boss kill the man he just freed with no remorse and the revelation that every car he destroyed had one person in it drove vin over the edge.
---
Sry...I am knew to the game. Do you get the masks by killing a survivour a certain number of times or what?
---
I played this game after I saw your post and I set up an account too. First game as killer I found out  some survivors have legacy,  I went after one of the legacy survivors and I downed him.  After I downed him he missed his d strike and disconnected.  Everybody else died after that.  Great community 10/10
---
The Legion are actually my favorite killer, I play them all the time despite having never won (got 3/4 once though and maxed my chase bloodpoints, that was a fun game)
---
Im done you're making a huge deal out of something so fucking stupid, have a nice day.
---
It reminds me of Treasure planet or Atlantis :) definitely unique thou
---
Which means he was just waiting for that baby to grow up into the perfect teen to kill the whole time! He's been stalking that child like a tier 1 for YEARS! Who knew!?
---
Im a lefty but i cant use a left handed mouse or scissors because in kindergarten fhey forced me to learn ot right handed. Tried to get me to write right handed but it had little progress and went home crying to mom. Thanks Mrs. Moore, you have deproved me of my uniqueness.

Nah, you're the one making a big deal out of it by getting offensed he placed a hand on her ass.

You can switch it back.
---
They do have the likeness for Tapp I think.
---
Cheater shame shame shame shame
---
If someone does that, I wouldn‚Äôt call them friend.
---
This is what I do. I don't need to be fed free hooks to win a match.
---
Hooked a dude that was struggling, went away, guy goes for the save and I see scratch marks and hear the dude that got unhooked crouching behind a rock. Got messaged saying I was a bad killer.  Guy had ample chance to run the hell away.
---
Is this loss?
---
Lookin' for fellow PC players. I've been playing this game for a while but none of my friends want to play it, so I've unfortunately been going solo for my 600+ hours. I'm a gen jockey who's been getting better (I think) at running Killers around lately. My Steam username is **Varoun** and picture is a mask. Rank 12 or so I think at the moment, though I've been Rank 1 on multiple occasions - just haven't played enough to get back up there this reset.
---
Leatherface looks pretty good.
---
So instead of having match time limits, a limit to how many times a Survivor can be healed, or diminishing returns from identical actions in a short period of time (I doubt many people get more than 3 consecutive hits or heals within a minute, but apologies to them), they punish people for playing normally?
---
16 I think
---
He‚Äôd be so short you‚Äôd get mindgamed around every loop and if you vault a window, he‚Äôd break LoS so hard. Whole killer hardcountered by Lery‚Äôs
---
I know people have gripes with this but I honestly didn't notice the change that much. A change to the original looking mask would be nice yes but I am also content with how it is now.
---
We all have that one friend...
---
Does anyone know if that will be like in Identity V (a mobile sort of DbD clone)?
---
Bro its the 2 killer glitch and BHVR needs to ban him now
---
The beta of the mobile version is out now, and it's ok.
---
I‚Äôm pretty new to the game, and tried killer for the first time Friday night. Felt really lost at first, and I got a lot of salt from survivors. I started to really hit my stride, though, and I ended up getting a 4K with 4 iridescent shards by the end of the night in one match. It was a lot of fun.
---
I never had this on Xbox. This seems closer to average  though. On PS4 is stupid how often I get matched up with a team where it's one rank 15 with 3 red ranks. Happened just about every match last night. I think most if not all we're SWF. It didn't matter for me, even though I'm ranked 10 on PS4, I rank 1 every time on Xbox. I'm not gonna lie, the skill between red ranks on PS4 is far worse than on Xbox. At least on Xbox they get gens done WITH Ruin, haven't needed Ruin and they rarely manage to get one Gen done.
---
New Killer: The Gorilla
---
Power: Gorilla Glue
---
No, she was trying. They were even spinning like we do lol.
---
You mean the one that sounds more like the Labryinth audio from Hellraiser?
---
I go for the fresh person out of courtesy, but I'm fully aware that's a tactical disadvantage, and if I can't find them, it's back to "stab the first person I see."
---
Why wouldn't it be?
---
Pig? Nurse? Legion? Trapper?
---
It makes perfect sense if he couldnt expose someone or the moment he was was revealed and he lost the exposed status on someone he would basically be a m1 killer with no reason to use his power.
---
I didn't realize Survivor pubs were also awful to each other. I thought mine were just bad.
---
The first character with actual voice lines, yup. Which I hope is a good sign for more to come! Imagine if we get voices for the killers for when they Mori or get a sacrifice... or added into the chase so they taunt you as they chase.
---
Leatherface has the exact likeness, Amanda looks better than the original pig outfit she wore.
---
My dad works for BHVR and he said so too!
---
It isn't as hard as you make it out to be. I haven't been playing the game for very long and i can still hit 99/100 saves. It's very consistent if you have decent ping. Saying flashlights are almost useless couldn't be more wrong.
---
I don't know about you, but I want The Thing to be a killer.
---
I love this lol
---
Okay, that was noob3 levels of cringe and I fucking love it.
---
Too bad it's hard to work with Valve.
---
How the hell did i get OFFENDED?
---
I once had a survivor stuck there, so I downed her and let her go but I was stuck also, then I figured that lunge can get you out.  Funny thing is she was spinning too lol.
---
What was the Linkin Park remix? I need that in my life.
---
It was one of the Dwights.
---
Honestly, *ahem*, Chucky would be sold short.
---
He and Freddy are fun movie characters because of their banter and MO. Freddy has no banter and is getting ONE dreamy thing he can do after the rework. A mute Chucky might as well be an original doll-killer, which I'd still be all for.
---
Or, if you actually read OP‚Äôs comment, you would know that they left them on the hook through both states and they died.
---
you gotta sacrifice 25 of a certain survivor, as leatherface, meaning the most likely to get would be claudette or meg, since they are almost garanteed to be played against every match
---
I would still prefer that over standing at the hatch for 20 minutes
---
Brings a tear to my eye
---
If you think about it, it's not like its a lootbox or having a % chance to get the skin
---
But he'd be small enough to juke. And maybe quick enough to shiv your ankle when you try.
---
Chucky always gets back up, but can you?
---
You have to doublepip or have 4 iridescent medals on your ranking screen at the end of the game. I may be wrong
---
thank you, i wanted leaderface because he's my favorite survivor (Dont judge me please) and i like that it gives leatherface a permanent frown
---
What about the guy from I know what you did last summer hook man idk if he had an actual name
---
I cannot disagree
---
It‚Äôs normal.
---
Nope. As you said he has no ultra rare addons so it makes sense. The only ultra rated that can really replace it is shards tovplay other characters.
---
Oh, that explains everything.
---
Maybe a bit shorter, but also no Terror Radius without line of sight. Ideally no Stain ever. You're allowed to know he's coming, but where from isn't a given in the movies.
---
Just stop getting found
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh5tBeVHqMM
---
I suggest horizontal hooks. Basically shrapnel on the ground. He just drags Survivors over them.
---
I‚Äôm the president and CEO of BHVR and I can confirm this is true.
---
Or, *orrrr*, maybe acting like an asshole gets you treated like an asshole?
---
Wow a noob3 knockoff that actually does it well.
---
Well deserved upvote coming your way
---
And before that we had Ash's chapter that released with only a survivor and no map or killer. Perhaps its a foreshadow for things to come? Is BHVR down scaling the content releases to focus on bug killing or minimalizing content in DLC to make more DLC to eek cash from us? Or something else...
---
But the Myers mask would have to pay William Shatner royalties. They also did not pay Robert Englund so that is why the model looks unique as Freddy. I am not trying to defend the art that is a different conversation. Leather face might have been a different negotiation because the actor was a producer as was Bruce Camble was for evil dead. So rights negotiations would be easier to cover as they could be one and the same. Those two both are one side only packs. So likeness could be the other half of the cost.
---
Can't wait for my nurse to hit 50 then..... *laughs in blink*
---
you have to double pip
---
I love the idea of the community crying because they're getting their ass kicked by a doll.
---
They updated the description to be accurate. It used to only require a 4K, (since back in the day a 4K WAS a merciless victory) Now a merciless victory means you have to double pip in order to get the achievement. Hope this helps
---
Cool! When we get back on we will add ya!
---
I generally will go after the other guy. I want people to have fun during the game and I know getting double hooked on the first five minutes isn't conducive to that. But to each their own.
---
Imagine people using resilience and spine chill with it, getting 30% faster vaults
---
I wouldn't mind it so much if I didn't have to mash space bar just incase...
---
I was still stuck, even after wiggling free which took forever because it was glitching lol. Idk if where my body was made he'd unable to lunge out or what. What's weird is I went to slide of the slide, lagged back, then fell down there and boom I'm stuck lol.
---
That was pretty great

Hillbilly isnt cheese
---
Went on a winning streak as Dwight last night where I escaped 5 or 6 games in a row. I had the same toolbox and addon equipped the whole time, so I thought of it as my lucky toolbox, since even in situations where I was hooked twice and few gens had been done I managed to get out. I eventually just stopped since I got attached to my toolbox and didn't want to lose it lol
---
I also got to red ranks as survivor for the first time since the ranking system update, so that was neat.
---
Yes, 100% agree.
---
So much YES
---
I was never able to get free :/ Just had to lay there lol.
---
;)
---
Probably because of the cannibal camping stigma.
---
Yes, and it was pretty fun so I couldn't even be mad!
---
Test
---
Me and a friend of mine who stream together laugh when ever someone pulls a mori on us because it's such a stigma, when ever we verse a supper meta build or a characters strongest build, we just laugh and go "well, yeah, that's what I expected"
---
Can they tell the difference between a normal DC and an Internet DC?
---
As a new killer this is annoying lmao
---
When I opened the gate and escaped and fixed gens and didnt got hooked. üòç

Thats funny. Really. Because I play both and your statement is 100% false.

Thats so weird, I really hope they fix it soon, but I doubt tho &gt;_&gt;

Been playing since 2017, guess ive adapted to the shitty framerate lol.
---
How is it worse? It slows them down and bit and more importantly it prevents fast vaults. 
---
IMO that soumds far better than hags default traps
---
Yeah: Neil Cicierega - The end
---
Give me a shamless link to more please
---
I also had a toolbox that I considered lucky! Got out with it about that many times too until I lost it :( you were right in protecting it
---
In my solo matches, usually the other three end up in the basement bc they tried to make risky saves without borrowed time and failed and I'm the one on the gen going "wtf guys" LOL. This is also pretty accurate though, I feel your pain.
---
Hallowed blight wraith.
---
Yah go figure since any other major bug takes weeks to fix or longer, if it had been killer sided bug we would have had to wait a few weeks before a patch, oh yah there is one now where the killers can see
---
You when your working on gens now! I bet that won‚Äôt be patched in 5 days!
---
Unfortunately üò™
---
Later bloodweb had only Deja Vu. Entity found a new way to steal my bloodpoints (those bloodwebs take more points, as they start locking stuff a while later)
---
Creative! lol okay family.
---
Isn;t it only a BETA for Apple at the moment?
---
Rank 3 stalker with over 3000hours in the bush.
---
He gets the best views.
---
What if when you entered stealth mode the lights turned off?
---
Trapper will be the weakest. Trapper has the much counter play in the game and he is the most add-on reliant killer in the game.
---
Yeah, a fair bit was similar to the stuff he uses in his videos, with the addition of putting sound effects and graphics over survivors. 
---
Still, you've done well!
---
Fact nurse is laughable on ps4 I love getting nurse cause the game is usually hilarious
---
I remember waking up in a cold sweat and seeing my Uncle looking down at me the same way Freddy is. Same clothes too.
---
Yeah thats the thing, i didnt even pick him up when they timer was about to end. I brought him to the gate, he wiggled free and suddenly was frozen
---
I heard it was only in england
---
My fear is that my crap internet will stop me from playing DBD for this reason
---
hag traps allow you to be at both sides of the window/pallet at once, forcing the survivor to make a mistake. hag traps are much better.
---
They tweeted its finland, Sweden and Norway I believe.
---
Some people run Huntress' Lullaby  with Herman?
---
Wasn't it also for Android?
---
I'm pretty sure
---
Wax
---
True
---
You can go on tap tap.com and download the ApK for Android and do a few other things to get it to work. If your on IOS then just switch you region to Denmark and go to your App Store and download it then switch back to your home region. I‚Äôm in the US and have the game and play regularly on my IPhone XR
---
Ik, it always looks like that
---
I love Leatherface.
---
Haha that would be pretty slick actually. I‚Äôll give you props there.
---
The lore is pretty janky, so some points are weird. Like, Wraith killed one person when he was discovered that he'd been made an accomplice to murder. Which is fair, because the mob would surely kill him if he didn't, and also that's a horrible thing to be tricked into.
---
Then he tore out the guy's spine, made it into an axe so he could kill more people (that thing that he didn't like for his motivation this time), presumably grew to 7 feet tall, and somehow obtained a bell that lets him phase out of reality but why share that part with us?
---
The Huntress is...an idiot? Like, her mother died when she was very young, so she was never properly socialized, but how can she not tell that humans are the same species as her and her mother? And why hunt for sport instead of food? Or is she a cannibal, too? She must have been born a complete psychopath to casually kill children, as well.
---
Michael is actually somewhat sympathetic because the later movies suggest he's enslaved to the will of some eldritch entity with a much lighter touch than DbD's, while the earlier ones suggest an inability to comprehend morality. Though the awful Rob Zombie reboot recinds that and just makes him bullied white trash turned serial killer.
---
Leatherface doesn't actually seem sadistic, just completely callous. He never goes out of his way to harm people, but he also doesn't do anything to spare them pain, and the work of butchering them is horrible. His family, however, is all hardcore sadists.
---
There are actually like 7 Ghostfaces, but none are sympathetic.
---
Original Freddy wasn't a pedo, but he did kill children so he's marginally better. Like, MAYBE better than the Doctor.
---
Ty and yah I only burn this when the day of playing survivor is shit and all the killers are just camping and tunneling on PS4, I‚Äôm not wasting a good offering on them losers...
---
God forbid more than 3 killers exist that can compete in red ranks, let's keep making killers like ghostface that people are absolutely disappointed with.
---
4 k doesn‚Äôt matter anymore just pips.  You can 4k so quick with a chainsaw killer or even the trapper getting traps and 1 hook deaths and you will depip because you didn‚Äôt complete enough emblem breakpoints.
---
&gt;If you aren't having fun then you shouldn't keep playing
---
If you aren't having fun you shouldn't repeatedly queue up for a team-based game and then quit it. Holy shit this community is embarrassing.
---
Lol
---
They tweeted its for finland too though.
---
Borrowed time baby! Here i go farming my friends with no consequences, having a swell time... Why do all my friends hate me now?
---
Sadly if they do that eventually you won‚Äôt have a player base to play the game with.
---
Toss up, balanced landing or dead hard
---
Gonna give my thoughts. Remember, these are just my opinions. I didn‚Äôt really read a lot of the later perks, just skimmed them. I‚Äôll only comment on the ones that I think are necessary/not. 
---
Adrenaline - I think this is a necessary and long awaited change for the reasons stated.
---
Dead Hard - Honestly, I don‚Äôt think this needs to be nerfed. Against a good killer, it should only change things the very first time it‚Äôs used. After that, you should be able to read it. Plus, if not used at a pallet/window the killer can easily catch them again. 
---
Decisive - No need to nerf this. There‚Äôs really no such thing as an ‚Äúaccidental trigger.‚Äù The only way I can see this happening is if you kill and hook somebody else, then hook the other player. In this case, just slug. But as a killer main I can only remember a handful o times this happened. If anything, this would just cause more slugging(lower timer = killers lose less from slugging so they‚Äôre more likely to) which, as both killer and survivor, makes the game less fun.
---
Spine Chill - TBH I don‚Äôt think this needs a nerf either. Put yourself at higher risk of being hit by the killer for some faster objectives. Pretty balanced risk/reward
---
Deja Vu - I‚Äôve always wanted a perk that do these effects. I think it would be really nice in combination with something like prove thy self. It would also give an indirect buff to Surveillance and Corrupt Intervention which would be nice.
---
Almost all of the music and sound effects have been used by him in a similar fashion lol
---
Wraith sounds like an elephant
---
Yeah we‚Äôll I‚Äôm just saying how I did it. And how others can too. If it‚Äôs not showing up then just switch your region?
---
That kid was the only child Michael's killed to date. There's a scene in 2 where he stands in a maternity ward watching two nurses, but doesn't even acknowledge the babies around him.
---
An important part of Michael's design is that it's not entirely clear why he does what he does, or how inhuman he is. "Mercy" doesn't seem like a concept he cares for, though, so it could be more about being sporting. After all, we've never seen him murder anyone physically disabled, either.
---
bames nond is having a stronk
---
YOU BETTER KEEP HER!
---
If i get to second phase on first hook I let go when they get there.
---
I think he meant Bipedal.
---
I only sucide if my teammates are idiots who don‚Äôt save after I reached 2nd stage on my 1st hook.
---
PC: AbacaxiDoidao  
---
Just want to have some fun with a KYF lobby. Used to play this game a lot in 2016/17 and back in the days we always had 5 ppl to close a lobbie, now i have no one :(.   
---
Rank doenst matter, just wanna have sum sum, mic is not required but is appreciated.  
---
BR
---
While that may be true, at most windows it comes down to hitting the survivors in both cases, with the exception of long loops like iron works, but those are rare enough.
---
On the flipside you can crouch over hag traps , so for totem/gen protection freddy wins this one, and hag traps are countered by flashlights, AFAIK freddys are not.
---
Tier lists are subjective to a certain degree, but here is mine. S : Nurse. A : Spirit, Billy, Hag. B : Huntress, Shape. C : Pig, Ghost Face, Wraith, Legion. D : Plague, Doctor. F : Clown, Cannibal, Trapper.
---
hey man where are u from?
---
Whats wrong with them?
---
I'm not an English speaker but I hope it's easy to understand üòÖ
---
I just want to play as 11. Such a little cutie.
---
Had it happen without self-care
---
Bipedal= Walks on 2 legs.
---
No, it's useless, Furtive Chase needs a buff/rework.
---
Not unless the Claudette goes out of her way to wear bright skins, even base Claudette goes invisible pretty regularly
---
The reason it looks weird in the films sequels is because they lost the mask between Halloween II and 4. I don't think William Shatner could sue them over the use of the mask, especially since the one in the new film is pretty dead on.
---
It. Wasn't. A chapter.  
---
It's a paragraph; they only called it a chapter in promotional material but you can't find a mention of the word "chapter" on the DLC's store page.
---
Gotta punish those nurse mains. Playing that killer is toxic in and of itself. Waste their time and don't give them points or pips.
---
Between the two, balanced landing is better. Dead hard is usually better but on some maps balanced is best.
---
Adrenalin is not exclusive to other exhaustion perks. Bringing an exhaustion perk and adrenalin is pretty common (it's even meta)
---
There's an interesting scene in 4 where Michael removes his mask for his niece (and target) and sheds a tear before putting it back on. He's implied at a few points to not be *happy* with what he's doing.
---
When I watched that with my friends I said "don't worry the baby will die anyways because someone probably won't find it before it dies of dehydration or something."
---
Maybe Micheal knew that so he actually made the baby truly suffer.
---
Almost. Not big enough.
---
Amazing.
---
One of the few examples of self promo on here I actually enjoyed, take my upvote üëå
---
Yknow this would look really really bad if we hadn‚Äôt all known the context of the mori animation.
---
I know, in my native language the word is similar to both biped and bipedal, so I didn't know what to use
---
Hit red ranks in Killer for the first time after playing this game for a year! I‚Äôm very happy but holy is it tough.
---
&gt;free-throws them
---
Granny-style
---
Freddy was originally a child murderer, although apparently in early development they considered pedophile. The reboot is officially part of the franchise, and DbD uses reboot Freddy, so it's canon for the purposes of this list, but I feel comfortable calling reboot Freddy a different character.
---
Nope. Leave the gens for abit longer and wait to see if any progress was made.

Agreed, if I wanted to be the most effective possible I wouldn‚Äôt be running a build. I be running op perks, but that‚Äôs no fun.

Hi my username on steam is [NightPanda] (https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198200421835). I want to play DND with some friends.(SWF)
---
Oh. Idk lol.

---
They're really stretching themselves too thin with these unnecessary Switch and cellphone versions.
---
Yesterday I pallet stunned a killer who was holding someone and the game said they got stunned but nothing happened
---
Victor Crowley (from Hatchett), Candyman, The Human Centipede and The collector. Nice ones!
---
TEXT.
---
TEXT is the operative word.
---
I really do hate how it makes a loud noise.
---
Ah, I see
---
Isn't it almost certain that we'll get Pinhead?
---
His traps don't slow him so it can counter loops like hag. The Teleport can have a 18 sec CD
---
Prove thy self good for gen rush
---
I only gave an upvote because of Myers.
---
Can confirm I blame my teammate that pulled me off, the killer is just doing his job. Just sucks when your "teammate" feeds you to the killer haha
---
How?
---
That usually happens when the killer is leatherface and he somehow manages to chainsaw one of my teammates. Ngl it is quite funny, even though my match is ruined
---
The problem is its hard to make another killer like then who's different and interesting
---
It's my last name as well so it bugs the shit outta me when people spell it wrong üòÑ
---
Somehow only when you are survivor though. 
---
Likely due to lag. Killer is hitting where you were. 
---
As killer, it seems like I can kneecap someone vaulting and I just get a ‚Äúding‚Äù. 
---
Looking forward to the dedicated servers to fix a lot of this.
---
US East coast
---
Everyone sure seems to have fun disarming my traps and standing at pallets to mock me when I'm Trapper.
---
Though they seem less happy when the traps I actually hide get them...anyway, I thought Legion sucked? And I notice the worst two Killers on that ideal list...
---
Same here feelsbadman
---
"There will be 2 survivors or more are". Yeah, nice. That took long? Entirely wrong wording/English. If that took long, wow. Sad
---
His traps don't have a set time, they can be placed with 0 slow down.
---
the point of the Teleport is mobility and pressure, not to get an easy hit
---
I love getting cucked by aim assist
---
I'm having the same "problem" with the hag(pre-50), I got like 10 moris, while on my 50 nurse I got just 1.
---
18 seconds plus 5 seconds of travel time, with major prewarning for survivors
---
Because legion has everything a killer wants, but isn't amazing at one thing. Chase, Moblity, Slow down, easy hits, stall, pressure, tracking.
---
/r/theydidthemath
---
And Bond for the best aura reading perk
---
Well often it's not the case but if a person is on their 3rd hook with a minute of the start of the game There might be a problem with the team or the killer and most of the time (specialy at low ranks) it's the Killer that is the problem
---
Legion has a free hit, stall and tracking. 
---
Trapper without purple/red add-ons or against a SWF team doesn't have a power.
---
Just like overkill when they made payday 2
---
You're better off staying split on gens.  
---
Prove Thyself isn't that good.
---
I don't even know where the term came from, but crying "tunnelling" is cancerous. It's bad game design that a teammate's poor judgement can cost you a stage instantly, so I understand the resentment around taking advantage of that (and avoid hitting someone fresh off the hook out of courtesy), but...if you want to never be pursued by the Killer, also never loop.
---
They have the peices in place for freddy to be top teir. They just need to decrease his TP cooldown.
---
Out of those I tend to prefer Lithe. It‚Äôs not often I use high ground in chase, and I can think of more maps w good vaults than I can w maps where I can drop down and utilise BL
---
SWF doesn't need Bond?  
---
Some perks are much better than bond.
---
Because he's frustrating to play as and against for very little reward.
---
That should be a perk
---
nurse, legion before the nerf, and insta chainsaw Billy..... DC fo sho
---
I‚Äôm already subscribed! I love your montages.
---
Yum yum
---
A decent group of random survivors will sometimes all escape and the killer gets nothing out of it, that's totally fine with me, that's how the game works. But a decent SWF team will *always* escape the killer unless they're intentionally dicking around, and that's just nonsense game design. The killer (except for Nurse and maybe Spirit) doesn't have any reliable way to exert pressure on SWF because everyone always knows where I am and what I'm doing. It breaks the game similarly to how an omega-blink Nurse or iri-head Huntress would break the game against a random lobby, the survivors kinda just sit around and wait to lose if the Nurse/Huntress is semi-decent.
---
tl;dr bhvr pls
---
It hurts my soul
---
Gamerface
---
The Killer managing to play well is outside of what you'd expect from this matchup, though.
---
Nah, the problem is that if they try to make a killer on their power level everyone goes berserk and screams as soon as they reveal the killer, and start demanding nerfs once the PTB goes live. No one takes the time to learn to play against that killer or wait to see statistics from red ranks. It's instantly nerf or the majority of survivors start making empty threats of quitting.
---
Granted people also cry when a killer is revealed to be weak, but it's less outcry than if the killer would to be strong.
---
Ya no opposite really I love play as him and get rewarded abundantly. I hardly ever don‚Äôt get a 4K playing as him. I will probably ask for a refund when they change him cause I didn‚Äôt purchase this garbage they are turning him into.
---
I love balanced landing. I use it on all my characters.  I also really like dead hard. I use balanced landing more just because it still cushions your fall while you are looping and your exhausted.  It's been a life saver.
---
Same. Lefty that does everything as a righty. It makes for fun conversation when your friends watch in amazement as you just casually start doing things left handed thought, like you're some kind of witch.
---
I bought some auric cells to try out some of the killers and see how they play out on the mobile.
---
The Match Result logo stayed on the screen for the entire next match.
---
Haha same for me! Had a green toolbox with addons for 5 straight games and escaped every time. I left it for another survivor to keep passing the luck on.
---
With a 45 second cooldown it wont be good for pressure.

In search of two other people for a SWF group. My girlfriend and I play nightly. We cant seem to find decent randoms lol. 
---
Gen jockeys are appreciated, we take hits for each other, and play by making SMART hook saves. Our goal is for everyone in the squad to make it out alive. Rank doesnt matter to us at all, and we don't take the game too seriously.

A working mic is a must, as we party chat. Shoot either of us a message and we will add you!

---
I've had someone sabotage a trap and stand at the pallet it was under teabagging. Gee, I wonder if your friend is working on that gen I was near?
---
They should just give Survivors in-game chat and balance for it, already.
---
Could just be an original killer. Legion came with a new map/realm, as did Spirit.
---
Why not bond though, I think you could tell who is injured based on their posture.
---
If you go to the dbd mobile twitter page it will tell you it is only available in certain countries.  You can get on android and iOS if you change your location to one of those countries in your settings.
---
feelsbadman..
---
When Myers has either the tombstone piece or the whole tombstone, he can outright kill dudes when in tier 3. However, the survivor must not be down on the ground. If a survivor rushes into a locker, Myers has no choice but to grab them out and by extension put them in the dying state if dropped.
---
I'll add you tonight!
---
When you jump in a locker against a tombstone Myers he basically can‚Äôt mori since he needs to hold m1 on you to execute the mori.
---
&gt;Have fun getting in matches where the killer/survivor(s) knowing they will be punished just say FUCK IT and go AFK
---
This is honestly how I do when you know its going to be a bad game. If I'm playing an M1 killer and they use a strode key and two different people have balanced, I'm just going to go stand in a corner. I did that last night and they complained that I didn't farm, but they were clearly looking for an easy game with no challenge, so I was happy to oblige. I'd rather browse reddit or chat with friends for the 5 minutes it takes to get that match over than to frustrate myself in that situation.
---
I just love the hypocrisy of this sub sometimes.  BM from survivors they are public enemy number 1 burn them at the stake!!!  BM from killers alright let's hoist them up on our shoulders and carry them through the town square and unveil a statue commemorated in their honor.  This place is ridiculous sometimes lol.
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1wKaptwOu3i5R48oYqbExg Here ya go :)
---
At least there's a reason, but how does that make sense or affect the actual player? I'd rather see something like a movement speed penalty on stairs because the ground's all porridge-y.
---
good montage hate the killer though
---
I would prefer if we promoted the idea that irrelevant of whether the survivor has unbreakable or not, if the killer doesn't immediately pick up a downed survivor and starts running around after another survivor, let the bloody survivor crawl away. Don't rush in trying to heal the poor fucker in plain sight of the killer! The killer WILL COME BACK to look for them and all you are doing is GIVING AWAY THEIR POSITION! Also, let them heal themselves up to 95%! Then instead of standing over their dying body doing a full heal, and risking them being found by the killer again while they are still in dying state, you just need to spend a second getting them back on their feet.
---
Everybody went through that phase. Tbh your playtime and perks dont really matter, youll find plenty of shit players with tons of hours.
---
I'll admit, that was quite the obviously clever word play XD I both did and did not see it coming!
---
Clown and Freddy.
---
Trapper can fake traps at pallets and hit survivors inbetween loops. If the trapper is good at placement he also has insta down potential. In addition if survivors look for traps and hes good at hideing them he has some stall.
---
You're a better person than me then lololol
---
how does this post game chat get posted?
---
Did you really put your name on this? xD
---
is legion really that bad? ahaha
---
Time to go through the back logs
---
Balanced landing or sprint burst are pretty much the best
---
It definitely is risky, while slugged you're splitting your attention. You'll either guard the slug and they'll have a chance of finishing any remaining gens or you slug and walk away, and risk getting one less person hooked and out of the match.
---
Been there... Entity will keep picking you and throwing you back on the ground like its trying to sacrifice you but pincers won't apparate.
---
And as EGC timer has run out you can not move, you are stuck their eternally waiting to be sacrificed.
---
Hes OP at low ranks and bad at high ranks as his power is taken away by looking at him. Hes not viable anywhere above rank 6 just like myers. Hes not going to be top tier because he has no map pressure.
---
Or they dont stick together and compleatly counter your power.
---
Top tier Django reference
---
Are there any confirmed rewards aside from more lore? I honestly only play for gameplay and could care less for the fluff.
---
Buy Freddy with real money and wait for the shards to get the other two. I peronally prefer Legion because his power is more satisfying than just throwing bottles but it's your choice
---
smart, i didnt think of this thank you :)
---
Alright thanks. 
---
And to add I'm in a country it should be available in.
---
Clown is fun and like easier huntress, legion is bad and unfun imo, and freddy is worse but getting reworked next Tuesday.
---
Wow! That was kinda funny but it is so hard for bubba mains out there. People just hate camping even when they do it when they play killer ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and he is the one that does it most often. 
---
Good luck out in the fog
---
I feel like Myers is very addon dependent but is still a great killer
---
SWF doesn't need bond when they're all experienced players. But if you don't know callouts or your way around the map, it's great for maps like Gideons or Hospital and it removes the crutch of selfcare before it starts
---
to avoid geting instakilled.
---
Has anything been hinted towards this? As I‚Äôm aware it is anyone‚Äôs guess though I suppose logically Pinhead is a good candidate at this point.
---
Though a map depicting some hellish landscape would be really cool so I‚Äôd hope that would be a true chapter and not a paragraph.
---
Leaning marks survivors much faster, crouching while doing so makes it almost impossible to break you out of stealth. Using add-ons that increase movement speed while crouched and increased recovery speed of night shroud are ideal, and you can also "aggressive stalk" meaning stalking behind walls while in a chase.
---
I made a meme I thought was funny. I put a watermark on it in case other people thought it was funny so it didn‚Äôt get stolen. Can‚Äôt miss out on the Reddit Karma lol. If you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs funny that‚Äôs fine, don‚Äôt look at it.
---
Fair.
---
You sound like my favorite kind of person in post game chat, which thankfully mobile doesn't have.
---
Empathy is map wide, so it's just a better pick for when you're running an ambulance build. Bond is nice and I take it all the time, but Empathy fits better
---
Lol I got twelve downvotes on my first comment
---
&gt; perks dont really matter
---
That's a dumb thing to say. Yes pro players have shown in the past you can win whitout perks, but they obviously help A LOT. It takes a special kind of talent to reach rank 1 killer perkless whitout nurse. Telling new players that perks don't help is plain wrong.
---
ty for the response :)
---
‚Äúthe good add-ons‚Äù all you need is battery/filament
---
Myers is fine with his yellow and green add-ons for stalk rate, Trapper without purple/red add-ons is straight up garbage. Add-onless Myers  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; add-onless Trapper.
---
Poor Feng, she got left behind.
---
I just think its funny people put their name on something that was made in meme generator in 30s.
---
Self-Care is a pretty bad perk.  
---
If you think Bond is useful for those maps, try Windows of Opportunity.
---
Every exhaustion perk has a good side and a bad side.
---
Sprint Burst: You can't activate it when you want and you will usually waste it. It forces you to walk, but it can help you to run if you didn't see the killer in the right moment. For me it's a starter perk, not as good as the others.
---
Dead Hard: You can activate it when you want but you need to be injured AND choose the right moment. Also, it doesn't give you a 3 second sprint like the others.
---
Balanced Landing: It's very situational but it gives you a passive even if you are exhausted AND you can activate it when you want.
---
Lithe: Same as Balanced Landing, less situational and without a passive.
---
Head On: It shouldn't trigger exhaustion for me. It doesn't help in chases in any way. It's a meme perk until it get buffed by removing the 3 seconds or the exhaustion (by adding a cooldown). It's fun when it works because it's incosistent.
---
I use Dead Hard and Balanced Landing the most.
---
Guess you offended the whole legion main club
---
You're absolutely right. If his power wasn't taken away from him so damn easy or if he was faster I wouldn't think this way at all
---
dbd being dbd :(
---
''SHe TuNnElLeD mE!''
---
I play both but tend towards the survivors.
---
Some people just don't know, when I tried playing some Killer rounds on XBOX after 3000 hours on PC, obviously playing with oven mits on because im not trying to ruin anyones day especially brand new people to the game.
---
But as soon as you hook someone, they all dive at the hook to save instantly as soon you even look away, its bloody insane. I was pissing myself laughing at how ridiculous it was.  
---
I know that will taper off as I grind out the ranks, but I will always try and punish the players that do these dumb things that actively reduce others fun. Or I guess something that I would be pissed at when I rarely play survivor
---
I play mostly killer, never really had a problem with the frame rate there.
---
pretty good job
---
I play at ranks 1-3 right now as killer. Someone running off a gen to come expose you gives you more time. Then you can leave the guy you've stalked to 90% and chase the person that exposed you.
---
I‚Äôm trying to get back into survivors lately but the hit boxes are terrible and the lag is even worse
---
I'm not a fan of Frank's mask either, I've always used Julie's mask instead.
---
I knew that jawline was off to me for some reason
---
Karma
---
bond is one of the best perks for new players. it teaches you a lot
---
Nurse is hands down the best killer in the game no exception. Being the best killer in a way means she is op. There is almost nothing that can be done against a good nurse. No matter how good the survivor is, her ability just removes everything a survivor has to escape a killer.
---
No
---
Is that when you just knock their ass to the ground again and walk away? I do that too. Is that toxic? I thought I was being nice.
---
Which streamer?
---
And it stuns the person doing the farm-hook. Allowing the killer to just nab them.
---
Good thing dedicated servers are coming soon. I kinda respect the hitboxes because if not then the loops could go on forever because a killer barely missed the survivor model.
---
I‚Äôll do the hook dive with borrowed time and do a 1 for 1 if you‚Äôre a good teammate or the killer is patrolling hard. Also if no one else can get you before struggle mode.
---
It's new, started with the Ghostface update if I recall.
---
Are they running Borrowed Time?
---
This music is in so many of his videos
---
How is playing her toxic? Let me guess? You're a survivor main?
---
i get it if they have borrowed time but from experience, they never have it when i‚Äôm survivor and rarely when i‚Äôm killer.
---
Awesome! That should fill the group lmao
---
Looks at leather face
---
Probably. Since it'll be dedicated servers, it'll be easier to keep a log of issues and ping before and during the disconnection.
---
For a second I thought it was the Boston Basher
---
i wish my survivors would run it in my games but it‚Äôs not super common as of late for me.
---
Windows of Opportunity lets you know where pallet and window spawns are; it's one of the best perks for starting out imo.  
---
You could say the same about Bond, though - Bond trains you to look for your teammates' auras but in a game without bond, what will the survivor do without those auras?  
---
I agree that bond is a nice perk, but there are still perks that are much better than it.
---
You joke but Duo will hunt
---
Assuming you did 90% him in this hypothetical scenario. It then comes down to an M1 killer. you're now wasting time not using your power While 90% guy goes and finishes gens.
---
He‚Äôs actually perfectly balanced. Murders 15-20s gets murdered by 1-4s and is competitive every where in between. He can also still wreck squads and red survivors in the right hands.
---
That's good, I dont want my Wi-Fi to kill my experience of DBD
---
Balanced landing is probably best, then dead hard. I dont like lithe because it makes you avoid windows until you want to use the perk. Ofc I use head on most as I am a man of culture.
---
I never said i lost as him, but against good survivors ur basically fucked, btw i play all the killers all day, ik... im sick
---
lmao that's pretty good
---
The scariest thing here is Feng's arm in the first pannel
---
No dodging is wrong too man.  Real killers play any lobby.  We don't flee in horror at the sight of our prey.  We're killers, not cowards.  Also you said you're a good Spirit man.  That's a top S-tier killer.  You in particular shouldn't be afraid of anybody.
---
At least they aren't costing the killer any BP or pips. The killer still has a chance to chase and down and hook them.
---
I'm pretty sure auto aim fucked your m1 as well
---
[You sure do love stating that as a fact for someone who said this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamfightTactics/comments/c938ba/is_tft_too_rng_feat_hafu/esxxctx/?context=3)
---
He's decent, not amazing. But not trash either.
---
I don‚Äôt think so. Epic Games are money whores and already bought them out.
---
Whack, I'm fast af boiiiiiiiiiii whack.  Lol no problem man.  Have a good one my dude.  See you in the fog.
---
Their biggest strength is their biggest weakness. They will not let each other die, use that against them.
---
They actually tagged them in a tweet, but maybe it's not about dbd.
---
Extra loops wait for the slightest lapse in concentration
---
You know just as much as everyone else it's a scummy thing to do or you wouldn't spend 5 long ass paragraphs justifying yourself smh
---
No to be honest I don‚Äôt think I would have hit that it was a really bad mindgame on my part, though it did force me to hit the wall which fills me with equally as much depression
---
The music and sound effects are in montage videos from many games. They‚Äôre memes and lots of people use them. I‚Äôve heard the exact same stuff in Overwatch and Siege videos. They‚Äôre free real estate.

---
I knew I shouldn't have clicked on that.
---
You must dc a lot if you are actually scared of the new system keeping you from playing at all.
---
In almost every online game you get banned from playing at all if you disconnect that much so please tell me again how this is an opinion and not a fact
---
Something tells me you don't know what Devour Hope does.
---
I would DC vs legion if they moonwalked or exploited chase break by looking down. It annoyed the hell out of me.
---
Have you seen his cosmetics and weapons? We all know Doc is into some crazy shit
---
Eh, probably ochiDO.
---
I think he would go for ‚Äòkid‚Äô
---
I don't DC often, but I don't know how dedicated servers will change online, so *sorry that I actually want to know if my Internet would affect me when dedicated servers come.*
---
That isn't your decision though.  You can't control who the killer targets.  A scummy killer will ignore you the farmer and yes you are a farmer if you pull that shit and simply tunnel down the victim you unhooked.  Be better than that.  Give teamates smart saves.
---
unpopular opinion
---
Trying to survive is not toxic.
---
His power would make Someone learn Spanish and If they missed a lesson. They would be automatically hooked.
---
If we can get nobodies like Quentin and Tapp then we can most certainly get Kirsty. I'm still upset about Nancy and Sidney.
---
*Matchmaking seems fair*
---
Ebony Mori, Ruin 3, BBQ, Enduring, Nurses Calling intensifies. 
---
With that setup alone I‚Äôm sure you could‚Äôve at least killed 2 of them.
---
Wait so you basically have to switch what country you‚Äôre in? Damn. When will it just come naturally too the rest of Europe and North America?
---
Finally, someone with some fucking brains lol all these people with no experience playing against certain killers calling them weak and garbage, when there‚Äôs people out there who actually play and understand the character and completely slaughter as them. It‚Äôs about the player and how much time they dedicate to practicing, not the killer itself.
---
Leatherface came with Grim Pantry, Backwater Swamp.
---
\&gt;Also odd bulb doesn't make the blind any "faster."
---
According to the [wiki](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Odd_Bulb#Trivia) it reduces blinding time by 25%.
---
I normally give 0 fucks about gameplay videos or montages, but this was very well done. 
---
Nice, bro.
---
Well you level up killers by just playing now.
---
Addons that are shared Can be put on any killer that allow it. 
---
And leatherface isnt in the game.
---
It is free. I probably won‚Äôt play it if you can‚Äôt connect accounts.
---
What if the killer isn‚Äôt having fun? Does that mean we get the right to DC also or just survivors?
---
For the majority it‚Äôs the opposite.
---
What?
---
The thing from the stars as a killer when???
---
It's not about perks and add ons. If a rank 20 survivor runs an Insta heal med kit or a key should they face a rank 1 killer?
---
How does that suck you escaped:)
---
Cow tree
---
People that complain about NOED think doing totems is impossible if you are solo.
---
Cow Tree
---
He doesnt attack, but most imorantly, you always get stucc
---
I think he/she is just emphasizing that solo survivor is pretty bad. The amount of times I‚Äôve gone second phase because people are all on gens is unreal.
---
Actually if you calculate mean of all averages it makes sense /s
---
I think that's a given that not every killer can be top tier. It's also a given that anybody can play any killer and find some level of success. Bottom line is that I think his power is one of the weaker ones. Like a worse version of Myers.
---
Most of these are really nice changes, good job!
---
Well it depends on the situation. I won‚Äôt camp to camp. If it‚Äôs pretty obvious 1-2 other survivors are near the hook and there‚Äôs only one survivor on a gen, that means I have 3 survivors (one under my control) right next to me and little progress being done on gens. I mean the smart choice is pretty obvious. Why would I leave the hook? To make the game better for you, the survivor? Do survivors slow down with gens to make the game better for me? Low rank or newer survivors might be able to brain wash newb killers into ‚Äúplaying fair‚Äù, but against competent killers that shit just don‚Äôt work.
---
Tunneling? There‚Äôs 2 versions of tunneling. The QQ survivors version and the killers version. I absolutely punish bad survivor play. Rescue in front of me? You‚Äôre going down, better have DS or BT. You got tunneled? No, you got farmed. There‚Äôs a difference.
---
We‚Äôre talking games where 3 gens are consistently getting completed WITH Ruin up before the first chase is even over with barely going through any pallets. IDK man, against better survivors you have to play more like an asshat. It‚Äôs one reason why I try to stay mid rank so I can play a little more chill. It‚Äôs more fun for me and more fun for the survivors. After rank reset, I milk the hell out of mid rank and try to not to pip.
---
Streamers open themselves up to it so of course they use it as a excuse. If your doing anything competitive why would you broadcast it to your potential opposition? 
---
In other words of they accuse you of sniping tell them to stop live streaming.
---
#COW TREE
---
Would see him coming a mile off he so tall just a pale head like Myers floating above the corn haha
---
Neon hair. They're not even usually good but I know they will make the match obnoxious.
---
*cries in console*
---
TBH when i see a nurse i know it'll either be an easy win or a slaughter. Nurse is easy to counter unless its a good nurse
---
He‚Äôs rank 7 he‚Äôs not a rank 15 or 20. Reaching a bit that scenario doesn‚Äôt effect this one.
---
I‚Äôve edited the game files to bring the cap up to 144 and I‚Äôve been ban free for like a year.
---
Survivor definition of OP - When survivors actually have a challenge and they don‚Äôt just have to loop the entire game. (Nurse not included that bitch needs a nerf)
---
Spirit: *kicks back in a pagoda sifting that 8,000 quitter bonus BP through her fingers*
---
Jesus, it‚Äôs just a joke. Learn to lighten up
---
He said that because you gave no reason why. You could‚Äôve said that mobile dbd is shit because the cramped controls and multitude of glitches make it unplayable. If you explained why you didn‚Äôt like the idea nobody would‚Äôve been angry.
---
If he had the ability to static a survivors screen the closer he got to them, I'd be down for that.
---
Well, us female gamers are out there, hell I even stream lol
---
You technically can, sure, but it would make no sense to do for anything with non-negligible flight time. Hatchets are basically throwing knives a la MW2, except with even worse hit boxes.
---
Okay I know it's been a few months but you have to agree that the Wraith cosmetic is just nutworthy...
---
Nah I play nurse, so I don‚Äôt need to camp. Only time I go back near the hook is during the halfway point, after a gen is completed, or once they are almost sacrificed. And if survivors are body blocking me from being able to hook, I will body block them so they can‚Äôt escape. If you guys can use a mechanic then I can too.
---
see that‚Äôs what also gets me, survivors will all stop everything they‚Äôre doing to rush the guy i just hooked and then call me a camper for patrolling when i see scratchmarks all over the place.
---
ü§°
---
What rank? I'm rank 8 having no trouble finding games as killer on ps4
---
reminds me of darkest dungeon when your peeps go insane

I think he's a stronger version of Myers so I disagree.  Myers has a limit to how much he can stalk survivors he can lost the ability to do so entirely.  Ghostface has unlimited stalk potential for every survivor.  Myers also takes longer to stalk survivors.  Ghostface doesn't suffer from T1 movement speed and gets to have 0 terror radius with no stain.
---
Cow tree keeps yelling at me :(
---
I hate seeing the millennial Dwight head because I know they are going to be the most toxic pieces of shit ever and this comes from my personal experience so I don't know about others
---
Yes, where do I sign ?
---
yeah I don't know where he got that idea from lol.
---
i think most people find that this is reasonable. you take the time to at least try to find the unhooker, which you dont have to do.
---
Do you really want deja vu?
---
NOED I can understand, wtf is wrong with ruin?
---
I had someone PM me "OH YEAH TUNNEL ME HARDER."  
---
 I replied, "I'm not the guy that unhooked you and then cock blocked you at the window. If it was him in your shoes he would be on the hook, you were both hurt." They did not have a reply.
---
Me and my girlfriend used to do this.
---
Except I'm better than her and usually get to purple ranks while she stays around rank 15.
---
She gets frustrated when we play SWF and go against purple rank killers. We usually manage to do one or two games before she rage quits. #feelsbadman
---
&gt;It really is a tougher job being a new killer.
---
FTFY 
---
Good and experienced killers don‚Äôt play that shit.
---
Thank you to u/darknight35 for giving us this amazing template. You da man!
---
It‚Äôs such a shame. Especially since I‚Äôve noticed everyone who criticizes the ‚Äúbad killers‚Äù never actually change their playstyle to fit the killers abilities. Like, you realize that if you try to play freddy the same way you‚Äôd play nurse, you‚Äôre not going to do well? Lol they have completely different abilities and very different strengths. Even freddy can be good in the right hands, and I‚Äôve seen it myself and done it myself.
---
When the wild Spooky Face catches their prey
---
Gen grab spirit is the only killer I will DC against
---
You legit can't play the game
---
Moonwalking was the worst
---
There aren't any rules do what you must to get the kills and do what you must to survive and just ignore the salty assholes haha

---
Noones disputing the games are easier with the top tier killers.  Obviously I agree with that.  But people around here don't say that they say you HAVE to play Nurse, Billy and Spirit up there.  That it is impossible to win with the others at red ranks.  I'd be completely in aggreeance with your statement.  But they default to hyperbole.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve noticed this too. When a generator or similar is finished, I see the survivors outline even though I won‚Äôt have bitter murmur equipped
---
‚ÄúHaha jokes on you, I only take baths.‚Äù
---
If you‚Äôve ever played the chinese copy of this game, Identity V the games play out very different. Greats are super easy to hit and it‚Äôs EXTREMELY hard to lunge and turn as killer. This basically means 360‚Äôs are super easy to pull off and that loops are a lot stronger. The grind for killer is gonna be horrible.
---
dude i hear you. the first game i played after not playing for a few months was like this... it doesn't help that new survivors probably dont know that you can hear their footsteps.
---
Best feeling tbh
---
Mmmm that's some good ass shit right there
---
The struggle is real. I've been losing more than surviving lately (lost six in a row so far); but managed to stay in the Red ranks barely since the update as well. 
---
Congrats üòä
---
Got Adept Trapper after not playing him for a while to focus on other killers. Felt really good after finishing some bad matches earlier with my Freddy, Clown, and Ghost Face. Felt really good. 
---
Made a Hag killer quit with my silent but destructive Jeff in Haddonfield. I ran her all over 2 houses, alternate with running and crouching to throw her off. Slow vaulting and hiding in side rooms as she ran by. It was bull that the player DC and didn't instead try to refocus on the remaining gens (can't tunnel, can't play i guess) but that I avoided her enough she left the game.
---
Finally picked up Leatherface, decided to try him out. First match, I didn't know what I was doing. I embarassed myself trying to play him like Hillbilly and not understanding his power or add-ons (brown common but still).
---
Second match I managed to find all 4 survivors within minutes of starting, all around their first gen. I slugged the first 3 before chasing the last and nailing him with the chainsaw. Started hanging all of them but one of them managed to crawl somewhere I couldn't find or hear, bleeding out. Major point loss bit overall better. I'm not sure i would have gotten Merciless even if I found the last one. No real chase and one hook each. Much better play than the first game, and mostly using hammer and mind games around the T and L walls
---
I always imagined he'd lift them via voodoo doll or something
---
The man demand an answer. XD
---
3 second teleport for him, 5 seconds of warning for survivor is what I meant
---
Ok Quentin I get but Tapp isnt a nobody. Tapp was their best choice to add survivor wise.
---
Pretty sure they knew where each of them were in this case, since on same gen :)
---
No Mither.
---
Any Nea with the pink hair they‚Äôre always toxic lil cunts
---
Slowly, Gently; This is how a life is taken...
---
Nice!
---
Leatherface is the Quentin of killers I've found. He'll always get more hate than others despite how you play
---
Absolutely!  Freddy is currently my favorite killer to play as.  I devised a playstyle and loadout completely built around his aura reading ability and play him spoopy as shit with great success.  You're spot on.  People try and play a lot of the killers in a uniform fashion which is a recipe for failure.  You need to tailor a playstyle around their ability and strength.  It's like a player that shits on Hag as being a weak garbage killer and it's like dude all you did was chase with her as an M1 killer.  Of course you got destroyed.
---
This came straight out of Scooby Doo

Why is he downvoted for speaking the truth? (I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get some for asking now)

---
Nothing obvious just a gut feeling.
---
Huh, does the game give you a queue penalty for disconnecting?
---
Is it not really?
---
Nah I play killer and survivor. I see it from both sides. The ability to tunnel survivors off hooks is the worst part of this games design and much more should be done to discourage it. Killers that camp/proxy camp hooks are 99% of the time doing it with the intention to tunnel a survivor off the hook. If they were camping near the hook to catch out and chase another survivor going for the save that would not be a problem. But unless they have zero terror radius from an ability or perk it's fairly clear they intend to tunnel. Dirty toxic killers. That is what they are. Desperate for 4 kills every game without actually getting any good at it.
---
Sorry ya'll, posted this super late last night then woke up and walked to Money Tree to cash my check. Gimme a sec
---
The game was originally made as just a survival.yes it has teamwork aspects but wasn‚Äôt originally made for just a teamwork game. The game did turn into teamwork type but honestly there‚Äôs more people playing just for themselves than as a team. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not a teamwork game I‚Äôm saying the original concept wasn‚Äôt to work as a team but more to just survive
---
Wow that doesn‚Äôt sound fair at all. But hey maybe it will discourage SWF groups then.
---
you wait for the save so you get 5 stacks of devour hope to mori the dying survivor so ds or unbreakable isnt really going to be a problem
---
Don‚Äôt DC, just throw the game for yourself. Kobe and don‚Äôt struggle. At the very least you get a few points and don‚Äôt waste whatever offering/item you brought in, and yet you still don‚Äôt have to play. And while it does fuck over your teammates, I‚Äôll be glad to have a few extra seconds while the killer is booking you and patrolling your body
---
Technically every chapter (besides Ghostface/ash) has come  with a map. I'd say chapter 13 is more likely to be liscends because every liscends chapter has had a new realm.
---
He might be just as amazed it missed lol
---
Bro you've got a talent man, whats ur youtube if you have one?
---
God DBD on console is literally one of the most toxic games I have ever played. It makes being a killer main really annoying. I just block and move on at this point.
---
Then don‚Äôt play the game. Bad sport.
---
Fuck, it was supposed to be swamp water. SHIEEEET.
---
But once done they'd know whether the killer was camping or not.
---
According to Wikipedia, the Trapper moves at 450 cm/s whereas the Nurse moves at 385 cm/s. I was just using those measurements as a reference to figure out this character's speed, given his ability. Faster than Hag or Huntress, but slightly slower than your standard killer.
---
It‚Äôs simple. Spanish or Vanish.
---
Hit or miss, you still lose it
---
Well...yes and no, in my opinion.  It is perception vs reality.  The killer may be going after who they see (since that is the objective) but the survivor will perceive it as tunneling regardless of motive.  All they see is the killer hooking them multiple times in a row.  Unless the killer is actually tunneling (by choice) and ignoring other survivors to go after the recently unhooked injured survivor...in that case the killer is a dick.
---
And yeah, when that happens I will usually chase and knock down but don't hook.  Takes them out of the gen game for a bit and makes someone still go over to get them up.  But then again I don't care about "winning" or rank, I just want everyone to have fun and get blood points!
---
Movement speed stays the same between t2 and t3 just so you know.
---
As Myers stares at you, he tiers up. First tier he has basically no terror radius and can‚Äôt lunge very far. Second tier he moves quicker and has a lunge. Third tier he can one hit down you and moves very fast. His music plays each time he tiers up. I stood by the gate to let him hit me once to get him some more points before I left. He stared at me and I kept hearing his music. But he got to tier three and I had no idea about all this at the time. So instead of hitting me and putting me into the injured state before I escaped, he just one hit downed me and hooked me. It was a sad day.
---
I ran dying light for a while. It's either a "win more" or totally blows in my opinion. If you are already having an easy game it just makes it easier.
---
The only time I consider tunnelling is when the killer is in range to stop an unhook but deliberately waits for the unhooked survivor to be hittable to put them back up.
---
Any other time you're just playing the game. Not everyone can be bothered to remember who has been on how many hooks. Sometimes if you get sacrificed first it could just be you're not playing as well as your survivor buddies.
---
TFW you're a Legion main.
---
But seriously Legion isn't weak, I get free hits and free stalls. Plus playing legion is fun and almost constantly in chases which is a lot less boring than Gen patrol, stalking, and trap setting.
---
And the main reason I play Legion ofc, PARKOUR
---
Please, just please, not another discussion "NOED vs Adrenaline", people tend to get too flamed at these ...
---
How was Huntress buffed?
---
not hypocrisy at all 
---
toxic killers get treated badly here as well
---
there is a difference between being a jerk for jerks sake and then being a jerk as petty revenge. 
---
petty revenge makes everyone happy and its really sad that you cant tell the difference between being douchy and justified vengeance
---
Been playing uncapped since 2017, not a single ban.
---
Well not impossible but they have a point. Mid tier is weak.
---
I think it might‚Äôve been behavior working with StrangerThings for their soundtrack?? 
---
When I was watching that one scene where this song was used I immediately thought of the leaked dbd file but I didn‚Äôt want to post it due to people thinking I was crazy lmao. 
---
Matthieu C. Stated that there isn‚Äôt a stranger things chapter coming so the only thing I could think of is Behavior working with Netflix for soundtrack samples
---
Rank 4
---
*Plays on console*
---
*Finds out killer is Nurse*
---
"Sweet. Free four-man escape, I guess."
---
At a second more closer look, you're not completely wrong, but they definitely don't get a 5 second warning. Look closely when freddy starts his channel, it's close to 0.4 seconds before his bar stars filling, so I'd assume that this is where the blood starts sprouting. So they'd get a window of 3.4 seconds to react. Survivors will have enough time to get to the nearest window/pallet, so freddys shouldn't expect to get an immediate hit out of a teleport. It still has good synergy with certain perks (tinkerer, BBQ, thrilling tremors, etc), so I expect it to still be a threatening map pressure ability.
---
Ace Detective
---
*laughs in ps4*
---
Because two wrongs make a right.  I do remember my teachers instilling that valiant lesson on us as children.
---
At Billy you should've wrote : "Haddonfield".
---
Because I know Billy mains who will insta DC every time they hear the music from Haddonfield.
---
Lol best comment all morning
---
thats a lie they tell to children
---
Id rather keep my bloodpoints and only loose 1 pip. But yeah gen protector spirit is hell
---
I only now see it Because you mentioned it
---
But NOED increases movement speed, which is what I was referring to.
---
Haha thanks man. I've got some other ideas too, but they need some more fine tuning before I post them. But who knows, maybe we'll get Grim.
---
Lol alright dude.  You go on being petty and supporting needless game dragging BM.  This is obviously a waste of time to continue this conversation.  I'll never support a killer acting that much like a dick just like I don't support the survivors doing it to them.
---
Why should devs rework nurse so people won't dc if they can ban players for dcing
---
Sometimes I just swing into that spot for fun... I have like a 30 percent success rate.
---
The Mother Daughter Ring looks so good, LOL.
---
Why the fuck do you have NOED, Haunted Grounds AND your playing as Myers? You don‚Äôt need THAT much exposed
---
It's really annoying when you're going for the achievement and the last survivor refuses to get out of the locker just to spite you.

---_I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically._
---
Started playing Leatherface today too, and I'm surprised by how much fun he can be! Had some great matches and got a bunch of ggs and no salt, which just made it even better!
---
while not on clown I constantly switch between R2-3 on Legion/DR.
---
its not enjoyable or fun in the slightest and to be honest Im not even sure why im playing the game while on them at those ranks.
---
it makes sense to me now why a lot of the big streamers have multiple dbd accounts and seem to play mostly in the mid rank accounts
---
What a missed opportunity for Adiris' cleansing water
---
Imagine if you escape from the killer and then the next time you are in a trial with them they do the most they possibly can to kill you
---
Oh
---
Alright I see the problem, but I got a question, is the following concept for a perk a good idea? It‚Äôs just something completely random I came up with and thought it would be nifty, even if it is unbalanced.
---
Con
---
For as long as you aren‚Äôt chasing a survivor, you take 3% longer (10% at third level of the perk) destroying pallets, breaking generators, and opening lockers.
---
Pro
---
when you are chasing a survivor, you spend 9% (30% at third level of the perk) less time to destroy pallets, break generators, and open lockers. (If a chase ends as you are doing one of these action, the perk will remain active until completing the action)
---
I tunnel people who flashlight me as a taunt while pallet looping.
---
Your right idk why we even have ranks. A rank 20  killer and a rank 1 killer are basically the same.
---
It‚Äôs only ps4... is that you? Lol I may have bad news for you if not.
---
Early disconnects are nearly always a guaranteed win for killers. The more gens there are to do, the worse it is for survivors to live with the handicap.
---
That is the game making up for all the false saws it gives.
---
Lol at least you're unapologetic about it.  Crutch on playa.  Crutch on.
---
What you mean? Haha yes I got ps4.
---
Nah, discordance, thrilling tremors, pop goes the weasel and bamboozle
---
Not so much discourage SWF in general, but justone more reason to not queue up with chuckleheads who abandon the team at the drop of a hat.
---
I never once said that reading comprehension is important good job skipping over every example I made though.
---
The unhooker? Did you just insinuate that killers are prostitutes?
---
I don't think that works, does it? I thought they had to start the opening.
---
Overwhelming presence teir 3 works too, plus u don't have to hit them, they just have to be withing heartbeat range
---
Oh okay... otherwise, it means you suck. It‚Äôs only on ps4. Check my profile I have a picture of it.
---
Yea you really showed them by leaving and getting zero bp and wasting your offering /item
---
Hey I‚Äôm still kinda new to this game and I always try to put on the darkest outfit to make her harder to see but how is it possible for her to get this dark?
---
Dodged a bullet my friend. Then again the top two survivors both had Ace and Plunderer‚Äôs
---
The man frip Frop back at it again
---
Good job white lighting bhvs broken matchmaking.
---
ü§î Nah. I didnt suck. That match I was good. Eventhough I am a noob. But no matter where I was hiding he always found me. And now I know why lol.
---
Sorry rank 7 and 1 aren‚Äôt that different especially when you factor in the rank 11 and the perks and Mori. Sorry you can‚Äôt comprehend balance.
---
I love to do it! I run the Santa build almost all the time when they're is not an event cause you mostly get firecrackers. But when most people dont bring in any items and you start handing out pruple tool boxes and a high possibility of getting a key you survive a lot more often than not. Just let people know in the lobby beforehand!
---
Just angle your body between the edge of the map when on a gen and if you need to run across the map make it fast lol
---
I like poking at them to see if I can get them to sling racist insults. Then I report them.
---
Having it start on cooldown would be new, he'd be the first killer who gets that treatment. I mean, Nurse and Billy can find a survivor 10 seconds into the match, why can't Freddy get a lucky gen tp that has a 45 second CD?
---
Do you make these yourself? If so, you should make a realistic pack! That would be really cool to look at!
---

---
The nurse is easy if she puts her hand in the air run towards her so she teleports behind you
---
Form the official wiki: Note: the Rarity of the discovered Item is determined by the Survivor who completes the Search interaction, not the one who initiated it. The maximum possible Rarity of an Item is¬†Ultra Rare
---
Didn't even need it :) they all died.
---
Sorry rank 7 and 1 are different ranks that are different. Sorry you can't comprehend balance.
---
Accurate.
---
I feel like I'd it had to be who initiated it they would restart the search timer like they do for totems
---
Flashlights are fine, they were way stronger before.. but if you are having trouble just slug them all!  They can't blind you if they are all downed!  And no slugging isn't always toxic, that's what unbreakable is for!
---
Pressing faster makes you moonwalk, but not for long, you need to try and find the right timing, not too fast not too slow
---
Jeepers Creepers
---
It‚Äôs a rank AVERAGE that is always *around* that average. Meaning a rank 7 seeing a rank 10 or a rank 4 makes perfect sense by itself. Factor in the TEAMS AVERAGE RANK 1, 2, 1, 11 and you get closer to 4 or 5
---

Simply, you shouldnt care. The ranking system is so awful in this game they should straight up remove it. When youre the killer, the survivors have random ranks. When youre a survivor, unless youre in SWF, its the same deal as the killers. The queues are bad and the game will eventually just shove players in a lobby just so they dont have to wait for a proper ranked game.
---
Her lullaby is not any longer directional, so you don't know where she is or have any way to gauge her movement, only proximity, and even that is iffy. Mind you, I think this was a good change.
---
No. Leave him to rest in 2013 with all the barrels and rage comics.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
Charles Lee Ray (the dude that is possessing the doll in the original). He uses voodoo magic.
---
He‚Äôs the killer, he places Chucky dolls that ‚Äúmonitor‚Äù areas and stab the survivors if they get too close.
---
You got Chucky, you got a human sized killer.
---
Ok
---
I just made a post, in the video I have noed. I knew going in that it would be commented on and sure enough it is. Community as a whole is pretty trash and have no idea why I am still a part of it. 
---
This guy is a twat.
---
I bet she sells it for 10$
---
True. I had some friends who DCd because a Myers kept mori killing them but I stayed
---
Swf be like
---
100% reliant on survivors if it even activates. Oh well. Not really gonna discuss it tbh. Go ahead with the "NoT bRiNgIng Up AnY pOiNtS MeaNs YoU loSt tHe arGumEnt". I really don't care. Just wanted to share a funny clip. Idc about perks people use.
---
Alternatively - I‚Äôm running deliverance if you see me rushing to unhook a survivor please let me unhook them so my perk isn‚Äôt useless :(
---
Then quit replying to me. This isn't about math. It's about balance. It's also about you acting like the swf team that's 6 ranks ahead of this guy with an Insta heal is a good match up. Rank 7 to rank 1 is what like 28 pips? That get harder to earn the higher you go. Go lick some more survivor boots. I'm done talking to douchebags for the day.
---
&gt;Not to agree or disagree with you but a report option is given(unsportsmanlike like behavior) that references disconnecting as something to report. So from BHVR you are ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to report it to that for dc‚Äôs.
---
From BHVR, you aren't "supposed" to report.
---
Devs literally asked people **NOT TO** report. The system that bans people for DCing is automated and reporting only creates extra work for them.

I think a better change would be that getting hit with No Mither doesn‚Äôt down you but adds a Deep Wound timer, if hit again then you go down.
---
I don't say this much, but GET THE *DING* OUT FRANK!
---
Average rank of the survivors is 15.5, and the killer is 14 so it's pretty close. Even if it is close by average rank though, it being a fair/fun match for all players is an entirely different thing
---
Yes
---
I suggest watching some videos of people using it successfully, it can feel a bit strange to get the timing right
---
I just came back, haven‚Äôt played since January. Love being accused of hacking because I‚Äôm able to predict survivor movements after hooking someone, or being told I‚Äôm a camper because I went aftersomeone standing 3 feet from me after hooking a guy.
---
I‚Äôm a killer main you‚Äôre just salty as fuck that you can‚Äôt do math. It‚Äôs fine. Maths hard :/. You want every single rank 7 killer to ONLY play with rank 7 survivors right? Enjoy your 3 hour waiting ques. Do you even hear yourself?
---
How would anybody know that is your build and how do you know if they aren‚Äôt running the same one? You‚Äôre just complaining about nothing.
---
It' not really a team size issue, it's budgetary. If they're putting resources into one portion of their business then others will get cut.
---
r/HolUp
---
Honest to God I will gift you Leatherface to make up for that if you swear that you are not a toxic player
---
Stakeout is pretty good imo. 4 guaranteed perfect checks lets you burn through a gen really fast
---
Well it also looks like he was leaning which means he stalks much faster so that also could have been it. Plus to kick him out of his power he has to be in roughly the center of your screen and at least 20% of his body must be visible. So those also could have had a part to play.
---
I mean, you're not wrong.
---
No, I'm not toxic, I'm a trapper main, but really you don't need to do that since it's only 3 bucks I can buy that for myself. Really thanks though, thanks for showing me that people care, but I can get him by myself
---
You're wasting your breath on this community.
---
T-bagging to tilt the killer so they tunnel you is a valid strategy.
---
Just don't cry when you end up dying first.
---
Could see him having some sort of effect that triggers exhaustion or blindness
---
Oh damn... I‚Äôm really sorry. My computer can‚Äôt even run the game but luckily I have a PS4 :D
---
Why the hell does that man have a *jar* of hot dogs?
---
Man, I hate NOED but even if it is annoying and a waste of a perk slot, I'm not gonna stop you playing how you want.
---
Survivors don't have the biggest brains. Go easy on him lol.
---
If Susie was selling her bathwater I know some of you here would buy it. I‚Äôm watching y‚Äôall
---
NOED BAD
---
ADRENALINE BAD
---
BUT BOTH GOOD?
---
Yeah but we have also seen a increase in profits (Larger player base , more dlc , upcoming battle pass , cosmetics) and they can probably balance a couple ports alongside maintaining the game. 
---
Not to mention BHVR is primarily a mobile company , the mobile team is what the company was built on.
---
Piss poor comparison man.  NOED's survival equivalents were Old Decisive and Old MoM.  But both were reworked to be fair and useless respectively so those don't work anymore either.  They used to be about equal skilless crutch though.
---
Only a waste if they cleanse the totems or they don't make it to endgame.
---
Hahaha this.
---
JoJo chapter when
---
I do imagine his ability animation/action to be similar to Freddy's, but I wanted something distinctly different than we've already seen. Wasn't easy. Flying characters, stalking characters, damage over time characters, freezing/slowing characters, fast characters, slow strategic characters, booby trap/ambush characters, you get it. It's tougher than it seems, and you know the DBD devs are dealing with it to. Ghostface, for all intents and purposes, is just Myers and Jigsaw combined, but fast. Not exactly creative. 
---
So it's like this. You're fleeing, you get hit by Delirium. Go in a straight line and you're all fine. But attempt move to the left and you'll discover you're actually going right, and vice versa. It would have a similar duration to the Clown's Aftertonic, add ons aside.

No, I mean it's a waste because you don't improve as much as a player and when you get to high ranks you will get bullied because you didn't get the skill from actually learning and your totems will get cleansed. At that point you either have a wasted perk slot or you switch it out and can't be as effective as a killer.
---
I want the 250 objective points
---
Keep telling yourself that
---
I don‚Äôt get why so many killers complain about flashlights honestly. I‚Äôve played killer since launch, just turn your goddamn heads, people!
---
The only times I get caught by a flashlight at this point is when I decide to break a pallet, and by the end of the animation I‚Äôm pretty much back to normal, so what‚Äôs up with these whiners?
---
Brb going to Hot Topic üòÇ‚ù§
---
Ahhh there it is.
---
Thank you very much, I've been drawing anime like with pen out of boredom in classes lol, I want to do like portrait drawing and your style might just work out
---
Darn I‚Äôm PC but it would be great to play with some fellow ladies lol
---
You're right. I would improve alot more if I used a different perk that caused exposed.
---
TBH Detective Kerry should've been the survivor. Tapp was only there for like one movie and had little interaction with Amanda. Kerry on the other hand was actually in a trap made by Amanda and present in the first 3 movies with her.
---
Hmm. So maybe as a Reaper it could be a scythe point or an outstretched palm seeming to suck the survivor's soul out?
---
His power seems kinda weak in that most survivors would learn from it and just adapt to the change... I feel like he needs something else.
---
&gt;35% chance of them deliberately trying to take them
---
This is why I stopped asking. However, when everyone deliberately takes my chests, instead of just DCing, I'll be a total dick and throw every pallet down
---
But tapp is still way more iconic and remembered then Kerry. Sure he lasted one movie but he was the most recognizable.
---
If there's one thing I know it's that killers can go a lil crazy for the bean...
---
no it's Happy Clown's for the icons and for backgrounds it's me
---
Also a different point, his perks seem quite late game focused akin to Freddy - I feel like Grim Fate could use something else (exposed, hindered?) to give him more of an edge during the game.
---
Yeah, I couldn‚Äôt get achievement because the last survivor always got to a locker before I could get to them, try using pwyf since it helps with your speed, and tombstone kills don‚Äôt make you lose a token. Also do the achievement when people are potatoes, like at 2AM.
---
Purely due to how many of them are camping assholes.
---
I know there are some decent ones out there.  But like 75%-80% are camping idiots who if they down one person they will insidious hide close by to try and get chainsaw multi-downs, and clearly don't really know how to play.
---
Should say "I love complaining".
---
I disagree with increasing his movement speed while sweeping or charging, he is supposed to be an easy starter killer not easy win killer. HB has those at higher number values because it takes a lot more skill to hit with his chainsaw. Everything else is perfectly acceptable though.
---
LMAO and that's how to make a funny DBD video everyone. good job
---
No that's not- nevermind.
---
"I had". Why even the killers think that somehow they are responsables for everyone having fun. You are not their fucking boyfriend for the love of god.
---
LOL
---
Is this OP? üëÄ
---
On top of getting the required charges for one full heal wrong, 22 seconds enough time for almost 2 blinds? It takes 1.03 - 1.09 seconds of flashlight for a blind. Let's call it a even 1.1 seconds for a blind. That's 20 blinds my dude. At least you got the flashlight addon order correct.
---
No.
---
Oh... OH.
---
Yeah I get it. I was using exposed myers. Just wanted to share a funny clip. Just can't do that without being criticized for something so miniscule and dumb. I deleted the video. Don't bother replying.
---
Ehhh silent Spirit is pretty bad sport too.
---
This isn't a bug, that's just how Leatherface's chainsaw works.
---
My girlfriend loves gaming but is way too much of a scaredy cat to play DbD with me. She gets so terrified and freezes up.
---
My favourite salty survivors are the ones with no brains who make me wish I was never born. **Example:** Down Claudette, put her in the basement. Jane is literally on the stair. Goes for the save. I want to take her into my arms but instead, the game decides that I actually want punishment time. She was injured, so she's downed now. Claudette is free. I down Claudette again cause she's going nowhere. Want to give hatch to Jane because she was the best but they are lying on top of each other so I grab Jane and hook her. "Okay." Get Claudette, start hauling her ass to the hatch, nod to signify that I am indeed taking her ass to the hatch. She wiggles out like good 5 metres near the hatch, runs to the hatch and T-bags me. Crouches there and refuses to leave. I go near to see what her problem is. She T-bags me again and jumps. Cue "gg ez"
---
**Another (shorter) example:** Fecker rank 12 or smth. After chasing him once, I purposely avoid him because I know this guy can loop and will loop and thus I wanna get the others instead. I hit him when he's close but I don't engage in chases with him, it's pretty obvious that he WANTS me to. Got no time for that shit. Literally laughs at me in the post-game chat and calls me blind.
---
It‚Äôs not, but most people just run right past them thinking nothing bad will happen to them, what I hate is when the gens are literally popping off like fire crackers and I‚Äôve maybe done 2 totems and I know they haven‚Äôt touched any of the killer isn‚Äôt running ruin...
---
I think I realised the real reason why survivors hate you. Are you incapable of reading my comments? Because I dunno but they seemed kinda constructive
---
I have every killer but cannibal. My friend has him, and he's pretty shit In my opinion
---
This, realistically - because unless they're right on the hook, they could have DS... so Let em bleed for a bit, they're no threat to you on the ground.
---
Because BT exists. Why would i hit someone who is probably going to get away when i can hit someone who absolutely is NOT going to get away?
---
Wow, that's being a dick, you are not entitled to those chests and throwing a match over it is very petty.
---
I decided to give Spirit a try today and after doing not great for a few games I got my first 4k.
---
I glad to find someone who thinks he's fun as well! His addons bring him to a viable level, but I think that his base kit is too weak at the moment. He's one of the killers I grinded all perks on, and it's sad to see him fail due to his overdone drawbacks. This is just my opinion, but a killer's power shouldn't be entirely dependent on addons. One of the reasons I like hag, as her addons only make her nicer to play while her base kit is powerful without anything.
---
I bought The Nightmare to play him a) before the rework and b) because he's my favorite horror Icon. First game I got 1k and a DC. Played a second game and got a beat little 4K. I'm a survivor main so getting that with no add-ons, or offerings with Remember Me as my perk made me smile. Super proud of myself.
---
On xbox, it doesn't even need to be racist. 
---
Any swear word can trigger a mute, tho racial and sexual hate tend to hit much quicker.
---
I've had a friend muted for "wtf" and "jfc" even. Xbox has taken a pretty strict approach in the last 5 or so years.
---
This is why I never gg back.
---
Some people don't read lobby chat.
---
I personally watch youtube videos while queing and only tsb in to check ping and hit ready, rest of the time i have the game on that small preview window to check offerings and loading status.
---
However if i should ever be at a chest just point and wave at me, that i understand.
---
If she‚Äôs a bad nurse yeah
---
I mean, no one is stopping billy from doing that. I get he's the face of camping and basements, but from a viability point of view, doing that won't get him wins unless the team is not listening to the hooked person struggling. I totally get where you're coming from though, it isn't fun with an insidious LF camping you in the basement.
---
I‚Äôm a rank 6 killer but I only get demolished everytime.
---
Had the same exact thing happen the other day, are you on PS4?
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/lXWNg7t](https://imgur.com/a/lXWNg7t)  Had it happen twice, died pretty quick cause i couldn't see anything coming from that side.
---
I like Rob zombie... but honestly I'd probably stop playing DbD if some Devil's Rejects shit got in. I HATE that movie.
---
But how do I know you have that???
---
Dude, I fucking loved that episode of the Clone Wars, ngl.
---
Is it really if you have to cross across the map to do it when they are already waiting for you? Like you're literally losing nothing I spawn next to a chest
---
I'm that killer every time the rank 8 starts insulting me in the chat
---
You got exposed. that's why the screen flashed. Also he was leaning which is twice as fast as normal and if he was using a certain add on it makes it even faster. And yeah bud dont ever walk at a ghostface. You can run away and still reveal him.
---
From my own experience, I am certain that the one who opens the chest is the one that counts.
---
Okay then :)
---
At first glance this set of pics looks like the map might be taking place in a sort of post-victorian architecture town in New England.  Not unlike some of the landscape in that new game coming out ["Hunt: Showdown"](https://www.google.com/search?q=Hunt+PS4&amp;rlz=1CAZBMY_enUS678US678&amp;oq=Hunt+PS4&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3319j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8).
---
I'd like to see that for the new chapter I think.
---
Is there a chance your freind is bad at him. like if you watch ortzdava play him do you still think the same.
---
I know that, I don't do it unless I know they're all in on it. They all want to piss me off on purpose, I'll piss them off on purpose
---
Agreed!  Good life lesson as well! lol
---
Thanks for sharing your opinion and keeping the conversation friendly.
---
Yes because have a constant 130% move speed would be insanely broken. I don't get what your point is.
---
Flawed is not quite the right word.  Something else starting with F and the same amount of letters, though.
---
I provided not one but two examples of perks that were every bit as crutch as NOED for survivor side.  They just happened to be reworked to address how skilless and unfair they both were.
---
I play him too and I almost never get a 4k. On my account, I'm a rank 13 and get a 4k almost every time.
---
Dummy survivors can still believe themselves. The lie is that they are actually good.
---
But...  but...but.... face camping is a strategy.    /s
---
Personally I hate the ones that just hide or run around doing nothing either while your getting chased or while you're hooked. So many times I've been hanging there watching the killer roam and they are all the way across the map crouching around like somehow ghosty is gonna see them with the eyes in the back of his head from the other side of the map.
---
These guys are common. Their salty when they couldn‚Äôt make it long enough and the killer lets the last survivor have the hatch or open up the gates. Had one where a downed a guy and left him on the ground and went to go find the other guy. I went to where the hatch was but guess what, the other guy was in a locker for 3 minutes and he crows gathered around him. I hooked him and let the downed guy escape. And someone else I killed earlier in the game said he was ‚Äúreporting me‚Äù for working with a survivor and helping me find the other guy even though the damm crows gathered around him. Whenever a survivor sends you salt or says they‚Äôre reporting you, don‚Äôt take it seriously.
---
I use blender
---
REPORTED!
---
He couldn't be mithered.
---
Yeah, the more times I reread what you just wrote, the more I love it. That should definitely be the Delirium mechanic, so as not to be so predictable. That way, even experienced players have to watch out when Grim is behind them, rather than feeling a sense of security out of already knowing what to do. This community man, I love it. All entertainment is collaborative. I could present the idea, but others can bring something to it I never would have thought of
---
18 seconds when all survivors are sleeping.
---
Not always just dont be a bad survivor
---
Even though hes better now nor will you get the refund. 
---
I said frusting to play as and agasint, not bad. Which he is. Hes not good desgin wise
---
It is lowered for each sleeping survivor though
---
I have Pharmacy so no.
---
I might be mistaken, but I think you got me wrong. I'm talking about 3 people denying me chests on purpose. They will often even say that they will deny me the chests right before the game starts. If they're all pissing me off on purpose, I'll start pissing them off on purpose. Of course I'm not going to throw every pallet down when I come across 1 opened chest
---
18 seconds for a global map wide teleport is good map pressure
---
This. As a killer please give me a reason to tunnel you. I love free kills that I dont have to feel bad about being a cunt for.
---
But at which point is it considered a crutch for survivor?
---
Wholesome killer ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Nope cannot touch gen repair speeds without it directly being a buff to facecampers.  Unfortunately they ruin it for everyone pretty much.
---
I have many things for when dealing with toxic 4-mans.
---
It's true matchmaker is screwed.  However, this complaint would apply to any non-mainstream pvp game you jumped into 3 years after release.  On the other hand, dbd has a pretty low ceiling as far as competency goes, so it's not that hard to catch up if you really want to.
---
Its in beta, its quite fun
---
That must take a lot of work!
---
You do realize that you are new, we all have bee there.It will take time.Practice makes perfect. Just keep in mind what you do well and build on it and what you don't do well and learn from it.
---
Welcome to the game.
---
You will get better. 
---
Survivors will not always be salty. 
---
Don't become a toxic facecamping killer/teabagging survivor and try to spread positivity and joy.
---
May I suggest YouTubers HybridPanda and Noob3 for lessons in this.
---
I think that would bring Clown down a bit if Grim was able to slow and disorient them, since Clown can only slow. Of course theirs the stuff on the screen to deal with, but that's more camera than movement.
---
Neas with the whole harajuku set up or neon outfit seem to be really annoying players for me, idk why but anytime I have a Nea with that get up they're several ranks above me and are annoying as shit.
---
And oddly enough, basic jeff, I had some Jeffs absolutely beat my ass so Jeffs scare me when I see them in lobbies now.
---
Yeah. I had a 3k game as a killer and deranked. Here I was led to believe a 2k game is technically a win for killer while 4k is something to be remotely proud of. Apparently if you just commit suicide on your first hook it doesnt matter what the killer does. Also if the killer can mindgame you or you're just bad at chases he loses points for you being shit. So that's fun. Survivors can run a shit killer around all day after doing 1 gen and they get to rank up.
---
Look im like this cause this is how me and my swf play, you still get to use your perks at the same you are less at risk.
---
flashlighten up
---
Are you safe?  Do you need help?
---
I‚Äôm not trying hold a button longer than 80 seconds sorry.....
---
Lately as killer people have been using it on me every match.
---
CURSED COMMENT
---
laugh out loud
---
Aight I hear ya. I‚Äôll keep practicing
---
I believe that deal was "Pay .01% of the cost" for remake vs original.
---
Decisive was a get out if jail free card for getting outplayed by the killer and could be used to avoid ever getting hooked once.  Crutch.  Mettle of Man was a get out of jail free card for getting outplayed in a chase and avoiding your next hook.  Crutch.  NOED is a reward for playing like shit and giving up all 5 gens you're supposed to protect and rewarding you with the strongest buffs possible in permanent (long as totems up) haste and instadown for mindless, zero effort downs.  Crutch.  I think there's a pattern here.
---
Yes, and he's not a terrible killer, but he's not high tier either
---
But you like holding that same button for 80 seconds?
---
Flashlight clicking, tbagging and vaulting all the time until the killer finally gives you attention is not a strategy and is only used to annoy people. And most of the time it‚Äòs paired with insults in the afterchat and DCing before they die, really nice strategy there dude.
---
It‚Äôs part of the game.
---
Lol Noob3? Dude just go watch Zubat
---
It's dbd.  Sounds will break every time a dev sneezes, even if they're at home in bed at the time. 
---
  
---
If they cough, we lose scratch marks instead.
---
A man of culture
---
Exactly. Some people just want to start arguments over anything
---
Rank reset is the 13th of every month!
---
Thanks for the silver if that is you Panda! A lovely coincidence as I was watching your Become Human playthrough :D (p.s keep it up)
---
Ofc I know i got exposed I was wondering why since I was looking straight up at him and still the power didn‚Äôt cancel. I didn‚Äôt know about the leaning thing so I think that might be why it was so fast.
---
PS I always walk at them to meme lol I don‚Äôt take the game v seriously
---
Tbh I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that strong because most killers don‚Äôt have small terror radius/use M&amp;A often, so you usually know when they‚Äôre coming anyways. But yea it can definitely be useful against some killers (pig,wraith, myers, ghostface, just to name a few)
---
It‚Äôs not even a secret if you wanna make good videos, edit!  Lit vid bruv
---
It goes better with the raincoat.
---
defiantly. It would still be cool though and maybe they could add a raincoat for the mask or something?
---
Aw, I think hes pretty swell
---
Have the whole team disconnect. Now everyone waits, problem solved.
---
thankyouuu!
---
I make sure to tell my teammates what my quest is at the beginning to help misunderstandings like this (and also maybe to get some help if possible)
---
Byeah
---
Kinda makes me wonder why she has a lunge.
---
Leather face came with grim pantry.
---
Thanks Zombie, I love yer memes
---
Even the one we have already is good, just they need to lose the red triangle.
---
I'd like some more mythological killers. Old boogeyman type shit. Or hell even some monstrous killers like a minotaur. 
---
Give him a charge like Billy *break pallets on hit* but if you hit the survivor you just pick them up. Perks would probably be something like 
---
1: 60 second cooldown on a instant vault. Essentially just charging right through a window. 
---
2: bloodlust type of perk where the more injured survivors the faster or stronger he gets. Maybe an attack boost or lunge boost something like that? Idk what has already been tried so.
---
3: some kind of tracking perk. Maybe give him a secondary power type of thing where he can choose a survivor and they let off a golden string behind them for like 5 seconds instead of scratch marks. Or have it be an obsession perk? Idk just trying to think of the myth.
---
Addons would obviously deal with how fast he moves like Billy. Maybe give him one where he just injures people with his charge but they get hindered for like 2 minutes.
---
Mori would be him goring a survivor then shaking them off his horns and pounding their chest in with a hoof.
---
Idk how balanced it is cus I'm legit just spitballing off the top of my head but some kind of monstrous brute killer would be awesome.
---
Lol true
---
The hook is photoshopped :P
---
Lol why it would discourage swf? Wtf it doesn‚Äôt make sense. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs ‚ÄúSURVIVE WITH **FRIENDS**‚Äù, so you get people that know what they‚Äôre doing and won‚Äôt dc jfc
---
This is great and all but flee the facility is much better
---
20 seconds is a legion frenzy cd so its not really.
---
It helps too to play survive with friends with people who are experienced players‚Äî it helps to have someone with you while you‚Äôre learning‚Äî I‚Äôve learned a lot from the guys I‚Äôve been playing with. Now I do much better on my solo games because I got to learn from good players.
---
Guess I'm double omega gay then
---
That‚Äôs my lobby üòÇ me a rank 7, one rank 1 and another rank 7 and our noob friend a rank 13..
---
No, not only does it buff campers, but buffs killers like Nurse, Spirit, and Billy that don‚Äôt need it. People would just continue to use these killers because they will dominate with them. So unless you want to nerf them, and also have an actual hard measure to stop camping/tunneling other than a decrease in BP, gen time should not be touched.
---
[https://youtu.be/3XeACeKejcA?t=71](https://youtu.be/3XeACeKejcA?t=71)
---
I wouldn't trust the wiki. Flashlights were reworked in 2.0 to all blind at the same rate regardless of add-ons or rarity.
---
Oh I totally agree
---
I play killer mostly, and in my experience (on ps4) survivors from rank 20-5 don‚Äôt know what tunneling means. So 9 times out of 10 I get a salty message after the match because I ‚Äútunneled‚Äù them even though they were the 3rd person to be put on the hook
---
Ah, that's fair. I thought you meant if you start opening it up right when I get there. Thanks!
---
But he isn't wrong? Teabagging is annoying at worst and amusing at best, while camping and tunnelling aren't fun at all
---
It‚Äôs enough to make a grown man cry
---
when Michael jump scares you so bad you just fly out of existence
---
Nope, i 100% understood you the first time. Someone was toxic to you, denying you chests. (toxic behavior)
---
You in turn drop pallets to justify being wronged. (extremely toxic)
---
Two wrongs don't make a right.
---
I agree the new one is cool it makes The Ghost Face feel like hes linked to the entity on some supernatural level.
---
I really like it
---
So is the leave match button, in fairness.
---
I play survivor for Daily Rituals or if I want to take a break from killer for a while due to long waiting times
---
This is the quality content I came here for everyday. Thank you for your kind efforts sir.
---
Chase is slightly better with the first hit if you don‚Äôt miss, mobility is the worst of any killer with mobility, slow down sucks since you have to let survivors go for it to take effect, easy first hit is true if you don‚Äôt miss, stall is the same as slow down, uhhh what pressure? If you are talking map pressure then he is the worst killer that has map pressure even plague can have better map pressure if people cleanse, and tracking requires you to let survivors go to chase other survivors you probably won‚Äôt be able to hit since you are too slow/they are too far away. 
---
Everything in his kit is either the worst of its kind or actually harms him in some way, since still every time you use his power you get a 5 second stun. Not even nurse has a 5 second stun with base kit the only killer that comes close to that is Leather face if you run into something.
---
Also most killers without map pressure have something to make up for it. Doctor has madness that slows down the game a lot more than people think, clown has really easy loop control and easy downs at that. Just a few examples but just because Legion has many of the things that make killers good, those things are just terrible. I think I will have to make a post with each killer to show why they are all better than Legion.
---
Its a relaxing change of pace compared to playing killer for me. Sometimes its nice to just kick back and do some gens, loop the killer every now and again. Ive heard a lot of people say that they feel the opposite though!
---
Noed can be destroyed easily at any point during the trial.
---
Adrenaline rewards you even while on a hook (not a good play by your logic) therefore should not reward a full heal.
---
There can be 4 adrenalines. Op, and everyone knows it is.
---
Sure, noed grants exposed....and? So do a handful of other perks.
---
The stigma is that it activates when genrators are powered, therefore its unfair and the killer is bad for not keeping track of 7 generators all the while chasing 4 people.
---
Ds rewards bad play. You can immediately get away from the killer because you decided to run towards him and or your teammate was an idiot who unsafe rescued. 60's after unhook is absured and only made slugging more common.
---
Noed should be on a timer, similar to blood warden. 2 mins seems fair, also can lose the speed buff.
---
Adrenaline grants waaaaay more to an individual than it should, for what? Completing 5 gens? Thats not even difficult.
---
Either way, we can sit here and argue all day, but I feel like we said our piece. Agree to disagree.
---
I think it's better balanced than most asymmetric games I've played, but there is quite a difference in power between the high tier and low tier killers. You could argue that current Freddy is balanced, or you could argue that Nurse is balanced, but you cannot argue that they are both balanced. That being said, the game is probably the most balanced it has ever been in its current state. With killer reworks on the table now, and dedicated servers in the works, the future is looking bright.
---
Yea we get the point
---
How dare you! You have to let me kill you! Otherwise you‚Äôre toxic! 
---
Wah, my feelings!
---
(Got called toxic for running Tenacity, UnBreakable, Flip Flop, and Boil Over)
---
Obviously this doesn‚Äôt work on console, but on Pc you‚Äôre gonna want to type %appdata% in the search bar on the bottom left of your home screen. Then click on the tab that says AppData in the bar near the top of your File Explorer window. You should now be at This Pc - Local Disk (letter): - Users - (your name) - AppData. Now click Local -&gt; DeadByDaylight -&gt; Saved -&gt; Config -&gt; WindowsNoEditor -&gt; GameUserSettings. DONT EDIT ANYTHING EXCEPT GAMEUSERSETTINGS. If you change anything else you will get detected by eac and banned once you start the game. Once you‚Äôre in the notepad file you can basically customize anything you want. I would recommend changing bUseVSync to false, which makes skill checks less laggy. You can then turn FrameRateLimit to whatever you want, 0 being unlimited, you can also change AudioQualityLevel to 2 for better sound, but slightly more lag. Also, one of these settings changes screen stretch but idk which, so either google it or look through the settings. Hope this helps.
---
Your forgetting its not all the time, and that survs wont be in dream long.
---
The reason why I'm "wasting my breath" is because nobody is open to an actual good idea of balance between the two sides, and people who have acceted it have given up hope at making more people see it how we do.
---
But of course that would take maybe a bit of work and typing and helping and it's much easier to just downvote the things that people who are trying being helpful are saying.
---
If you don't want to see actual interesting posts on this subreddit other than how OP one side is or toxicity or other things like that then go ahead and not care. But I'd like to see some good things.
---
Doesn't make him anyless of an idiot.
---
I don't think that's a good reason for not buffing him. Give him viability and LF will have a reason to not facecamp. Even then, a facecamping LF will not win.
---
If you get a good map and have more than 2 traps, and ruin isn‚Äôt destroyed in the first 30 seconds of the game he can easily get set up and destroy people that aren‚Äôt ready. Of course if you run into a tryhard SWF every killer besides like Billy spirit nurse will be destroyed and even they they will need to also go tryhard.
---
But against potato survivors any killer can easily win with basic killer knowledge. So comparing Legion with Trapper against potato survivors vs tryhard SWF they will both do as good as each other but for different reasons.
---
But do YOU really want Deja Vu?
---
Your goal as the killer is to provide an entertaining match to the entity. Including chases, hooks, generator defending and all of the things that generally make a fun game of DBD for all the players involved. 
---
You know when you play survivor, hooked, sandbagged, hooked x 2 and dead. You don't have a good time, its not fun gameplay and as the killer is it really that fun also? 
---
Does that make you feel like you accomplished something lol, they literally couldn't do anything to stop it happening but yeah you killed em üëä fistbump
---
Just the jorts, thanks.
---
Yes, and you are wasting your breath. This community is full of people whos brains are full of vegetation and dung. You will never see it thrive.
---
Oh and also, I forgot to mention that you must right click on GameUserSettings and check the Read Only box once you finish editing your files. This makes it so the game doesn‚Äôt change back your game settings once you start up DBD.
---
WAZZZZZZUUUUUUPPP

report her to bhvr
---
Touch√©
---
My favorite is when I get accused of camping when they try to save as soon as I hook a survivor

I upgraded my Ghostface to lvl 46 now and do you know how much ebonys i've gotten before that?

Fucking 12

If you feel this removal was in error, or if you have further questions, [feel free to contact the mod team.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdeadbydaylight&amp;message=[How do you get Spine Chill?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cabfug/how_do_you_get_spine_chill/))
---
I mean Trapper stalls himself
---
General rule of thumb: don't open chests early in the match, and if you have an item leave chests for someone who might have Ace's or Plunderer's.
---
In addition if you have Ace's or Plunderer's try to leave items at points of interest, such as near gens or the exit gate. This comes with the caviat that people might think the Killer has Franklin's, but it's usually a better way to redistribute your loot then just leaving it in chests or running around trying to find someone to take your crap.
---
I know you may hate LF but he is a human being. In HIS natural habitat :D
---
Its closer to revenge, than teaching a lesson.
---
If you want to teach random strangers a lesson, first make sure you're positively contributing to said subject. Negativity is never a lesson worth taught.
---
Good god please do these more often for DbD. I'm not sure of the exact term but I love little memey videos with songs and soundbytes cut in. Sir Rodion used to be my go-to, but with him gone there's been no real meme lords. 12/10, good content I come to the sub for, would subscribe.
---
I run urban evasion and used to run self care. I almost always go for the hook save unless: the killer is legit face camping, you‚Äôre almost dead and I‚Äôm the only one trying to save, it‚Äôs the end of the match and killer is camping with NOED. That‚Äôs basically all that stops me. It seems to me at ranks higher than 15 everyone DCs or just doesn‚Äôt struggle and I run half the way there for nothing.
---
Probably a survivor main
---
Unless they edont wake up like Plague, in which case they are. And even if they do, then they are wasting time waking up.
---
A predator is often blind to its own peril
---
pretty much yea
---
You should auto struggle and have the option to give up.
---
Depends
---
Dude this made my day lol
---
Imagine a 9 ft fucker running at you at %115 movement speed
---
I don‚Äôt know man, it‚Äôs tempting
---
Oh hey SaTaN
---
They will be staying at gens to get a skillcheck, the stall is hillariously minimal.
---
I played leatherface recently for the Claudette skin.... I swear the more I played him the more brain cells I lost; god he sucks.
---
You let someone who *wasn't* me survive reported
---
Because survivors actualy need to look for his traps against a good trapper.
---
Except that old (and even new) DS and old MoM had no counterplay and NOED has multiple counterplays ...
---
NOED is an average perk. It doesn't even get used in red ranks that often because killers know that it's shit (There are better options that you should take) and survivors know how to easily play against NOED.
---
DS and old MoM were top tier OP perks that you definitily should allways run.
---
But holy shit I am not getting in this argument again. 
---
I'll just simply agree with these 50 IQ survivor takes.
---
"nOeD iS bRoKeN pLz NeRf It BhRb!"
---
you're probably right. it seems so close to nurse. but look at ghostface and the shape!
---
The 3rd and last jake one look nice
---
Or being accused of wallhacking because you can moonwalk on console as killer to end chases faster
---
Nurse's Calling and Sloppy working on Legion's Mend would elevate them to atleast a C tier killer, maybe even B. It's the main gripe I have with their kit. I don't think BT needs the nerf though.
---
oh god, it speed bursts him for 3 seconds// breaks// he has 2//
---
he restocks his pogo from lockers...
---
lol
---
more bearable doesn't mean better than Billy
---
Not at the moment.
---
Ok I think I'm having a special needs moment, what is BT?
---
My bet is either on that Stranger Things Monster Or Chucky
---
Gems are already an incredibly dull game mechanic. Maybe they could add more objectives, but I‚Äôd rather not have to afk on gens more than I have to already.
---
Just David, actually. no clothes needed.
---
Fastest dodge in the west
---
An easy game so clearly in view, or is it merely a trick of the devs?
---
Slow and insidious wins the game
---
i recently bought the costume for streaming ghostface since he dropped. Im also new to reddit
---
Despite being considered OP after addons on PC, Nurse has one of the lowest kill rates on console. If you're hoping to win, maybe just change, but otherwise it seems like it's mostly practice to learn what you can blink over, and maybe turning up your turn sensitivity.
---
Rip
---
This, doing it fast will get you a second of moonwalking that ends abruptly. 
---
I recommend going into the survivor tutorial and practicing there.
---
I have  around 830 hours in his game and I still suck at it.
---
Its his mentality that survivors can do no wrong. Pretty ignorant.
---
Lol "gen rushing". This guy says hes running Billy with a meta build but doesnt have proper map control and screams gen rush. Get some map control with the most mobile killer and you're golden.
---
nice man! he's my fav killer now
---
Is this why matchmaking is so awkward? "Yeah, this guy's Rank 6, but he's mysteriously gotten nothing for several games better put him up against a Rank 17 Killer."

Selling my swamp water for all you hopeful sacrificed boys

Same happened to me today when I was playing as Freddy. Bugged on the last survivor and I missed out on my Bloodpoints :(
---
100% sensitivity, learn her blink ranges and be good at tracking. I'm a p3 nurse on Xbox and I do really well with her. It takes practice.
---
Whenever I have an easy daily for it, and one match besides for the XP (for the shards).

I really don't have much fun playing Survivor, but I do my best to help. Often die for altruism because I am supernaturally unlucky when I need a pallet.

boo

No he‚Äôs saying that holding a button for 80 seconds is bad, and longer would be worse.
---
smart man
---
Hmmm true. Noob3 for entertainment value then? 
---
Tru3 always seems so angry to me which made me stop watching him for a while and just found ohtofo and otzdarva, so haven't formed an opinion yet. 
---
Panda is my go to guy for content these days as he is generally a fair killer main.
---
lmao it IS
---
Exactly the same for me as Freddy today :(
---
You can make a tierlist out of this. 
---
Also the &lt;&lt;of not sound mind&gt;&gt; argument can be made for most of them so it's not really a point for Myers.
---
lmao ye
---
bro bhvr said no more exlusive characters, this wouldn‚Äôt be fair to us pc gamers and console plahers
---
/s
---
No such thing as gen rush bud ..... might as well say you are hook rushing if you get a good start .
---
They always ask why are you killing me and not what‚Äôs kill you? 
---
What‚Äôs killing me is that the Devs didn‚Äôt change fuming mixtape or make most of the purple add ons work
---
Because u need to know when to stun, u boosted ape
---
You'll never win these arguments against people who think NOED is an "OP crutch perk".
---
Tell them that it's easily counterable by cleansing totems.
---
They'll respond with: "Nah my teammates NEVER cleanse totems. And I alone don't want to do it."
---
I also heard:  
---
"That's not possible since killers defend their totems" &lt;---- ?? Don't know why people upvote stupid shit like this.
---
Tell them to just escape the trial. NOED activates at the end of the game. I would say by own experience (and watching DbD streamers) that 50% of the time people get hit by NOED (in green/purp ranks) because they don't leave the trial.   
---
Instead they make a risky decision trying to save a teammate.  
---
"But I want to play altruistic." They will say.  
---
Tell them to just cleanse the activated hex totem if they really want to do some end-game play.  
---
They'll respond with "We don't got time for that."
---
Tell them to run Adrenaline. NOED can be scary if you're allready in a chase while the last gen goes off.
---
The 5 second sprint burst from Adrenaline outshines NOEDs speed buff any day.  
---
It will give you enough time to reposition or even lose the killer.
---
They'll respond with: "A good killer won't lose you."  
---
And the classic: "It's a noob crutch because it rewards you for losing."
---
Most stupid shit survivors say when they talk about NOED.
---
A perk being late game oriented =/= rewarding you for losing.  
---
Survivors and Killers got a lot of perks which are trying to give you a boost whenever you're failing.  
---
I'll just stick to killer perks and give a few examples.  
---
Blood Warden only works in the late game.  
---
Bitter Murmur rewards you whenever a gen is done.  
---
Remember Me only works in the late game.
---
Fire Up. NOED. You could even argue and say "Make your Choice" rewards you for losing since people are getting saved.
---
"But you don't have to work for NOED. You have to work for the other perks. Atleast there is still skill involved."  
---
Same with NOED? Noed doesnt make me win. IF it activates at all and IF it doesnt get cleansed while it's active - I still have to find you, chase you, down you, carry to a hook and then you still might get saved.  
---
All of that while the exit gates are probably allready open.
---
I've seen it all. Anytime there is a discussion about balance some survivor brings up NOED. It's fucking annoying.
---
Survivors not trying to want to improve/adapt their playstyle arround NOED and calling it "toxic" or a "OP crutch perk" make me roll my eyes.
---
Just had to get it off my chest, sorry.
---
Now have a nice day :)
---
Wow what a helpful reply thank you. Great job
---
Also he still does have addons to lower skill checks and add a action speed reduction.
---
Had this last game. Two people ran at me in the basement. Stopped right outside to heal each other. Finished healing and started running to me but I died due to my timer running out.
---
This thread is a standalone argument for F13-style voice chat.
---
Her lunge is so absurd for a killer with the ability to teleport. I shouldn‚Äôt be able to get an easy 4K after I‚Äôve mastered a killer.
---
Whoever thinks Legion is weak still has a grudge from going against old frank's mixtape + cold dirt Legion
---
I‚Äôm ok with that lol
---
I dont care if you are nurse but if you are nurse with noed, ruin, and some other annoying stuff I'm out.
---
imagine getting pissed over a mistake you made
---
Been playing Claudette the most in my first four days of playing so far and really enjoy using taller grass to hide or allude the killer for a longer period of time while they look for me.
---
New Nightmare is such a clever movie. Honestly, I‚Äôve never really come across a movie that‚Äôs like it- not even Scream reaches how meta it got. I love that movie so much, and it‚Äôs what solidified Wes Craven as one of my favourite directors.
---
"abusing the matchmaking" you know they have no choice in who they go against right? nd it's not even a huge difference in rank in the first place. like i could understand being annoyed if you were green or lower but youre not
---
No, they just can‚Äôt recreate most killer sided bugs as easily, they‚Äôre pretty random.  This is an aura glitch and the next patch should fix it.  Wake Up was obviously a glitch in the code of the perk so they just fixed it, as no recreation was hard to make.
---
Im a red rank that hasn't played because of my internet and I think by the time I get back on I'll be a high yellow.
---
Breaking the souls of leatherfaces with noed and insidious after looping them for 5 gens, while my friends get totems, so they can't use either, gets me more moist than a horny toad.
---
Watch monto. He does a bunch of builds for killers and survivors
---
So having the low level host for 3 red ranks is okay? That‚Äôs not matchmaking abuse?
---
That‚Äôs... super confusing.
---
Considering it‚Äôs a rare add on, and this is a horror game, I think it‚Äôs just fine. If it were her default ability then yeah that‚Äôs bullshit. I take it your also not a fan of tombstone infinite tier 3 Myers?
---
The BM is so powerful
---
I guess that would matter if reports actually did something in the first place /:
---
Julie is way hotter imo. Susie seems high maintenance.
---
Okay, so I hope I don't come across as unintelligent. I simply haven't played enough Legion to know yet. Will Nurse's Calling not show you the aura of a survivor who is mending?
---
"NO! I WANT MY POINTS!"
---
Said someone... probably
---
God the cringe.

---
I think I‚Äôm one who‚Äôd say they feel the opposite! Haha I feel more kick back as killer but survivor is more of a stressor for me. That‚Äôs cool you play on the opposite side like that
---
I'm not a fan of any addons that break killer powers, just like I'm nit a fan of insta heals and BNP
---
But gen grabber is literally the only killer that completely stops survivors from doing their only objective 
---
T3 myers can be looped and can't just run up and grab your shit off of a gen whenever he feels like it. Gen grabber Spirit is on another plane of bullshit
---
If you wanna do that on console, I recommend spirit, easily the 2nd best killer, 1st best on console
---
Quickly rename yourself to "No u"
---
They will get the ultimate bamboozle when they die.
---
She got that thick booty tho
---
I got chewed out and told I was going to be reported by a Feng who d/c'd as she was getting mori'd, because I gave the last survivor the hatch. It was a Meg who kept lagging/glitching around for some reason, plus one of her teammates d/c'd so I just felt bad.
---
But it‚Äôs rare, and after it‚Äôs been revealed that she‚Äôs the killer others will be on their toes. How many times can gen grab get you in one game? What are the chances?
---
Because not everyone has as awful latency as whatever demons you‚Äôre facing.  I for one have 10 millisecond latency so this doesn‚Äôt happen too much when I play killer, and the developers said you‚Äôre SUPPOSED to be able to hit the survivors over windows, but if your latency is high, it makes it all awful.  I propose BHVR adds a feature that tests your internet connection when you want to make a lobby as killer, and if your latency is extremely high, you shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to play as killer.  OR they can simply shrink hitboxes in regard to the latency of all players, but any glitches with that would make me wanna kill mice elf.
---
I am a product of my environment lol.
---
Yeah, I saw that boots or whatever guy posted a video and he had noed. Guess he took it down because it started to get out of hand.
---
Welcome to the realm of the entity!
---
We have a terrrible screeching floaty woman and a crooked stud with a brutal chainsaw and back problems, the rest are ok.
---
Remember your biohazard suit after a match is over, run meta perks on both sides and most importantly: SWF is the scourge of earth unless you are playing Legion.
---
Then steps in his trap
---
I've gotten this as well not really the killer told me my teammates a 3 man swf reported him for allowing me to leave
---
That was true art
---
or maybe because they do lol
---
*to be continued*
---
Doubtful. Netflix isn't Stranger Things. Netflix is all of Netflix.
---
You can't hear her comming so knowing that she has it doesn't really do anything as you still cannot touch generators. And I don't care how rare it is, it's still bullshit and shouldn't be in the game.
---
Fungus Minn

Well I guess that‚Äôs your opinion

Most people agree with it

Use whatever the fuck you want, it‚Äôs just a game. The perks are there for a reason, use them! Geez guys lol...

Yeah maybe lol.

[Original post that I dbd-ified](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ca8e4w/relaxing_games/) which was created by /u/ComicsByKnight

Sure. Just earlier today I had a survivor call me disabled because I  "face camped." Even though I literally walked away after almost every hook because I knew no one was nearby thanks to bbq and chili. This survivor tried several times to cleanse a hex totem and I would routinely find them and hook them for it. Keep in mind I was barely near the totem except when I thought some one was on it. I caught him because he was so predictable but apparently I was just camping the totem. Afterwards he had his entire SWF group message me and call me homophobic slurs. They saif I should never play tje game again because fumb killer mains are a "stain" on the community. Thankfully I killed all but one of them.
---
Well I dont think you can bitch about shit when you're just "memeing". Also the hitbox is really wonky and it's harder to do it at close range. Run off and reveal him from a distance.
---
I have never experienced this yet
---
Going against a 500 ping killer is like going against diavolo
---
Dont give them ideas, the last thing we need is a red haired legion
---
I havent had any issues and I've been cursing at kids forever. I also cant find anywhere to report them for cursing so I just use the voice communication one.
---
When I first started playing last year a month before the game was included in the games free for the ps plus lineup I have always had games with a mixed bag of players in red purple green etc. Whether they were swf or random people I don't know but getting people in green and purple ranks against a doo doo brown rank killer (me) I had a bad time.
---
I mean it makes sense when you have 500ms ping..
---
Trap still attached lol
---
You can‚Äôt view the killers perks/offerings until the match is over. But, if it is over and everything is blank then they‚Äôre perkless. If it‚Äôs still going there will be a bar of sorts covering everything.
---
I know i shouldn't be laughing at "LION KING ASS (n word)" but I am
---
Gen rushing is a thing, but not in the way most people say. Just doing gens when the killer isn't chasing you isn't gen rushing. Doing gens over literally anything else at all is.
---
But either way anything is fair game, so it's still not really anything to complain over. If it's in the game, and it's not an exploit, go ham.
---
Im sorry if im stupid but why do people switch to nea last minute, and why is that bad?
---
I've been having that happen a ton with survivors going for the unhook. Try to grab someone off, instead it glitches, survivor finishes the unhook and both get away, then animation ends. Just a fantastic new bug
---
ok
---
Let me tell you, you're incredibly lucky people aren't reporting you lol. You're bound to get one eventually.
---
All you do is click on the message, and then click report.
---
Love people like that.
---
I feel like he's going to become the new Freddy, sucks to play against, sucks to play as
---
I never know if I‚Äôm gonna hit or not cause after I blink I have no idea where the survivor is :D
---
it's not new, this has been happening for months
---
Been in the game for almost 2 years. Atleast we got some new shirts for meg though.
---
This and if 2 teammates dc. **maybe** 1 since it kind of makes the match a loss from the start.
---
yeah that happens sometimes. press your attack button and youll go.back to normal
---
xbox. Have any of you had a problem with the game where you get no prompt to wiggle or use your ability like dead hard and you can't use med kits or self heal? Even after being hooked you can't do anything besides work on a gen. I was just wondering if this just happens to me or if it is an often occurrence.
---
This sounds like how a new killer would come to be, if BHVR snorted hyperspace cocaine and didn't give a shit about DBD's story anymore.
---
I think billy isn‚Äôt fun and spirit is kinda easy. I‚Äôm rank 15 so survivors aren‚Äôt that good either
---
I just noticed this bug recently. PS4
---
‚ÄúShut up, Meg.‚Äù - Peter
---
Well, from the stats, it looks like it's mostly just "git gud," unfortunately, but I play on PC so don't give up hope.
---
Why use noed when you can kill all the survivors before a single generator is done. DUH!
---
Gen rushing hasn‚Äôt existed since they nerfed BnP ....  You either aren‚Äôt running ruin or have terrible map pressure .   Pre nerf BnP would knock out 3 gens in the beginning regardless of Ruin and map pressure which caused the ACTUAL gen rushing complaints .
---
That's good
---
Oh, happenned to me this morning. Basically same ranks but +1 each (let's fqce it that's the same)
---
I found tha hatch lul
---
there‚Äôs insane add ons where you have to be about that close to cancel his power
---
Oh, I was joking since in game says 4.5 m/s
---
Oh I‚Äôm so sorry my phrasing wasn‚Äôt precise enough for you. I‚Äôll be sure to clarify the obvious that‚Äôs it‚Äôs just my opinion and prediction, even though you should be able to understand that without me explicitly saying.
---
I did that this morning. Feels awesome.
---
POINTS!
---
Any way it could be fixed to be better without being unfair? I feel it could be neat if I found a way to tune it out after looking at all the benefits, perhaps the addition of vaulting windows in both the penalty and benefit? No that sounds unfair... why would a killer need to quickly vault if they know there aren‚Äôt any survivors near? Hmmm...
---
Hm, I thought they would have included that in the perk.  It would obviously make a great build for the legion.
---
Even better is when you see no red with BBQ&amp;C during your first game back after a good year.
---
She may have been trying to get you unstuck with the pickup, I will attempt that as well. But if she actually was taking advantage of the bug, she deserved it.
---
Yeah just message them "if you live you double gay" easy 4k
---
There are still 2 survivors running around?
---
It is the claudette that dcs.
---
Yeah, it registered them in hook.
---
Steve or Hopper is most likely what they will do. But I would kill for Nancy :/
---
Yeah I literally don't play red ranks because it's garbage. I got to rank 1 for the achievement and now I'm sitting pretty at rank 10
---
That's the downside of having so many amazing characters. I want them all!
---
Oh I know I agree you can do totems in most games without any issue. Of course sometimes you can't because of x reasons, but imo mostly you can.
---
I just know people think that breaking totem is a stupid counter to noed and that it should be nerfed because it rewards bad plays.
---
I once hit a meg but it didn‚Äôt register until she was halfway across the map, I couldn‚Äôt find her and had to wait for her to bleed out which I felt terrible about but I tried
---
"scream for the camera"
---
i was gonna do Hopper first but then i realized that Steve and Robin were really fun characters. Don't get me wrong, i still like Hopper.
---
But I don't want to go against someone who is a few ranks above me because I'm not guaranteed a 4k/s
---
If someone is crying about this match up while bringing an ebony mori and meta perks,  you just know they want the easiest game as humanly possible and will blame anyone and anything but themself. No point arguing with whiny ass baby players.
---
It hurts my pride
---
Well actually Claudettes for me. I just cant see them when they hide, depending on the map.
---
You really think rank 6 to rank 3 survivors are a big deal? 
---
Ive seen lots worse. And its not abuse when people truly want to just play with friends. They need to work on emblem scoring for Survivors (which they said they are doing) to make it easier to rank up or stay constant.
---
XD. I‚Äôm glad you like it!
---
People cry to much about the perks in this game when it comes to NOED it‚Äôs simple break 5 totems, and they even give you two perks to help, small game and detectives hunch unless your running a map and problem solved! Hope they implement a totem counter for survivors and also make it 1000bp instead of 600 and 1500 for hex totems. More people would probably start cleansing them and killers would stop using NOED all together.
---
Scoops Ahoy Uniform in the shop
---
Yeah, I play both sides
---
Yeah I used to use it for an end game Freddy build but since the need to remember me I switched my entire build and I never even got to endgame anyway. But when I did the good survivors found noed almost immediately or it never popped cause all the totems where down before the last gen but if I played against trash survivors they wouldn't get the last 2 gens done and if they did they complained about noed and I would find like 3 totems that aren't noed still standing
---
Imo legion is better than bubba or wraith but i dont play them as much anyway so might be wrong
---
No but really, I understand what you‚Äôre saying (and I didn‚Äôt downvote). I honestly don‚Äôt mind that they‚Äôre IN the game but with no casual mode and some add-one/Moro‚Äôs basically being just ‚ÄúNOED but faster‚Äù, ‚ÄúRemove Killer weakness(es‚Äù, or ‚ÄúRemove 1 player from the game‚Äù, it feels bad to go up against some builds. I honestly think things like Moris and Tombstone Myers should guarantee an auto safety pip.
---
... i had to dc because otherwise i wouldve been stuck in that match for hours, i didnt dc for the survivors sake
---
DD crossover = Upvote
---
I def don‚Äôt see Robin being an option. And we just got Jane...so Nancy is a no go. It most likely will be Hopper though JUST because Fortnite did Demagorgon and Hopper. 
---
Maybe those are the two they are giving rights for?
---
One liver per vial.
---
Can you make one foucesd on saving and making sure you one when your team mates are unreliable. Or if anyone has some suggestions? much appreciated.
---
I fucking know right. 15 seconds is basically wall hacks for survivors all match. Like what the fuck
---
Now everyone can be wallhack myers
---
This shouldn‚Äôt be a thing. The game shouldn‚Äôt put me in a lobby with killers who‚Äôre from different countries. I‚Äôd rather then not play at all. 
---
I can‚Äôt properly loop because my ping is constantly 120+ or worse. I can‚Äôt vault and not get hit unless the killer is 100 ft away from me (hyperbole). 
---
I can‚Äôt even escape like in the clip because on the killer‚Äôs screen, it happened differently. How am I supposed to play the game or practice when shit like this happens almost every game? 
---
Why is the game so much smoother on PC? Behaviour, please. It‚Äôs been 3 years. -_-
---
hmm
---
quality shitpost, i applaud you sir
---
Every...single...time...
---
Lemme know how it goes.
---
My Trapper mains play him from 2016, probably more than you. 
---
Just because Trapper can wipe out rank 20 teams, that doesn't mean anything. You can do the same with Legion. At least Legion doesn't lose 3 gens to set up his power and you can't counter his power with a Toolbox.
---
Leopard ace they are rare as unicorns but goddamn they can loop for days
---
I‚Äôll run kindred and they‚Äôll still all look at each other like ‚Äú uh are you going or me? ‚Äú
---
Oh, i just like to play nea because of her cosmetics. Thanks for the info :)
---
Hmm
---
Hah! Legion getting that many kills that early! Forgot to tag it as shitpost!
---
Dude are you kidding? I don‚Äôt want the easiest game possible and Idc about the 4k either, but damn 3 of the 4 are at least 5 ranks above me. And that‚Äôs clearly a swf group so had they not quit I would‚Äôve prolly lost my ass hardcore.
---
Now's the time to jump on the Strangers Things bandwagon while it's still fresh/relevant. I'd be shocked if we didn't hear something official within the next few weeks.
---
where did you get that info from?
---
I've had someone complain they were tunnelled after dying third in a match. Sense isn't a priority with these things!
---
Indeed
---
Hex: Become Gay
---
It wasn‚Äôt red, though. I do the same thing. I back out when the connection is red. But even when the connection is yellow or green, it still doesn‚Äôt feel as smooth as it seems on PC. :/
---
You could subvert their expectations and be all, "Heeeeeyyyy," in the chat
---
I‚Äôll be honest when I play killer I don‚Äôt even l notice these I just focus on other things I need to do like patrolling gens or something
---
Missing a few

Issa L
---
Despite the absence of some Survivors/Killers, are their perks still possible to get from just leveling up normally or are they out of the mobile port for the time being?
---
Are teachables still a thing &amp; you have to level up a specific Survivor/Killer to a certain level before their perks pop up on others leveling randomly?

Hilarious üòÜ

Hex: Homosexual Ground
---
What are the benefits of moonwalking and can you tell me what is "tunneling" as well as "Noed"
---
Really? How so?
---
I‚Äôm finally winning some games as killer! I‚Äôve had the game for a few weeks since the sale (as a life long horror fan, the licensed characters dragged me in) but I was awful with killer and just have been grinding for some survivor perks and having fun. Last night I said screw it and ran some killer games, and started getting the hang of it! My goal is to be equally good with both sides
---
Not sure about Missing perks But yes there is teachables
---
I don‚Äôt remember calling anything toxic... and go over my other comment about those perks I covered that ground already further down.
---
Overclownfidence is a slow and hilarious killer.
---
going easy mode I see
---
 where do I go in the tut. to practice?
---
good
---
I kinda wish that plunderer's had a pop-up like prove thyself in the bottom right, but i know why it doesn't.
---
2 of us were running these perks and when I got the chest the other guy followed me around and made noise to give me away. Still survived because I got a key and left that guy to die on a hook
---
The only major skill difference is accuracy, it‚Äôs night and day easier with a mouse, it‚Äôs the reason nurse is better in pc, as far as mind gaming ext it‚Äôs the same.
---
No, legit taking advantage. She puked on me for like 5 mins before even hitting me, then stood over me shaking her head lol. So she for sure deserved it.
---
Not really directed at you, but the person who was whining about how averaging out ranks is unfair even considering the circumstances.
---
I do agree matchmaking sucks, but I have seen a lot worse. I play solo and constantly get teammates who are rank 10 and 9 when I am rank 1-3 against a rank 12 killer. Same issue when I play killer. That being said, I still don't see why you would think you would automatically lose against  red rank survivors when there isn't that much of a difference between purple and red. Everyone on this sub likes to chant ranks don't matter...until they apparently do?
---
Using empathy to track where the killer is by who he downs so you can continue doing gens in peace mmmm perfecto.
---
I can understand why nurse and huntress are at s higher skill tier but apart from that lets not all shit on console players
---
That sounds fucking awesome ngl
---
You sure?
---
The perk is useful...
---
PS4 controls don't allow good nurse play. She's only balanced over there.
---
actually he can say what he wants. wasnt even bitching about it either. Just asked why it happened. lol you people sometimes.

Legion is just weaker Wraith and Bubba can snowball at least.

That's what I thought as well, but I can't design it :D
---
How
---
Eh, it can give you a grab escape on L√©ry's every once in a while, but I agree about it needing a buff.
---
95% of the time it's totally worthless.
---
They did not get the license from Scream. They got the license from the guy who designed the mask. They cannot use Scream character cosmetics. That's why we didn't get Sidney with him.
---
I can try to within the week when i have some time
---
_an all time classic_
---
If you‚Äôre in us and wanna play with me so we both have terrible ping playing with other countries you could add me
---
You can use this argument for everyone lol
---
nope
---
Looks like I need to cull my friends list real quick lmao
---
It would be awesome to see that bug but with balletina feng
---
They dont need to be injured but otherwise they are right. Just get up behind then and tap m1
---
I agree. But then the killers will find out and look for the hooks before picking you up. Which might make Flip Flop, tenacity, and/or unbreakable builds a little more usable. Maybe. The struggle should stay the same.
---
I have not noticed it but I'll keep an eye on it. Thank you for sharing. Side note are you PC or console. I play strictly PC.
---
I still don't know how to moonwalk

username: Jaaaco
---
looking for 4 people to rate my skills as nurse in kill your friends lobbby :P
---
i prefer skill around rank 10 but rank 1 is still good xd
---
And they dont need to heal if they stay apart.
---
Trapper be like: don't worry bud your doing great your making me proud
---
They may need to go through said grass ir their routeing would be inoptimal and land the trapler a hit.
---
Happened to me once, not even 5 min into the match, one gets hooked and decides to disconnect, after that another player disconnects too for no reason at all,  so is just me and another survivor left... I try to do gens but the other survivor takes the killer to me, I believe they are farming points? Since they take me down hook, unhook, heal etc...  so I thought I knew what was goin on and I let the killer use me. we are all getting our points, I do gens to get points as well, but  then the killer actually kills me, without a warning and lets the other survivor do gens and takes him to the hatch... I don‚Äôt know if they were friends or I did something wrong but it did piss me off :(  
---
Text him asking him why he let the other survivor go and not both:/ that was uncool, he said he didn‚Äôt let me live because I wasn‚Äôt nice?? And then I was like ‚Äúbut I let you farm and everything:(‚Äú and he was like ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt let me do anything, I was the one controlling the game‚Äù and I was like oh hell no I could have run or disconnected too, I didn‚Äôt have to let him use me for farming üò° like was a mutual thing.
---
I once body blocked at the gate while NOED was active as Quentin sooo not all Quentins.
---
Started playing him for pharmacy stayed for overly Altruistic plays and team healing.
---
Can you link me, when you post it? I would really like to see it
---
If we are talking IQ of Survivors then it stays consistent at around 1 to 5. for killers nothing changes besides Huntress ,Nurse,Clown because it's easier to hit hatchets get good blinks and bottle throws.
---
When it tries teaching you how to do generators, just ignore it and practice
---
Of course. You can check my profile as well if you wanna check if i can do it justice
---
Shitpost?
---
More like Repost
---
I like using the add-on that makes your terror radius cover the whole map, so much fun
---
f
---
You know that even if you are far away from one another I can still down you right?
---
Thanks! :3
---
Like a regular killer sure :p
---
Every time I get faced with red ranks, I get stomped on. When they‚Äôre in purple like rank 7-5 then they‚Äôre good survivors that are still smart and can get away as well. The games really just don‚Äôt seem that fair when they‚Äôre red ranks because they‚Äôre just that skilled. (Incoming get gud!)
---
It annoys me so much when survivors Dc against my nurse tbh
---
Well ... at least they have Nurse in the right spot.
---
Legacy 2 Ash?
---
When I finally got Merciless Spirit after thirty tries, I ran and fan girled to my wife.
---
oh, alright. also, does the survivor have to be doing a slow vault or does it work during a fast vault too?
---
&gt; If you put a low amp filament and then a low life battery on a utility flashlight, it'll last about 20 seconds. If you put the long life battery and then the filament it lasts 22 seconds. Thats enough time for almost 2 blinds.
---
Context matters
---
I always get it so much worse when I play Quentin, I don't even play toxic but as soon as I finally pull off a good loop I get BMed on the hook. So ridiculous
---
Yeah but you are one hit down plus I know where your friends are because frenzy :P Also I've been playing legion for God knows how long and to this day the tactic of splitting off has never worked because I still catch up.
---
I'm at rank 8 PS4 and I'm starting to recognise infinites and I can consistently loop killers 
---
Hopefully if I get 1-5 I can see if that's true
---
You mean opened.
---
they have to be injured for a window or pallet grab. not for a gen or locker grab
---
I was saying survivors are stupid but yeah I guess that works too
---
looks like the kids are out for summer, they must have a mental problem if theyre that mad they died in a video game
---
itll work on both but it's easier on a slow vault for obvious reasons
---
this, the detection comes from the origin of your camera, and your body blocks it.
---
Which ones did I miss
---
Well sure, if frenzy isnt on a 20 second cooldown after getting to me, and even if you do know whete my friends are, what are you going to do, leave me alone? It doesnt matter IF you catch up, what matters is when.
---
The realisation it was mummy sneaking in your room at night.
---
Hillbilly and Nurse are probably the two killers I‚Äôll never get adepts for.
---
oh okay, thanks!
---
Tunneling is not going for someone who just got off the hook. It's ignoring the whole game and everyone else in it to chase one survivor. If I'm in a chase when you get unhooked and I'm not near, I won't go back. If I'm right next to the hook and your team mate farms you. It's their fault. Not mine.
---
Executed with impunity!
---
Or it will double
---
Glad you‚Äôre in the subreddit then
---
Nope I disagree. Claudettes have actually been willing to help. Whereas Megs always unhook at the wrong time or perform stupid ass actions. They're always the first to be killed for a reason. Every Meg I encounter ruins my generators or runs across the map like an idiot. I always leave the Lobby when there's more than two of them...
---
It‚Äôs a beta
---
Add using good perks and looping strong structures like Ironwork's window.
---
He's in my top 3 killers because he's the only one I legitimately find scary other than Freddy and bear head Huntress. 
---
I never camp as killer because I've played too much survivor to camp. I like to play Insidious Leatherface not to camp survivors but actually gens, Haddonfield and the game are so fun for using insidious to get in a hiding spot right next to a gen and as soon as I see or hear a survivor I start the chainsaw and come out of nowhere after them. It's so much fun, especially when they freeze or run into a wall. So fun to feel like you legitimately scared someone
---
The only audio issue I have been experiencing is when I'm using Susie or Julie skins, they still have Frank's voice
---
It is already.
---
At least you didn't get hatemail from the guy that you let go. I once gave someone hatch and had him proceed to tell me I'm an idiot because I ran past so many hooks and he was able to wiggle off and escape. Saying "I was letting you have hatch" is apparently an excuse :/
---
Ahhh. I didnt know it was injured for a window grab a
---
There‚Äôs a tutorial you can use
---
Moonwalking is just the act of manipulating the survivor controls to walk backwards. It has no benefit beyond looking cool to some, maybe as a way to show ‚Äúskill‚Äù. 
---
Tunneling refers to a killer focusing down a single survivor continuously, usually after they are unhooked. Survivors sometimes call it toxic, but it‚Äôs still an allowed tactic that the devs allow. 
---
Noed is a killer perk that activates after the exit gates are powered that allows a killer to 1 hit down survivors and gives them a small speed boost. It is a totem perk, so it becomes bound to a totem when activated. If the totem is cleansed then the perk deactivates, and if the survivors cleansed all 5 totems before the gates are powered then it simply will not activate.
---
The only way for you to outrun my frenzy is if you manage to get to other side of the map faster then me or some shit because when that killer instinct goes off that means you are in my radius and you are easy pickings even if you have exhaustion perks. And yeah if I hit you I am then going for your friends because now you have to stand still for 10s doing nothing and then heal too which is going to waste a shit ton of time or don't heal at all and I can down you easily. As you said it doesn't matter if I catch up because I will, what matters is when.
---
Add ‚ÄúSitting on hook into Phase 2 with Decisive Strike‚Äù and I‚Äôll join this game.
---
Imagine he can't move at all when observed, just teleport to dull totem locations.
---
Why are people downvoting he is doing it for the meme
---
We should wait until the ptb because they even said rthe numbers might change
---
oh yea chase music is barely hearable too for me
---
Most survivor perks need a serious buff.
---
And killers wonder why survivors use the same 6 or so perks.
---
looks nice
---
I wasn‚Äôt bitching at all I was just asking so I could do it better next time.
---
Well if you have green or above addons on a small map then yeah, otherwise you wont be anle to close distance fast enough if im already out of range.
---
Exactly, that‚Äôs why Survivors get annoyed at killers. They‚Äôre literally in control of the fate of the game and the fun to be had for 4 players.
---
Play your game your way, survivors always get salty when your doing good.
---
I honestly thought that Chucky was a bad idea until I read this- I actually really want chucky now lmao
---
Or they can avoid the trap with Dead Hard ...
---
Thank you very much I guess 360 has the same purpose as moonwalking "to look cool"
---
I kinda get where they're comming from, but seeing all those downvotes still stings
---
I think Perseverance would be better if it was token based and not exhaustion, but I actually love the idea. The writers block quote is genius.
---
Damn, that sucks. Honestly stuff like that makes me even question why I let survivors go sometimes lmao
---
If they know its there, and that only works once.
---
ahhh ok thx. and btw should I be at 50 fps to help w/ moonwalking or can I be at 144.
---
Quite a bit of perks need a Update.
---
Like I said, you're almost red yourself, the ranking isn't that uncommon. My killer is rank 5 and all my lobbies consist of red ranks man, gotta just get used to it.
---
Hey, man, if you can find me some programmers I'd love to run project management on it!
---
I feel this. I wish I could just load into KYF so I could practice running.
---
honestly im with you on this one. plundering gives me such joy that i want people to suffer for taking that from me üò≠ü§¨
---
#how could you make Jeff even more superior
---
Quality edits, unlike most of the meme-tage garbage that's around :P
---
Remake one is.
---
Yea im pretty sure its broken
---
This keeps happening to me on mobile
---
Left Behind comes to mind lol
---
Thanks! I appreciate it!
---
How‚Äôd you get access to the beta? I‚Äôve already pre registered but nothing has happened yet
---
This keeps happening to me too. I have survivors pop a gen infront of me when I'm stuck in the pull off animation.
---
Juat gotta take that risk
---
I say I would lose bc I have less than 200 hours in the game and the highest I‚Äôve reached rank wise is 5. So history dictates I get wrecked. And I say it‚Äôs a swf cus I play on Xbox and 90% of the time I‚Äôve played against a group like that they have been.
---
I would love to read all the stupid shit that's written in in-game reports :D
---
Do you not get matched with people you blocked?
---
It really be like that sometimes.
---
It‚Äôs usually a last ditch attempt to avoid a hit. It almost never works, but when it does it looks cool, yeah. And no problem!

Nurse =DC. No point in facing a killer that bypasses windows and pallets a survivors only defence
---
"got your chin with my strong hand"
---
Same for killers.
---
Beat me to it
---
Simply walk backwards. It takes a bit of positioning knowledge, but eventually you can nullify most wall loops against most survivors.
---
So youre trying to make every survivor perk shit so they are all equally as shit?
---
I will bring some s'more and ghost(face) stories while you camp with this little ol scarecrow on the hook. Crows don't seem to understand me.  Someone needs to listen to these campfire tales of a man in a leather mask made of skin that is round these parts at precisely this time every night.
---
Liz is the superior survivor change my mind
---
I play console
---
What outfit u got
---
Flayed* 
---
Survivor: Nope not eleven she‚Äôs too young and no i wouldn‚Äôt want to play as her anyways. I would take Hopper as a yes any day same with Joyce Byers.
---
Killer: The flayer aka Billy, nope. I‚Äôd rather have a simple Demogorgon or Mindflayer. 
---
Map: Yes
---
Gotta love that peer to peer
---
With bill getting added to console maybe theyll look at it
---
*screams in legion*
---
I hope so. Maybe let us see the hatch aura in an 8 meter radius of us.
---
Oh shit mr piper its you again
---
It's enough, Trapper has just 5 traps and almost all of them are spread out in the map, most of the time, you can't place more than 2-3.
---
... punishments for DC's &lt;3
---
I found my bubble gum a little bit ago
---
Glad to heat it brother
---
Adrenaline doesn't count as an exhaustion perk in my opinion, as it bypasses it.
---
Size of the map doesn't matter but addons do. Duration addons are really really strong on legion because they help me get from person to person quickly. As for map size it's not a problem really there is so far you can go when he is barreling down on you. The only way I can think of you getting out of range is when you see that someone got hit in frenzy is to run in the opposite direction but that isn't the best solution for quite a few reasons. For one, you just stopped doing a gen and ran towards nothing and chances are the legion has duration addons so you need to keep running even more. That's precious time taken from doing gens because not only did you stop working on an gen but you also run away from it so you have to go all the way back to it or find a new one. Two, you need to know exactly where the legion is at the moment so you know where to run towards. More often than not you might just run towards him. Three, running is not guaranteed to save you because if you are in his terror radius and someone gets stabbed you best assume that he is booking it to you and even if you have sprint burst or balanced or whatever he will still most of the time catch up.

You can often afford to detour when you have a survivor hooked, and 2 or 3 can still do a lot.
---
AFTER hooking. you gotta say no homo AFTER you do some gay shit, seems like a small thing but you dont wanna be omega gay just because you said no homo too soon.
---
Try Doctor with Distressing, gives away everyone's positions and makes breaking even/ 1 popping easy.
---
You get a good handling on how to counter Spirit if you play her. If you have Spine Chill and Iron Will  you get a great advantage against her. You can predict where she is at and even know when she is not faking if Spine Chill lights down but her "husk" is still looking at you standing still. I've vaulted over pallets right in her husk's face after staring at her for like 15 seconds when she realized I was not gonna vault. 
---
Flashlights on some loops can also deny her mindgame ability if you flashlight her face. She is unable to enter phase walk or maintain it if she is blinded. You can blind her in phase walk to force her out and/or disorient her to juke her. 
---
If you have none of these options to juke then scratchmark juke. Run to a new spot in a curcle then go back to your previous spot in the oppositr direction. I've gained a lot of distance on them doing that when they realize they read it wrong. Scratchmarks are delayed.
---
The type of Spirit you play against should also be how you play against her. Passive/Mindgame Spirits are very easy to juke as you can gain distance leaving loops and predictable.
---
Aggressive Spirits that use Bloody Hair Brooch and Wakizashi Saya for example are harder to dodge in chase and when you realize she has these add-ons attempt to juke her with scratchmarks/leaving loops as soon as you see her stand still.
---
Even half assed Survivors can easily guard a last minute unhook to the gates.  You MIGHT be able to get em back with nurse or spirit, but I wouldn't like my own odds of pulling that off.
---
Oh sure have a naked buff dude costume a dick flopping around wouldn't get distracting or make them bump up the rating
---
Well it was in his add ons, simple solution is to disable them, but nope we were left it deal with it and took BhVR weeks to even put out a statement on banning people and then finally patched it. But I gave BhVR props for patching it quick and I hope they keep that moment moving forward with new bugs, glitches, exploits ect...
---
Your forgetting that you need to be going between 2 more survivors to get full use out of frenzy; i could also try and pallet stun you to break you out if you are close enough which even if you do get a hit, it will only be on me. Legion has a lot of counters, good survivors wont be together, you can be tremendously mitigated by not healing and looped like a normal killer while you try and get the second hit.
---
It‚Äôs common knowledge that Billy has a really long hit-box. He could normally hit you through windows normally but in this clip he probably had long guide bar. It does seem unfair but it‚Äôs not a glitch, it‚Äôs just the way they made him.
---
Ok I don't have ruin yet I was waiting for it to be in shrine of secrets is it worth grinding for hag levels?
---
You're an idiot.
---
Bubba and insudious
---
Kate confirmed final girl. This is how the movie ends
---
Its terrible for killers, good for survivors wym
---
Flash lights really are at best annoying. 
---
You only have to offset your point of view like 3 inches and the flashlight stops blinding you. 
---
Then just lung and whip your mouse to cleave the whole area lol. 
---
You do this like 3 times and they stop using lightsabers.
---
The grim reaper is a British gangsta goth?
---
I use lithe and dance with me, I love this map üòÇ
---
Unfortunately this allows campers to not get gen rushed, securing them additional kills as less gets done while they stand in front of a hook. Given that it‚Äôs very unlikely they will ever mess with the hook times, the killer is going to need to be given an additional objective as well to prevent this. Tunneling too....if survivors can‚Äôt rush gens, then killer‚Äôs can‚Äôt rush kills.
---
Just embrace the sweet sweet salt dude, its the best part of playing killer, toxic ass survivors getting salty and crying lmao
---
Completely optional, try running Doctor with Distressing (don't use Moniter and Abuse) and see if your good enough at tracking/killing to not need it. You should be fine.
---
The exact same can be said for killer perks.
---
Some people make it blatantly obvious that they're stream sniping (probably because DBD has no rules against it) so half-brained people will apply that experience to any situation where things go sour for them. Reasonable streamers will probably just sigh loudly and not call out their suspicion.
---
There‚Äôs also HybridPanda (the most non-toxic killer I‚Äôve ever seen) and GibsAndPieces. These duo are amazing to watch and funny as hell.
---
Here is my idea:
---
You start out as a flayed, after putting a survivor in a dying state you put the mind flayer juices in them and they can‚Äôt get hooked for a limited time. If all survivors have the juices in them, you transform into the mind flayer and have one hits and immune to pallets
---
Are you on pc or console? I‚Äôm on pc, but I could see 360ing being way more effective on console with controller killers
---
I think the Demogorgan would be a neat killer. As for survivors I don't think we should have children be playable. Everyone in the game is supposed to be at least 18 with the exception of Quentin and Laurie who they aged up I think. Plus with Eleven in particular it'd be weird to play as her and not be able to really use her powers. I wouldn't mind Nancy as a survivor.
---
Balanced landing ftw
---
You hear the hatch in an 8 meter radius. It should be at least 16.
---
This looks like it means the survivor is dcing since it mentions clensing the ruin. But still, they should play it out. You can always push through a ruin.
---
It's so rare to double pip on rank1 compared how easy it is to survive and escape to do the survivor adept achievements. It's stupid imho. But ok.  
---
What's the perfect scenario to double pip?  
---
Triple hook everyone?
---
Just an FYI, BHVR gave a hard No on control inversion in the past.  Of course, we'll all know how the definition of "never" changes with them, so who knows.
---
Ghostface's detections are more inconsistent than the hitbox on Huntress's hatchets. And that's *saying* something. Sometimes I'll be right up his ass and not reveal him, sometimes I'll see the tiniest little sliver of his cape behind a tree and reveal him.
---
My bad, I did mean to say opened.
---
Better late than never.
---
Yeah sometimes it can look like tunnelling but even I‚Äôll say as a survivor main that it isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs the fault of the person trying to unhook at the wrong damn time. Tunnelling someone is when you have perfect opportunity to go after other people and yet you still persist after the one person and obsess over getting them killed, before moving on to the next. Basically, I agree
---
I bring my rank 10 friend with me into rank 7  games but we keep getting put with rank 14's and I don't understand
---
Claudette‚Äôs have a track record of being the most piece of shit teammates ever. Not even Megs can compare. At least megs attempt to do a gen.
---
You cant use your power to gen patrol: 1. It's too slow. 2. It has a 20 second cooldown. 3. You're unable to see any scratch marks. 4. You have a 32 meter terror radius. 5. You get a 4 second stun at the end. 6. Power drains for each normal hit. Legion is nowhere near A or B tier, he simply doesnt have enough chase potential and map pressure, and another thing, Deep Wound is laughable
---
LOL no. If you are getting paired against scratched mirror Myers then yes it can be difficult, which is why 95% of scratched mirror Myers burn a Lery's offering. 
---
But nurse, hillbilly, and huntress all get shit on with that map.
---
Imagine playing generator simulator without any new modes for this long
---
Ah I got ya, must have misread it. But I agree just play through it whether your the killer or survivor...don‚Äôt dc
---
Well, you ARE a prick! Piss off!
---
Probably a glitch, one time it said I de-ranked from 7 to 8 after a kill your friends game.
---
Can you show any footage or pics from and game so we see what youre talking about?
---
Playin dbd mobile early I see
---
I almost did it once... one of them knew what I was doing and hid in a locker so I wouldn‚Äôt kill her
---
Again if you aren't together then that just makes you easy pickings. You can't heal unless you have a medkit or self care but a medkit has limited uses and self care is a huge huge time waster. It also takes longer for you to complete gens (I know it's better for survivors to spread out in general because more gens get done but that rarely happens even in high ranks) As for looping, when you are an one hit down it's a lot easier to get them than when they are fully healed. If I see that a chase is dragging too long what I do is just I frenzy them again and go for others. Keep in mind tho, I've yet to be properly looped by a survivor with deep wounds, and the chances of loops dragging too long are really really slim and you know why? Because most of the time survivors are caught with their knickers in a jostle. They are in some weird place and by the time they reach a loop I either downed them or closed the gap so now they are forced to drop the pallet.
---
I don't have footage, but I do have some other screenshots.
---
The point is you should t have to go out of the way to use a build for the map to be good, it should be good regardless of what build your using.
---
Ooft.
---
As long as it is a fair distance I think it is the most logical buff for it.
---
Would there be a safety net? Like, say... The first two times per month, you aren't penalized.
---
Nice upvotes bro
---
This game is perfect. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it.
---
Ok fellas here are some changes that I will make and post again:
---
 1) not eleven but either hopper or scoops ahoy Steve
---
2) how the flayer would work :
---
 You start out as a flayed, after putting a survivor in a dying state you put the mind flayer juices in them and they can‚Äôt get hooked for a limited time. If all survivors have the juices in them, you transform into the mind flayer and have one hits and immune to pallets
---
3) we need Starcourt
---
I guess, but my opinion is that it‚Äôs not that bad. I feel the game map is the worst if anything. Again that‚Äôs just my opinion.
---
I didn‚Äôt think it was a glitch, but you can clearly see the saw was outside the window. It just seems not fair, I guess. What‚Äôs the point of vaulting then.
---
How do you survive against a scratched mirror Myers? I turn my headset volume up all the way but by the time I hear breathing he‚Äôs already walking through a door and hits me. If somehow win a chase my victory is short lived because he can always cut you off.
---
Yea I‚Äôd have to agree, craven was on fire with movies in that timeframe
---
try getting lerys on nurse...
---
How is it good when is mostly unsafe pallets tho?
---
I would but I give myself such a headache when I draw because I keep beating myself up over being a perectionist, and as you can see, quality is far from it haha. Warms my heart having someone actually ask me to draw though
---
Are you playing as billy or the mind flayer? Who has control?
---
No but I would like to see a new mechanic in the game that makes it more fun for the survivors and gives more time for the killer to kill instead of getting gen rushed.
---
pallets arent the only way to avoid a killer. there's a fuckton of windows and the entire map is a los breaker
---
Again what? He never said anything like that
---
Sometimes if you drop off the edge you can get hatch. You can also try to walk around the map to the other gate and walk out and back in to see if that works.
---
But yeah, this is a game breaking bug that comes back way too often.
---
I hate when the person that was useless the entire trial escapes but I wouldn't message the killer and then try to report themü§£
---
Fair enough. The show was actually pretty good. I liked it.
---
Playing as Billy obviously, under the mind flayers control like in the show lol.
---
i dont think anyone likes or prefers this map unless they‚Äôre using things like wallbreaking add ons or a rainbow map
---
Bruh me too, I was huntress too. But I let one person escape because I wanted to be nice my first game.
---
Tunnelling exists it‚Äôs just not what people think. Like if you‚Äôre ignoring body-blocking healthy survivors, ignoring objectives to try and find the injured person, proxy camping them, choosing them over other injured people to go after when the other injured person would‚Äôve been easier to get but ya know had less hooks or something
---
That‚Äôs tunnelling. And it‚Äôs different to just downing the previously hooked survivor bc a) they‚Äôre right there in front of you having been unhooked stupidly or b) its them or their healthy friend. So your definition is right it‚Äôs not tunnelling, but tunnelling does exist.
---
And it‚Äôs also not the unhooked survivors fault if they weren‚Äôt given an actual safe unhook (but it‚Äôs also not the killers fault for putting them back down, it‚Äôs all on the unhooker for not TRYING to protect them)
---
I love this map for its theme though
---
cant you 99 it? Or do you only get points once its fully opened?
---
I really think something needs to be done about that style of play. That buff yo urban evasion was cool at first but seeing what it‚Äôs done to survivors play style is beyond saddening. I‚Äôm ok with cautious players wanting to be cautious but that‚Äôs just not what this is. It‚Äôs selfish players who don‚Äôt interact with anything but one gen then wait for everyone to die and grab hatch. They need to have basic knowledge of how to run the killer or make a save but a lot just make bad plays and get rewarded for three genning the team or never taking a hook for teammates.

Is it tough plying in a mask? Have to ask.
---
‚ÄúPretty good job so far.‚Äù
---
I tried to carry him (David) to the hatch, but he kept struggling and going for the gates :c
---
Because you don't really need pallets on that map, most of the space is taken up by the ridiculous building loops. You can easily run the building windows, and the fences.
---
Nobody understands the plight of Ace Mains mon ami ;-;

Joke's on you, I'm unemployed and I made this for my bf who I only see on the weekends bc he works 80 hours per week.

---
Yea ik I was trying to make a point how your closer to playing the mind flayer controlling billy
---
Rank 18 noob searching for laidback group to play. PC, EU, GMT+1
---
i mean it feels more survivor sided with how many good windows and line of sight breakers there is
---
loop him to death. dont ever let your guard down, try not to leave your loop. know where your safe places are if youre on a gen.
---
yea he has wallhacks and imo he benefits from lerys more than any other killer but he's slow and his lunge is actually ass. also, im unsure if it's a bug or intended but anytime i play SM i never get bloodlust no matter how long i chase. that means milk your pallet as hard as you can
---
 his power with sm comes from being able to sneak up and scare the piss out of you, but he's essentially no lunge/blink nurse in a chase. use that against him and he'll leave. just don't get snuck up on
---
You don‚Äôt sprint across the map? Lol jk lag is awful. It always has been on consoles
---
Fast vault‚Äôs normally juke him out fast enough. You could also try window fakes
---
10/10 accuracy
---
What an unloved, strange format.
---
Guess I‚Äôll slug
---
difference is, killers have an alternative that is almost as fruitful (just chasing the other guy) while survivors have the option of 
---
A. wait around for an arbitrary amount of time
---
B. do totems 
---
C. search chests
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
The biggest thing I see that most Billy's do wrong is how they use their chainsaw.
---
You should go for chainsaw hits whenever possible. And they are quite easy to get, especially when survivors try to avoid m1 hits.
---
If you aren't too far behind, dont chainsaw up th them. You dont save any distance when the cooldown happens.
---
As for routes, they change map to map and each map is generated randomly so I can't really give you tips on that. But as you can you can figure out routes that work and will get a better feel for the chainsaw and what turns you can/can't make.
---
Dont respect pallets. Dont necessarily swing through them either. Find the balance of swinging/not swinging but dont respect them.
---
The faster the pallets are gone the better.
---
I thought he was free...
---
Oh damn I'm sorry to hear that
---
I just looked my stuff and I'm not having that issue. It might be a console problem.

I thought so too and it took me a month but I did it! You can, too!!

Shouldn‚Äôt you be crouching in a corner, you Immersed Claud?
---
Yeah and we don't even live together so it's just ass. 
---
I'm glad you have the next three days off tho. You deserve it for working hard. =D
---
I'll hook them both with pleasure
---
I'm more impressed that they didnt wait for 309% more BP
---
Billy is NOT easy against good survivors, but you have a chance with him and with good skill.
---
Or Huntress.
---
Two strategies, You can gen patrol and listen for partially completed gens, or you can run whispers to know if someone's nearby when you blink
---
I have a flashlight guide that shows proof of this concept. I've also heard from other players that are way better than me about how medkit charges work. Green battery + low amp filament lasts 2 seconds longer than a low amp filament + green battery.
---
What the hell were you doing for the first 30seconds?
---
I mean, obviously patrol gens, it's literally what any sane killer does, and I tried whispers but it's extremely ineffective, a 32 meter range is just to large of a distance for me to actually know where a survivor is.
---
I'm so glad toxic people like you will be suitably punished soon enough.
---
The only Legion add on that actually does anything.
---
Hmm. Thanks for the feedback! Yeah the numbers aren't all gonna be pitch perfect considering I'm doing this at work in my free time like I said. But your point is valid and I think you're right! I'll probably up the attack window and decrease the Fully Shadowed vision a bit.
---
I honestly don't know why they did that. Like a normal player isn't gonna think that but yup.
---
''accidentally made him depressed''. why did that make me laugh so hard after looking at the drawing
---
With the family angle removed, I‚Äôm convinced Michael‚Äôs motive is that he literally wants to scare people to death. That explains his theatrics: stealing the headstone, posing bodies, making sure he had *the* mask, etc. You are his audience until you become his medium. He doesn‚Äôt kill the baby because the baby isn‚Äôt afraid of him (it stops crying when it sees him) so he loses interest in it.
---
Shelter Woods is way worse
---
''he's a bit sad'' I seriously cant stop laughing. loving your drawing tho!
---
Yeah thats pretty toxic. I just wish more people could see it from both sides. Like im a survivor main but i realize how cancerous things can be on the killers side of things. But the thing is, we need each other. Without survivors and killers, no one could play this damn game!
---
Well, the first dc without punishment is for the people who DON'T dc frequently. What if an emergency happens and someone needs to leave?
---
lmao, i thought i would get downvotes
---
this implies you pronounce it as wrath
---
Wow. Can't be kind on DBD.
---
Um what?
---
Yeah, that too. The outcome of the game is usually dependent on what the survivors do and not the killer's skill, unless that killer is a god Nurse.
---
Most things I see survivors say is no tunneling and no camping what other things to ppl say?
---
Lit
---
Same thing happened to me earlier. Attacking seemed to work in getting me out of it
---
Adrenaline is a perk that rewards survivors for doing the objective. 
---
NOED is a perk that rewards failure.
---
Dude, this is amazing! I‚Äôve tried editing before and it‚Äôs painful, so congratulations! (you‚Äôre also like tens times better than me)
---
And stay out until you mature.
---
idk I guess you wouldn't have this idea if wraith didn't sound similar to rat in your mind
---
Yeah you got freddy right though. Pedo. Same with doctor. I think michael should go right above them.
---
No, just an Oh Shit! moment
---
I almost DC when I found out that if someone is on a hook, it takes me longer as the killer to attack someone and then get staggered than for someone to come and pick up  a person off a hook and then they both run away with me having no chance to catch them. Like... wow. I didn't get stabbed by a knife, but yet my stagger is larger than either player involved? yeesh
---
"Harder" not "impossible". Unless the killer chooses to just leave and give up on the basement person, they basically can't get out. Even with borrowed time, you mostly just trade your life, and, depending on the killer, if they have some form of insta down. You can't do anything. I.e. basement promotes face-camping/ proxy camping which results in one person literally not getting to play the game. They just get to hit space bar. A second path into the basement simply introduces a small amount of counterplay with extremely reduced toxicity. No game should ever allow a playstyle that completely prevents someone from being able to play the game. And before you say "don't get caught or don't die near the basement", killers are supposed to catch survivors. They are made to and balanced around it. Iron grasp and agitation remove the counterplay of "avoiding the basement".
---
im done dude. i even let the door hit me in the ass on the way out.
---
Wich un the end of the Day causes the Killer to be rewarded for unfun gameplay for the survivors and un certain times Killers continue to do that or the team is just pretty stupid lol
---
For a teen drama is was made really well, season 3 is coming out soon btw and it will have he original scream mask and a new cast of teens.
---
When you ask your dog what they have in their mouth and they swallow it
---
if you do a farming game it's easy. just triple blink while looking down while someone is on a gen.
---
gaming the system B)
---
That actually sounds like a great concept. When the Legion was first announced at the Game Awards I honestly thought they were going to be able to disguise themselves as a survivor. I want a killer thats can disguise itself. That would be awesome.

And the worst part is I really wanted to get good with her on PS4 so during the event I leveled her way past 50 to get the parks I wanted. I get stomped hard with her and I have 31 event cakes,12 BPS, and about 15 puddings so I have to keep getting stomped on till those are gone lol.

I mostly play survivor, but I enjoy killer much more. I am rank 1 on survivor every season, simply because I play it more. I float at rank 5 or so on killer, occasionally going up or down a bit. I never play nurse or billy. I primarily play pig, doctor, and now ghostface. I never need the op killer or the op basement camping strats. I often let 1 survivor go every game, just because that's what I like to do. The amount of times I actually get basement hooks is almost never. Only when I kill someone looking at shack. Even so, I wont camp or proxy camp them. I have though, been epically face camped or proxy camped on basement hooks when 4 or 5 generators remain. And you know what happens? Someone tries to save me, we both die. OR someone tries to save me, trades, and they die. OR they face camp me till I die. My survivor allies, whether in comma or not, find out im being face camped, leave me. And go finish gens. BUT. I die. And there are still gens left because my first hook is LITERALLY not enough time to deal 5 gens even with toolboxes. So. I died with no counterplay. That killer goes and gets someone else. Repeats the process. And what happens? Maybe the other 2 get out.  Maybe not. But still 2 people died with no counterplay and the killer got a nice pip or safety while 2 maybe 3 survivors depip because they can't get altruism and you dont get enough points for just doing a few gens.
---
Ill believe that when i see it. Ive went up against multiple nurse mains in the red ranks, and they've all been bullied and ran around the map for 5 gens. The state of console just doesnt allow nurse to be top teir. Its not the fact that people just suck with her, its the fact that consoles are so poorly optimized that is makes playing nurse reliably and consistently impossible. When dedicated servers hit, and the Devs optimize the game more, Nurse will probably become top teir on console, but until then, your better off playing Spirit.

Fair

Shirtless myers isn't funny it's divine how dare you laugh at our big unit Myers

I don‚Äôt think they care too much about the stories now, some people have paragraphs of story &amp; then characters like Meg have essentially an unfinished writing prompt for a backstory.
---
Ghostface is practically an entirely original chapter with licensed cosmetics.
---
That‚Äôs a good question. I honestly don‚Äôt know.
---
That's what got me thinking that this would be great! We also already have another john carpenter monster, so what's stopping another?

One problem: SWF

SWF?
---
Because when you are verses those survivors it doesn‚Äôt matter which killer you play. So most of this discussion is just based on his theoretical power. And theoretically you can get more use out of Trappers power with add ons than you can get out of Legions power ever. Even his ultra rare add on is pretty meh.

yhen i cant see the orange line :(
