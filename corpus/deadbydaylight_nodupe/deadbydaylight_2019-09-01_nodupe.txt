---
Yeah there a tons of other perks but most high ranks use the higher tier ones making the game stale. And I'm not sure how in your mind being able to not have two survivors in a vulnerable state is bad.
---

---
You and every Self-Care hater brings up Sloppy Butcher brings it up as if it is built in a killer's build. It's not. Self-Care is perfectly fine and the only reason it get shitted on here because higher ranks here are filled with SWF players. Play a few solo games and you'll realize while it's not a waste of a slot. Even if it'll never be mandatory.
---
Which is how perks should be btw.
---
True, hopefully the servers are well done so it's not a heavy nerf. It's a pretty good Quality of life for survivors
---
Wow! That IS relatable!
---
As a Dwight main, FUCK THAT DWIGHT
---
I love the game map
---
Yes
---
I came on the idea of this meme because I've got this situation in my last gameü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
---
Yeah. I don‚Äôt want to pick one side cause I look on steam pages and stuff about people saying it‚Äôs not overpowered, just sometimes I feel that way so i don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing wrong or right.
---
I love these types of comments. I can almost see the game unfolding with this freddy.
---
Get new friends.
---
Same
---
We aren't all like this. He's probably trolling though. So I would pay him any mind
---
The game wasn‚Äôt meant to be a Friday the 13th property originally, they clearly weren‚Äôt able to handle the license that came with taking up the offer to turn their generic slasher game into an F13 game. 
---
Although the lawsuit did contribute a bit, it prevented them from adding new content to the game. But they did indeed not handle it at all like they should have
---
Tier 3 tombstone or tombstone piece if your close enough you can grab and mori them
---
I've seen a lot of new players have a hard time against killers (mostly due to the jerks who de-rank to play against new players.)
---
My best advice to you is to keep playing and watch some gameplay videos. Seeing how more experienced people play can help you get a hang of techniques, perk loadouts, and give you overall more knowledge on the game.
---
Like someone else said, playing killer as well will show you what they see and give you an advantage.
---
They will not fix it, they locked it intentionally. In Unreal Engine there is setting to keep X or Y fov. X-option is set by default and this is how game currently operates. You could change it to Y in settings config file and it would actually keep Y-fov same and expand view range on sides. But developers programmatically locked it to X.
---
P.S. I have ultra wide monitor and I am struggling too.
---
Don't insult mommy like that
---
But it could work thanks to the new team up with netflix. Thanks to this team up we have found out that multiple people in the netflix service are big fans of the game which would make it easier for this show
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs good feedback right there. I should play more as a killer, but the rush of escaping death is sometimes too good.
---
Face camping even (if exit gates are open) is still face camping! Lul all killers do it for BP but that just makes it all the better when they get saved.
---
Survivors t bag each other as a greeting you moron! Its how they say hello. Imagine getting salty because someone said hello
---
I don‚Äôt have a clue what any of this is. All I know is dead by daylight and entity. But luckily I‚Äôm a simple man. I see thing I know. I up vote :)
---
Is that your 'thing'? saying something is relatable to unfunny memes and than leaving?
---
Seems to be a lot of nutshells these past few days.
---
Sometimes when get bored, I‚Äôll stand in the basement with bubba. Everyone gets to leave unless they touch my chest. Don‚Äôt touch my chest
---
[removed]
---
Yes. The mods don't care about this dumb shit. So I mock it.
---
I'm going to stop playing DBD until they fix matchmaking, my mentality can't handle the constant "throwing you in the deep end" trope. I want to have fun or a challenge playing this game but playing Killer is leaving me broken and playing Survivor is leaving me frustrated.I will check back after the new DLC and dedicated servers comes out and see how things are but for my own mental health, I'm temporarily leaving this game.
---
To me it's cringe, just stating my opinion, but i know how opinions work on reddit.
---
Consult the 30 posts today stating matchmaking is broken, that‚Äôs how
---
They could always make it so you can toggle it.
---
Doc + 3-genning + Jigsaw Piece = PAIN.
---
nice.
---
yeah i think my pc has the xbox program on it. also this question is just for all platforms but i use pc.
---
Wait is that monitor and abuse on the doctor first you need to get that out of here
---
Freddy or Michael. Both my favorite killers and all I can get is their prestige cosmetics.
---
I figured that they had some kind of built in capture feature. Xbox is about the same except it just clouds to the xbox app and you can save it from there.
---
Fair enough :/
---
#PRAISE
---
They can‚Äôt get cosmetics as easily due to them being licensed killers :(
---
Daddy Myers
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs nice to take a break from tryharding and just chill in a basement. Love when the survivors play along
---
[deleted]
---
My fianc√© and I named the horse Sarah, it makes the map so much more fun to get
---
It would be hard to get cosmetics for him due to him being licensed
---
That‚Äôs a fact
---
Doctor needs a "high tech" looking skin. Like with a stun-baton or something because I find the spikey dildo sort of boring and he doesn't have any futuristic looking skins.
---
He doesnt need a nerf but annoying as hell to play against
---
NA internet
---
I think you played with doge, man. Such farm, much report. :/
---
I see so many people using M&amp;A on doc it makes me sad
---
I did like his hallowblight skin but you are right, a high tech skin would be cool
---
Schoolgirl Spirit
---
Ah... I don't know all the very rare and ultra rare add-ons... the one's like these are so stupid imo because it heavily disrupts the game balance.
---
Imagine pig running back to see this, then crouching to watch you die.
---
Fuck off dude you're unfunny and annoying
---
I thought we had that
---
Mid-Mori disconnects are always funny because you still get the "killed" points + the quitter bonus at the end of the match.
---
Cultured. Natsuki best girl
---
Yeah PS3 didn‚Äôt have the feature and the only way to do it previously was with an elgato (which not everyone can afford the computer and the elgato). There was a huge demand for it and also they added it to PS4 to compete with Microsoft/Xbox.
---
Does being licensed mean they came from a movie? If so why would that prevent cosmetics from being released? That wouldn't break copyright laws because of the right to make parodies of copyrighted content.
---
Doc is strong but not op
---
I got a rank 9 as a rank 16... I just left when he was clearly in a swf and telling his teammates everything
---
I would be fine if its just the Old Mask from the new movie
---
Yes that is what being licensed means. I thought that BHVR would have to ask for permission and potentially pay for cosmetics for licensed characters.
---
Yeah dude if you use deliverance when I'm about to unhook you that's selfish and unhelpful because now I'm not doing gens and you're broken
---
"I am Complete"
---
"FUUUuuuUUck"
---
"yes you are Fucked, Shit out of luck"
---
I would love the old mask
---
People would just circle the hook with old borrowed time, since it saved both people.  Running around with half the survivors invincible got old real fast, especially if they left the guy on the him until the last second so as to make sure you lose points
---
But what about the fact that a moried survivor is supposed to be on the ground? Is the demogorgon gonna spit them out?
---
I love dbd too much so nah, i wont stop playing
---
r/softwaregore
---
yes but not on pallets
---
Yeah the toxicity of this game rivals grand theft auto online
---
I don't think anyone above rank 18 says the last 2
---
Shirtless Myers
---
I like to be hooked far away from the survivors so that they can continue doing gens and not use up time Saving me. But if a person is close by then yeah of course I won‚Äôt use it
---
Imagine Left Behind being better than Wake Up at it‚Äôs only job by 27%
---
I AM A LEATHERFACE MAIN I LOVE HIM. all you need is any add on to reduce charge time and he's a beast. You can even hit survivors through windows with your chainsaw which they don't realize.
---
Legion/clown. Clown has very few already but legion has alot of potential. Also plague needs a good one. Oh! I almost forgot huntress
---
The only change I want is the screaming because he‚Äôs near you bullshit. It‚Äôs dumb.

NO ONE ESCAPES TOXIC PLAYERS
---
A devious pit of rage flows through you and           The Entity, forcing the community to get their shit straight.
---
Once the Exit Gates are powered, Survivors standing inside its radius for 5/6/7 seconds realize they fucked up.
---
While this Perk is active,
---
- Kill healthy or injured Survivors. 
---
- Your movement speed is increased by 4%
---
‚ÄúNone who disrespect The Entity leave alive...even when it‚Äôs right in their grasp.‚Äù
---
You'll embarrass them in front of their five viewers
---
Play Feng Min, great beginner surviver. Play Hillbilly, takes some getting used to but is a really strong beginning killer. The tutorial for both killer and survivor will provide you with the rest.
---
Y‚Äôknow, we‚Äôve been wondering why he was so fuckin fast but I never made that connection before now. Holy shit...
---
I feel that the Iron Maiden suggestion from a while ago could‚Äôve made a great plague cosmetic.
---
Agreed. There are many unfair perks and add ons in this game. To tunnel, using iri head, and immediately mori has nothing to do with the skill of the survivor, it‚Äôs the killer using powerful add ons. Probably the killer who needs to get good.
---
That's why I didn't put numbers
---
As a doc player take a upvote
---
I was jk lmao
---
Dont get overwhelmed with bad manners and all. There is alot of it but the game is really fun if you treat it as just that and play to have fun and not win
---
removed uncivil please relax guys
---
Classic matchmaking.
---
A friendly rank 1 killer doesn't exist.
---
This post has been brought to you by stuck in yellow rank gang
---
All of plauges current skins are terrible imo. I stick with the red and gold recolour
---
That‚Äôs what I use aswell
---
For PC I use OBS, it's free and easy to use
---
Yeah I had to take a break from the game for a while because of how toxic it became, its gotten a lot better now imo but I don‚Äôt know if survivors are more fair or I know what to expect and just have fun without caring if its a 0k or a 4k game
---
What does that even mean
---
It's the best one. Although i rarely play plague anymore.
---
Here take mine, fellow doc main
---
This has been on pc for aslong as I can remember
---
How the hell do you drop people?
---
Hell yeah you should
---
I was playing on PS4, you just press the circle button.
---
So the Bloodweb used to be MASSIVE. I mean you know our level 50s? Try that one a level 25 one AND the entity wouldn't wake up nearly as fast meaning the grind now is less than half as bad as it used to be. If you got prestige on a survivor or killer before Myers came out you got legacy. Predigest used to mean "O shit they dedicated to that survivor/killer" since it was so hard to get through new bloodwebs. Is not available anymore so if you see it pray they're rusty at the game
---
Ash is always the weapon, baby. Groovy.
---
True...
---
Okay, if I‚Äôm right. Circle is B right?
---
Why is M&amp;A bad for Doctor?
---
But can you say how it would specifically destroy the killer side?
---
A article said $11.99
---
That jumping animation at the start was spot on. Hope to see it in the game soon :)
---
Ok good, deliverance by itself is a good perk I'm just salty because some dweet did that to me yesterday
---
Yeah, B on the Xbox controller.
---
Fucking Hoffman.
---
True
---
Thank you for thatt, was forever wondering how to drop people for their friends.
---
yep
---
God I wish I could go back to school for a week and not care about anything.
---
I kinda figured that, also is that name a jojo reference
---
There's a large influx of new players, new killers tend to face camp because they don't understand the game too well, wraith and insidious encourage them and they think to themselves "wait, Survivors rescue each other, if I hide next to a hooked survivor, I'll get a free survivor! No one has thought of this tactic before, I'm a genius!"
---
I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them fall away
---
Just another day in dbd's matchmaking.
---
With how fucking terrible peoples pings have gotten id rather have killers suffer than have survivors suffer the bullshit presented already.
---
Yes you are a joke bubba
---
Tbh I kind of agree dedicated servers will feel weird as killer. I am assuming the devs will try and improve netcode to the point where playing on a dedicated server will feel very similar to killer-host provided you have a decent connection.
---
Laughed harder than I should have, but too real lol
---
Nah twitch streamer @Puppers is real life Dwight
---
For baby killers, I play like a baby Dwight as well. Legit run in straight lines and step into traps. I get BP, they get BP, win win!
---
Kill rush them faster than they can gen rush you
---
This kinda suspect
---
he's literally one of the worst killers in the game
---
Who plays on mobile bruh
---
Short answer: play killer on KYF while not host.
---
Long answer: it wuold make the bad hitboxes even more noticeable already, the killers weapon wuold lag all over the place, hits not being made when they shuold, laggy movement on killer, animations being laggy, hit animations looking more screwed than they already do and the killer wuold be missing game winning shots due to fucked hitboxes.
---
Aren‚Äôt the servers being hosted through 3rd party like most games out there right now?
---
Possibly but you really can‚Äôt guarantee anything will be fixed by dedicated servers
---
This happened to me a few days ago with all the pallets on the map
---
Green guy has to be the host lol
---
Wow, that‚Äôs pretty impressive for your first month. Keep going, you‚Äôll be rank 1 soon!
---
*snooze snooze
---
One of the hardest things to learn in the game is to learn to counter each killer, because there is a lot to remember. I would suggest playing different killers as well as survivor, because this will give you a greater understanding of your strengths and weaknesses.
---
Maybe don't go down in the first 15 seconds of the game idiot
---
*Me finished all my work so I start on the homework in class so I don't have to do it at home
---
I miss the early days of the game when there were three killers and Sprint Burst and Self Care were busted, hahaha.
---
God, hooks used to stay permanently broken.
---
Hahaha omg this is gold, I didn't expect the toolbooxes lul
---
For farming delicious, salty tears
---
It‚Äôs not perk-dependent, probably just a coincidence. I have had it happen with perk roulette where my perks are always different.
---
I don‚Äôt know how to use an instant heal, but if you press and hold on the item icon a prompt appears to let you drop it, perhaps a prompt for the instant heal might show up then as well.
---
Perhaps, but that's my decision to make.
---
Some put the image next to "at home" again and some don't. I did.
---
I heard enduring and spirit fury combo is really good on him. IDK if FoV would help like Monitor and Abuse but it might with easier stalk.
---
Your overreacting a little here. Epic games isn't that dumb. This is probably just a coincidence
---
They‚Äôre both unoriginal.
---
OH NO!!üòÇüòÇ
---
&gt; Flash saving, teabagging, all running decisive and bodyblocking e.c.t.
---
Only thing toxic here is the teabagging, and only if one cares about a silly animation. You can counter flashlights and DS, also bodyblocking shouldn't be an issue unless the hook is really far away.
---
I do agree that the MM has been awful for quite some time, makes me not want to play survivor when i keep on getting matched with R15+ survivors. And facing people far less skilled than i am as killer is just plain boring.
---
Just my 2 cents.
---
Thats swf right there, a low rank with high ranks.
---
That‚Äôs discouraging having awareness, and survivors need that.
---
That's not being tunneled tho, tunneling is soloing someone out on purpose
---
Footnote bad
---
You play ghost face by running NOED and Ruin or Corrupt Intervention.
---
fortnite bad gimme upvotes xD
---
I absolutely get you! People like this arrogant comment are what‚Äôs wrong with this game , combined with the fact that it is constantly  just filled with bugs. The issue at hand is that the game has a matchmaking problem. I just got an email from costumer support confirming this, because I am also frustrated being a rank 12 killer and being matched with rank 2-4s
---
, but people can‚Äôt help but be narcissistic (otherwise they would play differently against a lower rank killer), toxic and generally annoying in this community, like the rank 1 commentator who says you should ‚Äúuninstall your game‚Äù because you won‚Äôt embrace the fact that the game is bugged and he can enjoy himself by pissing others off.  Some even note on their PlayStation profiles that they‚Äôre toxic... it has come to this.. Toxicity is celebrated... You‚Äôre not the one being a whiny little bitch for being pissed off at the fact that you want to have a good time playing a game that is developed for a wide range of people, others just don‚Äôt care how they play as long as they get the win and the hilarious part of it is that the high rank players rage quit when they don‚Äôt have their way too. As long as the bugs benefit them, they can call you a whiny little bitch, but if it were the other way around they‚Äôd be uninstalling the game themselves. Most communities are just filled with little toxic brats and this just happens to be one of them. I for one will not be playing beyond the daily xp bonus until they fix this matchmaking problem. I‚Äôd rather play fucking Spider-Man than having to deal with so many dicks on Dead By Daylight! Hope you all have a fantastic Sunday!

Glad you‚Äôre still here
---
Eh, it should probably be a Hex perk Just in case
---
Haha ok I guess
---
So if for example I was rank 17 and my friends were all rank 2 and I was the host then I would match up against a killer with a similar rank to mine?
---
More suzy and clown
---
I don‚Äôt think anything could be that bad
---
I disagree making them aware of everything breaks the game a bit the killer is a hunter that needs to kill some choose to be more Distreet Such as pig and her stealth power 
---
Besides survivors would still hear the terror radius only stealth killers would be a problem and this balances the game out more since it slows the game down and gives the stealth killers a better shot at winning as most lack mobility options and take a while to reach their target.
---
Dead by Daynite
---
What? That's a stupid idea imo.
---
Wow, cars in the 80‚Äôs just combusted with slight collision... True HEX flex!

How about a nutcracker? It would make sense since the figures can be about the same size as his weapon?
---
Is it worth getting ruin from sof or should I just upgrade hag for devour hope
---
I think he swung at the end.
---
Need more Christmas skins. Santa daddy clown is not enough!
---
I had one against a 2, 4, and 3 red but don‚Äôt worry because their team mate was a level 12 like me so it was fair.
---
Ive called them out before, but it got deleted. Sent them a message, and never got a response. They need a rehaul and new mods imo.
---
Had a ttv streamer sandbag me from getting out of the killer shack basement by blocking the pallet doorway. Then when i was put back in, he snuck down to teabag me on hook. As killer, I couldn‚Äôt care what your name is since my job is to kill everyone anyway. As survivor, you‚Äôre on your fucking own, good luck to you.
---
What you gonna do? Waste your perk that already wastes a perk slot? No, bitch. You jump off that hook.
---
What in the actual fuck

Billy is probably the simplest killers in all of the game on paper. But in practice he‚Äôs a bit more complex

Just wish no one would be an asshole and you know.
---
They must go straight to hell
---
*You can‚Äôt fool me, I see that ‚Äòmade with mematic*
---
The only real problem with Monsterous Shrine is that the values in relation to the overall time is just too low. It takes 120 seconds to die on the hook and 9% is just a bit less than 12 seconds. In reality it‚Äôs not that much of a time crunch for survivors. 
---
Also 15% of the already low 4% to unhook yourself means this bonus is overall worthless. In order to actually make the number accurately punish the weak 4% already, it would need to be at least 50-75% difficulty and that would only remove 2% or 3%. 
---
The only somewhat meaningful effect is the bonus punishment for not hitting the 4% and that‚Äôs negligible and also depends if people attempt to actually yeet off with no bonuses. 
---
I like that you wanted to give love to MS but it needs a whole new effect in order to not just be meh at the end of the day.

I imagine there's a good discord for it.  I personally don't mind playing solo.  Low levels can be a bit frustrating, but 15 up doesn't feel too bad to me.
---
No
---
You made the right decision
---
Is this confirmed? When is it?
---
Wraith is in a decent place, imho. He could do with a slightly faster uncloacking time, as I feel pretty much forced to run an add on for that.
---
I do love how wraith is pretty much the only killer with brown add ons that aren't just really shitty versions of yellow/green add ons. They actually change up how you can play him, instead of just having worse numbers
---
Do you know how many levels will i get?
---
Im pretty sure she‚Äôs the quietest female survivor
---
You‚Äôll get to anywhere in the mid 30s depending on how efficiently you spend them
---
Ok thanks
---
1 million generally gets me from 1 to 34-40 depending on whether I take good perks, items, add ons etc. it‚Äôs approx 1.5m from 1-50
---
I got to about 35 with P2 Ash.
---
I usually get about 30-35 levels with 1 million.
---
It is confirmed but we don't have a date as of right now. Sometime near when the ptb comes out I believe.
---
I can‚Äôt even understand why anyone would dc from losing, you still get some bloodpoints to level up with so what‚Äôs the extra 20 seconds it takes to die really matter?
---
Keep in mind they‚Äôre reworking the bloodweb so nobody really knows. We‚Äôll find out after Tuesday. In the current state though, no it won‚Äôt.
---
You'd have man hands as well, if you ever did anything with your life.

---
One of my favourite "for fun" builds is to give him Whispers, Distressing (for more BP), Thrill of the Hunt (for more BP), and something like Bitter Murmur (or maybe NOED). I don't play the game with this build, I play a game where I see how many people I can mark (how many points I can get) before somebody breaks me out of Night Shroud for the first time

If you like a gal that has a fit bod, Meg's yer gal.

If you like a girl who looks like she can cook a mean fried chicken, then look to Kate.
---
I have a feeling that this is one of those things were people would still be laughing at a guy doing it.  
---
And someone posted how it was cringe. While they got downvoted into oblivion (which is poor behavior) they may have been downvoted because this subreddit would still laugh even if it was a guy.
---
Yeah I can't imagine someone trying to kill you would choose to charge up vomit while you run for the almost open gate, unless they panicked and hit the wrong button.
---
There are times where as killer we all lag and it looks like everyone is teleporting
---
When I first started I watched a lot of YouTube videos which was very helpful.
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt realize it was on other platforms too. It wasn‚Äôt an issue on PS4 before the mid chapter patch.
---
I like these perk ideas...  
---
Make sure Left Behind can't increase gen repair speed. Prove Thyself already exists and gens already get done far too quickly.  
---
That Vigil buff can help counter NOED. I like it.  
---
Monstrous Shrine seems a bit too OP with that new buff. I feel it might become meta, but in a bad way.  
---
Unrelenting should actually keep the old effect as well as the new ones you just listed. The new Unrelenting seems very situational and would be used almost solely on Nurse and Spirit, as decent Survivors can loop Killers for longer than 35 seconds. It would be used for farming as well, but this is good.
---
Damn im not going until  the 11th still too soon
---
The good troop üòÇüòÇ. That's perfect
---
Latency pings are visible are console 
---
They're the red/yellow/green bars next to the gamertags
---
Especially one with fucking memes clipped in. The two seconds I watched was obnoxious enough to do it for me.
---
Nurse‚Äôs, Ruin, Hex Haunted Ground, and Stridor.  
---
Gen grabs made easier with Stridor,Ruin is obvious, Haunted Ground to punish for looking for Ruin, and Nurse‚Äôs Calling to find survivors
---
Oh cool, thanks!
---
Oh heck, Fortnite x Dead by Daylight confirmed
---
Very excited about the Servers and Party System being tested first! But "more info for Servers in the coming weeks" makes me think that it might not get released instantly after the PTB. Also i hoped for the Bloodweb changes to be even better. It's an improvement of course but if you intend to Prestige your characters as i do, the level 50 change is very very endgame so it does not help much, but the 3 perks from level 40(i would prefer 4 from 40 and 3 from 30) is a great thing also. It will probably help me find Heal and WGLF until 50 for Survivor and BBQ + Ruin for killers :)
---
I‚Äôm not sure how much faster the Entity will progress through the bloodweb but there will be 2 perks available up to Level 40 the same as now. Then from Level 40-50 there will be 3 perks per bloodweb and you will be able to purchase 2. Then from Level 50 onwards there will be 4 perks per bloodweb and again you will be able to purchase 2. They‚Äôve basically cut the grind in half.
---
Ohh okay thanks
---
Next time you play the map look at it again. Like half of its ribcage is missing and it‚Äôs face has flesh missing
---
If theres 3 ppl still and only 1 gen left you were most likely about to lose anyway i dont see the problem, It also doesnt happens often
---
Keys are like a Survivors version of a mori, just not as good.
---
Absolutely not, Friday the 13th is unbalanced as fuck, DBD has it's issues but it's nowhere near as bad as that game, I only enjoy it if it's on a full lobby of friends
---
This made me laugh
---
First one... mm... seems a bit OP. And does it cause Exhaustion?  
---
If it causes Exhaustion, it's too easy to trigger and waste as a result.  
---
Second and third are interesting though. ESPECIALLY the third. I have never thought of a perk replenishing item usage if certain actions are completed.
---
Locker roulette. Kyf only.
---
- Killer waits outside of basement.
---
- Survivors must choose a locker in the basement and hide.
---
- Killer goes to basement and opens a locker, which then leads to survivor being hooked.
---
- Survivor gets saved, healed and everyone picks a new or same locker.
---
- Continue until last man standing.
---
- Winner gets chest in basement then leaves via hatch.
---
Can be turned into a drinking game or a simple time killer. Add perks and other rules if you like.
---
When the killer chases and all of a sudden youre frozen and next thing you know, youre over killers shoulder.
---
Rubber banding ever couple min.
---
Teammates freeze while trying to get you off a hook all of a sudden everyone is down.
---
ü§îü§î
---
big if true
---
I can see the postgame chat "gg es baby killer,lmao get reckt 360 noscope xdd
---
for doing absolutely nothing wrong?
---
I don't think moris should be as powerful as they are either, it's a two way street
---
To add insult to injury we went to haddonfield. At least I'm on Xbox, so no chat to deal with
---
I was three gen strating and all of them were on death hook.
---
Why does everyone hate flashlights? I‚Äòm a killer main and I love when people bring them.
---
Oh wow! They have hoodies on!
---
-whyd you go for bps in the ptb_
---
I wouldnt want to go against nurse. I'd prefer to vs the trapper
---
Have you seen the 2016 mori? This was broken
---
Im SuRe YoU ArE SoOoO SmOrt.
---
I can‚Äôt understand, I don‚Äôt speak baguette
---
I used to find him annoying. I think it‚Äôs because of his cocky demeanor more so than his play style. I mean cmon, that obnoxious laugh and smug smile is infuriating when your getting outplayed lol.
---
Ironically enough, I say similar things towards clown now.
---
So basically, assuming the bloodweb is the same size still, leveling will basically be the same until level 50. After level 50 it will be faster
---
Deja vu: Highlighted Generators get repaired 5000% faster
---
You poor poor soul
---
Psssshhh.  You‚Äôre supposed to bring the mori, start the kill animation, but never actually mori them, just torment them.
---
It‚Äôs not broken. It‚Äôs technically all correct... unless there are at least 2 people in the US called deadbydaylight subredditü§îü§îü§î
---
I don‚Äôt remember the last time i had a doc game lasted more than 7 minutes and that i didn‚Äôt escape. What rank are you that he‚Äôs annoying
---
What happens on PTB, stays on PTB.
---
hm.
---
i dont know den
---
No, its all just poorly placed.
---
Thank you!!
---
The double standards for baby megs and dwights is hilarious #stopthedwightarcy
---
Dude its fucking impossible to play as Survivor on ps4 with all the killers trying to be like Nurse, holy shit is killing me.
---
Well I‚Äôd rather have one that works going up the stairs than sprint burst where you can‚Äôt run unless you want to activate or waste it. Climb would be good for places like Strode or the Meat Plant. Also for charging up the stairs from the basement.
---
First of just about any competitively based game has loads of toxic players. I do think the game is appealing to the type of players that would have that mindset. Thing is I've been playing for a little under 2 weeks and the good have out weighed the toxic granted a lot is just nothing at all. The toxic ones just stick with you more. At the end of the day if you're having keep having fun let the toxicity bounce off you
---
Damn son
---
These bitches want some
---
Thanks brotha
---
I had kindred and instead of my 3 teammates going on the same gen they all went to separate generators, I died on first hook btw.
---
No, that's not technically correct. I could literally copy the characters from your sentence and put it in the site and it would say there's 1 person.
---
None of them because they'd all kill my fat ass
---
I love it! BHVR get on this and take my money, I don't even play Wraith but I need this
---
Brutal Strength, ruin, noed and alert.
---
Surely you should have noticed them not doing gens and assumed they are looking for the hatch
---
1 OR fewer. So yes, it is.
---
Not similar but it‚Äôll try to balance the rank.
---
Thing is I didn‚Äôt know that was a huge issue  until I played survivor.  I haven‚Äôt played killer since then because I know it‚Äôs unfair
---
I always use franklins so keys don‚Äôt bother me at all really
---
She ley you go tho lol
---
Maybe yuo aer right.
---
I never get a 4K with billy I usually get 4ks with Trapper
---
A fellow gamer...
---
Matchmaking‚Äôs been fucking with me recently too. I got matched with a rank 2 wraith while playing rank 12
---
A killer can be low tier and extremely annoying at the same time.
---
Old Freddy rings a bell.
---
ah yes
---
c h i p s
---
definitely 100% the joke
---
Doc might be the most balanced killer in the game. At least in my opinion. Sure he's tricky but they all are, I never feel like I couldn't have done something different to succeed against him when I fail
---
Fortnut is a copycat and has been since day 1.
---
Tbh the average for me on PC w/ Wifi is around 120.
---
But to be fair to my killers, I have pretty slow internet. Anything lower then 120 is a hella great day for me, but it's rare.
---
Still get a bunch of fuckers with that McDonalds Wifi though.
---
you probably havent seen alot
---
Going by moris and lore, I would least like to go against Leatherface. Sure, you might get a quick death but then again he could slowly chop you to bits and possibly tear your face off.
---
Yeah I haven‚Äôt used prayer beads yet I just started using spirit
---
Considering the gate had 3 lights on, any killer would know that it was close.
---
You don't think Ill jump?, watch me bi\*\*\*
---
I lol'd at this.
---
P a r t i a l 
---
W o o s h
---
It only happens when you gain madness level one so get near him when he's chasing someone else and it'll be a waste for him. It will also happen in madness three but at that point you just have to snap out of it and hope you don't scream while you're doing it
---
They aren't, you can hear the theme in the trailer
---
If this happens to you after they come out just know its your conecction and think of all the survivors you killed with it
---
Oof i have on average 300 to 400 ping thats an ooferoni
---
Well if they also brought back common perks, that would fix the price difference.
---
Every killer is running bbq/ruin now thanks to shrine :(
---
I mean when you have electro-convulsive gear strapped just about everywhere including your face, it‚Äôs hard not to not smile.
---
r/unexpectedjojo
---
These are the games I d/c from. If you're going to play like your connection unstable then so am I. You don't deserve those points for me opting out of a shitty game but it's still better than watching you get spoon fed a sacrifice.
---
If I steam roll a team then I‚Äôll give the hatch to tell if the events that happened. Recently I give the hatch and they will no I don‚Äôt get it don‚Äôt you want to live ? Or they msg me why and keep asking why didn‚Äôt I kill them. Is that weird ?
---
Don‚Äôt be this Claudette, y‚Äôall.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs not the same song :(
---
No, there is no voice chat. If you really want to you can invite all the survivors to a party.
---
That'd be cool honestly. If survivors know the consequences of using DS means giving the Killer a Mori, that'd be really interesting.
---
That feel when all 4 survivors use calm spirit.
---
Im really not trying to be rude when I say this, but standard right now is up to 200mbps with most services.
---
Wait, Using wifi is bad? *nervously sweats*
---
Console my friend
---
I would kinda argue otherwise as you can have addons and offerings to to make sure you keep it while moris get used once but if we are talking in gameplay only then yes moris are stronger.
---
How would you have good internet for streaming but not gaming?
---
No one cares you'd be dead to all of them
---
Uhhh no it‚Äôs not... my internet is capable of doing that however it never has. Yuo do know that 80mpbs downloads a gigabyte in a minute 40... not that slow
---
Yeah? Because a dead survivor is a huge detriment to the team
---
Your dole dippers
---
Because streams buffer and games don‚Äôt?
---
The highest average in the world is Singapore with 60mpbs...
---
It's more that there's only a 4% chance of you jumping off hook, and the fact it spawned directly behind him
---
Very helpful, here's your reddit gold
---
How did he grab a health survivor and mori him?wtf?
---
That would be great, lol
---
Yeah, I actually love that idea
---
I cant fuckin wait for this Jeff skin thats coming soon.
---
Nah man that‚Äôs clearly the winter soldier
---
Why would she go so underrated for so long
---
When you say streaming what do you mean
---
The bell could be an actual jingle bell and the weapon could be a reindeer spine and skull.
---
I thought it was feelsbad
---
Wait where was this picture taken
---
And we have come full circle
---
Damn you seem like a good ps4 player, i'm jealous, i just got butchered with 5 gens left by a cannibal and i'm sad.
---
Shows. Netflix. Not twitch streamer.
---
Very well could have. I have no idea if he did or not. Makes a good clip tho.
---
Why
---
Never gunna happen, really shitty to balance, unviable with a terror radius that big and no chase
---
I'm seeing it on EVERY killer as well. God it feels good to not see it in a game.
---
xbox but thank you :)
---
For multiplayer online gaming, generally it's not as good as a wired connection.
---
It's possible that you'll have no problems with WiFi, but if you do have a high amount of latency, a wired connection would be a simple way to reduce that.
---
1.	People who derank on purpose to bully newer players
---
2.	People who had a lot of matches and bloodpoints but still aren‚Äôt good
---
3.	New Laurie strode players
---
4.	Players who used to play a long time ago, stopped, and come back after many rank resets
---
Noed and save the best for last as defaults on killers
---
How do I do fake pallets?
---
Why not?
---
He chose his own electro-convulsive gear himself! Twist it any way you want, that guy is a douche. 
---
As far as I‚Äôm concerned, he can take his baton and smack it against his hand while he prances to the furthest corner of the map. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry, I just don‚Äôt like the guy. 
---
*Jokes*
---
Or ruin and thrill of the hunt
---
I main ghost face and I always run bbq &amp; chili, noed, deer stalker, and ruin. I usually down them and leave them there and go chase someone else or hook them see where they are at with bbq and then go after the next one rinse and repeat. Pls ruin and noed keeps them looking for the totems and off gens which gives you time to pick them off one by one.
---
It didn't just spawn it was there long before it just opened.
---
You better pray to god he doesn‚Äôt find you slap some of his own gear on your crotch and give you the shock of a lifetime.
---
Could do without the drums, tbh
---
I‚Äôm gonna feel bad for the new stranger things people joining up
---
Oh lord old freddy was a snoozefest
---
Ptb takes a screenshot of your game from a couple of days before it starts and it uses that for your ptb session.
---
Anything you use up or gain during the ptb will be lost once ptb is over, but since it's just a screenshot, your real game doesn't get affected. Nothing you do on ptb will affect your real game. Nothing you lost in ptb will be lost in the actual game, nothing you gained will be transfered either. It's completely separate.
---
That‚Äôs what I think every time I see some news on the chapter, lol
---
Yes, yes, please hire this man
---
Look how he massacred these bois
---
The Plague- that would be incredibly disgusting ü§¢
---
Oh no I just bought this pack today ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I think doc and I are a little past foreplay at this point. He better be a real good flirt if he plans on getting to second.
---
Being able to shock at loops requires great timing in order to prevent the pallet drop while also denying that survivor another loop. This change would just remove the skill aspect of shocking survivors.
---
What doctor could use is longer range by default and the charge reduction caused by it (while also nerfing his range add-ons).
---
i have a dog named scooter.
---
"Causes them to Disconnect instantly if they are having a bad day already.**"** 
---
All of these made me laugh and I hope it doesn't get lost in new. Have my up vote.
---
Current moris are pretty broken too.
---
Original Nurse had 3 blinks by default and was slightly faster. She lost the 3rd blink in the default kit and is slightly slower, but she's still a completely broken mess.
---
Perhaps he‚Äôll shove the stick up your rear end?
---
Certain add ones change your traps. The garden rake (brown) just gives you the pallets. The prototype claws (yellow) gives you pallets and lets you see the aura of the survivor who used the dream pallet for 4 seconds. Paint thinner (green) gives you pallets and shows auras for 6 seconds.
---
...so what? He can't stop them in any physical way even if he's aware of it happening. Once they find it, they just win.
---
Not exactly, the hatch only spawns at 3 gens done, and I‚Äôm gonna assume that there wasn‚Äôt 3 gens done so no he couldn‚Äôt of seen it
---
My thought on morph was something along the lines of being a survivor (who‚Äôs avatar is not in game) 
---
Expounding on it, what if you could ‚Äúwork‚Äù on something (while actually expanding the tome it takes to fix it by .25 seconds per 2 seconds, and if a survivor comes near you (30/25/20) meters it‚Äôs over
---
Well I see I'm not the only one playing with idiots. Lately the players I've been teamed with are clueless.
---
The way people refer to it is incorrect, it saying that doesn't actually mean that person with that name exists.
---
When I'm playing killer, toolboxes are scarier item. Flashlights though? The more the merrier. If they want to chase me around not doing gens so they can give me free hits and not even get the save then by all means. The exception would be maybe if I'm playing hag.
---
I thought "Pig Evan" was kind of clever, because it's the Trapper's name and Amanda has bear traps too. It made me chuckle. 
---
Then I realized was just someone that can't spell 'even'.
---
Dont worry I'm used to it \*Caugh Rust Caugh\*
---
Thank you
---
I mean there is a chance he could find them or at least kill 1 or two more before they find it. Always a chance frankly I see keys sorta slightly weaker than a eboni mori both should prob not be in this game honestly or nerfed.  But it‚Äôs only my opinion on it and I‚Äôm sure others have there own opinion
---
Michael Myers desperately needs stuff- he‚Äôs been so important to this game. If it wasn‚Äôt for the Halloween Chapter, it‚Äôs very likely this game will have died way back when; it was his appearance that caught a lot of people‚Äôs attention. I mean, this small, multiplayer horror game had just snagged Michael Myers. And, for this reason, Old Man Myers from Halloween 2018 needs to be in the game. Of course, it ain‚Äôt easy- licensing needs to be worked out. But I hope they sort something out (Halloween is only a couple of months away BHVR...)
---
If they do anything to the movement speed while charging shock, I'd rather them make it 90-100% instead of removing it.
---
Good luck with your gastrointestinal distress in a few hours.
---
Shut the fricc up
---
This shit some 2011 humour
---
The wraith, our eyes aren‚Äôt usually perceived to noticing shimmers, and we also can‚Äôt look behind using 3rd person
---
His movement speed is slower than fuck when you use the tombstone. If you get caught and killed by a tombstone Myers it's almost your own fault, unless he is using play with your food or noed.
---
Thanks, take mine :) This was done on a whim, so I can buff perks that are still "too weak". XD
---
I rather not go against the Hag. She'd jump scare me before devouring me alive... Sounds horrible.
---
The devs when you got Lampkan Lane a couple patches ago.
---
One of the most popular setups is BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's calling and Sloppy butcher.
---
Nurse's calling is creat on spirit since its range is within her terror radius. You can be barely in range and your phase doesn't have a sound since the healing survivor is within your terror radius. Sloppy butcher extends the time window you have to use Nurse's calling for free downs. Also Sloppy is really good on her since just like Nurse she's really easy to get hits on people with, so you really want to heal against her. 
---
Against most killers healing is optional, not a requirement so healing slows are less valuable. I don't need to heal vs trapper or doctor, I can just loop them. You can't loop a spirit, so you want to heal.
---
Ruin is valuable because she's a slow killer, she's 110% movement speed. It takes some time for you to traverse the map and look for people at the start of the game, with some luck Ruin will buy you some time so you can do it without losing too much map pressure.
---
I don't think I need to explain why bbq is valuable, it's good for points and for tracking survivors.
---
These are still pretty weak tbh. Instead of making killers disconnect, it should uninstall the game for them.
---
The thing is,  majority of the standard pallet loops aren't actually prevented by the shock,  there is a timing requirement that's difficult to get just to make them unable to drop it,  but even if you do that they're able to just run through it again. 
---
I think a small range increase would be nice,  definitely not anymore than his lowest range addon though
---
Not exactly, arcade fighters are extremely noticeable when there‚Äôs just 50ms of lag and are far more extensive than DBD.
---
If they use a good 3rd party you‚Äôll see that the compensation will even out
---
Not even trying to be funny. Possibly try and re-evaluate what humour consists of.
---
Tbh i wish I had yuor optimism... I just don‚Äôt believe they itd work uot
---
That happened to me the other day. I didn't have enough time to run to the very last box before I was ripped apart. It was a waste, but I wanted my struggle points.
---
Tombstone Piece myers, when you reach teir 3 you can mori one person
---
Yeah maybe still going 105% would be a bit much since there'd be basically nothing you could do to get away.  Just enough to make it so it doesn't just give another loop
---
I got red all once oWu
---
Me too, actually multiple times.
---
Perfect &gt;:D
---
It‚Äôs important to know, even with the pallet add on, you can only put dream pallets where normal pallets spawn. You‚Äôll see a bright red ghost-like pallet where you‚Äôll be able to put your pallets. So after you break a real pallet, I always put a dream pallet in its place.
---
I‚Äôm rank 17 ;-;
---
So? What do you play on?
---
Xbox lOl
---
I feel you. This morning I couldn't get a single sacrifice with Freddy and I just couldn't understand why I was doing to terribly ... only to realize I was going against four rank 2 players. I'm rank 9 or 8 at best.
---
Played a game on console where everyone died in a few minutes because the lag
---
None of the gens got done
---
In all honesty it‚Äôs not optimism it‚Äôs just from my personal experience with games that need dedicated servers.  If there‚Äôs any For Honor members in this sub they can vouch for how much better it‚Äôd be (since those of us that did play it in launch know exactly how great the experience was /s)
---
BUT this is on the assumption the devs use a good 3rd party
---
Aww, we could‚Äôve played if you were on PS4
---
Tbh ruin just feels like a default perk to go against as a survivor. I don't even care when a killer has it cause it's just expected. Just like an exhaustion perk for survivors.
---
I love this comment.
---
That third screen always gets me lol
---
And that assumption is where it falls apart. I duobt they will.
---
Both versions are really cool though
---
Or playing as trapper and forgetting where you set the traps.  There‚Äôs nothing more humiliating than stepping in your own trap while in a chase or carrying someone.
---
Why not the first hit?
---
I agree with the first part.  I hope they do, I don‚Äôt want another addition to have to bitch about
---
I saw a baby dwight once and gave him plenty of quarter. Then, he 360'd me and used dead hard after a minute long chase  
---
*HE DECEIVED ME*
---
I disagree. There is a lot that you can do if there is only 1 gen left and one person is dead. OP said in a different comment that everyone was on death hook and they had a 3 gen strat, depending on the killer played they could've swung the game around really easily.
---
With key there was nothing they could do. Once the team found the hatch, the game was over with no input possible from the killer.
---
The thing is, all of the killers would be a million times more smart and skillful if it were real, so no one think that a bad killer like Legion wouldn‚Äôt completely fuck you up in real life.
---
It's just a madness mechanic. I'm assuming you mean changed to something equally or more useful but just less annoying
---
i mean have you seen her when she gets slammed with a pallet
---
Exactly
---
Rip last year lmao
---
üòÜ
---
i'm killer rank 16 and i get hard SWFs. i'm thinking it's a matchmaking problem that they're working on fixing since it only started the past week or so
---
his name is Maurice? ive been calling him Jasper ;-;
---
I play on a LAN cable, my internet still sucks
---
~~Yo what the hell is an Ethernet or an Ethernet Cable?~~
---
I agree that key is a pretty ridiculous item with near non-existant counterplay. Sometimes it will just win the survivors the game and there isn't much you can do about it.
---
The problem is that there isn't much you can really do to nerf it without making it useless.
---
But how
---
There‚Äôs blue and they‚Äôre wearing hoodies. Man, I can‚Äôt believe Epicness Games stole this highly original DBD design for their video game FortNight.
---
Well WiFi would probably be even worse, if that makes you feel any better, assuming the cable is good.
---
i use the 25% range increase addon every time, i thnk it's a common rank one that looks like a lollipop
---
They called him that in a stream
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Add a filter called NO SWFs and rework some perks = profit
---
I love it when it's all fine until chase is happening. These motherfuckers think they are genius even though they are transparent ss fuck.
---
Yeah it's been especially wonky lately, I'm killer rank 3 and have been getting level 19s in my games. On the other hand, in purple ranks survivor I've been getting killers with literally 10 hours in the game. It's ridiculous.
---
How about Ashley fuck no.
---
I see the traps and still manage to accidentally step in it.
---
Yeah, i‚Äôd love it, but we already have a clown ‚Äúnutcracker‚Äù.
---
usually I get those
---
\&gt;96 of these
---
WHY
---
Ayy congrats. It's so satisfying to play spirit to perfection. She's 100% worth learning just for these types of games alone.
---
I don‚Äôt like that my position is given away because he decided to wander near me.  If he‚Äôs throwing the electricity and he hits me and/or if I get to tier 3 and scream that‚Äôs one thing. But that first scream is dumb.
---
It was so people trading with you in the future could see comments in your profile claiming you‚Äôre a reputable person to trade with. Now, this doesn‚Äôt work too well since you could get, like, four +reps and then twelve -reps, but then you could just delete the -reps and look like a great guy.
---
It's sadly a thing that comes with the anonymity given from the internet. 
---
People get the opportunity to be as much of a cunt as they want with essentially no consequence.
---
Add in the competitive nature of video games where it's easy to be mad at the opponent than accept that it's your mistake.  Then add in the nature of asymmetrical roles leading to everyone saying that their side is the one that has got it hard (seriously, find a survivor main that says that theyve got the easy role or a killer that says killer is easy).
---
So all the different elements in dbd in particular are just a breeding ground for toxicity
---
Did the survivors I kill makr this? They cry about this after EVERY game.
---
Fixated the real MVP
---
For moris you just make them work on death hook. No longer broken, still lets you deny flashlight saves, possible sabotage attempts and decisive strike.
---
For keys? I honestly have no idea, it is very easy to make them worthless with any nerfs. One thing I'd maybe do is bring back being able to grab the survivor if they are using the key in your face.
---
 Don't bring back default hatch grabs, if the hatch is already opened due to the survivor being the last man alive, do not let the killer grab them, otherwise the hatch situation would be entirely in the killer's favour.
---
If billy came out later in the games life, he for sure wouldve moved at 110%
---
No, but the killer was right next to us.

I mean the website is called how many of me, and you put the name down. Might assume you‚Äôre that 1 person
---
Don‚Äôt forget how they took the characters from  their now deceased game paragon and added skins in the game that look like em, but don‚Äôt share the same name :((((
---
The game NEEDS to fucking refund map offerings if two are used and you don't get your map. It happened with Moonlight Offerings, needs to happen with map offerings. Mainly grumpy because I just lost all 5 of my jigsaw pieces today because survivors wanted to send us to Haddonfield or Ormond and it feels like they ALWAYS get priority over the killer.
---
I LOVE THAT BAHAHA
---
I think the entity would be very pleased. The entity doesn't feed off kills. The entity feeds off of the hope of those trapped in it's realm. If a survivor faces certain death and is hopeless - being given something which ignites that dying hope would be a delicious feast for the entity
---
That is true, but he‚Äôs not overpowered. He‚Äôs just good. I think all killers should be good. The nerf to frenzy speed kinda felt overkill. They ripped the only fun thing about Legion away.
---
Yeah that's very true.  The screaming in the 3 can go ages without happening when it should be a set amount of time it occurs.  The illusion doctors spawn too infrequently and his fake pallets dont fool anybody. If you had to interact with them at least that'd be great. 
---
Though after all that he still would be bad in chases though he'd have enough information to adequately make up for his bad chase.  A terror radius improvement would be cool too
---
Can‚Äôt really forget, I never knew. I haven‚Äôt played Fortnite or Paragon, I‚Äôve just seen news and ads of some of the crossovers.
---
Poor baby didn't know better. But at the same time it's totally deserved for being a toxic asshole. Need to learn the hard way not to be a dick.
---
I always figured that's because he is a master of ending chases before they begin. If you play right you should get a free hit at the start of most chases
---
Because it's a multiplayer game where you pit players against each other and then allow them to communicate. 
---
Every game like that will inevitably be toxic because human beings are inherently horrible.
---
Maybe get off your fucking McDonalds WiFi then.
---
His shock needs work but I‚Äôd also like more difficulty in the skill checks. Like reverse the direction and make the noise for a check but it never happen. Also make an addon that makes his copies move, even if it‚Äôs just an attack animation.
---
Bbq - survivors auras displayed for 12s,200% bp
---
I mean it's not a bad suggestion, besides you should be shaking in fear when you hear 11 or 13
---
A default 115% movement speed killer build of BBQ, Enduring, Ruin and Spirit fury is a great cookie cutter build that works in most situations.
---
If you want something more fun/creative, try BBQ, enduring, brutal strength and Pop goes the weasel/whispers/Nurse's calling.
---
Nurse's calling and whispers are good on him since he has no terror radius and has an easier time sneaking up on people. Nurse's calling on a character that has no terror radius can be really deadly. 
---
Pop goes the weasel is a more interactive and imo more fun to use alternative to Ruin, and it has some synergy with Brutal strength.
---
any suggestions
---
That's what I always tell them
---
play PTB and get nothing but facecamping Leather Daddy... I really don't understand some people lol
---
Here are some things to avoid while you're still learning killer. If you see this in your lobby, consider exiting the lobby and starting a new one;
---
* Survivors with similar names. These can be funny troll teams, but more often than not they're the most toxic SWFs you'll find.
---
* Survivors with the exact same skin. Again, these can be gags, but more often they're a coordinated effort to confuse you. Especially Claudettes in really bloody clothes.
---
* Nea with pink hair and a face-mask. It's the designated 'toxic' skin(but I appreciate their honesty).
---
I unironically want a vehicle-using killer. Too bad it's be a pain to balance, not to mention stuff like how you'd "Drive around" on Lery's or The Game.
---
If your done trash talking, get your ass off dbd and go to school to learn to spell ‚Äúmake‚Äù
---
That gag reflex would make him useless in certain industries.
---
Good, because I just got done speaking to a PhD candidate and, as I said, you dont understand how averages work. It CANNOT GO BELOW 60%. It takes a special kind of cocky brainlet to come in trying to educate someone educated in basic stats how combining averages works, then get insulted when they try and push their agenda to keep the game badly designed out of some sick emotional need to abuse other players or something unhinged. Its insane that we have bad game design apologists, why even apply yourself to such an extent to purposely make the game worse? One can only imagine.
---
This is great
---
Ruin, PGTW, Sloppy, Discordance/BBQ.
---
Oh my... ;)
---
I was gonna put in a survivor thing but I forgot, chill out. Don't get your mother's knickers in a twist
---
Nah. Unless? It would be stupid. But?
---
I mean you don‚Äôt have a killer who fires missiles at you every time you go out of your apartment
---
Do you?
---
What if we both touched hands while fixing a generator?
---
My thoughts exactly :)
---
Make this the tutorial please
---
Jesus johansen didn't die for nothing
---
Butt dancing in progress, I repeat: butt dancing in progress
---
I'd tell you that I do and shoot your bullshit down right there
---
No.
---
Ugly people need representation too in game.
---
We will honor his sacrifice by butt dancing at the exit gates against Myers only to get tombston‚Äôd
---
Answer Yes/No
---
I wish I could get stuff like this but I've been scared into a hole completely detached from the survivors I play against because I'm a pussy who can't handle ridicule
---
Bruh I'm not the one throwing out insults. Ty for the trash talk and downvote. Typical Ash Main üòèüòâ
---
The fresh meat is going to recibe the same treat I recibe when I start
---
Tunnels, tier 3 and tomestone. My 3 favourite T's
---
Thats a yikes from me
---
Pig timer only activates if the time runs out or you get to the exit with the timer activated.
---
If you're just gonna rely on noed to get you a couple kills at the end you won't actually "git gud" though
---
Most Dwight players act like Cunts so don't feel bad.
---
When stalking someone, move in and out of obstacles. Well, thats what GF's do when I play against one...
---
I believe it was removed due to it being shorter of a recovery time. Which could have been easily fixed by extending the shatter time or extending the time spirit takes to recover.
---
It‚Äôs the way it is many because teams that can communicate are placed in lobbies with players who aren‚Äôt, can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to. The current ranking system is just garbage, for lack of a better word and the rank reset is utterly pointless. 
---
But let‚Äôs focus on an archive that adds nothing to the gameplay whatsoever and does not address the lack of true balance needed for this game to thrive. 
---
We need solo/duos/quads lobbies. Better matchmaking and a ranking system that doesn‚Äôt utterly destroy new players. 
---
What would also make the game better are modes that cater to skill. Something like an adept mode where you can only bring in your characters perks. Or easier modes to help the baby killers get better. 
---
Anything but what they are doing now would be a great improvement.
---
I wiiiish I could hear the it follows - title song in this game. It fits playful horror so well
---
Fair enough, but I also love punishing those lil shits that teabag at the gate. And it's not like noed is on the whole game. I get plenty of practice before the gates open, so I will git gud
---
From what I heard, when dedicated servers drop, BHVR said the ranking system will improve along with it.
---
Shattered Bloodlines, especially now that Ruin is on the blood web(get it now). 
---
Spirit is probably the second strongest killer in this game. Spirit Fury also isn't bad if you plan on just bruteforcing people down.
---
"You shouldnt end up with new players if your rank   is high enough" that is a lie
---
Almost like you need ruin to avoid getting genrushed, as they call it.
---
That‚Äôs cool! Keep it up!
---
old ds
---
Fuck em if they want to be toxic. There are some really nice people in dead by daylight
---
Duuuuude why did you leak the new ghostface skin?!?! D:&lt;
---
Im rank 8 and im guessing since ruin is out on the shrine everyone is abusing it and its really annoying every game i get into turns into a scavenger hunt and no one does gens its the most annoying thing ever
---
In my room not the closest playing on a gaming monitor on a fordable table
---
That's the fucker who just camped me and tunneled me when I got unhooked out of the basement
---
People downvoted that? For what reason?
---
I don't have a source, too many game updates to scroll through, but it's been confirmed as not a bug
---
I did it the first time after reading that it was possible in patch notes where the devs confirmed it wasn't a glitch and was intended.
---
Yeah either a direct refund or just extra BP would work.
---
YES YES YESSSS ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Yeah same thing happens to me when I play survivor. Of course when I invest points in killer, I can‚Äôt get ruin to show up at all.
---
That's my point, and assumptions aren't really information
---
So wholesome!
---
... And Claudette ruined it by being cancerous.
---
Honestly I think it‚Äôs worse in this game.
---
Its a teachable hag perk but right noe is 2,000 shards
---
How
---
just like this game that you always played in school
---
I didn't downvote you lol. Ty for the assumption. Typical Feng main üòèüòâ
---
Fucking why would you just post a picture of ruin instead of talking about it
---
earth
---
Fleth
---
Wraith always gets cool skins. I also have a ton of fun on him the rare times I do play him.
---
Not in the title or description
---
Yep same with me but personally it doesn't effect me as my team does generators or I do gens and they get chased and stuff. Honestly think this is just making everyone get good at ruin skillchecks instead of actually being useful at slowing the game down, still annoying sometimes when you get teammates that don't just do gens.
---
Both of you are going straight to hell, but so am I. So have some upvotes
---
I know I only see it because it's is recommended on ohmwreckers YouTube channel
---
Sorry bud not really used to this whole posting this as i just look at post my bad
---
You can do it in a way that still makes them feel challenged if they are decent.  Get a read of how good they possibly know how to loop.  From there, adjust how tightly you run those loops as killer.  Try and mindgame them on the loops with clear visibility, stuff like that where they can waste time if you let them without it feeling like you are purposely just letting them go.  And perhaps fake a bit of blindness every now and then.  Maybe just look at em, shake your head no, hit em and move on to say "No, that isn't a good hiding spot."
---
im having hard SWFs these days but id only use Ruin for killers like Trapper who can actually protect that G.D. thing
---
I just finished my second week, but I‚Äôm probably gonna get the whole third week off cause of the hurricane üôÉ
---
You have a point. It's honestly how annoying the balance is. I always die as Survivor against a decent killer, but I know Survivors generally are stronger. I wish they could nerf the good players and buff the bad ones
---
It's just like I don't understand is this is supposed to be a rant or a joke and it just feel overwhelmingly low quality but don't worry about it because in about a day both of these comments I made well be at -12
---
You can't make it all avaliable, but for heartbeat and skillchecks it wouldn't be hard.
---
Make a visual indicator that you are in the terror radius. Some people use one of tapp's perks or Pebble to find out if they are in the terror radius, just give any sort of non-distracting visual indicator. It could be an icon/status effect showing up on your screen.
---
For skillchecks just make a toggle in the game options between the early sound indicator and an early visual indicator. You won't have both since the sound indicator is useless to the deaf person. Huntress' lullaby would just make the indicator appear later/not appear at all.
---
&gt; Really tilted rn
---
Take a break. People get way too emotionally invested in games :P 
---
&gt; who loops me for a minute or two
---
Learn how to mindgame and run loops correctly and learn which loops can be mindgamed to begin with. Also, know when to give up chase and find a new target. 
---
&gt; will click his flashlight and point
---
The sooner you stop caring about BM, the more fun you'll have with the game :)
---
Plus side is that it is really helping me memorize totem spawn locations.
---
Avoid Bubba cause he bigand has a saw. Face the Pig cause I think I could take her
---
This. 
---
HybridPanda's channel explains all the perks on the shrine of secrets once a week and he is good clean fun.  (Actually, investing your shards into unlockable perks from the shrine of secrets is also very good advice especially if you're new and you haven't unlocked all the characters)
---
Otzdarva is also amazing at explaining perks and potential combinations and I just live hearing him talk.
---
I agree we need an incentive to play vs SWF. Just a BP bonus so there's less reason to dodge a 4-man.
---
Outplayed. Killer just had a better gaming chair.
---
For real, hopefully dedicated servers fix this.
---
Good thing you can also play killer and use BBQ to earn BP
---
I laughed out loud at your title
---
Killers need it though, everyone knows how quick gens pop without ruin
---
Some killers on console have a downloading game on pause and then when they load in the game, they conginue the download to make everyone lag
---
Yea no he is annoying. Tell me how a killer that does nothing but giggle at me while he kills nothing other then my FPS is not annoying
---
Killers even when they have bbq, still camp.
---
Yellow medkit + Styptic and Syringe.

Candy cane with a demonic nutcracker head

Dude, my entire life can be summarized with a loop of Homer Simpson falling out of an ambulance, down a cliff and then rinse and repeat. My decisions tend to be shit.
---
People treat the site like it's providing statistical information about people's names, but it's just overextrapolating basic census data.
---
What ever happened to that game?
---
&gt;Killers even when they have bbq, still camp.
---
Campers will camp no matter what. You need to look at the whole picture. 
---
When facing a player that is playing "properly", he will immediately go after whatever auras he can see with BBQ, creating a completely safe opportunity for an unhook to be made and maybe even heal. This is how I play killer even when I know someone could be around because I didn't see their aura and I know a lot other killers play the same way.

True but survivors are at a huge disadvantage because sometimes the totem is never found and everyone or mostly everyone is out just wandering around while one person is doing gens me as a survivor main personally hate it for the fact that you can never tell what type of teammates your ganna get
---
Hmmmm abused as a child, I was.  Severe trust issues, I must put to use for big spider god
---
prolly myers. me would snap me like a twig. hag cuz she just fucking skin and bone so i coud snap her like my fingers
---
Balanced killer in the game? Dud he is tier c maybe you are rank 18 but the doc need a buff like right now
---
Being a discord exclusive happened.
---
Ash needs a Bubba Hotep skin
---
So Jane is the slowest survivor? ü§î
---
Lol BBQ is hardly unfair it's one of the easiest perks in the game to counter.  If you're too lazy to climb into a locker you deserve to get found with it.
---
How are tokens earned? Skill checks? Time?
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main but even I agree camping when gates are open is a strategy. Sometimes you can get more than one person if you do that.  Face camping during game though is frowned upon by me.   No need for use the of ‚Äúmoron‚Äù because bagging a killer is usually a sign of disrespect. I don‚Äôt do it nor does it phase me but I can see why people would. Tbagging has been around muuuuccccchhh longer than dbd so no, it‚Äôs not a use to say ‚Äúhello‚Äù lol
---
U less Ure lactose intolerance
---
except that....ye, sometimes
---
I swear Michael tossed him aside with a little flourish
---
üòÇ
---
This is the Huntress I aspire to be.
---
They're trying to taunt the killer into pushing them out, something that gives them more points than if they were to leave by themselves
---
Its a really small difference though, not worth the time wasted
---
Wish daddy Myers would choke me to death
---
I get the "DS is anti-tunnel" but the timer on the thing is ridiculous. 60 seconds is (depending on the killer and rank) enough for me to down the other dude, then find you and down you
---
Great skill checks aren't even that hard to land though
---
Yes and no. I believe they get more points the later they stay in the game when they can escape, but the teabagging is just them being toxic jerks. :/
---
For survivor: Try to move your camera so your looking behind you frequently in chases. Keeping tabs on killer is key in chases. Try not to run around wasting ever pallet in an area, you‚Äôll regret it in the late game- instead try to loop an area with a pallet until you can‚Äôt any more get the stun and the leg it to another area. Always hug the wall when looping. Your hit box is smaller than the killers so while they‚Äôre faster, you‚Äôre more agile- use this to your advantage. Remember that the killer is just trying to enjoy the game too so don‚Äôt get all cocky and teabag because it can spoil their game for them (and it might get ya face camped).
---
For Killer: First thing you wanna is patrol generators to find your first survivor- this first chase is very important because as killer the biggest thing you‚Äôve got going against you is time. You need to get kills fast. Ideally you want someone hook before the first gen is popped (though this can vary with certain add ins and killers, for example rift of hair Myers). The survivors are real people and they think like normal people, this they can be mind gamed into a bad position- this can work well on medium safety pallets. Break safe pallets immediately, leave unsafe pallets, test out the survivors play style on medium safety. Each survivor plays differently, you‚Äôre best observing what they‚Äôre looking out for (example: some survivors will be on the look out for moonwalking and won‚Äôt fall for it, this can be countered by fake moonwalking). Please, please, please don‚Äôt stick in close proximity to a survivor after you hook them I know it‚Äôs stressful and you wanna preserve that kill but it‚Äôll only hurt you both in the long run. And if you can try not to go after the guy that just got unhooked, it really sucks when that happens. Again remember survivors are just people who wanna play he game like you so respect their fun and you have fun too! 
---
You probably will get salty messages off of people but you‚Äôll cope, just don‚Äôt take it personally- somehow this game has a way of sparking a rage within us all.
---
Same thing happened to me swf needs some balance changes
---
The People Who I meet in Solo Q disagree
---
So they dont get points for tbagging, they get points for the killer hitting them?
---
You can‚Äôt see your own though
---
Shirtless Myers? Nah.
---
Clothed Demogorgon? Hell yeah!
---
The Entity feeds on hope. The Entity ensures the Survivors have hope to escape up until the point they are sacrificed, at which point, in the face of their certain demise at Its hands, the Entity drains their hope.
---
The Entity provides hope to the initial four Survivors through the possibility of completing the Generators and escaping through the Exit Door. As the number of Survivors dwindles, their ability to progress the Generators does as well, and thus their hope wanes. To balance this, the Entity slowly introduces an alternate form of escape: the Hatch. At first, the Hatch appears closed. This gives the remaining Survivors the additional escape of finding a key. When there is only one Survivor left, they require an even easier objective in order to hold off despair. At this point, the Entity opens the Hatch.
---
The Entity requires the Survivors to have hope in order to feed on them. The Survivors only have hope when they have a chance to escape. Therefore, the Entity *must* give the Survivors a reasonable chance to escape in order to feed on their sacrifice. It is important to remember, however, that if a Survivor actually succeeds in escaping, the Entity can not feed on their hope either. The Entity does not *want* to give the Survivors a chance, It *has* to. The ideal Trial for the Entity is one in which all Survivors feel they have a chance but they all ultimately fail and are sacrificed.
---
With that in mind, it becomes obvious that the Entity would be horrendously displeased to see their servants acting against them by essentially just throwing out Its food. Actually, lore-wise, the Entity would be more into killers *pretending* to give the Hatch only to hook the Survivor instead. There actually used to be a loading screen tip before the EGC about the Entity being especially amused by interrupted Hatch escapes.
---
Incidentally, this also means the Entity would dislike despair-inducing behavior from killers as well, such as camping and tunneling. Fun fact.
---
Tl;dr: The Entity would dislikes *all* escapes, and a killer allowing one deliberately would be acting against It
---
You're saying ALL survivor mains are like this? No, don't do that. In my experience seeing a toxic killer is more common than seeing a toxic survivor, and you want to ban people for using certain perks or add-ons? Do you have any idea how stupid that sounds? and "gen rushing" isn't a thing, and it's not toxic, it's literally the main objective of survivor, telling survivors to do gens is like telling killers not hook survivors, It's dumb. This entire post you made is stupid and idiotic.
---
He called me babe and then a cunt for calling him out
---
Jesus who shit in your cereal today
---
no, I mean, the original Dwight model isn't even in the game now.
---
This is what I saw some folks saying; there's no way this Dwight isn't based off Cote, except Cote is a bit chunkier now. Happens when you sit around making games all day, ya know?
---
Careful, ppl will call u "entitled" using the word "properly" like that. Cause apparently camping/tunneling/slugging is "properly" playing the game and has nothing wrong with it.
---
Bubba
---
Well, being annoying makes playing killer viable
---
Completely agree! I very rarely wear full outfits, I'd love to see how they look when I mix them before I buy them.
---
I dont like running Spirit Fury as its lowkey an unfair perk. At unsafe pallets where stuns are necessary to keep chase, it guarantees a free hit. I dont know if im too kind as killer, but I dont see it being a healthy perk.
---
Everyone sucks at first but getting better despite the toxicity will help you tune it out and manage it later on
---
He self heals and is immune from damage for the rest of the match
---
I think it definitely works better, the alluring to rather than being flat out.
---
Honestly, the remake just needed to go full in on the angle of him being actually innocent, and their 'revenge' is what set him down this dark path. That would have at least given him SOMETHING.
---
Its an add on for myers, makes you super slow and stalkibg a lot longer
---
Apply directly to the forehead.
---
Dude, maybe you should take the hint of these comments and delete this. She let you go. It‚Äôs embarrassing.
---
Ketamine abuse, I shall. Run over school children, I will.
---
Me: "Wow, this is oddly true."  
---
Me at the end: "LMAO, oh so true!"  
---
Good job!
---
She even shaved her legs for him.
---
Holy fuck, you dug really deep for a simple comment about milk. Have you ever considered being a PI?
---
You thought about using Ruin and think SF is unfair? I am confused.
---
Recycling meme. 2nd time today.
---
Wtf is that possible? I play on console
---
How is ruin unfair? It doesn't guarantee a free hit, and in some stupid cases pretty much an instadown if the survivor drops a pallet on your head after you hit them.
---
The Entity requires the hopeful to be sacrificed in order to actually feed. If they escape, the Entity gains nothing. Short of letting them out of the Trial, however, the Entity does want hope to be fostered as much as possible prior to the sacrifice.
---
Yeah lmao
---
Most killers need all the help they can get. I‚Äôve been playing for 8 hours and every killer has run BBQ and at least one Hex. Some have run nurses calling in combo with all of that. 
---
I‚Äôm purple on PC playing against green and red ranks doing this. On Xbox I‚Äôm red and it‚Äôs even worse. 
---
The game needs killers for this to work and despite the lower skill level we have to deal with it until they fix the matchmaking and deal w/ SWF or someone else develops something better. 
---
This is a niche game that‚Äôs trying to cater to the lowest common denominator now. It‚Äôs no different then any other game that‚Äôs 3 years old looking for new players
---
Happened to me except Sony took it seriously and got me a week ban from psn.
---
I still can't get this perk to work.   
---
I'm in the locker &gt;&gt; The perk activates&gt;&gt; but then the killer it near it prioritizes them opening the locker so I can't jump out. :/
---
"look it's wholesome chat with the killer he is actually a nice person guys look!!!!" Noone gives a shit, you found a person that doesn't insult you right away wow incredible. Get that forced wholesomeness out of my face.
---
I used to think he was OP. But once you start playing as him and learning his add-ons it's actually not bad at all. He's just annoying really.
---
MAY YOUR KILLERS FOREVER HAVE IRON MAIDEN
---
I had a similar idea, everyone dewight, head on, quick and quiet, firecrackers. Same rules as yours
---
And now your butt dancing very mature I‚Äôm leaving
---
Filth is what i am looking at
---
As a Survivor mostly on PS4, even in Rank 10 most survivors are brain dead dumbassess
---
I was gonna agree with you at first. 
---
I mean you‚Äôre right. But it‚Äôs not for playing the actual game.
---
1. brought to the gate
---
2. picked you up so you could wiggle
---
3. stood still while you wiggled
---
4. didn't carry you away from gate or try to hook you
---
5. didn't down you while you were opening gate
---
6. screwed around
---
You were so let go, I hope you didn't trash talk in after game chat because that would be embarrassing...
---
That's not how you spell cough, not a native English speaker?
---
I've never seen this before. 1st post of its kind.
---
Base PS4 and Xbox One are pretty shit. Even the Pro has issues. It‚Äôs bad enough that I don‚Äôt play there anymore. Xbox One X is the closet to PC but still only 30fps. 
---
PC is the best place to play ... load times are seconds.
---
Discord exclusive? Who the fuck thought that was a good idea?
---
Oh yeah its all coming together
---
The pointless teabagging might be considered toxic, but the BP farming is fine. Teabagging to get the killer to chase you can be considered a legal play, but that's not what was going on here.
---
Don't forget infinities, mate.
---
Either you are Trapper or you lose.
---
Or pick OP Wraith.
---
[I doodled a killer!Claudette actually yesterday based off a post!](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cx8d5b/legionkiller_claudette/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
The issue would be more on whose internet is actually more shitty, i find the idea of killers not gaining benefit from having very random and shit internet. It might make machmaking even longer, but atleast the killer can finally blame their connections for once, Lol
---
Get better ked
---
I like lithe but the the fact that you dont have a choice if it activates or not (during a chase) means that you wont really use it for looping that much
---
It isn‚Äôt a that bad an idea actually. If timed properly, you can break a spirit out of phasing and cause them to lose a full charge of their power. In a pinch this can help you gain ground you need but not much as it doesn‚Äôt fully reset the power bar. 
---
Also, if you‚Äôre not sure if they are phasing or faking, you can ‚Äúblind‚Äù the husk to tell the difference. If they are phasing the husk lights up a certain way. It‚Äôs just risky, and this person didn‚Äôt even wait to see if they did it right.

&gt;When I started playing killer I got myself into a mindset of "what would I do if I was the survivor?" And start playing against that.
---
I ask myself the same thing when im being chased "what would monto/noob3 do now", and i die for the next 3 seconds
---
Welcome. &lt;3
---
Oh, hell yeah!
---
I don't like to play favorites, but this is my favorite comment I've gotten. Thank you so fucking much.
---
Underrated comment tbh. Two thumbs up from me.
---
Somebody got a 3K by camping and tunneling? Sounds like the survivors weren't punishing the camper by focusing on gens. Altruism is nice, but sometimes you just need to cut losses
---
I think he could use a tweaking; his skillchecks are fricking annoying, and in my opinion should be an add-on effect, rather than part of his base kit.
---
So what I'd do is take the moldy plug or whatever that piece is, and make that part of his base kit, and replace the Skillcheck as the add-on instead.
---
That way, his zap area gets a bit bigger, and that really annoying part of his kit has to be something you're using 'instead of' something else.
---
Sure, just as much has having knife skins makes you run faster in CS:GO
---
I understand that, matchmaking is sometimes bad that you'll be able to play against people from other countries and your ping will be shit when playing against said killer. However, those are easy to notice 'cause the ping will usually never get better and that's an easy dodge. Survivors have a choice over that. 
---
I'm referring to games that were supposedly a steady, green ping and then when you're in a game, you get fucked over by drastic amounts of lag.
---
Good idea, or just add full heals as a way to get stacks in WGLF and give the unhooker/ healer a aura reading on all other survivors for 4 seconds. Not that OP but it mirrors the killers perk while being slightly weaker (necessary for surv perks to not be EQUAL since you can run four of the same) and it could slightly help to bridge the gap between solo and SWF having a mini bond each unhook.
---
You might be getting downvoted to hell, but you're not the only one who's sick of it
---
Ok that‚Äôs too far for me :(
---
I'm rank 6 I mean maybe he could use a bit of a buff but I never feel like anything against h is bullshit. I almost only play survivor though so I don't really know what's like to play as him
---
 I sorry
---
I've only ever heard how abysmal his range is as well, so I'd probably say the last 3 can fit into your statement.
---
Killer: Brutal Strength. Walk through pallets.
---
Survivor: Adrenaline. Heal a health state and get a smaller speed boost every gen-pop.
---
Lmao yeah I didn‚Äôt even notice that
---
I guess, what would the top 3 killers be? I know nurse is considered top but I have been out of the loop for a bit.
---
People are just assholes they probably have something going on in there life so try not to hold onto it
---
Whilst BBQ is easy to counter, just the fact that their is a possibility the killer has it makes survivors waste time. I always assume BBQ unless I figured out the 4 perks mid match.
---
If the survivors began expecting it, the entity would die. But survivors hope for it makes future kills even tastier.
---
Yeah matchmaking has been terrible this weekend. I literaly had 4 games in a row where there were survivors 8 or more levels above me. The SWFs are out in force this weekend
---
Monto be like
---
He has some high skill tier chase stuff with his shocks blocking vaults and pallet drops but its very hard to pull off correctly and rare to see anyone take advantage of it. Doc is a perfectly midteir killer and thats totally fine
---
Also, I stole the pic from GameByte on Facebook if anyone cares.
---
I just took screenshots of all my survivors/killers being at level zero. Once you give them your profile, im sure they have tools they can use on their end to pull more info.
---
General consensus is Nurse, Spirit, and Hillbilly as  top 3.
---
A more interesting debate would be what the top 5 is because New Freddy, Hunters, and Hag are all so close.
---
Nurses disguised as survivors.
---
Well I have 800h on hillbilly but ok this vid is pretty much 360 bad killer also the fps and the aim can be a bit broken on ps4 and Xbox
---
SAW 
---
Baseline killer, good for learning killer. Sexy af survivor with neato abilities that are highly situational but will allow you to nourish your skills without crutch perks (and are fun to pull off).
---
God I love this couple, amazing job!
---
I have about 2800 hours in both killer and survivor. Hillbilly is for babies who don‚Äôt know how to properly kill without an instadown. You really come on my post and threaten me with a baby hillbilly???ü§≠
---
Shit dude yeah my bad
---
Lmao
---
Perfect for 2k
---
Just might give it a shot some time, then.
---
In a perfect scenario it is supposed to match you with someone who has ~ the average rank between the survivors. The longer you are queued though, the larger the game sets the acceptable range for that to be so if the killer waits long enough, the "acceptable average rank of survivors" could end up becoming 1-20. The main cause of these kind of issues is simply that DBD was never meant to be a competitive or pro game so a lot of standard matchmaking amenities were not added to the game such as a skill based ranking system or dedicated servers. The devs originally wanted the focus to be on quick matchmaking times so they made a loose rank system that means very little and set up the system where the longer the killer waits, the more acceptable the gap is. The devs have made attempts to bring it closer to what the rest of the industry has, but the system and engine are too far behind to make this easy. I do honestly wonder if it would just be easier for them to remake the game entirely at this point instead of trying to duct tape new additions onto the current one, but who knows.
---
Add black bars on each side
---
So every billy main is a noob according to you well ok well it been fun talking but I have bad survivors to kill and you have bad killers to juke bye
---
Pair it with sprint burst and you're gonna go fucking NYOOM!
---
Oh wait I didn't understand it guess l am a survivor main ;(
---
thanks!
---
The alligator mouth eats the bigger amount.
---
Yeah happens sometimes but I feel like a lot less nowadays compared to some time ago.
---
It‚Äôs about a dozen posts every day even though it‚Äôs against the subreddit rules
---
he just means that bubbas bad i think
---
Elephant lives under the roof
---
Parrot lives on top of it
---
when you fail a skill check on a gen the small explosion just kills you instantly
---
Thank god for decisive man, that guy was trying to get in your way the whole time lol
---
That's not how you do a chain
---
Yup, people are stupid
---
Michael: ***Stabs Dwight in the chest***
---
Dwight: Oh-hoHO!
---
Just started 4 days ago playing the game and he's who I decided to play as. Got a group of five friends who are also new that I can play with, but yeah playing Billy is like
---
Holding down right click... Oh god oh god oh god fucking chainsaw unwieldy fuck my life just hit the fucker okay this tree is good.
---
Teabagging makes Kate's butt bigger, let her do her workout
---
Goodness. That would be a great item to find! You can set up a string trap to trip the killer!
---
Yea dead hard I‚Äôm not having a problem with, I just threw it in there cause some guy used it while he was running to the gate and it pissed me off. I might start using mad grit and see rather I like it or not. But I rlly do need to start taking those games as signs to take a break lol. I‚Äôm a bubba main and I‚Äôm always getting 4ks but it‚Äôs those GODAMN toxic swf that get the best of me. I def need to consider taking a small break after games like those, thx anyways for the help man:)
---
That's a rickroll, trust me. (This)[https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ] is the real one
---
In terms of death, I think Doctor would probably be one of the least unpleasant killers to die to. I don't like being shocked as much as the next guy, but it's probably better just to get you brain fried than having your guts ripped open or being stabbed multiple times or hit in the head or thrown up on.
---
Exactly what happened no generators were done
---
pressure is luck based in the first half of the game. if course once you have some injured and hooked survs it‚Äôs skill based, but not being able to find survivors fucks you over
---
This way is much easier...
---
That being said, there are some specific things you can do to counter what you mentioned.
---
Dead Hard - easily the best perk survivors have, the telltale if a survivor has this perk is if they are looking behind them a lot in a chase when they are injured. it does have some counterplay though. One counter is to just wait until they use it, if they aren't near a pallet or vault then there is no reason for to swing, against smarter players you can also bait the dead hard by flicking your camera rapidly as they are probably waiting for the second you swing to use dead hard. Not much you can do against dead hard for distance though.
---
Body blocking - honestly there is nothing you can do about that if the gates are open unless you are playing Nurse or Hillbilly or you use NOED (NOED not guarenteed to still be up though).
---
Flashlights - Honestly flashlights are just more annoying that useful these days. Just look at a wall, make a turn towards the direction you believe is less likely someone is going to get a flashlight save from, or just bait the save by pretending to pick up the survivor and then not.
---
A super hilarious way to counter bad swf groups though is to proxy camp as bad swf teams are generally over altruistic (usually) which can turn into an easy win for you no matter how bad you are at the game.
---
[This is how you do a chain](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
---
Body blocking, yes I‚Äôll def give mad grit a try, I haven‚Äôt been getting many flashlight saves when I‚Äôm playing killer, I mean ppl attempt to flashlight save but their timing is always off. Dead hard ik how to counter but it‚Äôs so annoying late game
---
Dwight: \*teabags\*
---
Michael: KNOW YOUR PLACE, TRASH
---
All of your lost socks. The entity took them
---
Most people don‚Äôt care about the aura reading and it can easily be countered
---
If they split bbq into two perks, people would still use the bloodpoints version
---
Only billy, huntress and nurse really care about the aura
---
I know, I just felt like doing this
---
Just as a expected.. a survivor main with mental issues.
---
At least if others wanna continue the chain they know what word is next
---
Yeah, on retrospect I think he was trying to be nice but he got in the way more lol. Either way, if the Doctor wasn't greedy in picking me up I would've died.
---
Possibility of the killer having the most used killer perk is quite high tho
---
This made me chuckle
---
Tf even is that trapper build.
---
The legion belong in fortnite. Send them there and do the game a favor.
---
All For Nothing should only work if the killer is further away from you than 10 meters, to make sure it doesn‚Äôt activate mid loops
---
Drop Kick looks like dead hard, but while deadhard for distance is good, and deadharding toward the killer is usually bad, for Drop Kick it‚Äôs the opposite
---
How are the tokens earned? Also, 25% to all action speed is definitely too much.
---
Scientific research can be sufficiently accurate when done independently and with rigorous peer review. What taints the process is when companies pay researchers to perform such research or when the media twists objective research to fit their own agendas. The blame should be on corporations and media, not science itself.
---
IIRC, it kinda is. I don't think there was any reason they should've lost that lawsuit as they had the rights to it, but they chose not to fight it and ultimately made the PERSONAL decision of not putting out anymore content.
---
How about his Insanity build up overtime is slown if the player is occupied (healing/on a gen, Running) but sped up if a player is stationary and crouching. Additionally his holograms are really strong for nothing, Maybe they could spawn in for 4 seconds for the player in which the player can run into them to decrease their insanity but if they are staring for more than 4 seconds they gain their own insanity radius with a preset cap in addition to Doc being able to see them.
---
His club looks like a festive weapon from tf2
---
Being hard to play against is not the same as annoying lmao
---
Literally All of My DbD Friends: Mac, it's the perfect Perk for your Dirty Totem Toucher ways!

Me: .... Y'all remember saying Haunted Grounds was gonna be the Hex that'd finally stop me from Totem Touching all the time, and then it did the opposite.... right?
---
I would remember I was running that as the 5th dull totem broke under my fingers. Every. Single. Match.

Me and my friends named him "George" and we taunt at him to pet him

I believe was removed because it was really specific (only working while carrying someone) and didn‚Äôt fit some of her cosmetics

And maybe there was something else that could be going wrong.

I want it back and I‚Äôd like it if every object hit made the shatter
---
Lol
---
Do you want the skin? If so, do it. If you use another skin, don't.
---
There's not exactly a noticeably advantage to prestiging. I think you slightly get more red items.
---
Just played a game on PS4 where I ran a Nurse around for 3 gens while none of my perks were working (dead hard, self care), the skill check counter lagged so bad I missed half of them and then I run out of the gates and it's glitched, run back in the map and the hatch is glitched (can hear it super loud but not there). God awful Killer got a free kill out of it. This was the first in about 6 games where at least one survivor DCd. This game has officially become way more stress than it's worth so I'm going to take a very long break from it
---
Sadly, they won‚Äôt add small characters. It would have been shrektastic
---
F
---
I‚Äôm a bubba main. But I‚Äôve been using billy lately and he‚Äôs so fun to use, I just get super close to survivors and try to cut of any jukes, and most the time they just run in a straight line or even if they make a slight turn, if your close enough to them that‚Äôs usually easy to manage. I also love his map control and mobility. Is enduring good for billy? Some guy on YouTube said it‚Äôs crazy good for billy. And come to think of it, I feel like I‚Äôve been hating on spirit too much, I might give her a try. But nurse no..EVER!

---
It‚Äôs all up to whether or not you want the bloody outfit. I‚Äôve prestige many survivors and don‚Äôt notice a difference in bloodwebs after I prestige
---
I think this may be scarier than the vast majority of killers.
---
Before you prestige her, make sure you have another viable character to play
---
been seeing so many leatherfaces today and i gotta day not a single one of them won
---
they should make the light ability blind the survivor instantly so all of those toxic survivors who blind you can have a date with karma
---
Considering how I don't consider any of the things you listed as toxic truly in the end, my point still stands.
---
Um, no. There‚Äôs no need to make Blood Warden a hex. Just leave. It‚Äôs simple as that.
---
I play solo yet I play altruistic. I am a healer in most games I play that offer the role so I naturally go for saves and heals. If you unhook a survivor make sure they don't get downed at least before you get the safe unhook. Take a hit for them and protect them. I average at around 18000 bloodpoints without surviving and I pip.
---
How dare you.
---
Breaks will keep you sane.
---
I just now realised you meant body blocking hook because I am an idiot. What you do there is drop the survivor of you see them going for the block soon enough, go to a different hook if it is nearby, or just hit the survivor at which case you have several survivors injured if the survivor you are carrying does get off - healing takes time away from gens Y'know.
---
I think you may be in the wrong subreddit, pal.
---
How?
---
I‚Äôm a doc main tho.
---
Don't they show killer or survivor aura with add ons? Would be useful if they do.
---
The meme means that bubba is just a bad version of billy, it has nothing to do with their movement
---
Those aren't chicken fingers;)
---
You‚Äôre forgiven
---
I still get games with 2 red rank survivors and 2 green ranks and I'm a red ranked billy.
---
I always feel bad for the red rank players in those games. Lol
---
Wait they nerfed rework legion? Like really?
---
Look who's shittin in the tall grass
---
Meg and Nea are right there fam
---
Iron will?
---
Billy has no control over his chainsaw and can be dodged easily, whilst Leatherface can't be dodged, and has control over his chainsaw.
---
It‚Äôs Xbox message
---
A killer who is running Enduring is more often than not going to be running Spirit Fury with it. If a survivor sees that you have Enduring, they can make the logical assumption that you are also running Spirit Fury and act accordingly. Spirit Fury isn't unfair or bullshit in any respect, it just forces survivors to play differently in a way that can be fun and engaging. It forces survivors to make choices about how to act. It's easily counterable, but it also makes certain loops more dangerous for survivors to hang around, which makes it still usable against people who do know how to counter it. Not to mention the fact that it single-handedly makes a lot of killers viable in higher ranks when they wouldn't normally be, and that in turn, increases killer variety. Spirit Fury is a well designed perk and is healthy for the game.
---
They're specifically for the add-ons. Can use them for tracking killer and survivor locations.

I want this now

We need a Killer with a grappling hook like Identity V has. Just Scorpion them over.

I have the Halloween DLC lol. Bought it the first day I bought the game because I love Halloween and Michael Myers. I appreciate the advice though. Is there any way I can get decisive strike for Jake since I'm already at level 20 with him and don't wanna regrind again? I heard when I get to level 30, teachable perks will start appearing in the bloodweb.
---
I'd make it passive. How many games does someone LEGITIMATELY get downed at the exit gate, instead of messing up while BMing?
---
This is great and he looks like he didn‚Äôt skip leg day this time around
---
Lmao thank you üò≠
---
No?
---
Love ghostface. He is so cute.
---
Hokuto Shinken is invincible.
---
I think you have not played killer long enough to have an educated idea about it at all.
---
DbD is not your friend. It's like scream therapy, but at a bunch of people who hate you and scream back.
---
I've maybe only seen 1-3 ace mains. Very rare.
---
Had a match against bubba where he chainsawed me from ten feet away. Once I was on the floor he teleported in front of me, then back to where he was then suddenly picked me up. Needless to say that was a short match.
---
You disgust me.
---
Jonathan as a survivor and he eats the melee with his arm and yeets the killer 10/15/20m
---
tokens are earned by time but I think skill checks might be more balanced.
---
You have to get to lvl 40 on Laurie and then unlock the perk to use it on other survivors. When you are just starting the game it is super easy to get perks as you don't have a whole lot to get randomly.
---
Until you get better at the game I suggest going for Descisive Strike, Adreniline, Borrowed Time, and Dead Hard. You can also go for self care if you prefer to able to heal and do not want to rely on your teammates or bring a medkit.
---
When you say take a game hostage, you mean trying to win
---
I think trapper would give a lot of anxiety, imagine running and being terrified every step that a bear trap is going to clamp on your leg.
---
Don't mind me. Just had a minor heart attack at the end.
---
It's funny when you consider all the drawbacks on Legion's power are to balance it out, when several other killers who share at least 1 or more aspect with it have less or even no penalties from spamming their (usually even more lethal) power even more than Legion.
---
Like compare missing with Legion's power to missing with Nurse, Spirit, Hillbilly, Michael, Pig, Ghostface, Plague, and Leatherface. Keeping in mind all these killers can actually down a survivor with their respective powers, and Legion can't.
---
Listen Chief, I need that extra Ruin time to set my Bear Traps
---
Well, he is NOW. Legion was mid-B before, from the source I checked.
---
And mid-B isn't nerfing territory.
---
I'd sooner bring up the Spirit than Billy. That 200 MS down is basically in a straight line, but comparing Legion's 125 hits to Spirit's invisible 170 really gives Deep Wound a lot to carry.
---
 Is no one going to question that syringe with a purple medley? Or is it just me...
---
all or nothing was originally designed around aggressive jukes but I see what you mean with the loops, maybe a straight line of movement between you and the killer is required for it to work.
---
&lt;3
---
And that is why peer2peer is being replaced by dedicated servers
---
I‚Äôve seen it happen but only a few times. Yeah it‚Äôs mostly for tracking purposes.
---
But anyways, I'm not that bad at the game. Just inexperienced in my opinion. I started playing survivor 2 days ago because I played as killer when I first bought the game
---
Depends on your playstyle really. Most of the exhausting perks are good. If you‚Äôre looking to be altruistic then borrowed time from Bill is a must, and We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever is good for that as well as you get more blood points for saving people. Balanced landing, dead hard, and sprint burst are 3 super good exhaustion perks for helping during chases. Decisive strike mixed with borrowed time can really help with some endgame plays, especially when tagged with Steve‚Äôs babysitter perk. Delieverance from Adam is also good for solo queing as it gives you a chance to unhook yourself in bad situations
---
Billy can turn. Even if not very far. Spirit can go 170, but without the ability to see. Both can down with their respective ability's. So it makes no sense that Legion, who can't down. Only go to 125. He should be between 170-200. Spirit can move freely and down, so Legion should be faster than her. But slower than HillBilly, who can't really move. And they should add his speed add-ons back and make them actually noticeable. Because spirits and Hillbillys are *very* noticeable.
---
you need to fast vault out the locker, just do it as they walk in front of it
---
I remember a glitch happened where the horn sounded in non stop procession for the rest of the match.
---
considering how specific the senerios for push it to the limit are, do you think that 25% would be too fast for unhooking and healing or would it mainly be a problem for generators.
---
And other hilarious jokes you can tell yourself!
---

A trans comment on a non-trans sub, with positive karma? I never thought I'd see the day...

Tbh winning with Bubba can be a feat on its own as they are one if the worst killers in the game as face better survivors.

lightborn? it's called a wall you bot (killer main and competent survivor player who can hit flashlights)
---
I‚Äôve tested it recently with friends because I myself didn‚Äôt believe it worked. It does. Hard to describe what it looks like. If I can find the video I saved I‚Äôll link it. And the look down also doesn‚Äôt always work but it is pretty hard to interrupt the phase without knowing exactly when she starts to do it.
---
Mainly for generators and I still don't know how the tokens are earned
---
It is calm spirit if you want to counter docs scream, same goes for freddy‚Äôs snares
---
Well now you have incentive to cleanse totems I personally do, free 1k points, getting rid of Ruin, and destroying a potential NOED.
---
Medkits can heal you really fast too you know, hell you can get multiple heals out of a really good medkit with add-ons as well, and don't need a prerequisite of cleansing a totem or sitting in a locker to do so. While medkits are limited, so is Inner Strength as there are only 5 totems per match and chances are you will rarely be the one to cleanse all 5, either because someone else did or you didn't find them all. Not to also mention you have to cleanse 1 at a time to get each individual use out of Inner Strength, you can't stack the uses.
---
I'm still not seeing the issue with this perk being OP. It's another way to heal, and by the looks of it one of the better ways of self healing, yet still trumped by group heals or healing from others with something like Botany or We'll Make it.
---
skill checks
---
Dead Hard, self care, balanced landing and borrowed time work for me. Sometimes I‚Äôll switch out self care for kindred so everyone knows where they are if/when I get hooked. Nothing worse then having 3 people come to farm you when there are gens left.
---
I‚Äôll take your entire stock
---
another matchmaking post... thrilling..
---
Have you ever watched someone else play dbd? If so, have you noticed when they see another surv t bagging they immediately say hello survivor? Oh my God they t bagged me! Now I get to play how I always play and feel justified! Oh and a body block! Wow so toxic. They pointed at a pallet!! Immediate ban! grow a pair.
---
I did this before. I actually have a post on here where I did the same to a Claudette. Always feels so good
---
Oh I noticed another problem. All For Nothing can work as a cooldownless Premonition
---
I can definitely understand he's annoying, but thats his kit and he's not that strong. Sucks for those who try to play stealthy though
---
its on steam already tho
---
Hell yeah!
---
Oh I have xbox and it looks way different. You using an app?
---
Save the young son!
---
Hahaha honestly.
---
you tamed the piggy!
---
Don't you hate it when one of your shopping cart wheels just mows through 4 people and leaves them on the floor bleeding with life threatening injuries?
---
Yeah dude, it's awful.
---
Exactly. Both Spirit and Billy can down. And spirit goes 176 and Billy goes 230 chainsaw speed. Both have speed add-ons. Hillbilly's speed add-ons increase his chainsaw speed by either 15 or 20% max 35% increase. Spirits add-ons increase her power by either 5%, 10%, 15%, OR A WHOPPING 40% INCREASE. Not to mention the speed boosts coming out of Phase walking. That's a max 310% for HillBilly and a max 231% speed for spirit. Comparing that to Legion, who goes 125% with NO speed add-ons because the devs wanted to remove any chance of fun
---
They should be removed from game
---
Deserved
---
Dude... it‚Äôs watermarked.
---
Username checks out bc its your cake day!!! Ill be sure to upvote on my alt, friend! Happy cake day!!
---
While he may have deserved it, the killer didnt eaarn it, that was either lag or body block by the nea. He was an inch at the exit....easily should've escaped.
---
You realize that on console we can‚Äôt see any info about the killer and that the ping bar goes up and down as other Survivors enter the lobby and right before the game starts?
---
the noise at the end made me ascend
---
in retrospect push it to the limit  should have 3 or 4 tokens
---
 1 mil bloodpoints gets you to like level 37 so if you wanna level Nancy, Steve and the demogorgon you need more
---
I want it so bad ngl
---
Do gens, do totems, don't crouch literally everywhere, Self Care is overrated, teammates can sit on the hook for a few seconds but try and save before they die/go into 2nd phase, to learn about individual killers and builds then watch DBD streamers/youtubers.
---
I was thinking of adding a cool down to it but It would make it easy to accidentally trigger it and be stuck, maybe a stamina system would help fix that
---
Last I heard Last Year it was looking a bit like the idea got lost and nobody knew where it was so they turned the Smoker into a human
---
Because with the add ons, golden token is like running bond without using a perk slot or you could use blood amber and see where the killer is within 32 meters. Throw a scratched pearl on it to increase aura distance or add prayer beads to add 15 seconds more key usage. People just don't use it often.
---
Bamboozle spiritfury enduring ruin

Well they should not have died then. You can't compensate for and replace a dead team mate with a perk. The killer has a hard enough job getting a 4k before all gens are done as is.
---
what sucks is Legion was actually fun to use pre-nerf too. I'm not talking about throwing on Frank's mixtape and moonwalking like a douche either, but using other non-scummy builds made them fun to use, being able to rubber band between multiple survivors and slowly or quickly whittle them down depending on your add-ons and perks was really fun.
---
Even look at the changes post-nerf, I can see that BHVR was going for that direction with these changes, just all the unnecessary restrictions and nerfs added on top of it made it so it's very ineffective sadly :/
---
Is it justified to report survivors t-bagging by an open exit for holding the game hostage?
---
r/calciumcollectors
---
what was OP about wrath?
---
Counter play: close the distance when someone gets downed - promotes anti-tunnel bhvr. Win win. As far as the bloodpoints go, tough shit.
---
Don‚Äôt he deserved it
---
Fine take my orange arrow
---
So true, can't wait for dedicated server s
---
Thats actually a great idea. Personally id prefer a Christmas skin for my girl Spitit. But hey you take what you get
---
no it isnt noob, its a shit tier addon
---
I use duration and cooldown, I don‚Äôt play Legion without atleast Cold Dirt or Joeys Mixtape
---
time to start running vigil
---
I do like that there's some renditions, but it has enough maps to be its own realm, and none of them are any different. I think it makes it seem stale and repetitive, which is ironically the opposite of the goal of making new map renditions.
---
The chainsaw isn't even spinning in Hillbilly's Mori if you look closely enough.

Discord.
---
Wow. That's some intense shit lol
---
That wasn't Dwight move
---
Idk if "balanced" is the word, skillcheks are pure rng. Time would be better!
---
All day the last 3 days I've been getting this. I feel your pain.
---
Shirtless Myers fan art. The Entity has a lot of spare time
---
thanks
---
I just searched it. It is not.
---
I feel like you have no idea what you‚Äôre saying honestly lol.  But I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a streamer say ‚Äúoh they‚Äôre saying hi to me‚Äù ..... what exactly is your argument right now? You‚Äôre making literally no sense to me.
---
Yea but the Pig is also a frail, drug addicted woman. I feel like most people would put up a decent fight against her. If anything, she‚Äôs the killer I‚Äôd *most* want to face off against in a real life scenario, because she‚Äôs probably one of only two that I‚Äôd have a realistic chance against.
---
As a newer player I like it because it's easy to navigate through (as someone else already said pretty much all the renditions are the same lol), unlike indoor maps like L√©ry's and the Game which I absolutely despise as a new player due to them being disastrous labyrinths. And it also has a handful of balanced landing (my favorite perk) spots with the houses and the basement drops
---
Restart game and message support.  Bugs happen in this game sadly.
---
Damn, wish we got hurricanes over here in the UK
---
Yup, it was rough match as Huntress at Lery‚Äôs with 2 gens left, no way I‚Äôm letting dude get away lol
---
A tip as a non ghostface player. based on a lot of my mistakes:
---
I am pretty much straight forward, that thing of hiding and stalking doesn't really fits me, So while I start the match trying that, the moment I get a little bit distracted I find myself just running around like a pretty much M1 killer so try to adapt to him.
---
Even if not done without intention I usually stop stalking due to pressure from the survivors, so I suppose you need to remain chill.
---
But even then I manage to get some kills with him.
---
1.- Remember even if you are not going to stalk, his ability helps you get closer to survivors, sometimes it is better to not lose time stalking and going direclty for the hit/grab.
---
2.- Whenever a survivor gets marked they will receive a notification (really devs?) so try to mark a survivor at a distance you are able to do something.
---
3.- Sometimes you want to be seen, survivors trying to reveal you will also reveal their position.use that to your advantage, for example when looing for the hatch.
---
Definitely agree. I (and a few people I know) also do it so people know they're on a stream. If they want to come and say hi they can, and it also let's them watch back and see how they did if they like.
---
I actually made that pun by complete accident but I'll take it
---
dear t-bag me! FOR I AM THE CRACKER OF NUTS!
---
Oh. That's fine I don't mind losing 10 levels. Is there any way to be safe and prevent that from happening?
---
AND THAT'S WHY I LOVE THIS GAME
---
As a huntress main I don‚Äôt like Lerys and the Game because they‚Äôre very compact maps, so that make landing hatchets harder.  At the same time I appreciate how they‚Äôre at least distinctive; I feel like Springwood just feels plain and unremarkable as opposed to the hospital layout of Lery‚Äôs or the multilayered Gideon Meat Plant map.
---
I just got called a cunt yesterday. Apparently little old Jake main with a tool box is able to save someone dead on hook
---
I wanted to buy that game, but to be honest it was the kind of "yeah, I'll do it tomorrow" kinda wanting. while the characters were interesting (their abilities, their looks were crap) it is poretty much a infected vs survivors game from l4d.
---
Oof, that was so sexy.
---
To be fair, legion is a lot more easy to turn than billy. Don't think he needed a speed need tho
---
Still 20 bucks üò¨
---
really a fucking walnut for not knowing that really dude
---
Lmao did a kyf with some of my best friends.  Our friend lets call her Beth mains huntress no matter what. We all spammed game pieces. She dc'd.
---
You got hit by the face camping bubba tonight too huh?
---
I‚Äôm glad your experience with him has been positive, but I‚Äôve done the math, and bounced my numbers off the estimated time to instill madness three optimally with him, and found that basically every other killer in the game gets to where he wants to be, which is his chase on madness three and two slugs for a down, and m1 killers tend to have a better down time than him, his only benefit being the madness itself not allowing actions, and slowing the game a down a bit in doing so. Statistically he‚Äôs a decent M1 killer, but to get any value out of his M2 for a chase, you‚Äôre increasing the time it takes to down survivors. At best he‚Äôs mid tier, he‚Äôs really good against less skilled survivors, he‚Äôs really bad against high skilled survivors, and he‚Äôs decent at mid. Most optimal way to play him is getting tier two on the whole session, keeping them locked in that by constant downs and chases, and hoping your hallucinations come in clutch for an easier time with applying pressure. He‚Äôs a lot of RNG tho, and keeping tier three on people isn‚Äôt feasible without his high tier add ons, so I just use him for blood point farming. I can typically let the whole lobby leave and still pick up a pip and 40k+. My point wasn‚Äôt that his ability is totally worthless in a chase, just that in making his ability worthwhile in a chase, you could‚Äôve just done a standard M1 chase and gotten the two thwacks in well before tier three needed to be relevant.
---
Unfortunately some of these bugs there is no way to help prevent them as they happen randomly.  Even worse there is nothing support really can do or would do to help.
---
Literally this entire post is about Last Year: The Nightmare. So yes. You are indeed, a fucking walnut.
---
I like playing Huntress too and now I'm curious, would you consider mother's dwelling her best map?
---
Would support team be able to give the wasted blood points?
---
The same can be said for Spirit. Who moves at 176%. Even with her inability to see survivors it doesn‚Äôt make sense that legion is slower than her, and takes longer to use the ability again.
---
It's a gamble. They've given it when irredecent shards and skins get deleted off accounts so maybe. Wont know until you message support.
---
Scum of the goddamn earth
---
Oh nice I never knew that
---
Do you know how long will it take until they respond back?
---
Its a bit niche, but pretty damn cool
---
Thank god
---
I mean, wasnt that the point of that meter when the doors open? That dwight did nothing wrong. He technically should have won and was celebrating. Dont know why this sub is so quick to defend killers when they can be just as toxic. The game had to put parameters in place just to stop people from drawing out the game.
---
Eventually you have to weigh your option, no way I'm leaving with 0 kills. Im still not gunna camp, but I'm gunna keep a closer eye on your for sure.
---
I got killed by some idiot who thought that hitting me in the hook was the only way to make the bar deplete
---
That isn't necessarily a bad play by them. Piling on generators gives more Blood Points and ensures that the generator gets completed fast. However, you get a speed penalty for every additional survivor working on the same generator as you. This means that if the killer is busy chasing or camping someone, splitting up and doing generators seperately is more time efficient.
---
I run a jumpscare build, and 3 or 4k almost every game. Perks are Monitor and Abuse, BBQ, Surveillance, and Pop Goes the Weasel. I use the Rabbit add-on, but I'm not sure how effective it is.
---
The key to this build is staying in Tier 1 as long as possible, because you'll have no terror radius until you're in a chase. I usually get a couple gen grabs to start the match, and after people realize I have no terror radius, they often get paranoid and hide rather than working on gens. Just sneak up without line of sight on a gen and you'll get a free hit at the very least. Sometimes I'll tier up towards the end of the game, but I often finish games in Tier 1.
---
I DC against Hags as soon as I find out I am versing her. Nine out of ten matches against hags you will die on first hook because they put at least 5 traps around it and proxy camp, denying any attempt to unhook. If people don't trigger her traps on their way in to the hook, she stops whatever she is doing and comes back walking anyway. Basement against her is the same story. Always 4 traps starting right in front of the hook all the way to the top.
---
Spirit, Hag and Freddy are the only killers that I DC on sight. Doesn't matter if they are easy or hard to defeat, they provide extremely unfun gameplay.
---
They just generally don‚Äôt like losing, if what you‚Äôre dying is true, than honestly it‚Äôs them not you
---
Well yeah, but they see you switch to (whatever its called mode) which takes a while and slows you down, then you have to charge up the m2 which slows you down as well. With that time the survivor can go around the loop again and has no need to vault in the first place.
---
My buddy is a doc main and his range is smaller than my dick bro lmao
---
Lol, i love it, its pallet land once you get to know it, unless you are facing a Spirit, then you're dead
---
Quentin is desperate to stay relevant after the scoops ahoy skin drops I see.
---
He could've won yes, but it's his own fault he didn't. He could have left at any time. Its sad that we need endgame to force people to leave because they refused to before
---
I would totally buy that.

You‚Äôre not getting it say they‚Äôre going to the shack and the pallets gone they can only try to run around it or vault. You can deny their vault and there‚Äôs not much they can do except try to run away from it and go down anyways because there‚Äôs nothing to stop doctor from slapping him down. His M2 does slow him down that‚Äôs why you only use it for cutting vaults or pallets when you can time it right. Being a doctor main for 2 years now and I‚Äôm not just getting there by being infinitely looped with zero counter play or options.
---
pig
---
As mediocre as the drawing is, though i would be much worse, it looks amazing. If i was a dev i would DEFENITLY make it a skin
---
You‚Äôre not understanding. What the fuck? 
---
They can‚Äôt vault or drop a pallet after being shocked. Good luck looping pig tree against a doctor. The range on his shock is further than your lunge? And the shock effects last long enough to get closer and smack them? Yeah I‚Äôve been playing against rank 1 potatoes for two years. Caught me.
---
i already hate that it's based on the reboot elm street but i seem to get it probably like....every other match even without offerings....im just sick of it
---
If messages are going to bother you, then I would suggest either blocking messages from people not on your friends list, or setting it up so they show in a different spot. My xbox messages from non-friends show up in a "message requests" section where they are easily ignored.
---
Two exhaustion perks might not be best for a lot of people, but if you can make it work, that's cool. DH and BL are some of the easier exhaustion perks to control when they fire, so it may not be that bad.
---
Billy would automatically be the worst killer in the game was he 110%
---
I think I‚Äôm honestly going to uninstall the game
---
How is your internet connection? If you gets DC's that often it may be that people are lagging since the killer hosts the game. Lucky dedicated servers are coming soon
---
Myers: "Hey, where ya goin'!?"
---
This is so painful that it hurts
---
slow the game down...
---
#JUST A LITTLE BIT
---
i guess.....but i rather just have a toolbox or a key that i can actually use to open a hatch
---
Lmao that scream is gold
---
When you admit to bein one of the people that fuck over the team just because you dont like playin against the killer expect it smh
---
The bloodweb change is so fucking awesome. The grind is still there but just a little bit less.
---
That's good then. I've sees some with the same opinion as you but thought the things I'd listed are toxic.
---
Unless you have dileverance then you get a free pass
---
I should do that. Good idea!
---
That shit happened to me too and they all hid in lockers the entire fucking match. Thought I was going insane or that my game glitches out because I couldn‚Äôt find anyone and not a single gen was done after 20 minutes. I finally found them in the basement as they were switching from locker to locker. Had a full basement party that trial. Whenever I see a default Dwight now I want to pull out a mori.
---
Wth this looks so Good.
---
Idk how to make it so not friends can't message me. Help :( l
---
i think that hag is not easy killer to go against.They unhook,u kill the guy who did the unhooking and repeat with hag xD
---
I will do that, thank you
---
I love the map. The colour scheme is great, the map layouts are great, the pallets are great in mindgame potential, I like the randomised nature of the 5 maps because there‚Äôs nothing better than uncertainty in this game.
---
I thought this was a rainbow six post for a sec
---
Oh man that's super helpfull, thank you very much!
---
For those cases, I recommend stepping away from the screen and brewing yourself a nice cup of tea or go on a walk outdoors.
---
The killer is stuck in the game just as much as you  and might just get annoyed by you not DCing. ;)
---
It's not holding the game hostage. That is when you make it so that the game literally cannot end.
---
As long as you have them at level 3, exhaustion  is not a problem. Even for new players and especially against tunnelers. Either perk can get you enough distance to escape them.
---
Thank you, I will remember about it.
---
At this point, ppl should gain like 10 times bp on the ptb in order to test everything thoroughly

most maps are too small to even be able to see survivors effectively, they're still far away so just try to trick the killer by going a different direction once the bbq aura read ends, or be close enough to the killer so they don't see you (just always assume they have it especially if they have other meta perks)
---
Stealing in any sense isn't ok. What was the logic there? I'm trying to say that the person stealing from the kid is just as guilty as the one stealing from the bank. I'm saying both sides can be toxic. Why is survivor toxicity seen as so much worse than the killers? They even added a meter so that games aren't dragged out. That Dwight had all the right to t-bag.
---
Is it a safe rescue or not? Do you lose emblem points or not?
---
Oh look the dead by daylight killer, seems like DEATH isnt an escape it seems !
---
Gg dude
---
No PTB progress is separate you have to level everything again when its in the actual game.
---
BHVR PLS
---
switch lag
---
Eh, still no. You make the decision that you may not use that perk at all in the game when you bring it. Same as bringing something like up the ante where it can be useless or help.
---
Ah. It happened to me tonight, it was pretty bad XD
---
Nice
---
Head on
---
And bugs. Tons of bugs.
---
Most welcome
---
It was good. Then I got tunneled
---
That's the Spirit
---
That's what he gets for being a toxic piece of shit
---
Try all killers. You'll like some, and some not. But you'll find the one killer that'll let you win almost everytime. It may not be your favourite, but you'll be the best while playing him. When I want to Play for fun, I play Freddy or Hillbilly. When I want to win, I play Huntress. Then I'm not wondering, whether I'll win or not. Then, I'm wondering how mamy gens they'll manage to fix before I KILL THEM ALL HAHAHAHA
---
To protect the baby Dwight's from devastation
---
If it releases 2 weeks after the ptb starts like they've done in the past they'll only have 3 work days of summer left after the chapter releases.
---
It'll have to be day 1 stranger things chapter or right after.
---
Enduring no longer lowers the stun time on head on. It's now been restricted to only pallets
---
I literally grabbed a Jane off a gen as Doctor yesterday
---
People would use only pink/purple offerings/addons/items. We don't want that.
---
Ignoring the huge amount of draw backs that come with the legions power
---
It really depends on how you use them, Billy is more of a runner that can chase and knock down survivors or run through the whole field in a matter of 5 seconds, at the cost of suppressed turning speed.
---
 Leather face uses his Chainsaw in a more of Area of Effect way since he can down a survivor or two quickly during a chase. Though that's just it.
---
But if it's anyone who goes by Pressuring GenRepairs, quick downing and Speed travelling, Billy takes the cake
---
Oooh damn nice one!
---
What is his speed now and what was it before? I'm talking about frenzy speed

You'll get it easily playing Nurse, good luck. All I ask, not demand, just ask, is to stop playong her once you get to r1, she's a huge turnoff for the game, a Killer with very little interaction and no counterplay.
---
PS: I got to r1 with Clown my first time.
---
Thank you!
---
That's dumb I would attempt to save too she just expected you to let everyone die while she watched the hook
---
Why not just limit the use of addons then like 1 game a day or something for pink 2 for purple etc... seems like there‚Äôs a lot of easy fixes if that‚Äôs the only issue
---
And if you use the fragrant hair tuft in addition it‚Äôs almost impossible to fully stalk before the gates are powered
---
Probably laggy. Nothing is more unfun than running towards a window and you teleport 2 feet to the left of it.
---
Enduring only affects Pallet stuns, no other stuns at all.

And this is why you never fuck with Myers.

Yes. 125 now, previously 132%.

Or, we change nothing because he is under powered at best.

Can we talk about his body?

He's my favorite killer to play because I'm colorblind, and he's great for farming BP.
---
The EGC was added due to toxic cunts taking the game hostage and bot leave when they are at the gates, and because of hatch standoffs, and the survivors are 4 being toxic, the killer is alone, but you seem to be an entitled survivor main who tbag 24/7 and whine when karma hits you

well‚Ä¶ people dc in dbd it's a fact. But if you always have 1 or 2 DC in your killer games, something might still be off with you.
---
It's not about finding, that's just easy, it's about catching.  A good survivor will loop you for 2 gens. And you can't just quit to find a other one. If you find another one that's good -GG
---
I didn't suggest any perks, so...
---
Fun is subjective. And so is a nuisance. I find him annoying because a lot of them have no one escapes death or hold the game hostage. I play killer half of my matches and genuinely believe killers of the weaker side of the two. I just find Doctor very unfunny to play against and think he does his job well since he is supposed to be annoying and anti stealth
---
Classic meta build :
---
Decisive strike - to delay your death when the killer has tunnel vision.
---
Borrowed Time - to delay someone else death when he killer has tunnel vision.
---
Dead hard - the most versatile exhaustion perk
---
Iron Will - it helps against the two top tier killers
---
Yeah. Just like camping or tunneling. Taking the game hostage is another valid way to win. I play killer in half of my matches and believe survivors are much stronger than killer. Any strategy that works is going to get Killers hate. I just don't like 30 minute matches that reward me 15K points. And if I quit I'll get banned or screw over the other players which is not something I want to do, so sitting through that is frustrating.
---
Subjectivity is a thing and I find the doctor to be my second least favorite killer in the game. Of course number one being the legion. Something I think belongs in fortnite and Not Dead by daylight.
---
Would love to see what clown looked like when he was not a clown
---
Yes he is but as long as he's not hooking OP, he can't play a new game, can he?
---
He is willingly stuck in the game in order to annoy OP and get him to DC but OP can play the same game and just not do anything and use the time for a cup of tea/using the bathroom.
---
And tons if love to pacth up the bugs with the big income of the money
---
This game seems just let top tier killers do their shit while skilled low tiers killers are getting bullied at red ranks, waiting for buffs that will never come. And when we play survivor, we always do get the same killers all the time. That's so annoying. **Cries in oink and Stabby Gang**
---
Leatherface is easy to dodge - literally just run around a tight object like a rock or a tree when he is in chainsaw mode.

I‚Äôm pretty sure I could drop kick a pile of bones actually

Jake!!!!
---
Honestly this is a great idea.
---
We surprisingly had a lot of very humorous killers that joined meming with us. Was actually a lot of fun playing with this group
---
Zubat is sarcastic most of the times.I have not seen him complain as much as True.Also wishing someone to die is a bit drastic no?
---
Gotta do a lot of grinding to level up, ouch
---
Not on my watch.
---
I mean, you can already dodge SWF if you want just by checking their Steam profiles, unless they're private of course. In 90% of cases they're not, so it's easy to dodge already. I don't do that because killer queues are long, but let's not pretend you can't dodge SWF even now. It takes few seconds to check their friend list because you can click on their names in the lobby.

Im frustrated to only be playing against 3 killer :D
---
Fucking hell, these are brilliant!
---
Im a Hag main here. I get a lot of DCs against her. They get frustrated when you start snowballing
---
Its definetly harder than survivor if you play low rank killers, but that has nothing to do about toxicity. What are you getting at?
---
Yeah, he keeps respecting
---
Especially doc players that tunnel üôÉ
---
I am a Doc main and I love playing against Docs
---
Then you sir are a masochist.
---
You think thats bad? I got 3 rank 4s and 1 rank 1 as a rank 14 killer
---
&gt;Taking the game hostage is another valid way to win.
---
except that it's actually bannable if only you used it in a right way
---
Some people just don't give no fucks. Most of them are in the lower ranks too, so it's the newer and less advanced players they are fucking over. Good killers will take it easy on 3 man's, when it happens to me as killer it usually ends up being a good amount of bloodpoints for everyone who doesn't dc and I'll let 1 or 2 people live.
---
Doesn‚Äôt justify a DC though - it was petty. 
---
The guy could just play another survivor game, it‚Äôs not the end of the world if you don‚Äôt complete the daily in one match.
---
If their duration was longer, they'd actually be useful...

MmmmhhhhEugene... Mmmore blud please. Mmmmdon't go easy on the clots. Mmmm.
---
I find that funny because it's not possible for me to do that on Xbox, my internet is great so even downloading games I can still be killer and have no lag issues.
---
Trust me, I hate it &lt;3
---
Yeah. The survivors completely decide the match. If one attempts to wiggle off of a hook or dies on their first hook you can't even get Adept killer.
---
I think it also depends on the region or time you play. For example almost every doctor I come across has no one escapes death and plays quite toxic.
---
did you fail a DS and then get another? doesn't the perk disable itself if you fail?

Is there a reward, badge or icon for achieving this? I'm lacking motivation to try harder and just have fun instead.

I try not to run it until I get to ranks 10 or better. It's really not fair to anyone who's even moderately new to the game.
---
Yeah man it really does feel bad sometimes.  
---
Honestly I find playing the lowest tier killers the most fun too, nothing is enjoyable about playing spirit or nurse for me tbh.
---
Well for example... if you block a survivor in a corner or in the basement or something and don't kill them. Instead holding them hostage... Then yes. It is bannable. Although that is not a valid strategy and it's common knowledge that that sort of thing is bannable. I was pretty clear about what I meant.
---
I love pointing out the fact that I don't hate dr. But I think he does exactly what he is supposed to( counter stealth and be annoying). And saying I experienced a lot of similar patterns from those who play him. = Downvotes. Feelsgoodman.
---
Idk about you but I have 5 minutes between each class. I WISH I could do my homework between classes üò≠
---
You need to time it right. You can go in a kyf‚Äôs and test the hitbox around the locker for how close the killer has to be or practicing a lot in online lobbies helps too. If you aren‚Äôt using quick n quiet I recommend that
---
Yeah I‚Äôm sorry, Life as a solo survivor is pretty difficult. Maybe try discord or something and you can link up with competent survivors.
---
5 min is all you need just write fast as u can
---
a great question
---
yea.
---
Makes sense, the intent on the fixation of one surv. would be tunneling...
---
Fair point
---
I agree about left behind it shouldn't affect gen speed and to my understanding OP is trying to balance left behind so that is a useless perk designed for the last person to do gens so removing gen speed increase would make 100% sense
---
to be fair, if i was impaled on a hook, id scream like a bitch too

Go watch nearly any killer YouTuber or streamer that‚Äôs okay with him, you‚Äôll see why it‚Äôs good.  Tru3 does it fairly well
---
Haha! That‚Äôs why we should always play nice
---
Why wouldn't you save them until a few days from now?..
---
You have chosen.... *BAIT*
---
Thank you, that‚Äôs a solid answer. I see the value, and I see why someone would choose to open with the shock instead of the thwack. Guess it just isn‚Äôt my cup of tea, since I found putting them into tier two, then hard chasing with M1 was faster for me.
---
This is an old screenshot
---
Yeah
---
Maybe they are playng with dying light or remember me, or they just don't know that hitting multiple survivors gives them bigger chance to get more kills.

Yeah they're really just for tracking. You're meant to run into them to get rid of them 
---
I like them though,  imo they're the best part of doctors kit. It's why I always run restraint add on.
---
This has nothing to do with a hook bomb. There's survivors everywhere, but no, I need to be the priority above the rest. Read the post- tunneling. I know the difference.
---
Also. Most tunnelers just proxy camp hard. How is anyone suppose to do a save rescue, when he keeps his eyes on me.
---
You have to factor in map pressure. Even if Billy never hits anyone with a chainsaw throughout the whole game and just smacks them he can get from point A to point B really fucking fast and stop gen rushing if he knows there are gens
---
Tunneling =\= toxic. It's a strategy of eliminating 1-2 survivors as quick as possible to apply pressure and make game easier. Stop bitching, ffs
---
It's too much effort to implement in the first place for what is merely a test

I used to run a few builds on him. My current "main" build is Enduring + Spirit Fury (A go to staple for many killers to chew through pallets fast, and VERY good on Fake Pallet Freddy) as well as BBQ + Pop Goes The Weasel.

For addons I like to run Red Paint Brush and Swing Chains. Pallets are also good.

Many people disagree. Going fast will always be more fun. I would rather go fast for 5 seconds than go slow for 20.

Oh I have. Emote spam is not as frowned upon in other games as it is in this one. In this game it's a cardinal sin. In other games you just kill them back and move on. In other games it's encouraged. It isn't here.

Honestly then Spirit is probably a better killer for that. while I agree the speed is overall more fun, The amount of hits I get because people mistake how far I am from them.
---
This is nice wholesome content i like to see
---
Probably just cells if devs know people will like it
---
Pig is actually pretty solid, doesn't mean she needed nerfs tho. She's is way above doc however
---
did they not know you can still escape with it on?
---
Easy doesn‚Äôt matter, I‚Äôd rather have something else for at least 30k BP.
---
NOED on a killer that can instadown?
---
I don‚Äôt find doc annoying anymore.  I have died exclusively to his exhaustion adding a number of times, though, but exhaustion addons are fairly broken and it‚Äôs crazy they never revisited them at all.
---
Then again, meg skin coating shards üëÄ
---
For this killer idea? No... if your gunna make a ranged weapon killer it has to be a skill shot, and cooldown based and this has none of that
---
A leak posted awhile ago has the dates and prices of the cosmetics. Kates will be cells only but you can buy jeffs with shards
---
A lot of killers are underwhelming there that's why I said all ranks, that you don't see here much in the red ranks isn't a surprise... but you see here   rarely on every rank, been a while on rank 16-14 last month but now I am back at rank 5 as a surv and well can't remember to face a pig in this time tbh
---
Obviously she is hiding
---
I'm currently rewatching breaking bad and getting addicted to DBD so this meme is very relevant to me so enjoy the updoot
---
I believe he did say, the good cosmetics always are Auric Cells only. So Meg‚Äôs is therefore not good.
---
Trying to do Scratched Mirror and ending up going to Macmillan instead of Lery's is bad enough, but it was my last offering and I didn't have any more which was annoying, as the game doesn't give it back
---
Hehe I‚Äôve actually been running enduring at high rank just to juke people xD. 80% of the time it works every time
---
I don't like that they added more sounds to tiering up and getting shocked, they are REALLY loud.
---
Otherwise there isn't much wrong with doc, 3 gen hostage doc is bannable so at least the guy gets punished. 
---
Doc is pretty outdated by now, he needs some updates.
---
Why? Theyre usually not very skilled players
---
Actually the game's developers recognize the 3 gen hostage doc as holding the game hostage, since you are not trying to advance the game. 
---
Some people got banned for running that build and trying their best to push the game over an hour long.
---
I‚Äôve started to let the last player live if it was a good game. But I bring them to the hatch. Close the hatch. Let them open the exit. Then hit them and leave so they have to crawl out. I feel like it‚Äôs almost insulting so it‚Äôs a rude way to be nice.
---
I once had a Pink Powerranger and a Red Powerranger in my lobby. Pre game, they told me they were the real Powerrangers and asked me to watch season 24, however, they weren't sure if that's even the right one, because at this point the writers don't even know what they're doing anymore. Shit was hilarious
---
A friend of mine and I played ‚Äúred light green light ‚Äú with a leather face until the random opened the gate. Then he bodyblocked me in a corner until the entity got me. After the match he sent a message saying ‚ÄúBubba‚Äôs friend‚Äù. It was fantastic.
---
That's not what hostage doc is tho.
---
Hostage doc is taking Distressing, Overcharge, Unnerving presence and a perk of your choice. You use Calm and Order add ons.
---
You locate your 3 close gens at the start of the match and sit there. On maps like The Game, Yamaoka or Azarov's resting place those can be all basically in shock range.
---
You shock people to tier 3, kick the gen with overcharge + unnerving and try to kill 1 person by camping them in treatment mode. If played properly you can stall the game for over an hour if you're vs solo survivors, I've seen one of those last 2 hours.
---
It‚Äôs weird how PC has the achievement reaching Rank 1, but console doesn‚Äôt have it.
---
Spirit is just a better wraith change my mind
---
You get a lot better killers than I do lol.
---
I have been playing pig through all these nerfs, annoying but aren't that bad tbh
---
The only thing Doc is good for is the gimmicky 3 gen hostage thing. Leatherface at least punishes player mistakes well, and Legion can easily get multiple hits on many targets/get a first hit on someone more reliably than Wraith.
---
Doc's power is outdated and buggy, many times the survivor will be able to vault despite getting shocked, and even if it works the shock will only be useful on very unsafe loops.
---
True, and same, but they are a bit of a deterrent
---
Darn. Monto always seemed to have a lot of fun playing it.
---
Yes but Wraith gets the element of surprise. And Wraith can be good. Doctor can too but nobody plays him correctly. Legion has an actual limit to how well you can do with him.
---
Ace In The Hole and Plunder‚Äôs Instinct. That‚Äôs all you need as a Plunderer
---
When both the Killer and survivor on knowledgeable, the killer will always win
---
As a killer main I can say that‚Äôs not how I play (I‚Äôm still new tho rank 16) I just go for whom ever the closest player is
---
That's true. All the people were complaining about the trap nerf with the endgame collapse but it's just logical, would be way too op otherwise, but it made them harder to use, sometimes they rush the gens in 3 seconds while you still own 3 traps - what makes them useless
---
Doc is my least favourite killer to play against ngl. Especially in an indoor map. His radius is limitless ahaha
---
I play both PC with friends ans PS4 solo and they are quite equal on teammates being complete pieces of shit and camping killers
---
David gets points for taking ppl off hooks. I'm leveling David right now and it's painful. I can explain it with any rationality but I just don't like him with his stupid face
---
Rank 20 killers are always good, but rank 20 survivors.. they are awful, I can keep the killer with me for 4 minutes, and 0 gens are done, and of course I die at the first hook, because nobody is gonna save me..
---
It‚Äôs the number at the end of the url when you click on your profile. If you have a custom url, you may have to google how to find it. In the attachments you can just add a screen shot of your in game id if you didn‚Äôt type it in.

I‚Äôm a rank 16 killer got paired with two rank 8‚Äôs, a rank 9 and a rank 3
---
I can see them wanting David to die since he always seems to be the borrowed time hook farmer but why Feng? Shes sweet and innocent
---
Yeah it'd be cool if the rbdgame caused for like a blood warden hold of like 30 seconds though. And then rumor has it theyre making her dash not count as a normal attack now so it won't apply any perk powers...just seems really harsh for a character who is fine how she is

If you have more questions, feel free to ask them!

yep rory is great at that had to order right away
---
I had a killer face camp me because he said I got Feng killed so I dunno either.
---
I never have Ash NOT selected, and I never hear him in the main menu. Which platform do you play on?
---
One of the major problems was that you could swap Killer freely in matches, so it was hard to add in new killers that were both meaningfully different and kept balance up.
---
And that Survivors could craft a tazer and keep the Killer stunned eternally didn't help.
---
Same for my gf and me (she lvl 15-14 and me 16-15)
---
Matching against killers around 16-9 and yesterday against a lvl 2 bubba
---
From my experience fengs think they are looping gods around windows. But they mostly are not.
---
Davids on the other hand keep dead harding into my weapon. I'm not even trying to murder them, they just come to me and drop dead.
---
How do you ever get there in time to take advantage of it, though?
---
Texture problems on certain maps, teleportation glitch, animations getting stuck, questionable hitboxes.
---
I think that if they reworked some of his add ons and buff others he could be back at least at some point. Frank mixtape is a total trash. Nobody wants to use this crap. Same with the 2nd purple one that lowers deep wound state on first hit ( I forgot what it's called)
---
Yea I used a website that tells you your steamID64. Thanks!
---
Every fuckin time

Generator done by you* instead. Not a full gen obviously, even just a tap, as long as you're on it when it finishes. Or if that's too harsh make it so it's any gen you worked on. Will people just run around and tap every gen in sight? Yes. And they will get that BP so who cares.
---
That explains it- I‚Äôm on PC, so for some reason Ash only speaks in the select screen and in the lobby.

The trick is to not care if it's gonna be HG, and to never, e v e r apologize when it is. Embrace your Dirty Totem Toucher ways!

Honestly, this is what had me stuck at rank 16 for most of this month, I'm finally back up after a bunch of dying by either getting tunnel off hook or by not getting saved
---
First of all, no I never said all survivors do this, second of all I never said to ban people for using perks? I said nerf the crutch perks, thirdly gen rushing is a thing, when survivors are ‚Äútry Harding‚Äù by the other toxic acts I said before (body blocking, teabagging, 99 hooks) just to anger the killer and then get all 5 gens done within 2 minutes. So actually read the post, your reply was idiotic and insulting. Get your facts together then reply

Anyone else getting the same answer?

It's the other way around, long loops are harder to punish with it, really short ones are easier.
---
You can't shock deny something like shack, but you can deny small loops like the short fence ones on Thomson's house or around the fallen Torment creek.
---
Why do survivors have made up rules that killers have to follow ? Ask yourself that.
---
Does killer get a free pass to DC when ruin gets cleansed early? Hell no, same applies for survivor
---
Get hits on a carried survivor. Getting protection hits is really difficult as you have to be on the injured survivor and block a hit within a really small range. Mettle of man now is really weak because the downsides are okay but not the requorement for the perk to activate.
---
Looking to the right ?
---
I do all of that. But still almost never get it off. Getting hit around down and hooked survivors works aswell.
---
I've been having this same problem and resolved it yesterday after giving the insides a bit of a clean. 
---
You want a T8 screwdriver (it's like a six pointed star), a standard screwdriver, a can of compressed air, and a YouTube video guide (if it's your first time).
---
I personally just took the bottom off and gave it a good clean from that side, because I'm lazy and the top side is more fiddly with lots of screws to take out and wires to disconnect, whereas the bottom doesn't. Also, you have access to the fan from this side which I suspected was full of shit and was the main issue, which it was.
---
I cleared all the dust from the fan, the grills, and blew plenty of air inside to try and clear any dust in the places I couldn't see. Put it back together, booted up the game, and praise the lord, no more 'PS4 is too hot' messages.
---
For the record this problem only occurred with DBD and only at the loading screen. I found if I kept spamming x as soon as I started up the game I would pass the loading screen without the PS4 shutting down and not have any more problems, even if I got the warning. But if I let the intro play out, even for a few seconds, I would get the warning and the PS4 would turn off. Bizarre. Sorted now though.
---
 don't act like you haven't wanted to see Michael Myers 6 pack
---
Not exactly. Bubba uses his chainsaw sideways ,while Billy goes straight
---
I don‚Äôt tunnel any survivors in particular, but I will say that Feng just sounds so annoying. Plus they‚Äôre usually people who are only okay at survivor but think they‚Äôre amazing, so they‚Äôre an easy down.
---
You could use Jake Park's Saboteur perk, it lets you break hooks without a toolbox.
---
I do so love that I‚Äôm getting down voted for suggesting something that a lot of people want, which is to take his one add-on and make it part of his base kit, and remove something else that is easily so strong it SHOULD be an add-on. Lol
---
Camt wait to do this with my Corgi.
---
The game doesn't register as a protection if youre too far away from the survivor. I think they should  change the way the event occurs. Something like:
---
"Every time the killer is in a chase with another injured survivor and you take a hit, the protection hit event is registered."
---
Mettle of man is really not worth for a perk slot, notbright now at least. I wouldn't use it if you're not planning a rescue build. Killers normally get a hit on you if they're around the hook and getting a hit around them get the event as well
---
And can you tell me if BBQ, Ruin, Nurse Calling and NOED are creating good build for him?
---
Lol ds is not unbalanced since the rework but kay
---
I fear to move my hand when playing
---
Good.
---
I don‚Äôt necessarily take it easy (still gotta get my points somehow) but I ALWAYS let the last guy get hatch and message the DCer.
---
316 and 4 commented, yikes
---
But again, whats the harm in getting more points?
---
Platform: pc, so far
---
Bug: if while injured you use the ultra rare instaheal a few miliseconds before being downed, the instaheal applies to your dying state,essentially instahealing urself to full health while downed
---
and? Killers play Survivor as well. whats your Argument?
---
It is very unbalanced and only surv mains are able to say otherwise.
---
Or tell me how literal free escapes are "balanced". By your logic a NOED that can be used once per survivor but cannot be cleansed would be "fair". Yeah, show me how you stop people who got hooked close to an open gate without a mori.  
---
Actually, maybe I should just run a mori in each match. So I can kill them if they try to escape with DS. hmm
---
Let‚Äôs see...
---
32,000 max at base.
---
BBQ raises it to 64,000.
---
Bloodhunt raises that to 96,000.
---
5 x gruesome gateaux would be 515%, so an additional 164,800.
---
So 260,800?
---
They are really behing schedule, and stuff like the summer event got pushed off the table to 'focus on it'. And yet, it's still just tests and vague shit.
---

now thats some next Level RNG lol
---
You‚Äôre complaining about tunnelling. There are no rules against tunnelling.
---
I assume there was some point that you were trying to put across in addition to ‚Äúall killers are tunnellers‚Äù, e.g. ‚Äútunnelling is bad‚Äù.
---
This.
---
I mean once you hit someone you get a 5 second stun for no reason, and now you're just an M1 killer because deep wounds don't help in chase
---
 Also vaulting windows is cool, but ny the time your stun wears off the time saved is negligible
---
Bill can end a chase before it even fuckin starts
---
That was the average back when i continued levelling her. I had 27 Iris heads and about 40 belts in 50 bloodwebs.
---
well that looks more realistic than 3 per Web lol
---
And they all dead lmao
---
Let's be real, you were dead the moemnt you were hooked
---
But that is still an insane amount of god tier addons. I just dont bring them because everyone would dc anyway
---
Why are you hooking so close to an open gate? Hook spawns are at a pretty high density in the current state of the game. Taking a risk for the further hook is sometimes a rewarding play in the endgame.
---
Alternatively, Blood Warden all the overly altruistic little fuckers. 
---
Or my favorite play: Slug everyone remaining and make them crawl out the exit gate while you nod or (as Ghostface) teabag them. So much more personally gratifying than hooking them tbh.
---
Fuck noed

After micheal was toxically insulted he stabbed Dwight through the body saying ‚ÄúBe gone THOT‚Äù
---
To be honest, not really. It counters infectious fright, doc shocks and long distance clown bottles. Not screaming while hit and not alerting crows are borderline worthless.
---
First things first get yourself headphones, as a killer you really need to rely on sound. Next look at the killers and play as an easy or intermediate killer to get the mechanics down. 
---
Try hillbilly or wraith, Billy is good to get used to skills and you don't need perks or add ons to get good with him. Wraith has a decent power and some good stats and will help you learn the mind games you need as he is just what's know as an m1 killer.

After that just so what you want, don't care what people say, don't listen to how you should play. You're playing a killer, everything you do will be considered toxic or unfair. Use what perks your want, camp the hook if you want, just have fun in your game, and remember right now all your trying to do is earn bloodpoints not rank or kills, with perks and add ons comes builds and that's when you'll sine as a killer.

Why didn't you use ds in your first opportunity? The gate was at 99% and you were right next to it, plus you had Dead Hard, so you wouldn

Cleanse before Gens, Gens before Friends

I feel like tacking on BP is a weak fix. Being worth the slot has to mean something.

I‚Äôd love to see ‚ÄúSacrificing a survivor in the basement speeds up sacrificing on other hooks by 20 seconds. This bonus Does Not Stack/Stacks Only Once/Stacks Twice.

---
Full map hatchet throw without aura reading at the start of the match. A friend of mine was watching and I said as a joke that my aim was that good that at the start of the trial I would hit a survivor. It actually happened lol
---
Approximately 472
---
Did you kill them? Or were you a survivor?
---
Shhhhhh
---
I know
---
Why didn't you use ds in your first opportunity? The gate was at 99% and you were right next to it, plus you had Dead Hard, so you wouldn't need to get through all this pressure.
---
Every time i play survivor i'd like to play david, but then remember how bulky he moves, takes up the whole screen and sounds like a broken train half the time.
---
So i suspect most people that play david are either newish and level him for the perks, or are meming as shirtless david. Both does not give top shelf gameplay.
---
It's really not a killer circle jerk, people call out the bullshit on both sides. It just so happens that survivors (4/5 people in the match) get shat on a bit more.
---
HoD would be fun but it was way too early to be released. They should have waited a little longer and worked on it.
---
Killer main.
---
First off, if they were able to A) Save their DS for the end because you didn't kill them prior, B) go down next to an open exit gate and C) the other survivors were pressuring you that you *had* to hook him next to that gate, that's you getting outplayed. 
---
If you were able to hook two other people and catch the first person again, DS was probably close to timing out. You could have easily slugged him and gone looking for the last guy, or just slugged him and waited for DS to fully time out. There are counters to DS now.
---
DS isn't a problem. It used to be, but it's not now, simply because you can play around it. Sure, "Free" escapes are a thing, but if that happens you can look back on the game and usually figure out where you went wrong that allowed that person to escape.
---
Edit: insta heal to full only applies to the healer not everyone
---
Git gud? Ok then perhaps a pro gamer like yourself can explain how he is meant to counter an endgame DS?
---
I don‚Äôt think you get how the hatch works. The hatch doesn‚Äôt spawn at the beginning of the game, it spawns when the number of gens done is more than the living player, and doesn‚Äôt automatically unlock until there is one player left.
---
Good! I‚Äôm so glad to see someone willing to listen :))!!
---
Let‚Äôs review.
---
* Cant see scratch marks
---
* Cant see blood
---
* Frenzy ending in any way triggers a 4 second stun
---
* Missing an attack ends Frenzy
---
* Hitting a survivor with deep wounds already applied ends frenzy instantly (even on accident)
---
* Cant use power until its gauge is fully recovered 
---
* Power Gauge takes 20 seconds to recover 
---
* Hitting a survivor normally depletes the power gauge
---
* Pallet vaulting takes 1.35 seconds 
---
* Window vaulting takes 1.1
---
* Frenzy can‚Äôt down
---
* You can‚Äôt break pallets
---
* you lose the ability to see auras after hitting a survivor
---
Yesterday I was streaming Spirit to show the game off to my friend and for some reason a Claudette threw the pallet and then hid in the basement (It didn't work).
---
Bill came rushing to save her while I was breaking the pallet she threw so I, obviously, went down to stop them. Then another Claudette came in. Long story short? We had a three man basement party and the last person escaped through the hatch, like they always do.
---
Me: I‚Äôm gonna run BL and step outside my exhaustion perk comfort zone! 
---
Entity: Shelter Woods and Torment Creek? Coming right up.
---
Imagine profile crawling lmao, cringe
---
When are the new characters live?
---
I put mine to M5 because of this very reason lol
---
Was that a KYF or just a killer who gave up from the match after being humiliated the whole game?
---
I'm running it on all my builds regardless, walking faster all be useful for leaving gens
---
We will nerf BBQ when y'all stop with Tea Bagging at the exit gates and blinding us whenever we enter any animation.
---
Very smart as I see
---
If you‚Äôre going to insult people, spell ladder correctly first.
---
[Hypocrisy jumps out yet again.](http://puu.sh/Ec7CN/7d1b21feeb.png)
---
Keep digging yourself a hole.
---
Thank you my dude!
---
I believe if the perk has actually longer timer but when another survivor gets hooked it will no longer be active. This way the perk will be an alright anti-tunnel perk as you hook another survivor means you're not always on the same guy 24/7
---
Well you can't win everytime
---
I just did this yesterday with Oinker. 
---
She lost. All 4 survivors escaped. That's what you get for having tunnel vision on one person even though there are 3 other players in the game. She couldn't even down me once.
---
Killer main. DS is perfectly fine as it is. It's a strong defensive tool that can be significant, but is far from broken.
---
Again, you're setting it up with a situation where you made a shit decision, hooking someone next to an open gate. There's ALWAYS a better hook than that.
---
You'll also note the sheer number of additions to the game that discourage tunneling, or actively reward not doing it. If you still think that's "playing like I am supposed to," you're braindead.
---
why do you insiste on the anti tunnel part ?
---
Yea DS counter tunneling but who said it shouldn't work as well in other situations ?
---
DS prevents you from being hooked 60s after having being unhooked that's it. Nothing less nothing more.
---
Imagine ignoring context lmao, cringe
---
Doc actually does have a pretty strong kit, baseline he finds survivors super easily and he shuts down loops like no one's business. For all intents and purposes, he's a Nurse without the stupid amount of speed......
---
Having said that, he's also hard as hell to play to his full potential. You can shock people at pallets/windows to get them stuck and then swap to Punishment to smack them, but if you're timing is even slightly off the Survivor is going to get away. You have to actually animation cancel the shock, so you might possibly start swapping before you even throw it out there.
---
Doctor is hella strong, but by the time you put in the effort to actually get him there you could have easily become a god-tier Freddy or Spirit instead of an OK-ish Doctor.
---
Oh! Yeah, thoes definitely don't work with shock too well :c
---
What?
---
Yes but my point was that most of these I've encountered (and assumed for this one) give such a ridiculous ability with little to no downside
---
And het keeps putting his vines everwhere
---
Also happens on PC.
---
But I'm pretty sure their ping was red all the time since we were from different countries.
---
I mean, it‚Äôs also fun to 4K with bubba vs rank 20s
---
Ya i got 20 of the damn things
---
You are right, it didn‚Äôt have anything to do with the matchmaking issue. It had to do with me posting an end game salty chat message. The problem was saying it got deleted for oversaturated content, while all other end game messages, and or matchmaking screenshots, or typical looping videos, stay up constantly. 
---
The calling out post was just stating y‚Äôall don‚Äôt heavily enforce rules, and it almost looks wishy washy.
---
I must have used the wrong link to message y‚Äôall so that is my bad, so I will reach out again when I charge my phone. Thanks for the response to this though, and I am looking forward to seeing what happens to future matchmaking posts.
---
He could use a tune up, theres no reason to patrol in treatment once people are at tier 2. Hes overall just muddied up because of the form changes. He would be a lot better if calm was implemented into his base kit and his form change was faster.
---
Wow, a not compressed heartbeat Wraith? What a daring Killer
---
Meg‚Äôs cosmetic sucks.
---
His add-ons specifically say that in order to test his subjects to their fullest, he must administer the tests on himself.
---
Either that or it was one of his cosmetics. But that's definitely in there.
---
That's just shitty Halloween skins.
---
No way that literally happend to me. That‚Äôs really sad
---
Yeah, Wraith always does try to look his best for the Nurse.
---
Yes.
---
BING. BONG.
---
I haven't thrown my controller since I was a kid which was over 15 years ago but this game just triggers something in me and makes me rage so hard that I've broken a couple controllers lol but at the same time it's so fun. This is literally the only game that makes me rage anywhere remotely close to that bad.
---
Right after MoM was added, I got a 4 man squad all running it, balanced landing and DS on Haddonfield. I was trying the totem defender Spirit for the first time so I really deserved it, I also fucked up early and TotH died fast, along with everything else.
---
I only got a few hooks through the match before the gates were powered, but right after they opened one I got someone in the basement right next to an open gate.
---
Somehow they all got cocky, tried to loop me around the Myers' house and fucked up and it turned into a 4k.
---
I don't use instagram that much so, yeah... I remember seeing this post long ago
---
This is fucking funny to read.
---
1. Look at for example fifa, Madden, counter Strike and so on. They all die this and did good.
---
2. Designing a game with their knowlege now will be comparatively easier. Look at deathgarden.
---
3. Idk. Probably about 30‚Ç¨? Maybe 40?
---
4. DLCs would be rereleased for the same pricetag. New game, new dlcs just how its always been(i am not saying this is Good Practice but common)
---
5. You know that the worst Killer on the worst map has a 53% winrate (at least 2 Kills?) I wouldnt call this a bully Simulator if youre more likely to die than to survive.
---
Funny how you're calling them kids when you're on here acting like a toddler throwing a temper tantrum.
---
The problem is that Sabo is one of those perks that are super hard to balance right. kind of like MoM.
---
Pre nerf Sabo was way too powerful as it perma sabod hooks forcing the killers to slug or to always run IH and agi to get to the basement.
---
I think the current version while a lot weaker compared to it's counterpart can be pretty strong with the 99% strat.
---
That's why I want an addon that lets hatchets pass through walls, at the cost of losing a hatchet or two

In the right hands with someone who knows how to curve and the charge time addons he is.

He is all over the map, has an instant down, can spam his power without cool down or loosing track of survivors (no invisible survivors, can still see scratch marks and blood, no vision impairment, no real detriment to missing in a chase) and can hit around corners with curving. The Devs would never make another Billy or Nurse today. 
---
Spirit is about the closest they have made, but they even gave her a cool down and took away survivor visibility.

you think THAT'S bad? the devs don't care about bugs enough, I'm stuck on an error that refuses to EVER update my rank, making me stuck at 20

... use only pink/purple offerings/addons/items.
---
You're either a survivor main or have only started playing recently.
---
The hooks did not always respawn, there used to be a time when they would stay destroyed.
---
You know what happened? Sabo was so much of a meta perk that it was pretty much a permanent ability for Survivors. Literally every game started and by 4-5 minutes in every single hook on the map was gone and the killer had to slug or try to get them to the basement. 
---
(which without Agitation and Iron Hand was borderline impossible as survivors would always run to the corners to be downed.)
---
You're an idiot, if you think ds is op you're actually an idiot. And i guarantee you're a killer main who sucks at playing killer, get over it cry baby nobody agrees with you
---
Which is ironic, because the same people who complain that sabo is weak and they want the old sabo back, are the same people who complained over and over that slugging killers are toxic for the game.
---
A. That would be stupidly over powered.
---
B. That physically makes no sense.
---
No, Billy is easy mode. 
---
High mobility. Quick recovery from missing an attack or hitting into something. Easy to accidentally down someone.

You have to know what you are doing to be good with Leatherface.

I do look up because for me it feels safer than looking down where your eyesight is ‚Äúcloser‚Äù to the survivors. Not sure if closer is the right word but eh.
---
What if both is Michael?
---
I‚Äôm something of a raimi fan myself
---
I misunderstood because of who you replied to. I thought you were saying ‚Äúthey do‚Äù to the guy suggesting they should limit the number of pink addons to use
---
This is a bit op
---
This is honestly the easiest daily. Bring a brown toolbox and go for the first two hooks you see.
---
and yeah, but they said it's going to take a while to do so. and they even said you get notified when they start working on destroying it. but it still is in the air. I guess i just have high hopes.
---
Not sure how the creeper would work tbh. The only two powers i can really think of are either,
---
A. Transform into a scarecrow which removes your stain and terror radius, and you can ambush survivors who come close.
---
or 
---
B. Activate your power to leap into the sky and then swoop down and grab a survivor.
---
But there are two problems, The problem with A. is that it's an incredibally boring playstyle and easily countered because survivors would just avoid any and all scarecrows.
---
and B. is fundamentally flawed because it would be like pre nerf legion on crack, you would negate any and all defense. (plus you would be gypped on indoor maps.)

Nice one! Picked up some dlc I was missing

Some of my luckiest plays have been around the basement. Same thing, late game, falling for some bs loops til most gens are done then get a down close enough to hook em in the basement, some goofs think they are solid snake and ends up a 4 k ez gg
---
You right. But in scary movie many really disgusting moments. Like in movie 43, it was awful for me.
---
But society give me cons only because I wrote scary movie worse FOR ME. Facepalm.
---
That's why killers want her because they know they can't have such a sweet innocent person like feng
---
Lol it's def not op my dude. There's plenty of ways to play around DS including slugging til timer runs out, avoiding that survivor and chasing the others so decisive becomes useless, use Rancor so ppl is scared to use it or to punish the one who does. It only lasts one minute, I mean it's nothing compared to some of these other perks out here. Also u coulda hooked the survivor on a hook farther away from the gate, they are close enough together to where it's not impossible to pass up the closest one and at least one other before getting to a third hook. DS is simply a perk to give survivors a fighting chance. They get unhooked and it gives them plenty of time to get away and TRY to heal (unless they get tunneling to hell and back)
---
hard to tell without the other Sounds/Images. Whats happening when you hear that?

just scratch your nose with the right hand then

Most people, including myself, look up. Not sure how much of a difference it makes but it just feels better than looking down.

You don‚Äôt actually need to look that far away to avoid it, I believe it‚Äôs based on where the center of the killer‚Äôs screen is positioned.

I despise TTV ppl.. they trying to advertise their streams then u go and they are either really toxic (not as in good looper kind) but tbag, get downed, d/c, farm their team kinds. That or just really obnoxious trash talkers.

1 Mill (cap) + 3 dailies saved up + 6k ira shards can get you to around 46-47 if you're super careful in what you take in the blood web.

If that was the case, you‚Äôd think it‚Äôd be a lot faster for survivors to destroy totems, but it takes a little bit. They‚Äôre probably bound by some weird magic, especially the Hex totems.

Thana yes, Sloppy not even close.

I mean, fair, but also I was specifically basing this off my personal experience, and HG did exactly *nothing* to stop me from touching totems. When HG was fresh and new everyone I play with was like "Oh look, it's an Anti-Mac Perk! Guess you'll finally have to stop touching every totem!" and I literally went into it telling everyone "I'm running Small Game and I still fully intend to touch every totem I find. I will not be apologizing if I trigger HG. You knew what this was when you invited me to a SWiF."

Thanks man, good analogy

Don‚Äôt forget that it makes him fat and slow to have the tombstone. Use Play With Your Food to alleviate that. Ruin and even hook them a few times to spook them off gens. Pretty sure I used dying light too.
---
I had a game where I instantly noticed one survivor was throwing every pallet super early, and I had brutal strength... so I chased them for about 2 minutes and broke almost every pallet on the map, it was easy from there
---
Ah, its one of the ambient Sounds. IIRC its suffocation pit
---
~~Haha, an early death.  I get it.~~

Definitely heard it outside the basement

Yeah I use play with your food and ruin

Wraith is honestly more fun to play as and play against although he does need a buff

Thank god on console I can hold the R1 button with one hand and use my pinky or face to hit the L1 for skill checks.

The idea is interesting but perk 1 is just a worse enduring. Enduring III has a 50% stun reduction across the board.
---
Username checks out.
---
Also why the fuck doesn't the PTB just operate on a Kill Your Friends-esque mechanic where everyone just has access to all the perks? Really. :|
---
The reason it takes so long to find a game is because more people are playing Killer relative to Survivor, so it takes a few minutes for you to be given priority.
---
More people play Killer because Killer gets a lot more blood points than Survivor and this game is grindy as fuck.
---
Survivors don't really understand that strong survivor perks get run 4x in a game, which is why their perks are generally weaker; a lot of bad Survivors think the game is supposed to be 1 v 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, when it's in reality 1v4. Those bad survivors don't understand that it's generally a bad thing for you to actively try to get chased by the Killer.

Thanks, just got dodged twice and needed to rant, hence the flair
---
This is basically why I think Inner Strength is massively overrated. You basically only have 5 charges of the perk, and your teammates can take those charges from you.
---
I think that on a coordinated team that knows you have the perk it's a good choice. But on its own you'll at most get two uses out of it while your teammates take the rest of the totems.
---
Oof I just love it
---
Gonna suck for team mates using that perk because I start cleansing totems in the start of the game.
---
I like hooking near gate, it gets easy downs pretty often but ds and deliverance can work well against that strategy.

Is this for real?! Cuz I'm a Kate main and this looks badass!

I say look up, i didnt evem know looking down protected you from flashlights, so for me personally I'm not gonna try and see if it's more effective
---
Well I firmly believe that if it's possible for someone to get to rank one and get a 2-3k by playing normally especially without perks like Ruin, BBQ, NoED than ANYONE no matter the rank or skill level can get a 3-4k while USING perks like that without tunneling and camping. Most ppl use those "viable strategies" just to troll and be dicks anyway. And yes it is smart to go after a weak target HOWEVER it's also smart to have multiple targets weakened as well, that results in more ppl off gens which results in more time for the killer to chase survivors and get more kills/bloodpoints. It's honestly not hard.
---
On topic of the title: Honestly Leatherface would be pretty high tier if not for the existence of Hillbilly. Even with his bugs he'd still probably be played for the instadown, but combining his bugs and the fact that Billy is better in every way pretty much no one plays Bubba.
---
I'd still argue that vaulting hurts him slightly less than other M1 killers, so that's still an upside when comparing him to the others (also, there's a perk for almost everything by now, Bamboozle works with the Frenzy). 
---
I'll be looking forward to seeing your video, I'd have a couple ideas myself but I doubt they'll put any time into Legion in the next 2 years sadly.
---
I‚Äôm buying biker Kate. About time she gets a new legit skin. That ‚Äúawards night‚Äù one is trash

I wasn‚Äôt rude until you started being rude, you do realize that? And, I hate to quote myself, since it‚Äôs visible to everyone, including you, but I‚Äôll paraphrase it right here for you to reread, since I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not going to be exact. 
---
‚ÄúHis M2 doesn‚Äôt significantly affect a chase because simply slugging them gets you the result you were looking for anyway, since M2 usually just wastes time on charge and switch, and all you‚Äôre getting is a hit anyway, but with extra steps. You could‚Äôve just hit them, if you were in range to M2 in the first place.‚Äù
---
The only thing I mentioned that changes that formula, is his add ons, and the really high tier ones are usually the only ones worth it. If you‚Äôll also note, this is all subjective. I feel hitting them with a zap is a waste of time because in my experience, it is. So I‚Äôll repeat another thing I‚Äôve said, getting two thwacks with him is statistically quicker, than building any amount of charge on them, or using your ability at all. That‚Äôs because his ability replaces his weapon temporarily, and in transition, slows your movement speed, and in charge, slows your movement speed. I‚Äôve also not disagreed that his ability does do something in a chase, it does, but what it does, is so negligible, that you‚Äôre better off hitting them. Also subjective, since I‚Äôm 100% certain you disagree. I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm bother to explain this all again, since you‚Äôll likely just say something asinine, claim I‚Äôm the rude one, act like my English is flawed, and be a child about it overall. I‚Äôm done here, goodnight.

Or just a killer who was farming? Once I have all 4 stacks of chili I have no real need to actually win. The BP difference for me winning is minimal by comparison of letting all 4 walk out. They get 20k bp for leaving the game (5k each) and I lose like what? 5k?

And it breaks the immersion, in the saw series amanda needs to find a key to disable and escape the RBT, and now the survivors can just leave and live with it on their head forever
---
Cg fromWu Assassins anyone?
---
He came back, unfortunately. He still bullies the shit out of killers with glitches and exploits
---
Imagine if those two crybabies hasn't dcd. NOED may not have even popped.
---
They talked out of their ass confidently, i don't think it's the worst thing
---
In your reply to comment you said ‚ÄúSmart no‚Äù but here you say ‚Äúit is smart to go after a weak target‚Äù??? What are you even saying lol.
---
Anyway, if your point is that there are many viable strategies out there and they don‚Äôt need to tunnel, then my counter is that people can play however they like lol.
---
Don‚Äôt be upset just because they don‚Äôt play in a way YOU like.
---
&gt;&gt;Most ppl use those ‚Äúviable strategies‚Äù just to troll and be dicks anyway.
---
Just lol if you actually think this way.
---
we've been waiting for this one for a looong time.
---
Billy in the grand scheme of the game as a whole isn't overpowered, but compared to every other option he's way too strong. It's ridiculous that a Killer has an instadown, fast pallet break, and one of the strongest mobility abilities in the game.
---
There's a lot of things in this game that are "counterable" but still way too strong. I don't think they need immediate changes but they could use some light reworking.
---
On subject of Legion: Yeah they were overnerfed. Freddy all over again. Behavior is really bad at compensating for nerfs.
---
The term "megamind" was made for these people.  
---
I was getting my ass handed to me just trying to get the Plague's teachables by the purple flashlight goon squad. I had them all broken but they weren't cleansing themselves at any point so I only had one pool from my add-on.  
---
I opened the Exit Gate myself to draw them in and caught out a Dwight, stuck him on the hook next to my pool and waited.  
---
Sure enough, the goons came and tried to free him. I chugged my noxious death water, got them both with a Corrupt Purge spray (downed because they were broken) and slowly hooked them both once the Dwight died.   
---
The post-game chat was not kind to me.
---
r/pokemon .....
---
Im sorry my phone has auto shift üëÄ  also im new on here hi
---
An ultra rare that isn‚Äôt annoying or that doesn‚Äôt change the killer power entirely is useless. Thats what they should be anyway, either providing a new playstyle or be op
---
Yeah I‚Äôm hoping the hair looks better in game.
---
Billy has more than good map pressure. He is the king of map pressure. (Nurse as the better queen). 
---
You haven‚Äôt gone against a billy that can curve, then, if you think LoS is that great. That first split second in a chainsaw, Billy can make a 90 degree turn around a corner and take down people in loops. You can LoS a spirit just as much, even more so because she can‚Äôt see you when using her power. 
---
Billy can 1 hit down ALWAYS. Spirit can‚Äôt. 
---
Billy also has 115% speed, so he can M1 if he  needs to. After using her power, Spirit is a 110% loopable killer for 20-30 seconds. 
---
Billy doesn‚Äôt need a cool down to use his power as he is constantly able to spam it. 
---
Spirit is a guessing game for survivors. That‚Äôs about it. 
---
Billy is much better than Spirit. No question.
---
* Legion
---
* mid-tier
---
* nobody's complaining about (their) strength
---
Hey can you tell me where I can get a scholarship for clown college?
---
I don't understand why they made Legion unable to see scratch marks or blood stains when they removed moonwalking. Being able to see scratch marks and blood stains was specifically a problem because of moonwalking, and they removed moonwalking. Yet they also removed the ability to see scratch marks and blood stains.
---
I don't understand why they made Legion unable to use their power when it's not fully charged when they removed multi-stab kills. Being able to use your power when it wasn't fully charged was specifically a problem because of multi-stab kill, and they removed multi-stab kill. Yet they also removed the ability to use your power when it's not fully charged.
---
I don't understand why they made Legion vault slower when they removed multi-stab kill. Being able to vault fast was specifically a problem because of multi-stab kill, and they removed multi-stab kill. Yet they also removed the ability to vault as fast.
---
I don't understand why they made Legion run slower when they made the self stun longer. Being able to run faster was specifically a problem because of short stun time, and they extended the stun time. Yet they also removed the ability to run as fast.
---
&gt;I don't understand why they made Legion unable to (x) when they removed (y). Being able to (x) was specifically a problem because of (y), and they removed (y). Yet they also removed the ability to (x).
---
&gt;It's funny how many of Legion's problems can be described with this sentence.
---
I know right! It‚Äôs finally time.
---
Am I tbe only one...  
---
With over 7 billion people, probably not.
---
I lost faith in this community ages ago anyway.
---
I mean shes like 8ft tall so
---
I think the only time I remember him killing someone with a gun in the movies is when he was holding a shot gun and impaled a person to the wall with it.
---
Happy to help!
---
Meanwhile Billy *breaking* pallets with his power as well as intadowning along with his huge mobility boost: lol this is fine.
---
I mean people are gonna try to counter inner strength with Iron Maiden so when the dlc comes out be prepared
---
Dun ddun dun dun dunn dun doo doo do do do do STRANGER THINGS
---
How does that even work? At how many moves does the entity chew up the entire bloodweb?
---
I got 4 huntresses over ~2 hours the other day and 3 of them had iri head
---
One of the trappers hooked melee weapons. Imo it's the meanest looking thing he has
---
Doesn't have anti-loop just has a fast pallet break and an instadown 4head.
---
I've never seen your case, I don't think its that common
---
And into shirtless Myers arms xD
---
In the other comment I said "smart, no" to tunneling. However u never technically said tunneling in ur comment. U just said injured survivor so yea I said wut I said to u.
---
And yes ppl can play the way they like, does it mean it's always the smart way, no. Does it mean it's the logical or fun way, no. Does it mean it's fun for both sides or one? Well that depends on playstyle. 
---
And it's not that it's a way I like it's simply because it takes the gaming experience for the person who is going through the tunneling and camping since all they can really do is sit on hook or get downed as soon as they get unhooked. Nobody would like that and I'm sure if u were in the same shoes u would feel the same way lol. Try playing survivor a little more pal u will surely understand how it feel. I have played killer and I don't tunnel or camp simply because ik how it feels and I myself am considerate enough to spare others the annoyance. 
---
And yes ppl do it just to troll xD, if ur on PS4 go to their profiles, u will see a lot of ppl say on their "About Me" quotes saying stuff like "Tired of survivors crap, don't blame me for getting camped" or something along those lines. Or even send u a message trying to "play the killer role" which I appreciate the role play aspect but then continue to tunnel, camp and Mori u in game. U really need to open ur eyes if u think ppl don't do it to troll or be dicks. If ur on PC (if u can even do this, idk if u can) go see if they have an account about me quote like PS4 and see if says anything of the sort. Or u can usually tell by end game chat if they just troll the survivors saying "gg ez" after camping/slugging all game
---
Tunneler the killer
---
I‚Äôm tired of whenever people see something new they call hacks, like I run into purple rank who thought I was speed hacking because I used windstorm and play with your food on wraith to make him speedy boi
---
Survivors when no Spirit / Nurse / Hillbilly - LOL GG EZ GET REKT BABY KILLER HOW DO I TURN UP AI DIFFICULTY UNINSTALL FAG WE'RE SO GOOD üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Survivors when Spirit / Nurse / Hillbilly - OMG WHY ALWAYS SPIRIT / NURSE / BILLY SO OP BHVR SO KILLER SIDED FIX THIS SHITTY GAME üò°üò°üò°üò°
---
Not Jane Romero / 10
---
I think they dismissed those offerings long time ago.
---
Its been like this since they messed with match making.  A few patches ago it would go right to a lobby and populate quickly.  The new system sucks. I dont get any more balanced matches than before I just have to wait 5 min longer for no reason.
---
Or he's smart since Nurse can't blink while you shine a light on her

Pigs rise up

This game makes for some pretty awesome memories haha
---
An original idea? This is a change from the normal turn into a survivor killer we always see
---
Nah man, she has frankies
---
I backed the game and was pretty disappointed. It felt kinda lackluster imo. Didn't really care much for the progression system. Some games I won by doing absolutely nothing. The Escape mode, I think it's called. I quit the game before they fixed the Last Man Standing
---
Sure does
---
*stress 99.99%*
---
And lightborn xD
---
Yah it‚Äôs the app so I could get the screenshot faster
---
What makes you say that?
---
what
---
Okay, well yoi basically just agreed with me on map pressure
---
I have, his curves are still bad, 90 degrees needs turning addons and is still wide as fuck, ypu can literally go behind a barrel and laugh. And yew, you can LoS a spirit, if you even want to call ot that, the problem is that her power is soundbased and scratch mark based, along with some predictions, so LoSing doesn't work
---
Spirit doesn't need 115,if she's already at you, she can just hit you, and either win a loop after, or phase again, cooldown isn't that long
---
1 hit down doesn't matter if you can't get it off, spirit doesn't need it to compete anyways.
---
Billy needs a lot more conditions to get a hit with his power, his power is basically good map presence with a chance to instadown, spirit can find and hit survivors and then instantly end loops, billy can't, so he just gets looped for days in high ranks, or even in lower ranks if he's too chainsaw greedy
---
There's so much more to spirit than that, and any red rank player would disagree with you, spirit is widely acknowledged as the second best killer behind nurse.
---
Damn she's hot.
---
Ok, thanks
---
im just imagining him getting a skillcheck and SLAMMING the controller into his chin to hit the skillcheck
---
Damn, dead by daylight has 7 billion players?
---
I wholeheartedly agree there are so many dock bags with ttv in their name. But there's also some really nice dudes just trying to advertise their stream.
---
Frames are not the best on console, and it's kinda hard to turn around quickly. The sensitivity, even at 100%, is not as fast as in the pc so she kinda lacks on console. But good nurse on console exist and when you go against one of them, oh damn, it's gonna be a quick match.
---
If poor piggy stops getting nerfed every day it'd be a good DLC
---
Spirit with prayer beads and a full hex build and thrill of the hunt...looks like they are never getting a totem to heal themself lol
---
Are you Feng with a mask by chance lol? I don't target based on skins but I have noticed most do fit stereotypes, Claudettes are usually the last person I see, kate and feng are in your face and trying to loop you, David, ash and Bill are usually altruistic with borrowed time. Quentin is just annoying as fuck for no good reason. If you are a pain in the ass and I have my choice of hookers, I'll pick you, if not its luck of the draw.
---
You know, like ghost hatchets.
---
My friend has it in his name but he's 15yrs old and he barely streams. I stream sometimes buuuut I don't have TTV in my name xD. I don't want moried tho
---
Yeah, kind of actually
---
Maybe you hit space after the bar was past the thing so it counted as just letting it pass?
---
It‚Äôs a lot harder tho  lol ive only met one good nurse on console my friend mains nurse at rank one..I try nurse it‚Äôs a mixed bag but at around rank 7 is where I struggle with nurse I wish she was easier on console because her ability seems so fun
---
I really like the deck of cards idea
---
especially when they‚Äôre d10 üòî
---
Just tap the attack button whike they're vaulting AND while they're injured. It won't work if they're healthy.
---
just slug them. It doesn't even need to be for a minute. Slug them for as long as you want so survivors waste more time
---
I pretty much hit it on the last pixel of the white square
---
So you want a more overpowered ghostface?
---
No, it should always be the same as your primary attack button.
---
W
---
What
---
How close do I have to be?
---
Masked Feng is not sweet or innocent.
---
I do that but it only hits thrm
---
When the blood web improvments are gonna be live? I just want it so bad...
---
He most definitely isn't OP. I've played against the best Billy's in the game and there are always ways to counter them. You can't loop them for ages but you can do it for long enough so that your teammates can do gens
---
Grabs are broken right now. It likes to give you the animation for like 1 second and then go back and swing instead as of right now. So I would say just tap it when close and they're vaulting but it is broken so good luck with that.
---
Your arguments are full of assumptions, generalisations and logic gaps. Let me address some of them.
---
&gt;&gt; try playing survivor a little more
---
I‚Äôm a Survivor main, I know what it‚Äôs like to be tunnelled. Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it‚Äôs a viable strategy.
---
&gt;&gt;I myself am considerate enough to spare others the annoyance
---
You want to be a considerate Killer, good for you. Don‚Äôt expect others to be the same.
---
&gt;&gt;ppl do it just to troll
---
That some people do it just to troll, I don‚Äôt doubt. But saying everybody who uses a viable strat is trolling and being a dick is grossly inaccurate.
---
Tl;dr - There are lots of different people out there. Just because some don‚Äôt follow your beliefs doesn‚Äôt make them dicks.
---
Quick question do you have legacy
---
The perk stays activated until you use it, so you can cleanse a totem early on and save the heal for later on
---
Before hatch closing/EGC was a thing (Around January and before Legion) I managed to down a Survivor just far enough away from the hatch that I could mori them to unlock my Adept Spirit.
---
that‚Äôs called iron will and calm spirit
---
üëçüëçüëçWhat bing bong? SMASH! Best boy.

Arriving on the 9 according to dbdleaks on twitter. Exciting times.

so because i didnt know a game and this chain of comments dosent mention said game by name im a walnut wow mate must really be cloudy up there on that horse

Curving isn't affected by addons

Yeah I have the Xbox elite controller and just mapped a paddle to my right middle finger so I can do gens one handed
---
I saw it say it was arriving on the 04/09/2019.

He has turning addons for his chainsaw, i even went and double checked on the wiki

https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Spiked_Boots

I mean, it's absolutely trash, son.
---
Well prestiging isn't obligatory...
---
Seriously? I run into farmers like 1 in 20 matches probably.
---
I can see where you‚Äôre coming from but you could be P3 50 and still not have the same perks/ add ons you had back at level 50. But with the new bloodweb change it‚Äôll hopefully be a lot better perk wise
---
Just save up bp before you do it.
---
Ok first off u never said that u played survivor so don't blame me for not knowing. 
---
Secondly ik it's a viable strategy but still dumb since they still get gen rushed, looped and don't get many bloodpoints.
---
Thirdly I don't expect them to, tbh nowadays I EXPECT to be tunneled and camped simply cause most killers DO, do those strategies lately and it's getting old really quick.
---
Fourth I never said EVERYONE does it to troll, but MOST players who do simply do. That or are just bad at killer. No in between.
---
And that last comment is just idiotic because that's not how I see it in the slightest. That's just how ur interpreting it to make me look bad.
---
Wow I found this on popular, nice job
---
Damn, Trapper lost a lot of weight in this pic, good for him c:
---
I don‚Äôt always get face camped, but when I do, it‚Äôs REUGHUHEHHUGHEUHEGGGHUHEHUHUHEGHUH
---
It will run like ass sorry to say. A regular PS4 or Xbox FPS for killer are horrible most of the time. I just can't take the switch or mobile versions serious.
---
Do they have to be injured?
---
I hate to say it, I often go for the hooked survivor because I don't want the rescuer to power up Deliverance.
---
Its also easier to track an injured survivor because you can hear them, so most of the time as I'm following the trails from the hook, I find the unhooked survivor first. I use Iron Will as a survivor to counter this.
---
When I play survive w friends, we have a rule that we work gens as long as possible while someone is hooked, and try to rescue right before the struggle starts. Finishing a gen tends to get the killer away from the hook.
---
for vault grabs, yes
---
Drop kick sounds amazing for anti tunneling in a squad
---
If you unhook you can dropkick the killer and save the other survivor
---
I bought the game 1 hour after release and got a refund after about 90 minutes of playing. It would be a pretty cool game if they thought it out more but like you said, there were games where I stayed the hole time in a bin and won and there were games where I became the killer 3 times and lost. I bought some auric cells for dbd and bought Plague and Jane.
---
I dunno it does that shit to me for everything except lockers
---
They should make his movement speed faster while he‚Äôs invisible
---
Ohhh gotcha, sorry.
---
Someone give these people all platinum
---
Don't you think this is OP af lmao
---
I thought shadowborn was a must on nurse? Since every nurse player runs it?
---
I used to hate it too, but i found at higher ranks, the killers dont camp when there are 3 or 4 alive. The game gets more fun at higher tiers, just stick it out.
---
He's in the back
---
If I'm not mistaken tunneling is when you go after one person until their dead, not until they're down.
---
That just gave me a thought, wouldn't it be cool if there were an addon with which you could stalk gens, while they are being worked on and when you kick them they are regressed based on how long you were peeping?
---
Doctor needs a slight buff, lets bump him up from D to C tier
---
What does Noed stand for? I‚Äôve seen it everywhere on this sub
---
I would become a survivor main so fast
---
That's weird. I've never had trouble with vault grabs. Are you trying to vault grab people while they're uninjured?
---
With her hit boxes shes not really that tough to learn. Nowhere near what it takes to play nurse.
---
It would also reduce the number of hatchets you get.
---
Yh I just had it happen literally right now. I go on Reddit between rounds and it literally just happened last round.

Way too strong. No escape from that
---
I'm still trying to decide if I wanna get it. On one hand, I do not want to go through the grind again. And I don't want to pay $40 for a lesser version of a game I already have. And playing killer on it will be an unbearable nightmare.
---
But having a handheld DBD would just be *nice*
---
but ruin is too strong to pass up. it can be shadowborn or nurses but i‚Äôd choose shadow personally
---
Best new update since the DS nerf. Will revitalize my want to play this game.
---
Was this on PC on Coldwind?
---
Save up or play a different killer.
---
Last night, I managed somehow to sneak past the killer I thought for sure had seen me, trying to get to the survivor in the basement. Terror radius subsided, I ran into the shack and then down those stairs, turned the corner, and Adam and I pretty much made full eye contact as he threw himself off the hook. I was cheesed, cuz the killer had NOED and I could have been opening the door instead
---
It's more of a preference than a must. I would just go ruin instead. Unless you really like the extra fov.
---
No One Escapes Death - instadown perk at the end when the gen‚Äôs have all been completed
---
You can only grab injured survivors off vaults
---
#1 That‚Äôs why you shouldn‚Äôt jump to conclusions. Your wrong assumptions undermine the rest of your arguments, because it shows you don‚Äôt even fact check before you say something.
---
#2 Just because a strategy has a counter doesn‚Äôt make it less viable or ‚Äúdumb‚Äù.
---
#4 I corrected my statement. Still a generalisation.
---
#5 That‚Äôs how you‚Äôre behaving. ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt play in a way I like even though it works. They are toxic and annoying dicks.‚Äù
---
Sounds like a job for Detective Tapp.
---
*Oh wait*
---
DBD original killers aren't really anything special, how about Netflix makes their own shorts and keeps all the money for themselves?
---
He was injured. Unless being broken by plague doesn't count as injured
---
I remember one time there was a toxic pink haired nea getting cocky at the exit gates and I was just messing around making oink noises because I was fed up, I managed to sneakily pull off a surprise attack and downed, hooked and sacrificed the nea as her swf buddies ran off but that was only because of noed and now I can‚Äôt even do that
---
Don't know what to tell you then. All I can think is that you have a bad connection consistently
---
Yes indeedy - though the survs don‚Äôt know that until someone gets hit
---
poor babey got lost in the woods :(
---
at the time of commenting not a single comment mentioned it by name stop trying to justify insulting someone for not knowing something
---
Should also put that it‚Äôs Totem based - so many survs go around and destory as many totems as they can see to avoid it!
---
Thicc nea looks great
---
Hide or Die
---
Summer technically ends September 23rd. Which is right after the chapter release. We're all expecting to get them with the chapter.
---
Up or a wall
---
this is incredibly lame lmao is that the song from the GameCube sonic the hedgehog game?
---
Two weeks from now, when the chapter releases.
---
Probably just confirmation bias honestly. I don't think most people go out of their way to kill any specific Survivor, unless it's maybe a Leatherface looking to get their faces.
---
I am actually. What sucks is Im not a new player, just new survivor and im running into these rank 20 killers with skills they shouldn't have. I ran into a rank 15 nurse that could precisely blink to anyone's location at any time. I never saw her miss a blink. As a killer, all im doing is getting paired against the red ranks
---
OP is talking about solo. Borrowed is good for solo too, though.
---
I was downed right before it would go off lol
---
Turn on mouse lock ;)
---
Damn boy
---
*laughs in falltraps*
---
Both nurse and
---
One of the worst things that ever happened to me while playing killer was when I was transporting a survivor to a hook and I had to walk a good distance because I had already sacrificed two survivors in that area. They got their 30 percent DS, escaped my grasp, and immediately got Adrenaline
---
Also make him slow, like 107% or 110% speed
---
You deserve a F üò™
---
I run BBQ, Ruin, Enduring and then Whispers or Brutal Strength. Addons I've found to be the best are Night Shroud cooldown reduction and Marked duration increase. Or Ghostface Caught on Tape because that addon is beyond insane.
---
Yep. Misread. Now I'm excited as well! Been leveling kate since I saw this announcement.
---
What's wrong with BBQ?
---
are we still pretending that DS is only top counter tunneling?
---
PC? Also I see you use iron maiden. Lots of the best Huntress players say it's not worth it. Doesn't save that much timem
---
Wow that makes her way cooler as a killer. I had never really played her inless I had a daily for her
---
**HEAVY YUROP BREATHING**
---
Yeah, I love her so much. I started playing about November last year but only got my account to level 8 before I got bored.  
---
Now the Plague is in the game I'm playing it constantly. She's so fantastic I love her so much.

Oh yes this is a good comment

1. Most of your arguments are subjective and not quantifiable (or if it is, you‚Äôre not showing the data). ‚ÄúFun‚Äù ‚Äúfair‚Äù ‚Äúgood‚Äù ‚Äúbad‚Äù ‚Äúmost‚Äù
---
Which is fine if you treated it as an opinion, but you talk as if you‚Äôre spouting facts.
---
Ok, please show me the data to prove your ‚Äúfacts‚Äù.
---
2. If you don‚Äôt care what other people say, why are we even having this conversation? Sorry, but if you intend for this to be a one-way dialogue where I‚Äôm supposed to be convinced by your arguments, you‚Äôre not doing a very good job of it.
---
3. You‚Äôre throwing out a lot of insults. Again, this does not help convince me that you‚Äôre right.
---
4. You‚Äôre denying what you said previously when all your previous comments are there for all to read.
---
Ok so let's say you have a 100% repair speed when you work on a generator alone. For every additional survivor working on that same generator, all survivors on that generator receive a repair speed penalty. So if you are working on a generator with one other person, each of you only work at 90% repair speed. This penalty increases with a growing amount of survivors working on the same generator. This amounts to a total of 180% of the solo repair speed. Of course this is 80% faster than working seperately and can be useful against things like Pop Goes The Weasel. However, if two survivors work on seperate generators, each of them are working at 100% repair speed which amounts to 200%.
---
In summary, stacking on generators ensure that the generator gets irrevertibly repaired and  can be good to relieve some killer pressure but in the long run, working on generators alone is more efficient.
---
Just using it as a meta perk aspect.
---
That could be my issue. I honestly don‚Äôt know how good it is. How do I check? (sorry I‚Äôm honestly shite at all this)
---
Make sure to teabag as it is how survivors say hello to eachother
---
you used to be able to crash the killers game using the flashlight macro but I think the worst you can do now is severely lag the game for the killer.
---
Try not to worry about ranks and farm as much bloodpoints as you can each match. Some solo matches are just doomed. Hardest part is knowing what you can expect of your team. I run kindred as survivor and it usually helps.
---
Exactly, I ran into a trapper yesterday who was just walking around the map letting us gen rush not even attempting to chase. Idk if he was just letting us farm or if he was trying to derank but that happened. There's been so many killers lately that are actually skilled and higher than rank 15 and idk how to feel about it.
---
Nurse ignores pallet loops while huntress has to slowly loop around the pallet and predict a pallet throw or hope the walls are low enough to get a hit in. 
---
Nurse has map pressure while huntress moves slow as heck. Sure Huntress can toss hatchets across the map but things can get in the way.
---
Nurse doesn't have to waste time going to lockers to reload.
---
I'd say Huntress is harder but that's my 2 cents.
---
"Put you hands in the air if you a true playa"

That necc tho

I too came back last night after a several month hiatus, threw a few hundred thousand blood points on pig and had a nice build, got a 3 k, ran the fuck over by a SwF then a 4K in which no Gens got done due to ruin and I took my time eating that P3 Ashley alive for good measure. Overall my interest in the game has returned to say the least
---
Oneshot killer with lightborn is your friend against flashlight lobby. They will never stop trying and never stop dying.
---
I was up against a rank 15 ghost that killed a rank 8 Bill quite easily. Like he had him straight up trapped in a loop.

Its still rare, 1 in 20 since matches take lot of time, excluding the mis match time, like 20 minutes each.
---
I use them to give to mu friends who have a "escape with item" daily so they at least have a purpose
---
Oh thanks for the response didnt know this.
---
I knew about the wall
---
5k bold and noed prevention... If your bad at chases it doesn't hurt
---
Yeah you should feel good because huntress is the most skilled killer in the game without being overpowered as fuck. Unlike spirit who's overpowered af without taking any skill.
---
Me too!! Can‚Äôt wait ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
---
This is too relatable and I hate it
---
Its when something starts gaining momentum. Its like in old cartoons where a tiny snowball starts rolling down a hill and by the time it reaches the bottom, its a giant unstoppable force. With Hag, she starts gaining momentum when she gets that first hook. She can completely section of a portion of the map, guard her hook without being near, and completely shut down a safe loop. Plague is kind of the same way where when she gains momentum, there's no stopping her
---
Yea I for sure feel like its ppl purposefully deranking to bully and troll the new Stranger Things fans. Which I don't get cause if they chase ppl off and ruin sells won't dbd die down kinda like Friday the 13th did?
---
Wouldn‚Äôt mind if WGLF had an ability stacked on the BP gains. The ability in and of itself isn‚Äôt OP but the double bloodpoints to go along with what‚Äôs already a powerful perk is the problem for me.
---
I‚Äôm not saying the actual aura ability of BBQ is OP on its own though. I‚Äôm saying that ability is powerful enough on its own, wbu should it need a double BP again to go with it? That‚Äôs just flat out ridiculous. To do anything to the same effect it would take survivors two perks.
---
Any update on the rift?
---
 Should I stay or should I go? Should I stay or should I go now? Should I stay or should I go now? If I go there will be trouble. And if I stay there will be double.
---
I 100% agree with that but 99% of the playerbase is going to say Nurse and Billy, nothing else.

---
Exactly I think bubba is fun and works sometimes
---
I think they need to remove his different modes entirely. Give him a single mode where his TR is inflicting madness. He would move at his 115%, M1 for basic attacks and M2 for the shock therapy. The other change I feel they should give would be to remove the range addons, and make it so his shock therapy range is based on how long you hold M2 before releasing.
---
Doctor is about the 2nd weakest right now man :(
---
I just got the achievement a couple days ago.  Had a similar situation. Pull them out of the locker then drop them on the floor. They have to waste time recovering while you go hunt down the other survivors. If they are the last one then you just have to hope they accept their fate and stop locker jumping just to be a jerk.
---
I just play whatever i feel like and i always reach Red ranks and stay there. If you are a decent killer it doesn't matter who you play.
---
It was a joke
---
I see your a man of culture as well
---
It also makes your response much faster to have it on your mouse. Work one handed and never miss great skill checks, it's an all around benefit.
---
Honestly I'm more excited for this skin than PTB, mostly because I don't play on PTB at all so I'm gonna simply wait for the DLC.
---
Yeah i figured, still had to say it tho for others who read this
---
Anyone, if you're good you can make most killers work. The people who complain that "ugh you can only play nurse/spirit/bully in red ranks" are just too bad to play other killers.
---
Don't get me wrong, Nurse, Spirit, and Billy are top tier and will give you the best chance in red ranks, but literally most killers are completely viable
---
OOF dude you didn't even leave it a chance lol.
---
Poor Last Year... Set to fail since the start. I liked the Strangler and I suppose a
---
Bad example. Counting cards isnt illegal, casinos forbid it, not the government =P
---
I did it because I use to smoke and my ashtray was to the left of my keyboard and would take a drag during gens hahahahaha
---
Id say nurse, spirit, freddy, hag, huntress(only if you really know what you're doing), pig(usually, but can get bullied by anti stealth perks) plague (once again gotta know what you're doing)
---
Once you level a character to p3 level 50 you'll have a whole pile of ebony moris.
---
I usually save up bloodpoints before I prestige. With 1 million bloodpoints (the cap), you can level up to about 40 again if you spend wisely.
---
Can't wait for upcoming stealth killer buff
---
I've never heard about it. What is it?
---
I don't know what to be more impressed about 
---
The fact they named themselves that 
---
Or how the game perfectly put their names next to each other
---
Some millennial kids think they‚Äôre woke af cause they do shit like dislike milk. And not only do they not just drink milk but they think they‚Äôre better than people who do and make their whole deal about not drinking milk. Humans are becoming dumber weaker everyday.
---
It's not an uncommon comment, and your /s wasn't on there the first time, don't use your black magic to cover your mistakes.
---
You should just leave the community
---
Or come to the dark side (fyi, it'll eat your soul)
---
Depends which killer it is. If it‚Äôs a killer with no available red addons, you‚Äôll get a red Mori almost every bloodweb after 40, even more frequently at p 50
---
I tend to get cypress moris pretty frequently early on, ivory moris every now and then and ebony moris relatively infrequently, just keep leveling your bloodweb and you'll find them eventually
---
for whatever reason it‚Äôs not working for me but thank you still!
---
I tried PWYF on Bubba and didn't expected much, turns out that it really helped me. I didn't really "won" but O was playing with that perk on level 1. I wonder what I could do with it on level 3...
---
Illegal by the casino is what I meant fam. Like when someone is "tournament illegal"
---
It‚Äôs an older meme, sir, but it checks out.  I was about to upvote it.
---
I'm sorry? you think I edited the /s in or something?
---
so after all the chapters we still have 4v1 and 1 game mode. Dont get me wrong, Im happy how DBD developed and is growing constantly, also the new chapter looks really but I hope there will be more additions to other aspects of the game than only chapters and skins (some more curcial gameplay changes, core changes, game modes etc.)
---
Thank you so much for this... it is also scarily true to what will happen.
---
I'm gonna stop you right there, chief. It doesn't. No one is forcing anyone to do anything. Literally what even is your point?
---
Not going to lie,  that's actually a really damn good idea
---
Are they implementing the change where perks such as this is not happening, we‚Äôll make it, and resilience are already in the bloodweb?
---
Im mean we already have a sub sooo
---
WOOOWWW, bro, pls keep updating me, im so excited! good Job
---
I think huntress is pretty good, can mix-up a match and with the right perks can be pretty hard to beat
---
Yes yes, meme isnt mine but I meant that I drew it &lt;3
---
This is a trick question right?
---
We should get Shaggy as a survivor with Captain cutler as the killer, but to keep things from getting gruesome, Shaggy could be hung by his shirt and Cutler can have cartoony effects when he attacks, you can‚Äôt tell me that wouldn‚Äôt be awesome.
---
That's kinda crappy attitude to have tbh. I have easily repaired all 5 generators with just 2 people so to say that with 1 person quitting makes it unplayable is just completely inaccurate. Even if all 3 leave you can still find the hatch and escape.
---
I see less DCs the higher i go in rank (currently 5, and haven't had a rage quitter on my team in days).
---
What i usually do if a game seems unwinable due to DCs is do other stuff to get points, like bones and chests. And then run the killer around wothout feeling guilt for using every pallet on the map.
---
Sometimes that even leads to my remaining team surprising me and actually finish all the gens during that chase.
---
I'm asking for advice.
---
Iron Maiden + Haunted Grounds üòà
---
I play on console, and Nurse is one of my mains. I run Nurse's Calling, BBQ, Surveillance, and Pop Goes the Weasel. The Nurse benefits greatly from tracking perks, but you'll need something for gen management.
---
If you're not getting any hooks at the start, use Bitter Murmur instead of BBQ, and Ruin instead of Pop, but expect your Ruin to be broken fairly quickly unless it's well hidden.
---
Other tracking perks to try are Discordance or Infectious Fright. Survivors like to work together on gens against the Nurse, so both these perks can come in handy.
---
Another perk I used to use was Sloppy Butcher, which pairs well with Nurse's Calling, because it adds 8 seconds to the heal time, giving you more time to see someone.
---
Be prepared for a lot of teabagging and bodyblocking when you play Nurse on console. I don't get BMed much with other killers, but people love to BM me when I play Nurse until they realise I'm decent with her.
---
Good luck!
---
That's a healthy argument that really is a shining endorsement of your community bro
---
Chill lmao
---
 Wb Ghostface?
---
the happy demogorgon noises sold it lmao
---
That hair looks gross but the rest looks sweet.
---
That means you're green rank at max.
---
The only reason this game ever got this far is because people did make rules. Trust me if infinites were actually infinites I don't think you'd play this game for longer than a week, it's kinda easy to say "run infinites on me" when the game no longer has any bucko.
---
And yes even back in the day you had sweaty players like you who'd abuse every braindead broken thing in the game. But most people just wanted to ignore the broken shit and go back to the fair fun skillfull gameplay that apparantly you can't wrap your mind around why that would be more fun.
---
Out of all the thing in this game that might need a change (in a good or bad way), the Doctor is sure not at all in this list.
---
He's probably one of the only killers (if not the only killer) that doesn't need any change. No buff. No nerfs. Nothing, just leave him.
---
Its sucks, save your self now. I'm already packing my things. The end is near
---
Slugging is supposed to have intent or purpose behind it.  This is just BM.  Just a scumbag farming trap points while trying to piss him off.  Incredibly ignorant and no place in this game.  Defending this as legitimate slugging just makes you look like a clown.
---
He has two red addons. Your Mori pile will take 3x longer to grow than a Billy/Nurse/Bubba
---
Thank you for advice. I'll have to try that before I go mentally sicko mode.
---
Imma just use her beanie with it
---
Top 3 is no contest for me. Nurse first with Spirit following afterwards then Billy. I'm also considering Plague and Pig as top killers below that.
---
Oh my god that happened to me as a survivor.   Funniest shit ever
---
God I love those last minute 4ks! I had one as hag before where the survivor was hooked right by the gate. As soon as I hooked her, all 3 survivors hook rushed. I was able to down them one by one until they were all slugged. Then I just carried them all to hooks. They weren't happy
---
Focus on me!
---
Fo- Fo- FOCUS on me!
---
*oh!*
---
Idk how my kids they‚Äôre gonna plow the fields and tend to my crops without drinking milk though. I wont have a daughter with weak arms.
---
Find some friends to play with, and just meme around. Most fun you'll ever had. You can add me if you want.
---
The memes are alright tho
---
Why would they do that when they could give her more track pants, a tank top, and ugly hair?
---
I wont lie, I‚Äôve only played like 3 games total as nurse but as a killer main, I suggest using spies from the shadows. I use it on any killer I play (mainly huntress/hag) and it‚Äôs really good for winning chases, finding a survivor after they ran away from a gen, and just finding survs randomly
---
Only thing keeping the hearts frail beats going
---
Thank you for advice.
---
Worst comes to worst, wait for a 4 stack, and ask them if they‚Äôll do it for you with the promise to farm BP beforehand. Worked out for me. It‚Äôs a cheap move, but it gets the job done.
---
Thank you for your dedication to research and truth. Fight on good soldier.
---
No it should be based more on Survivors rather one killer.
---
You can make it a full series if people like the characters.
---
Yeah, not a single one of you doing a gen :(

my only opinion is that uh they didn‚Äôt call me

DBD mobile doesn't support my country and I didnt want to fiddle with my payment sources on my main Apple ID, so I made an entirely new apple ID solely for playing DBD on mobile.

Thing is, even after completely logging out of that secondary apple ID (on both app store and iCloud), I'm able to play DBD mobile on my main Apple ID with all the progress I made on that other account kept intact.
---
How is this possible though? Would you have any logical explanation for this? I'm not really a tech savvy on this behalf hehe

If I happen to set eyes on you first. I'm chasing. Period that's it. Some characters are easier to spot. Some players are easier to spot. If you keep being overly altruistic I'm not going anywhere. Your fault not mine.

Thank you! Also wow thats not very nice :/
---
BBQ, Ruin, Make Your Choice, and Nurse's for Me. 
---
I never use Infectious Fright, cause its usually used by sluggers and slugging is just not fun for me or the survivors.
---
She said they only thing she has to say is why didn't they call her. Which I assume she's saying she would have loved to be apart of it.
---
OoS and other aura revealing perks (wait for exact patch notes) will no longer reveal characters who are in their stealth mode (crouching Pig, shrouded Ghostface, phasing Spirit) as well as Meyers depending on which tier he is in. The new killer also supposedly will have a new mechanic called "Undetectable", you'll want to look at the developer notes on this.
---
whats not very nice what
---
*sad emoji*
---
Being impaled and hung is pretty painful
---
That they didnt call her
---
Okay that‚Äôs a fair point. I do remember lower ranks I thought she was the worst.
---
How to turn an entire Subreddit against you 101
---
I could really care less lol
---
well if you split adrenaline into healing and speedboost, then also not EVERY SINGLE SURVIVOR would use one of those versions. does this prove anything? no.
---
BBQ doesn't require any changes. if anything, WGLF needs a buff.

WABAAAAFET

I can't believe I've never thought about it this way before.

&gt;20% of survivors leaving the loading screen

There are literally only two cases I've seen where someone does this

1. Because the killer uses a hidden offering (potentially a Mori)

2. The client crashes

What did I even expect posting here on reddit, the perfect place for ignorant tools to circle jerk? You're just as abusive and useless as the moderator in question, further proving the point as to how worthless the whole system on reddit is.
---
Christ, some of those ignorant responses here are brain cancer inducing. Most of you don't know shit. But at least you can feel at ease spamming the downvote button, making your invalid opinion feel validated. Congrats. Now go put your empty head back into the sand and magically carry DS people from the exit gate to the next available hook in an instant. Apparently it's that easy. 4head
---
And for the most ignorant tools of you: I get fairly consistent 4K at rank 1. Getting kills at all was never the point. The point was all about some survivors getting braindead easy escapes. The sheer ignorance showed here makes clear why this is not being addressed, though.   
---
Now fuck off and circle jerk somewhere else.
---
Nah the memes aren't even that good imo
---
I thought they don't get punished if it happens during the loading screen? Or is that not the case
---
The dedicated servers are pretty much exactly on schedule for what they've been saying since they announced them. By end of summer, they've been pretty open about their progress on setting up and testing the dedicated servers, and they're getting another thorough test on the PTB coming in a few days.

That's not shitty behavior, that's being open and communicating with their fans and being on track with their projected roll out plans for that feature.

Uhm, no, Slasher movies are mainly about killers, survivors are secondary characters.

I agree about the series tho, it would be really cool.

Always gotta be this guy.

No. Fuck dcers
---
Nurse nothing else.
---
Gotta risk life and limb for baby Dwight.
---
Evilbred, you would make a good game developer. This is a pointless mechanic that simply adds another thing to learn or remember for new players.  I also agree that the struggle button lost it's novelty after the first thousand hours I put into this game, and would be better if it were a 3 press suicide to avoid carpel tunnel.
---
Pretty much zero new content has been added since it started. 
---
It‚Äôs a shame because I remember being so excited for it.
---
Awesome for people who have high level characters, pretty shite for new players
---
The bloodpoint thing doesn't matter though. It doesn't affect gameplay. Not directly.
---
That its just because nurse is the best.
---
My struggle button is "F" and I put the two emotes on my mouse side buttons (M4 and M5).
---
Everyone was complaining about it... What?
---
It‚Äôs not a very good solution for new players, as they are still stuck with the terribly long grind of getting teachables. With so many teachables in the game now, this should have been addressed
---
Yeah, once you‚Äôve played it for about 3-4 hours, you‚Äôve pretty much experienced everything there was to do. There‚Äôs really no skill-ceiling to the game at all.
---
Oh man, one time as a killer I had a full 4-person squad of different colored power rangers in my game. Each of them was playing dwight with a shirt matching their name.
---
So? That's not much of an argument. 
---
Just go play killer. If you aren't, your literally missing out on half of the game.
---
The new Perks seem a bit too good for some of them. Expect a good degree of chaos, plus all the new people joining as well.
---
In a competitive environnement things would be balanced by definition.
---
Here we are in an asymmetrical games with a lot of stuff that makes thinks unfair for one side or the other.
---
omg that's sooo great

r/ArianaGrande
---
I got that glitch before
---
I'd rather have some focused on origins, others focused on specific events where there were victims, others where someone escaped whoever the killer was. The episodes could be watched in any order that way.
---
Best advice I can give is to take a break when you feel frustrated and come back later. I will play solo survivor and have a HORRIBLE time with teammates who wont save or do objectives and killers who will camp and tunnel. What I do is stop playing, calm down from the annoyance and then get back on with the goal to just be casual and have fun. 
---
Not every game will be fun but as long as you keep a good attitude, it won't bother you.
---
One is getting good, the other got good
---
TTV in name = gay
---
I ran a killer for like 3 gens without ever seeing another survivor til I got hooked. They finished the last gens and unhooked me and we all escaped. It was so nice having no communication but still everyone just doing what they should. Felt like a special occasion.
---
What?! Please repeat that, you're to quiet
---
If it gets as abused as often as Mettle of Man was, then it kinda has to be nerfed. To clarify, if there is a single person running Inner Strength every game, that isn't abuse. But if all four players are running it and getting a heal out of it every game, that's pretty much getting abused.
---
I'll still go there to speed up the heal
---
Good ideia, I will do it
---
Insert Tokyo drift

I'm a new player and I was reading about the best dlc killers to get and people seemed to dislike Freddy, is he difficult to play? Or did he go through some changes and is good now where he was once bad?
---
We need her to have more voice clips but keep the squeaks
---
A disgrace to the Dwight race.
---
On console spirit is better then nurse unless u have a good setup
---
So fuck balance as long as you don't call it competitive
---
yea but spectator need to be emotionally bound to characters to make a series extremely popular.
---
That's why it's mportant to not just have a bunch of caricatural tennagers being killed one after an other by an iconic Serial killer.
---
We need "heroes".
---
The hair will look like shit as always but the rest of the outfit looks cool. Been a while since she got anything.

Don‚Äôt see why this man is getting so many downvoted,  the guy had literally 0 malicious intent.

---
I call that poor game design
---
Apparently you do
---
This is the funniest thing I‚Äôve seen in quite sometime.
---
Yeah, I have to play in stupid windowed mod in order to get it to work. So stupid. I would rather get have native support but would take black bars.
---
You mean when the survivor still try to escape despite the killer not tryharding ? You know what happens when a survivor go easy ? he dies.
---
That's the difference.
---
Strangely enough, killer streamers are more chill than survivor streamers in my games.
---
&gt; Or did he go through some changes and is good now where he was once bad
---
It would be a mini series, right?
---
When my friends and I played this game around launch we would exclusively play KYF. I liked to play as Trapper then and would always place a trap right under the hook (since this was before the trap change) to make saves hard or would camp the hook. We weren't in any community, we only played by ourselves and yet even then they hated when it happened. They would tell "No puppy guarding!" And eventually made a rule that we couldn't place traps under the hooks and we couldn't stand around them. As a baby killer then it upset me that I couldn't use these tactics but it made the game much more fun for us in the end. 
---
It's just a matter of having fun. If a player is doing something unfun it is natural for them to say "hey don't do that". No one can make you not do this but just think if you were in the survivors position how you would feel.
---
What a cute trappy boi
---
/u/hypnobearcoup  thx for the idea
---
The thing ironic about you calling it abuse is how inner strength gets weaker the more who have it. Once it‚Äôs three or four people it‚Äôs basically becomes a ‚Äúonce per trial‚Äù perk.
---
gross that should have been a nea skin it fits her trashy ass style
---
&gt;I don't understand why they made Legion unable to see scratch marks or blood stains when they removed moonwalking.
---
I think it's because during feral frenzy they sorta ignore windows and pallets, so they want juking the killer from no scratch marks or blood to be the "counter-play"
---
obviously though feral frenzy isn't strong enough to warrant it, since it can't down you unless they have Frank's Mixtape (I think that's the one).
---
It was considered to be the worst killer in the game. Now it got reworked and it's one of the best(Still not as strong as Billy/Nurse/Spirit), easy to play and definitely worth buying
---
It waa a joke lol
---
Dark sense + object of obsession is op plz nerf
---
He used to be the worst killer in the game, and his  power was more a disadvantage than an advantage. But they reworked him not too long ago and they did a really good job on it. He can be really strong and id say he's up there in the meta with hillbilly and spirit, A Tier. He has basically a bit of everything in his kit. He can teleport to Generators, Place down dream snares, has dream pallets, microsleep and more. And like i said he also is a point beast and his perks arent too bad either so id say he is in the Top 3 Chapters defnitely worth buying. He might be a bit Challenging to get into because he just has so much to him but with a bit of practice im sure you will be having a lot of fun with him.

Huntress is easy to learn to throw hatchets. Skill wise she has obstacles to deal with, mind games/prediction, and has to reload. 
---
Both are equally skillful but Huntress is easier to learn the basics since all she does is throw and doesn't fatigue.
---
Pretty much
---
Yea I remember the video about the stranger things chapter they said the original model was shorter then Dwight this is a good call back to that
---
-awkward CD-I Zelda smile-
---
Do whatever you want. As killer you have control over how the game goes. Want to let someone escape, go ahead! Want to leave no survivors even if they "4% off hook"? Fuck em kill them all.
---
Literally do what you want.
---
Actually, most the times i got those "braindead escapes" as survivor was when i was getting camped or hooked right next to the gate , so don‚Äôt do this and there‚Äôs a lot less chances you‚Äôll get DS‚Äôed and they escape 
---
. I don‚Äôt even get mad when I get DS‚Äôed as a killer cuz it just means I made a mistake . 
---
Just get over it . DS is balanced
---
I like that lol
---
*laughs and 360s to the gate person to force them to leave, showing a lack of care that they got away and more about how them staying is more problematic due to the guy on hook nearby*
---
Love him or hate him he's spitting straight fax
---
This just in folks, it‚Äôs ok to DC as killer if you had a bad game! üëçüòÉ
---
 I wonder if this applies to survivors as well? Hmmm....
---
this game is not competitive and will never be, no aim required, no difficult decision making you have to do..it's just knowledge compared to the real competitive games, this one is a joke
---
Having said this though, you do what you want to in the end. No one can make you not do something. There is no official game rule against it, play how you want.
---
Stranger Things PTB starts on Wednesday (Normal PTB starts on Tuesday, but it doesn't have the new chapter yet)
---
You can get to red ranks with every killer, the ones you mentioned are just the most braindead
---
Isn‚Äôt being toxic about being a dick and not dependent on your loadout? From my experience that‚Äôs what toxic always is, being an ass but not because of your loadouts in video games.
---
U can hate me, but u can't hate Daddy Myers
---
It says that you complain too much.
---
Totem spawns are only this good on the new Badham maps. This isn't a universal spawn strength
---
I meant like if it's just gibberish then to me it doesn't really count is all. If there was actual sentences or one liners like ash I could see it but ehh...lol
---
I can tell by your Username
---
You get points for setting up traps, I think he‚Äôs either farming points or insulting you, maybe even toying around because he doesn‚Äôt have to worry about a survivor escaping at the moment?
---
I watch No0b3 and Monto. Tru3 is whack.   But I watch every upload of theirs and everyone knows tbagging is disrespectful?  Dude, what is your argument?!
---
I‚Äôm gonna be honest with you. I completely forgot you could see the killer aura. I would use the perk to get the killer on me as I see it. But yeah using distortion would only work for 3 unhooks or less so I‚Äôd use something better with babysitter imo. My bad.
---
Lmao more often than not I safety pip or pip it really all depended on what kind of ‚Äúcamping‚Äù ur doing
---
Plants vs zombies soundtrack intensifies
---
Still complaining, I see. I rest my case then.
---
He literally did this for like 5 minutes. I‚Äôm sure he maxed out bloodpoints long before he downed me.
---
To add to this, we've received graphics updates, and game upgrades that I would say already bring the game into it's 3rd distinct version of itself. 
---
This the subscription model I can get behind.
---
He‚Äôs definitely a strong killer now. He‚Äôs got some confusing mechanics but when you get to learn how he works he can be really strong. He used to be awful but he has a lot of potential with the right perks/add ons.
---
Read the comments and now i finally realized why i have always been tunneled from rank 20 to my now rank 5.
---
Agreed
---
If you want to pay like a cheating scum, don't ask others to approve it.

Ultimate Sacrifice add-on change: When a survivor finishes the break armour action, the armor will quickly rise and swing at them, guaranteeing a hit. Once the survivor is hit, the armour will break.

Rename jack to a certain person who blocks people for the slightest hint of being rude intentional or not on the MHWorld subreddit and I would sleep easy tonight

P.S. I am not that guy.

Thanks for the response I've just bought him and will try him out soon. 
---
Do you have any tips on how to use him effectively?
---
Entity: Sorry, he‚Äôs not used to people.
---
If I had any bloodpoints to level up oof
---
Killer mains will always whine about something, if survivors died on spawn they‚Äôd still bitch and cry about how persecuted they are
---
BBQ is only good on speedy killers honestly. (My opinion). Billy, Nurse, and Spirit.    Unless you‚Äôre a stealth player then yes use lockers and distortion. But high ranks don‚Äôt care and want to be chased. Even then, they know how to evade when necessary. 
---
I don‚Äôt personally have an opinion on WGLF. Back when, we didn‚Äôt have to wait to get the stack now we have to worry about if they go down or not.

Stack WGLF and Steve‚Äôs new perk and boom, built in BBQ.

My wife of 7 years left two days ago. She got custody of the kids too.

It‚Äôs a good ol case of  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to loop decently and need to learn‚Äù syndrome. It‚Äôs all practice really and how to strategize and manage time.
---
How am I complaining? All I'm saying is that most maps don't have spawns this good. It's just a fact.
---
I mean, you aren‚Äôt SUPPOSED to wiggle out. It‚Äôs just a little mechanic that if the Killer gets too cocky or your Team can take a hit for you, you have the option of escape.
---
Being downed by a Killer is supposed to be scary and discouraged to a Survivor, wiggling is just there to give a little hope.
---
Meanwhile on my case instead of the fully healed david opening the gate and trying to bring the doctor away from me while I hid and also tried to open the gate he instead just let me die.... Asshole.
---
You only tap the attack button to pick up survivors
---
Here‚Äôs some quick info
---
Grabs
---
Healthy survivors
---
Working on generator, rescuing survivor from hook
---
Injured survivors
---
Working on generator, rescuing survivor from hook, mid-vault of window or pallet. (I forget if you can pick up survivors while they work on chests though)
---
On the bright side, survivors get more shards than killers if you play survivor more.  Survivors get in more games quicker if you die, which means more XP quicker and therefore shards.
---
tbh i think it‚Äôs just stupid bc it gives you hope and then you get screwed anyway. my entire friend group thinks it would be better if it just wasn‚Äôt there bc it‚Äôs false hope.
---
But you cant move the gens with Freddy, and most of the Freddy's add-ons are not focused on his teleport
---
Most of the ttv guys are chill guys/gals. I usually go for meme build against them and they either destroy me and i just move on or we have super fun game which i love watching afterwards if they were recording.
---
One of these things is not like the other
---
i mean i‚Äôve yet to see boil over in a bloodweb
---
then... play the game and run moris, i'll feel better;)
---
I hate to tell you about Myers and Spirit
---
Small Game/Detectives Hunch/Maps still exist though. 
---
If you‚Äôre honestly having troubles with Totems, just use Small Game. Even on the Springwood map they‚Äôre easy once you know their location.
---
wiggling is almost exclusively to prevent you from going to the basement every time you get downed. otherwise it is up to your teammates and your own choice to use certain perks to wiggle out
---
Tbh if I got to describe the appearance of an Entity offspring I would imagine it similar to Destoroyah‚Äôs first form in the Godzilla franchise but it mated with classic ‚ÄúIt‚Äù in it‚Äôs spider form.
---
Honestly ignore it, if you want to show decency that‚Äôs your choice, if you don‚Äôt.. still same. But changing what you do because someone got pissed is stooping to the level they want. Plus punishing the (assuming newer) and more immersed player kills the game if you‚Äôre doing so to make the (what should be) more confident and experienced player happy. I get the argument those types make, ‚ÄúKill them cuz it helps the community. They need to learn.‚Äù ... but really it just discourages trying harder if they can‚Äôt develop how they play naturally. I try to be aware of this playing both sides, I never ‚Äútroll‚Äù or meme with lower rank killers/survivors because there‚Äôs nothing to gain but discouraging the player from learning and playing fairly, higher ranks however adds a bit of fun. In your story, the person who got the hatch seemed the most worthy. They were the person who wasn‚Äôt as well together in the game to do well points wise. They had thee most to gain and the most to inspire them. The others it seems however, were just mad they didn‚Äôt get it.. which I get.. but that‚Äôs on them, it‚Äôs not ur responsibility to make them feel nice, you get to be nice on your own discretion.
---
Maximum 5 times per trial is too much to abuse? I think not. You‚Äôll need to cleanse any totem in the map and it takes around 10 sec to do that and takes approx 10 sec to heal in locker, which might take longer than Self Care and has limited of using. 
---
Besides, Mettle of Man has been nerfed for too much and now it‚Äôs a trash perk. Inner Strength will be next, just like they always did.
---
Took a survivor to a to the hatch and mori'd him in front of it. I also bullied a rank 20 nurse. God have I missed this game.
---
I can sketch some cosmetics for the zealot
---
My issue is a lot of killers want better totem spawns so their ruin doesn't get cleansed in the first 30 seconds which is understandable. The issue with this is it becomes almost impossible to cleanse all the dull totems which buffs NOED.
---
it‚Äôs like sharks and minos. You go on that map and run from the tractor to the wall. Hillbilly has add ons to move better and he is supposed to get two hooks and a down, than that person body blocks for him. Rules are changeable, but that is the best in my opinion
---
And by your flair, I can see you are a man of culture as well.
---
What is with Streamers and dying your hair neon colours?

Keen awareness seems way to similar to thrill of the hunt

Season 24 is Ninja Steel which came out in 2017
---
So this could‚Äôve happened, I kind of doubt it was the actual actors though, but who knows.
---
i haven‚Äôt seen any perks yet in my bloodwebs to let me wiggle out, i didn‚Äôt even know they existed until i made this post. idk i just feel like if it‚Äôs included in the game it should be easier to escape with it.
---
wee-woo-wee-woo here comes the *meme police*
---
Then your entire friend group should try out flashlights.
---
No, it was just their usernames
---
MoM only could be activated 4 times in a trial. It was broken. Old DS could only be activated 4 times in a trial. Also broken. The number of uses doesn't always determine balance. The actual effect has to be taken into account. A free health state for doing a dull totem doesn't sound strong, but it depends on the players amd circumstances.
---
That fucking hurts, it looks sweet
---
Did they mean ‚Äúonly 2+ years old accounts can buy it only‚Äù or ‚Äúonly 2+ years old accounts get it for free, everyone else must pay for it‚Äù? Because I would prefer the latter.
---
literally all they need to do at this point is prevent hex spawns next to gens and spawns in/behind the killer shack. no clue why it's so difficult for them. if they do that even keeping out in the open spawns would probably be okay
---
Survivor main confirmed
---
I've seen other maps where the 'location' is just as good as this. Where the totem is obscured completely by a line of boxes you gotta go through to get to it (I believe MacMillen estate). When you go around the wall of boxes, you see the totem at the end, covered on at least 3 sides.  
---
However, *this* (pictured) should not be the example of how totem spawns should be, where part of the totem model is *literally* covered by other atmosphere of the game. I wasn't even sure if I'd get to it
---
Do you have it unlocked from Kate? It won't show up otherwise.
---
Regardless, wiggle isn't supposed to do more than give you the idea that you /might/ get away. Most the time you won't unless they get cocky and screw up. Or you go down in an area where all the hooks were taken by dead teammates.
---
I might have to figure out how to do this. I've been leveling a bunch of survivors to try and get the perks. This just some efficient though.
---
it's poor balance to require countering like that. you shouldn't need really situational perks to counter something as good as NOED
---
No way you pip red ranks while camping.
---
Play Leatherface, if they annoy you..facecamp :) you'll enjoy end game chat
---
How is your ping? Does your interview speed fluctuate? People will DC if they‚Äôre jumping all over the map mid-game. If you‚Äôre using a console, try wiring it to your router instead of using WiFi.
---
....okay, but then you miss out on all the opportunities that it DOES work, and you get to escape. 
---
If you‚Äôre playing SWF, you should be able to coordinate some swipes that will let you out. I‚Äôve done it multiple times.
---
Just because it doesn‚Äôt happen for you, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs stupid and needs to be taken out of the game.
---
Wait are they nerfing him back to 110 speed
---
No, they were just memeing. It was still funny though
---
Game has sub 50 ping looking good.
---
Killer is a doctor on the game and its lagging like hell
---
Not suspicious at all
---
I will never understand ‚Äúgen rush‚Äù it‚Äôs literally the objective of the game lol
---
I think you're high.
---
The scream, not the slow. So other than the occasional tracking use, they aren't really countered.
---
Glad you enjoyed me and my boyfriend being stupid lmao
---
i had to change the skin check to m5 because of it lol
---
God dangit bubba how many times I gotta tell you, don't give them kids ideas
---
You seem to be glossing over the fact that part of the totem model is literally obscured by other atmosphere graphics. That's complete BS.
---
One perk that is really really good on him is Pop Goes The Weasel. It can be unlocked in the clowns bloodweb at level 40. When you kick a Generator it gets regressed by 25% after you hook a survivor for 40/50/60 seconds. Now if you want the full combo id suggest using bbq and chili. After you hook someone you can instantly teleport to a Generator where survivors are on and you can instantly regress it by 25%. Keep that cycle going and they will never finish a gen. Its a really good way to make the most out of his teleporting ability. These are just the two combo perks that work really well on him but if you dont got those perks yet id say to just use the average good killer perks, nurses calling, brutal strengh, ruin... you put snares down in a clown fashion way, shutting down loops but dream pallets are also a fun alternative. For more info you should just watch a YouTube Tutorial, id suggest Otzdarvara, he can explain stuff really well, he makes a lot of Tutorials so he porbally has a freddy one aswell.
---
You only need one person out of 4 Survivors to equip it and do its job.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúsituational‚Äù Perks that will help you out in certain scenarios, for both Killer and Survivor. If you‚Äôre somebody who dislikes NOED/Hex‚Äôs, take Small Game. If you aren‚Äôt too bothered, don‚Äôt.
---
Legend says if  **T h i c c**  hatchet noscope girl claps big **cheekus** girl, the entity will ***F U C K I N G  D I E******.***
---
*Waves chainsaw above head and screeches*
---
that has nothing to do with their comment lmao
---
I only recently realised that Kindred's eye has a hook in it and isn't just a normal eye.
---
I‚Äôd say any killer you choose really. Obviously there‚Äôs some like Nurse, Spirit and Billy that are obvious choices due to them just being good. But you‚Äôll have a lot more fun if you pick a killer you actually like and just get good with them‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I think it‚Äôs a good idea with the wiggling is no move, but maybe have pallet stun= drop, but not with flashlight, and a 10% wiggle area +
---
I love head on only when it works
---
I only do this to incredibly toxic annoying survivors as punishment.
---
Needs to put a tie on the little one.
---
Activate stealth while in a chase if the survivor is looping you around a tall structure to hide the red stain.
---
Too hard to wiggle?! Try this build. No mither, sabotage, boilover, flip-flop. Just focus on breaking all hooks and watch as the killer cries in pain knowing they have to camp you bleeding out because there are no hooks and no mither let's you self rev and if they do choose to drag you away flip flop let's you turn half of your recovery into wiggle progress and boilover let's you wiggle out faster/make the killer away side to side much more
---
Nice to see another individual who enjoys good killers
---
It‚Äôs still better than having every other Map spawn a Totem right in the open field next to a Gen
---
Then don't try wiggling and stop whining about it
---
but when you play swf everyone says you‚Äôre toxic and tells you to kys. and randos are pretty much useless. it literally has never worked for me or any of my friends. idk man i still think it needs fixed.
---
I don‚Äôt get why people get so butthurt over a disconnection. It doesn‚Äôt matter at all. The button is there for a reason, killers and survivors alike
---
&gt; I've seen other maps where the 'location' is just as good as this.
---
There are no maps with spawns as consistently good. The new Badham maps are literally the first ones that have the new spawn strengths they are working on implementing.
---
&gt; Where the totem is obscured completely by a line of boxes you gotta go through to get to it (I believe MacMillen estate). When you go around the wall of boxes, you see the totem at the end, covered on at least 3 sides. 
---
You are talking about the water tower spawn that everyone and their grandma discovered within hours of that becoming a span point. A consistent feature on a map (the water tower) having an obscured spawn **is not** as strong as one like in the image you posted.
---
&gt; However, this (pictured) should not be the example of how totem spawns should be, where part of the totem model is literally covered by other atmosphere of the game. I wasn't even sure if I'd get to it
---
You can actually see the totems from the outside. You just have to pay attention
---
Their comment is part of this post, and this post is talking *specifically* about totem models being covered.
---
For this reason I often try to leave streamers as the last or 2nd to last that I kill.
---
If you use hatchets alot it can be worth it at level 3
---
It took me this long (as a legion main too) to realize that the blur behind legion is not actually a blur but instead the other group members of the legion
---
I realised this the other day, too. It took way too long lol
---
It would  just be him getting bullied by being fat
---
"and their point is that if you have those"
---
Except you shouldn't need those at all. Killer mains who say crap like that just want reasons for survivors to waste good perk slots in order to have the ability to deal with their hex totems. Those perks are to make finding totems 'easier', not to make finding totems 'possible'. I only came across this one due to luck while ducking out of sign for a moment.
---
Sorry for poor quality
---
I think mindbreaker is gonna be one of those perks that 10 year olds ban on kyf because they wanna use dead hard and ‚Äúbully‚Äù killers.
---
Cool strawman. I'm a high rank killer and I never complain about totem spawns. It's part of the game
---
Realistically you can‚Äôt have an opinion based on experience if you are a noob killer. Lolz.
---
Tier 3 Stridor was pretty good for me when I started nurse, still sometimes use it
---
Even though Doc isn't really all that strong, I did find him fun to play as at times. Though I have to admit, its not very fun going against him because he basically says "fuck your immersion", especially if his shock extends a lot farther than normal
---
&gt; If the picture is of the spawn strength you desire, then you literally want totems to have part of their model covered, which just means you want them completely non-findable to begin with. 
---
so you're admitting that this spawn type is not typical of most maps right now. Thank you for being reasonable and backtracking on that previous false claim.
---
Also, if it's only partially covered then it is objectively able to be found and is not "non-findable" lmao
---
&gt; The picture is not "strength", the picture is OP. If you want stuff as strong as the picture, you literally do not want a fair game at all. 
---
"OP?" good god you are not at all reasonable. Like, it was obvious that you literally have never once played killer, but wow
---
&gt; You actually cannot, not when there's a wall of boxes that goes around a corner. I'm not convinced you're paying attention.
---
okay, god. first off, this reply of yours is about the water tower spawn, but the original comment you made that i replied to was about the spawn in the picture which you can see from the outside. so you are changing topics to make bad faith arguments
---
and again, the water tower spawn was literally discovered within hours of it being implemented in game so obviously it is not "OP"
---
Wow I worked so hard to get ruin and BBQ and this is what happens the worst part is this happens twice in two weeks
---
Grade A censoring on my part there, I now understand why mcote deemed me unworthy of ranking up
---
dude has literally never once played killer and whenever they post it's only to screech about killers
---
The latter
---
It's always fun to watch it after. I like trying to remember what was going on when the streamer was away to me, matching up my memory of it with their view.
---
Except I didn't say "all killers", and it's not a strawman if there are killers in my post still complaining about totem placement.   
---
Nice try though.
---
Now watch as the killer has Huntress Lullaby and someone had already been hooked before that moment
---
Sleep deprivation causes pretty big lapses in judgement
---
Sorta, I really want hannibal in, so I tried to come up with a concept that would work.
---
Just dont be an asshole and give out tips.
---
Oh shit I didn't know that! Kinda sucks for basement LF and gate nurse
---
If you're looking to use every survivor perk in a chase, then Inner Strength doesn't fit your playstyle. I don't think it would fit mine either, but that's because I only run perks that give me the best chances against Spirit and Nurse.
---
Inner Strength looks like a backup card, rather than an instant-mid chase perk. Cleanse a totem, and when you need a heal, get into a locker. It's an on command heal as long as you plan ahead.
---
Right? Lmao what else are you gonna do!? If you aren't 'gen rushing' you're losing
---
Yeah I looked at his post history. He probably got rekt by a sweaty Wraith with NOED. Yeah. Shit sucks. We all have bad games, but it doesn't give you a free pass to screech like an autist on a public forum
---
This add-ons is broken so you cant do much. If you are really desperate and you know they have it, gentap and hope for 50/50.
---
It honestly is super dumb.
---
I use a flashlight macro and it doesn‚Äôt lag the game lol. There‚Äôs literally quite a few benefits using one too. Flashing to get a randoms attention for a heal or to go do something, spamming to get the killers attention on you instead of your friend if he‚Äôs headed in their direction or while in chase, it‚Äôs a great ping tester to see the real latency and best of all pissing off toxic killers at the exit games :)
---
When a good nurse actually comes, people aren't used to it because they're so rare
---
The music makes this really funny.
---
Okay but that‚Äôs really not relevant to the point I was making.  Were talking about what makes a perk broken and you compared it to 2 perks that worked very similarly to each other but don‚Äôt compare well to Inner Strength.  That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm getting at.
---
that's still 2 dulls I can cleanse without problem.
---
That‚Äôd be awesome!!
---
Most people are lactose intolerant, especially people whose ancestors are from Asia or Africa. It can make acne worse. Personally it spikes my blood pressure by about 20 points. It was definitely worth giving up.
---
doctor‚Äôs due for a new skin since everyone from his most recent cosmetic set got one already or getting one next week, so i‚Äôm hoping with the new dlc he gets an 80‚Äôs themed one since he‚Äôs from the 80‚Äôs üëåüò©
---
a killer that stalks, crouches and one shots? very original
---
Having TTV in your name is hella cringe and you are just asking for people to fuck with you. Since why everyone moris them :) this is a toxic community and you are putting a bright red target on your back.
---
They're actually teabagging a baby wraith as we speak
---
Kinda? Thrill of the hunt does just totems and a BP boost. Keen awareness does all killer items like Traps too.
---
See the crazy part is the person who died was a red ranked player so I'm assuming they didn't pip up how they want it and was upset
---
Lol "progress on dedicated servers"
---
Means they are going to improve it over a long period of time like the frame rate on consoles and optimisation  which is shit seeing as they advertised dedicated servers summer 2019 at the E3 show. Lol
---
This happened to me in a game the other day. The poor baby trapper was so confused cause I also had used dead hard
---
Yep. First arc about him growing up and being transferred to the CIA's enhanced interrogation black site, and second arc about when he went nuts and ending as the entity takes him.
---
there was literally nothing else I could've done. One of the survivors chose to do a gen instead of help his 2 hooked teammates, and as a result I get bronze gatekeeper and don't deserve to rank up. like, what?
---
I was playing a good game, I finished off these last two, but hooks were far away. So I picked up the Jake because I couldn‚Äôt find meg so I ended up actually hooking, but I didn‚Äôt know the Meg had adrenaline so she escaped after I shut the hatch immediately, and I was about to mori her
---
That‚Äôs not important. All that matters is they all escape and you don‚Äôt use any perks. Walk a mile in their shoes.
---
It really isn't, but OK. It happens in COD, Halo, Titan fall, rainbow six siege, etc. I've never seen it frowned upon in those communities.
---
Must've been Dwight. Four-eyes.

If you stalk and they‚Äôre absolutely red they got exposed , but you don‚Äôt need to stalk to scare
---
but in phasewalk she can feel the collision, doesn‚Äôt really do much half the time
---
i mean i guess
---
No one gives a fuck about being on a 0 viewer stream lul.
---
Wobbuffet!
---
It gives you you a form of all the other addons as long as you spend part of the game just chasing and shocking. Which is, like I said, something I‚Äôm accustomed to
---
Can confirm, just started playing
---
At red ranks I think not.  The emblem requirements are far too punitive to hand out a legit pip at that rank while camping.  You doing this in the Greens or something?
---
*entoty displeased*
---
Maybe the rules could be changed up a bit, like you have to find items to give to gens, with 8 people finding items shouldn‚Äôt be hard
---
honestly it feels like that‚Äôs the only option. Spirit just feels so brainless with that add on.
---
I've had my fair share of toxic streamers but I get nice ones too who are pretty good at the game
---
üòè
---
I just assume they didn't bother to ask the actors because of finances. As for the special skins, that probably costs more money aswell. But it absolutely is a shame we don't have some more Myers or Freddy skins
---
Thank you for all the love I got from the last clip I posted here! It really motivated me to stream again. Heres a clip last night's stream. 
---
Come check out my stream @ twitch.tv/blakemistow  :)
---
No one saying everything is perfectly balanced, we're saying you're a being a baby bitch by complaining about ds out of all things instead of things like the broken loops on certain maps or things that actually matter lmao. You're just bad if you can't get around ds, plain and simple.
---
Who in their right mind would run ToTH and Haunted Grounds. Haunted is supposed to be an easier, less stressful alternative to ToTH for killers who can't defend totems so good.
---
I don‚Äôt do it all anymore but yes in reds it‚Äôs possible like I stated in my original post . If it‚Äôs a 4 man swf that‚Äôs over altruistic u will definitely neutral as long as ur not just sitting face to face with the hooked survivor. If u proxy camp a hook you‚Äôll do all right
---
I wonder if it does the same on the other versions of this map
---
Insta karma
---
 There a TTVs in DBD been playing the game since it came out and never came across one I don‚Äôt think
---
After they nerfed DS, they buffed DS. Increased the stun from 3 to 5 seconds and made it possible to decrease that stun time with Enuring. Then they nerfed Enduring. But DS still has its huge 5 seconds stun. I thought that this "nerf" will make the game better and make DS counter to tunneling, make it **defensive**. It didn't. 60 seconds is just way too long. You can hook one or even two survivors and still get stabbed by the one you hooked before those two. Ridiculous. DS should be a counter to tunneling. If that's tunneling... And now you can't avoid getting stabbed by dribbling someone to the hook. Great.
---
have you read the backstories?
---
Yeah it is scary already why add to that? I play both survivor and killer and I just don‚Äôt see this as me necessary
---
How did you make the demogorgon cute, I love this

---
I found the secret! I scratch my nose with my right hand mouse still in hand. I'll bring the mouse right up to my face. Ggez
---
Old habits die hard. Flashlights used to be OP, blinding instantly the killer. Survivors could just blind you midchase. Looking up or down had no effect.

I‚Äôm still waiting for the one time I join a lobby full of people wearing the pheonix shirts
---
Have to always assume Thrill, Haunted, Ruin, and Devour Hope :^)
---
They take a screenshot of your save file at random times and no one truly knows when the screen shot of the save file is taken
---
Yes, so why doesn‚Äôt he have movement speed akin to spirits, because she is slower than billy but still fast. You‚Äôre about to say ‚Äúshe can‚Äôt see survivors when phasing‚Äù but she has a plus because when she‚Äôs phasing she‚Äôs invisible. And she has tracking still, which is more that what legion could say
---
Scratch your face like a normal person. Rub it on the keys.
---
I've always called it "Shaman Waluigi." GET AWAY FROM MY TOTEMS WAAH!
---
Well then I‚Äôll just put it simply. Inner Strength is nothing compared to DS or MoM. It‚Äôs not overpowered, and it should not get a nerf. First of all, it isn‚Äôt free, second of all, it‚Äôs still time spent by:
---
Searching for a totem
---
Breaking the totem, potentially chased off it
---
Searching for a locker
---
Staying the in the locker for 8 seconds
---
The 2 second entry and exit time on a locker
---
See, I was thinking a movie.
---
Have it be set around the course of a single trial, with a new survivor being the audience surrogate. One by one the survivors get killed off except the newbie who barely makes out of the exit gate. Then, to his horror, a new trial starts. He realizes that the first trial was not a one off, it was the start of his new ‚Äòlife‚Äô. End credits.
---
Dude... you have issues.
---
Lol too long didn't read
---
No teemo VA was in a union and despite the millions of dollars they make a year they can't afford to pay for their voice actors more so they simply decided not to use the original VA any more
---
the killer also doesnt have to be facing the locker, even if they dont look at it it'll still works
---
Where can I volunteer to write a screenplay for one of these?
---
Love me the Eyes build. I've debated making an alt account just to play exclusively with that build.
---
Ok then. Not sure if this counts as a reportable offense though so I wouldn‚Äôt report him IMO
---
Cool

I don't think he was bming , he might've been waiting for ds

How the fucking fuck did that take a whole hour to make?

From the killer's pov:
---
Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old
---
Fed up with life and the way things are going
---
He decides to rob ~~a liquor store~~ the hearts of  beginner dbd players by equipping an ebony mori and playing extra scummy.
---
I don‚Äôt see how it was stupid beyond making someone else seem stupid. Aka BHVR, even then it didn‚Äôt seeming it was making them appear TOO stupid to fit the joke
---
These are my opinions, basically I‚Äôm saying that I personally don‚Äôt think your joke works.
---
Im not very skilled with the editor
---
Which is what you do after you downed something. It's not like you are put at any disadvantage. And do we really want another character as strong as nurse in the right hands...
---
I shall call him... Mini-Dweet
---
Never had this interaction through messages playing DBD. Most people just say I‚Äôm shit and gay
---
The top isnt too bad.
---
There's that beautiful toxic element I love in the community.
---
Fair enough
---
And then we could make "Netflix Adaptation" memes that are actually accurate. :^)
---
But on topic Dead by Daylight actually has a great premise for a movie. There's so much great lore that pretty much isn't touched upon at all in game, and it's really a shame.
---
I‚Äôm deluded u/ElderParthanax I‚Äôm sorry

* Screenshots highlighting multiple disconnected players (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
In that case, yeah they might need to grow a spine then or at least recognize someone else is getting hit somewhere at the moment.
---
How about now
---
I think the killers are fine except for nurse, billy and maybe spirit. I can consistently get atleast 2 kills  9/10 hook every single game with almost every killer and 4k the majority of my games between ranks 6 and 1.
---
In response to your edit, I don't agree as they said that they didn't have the means to refund the clothing to everyone at the time, but at the time they could refund the BP. It was better to get the BP back straight away and wait for the cosmetics to be refunded rather than wait until you could get both at once.
---
tldr  
---
You got spanked.
---
Dweet should be a killer
---
Good points for everybody?
---
As did the developers.
---
This shit pisses me off so much. There are so many licensed characters who get put into DBD without the actor's knowledge, and while it also sucks for the actor that their likeness gets into a game without their knowledge it also sucks for the consumer that a lot of creative liberties have to be taken so that their in-game depiction doesn't infringe on the person's likeness and copyright. Yet if they had just *asked* the actor in the first place they could've probably gotten something truly amazing.
---
Kyle Garner and Quentin Smith is an obvious example. He tweeted out that he didn't even know Quentin was going to be a DBD Survivor until the DLC came out. He learnt the exact day as everyone else that his character was going to be in a video game. And Quentin has to look like ass in order to not infringe on Garner's likeness.
---
Meanwhile we have Steve and Nancy who probably learnt early on what Netflix was planning with BHVR, and henceforth actually let BHVR use their likeness and don't look like ass in-game.
---
Again, in my opinion, don‚Äôt make sense and doesn‚Äôt work.
---
Also, you‚Äôre talking about jokes that rely on lying... actually I‚Äôve never heard a ‚Äúlying joke‚Äù before to be honest :l... not once in my entire life. Oh well, either way my point is that for me, this joke makes less sense than the concept of removing the Alert perk from the game.
---
Please tell me they were teabagging when they thought they were safe
---
Idk what you mean by wiggle. One tip for killers is learn to hide your light. Good killers learn to abuse this especially around jungle gyms and pallet loops. One tip if you're new to survivor is run bond or empathy. Those perks really helped my game sense and showed me how to interact with my environment.
---
Yes            Yes
---
        Yes
---
  Yes         Yes
---
# YES

I for one would endorse a movie about a big scary russian lady taking out nazis before giving herself to a eldritch entity

And a large soda.

I mean I guess but I feel like rather than putting it in their name a simple flair in their about me quote works too
---
The PTB is basically a beta test for the next update, the next PTB starts tomorrow.
---
Camping is when you stand near/next to the hook and wait there. It's not really a good tactic, and it's no fun for the person on the hook.
---
I can kind of understand it at a basic level of "we gotta make sure these perks are added to the bloodweb correctly, cost the correct amount of points and are awarded to the player properly" but beyond that, I dunno
---
This was bad game for me. So at gate I just turned around and run into other side of map. But one cocky bastard run after me so I downed him and hooked. This was result. Still depiped.
---
NOED is no one escapes death - if there‚Äôs a dull totem after the generators are done it lets you one shot down survivors. Bbq isn‚Äôt as good anymore as lockers can counter it.
---
And with her own [chase music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_piia0hKbo).
---
Nah, I never miss ;)
---
Just like teabaging the killer, its not reportable, since he is going to die.
---
But it is anoying
---
Well it's not really a matter of agreeing or disagreeing. I'm telling you how it all went down to save you some frustration. They had no way of knowing who had legacy items or not and since that was a special event, they didn't want to hand those out to just anyone. People that weren't even affected got free bloodpoints just because it was a customer service related issue to clear some negativity. I mean I don't blame you for still wanting it and hoping that it can be resolved, but I just don't see it happening and I wouldn't hold the company accountable after agreeing to accept the bloodpoints as compensation.
---
Watching this made me smell something like cleaning products but when it‚Äôs the kind that makes you sick to your stomach and I dunno why
---
I miss a lot ;)
---
Noed is a perk. It stands for no one escapes death, once all the generators are powered a dull totem becomes a hex totem, it allows you to one shot survivors as the killer but it's countered by just doing all the bones as a survivor before the game gets to that point. As for BBQ it's loved because everytime you hook a survivor a 25% stack to all bloodpoint gains is applied and given post match, it goes up to 100% in tier 3, it also shows you the aura of all survivors when you hook someone if they're far enough away, if their aura isn't shown they're either hiding in a locker or close by waiting to save
---
I don't get it. Not trying to be rude or ruin it, but can someone tell me if this is a reference to a show or something? Because I actually don't know.
---
BBQ is still the best perk in the game, real killers only used it for double BP. 4 stacks of BBQ is a real win
---
Imagine all the flashlight abuse...
---
Me currently bc I just started playing killer
---
Yeah man, just rush the migration to dedicated servers and call it a day. What could go wrong?
---
Precisely my philosophy. Normally you don't camp if you can avoid it because all the time you're spending camping you're not protecting gens. If all the gens are done, there's no reason not to camp the hook. The alternative is making the active decision to let survivors go for no benefit whatsoever. The day survivors actively leave their compatriots to die on an endgame hook that isn't guarded by the killer is the day I'll stop camping the hook in the endgame.   
---
This is especially true of survivor groups who act super altruistically: even trying to save people from hooks where you're actively camping just so their friend doesn't get sacrificed. As I said, if you're not going to leave the hooks alone, especially during the endgame, I won't either.
---
The Entity could be introduced in the final installment to tie everything together
---
Depends on your efficiency and if you are willing to get the best items or the cheapest ones...
---
All I had to say was in my previous comment that they 'pretended' not to read and likely couldn't retort. Why say more when they're only going to reply with more troll comments?
---
No, it only affects chance to jump off hook and maybe escaping from bear traps (latter i‚Äôm not too sure).
---
Or a trapper.
---
I know. I hate when they think that because it makes them think they have a reason to complain.
---
Also, the following note isn‚Äôt me trying to insult anyone, but rather a simple fact
---
Just like survivors, killers aren‚Äôt supposed to win every match (win referring to getting 3-4K)
---
Lol of course a Trump supporter doesn‚Äôt know how to lighten up and laugh at a dumb joke
---
Saved 28k BP right there. Nice.
---
"Must have been a bug I suppose."
---
Time will tell.
---
Oh hey look it's the guy that was a massive cunt and admitted his point was hypocritical the last time this conversation came up, then deleted the post entirely.
---
I hate getting messages from entitles survivors saying to ‚Äòrespect the 4%‚Äô and that I should‚Äôve let them escape even though they teabagged at every pallet
---
Ahh because the game updated when hatch closed and identified you as last survivor alive at the same time it cycled into struggle is what it looks like
---
oh sweety.
---
Saying that he belongs there is a no-no
---
Don't use a mori everytime, but it seems like fair payback for being used for their content creation.
---
I run it on trapper for lack of better options and as a reminder of my baby stage
---
Scooped my brains out
---
I was told they would eventually give the legacy back by multiple devs in multiple tickets over the last three years. I can share them with you if you would like.
---
I respect that
---
Haha I feel this
---
I don‚Äôt see your logic tbh. Could you tell me the map this took place on and if it‚Äôs from stranger things dlc or base game?
---
I heard devs had plans of changing that. Did that never come to fruition?
---
You can feel the mismatch and predict the ranks in your first chase with them all.  I felt absolutely fucking terrible in this Doctor game yesterday because it was such a shitshow.  I could feel the yellow rank in their chases.  Game was such a shitshow.  Gave away hatch and still doublepipped.
---
I meant my first game as ghost face
---
Absolutely not. Don‚Äôt change anything so I can keep absolutely obliterating with Billy in every single match
---
Took a bit to recognize your wording meant it was being covered by the environment, which is not the atmosphere. Might I suggest making a comment that says you meant environment and not atmosphere real quick? This will allow people to avoid insulting you for the slight accident.
---
Its roughly 29k
---
Its super hard to get 32k as survivor
---
Survival category gets capped at around 5k
---
A killer is only as good as the person playing them, I‚Äôd probably have a better chance against a Nurse at red ranks than a Clown just because that clown player was good enough to make it there
---
This. Spine Chill, and playing super paranoid is the only real defense.
---
Hens are easy, just do 1 and a half with prove thyself.
---
Altruism just do 3 safe unhook and a handful of heals.
---
Boldness is just a few pallet stuns and a good chase or two.
---
The real challenge comes in maxing survival. Escape obviously, combined with deliverance equals 6,500. But that means you need to get 5 self heals to finish maxing the category.
---
Not too difficult in the individual categories, it getting them all in the same game is obviously far harder.
---
*used to*
---
Congrats on quittingüëç
---
They did, at one point, say they were working on trying to get legacy back.  I believe they abandoned that idea, though.
---
lol body blocking, dead hard, flashlights aren‚Äôt toxic. You just need to get good. The only toxic thing is teabagging. Just playing in a SwF and trying to save your friends isn‚Äôt toxic, it‚Äôs just you being salty. And obviously they‚Äôre good or you‚Äôre just really bad if all of them are escaping. And what rank are you?
---
dude lmfao come on
---
new cosmetics have fucking nothing to do with your fucking legacy jacket
---
It's not to make everyone "laugh". You know its like the "Alt F4" jokes.
---
"How do i display fps guys"
---
"Alt + F4"
---
*basketbomber left the server*
---
"hahaha he did it"
---
Thanks bud 4 months so far!
---
Nah don't waste the slot man.  There are so many more impactful perks you could place there instead.  Just got to practice your swing discipline.  Take the extra moment and make sure you got the hit before you swing.
---
He pulled the cord then to save his shitty flashlight
---
‚ÄúYa‚Äôll can stop being rude‚Äù
---
Your post was literally ‚ÄúWE NEED TO REMOVE WIGGLING BECAUSE ITS STUPID AND I DONT LIKE IT.‚Äù
---
The wiggle mechanic has been in the game since day one for years. People gave you reasons/explanations and all you did was ignore them or argue.
---
I don‚Äôt know what you want us to do.
---
Actually it does. Allows killers to complete nearly an entire blood web every single game. This grant them the ability to play with great add-ons more often. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs the worst thing in the world, it just seems cheap to give them double blood points on top of another ability. Especially when the comparable survivor perk doesn‚Äôt give anything on top of the bonus.
---
I think the community anticipation to this cosmetic was the highest out of all. It‚Äôs just sick.
---
I feel for you.  The whole save destruction error thst went on for like a year was both ridiculous and badly mishandled.  All that said, if they haven't gotten anyone legacy back in 2 years, it ain't coming back.  Just have to move past it at this point, imo.
---
I never got around to leveling dwight. Is he worth leveling? Is prove thyself 100 percent neccessary? 
---
But other then that thanks for the tips. I've always struggled timing pallets stuns.
---
Fourthed

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cyeucq/so_is_dead_hard_going_to_stay_bugged/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Aren't they just making more perks appear after level 40, though?  In that case, it'd be immaterial.  Hell, may still be immaterial as having an extra perk choice on web wouldn't really change cost to clear it.
---
I hope one day I can get a perfect game. I feel like I would need to swf for it to happen. I solo que 90 percent of the time. I'm on xbox so the playerbase is small to be able to get a good team together
---
we might have to unpack this
---
So will I be able to get the perk to show up in my bloodweb for other survivors or do I have to get the teachable now?
---
&gt; I could really care less
---
So you are concerned then? Because if you weren't you'd say you "couldn't" care less.
---
I don‚Äôt know why alt + f4 is considered a joke at all. Seems really pointless if you ask me.
---
Anyway, isn‚Äôt the point of a joke to have something to do with intentionally being really bad and unfunny or being funny? If it makes no sense, it isn‚Äôt a joke, but as long as it makes sense then it is indeed a joke.
---
Why? Because I think a character that's easy to avoid and shit to control isn't as good as one with an actually effective ability?
---
Hillbilly is shit, and needs add-ons just to make him tolerable.
---
but, here‚Äôs the thing. I can counter, I can loop a spirit, its not hard to tell when they‚Äôre phasing. It‚Äôs when you have no counter play other than one perk that really is strange. Not even nurse does this. Spirit with prayer beads becomes a stealth killer with insane map pressure and chase potential. Normal spirits are fun and have a lot of things you can do if you know how much time until they use their power again. The issue lies in the fact that prayer beads removes the sense of counterplay and just doesn‚Äôt even give a chance. If someone gets hooked I just have to get off the gen and hope that I‚Äôm safe? It‚Äôs not like pig getting a hook because you can see her, same with wraith and ghost face. The only indication of safety is seeing someone else either get injured or grabbed in the distance. Spine chill is good but then again it‚Äôs always good. I play spirit so I know all the books and crannies like looking at the grass, and all that so I avoid it as a survivor, but even then, there‚Äôs still no knowing when she‚Äôs coming. Why am I still typing. I give up. I‚Äôll just run spinechill and run to a pallet in the hopes she loses me.
---
what does wraith need ? i haven't been playing too long and am just level 15 survivor but he can go invisible and move quickly, what else would the guy actually need, because i personally have had my fair share of ass-whoopings from wraith
---
I think so? I‚Äôm not too sure 100% what is being changed other than more Perks. Either way I‚Äôm excited since I have so many Killers sitting at Level 50.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to get Enduring/Brutal Strength/Spirit Fury on Clown.
---
I'd like to think you're being genuine, but in all honesty it doesn't matter if I made a mistake in my wording or not. People who dislike that I've called out that this is happening (because it would be advantageous for them) will grasp at what straws they wish to feel 'right'. Nevertheless, my title clearly says I'm talking about the bush and tree covering parts of the totem model.
---
So you love the idea of DbD but playing it is hell. Here are some of what I do:
---
1. "Be the Killer you want to see in the fog." If you're tired of the same boring killers, perks and plays, go play Killer with a character who's really underuse and play with fun perks. You might lose but focus on making it a FUN game and usually you'll do better than you expect
---
2. Play to survive as long as possible.
---
A 3-man game is exceptionally difficult but you can still learn a lot and experience a lot if you push yourself to the very end. Be the last one standing. If you can't get the hatch, try the gate. Play to the last second
---
3. Play a Survivor with not-meta perks
---
This is especially challenging but also especially rewarding. Play No Mither David. Play with Premonition, Small Game or other lesser used perks. It'll take your attention of off winning and more on surviving; the game will be way harder, but you'll be more engaged, and crossing the finish line with a lamb-for-the-slaughter Botany Knowledge Claudette can be SO satisfying
---
Also, any of these methods can and will cause you to derank a bit. But hey, that might help you nestle back into the casual ranks for more enjoyable games.
---
Good luck and I hope you can find some fun in the fog!
---
Sweet. I don't care for most of the prestige skins (aside from The Shape's mask), so it just doesn't seem worth it to me to lose all the perks/add-ons/offerings.
---
This is an interesting point, but the counter argument would be that hooking survivors is the killers main objective. They cannot play the game without hooking people, so they are guaranteed to get some of those bloodpoint stacks. 
---
However, unhooking survivors isn‚Äôt necessarily something that a survivor will do every game. Whether someone is camping, or there aren‚Äôt a lot of hookings in a game, or maybe someone else just unhooks the survivors before you, you may not get those bloodpoint gains.
---
I never thought I could love dogs more
---
üÖ±Ô∏èüÖæÔ∏èi lover
---
Now everybody from the 313 put your mother fuckin hands up and follow me
---
But that‚Äôs the point is that you have to stack two perks to equal one.
---
Can we talk about how the Mobile version looks better than the switch one?
---
It's one of the only perks I have atm so its alright for me

"I don‚Äôt see your logic tbh."  
---
In my 'you got spanked' reply? Look at the posts sequentially. It should be obvious.
---
my post was asking if anyone else thought we should have it quicker/faster. i didn‚Äôt know the reason for it, and all y‚Äôall did was act like dicks and tell me to stop being a cry baby. other people actually took the time to explain it instead of being an asshole. fuck off my posts now.
---
It might make people misinterpret the post, like I did, because of the wrong word that was chosen, which would have made sense if you used ‚Äúenvironment‚Äù
---
Atmosphere is not the objects, it‚Äôs the general feel of an area.
---
Balanced only against good SWF. For solo players, no way. I wouldn‚Äôt mind if all other killers were buffs dto his level after comms were added to the game.
---
It works but good luck finding this in-game, the next chapter is most likely gunna be scarecrow from the book of alana series or that's what leaks will tell ya
---
I would kill for a Netflix original series about the original DBD killers that went in depth about their lore for a 40 minute episode
---
It's just amusing to witness "na√Øve" people believing an absurd lie.
---
It's like a soft bully if you want.
---
Oh, I had heard a different story. Involved royalties for every instance of the lines or something.
---
Ah well
---
No not that, just
---
Literally everything else
---
You let go to change positions just as a skill check appears.
---
https://youtu.be/fblkTPjj8Yg
---
can we talk about how that lunge actually hit though when it shouldn't be physically possible?
---
What‚Äôs weird about it?
---
If u would want to know that just look up how many people got the achievement
---
Hey. Don't offend gays with such a comparison smh my head
---
She was stealing your wallet her and the killer are clearly working together
---
It‚Äôs not though. 
---
It‚Äôs just so people who don‚Äôt have the character can experience the character. 
---
The Licnesed ones.
---
How is it a lie? Definition on google, mate. That‚Äôs where I get hell of a lot of info that rarely proved wrong (hell, in school I was allowed to let google define every word I didn‚Äôt understand or couldn‚Äôt describe during ‚Äúdescribe this word‚Äù assignments, always got them correct as a result, even was told I HAD to use google to define them, but that‚Äôs enough of school stuff)

---
What about Friday the 13th? Idk bout you but I cant remember the face or name of a single character except for Jason
---
Not even gonna point out the other one? :p
---
I just used a mori because it's universal, usually I'll just pull out ol' reliable Iridescent Heads + Extra Two Hatchets
---
I still stand by the fact that I put in my title the description of what was covering the totem model.
---
It‚Äôs disgusting how bad the matchmaking is. Respect to u though lol
---
I thinking about buying the pig, should I or no?
---
Ya but i wanna know like how many people per season caus a lot of them dont play anymore 
---
I saw that about 0,9 Killer get Rank 1 and anout 1,3 percent Survivor get rank one
---
They'd have very little screentime though.
---
Do you think they should lower the levels required or give more perks at lower levels? Personally I just power new characters with BP I earn during that time on my main survivor, so I'm curious what people think
---
I‚Äôd watch that, like a series about the killers life up until the entity for about 49 minute episodes
---
So the way you felt was what hid the totem from view? That is what you are suggesting. I might suggest looking up atmosphere (not the ‚Äúplanet info‚Äù stuff)
---
Or mends
---
If you spend them wisely, 37-39
---
It's not they have things to do with eachother, it's the priority of making that bit more money than putting a little time into to fixing something that has been going on for over three years, especially considering that they already said they would fix it multiple times but haven't. This affects the people that made the game what it is today. You cannot have read it well, what I am saying is easily understood from the original post.
---
That‚Äôs when I restart the game
---
Lucky for you I still have the link to the vid with a good build that relies on wiggle https://youtu.be/vL_oaEgBIuc
---
You made a public post on a SubReddit. I can post wherever I feel like :)
---
Maybe learn the game and play more instead of being salty and ignorant to people?
---
People don't like losing.
---
And how are you gonna do the gen Sherlock?
---
Pretty sure he tried to tech you. Basically DC as you hit him so his corpse would just fall to ground. But it doesn‚Äôt always work and this type of shit can happen.
---
didn't notice till you said something but holy fuck those aren't just regular hands, those are the fabled Gigahands
---
Meh, it happens guess you gotta try again
---
&gt;  You cannot have read it well, what I am saying is easily understood from the original post.

ah there it is. a personal insult just like your entire whiny ass submission

&gt; It's not they have things to do with eachother, it's the priority of making that bit more money than putting a little time into to fixing something that has been going on for over three years

fucking omega goddamn lul that you think this is what caused the holdup
---
You're a bad man, mister
---
There‚Äôs a difference between being toxic and not loosing
---
Man it's funny how you know exactly what happened in the negotiations with the license holders.
---
It's fine to be disappointed, buts it's another thing to be an entitled dick.
---
Oh wow lol I just had the same thing happen to me. The Ghostface was garbage but my teammates were even worse, yellow rank noobs even though I‚Äôm rank 10. Idk Ghostface are always huge scumbags, everytime I‚Äôm the last survivor and downed they tbag so I just DC. Don‚Äôt care enough to wait if you‚Äôre not gonna hook me.
---
That seems more like a statement that should be posted at the top of a thread though, not in the middle of one. It's also incredibly vague too. If you want to know something, ask.
---
What were they doing?
---
Spirit is only better than Billy if she uses sting addons and Billy isn‚Äôt using any. 
---
Insta-saw Billy &gt; Prayer beads Spirit
---
If you thinks Billy can be easily looped, you have not seen someone good at curving.
---
I got it. I don't think he did
---
Like your TLDR ‚Äúyou got spanked‚Äù which included nothing from your previous comments?
---
T bagging, unhooking their teammates every ten seconds, flashlight, more t bag, I just can‚Äôt fghghh
---
Problem is the physics of dead by daylight. They cant jump, climb, hit the killer, put used pallets up again, make killers like Hillbilly stumble, etc. They also dont have the 3rd person view.
---
Mori them on death hook and be a noble Killer.
---
I agree. I was hoping people would elaborate on this idea and make it better than what I could come up with
---
Nobody is being an entitled dick. The fact that WB has allowed a classic Freddy skin in a MOBILE game shows they absolutely would‚Äôve allowed it for console. It doesn‚Äôt take a genius to show that they never bothered to ask, especially considering they never asked for any of the other likenesses either.
---
How does this happen?
---
I‚Äôm not complaining about it because I like not pipping all the time lol. But, there is a pretty big gap on black pipping. I‚Äôve performed like shit in some games and still black pip. I‚Äôve annihilated team and black pip. Very wonky scoring IMO so I can understand the frustration of someone actually attempting to pip
---
apparently autists are easy to impress
---
None of them had Borrowed Time...you got outplayed bro lol
---
Well, we are going to have to disagree. I would rather be prayer needs Spirit than Insta-saw Billy. 
---
Iron will or Spine Chill can shut Spirit down. Billy doesn‚Äôt care if you know he‚Äôs coming.
---
The final girls. Anyway there isn't a show TV based on Jason as the main character.
---
And if there was, it would't be extremely popular i think. not like the Top series.
---
Well the Pig didn‚Äôt talk ever?
---
GGs brother Jake
---
TIL.. Entity is Melisandre /s
---
See but we don't have to. What u are talking about is just accepting being lied to. We can give this attention but not with your mindset.
---
My second round they did have my edit says it
---
Just an update i submitted another ticket. The staff closed it instantly (lol). I tried again the next day (today) and the guy was really helpful and he sorted it within 5 mins. So i got my bloodpoints in the end. The other staff member hadnt even credited them even though he said he had and they should be on my account haha. Thanks all!
---
Freddy isn't overpowered though
---
Jake.. just shapeshifted to make it less obvious I guess üòÇ
---
I find him very tedious. Like I‚Äôll take a nurse or a hillbilly over a doc any day. Good nurse or hillbilly is fun.
---
I know but a lot of the DBD community see him as that
---
This Tuesday in Texas
---
I pipped.
---
And ma boi Erman would probably be the most evil of all killers.
---
OP doesn‚Äôt know you can swap out perks?
---
An they are still messaging me hours later lol even checked my friends list and told a friend on me lol
---
Demogorgon, mom says it‚Äôs my turn on the Xbox
---
Lolol this needs more context. Gg
---
I almost always play killer and I found it way more annoying before. Worse than the old MoM. It's definitely way better this way.
---
I think the only way to make it better at this point is to have a disadvantage to using it when you are not the obsession, like a decreased stun or something. Because DS is only really annoying when a lot of people have it.
---
I think you may have missed my point entirely
---
Depends. 
---
Don‚Äôt like getting in higher ranks due to the wait times. I try to stay in the 7-12 range just so I can actually play a game. 
---
If I hit 6, the wait times go so far up that I play while watching TV to depip.
---
What ? Is it the "Nea the killer" meme all over again ?
---
Problem is the game literally rewards survivors for lone wolf gameplay right now. A lot of people are and have been doing exactly what OP is speaking of at Red and Purple ranks. And somehow they still pip for their horribly selfish and virtually dead weight playstyle.
---
My pc specs are fine.
---
Easier to dunk on baby survivors with a meme build than playing against people actually your level
---
2 year ago I am rank 1 but im banned now ƒ± am rank 15 because every single game i got camped
---
I love the way u drew Steve. Fluffy boy
---
No because your intent is to annoy people and that‚Äôs just rude.
---
Most of them are a lackluster uncreative paragraph filled with generic troupes
---
Yeah, cause spirit is just an instant win and there‚Äôs absolutely NOTHING survivors can do to pull ahead and NO mistakes a killer can make that can give survivors the edge.
---
Are there even slasher series aside from Scream?
---
They did this on purpose to punish all the new players coming in because of stranger things. Give them a taste of what to come
---
I'll post the screenshots and block out the names lol
---
but we sandbag each other all the time :(
---
Lol this game is actual garbage played it for like 10 mins and got a headache
---
Isn't it from the early 2000s?
---
Pipping at high ranks isn't just about getting a 4K as fast as possible. Grab a screenshot of your post match emblems and people can give some tips on how to improve the ones you're not doing well enough for
---
Good against stealthy characters. Kind of a wasted slot against non stealth
---
If anyone wants to watch the twitch stream of said match where I did nothing, DM me and enjoy the face camp
---
If a person is about to die on the hook and it‚Äôs literally a case of ‚Äúall I can do is try and take the hit for them and hope the killer hooks me instead of tunneling,‚Äù I‚Äôll go for it. Better to at least try and die for the noble cause and hopefully have the favor returned than to just sit and watch them die on the hook. Especially when it was their first hook and they are already at 5% left of their struggle phase.
---
Side note, I was mad about the face camp on first hook.
---
What do you mean?
---
Does Kate have pinch-able cheeks? Didn‚Äôt think so.
---
‚ÄúJessie!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúJamAUUUUUAGHHH! [Meathook noises]‚Äù
---
Where‚Äôs the fun in that?
---
I know its just normal chase music but it makes it funnier to hear this while seeing a body slide on the floor
---
Yeaaaah but the clown cant get across the map in 4 or 5 seconds no matter how you cut it.
---
Ranking sucks, kill them to soon, no pip, kill them too late, no pip. If you killing all 4 before 2 gens get done you need to rotate out the survivors so that you don't tunnel, and you need to let chases take longer. I am a killer main, and yes it seems like we get punished for doing our job.
---
Certain perk builds don‚Äôt need spine chill but I personally run it
---
If you need to get over spine chill withdrawal run builds that don‚Äôt need it
---
Yes, you‚Äôre overly dependent. It‚Äôs not a necessity at all. It‚Äôs very useful against stealth killer but people use it so much it becomes a crutch and now you run like a chicken with his head cut off when you hear the terror radius. 
---
I used to be this way. Then I got accustomed to not using it and when I tried to use it I realized it was that much helpful, there are better perks, like Borrowed Time, that are a necessity (and are the reason people lose so many games).
---
Ok so it does lag the game if you use it to much and you do not need to spam a flashlight that fast to get somebody‚Äôs attention to be healed just click it a few times normally. When you use it to ‚Äúget the killers attention‚Äù what your really doing is purposely trying to be as rude and toxic as you can so you can make the killer so mad that they chase you. You could just spam the flashlight normally but that‚Äôs not enough for you is it? Because all you want to do is make the other person feel bad.
---
Toxic Neas always get cocky, Claudettes hide when they should run, a Meg will double back one time too many. 
---
But a  Bloody Dwight? A Bloody Dwight is something else. He never stopped being scared, he‚Äôs always terrified. He lives in the fear now, he thrives on it, he is as much a creature of the entity as the Killer now.
---
Myers still catches me off guard and ghostface now
---
Did this dude just tell me to use quick quiet and balanced landing?
---
Literally anything. When I first started playing I was playing on a toaster and the skillcheck fps was awful, so I dreaded those. It was pretty much impossible to hit them.
---
The pipping system isn't built around just success. Some of the emblems are designed so the game doesn't end too quickly for either side. You need a certain amount of hooks, you need to let people work on gens, but protect them, etc. Some of these things are anti-camping and anti-tunneling measures, otherwise they would be viable ranking up strategies.
---
Thank you so much this is EXACTLY what I was looking for
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if you can cross the map quickly if you can‚Äôt hit the survivors, but a good killer playing clown can cut a chase to just a couple of seconds
---
It also counters. Pig, t2 myers, 0 terror doc, spirit(sort of) freddy(?) and ghostface as you said
---
so basically stealth killers in general which there are more then 1 of
---
Ah ok I getcha
---
legit everytime

This is some new shit to hear to be honest, why would you chase the guy you're working with for so long? Do they really think the act is that elaborate? or is being nice such a foreign concept to them?
---
Lol ok gg
---
In before...
---
*person that voiced The Pig* "Am I a joke to you?"
---
Well I guess we leave it at that then
---
Oh piss off.
---
The other versions get real weird with the hatches. They'll spawn *anywhere*.
---
Didn‚Äôt say it was a straw man
---
i would honestly love to see legion stalking and chasing jeff everywhere
---
This was my crutch perk when I started playing killer. I still get misses every now and again, but 90% of my attacks hit now, thanks to unrelenting helping me to understand swings.
---
I've never needed it even against stealthy killers.
---
I can tell the killer from their heartbeat, their breathing, and the sound of their footsteps.
---
You can hear Spirit running towards you while in Spirit Form and you can hear Michael's Breathing as he comes close.
---
absolute side-note, but am i the only one who calls it the corrupted fountains "The Hot Sauce?"
---
Also nice 3 man C:
---
Eh never mind. Was trying to refer to people abusing his quirk but it doesn‚Äôt seem too problematic when i think about it
---
At least 1 has to be done, hatch spawns closed if the number if survivors alive are less than the number of gens.
---
So 1 gen and 1 dead survivor is the minimum.
---
Freddy if you don't mind grinding 9000 Shards for Plague
---
it's a mini series tho ? Not something very several seasons.
---
They're both fun and play differently than the other killers.  Kind of a toss up.  One thing I like about Plague is the survivors you go up against will make her games feel very different from each other playstyle wise in one of two ways.  You have the survivors that cleanse that you get to use her corrupts throughout the match to try and get ranged downs OR you get the survivors who don't cleanse and you basically have NOED throughout the match.  Her games feel radically different from each other depending on which way the group goes so she feels fresh and interesting for me.
---
I call it "the disgusting soup" but I call the Corrupt Purge vom itself "the stickiest of icky". The Hot Sauce is better for the pools tho, imma use that
---
I thought it was a framed poster at first. They should make those.
---
Not "you" literally. Come on...... really?
---
"If you're going to call someone out on a strawman fallacy"
---
(If ONE is going to call someone out on a strawman fallacy)
---
I'm talking about Mister TLDR. HE did exactly that.
---
I can hear the DC sound from here.
---
You were the chosen one!!!
---
I don‚Äôt think you understood what I meant, for the hatch to spawn, the amount of survivors+1 is the amount of gens that have to be completed
---
You can just make it "A" or something, sure.
---
Damn No HTML

I am not saying Spirit is weak. I am saying she is not as good as Billy. A good DBD player will destroy with Billy or Spirit. 
---
Most Tier lists put both of them under Nurse basically tied. 
---
Billy is just better, at least to me, because Iron Will takes away Spirit‚Äôs main skill ‚Äúa good headset‚Äù
---
https://youtu.be/3Dvb9bChjN8
---
I think having a movie about each of the killer‚Äôs backstory and then their first time hunting their survivor would be really cool
---
i also like the disgusting soap xD
---
Wraith is my favourite killer and I agree he needs something
---
nancy &gt; steve
---
I have lost track of what this about, I guess it‚Äôs no longer important and thus we should stop talking about it. At best I recall not seeing your logic, and I still stand by that. The situation is better left alone for now, may your day go well.
---
Ranking up system is stupid. Need multiple hits for chaser, meaning you need to let them heal,  let them heal and you lose points for malevolent, if they do gens too fast you don't get gatekeeper points but the only way you can really have a long game without them doin gens and you getting multiple hits is if the survivors are just bad.
---
Absolutely fucked
---
What perks were you using?
---
The only skill you need for spirit is making enough money to buy good headphones
---
Very good edgy, we're all so proud. Now go back to your coloring book
---
My can of beans seeing me at 3 am
---
Plague has better perks and isn't awful at all, might not be as "strong" as Freddy but definitely my preferred kind of playstyle.
---
Get everyone infected, they're now one shottable no matter what, if they cleanse, punish them with ranged hits, repeat the process.
---
Really on Freddy? Interesting pick! Guess I‚Äôm gonna have to stray away from my beloved Huntress to see for myself! I can imagine he‚Äôs a solid killer for points now since he has so many new mechanics.
---
That's still 17 million bloodpoints to get every survivor teachable, 19 million after the new DLC. Not to mention survivor BP gain is trash at around 15000 to 24000 per game. Being generous that's about 42 games with a rough gain of 24000 per match. 42 games to get three teachable, and that's being generous and giving a new player the benefit of the doubt. Realistically it would probably be a lot less each game.
---
It is if the survivor is an absolute twat or a streamer
---
‚ÄúYou literally did nothing but generators.‚Äù
---
Lol.
---
I played when it was only trapper wraith and hillbilly, the most common were wraith and trapper who only scared me some but literally every hillbilly had me on the edge of my seat. Let's just say I'm still scared of billies. When the Halloween chapter dropped in October it was like a whole new world had opened. I know nurse came out before but Myers was different, I knew who he was and the fact that he's almost completely accurate with the movies including the music scared me the most out of any. (not to mention my first game against him was with a Judith's tombstone, so I died in his arms without knowing what happened.)  so yea I guess for us ogs Billy was one of the scariest
---
Lol and a lot think tunneling is always ideal
---
Lol!  The Bloodwarden plays.  As a survivor that perk always cracks me up when it works out.
---
Jokes on you, my skill check button is a macro
---
Theoretically if this happened and BT was active would it stop or delay the death?

OP said a short, not a whole fledged series

Bruh I spent $20 on cells for this skin a month ago. I've been waiting ever since it leaked. FINALLY
---
Ah yes tunnelling
---
I would buy that poster
---
The entity prioritizes taking whichever perk you don‚Äôt take, and will then move along the path attempting to stay as far from the middle as possible. When it reaches a dead end, it‚Äôll take the furtherest available mode from the center first. 
---
This information will all be mostly irrelevant when the bloodwebs get reworked in the next few weeks.
---
But having Ash without Bruce Campbell is just a lose-lose situation.  The others are kinda just characters from movies, but Ash is Bruce, no other way to put it.
---
I don't think mending counts as a healing action so sloppy butcher doesn't work for mending same with nurses calling
---
He is (I think) along with Myers and the Doctor THE anti-noob killer.
---
Just his ability to be almost invisible is guaranteed to make any new players panic because they might not be aware that you can vaguely see him a little bit nor that heartbeats are a thing when he's not cloaked.
---
That makes him looks like he's teleporting out of nowhere to them, espeically if they don't know his power.
---
It‚Äôs so awesome to hear that many of the actors that portrayed characters that made it into DBD would‚Äôve loved to be involved. Hopefully for future licenses we can get more original actors to reprise their roles like Bruce did, I‚Äôd happily settle for the an approved likeness and sound alike though.
---
Lmao are you on. Xbox or play station
---
Platform: Xb1
---
Bug: still the issue where you can walk through the exit gates but the game won‚Äôt register that you escaped lost about 2 matches because of this.
---
I must need a hearing exam lol, didn't know you could hear Michael in stealth. 
---
Spirit is easy to dodge no doubt.
---
I find I can see spinal chill activate before I hear anything in most cases, so I even use it for non-stealthy. 
---
I'm going to try to mix it up though based. On the replies.
---
Those chainsaw attempts at the loops are why Bubbas are my favorite killer to go against.  Free loops?  I don't mind if I do.
---
Just had a facecamping noed doc myself, had to calmly place my controller on my desk and walk away
---
Correct
---
I always down them, slash the air, then start picking them up and dropping them repeatedly so they can wiggle off of me. Normally they understand what I‚Äôm doing.
---
Probably both. Think one pice costs 9000 shards like with all the others.
---
‚ÄúYou did the objective while your team clapped my cheeks, you‚Äôre being punished for it.‚Äù Honestly get good at the game smh
---
yea and i talked about a real tv show
---
As far as the post says, the survivor wasn't a twat. They did gens like they are supposed to do. The killer just decided to camp them because they didn't waste time dealing with them and they did generators instead. That's not being a twat at all.
---
It can be both.
---
Random
---
I have no idea how I'll choose between this and the ice climber set. They're both so great
---
The budget would be astronomical to make this happen.
---
Die
---
Playing gf without noed is asking for abuse
---
I was saying in general
---
Okay...well everyone is talking about movies
---
Should also put that it gives an unnecessary speed boost as well so if you don't find that totem asap it's a guaranteed "gg ez" in that endgame chat.
---
The circus is that way. ‚Äî&gt;ü§°
---
Playstation
---
Ok cool
---
That doesn't explain how it's cool to hook camp streamers though. Not all streamers are bad. Saying it's cool to hook camp streamers is just being biased.
---
I really like serpent and shadow dance. What‚Äôs a pallet?
---
There's something in this game that's call "Balance", you see when a killer has "powers" it needs to have a counter, or something for the survivors to use against the killers, if fucking legion could hit you anytime, see you everytime and jump FUCKING WINDOWS AND PALLETS, all of that + hillbilly speed and no fucking exhaustion it would make it a little overpowered or ANNOYING, just like old legion...
---
Don't want to grind perks out so I just wanted to make an Alt account where I play exclusively Laurie with the Eyes build and see if I can make it to Rank 1. Also I don't want to derank on my actually good account and play SWF with a bunch of Killers way under my level.
---
All you have to do is look at the message thread sequentially, bud. It's all there.
---
okey!!
---
Just said spirit speed instead of hillbilly speed but go off
---
OMG stream sniper tunneled me!
---
The exact reason I don't want to play with that build at high rank is because I don't want to ruin the game for my high rank allies and then derank to "dunk on baby ~~survivors~~ killers" with my real builds.
---
I assume you use headphones, then it's just practice. It's definitely easier on some maps like on Lery's, but things that have ambient noise really can mess with you.
---
Sound is super important in this game. I can hear a lit totem even.
---
Sounds cool and all but saying that the hard work is already done when all there is are digital renders and a few paragraph backstories is about crazy.
---
Oh hey it's someone who feels the need to call random people on Reddit a cunt.
---
No I'd be mad if we were supposed to remember "no using star man power unless you're in last place". If this game isn't competitive, stop inserting weird community rules
---
They‚Äôre not just the clown, but the entire circus.
---
Ahh okay, cheers for clearing it up
---
I'll stop using noed when survivors stop being toxic
---
Spine chill isn't necessary but its very good. A lot of the people who dont run it and diss it play swf and can run adrenawin ect and know their buddies with borrowed time will save them.
---
If youre not a red rank looper with BT buddies to save u its very useful as solo as u can prevent chases/hooks vs any killer.  Ur probably the "stupid rando" anyways and gonna get left on hook.
---
The rest of the world also thinks  the transformers movies are good. Arguing ad populace?
---
Still man I've never been to rank 1. I want to reach it at least once before I stop caring about rank
---
Because streamers need to get exposure before they become bigger names. People in this sub really hate the idea of them being the subject of the (Toxic Streamer TM) and by extension would rather seek to booty blast anyone just because of three letters rather than because of a habitual attitude of someone else.
---
Not true there is usually at least one strong totem spot on all the maps.  They reworked even the old OG maps and some of them are legit incredible spots.  They can't all be gold though that's the risk of Hex perks.  If they were all amazing spots everyone would run them.
---
Agreed. When you advertise in your username it just looks shameless.
---
Source?
---
This happens to every time I even so much of think about lifting my hand off my keyboard.
---
It no longer makes sense to me.
---
Theres nothing weird about it, theres a splinter for pig, Bubba and freddy, I wish they make ghost face tough, and I dont think theyll make the demogorgon either
---
Also I don't understand why Survivors are so proud when they hook trade in the end game and I end up camping someone else to death instead of the person I initially caught. Like lol I have no beef against any of you: just want points. You're giving me more points dude.
---
I was stuck on top of a pallet ounce
---
he said git gud
---
Legend has it they were reworking dwight. "After years of being a joke to everyone and being seen as a baby, he decided to fight back." His new park was going to be like decisive strike except before the killer hits you. You slap him with your ginormous hands and stun the killer for 7 years.
---
They all do, and still do, when played in a certain way.
---
Inner strenght is just too good within the meta, so that will pretty much be the new adrenalin
---
I‚Äôd play someone like trapper for a bit to get the basics of killer, then try nurse again because nurse is one of the hardest killers.
---
Also if you haven‚Äôt played any survivor, do it because it helps you figure out how a killer should play. Try watching some you tubers and streamers to see how they play
---
You can turn off chat but idk how because I‚Äôm not on pc
---
I never understood why people get upset over playing against streamers. Sure they can be toxic, but that can be said about any player. Seems kinda rude to explicitly target them because they're trying to hustle.
---
Beside the chat box it should show a little arrow. If I'm remembering correctly you click on it to hide the chat and click on it to show it again. 
---
The match making system has been really crazy lately so they'll hopefully fix it that way you'll be with survivors closer to your rank. 
---
Playing in the kyf lobby allows for more practice as every perk/addons etc. is unlocked during it. I'm more of a survivor main occasionally playing killer but if you ever need someone to try kyf out or something just send me a message and I'll be glad to help :)
---
Legion and Cannibal definitely  
---
Doc and Clown, yeah I could see that but carefully  
---
No love for the Pig?
---
Ya probably but I'll be a Nancy
---
All of which can have creative liberties taken with them. The movie trial would probably not function on the exact rules of the game‚Äôs trials.
---
Nah plenty of killer mains think you're a clown for camping too I'm sure.
---
Watch gameplay of the killer on YouTube
---
Sorry, I'm not going to recollect it for you.
---
I can't believe you actually just compared Doctor to Nurse. Nobody is gone be taking you seriously
---
Not sure about pig I don't play her much so I can't say.
---
Legion and Cannibal need something to help pressure the map and need some more mobility options and Clown needs more tools to help him in a Chase since that's supposed to be his main gimmick I made a post about reworking clown and giving him multiple bottle types
---
Damn. Ive been stuck in a pallet lmao
---
Well you're wrong then
---
I can hear me missing it cause I decided to look away for a split second lol
---
It really depends on your playstyle, platform, and if you‚Äôre a fan of any horror or slasher characters. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs always best to get characters that you like or are visually/aesthetically pleasing to you, don‚Äôt worry about what‚Äôs meta or top tier especially if you‚Äôre new.
---
Do have some dollars to throw at me? I don't even have money for the upcoming stranger things dlc, I hate my life it's so broken.
---
&gt; It's seen as OK to do in other games.
---
It isn't though. It's exactly as frowned upon in every community. Can you cite some sources other than "people do it"?
---
I was subtracting the 3k spent to have the entity consume it :)
---
He covers open maps so damn fast man.
---
Definitely  a 4k match let the last survivor go so you must not know that you cant  let your team die and just be a gen jockey
---
ok...
---
Also he wasnt punished he was just killed

---
No one kept the hook if you read and understood what happened is he was mad that he did all the far generators while his team was getting killed and then when he got hooked it was in the middle of three generators in close proximity with one left all I had to do was literally walked between those three with him in the middle of it being hooked waiting on the next Survivor because he had no choice but to do it
---
Running from one gen to another you usually stumble upon a dull totem though so you don't really have to search them, and even if not totems aren't hidden except on preschool so
---
I‚Äôll say it again man. Three hook rescues. One was a basement save, whom you immediately tunnelled and downed when I tried to take aggro.
---
Gg wp
---
I have this exact same thing happened to me the other day, I was laughing so hard they got away

Yes, because we are talking about marketing and what makes a good/successfully game, in which case if people enjoy it and it sells, then it's good.
---
[Also most people don't like the new transformers](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/transformers_the_last_knight_2017)

If people didn't like DS multiplayer, people wouldn't play it

Look up wow such gaming why you wouldn't survive dead by daylight it's a bit long but worth it
---
Buddy, you must never play survivor. SOMEONE has to do gens if they want to get out, it‚Äôs the objective. Big brain survivors split the work, some altruistic and some objective, you just got what seems like salty for the other survivors so you proxy camped someone doing work? s m h
---
YES! YES! YES! YES! YES!
---
Learning the nurse will serve you in more ways than just a perk, so I say you do.
---
Thanks!
---
Your memory of this match is pretty bad bro. Lol.
---
Lol killer mains still complain about ds it's very funny..  both sides have perks that help them progress in the game.. stop tunneling and it wont effect ya .
---
Thank you :3
---
No survivors are bad at all unless we're getting down to top optimization like grunts of pain and easiness to hide, but you can use any and all perks on any survivor so there's no difference to them outside of what I just said and if you're new to the game, those aren't gunna factor in a lot, you can still do good even with those.
---
Yes!!!
---
I figured it‚Äôd be a little better than a rank six. I‚Äôm a little disappointed, honestly.

Yeah, ou learn some basics as a killer that also work when playing her, just as how you get better at eing survivor/killer by playing the other role, but in the ned if you want to really use her, you'll need to give her time.
---
You don‚Äôt find it sad that you‚Äôve taken to posting it all over Reddit ?
---
This is very thought out, but every time Alien is mentioned, you have to think this thing is incredibly fast, incredibly strong, and lore wise to Alien, a killing machine. It's similar to Freddy, a dream demon, being looped by a herbology student. But I do have mixed feelings about it, since I love the Alien series and would love to see a Xenomorph in the game.
---
Proxy Camp him because he did generators I didn't give him the hatch because I didn't deem him Worthy. His partner who literally could have let him die on hook and found that has his self Sprint it out there to get him and by that show that he was trying his best to make sure no one was left behind and I let him Escape
---
I'd love to see something like this, would be a great facecamp counter
---
To protect the world from devastation
---
To be honest, start playing with other killers first, cause if you start with nurse there's a huge learning curve but once you get good at nurse, because you only learned to play game breaking nurse, its a lot harder to get a hang of other killers, cause they need to actually worry about pallets and such, and some don't have nearly as good map pressure as nurse.
---
Surrender now or prepare for a Toxic Flashlight!
---
That doesn't sound good At All
---
A buff to make her very strong could be that whwn in stealth mode she has 3rd person view would help her stealth abilities abd it wouldn't be that game breaking since she doesn't have that much Chase power
---
Or just hear me out... hook them all twice before moring them? Crazy I know but you can do it
---
Getting bloody cosmetics

Where are the exploding gens?
---
I‚Äôm not even mad bro. I just got four random friend requests. I‚Äôm actually famous. Thnx.
---
No problem don't worry I'll just kill all survivors for now on Save the trouble of it
---
Not generally since nurse changes the way the game is played a good bit. 
---
I personally just recommend playing her and practicing, if you really wanted to figure out her blinks without going into a game, just get a friend, load up KYF, and just blink around until you get how the distance vs charge time works as well as the chain blink window and range.
---
Interesting. I made a less good version of this post last night and look.
---
Yeah, I just got ghostface and Legion and have been having a blast with them even though they aren't that good apparently
---
Hag spooks me
---
Saying you were talking about streamers in general only makes it worse. You're basically saying that, no matter what, you'll camp someone who is (a) just trying to have fun and share the experience, (b) just trying to make a living, or (c) just trying to make some extra cash on the side just because they're a streamer. How would you even know it's a streamer? What are you going to do? Search their name on Twitch or Youtube. You gotta be doing something, because not everyone has TTV in their name. What about people who have it in their name but aren't streaming? You gonna camp them too? Take your vendetta against streamers somewhere else.
---
*teeth
---
Otherwise, once you get the hang of other killers, its just trial and error for the nurse, a good video to explain how she works is the nurse casefile by bricky.
---
Post a link here so we all can watch it please
---
Really to be honest, anything that's not a direct nerf might as well be a buff to the pig lol
---
‚ÄúPaaaaaaaaah‚Äù
---
(EXPLOSION)
---
Let‚Äôs just keep in mind 20 seconds beforehand the roles were reversed and it was my buddy on the hook and I got the save being the one and only unhooked survivor.
---
Y u so mad bro
---
She reminded me of a DMC character
---
I find it sad that you're trying to justify camping someone just because they were actually doing the objective and not running around doing nothing like an idiot.
---
Cosmetics
---
She should have kept her pre endgame collapse bear traps
---
STREAMER BAD
---
Spirit
---
No because most streamers with the exception of one jake I saw have been toxic so don‚Äôt blame me for thinking that
---
Once a spirit had HG and NOED and I only knew one HG spot, when I found the "NOED" I started doing it. In 99% I heard the actual NOED be destoryed and I didnt had time to stop the HG and got her +2 kills.

Show the whole conversation, what did you say to him before?
---
You dont have to play as her to level her up. All the teachables I unlocked for killers I played as Freddy because im good with him and hes my main. I did the same with survivors, i main ash but have unlocked a lot of teachables from other survivors. Just gotta work with whatever perk build you have at the time until you get that perfect build youre going for. And yes of course if you happen to be lucky enough to see it in the shrine then go ahead and grab it. I grinded for almost all my perks through bloodpoints and now im seeing them pop up in the shrine so a get an easy 150k BP right there.
---
Nope, I‚Äôm not going to make a public post for people to see other players PSN names.

Demz the rulez. Don‚Äôt want you reporting me.

I‚Äôve DM‚Äôed it out already to a few people. And I‚Äôll say it again. If you wanna see it, DM me.

Hag was the first and only jumpscare. First time I played her I actually jumped back.
---
I used it when I first started and thought it made nurses stun on missed blinks shorter.
---
Large doggo boi
---
Yes each match will add up the total time
---
I enjoy playing as the Plague, though I‚Äôve used Freddy a few times. Plague can puke and hit you with it from afar which is pretty useful when you‚Äôve got corrupt purge going. Her perks are also really good imo, I like corrupt intervention because you can get the survivors to group closer to you for at least a little while. Infectious fright is great when you have deerstalker because you can leave the survivor to slug another one near you and come back to hook the first one. I don‚Äôt really use her other perk too much. She‚Äôs also pretty tall which is decent. 
---
So yeah that‚Äôs what I got on that, let me know which one you end up getting!
---
But they specifically stated Switch?
---
Nah you can see three other auras
---
I want to see a comic strip of legion with heart and head problems being tended by the nurse and doctor, but it gets really serious and all the other legion members come and give balloons and get well soon cards and stuff like that.

I‚Äôm on now and it‚Äôs embarrassing af
---
He wasn't bming, he dropped ace mulitple times before, he then waited for Ace to crawl close to a hook, but failed

Ight just add me and I'll add u back
---
Bloodwebs seem to be better but I don't know for certain
---
Unpopular opinion, I prefer Gf
---
Those are event cakes, they give a bit more than escape cakes and don‚Äôt require you to escape, idk how much they give though
---
For me it‚Äôs Trapper and it feels so good
---
Is it the same as your reddit name?
---
What I tried to do was to mimic the alien from Alien: Isolation. Especially his saliva-dropping death-spots, but you can play AS the alien.
---
Also, if you have read the ‚Äúhow to play part‚Äù, he will be a good chaser. Pretty much, he can pull off the Hag strategy ‚Äî place the trap, to make the loop impossible. Yeah, he will be quite good, but more of a mind-game ambush kind, and less of TP to chase type. 
---
About incredibly fast part ‚Äî he can move between the spots and enter the spots in no time. Pretty much instantly disappearing. As for the strong part ‚Äî all killers in DbD are pretty much immortal, and break pallets as if they are nothing, as well as carrying people with one hand... I think that, overall, it goes with the fantasy quite well.
---
He probably should have just let you bleed out on the floor.
---
*high rank survivors that don‚Äôt teabag*
---
Oh well
---
You‚Äôre*
---
Considering how clearly planned this was, yeah it's also remarkably awkward..why go to the effort to essentially 'script' the video if you're gonna call take one a masterpiece?
---
Awkward
---
Thanks
---
Yes, but you sacrifice control to do so. If you don't hit the survivor when you stop (and it's very easy to dodge his attack), they get plenty of time to run away before the chainsaw swing animation ends. Not a great tradeoff. And it can be downright useless on some maps, like Gideon or L√©ry's.
---
It's what she deserves
---
Is no one going to address that font?
---
This is so accurate.
---
It's not just made up community stuff, there's plenty of penalties for camping and tunneling, and plenty of rewards for not doing it.
---
Sitting on top of a survivor until they die on their first hook is literally just admitting you don't have the skill to catch them enough times to kill them by playing properly.
---
[Also](https://i.giphy.com/media/kvcqO3ojVie2I/giphy.webp)
---
I keep pressing space until i'm completely unhooked.
---
Yes! I would love to see a movie about the Hag. Lisa‚Äôs whole story is so interesting and tragic. And there‚Äôs potential for right at the end, after she draws the mark in the ground for the entity to appear (just slightly) from the mark
---
Watch you tubers and streamers, try to get good at looping. Looping is the main skill aspect of the game, as skill checks aren‚Äôt really a problem, you‚Äôll improve with greats overtime. The rest of the game is decision making, this is another thing watching streamers and you tubers will help with, when to do gens, when to save, and the best way to play against every killer.
---
What am I looking at?
---
he look like trex
---
Usually it's hidden when I play survivor but when I play killer is Always appears
---
well, Halloween fans will pick Laurie, ST fans will choose Steve, you can't really compare them, asking who's better
---
i, personally, prefer Laurie but i'm not gonna say that she's better than Steve since i haven't watched ST
---
Smoking Splinter, the offering that allows me to play as Freddy and keeps appearing in my bloodwebs despite how I've owned Freddy for months.
---
Ya they shouldn‚Äôt but they do I even have Myers on Myers lmao
---
It‚Äôs not cheating it‚Äôs just dbd‚Äôs horrible matchmaking working against you. I had a game like this as survivor where there was me(rank 12), a rank 4, a rank 6, and a rank 16 vs a rank 16 killer. This isn‚Äôt even as bad as it gets either
---
matchmaking is fucked rn, but even if it wasnt they have literally zero control over what killer they go against, or your rank. how is that cheating?
---
Auric Cells Only #Hype :D
---
Oh alright. I was just asking cos it was a lil blurry

I do this all the time I made it most use perk , take a L with a smack to your face. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yep I hope the dedicated server matchmaking will be a lot better for new players.
---
i love how he didnt even look at his friend who got hit he just started swinging. good friend
---
I‚Äôm assuming you mean as far as counter play against console killers, as the rest of the game is identical and watching you tubers won‚Äôt help you adjust to the controls.
---
Gen grabs are broken for everyone? I thought it was just me lmao
---
There is a glitch that makes pallets appear when they are broken, could be that?
---
Oh that is bad to hear. All other games have been decently balanced.
---
I believe they only show up if you didn't buy the whole dlc not just the singular killer I could be wrong about that though. Did you buy Freddy with auric cells or did you get the whole chapter?
---
more or so like movement jukes. i can 360 on both but on pc they never hit and i seem to get hit all the time on console
---
I didn't notice the skull in the Nurse's Calling symbol for a long time

All my other games where balanced. I assumed they could fool the system that they where lower rank or so.
---
holy shit that was so funny
---
You can only be in one place at a time. When you're phasing to a totem for a survivor who may or may not even be there, you're basically hoping no one is doing gens. Eventually people will catch on that you're just vigilant on totems and just rush gens. Any basic swf could have one guy run around tapping totems and you won't get to know any better.
---
I bought Freddy with cells. However, that's still pretty stupid that they appear regardless.
---
Hell yeah and an escape cake! It‚Äôs gonna be raining bloodpoints during my next SWF
---
Clown could Just not... He need massive buffs since he is really weak, but it's not fun to play against, is literally runing to each pallet till people do all gens
---
Well if they allow instant moris in the exit gate then I want survivors to get to survive if a killer leaves someone on the ground during end game. Goes both ways, killers are just as bad sometimes.
---
Where does it mention dbd?
---
It's true tho. Just having a character look like Ash isn't enough, he has to be voiced/played by Bruce Campbell.  The developers knew this and went the extra mile to get in him specifically in the game. 
---
I'm not playing this game because Quentin is in it, and they know that.
---
nope. no way to do that as far as im aware
---
‚ÄúEvery move you make, I‚Äôll be watching you‚Äù

Yeah, to be fair I haven't played as much lately. I haven't experienced any really bad match making, but you're right, I have seen screenshots of unfortunate match making. Hope the servers etc fix this for the sake of the potentially new player base.

not many killers have really jumpscared me anymore after one match against them. But then there's myers and everytime he peeks around the corner i just can't help but scream, i also think i rely too much on spine chill

No, David said that he wanted to use whatever the most modern interpretation was, because in his mind that is what they are now.

Of course, they threw that out the window for Leatherface and didn‚Äôt say shit about it, but this is BHVR we‚Äôre talking about....
---
Oh alright then
---
Might not have wanted to spend money on that, plus what would she really even do besides record a few grunts
---
Leave me alone &gt;~&lt;
---
Controversial as fuuuuuck I love it
---
I understand if the killer makes it to the hook and just sees 2 sets of scratch marks and picks one to go after, but the ones Im referring to is the ones that hide just outside of the terror radius and watch me get unhooked and immediately go after me. Its obviously deliberate
---
Oh definitely. Plus bloodhunt is happening soon so go wild man
---
Why not both?
---
Tenacity buff looking good
---
That's not bad with how messed up match making is right now.
---
Yea it is but it could be way way worse
---
I'd say the biggest appeal is for people with a little experience and a few choice DLC, who are considering buying another DLC. They like 1-2 perks and/or the killer, but don't want to slog down their future bloodwebs with 3+ terrible perks. The drawback takes away from the excitement of acquiring a new 'toy'.
---
I wonder how many sales BHVR has lost because the person decided it would be too much of a pain in the ass.
---
i just realised that the demogorgon is gonna be in the samination videos. cant wait
---
Demogorgon
---
Because salty sailors who only main one or the other role are offended
---
Yep. 
---
At the start of the match you find 3 gens that are close to each other and you sit around those gens.
---
You shock them to tier 3 madness so they can't interact with anything (they run Order + Calm add ons + distressing so you get 25% more madness from the passive effect of his power in his terror radius, while his terror radius is like half of the map). You run a mori and hook someone close to your 3 gens so there is only 1 survivor per gen -&gt; easier to manage the pressure.
---
Random skillcheck spawn + Overcharge skillcheck + Unnverving presence making the skillcheck smaller make it really hard to get any progress on gen when you actually get to interact with it.
---
If you aren't in a coordinated 4 man swf on comms you usually won't be able to coordinate with your teammates to split gen pressure well enough. I've seen a hostage match go for almost 2 hours once, people just disconnected. The doc's name was something like Hex : Disconnect.
---
He just... nvm
---
Depends on their P3 and how loud their grunts are at least for me, but probably Nancy
---
Lol the ones who say that would have anyways
---
I love all of them but idk man Steve lookin real nice
---
Don‚Äôt act like this game wasn‚Äôt farming with survivors
---
Wow downvoted for asking a simple question, nice one guys.
---
Had a team completely genrished me and got mad when I camped the Meg when the gate was open right next to her. Still depipped but I got my bp
---
Again, downvoted for simple questions. Wtf is your guys' problem
---
Yea it does but they still seem kinda bad plus you kinda have to make sure you're teammates aren't also altruistic for them to work efficiently
---
Wait till blood hunt and then it‚Äôll be extra juicy
---
He looks kinda not great. Id say with the right tweaks we could have another freddy situation where they turn a really meh killer into a really solid one. Well have to see tho, as if the pounce is good, or at least better than it looks, he could have some real potential.
---
r/unexpectedthanos
---
gg ez bby killer hehe xo
---
Yea honestly I was not expecting this and I was super hyped when I saw it I'm definitely maining him
---
Yah that is how it should be in my opinion, for me I just dont enjoy it cuz it makes the games too easy otherwise now lol xD
---
Maybe it could be three trials, with three different killers and three different locations. He escapes each time, stumbling into the next trial so quickly that he thinks this is all one big nightmare, not realizing the ways they're distinctly separate.
---
Someone on his first team dies, and everyone else escapes to the next one. Then everyone but him dies and he escapes through the hatch. And in the third one, he meets the one who died in the first trial, who finally manages to explain the situation to him. Then the entire team dies, before he wakes up next to a bonfire.
---
Dying Light should always apply to the highest ranked survivor imo
---
Papa Dweet
---
We don't even fully know all the details yet. Wait until the PTB before you start forming a real opinion.
---
I wonder if they'd ever consider redoing her voice c: that'd be so cool.
---
I'm going to go with Steve.
---
I don't 360 I just fake left and go right in console
---
So pallet-looping is bullying? Gotcha.
---
Legacy Dwight‚Äôs are worse
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking. So anime level dramatic
---
I guess I‚Äôve bullied someone in the first 10 seconds of a match before then...Good to know.
---
Steve got whooped by Billy, Whooped by Jonathan.
---
Laurie built traps all over her house, trained herself in shooting guns and using weapons and took out the entity evil known as Michael.
---
we all know what is and isn‚Äôt bullying, don‚Äôt act like I‚Äôm being ridiculous when I say that
---
Lol how do you bully a killer? You mean playing the game?
---
You know you're in for a bad time when the Dying Light is a Technician gamer.
---
The Detective Tapp skin, is based off of the Saw video game and the video game didn't ask so... Probably not.
---
i always thought it was a flexing arm with a wax mountain on it - never questioned it until now haha
---
No one's forcing you lol, go face camp all you want. Your guaranteed to lose and get no points, but what's going to happen? Someone gets mad and msgs you?
---
It's also because Bruce Campbell owns Ash. They technically couldn't not make Ash without his permission.
---
I only have one question what type of building are you using run unrelenting.
---
I have one character like level 25 don‚Äôt really play much oof
---
Yeah and now face camped by a Billy because I run him for 4 gens in Thompson's House... I see that today is not my luckiest day
---
Agreed.
---
loving is so far ;D as a feng main i think you're doing a fantastic job.
---
I've heard it also makes you die faster on second hook.
---
Try getting one on survivor tho
---
Face camp intensifies
---
Jesus Christ the image looks nuked.
---
&gt; What if you had Deliverance
---
What if?
---
Wowwwww how you gonna do me dirty like that I earned this one trusttttüò≠
---
Dude my first match was with a rank 1 my dude
---
Hahahaha I would‚Äôve been in tears laughing, this post and seeing wholesome killer stories makes the dbd community look so fun!
---
Lol I know it was a shitty picture that I took too quick and couldn't be bothered to take a new one XD
---
Those statistics are wrong. It's more like 50% of the time, the killer is just being a douche even if you're not toxic
---
Realist is the term. The dogs ran away, Nancy and Jonathan did the prep work of the original Demo.
---
Steve? Gets beat up by Jonathan AND Billy. Sweetie, Steve ain‚Äôt shit. Laurie &gt; Steve. Period.
---
But bbq and chill :[  I main trapper and bought bubba for the perk so figured I had to try him very underwhelming
---
Teabagging and emoting is pretty much all I can think of. Maybe bullying. That's all as far as I can remember.
---
Did they say if the outfits going to be buyable with shards or locked behind a paywall?
---
I mostly play killer but try to play both equally and I think no one escapes death is a necessity in the current state of the game but it's very easy to tell when it's coming. It's a perk that basically means you don't have to learn to play the killer right and get rewarded for failure. But it's also a counter to high ranks partnering up with low rank friends and stomping new killers or flat-out terrible matchmaking.
---
Personally I think there should be a complete totem overhaul.
---
1. Killers should know which totem is which. Each perk will have its own color of Aura and the totem that is selected to have that perk will have the aura color so the killer knows which ones to protect.
---
2. Totem counter. Not everybody knows about small game or can rely on their teammates. A totem counter would be pretty handy for solo players. Especially low ranks who are new to the game and don't know the totem spawns or how many there are.
---
3. Totems need a complete aesthetic overall. Right now they have a small handful of spawn points and are usually out in the open. They are very big and stick out like a sore thumb. I think they should be much smaller and more hidden, with new spawn locations as well to make the totem counter more of a necessity and more important. I think they should somewhat resemble the Trappers bear traps. Small but not tiny and noticeable once close.
---
Hex totems should also take longer than dull totems. Perhaps even having one overcharge skill check that will either Grant a speed boost if hit right or alert the Killer upon being missed.
---
4. Finally don't spawn totems on Hills or by generators. That's just stupid.
---
Looks like Debbie Pelt from True Blood.

*Oinks commendingly*
---
I agree with what you're saying
---
Nurse easily. Much harder to play nurse tho.
---
Survivor bad, killer good
---
What is Scream not it?
---
Why don't you credit that for next the couple of weeks. This meme format will be dank in no time. It basically already is.
---
You.... Became a tv?
---
Finally might start playing Kate now that she has an outfit where she doesn't stick out from a mile away
---
They? More than one killer?
---
Oh no I use it because they're usually gods and I want a chance
---
That sucks. Atleast you didn't have a spirit DC while having two BPS offered
---
I appreciate this.
---
Thank you! It‚Äôs my favorite skin she has!
---
&gt;I don't think most people go out of their way to kill any specific Survivor
---
I go out of my way to target Quentins. Like why are you picking Quentin? He's so disgusting ugly and still has shit perks? Get your dumb ass out my game, Quentin.
---
I love how you drew everyone in this comic it's so cute
---
Nurse is the best killer in the game.  Without a doubt
---
That mask looks nice, all the ones I see at stores look all shitty :/
---
Nurse has the stronger power, but it has a higher learning curve to use really well. Her power requires a lot of play to learn to gauge blink distance based on charge (muscle memory), as well as blink strategy and what certain landscape elements do to your blink.
---
Spirit you can learn relatively quickly and do well, and the finer details of mindgame you can pick up fairly quick.
---
Oh I think I see it! The thing that looks like fingers in the top left corner is actually an ear, right?
---
thanks cuntbag
---
- If the killer is chasing you do NOT unhook someone. In fact dont even run near a hooked survivor, the best thing you can do for the team is run away from the hook so that other survivors can unhook without the killer going for an instant tunnel.
---
- Always loop before dropping a pallet if possible. If there is a window nearby, incorporate that into the loop before dropping the pallet
---
- if you know for sure you‚Äôre going to take a hit when dropping a pallet, dont drop the pallet. The speed burst from the hit will boost you to the next pallet safely, and it saves the pallet for future use
---
- Cleanse any dull totems you see
---
It's a playstyle that he's the best at, so people who want to play that way are going to be drawn to LF over other killers.
---
Np
---
A Dwight showing our power, good.
---
then do gens. or pay attention when unhooking
---
What in God‚Äôs name does this mean
---
No. Nea is a piece shit. Her backstory she‚Äôs a criminal, the majority of people that play her in game are toxic assholes. I don‚Äôt care about your cute little Nea is the killer, Nea is ugly banter. Not everything is a meme.
---
I can‚Äôt it single handily blinded me
---
Dweet needs to learn to look behind him more
---
Le skull is the power to murder, is physically possible to kill without le skull
---
I was swf with the second guy but probably the third guy was swf with the rank 16. Anyways, not my fault.
---
All of these names are hilarious
---
I must be having a stroke because I‚Äôm not understanding any part of what‚Äôs being said here
---
okay and??
---
Le skull kill men. Without hook with le skull and without le skull no kill only kill hook
---
I did manage to get it *once* today, but only because the killer was passing by. Not trying to open my locker.
---
Combine it with Alert. Oof.
---
r/expectedthanos for balance.
---
But there are other ways to kill. 4/10 shitpost
---
I've been harassed by his fans and he acts like a bitch when he streams. Likes to ragequit when killers use add-ons/perks he disapproves of.
---
Why no kill without le skull? Why no kill anyway?
---
Spirit benefits the most as her power is reliant on it. 
---
Spirit is only really broken with higher power addons. Without them, the power does not last long enough for great map pressure and has a large cool down. Some indication or Tell does need to be added to spirit. Right now it is just a guessing game for survivors. They don‚Äôt have any ground/grass movement to visually tell where she is and if she is moving. Mind games are basically just sit still. Takes a lot of skill to do that. 
---
Let‚Äôs be honest though, at higher ranks they use the addons that make her basically broken.
---
I can go with saying Billy is the best killer that is not completely unfair.
---
Every time I hear ghost face get pallet stunned all I think about is, ah shit, here we go again
---
The survivor doesn‚Äôt just drop the pallet immediately. They loop the killer around it, using the window vault to their advantage too. Yeah the killer breaks it as soon as you drop it- but that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt drop unless you need to.
---
But man with weapon can just smack and dead then stab and dead forever
---
I think it's a lore question "You need to burn a mori (a chained skull) to kill survivors, but what would happen if a killer killed a survivor without one?"
---
Doesnt matter. One person cant do the gens alone, low rank survivors dont do gens and just farm each other off hooks hoping the killer wont tunnel the next time
---
Wear a headset, equip anal beads, bathe in the salt
---
Dont forget they all have NOED too
---
Matchmaking it horrible rn. I was in a red rank swf with one purple and the killer was a rank 15. It was just sad.
---
Listen. Audio is everything while phasing. Typically, you use the cries to zero in, and then use footsteps to identify their exact location. Also, consider playing mind games that make the survivors think you're phasing when you're really just standing still.
---
I want bikini meg
---
hopefully the dlc doesn't release after rank reset
---
Ouch....everyone got more BP than him too...
---
Probably horrible torture at the hands of the entity. Spider-Boi doesn‚Äôt like it.
---
I really hope this is b8
---
You can cuss in the internet...
---
Gen rushing is survivors doing generators
---
Ok. What about scratch mark jukes?
---
What‚Äôs really sad is that if they had just waited six months the Epic Game Store would have been up and probably offered them a lot more money for an exclusive. I‚Äôm guessing the Discord deal wasn‚Äôt nearly as good.
---
How about no.
---
Yeah, the killer always has to break it which giver you plenty if time to run away
---
Why are you booing me, Im right
---
The killers obey the will of the Entity. If the Entity gives them permission to kill with their own hand, they do. If the entity does not give them that permission, they do not. 
---
If a killer disobeys, then the Entity is evidently willing to torture the killers for disobedience.
---
You clearly don't play killer very much. 
---
The only people that benefit in they way you think they would benefit, are those that only play a single killer and never play a different one.
---
You got me on that one...
---
Your opinion does suck
---
I feel for you man, its hard being a killer main and wanting to have fun when survivors can just dc and get 0 punishment for it unless they're doing it every single game. It doesn't even feel fulfilling to win when a survivor DC's because the survivors had to play with a handicap after the fact. I can't wait for something to be implemented that punishes this type of shit.
---
This sounds like she was letting me escape but she wasn't. She let me wiggle intentionally to see if i landed in the exit
---
You're talking about a team not working together, which is a separate problem and not the fault of a camping killer. Camping isn't good, but you can't say there's not options if players don't take them.
---
They get SMACC
---
I'm not sure on the distance/escape thing. It's called god pallet because the killer is forced to kick it once it's thrown, there's no feasible mind-game the killer can do unless they're Nurse, Spirit and Huntress, other than those, they just have to kick it.
---
Baby Trapper just wants to have some fun
---
Except that russian
---
How dare you insult King Steve
---
Yeah I like Nancy better.
---
Pretty sure the mods remove all those posts when they see them
---
Yeah this is a product of SwF and a red tank playing with a newbie. Honestly, there have been other threads like this where the killer is roughly rank 14-10 and they just get bullied but the survivors. Not fair.
---
Thicken up that dark mist pilgrim! The entity has got more deer stalker perks for you as well!
---
Steve is funny tho, Laurie cant take a joke
---
Adding to this because I agree with some of it, if I disconnect its normally because...
---
1) Theres a weak connection between me and the killer. It looked fine in the lobby thats why I joined but something has changed in game. Vaulting a window, then getting teleported back over it and hit, or just being teleported backwards a few metres towards the killer. I‚Äôm not going to play if I can‚Äôt defend myself.
---
2) Bugs. Less common but it happens. I used to get stuck in trees I would walk past until they fixed that. Since the Gf chapter though I‚Äôll sometimes have the game completely freeze up for like 60 seconds after dropping a pallet or vaulting a window. Rare when it happens and no idea what causes it but again i‚Äôm not playing if I cant defend myself. Whats the point? Lets not forget the current bug where you cant heal yourself, which also tends to lead to the cant pass through the exit gates bug
---
3) Using a toxic build. Seen a fair few omegablink and 4-5 blink Nurses with NOED, Ruin and ebony moris recently. Thats the ‚Äúi cant stand losing build‚Äù. Shit like that just sucks the fun out of the game for the other side to compensate for the killers small penis.
---
4) Teammates. This is a big reason. As killer you wont see what the rest of us see. A disconnect and im gone. Why should I stay in a game where im at a disadvantage from the start because someone else rage quit? Ive tried to play on but its always the same recently. Survivor disconnects about a minute in, next one suicides on first hook, killer then goes full tryhard slugging for the 4k. Everyone has had a shitty game, just because you never get to 4k it doesnt mean you‚Äôve done shit to earn one in this game. Dont slug and make everyone wait after they‚Äôve been kind enough to stay in so you could carry on your game. Likewise if someone has disconnected then you dont need to tunnel someone else out of the game either you fucking chumps. I see this so much. You‚Äôve been giving a HUGE advantage yet still feel the need to ruin the game for someone else.
---
On top of that you see teammates that go afk, ones that blow up your gen 5 times with failed skillchecks, ones that farm each other off hooks in front of the killer withou even BT - this farming is a big one. Right now the ranks are fucked and im constantly put with rank 18-20s. It sucks knowing that if I put in a lot of effort and play really well im still going to die with 1 gen done because my team played like a group of suicidal lemmings. Whats the point in trying?
---
Then you get teammates that troll. That purposefully blow up gens, bodyblock, farm on purpose, give away your location etc
---
But could something that only ever released on Discord be said to have ever truly lived?
---
Yea that‚Äôs mostly stuff that comes with you tubers, I‚Äôd recommend no0b3 although his uploads are slow rn, and the tutorials by ussyllis are pretty good. It also comes with time, you‚Äôll eventually be able to remember which pallets are safe and the best way to loop the ‚Äújungle gyms‚Äù or the randomly spawning maptiles that always contain a pallet.
---
Find it before they do.
---
check your messages
---
For the cosmetics, and the increased odds of better stuff in your blood webs
---
The hatch spawns once there are two gens left, if you can find it and memorize where it is before the last survivor is remaining, you can run over to it and close it before they get a chance to jump.through it.
---
Also if you and the survivor are standing on top of the hatch waiting for it to open, spam spacebar or whatever your action button is cuz you can close it before they finish jumpimg through
---
Yeah someone genuinely downvoted me for that, I‚Äôm assuming OP
---
It's not, the mods are actually removing these posts from the page due to way over usage and spamming.
---
Yeah.
---
You were not supposed to find out so easily
---
But yes
---
I think GF is a stronger killer personally. The ability to control each individuals exposed status combined with the crouch/stealth/no stain mechanic, he‚Äôs just fun and solid all around. I‚Äôd just tweak that downed or hooked survivors can‚Äôt break his stealth and then he would be perfect. Overall I find GF pretty balanced and decently strong without being ridiculous like Nurse.
---
Find the hatch first and close it. (Listen for the ominous sound). You used to be able to hatch grab but they removed that when they introduced closing the hatch.
---
*internal screaming*
---
I am usually a wholesome player and don't do such things, but quite literally being lagged out of a locker I knew I vaulted was just cutting the line of my wholesomeness game play.
---
ok bud lol
---
I have been there several times before.
---
I'd love to see an episode where the a Russian battalion is trekking through the snowy woods on a mission, when one by one they are picked off by the Huntress.
---
The Nurse's descent into madness, with her night at Crotus Penn where she slaughtered everyone.
---
Wraith's difficult life leading to the murder, and then him being slowly broken by the Entity once he enters the Fog
---
This stuff writes itself
---
nah
---
Unfortunately the only way to counter it is to be lucky enough to find it before them
---
I wasn‚Äôt sure at first, I just thought maybe he was doing a daily and he didn‚Äôt play Trapper much, but then I realised, he was a baby trapper, I felt awful afterwards. I even flashlight saved I deserved to die for what I did
---
i want not to be matched with rank 2 survivors as a rank 14 killer
---
It worse when you haven‚Äôt even seen him the entire time, so it means he stalked up on someone else then decided to take it out on you
---
# machine gun build flashback intensifies
---
no stop cosplay cringe
---
That‚Äôs an uno reverse card if i‚Äôve ever seen one
---
I will pray for you to reach 420 ! In years
---
Wow, you really can't take a loss, can you? Truth is, nothing I can say will convince you. Your idiocy is that firmly rooted in your thick skull. I honestly doubt you even watched the show, referring to the Mind Flayer as the "entity". Good grief. Steve is a hero and a fighter that is always there when shit is about to get really bad. Steve will ***always*** be better than Laurie. You just will never admit that a granny who wasted her whole life at the shooting range and turning her house into the home alone house is better than a stupid teenager with a bitchin‚Äô haircut. End of story, ***"baby"***.
---
Thank you so much i cant believe it looks so good either!
---
Sums up the Doctor experience. I'm a doc main and it's not that often, but I do seemingly get DC's sometimes the second they realize I'm playing the doc. You don't really see this for any other killer besides nurse occasionally.
---
And? So did Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone. Macaulay Culkin is the best survivor in the game! Wow, what a revelation!
---
&gt; the hatch spawns once there are two gens left
---
Wrong, the hatch spawns when you complete one more gen then there are people alive. 4 alive = 5 gens hatch spawns etc
---
Well its hidden but there is not much option of what can be there is like 4 se rey ofrends
---
See I‚Äôm the opposite I can never find the hatch so I‚Äôm stuck with the killer camping the exits making it so damn hard for me to win...
---
Not at all. This is an absolutely delusional claim, and a disgrace to what this meme format should be
---
They talked about this a long ass time ago. Maybe two years ago. It might happen by 2020? No one knows.
---
I have never seen this bug before but it's really fuckin funny lmao
---
Ah okay
---
Not only will this give me cancer....this will give me orgasmms
---
I‚Äôve been getting them with whoever today. Plague, Trapper, Myers and even Wraith, because I used the Bone Clapper (someone actually messaged me and said they DC‚Äôd because it‚Äôs OP). I don‚Äôt even want to think of what it would‚Äôve been like had I have played Spirit.
---
Then Micheal Myers walked in the room and fell silent bwacause he brought tombstone
---
&gt; the store is being constantly updated with new cosmetics to generate more money
---
Has nothing to do with your lost legacy. Different people work on different things. Read up on how stuff gets done :P
---
Don't get me wrong, i would like to see lost legacy be restored.
---
But freddy is good
---
I saw the movie as well it would be cool but its just a small movie so unlikely
---
You‚Äôre a lot of fun.
---
He's definitely way more fun than Myers to play as and against. 
---
However, hooked survivors breaking his stealth would make facecamping way more viable for him
---
If the devs knew this than claudettes cosmetics wouldn't give you an invisibility cloak
---
Yeah, no.
---
See-Bot sees everything.
---
OMG he no use skill he VIP
---
High sensitivity for Nurse, the spirit? Idk
---
