Can't not have him there xD

"lmao it's probably just a woman"
---
No, it’s actually plained, silly thing 
---
He had enough of entitys shit
---
It’s a peaceful life. 
---
sure if you don't mind walking everywhere. Sprint Burst is ass now.
---
I’m not saying justified attacking you It’s understandable to be angry after a game against legion due to the fact they also just want to play the game and have fun against killers they can counter. Try to look at it from their perspective when playing against legion the only thing you can do is run in a strait line to gain distance. Mind games are impossible due to his fast attack speed.  
---
Yeah I saw that, that actually makes me pretty happy because that means Microsoft/Sony is allowing them that access. I’m gonna be honest with you it kind of puts a bad taste in my mouth though that they ignored things until an exploit came out that let people progress faster on a character, now they’re gung ho about banning. But the toxicity and exploits that let survivors win games easily for what feels like forever now were wholly ignored.
---
How do i do this
---
Omg. Thank you for the laugh. 
---
It is now possible, according to BHVR. See Twitter post [here](https://twitter.com/deadbybhvr/status/1088889415131381762?s=21).
---
Idk, I'm not BHVR 
---
What's sarcasm
---
What are those Meg jeans?
---
I'm 85% sure that the female Legion voices are just Huntress' voice with slight varations. (They don't throw a tempertantrum when stunned)
---
The only tape that's run is Frank's, and knowing that Legion has Frank's really doesn't add much "counterplay."
---
Amusing, considering I'm the correct one in this conversation and the two of you are mistaken. Incorrect grammar isn't a problem in written speech because it's naturally occurring in spoken conversation. It's used to add flavor and nuance to a character's speech patterns, and to make them feel more natural and organic. Or should I correct your post and say it's "You're" and "lol" because those are technically correct and "ur" and "lawl" are not?

Always amazes me when someone tries to insult someone else only to prove themselves the fool.

"I think we did a pretty good JOB"
---
Exactly, I'm glad I didn't do the glitch anyways, and bans are kinda necessary in multiplayer games... (Also sorry if I have a bad grammar, English is not my main language)
---
I totally understand their frustration, however, I don’t understand them coming at me because of a character the devs made, not me. Whenever I go against a nurse or legion, I usually comment on how unfun the killers themselves are to play against, but I never go after the player for just trying to play a game.
---
Can't allow that. The Grind is the game. Without the grind, there's no game. There's nothing keeping people playing , except for the people who really want to play it.
---
It works on keyboard too. Home and End swap your character. 
---
No problem! 
---
I instantly recognized this comic so I browsed through everyone I follow on tumblr to find it
---
i never heard of it ,explain further in pm plz :)
---
heck
---
The switch is also super laggy and slow, it’s quicker to just go to the killer menu. 
---
Can you substantiate any of this beyond "konami can do it!"?
---
*Gets pallet stunned*  
---
What survivors hear: "OEURRGH"  
---
What Myers hears: "FUCK!"
---
LMAO WTF bro... I have over 6.4k hours on this game and I've never seen that shit happen. Crazy
---
What I'm saying is that if they run ds theyre wasting a perk slot while if this becomes a feature the killer can make the chance of survivor escaping basically 0 because there is no need to carry them to hook, giving killer the 4k. 
---
While in the current situation, for what you claim when you said if they get off your shoulder in a 20 meter range at hatch they get a free win, they still wasted a perk slot the whole match for it. If a yellow mori became a feature the killer wasted nothing to get his auto win because it's a feature.
---
I think the green mori is fine but the yellow mori should be changed or removed (increasing green mori appearance in bloodweb slightly maybe) while the pink mori needs a change.
---
Also youre locked out of the moris due to rng because they're powerful. You have to upgrade your character to get good stuff. 
---
Also hatch needs a rework
---
Always ignore that guy so he's wasting his time, not yours.
---
The harder someone tries to get my attention, the harder I bootyblast their boosted friends
---
I mean honestly you’ll likely lost reddit points for posts like this one
---
you should have replied "no u"
---
Healing when you have the occasion, because Wraith is a killer that tracks survivors on their blood
---

---
Darn
---
My best guess is DLC perks? Even then you don't need to pay to get them...
---
im surprised as you are never heard of it as well someone explain it through pm. 
---
I guess this ain’t it chief
---
We all died, but too be fair the killer had 300 ping
---
No, the wiggling bar isn't just a mechanic to prevent always using basement hooks. It's also a way for survivors to be rewarded for sabotaging hooks, leading a killer to a location with no available hooks, and for running boil over. I don't like DS, but I dont think it's fair or good game design to simply buff killers to indirectly nerf a perk because it removes depth and gameplay decisions that survivors can make.
---
 Not that you deserve hatemail, but if you play Legion, expect for everyone to be pissed. Nobody likes playing against Legion.
---
If you understand their frustration why would you post this... You’re posting this about their reaction which is nothing special, no funny insults or nothing over the top, just average insults. This post is so stupid contributes nothing except “players mad at legion and vent rage”.

Wow I must be deaf. To me it sounded like the piano was redone.

Just be dick to everyone if you feel like it. Everyone is selfish to no end, why shouldn't you be as well?
---
Thanks for the tips! Looks like I’m going to have to invest in some headphones to play her properly. That or order a new cord because my dog chewed the ones I got for Christmas up. But the faking people out during chases is one of the reasons I’m so intrigued by her. The mindgames make it that step further and fun!

One is easy to track cause it involves a static numerical data handshake between your savefile and their server data.  The other is hard to prove because in-game data constantly changes, bugs happen, and people constantly false report.  Guess which one is which.
---
On some killers that can switch target quickly sloppy bucher is more consistent to slow down the game, but with any other killer, ruin is a must
---
I looked at Wraith for a moment and saw Christmas Sweater Meg on your shoulder as if you were picking her up
---
But to clarify, you can still report teammates for bodyblocking you right?
---
This won't happen if you switch between characters that cant be prestiged, correct?
---
Tunneling is the same as genrushing I guess. People think both things are bad when in reality they are the things that win games for both sides.
---
So do we have to earn 900 things or 4500 things?
---
I'm asking this because i don't know if they said the coins reset after each coin is unlocked.
---
I hate survivors when they do that.
---
Lmao same
---
He's had enough " I just had an idea guys, how about we also Cary wepons and defend ourselves"
---
NP! &amp; yeah, headphones will help you figure out which direction people are breathing/crying in. I have a logitch headset that I bought for Overwatch originally that I've started using.
---
well then it's a pretty shitty designed game. People can play game after game after game of 2Fort or dust .. shit there's nothing but servers hosting that map and have since quake 2 days long before achievements and hats
---
oh, but now apparently everyone needs shitty carrot on the sticks to stay interested. Shit that effects game play should not be put behind a gate in a PvP game. Now not only do players have to over come a skill gap but also a gear gap. It's no wonder you can't balance these games for shit or find shit matches cuz some guy just wants to afk farm or quickly just grind out stuff. 
---
Depends on the circumstances. If it can be perceived as an accident, like oops I blocked the path and you got downed, then probably not. If they trap you in a corner and prevent you from playing the game until the killer finds you guys and kills you, then yeah reportable
---
Do not bully my bing bong boi 
---
Thats a pretty big exploit.  I feel like this last update really broke the game.  Hopefully things get fixed soon.
---
Freddy is above that. He has ascended and now says "darn"
---
I've been watching Ralph but it strikes me as strange that I have never seen him use m1

---
So close
---
Thanks, answers my question 
---
yes
---
I don't know? No, there just isn't any counter. Unless you have a genius idea, smartass.
---
But I don't always play to win, sometimes it's about fun between players.
---
I regularly play meme builds and do movie type styles of play to try and shake it up, after 1700 hours I think I'm allowed to
---
It's like bowling with friends. It's not always competitive and sometimes we muck around for the fun of the game rather than the value of winning 
---
Lol, a good spirit is pretty op but Freddy is trash.
---
Cheapskate, lazy, and a stalker. You have all the wonderful qualities in one package, don't you?  
---
Not as hard as I imagined. Not to say i'm great with her but in the little experience i've had playing her i've gotten to grips with how she works pretty quickly.
---
Interesting you say its Japanese as i was playing on pc last night and a japanese (checked his profile) survivor managed to hook rescue himself 4 times in a row and once healed from half health to full while on hook. Added him afterwards and he swears he just got lucky but i reckon hes full of it. Its stupid rare to get one self unhook let alone 4
---
I got this before and I can reassure you he is asserting dominance against the killers
---
Www.Google.com
---
I don't think that necessary correct I think alot of people quit the game because of the grind. This games biggest problem is the grindout to unlock perks and I think if we had easier access to unlocking them more people would play it and have an easier balancing them.
---
The grind is why people play this game so much, like it or think you hate it its what keeps you hooked. 
---
Its the difference between games with garbage progression systems that leave you bored immediately. DBD keeps you wanting to play to keep gettingblood points and keep getting more shit.
---
If you had everything unlocked on every character just by clicking your fingers the fun is going to vanish pretty quick.
---
“My friend did it” 😂 are you 13?
---
Can we get an F fo...

It's ok, I didn't wanted to call your meme bad or anything like that, I just found that funny. If you'd like to know more about the perks I'd recommend checking out the [game wiki](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Dead_by_Daylight_Wiki) for more info on them and other useful stuff.
---
Yeah, the matchmaking is seriously garbage--and also one of the issues, probably the issue you had; people derank purposely to have easy games against easy/newer killers. It sucks.
---
why not leave it on 1109?
---
It's a bug that came up after recent 2.5.0 patch. Don't go in before it's fixed. Kind killers would lift you and let you go, but some will just hang you right there.
---
If that's the case... I'm gonna assume this dude has no idea what he's talking about. Don't take it too seriously.
---
No I’m 23 with a friend getting into the game and this sub who I let play my account
---
Is it only console? I’m confused 
---
Hope you’re feeling better.
---
I remember playing with a sweaty group of swf when I was fairly new and they just kept yelling commands. Save me, don’t save me. I’m just like “what do you want me to do?” God forbid if they lost a pip that game.
---
I play with people who just play for fun and it’s more about the social aspect than actual winning (I suggest you find a group like that). That way you can get bloodpoints, learn the game, get teachable perks, and have FUN!
---
It's a trash perk on spirit

Thanks for the tips! :) And that’s really good to hear because I’ve read everywhere that she’s just overall fairly difficult to play. By chance, do you know if she’s harder to play on PS4? Because I know everyone says that Nurse is even harder to learn on that platform. 
---
Man, fuck this guy.
---
Huntress doesn’t exist I guess

Imagine almost being hit, but then the game glitches and now you’re across the map. GG
---
Good job!! ❤️
---
Don't be a dick.
---
Thanks! :) &lt;3
---
I’m excited for dedicated servers
---
There was a glitch where four survivors could do that in ptb last update. It was mad dumb. At least it's not one second brand new parts though
---
The constant reposts seem to disagree with you lol
---
I would’ve assumed I was seen and run like a dingus. I have plenty of time in the game but still play pretty dumb.
---
OMG! That's so nice and satisfying!
---
It's really not if you just work through it properly. There are games at rank one where I won't even look for it because everybody knows how to handle it
---
I can't believe these reposts lol
---
You can't see the blood while phasing tho? It's a bad perk overall Imo unless you moonwalk with legion. Monitor and abuse allows you to get super close to survivors and get free hits. Only 16 meter terror radius. And in a Chase it increases to 32. Best of both worlds
---
Because two of them spawned on top of it
---
"Can you substantiate your claim with anything other than proof?!"
---
I play spirit on PS4 and PC. It’s about the same.
---
Another tip is fake haunting. If a survivor keeps hopping back and forth over a pallet, just stand still for a moment and they’ll most likely hop over it (right to you) and then you hit them lol. 
---
The spirit is really fun. I also run make your choice,  ruin (idk why I bother), NOED (idk why I bother cause it never gets to endgame), and nurses. 
---
I’ll switch out ruin with Discordance (2 person on 1 gen notification) whenever I unlock it. 
---
Haunted ground is ok if you’re running ruin... since they’ll look for the totems anyway. NOED is just better cause no one breaks full totems.
---
If you find him approaching you, running to a window nearby gives you more time to run away. When he gets to your back and rings the bell, jump over and run for other places to keep up the chase.
---
I don't have a problem with hillbilly and huntress Being over spirit but Myers isn't close to her. He is very prone to gen rushing because having to stalk out of tier one. He also gets looped to hell. Spirit is almost unloopable.
---
And going against Gen rushing SWF with flashlights is just super fun.
---
BHVR are lazy cunts that never do work until they either want more money or somebody finds a way to have more fun with their broken game. I would argue that they broke the hitboxs on purpose they most the devs are trash at killer.
---
I hope you're being sarcastic. 😅
---
Complete opposites. Ruin's purpose is to slow down the game. NOED is a "I fucked up real bad but want a kill anyway" perk. A better replacement would be pop goes the weasel as that serves the same purpose of slowing the game down. 
---
To be honest, the worst and most disappointing part of it is that these are people that have clearly played the game a long time and put a lot of effort into it and they still get off on stomping brand new players. Instead of moving on to the next match, they have to sit in the lobby and spam personal insults, tell people to uninstall, try to goad them for no reason at all. Like, they won, they beat a trapper with only the pallet breaking perk, while in comms telling each other where the traps were, having a person trail behind me watching the entire time. Must be really fucking great at the game.
---
Yeah I'm sure they didn't want to ban people on purpose that's it chief.
---
And the fact that his traps can be disabled permanently 
---
so if you do the glitch with killers will it give say diamond stones or whatever to your wraith?
---
It’s physically impossible to unhook yourself more than once, so I’d say it wasn’t just “luck”
---
Right, instead of taking their victory and leaving... now they gotta sit and insult you 
---
A new bug from recent patch where a DCed survivor's UI doesn't change into the cable icon. Pretty annoying when you find out you only have 2 teammates.
---
You don’t think that the reason that my comment is  repeated is that bc the that’s the general consensus? Doesn’t take 200 iq to figure why legion is stupid.
---
And in the corner, just to the left of the yellow smiling guy’s foot, you can see where reports against these players go
---
People who do this shouldn’t definitely be banned. 
---
Cable pull. I've never met a person who got banned for DCing.
---
Bruh it's literally google. Just fucking google that shit, it's not hard.
---
*just a little bit*
---
Because if you play one in a troll's lobby, you're quite literally feeding him.
---
No mither was not designed to be that good. According to the devs no mither is a hard mode for survivors. 
---
So what's the difference between someone using this bug and someone just saving up those items?
---
There's literally no difference.
---
If it was something that actually effected players and the game itself I'd concede that there is an unfair advantage but you're literally saying that them using this glitch and the items that come with it have an unfair advantage over others.
---
What is the difference between someone using this bug and someone using the exact same items as someone using the bug?
---
Two survivors, same perks and items.
---
Only difference is that one is legitimate and the other is not.
---
How is it that one has an unfair advantage where as the other doesn't have an unfair advantage when they're both using the same perks, items, addons, and skin?
---
What is the actual advantage that makes it unfair?
---
So like how does dc banning work if you can’t report it?
---
Honestly wouldn’t even be that big of a buff. The perk would still be the worst in the game but would be semi useful for certain builds. 
---
*yee*
---
and i cannot stress this enough
---
*haw*
---
Idk how it is for PS4 folks, but there is a report option for quitting early on XB1.
---
I... I have a controller 
---
I got banned for it. Two week ban but still a ban. 
---
As a killer main it doesn't seem too op to me but then again I never see anybody running no mither and it seems pretty balanced where it's at. If I'm playing survivor and I'm running no mither it's just cause I want more bps
---
Honestly you just can’t please some people. Do you want totems spawning in a tree? Behind the exit gates? In lockers? That’s what come with high risk - high reward perks like the Hex’s. 
---
So you're just toxic then?
---
known bug they talked about on the livestream. still crazy.
---
I think I unfriended you because we never played.
---
[GASP](/intensifies)
---
Post game lobby chats like this always give me a chub.
---
I dc if i was getting looped all game by multiple survs and had 0 fun
---
or it was all clauds because I hate claud
---
And also I play a lot of both killer and survivor so I could probably teach you both.
---
known bug they talked about on the livestream.
---
I don't even waste a perk slot on it anymore, I don't think I've ever had a game where it's lasted more than a minute 
---
Probably what happened, haha. Feel free to add me again! I’m about to get off for the night though because I have work really early. 
---
PS: I’m not amazing so don’t hate me. I’m working on it. 
---
Pretty much sums up my evening.... I usually find its worse in a 4 man premade as well.
---
This. If you can't catch someone by the third loop, stop tunneling.
---
I would so appreciate this! Like you have no idea. I really need some tips and stuff. When it comes to survivor, especially how to loop because I’m awful. 
---
see you tomorrow
---
Why though? It Isn't exactly cheating and you have no advantage over anyone else in an actual match. The only thing you're cheating is yourself by not having anything to works towards. So in a way You're punishing yourself.
---
I'm not that great either, I've been playing since August 2018, it's the only game I play so I could get you started :)
---
dead link
---
“Unsportsmanlike behaviour,” which is what the devs said the ban will say for dc’s and I had done nothing in months that was ban worthy that could be considered unsportsmanlike outside of dc’s.

Saturday, T-posing.

I mean if they're so boosted then why are you letting them get out the exit gate ;)
---
My hag build atm is MYC, Sloppy, Ruin and M&amp;A. Works pretty good
---
for each extra person working on a gen its 10% slower so with two people its going at 190% normal gen repair speed and i think 280 then 370 when everyone is on the gen
---
The update shows what was already there, if you are working with other survivors you are not repairing the gen at your max. 
---
It triggered me too. 
---
[removed]
---
DC?
---
I was tempted to raise the volume from the default 80 to 100 in order to hear the fainter sounds better. So glad I didn't.
---
Whats that 
---
You're cute
---
Thanks
---
That sucks :/  
---
Thanks for letting me know.
---
Honestly it's why I've slowly been not playing Spirit as much. I don't find as fun as I used to a lot of survivors don't know how to play against her. 
---
tbh its not even hard to prestige
---
Not Manc enough. 
---
That's 1000 hours you can't get back. Was it worth it?
---
If I don't run ruin, I know 90% of my games 5 gens will be done rather quickly and I won't be able to get my 2 kills. I need something to swing the game around, no other perk will do that. And when I play survivor and there is no ruin on a Trapper, Freddy, Wraith, I expect a noed.
---
As far as I know, the actual numbers are 100% at solo, 90×2=180% at two people, and 80×3=240%, 70×4=280%.
---
Sorry I don't really understand what you mean.
---
99k bp one match? Please do tell me how good sir.
---
Its such a love hate relationship I have with this perk... if I take it, theres a 50% chance its broken before I can even reach it, 25% chance its broken while in my first chase, 15% chance its broken after my first hook, 9% chance it lasts for two hooks, and a 1% chance it lasts the whole game.
---
But... if I dont take it, 95% chance im not gonna even pip because everythings done before I can say immersed claudette.
---
Clearly says 30 hours in the game up top. No one started playing and was a loop god instantly.
---
I’d much rather all perks be unlocked and addons all free and balanced around that than to have a fucking godawful grind. It’s downright infuriating and stupid to have to spend a lot of time to get the bloodpoints necessary to unlock everything on everybody. 
---
As a Freddy main, I can confirm “fuck” is a term I use regularly
---
Coming from a Wraith player, the best counter against him is healing quickly because one of his perks (Bloodhound) automatically makes Survivor blood glow brighter and last longer therefore making you easier to track. If you can walk or crouch places, then dear lord please do it because another of his perks (Predator) makes scratch marks appear closer together and makes it way easier to track Survivors who run everywhere. Always assume he's running one or the other - maybe even both - and try to work around that the best you can.
---
Moving away from his perks cause I know not every Wraith runs them, the best tips I can give is to ALWAYS look behind you and over your shoulder when doing gens, cleansing totems, healing, or just about anything. The shimmer of a cloaked Wraith is pretty easy to spot the more you keep an eye out for it and the second he starts to uncloak, run for it - uncloaking slows him down and gives you a better chance to get a headstart on him before his speed burst kicks in.
---
Also use the environment around you - if the map has grass or the cornstalks, keep an eye on those too because even when cloaked, the Wraith still moves them around pretty noticeably when passing through. Use his Bell against him and keep an ear out for it - if you can hear the ringing, hide or run. The louder it is, the closer he is. Always keep an ear out for the woosh since that means he's cloaked and probably looking for Survivors to track.
---
Final tip: use a flashlight if you find or have any. The amount of times I've been burned out of the cloak mode by a Survivor with one always leaves the Killer stunned long enough for them to get a headstart.
---
(Sorry for the sermon, OP)
---
Prayer beads scare me more than anything, even insta hatchets which I absolutely hate.

I made a post like this and it was downvoted :(

Oh don’t worry within minutes of this being posted it was downvoted before being upvoted. :( 
---
The max you can get as killer is what, 72k? Sure, if you get 8k in all categories with BBQ sure you can get 150k in 2-3. But realistically no you won’t. 
---
Well you got my upvote m8
---
Info: Killer forced me to do the last gen because she was standing on the hatch (couldn't jump in) and had NOED. I'm glad I had Small Game (cleansed all five totems). It's annoying that it took so long. I tried to jump in so she could catch me because I hate standoffs but she decided to just take a piss.
---
Fanks m8
---
I want to believe it was intentional, just to creep people out.
---
Just run spine chill, it's a good perk.
---
That’s about 10 seconds longer than it usually takes to find in my experience. 
---
Yup
---
Teachables for killer or survivor? I have none for killer. But for survivor, I have all of Meg’s and Claudette’s. I also have a lot of Kate’s, because she’s my main. I’m slowly working my way up there. But for killers, I don’t play that much but when I started I played Myers. I recently bought Amanda though, and prefer her. But that aside, I don’t really like either of them. I have attempted Billy before and found it miserable. 
---
getting hit counts as a lost chase escaping without getting hit counts as a "won" chase
---
Damn when did that change happen?
---
For killers with BBQ yeah. Survivor thats like 8+ games
---
No 
---
If a killer appears to be AFK though, bring a flashlight for blinding (if you’re not chest-hunting) as well. 
---
Feel free to use Small Game to find the totems and cleanse them all. 
---
When you are taking hits and healing... stay close to each other! If someone has WGLF and they take a hit close to an injured person, they get a stack! I get so frustrated when my teammates don’t do this lol. 
---
You could SelfCare a bunch to max survival but it takes forever, let me tell you. 
---
Honestly I used to think survivors were OP but after the hitboxes broke even more...
---
Stop posting this video. Gets reposted every other day. 
---
I just played on the swamp with doctor and it was a fucking shit show. God forbid i be able to use one of the characters in the game. 
---
Jake is asian.
---
2 of the first are Asian, 3 are Black.  3 of the Killers are Black, 1 is Asian.   They feel invested in diversity to me.
---
How?  You jump a pallet, touch the guy and stop moving for two seconds and have to restart the chase?
---
Alot of people define "fun" as teabagging at the exit gates, so I respond with my own brand of fun, robbing them of all their points. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
---
I had a Dwight with no mither d/c on me as I was mid swing on him,  and the app closed and gave out a crash report 
---
nurse can do the same except legion doesn’t need to hit the survivor 728294728 times before getting them down...
---
By level 40 of huntress i had 4 sets of iridescent head+the +2 hatchets. I could've gotten more if I strived for it. As a huntress main you get to have one of the strongest kits in the game and at any moment a stash of insta win hatchet addons. God I love huntress.

The other guy being u/my wife left me or something like that?

No fix, its normally caused by interacting with the lockers/chests in the basement or the chest above the basement in the killer shack. I capped my fps at 144, I dont have too many problems just going into the basement itself.

No Mither doesn’t grant any extra bloodpoints. 
---
I really want that perks grant double bps in every action since it’s a hard mode, but it is just a dream.
---
I wish dev will reconsider for some buff (or rework) in this perk.
---
Ah was the legion the final killer? or are they addming more after he/she
---
Oh I didn't know that, I never use the perk so. But I do think it should grant extra bps for something
---
I just started leveling Legion. Once I hit lvl 15 with him I’ll start using him barebones to get a feel for his play style. Don’t know what to expect from it.
---
Lol honestly troll harder this shit is weak sauce
---
&gt;DC-DO NOT REPORT (wich is confusing, why is it even there then?)
---
Their system automatically logs when you exit the game through the "Leave Game" option in the in-game menu. That's why it's included and you don't need to report it.
---
“I didn’t get hit by the killer once” 
---
I also had this happen today, got in a couple of chases and the killer didn’t hit me. Also got % lost for chases lost somehow. 
---
I'd consider him the clear winner here considering you took at picture of your monitor
---
He said "Wrathe"
---
Wow, ok well both times it happened to me it was after unhooking someone. I'm pretty sure my fps is capped at 144 too since you can't just leave the field blank in the ini file. So I guess I'll come back to this game when the devs decide to fix it.
---
Nah I like my 50 Frank's mixtapes . I think I'll go for 200 tomorrow. And maybe 50 purple flashlights
---
The counterplay is to have legion chase you for the 2 minutes it takes him to kill you, while your teammates finish 3 gens
---
I know right? Can do all that shit and still get a zero.
---
R/wooosh

Facts
---
This must be it. I always search the basement chest. Also explains why I'm the only one getting this issue
---
What a pro gamer moment.
---
I can just **smell** the 4k in this.
---
rjustlearnedthefword
---
I still think Billy holds his #2 spot. Huntress is the weakest of the 3 IMO, with Spirit being the only one that truly contests the #2 spot. Huntress just doesn't have the mobility or map pressure that Billy and Spirit share.  
---
Spirit is amazing, and her mindgame potential and ability to shutdown loops is rivaled only by the Nurse. However, there is a limit to her power (you can only use it for so long before it needs to be recharged). So, unless you're running recovery add-ons, you need to choose between map pressure and mobility or shutting down chases. You can't have both with her. Additionally, she lacks a one shot. 
---
Billy, on the other hand, has a built in instadown, has incredible map pressure and mobility, and can snowball better than the other 2. He can be looped, sure, but a Billy that knows what he is doing can (usually) end the chase rather quickly. 
---
  
---
All in all, I think Spirit and Billy are pretty neck and neck, but I still think Billy has the edge.   
---
Sloppy Butcher and Franklins funny enough delay the game. Sloppy butcher making them take longer to heal and franklins can knock items out causing them to obviously not have them or for a lot of survivors to waste time going back for the item.
---
I’m hoping to be on tonight so I’ll see if anything’s different on my end. I found that, since I got the XB1X, DBD runs better, but the last patch that fucked the audio was incredibly annoying. 
---
I'm liking the new Nurse skin.
---
You know it? Not having to waste hundreds of hours to prestige? say no more
---
There are already versions of all the survivor perks you though of. The devs decided they couldn't make perks that OP and watered them down a bit... Leader is minor, Slippery Meat is Weight, and Boil Over is Plucked. Boil Over sucks, and I think it should be more closer to your version of Plucked though, more like 30%.
---
When you buy insurance you aren't buying it planning to have your house start on fire, you have it just in case it happens. 
---
Then why does the end screen list the points they gained?
---
Legion takes extremely little skill though

I said the exact same about Freddy and I was told to "get good" 
---
there is nothing about him that makes him good, sue me
---
Glad this meme is still alive, one of my favorites 😂
---
Me too please
---
Tbh rotten fields ain't even that bad
---
As a nurse/huntress main, can confirm. Only say fuck when i interrupt a hatch escape.
---
Except disconnecting is literally against the rules. You abusing it to be a dick is toxic. Teabagging at the exit is annoying yes, but it doesn't literally ruin the game for you.
---
Yes but the fact is he has little counterplay and takes very little skill so they literally cannot buff him without first addressing one of the two problems 
---
i knew you could do it op
---
Can someone DM me on how to do this please?
---
Without good add-ons Freddy will literally destroy your sanity
---
Sorry to hear that
---
Alot of people prefer playing lower ranks. Since streamers started deranking it seems like everyone and their mother deranks
---
Or you can just DC when there's prayer beads
---
The only thing they have in common is that they can ignore loops when legion's power is up. 
---
Legion has no map control or pressure, Nurse does, doesn't have the potential to end the chases quickly, Nurse does, decisive is even more strong against Legion than any other killer, it's not that big of a deal against Nurse, they take no skill at all, Nurse is the killer with the highest skillcap, survivors have no counterplay against a Legion using his power, survivors have mindgames potential against Nurse, Legion isn't punished for missing an attack because of the very short cd on missed attack, Nurse is heavily punished for missing a blink.
---
i literally can't find it 
---
Ive also been having wraiths block me in and use noed to kill me and the person i saved
---
Maybe so, but the deranking discussions amongst the big streamers happened weeks ago, and over the past two weeks I've played a lot and didn't see this many DCs/ early quits. Just tonight it's been happening like 100% more than usual.
---
But legion has to hit the dude once while sprinting and once while slow.  Legion cant end chases because you cant kill with a sprint stab...
---
I don't think that's the same problem.
---
nurse can literally do the same thing except she doesn’t waste her time trying to hit the survivor another 20 times.
---
You can get to rank 1 with enough time put into the game.
---
Whoever makes things as vile and disgusting as this deserves nothing more that a fate worse than death. - Probably someone famous
---
As I said, in terms of overall power it’s not even close.  
---
You’ve just agreed with me, thank you sir have a nice day. 
---
So one similarity and they are the exact copy, alright, that's some weird logic there.
---
What add ons do u recommend
---
Sure. I wait in the lobby to load into s get do that I am on the hook all game so that my teammates can do gens. What an awesome usage of my time.
---
I love Franklins! :):D!!!:D!!
---
No this is totally art! Keep doing what you’re doing! (Not trying to be sarcastic)
---
That's ok, no one uses the perk.
---
Pretty much all of his addons are good, but I highly recommend running 2 Block addons. So the Z block and Unicorn Block are the best. His 2 red addons are actually very powerful so you can run those. Class photo is very strong as well, but with high ranking survivors I would take 2 blocks. 
---
This is the first season where I don't give a shit about ranks. I have been range quitting often from games with campers and tunnelers that I have not even gone past rank 10. But I don't care. Rank 10 will give me games faster than red ranks ever will. It's a win win.
---
Can I know the threshold so I don’t let my anger get the better of me. Though I only dc from annoyance when I’m having a really bad day 
---
Or the ones in hitman 2. Worst AI in a video game.
---
Welcome to the bottom of the tier list, we have cookies, milk, D A R N, and dc’s. Enjoy sweater boi, he’s really fun.

https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=17431
---
Try installing DirectX11 from the Microsoft website. This should fix the issue that you are having.
---
what? 
---
nurse actually takes insane skill to come to the point of ignoring all mechanics
---
Yeah. I could see that. I used to this too when I started playing 😂.
---
Just run to a pallet or to the start of a loop. Learn all the different loops in the game. 
---
Btw, hiding is fine and it helps a lot in this game but the one thing that will make your improve your game  is to check where all the pallets are and move towards them slowly. Better results most of the time than to hide in very bad spots like you did in the video.
---
Wdym what
---
I think people are talking about different glitches on here
---
I pretty much always use BBQ for the BP lol
---
Frank’s mixtape and cold dirt. 
---
Ah "Buggzy" Wilson.

Brings back good memories of simultaneously getting chased around by a jock with a machete and a decaying hockey mask wearing corpse with a machete.
---
*cries in console*
---
Came looking for the good nurse. Couldn't find it. No wonder she lost all gens in a heartbeat. 
---
Jendenise has to win somehow
---
Freddy because I want to hang myself too
---
Passive aggressive comment.
---
It's definitely a bug and it happens in specific windows. 
---
(Here's an example) [https://twitter.com/No0b3_tv/status/1088281473575092224]
---
Could be Cain from the Bible; he's the oldest killer in history.
---
Could one of the classic monsters like Dracula or Frankenstein; one of them is the oldest killer in cinema, while Dracula could be the oldest killer in terms of age.
---
Could also be a character from the game's lore; the first killer to ever be inducted by the Entity
---
There's plenty of possibilities because they never specified what they meant by "oldest killer".
---
Was that loading sybol her DCing? Hahaha.
---
*REEEEEEEEs in oinks*
---
You keep pivoting back to the ban/exploit angle. It’s a whole other argument.
---
I’m pointing out that BHVR had no way of banning on console when the issue was just toxicity and cheaters.
---
All of a sudden, *THE DAY AFTER*, there’s an exploit for progress instead of just gameplay, and magically they can ban on console out of nowhere.
---
When was the last time BHVR did ANYTHING the day after, much less such a major undertaking, that has been wanted a bunch? Look at dedicated servers, we’ve been asking for two plus years, and they JUST announced it, and it still is months away. But bans on console? They just happen to drop it with NO warning/advertisement? And it just so happens the day after a progress exploit?
---
Call me tin foil hat or whatever but I could honestly see BHVR making this whole shit up.
---
Small Game users have big brains. Also, the DC at the end made me laugh. "Oops, my NOED didn't activate and I didn't get a 4k even though that just gives me Deviousness points and +1 in a single Emblem of mine, better lose all my points!"
---
It's literally only like 2 or 4 seconds slower they just put it there to encourage survivors to work on different gens for some reason
---
Most of the time, and barely most.
---
Hex: JAJAJAJA got me good.
---
Thanks for the heads up about dark mode, I didn't realize I could switch that on and was just struggling. I can't be assed to train myself to compulsively open windows to the old reddit instead of the new one.
---
That makes sense, thank you. 
---
I play on console too. It's not a huge problem 😲
---
It happened to me twice yesterday. I missed out on the hatch cause I assumed the other player was out there somewhere so I did gens and fucked myself. 
---
You should really post your system specs in cases like this. What GPU are you using? 
---
By the time you get him to level 20, you’re going to have about 50 of them.
---
That exact thing is the reason why if the game is still going a good few minutes after the gates are open, I don't go near them. I'm not giving those asshats the satisfaction. 
---
So they lied about them banning it? What about PC?
---
People just dont get this and its hilarious. I have allot of matches where swfs just bum rush hook immediately. Ive won entire matches when I shouldnt have because of this . Then call me a tunneler when I punish them for it. No you dumb fuck if you're going to un hook them while I'm close enough to get them it's called sandbagging and it's entirely the your fault. Saying you shouldnt kill someone who can be killed as a killer is like saying survivors shouldnt gen rush, its core to the game hence the safe unhook and unsafe unhook metric applied to your saves
---
farm maps make me wanna commit die as killer. Its so impossible to navigate thw corn
---
That's not a solution to the problem. The problem is that survivors earn very little to no BP. You saying "then play as killer" doesn't fix that issue.
---
"Ace in My Hole" is my new favorite thing.
---
"Rolled up Jeans &amp; Sneakers"
---
the plague doctor would be a nice addition but I don't believe he has any powers.
---
Alright,  I'll bite and avoid the basis of my opinion here, which was that these all seem surprised by consequences of their actions:
---
Who knows how long BHVR has been working on that?  But I do agree, it could be BS -- Much like the Rating System at the end of matches.  I do agree with that.  
---
This game does have a garbage progression system though. And how exactly does shortening the grind by providing more BP per match suddenly equate to "everything unlocked on every character just by clicking your fingers". First of all, that makes absolutely no sense as a drawn conclusion. Secondly, if we take your statement literally [which I know you didn't intend for, but I am gonna play devil's advocate anyway], then that is what every game is: "unlocking shit just by clicking your fingers".
---
Easily. I hate to tunnel and camp. But if you are going to spam flashlights and tea bag, prepare to get camped or tunneled. 
---
Console bans when they see people bypassing the grind for some cosmetics: Instant.
---
Console optimization when players have been complaining about the state of the game since the port: Still nothing.
---
Lol well never mind then. Was watching the stream and thought this would be useful info. Oops.
---
Who were you?
---
And if you DC in 40% of matches it's an auto ban.
---
5 and below I notice a sharp uptick, but it is rank 2 that I tend to find it is the worst. Rank 1 is bad as well, but toxic players often depip down to 2 from disconnecting whenever things don't go their way.
---
Put it this way, in rank 1 survivors wont get hit through a pallet... 8-10 they will make you think they're going to jump through a window or whatever, and any higher than that and they will circle you around a pallet 3 times before they even drop it... so yea enjoy those hits while you can get em.

The only way a trash killer can 4k a game is NOED and every killer seems to use it since every tier causes exposed.... But most other perks add a second or small percentage to each tier, lol. Destroy every totem except one and your screwed? The buff was beyond unnecessary, it was ridiculous

You didn’t see my name ever? In rank one you didn’t see “Somebody Toucha my Claudette
---
Talk about empathy
---
I see a lot of people do it, including me, and the mindset is "7 seconds = Freddy won't be patient enough to tunnel again", but yeah, it's a really stupid thing, and I should probably stop doing it. It's like self-caring at a pallet, thinking that you'll get a skill check as Freddy lunges, then acting surprised when you go down.
---
You paid $2.99 to add 3 more traps to the map. Pay to win scum.  
---
/s
---
Yep same. If I know they're going to be doing this I'll go afk in a corner somewhere and waste their time. 
---
Yeah, but 90% of games it spawns on a hill or out in the open and gets popped immediately, switching to pop goes the weasel for slowing gens was a great choice 
---
We don't want to suffer penalties associated with disconnecting. Also how tf do we know you've checked out?
---
Thanks 😅
---
Hexy spent a whole game bitching about how his team wasn't doing gens (it was sort of true and justified), and at the end, when the wraith tunneled the shit out of him,  two of his teammates came back to take a hit.  But this wraith wasn't having it: he wanted hexy and he was not going to be denied.  These teammates were body blocking the wraith so well, but hexy was already wounded and wraith only needed to avoid hitting the other two.  Then Wraith followed hexy through the center of one of those two track trackhoe (but without the hoe, only the tracks), and fucking BODY BLOCKED THE KILLER INSIDE.  Sometimes teammates are shitty, but those times when teammates are great really tend to make up for everything else.  I play the game with the hope that I get one of those great games every session.  And while it may take 25 games to get it, it's worth it every time.  Hexy escaped, BTW.  You can probably find the clip on his recent videos (today's) right after he got a 4k as legion, then played against legion.

Description: So me and my friend recently got back into dead by daylight since his account got reset and never fixed and I had convinced him to play again and grind back the stuff. The only problem is he gets on he gets up like 20-30 levels and we get off for the day. The next day he logs on to the game and all of his characters blood webs and levels are reset but his ranks is the same he has no perks and is back to level 1. We tried to play throughout multiple days and even log on and log off then back on and all of his starting level 1 blood webs change. It has restricted me and my friend group from playing because we like to have all 5 of us play but without perks it is very difficult for him any ideas?

Idk what this guy meant, but especially at the lower ranks you'll need ruin so you don't get genrushed right at start
---
No ruin btw
---
You got my up vote! 
---
I wish the pause menu told you how many totems were left on the map. It’s easy if you’re the only one doing totems. Otherwise you’d have to count and remember the location of the cleansed totems you did vs your teammates and not count twice.
---
itt: "but survs do it too!!!!!!!!"
---
And
---
People blatantly admitting they dc when losing 
---
Many have said you'd have to have over 60fps uncapped, and to fix this is to cap your fps and revert the changes made in the game settings file. I know I won't because 60fps is gross and degrading
---
you play the game more😉
---
Respect wamen 
---
Shitpost? NOED is a fire and forget perk; if you do poorly, it works wonders. If you do great, it's useless. If you do okay, it can turn a 1-2K to a 4K. It doesn't require skill or totem protection like you said. 
---
please say you forgot the /s
---
I mean if you really think ruins needed then by all means, go for it, just remember others play daily without running it and do fine so it’s likely you’re just doing something wrong.

Isn't it "treat others the way you want to be treated"?

---
Yeah I wasn't trying to be mean or anything like that I was just kinda surprised ig, if you do good without it then I applaud you. I wasn't trying to give hate, sorry if you thought I was
---
Listen mate ill just copy and paste my other comment since why not;
---
&gt; Perhaps its because you cant escape a good legion. They'll just keep coming at you and you'll eventually bleed out. You try and break the chase and hide? He'll hear you mending and you're screwed.
---
You try and loop him for as long as possible? Not gonna happen you're 100% going down in 1 minutes time because he'll just keep frenzying or he'll just find an opening and hit you normally.
---
If he has franks mixtape the chase is over in seconds. He can walk backwards to screw you over. He can run bloodhound and sloppy butcher to make sure he never loses you. You'll lose him for a couple seconds then the timer keeps going down until he finds you again and now all it takes is 1 frenzy to down you and you cant do anything because mending doesnt pause the timer and he'll hear you easily.
---
Also if you dont have iron will you're also screwed, but it doesnt matter because in the time that he leaves the area so you can mend without him hearing you, your deep wounds timer will be depleted. Then again, using Iron will only works if the killer loses you in the chase, which a good rank 1 killer wont. Unless its a shitty map like lery's. But if they have Bloodhound and sloppy, you're not losing him for shit.
---
*WAH-ni?!
---
Oh yeah, times when all the generators have been popped and I've only hooked someone once. Literally 0 chance I can do anything so I just go afk but they stand in the gate waiting for-fucking ever.
---
When he's alone, he's constantly mumbling to himself, *fuck fuck fuck fuck *
---
Ime killers who use noed tend to be less skilled than the ones who don’t. That’s just my observation of course

Could you imagine Chucky climbing a hook with the survivor in one hand, like Mario sliding down a flag pole in reverse.
---
I'd rather play against him instead of Freddy or doc, but that's me
---
That’s something I can fucking respect right there. I can only consistently get 2ks at red ranks. Getting 4ks consistently is something to be proud of. Also, I love how whenever you down anyone with Nurse they have a 50% chance of dc’ing and sending hate mail about how op Nurse is.
---
I mean I would be able to tell you how loud it is if I could still hear...

No but seriously I played it yesterday and I took my headphones off because it was hurting my ears.
---
Or he could just use his voodoo magic but I like that a little more.
---
Ha haa! Nicely done. I'm a killer main Rank 1 and I cannot stand sweaty killers who run NOED. Congrats buddy! 
---
It’s cool, never thought you were trying to be rude or anything. 
---
I’m just saying it’s not a necessary perk and from my experience it slows down the rate that some people learn the game because they rely on the extra time it provides too much. Of course that isn’t definitive but I’ve seen numerous players have it happen to them.
---
i love history so seeing a napoleon themed killer would be cool even though they’d probably never do that 
---
Lol, true is good man. You don't have an argument against him being good. Just a hater. Guess you think zubat and ardetha are bad too
---
Could also be the 'oldest killer' in the sense that it could be the Teacher or the Smasher which were snuck in around launch. Although I wouldn't mind a medieval-themed killer. 
---
op uses noed

It is, thank you for noticing my mistake I'll correct it.

Doesn’t need anything. He’s plenty powerful enough. I’ll die on that hill and I’ve been in the red ranks as survivor for awhile now.

Remember, they are the same guys that highly praised their "e-sports" tournament, where people obviously lagswitched infront of everyone and even their community mods, that did commentary, didn't say shit about it. It's pathetic.
---
Over a year ago I got banned for 24 hours, because I jumped with dead hard on an object, where the killer could technically still hit me and even jump there himself by lunging. I stayed there for not even half a minute and then ran to the killer to let myself get killed, but it was enough to ban me the same day for "exploiting game mechanics" or something like that. For a bug, that was there since march of 2017 and only got fixed like over a year later.

Is Hillbilly the best killer on console?
---
Ummm I have to ? Lol , I didn’t feel like it .

What’s your twitch username?

Exactly its pretty damning evidence

I feel like the Doctor should be down in Physically cannot say it, what with the stretched lips and all. :D 
---
Moonwalking seems cliche, I just look down, as for farming survivors, um that's the point of the WGLF perk, hell I don't mind if someone uses me to farm for points as in the end it'll help the both of us get BP. XD
---
As long as you don't use PS4, you won't have to worry about me buddy, unless Sony and Behavior work together to enable Cross Play.
---
I think the cat works for the entity...
---
We're Gonna Live Forever already does that pretty well. 
---
Yeah, could start a witch-hunt which isn’t aloud on the sub
---
Oh f I need to point that out for you, you definitly have problem there buddy, just look at this post again.

My favorite one was a couple days ago:

Pop goes my asshole
---
I Love the New Survivor they Added to the Game!
---
he really is autistic.
---
Where’s Nea?
---
i have him but i dont want to play him
---
God you can tell he’s crying while he writes this
---
No, this survivor played exactly how I expect survivors to play in hatch standoffs.  If Killer is there first, fuck off and go do objectives.  Killer just dropped the ball on paying attention.
---
Heyyyy, V-Sauce! Michael here!
---
Unfortunately, I cant play killer if I'm not running Hex: Crutch.
---
mortys killing mortys
---
Almost as if hex perks aren't a well design'd aspect of the game and should just be removed altogether.  I mean name one survivor perk that a killer can spawn on and just outright remove from the game. Oh thats right there aren't any because the devs know if they added anything like that into the game the majority of the playerbase would lose their shit. Guess its ok as long as the minority is the one suffering right?
---
What do you mean?
---
This deserves at least silver.

Yeah
---
A claudette named iDDOSfaceCampers found my ruin in 10s and tried to cleanse it, I downed her and put her on the hook next to ruin and facecamped her to death.
---
After that I played the match normally, but boy was I pissed.
---
I'm still waiting on that DDOS.
---
Stay the hell away from my totem.
---
Yeah but shouldn't escaping with only having one hit before you go down give you extra bloodpoints due to it being a challenge
---
Eh mostly at high ranks though. Not really in 10-20. But i mean the survivors gotta get better eventually right.....right? i mean sometimes i dont even believe that based on the teammates i guess but swf is a whole different story.
---
I know, no idea how I ended up there lol
---
Lol DrDisconnect
---
OMFG FREDDY OVERPOWERD NERF PLOX!!!!1!11
---
Lmao there's only 3 levels of fog. It would be the same as 3 common ones.
---
Wooden Horse:  
---
\+10% max range  
---
\-15% accuracy  
---
Catatonic Boy's Treasure:  
---
\+15% max range  
---
\-30% accuracy  
---
Ataxic Respiration:  
---
\+20% max range  
---
\-45% accuracy  
---
The accuracy decrease will stay the same, but you'll lose 5% of your max range.  
---
However, I don't know if they're additive or multiplicative when stacking, so this may be wrong.

Type of Bug: Ingame/Menu
---
Description: Weaved Ring's aren't being burned when I die
---
Steps to reproduce: Equip a Skeleton Key with Blood Amber and Weaved Ring; Weaved Ring will not leave inventory after death
---
Expected result: Weaved Ring is removed after death
---
Actual result: Weaved Ring is not removed if I die, so I can keep using it infinitely as long as I don't expend its charges
---
Reproduction rate: Haven't tried but so far it's 100% for all the rounds I've had it equipped
---
I don't understand why they don't have a real money option for unlocking perks...
---
Don't heal and pressure the gens, until the killer downs you there is pressure 4 people can apply till they are downed/hooked or dead.
---
Franklins does fuckall except make someone drop a medkit, to which the answer is DONT HEAL AND PRESSURE GENS.
---
If legion has taught us anything, it's that even time wasting can just be safely ignored if you have the option to do it.
---
Don't worry, you'll find them in your next 20 matches, too.
---
Ruin AND Noed  :D Punish the early game, AND the late game. Wooooo!
---
Wasn’t even running plunder’s instinct 
---
Oh yeah? Tell us who you like. I can't wait to hear.
---
Nerf lockers
---
I just get so tired of being challenged, I throw on my crutchstrike and crutchdrenaline and my instacrutchkit and play with my three really good friends.
---
Wait, why is everyone mad at me. :O
---
I mean I have fun playing Bubba that chainsaw when it gets two people is amazing...especially in the basement. That is when I'm not being a sub-par killer who aims for 2 kills a match in exchange for not being overtly toxic.
---
It can be a clutch perk as well as a crutch.  Same with DStrike, it can create really clutch plays that turn the entire game around that wouldn't have been possible otherwise, but it also gets used as a crutch to rely on instead of learning to improve without needing it.
---
A floating toolbox, and a floating party starter.
---
I was saying I'm bad at killer, and I consider Ruin my crutch. I'm not mad at anyone for using it.
---
Also, I think Decisive Crutch works a little better.  XD
---
Yeah I'm pretty fucking sick of survivors just sitting around just to tea bag at the end. Like fuck me man just leave through the gate there's no need to be a prick, and waste my time for literal no gain to either of us.
---
How? Things like the xim are hardware that translates mouse movement to joystick input.  The console sees it as any other controller.
---
Honestly SB needed to be nerf, not the other skills that caused exhaustion. The way the devs dealt with SB being OP was kind of stupid. They basically made SB the default speed perk instead of balancing it to make the other speed perks more useful. 
---
Literal exact same scenario happened to me last night on PC. It was infuriating. 
---
Sounds like another console bug.
---
Spending 200 bucks on external equipment to exploit a loophole in the way the console reads devices is cheating. Especially so with this game and the nurse. You're paying for an advantage that no one else has unless they also spend 200 bucks on an xim adapter. 
---
But that’s not what he was referring to though 
---
Yeah, and I'll ask again.
---
What is the REAL game changing advantage of 99 stockpiled items/addons vs 99 glitched items/addons?
---
What is the ACTUAL advantage?
---
Both are the same items one just got them faster.
---
I literally have over 200 ebony moris across all the killers I play.
---
If someone glitched 200 ebonies that does not give them an advantage over me.
---
That also does not give them an advantage over others because it's an item that literally anyone can get at any time in the bloodweb.
---
That's true, but there's still no reason for the others to go off multiple times in a chase. If they're going off again you've already run the killer around for 80+ seconds, at that point getting an EXTRA speed boost/hit dodge is just rubbing it in.
---
Ok lol feel better now??
---
I dont even have a console, but me too please. I'm really curious how they managed to find it
---
You're right about that, it seems like they're trying to say it is a clutch perk and not a crutch, despite literally saying "not a clutch."
---
What does NOED mean?
---
Almost had me there OP. Well played. Take your upvote.
---
I am so happy right now. 
---
Open handed and kindred. Never leave home without them
---
I chuckled
---
I was thinking about posting it but , knowing the community here , I don't really want to.
---
I'll think about it .
---
So unbelievably many, right? 
---
Same here , same .
---
Not that I would ever do this, but if one was to do this, in order to get them sweet sexy prestiges, how would one do this? 
---
What they're saying is they can't ban on console. They never have been able to and still cant, but they want to scare you from doing the glitch. 
---
No One Escapes Death
---
when the 5th survivors gen pop out, killer gain speed and can OS survivors even if they are full heal 
---
Lmao “very toxic” for well played sabo....
---
I found the stream from your original post, guy played poorly and had tunnel vision on the Meg. Whiny killer who can’t admit when he just got outplayed and made mistakes, instead takes the gen rush SWF defense.
---
Kinda sounds like when Zekeo would post hacking videos and nothing would happen to him. The second he posted a video on how to get free bloodpoints and prestige shit, instant ban 
---
the only way you can counter it is clean all the hex totem before the 5th gen pop out. like in this video. No totem left = No hex perk can be activate
---
Activate Windows 
---
And this is one of the reasons I am thankful that as of 2.5.0 swf can no longer reveal the killers perks to their teammates/
---
Intentionally stupid is still stupid.
---
Dead hard is by far the best exhaustion perk in my opinion but I'm a main killer so take this with a grain of salt. I think its the worst to play against when the guy is actually skilled cause it will guarantee at least another pallet loop. The only thing I can see why another one would be best is against exposed/one hit but I still think its worth. Balanced landing is nice when you can actually activate it...
---
you... what? it doesn't take anything of you. that's really a delusion. you either put enough pressure on people so they didn't waste time cleansing but usually that means you are already dominating the game or survivors just don't care enough for noed. you don't need to protect totems. only thing that might be of help from your side is to keep an eye on uncleansed totem and hook the survivor near it so you were able to protect the hook and the hex when no more gens left. it only requires luck lol. 
---
Im definitly concerned given that ive saved up a million bloodpoints before the event to get lots of offerings. 
---
JuSt A lItTlE bIt
---
Bye Ochido, good fucking riddance. 
---
I don't play this game enough to know all the perks and the meta and all that but I appreciate the answer
---
That's because people either aren't playing him right or don't have the skill and intelligence required to play him the way he was meant to be played. Legion has plenty of power you just have to use them creatively.
---
Well when your job is providing content for a game, being in rank 1 is a bit rough if you're a night owl in NA, you play against the same 3 people 50 games in a row, granted rip that fucking poor bing bong boi.
---
There are people complaining that he is garbage and people complaining that he is great... I believe he is average/below average without the powerful addons which people still don't know how to play against.
---
np man 👍 
---
The entity is kind of an asshole, isn't it?
---
Ah, you're right! Never seen anyone wear Hakamas like those while I lived in Japan (which was a while ago), so that's probably why it looked like Hanbok to me :)
---
I’d like to know too 
---
How do you even do that
---
Lol
---
It really does feel like a time waste to me. Sure, if I’ve figured out that the killer has BBQ, I might jump in a locker, but if so don’t know for certain, I’ll just keep on doing what I was doing. 
---
That being said, Dwight’s are precious and should take every precaution to ensure their safety. 
---
Nah, NOED's pretty meh. You gotta have a totem left at the end or it won't activate. If the totem is broken after it activates you lose it. And even if you have a totem and it's not broken after activation, it only takes 20 seconds to open a gate. So the Killer has less than a minute to catch someone, even allowing for extra time for Survivors to find a gate, before the game ends.
---
There's plenty much stronger insta-down perks and add-ons. And Myers has two insta-kill add-ons that let him just kill you from healthy, doesn't even need to ever hit you.
---
haha prison rape is funny haha yeah
---
You’d think that being a decent human being would not be difficult...sadly, for some people it really is a challenge. 
---
I suggest changing your profile settings to only accept messages from friends. 
---
I love haddonfield and the game with Huntress :D 
---
What's the exploit?
---
Dude, out of everybody in that fucked up universe(s) I’d want to be the Rick that has all his happy juice being made into candy. At least that dude has a good time. 
---
Having an ability to recover from exhausted status while running and being able to be knocked in one hit sounds pretty fair.
---
Wrong. Just wrong.
---
99% of NOED activations aren't due to the Killer's action, but Survivors' inaction. Basically, it activates because Survivors didn't bother to cleanse the totems.
---
Meanwhile; the Killer is complacent and neglects their gens, thinking "I'll just clean up with NOED". Then that first down is a freebie, since Survivors can't *know* you have NOED until you get said down.
---
If you get more than one down from NOED, that isn't the result of your skill, but Survivor stupidity. Good Survivors would either find and cleanse NOED, or just leave. Then, since you didn't defend the gens, you likely end up with 2 kills. At best.
---
But one was a freebie. Meaning you climb the ranks faster than you should and start going up against SWF groups that WILL cleanse all 5 totems early on, and you fall apart.
---
Tl;dr - NOED *is* a crutch, and if you want to do well at high ranks, drop it asap.
---
It should just give a 1/2/3 action speed increase
---
70% of the time I'm just waiting on you to show up so can hit you one last time. 20% of the time I still need my last BBQ stack. I will stare you down for an hour for my last stack, IDGAF. The other 10% you don't deserve a free escape and I'm just AFK to force you to do the gens because you never touched one or helped your team during the match.
---
Can't speak for everyone else, but that's why I do it.
---
I recently heard about the first scream thing, which actually makes some sense.
---
Balanced Landing, but I think Lithe is better than both of those perks.
---
I turned mine off to make the game somewhat tolerable.
---
40% isn't a legit number
---
Do you realize op is a troll ?
---
worse than backwater swamp? that maps a whole fuckpile of random debris and shitty hitboxes with only 3 pallets and 2 labyrinth systems
---
"Just a little hard to play with less then 30 fps" fixed your title 
---
Or its bullshit
---
Legion main big brain 
---
Shame you cheated, your teammate told you about his perk. 
---
Is it really worth the effort for the killer to stand on the hatch during standoff like that? You killed 3 guys and the last one got lucky and found the hatch. Just give him the hatch, he's gonna get it anyway.
---
Make your choice and hangmans trick comes on usually.
---
I was gonna get an x but im just gonna build a pc instead. Hopefully they optimise this game because I'll be damned if I'm gonna give them more money to play the game as it should be played.
---
whew, got me good there for a second
---
the freddy rework we've been waiting for
---
What’s a hard DC ? 
---
8-10 is when it starts getting sweaty, rank 1-4 is largely dc/derank/toxicity
---
That’s not how colds work, Granma, GAH READ THE INTERNET 
---
SWF on voice actually had an advantage when they lost a player...  Should be the opposite.
---
Makes me feel better for all the hate I get as killer 😅
---
Balanced landing is totally my fave, dead hard is a bit overrated since you need something to actually dead hard to for it to be useful 
---
Haven't spent a penny on cosmetics. Got suckered into buying the clown and spirit by their promises of an optimization patch. I don't believe anything they say anymore.
---
I do that sometimes lmao
---
So epic tho, I'm just fanboying trapper anyway..
---
You do realize Michael could speak if he wanted? He isn't "physically incapable."
---
I'll believe it when I see it
---
I still wish his footsteps honked.
---
It really looks like Windows XP to me. 
---
Look at the bright side there is not much you can do against these players and yet you still did this.
---
Hard to tell when she's crouching though.
---
There is no name for it but it can go higher
---
I believe it depends on what is the biggest stack the specific buff can get, I know that luck can stack for way more than the Considerably (the biggest single offering)
---
I'm glad this glitch is here personally, BHVR couldn't give a fuck less about the community and has been thoroughly ignoring the playerbase for about the last year; ergo why it's gotten so toxic. Did the math today and me and my friends were able to prestige all of our survivors and killers and probs got by grinding for about 180 Million blood points; couldn't be happier. There hasn't been a ban system in place for PS4 or Xbox until this exploit was discovered, co-incidence? I'll leave that up to you guys.
---
SWF is how.
---
nope he's not. I was On Discord Video Chat Screensharw with him and he was playing on Ormomd Resort with Prestige 3 Nurse and Ataxic Respiration with Catatonic Boys Treasure and Ebony Memento Mori (RANK 13) and he got generator rushed by the evil nasty survivors who did 4 gens in 2 minutes
---
He has tourette's so he started hitting himself!!!
---
F a c t s
---
Are people who DCed too many times in the past being banned for it now or will they have to continue DCing for the new ban system to pick it up? Just wondering because I think we might be seeing more players DC during the Moonrise event to rob other players of their points. 
---
Same
---
Lmao so they wouldn’t ban anyone for years now all of a sudden they can ban?
---
Snow White always has the Blue Shoulder Pads with Red Lines.
---
I'm just gonna put this here so I can see how many downvotes this gets later. 
---
*whispers* also I agree with you.
---
That’s true. I honestly don’t even run DH or BL too often. I haven’t been running adrenaline perks besides actual Adrenaline but I’ve been playing Feng and Lithe is pretty good. 
---
Pretty sure that the pig cannot be purchased without real money though.
---
That's a harder issue to fix but sure
---
Same, because doctor require more skill and calm spirit counter his power in 90%. Legion don't have any counter and that suck + broken addons and brainless ability 
---
*Slow the game down just a Lil bit*
---
I'm going to test if it feels different with considerable + moderate  and moderate + moderate haunting duration. I might start another thread dedicated to this stuff if you're right
---
Right my bad, I bought all the killers so I didn’t know
---
Nurse require skill, legion only require more than 3iq to play don't compare this 2 killers it don't have any sense
---
And instaheals
---
The original image was just above this post lol
---
I'm new what's hook farming. When someone unhook you and killer is nearby? Is that automatically bad always? 
---
There's still a chance you get away vs no help at all? What can you do if killer camp?
---
i run both honestly it’s pretty nice 
---
It could be worse...
---
I've seen posts about people celebrating getting to rank 15 (you can't lose pips from 20 to 15). 
---
She only goes to green ranks
---
I’ve seen someone on a stream with the name “Hex: Devour Pussy”
---
They really fucking aren’t, every killer at those ranks do that because they think that’s how you win
---
If he had even gone and checked one (1) of the gens a survivor was on, he would have pushed them off it and it would have taken them longer than 90 seconds. Since it apparently took 90, that means he didn't push them off any of the gens even once. Even the worst killer can walk around and push survivors off. 
---
&gt; Mother-Daughter Ring+Yakokuke Amulet
---
How fast do you go with that combo? Faster than Billy?
---
I run into survivors that body block, work with the killer or try to lure the killer to other survivors by dropping pallets and fucking up gen and then disconnect. I've reported them but not even once have they even replied. If they're gonna start banning now and only the ones exploiting the glitch, they are full of shit. If they're lying just to scare players and and still don't ban, then they are full of shit.
---
Yeah Lithe is pretty good
---
I normally run Sprint Burst because it's probably one of the least situational perks and it's useful for multiple things, but Lithe is really good in chases
---
True, but that's why i ask, because i wanna know if i should be saving add ons for more effecient combos, no worries
---
Uhm, not to sound rude, but you're the new one here probably ahahah as other said in other comments, hatch spawn when the number of generator done are equal to the number of survivors alive +1, in fact when you're alone there can be 3 gens left (1+1 done),  and when everyone is alive (4) you need to do 5 gens before it spawn closed.
---
I think he means emblems not shards
---
Not to mention the fact that the motherfucking *walls are see through*. Those maps are definitely the ones most weighted towards the survivors. Honestly I kind of wish that I could just play every game on Haddonfield or Coal Tower. Those are probably my two favorite maps.
---
Please dont run Distressing on Spirit, the whole point of her smaller than normal TR is to use it to get closer without being noticed, M&amp;A is better in all forms over Distressing
---
Bloodhound is good on any killer, that doesn't mean its necessarily useful, especially since your power makes you unable to see blood
---
Had 2 b dallas tx lol
---
What difference does it make? Wtf...
---
Since you're new I'm not sure you know but you can be caught while jumping.
---
She blocks her rank now doesn’t she? Like the streams can’t see it. 
---
Yep I think it's intentional, it sounds like a different score more in line with the intensity it deserves! 
---
Ikr. It is so rough for killers. I would like to try it as Scratched Myers tho . Hmm..
---
When does the event start ?
---
*Banned*
---
Thx
---
They can't ban him because he hides his accounts, how can they ban them... 
---
If you need SWF comms to win, you are, in fact, trash. I'd say he was right about you.
---
If a legion is about to m1 me because I bled out and have yet to go down because I'm mending I let go specifically to deny them the small amount of blood points they'd get from hitting me 
---
Same I am also not the best either but if you do end up needing some one last min I can help
---
I'm a rank 15 wraith and I don't camp does that count?
---
Yes I do. Thanks lmao. 
---
I like Haddonfield as both actually. I'm a level 4 killer and a level 18 survivor, so I obviously have a lot more experience play as killer, but Haddonfield is on my list of maps that don't make me immediately go, "fuck".
---
Personally I can't stand any of the Coldwind Farms maps, any of the FUCKING SWAMP MAPS, Mother's Dwelling or the Yamaoka Estate.
---
disconnect
---
Same, but we now know it's at least possible.
---
I played him and accidentally became a bubba main. He's P3 now.
---
I once accidentally screwed up checkskill because I stared at bearded Jake too long. The Jake I was doing gens with prob thought David's hand is too big to do checkskills. 
---
Remove the ability for self-care skill checks to wake survivors up. Another teammate failing a heal skill check on a sleeping survivor is fine.
---
Transfer Adrenaline's ability to wake survivors up to the Wake Up perk. Adrenaline is fucking meta enough already, everyone uses it.
---
Reduce action speed of survivors in transition by 100%. Survivors shouldn't get free unhooks/gens/totems/doors/heals while falling asleep.
---
Give Freddy all that, and he won't need a rework.
---
??? Ok no duh Hope “counters” it. And what are you talking about exhaustion perk countering it? Exhaustion is one use, and like i can only see one actually being useful against NOED (balanced landing). The only reason NOED is so good is because of the movement speed.
---
And yes PWYF has a strong effect but the way to get that effect is so ridiculously awkward to get and you lose it right away, thats why no one uses it. I dont think you realize how much 4% is in this game. Killers are either 110% or 115%, the 4% doesnt sound like such a big deal but it is.
---
NOED would be fine if it didnt give a sonic speed boost.
---
Micheal when new players are sitting behind the pallet and he's charging evil within. 
---
U saying you bait hooks? 
---
Same bruh same :) lmfao these little moments tickle me in my no-no square like nothing else.
---
100% best thing to do. Lately I’ve just been going ahead and finishing all 1-3 generators left if I’m only one alive and killer is camping hatch. Gives me a chance for points and sometimes the killers falter, run towards the gen to catch you once they know what’s happening, and leave an opening for the hatch!
---
They aren't precious, they're special. Massive difference.
---
Or 100/1000/5000/whatever hours into the game
---
You can definitely go beyond tremendously. I dont know if its the case for ALL items/addons though. For example you can pretty much get insta tier3 with Myers if you stalk your obsession with +moderately and +considerably(obsession only) addons.
---
Haha right after we find a mean exploit, they suddenly can ban on console &gt;\_\_&gt;
---
I honestly still have my doubts. I would want proof (even one console user) showing they've been banned. Until then I'll remain skeptical.
---
They didn't even deal with the person trolling trutalent and he had multiple complaints and video evidence and the devs did nothing.
---
I know for a fact that they would have to review a save file for a user to determine marked dates of prestige so it's not even obvious for a user that they've cheated until they look into individual users save files. That's a hell of a lot of work
---
Survivors are toxic... or ARE they?
---
As someone on p2 myers going for p3 I would like to know too :)
---
It’s going to be a lot of grinding but you can earn everything for free so that’s cool 
---
Then by that logic literally getting lucky in the bloodweb is an unfair advantage.
---
Honestly, dude, fuck off.
---
The 2.5.0 patch made the killers loadout hidden in the end game screen until the trial is over. SFW can no longer tell their buddies all the killers information anymore.. until it's too late.
---
15-25 is trash lol
---
Yeah if someone said a vanilla Nurse, I'd assume any add ons, and only their own perks/generic perk pool.
---
Although it could also mean BBQ/Ruin/Nurse's +1, that's pretty much default Nurse.
---
Zubat is doing the challenge right now and i honestly am curious how much faster he can do it. Im certain he will manage it faster, just by how much.
---
There’s always at least one comment like this in every post
---
1000 hours later
---
Lithe is a forced use on any vault. I can loop a jungle gym or killer shack for days so Lithe would be useful when transferring loops except I can't vault a window and then not use it. 
---
I have more control in my looping but like I said if you haven't tried it then you wouldn't fully understand how well it works. You have nothing to really lose by trying different combinations unless Rank means that much.
---
This sort of mindset is what is killing this game slowly and slowly
---
Crazyrussianhacker is the only youtuber I can not imagine causing a scandal
---
My snapped badge approves of all 2k games.
---
I mean... I care. So that's not entirely true. 
---
Just YouTube dead by daylight exploit and filter by most recent videos. Easy. 
---
Yeah..
---
Nice one , actually
---
He's probably one of the few survivors who I have a lot of clothing options for.  The other being David and Kate.  My options and they are not all.  I don't buy everything (I refuse to buy that silly 80 getup) but I do buy them if I think they look cool on him:

Speaking of looking good, did BHVR gave him a haircut recently?  See, my favorite Jake's head is the one with the beard.  The one thing that I'm not too fond about that is how his hair looks a bit like bird's nest at times.  However, since the recent move to UE, I feel that his hair is a lot neater and less messy. This makes him look really hot especially while doing gens or on a hook:

When did I say I was justifying de-ranking? I am vehemently against it because its petty and shows that someone can't keep up to the standards THEY set for themselves. Streamers which de-rank should be banned if you ask me.
---
Look at the Reddit Thread above this one.
---
Nurse has a stun built into her kit. Legion has a kit built that basically  eliminates any slowing or stun besides the actual pallet drop.
---
Nurse has a ton of aiming involved and can easily thwart her own chases. Once  a Legion sees you, he only has to run in a straight line.
---
Nurse losing sight means she has to throw herself blindly forward. Legion  losing sight means you crouched around the corner and are waiting to get  hit because he's way faster than you.
---
Nurse gets one hit per set of blinks. Legion gets enough to down you and your friend through his dumb mechanic.
---
It'll be one hell of a slideshow...
---
Good shit to anyone who can manage it, it would be hard that’s for sure 
---
Would be cool, but I doubt it, and furthermore, for every platform the game is on, the development slows down, because some snowflakes would cry "why do they get it fiiirst" like console players in the past
---
**mess with the freddy you get a big dead-y**
---
haddonfield is very survivor sided with most conventional killers
---
Pretty much why I run SC a lot myself. Pretty busted how the only way you can defend yourself from Prayer Beads is with that perk.
---
Balanced Landing is way better if you know how to get the most out of it. The faster recovery from falls is a big part of why this perk is better and abusing it is very important.
---
Deadhard doesn't gain you nearly enough distance and is baitable. Not to mention if you got oneshot you didn't even have the chance to use it. All that aside Deadhard imo is way more fun to use.
---
this post aged like fine wine
---
Ah, the pure essence of sabotaging.
---
BBQ such a crutch perk finally got nerfed. Now you don't even need a brain to counter it
---
"But it's opposite day."
---
console players are sweating profusely rn 
---
The Nurse I CAN SEE IT!!!
---
Seriously? So is it even possible to get all 9 unless you don’t have a life? Lol
---
It's always the dogshit gen monkey teammates who bm as well
---
Doesn't piss me off when I'm killer, but when I'm survivor and there's any sign someone else is waiting for hatch I just run right the fuck out.
---
Id remove legion
---
true men like myself prefer 
---
**s p i r i t b o o t y c h e e k s**
---
Hag on Corn Fields, game takes forever without Nurse's Calling!
---
Just chase them out. If I’ve let them get the exits open and give them enough time to get to the exit easily without any danger then I deserve to get teabagged. I’m a killer main too btw. It’s just the nature of the survivors to mock the killer
---
I have to try this!
---
that thing doesnt work
---
I mean last year TN is coming to switch so I don’t see why not, but in all honestly the games code is a mess so I don’t see it happening for that reason alone.

---
Nah bud they patched that apparantly
---
If automoderator deletes this I’m gonna be so pissed
---
I didn't know how stressful this game could be until I played killer for the first time. Survivors can be real dicks hahaha. I slinked back into my survivor characters very quickly after that.
---
RIP
---
Imagine running towards an exit gate and getting smacked my a footlong meatball marinara
---
someone please pm me how to do it.
---
got a source of that?
---
What is your point?
---
From his perspective you were tunneling him, because you didn't chase anyone else. But if you really didn't know where other survivors were, I wouldn't necessarily call it tunneling.
---
Of course, you could've just leave him alone and search for others... But that's a question of playstyles.
---
Big oof
---
You gotta embrace the feeling. It’s u against the world
---
Holy fuck, my heart goes out to you console people. Really.
---
Mori if your Horni 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Okay, I can see where he thought I was tunneling him, but I saw that Feng for literally a second then I didn’t see her but that guy was running down an open path not moving side to side or trying to juke me or anything he just ran in a straight line, after he died the whole team died shortly after except Feng cus I got greedy and wanted to hook her on a very specific hook on a hill
---
Git gud nub
---
((Small game))
---
I have a greater respect for killers now that's for sure haha. 
---
Depending how the game is going.. I woulda tried to find the person farming them off the hook if they were on death hook. If the game was falling out of your favor and you couldn’t find the guy who unhooked her quickly then you are right to hook her again
---
Dan I hope you read this 😁
---
So it is gay?
---
Nurse is not a problem. She is strong, but she has very clear weaknesses that can be capitalized on by skilled survivors.
---
Legion does not. He has no mechanics that are fun, skillful, or contributing in any healthy way.
---
Just because you lose to Nurse doesn't mean that she's bad for the game.
---
Tbh the game like just started but I don’t play for points when I play killer since I prefer survivor I just wanted to play a couple games then go back to survivor, but everyone else was doing a great job of avoiding me, just not that guy
---
"Maybe today will be the day I don't get hit through any pallets" - me every day
---
Great, now I'm gonna see that little shit with its smug grin everytime I get downed while trying to open it.
---
I don't mind it. DBD doesn't have that many milestones to celebrate beside Rank 1, all achievements, or long playtimes.
---
question, i dont know much about report systems, but how can the service now be live when they didn't update the game on console? none of the game files are changed so how is it any different? I'd really like to know, thank you. 
---
What if someone doesnt wanna farm so i kill them
---
Infinite meaning the bloodweb will never go away so you can guarentee getting things like Franks mixtapes or bloody streamers or ebony moris without spending 40k+ going through the web. You just spend 3000-6000 and bam you have the thing you want whenever you want it. Compared to the actual way to get it its basically infinite
---
You have proven your ignorance for me so I’m not going to even bother.
---
I do it for maybe about a minute before I get bored waiting for them to find it and just walk off, it’s not worth it 😂
---
I is a good perk not a crutch. A crutch is something that does very little one you are good at the game an example of a crutch is windows of opportunity 
---
You farm some for me ya hear?!
---
all achievements is actually hard to do though
---
The amount of salt I get from using Franklin's when people bust out their toolboxes (or flashlights as hag) is ridiculous. You guys are coordinating as a 4-man with great items, and I'm the sweaty/toxic one for picking a perk that helps me out in that situation? Okay.
---
She is a huge problem when it comes to the balance of game mechanics. She ignores pallets and loops and, although there are built in weaknesses to her power, survivors have no hope in escaping a Nurse. You can say that all killers can do, given enough time. Which is the gist of my point: Nurse is one of the only killers who can end up winning any chase very easily and very quickly provided the KILLER has the skill. You can't say the same about Bubba or Trapper who just have to continue walking at the survivor, consuming both time and pallets along the way. And you can't buff either of them, because then they would be trivial. Don't you see how Nurse ILLUSTRATES HOW THE GAME IS FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED IN ITS CORE?
---
Yea it always feels bad when you find the same guy over and over again just because the rest of their team is immersed. I want to kill the others but since I can’t find them then it makes it difficult
---
I have never been so hurt

Has to take a shit
---
I was thinking the same thing. Watched a YouTube video from The King earlier and he outlayed the ban system and “teaming” is a bannable offence, which means working with the opposite team is a no go now
---
Yes thats tunneling, pretty much the standard tunneling scenario
---
I'm so ready for this shit. Gonna spend the next week grinding up blood points.
---
Why is it that your way is the only fun way?
---
Killer has always been the weaker side. A survivor has exponentially more options to outplay a killer than vice versa. I'm always glad to see killers buffed up a bit.
---
Hey! This is solid OC! Good work! Upvote!
---
I dont understand why killers are so desperate for a 4k. I main killer and when hatch is open I just go to youtube or some shit like that
---

I wanna see that 👀

no its not? go to my vod, it happened yesterday, my teammate was memeing about it and i thought it was a good callout xD and apparently it was
---
You won't get banned for using an adapter. Everyone knows it's cheating but game companies can't do ANYTHING without help from Sony and Microsoft and they just don't care. I've never seen anyone get banned for using one and I've played R6 and Overwatch where people straight up admit (and even boast) about using MnK
---
was going to try loop it :(
---
You can scream in caps all you want, it doesnt actually matter.
---
Legion is disgusting for the game, because it's a game and it's about having fun. He is anti-fun. He has no real weaknesses to his power when he's played effectively.
---
Wipe the sweat off your brow and unlock your caps. Just because you don't know how to mindgame a nurse doesnt mean you need to act like a complete bitch.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ajud3x/90\_of\_killers\_be\_like/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ajud3x/90_of_killers_be_like/)
---
They probably received reports but did nothing with them. Now they plan to do things with them. Afaik it's hard to ban people on console without Sony/Microsoft getting mad so who knows whether they really can or it's just a scare tactic for the new exploit.
---
The system catches DC automatically so it's pointless to report now.
---
What is this glitch? I had it happen to me 5 times in a row 
---
Im sure they've taken that into account. It's the DCing many times in a short period which would most likely trigger it. 
---
Also I'm sure there will be on screen warnings before the first ban stage.
---
Sometimes if you’re too far away from them the game will think you’re not in a chase so survivors will be able to vault as many times as they want
---
That doesn't seem like a good idea tbh, any killer barebones will be pretty trash
---
Can someone answer this: Why is it that whenever I play Michael, the survivors turn into potatoes but when I play Bubba, the survivors take me for a ride around the pallet city? They're effectively the same killers; both just walk at the same speed behind you but only one of them is able to instill such fear into the survivors that they lose all focus?
---
you need to know how to play against a nurse. You can't run circles around pallets, you have to find structures that obstruct view. She's slower than a survivor when regularly floating so if you run her around a structure she HAS to blink in order to catch up and at that point it's a matter of who can mindgame and predict better than the other. Nurse is broken on maps that are mostly open though. But the one thing I'd actually say is broken about the nurse is her extra blink add-ons. she's powerful enough with her default amount already and that way the killer is punished more for making mistakes which should be the trade-off for playing a killer that already is pretty powerful.
---
Nurse is easy to play against if you know what to do and if you get the right maps. The map that came with the clown with the church in the centre for example is perfect. Whenever a nurse gets on me I just sprint towards that church and run around until she loses me and gives up.
---
This is just absurd
---
That's simply impossible if you'd give it just a little bit of thought.
---
Sometimes they alter things on their end after implementing code from a previous patch.
---
For example the events are changed on their end and were ready to go on the user end from the last patch
---
&gt; I was thinking about posting it but , knowing the community here , I don't really want to. I'll think about it .
---
Well, with that response I just went ahead and did it for that guy anyways.
---
Pretty sure this is stolen
---
How do you know that? 
---
What happened that game?!
---
click and let go a gen, like a really really quick tapping.
---
Try running Devour Hope, get a good pawn, 1 surv kills themselves on hook and now everyone knows about the perk before it even activtes 
---
That's not Meg's fault, he would've gotten you had you tried 
---
It’s almost like the guy you’re talking to may be related to that post in some way
---
Just maybe
---
Still the games are played on p2p, if they played the tournament in a server we could see if it was lag or not 
---
Coldwind is objectively the worst killer map. The jungle-gyms are transparent therefore you cannot mindgame them, coldwind is the only map where you can reasonably say "I couldn't have done anything to win" (unless you play Nurse) 
---
How about fuck you and the horse you rode in on, cunt-bag?
---
Then that means it's a free notification to where someone is.
---
Or even more likely they fucking lied, which is something they have done before
---
Go drink bleach.
---
Not to mention 90% of the unique coldwind tiles are see-through and super safe
---
Dont reply to me, reply to him
---
*urban intensifies
---
You can use lithe at that jungle gym to go to the next tile, though. You will get a lot of distance, save time and you will have another 3 vaults if you do get to the jungle gym or shack.
---
You dont have to walk all the time
---
Can you make a horror short out if that 😂

No, it's called be and get better rather than just be stagnate because you've convinced yourself you're good enough because you're rank 1.

Something tells me you're actually mediocre.

No...

Damn calm ya titties, let him have an opinion ya dingus

I never do hatch stand off, as a killer main.

I usually give hatch it they deserve it.

Why am I going to DC or get mad because they are better then me? It’s unsportmanshiplike and down right embarrassing.
---
The Pig could’ve stalked their way to victory. Very big smh. 
---
I can't have my opinion that he should drink bleach after a buffet of tide pods?
---
This is just basically untrue. Ranking up as killer is easier, especially in low ranks. At level 15, you should have amazing ques.
---
because bubba is a wide boi who eats too much chilli so he catches pallets like i catch hands when karen abducts the kids that bitch.
---
truly ascended gameplay
---
That’s up to you. I am in no way saying it’s a bad perk, but due to Hag’s lower MS and not really being able to travel the map as fast, you could always switch it out if you want.  
---
This kinda has something to do with the post, and will spark a argument but that’s ok. I love how people complain about the legion cause they are “over powered” but legion is only here because the community complained about the survivors being “Too toxic and over powered and unfair”. You guys caused this mess and now are complaining about it too. Sooner or later the devs are gonna say fuck it and release really over powered perks and add ons and then fuck off.
---
I have 468 hours into the game and am offended by this comment /s
---
How is max survival points even possible
---
Literally a repost from this sub's top posts.
---
You're supposed to act like you're running and double back.. not crouch there as they go through it
---
This actually. When you realize that most rank one games have moris and/or meta builds + top 3 killers. 
---
It takes 177 bloodwebs to get all perks on a survivor. Onehundredandseventyseven. That's 1.6 million BP to level 50 and then another 7 million for the other 127 levels. That's for 1 character. If you defend this shit you're actually braindead.
---
DID SOMEONE SAY WAH?!
---
Thanks.
---
"Playing for a really long time" I got to 9000 IS in like a month of playing IF even lol
---
Tunnelling is playing to win, the other one is playing with  malicious intent.
---
The thing is you are trying to hard, it’s sad lmaooo you’re probably 40 tryna be all hip n shit, throwing out “jokes and comebacks” as if you have any inclination as to who or what demographic you’re trying to insult. So it kinda sounds like dad jokes, but worst. So please do ya self a favor and get off of jens dick and tell her I said fuck her cats lmaoo. 
---
I got you.
---
That actually makes me so happy for some reason
---
I want to see this in 3D
---
Thats why i added the lol. It was meant like, i saw it and didn't read the name.
---
They couldn't ban anyone because they're actually incompetent. There's nothing magical about banning users on console, other games like CoD will temp/perma ban people for heavily abusing exploits and other stuff. BHVR is incompetent on both PC and console.
---
Yeah, I think killer is easier to rank up early on and survivor is easier to rank up in higher ranks.
---
r/wooosh
---
The second part is for over the course of multiple matches, should the killer find the same survivor in another match
---
I think the latter implies that you will try to ruin one players experience by tunneling him over the course of multiple games.
---
I'm so happy this blew up. Good on you OP! This is some top tier artwork right here!
---
Alrighty, thanks! 
---
I actually wanted to capture the crows too, because that was weird af (She wasn't afk)
---
Well that 100% achievments goal cares
---
I also enjoy it, unless it's against Freddy ofc
---
Legion also has stun built into his power. When he hits any survivor with deep wound or his power runs out he get stunned. When nurse sees you then she can blink right next to you ignoring every wall, pallet, window, or anything. At least legion has to get around walls. When legion lose sight of you then he can't track you that well because he can't see scratchmarks while using his power and few seconds after his power ends. And without his power his speed is super slow that you should be able to outrun him pretty fast if you use windows and pallets. Also legion need to hit survivors four times before he can down them but nurse can down them in just two hits.
---
The bottom description is exactly what tunneling is. It doesnt matter why you're doing it. Tunneling is going after one survivor when there are easier targets.
---
That's why I said it's almost 100% on the survs, because they can literally see you through them, only Nurse and Spirit are good in Coldwind because of this, and one of them is blatantly OP while the other one is just on the line.
---
Lots of killers use sloppy butcher since its a good perk. And even more so Legions use sloppy butcher because their power is based around injuring everyone and forcing them to heal/mend, which makes healing a waste of time. Typically every killer uses bbq and ruin or in place of those 2 perks a perk to slow the game down and a perk for tracking, and the other 2 are up to personal preference.
---
The 2 perk slots which are personal preference usually dont make much of a difference in how fucked you are against a legion however.
---
i made it to rank 10! :3
---
There is one...
---
Yourself
---
"Every grind is fun", it's not like that. I enjoy getting a character I like to prestige 3. I don't enjoy having to go through 65 bloodwebs just to get that one perk I want/need. It's even worse on killer because they rely more on certain perks. It takes 177 webs to get all perks on survivor. 177. That's nearly 9 million BP. That's more than it takes to get from Lv0 to P3-50. How is that fun? Why do perks have levels to begin with. Why don't I just own all the perks right away. I am a P3-50 Bubba with like 15+ webs and I still don't have enduring on him.
---
You mean every wraith right? 
---
I like PUNISHED.  
---
PUNISHED Nurse, PUNISHED Huntress. 
---
 Tru3Ta1ent did the same challenge and it took him many days to do that. It was kinda emerassing to watch him because he made so many mistakes and always blamed the survivors and game unbalances. Especially when he exclusively played nurse at the end he failed and depip/blackpipped so many times.
---
Then you have an actual good killer like zubat who understands the game and does this challenge in one stream. Even from rank 20 to 1 not just 15 to 1. Insane.
---
Thanks for having credited , and your welcome !
---
I'm sure when tru3 finds out about zubat's rank 1 in one stream he will find excuses like "na survivors are way worse and not as optimal" or "he just played nurse" although tru3 did the same at red ranks. LUL
---
Hey thanks 
---
Let alone that his community is really toxic. Whenever someone criticizes him or pointing out that he did a missplay and it's his fault that the survivors escape you get witchhunted and called a "toxic survivor main". 
---
Yeah.
---
They wasted their offerings.
---
I’m done hearing this bs about borrowed time! I’m not gonna have to run a perk just to go against constant campers! Also the prick had Thantaphobia and hex ruin so it slowed doing gens way down! Plus borrowed time only works if he hits you or the the person hooked and doesn’t snatch you off the hooked survivor! 
---
I’m in the same spot as you. Those two are the better exhaustion perks, but I’ve been leaning more towards Balanced Landing lately and I don’t regret it. Dead hard can save you on loops, but can be easily baited as a killer. When I play killer, DH doesn’t really bother me as much as balanced, which can literally create good loops, worth the risk of map RNG. And dead hard only really works on really good ping as well. 
---
&gt; "he just played nurse"
---
This one won't fly - I think 3 to 1 was Nurse only, but before that there were Huntress and Billy games
---
Yeah this is a repost. Atleast say so.

Sorry mate . Already posted mine .
---
He ran wide straight out of the loop, I would argue he would've gotten caught due to how wide he cut it at the start.
---
Ah, I misunderstood u then. What should there be for traps? I think the suggestions are good enough for a buff. especially if its 1/2/3% action speed.
---
And there's the annoying asshole who thinks being aggressive is the only way to talk to people .
---
I know, I'm just not *Goodenough*
---
Honestly Zubad only got it because he played around nighttime(where all the good survivors are sleeping) and he also plays on the north american server which also makes it a lot easier since it is PROVEN that NA is worse at video games than EU. If Zubadlol had to do that challenge on EU again he wouldn't be able to do this in 30hours. I bet that guy can't even do all achievments in one stream. BAD! 
---
Tru3Ta1ent did the same challenge and it took him many days to do that. It was kinda emerassing to watch him because he made so many mistakes and always blamed the survivors and game unbalances. Especially when he exclusively played nurse at the end he failed and depip/blackpipped so many times.
---
might've been a possibility, but i do think if the meghead wasnt there he wouldve made at least 1 lap, potentially more if the wraith respects the pallet or does an ambitious lunge 
---
nice repost dumbass lmao
---
You should've dropped the pallet when you saw that she didn't move. That's a misplay to me.
---
People that have to say they're nice, aren't nice. You could've just disagreed and made your point.
---
One of 2 situations.
---
1. He's standing for the DBD National Anthem.
---
2. He noticed that the killer is actually about 30ft away from the only safe place they have, and is about to point it out.
---
I mean zubat is arguably the best nurse player and one of the best killers overall. I doubt many people can beat him if he goes around with nurse
---
This actually happened to me when he raged hard about survivors being op and optimal SWF when he played doctor and I said "but tru3 you made some really basic misplays there and lost lots of pressure" he called me a toxic survivor main (although I am a killer main lol) and his entire chat hunted me.
---
I actually watched him for a long time but I lost all respect when he did that. His chat called me bad names and whispered slurs and other stupid shit to me. I told him that I didn't meant to be toxic and only told him my opinion because he always blames someone else for his mistakes. But instead of calming the situation he projected all his negative feelings on me and didn't tell his chat to stop the witchhunt. It was actually insane.
---
Have you ever seen a Saw movie? Amanda says fuck plenty
---
This. Very cool Nodus, very cool. 
---
I will certainly take this on-board, thank you! My spot was incredibly awful but I hoped that in such a low-rank game nobody would take notice. It half-worked lol
---
He should've dropped the pallet when he realised he was blocked.
---
He cut it wide at the beginning and the Wraith was definitely close enough. He would've been hit at the pallet next loop or before it.
---
He is too ruin reliant, I like tru3 but i have to be honest, he cant pressue without ruin
---
Wraith close enough? Oh cmon, watch again buddy
---
I'd say that he would've been tapped at the pallet or before it. The Wraith was too close and he cut it wide when he went through the pallet.
---
I also love Léry's.
---
&gt;because he played around nighttime(where all the good survivors are sleeping)
---
Why do you think this is the case? In my opinion, if people are playing that late on a friday night, theyre likely the people that play the game a lot and tend to be better. 
---
That has been my experience with other games with ranked matchmaking at least. Games always felt the easiest during boom hours and when most people would be working/sleeping thats when the games were the hardest.
---
Eh, from my experience and perspective that was still a safe lap, even if he cut it wide at the start. 
---
*pinecone intensifies*
---
He cut it wide. The Wraith would've caught him. 
---
Do the perks slow the game down just a little bit?
---
I guess it was just *Average*.

the funniest thing is, when they accuse me of tunneling after someone got unhooked and i followed the scratch marks. its a 50% chance that i follow the marks of the one that just got unhooked. i cant know who i'm chasing until i find them.
---
Uh have you ever seen zubat gameplay? He got a 5 gen 4k as one blink nurse
---
So many debuffs it's like you ran into a World of Warcraft Warlock. 
---
Yup he camp and tunnel
---
What the fuck do you know that you are complaining about the most situational and weak killers ever? Even freddy is better than leatherface
---
In just one game? 
---
I find 6/7 and below it gets bad. Ranks 12-7 are the best imo. You still get skilled and experienced survivors and killers with not as much salt and sweat as the red ranks. 
---
based
---
Not to be that guy dude... but I grinded for my p3 it made me feel special in my favorite game. In a world where no one is special and 80% of people’s hard work leads nowhere it feels good to have that badge of honor, even if it’s virtual. There is also a glitch that lets you buy infinite Mori so yea... ban them. 
---
Ps. If it’s just a worthless/meaningless skin why cheat for it?
---
Yea you’re fun aren’t you haha whatever man was funny to me. 
---
Well, im pretty sure it can run it if optimized, but you know bhvr and optimisation dont go well together. I hope it comes to switch tho
---
Can’t really report him then 
---
But he camp and tunnel specific person
---
This is the best bug in this game
---
Farming is okay but kind of a dick move. Farming to work with the killer or ruin someone’s experience in purpose is b a d
---
Legion: *gagging*
---
Clown: you don’t like it?
---
I think they scan all the savefiles to spot characters which were prestieged before 50 and autoban them. 
---
Well if you read the rules that isn’t an offence man
---
Stolen
---
Yes but targeting specific persons to ruin their experience is bannable
---
They stated that camping and tunneling isn’t bannable. So I doubt they’ll ban them for that unless you remember their username and they only do it to you every single time you get into a game together (so not just one game but multiple ones).
---
Coolio
---
Getting to rank 1 is a fucking joke.
---
Lucky boi
---
That means if it continues throughout the course of a few games, its why i asked if this was a one off game
---
I don't want to talk about camping and tunnelinf i just want to ask can he be banned to bring ivory mori EVERY TIM only on me
---
The "Ruining experience" rule they have is way too vague to really give an answer to rule them all.
---
A killer bringing a mori and using it on you everytime they see you, may not intentionally be to "ruin your experience". Maybe the killer remembers you from a previous game, and you were really hard to catch, and wants you out of the game quickly? This isn't really malicious intent, more like planning ahead for the best chances to win.
---
"Ruining experience" is mainly targetted at a player trying to actually make the game unfun for you, just because they want to make the game unfun for you.
---
It's because of this that the rule is so vague. Does the killer mori you because he knows you're good and can't take the risk of you living? That's not trying to ruin your experience. Does the killer mori you just because they don't like you and want to make the game unfun for you? That's ruining your experience.
---
TL;DR - Can you report him? No, not really. Unless you know that they mori just because they want to ruin your game, one cannot say that they are intentionally ruining your experience out of malicious intent.
---
Yeah I totally think agree with the aura reading thing, I don't think it's very fair for survivors
---
If you don’t want to talk about camping and tunneling, why mention it?
---
I haven’t seen them specify what “ruining others game experience” actually means so I don’t know if that’s actually bannable. I doubt it though.
---
Targeting specific person to ruin their experience is bannable 
---
You know there's a pretty big difference between not liking a streamer, and saying a person who doesn't like a streamer should kill themselves repeatedly. Like the latter kinda makes you look like an asshole, for example.
---
I felt like when I was watching zubat's games from rank 5 to 1, the survivors were not as able to put up as much resistance, because they were getting slugged so often. Tru3 kind of has a policy of not slugging if nobody else is around when he plays killer, eliminating that source of map pressure.
---
On the other hand, zubat had to deal with 7 Decisives over 12 games on his way from rank 5 to 1 (3 in the same game) and 2 instaheals. Tru3 played 27 games with an average of 2.037 Decisives per game and 7 red instaheals. Some survivors were perkless in zubat's matches, one or two even talking in his chat room, making them a much easier kill.
---
you can go to currently playing with to see if you are in a lobby with him unless he is appearing offline 
---
SHUT UP I WAS TIRED I HAVE TO DELETE MY REDDIT ACCOUNT NOW!!!!!
---
*I am fast. I am very fast*
---
Idk, I know that they can track prestiege in general so I would assume they can also track levels, I'd love to test prestieging a 49 character with video proof of the bloodweb being almost complete to see if they can track it and use it as a potential ban-appeal. 
---
That's the point he know I will counter him to don't be moried so he is offline all time
---
It sure did
---
you know it
---
I don’t think it’s retroactive but if you get a lot of DC just start reporting it. 
---
'course.
---
I played against them yesterday as killer. Very salty, they accused me of camping basement when I LITERALLY went into the corner of the map and stood there in hopes that they would unhook the 2 people in the basement. 
---
Tru3 is a very good player, but I find he often just doesn't do his research and blindly states his own "facts" to his fans like deadhard best exhaustion perk, hag 2nd best killer and other hilarious memes. Also he isn't quite as tryhard as Zubat and Scott for example. I personally don't watch him just cuz I don't like his passive aggressive attitude but thats just a preference.
---
Hex: urban immersion
---
Then just look at the front page of the sub.
---
Are 12 year olds really this fucking stupid?
---
Im not saying im good nor am I bad \^\^ 
---
I can play him up to rank 1 ( which doesnt mean anything honestly) and people play all killers without perks and get to rank 1  
---
All im saying is he is super weak to the survivor meta and is an kite and flashlight victim with no option to stop that and there is no arguing \^\^ 
---
sure you can prevent that bye playing him a certain way and he is fun to play dont get me wrong.   
---
The fact he is super weak just stays. just like freddy. 
---
love playing him but there are worlds between them and nurse, billy and doc on the game :D
---
ah, you figured out that they spammed their keyboard
---
Haha yeaht thats part of my build.   
---
That, bamboozel, ruin (just a little bit) and depending 
---
and of course those sweet perks that make him reappear faster and insanly increase action speed :D   
---
Looks super fun 
---
Or of course the good old mach 3 turbo wraith build :D 
---
Good. Maybe if killers all do this there will be an outcry so the devs can get off their incompetent asses and actually fix it. This mechanic was designed by a 4 yo with downs syndrome. Just look at the early dev streams about how they wanted the hatch to work. It's a joke.
---
I make a comment about killers being too fast and I get pounced on but there are memes of how fast the killers are. Lol 
---
lmao
---
If you play the game enough it's impossible not to get to Rank 1. Well, unless you're bad at the game.
---
Oh boi I wont argue about killer tier list with you man \^\^ There are far better players than both of us that agreed on the list and neutral decided on killers strengths and weaknesses
---
Just compare Wraith to lets say nurse or billy or doc on the game :D   
---
Anyway have a nice day 
---
It's easy to say that and pretend it's that simple, try developing a game with no progression/grind and see how well it will do in the long term. DbD has been around for more than 2 and half years, having a fun core gameplay is essential, but without progression it's tough to keep a game. Some games can do it? Good for them. Most can't.
---
I afk and go do something else. Standing on the hatch. Longest time so far was 2 hours standoff. Quite amusing.
---
Hey. Don't be a shithead. It's an accomplishment to some players.
---
Some better math:  
---
Sloppy adds 4 seconds to 2 people healing and 8 seconds to selfcare. This means every single injured state you cause adds 8 seconds to survivors objectives. Ruin active means that every single skillcheck that is hit as "good" will be 8 seconds you get aswell.  
---
Ignoring games where Ruin is up for very long or very short and focusing on average both perks should add about 80 seconds (1 Gen) to survivor objectives.  
---
Now why Ruin is better: While both can add about equal time through their effect, Ruin adds on top that it makes people go and walk around, searching for a totem on top of similar time added to the game. This means its overall stronger.  
---
The only time you should take Sloppy Butcher instead is when you really dislike the RNG nature of Ruin and want your value to be consistent through your games.
---
It was you who talked about low tier killers, but that's not the point of my comment. Now that you replied to the first sentence, you could read the actual comment and give me your thoughts, because I give you solutions fo your problems. Have a nice day.
---
I have ran in to the same thing. One of my friends was playing as killer and after the match one of them sent a message to her say something like you suck go kill your self. 
---
Like really people it's just a game 
---
"Oof." 
---
    -nea (probably)
---
Interesting. I wouldnt risk my account for a few cosmetics tho, prestige is worthless anyway, since the clothes i want bloody arent the basic ones :/ i wish they added an option to get all the clothes you own bloody when you prestige..THen i would do it a lot.

This was good. I like this pun!

Naw. Afk and stand on hatch.  Waste as much time for the survivors as possible. Maybe eventually the devs will finally fix this train wreck of a mechanic. Unlikely since they are so terrible.
---
I had an error spelling Wraith. Oof, I typed wrathe. Thanks for your help!
---
I know him mostly for league of legends stuff, he’s not bad (abit loud for me) a lot of people like him sinces he can be realy funny whilst also being actualy good at the game

Is it just me or is wraith pretty good
---
Is that a bulge on her shorts?

well, no surprise on Rank 17

---
IKR! When a match starts he is like "oh bad map, we'll be definitely losing this they look coordinated as hell" when in reality the survivors play so badly most of the time but he always mentions how he "outplays" them to boost his ego and tell his stream what a true talent he really is when most survivors can't even pallet loop and just run in a straight line. "That was such a rough match but I played so well and outplayed this coordinated swf group". Cringe af.

isn't that the vhs porn?

There is literally a post about about this every day if not more...

just laugh at those pathetic People.

Oink

The comment section lol

can you care about me too?

But I like game...

You may want to change that flair feom Discussion to Salt/Rant
---
so true
---
This meme was relevant like 6 months ago when the sub was flooded with “look at me im rank one so cool!!!!” But now we all know being rank one is just a shithole. 
---
well jen and co. have to run circles around a nub killer somehow lmao
---
getting all tilted about a game, my god
---
And how the hell are you Rank 17 if you get consistent 4ks
---
Soon as it involves performance we don't get a response. You should know this by now
---
he actually is, but Myers is the best boi
---
You dont seem to undestand this, so i will explain this to you ! 
---
TUNNELING means going for the unhooked and injured survivor to secure a kill. What is NOT BANNABLE ! 
---
Going for you over the course of multiple matches just to piss you off and harass you, everytime the killer sees you in his looby, that is indeed bannable !  
---
You unhook someone&gt; he goes for you ! 
---
You work with others a gen &gt; he goes for you ! 
---
You just wander around &gt; He ignores actively any other survivor just to get you ! 
---
You are getting facecamped after caputres, every single match you are against this killer. 
---
This post makes you look like a bad sport and a dick, because guess what, i dont care what you play, if you are nothing more than a crybaby, than you should play other games. 
---
The bugs are absolutely terrible with this patch. 
---
Free weekender
---
He is offline because you blocked him. So. You can't see him. 
---
Is a pretty long time ago
---
Zubat and Scott tryhard? lmao id say Tru3 is the biggest tryhard out of all of them
---
As I said I won't argue over facts I'm sorry 
---
Do the comparison yourself or watch some else do it for you on YT 
---
You too
---
Wouldn't say no but not where I was going lol
---
Nope I tested it with ky friend on kyf I blocked him and I saw him
---
I care about you :)
---
Sure A person that gives you somthing for free  and STEALING IT from the person has basically the same meaning, you get something. 
---
See what a flaw your logic has  -.-,  
---
Its not the killers fault that you unhook while he is still around and for the love of got gens are so fast done, he needs to go for the injured survivor in order to win. 
---
Dead hard is only usually good the first time using it in the game because the killer doesn't expect it balanced landing is my favourite but it sucks on that map where all you can do it on is the tree
---
I see youre up to date on all the good memes.
---
He just spreads so much false information and has no clue about the game.
---
He only found out 1.5 years after nurse's release that she actually moves slower than survivors.
---
He often immediately looked for survivors in the area where he spawned as a killer although survivors can never spawn next to you.
---
He forgets a lot of things regarding the game in general and tells wrong information about perks, character's abilities etc.
---
There's just so much stuff going on in his stream that makes me shake my head.
---
What I also noticed recently is that he often changes his opinion when the community or other streamers point something out. Like he said legion was fine and fun to play against but when he noticed a lot of people complain about no counterplay he suddenly changed his mind and also says there is no counterplay all of a sudden. Or how he always referred to shack pallet as "godpallet" when other streamers started to say that to make him look smart because this pallet can't be countered although there is lots of ways to mindgame shack and other pallets that are even saver.
---
He just wants to look smart and seen as a god tier player but considering how many thousands of hours he has he is just awful compared to people with the same amount of experience in this game. And I personally don't know how one can have so many hours in the game and not have all characters P3 level 50 with all or mostperks. He hasn't even leveled up most survivors and none of them or his killers except huntress are p3 either. He is the only streamer I know who is so far behind, maybe because he just gets little BP the way he plays idk. 
---
Have 28 hours and I’m offended /s
---
jendenise at it again? I thought she was reformed :D I guess you cant since all ur swf are doing it all
---
This was a while back, ehat dbd memes were popular then?
---
I made it to rank 5 yesterday :3 
---
Then change the flair to Salt/Rant because you don't want to discuss anything. 
---
they say its because of cue times, and wider variety of killers
---
I watch monto most of the time. Idk if he is as good as the others you mentioned, but he is fun to watch and generally a good killer/survivor.
---
too much salt
---
Also freddy can say fuck but mostly says DARN
---
I think it would work in a different way- it tracks the time that your characters were prestiged, so if you prestiged the same character more than once within a certain time frame (say, 5 minutes) then it would autoban you
---
what am I missing here?
---
Underrated comment.
---
I am not saying tryhard in a negative way. I enjoy watching people that actually play to win. Majority of the time zubat and scott are running same perks and same killers that they find effective while tru3 is playing a lot more varied builds and such. Why are people always taking tryhard as an insult
---
You play him for 2 years and he is only p2 level 16 and rank 17? I see lies. Also, doctor is low tier killer who is extremely easy to counter, I doubt anyone can get 4k's consistendly as him. Well against decent survivors and not rank 17 at least.
---
People say Marth (or even Ardetha) are better Nurses than Zubat and I simply can't see it. Zubat is by far the best Nurse player I've ever watched and this challenge just made that even more obvious for me.
---
Lmao 
---
Live with a deny mate the only one trying to provoke flame and salt is you

Grow up and accept a no kid

Will mute you to prevent anymore flame here

Happy life

Clipped 4 months ago, Submitter has no Karma.
---
Is someone trying to advertise oneself as a streamer here?
---
I really don't know how people like you make it through the day.
---
I want a jack the ripper killer
---
It was meant to be.
---
If it was a SWF, they don't realise that the effect can't get higher than purple
---
He was farmed.  Toxic survivor gameplay.
---
If a good survivor unhooks them that quickly they know their job is to bodyblock the killer and/or taunt them into a chase to save the unhooked player.
---
How bad we talking here?
---
She really did, i mean since when can a killer work on gens ? 
---
\*plays seinfield theme\* 
---
Or...or...double yhe map size, 10 survivors, and 4 killers but the only killer you can play as is legion.
---
While id love new modes this would still leave 6 gens popping while 2 are chased. Either less survivors or longer gen times would be needed.
---
It's the same as 1 purple one. Fog has 3 levels of thickness. Brown increases by 1 level, yellow by 2 and purple by 3. So to have max thickness, you use either 1 purple, 1 brown and 1 yellow or 3 brown
---
They literally cant do anything until dedicated servers. Right now the game goes on the killers server, so if they DC the gam cannot process what actually happened and apply anything to you.
---
the thing is, that at rank 15-10 w have all those rank1 derankers that just go there to troll killers and even if you go to the basement and wait there they just roam around the map breaking hooks, failing gens until you chase them and have no choice except taking the hatch
---
I’d rather be 80 year old me than 20 year old you?
---
You can also hit them from many angles
---
Highest I reached is 8 will post later. I posted this because I got the pic today
---
1024
---
Nonono, survivors would win almost every game
---
you really haven't played on red ranks if you call Doctor unbeatable
---
You cant say you play killer and like it, you will be downvotes just saying, the suvs outmatch you 4 to 1 , so dont even come up with logic, they will ignore it and dont give and real constructive criticism to make killer playing nicer, they will call you "[killer.baby](https://killer.baby)" and downvote you to oblivian.
---
Oh welcome to the subreddit btw. 
---
Honestly I was just thinking it would just be fun to have all 4 legions on the field.
---
It definitely is
---
If you are new to the game I'd recommend Michael 
---
Rank reset
---
Someone disconnected right as the map loaded 
---
I've played hatch standoffs about 10 games.  First time I didn't know about grab and died.  Standoffs I committed to, I won.  The two times (both vs huntress) that I went to do objectives, I got one gen (needed 3), then died when huntress came to find me.  Fuck doing objectives... Never works for me.
---
Why!? Why would there be an option that turns off the skillcheck visual? It's a fckin part of the core gameplay! 
---
XD this seems like it would be a blast in KYF
---
For addons you don't have to wory, there is no max
---
Thing is he doesnt even try to be a little bit humble. Thats what makes it bad.
---
You're right. This is horrible. Wraith looks like he's holding a flashlight or plunger or some shit. Huntress is..just so fucked. Michael looks like he is holding a turd, perhaps that is where his other hand is going?  
---
Though the fingers in the top right are pretty well drawn.
---
Says you, my kids threw me a party so suck it.😤 lol
---
All addons stack unless the description says otherwise
---
Wasn't meant to be good or accurate :P 
---
I watched enough streamers and played enough to notice that the constantly dcing suvivors still play until this day, so you are wrong. 
---
Have you even played on console? These devs couldn't optimize DBD for switch if they tried.
---
https://youtu.be/6oprcKowb-8?t=6
---
sure? I never got above Rank 15 and couldnt even drop below 15
---
Lol hes right same 10 people at rank 1 mate. It gets boring
---
Honestly, teaming is also amoung the bannable things on PC, but many people warm without a problem, you should be safe if you decide to farm
---
He's just as fast in T3 as in T2
---
Overcharge is useless btw.
---
(vault speed)
---
Yes I see
---
WAHluigu?
---
Ouch My Bones made me laugh pretty hard. 😂
---
*Wah's romantically*
---
&gt; And I personally don't know how one can have so many hours in the game and not have all characters P3 level 50 with all or mostperks.
---
fudge doesn't have a single prestiged character. I think he has more than 4k hours in the game. Not everyone likes to prestige, you know.
---
Wouldn’t that handicap the team anyway though? Also I’d just consider that player abusing the mechanic. So in that case yeah I understand why BHVR covered the perks. When my friends and I play the game we actually try to all survive and consider it almost the same as a loss if we don’t. 
---
I do it for one of two reasons:
---
- To be sure my teammates get out, since I usually run Borrowed Time &amp; don't care if I die saving someone
---
or
---
- If all teammates are safe, and the killer hasn't played like an asshole, I will let the killer get points by hitting me down into the exit gate. If I'm the only one left and I see you at the back of the exit gate, I literally am still here so you can hit me &amp; down me. I still escape, you get extra points too. Also applies if you're a Doctor who wants shock points.
---
I have a dream that one day, killers and survivors can ascend together and achieve enlightenment
---
I'm a totem-hunter by nature so I never assume NOED is in play, but I generally assume BBQ. I rarely run into Nurse's.
---
That explains the pink keys and insta heals every damn game
---
Dude don't bother. I don't even like ochido but getting people to not follow their outrage narrative is impossible.
---
This keeps happening in my games. One survivor straight up disappears like I can't spectate them and it doesn't say they exited but the game is over.
---
Have you guys found out what cause the freezing of the game on PC ? It is getting ridiculous. In the past 2 hours I've played my game froze 3 times and while I was playing as a killer 3 out of 4 games where vs 3 survivors / someone did not even connect probably cause of the same reason/...
---
It has some small value, but not in regards to slowing down the game.
---
Doctor came out only a little more than 1 year ago...
---
The fuck what now? So they’re discouraging teamwork... in a game where teamwork is encouraged... cool. 
---
So if two people are on the same gen, it repairs *slower* than solo, or just slower *than previously*?
---
Omg I just tried this and I love it 
---
"Miss Obama, get down" 
---
Yeah biggest bullshit story ever lmao
---
Isn't it Monto himself singing that?
---
You're just lucky beyond any reason I could hope to grasp.
---
It's okay at rank 1. Most people are high hour players who are all "toxic'd out" like fr we just don't care anymore so we're never toxic. The other half are the ones who haven't been rank 1 long that tryhard with meta perks and etc.
---
Tupac cares, if don’t nobody else care.
---
I LOVE this song, one of the main reasons i even watch monto
---
I love you.
---
They will still stack all the same. 
---
Yes but only if you're reported so if everyone is farming together nobody will report.
---
I never understand why people don’t judge finish the last gen. If you know for sure the killer is hatch camping with one gen left. Just finish it. It pressures the killer off the hatch to check exit gates then guess what? You get the hatch. Works for me every time 
---
"How dare you feel proud of yourself" 
---
Rank 1 may be a shithole, but it still took a lot of people a long time to get there. Don't be an asshole, let people be happy. 
---
What a pussy
---
What a stud
---
Yeah kinda. If all maps were Meat Plants or Hospital they could make scratched mirror even slower.
---
Can u PM the video or how to do it can find nothing on it
---
Say what you want about it, but I like it. Yes, I haven't gotten used to it yet and it takes more tome to get the item because I first stand there for 3 seconds trying to figuer out what to do next, but I am a huge fan of consistency and this feels way more concistent
---
The best thing you can do work towards earning your place there is to embrace the suck (and the depip) and do your best to loop the killers. Try to avoid taking sneaking perks like Urban Evasion, or certain second chance perks, namely Decisive Strike. Unbreakable or Adrenaline would be a good idea though.
---
I ran into a legion with franks mix tape and an ebony mori the other day. I don’t play survivor often, but usually as a break from killer. I’ve used the combo before, but never experienced it. Good thing he didn’t tunnel me completely but I still got killed in the end. It say fair enough, a taste of my own medicine, but I refuse to use franks mix tape on random survivors. If I’m against survivors that I know have toxic tendencies, then I use the combo. I usually just run movement speed, recovery, duration etc on anyone else. I’ve not been playing Legion much recently anyways. 
---
Seeing as how when a killer sees no one on BBQ they like to camp, no. If the killer comes to me so be it. They honestly shouldn't have added the locker buff.
---
Lol, I'll make shure to change my name to "1 point bill" tap a generator once and then go afk
---
There was never a extra animation for picking up an item from the chest lol.. you'd just get the item after the chest search animation finishes.

Spirit main here, so I won't personally be reaping the benefits of less pallets per say - but overall I'll be happy if more killers start becoming viable. I  hope to god that the devs don't go the stealth route though. There is nothing fun about running around the map for 10 mins without finding any survivors, nor is there anything fun about cowering behind rocks and working on gens. I'm glad that Trapper is getting the buffs he needs, but frankly I still think he's going to be weak against any competant players that understand the power of foresight/planning ahead when playing against him.

&gt;to slow the game down a little bit

To slow the game down, just a little bit

I think I may just have to buy them all at this rate

Yes
---
They're only banning because of the new exploit lol
---
Clown is be better than Michael tbh
---
No, that's what Peter gives Mary Jane every night.
---
Thanks man :) 
---
I haven't installed it yet and I'm proper cut
---
Overcharge is useless.
---
You don't need surveillance if you have discordance, choose between them.
---
Tinkerer is okay but I think you're better using thanatophobia, ruin or some other perk that directly affects the speed of repairs.
---
It was the original plan, they even made add-ons but scrapped the idea for an unknown reason.
---
Since there are licenced killers in that list I assume you want to buy them with money. I can't stop you, but do you really want to buy a killer with money if you can just unlock them trough gameplay? I bought all licenced killers and unlocked the rest trough regular gameplay. It just gives you something to work towards appart from prestiging your characters.
---
However, my nr 1 pick is definitely spirit, michael is also a fun one and after that, I would say pig. Please note that I'm just saying them in order of amount of fun I get out of them and not in order of how strong I think they are
---
They've already said she can't sorry
---
All the pigs I met on PS4 are such disgusting players. They either give you the reverse bear trap, then camp AND tunnel you if you get unhooked. Like... what’s the point of playing Pig then?
---
One even lived out his pseudo-SAW fantasies with me. 
---
Spirit 100% strong killer, very fun to play and she's just an overall queen.
---
It would count, but the ban level is really high. Just play fair, don't drop out of games and you'll be nowhere near the mark for a ban; It's actually really high.
---
Jokes on you, I can’t hit rank 1!

What build would you recommend for the huntress.

He also added me on Steam and asked me if I was "having fun" and that he's "chillin'" and that I could get up there if I knew how.

---
I like how legitimate items and perk combinations are allowed because they are rare, but seen as shit if they were able to be used every game. Sounds to me like shit game design.
---
I remember thinking the same thing with divine blessings in dark souls. The best games always have permanent unlocks, where the developers have to actually work at balancing all the available options.
---
Yeah but Legion was designed so that he could win chases; that’s why it takes 4 attacks from Frenzy to down you without Frank’s. The reason Frank’s makes him have no counterplay is because it opens up the “moonwalking chases” mechanic and that you can’t do anything about if they’re running Bloodhound.
---
Oh, I don't even like talking about Nurse. I don't D/C from games or anything, but man when we load in and I see a bloody nurse, particularly at red ranks, I die a little inside. I don't understand how that killer can remain as-is in this game.
---
Like even after falling through a window she does move a bit so her hair would've settled. it just doesnt make any sense to me. but i figured id pick peoples brains
---
They usually stop being interesting and start being tedious af... but at least me if the guy can reach the hatchet he is out, not up for 20m of staring/baiting.
---
Ha, that's actually something I didn't consider. Do you do that to deny them in normal play, or only when they're abusing something like the walking backward?
---
I don't understand why some killers play like this.
---
Its so fucking boring
---
I just ran out :/
---
Fucking brilliant.
---
I really want them 
---
Sucker I play console so we can't get past what feels like 30 frames we just experience every other problem known to DBD... I forgot what I was trying to brag about
---
I would say no because there has to be intent behind tunneling. He was unfortunately just the person you found everytime.
---
Whats this about Legion walking backwards?
---
Just a little quick sketch I did while watching Jendenise's stream.
---
I should have uploaded the prior gameplay leading to this. I was actually approaching the window and as soon a I got to it he was already on the other side and climbed through. I tried to do something on the fly.
---
I have actually successfully done some window juking but him stopping to stare at me cracked me up so much and my window jukes, even when performed as suggested, aren't always very successful :)
---
Id report it personally the guys intentionally going somewhere you cant. 
---
Im sure if you walk at it a certain angle you can get up there but thats not the point
---
OK SO I JUST WANNA SAY THIS, this is my first post on reddit that I made myself, I never expected it to blow up so much! I’m glad everyone likes it!

Tunnelling is when you focus on a survivor only because you've hurt them a lot already. If he's the only survivor you see, then it's not tunnelling.
---
Yeah I have had some stupidly-long standoffs, worse being in a game with 3 disconnects and against a trapper. 3 gens left, and it was at least a 20-minute standoff...
---
Played against mori if ur horni last week, for some reason I won't forget that name.
---
From a gameplay perspective, time stop would be frustrating and lull the game, making it not overly fun to play. Theres two killers out there that, while they can't turn into survivors they do have the boon that they can pose as one so I feel as though fire would be the best of the three. It could be used to corral survivors in a way where she would theoretically be viable as an "anti looping" sort of killer.

First and last warning.

So you’re saying all ghosts need to follow the horror standard? Sorry but no.
---
&gt; and that I could get up there if I knew how.

You can. You can also hit him if you knew how
---
Lol, I don't have the patience for that.
---
Personally I dont think the prestige exploit is bad. There is much better things to worry about than people getting some bloody skins. I have heard you can exploit the blood web to get unlimited offerings and add- ons, but I havent seen much on that. Just a few comments saying you can. Not sure how it works or anything though.
---
Disconnect + mlga block takes 15 seconds. I just dodge every legion player I seee and my game enjoyment experience has increased by 100%.
---
I don't blame bad players for abusing a broken killer though. It's not your fault you're too bad to actually learn how to play the game and win.
---
Suck my dick ;)
---
I saw the four dwights in match lobby with default outfits. After a little bit of looking, I checked the basement, and sure enough, they were all in their own locker. I picked and hooked three, and let the fourth off, to let him unhook, and it spiraled into a descent of horrifying Dwight rituals. The only time bubba has carried someone OUT of the basement, I suspect

Lmao toxic community mad they cant get past rank 7 so they try to rag on rank 1s. you guys are too funny. rank 1 does mean something regardless of your salty opinions. if it didnt then everyone would be able to get it but even hiding and sandbagging doesnt get you pips so the only way to do is to play the game learn how to loop and stop being so damn salty 
---
This is 4 perks basically doing the same job for you. Overkill
---
I've done this exact same thing, tho the survivor was fair and I got the sacrifice cause I went out of my way to avoid being toxic.
---
So Legion's bleed pauses when you are in a chase with him. However, what some abusive players have been doing is getting you to start bleeding, and then they chase you while turning their camera away. This allows them to stay on you but since they're not looking right at you, the game doesn't treat it as a chase and you keep bleeding. 
---
You cannot really just stop and mend because they're on you, and you can't keep running because you'll go down. There are a couple of youtube videos of people doing this, one of them you can see the Legion perfectly tracking people while running backward and staying locked in on scratch marks. Some of them use perks to make it easier to keep track of the "chased" player. It's so toxic.
---
Removed - Shaming other players
---
YouTube and it’s funny how the devs built the exploit right into there own game, the L2 &amp; R2 is the problem 
---
Mods please pin this!
---
The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is a sweet rusty meat hook.
---
Can you show us proof you are banned?
---
Not only that, Tru3 played rotation with survivor for most of it, which would at least cut his time down by 40%. He also played when the better players were rushing to rank 1. 
---
This essentially sounds like lagswitching. But I love her character concept and some fire could be really cool. 😛
---
Because not using the strongest perks makes you a try hard instead of someone looking for a challenge or trying to make the game more difficult. There is no mental gymnastics around this. 
---
I'd count that as a mixtape, in certain cases...
---
Seriously, that killer could have played 2 more game with the time wasted on this hatch standoff.
---
That's why I don't understand why people complain about hatch stand offs. People are literally bitching that the other player won't concede victory and it just ends up being a waste of everyones time when you could be playing your next game.

Those two are hardcore Huntress Main which played that one killer more than I played all my killer together. Check their VODs or ask them while they are live.  
---
If I were to play Huntress however I would probably go something like BBQ, Nurces Calling, Ruin and Deerstalker. Mainly cause I am not very used to all nearby locker positions and thus Slugs sometimes crawl off a few meters causing me to search them for 10-15 seconds or more which wastes too much time.
---
Killers doing there objective. Horrible. Especially when he cares about points and usually points out when he is losing points being near the hook. People love leaving out information. 
---
Nope. He’s powerful. 100%. 
---
Almost a thousand points now
---
it's a bug
---
Hence why when Tru3 is using perks he tries to NOT 2 pip consistently to slow it down a bit. He is literally facing the best of rank 1's. 
---
"Hey dude watch what I can do"
---
You say that, but he actually did tunnel a good bit and when someone offered Haddonfield he actually said after his first hook "I don't care who burned it, this survivor's getting camped" and he did until he found someone trying to save.
---
I gave him a cum tribute.
---
A man of culture I see.
---
You dont need it the new update made rare spawns from chests more common i got a purple key 3 times in a row

Not sure why you want proof lol but here you go champ

And in that hour, you could've gotten so many more stacks if you just used that noodle of yours.
---
That may be, but he is confident and he is good at the game. No amount of obfuscation will change this. How come I am the only one that pointed out he played survivor rotation on his 3-4 days getting rank 1 with both, playing about 5 hours a day? That is because people want to be right and make the side they "despise" look at bad at possible.   
---
If I admit he might have an ego problem, then you can at least admit that playing rank 1 fresh rank reset is more difficult then doing it later. You can also admit that at least 40% of the time spent on the challenge was playing survivor.

I think it would be quite balanced because the killers could work together to make it impossible for a survivor to escape. I did a more in detail post about a 4 killer and 16 survivor gamemode a while back
---
the real horror in this game are the bugs and glitches
---
I think 8 would be needed
---
I laughed so hard when he swatted you down
---
Literally all the survivors could have been perkless, what separated the two streamers' successes was not skill but the play style of injure-down-hook injure-down-hook vs. getting as many players slugged as possible to waste more of the survivors' time.
---
The only possible way it’s bannable is if someone reports it in the first place.

I told you why I was banned, you can believe it or not.

Why is the 4000 BP add on in white as if to imply you can afford it but the 3000 BP one is in red?

This shouldn't be funny to me
---
Oh damn. I was convinced the games would be consistent with OnHit effects considering I took that from the idea that Huntress cannot use her hatchets to NOED people.
---
Think about the bullshit the killers could pull off in duos. Legion and doctor, nurse and doctor, hag and nurse, fuck two bubbas could terrifying. 
---
No it is usually not fun but easiest way to get the achievement 
---
Survivors would get fucking creampied lmao
---
They wouldn't ever ban content creators because they're free publicity
---
Thank you!!!
---
Isn't unbreakable a second chance perk... 
---
Heavybrogaming, the reason he doesn't get better is because he realizes when he's losing but he always blames it on the game, he's perfect, never makes a mistake.
---
No one will be getting a ban. Maybe the ones going 3 prestige levels at a time within seconds which is way too obvious but that's it. Even if you prestige multiple characters, as long as you do it just once it will be okay since realistically you can level multiple characters to 50 and prestige them at the same time.
---
Items? Same thing. They'd have to go manually looking at every single person save file and decide if they used the glitch to buy certain addons, unless it's blatantly obvious like having an obscene amount of the same one... and even then it can be argued that you just don't use them (like me having so many iridescent hatchets because I don't like using them, and I main huntress). Just, nah. They're doing damage control as best as they can but that's it. Also, you can do the exploit on PC so I don't really know why they focus so much on saying console every single time, probably because, again, they don't want people to know you can do it on PC as well. Pretty funny stuff. It's what happens when you balance your game around consumable items instead of actual real progression and fair play. Fuck their BP economy.
---
[**DO YOU WANT BROWN, OR YELLOW ADDONS?**](/intensifies)
---
Yeah, maybe they should rework Tombstone + Fragrant Tuft so everyone actually gets points.
---
I uh, I like them when I play killer. Gives survivors a false sense of security as long as my eyes are fixed to the scratch marks... Sometimes I go on top of the tractor and I can see survivors crouched hiding, even more useful tactic when someone's hooked.
---
My biggest pet peeve is I can't stalk through corn fields and they randomly break chase which is super annoying 
---
If you chase someone before until a lot of pallets are destroyed then they will have more than 1 or 2 gens done except when you have ruin but they usually find it 
---
So everything else was even? Tru3 was not rotating survivor to add time? He was not facing people with no perk? Tru3 also played vs  survivors fresh rank reset, which means the best people possible rushing to rank 1, is who he was facing. 
---
His need to not slug is annoying, and costs him games at times. 
---
Do what you want, just remember you are playing with other people who want to enjoy the game. Not every survivor is a toxic swf teabagger who deserves to be tunnelled and camped, just like not every killer is a toxic tunneller and camper
---
Clown and Legion would totally get along. Both are fast as fuck, both kill people just for laughs and kicks and neither need a fancy 2 feet long blade to kill. A pocket knife works just fine.
---
Got to visit the bathroom, and the freezer... Try to get the key out.
---
He also abused bugs (not in this stream, a different one) to intentionally derank and bragged about it while showing it on stream, then crushed newbies and bragged about how bad they were. 
---
He is doing killer rotation what is understandable why he is not prestiging.
---
Most that you see probably only do it once in a while, but I imagine if they do it 10 times in 48 hours or something they'll probably get hit by something.
---
It's a thing from Zubat's chat - to repeat some messages 4-5 times by different viewers.

yes this happened before i expressed my intentions of reporting

Never heard this idea before!
---
Were not gonna miss you either. Bye 
---
Keep hitting them. Even though they have No Mither, they can only recover so many times before the bleed-out timer ends.
---
And why are they given to you for free?
---
Cause legion's power is busted.
---
r/woooosh
---
Oh great I’m so excited get banned for sometimes having a shitty connection thanks devs! Oh and still nothing about optimization? Thanks devs!
---
Good to know
---
That’s no different than my games now soooooo
---
Awwwww they're so cuuuuute. :D
---
Everyone who has been to rank 19 knows that ruin gets found fast... I know this but run it because i have nothing better really... Got a game where no gens were done and i got a 4k, first thing ingame chat was "ruin is op" like its not one of the most useless perks in the game. Either found or good survs just hit those greats.
---
If she fell through the window her hair would be flying everywhere as she fell.
---
Like if you have long hair on a rollercoaster it'll fly up.
---
That's how I think of it.
---
But also they probably just did it because it looks cool, and for game balancing purposes makes her more visible across the map since she has small stature.
---
Usually if they don’t struggle and weren’t a dick I’ll give them hatch. Keeps the community a little less toxic and I lose like 1,500 points.
---
AKA Reddit Bronze
---
Oh it certainly won’t lmao. They’re just scared about the progression not being tediously slow
---
Like others if the game was fun ill drop them on it but its less and less occuring the closer to red you get...
---
noted!! thanks for the advice! i’ll definitely keep this is mind :)
---
First I tought it was my SFW group, but we haven't run into a leatherface yet and the dwights on the picture aren't pizza delivery dwights
---
Highest you have reached is rank 8 and you are only level 43 when you have played for 2 years? Have you played 1 match every two days for 2 whole years or something?
---
Is that what happened to that agent in Dirk Gently?
---
And then the devs have the gall to say that not every killer should be rank 1 viable. Come on, devs.
---
How do I do it? I want to check
---
I saved them up and haven't used them yet. Gonna save them for later when they're not as common anymore 
---
so you're using the glitch too huh?
---
"A lot of people" 
---
"Im not addicted to bloodpoints, but if i don't get it, i get a lil crazy."
---
Why do survivors think that the killer is going to just leave a survivor who's hooked after the gate is open? There's no gens left. Their only objective is, literally, to secure any kills they can get at that point. 
---
just look it up on youtube. "dead by daylight exploit" or something, then sort by newest, or uploaded this week.
---
No ur wrong plz tell me I am special ok 
---
Smasher could literally break anything and it seemed OP to give a killer an ability to destroy any obstacles. Not sure about the teacher. 
---
And some reddit user says there is nothing the dedicated servers will be able to fix.
---
You have brain damage.
---
No not really.
---
Lol, imagine ruining 4 other players experience because you don't like legion! Just play it.
---
And tell me you've never used a broken weapon/character in a videogame before.
---
300 ping spike btw, followed by an immediate dc from the killer 
---
I think they mean second chances after a survivor's mistake. Unbreakable would be the killer's mistake because they left you there.

He’ll bleed out eventually. I’d report him anyways though. Exploiting a glitch.

You've just been lucky. There's plenty of hostage takers (mostly Survivors, but some Killers) sandbaggers, teamers, and lagswitchers on console.
---
I got so many good pastas from Patrick's stream, Zubat ILYSM zubSAD
---
This can be said about any YouTuber/streamer. Most fanbases are cults.
---
I don’t really get what you want survivors to do. Not loop the lower tier killers incase they change to a better killer? Eh? And then saying because of looping lower tier killers survivors bring ‘it’ on themselves. If by ‘it’ you mean higher tier killers then no, that’s not true at all. Even without looping, the higher tier killers would still be the most popular, because most killers want a fairly easy 4k. That’s got nothing to do with how the survivors play at all and it’s weird to blame them for that. Honestly this post is so confusing op. 
---
Ha. Stupid survivors.
---
exactly
---
It's a copypasta bub.
---
Very cool
---
What? No dude because they flashlight clicked and teabag and vault pallets back-and-forth obnoxiously just to get your attention, not just because they play of the game. You need to chill your beans dude
---
I agree, I used to play more cautious but it's so freaking boring. I don't know how people have fun crab walking around the map the whole game. Plus it drags the match on longer than it should which is in the killers favor.
---
For me, what worked to get me being less cautious was using Bond. You hear the killers heart beat and seeing him chasing your teammate around let's you know you can sit on that generator a little longer instead of running and hiding. If no one on your team is there and the killer is getting closer then find a wall and pallet to hide and maybe stun. That actually helped me to learn how to loop better.
---
And dont even think about trying when your facing a streamer with a 4man, if you show an ounce of skill they will trash talk you like you were a garbage man... Played against a legacy streamer and 3k'd because last guy dc'd right when i went to hook so bbq didnt proc and he got the hatch. 
---
Literally willing to lose all points and 2 pips so their streamer gets an escape...
---
And the salt in endgane was unimaginable. Couldn't make it up, even though i played like normal my private profile meant i was toxic... No toxic perks or addons... Just my private profile... Bunch of red ranks with a rank 20. Had half the nerve to tell the streamer to tell his community to calm down.
---
Break ruin. 1 stack of Thana does nothing. If you're getting grabbed from the hook you're doing the unhook wrong.
---
No one's that lucky bud. 
---
 🦀  OCHIDO IS GONE  🦀 
---
Read it again slowly 
---
I don't want them to not pallet or vault 
---
But the infinite loops is what I don't like vs a low tier killer 
---
There are way better options 
---
A more stealthy playstyle etc 
---
Much more fun for both sides 
---
You sound like the kind of guy who teabags and then gets hooked and then waits the entire game just to slam the killer at the end because you’re trash and got mad
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/FamousTardyGoldfishSeemsGood

Self-care unless your a looping god
---
does this mean ima get banned for abusing the prestige glitch lmao RIP
---
Not to mention his increased vault speed + Bamboozle.
---
What, are killers supposed to all have fucking Nurse’s base speed? 115% isn’t remotely too fast. The only thing that’s too fast is gens at high ranks. This image is a joke with the fastest vaulting killer (excluding Legion power), combined with two perks that increase vaulting speed.

The gen progress aura intensity is an add-on for wraith, not a perk.

This one carries ancient forbidden knowledge.

Lol, you gotta get all those perks back and grind. Fuck that shit if they banned me I would quit

It’s not too unreasonable. Anyone can make it to rank one. Just takes time. Once you’re decent, you can kill with just M1 and no perks. Look at Demi. 4K with Billy on Lery’s with no perks.

Yeah but he's already done that 3 times now no? Pretty sure he got banned on PC, started grinding perks and what not, got perma banned, moved to Playstation and started from scratch again. I'd never play again if I had to start over after having every perk and almost every killer p3 50 no thanks. But he makes money from his videos of course he's gonna make a new one. 
---
Hex: Devour Ass 
---
Don't pull this down to some killer vs survivor I never said that 
---
And the jungle gym, and the shack are still insanely long for low tier player and casual player 
---
Of course when you play 5k hours you can make reads and stuff but I talk about 90% of the player having difficulty with these "infinite"
---
Theres a glitch that crashes the killers game if you dc in their hands happened to me too
---
What? I deranked on stream during the hallowed blight event so I could actually find matches to farm serum. I never bragged about killing/stomping newbies? Please show me the proof of me crushing newbies and bragging about how bad they were. The only time I ever call a survivor bad is if they start BMing and then play poorly. I also always let the last survivor farm the serum they needed to fill their vials after I killed everyone else during that event.
---
I don't know about survivors … but you've just convinced me that you're the biggest baby on the planet. 👍
---
Pretty sure he used some exploits n stuff to hold the game hostage or absolutely ruin some peoples days
---
nice. zubat is definitely the best if not the most true ly talented killers

Not defending him, but my conspiracy theory is that he was targeted just to put a scare into people using the prestige glitch. He wasn’t banned for that, but it’s definitely going to make people think twice about it! I would like to see more of an explanation as to why he was banned though. It said griefing but their description of that is targeting a specific  player over multiple games, and not toxic gameplay. The reason given doesn’t really fit. I know people just want him gone and I totally get it, I’m just interested in details as to why. I think it’s needed.
---
Ban evasion on ps4. evasion on pc. Cheating on pc. Exploiting. Taking game hostage. General cuntary.
---
Guess that's why we have to punish you with pallet loops.
---
Yeah tier 3 evil within has a 1.3 s vault time (normal is 1.7), and increased lunge range too.
---
Fights crying with crying. Nice. 
---
Your alright mate. Sorry for having it be a massive wall of text. If you have anymore questions feel free to ask them and I'll answer to the best of my ability.
---
:crab: OCHIDO IS GONE :crab:
---
They will ban him again for ban evasion. Again. As soon as he shows his gamer tag he's fucked. Unless he blocks it out on ever video and all of the friends he plays with too, he's fucked.
---
This is the best crab meme I’ve seen ever. 
---
The wall of text didn't bother me lol, it's just the start of a new semester. Thanks a bunch! I really appreciate it 
---
Link? ( this guy is very popular on getting banned it seems lol) 
---
Griefing was the reason given on the screen
---
FUCK YES FINALLY 
---
Idea of u/Greater-Cultist 
---
Could you point me in the right direction or show me someone who will i can't find anything on this 
---
It's really not that hard. He could even make a name with a bunch of lower case Ls and capital i's to make it even harder. He's just gonna keep coming back. They've banned him 3 or 4 times and it didn't stop him. 
---
What about people who, upon getting hooked for the first time, immediately use their three escape attempts, then put up no struggle and die instantly?
---
I figured so, I've played handful of Billy but primarily play Clown, and Myers. 
---
I was the same way till I stopped running perks like sprint burst/ self heal/ urban evasion.
---
I'd suggest bringing dead hard or balanced landing. (Lithe is not very useful)
---
I also suggest swapping urban/ spring burst for spine chill. The knowledge that they're coming to your gen so you can quickly look for a pallet setup is useful.
---
Don't hide behind very small debris/ trees. The moment they spot you you start the chase injured and close to them. Run to tall walls that have pallets nearby and run circles near the opposite end of killers.
---
PAY ATTENTION TO THEIR RED LIGHT!!! This is what gives you the best information about killer's location. They CAN use it against you and walk backwards/ trick you, but if you keep a keen eye you learn it.
---
Best skill to get good at is turning your camera to look at killer in the middle of a chase. Usually it's easiest to move diagonally (like A + W) around loops and angle your camera so you can see the killer.
---
DON'T WASTE PALLETS! If you're gonna get hit from being healthy and you're at a pallet, DON'T DROP IT! Run straight away with the speed boost you get to another pallet. Killers get a 2 for 1 deal when you drop the pallet when they injure you.
---
If you run straight at windows with some run up distance, you perform a "fast vault" that gets you over the window much quicker and lingers your hitbox a lot less. If you fail it you see your feet touch the window cill.
---
Stringing pallets and windows together is the most useful combo.
---
If you want a video on how to run some loops, here's one from killer's perspective: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ
---
I'm telling you all this cause I wish all my teammates knew this stuff
---
Good job! Long chainsaw snipes are the best with hillbilly 
---
I wonder how he'd get around the map because I personally feel like if they have him turn into bat form it would be broken as he'd get to anywhere around the map.
---
his perks would be interesting though
---
Probably using (a) Face Rig: https://store.steampowered.com/app/274920/FaceRig/
---
&gt;absolutely ruin some peoples days
---
i mean he was doing it every time he played this game
---
It didn't stop him because he knew he couldn't get banned on ps4. Now that he can, it can detour him. Also through devs will still ban him if he does the l i thing. They will just find one of his friends in the game, go to their friends, find his name, and ban him.
---
Controlling Billy's (and Bubba's) chainsaws with a joystick is quite hard, so I don't even bother trying. I just stick to my Spirit and, sometimes, my Hag.
---
lol the survivors did not do this 
---
Felt so satisfying! I just knew that Nea was gonna pop up there :P
---
Did he get banned again?
---
OP said he only knocked them down 
---
I gave him my first born 
---
What’s the prestige glitch? 
---
When you escaped 1 out of 10 at red rank, you can be a crybaby.
---
Don't worry about it, good luck in the fog
---
Michael, Pig, or Spirit. Michael is a shit ton of fun, Pig is amazing and Spirit is one of the best killers. Clown isn’t that fun imo but his perks are good so get him if you want his perks. Freddy is actually a lot of fun when you’re not getting bullied, but I may be biased because he’s my main. 
---
Except legion is a couple of teens and clown is a chunky 40 something year old 
---
show me your ways.
---
That was quick
---
You need map knowledge for Billy's sprint but you need accuracy too. But getting a snipe always feels good
---
It’s gonna make me get reported for “lagswitching” genius. 
---
What's the prestige glitch? 
---
yep, has been posted a few times already
---
Nah I think he is in his 60s
---
I’ve seen a few point it out, feels like a huge slap in the face that they don’t care until there’s an exploit
---
I was just taking a guess 
---
What's your gamer tag I need to report you
---
Ochido is gone &lt;3
---
Yea bro, 5 seconds after I down someone magically my game crashes twice in 2 separate occasions 
---
Finally on ps4
---
ha, right 🙄
---
I haven't streamed in months, lol. I wish I could get the clipped without the cringy voice over. And you're thinking if charisma.
---
Nah
---
I just watched Ochido get banned on PS4 for “Griefing: Intentional Gameplay abuse” on his twitch stream. 
---
What's the point in doing this if you p3 max out every survivor then wheres the fun at that point 
---
Congrats!
---
Last game I played killer, 3 survivors were dead, 1 gen was left, and I hooked the 4th survivor. I was looking for the 5th guy and I got this weird feeling that he wasn’t trying to do the gen, but was waiting for his teammate to die so he could run into the hatch. So I remembered where the hatch was, searched the locker in front of it and what’d yknow, he’d been hiding in there for a solid 3 minutes and let his teammates die. That’s the kind of player I make sure never gets into the hatch 
---
finally some good news
---
Lol dude just because you heard something on tv once and thought it sounded cool doesn’t make it a good point. Also I don’t have to flip your words on you you make yourself sound plenty pathetic. You want something original? Not commenting the same thing on any post that talks about survivors in a negative light. Get a life dude, you aren’t living rent free in my head, you’re living sadly in your parents basement
---
I used to run Empathy instead as well, but no more.
---
I don’t watch that guy. Why is he unliked? 
---
Oh man you were too fast for me. And it's hilarious !
---
I'll upload a bit and link it shortly
---
Just watched him get banned for griefing.
---
10/10 
---
I never encountered him on ps4 thank god. 
---
I want to watch good players and to be fair, most streamers suck at the game and I can't watch as a result. True may not be the best, but he is definitely good enough to watch and not get turned off by noob plays. I watch Marth, Hexxy, Jen and True...they all play fairly well enough for me to watch and enjoy them. I have also been watching True for over 5 years, long before DBD ever existed as well. He impressed me with his fighting game skills initially.
---
What do you mean what did he do? He got permabanned on PC and tried to avoid that ban by going to console. They finnaly added a ban system on console and now they took him down for his shitty behaviour on PC.
---
I second this. DS lets you break free and for some reason gives you a ridiculous amount of points towards the [altruism medal](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems) (30/100 for iridescent). This is a huge boost that lets you pip/not depip when you don't deserve it, and it's probably why you see a bunch of DS survivors who are potatoes in the mid ranks.
---
No dribbling is fair just get far enough from a hook 
---
"Was that gunshots?! Respond immediately!"
---
"Sorry, that's my farts. Shouldn't have went to that new Mexican place"
---
It's legit one of the excuses you can give on the radio in P2.
---
Good riddance 
---
How do people know cus I am trying to find where this was put out
---
Think you forgot the /s
---
Now people on his discord are crying. Good riddance ochido!
---
He did? Where did you hear this I’m just Curious 
---
Some games do it because only some games are good. If it's only the grind system that keeps you there, the game itself is boring.
---
u/DishonestAmoeba
---
Please dont advise non veteran players to not run selfcare lmao. Personally even for vets I dont like it when they dont run it. If you dont wanna heal thats perfectly fine, but 90% does and they waste enough time looking for a teammate or running towards them and have them stop doing gens to heal you up. That aside, people who dont rank up more often also get paired with others who dont rank up. Forcing people to rely on other potentially non skilled people gets you killed and loses you and your team games.
---
They disconnected i think, it's a new bug, sometimes appear the cable icon, sometimes not
---
You actually stole my cat wtf
---
I smacked a Kate who was like 3 meters from a window. 
---
I gave her the hatch because I felt bad 
---
I already walk up to a croutching pig 
---
Killer Rank 1- You earned my respecc
---
Survivor Rank 1 - Actually not that hard, I mean, I'm a Rank 1 Survivor so....
---
The fun is in playing the game to have fun or doing something that is an actual challenge, it's not fun just tedious.
---
Don't mistake this for saying I reckon that we should be taking advantage of this, I just think that they have things they should focus on, like making it so that we can play a game that works better so that we can actually enjoy it.
---
Oh no console bans ARE REAL
---
1k hours without playing Billy? Are you crazy?
---
Wrong it was griefing.
---
lol...
---
I mean Oh no, poor fella.
---
no he did all of that
---
Saw it in his twitch clips
---
Freddy after he hooks someone. It's amusing being able to whack them as many times as I want on the hook, but when they get off of it, I have to put them to sleep before I can do it again.
---
His twitch 
---
Every killer should be rank 1 viable. Being rank 1 viable and being fun aren't mutually exclusive terms.
---
When you play do you ever wish you had self-care ?
---
Maybe two days bro I'm doing it still fuck devs 
---
Is DC’ing bannable? 
---
Step 1 - Care less about what idiots think of you.
---
Step 2 - Live better life.
---
I really don't see hitting survs on the hook as being toxic. It only shows that the killer was super pissed off with you, so you did your job, but if you get tbagged, the survs are telling you how much you suck at the game. Hitting survs on the hook isn't the same as tbagging, in my opinion
---
Hate to be the guy but can't he just make another account? From what I remember PlayStation had a thing there if a single account on the console had online then every other account also gets it. They can also share games within the same console. On top of accounts being easy to make. 
---
Did he just use a top tier though, cause I'm not impressed if so.
---
If you need your BBQ stack go find the survivor. It usually isn’t that difficult.
---
Don't get caught by the killer. Get better at getting away from the killer.
---
I stopped letting people go when I carried a survivor to the hatch and they flamed me for "tunneling" them.
---
Oh. I just thought he did something AGAIN to draw the attention of the devs. K.
---
Literally every game I join I get heartbeat within like a minute
---
OwO killer when? 
---
How about not running hex perks that you think you will keep for a long time? That seems like an even better plan :)
---
Seriously? It has everything to do with the prestige glitch. Bans are “now on console” after all.
---
Devs **could have always banned individuals** on ps4/Xbox, they just don’t want to bother creating a system for banning or they cheap out.
---
**He’s and individual that is easy to find because his tag is available,** and they hate him.
---
Also a great chance to show off “the new ban system”
---
Devs don’t have currently a system put in place to detect prestige glitchers,  so they’re doing this 2 birds in one stone thing.
---
As in like a “Look, we banned someone - see?”
---
Letting the survivor escape is pretty bad.
---
Thanks!
---
LOL YUP I WAS RIGHT HE PLAYED LIKE ONE GAME OF TRAPPER AND OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS BILLY/NURSE/HUNTY.
---
Super unimpressed.
---
whet es des dud, what eye done?? 
---
&gt;Tru3Ta1ent did the same challenge and it took him many days to do that.
---
You are leaving out an important piece of information. He also did survivor at the same time, switching between survivor and killer every game. It should take at least twice as long....
---
&gt;  unless it's blatantly obvious like having an obscene amount of the same one
---
Or they leveled only one killer during the double BP + present boxes, I had like 30 tombstones pieces on Myers and I gave him maybe 20% of my total BPs, there are people with over 100 ebony moris 
---
I still get eternally trapped in the basement when rescuing someone. When you try to leave the stairs you teleport back to the bottom, perfectly placed for the killer.
---
Well Julie *is* the superior legion member, are you good enough to hold that title?
---
Spies is more precise than whispers as it gives an exact location. At least in my opinion
---
They're probably focusing on consoles because Console Bans are new.
---
*Hella **WOKE***
---
Is he really a pedo?
---
The Enkitty
---
AND HE WON'T COME BACK!
---
I have no idea at all. I don't understand the meta as to what the expected behavior is. People seem to looooooove getting mad though, and boy is it funny. That's all I know. 
---
this... This makes me happy.
---
Cool, now do Jen and her derankers circlejerk team
---
"This is fucking illegal dude, they're banning me without a reason"
---
lul
---
I don't know about the fame thingy, but you get a bit of my internet love &lt;3
---
fUCK YEAH CHUCXTJGZHJ
---
What exactly did he do on PC worthy of a ban? All I’ve ever seen him do is annoy killers with a flashlight and use annoying perks.
---
Don’t know anything about him, but anyone who intentionally ruins other people’s games is a fucking loser
---
Not sure if it was hallowed blight or before that (I think it was before maybe?) but you used an older version of the game to authenticate which then deranked you, then you'd load up the regular version and play against rank 20s and just demolish them and talk about how badly they were playing. I followed you pretty heavily up until then but that wasn't cool - not only did you abuse an exploit to derank, you were mean to the newbies you were smurfing against. Someone actually posted the clip on this sub when you did it, I'm trying to find it.
---
His twitch chat telling him he could sue the devs is hilarious LMAO
---
[Vine referenced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7merzCPl-Xg)
---
Noob3 got banned for hacking. He has nothing to do worry about seeing ho it seems he learned his lesson. 
---
They got kicked from the game, just another bug
---
Perhaps
---
Leaving early as in escaping or dc? Cuz dc is bannable escaping is not.
---
Ohhh got it, thanks ^^
---
Excellent usage of the bans so far, ty BHVR
---
Good riddance. He was a terrible part of the community, hope to never see that pedo make any content again.
---
Git gud
---
He got banned on ps4 too ?

They literally just banned ochido for the third time and many others have been banned.
---
If multitudes people are randomly calling you a pedo  you done fucked up somehow. Even if he's not, he comes across as the kind of person I'd still insult with it.
---
&gt; and hes a pedo
---
If you're going to make claims like that, back it with evidence. Falsely accusing people of this because you don't like them is a dick move, no matter how much of a douche bag they are.
---
This is inventive
---
I still appreciate the input my friend! 
---
Lmao daddy Matthieu ain’t gonna do shit 
---
Dont come to reddit crying when you get banned because you exploited a bug
---
Cheated progress and shared exploits on stream/youtube. 
---
People can be happy without telling complete strangers something they've already seen countless times
---
The issue is a common tactic is to cut your connection to dc. There's no way to tell. Also one argument is that if you choose to play with a connection that will likely fail you are not really a good teammate. Harsh but kind of true.
---
Me too! Amazing idea
---
Totems are already easy enough to find... and already very fast to cleanse
---
It may take a day or two but fingers crossed no issues for those who have tried it 
---
If Ochido gets upset over this, no worries, we can just attach the video of him getting upset at this to some goofy music and add some *sooper wacky greenscreen maymays* over it and people will just laugh and laugh...
---
*ULTRA THICC*
---
No boring ass hide and seek gameplay - Wraith
---
I'm not sick of your shit, just a little tired of it. 
---
Be a pussy. Run urban on claudette and you won’t get found first. Actually, please don’t play like this 
---
They make exceptions. I'm talking like noob3 (they stated he wouldn't be banned again) or Monto
---
It’s great against survivors that like to tap gens. Which they try to a lot when I uncloak as wraith during a chase
---
Who?
---
Eh urban is alright
---
Distressing is just for builds that have abilities or perks that inflict some kind of debuff to survivors within terror radious, like Doc or Unnerving Presence. In Hag it's not worth it. Thrill of the Hunt could be useful if you're running Ruin to protect the totem. But overall BBQ is the only perk that adda BP that is worth it. You're a Hag, survivors triggering your traps will already bath you on BP. Run Ruin, BBQ, TotH and any perk you want.
---
This got turned into a hate thread pretty fast.
---
Survivor main lol
---
I love that this sub, despite all the arguments, can rally around the fact that we all hate Och*do
---
did he really say something that dumb?  they can can for whatever reason they want.  maybe not if for like legit anti-discrimination reasons or something but overall
---
Heh. Time to get better at the game, my friend.
---
Rank is weird in DBD. Everybody resets to 10-15 every month, it's easier to pip than it is to depip, and it's not zero-sum - if a game is close EVERYONE will rank up instead of ranks barely changing at all. As far as a ranking system for determining skill level goes, it fails in almost every way imaginable. Instead, it's a monthly playtime badge. If you're better, you'll climb slightly faster. But if you're bad, you'll still climb. Monthly playtime does correlate with skill (vets who've stuck with the game and play regularly and rank up easily), but it also correlates with being an excited new player in the honeymoon phase who's just playing a lot. Great system to put those two groups together, huh?
---
I stopped playing when they broke sounds and came back now that they're fixed - that's two monthly rank resets. I went from around rank 5 to around rank 15. And we just had a free weekend/sale too, right? I mean, I'm no Zubat, but I'm over a hundred hours now. I shouldn't be playing against the babies making it to rank 15 for the first time, but there I am. I decided to use it as a chance to learn billy and spirit (huntress main for life). Turns out billy and spirit are really good, not too hard to get the hang of, and now I feel like an asshole. Oops.
---
fuck na
---
Ochido was the best youtuber cuz his content was funny you guys are just ass at the game and get upset over everything.
---
It still would require distortion and a stack though. The point is now you need to figure it out instead of just getting told.
---
What's the song of this funky song?
---
Might be some glitch with Tinkerer, Hag's Granma's Heart add on which also set the terror radius to 0 had a glitch recently that made it permanently apply when it triggered. 
---
Boy, do we ever.
---
Hah, I am sorry. I replied to you instead of the person who made the initial comment.
---
Know how you feel, spirit is fun to play, I wish I liked hillbily but I hate him.
---
Seeing how disorientated and confused survivors get with bodyblocking Hag is really fun
---
so cute!!
---
He used exploits to create "hostage" situations and showed them off in a big way on his "funny random moments" videos e.g. like jumping on a object with is unreachable for the killer and sitting there to make fun of them. That would be first thing which comes into my mind.   
---
This is EXACTLY what I think too. Make a high profile player an example (not even for the same thing) to scare other people off of exploiting. 
---
Wow, actually a good dbd meme
---
Always wondered why that increased reload speed
---
YARRR REDDITZ UNITE!!!!! Dude didn't do anything on PS4 to deserve the ban (as far as I know) and this sets a pretty dangerous precedent. 
---
Legion because I hate looping so with legion I can say fuck your stupid loops
---
this is the easter egg that unlocks the new killer early like on old wc3 dota maps
---
Probably bad internet 
---
oh god oh fuck
---
He was probably just a little upset, I think he knows deep down stuff caught up to him. He did say this in his stream. He just finished dying in one round then the banned message came up after he left the end-game lobby lol.
---
It's important to consider the fact that Ochi is total dipshit and will without a doubt fuck up again.
---
Which add-on is that? I don't think i've ever used it
---
Agreed. The L2 and R2 triggers are so damn sensitive. I always end up fast forwarding in Netflix for the same reason 
---
Simple
---
Don’t. Get.Seen
---
ah ok
---
It that a joke?
---
Using the dream transition flickering to my advantage is fun; survivors don't know where I am before it finishes if I play it right. Watching people crouch behind something while I'm staring right at them is also hilarious. 
---
This isn’t gatekeeping, but you realize 100 hours is actually a very short time right? When I had 100 hours I was still crouching around the map the entire game. 
---
Everytime I get an itch, im doing a gen 
---
And everytime I actually itch the itch, the skill check appears 
---
Accounting for time, it still took tru3 ~77 games to get from 10-1. It took Zubat around 45 to get from **20**-1. Those numbers dont lie man.
---
If you got his steam profile and ID, you can quite easily getting him banned for taking the game hostage by sending this video, and the details mentioned earlier, to Behavior's customer support.
---
What’s more priceless is the spirit’s face at that exact moment
---
This thread just further cements that I hate streamers and the people that idolize them moreso
---
:(
---
Really? Like seriously?
---
Thank fucking Jesus 
---
They can ban for whatever reason they want, doesn't mean they're just allowed to though.
---
I imagine it would be a fairly easy win in small claims court if they banned you without reason.
---
You forgot the part where you spawn in with the other survivors and the killer turns the corner and hits you 3 seconds into the match.
---
I love being constantly invisible. It make flashlight saves damn near impossible and bodyblocking useless. Also because I love Freddy as a character and his story is very interesting. 
---
Furryinahurry I know that guy! He streams on Twitch!!

https://youtu.be/TNNAhcAqi8M For all your exploit ending needs. 
---
Like you can tell the general age group of this game when people are always going off about how their fave streamer is one of the best at the game (a game with no real ranking system/gameplay to determine where they stand vs other people in the same roles)
---
Ban evasion is a bannable offense in most cases is it not?
---
Normal play because I'm a salty cunt whenever I play survivor lmao 
---
That logic is fucking stupid.
---
Removed - Respost
---
Oh I know.  Bloodweb 1 was insane. Bloodweb 2 was when I did my characters. Bloodweb 3 is just impossible.
---
According to BHVR disconnecting is a bannable offense, she and her team disconnected on purpose multiple times on stream, how is that not ban worthy?
---
What does playing survivor have to do with anything? If anything that just means it took even longer (over 8 days) to get to red ranks which counters your other point of "he was only facing the best fast rankers." Just trying to understand your point. Have a good one.

Nope. Dribbling is a fair counter to DS and this would just make DS even better. You already can only be dribbled a certain number of times before you get off the killers shoulder.

The real reason we have console banning

---
That happened to me when we got the gates opened and I was so shocked that I got grabbed. One of the best games I've ever played
---
I like Freddy and his style but I hate how underpowered he is.
---
Ugh, don't let it bother you too much. I'm similar where i try to be easy going when playing killer. If something happens where I play bad or they got shit on, or they played super well I'll let the last person or the last few people go but the last few times, its always someone who is super toxic for no reason :/
---
 I get that they don't always trust me but I seriously don't care enough about killing you to stay in the same game for 20 minutes watching you jump back n forth windows lol.
---
It really demotivates me from being nice because if people are just gonna be shitty about it anyway why bother.
---
That has to be the stupidest thing I've read today lol
---
I never get this logic. So the guy who literally plays the game for a living is gonna be worse than a random guy who has a 9-5 and comes home to play a few hours???
---
yea hating someone just becouse he is not prestiging his characters is just dumb
---
im sorry are you not for ruining people's lives and careers via witchunting by calling people pedos cause you don't like them?
---
what are you fuckin' gay?
---
Nea
---
I don't think devs really care about ban evasion and they'll probably use it as an excuse. In reality, he got banned because all of the salty Rank 1 killers did not like losing. Like always they go and cry to the devs and make them do something about it, so there we go. I can bet my two cents if I got banned on PC and moved to PS4, the devs would not care at all because Reddit does not want me banned.
---
I’ve played against tunnelmeplz a handful of times, you bet your ass I tunnel hard against them.
---
&gt;Hes a huge cunt, **borderline pedophile**
---
I have not heard that before... Can you elaborate?
---
Is there any way for him to get around it on console? Like with new accounts or something?
---
Trappy boi, + respect
---
I'm sort of with you. I don't hate streamers, I'm sure some of them are cool people and I watch a couple myself. But I absolutely hate the communities they spawn as well. People get into fucking flame wars over who is better, worse, more annoying, whatever, and it's like... you're watching someone play a video game. Is that really something you want to build your identity around? 
---
The fact that he reacted in an annoyed manner to the ban made me laugh. Like, "Damn it, I got banned again. Time to buy an XBOX!"
---
If you do it over 50% of all your games, yes.
---
that's epic 
---
Haha?
---
Killers with no perks/addons are usually called Naked killers.
---
No.

wow and you're only lvl 20
---
Don't worry, his rank 20 sheep will send gameplay video's he can voice over with his stick up his ass voice.
---
Did you read the words you wrote
---
Thanks, I did just that. Saved the link of his profile and provided the requested ID64 (w/e that is) in the customer support form.
---
I remember someone in the community made a video exposing him for all his unsavory actions and one of them was that he would ask for nudes from under ages girls.
---
I always be scary to find him and play against him on PS4 
---
Hide for the first 30s of evert game. Dont go straight to a gen.
---
What a douche
---
I come across better survivors in PS4 than he does on PC. It's not even a debate. How come no one even tries to do 360s against him? 1 in 3 survivors does it on PS4. 
---
The same could be said for Legion, They can avoid windows and pallets like Nurse, has an after power use stun like Nurse, and unlike Nurse has to respect walls, frenzy isn’t even lethal and Nurse can easily blink into range for M1s
---
What can I say. Skill ;)
---
lol getting downvoted for pointing out what he was literally banned for on PS4. Here's a updoot
---
Nos this is epic
---
He was specifically banned on PS4 for griefing.
---
I love playing Spirit and Huntress ❤️
---
Not really. Mostly because it’s a paid game
---
Yes that's why I said "accused". :)
---
And to think that this event only has two vessels by default. It's gonna be rough
---
I didn't? I specifically even only mentioned it was his fans and didn't say a thing about Zubat.
---
I mean, yea I'm not a fan of yours, Jen, or Zubat or the other people in your group but I at least try to be fair about it.
---
Just to be clear
---
https://youtu.be/Pi_iiPppFlc
---
I run Self-care when solo-queue because even if I ran bond my team mates are often derpy and wont stop hiding behind logs to farm people off the hook.  Which means not only are they too immersed to heal me, but they also aren't getting gens done so Adrenaline will never proc for me.
---
SWF with at least 2 friends I run Adrenaline, because they will actually heal me...  with out failing skillchecks and not while in nurses calling range which makes it infinitely better then the derpy soloqueue people realize that I'm tbagging next to them while injured for a reason.   That and the gens almost always get powered which means Adrenaline will likely actually work.
---
So for your poll.. it depends on the situation.
---
"[killer] is too op plz nerf", "Ochido makes me angry plz ban". Seriously we can't even have a little fun watching his streams when people whine all the time.

“yep, never lag switch against a streamer lol” this part upset me the most

He's a pedophile and just very toxic and unfunny on general

Nice👌
---
Now you know what's in the clowns bottle next time you get hit by it....
---
OREWAAAAA
---
OCHINCHIN OCHIDOISGONE NANDAIYOO
---
Anyone wanna fill me in?
---
The number used to be 40% and they changed it, it's probably lower than that.
---
Some days the game just hates you. Ive had days like it to 
---
it is. it's in their policy.
---
Lmfaoo
---
That comeback wouldn't have been sassy or clever, even if you hadn't failed at reading-comprehension.
---
But all he does is legal
---
Yeah, my bad. 
---
For people who don't know who this guy is or don't know much about him, here's a guide to the DUD haHAA I'm so funny guy named Ochido.
---
He was banned twice on PC and now once on PS4 for a multitude of reasons.
---
1. Exploiting the game to give himself items without farming them out. He gave himself Prestige Level 3 items on Clown while only being Devotion Level 6. (Not 106 where you reach level 100 and it goes back to 1, literally level 6.) Bannable Offense.
---
2. Exploiting the game so that killers couldn't reach him and exploiting the game so that killers were trapped above him and couldn't get out, forcing them to DC to end the game.  Bannable Offense.
---
3. Ban Evasion on PC and PS4. Ban evasion is when you get another account after you are banned to play the game again. He did this after his first ban on PC to play on PC again, and again on PS4 after his second ban on PC. Bannable Offense.
---
4. He is a Pedophile. He asked multiple underage girls for nudes and tried to get Jendenise to get rid of her boyfriend ScottJund to be with him. There is a video of this by Ardetha that goes into more detail. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBKEa3R1ru0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBKEa3R1ru0) Shitty Behavior.
---
5. He gets his Twitch Audience to Witch Hunt people. This is just fucked up as his following of twelve-year-olds go to a person's account and leave hateful messages on steam. Shitty Behavior.
---
6. Generally just toxic in the game. This is a dividing opinion by some as to whats toxic in the game. Running annoying perks to go against, in my opinion, isn't toxic, but BMing killers and talking shit is. Shitty Behavior.
---
7. His Youtube consists of HIGH-QUALITY FUNNY CONTENT (To a Twelve-Year-Old). This content is literally just videos of survivors and killers doing mediocre stuff with ear-rape soundboards put onto them. It's just the same stuff over and over and runs its course after the first 2 videos. 
---
So basically what we have here is a shitty person with a shitty following finally getting whats due again. Hopefully, he's finally going to stop being in this community and we can enjoy the wake of his absence.
---
This is his third ban, most likely what he was banned for is ban evading. Even if you switch from PC to PS4 it is still BAN-EVADING.  
---
Here is a video by Generator Jake, made about a year ago about the first two bans on PC (Exploiting and Witch Hunting)
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6zwCTJDLK8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6zwCTJDLK8)
---
Heres another video made by TrueTalent about Ochido putting him in his video without permission and TrueTalent wishes to be removed from the video. (Ochido did remove True from the video later but after deleting True's comment from the video.)
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZFsGgiSaes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZFsGgiSaes)
---
Ardetha's video also discusses the Clown Exploit he did.
---
"I showed you my hatchet why won't you respond"
---
Jack sounds like a serial killer.
---
Oh, don't get me wrong, I'm in the "hey! I did a cool thing, maybe I'm not complete garbage at this!" phase everytime I successfully mindgame someone. But back when I started playing I hit rank 15 my first weekend with the game. It only took a couple hours over one or two play sessions. A hundred hours vs "I bought the game yesterday" is still a huge skill gap, not because I'm a god, but because they're really, really "run to the actual literal corner of the map to heal eachother while your friend dies on hook" new. Even aside from the sheer experience gap, I've got like five different killers with all the meta perks unlocked. They probably haven't even finished levelling one character.
---
Pretty much everything. He is toxic, annoying, rude, selfish and pedo.
---
The non-streamers were fine. It's pretty rare that I have anyone complain about my connection, especially during American hours.
---
Fair enough. 
---
Ofc not that is your play style. But try out using range and decreased skill check chances add-ons (Nancy's master piece and Green Dress) and put all survivors to sleep and then start chasing.
---
I need an infinite loop of this. 
---
Yeah i started with one of those cheap playboy-esche bunny masks that girls wear for halloween so i tried my best 😅😂
---
I know theres plenty of reason to hate this guy. But reddit, once again, doesn't realize the huge favor they're doing for him by constantly talking about him. He'll get a new account and have more fans from all the posts that are talking about him.
---
If you really want to do him no favors, pretend like he doesn't exist. His whole livelihood revolves around popularity, no matter what kind.
---
Oh yeah that's actually a good idea. Thanks!
---
me too lol
---
Probably. In which case the devs will cry out, "Oh no! How will we ever track down the new account of this person who uploads videos of everything they do?"
---
Hah, he actually said "this is fucking illegal". Because you agreeing to terms when you play a game somehow makes a ban "illegal".
---
Shame BHVR can't ban for stupidity, he would have been gone ages ago.
---
Not real sure, could set your own ones? Like doing the adept achievements or playing with no perks. Getting to rank one for both killer and survivor. Play with a different play still, like no sleep Freddy. Or Stalking Myers where you don't kill and only stalk. Give it whatever goal you want is what I'm saying.
---
she carries the bigger one to hit people and then the smaller ones to throw. 
---
Or tier one is the only tier they unlocked? Trying to tier up 50+ perks 3 times on one character isn't easy my guy
---
I don't stress about players taunting. Chances are if they have to take the hatch and the gates are not powered I won the match regardless of a whether or not I find them before they find the hatch.
---
If the gates are powered and they are trying for the hatch who won the match is mostly up to your view of "winning".
---
Yea some games you get crushed and being taunted can be triggering, but if that's the outcome you probably messed up somewhere or the survivors just played really well. Best thing you can do is learn from your mistakes and move on.
---
Okay that makes sense but being annoying, toxic, and selfish isn’t bannable? Atleast it shouldn’t be. Just because we hate somebody doesn’t mean we should be able to get him banned. 
---
Damn, his funny moments videos are genuinely hilarious 
---
Unfortunately I couldn't go up there...
---
Ochido got banned on PC, evaded his ban by going on console because there was no ban on console. Now there are bans, and he got banned there too since he's completly banned from the game.
---
Your play-pretend dress up outfit is very nice.
---
Personally, I'd just use the Mori on death-hook. You get more bloodpoints that way and I think it doesn't feel bad when a survivor gets mori'd in that particular context.
---
Such a cool animation.
---
Huntress, even tho i play on ps4 and can't aim for shit, she's my big russian mama and it's very satisfying when you do hit, especially when people are dumb enough to t-bag on the other side of a pallet, like do you think i won't throw an axe at you??
---
There are only a handful of achievements that are actually challenging to get. The majority are pretty easy or are literally just grinding, which could just be accomplished in a few farming matches.
---
Oh not at all.  If/when you guys do something shady yea I'll probably be there on full blast. But it just made me roll my eyes to see a thread supposedly celebrating something Zubat did and the raging sentiment at the time I commented was "LUL FUCK TRU3" instead of
---
talking about Zubat or his accomplishment.
---
But anyway, I've rambled too much on this. Take it easy.
---
Being pedo is tho. He was also escaping his ban on PC by changing game files which is banable action.
---
That's some damn accurate cosplay. Good going.
---
I mean, this is the internet. There's been a lot of times I've thought someone was being hilariously sarcastic when they've been completely serious.
---
Ochido is a content creator who's content is effectively being an asshole, and who also has a lot of other questionable things about him. He's been banned on PC for abusing exploits in the prestige/bp system, and pretty much as soon as they announced people could be banned on console he got banned on console.
---
What if we DC through the close application button on PS4? Does that count? 
---
The depth and complexity of Pig’s mechanics and the many ways that they can all be utilized to bend the rules of the game are incredibly satisfying.  Makes me feel like a big-brain smart-boy when I shatter the survivors’ will and watch them scamper around helplessly, too scared to approach a box yet unable to touch a gen without damning themselves and their team.  The most recent buff has made me love her even more, as she can finally stand up without the aid of her crutches.
---
HOT..  HOT HOT HOT!!!
---
Yes and the issue is that killers can dc whenever they want to deny us that. So if a killer doesn’t like the way the game is going, they’ll just dc. 
---
Yeah, but I feel as though if people are closer they’ll be more careful and won’t trigger any birds. So I think for closer more broad info whispers is good and spies provide a more distant precise location. Both are good and I feel like they both provide a different side to the same coin
---
Thank you! 😄 it’s my first time i tried my best 
---
I don't think that makes him a pedophile, just poor taste in jokes and immaturity thinking that's ok to do. 
---
so... are you dating?
---
Yeah that tends to happen when tru3 talks shit about Zubat on Twitter without Zubat saying so much as a word to tru3 in his entire life - people want to defend him, just like they want to defend tru3. Its mostly fanbases defending each other but yeah they usually go about it in the wrong way.
---
My overall point is that it's not an apples to apples comparison.
---
One reason is tru3 started at reset and finished sooner than Zubat, which means lower ranks had better survivors mixed in for tru3 before they had already grinded red ranks themselves. As the days go by after reset more and more people get to red ranks just by grinding, so finishing just a few days after tru3 is on average against lower quality red rank survivors. The important part is that he started earlier and finished sooner, which means survivors were on average more difficult at every rank, which means he was pipping less often which means it took longer in terms of killer hours vs killer hours.
---
Another reason it's not apples to apples to compare "X days to 10 hours" is because half of that time wasn't even playing killer and he only plays like 6 hours a day. This is only to point out that "many days" is not really a good characterization of how long it took him to do the killer challenge side of it. This doesn't "counter" my point because, to reiterate, even with survivor+killer challenge combined he started and finished before Zubat started so the survivors were still better on average.
---
Another reason it's not apples to apples is because he rotated killers for the majority of the time.
---
I did put some effort into that reply in good faith, so maybe you can do me a solid back.
---
Do you know of a timestamp of that VOD where Zubat was playing against good survivors? I haven't seen him play much at all, but the 5 or so games I've watched of his have been against not-great players. I'd really like to see what he does under pressure from quick gens. 
---
Play the tutorial and get back to me. 
---
One of the most toxic DBD players
---
I think he was exposed for messaging understand girls, asking them for nudes. Ardetha did a video about it a few months back on YT. 
---
The Game, Lerys, the swamp maps. And it would encourage people to take it instead of the meta perks.
---
I don't get this whole good killer/bad killer thing and all those unspoken rules, I use noed, I tunnel people when I see that that there's 2 gens left and I barely got a hook, I use the basement every chance I get and hell sometimes I even camp especially if I have 2 people down in the basement. Why should I handicap myself? So I can see them t-bagging at the exit and prolonging the game for shits and giggles?
---
This has been going on much before the latest patch
---
Had this the other day. Take a cool down period for a bit and once you are calm. Just start your matches off slow, think marathon not race. 
---
I had to create a character that spends thousands of hours just playing nurse and tryharding to win for no benefit, not trying to make it a stream or anything like it. Just the desire to dominate people. _Of course_ that would be an absolute unstable psycho. 
---
By the way, best of luck with your sleeping problems. :/ I barely can stand it when I am on 6hrs sleep a few days in a row.
---
I watched the whole thing and didn't hear any pedo mentions? 
---
360s are legit when my cat does this... cat I caaaant see them
---
All I want is for a little notification to pop up when the last gen is completed that tells me I've got exposed other than that I down care at all 
---
Not only is he the most toxic man-child of DBD, he also sexually harrassed about 75 female DBD players, hacked his game file, got banned for doing so, made a new account, did the same thing and got banned again. He then created a PS4 account and finally got banned there as well. 
---
Jesus, what’s to stop him from making another account to step around the ban?
---
i know what pedantic means, a great example is starting with you
---
Yep he was. You'll figure it out when you get targeted by a large group of angry people.
---
**Don't** report DCs. You're just clogging the system. DCs don't require reports, the game tracks the automatically.
---
I much prefer the not knowing. 
---
Lose my shit when I see Myers staring at me on EW1. 
---
Ye fuck you karen
---
Because playing against legion generally sucks. He didn't dc but he still had to play against legion. 
---
What was No0b3 banned for, if I may ask? I follow his channel on youtube and never noticed he was banned before.
---
5 times isn't even a drop in the bucket. The DC threshold is 40%.
---
It should be imo, but that requires cooperation which I don't think is there. If you noticed in the comments of that one video getting posted around, there are very few people calling out Ochido's actions personally. It's always someone speaking on behalf of someone else, so either nothing is actually happening or no one just wants to deal with the whole thing. Pair this with the fact that evidently his fans aren't the nicest bunch, so someone without a large steam or Youtube social link would have a hard time getting anyone to listen to them. Apathy is pretty strong (and not to make it really weird, but some kids might not even care or know the implications of what is happening to them).
---
His accounts will always be banned if he plays on stream, off stream however, he is still able to play the game, unfortunately, but maybe he is gone for good.
---
Look at his username 
---
What did he say? 
---
Are you saying Tru3ta1ent is False? Kappa
---
If only they took away the prestige that you exploited so it took you back to normal.
---
Beautiful. Got what he deserved.
---
Of course he ain’t remember his buddy got a shotgun to the head? He wallowing :,(
---
There is evidence, its on this sub somewhere, was posted quite a while ago tho. 
---
That why most games have an EULA that states that you are leasing the software from them and don’t own anything. If you get mad that they cut your access they’re legally covered. 
---
Of course they couldn't, BP is stored locally. They have no means of tracking it.
---
He's made videos explaining why he was banned on both his accounts. Pretty sure he's first account got banned for hacking legacy but not quite sure on the second one.. And I don't think he explained why he got banned on his second one in his video. May aswell go ask him on his stream right now. 
---
Ladies and gentlemen....We got him.
---
I dunno, but I’d rather have bots on my team than most of the random team mates I get tbh. 
---
I think it's interesting how a lot of people  hate him now. Back in the day it seemed like a majority of players defended him while there were some who spoke out against him
---
LMFAO the pallet pushing you to the next floor after he wasted all that time trying to heal you... *y tho*
---
I want to insult you but its against the rules so have a swell day.
---
Gross.
---
If it's not hard to get to rank 1, why does anyone give a shit that Zubat did it?
---
So? They need video to prove lagswitching and if you're not switching they'll have no video. Lag and lagswitching look very different.
---
I had the same problem and solved it by resetting my GameUserSettings and Engine files, so I think removing the fps lock causes it.
---
*Press X to pay respects*
---
Very questionable thing to "be a smartass" about.
---
Love you too
---
thanks for sharing?
---
Clown town for me :D
---
I think he was trying to continue healing, but accidentally pushed the pallet down instead which makes everything even funnier 😂 
---
Nea just looking at the camera like 'do you believe this shit' lol.
---
I only got to play against him once though 
---

---
Yep
---
If I see 4 BPS's I'm letting everyone walk out the door. 5K for escaping quintupled up to 25K is as much as I'll make off BBQ alone in a close game. That survivor grind is some real rough shit.
---
Terrible idea, that would render hex totems completely useless. The point is that you have to actually look and spend time getting totems.  You can easily gen rush if people were half way decent at chases and actually touch gens instead of being immersed all the time. 
---
More or less the same, welcome back?
---
Got a VOD link? I need a good laugh. :D
---
Who is Ochido?
---
Well things have come out about how he is with his female veiwers including underage female veiwers so alot people hate him for that too
---
It depends how the killer DCs. If he pulls plug you get nothing, if he quits the game to menu it counts as an escape and you keep items.
---
Happy cake day
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
i had the problem at the shack ( still got the meg after she abused it ) 
---
btw bamboozle is op with this bug xD
---
I personally had an easier time in Hearthstone, and good players in Hearthstone have an above 60% winrate.  
---
I found the grind to solo rank 1 in DBD harder than the grind to Legend in Hearthstone personally.
---
Very toxic, watch some of his videos 
---
so whats up with people always mentioning that he’s a pedophile as a reason for him to get banned? That doesnt have anything to do with getting banned. And how old is this guy anyways?
---
&gt; Do you have a time stamp where he's making good survivors look bad then?
---
See the problem with people that make the argument you make is that as soon as I show that, you'll just say the survivors didn't play well. Its never the killer played well, its the survivors were potatoes. Its always the exact same argument.
---
Hearthstone is a card game with many variables like the meta at the time and what deck you were using
---
That’s the fucking point. Stop slugging and making the game unfun for somebody else just because you couldn’t end it before 2 gens. 
---
He picks on 13 years old gorl in his community and trys to hook up banning uderage girl in relations via discord, a fucking pathetic excuss of a human being !

Lol leaving early is fine,you’re playing he game as you like it

Dcing is fking scummy though
---
You do realize a hatch escape gives you tons of BP as a killer right?

Don't go into the basement or you'll get stuck. Its a bug that appeared in this patch. Sometimes you cant even do anything as the killer hooked you in the basement and now you're stuck there unable to do anything.
---
REquesting nudes and sex from underaged girls over discord ! YES HE IS ! 
---
Snipe them asses
---
You should see how many times people rebuy CSGO.
---
Thought I'd make more Legion art with just Susie this time.
---
I wanted to play with the idea that maybe she'd have regrets from being the most naive out of the bunch.
---
There is fucking evendance for it, but sure stay a salty fanboi soyboy ochido cuck ! 
---
We appreciate your huntress cosplay
---
You got uppercuted by the floor you sorry fool
---
I did disagree with what people have to say, the only thing is I wanted to give out my true honest opinion about how I play, enjoy the game and such. Sure I will get a shit ton of backlash, but that's the price I'm willing to pay to let my voice be heard.
---
When ya think about it, I'm being calm and open about the responses you all give to me, I barely even insult anybody and read what you all have to say before I reply to each of ya. Though if you don't think I'm not a nice person then that's fine buddy. 
---
Ok keep your head in your ass if you still support ochido stfu and gtfo ! 
---
You can just put the vod of Zubat’s or Scott’s or whoevers recent stream
---
Yes it would negate the exposed effect of Myers first tier 3, but imo the best part about their three Myers is the lunge and movement speed. Basically the perk would give you an extra health state if you are exposed so if you think that's op then idk maybe it is?
---
Voodoo.
---
Hacking legacy and event cosmetics. That said he’s only had two strikes against him. His next offence is his last
---
Why did he got banned?
---
3Head really optimal play here by Fu4jiin, really coordinated effort here.
---
They have a three strike policy if I’m not mistaken. He’s got two strikes. His next offence is his last
---
As much as I feel sympathy towards you and agree that sitting there for 4 minutes bleeding us is fucking stupid, it’s not really fair for the killer. 
---
If they want to try ahead for that 4K then you shouldn’t be able to take it away from them that easily regardless how dumb it is, in my opinion at least. 
---
I would think so. It’s not showing the day when the ban will end. Maybe that means it’s permanent?
---
DBD is really just a cult following, not many people know about it so I get why it hasn't gotten a lot of attention besides from our community itself.
---
Oh okay. Thank you
---
I witnessed a nea disappear in the basement when I was hooked in the basement, she was standing still crouched against the wall (dont know what the hell she was doing, looked like waiting for me to die) and when I move the camera one second, Inmove it again and she isn't there. No aura to be shown, she wasn't in the lockers. It seems she exited the match because I could see the killers build but it showed like she was still in there.
---
Okay it’s a billy with his Chainsaw ready to go if you go for the unhook and we were on the swamp. it was a shit game and all I want is the unhook penalty removed it’s unfair and since camping, tunneling, has gone rampant now since it’s not a ban able offense and all you camping assholes can have your way! Also I don’t want to hear another thing from you crybaby’s on DS! You wanna camp I’m gonna use DS! 
---
Griefing, exploit abuse, witch hunting, and ban evading.
---
Your math on sloppy is good, but ruin has other factors that are difficult to account for.  You might have three or four survivors abandoning gens to search for ruin, if each survivors spends 20 seconds away from a gen looking around, you've already got your 80.
---
Another thing is that it makes great skillchecks grant no progression - which is very impactful at high ranks.  
---
Sloppy is good, and consistent, but I will take ruin over it nine times out of ten unless I am going for some antiheal shenanigans.  
---
On Pig, take both!
---
He got it way earlier than that
---
So why can the killer just let somebody be able to do nothing for 5 minutes as he looks for am immersed claud across the map sitting on hatch? That’s not fair to them. 
---
That is a squad of Claudettes.
---
Hey streamer, you’re pretty trash. I faced against you and your boyfriend Zubrat or whatever and all you guys do is use OP killers like Billy and Huntress and run loops correctly and hide your red light and slug in order to win. Kinda sad. Lucky my friends werent on, you would have gotten pwned. Later nerds.
---
&gt;  Ruin adds on top that it makes people go and walk around, searching for a totem on top of similar time added to the game.  
---
Is what I said. It was indeed part of the comment, just not part of the math.  
---
True enough.
---
Honestly, I just let the last survivor in the hatch its easier then a 10 minute stand off
---
So that the stupid fanboy understand it right, i got you ;)
---
This is like 3 stooges level stuff. So freaking funny.
---
Okay I don’t pay much attention to him just seen some of his montages, but yeah makes sense I was just hoping it wasn’t because he was good at avoiding the killer since that’s the objective but he sounds like a bad dude
---
Rank 1 survivor is a joke to get. Rank 1 killer is even more of a joke if you tunnel and soft camp. Get over yourself.
---
So I found out afterwards. It sucks tho. If I knew someone left, I would not have hooked the last guy. I was doctor, I would have no trouble slugging and looking for the last guy
---
You're right. I didn't watch the video the user mentioned.  I do not follow him.  I agree, he needs to be permenantly banned. But the only point I'm disagreeing with is calling him a pedophile based off saying "send nudes".   Sure, it is a stupid thing to say to anyone, but simply saying it because you're immature and stupid doesn't make you a pedo. Being a pedophile is an extremely sick mental illness. 
---
But ok, I'm entitled to my opinion as much as you are and backed up my reason and logic.  
---
Personally, I burn a mori and forget I have it. I may even remind myself partway through the game and then promptly forget again.
---
Lol you sound stupid . Unfair to killers but what about the survivor on the floor for 4 minutes
---
Hell I'd rather run ruin just cause noed could spawn in an even worse spot depending 
---
No perving on underage girl ain't legal chief
---
were you the person I killed with hillbilly in the basement then proceeded to call me a sweaty try hard despite running no perks or add-ons
---
You do know that the video pretty much states he was even going for underage girls as well? Girls he knew were underaged? Not the age of consent? Y'know..kinda sounds like a pedo. Sure saying send nudes is immature and a poor joke, but when you do it enough then it becomes reality or people will see it as such.
---
Exactly
---
Well good, at least there are three or four maps where totems aren’t literally sitting out in the open... let killer’s have their totems live for more than two seconds.....
---
Yah, definitely changes how you play it which sucks. The survivor in my game was thinking his teammate was in a locker the whole game which is also kind of funny
---
I mean it's Haddonfield. Only tme I won't DC on it is if someone uses bps. Even then I'm going to play like a dick if someone used an offering.
---
Here we go
---
Personally I mostly use legion to farm. Got me so many BPs during christmas double bp
---
Oh damn, my bad
---
It’s not supposed to be easy for either side and I didn’t claim it was.
---
See how dumb putting words in my mouth makes you look?

That's the risk of running totems? It's what makes them not OP.

thanks!
---
On a witch hunt on a subreddit, where people are talking all sortsa crazy crap about a guy who plays a game? Yes, I have no problem doing that.
---
Lmfao "people like you". Never said I slugged anyone, buddy. It's not "making the game unfun", it's trying to get a 4k and deny hatch. 
---
Dwight turns into a claudette
---
Dbd names are seriously one of my favorite parts of this game and community 
---
Holy frick I didn't know that
---
He abuses exploits like his life depends it, is extremely toxic, has annoying ear rape sound effects, has a fan base full of twelve year olds who act like he’s a god and worship him, and he’s a pedophile.
---
I’ve used all his addons and I still prefer shorter dream transition. I like to start chase ASAP. 
---
Love the head tilts
---
That makes the game unfun. Go into a match as survivor and get slugged for 4 minutes against a doctor whose chasing around a survivor at tier 3 so they can’t pick you up or snap out of it.
---
"I got rank 1 using legion!"
---
That's the worst of them all. 
---
as much as i dislike ochido, you really shouldn’t encourage doxxing *especially on a public forum on the internet*
---
Alright. I just watched the videos that were linked, after I had made my comment. I see now it was going beyond just joking and immaturity.  Yikes.  Honestly, I purposely avoid any news related things about him because I honestly don't understand how he was an idol in the community. At some point, I think most of his followers are around jsut to see what outrageous thing he will get away with next or banned for. 
---
All of these reddit post about lagging game play tells me that the next patch will be bad.
---
He summed it up nicely in part of his reaction to the ban; "They dont want me to play their game." 
---
Yeah, dumbass, that's kinda the point. 
---
Yeah but theyre also putting out an update that fixes that kind of stuff
---
Killers would feel like they have to play that character because it’s extra bloodpoints and we all know what the BP grind is like nowadays. 
---
Removed - Oversaturated Content
---
Anti-Hellen Keller
---
If you sort by Hot one of the top posts is an Ochido related post where plenty of people have explained why he is so disliked by many.
---
Honestly, it's the best thing to do with these sorts of people, ignoring them and not giving any attention, since it's usually the same stupid shit he pulls. I don't blame you at all for that.
---
You know, with all these fucking aprons, we should just make Trapper a chef and give him a fucking meat cleaver.
---
Ochido after getting banned: "AH DUUUUUD, EH WOT DIHD I DUEEEE"

You embraced a pedophile as your DbD meme lord?

Hmm. No. The last time i was toxic waste was a few days back .

Biased Devs wont ban Noob3 though for ban evading as well. Shows bias tbh. Ochido stopped exploiting and whatnot like he used to on PC, on PS4 and got banned but when Noob3 changed, he was granting extra chances. Rule should be inforced to ALL, not just one 
---
It would also be like "oh this person might have a hex" but if that person doesn't than its useless
---
nice work, I approve
---
Every account on PS4 has online capabilities but if you don’t buy the PSN membership you can’t play online. And you have to purchase it with each account individually. So he’d have to make a new account and buy PSN subscription to use online play.
---
A killer leaving everybody on the ground for 4 minutes is holding the game hostage. A killer camping a downed survivor for four minutes is an asshole. A survivor bleeding out because they crawled off to hide for four minutes is just as stupid as you say I am. 
---
Started a game as level 1 feng min because of it
---
Theyre pushing an update to make that kind of stuff better
---
Just watched the video, holy crap Ochido is a piece of crap 
---
Thank you
---
You're welcome !
---
For me on ps4 it’s been a lot more stable recently. It’s still not great but there’s been a noticeable improvement. 
---
Just play Leatherface, so then you can camp your Ruin like a boss
---
Yeah but People dont run it because usually the totems are pretty easy to find it would encourage people to use it more often
---
You don't want to provide an example because people are never convinced by your examples? Well, I don't think it's bragging for me to say that I do have an open mind and despite being not-great at DbD I'm pretty good at spotting survivor errors from killer replays. Both of those games at 9:42 for example were still wins despite Zubat not doing his best because the survivors were wasting a lot of time. If people are really never convinced by your examples, maybe you're just not explaining them that well.
---
&gt; And fine, its not a completely black and white comparison but the numbers are so incredibly far apart that level of deviation due to whatever variables doesn't matter anymore.
---
Those variables contributed to the difference, so to say the difference is so big the variables don't matter is incorrect unless you know by how much those variables contributed. I actually didn't care enough to count the games myself, but doing killer rotation for like 80% of it definitely had a big impact on how many games it took him to get rank1.
---
Treehugger
---
I guess a consolation of this is the longer we keep you on DBD the less contact you have with the rest of society.
---
But those are survivor perks
---
Why not both? 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18PbwYdjsps
---
Not true. I'm always happy for other people. =) 
---
Well it would be for new players not you meaning advanced players, it would be seperate not merged into the main game.
---
Yikes...
---
*survivors spawns next to my ruin*
---
Arent they already kinda useless?
---
At least it shut him up … that alone was worth it. 
---
Meg's premonition went off
---
Read the top comment as well. 
---
Noob3 ban evaded by making more accounts. Why isnt he banned?
---
His video is actually more cringe than explaining the serious topics. First half is hating on Orchido’s vids so by the second half I can’t take Ardetha seriously. My personal take away was there’s definitely more to the story but this “Ardetha” isn’t the person to tell it. I wouldn’t advise people to watch his video.  
---
Pretty much every spot survivors can get to like this killers can too with their lunge
---
He removes all skill from chasing a survivor and is annoying as you spend half the game mending unless you get tunneled. It's boring, annoying, and not a fun interaction.
---
I love how people are complaining that Legion is bad for competitive play and at the same time are saying that not all killers need to be balanced for tournament play. It's like this sub can't make up their minds.
---
He got banned on console for ban evading.  He was hardware banned on PC so he switched to console where bans weren’t established yet.
---
I didn't see that option at all in this video.
---
Ugly and Nimble.
---
Stop being bad then 4head
---
I only recall DCing maybe twice. Once when I was just coming back from a long break from the game and was immediately put into a super hardcore 4man SWF match against my leatherface. Just figured I wasn't having literally any fun mid game so I closed out and went to play something else. other time I don't even remember the situation (now that I think about it I believe it was a time I was nurse in Haddonfield pre-fixes).
---
Good fucking riddance. Can't say I'll miss him tbh.
---
What a shitty comparison. It’s a fucking killer, not a competitive shooter.
---
&gt;it's trying to get a 4k and deny hatch
---
ima a level 50 spirit and not prestige and have every perk and eventually you'll run out of perks and where perks usually are you might get a mori or ultra rare items and if you unlock a teachable that perks comes to the next bloodweb immediately but whatever you dont prestige 
---
Moon walking and frank's mixtape are what make legion a broken killer, other than that they are alright 
---
Yea. I’m not that great at the whole *learning* thing I was supposed to be doing. 
---
He sucks.
---
Love this I never knew the guy till I caught him hiding in the basement waiting out our teammate and I to die. We had two gens left and I saved him from hooked. After I saw his aura in the basement running around. I lead the killer down there to kill us and the other guy hatch escaped.  
---
stop writing fucking 5k word essays ffs. nobody has the patience to read all this.
---
Yeah I stumbled upon his video before and in the first bit he came across as one of those leafy youtubers that just spout hatred because they don't like something or someone so I stopped watching
---
.... I don’t play him but I will if they give him that skin. But it better have a big ass hat.
---
Hey, how dare you point out that someone is a douche because they have no life and do nothing but play a game and then belittle others who are bad because they can't spend all day try Harding on a game, shame on you
---
What was the thing that ultimately got him banned? There had to be something that just made PS go ‘no.’ 
---
Taking hostage? Not really. Since he is gonna bleed out eventually. Its still exploting, which is just as if not more banable.
---
People confuse lag switching with the fact survivors have fucking massive hit boxes so you can get hit across 2 windows and a pallet
---
Thanks for the explanation
---
Nice work!
---
Imagine being so toxic that a majority of a community is celebrating your ban.
---
*Spirit with Prayer Beads Bracelet*.
---
I don't know how to link posts but if you check the hot section it will be one of the pinned threads.
---
It'll be a Twitter link
---
Suvivor can't be pleased 
---
Only thing that really matters is the vault bug, guess I wanted to include me flexing on this legion as well
---
Cluttering the sub?? You realize how fucking stupid you sound lmao are u that much of a virgin to think that one post on reddit which allows an infinite amount of posts is considered "cluttering?" Tell me more a out how u have nothing better to do than show your virginity over the internet 
---
They can just hardware ban him and his IP
---
If you think about it, you probly need like 10 perks on each side. Or just 4 if you keep to one build and main one killer. That can be optimized. 
---
Neg...a...tive
---
No
---
Is it new exploit?
---
Would love some context here
---
I’m giving your comment silver because I haven’t laughed at a reply like that in months lmao
---
Shared exploits and also committed witch hunting.
---
Did we just become friends?
---
Just got done playing a match on pc where there were 3 survivors left and 4 generators done and the dull key wouldn’t open the hatch
---
Who tf didn't appreciate this amazing cosplay? 
---
Yeah but a person with average intelligence or above can reliably spot sarcasm.

Some frames would be nice pls and thnk

---
I fucking hate OchiDO, one of the biggest cunts of mankind.
---
What were the hostage situations? I've heard about killers bodyblocking the survivors and holding them hostage that way, how does one do it the other way around?
---
The reason why he got banned
---
Harassment: Communication Abuse
---
Insults, intimidation, hateful speech, repeated harassment
---
Multiplatform harassment (Steam/Twitter/Facebook, Twitch etc.) – These are exceptional cases, if you go all the way to do this, you will be banned for 48 hours right away, skipping the 24 hours ban.
---
And this
---
Greifing: Intentional gameplay abuse
---
Working with the opposite team to gain an advantage or grief teammates
---
Targeting specific users repeatedly in order to ruin their game experience
---
Holding the game hostage
---
Someone plz link me the clip
---
We just told you why. Ban evasion, being toxic and sending his 12 year old fanbase to harass players who call him out on his BS.
---
I mean, why WOULDN'T you be happy when a player like that gets banned? 
---
I always thought he was Russian. I dont know why
---
Imagine thinking diversion is OK but deliverance isn't
---
Also Jeff has 3 good perks and Adam has 1 good perk and one decent perk 
---
I bet most of the people celebrating him getting banned have probably suffered from his jukes and flashlight saves, be reasonable people this ban is only temporary he’ll be back in a few weeks if not months. 
---
Hey bud. I’m asking what he got banned for in the first place. 
---
Chef Boyar-Dear God Please No!
---
i love this. thank you u/hotrod_mccoolguy
---
As proof that it's mine, there's a few WIPs on my insta [https://www.instagram.com/robinthecriticaleye](https://www.instagram.com/robinthecriticaleye)
---
i fixed it by locking fps to 60 again.
---
Self care, teammates are so unreliable at all ranks that probably 70% of the matches the gates don't even get powered on. If its a swf then adrenaline wins without a doubt
---
Tbh it could have been bad ping. I've had games where the connection is fine then at some point becomes trash then stabilizes. They could just have an unstable connection 
---
Ah gotcha. I hate that stuff. 
---
The 12 year old Ochido fans are attempting to sue BHVR
---
Honestly it’s people like this who give twitch streamers a bad rap. I wish streamers could realize the fact just because a few people watch them, the world does not revolve around them. Streamers should be role models and examples for the community. Sorry that you had to experience that kind of treatment but, I’m happy you made him lose a purple item :) keep doing what your doing man!:)
---
Well a lot of people DC anyway because they don’t wanna play slug simulator 2019.
---
Yeah, basically earlier today Ochido got banned on PS4 (probably for ban-evading from his previous three bans on PC). His fanboys got mad and raided the server, causing the general and media chats to be locked.
---
But it gets worse.
---
One of these fanboys managed to hack into the server via a bot and deleted the more important channels (announcements, rules, ect) and banned around 6k people.
---
Big yikes.
---
Ya I would say that was the case if it didnt only happen everytime he saw one of us and then admitted to it after the game when I called him out on it lol 
---
I don't know about this guy in particular but there are known exploits that let you afk outside the map as a survivor and the game will not end unless you quit or can snipe them with an axe as huntress.    
---
I had a guy do this to me the other day and was lucky enough to be playing huntress, still took an extra 10 mins or so to find the right angle to snipe him. His steam profile comments was just a list of people calling him out for doing the same thing.   
---
   
---
Pretty bullshit and toxic.
---
Hahaha funny joke.
---
No. Unless there’s something I’m missing? Prestige all it does is get you new costumes. 
---
I don't know the exact circumstances, but this is what I've heard about him being banned. So sorry if I said something wrong
---
Yeah, but a recent patch made it so that Freddy can hit people when they're on the hook, so he can BM like any other killer now. It's kind of silly that he can't hit people while they're out of the dreamworld and off the hook now.
---
Level 4 trapper and you’re rank 1?!? Can you make a guide for us plebs? 
---
They are literally allowed to, read the eula.
---
First of all, people act like this ban is seriously going to stop him from playing. Secondly the devs aren’t that smart enough to make their ban system strong as they should it’s not like it’s hard to get passed it. And Lastly considering how triggered and tilted you are by this comment cry me river so I can go rafting down it pls 
---
sounds like a weird change
---
Its a good meme but only really works with Lithe to let you get enough distance for the scratch marks not to matter
---
Okay then just solely compare the rank 4-1 games and they're still not even close, with only Nurse.
---
All three of Jeff's perks are really good. Adam's Deliverance is great, but Diversion and Autodidact are less so.
---
hes not downed?
---
This is the order as to why he (and ochido) got banned:
---
Noob: 1st offense: Hacking legacy/exclusives
---
Noob: 2nd offense: Unknown.
---
Conclusion: I think they unbanned him on his second account because I don’t believe he made a third. Could be wrong though.
---
Ochido: 1st offense: Witch hunting, griefing.
---
Ochido: 2nd offense: Exploiting/hacking (p3 clown w/ lv6 devotion)
---
Ochido: 3rd offense: more than likely its ban evasion.
---
I care about people’s achievements in this game, no matter how minimal it may seem to you. Good job to whoever reached rank 1 for the first time!
---
crap guys im so screwed my brother did this and I didnt stop him haha man oh man if my brother gets me banned that will be so sad :(.
---
Once when I was playing Spirit only one survivor loaded in. I let them complete all the gens and escape because I felt bad
---
Hopefully you ran the chainsaw up her ass soon after
---
I think it was to make an example. And it certainly was for griefing as opposed to the prestige exploit (which is far less obvious without checking an individuals save file). I think they just made an example of him to scare everyone else
---
I think it was an accident cause on PS4 the button to heal and pull down the pallet is the same. 
---
I thought you needed to be p3 before you could continue to get all the perks, thought that if you hit 50 you either prestige or don't level them at all
---
The salt you get once you're good with her is worth it.
---
Deliverance really isn't that great, though. It's way too situational.
---
In order for it to work AT ALL, you need to unhook one other player before anyone else does, and before you get hooked.
---
Then, even if it is activated, you're just shooting yourself in the foot, since mostly people are going to come help you, anyway. You're going to be denying people points AND needlessly making yourself broken.
---
Yes, occasionally, there's going to be moments where it saves the game, but they happen so few and far apart, it's really hard to justify a perk slot for it.
---
Deliverance sucks ass lmao. Diversion is unironically Adam’s best perk you just have to use it on someone other than Adam.
---
Wow this is really good! :)
---
pebble
---
Who is that guy and why did he get banned?
---
This is not good
---
Good, ban that toxic streamer.
---
can i have a clean ver of this
---
How is Oh cheeto still relevant?
---
Is preventing the last survivor from dying or escaping by letting him escape in the basement, or corner of the map for an extended period of time, (30+ minutes) with clear intent of harrassing the last survivor when they could easily end the game at any time, considered to be a bannable offense? (griefing)?
---
Asking so I don't waste moderators time when using the new report system.
---
r/fuckyoukaren
---
I was told that Noob hacked back stuff he lost due to some fuck-up by BHVR. Is that true?
---
Sometimes u just gotta hide in a corner and wait for one of your teammates to get injured first. Playing against tunneling killers is tough
---
He has 0 perks and addons and complains about getting a 2k. Fucking seriously, this guy.
---
idk ...in so much on twitch..
---
Thank you 
---
I mean I didn't even have a good match. Gen rushed, then 3 escapes, 1 hook
---
I cannot personally confirm or deny that.
---
Ok thank you 
---
Ace in my hole made me chuckle. God I love this community 
---
...but a compound *word* is one *word*
---
This was basically a thanos snap then, well I'm dead now
---
This is true.
---
How did you count tru3's games? I could be misremembering, but I think he tried to do killer rotation even in red ranks and gave up.
---
The only “good” survivor perks are Aftercare and Diversion but even then they are really niche and probably not worth the slot. While killers got Haunted Ground+Spirit Fury and then got Discordance, Spirit Fury being one of the best perks in the game.
---
It's your punishment for using DS
---
Same thing happened to me but he was more polite about it
---
Just begged me not to play legion
---
But here I am
---
Breakdown is awful honestly. Half of it doesnt work on basement hooks and its effect isnt worth a perk slot.
---
I didn’t think so. Perks you don’t have will continuously generate in the bloodweb till you have them all. 
---
surprising how many dont see anything wrong
---
Poor?
---
Monitor and Abuse + black colored hag is actually scary AF.
---
Has anyone actually been banned for exploiting that glitch yet? Equally, has anyone aside from Ochido been banned on console at all? 
---
thank you for the advice!! :) i’m actually really excited to try this build!
---
Prestige just lets you reset and in return you get a bloody cosmetic.
---
The fact that sometimes trying to enter a lobby on pc as a survivor results in an infinite load screen. 
---
This is great news haha I dont have to prestige anyone? I couldn't care less about the cosmetics
---
LET THEM COME!
---
OUR SPEARS ARE SHARP, OUR BEARDS ARE SHAVEN AND THE ONLY THING WE FEAR IS THAT HIS SLAUGHTER WILL NOT APPEASE OUR HUNGER FOR VENGEANCE!

---
Aftercare makes for a more fun game but if you're playing seriously you'll probably just run Bond or Empathy. It can be a beast if you pull it off esrly game tho. Breakdown is nice in its tier 3 just for the killer aura reading (with Deliverance its a great combo). And Distortion is just to play immersed and chill. 
---
They aren't bad perks, but if you want tonplay efficiently you'll run something else. You can still run them and do great. Good, not the best.
---
The little quotes for the perks are the best I’ve ever seen. 10/10 design
---
what makes them check someones save file? its not like other players could know about what you have and report you for it.
---
Did you watch the entire video or just immediately try to start a debate in the comments? 
---
Perma tier 1 mike 
---
Title ruined it for me
---
It's possible to time it correctly to get hit into the dying state and heal at the same time, but it's really risky and has to be timed perfectly.
---
Xbox has a banning system as well. he wouldn't last long. 
---
Step 1: run prove thyself
---
Step 2: do one gen with another survivor
---
Step 3 get chased for a little bit. Congrats you should pip
---
Nah, EULA means they can ban people for basically anything. If they wanted to, BHVR could pick a random day and perma-ban everyone who said the word 'goose' in post-game chat. Companies have massive leeway with stuff like that.
---
"I can't believe you noticed something completely different than I did, how dare you"
---
I can relate I have 2 children who have no concept of my line of sight to the TV.
---
I’ve never prestiged anyone because I don’t care about cosmetics either lol. I have all survivor perks on my Meg. Prestiging up will give you rarer items in the bloodweb too supposedly but a friend of mine said that’s not true in his case lol. So I just leave them and have my same basic Meg outfit I started with. 
---
A lag switch is a piece of equipment installed on a home network that temporarily delays the flow of traffic to the internet. In other words, it can definitely be used on a ps4 bc what you’re bypassing isn’t a console or pc oversight, you’re altering the network. Lag switching is possible and has been a real threat during the evolution of console gaming
---
I can finally rep my name
---
POYO!
---
ah perfect. i'll check that out thx
---
seems like op needs to chill out 
---
Then dont. I prefaced by saying it's going to be long and dont read it all if you dont want to.
---
Thank you for the info. I had not known that. Thought it was a software you can install on PC. 
---
Thanks! :p
---
yup

"Kenneth Chase [The Clown] was born in 1932" which makes him 87 if the Entity's realm is in 2019.
---
They have no mither recovery.
---
I agree. No mercy for survivors. I have been teabagged and looped too many times to give anyone a breather.
---
The Entity grabs survivors and killers from all different points in time. And presumably they don't age in the realm. So he is whatever age he was grabbed at still.
---
with horribly loud music...
---
Because I already bought it
---
You really shouldn't defend a pedo on a public forum. 
---
I'd rather Lithe + Quick &amp; Quiet. Dance With Me is ok, but if you use those three perks together it takes up 3 perk slots, and Q&amp;Q allows for more general use than DWM. 
---
unemployment office.
---
This post smells like sodium.
---
If you hover over an addon so that it gets slightly larger, and then use Home/End to switch to another killer that also has an addon in that same place, it'll get bigger. When you switch back, the addon will have kept its size and you can make it bigger. No exploit here.
---
He's too old for this shit.
---
He inhales survivors for his mori, and then copies their perks.
---
this is the best, plz make more!
---
This is wrong :0
---
Hit rank 1 today with somewhere between 10-15(90 in total) hours of playtime as killer
---
Legion btw

Im pretty sure he can just make a new PS4 account/buy an xbox. He can come back if he wants to. The question is, will he?

---
ironic post
---
The killer not only won in game he won in real life. He ran your buddies cheeks and your buddy will probably catch a ban too. This killer got 3 dubs off of one child.

What is this ochido thing going around?
---
DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUD
---
He preotect
---
He attack
---
He eats your ass
---
The problem with noed is it doesn't spawn until the gens are done. Which makes it kind of stupid. Not many survivors cleanse regular totems because why bother except extra blood points, and when the gens are done most survivors dont even bother thinking about totems they only think about the doors. I think it would be more balanced and less looked down upon if it spawned once like only 1 or 2 gens remained, and then actually activated once they were all done. Also while were on the subject fuck totem spawn locations. 80% of the time I use any kind of totem a survivor spawns right in front of it or it's like right next to a generator. 
---
Poor, yes poor man child, a f*** trash of human kind, a prove that evelotion can be reversed, that humans are capable of devolution. 
---
There’s a reason you’re getting downvotes chief. This isn’t it.
---
banning an infamous streamer to scare people more. woooah man they’re gonna definitely ban other console players
---
The only thing agree one what you said was the "Rest in piece" part that garbage man child deserves to die! And may he burn in freaking hell.
---
the first time was modding game files second time he was banned without a reason right?
---
I’m not believing the pedo thing until I find solid evidence. Thats a serious accusation. This community is so deranged when it comes to ochido that it will cling to any little thing bad said about him, true or not.
---
It's latency. On the flipside, killers have many hits that should have landed but they don't. It's all about connection. On their side, it shows that it connected just fine.
---
It’s disrespectful, people have been asking for bans on console. Stop defending bad practices
---
You might fish for compliments to hard there dear, but by God you look awesome, the entity would be proud!
---
Dammit I took the bait or should I say I catched the hatched? *Seinfield music plays"

Wow your friend sounds dumb

Just leave.

I'd rather just leave and start a new game.

Pop Goes The Weasel &gt; Overcharge
---
I pip 99% of the time, as long as I get two safe hook rescues. Run Borrowed Time, and you'll never depip again.
---
Its been proven. Shits like 6 months old.
---
Last time they banned him it was so hard to get around he had to swap to console. Sounds pretty hard to get around to me lol
---
That is scary. Wait does huntress actually show her stomach?
---
I've heard so much talk about this guy what does he do to get him such a shitty rep?
---
Why are you happy?
---
Playstation can ban him too, if he ban evades. ;) from the actual console too.
---
If your average BP is 20k you should be pipping lol. Not saying your bad but maybe your not getting safe unhooks? Are they solo gens are were there 2-3 people on the gen with you. Are the chases long or do they end in seconds? It’s not as easy to pip as a survivor now because they removed some infinite’s and stuff like that. You should be pipping if your a good teammate and not dying in the first 5 minutes.

Those two work great together IF you have lithe and are on a map like Lery’s. I make sure I run Quick and Quiet as a staple perk because it’s so useful. Mind gaming killers in lockers, hiding from killers, mind gaming killers on window vaults. It’s pretty handy
---
Lmfao he got banned on PS4 too amazing 
---
Making fun of the Gillette commercial 
---
soooo it's gonna get way worse. Plus all the duped moris from the glitch. Have fun! 
---
Cold dirt best addon
---
Don’t let this deter you from playing Nurse. She is the most difficult killer to learn. Survivors can be...... pretty salty at times. Just keep doing you :) hope to see you in the fog one day :)
---
I'll slug your ass and let you bleed out too if you have DS and aint used it yet
---
I forgot he existed to begin with tbh
---
I just watched his last 4 games and he faced HappyCow and Coke Hogan twice each with 1 or 0 perks. At the very least, I think they were sniping to help Zubat.
---
Does anybody have a timestamp in the VOD where Zubat faced an SWF with template perks and toolboxes and shit?
---
toxic, used glitches on stream to ruin the killers game. 
---
I tried spies with spirit and I didnt like it. Im using surveillance now with spirit and billy and I think its super strong.
---
How did that scare me....
---
Alright, I never wanted to be in this place, but this has gone too far.
---
Here's why you're wrong in every single point:
---
	1. You misleading the timeline. It happened AFTER he got banned multiple times w/o 'item exploiting'. Multiple people mentioned that you get HW perma-banned after 2 account bans (e.g. case of no0b3). But Ochido got banned the next day he started playing with fresh account (i.e. no 'item exploiting'). And then again. So he got tired after unfair bans. Wrong thing, I admit, but only in response of another wrong thing. He also never tried to hide it (could've change player rank as well).
---
	2. In general, 'exploit' is something that requires certain action to execute. Examples? OK: swapping perk pages fast to get the same perk multiple times or billy's chainsaw on myers (bug that's been in the game 2y ago, was used by multiple people on stream, they got no ban); using 3rd party software or steam bug to reset rank (basically cheats) - multiple fog whispers been using it for ages and got nothing (instead community manager contacted them and asked not to do it, IIRC), zubat even did it right on stream without changing screens. I can find dozens of cases of different streamers 'using bugs to gain advantage' (one more from this subreddit favourite streamer:  [https://www.twitch.tv/tru3ta1ent/clip/RichColorfulSoymilkTheTarFu](https://www.twitch.tv/tru3ta1ent/clip/RichColorfulSoymilkTheTarFu) ). Also, I can't remember a single game where people got banned for using bugs, because it's a such a shame for developers to ban other people for their own \[developers\] mistakes(player shouldn't even be bothered to determine whethere something was put in the game intentionally or not). Examples that are in my head right now [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNQ71mfmt80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNQ71mfmt80) \- pro team found an exploit that allowed to see the almost entire map. Again, pro team in tournament. Banned? No, awarded with graffiti on the map. Or this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5I-5eo\_vDM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5I-5eo_vDM) \- Pro player used bug in 1M$ tournament and no one got banned. 
---
	And then you advocate banning ochido for just standing still for 15 seconds? Ridiculous and double standard.
---
	3. As in 1st point, no reason to discuss it in the context of unfair bans. Just a reciprocation.
---
	4. The fact that you bring someone's personal life in the topic of banning a PLAYER IN THE COMPUTER GAME is just amusing. It's not your or anyone else's business at all. I understand that you have very few and weak arguments, but this won't work with me, sorry. And as the last words on this: please check the definition of pedo before using this word, because it's quite a strong word. Especially in the context that he's 19yo.
---
	5. Complete lie and false narrative. Apparently you're talking about the 40secodns clip - [https://www.twitch.tv/ochidotv/clip/LivelyObliqueEchidnaCharlietheUnicorn](https://www.twitch.tv/ochidotv/clip/LivelyObliqueEchidnaCharlietheUnicorn) . But you (and everyone else) just completely ignoring the context. I'll provide some: killer was taking game hostage by blocking stairs in the basement for like 10 minutes. This is a bannable offense. So he wanted to ban him. Back at that days, in-game reports meant absolutely nothing and you had to use google form with attached video and STEAM PROFILE. He had no clue about how this system works and  someone in chat said 'I made a clip, give me his steam id and I fill out the the form'. Then stuff on this clip happens. He even says 'SOMEONE' in the clip, not 'everyone'. Yes, it's wrong from a twitch point of view, he admitted this mistake. So this has nothing to do with DbD itself. However, you're saying 'leave hateful messages on steam' which is a straight up and malicious LIE. Fake news. And speaking of witch hunt, checkout the 3rd rule of this subreddit (mentioning people by name in negative light), you will be surprised.
---
	6. Rephrasing: "I just don't like him". Can't be a valid point at all. Yet I will elaborate on it: 1) multiple streamers during the 'deranking podcast' said that they don't care about the fun of other people' (including BMs). Yet no one call it 'shitty behavior' and yells for bans. Clips of BMs (usually towards survivors) also get upvoted quite often here, huh? Just another double standard. 2) Props to you and other subreddit, a year ago here people were saying he should be banned for 'pallet looping, DS and flashlights'. Glad you grew up to at least saying 'using perks isn't toxic'.
---
	7. I don't find someones content funny, let's ban them! Clearly shows how you're not a 'twelve-year-old'. Funny how it sounds like media calls 'pewdiepie 9year-olds'. Very mature. (on a side note, can you link me content creators who have magic abilities to create not-the-same-content in dbd? I'd appreciate that)
---
Also, other people mentioning he was 'using tru3ta1ent clip without permission'. This is just awesome. Yet no one questions 'exposers' whether they ask a permit from ochido to use his stuff in their videos. Funny, huh? And to be more serious: google what fair use is.
---
Concluding, a lot of double standards and total lies being spread about ochido, while he just wants to create content for entertainment without being part of any drama (just compare amount of times he tried to defend himself(which is zero I guess) and how often other people do that, e.g. jen about being toxic or deranking, tru3ta1ent spends basically most part of his streams arguing about toxicity/other stuff/people). And now his desire to ignore drama/inability to defend himself  got him banned on second platform.
---
I understand this reply would be downvoted to hell, people don't like hearing facts that contradict with their views, but please, do me a favor and express your arguments, I genuinely wanna see them, thanks :)
---
Duh Joey is sexy af
---
If only Frank was that hairy. 
---
Vpn on a playstation. Thats possible?
---
He said his second ban was for hacking flashlights. Supposedly he has gone straight. Been like a year since his ban, and he is closely watched by the DBD team, so I guess he went legit, like Zekeo
---
This is the reason (or one of them) why DBD community is toxic. Known for abusing glitches, being a cunt and a pedophile. He was evading bans for ages. Got permabanned on PC and went for console, but devs gifted him a big fuck you and banned him on console too. There were no bans on console earlier. He deserved to be banned. 
---
on another thread of mine I deleted, not sure whether it's true or not but them being the oldest killer makes sense, but so does the plague doctor and a coal miner, we'll see in less than a month, I wonder who the survivor will be too.
---
it could be any killer but whoever they are don't seem like they're from a movie or TV show.
---
I mean, he makes serious money from his youtube account(Millions of views per vid) and stream, he will do it again.
---
re the insta death on the hook: attempting to escape on the hook  lowers your health meter, *even if you succeed.*
---
So since you kobe'd on your last chance, your bar dropped below struggle, then when you got hooked, you died since you were technically already in struggle.
---
What’s your build first of all? You need to see how smart the survivors are first so when you do a loop and are about to catch up to them, (within lunge range) instead of lunging ready up your hatchet and see if they drop a pallet. If they drop it, throw the hatchet. If they don’t drop it then they have a basic understanding of the huntress. Use windows to your advantage and throw hatchets through them as well. Don’t focus on killing everyone while learning the Huntress. Instead focus on your hatchet throws. Mind gaming as a Huntress is crucial to doing well with her. You’ll have to read the survivor movements, do they dodge left or right usually? Don’t rush to throw your hatchets, instead make every hatchet count. Also keep an eye on your hatchet count you generally don’t want to chase without any hatchets (unless it’s a free hit). Use your hatchet to herd a survivor into a corner if they’re injured so you can catch up and get a lunge onto them. Just keep playing her and you’ll get a feel for it! Sorry for the long post!
---
Short version: read survivor movements and make every hatchet count. 
---
i use source filmmaker (sfm), its a free software on steam
---
Some other game hopefully
---
It's a satire 
---
I hate ochido
---
Lots of bad things. 
---
Is it good? Worth buying pig for new surveillance? I've seen people try it out and say that it's mediocre so I settled with discordance.
---
how does it take skill? I play killer and i never pay attention to totems and i get it almost every game and i don't plan anything and get kills in endgame
---
May I ask why "Anti-Helen Keller"? Because while amused I don't get it. 
---
Is slugging irritating? Yes. But, it’s a play style. If your running into it often, bring Unbreakable. I feel your pain but it is something that is viable sadly. 
---
I stan you for this 
---
Perfection
---
Once I loaded into a one man game and the killer was a spirit. Only difference was she killed me.
---
Are you trying to imply people with down syndrome are stupid?
---
https://youtu.be/8aS5V05cO58
---
I’m pretty sure it masks your IP 
---
Feels bad bud. 
---
u can go up there too
---
&gt; Most games have an EULA. This basically states that you don’t own anything, you are licensing it from the creator. 
---
So?
---
The EULA says I can't sell my copy of the game. EU courts said that's a bullshit term years ago and that once a license is sold the buyer has the right to resell it, as they own the license.   
---
Steam's EULA said they don't do refunds. EU courts said fuck that. Now everyone gets refunds on Steam.
---
It's only enforceable if the courts decide to favour their interpretation of what is valid. The reason they put all that crap in there is to trick people into thinking they have no recourse, and to have something to point at in the 1 in a million chance it's ever challenged in court.
---
From a hag main: Monitor, nurses, make your choice and sloppy.
---
Am i the only one who likes him? His funny random moments montages are very entertaining. If you get him in your game, just grief him or face camp him lol
---
I wouldn't know because I don't know who that is. I had to google the name to even see the person face and know what show you were talking about.
---
Instead of immediately doing a gen wait a bit before you start it. Cleanse a totem or something. Or imagine if you were the killer, what would be your first stop on the map? Don’t go to obvious gens first unless you know it’s safe. Are you on the swamp map? Don’t go to the big boat or small boat first or the dock because those are hotspots for the killer to look first. 
---
Kenneth.  
---
Please.
---
So that’s why Jen always mocks him on stream. Human trash. 
---
Just wanted to say thanks for making this I am pretty out of the loop for streamers who play this game.
---
Not again, I guess No0by is next.
---
Hopefully someone will put it up on YT. 
---
Jesus, I thought he was just a bit toxic.
---
Start game.
---
Go to Main Menu.
---
Click "News".
---
Scroll down until you see latest patch notes.
---
Done.
---
Sorry, but I'm *sick* of the subreddit being swarmed with posts asking the same questions that you can answer yourself with 5 minutes of research.
---
Dude I'm 6'5", I need to cosplay a killer sometime.
---
lol. All the armchair lawyers in the chat. “You can sue them! Get a lawyer this is illegal!” No it isn’t, you fools. He’s banned, tough titty.
---
Justice for Ochido😡😡😡
---
So there's a fuse sound now?
---
Haven't been hit with one since the patch, lol.
---
You don't see any midriff there?
---
Doesn’t always pay off. But just remember every lobby is going to have someone new and those people are going to appreciate it. Don’t get hung up on the players that don’t appreciate it. We need more relaxed players on this community! Keep doing what your doing :) 
---
LOL, how long that take you to write white knight?
---
Pretty sure Whispers is still the best
---
Yup and if you look below this there is human trash defending human trash.
---
Sounds like the average Ochido fan, too similar for parody
---
He's a fucking pedophile why defend him, also he ban evaded when he went to PS4 which is literally against the terms of the game and will get him banned. No amount of outrage from his fans will change a thing
---
Yeah, he's one of those twelve-year-old followers that will believe everything he says. His arguments are basically nothing.
---
This is what I use Empathy for. Unlimited range on injured survivors. Let’s you know where the chase is, and you can also run to them to heal or be healed 
---
that glich isn't even that uncommon
---
Quick question, do you have proof he’s a pedophile? 
---
Oh dear, I hadn't seen this video - thanks for providing the source. It doesn't help that he doesn't seem to have any allies amongst fellow content creators. 
---
You're right about the vocabulary, after all each word exists with its own nuance. I was just worried that this was blind hate is all. Appreciate the info. 
---
Personally I don't understand why people go after No0b3 just as hard. Is there anything I should know there?
---
ikr, if this ain't hell, idk what is
---
🦀 OCHIDO IS GONE 🦀
---
No i mean in game. I haven't used her default outfit in ages lol
---
I can imagine him just walking up to The Legion and saying that and letting out a godly laugh
---
With Surveillance you can track multiple generators in different states without survivor requirements. Discordance needs two survivors working on the same gen and can just track two gens at the same time, which is very situational. It depends on whats your priority.
---
hmm let me make a post instead of looking st the top post on hot. 
---
If he gets a new account they can just ban him again
---
If he can't make money off of DBD anymore, he won't play it.
---
i think the only offense i find stupid that you can be banned for is ban evasion. imo if you are gonna play on another account and not cheat you should be allowed to play since you put more money into the game. but maybe that's just because i evaded a ban on counter-strike years back and now play it more than anything else without cheating ever since. (i was in 8th grade when i was banned). other than that he has done some shitty stuff, but idk if he exploited on ps4.
---
 I don't need you to respect me, I respect me
---
I don't need you to love me, I love me
---
But I want you to know you could know me
---
If you change your mind
---
Y tho
---
Its bullshit, but killers also suffer from it when they land a hit and the game doesn't register the hit.
---
Ahhhahahaaaaa dick head so happy he’s gone, switching to console doesn’t mean your are now unbanned and aloud to play.

---
Thank fucc for that, as a ps4 player i was scared to run into him online
---
So you mean you made the correct play and they were upset
---
I went back in his stream and saw his reaction fucking priceless

But its shitty and noone uses it for that exact purpose
---
Doctor flair checks out
---
I’m so confused like how does the killer know they have BPS
---
PS4 is clean now GG Devs 
---
Good riddance.
---
Standing up for someone like that only puts them in the same boat. Disgusting, hopefully twitch follows BHVR and bans him too.
---
Oh yeah that would be smart 
---
No one cares aboit his money, we just finally removed a cancer tumor
---
Unfortunately, all his fuckin' 12-year-olds are still gonna watch his YouTube videos, I guess. For some reason he still is so fucking popular...
---
Gates dont get powered because too many survivors waste time self caring instead of doing objectives. 
---
Yeah, I used to use it back when Legion was deemed the worst killer in the game. Now I refuse to. I prefer the knife ones anyway. The Ultra Rares are pretty meh
---
Nice job then, haha.
---
Ochido had good things going for him when he started the funny moments, wish he didn’t go down such a toxic path :(
---
Unfortunately, they can't unless he follows his god and uses some exploits. Don't understand how anyone with common sense will defend human trash.
---
no but they love a bit of ochido
---
You're welcome my guy.
---
Most he'd likely get is a refund for any money he has spent on the game.
---
Can't sue for lost potential revenue because then your getting into the legal fuck-zone of copyright law and fair use. Ain't now small time lawyer going to mess with that.
---
I assume No0b3 is getting lots of hate because he plays pretty toxic occasionally and is a troll every once in a while. But he isn't doing it mean-spirited like ochido does it and he isn't doing it all the time. 
---
I assume that another factor is that he, too has been banned twice as of now. Once for hacking legacy and other exclusive items he presumably lost during one of BHVR's mess-upsband once for reasons that I personally don't know
---
If you broke the rules and cheated then you hurt the playerbase and you deserve the punishment. Ban evasion avoids the punishment, which should be a bannable offense.
---
Not my video, but is anybody else experiencing this?
---
I hope your not serious, the man is literal cancer
---
That sucks
---
Fair enough, I didn't know about a lot of these transgressions. The video was pretty interesting too
---
Why did he get banned
---
I don't know much about his bans. Were the previous ones temporary or permanent? And is this one meant to be temporary or permanent?
---
Oink!!
---
Thats a basic perk loadout, i mean its nothing special
---
They are missing adrenaline haha
