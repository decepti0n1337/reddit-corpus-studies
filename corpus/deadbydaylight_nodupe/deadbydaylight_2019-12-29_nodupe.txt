Honestly, why would any killer play this mode when they know they would almost exclusively face sfw? Survivor queues on high ranks are already long, in this casual mode they would be unbearable, because killers will have a harder time there and absolutely no reward.
---
---
---
Borrowed time does not mean you must unhook me while the killer is in heartbeat range. You can you know, wait a little bit please? Meg, David, please? 
---

---
Oh guess I'm getting farmed again.
---
Yeah. We all died in the end bc he got a two person down while someone got unhooked. It was just odd because I cleared the corner while he got stuck in the room behind me and went down
---
Yes, message sent!
---
That sounds awful, that’s hasn’t happened but my controls get inverted sometimes when I get hooked
---
Nice meme format.
---
This games been out for fucking ages at this point. I’d imagine a good portion of the more regular players have most/all of the things on offer, thusly must people just can’t be fucked to use offerings since there’s no need
---
Yeah, not as wild as the other stuff on dbdgonewild. Suggestive but not wild.  
---
Honestly, I think the 5th panel is tame enough to be on this subreddit as well. It's not lewd. And I've seen similar things get posted here and not get modded or removed. You could probably post it, idk.  
---
Great art btw, you're really good at drawing. Your style is cute too. :D
---
\^ It's this one.
---
i feel bad for people who genuinely like this and the blue hair Feng. soo many toxic people use them and it gives people who just enjoy the skin a bad reputation
---
No Mither + Self Care + Solidarity + Second Wind you pleb. Adrenaline and unbreakable are actually great with no mither
---
Why? bc they play fortnite?
---
Yeah I've seen enough matches to know when that 1k can become a 3 or 4K real quick.
---
Faced an insidious leatherface the other day with some rank 9-15s solo queue. One went down, hooked in basement, the other two both ran in and promptly insta downed. All at 3 gens left. I did not get hatch.
---
We’re living in a simulation
---
A lot of Autohaven maps are pretty full of safe pallets and... a lot of them. Actually some of the best set ups in the game in terms of map rng I think resides in a lot of Autohaven maps. 
---
Blood lodge (an autohaven map), is probably considered the highest survivor sided map. If not, top 3
---
We have one, it’s called Mortal Kombat.
---
Nah only 2 gens need to be remaining if three survivors are alive I've opened hatch in this scenario
---
I’m pretty sure just posting here is allowed, and also I saw u a few mins ago lol I like your username
---
thanks. i mean i get that but i personally don't mind them too much. id take autohaven wreckers maps any day over some shit like Ormond
---
This is the right sub. Just make sure your idea is more original than previous ones. Not many people feel like reading a 10 minute long monologue about another shape shifter.
---
It's not a requirement but its a psuedo requirement. Essentially the algorithm will place your video lower and lower on the related content slots when you don't do this. Youtuber's have opened their stats before to show that their videos aren't just more successful in terms of views, it's substantial financial loss to NOT do this.  
---
More views and the value per ad when your content is approved and placed highly goes up. It's a massive difference and unfortunately unless YT changes the rules the creators gotta eat
---
But you don't recover from exhausted while you run though :0
---
Who's wearing a vest on a naked body to sleep?
---
Lol oh god. Tbf it can be hard to notice the little icon if you're not paying enough attention. It usually takes me a couple seconds and I'm thinking "wtf aren't you healing m-- OH, thanks!"
---
He means for the algorithm.
---
Yes, I've read about, and experienced that DBD console play is less accurate reguarding character movement, certain graphic details, and particular actions. The average gamer will play DBD better on PC than console because it was created for a keyboard and mouse experience, and not properly attuned to console gamepads/controller for 100% accuracy when it WAS ported.

---
Basically:
---
A couple patches ago, balanced landing and dead hard were by far the most popular exhaustion perks. This was because balanced landing had a reduced stagger no matter what, practically creating infinites and dead hard was a “free hit” perk which could save you a lot if used correctly. However, balanced landing got nerfed and is now more situational, whilst dead hard is “bugged” due to dedicated servers (a lot of the time you will get exhausted but still be hit etc). So these perks are no longer that popular.
---
We now only have three more exhaustion perks: lithe, head on and sprint burst. Lithe has always been frowned upon because you will most likely use it when you don’t need to (e.g. using it when just trying to loop some T or L walls). Head On was never a real contender in exhaustion perks because it didn’t actually give a sprint, and overall was not that good (just fun). 
---
Because of all of this, sprint burst was all we really have now for a reliable exhaustion perk which can be extremely useful. Due to being able to 99 your exhaustion, you can basically use it anywhere (much like dead hard but now for a big sprint) and youtubers have been popularising it as well (most notably AaronPlaysTV and Ussylis).
---
Thank you! Ye I felt so! Wasn’t sure how the community was into ships tho ... like some other games,  for example FNAF /  Rick and Morty  fandoms people cringe when you make anything mildly sexual.
---
Link info about this news?
---
this, its basically all we legion mains kinda need now since the button rework now doesnt force us to ruin our power
---
When they escape but the killer rgetd you: Left Behind
---
Had this once as surv and it predicted me to be sacrificed. It was right, duh
---
Yeah, it really depends on preference. I play Nurse mostly so Autohaven isn't bad, and some killers can average on it just fine. But i'd be lying if i didn't think autohaven maps are the easiest ones to play on for myself as a Survivor
---
Urban is an awesome perk imo. Just don't be an idiot and crouch everywhere.
---
If this ever gets added I’m Gona riot.
---
I wish I could talk to people like this via Xbox. Fuck them and their eNfoRcEmEnT aCtiOnS
---
Nahhh ur just a toxic Nea! &gt;:(
---
He is the mask though. That's part of what makes him so scary. A huge part of his horror is the fact that you question if he's even human. He's just this boogeyman in mask that never makes a sound. Even when Laurie stabbed his eye, he didn't make any noise. As soon as you show the face under the mask, it humanizes him and makes him less scary.
---
It pairs very well with Nemisis. You basically turn into a stealth killer for a 30 seconds after every time you smack your obsession, which, thanks to Nemisis, can happen very often.
---
If I had played "normal " as he put it , that would include getting looped for 5 gens and receiving a message "GG EZ baby killer ".
---
“Not another spirit main”
---
I personally don’t see an issue with it. I play on PC but with a controller. I’m a gamer who has issues with their hands and keyboard can be difficult for me after long periods of time. I have no issue reaching red ranks in survivor consistently and have only reached it once as a killer but tend to sit around 5/6. The skill gap isn’t that large. The biggest problem would probably be from frame rates. My friend has the game on their Xbox and my god it runs terribly.
---
It took all my will power not to downvote this when I first saw it
---
No, because there annoying
---
Yeah if you crouch the second the perk lights up they will not hear your tr
---
Lock and Glock: one locker has a glock in it with one round to go, stuns the killer for 5 sec each shot
---
Piggy back ride: jump on the killer to slow him down when carrying a survivor 
---
Medical License: with the help of another survivor, pick up a down survivor and run while also healing them slowly
---
I don’t like him but the thicc trapper still got me cracking up lmao
---
Yes I fully agree with you. I also think frame rates is the biggest difference and would love after they find some fix or dedicated servers and bring it on.
---
New perk: Fight or Flight.
---
I need this snow
---
&gt;:)))))))
---
Mine’s jojo
---
You need help.
---
Yea, and I hate getting all sweaty. If I realize early game it's a good swf I just start dicking off a little and not taking it seriously, as that would result in frustration.
---
I love me some potatoes!  
---
And thank you &lt;3
---
It's a joke ive broke nothing and I'm in a perfect state of mind I think
---
u_u &lt;3
---
I shoulda specified I meant when people message ME shit like that I wanna tip em to fucking shreds but I can't cause their pussies and report me
---
Does it not activate instantly once the doors are open? I have been educated
---
He’s my off killer when I want to play chill or farm, super easy to get tons of go with them. You practically can’t derail as legion since frenzy gives points in 3 of the 4 categories
---
I know, but you have to admit it would be a cool to see the killers we have come to like (and legion) duke it out
---
Only Susie needed a push to do it, but by now in the Entity's realm they likely all embraced the killing.
---
I walk really fast so that explains a lot.
---
:(
---
Oh same here , already been banned from sending messages before for losing my cool . What type of shit do you get from salty survivor mains ?
---
Crazy bunch of Gatekeepers. I hate you
---
Stabby gang enjoys this very much, love the stylistic mask
---
?
---
You have to injure, down and hook a survivor to get 4 seconds of aura reading when someone is further than 40 something metera away and is not in a locker. I wouldn't call that free tbh. It requires you to actually do things instead of having it given to you. If bbq is a clutch perk then every perk is.
---
Unlock the door, hook the survivor, exit blocks anyone from leaving for 60 seconds and you see the aura of anyone in the exit place. Great perk for endgame
---
What r u saying
---
*enters the bathroom*
---
*turn around*
---
*Puts trap in front of door*
---
Enjoy
---
how? why do you just assume they are annoying? There is already a huge audience of people who are not of age to play this game.
---
No one had an issue when people like Markiplyier, Vanoss, H20, Dawko, ect play the game, and they have HUGEEEE child audiences
---
I thought it was the red arrows but that's annoying too
---
Yea but they also have a teen audience
---
Tru3 is weird, he gets obnoxious and very annoying somtimes. but people seem to either love him or hate him, there seems to be no middle ground
---
wHy tHe FuCk YoU kEep TuNneLing Me
---
It's like dude. I saw pink hair behind that tree tell ur dumb ass friends to be stealthier.
---
And I'm a pig main so a lot of times if I kill them all they'll be like "what the fuck we booped ur snoot and u didn't let us go"  like dude... I only do that when it's a dwight not a fucking 4 man SWF of all blendettes
---
It would be much better if he was carrying an Electric Straight Long Grinding Machine Ggs 27 L Bosch - 500 Watts 220 Volts widely utilized by industries and metallurgy professionals, besides engine rectifiers for headstock cleaning.
---
Adrenaline requires all gens done. Its no different both sides have stupid arguments.
---
By their logic if I cave in their skull with my weapon they should all let me kill them , wtf
---
Hes a Fortnite streamer and was number 1 on Twitch before he made a deal with Mixer and set himself up for life with a bucket of money.
---
Search for "Gatekeeping"
---
Yeah, I've gotten red rank on survivor myself, though not rank 1 any time recently.  So I play the decent to the hard core.
---
Skill is like a pyramid where the large base of the pyramid is occupied by noobs and mediocre players.  The middle level is is maybe half the size of the base and these are the good players. While the top should be just the great/elite players.
---
In DBD the smallest portion of the pyramid is rank 20-15 or so and not a lot of people are in this group.  This group has the most capacity to improve because they are generally really fresh to game and don't know much and/or just haven't practiced much.  
---
The next group is maybe 20% (guessing) of the game at ranks 11-15.) ranks making a still relatively small middle.  They're still learning/practicing but would shit all over on most rank 16s-20. 
---
Then the last portion is probably 75% of the game being rank 1-10 and they get mixed together.  Some have thousands of hours and others, like you said have maybe 100.  Some have essentially mastered the game while some are still relative noobs ("Huntress is singing, she must be 5 feet from me so I better hide").  
---
People's ranks should be based on their all time scoring so that it increases as they learn to play but flattens out at some point when they reach their personal skill cap.  This would limit the great players from interacting too much with lower skilled players unless they got on a smurf account.
---
You would be defaulted to play at your rank (maybe +or- 3 ranks) but then you could implement a system to increase that range for match making by additional +or- 3 rank increments.
---
What do you mean by pgtw
---
Thanks for the clarification. That clears up what happened in some of my previous games
---
its alright, The processor is good enough but the graphics card seems to be lacking, the ram also its kinda sus to me
---
Boi
---
MAYBE!
---
Was anyone else confused while reading this?...
---
The only person who should be running urban evasion is Jane. You know why B)
---
gg
---
This is very true. I really didn't think about this well enough... :D
---
pop goes the weasel. Gen regression by 25% for 40/50/60 seconds after hook
---
it’s the old switch to killer menu icon, like after you had picked survivor you just chose that instead of backing out to main to change, sucks they removed it because it was quicker to dump bp between surv and killer blood webs
---
I love this perk so much. It’s so situational but when it works, it works
---
please no, Killers already get enough BP compared to survivors. And i really just dont want more people using one of the most boring perks to go against
---
If a report reason does not appear in the list, it does not exist.
---
Yeah. I like it cause it look cute and neas cosmetics look soooo comfy
---
Entitycopter comes flying by and drops them off
---
Yea, I get what you mean, but organized teams will crank gens out really fast. Stealth Myers is viable, it's just almost impossible to pull off if you're going against really optimized survivors.
---
100% agree! It’s amazing how many people play this game with the goal to be toxic and piss people off, instead of trying to enjoy the game for what it is, and let everyone have fun.
---
Lmao ok buddy
---
You guys mean Susie?
---
The people to use the basic attack need to be banned to
---
I got communication banned for a day for saying “get fucked camper”. The context was killer was camping me so 2 other survivors used a key to open hatch and escape
---
I had this but with survivor the ui bugs are unbearable
---
wait so your telling me... Low rank players are bad?1?! who would have thought
---
Here's a guide I've put together for the perk "Wake Up!". If you have any suggestions on perks I should do next let me know! Also suggestions on how I can improve these guides would be great!
---
I played myself. I always think her name is Sally instead of Susie. 🤦
---
 Pretty sure it's this one V
---
As you're playing against and with people every match is different. As a survivor the killer can rally make an impact especially when trying to figure out who it is.
---
There have been times when you think the killer isn't about hit Myers or ghostface have been watching you from.a distance and are about to tear your ass wide open.
---
The game is what you make it basically. If you cant see beyond "oh it's just doing generators" then the game is not for you.
---
There are many roles to fill especially as a survivor and you just gotta figure out which gameplay style suits you. Are you the gen jockey or the guy that challenges the killer to a game of cat and mouse?
---
How is pop more boring than corrupt or ruin, well maybe ruin cause it last 5s, well at least you got the idea is more about the emblem system and bp’s than actual gameplay.
---
It lets you change your obsession I guess. But Nemesis does that better. Deep wounds doesn't any more, but maybe reverse bear traps go down when they're not in your terror radius? I can't remember, they've been changed so many times.
---
It's an interesting perk that I'm sure will have a niche janky build some day, but currently I don't think it exists so it just looks like an oddball.
---
He likes to say a lot of stuff is OP, i think its to the point to where he understands what OP means, but instead of saying powerful he just says OP by accident.
---
if you watch his streams he says it a lot
---
How is pop more boring than corrupt or ruin, well maybe ruin cause it last 5s, well at least you got the idea is more about the emblem system and bp’s than actual gameplay. Most people saying this would make it op lmao.
---
this popular person I don't like plays a game I play, waaaa
---
Sitting in McLean's stream the other day and asking questions about these things got a lot of answers and acknowledgement that these are indeed factors in the game they have to consider and have worked to mitigate.
---
Guess that means it's not just whining and in fact has a basis that the Devs acknowledge and try to fix.
---
So maybe I'm not such a whiny baby as you put it but you're just a moron who can't think critically.
---
And it's really hard to ask the community for explanations to things I already understand given the amount of time I've played the game and the amount of time I've watched it be streamed by people with just a few followers to people with thousands of followers.  From toxic streamers to educational streamers.
---
But when your brain is small and you can't think outside a very tiny box, I guess the only conclusion *you* can come to when it comes to objective criticisms of the game is someone must be a whiny pussy.  Perhaps developing some critical thinking and reasoning skills would help you a little.  Good luck with that.
---
"Fortnite man will ruin dbd" yes, definitely, I'm not making a mountain out of a mole hill
---
Camping its playing the game too ,  tunneling is also playing the game,  Mori-ing someone because their teammates wont stop trying to flashilght-save him os also playing the game.
---
And the killer is Myers!
---
No mither +self care+second wind + inner strengh OP?
---
Yeah, Sally is Nurse. =)
---
i swear he uploads any game he wins.
---
watched one of his videos called something like "countering the spirit over and over" (this was before the changes) and i counted his chase time from when the chase music started till it ended. 
---
he, no shit, got chased for 20~ secs the ENTIRE game, and still died.
---
Urban Immersion isn't that bad tho...
---
I assume just because as a killer/predator there's more opportunities than survivors/prey get. If a killer feels bullied to me I'll usually give them a death hook on me. Like run up and stand there motioning for them to "come here".
---
That's the best I can think of doing. If you have other ideas on how I can be nice to you let me know!
---
That’s not so bad. Are you expecting every player to be the exact same level? You’d be waiting half the day for a single match.
---
Nerf survivor and op killer addons
---
Its a well deserved reputation
---
But he is almost always red ranks
---
I'm not saying adrenaline is a glutch perk either
---
It is the best exhaust perk in the game, its not OP but its the closest exhaust perk to being OP
---
It'd be cool if the mori was all of them killing you the way they did with the janitor of their lore.
---
This has been doing on for the last week though. Red ranks always bm so I have to be toxic and they get mad at that
---
I have had plenty of positive things happen from it (not just increased views) specifically great conversation and formation of friendships.
---
Check the ranks.
---
For me as killer I go against 4 red ranks so of course they’re good and it makes the game hard with the low-mid tier killers.
---
As survivor the games are hard because I’ll either have low ranks who are slow on gens and cant work through ruin, or I’ll get a rank 16-20 who will get tunneled out within the first minute essentially making it a 3vs1
---
The matchmaking really fucking sucks
---
and ninja doesnt?

I do it simply to let people know I am broadcasting the game. If people are petty enough to see that and assume I am gonna play toxic or dc (and plenty of people do assume this) then that says more about them than about me. I literally just want to play a video game that I enjoy, and have fun!
---
Corrupt is never annoying, Ruin is easy to work through.
---
Pop is litterally just removes progress on a gen, its legit just "oh hey ik you love holding m1 and doing nothing for 80 secs, why dont we turn that into 110+ secs!"
---
I dont have an issue with it getting extra BP, but its kinda a slap in the face for survivors who have been deprived of BP since launch.
---
Ya that's what I thought (I worded it very very weirdly), was confused why this guy says you cant
---
I dont really like his opinions, like when he says he thinks Wraith might be bettwr than Ghostface. Lmao like okay, he only says that because he's a really good killer, better than most Id say. I only watched him for his tactics abd strategies for killer because he does actually have some good thoughts when it comes to mindgames, looping and map control.
---
Cannibal for his BBQ &amp; Chilli perk. It will make levelling up so much easier once you unlock the teachable
---
Next is Hag for Ruin. It is mandatory to slow the early game down towards higher ranks
---
Then whatever killer appeals to you. Personally, I recommend Myers, Oni or Spirit as I find them fun to play. Myers costs real money but Spirit and Oni can be unlocked with shards
---
Was in the patch notes from when oni got added, in the section about changes from his ptb
---
Which killer is coming with your chapter
---
Today I was actually hit DURING my dead hard animation, i might post the clip but idk if it'll get removed for oversatured content and i'll need to edit out like 5 other mins.
---
Needless to say it was the first time i actually got hit *during* the animation and not just before.
---
Then you honestly need to re-evaluate your life choices.
---
GROOVY
---
why would i use an offering? all of the survivors offerings are worthless unless you are doing certain builds with a SWF.
---
and i refuse to use good BP offerings till double BP
---
Freddy is a very good killer, the only issue is his perks are either niche or not good at all: he has a teleport, add-ons that can slow the game down, and can make looping tough with his snares or trick survivors with fake pallets.
---
Yeah,your right
---
Ikr, I wish they made it so the killer can't tell if you're injured if you have NM on. Kinda defeats the purpose of it that it screams "pick me up!". I guess that has benefits in its own right though, since killers will think twice before slugging the entire team.
---
&gt; The game is designed and balanced around everyone bringing an item and offering
---
So tell me why toolboxes and keys are so OP
---
Anarchy might be a little powerful but otherwise this would be sick
---
Knocks down a Survivor who just got unhooked then picks them up 30 seconds later and gets DS’d: “she has DS as well yeah this is definitely a SWF”
---
He complains about “gen rush” in short games when he loses but then complains when Survivors try to synergise perks and use different builds that don’t involve “gen rushing”
---
God I can’t even watch anymore. I used to watch his stuff religiously when I got into the game but it shows now how much he despises having to play it, no matter if he says otherwise.
---
Really not a fan of the 'get injured then immediately run to a corner and self care' playstyle lol
---
&gt;be tru3
---
&gt;make a dozen mistakes, respect pallets, mindgame poorly, slug greedily and ineffectively
---
&gt; "GUYS, we played PERFECTLY and we're still losing"
---
I stopped watching when that became almost every game.
---
Who fucking cares
---
Just use common/yellow offerings. They're everywhere in the bloodweb and you gain the BP back from using them, its just free BP
---
No, he doesn’t
---
Maybe the Halloween one? The Shape is a really fun killer to play
---
She actually seems like a Sally seeing how shy and childish she is.
---
When Sprint Burst activates and you clash into surrounding objects.
---
Fuck campers that wanna camp me all because I’m good at looping
---
Speed Boost were the second best add-on line, the best being range.
---
If you ran at least the Prototype Claw, your speed penalty was gone while one person was in transition. What made it really good was that if you could transition several people at the same time, the speed boost stacked so you were really quite fast.
---
Blocks were good, but that route was more for minimizing the negative effects of Freddy's power rather than amplifying the strong aspects. Running blocks messed with your memorization of your invisibility windows, reduced the duration of speed add-on bonuses, and meant you lacked the time to catch up with somebody for an instant hit if you used range add-ons.
---
If you wanted Blocks to work, you had to stack them, which means you have pathetic sleep range.
---
https://i.imgur.com/nDXNpXN.png

Nobody mentioned any of those. Seems like someone is projecting.
---
As a rank 3 survivor, confirm. Most of my matches are vs ranks 10-7, matchmaking is doing it's job
---
Basically you could get ahead of someone who was about to get hooked and hide behind them during the hooking animation. The killer would auto hit the hooked survivor if they tried to swing and the hider could get a free unhook (using BT) during the wipe animation. Smart killers, however, would not swing thereby occupying half the survivors by just waiting while one is on hook and the other is sitting there and your emblems wouldn't go down either.
---
I personally recommend the spark of madness if you are on PC. As feng and Doctor are two of the best starting characters for new players. Feng has great starting survivor perks and doctor''s power helps you learn how survivors move. 
---
If you are console and have them then stranger things chapter is great because of Nancy she is the second best starting survivor because of her perks. 
---
Across both get the leather face dlc for BBQ which is arguably the best killer perk in the game. Honestly leather face has one of the best perk builds of any killer even if he is seen as weak by a lot of players. 
---
I'd also recommend the Halloween DLC as  it is a ton of fun to play as myers.
---
Yeah, if its 6 ranks within, that just makes rank not matter.
---
This is why I watch Ohmwrecker. Yes, I know he’s not the best. At least he’s not toxic, he doesn’t use crazy looking thumbnails, and he has fun in a way that doesn’t make the game any less fun for everyone else.
---
"LOOK WHO'S SHITTING IN THE TALL GRASS"
---
"HMM YEAH THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S ME BABY"
---
Based on a true story between two Ashs
---
That must be really exciting.
---
I really wish they would add a "no swf" gamemode to balance it
---
Bubba is already in MK c:
---
it cost more to get those offerings in the bloodweb then they actually give you, also why do you care? you dont gain extra BP from my offerings with very few exceptions
---
I like how mondays an ebony
---
Im just here to spread the hate on Doctor, Hags who know what they’re doing and The Spirit. As a survivor main I don’t really dislike any survivors.
---
Mondays suck
---
Had a 3 man streamer swf today, they all managed to die and hardly did any gens, even without ruin or any slow-downs on a map like mother's dwelling. I was wondering how so. Checked the stream after the match. Two of them were constantly selfcaring in the corner of the map. With sloppy butcher. Wich literally took as long as doing a gen. Self care indeed is a killer perk. Helped me a lot.
---
I wish David would drill my manpusy up against a pallet as daddy Myers watched 😫😫
---
overcharge on freddy
---
&gt; all the gens
---
&gt;gens
---
Happening to me a lot on xbox. I don't mind it, there's a lot of obviously new players but I do get rage when those new players take you off the hook the moment the killer turns their back... 
---
I know you dont know any better but my god... leave me alone.
---
Also the killers tunnel at those stages and you can tell the newer survivors are afraid to move due to that... gens don't get done.
---
i just made a small fix I just released version 4.1 there are some addons that didn't work well

My best Hag moment so far was me running Cracked Eggshell for duration/Mindgames.
---
Put a trap on one side of a jugle gym pallet.
---
Later chase a Ace into it. He drops the pallet with me on one side and the triggered trap on another. He thinks I would instantly teleport so he vaults it. I miss the grab cause of dedicated servers he vaults back to my trap and thinks again that I would instantly teleport and vaults back to me. I smack him down already laughing like crazy....then he DC'ed and I was crying.
---
I wish I could have recorded.
---
*laughs in vroom vroom*
---
Ha. I worked on the UK dvd and digital release for that film. Love Art and Terrifier 2 is on the way.
---
Although he probably wouldn't have a terror radius as he's a mime.
---
Yes
---
Perfect answer, however it is opened for much longer then 3 seconds when a key is used
---
You seem to be well liked with dour negative 25 karma.
---
This happened to me with Freddy, Got the offering on Hag. Why would I want to use an offering and use no perks when I can just switch killer lol
---
She sounds like this when you mori her too lmao (I main thicc brick and boy oh boy do the killers love the thicc brick)
---
With difficulty.
---
dont be red rank use green mori and his power should cover the rest of the emblems
---
To find inner strength you must first find inner peace then the path will be open
---
Why you getting downvoted lol it's a legit question
---
You wiggle on me, I give you to the entity
---
to be fair, he does sometimes upload videos where he loses, but only if he can blame something else to show the imbalances he sees in the game, they're never games where he says he lost because he got outplayed. His team sucked, the build he was given was bad, they were snipers, bad map, the survivors used a key, etc.
---
I had that against a tunneling myers going for me  and i had ds i had to tap gens the survivors were looking at me like i was autistic
---
Because youre a baby killer
---
Ghostface is very fun :)
---
PS4 player here, tag is lymejusa. Looking for 2-1 people to fill up a squad. I run a prestige 1 level 23 Ash. Casual player looking for some fun and laughs. Rank 10
---
Well, im a Legion Main and something that might make people complain about its how annoying you can be, its like a Mosquito in the room while you're sleeping,  it doesnt do much,  but annoys you,  for example,  you enter on frenzy and hit someone,  go to another survivor, and most of the time in my games at least is like "Oh look, Little Jane has just finished healing with his medkit...well fuck you now you're injured again go find a Teammate B*tch "  
---
(This comment won't trigger another Legion nerf....Right?)
---
Pd:Sorry if the english is bad
---
I use to like Tru until I realized all he does is make excuses, I can't stand anyone like that.
---
I also have made a ticket, and they have said to try and resinstall EAC but I dont know how
---
Me fucking too 👁👄👁
---
Something needs to be done. The killer needs a boost against swf, but not solo queue.
---
When you realize the anime kid isnt fucking around anymore
---
Just doing the usual amount of clickbsit, what's the deal?
---
For an indie game by a relatively small studio DbD has surely attracted one hell of a toxic community. Like, you can almost always expect a cesspool in big games like Overwatch but DbD's is fucked up on the whole another level.
---
Looks like the second one had enough of the first one, am I right fellas?
---
First off look at my flair do you honestly think that I'm a "toxic survivor main" no I'm a billy/nea main

I am a simple man, I like stabbing survivors so I choose legion. I like making survivors scream so choose doctor.  I like setting shit on fire in world of warships so I use British battleships. 
---
Side note, really sucks when people think I'm tunneling just because I went back to the hook after seeing them run there, and then I down both the unhooked and the unhooked and one of them dcs. I just wanna smack you.
---
Lord of the hooks 
---
The two ashes.
---
I was just joking :(
---
And for that reason, I'm out.
---
Yes, i said that, but ignoring freddy and bubba, no one from dbd has been in a fighting game, so I thought it would be a cool idea to make a fighting game with the original dbd killer (non licensed)
---
im a survivor main but thanks
---
I wish Legion's default masks were this cool instead of lame.
---
This picture is all I’ve ever needed, thank you.
---
What an interesting argument. You make a great point!
---
i do think if the survivors escaped with a key he can complain about that since its one of the most frustrating things in the game, but everything else is kinda... dumb
---
If it has arrows in it the kids will be magically absorbed into it now all’s missing is a red circle
---
Well what a THICCCC and fog day,  Jane who got her ass eaten by the Hag
---
Hey buddy make your own rant post, bc I really don’t give a f*ck. Don’t force other people (who may have had to wait 20+min for a match) to farm. It’s that simple.
---
I usually try hitting the wall a couple times while shaking the camera in a "no" motion. If they continue, they get the hook.
---
Found the guy thats never played killer
---
*moans* I wish legion would just feral frenzy my manpussy to get it ready for David to dead hard into me 👅👅
---
I don’t think you fully grasp the concept of a “rant” my friend.
---
He had a game yesterday where the survivors won I guess (can’t recall if they all escaped) and he was talking about how he played perfectly and couldn’t have done anything better, and when the chat started brainstorming things he could’ve done differently, he dismissed everything they said because he’s just so good at the video game.
---
I agree the game is survivor sided but him acting like he plays perfectly and he’s the best player in the world (because you’d have to be the best player to play perfectly all the time) gives the game a bad rep because he makes people think that mediocre survivors can’t lose to an amazing killer. Barf.
---
I really appreciate Noob3 because of this. He’s pretty funny, shows some good gameplay and you can tell he really tries with his edits. Very light on the clickbait nonsense too.
---
oh no its actually p decent, just the way people use it makes me want to hang myself!
---
Sounds like a good method
---
As a killer main, it's mostly neas and fengs. They are usually the ones that try to expose teammates and feel like their helping the team by trying to lure me away into a long loop, but in reality they just gimp their team, most of the time their in bright skins, like that hair one for feng. I have also been having severe dislike with most of the cold wind maps, since I have been getting into Michael and the corn is my enemy.
---
I had a stroke looking at this
---
Happened to me once. I was a rank 15 killer going against a full team of red ranks
---
For real lmao
---
I don't get the reference
---
That literally something that goes against everything XD, it easier if you know what you do is practical in any situation! Especially Hostage Situations!
---
its one of those perks that only works if you are running a certain build.
---
its p good when used with a set of perks that work well with it, but without it, yea its shit
---
Great idea lemme just throw my rank in the garbage and wait an entire game to be passive-aggressive in chat. Idc if they farm just don’t farm me.
---
they will, the terror radius doesn't go to 0 instanly, it decrese slowly
---
Got over 100 hours as killer.
---
[removed]
---
just play better 4head
---
Nah that’s just the entity
---
"Viable killers outside of Ghostface and Wraith? I cant even think of any."
---
Actual quote
---
Ikr, when I play killer my first goal is to have fun, it's not a competitive game so I don't treat it like one. Only time I play to win is if it's a SWF playing to win.
---
I’m a legion main as well and it can be annoying. I just don’t think it requires him to be nerfed all the time.
---
Unbreakable and DS are used just as often as adrenaline (in my personal experience). 
---
So I kinda gave up using them (but not forever) and started using perks that I can make use more often in the match. This also changes my playstyle and makes me learn new stuff about survivor gameplay.
---
Why am I saying all that stuff? No clue, but maybe it could inspire the guy reading to try something new and maybe something original, I don't know. Just have in mind that when you take those perks off, you're gonna end up needing them and regretting everything (This happens every gosh-darn time).
---
Yes, even though they have made a change to their ranking system, many players(including myself) are mismatched with survivors who do not share the same level of skill and experience. Coordinating an escape against an experienced killer with...not so good survivors is very hard.
---
OK who is that guy XD and what did he do to Bill?
---
she gettin raptured
---
That last part was suspiciously specific
---
Its annoying to see people missing out on those BP refunds lol
---
Happened to me. I was the survivor.
---
You didn't do THAT bad, points wise
---
Her mask is the bloodweb
---
Not gonna lie you can tell it’s bull if he’s calling dead hard OP
---
fuck oni.
---
I suppose BHVR were beginning to run out of ideas for perks. 
---
The whole perk rooster for GF was useless initally;
---
Before the Im All Ears buff it only worked on survivors outside the killers T.R effectively making it a literal useless perk.
---
Thrilling Tremors was originally designed to as a poor quality aura perk to highlight survivors who came in contact with the obsession. This was briefly shown in the steam description of Ghostface before it was changed to the current Thrilling Tremor effect.
---
I suppose they created Furtive chase to utilise their new obsession change mechanic as it was around that time period where BHVR implemented the new design of changing obsession throughout the match. The Perks effect I suppose was their attempt of creating a perk that provided stealth during chases but it completely misses the mark. 
---
It was useful until Nemesis came on to the seen for changing the obsession and did have some uses on Obsession based builds but this is now obsolete as Nemesis is significantly better at changing the obsession.

ACE IN THE HOLE IS EXCELLENT :(
---
Because the rift got delayed one week and you still got the experience you earned in that week as comprehension I started the rift at tier 12... Now I am finished at tier 70 since a week with all challenges completed and don\`t know what to do for another 10 days.
---
Killers
---
1) Clown: Usually a boring game because he has no pressure and I feel safe to gen rush if he’s in a chase.
---
2) Ghostface: Only because the reveal mechanic is real wonky on both sides, it’s kind of sad.  Sometimes I reveal GF and I’m like not even really looking at him, and other times I can’t reveal him even if I’m looking directly at him
---
3) Hag: when popping a trap your camera snaps towards the decoy and during a chase that quick camera snap can mean death.
---
Survivors
---
1) Claudette: Usually are blendettes who try to be immersive and are generally unfit to play with/against
---
2) Kate: Most Kate’s I go against are usually potatoes and they don’t provide much challenge
---
3) Tapp: Same reason as Kate most Tapps I’ve faced are complete potatoes
---
Levels
---
I only hate levels when they spawn in god loops that basically force a killer to abandon chases in certain spots because they will lose the game if they chase a survivor in said loop.
---
Items
---
1) Styptic Agent add on:  most people who use this couple it with BT, MOM or DH to extend chases and I hate it
---
2) Flashlights: only the toxic uses of them.  
---
3) Sabo Toolboxes: leave my hooks alone!
---
Offerings
---
1) Ebony Moris: Cool the killer is going to tunnel and proxy camp his hooks to kill ppl nice.
---
2) Shroud of separation, doesn’t separate survivors that much honestly.
---
3) Splinter: just because they’re hidden, makes people think they’re moris.
---
The universe thinks it’s funny. After four games in a row today with coordinated red ranks. I finally get a sloppy team who let two people die on hook. Sigh. The gods that be are absolute smartasses.
---
What you talking about? Pfff.... These internet troll man, but yeah you know what they say, there is no crime, if you leave no witnesses! I have definitely not a warranty out for me or something, bountesy arnt real these days, I am worth nothing, not even 3400€!
---
To be fair as survivor yeah you can’t get that sweet 32k but I was more about the emblem part since destruction is a weird one you can get all Iri and have silver dest... this actually encourage a lot more the kick and if you want to kick gens you can’t stay around hooks, and the 80s from gens is a really short amount of time but I’ve seen how frustrating it is to nearly finish a gen and pop just do it’s thing in a solo scenario, thanks. I’ll disagree with the corrupt but is about luck for some reason I always spawn in the corner with all the gens block so... it bother me more than pop.
---
Devs. Please.
---
Agreed, although I am kinda in the middle ground personally. Used to watch his stream but I don’t anymore. He is pretty knowledgeable about the game, but does make some wild assumptions about the people he plays against.
---
OP
---
Well spoken.
---
I don't even use blue hair Feng anymore (the mask one anyways) just because I end up getting facecamped.
---
Besides blonde Feng is my new bestie.
---
What?
---
No mither + self care + lucky break + object of obsession.
---
There is a button that inverts the camera so you may accidentally be hitting that. On PS4 it is the touch pad on xbox one it's whatever the back button equivalent is. I'm not sure what it is on PC.
---
the issue isnt getting the 32k its the fact that killers have a meta perk that doubles there BP every game, while survivors have nothing
---
The game you linked where the survivors are using a Sabo build poorly, was a SWF group that purposely deranked to face off against weaker killers.
---
They are 100% toxic. They manipulated the matchmaking and ranking system to purposely face less experienced killers for their own fun.
---
What sort of people are you trying to defend? And what does that say about you?
---
The Nemesis and PWYF combo work really well on killers like plague so I would keep that combo. The ability to insta-down survivors or vomit on them until they are injured with 125% movement speed will make you unstoppable and will actually make survivors consider to cleanse.
---
The build you have suggested is pretty strong. You could swap out ruin for Corrupt as plague benefits from corrupt in that she can vomit on gens. 
---
Putting on PGTW instead of Thana allows you to defend gens more effectively during the end-game. Thana is good for keeping a consistent debuff on sick survivors but PGTW is more tactical in that you have more control over gen progression. 
---
Overall a very strong build. If you manage PWYF correctly this build could potentially be unstoppable in the right hands.
---
I thought Monday said your balls were going to drop
---
Eh the people who say the 'ol "she your main because you a try hard that only plays the best killers."
---
Heard a couple times in some of DbD discord servers.
---
Don't worry I've got psychopathic tendencies according to experts. I may have a bounty of $5000 for me, maybe I'll turn myself in
---
And not a single one at red ranks
---
It's for work. We're dropping 20,000 bouncy balls from the ceiling.
---
Continue assuming.
---
You know what, let's criss cross and we turn each other in and split the money 💵💸💰🤑
---
That's a damn good question but I didn't get notified for it so sorry I'm late.
---
I don’t know about dedicated servers but anything’s better that killers McDonald’s WiFi, lest we lose any more survivors being claimed by the entity by ascending through the ceiling. Rip Nancy.

Funny, I main her and I think they’re probably salty that pallets and jukes won’t work against good Nurses who predict and cut into your path. Had a guy taunt me on a roof only for me to blink up and down him. Besides, your timing has to be just right.
---
I love this
---
I am gonna disagree only newbies use bbq unless is 2x bp event or something but yeah survivors waste a lot of resources if they want to get more bp’s(We are gonna live forever, etc.) I guess it is to balance the fact that killers don’t have skill checks? Maybe is cause of that.
---
You get what you fucking deserve
---
Ah
---
Dark Devotion pairs fairly well with Nemesis. 
---
Nemesis will prevent the obsession from hearing the T.R you have given them meaning they will be left unaware that you have the perk. 
---
Dark Devotion now grants Undetectable status meaning your Red light is now hidden. 
---
You could use this to chase the obsession after initially hitting them as tracking the killer without a red light is significantly harder than normal and it can also allow you to do some pretty strong moves with insta-down killers like plague or Bubba.
---
He's very divisive. To me, he probably complains more than any streamer I've ever watched, and I'm not really interested in listening to that.

Self care, head on, adrenaline ,  deliverance

OP??
---
Ash WAS easy when Mettle of Man gave out free health states
---
Continue being objectively wrong
---
He needs to stop
---
IDK about this.zz
---
But I did have an idea for a racing game with all the killers and survivors!  I'd call it "Kart by Daylight"!
---
Wanna know how I got these scars?
---
*character breaks* I bullied a killer in DBD and got fucking owned for it.
---
Why did he give Trapper such a fat ass?
---
Definitely feel that Blue Hair Feng vibe. Sometimes I switch to  the Lunar hair (my second favorite) just because of the chance that I'll get tunneled if I don't.

This was the best post on reddit that I’ve seen in a while
---
Admittedly 50/50 for me. I've had some people literally go 'everyone in my twitch is laughing at you jajajaja' post-game (all two of their viewers, one of which is their SO), but also I've checked people's streams and they're cool. I still think it's a massive 'kick me' sign, and you even see streamers bully 'twitchies'.
---
don't camp, unless you see another survivor right around them. I 50/50 killer and survivor and it sucks. You'll never rank up if you camp, cause your wasting time while they're rushing the gens
---
It always pains me watching Console Killers. I feel so bad that consoles get stuck with probably *the WORST* analog-controls ever. It feels so stiff and clunky.
---
What type of mask is Susie wearing?
---
I haven’t cleansed one of your ruin totems for 3 days.
---
New player here, what are rift fragments and what purpose do they serve in-game?
---
It's not really an issue, the running into the wall was my fault not the controllers
---
Hes only playin against rank 10+ killers lol
---
Console’s OG unbreakable
---
I wasn't really trying to camp, it was a mixture of indecisiveness on which gen to go to and trying to get a kick out of effectively using stalker, but I'll try to move around more next time. Thanks
---
I legit haven't played in 4 months and started yesterday
---
Because I thought I'd switch it up a bit and bring Haunted Grounds instead *mwahaha*
---
Intresting idea, but im having trouble thinking on how you would convert a horror survival game to a racing game, I suggested fighting because it changes the perspective from a horror game, but allows it to keep the intense heart pumping action with violence to spare
---
Joker in the Pennywise one, “And as far as Mr. King goes, I’m a shining man, Wink!”
---
I get they're clickbait thumbnails, but i'll go out of my way not to watch them if they insist on being this hard on the clickbait.
---
Continue being ignorant because you think a perk designed to slow the survivor's objective that's easily counterable is overpowered
---
I love legion because of his aesthetic, it fits the heavy metal playlists I listen to while playing lol
---
aww who hurt you?
---
Nobody said it's overpowered. You can go now. You're embarrassing to even be around.
---
Killers:
---
Huntress - Most overplayed killer currently and the hitboxes are so broken that you can’t even mindgame hatchets anymore. Basically just feels like RNG whether you’ll get hit or not. 
---
Ghostface - Second-most overplayed killer and countering his power is extremely inconsistent, thus not fun to play against. Also seems like *most* people who play him, do so in a scummy playstyle 
---
Hag - Not as common as the other two, but when someone does play her, 95% of the time, they proxy camp the first hook or just wait for someone to unhook and teleport back. Every time. Bonus when they have Make Your Choice. Can’t remember the last time I had a fun game against Hag.
---
Survivors:
---
Claudette - basically just the blendette version. As killer, I like to make sure I hook everyone at least once (seems fair, plus BBQ stacks) and I swear the Blendette will continue to urbanly evade even when the rest of their team is on death hook, yet they haven’t taken any agro from the killer. Just annoying to search for them all the time.
---
Masked Meg - Generally trying to play toxic, usually have a flashlight. Sometimes it works in my favour, since they are following me around instead of doing gens. But can still be very annoying when trying to have a fun game.
---
Ash - His face is stupid.
---
Maps:
---
Mount Ormond - so hard to follow scratch marks as killer, and don’t really love the map as survivor either.
---
Shelter Woods - honestly this map is just incredibly dull. 
---
Gas Heaven - this map SHOULD be fine, but for some reason I just hate it, no matter if I am playing killer or survivor. It just rarely seems to go well for me on this map. 
---
Items and Offerings kinda just depend on the round but I am running out of time so stopping here.
---
If I remember correctly, the game actually worked that way a long time ago. I think 2k was safety pip, 3k is 1 pip and 4k was 2 pip.
---
How can i teach other chars perks from another one? IM so lost with the game xD
---
Nancey: aight imma head out...
---
MFW you realize Blood Echo isn't just a bunch of samurai dudes.
---
Why would it need to be nerfed if it wasn't overpowered?
---
Im sorry, so sorry
---
Exactly! I honestly don’t care about how many kills I get. Just wanna have a fun game. Even in a SWF, don’t care if I die. Just want to enjoy the round and help my team accomplish whatever goal they need.
---
It’s happened to me a few times. So far It’s made all the killers DC, but I’d hate to have a standoff where neither the killer or the afflicted survivor want to DC.
---
At levels 30, 35 and 40 on both killers and survivors an orange version of one of their starter perks will appear. If you buy that, it will begin to appear in the blood web of other characters
---
Do you know even how matchmaking works? 
---
They were a 4 man SWF and even though 3 of them were green ranks the matchmaking finds them a Killer based on the HIGHEST ranked Survivor, so the red rank. Which is why they ended up against Tru who is a red rank Killer. 
---
Doesn’t matter if 3 of them deranked all the way to rank 15, they’d still end up against a red/purple rank Killer so long as the 4th guy was in red ranks.
---
ofcourse its a claudette Main lol
---
we all know that this is just a prejudice but they never cease to prove it
---
Too bad he uploads content slower than a snail trying to get to his 9-5 shift in rush hour
---
I didn't know x)
---
Something being nerfed doesn't mean it was overpowered. People rely too much on Ruin. Nerf it and there will be less people relying on it.
---
Happy Leatherface, Plague and Legion noises.
---
Actually, I’ve only ever cleansed the unlit totems. Someone else’s gonna cleanse ***that*** totem.
---
Not OP but when I play survivor it's a Myers who Moris me before I am even Hooked once so... gotta be some balance in the world.
---
Gotcha , i need to buy the Cannibal and then level him to level 30 and then it starts appearing on others chars, or i didnt get it properly?
---
Yeah thats all fair. I just find it unnessecary to freak put over its use, especially when it doesnt even get activated. Ive been flamed in chat several times even though I 4kd before all the gens were finished.
---
Thank you
---
Wait a moment. *glares at Nancy*
---
oni... oni hurt me.
---
Anyone above rank 12 really.
---
Oh! Thank you, forgot that line
---
Source please, OP
---
I’ve gotten reported for body blocking before.
---
girl i play wich you
---
At that level if you look on the blood web they should be an orange coloured perk you need to buy that first before it appears in the blood web of other. BBQ &amp; Chilli appears at level 35
---
I don’t understand gen rushing, isn’t that the point? Get the generators done as fast as possible. Obviously deviating to heal/unhook survivors and destroy hexed totems but what else is there?
---
Wow did not know that ! Thank you !
---
Bamboozle + brutal strength + enduring + spirit fury on nurse OP?
---
I wouldnt mind its just the fact that I get shit survivors when I play survivor and good survivors when I play killer. I just want fairness and consistency.
---
Funny how these morons still cant get the matchmaking to work correctly after years. Theres always apparently some kind kf bug with it. Also funny how in their latest stream every answer seemed to start with “theres a bug for this at the moment”. Maybe its time they got their act together.
---
tru3ta1ent’s thumbnails are some of the most cringe cancer-inducing images i have ever seen in my life, and i havent even started on some of the titles I happened to see when recommended

i agree!! my roommates think their baby is crying if i don't use headphones
---
It still could be a lot better. I find the Xbox/Switch versions tend to have very weak directional control, like my only option is either up/down and left/right in chases. It makes scouting around the map annoying, or trying to pull off moonwalks/quick lunges around pallets.
---
Thank you for telling me
---
"Killers got constant top tier perks"
---
 your funny
---
I hear Dc-ing works as well
---
My friend sent this to me lol so idkk😭
---
Matchmaking has been fucked in one form or another since the game launched. Just like the maps have been notoriously shit.
---
Its time to accept that it’s just another feature that BHVR is simply incapable of doing correctly.
---
Good map design? They’re incapable of it.
---
Good matchmaking? It’s beyond their reach.
---
Stable bug-free game? Their programmers aren’t good enough.
---
The cosmetic design people seem to be the only talented employees they have.
---
The Council Will Decide Your Fate
---
In that case the survivors are just pissed off and looking for something to get worked up over. Imo you should just ignore them, get your footing, then switch it out for something that'll help you more mid-game like PGTW or BBQ or something. That's up to you.
---
You do realize I said DON'T take us trying to farm as trying to force you ro farm, right? Your entire point here is invalid, don't get mad because I'm not forcing you to do shit, I want to have a relaxing farm, I'm going to have a relaxing farm, you do whatever you want, all I ask is that you don't get pissed at me, because you have no reason to. I'm playing how I want, if you don't like that, it sucks to suck, let me not run DH or Adrenline because people don't like when I do that either.
---
You obviously don’t know how matchmaking works, and yet here you are trying to lecture on it.
---
Matchmaking takes the average of the SWF, with a higher weight for lower ranks, and matches based on that number. So a Rank 1 and a Rank 20 would average to 10, weigh in favor of the Rank 1, and come out to about 8 or 9.
---
Exact details aren’t fully released by BHVR, but that’s the general idea they’ve explained.
---
Then, and fucking then because you missed a major point, matchmaking will find a match for the SWF +/- 6 Ranks.
---
So a Rank 1, Rank 10, Rank 10, and Rank 12 SWF would average to 8.25, weighted for the Rank 1 to 7, and then match +/-6 for Rank 1 to Rank 13.
---
But all that doesn’t matter, because you have an obvious SWF (they were all in on a Sabo tactic, that’s not accidental), using all the same perks (They all know how to build a good perk loadout), using all Rank 3 perks (They all have high Bloodpoints investment), using practiced tactics (They SWF frequently, but they weren’t all the same Rank.
---
If they were a practiced SWF group as everything else points to, they should all be around the same rank. The disparity in Ranks is most likely caused by the purposeful deranking, and the only reason people derank purposely is to go against weaker opponents and smurf.
---
Even just watching that video, it’s evident that those players were green ranks. They purposely abused the system to smurf.
---
Who are you trying to defend and what does that say about you?
---
Ahhh, I see. The ole Kaepernick bug.
---
...She was the one
---
So according to your lógic if anybody does any of the actina that i listed avobe you would not complain since its playing the game, am i right?
---
Yeah the game kind of breaks against good survivors with shit killers. They know which loops can be run before being hit and the bottom feeder killers just aren’t capable of beating them effectively.
---
Just stick to the usual killers until the ranks are fixed.
---
You were too far my guy
---
If you plan on playing killer, get the Leatherface chapter strictly for BBQ and Chili. It’ll make the game so much more approachable with the blood points you’ll receive.
---
explain?
---
How so?
---
Of course not,  i think the pre-nerf Legion was in a good spot and balanced , but the DW was still useless
---
I’ve got close as killer (6) but it starts getting hard cause u either get wreck and -1 or u destroy the team and -1
---
I’ve seen it yesterday to another survivor and I’ve seen it in zubats stream.
---
Glad the disconnect penalty is coming. That will teach these scummy disconnectors to stay in the game. Being unable to move or participate is no excuse to disconnect.
---
Bring in my newest build!: tenacity, unbreakable, boil over, flip flop. With this build the killer will definitely regret ever slugging you. Also, you might never escape. But hey fuck slugging, right?
---
What’s his name in DBD I might have killed him
---
She’s a walking middle finger asserting her dominance.
---
I like the guy he’s just narcissistic at times, a strong player otherwise.
---
All good. I'm not on a computer but you could try reverse image searching maybe. I think the artists twitter is [@guud_night](https://twitter.com/guud_night?s=09) on Twitter but I can't find the pic on their profile
---
I kinda disagree with toolboxes but keys I 100% agree
---
You sweet sweet summer child.
---
Because he reached devotion 1, I guess. It isn't that long compared to dbd content creators and even I'm like devotion 3 level 8 or so.
---
As a bully main I do this at the start but dont rev it up longer then 2 seconds to confuse the survivors
---
Oh for sure, it definitely puts a bit of a “target” on you. I’ve been BMed or Moried simply because of the TTV in my name. Legit don’t play toxic. Also had people bitch me out about it in post game chat. It’s kinda crazy. But I do understand that some people give twitch streamers a bad name.
---
Or you could run that Jake park perk where he doesnt scream lol
---
*ahem*
---
Curtain Call: Pop, Bamboozle
---
Darkness among us: Discordance
---
Shattered bloodline: Spirit fury, haunted grounds
---
Demise of the faithful: Corrupt intervention
---
Ghostface: Im all ears.
---
killers got at least 1 amazing perk per chapter. Please list all the amazing perks survivors got from curtain call to the stranger things DLC.
---
Hey fellow Jake main ♥️
---
there's a perk called Calm Spirit that makes you not scream when getting hit hooked, shocked, exposed, or other things
---
You went right on to it. What you mean? You didn't get played. You played yourself. Dead hard effect ended directly on top of the trap
---
I am devotion 8 buddy try to keep up
---
It's so great for farming, and most people heal making it easy to extend matches and gain tons of bps
---
It's exactly like this for me too.  Just too many red rank swf teams and not enough red rank killers.
---
I’m fine with everything except for getting hooked it’s the only thing of that volume... and I shouldn’t have to waste a perk slot to fix an issue that should be an audio setting
---
are you crazy, the disarm trap thing popped up on my screen, i stopped moving, held RB to disarm, but instead of disarming, it put me on the trap
---
I think the problem is that people hear legion and immediately flip shit lol.
---
If he doesn’t play dbd I mean... sure I’ll screw him like it’s deliverance.
---
Idek why, you didn't even say anything controversial just a tip on how to play better 😂😂😂
---
Explain please? Douche
---
Platform: PC
---
Type of Bug: Ingame
---
Description: A hooked survivor does not have the hud as hooked and can't be unhooked. Can;t be picked up as well.
---
Video: [https://streamable.com/4hv7t](https://streamable.com/4hv7t)
---
Steps: Using Wraith (somehow only happens when i play wraith) down someone and hook them, if you can't cloak then the bug has started, downing another survivor makes you able to cloak and uncloak again, the survivor you hooked earlier is the only one affect, appears to be on the hook but cant be unhooked. can attempt to pick them up but the animation will only start a split second.
---
Using a gaming laptop
---
i didnt even dead hard, if i did, i would have been exhausted
---
Now for the ultimate plot twist. I was the Nancy
---
I used to run ruin, thana, dying light, and monitor. Is my new proposed build better than that?
---
Lol
---
They will. The terror radius doesn’t just instantly disappear, it goes away swiftly so they can hear it stopping
---
Crimson Chin Susie.😌
---
not sure why youre getting worked up over me being confused about your statement
---
Insidious, iron grasp, agitation and NOED
---
A fluke or the killer was a goddamn moth
---
The only good in this is more people will play the game which means less waiting for a lobby
---
Anything that would help you get survivors in the basement in the first place: agitation, iron grasp, insidious, and maybe one wildcard. Iron grasp isn't as useful as agitation in getting basement hooks, but some maps will make you need everything you got to reach the basement.
---
Holy shit
---
God toolboxes make gens even faster, if you are not playing a top tier you stand no chance
---
Even better, give him a fine, and you two will make even more money when turning yourself in
---
I just want to play Trapper. And I had two games today with a dedicated trap disarmer. They would just stalk me and disarm every trap, and repeatedly if it was on an infinite. Nothing like being a killer with no powers. So good.
---
Two of those are just playing like a dick. The other one is basically being mad because survivors are using an item the way it was meant. You're comparing these to survivors actually doing their objective.
---
Have you seen ninjas toxic af videos and how toxic the fortnite kiddies he’ll bring with him? I’d rather the dbd community at its worst.
---
It feels so bad on PS4, is it like that on other platforms?
---
I don't mean god toolboxes but regular ones. These are fine. Instructions/socket swivels commodious is a liiiiittle too strong. Just a bit :')
---
I'm not worked up but I think you're a douche for not saying please
---
Yeah I want to avoid being actually toxic since its not really the best way to show someone how to play lol. If he becomes toxic later it will be an independent decision. Idk if i can see who killer is via steam but i wish i could message them.
---
Are you busting a nut ?
---
I suggest taking both addons that make your frenzy last longer, so you can try and hurt everyone, never stay near a hook because chaser points go boom boom, Get a good generator slowdown perk like ruin or corrupt intervention, something good for early game because early game is what matters most as legion since you should try to hurt everyone at the start, try and end chases as quickly as you possibly could
---
I think Blood lodge (aka 38 pallets have fun) is the third most survivor sided map behind Asylum (many pallets, easy hiding, god loop at main building) and Haddonfield (no explanation needed). All three of them are just awful.
---
oh my b i guess
---
What is lag switching??
---
Yeah i think i'll change my steam name on top of some of the other recommendations. Ty!
---
It was me DIO
---
Who cares ? No0b3 is back
---
Feels like I’ve played Arimite before. Can’t remember the experience but do remember that name.
---
You right. It definitely looks like a dead hard. But actually what happened was it went to pallet right before you pressed it
---
Lag?
---
It’s laughable you wrote this whole thing when you could just, you know, read the Dev updates and see what you’re posting is wrong. 
---
No wonder so many people who play this game are so uninformed about everything.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019
---
* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
* If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor’s rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.) 
---
So what were you saying about it using the average?
---
I'd probably start by grabbing Hex: Ruin on the Hag, A Nurses Calling from the Nurse, as well as Brutal Strength and Agitation on the Trapper as all of these are free and relatively useful perks all around. 
---
By the time you get these you'll have a good idea of how you like to play and a better grasp on the games mechanics. 
---
For DLC recommendations, I would say Meyers, Freddy, and Ghostface because they're fun. 
---
Leatherface is a gimmicky Killer but his BBQ and Chili perk is absolutely amazing for BP gain and map awareness and I can't recommend it enough. 
---
Demogorgon is really fun to play as well, although it's perks are kinda lackluster. 
---
Plague is fun as well and her Corrupt Intervention perk is really awesome for some early game pressure. 
---
(I play mainly Killer so I can't comment much on Survivor DLC)
---
Best of luck to you and have fun!
---
The objective of the killer its to kill/ sacrifice the survivors,  so, camping someone to get the kill is ok, tunneling someone because is more close to die is also ok,  and moring someone who in another circumstamces would have been saved is also ok, after all the killer is doing his objective.
---
Hmmm... I wonder how much money a bucket can hold.
---
It’s ninja
---
i hate u so much, i had suppressed that and had to google it cos i recognised it and now im crying
---
I have all the perks on my main, so there's no point in me soaking BP in to the bloodweb just for more offerings to play. I'd rather put those BP in to other characters to level them up.
---
Regular BP offerings really aren't that good value for their investment, so it's often better to buy items or add-ons if you're going to use them. A BP offering which gives 50% bonus requires you to score 6000 BP in that area to make back the 3000 BP you invested. An offering for 75% bonus requires 5333 points, and one for 100% requires 5000 points. As you can see, bonus BP offerings are mostly just decreasing the loss you are taking when spending money on them.
---
All of them. Support the game. But, but if you're limited on your buys, get Leatherface, Myers, Ghostface, Oni, and Spirit. Everyone else can come eventually. Dont buy Clown, Plauge, Legion, or the Demigorgan. They are kinda bad.
---
When you purposefully make your internet shit to give you an advantage over other players. Since you’re the host, you can mess up survivors
---
Self-Care and Urban Evasion are honestly good perks if you use them correctly. Not if you run to the other side of the map to heal or crouch around the map doing nothing of course
---
Tell that to killers. The very reason killers are so salty at SWF proves that the game is not a team game. Because when a group of friends uses teamwork, killers feel it's game breaking.
---
Lol, literally ubisofts motto
---
So the lgtb doesnt boicot the game because there isnt a gay character
---
Oh god not this again. I though I outlived the Electric Straight Long Grinding Machine phase. I'm cursed yet again.
---
Im agreeing with you. But right before you went to disarm trap you can see the action switch to pull down pallet. That's what got you
---
Sweet, I wasn't aware that they reveal engine 4. So next gen consoles would make sense. Thanks
---
Still bs. But that's what happened
---
You.
---
That killers story is sad ;( is that a real outfit in game
---
Had a game against Freddy last week. All the gens get done, he downs someone, but before he picked up the survivor he opened the exit gate himself. Me and my SWF buddy knew exactly what was coming. Obvious Blood Warden is obvious. We Patricked out of there SO fast.
---
still a legion main sadly :(
---
It's quite literally a 'kick me' sign if I'm going be rather cynical. It's basically telling that person 'not only am I filming this, I'm filming this in front of a live audience who will be hearing everything I say. Please fuck with me.'
---
Yeah, go figure people are going to try and create 'heated gaming moments'.
---
Perks: Iron Grasp, Agitation, Insidious, Corrupt Intervention
---
Addons: The Grease, Primer Bulb
---
I had a similar idea of being a clone and you sabotage generators etc, but if you go up against a swf, they can point you out quickly.
---
I’m no Ninja fan, but what is this stupid gatekeeping?
---
Its 2014 all over again.
---
I wish I’m barely in tier 2  of the rift challenges and there’s only 10 days left for me to catch up😔
---
I JUST FINISHED A MATCH WHERE I GOT A 1K AT THE VERY END, AND I GOT CALLED A BAD KILLER BECAUSE I DIDNT LET THEM GO
---
APPARENTLY GOOD KILLERS LET SURVIVORS GO, AND I TOLD THEM THAT I LET THREE OF THEM GO SO I TECHNICALLY DID THAT
---
NOW I KNOW HOW TO PLAY KILLER, YOU JUST DONT KILL ANYONE, ITS AGAINST THE SURVIVORS HANDBOOK TO KILL PEOPLE
---
GOOD THING I KNOW SO I CAN AVOID BEING TOXIC NEXT GAME
---
(THE ONE WHO WAS ANGRY WITH ME WAS ONE OF THE GUYS WHO ESCAPED TOO)
---
I would say insidious, iron grasp, agitation and BBQ. I would use "make your choice" but since your playing bubba, BBQ is better for located survivors if they are near basement or not.
---
Yeah but how do they use lag to their advantage. I had lag kinda bad as killer today and ended up messing up because of it :&lt;
---
I know how to play Wraith and what stuff to use, I think the problem is that I don't slug the third survivor for the 4k because I find it really boring
---
You’re not lagging. The survivors are. They can’t move or interact with the game properly. Look up lag switchers on youtube
---
Nothing  
---
OP?
---
Yes sir.
---
Lol, fell the same way. Im lvl 178 lol
---
Basically those first 3...the 4th its players choice, some use Mad grit, others use Ruin or Franklin's
---
KONO DIO DA
---
\*Looks at overwatch forums whenever a character is revealed to be LGBTQ\*
---
CAN WE HAVE A PANSEXUAL CHARACTER
---
CAN WE HAVE A TRANS CHARACTER
---
CAN WE HAVE A BLACK, GAY, FEMININE TRANS MALE WHO WAS BORN IN INDIA THAT IS ALSO A FURRY AND IS DEAF?!!?!?!!?!?
---
\*vomits into the cringe bucket\*
---
Although it'd be weird to see Susie chase you down stabbing you all (assuming you've got her skin on) only for Frank to have to actually force her to finish you off.
---
I don’t need to invest as i never use them haha
---
I recommend Meyers, Freddy, Ghostface, Plague, Doctor and Leatherface.
---
As previously stated, Leatherface is gimmicky and really only good for his BBQ and Chili perk (although Franklin's Demise is pretty good too) but BBQ is invaluable, especially if you get it early in a Bloodweb.
---
I love playing the game on PC but I cant play Killer on PC. The wait is longer than the actual game. Since I have more friends on console who have the game, I just play SWF on PS4. It sucks that basically I have to give u ol playing Killer on PC tho.
---
Whenever three people crowd around the spud I hung and refuse to let me get more than 20 meters away from the hook before prying his mealy, russet, form from the pole, it sure is teamwork.   
---
Just not the good kind. There's a reason why people who are much better at the game than most people here recommend against pathological altruism, for your sake and the team's sake.
---
You didnt include a black, blonde chinese with curls, you misogynistic pig!!111!!
---
Wishful thinking on my part for sure, but I could see them doing one next weekend when there's only a couple days left for the pass. I'm right there with you I've got 5 or 6 levels left to go and basically no challenges left to do. The grind is real.
---
its literally the point of you screaming to be discomforting
---
This whole time I thought it was called slugging because you slug the survivor with your weapon instead of hooking them.
---
same
---
I have had the same experience. Been taking screenshots to prove it, too. I don't want to quit as much as you do, but it is far from fun.
---
Its painfull bro... :'(
---
I will remember you
---
I mean a minority of NOED games are utilized by a camper. I wouldn't mind tokens.
---
I should get some help I get an headache while playing this game. But I can't stop :(
---
Yes they definitely need dedicated on the consoles. Some games, not all that I have played on Xbox can be absolute trash if the killers are exploiting their internet connection. Once this is addressed along with the frame rate I would love crossplay. Also I think they need to give console players the option to drop the graphic settings.
---
I'm so sorry for that. I will pray to god and repent my sins. D:
---
Epic
---
Big meg
---
Not all of us run these perks...i would much rather farm my team mates
---
ZA WARUDO! Ketteitekina sutoraiki!
---
Killers who tunnel or killers who slug for the 4k.
---
BM the killer so they hit you on hook, stops the scream quicker
---
I mean the same can be said for the adrenaline plays where you cone off the hook healthy and with a speed boost, but it shares the same problem with NOED whereits dormant for most of the game.
---
I miss the switch button, does anyone know why it was removed
---
I just wish they weren’t so short
---
I don't get it
---
Same, at rank 12 getting rank 3-7 survivors
---
Xbox?
---
Great now your mentioning religion... Yeah can't have that
---
Did anybody disconnect?
---
Tf is this?
---
Obviously the Nea is LGBT. (Soldier 76)
---
Nea is straight in the chinese version. (Soldier 76) Thx China
---
Nea is straight/ bi/ pan/ Chloe Price/The Entity
---
Why does it matter what their orientation is?
---
Also the cltohing came before the AMA and pretty sure not every dev in BHVR says the same thing.
---
Have you never played swf? Like 90% of the game is just confused yelling when you first start playing and it’s probably the best time you could have in this game
---
no, not a single one dc'd. not even while they were hooked
---
Could I get a link please?
---
They make Freddy look like wraith 😂
---
bad format, good meme
---
But they had a key and adrenaline.
---
I'm fine DC'ing as killer, BP gained as survivor seems a lot harder to come by compared to killer (maybe im just bad at survivor though)... Just don't want to be punished for something that isn't my fault.
---
This picture also needs to depict angry Steve somewhere behind staring in anger.
---
No this is good.
---
I mean look at no0b3
---
It's fantastic that we live in a world where Legion is more of a survivor than Nea.
---
I disagree, it requires far too much work too use effectively. Dead Hard is much better. None of the exhaustion perks are OP now that BL has been nerfed.
---
That must be some baby to cry like that.
---
i cant tell if this is a /s or not
---
Always think these people expect everyone to speak russian or whatever. I cant even read your words. Just write in english like every other damn person
---
Oh o.o
---
You’re joking right?
---
He wasn't the Wraith, but yeah that was my first thought too. I've seen far worse stomps with less of a rank discrepancy.
---
More like typical killer main.
---
Nothing against him personally, but tbh, he’s not that good of a killer. I used to think he was very good when I started playing the game, but as I started getting better, I realized he’s kinda mediocre.
---
He makes ton of mistakes and blames it on the game. Don’t get me wrong, nobody plays the game perfectly. However, he makes very obvious mistakes that end up costing him the match
---
Since it appeared at the same time they integrated SWF instead of it being a second option my guess is they don’t trust themselves to actually make it have you leave the party if you switch &amp; are worried it’ll end up leading to more 2+ killer bugs
---
Btw i was being ironic obv
---
You can probably report this on the dead by daylight forums, or you can find an article there telling you how
---
"use translator"
---
But I can't copy that text, neither can I type those letters..
---
I saw someone else get advice so I’m gonna go for the same, I’m low key absolute garbage at looping against any slightly good killer, I don’t really understand because I’ve almost reached red ranks (rank 5) solo queue and don’t play stealthy at all, but still am not very good at chases. Help?
---
They do the shook, they get the hook.
---
Good, tunneling isn't fun to deal with.
---
One match? You've seen less than 1% of it
---
Salty.
---
Lagswitching isn't really possible anymore, since we have dedicated servers. The dedi servers are just as bugged out, if not worse now.
---
Spirit has a kimono like that but as for min no.
---
&gt;The game you linked where the survivors are using a Sabo build poorly, was a SWF group that purposely deranked to face off against weaker killers.
---
You... literally just made that up. Like Tru3 did... and as I suggested in my post, they do in fact play like low ranks. They're not looking behind them.
---
&gt; They are 100% toxic. They manipulated the matchmaking and ranking system  to purposely face less experienced killers for their own fun. 
---
You made that up. Litrerally calling them toxic off of assuming they have purposely deranked. That's silly.
---
Right because survivors love to complain about how broken DS/Unbreakable when they can be countered.
---
He's definitely very clickbaity and posts outrageous claims so he can make content. I think he says its to "create a discussion within the community", but as far as I can tell he defends those claims (Wraith a top 3 killer) to his grave. Hes a good player for the most part, but he's a bit over the top sometimes
---
Like I said /s for the dense.
---
People who say this really need to play killer more. A minute is a long fucking time, you can easily down another survivor, hook them and then run into and get punished by the DS user.
---
you gotta have self care for those asshole teammates that don't heal you all the way then tbag ya :)
---
that doesnt make it bad though, it really isnt hard when you use it a lot. Sure you have to babysit it but when you do, its easily the best. and babysitting it really isnt hard. 
---
Also BL wasnt OP, it never was, what was OP was shitty map design
---
Big mec
---
The stunner meal deal
---
Not tryna flex, but you have a long way to go. Devotion 13 over here.
---
People need to play survivor and realize getting hooked straight after being downed isn't fun. No one wants to get sacrificed two minutes in the game.
---
At least the killer has other things he can focus on which he should have been doing anyways.
---
3.7/10, not enough memes.
---
Also, I don't think the 90 seconds of talking about teachables was needed here. like... will you put it in every video at the start?
---
Reading something and then saying what it does when it's clear feels weird
---
comparisons are great and I want more
---
I’m aware I just wish it was quieter... nothing else is that loud
---
Because the original comment made so much sense in the first place.
---
Just run Calm Spirit, easy counter.
---
I don’t mean to bring this up on this sub but yet Fortnite, one of the most popular PvP games ever, has victory emotes to use when you kill someone, one of which is the L dance.

What pisses me off about Aaron isn't his thumbnails or videos. What really gets on my nerves is the fact that he thinks that he has the record for the most escapes in a row (around 90 escapes), even though he had a SWF making their priority protecting him. In my eyes, to get the record for most escapes, you can't be in a SWF. Run whatever you want, and the streak can go on for multiple streams, just don't have a SWF sucking your dick and preventing you from even getting hooked.
---
Yeah you should shake your head, why the hell would survivors need to learn how to counter their own perk lmao.
---
"It's just not viable."
---
Repetitive and boring content, love it.
---
Ruin ain't hard to work through bro. This seems like a case of git gud.
---
Adren at least plays off the fact you survived late enough to pop 5 gens, and presumably you did some part of that work.
---
NOED is play without a perk slot, potentially all game if totems are broke, and get rewarded more then any other perk in the game, albeit in the shortest part but on the flip side of that more happens in that small part that you can capitizalize on. Theres usually not a pallet close to the exit gates so its a free down if they commit instead of running when terror radius happens
---
I'm not saying NOED is overpowered by any means, i am saying it seems super bullshit for that one survivor in the endgame to get instadowned because once gens and popped you are free to basically camp the hook since there is nowhere else for you to go. Adrenaline is just unlucky and that rarely happens in my games.
---
*laughs in devotion 4*
---
i know it isn't that high compared to other players.
---
This is why I watch Dat360NoScope
---
Did you hook them on the same hook?
---
Dammit ya beat me to it
---
Were your parents asleep?
---
Feng main?
---
Have you BEEN in first place in Mario Kart?
---
Shit's terrifying
---
i can't 100% remember. maybe i sacrificed 2 survivors on the closest hook. does that actually matter?
---
Not worth it
---
Decisive strike, adrenaline, unbreakable, dead hard, sprint burst, borrowed time...
---
Half of those aren't even DLC.

And when you do wiggle "i WaS gOnNa GiVe HaTcH" Yeah sure you was.
---
No mither would actually be a really good change bc if the killer knows you have it he won't slug you, like at all.
---
Yea you have to do all of them on different hooks
---
And i thought green ranks where toxic
---
Legion: *disgust*
---
Susie: *woke*
---
 Curtain Call: Dance With Me	
---
 Shattered bloodline:  Deliverance, Autodidact
---
 Darkness among us: Aftercare, Distortion
---
 Demise of the faithful: Head on
---
Ash: Mettle of Man
---
Stranger Things: Inner Strength, Fixated, Second Wind, Babsitter
---
Also: Haunted grounds, Discordance, and Im all ears are not top tier
---
Wasn't even talking about that. Perhaps learn how comment threads work.
---
It appears it may be on Xbox so it's possible (kinda hard to tell cause the vault window prompt is up for about .02 seconds)
---
Wait a minute, is that a code on the board? Seems like a specific set of elements, then the EGC on the board
---
Make your own then instead of replying to a thread about killers learning how to counter DS/Unbreakable.
---
Don't worry about it fam. Whether or not you're doing the 'acceptable' thing, you're gonna get flamed in-game and on here.
---
So many memes on this subreddit complaining about survivors wiggling when killers want to give the hatch and then you have these memes, killer players are bipolar.
---
If this isn't a joke, then:
---
I think you should go so a mental health professional. Even I don't get this pissed over video game after hours of playing now unless the game is extremely unfun.
---
I hope your condition improves.
---
It's too RNG. You're as likely to get an Abdominal Dressing as a Gel Dressings and it doesn't do anything to guarantee a good base item. You'll get more brown Medkits with Bandages than Dull Keys with Weaved Rings.
---
It only really shines with Plunderer's, but that's half your perks just for looting chests. And it's still RNG as to whether you'll get anything good from them.
---
Just my opinion, but Plunderer's &gt; Ace In The Hole if you're just casually looting chests.
---
Could be. I can't do math. But maybe someone else will know.
---
Where is P3 Jake?
---
Big facts.
---
Yours too since you clearly can't read.
---
I had a game where the killer slug me and went to close the hatch, I had adren, got back up and ooened the gate cause they were too far away. It still has the potential to allow for the same type of situations.
---
I used to get angry at the t-baggers until I learned that they're usually coaxing me into hitting them because they're covering their friend's ass. So I go after their friend and laugh while their plan fails.
---
Sup y’all,
---
I’ve been playing dbd on ps4 for a bit (over two years now) and I’m just looking for some chill survivors to play SWF games with. 
---
I prefer people who’ve been playing a while, typically those who usually fall into ranks 1-5 like myself. My tag is ItsBayBahri. Let me know in my friend requests that you came from reddit and I’ll add you up. Thanks, players!
---
Fucking gay
---
My big brain combo is No Mither, Self-Care, Solidarity, and Lucky Break
---
I’m not trying to counter something tho, it’s an audio cue that should be able to be adjusted via settings
---
I need a Steve version of this too.

You seem to be missing the key point of

&gt;Survived long enough for 5 gens to be completed and gets a **POSSIBLE** health state and speed boost for 5 seconds
---
versus the killer comparison of
---
&gt;failed to kill, possible even down a single  survivor for 5 gens and slaps them to dying in one hit with no warning for the rest of the match/until totem is broken.
---
Yes, gens aren't a killers objective, but it is their side objective to the point that it directly ties into the main objective. If they escape you cant kill them, to escape they need to do gens, therefore kill the ones around the gens.
---
yes;)
---
there was a artist on twitter who was doing a retro comic style dbd merch cant remember his @ tho
---
haha nice find! its obvious what happened here. they got drunk off their @$$es then jacked themselves to death to pr0n on that computer. too bad theres no way to bring a survivor into that room
---
This post in and of itself, is inherently childish, just like the people you’re claiming as such. By all means come back when you’ve actually experienced the game as a whole and not just one pitiful match. Then you have a valid opinion, until then nobody will take your rants seriously.
---
Try getting into a custom game and getting back in there, take a screenshot and post it here. I'm certain people like PaulieEsther and maybe even MorthalGuard will get to it
---
a sweaty killer is a killer who beats you
---
Ayrun is a Nice guy, but those thumbs are so... The circles... The arrows... The OP... All that is just too much. Ayrun need some clean thumbs for once.
---
People would so abuse it by trapping survivors inside.
---
You owe me gold kind sir
---
That would be cool. I wish they would update the mori for the older killers. Most of them really suck compared to the new ones.
---
Man that is awesome! Good find!
---
that is so shit, the challenge is already hard enough
---
It's a joke
---
haha yeah his mori is the best to do that in

The Crusader for next killer.

Giant claymore, low terror radius but loads of clanking about.

If I only had that kinda money
---
you're missing one huge fact: theyre just goofing around, theyre NOT being toxic or tryng to anger you. besides, you obviously havent played as jason in the f13 game. thats the worst!
---
just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks, and gives you too hard a time than is worth it at higher ranks. just play for fun. i'm always rank 17 and the highest rank i get is 11, i BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ all 4 of them, i just hunt and hit them only if they're not injured. for perks use BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's Calling, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i often repeat to myself, for example, "just do 1 and 3" (referring to whichever survivor from 1-4 at the bottom left). i'd never play any other way.
---
Legion really doesn't need a small buff...
---
They need a *HUGE* one.
---
No. There was one gen done because if the killer closes the hatch adren activates. Which means I didn't do anything to deserve the escape.
---
P3 Claudette, 99% of the time they bring a flashlight and click it at you and tbag the whole game. Down them 1 time and they DC instantly. Wanna be Ochidos
---
Franklins Demise, seriously fuck this perk. 
---
P3 Hillbilly who only chainsaws and has god tier accuracy and sensitivity, more terrifying than hate this.
---
And DS is fine for countering that, but it shouldn't make you unstoppable against nontunelling killers as well. It's not run as an antitunneling perk currently, it's just run because it gives you such a long window of immunity for no cost.
---
Head on over to r/oinkers they will set you straight
---
I did it to the other two and I was the last to get mori'd lmao the ghost face even said he saved me for last bc of it lmao
---
I don't like the guy and I do complain about him, but I wouldn't stream-snipe the dude.
---
Honestly all these posts bashing him are more toxic than anything he’s done involving the game so far. People are just hive mind hating on this and honestly it’s not even funny, it was old the moment this hate fad started.
---
They dont need to categorize their sexualities. It's not important. I  my own head canon, they are all LGBT and that's what's important.
---
You're supposed to just tickle survivors with your weapon and then let them drop pallets on your head so they all escape. Come on be a good sport
---
That "code" is just the electron configuration of Gold, that's how the electrons are distributed along the shells and subshells.
---
The small numbers means the number of electrons, and the bigger letters are the type of atomic orbital that admits those electrons.
---
Can't explain really much, and english is not my main language, but you get the ideia.
---
I feel like Ussylis is the best dbd content creator you can watch tbh. He is really good on survivor and has a lot of knowledge on the game, I learn a lot just by watching his videos.

Description: When leveling the bloodweb, the game freezes when buying a perk. 
---
Steps to reproduce: Just spend bloodpoints.
---
Expected result: Game freezes
---
Actual result: Game freezes.
---
Reproduction rate: Restarted multiple times, drivers are up to date. Happens on survivors (Meg, Nancy, etc.). Happens every bloodweb at least once if not twice.

I wish I were.
---
Dr Wraith prescribes one bing bong
---
But what does that mean related to EGC thingie i have zero clue
---
You could have easily grabbed that Claudette at the end.
---
Well, Just don't stick to low ranks and they won't be a problem, till ninja get to high ranks, those will follow him to a new game.
---
ah, i missed the hatch part, but my point still applies, that killer was absolute dogshit. He closed the hatch and didnt get to the gate in time, which is near impossible on most maps unless you got a large or opposite side gate spawn/maps like hawkins or game. A player misplaying is not evidence of allowing the same type of play, a good killer on those maps would of just let you bleed out while guarding hatch.
---
I don't think one perk should break multiple maps. Reducing stagger is cool, but it really hurts the design of maps and opens so many possibilities for loops.
---
That's the part that scares me.
---
When he hurts himself at the start of the match 😍😍😍
---
Best part about Trapper is when they run dead centre over the trap and it doesn’t activate.
---
Its been a problem for well over a year but no fix in sight.
---
Ate too many escape cakes
---
YES LMAO
---
That's the problem. The developers enable these kinds of things.
---
I feel like its because he genuinely believes that the builds are op, and he seems very excited in his vids. It's the reason why I still watch his content even though I don't play the game anymore go EZ on him
---
I keep seeing thing bout having all 4 in the lobby and you can switch which youre using at anytime
---
Is the base chance of escaping the hook still 4%?
---
There's such strange insults and terms in this community
---
My point exactly lol
---
As soon as I hear the killer coming I crouch to the right of the door and just take off when they see the other survivor inside and pass me.
---
I'm not angry. I'm just irredeemably disappointed.
---
It was out of context Frank didn’t mean to call Joey the gamer word.
---
How would you trap survivors inside if nurse is the only one that can get in?
---
Lol what is your actual devotion?
---
The face was revealed in the first movie just saying.

The electron configuration [Xe]4f14 5d10 6s1 is for Au or Gold

See for me, my game lags out the worst when it comes to skill checks. I have to time it differently than others, because I don't know how badly I'm gonna lag out. Sometimes theres no lag tho, which is nice.
---
You want me to get into my rant about how pennywise would ruin both the lore DBD and IT? My argument will mostly be comprised of whiney "In the Book...."s
---
That wouldn't be so bad, but that's not the case when they're the only one left and their mission is to make you feel like shit. It makes you wonder how badly they've been fucked up.
---
well yes, but that is only if you walk directly on it, and it doesnt happen as you walk away, as it would if hag triggered her own traps
---
So it's a hint for the golden toolbox in EGC that we found AFTER we found the golden toolbox. Nice.
---
Honestly, Same. It's not fun trying out a killer I just got and being paired with a team full of toolboxes, purple add ons and fancy outfits.
---
WOW I ACTUALLY HIT 100 UPDOOTS
---
Its the same arguement as do bones though. Its easy to prevent. If he would have found hatch, come back and hooked me it would have been fine.
---
It worked nicely for the 'hook the obsession 10 times challenge', but aside from that I fail to see practical applications
---
it's not so much that he says that as the reason, but more because he blames stuff like that instead of his misplays.[This Freddy game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z02MrRvNUWM&amp;t=2s) is a good recent example on how he kinda just played badly and didn't utilize his build correctly like at all, but blamed everything else he could since he can never ever play badly apparently. Though he can mock the survivors for playing badly not realizing how confusing M&amp;A + Pill Bottle is to go against.
---
Hell yes those are "OP" because he uses 2 or 3 meta perks in those builds. What do you expect?
---
Wow creepy. I don't remember anything related to the show like this.
---
Maybe this is my wishful thinking, but possible season 4 content?
---
There’s an election configuration for a certain element on that board. Does anybody know which element?
---
Congratulations man. I hit it myself yesterday. Also got rank 1 survivor this season and after working my ass off for rank 1 killer and survivor I feel it really helps to play both because I feel it's easier to read what the other side is doing. At least against the top tier killers. I get smashed by the "mid" tier killers because I hardly go against them. Especially on console.
---
This is the fucking truth
---
It's supposed to be a hint for the golden toolbox on that map even though we've already found it unfortunately
---
Wraith is such a low tier killer, rank 1 is hard to achieve, and playing on console (from my experience) is awful.
---
Oh my! That's actually amazing lol
---
Using this literally 100% intended feature of the game should be bannable. And why is DS not infinite use and a survivor default? C’mon BHVR fix your game.
---
Unfortunately not. No way they could do something like that. It's meant to be a hint for the golden toolbox on the map being only accessible during the EGC, even though we found this after we found the toolbox
---
why not depip to a lower rank?
---
You don’t need deer stalker and nurses calling together. I would suggest sloppy butcher and nurses instead.
---
What’s the difference between this dude and Ochido as far as game play? I subscribe to his channel and I literally don’t see much difference in game play.
---
Oh so *this* is why this thread has 23 replies...
---
Yeah. Guess they expected someone to find that first instead of stumbling upon the toolbox accidentally
---
so you already got your answers on a stream but still decided to whine about the devs on reddit? i think you misunderstood me when i said you were a whiny baby, because you are definitely a whiny baby.
---
You cant break something that is already broken
---
Read next time please
---
its not the same argument at all. Totems are not an integral objective nor are they easily findable, at least as much as gens are. Survivors not doing 5 totems is not a misplay, its borderline intended behavior of the game. If not playing around a perk is a misplay then you should never get in a locker because of iron maiden, 2+ on gens because of discordance, heal another survivor cause they have nurses etc.
---
Killer closing the hatch when he has no idea where you are, and not within range of gates is a misplay because its preventable through normal gameplay. You die in the next minute~. Not doing totems on the very small chance someone is using an uncommon, but not rare perk is way easier then doing them every game.
---
Aw dang. Well still a really cool easter egg.
---
How are you going to get 15% vaulting speed? Spine chill doesn't increase it.
---
Yeeeeezy. I feel bad for xbox players then.
---
I dont really want to hear it, and I wouldn't be too upset if he didn't get included. I thought I heard something about the clown is all, and a leaked code image I saw on leak by daylight, and was merely asking if any one heard about it.
---
Hag and her perks were designed from the ground up solely to camp.
---
&gt;This post in and of itself, is inherently childish
---
As long as we're being civil (which I expect to change very shortly, based on the treatment I usually get), I'd like you to explain your reasoning.
---
&gt;At worst though, it’s self-aggrandising and trying to morally grandstand on a high-horse.
---
Incorrect. That would require an inflation of one's ego, and I adamantly despise myself. 
---
&gt;Then you have a valid opinion, until then nobody will take your rants seriously.
---
This is bigotry in spades. I don't understand why I would need to have hours in *one game* to be able to properly identify a *general behavior*.
---
&gt;To quote yourself, you’re acting like a fool right now and wasting everyone’s time, including yours.
---
Again, please explain as coherently as possible.
---
&gt;Oh cute, they downvoted me in a lame attempt to bury my opinion. Guess I struck a nerve.
---
I don't downvote comments that don't require a downvote. That much I promise you. Someone else has downvoted you, and it's likely because you're being unnecessarily hostile.
---
Inb4 the entity starts blocking pallets after 3 vaults.
---
you are fucking joking right?
---
Sure discordance, haunted, and Im all ears are not "top tier" but they are amazing perks in the right builds/killers.
---
Also please tell me how Dance with me, Deliverance, Autodidact, After care, Distortion, Head on, MOM, inner strength, fixated, second wind, and babyisster are top tier? literally NONE of those are meta
---
Dead Hard and Yeet me out the gate
---
Ya gotta remember that someone needs to leave a generator in order to pick that person back up then spend time healing. While you chase the rescuer look around and find the 4th person on a gen and chase them.
---
If not at least you’ve applied pressure to 3 survivors at one thus slowing the game down. This way you can easily snowball and win.
---
You'd have to have a pretty sick sense of humor to consider demeaning your fellow humans as "goofing around".
---
A sweaty killer or survivor is a killer that treats the round more like a life or death situation rather than a win or lose video game that doesn't harm you in real life. People(especially when they're salty) misuse the term.
---
Context doesn't matter. Don't be rude to other people. Even if it's just the Internet.
---
You mean ''Ayron'' or whatever the fuck he's changing his name to?
---
I just got that after using an escape hatch!!! What the fuck is it?????
---
OP❗️⁉️❕❕❔‼️💯💯⬆️⬇️⬅️↙️↖️⤵️⤴️↩️↕️↔️↗️↘️➡️
---
Where is that cannon? I've never heard about it.
---
Its easier, sure. But those are the chances you take if you decide not to do them. They are part of the emblem system so it is part of the "objective". But any good survivor knows the spawn locations of totems.
---
The issue with it is with every map they build, they have to consider how BL could break it. It's not healthy for game design.
---
Insidious, Agitation, Iron Grasp, and NOED or Mad Grit.
---
Have fun. For some reason this build harvests more salt than iri head huntress
---
Any reason this map is getting played a lot? Like half of my matches since Christmas have been at the swamp.
---
Were*  &lt;3
---
End game screen
---
The reason they have the bright white one is so Michael is easy to spot since he is one of the most powerful stealth killers
---
I’m just meming too...
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting multiple iridescent emblems (use our weekly smile sunday threads).
---
I would love to see your take on survivor nerds also.
---
You are the kind of a person that would say that hag isnt a sex simbol 2020 smh
---
This game is still going pretty strong after 3 years with the same behavior, so all these doom and gloom posts make me chuckle a bit.
---
Halo on Xbox was still a worst experience for me, especially as a female. Haven't had much toxic interaction in DBD in my 3 years on PC thankfully!
---
Oh. Im sorry
---
Doing gods work out here
---
I loove taking away survivors toys. I should really run Franklin's more.
---
I cannot get Adept on him it's terrible
---
And my death. No tunnelling killer deserves a 4k.
---
It must feel real shitty when an entire gaming community pretty much wants you to have nothing to do with their game. Lol. Just watched one of his videos for the first and last time the guy is a total idiot.
---
Could you explain that Golden Toolbox thing?
---
Wtf is that
---
Holy shit I love him
---
I wouldn’t really care too much since I don’t watch him anymore. He complains too much, and yeah I get there’s some unbalanced shit, but you can’t always have a good match or whatever. He’s better than the average player, but also not as good as he thinks he is.
---
uwu
---
Well then I mori’d him lmao I heard he was playing saw the name and was like just Incase
---
Judging by this you're sexist, racist, trump supporting trailer park trash.
---
edit: Nah you're 6 years old
---
What's funnier still is Mobile has it now. Makes me sad.
---
Ah, a fellow weeb. Always good to see one of us around these parts.
---
Simple fix, cap the FPS.
---
“YoU’Re sTrEaMsNiPiNg”
---
ugh my eyes
---
On every map there's a hidden golden toolbox.
---
A month ago or so someone found it on this map. It's in a crate in the portal room. The crate opens after the endgame collapse starts.
---
So this is a hint for the toolbox. But I found the hint after the toolbox was actually found lol
---
Hello, PS4 /PC player here, rank 1 killer / survivor on both platforms (not this month as I've taken this month off.) 
---
Down to play KYF, SWF, or just for general play what-so-ever.
---
Tag : Bailey4lyf on PSN!
---
Know my struggles :( last night I went against a nurse on lerrys that would only blink until.she found someone and started a chase. Then you pallet stun and suddenly you jolt and she was hitting you and had you blocked against the pallet.
---
I really hope one day I get featured in a video for streamsniping . The trick to it is to have a single monitor and no stream accounts or apps to really make it convincing
---
I’ve actually played a match where the killer was so greedy for the 4k that he kept slugging the guy with the racecar slug build and kept getting chased and picking himself up that we actually escaped with 2 left. It was hilarious.
---
Consider yourself lucky. 
---
No one ever said the end would come swiftly. Rome wasn't built in a day.
---
Wish they would make it so there is a little more gameplay to the power. Holding M1 isn’t very fun for survivors either. The rework idea being shared below with lockers is way more interesting
---
I wish their power was more like plague in the sense instead of just holding M1 to disable the ability there is a level of mind game, strategy and skill in countering the ability. 
---
Plague sickness:
---
- Survivor has strategic counters
---
- plague can punish poor cleanses
---
- cleansing has location, gens left and other people cleansing as well as timing into play when deciding when to cleanse
---
- either way gives plague a power she can potentially use
---
legion:
---
 
---
- get hit by frenzy hold m1 for 8 seconds or loop the legion if they go for you (which is easy because the stun to even exit frenzy lets you get anywhere)
---
- no location, timing and awareness needed to counter
---
it happens, depends on rank and level of sweat. if you don’t want to stay still tho, just wiggle. Personally I think it’s kind of dumb that some ppl kill survivors who wiggle. If I decide to give someone hatch, I give them hatch, idgaf if they walk away thinking they got it themselves bc they broke away from me three to four times. Usually it’s funny anyway. 
---
That said, I don’t usually wiggle myself just out of curiosity. Plus sometimes ppl go the extra mile to BM and that’s always really funny too. Had a bubba drop me next to hatch and close it in my face, then bring me to the exit gates and drop me, then pick me up again and take me back to a hook. He played well, deserved a 4k, and it was more fun than someone just mindlessly throwing my ass on a hook
---
Getting free heals that arn't affected by mangled from second wind and inner strength isn't good? Getting a free hit with Mettle of Man isn't good? Getting yourself off the hook, Losing the killer by vaulting, Being able to see everyones aura at all times, healing somebody in mere seconds, avoiding bbq&amp;chili or any other aura reading perks, and being able to stun the killer by coming out of a lockers non of these are good? 
---
Sure there are not "top tier" but like you said with the killer perks they are amazing perks in the right builds
---
Yesterday I was 11 going against all reds
---
Aura reading perks: exists
---
Ninja: he’s stream snipping, he’s literally the biggest sniper in the world
---
...And im definitely not going out of my way to translate when i can just move on to the next game
---
Looks like the devs put in a hidden dev room, lol.
---
Nice finger toe
---
Stop justifying his tunnelling. You have said multiple times you do not like tunnelling, so why am I the only one in the wrong here? If I did something shitty, it's because he deserved it.
---
I was the only one on our team with Decisive, I also had Lithe. Thing is, these perks require skill to use. Maybe not decisive, but that's to prevent tunnelling. Tunnelling requires NO perks and all you have do to is slap the hooked survivor after they get unhooked.
---
So make up your damn mind kid. Do you like tunnelling, or do you not like tunnelling? You've been looking through Myers perspective the entire time. You haven't factored in his tunnelling, so to you he did nothing wrong and I'm a sinner for helping a teammate escape against a tunnelling killer.
---
I was being sarcastic
---
What’s even better is I don’t run a lot of aura perks cause people are idiots and will like sprint in front of u then hide behind a barrel and wonder how u found them
---
Is that like a hand foot?
---
This is how I'm picturing them whenever there's a new wave of angry people complaining about something.
---
Okay, so of course it's a ship child with Dwight, but who else is it?
---
Naw man I'm honestly glad you like this game so much that's great, I don't really have a game I love am good at and can play endlessly
---
This might be the worst take I've seen in a while.
---
Just playing the game... okay, so a 4 man SWF team with toolboxes, Prove Thyself and Adrenaline are just playing the game? Even if they are moving from gen to gen without doing bones, unhooking others or even bigger: Not healing?
---
There is a line between simply doing the objective and actively trying to end the game as soon as possible. Typically 2 or 3 minutes. Or rush gens until 1 is left, then farm until you make sure that your team pips.
---
If you think Ruin is a shitty perk, you have not played at red ranks. Or played at purple/red ranks with a low/mid tier Killer. Gens pop extremely quickly and Survivors can snowball easily. 5 gens will pop in under 4 minutes if you aren't using Ruin.
---
It can be inconsistent because it's a hex perk, but if it's been up for a minute, it's done it's job. And a LOT of people STILL can't hit Ruin skill checks, so every second with Survivors being distracted is one extra second for the Killer.
---
Ruin also negates the bonus you would normally get from hitting Greats so there's that as well.
---
Pop can act as a substitute for Ruin but you would have to be good at getting people quickly hooked. Or play a Killer that can make Survivors go down. Like Spirit or PC Nurse.
---
So, in conclusion... try and see the other side instead of being biased, okay?
---
I feel like the game is trying to tell you something
---
This is a really good idea in my opinion. It'd also make sense for all 4 to be there bc they're a group, not solo peeps.
---
That or when they're huddled around trying to make sure everything's ready for a big patch day.
---
Nurse and Spirit would like to have a word
---
Like ninja says that the killer is snipping but the truth is that killers aren’t blind well some are but most aren’t so like he shouldn’t complain about getting caught when he hides like a zero braincell slug
---
It’s funnier when u win and they’re toxic like bro you’re all red ranks and I’m like rank 11 calm down
---
Working as intended
---
wdym
---
Thats actually really cool
---
are you joking? Yea im all ears, haunted, and discordance are good in the right situations, but thats only 3 of the perks i listed.
---
You literally said yourself that survivors didnt get any amazing perks in over a year.
---
Second wind and inner strength are alright, but with second wind you have to heal another person to activate it in the first place. 
---
"getting a free hit with Mettle of man isnt good?" No actually, its amazing! i just love when my MOM activates every game! its totally not a worthless perk that wont activate almost ever!
---
"losing a killer by vaulting" yea, unless the killer has direct line of sight like he normally does and you are uninjured.
---
After care is just bad bond/empathy 
---
Yea, bc you really need to heal someone in seconds at end game when that perk actually works, bc it takes all game just to set it up. Worse well make it.
---
Hiding your aura isnt worth a perk slot when lockers do the same thing. and when you only have 3 tokens 
---
Head on is decent, but its one of the weakest exhaust perks in the game, if not the weakest.
---
Jump scare myers gets me sometimes, but I'll be damned if I don't choose the side of the gen next to the wall everytime.
---
You got me there. I feel dumb now. 
---
don't worry I pissed  someone off with my reply. He messaged me this:
---
That was an insult?................... you gotta be like at least 10 years old or you're a sexist, racist, trump supporting trailer park trash
---
your feelings are way to easy to manipulate if you're offended by other races and sexualities, let me guess you go to church everyday with your pathetic excuse of a life praying the LGBT away with your little trump doll you kiss everynight, You'll be even more frustrated when Trump gets impeached
---
edit: I always wanna know what trolls/haters look like because 90% they're either ugly or fat and still living at home with their parents and they're 30 years old
---
You know how often russian ppl start playing some cooperative games abd talk to each other in english just cause russians has like shittest reputation ever in games and then 10 minutes  after it turns out they both were russian the whole time. Its so... Stupidly embarassing lol
---
Lullaby is a shit perk.  
---
You may think it's good, but even if you discard how hard it is to proc Devour Hope procs by same action and gives you oneshots and Mori, which is much more effective and helps with defending totems.  
---
And again, Devour Hope is still not used because people destroy totems.
---
Popular person bad, Fornite Streamer bad!
---
Yes?
---
Folks are acting like this is somehow a sacred community that can't have bigger personalities bringing attention to it or else the sanctity of the game will be ruined.
---
They werent talking to him, and at least two ppl spoke russian there so whats the problem with them communicating with each other?
---
I would expect such a response from someone who's active in r/memes and r/teenagers
---
Got it first attempt in purple with Legion Pin (Broken status one) and Never Sleep Pills. 
---
I usually didn't chase down new prey with FF unless they seem close or there's multiple. 
---
The broken snowball should work eventually.
---
Laughs in old insta saw with tinker
---
Cyberpunk Nea is underrated
---
Oh, so Devour Hope, a perk designed around leaving the hook to gain tokens, is designed to camp? And how does Ruin and Third Seal encourage camping? Hag herself doesn't even encourage camping, just placing traps and leaving so you can quickly teleport back if the unhooker triggers the trap. No killer has been made from the ground up with camping in mind, efficient camping has just been an unintended side effect of their powers.
---
I'm just trying to run a business here.
---
Honestly with how much DLC and what not is ok the game and having played it since the PC Beta I think the game should he free to play. Especially if they are gonna keep adding more stuff like the rift.
---
Spicy
---
Na, in getting head on'd
---
Honestly IDC what way anyone swings in a game... I main David shirtless here for the enjoyment of guys and gals
---
Rick and Morty reference... Nice
---
Puppers is soooo toxic
---
Fellow killers, do you like more when survivors let them smack you at the gates or when they just leave?
---
Hmm. I had a Legion facecamp me to death for mindgaming the shit out of him. I looped for like 4-5 min minimum but he caught me because bloodlust and Shelter Woods is a shit map. And the last gen gets as I get put on the hook. I’d didn’t teabag him or anything, he chose to tunnel me so I just embarrassed him until he finally got lucky. And then killers wonder why survivors use DS, BT, Adrenaline etc. He picked me up ASAP after I got unhooked no BT or DS unfortunately
---
Shut the fuck with your gatekeeping
---
4 out of 5 games where I flashlight/pallet save a teammate, I'll get face camped. Last time me and the Bill I pallet saved were called "cancerous" in the endgame chat by an Oni who facecamped both of us in the basement after the occurance. Killers get super pissed off when you do one of those.
---
Rotational Head: when a survivor performs an action behind you and within 12/16/20 meters, you get an audio notification. 
---
I think it’s cool. Idk. Reminds me of her head snap thing
---
(Cries in deep no life I only have 39,279 hours on it)
---
Console I assume?
---
Flashlight clicking is the most misterious shit survivors do for me, if they are behind some loop i can know exactly where they are and dorsnt give them anything so i am just so confused of them basically helping me kill them
---
That's exactly the point. It's a challenge 😂 one that I rarely succeed
---
dude one time I made the mistake of sacrificing myself for a last minute unhook then realized afterwards the bill’s username was “true klansman” 
---
the only time I’ve ever regretted dying for an unhook
---
Lets not talk about the FPS games shall we.
---
He’s not very good at all right now but if he takes it seriously he will probably dominate.
---
Guess I must have.
---
doesn't seem very perfect to me
---
Thanks for the feedback man! :)
---
Yeah, I think I talked a little too much about teachables/ shrine of secrets. I thought it would be good to mention it just in case you're completely new to the game but if you're searching for a guide on a perk you would probably know the basics. I might do it for every video but I will probably just go through the basics of it instead. 
---
"Reading something and then saying what it does when it's clear feels weird". Are you referring to when I read out the description of the perk then after I gave a explanation of it? I thought it would be a good idea to kinda give a dumb down explanation of it after just in case it doesn't make sense but I get your point.
---
Once again thanks for the feedback! As for adding memes into it all, how should I go about that?
---
That's an ugly ass hoodie ngl
---

Its when you touch the pigs nose... you just walk up and are like... boop the snoot.

---
I dont get how putting op in almost every single thumbnail relates to that but ok
---
See, this is a good post. Worth.
---
Not necessarily a "fun" one, but a meta build would go something like Ruin + Sloppy Butcher + Thanatophobia + Discordance/BBQC. As legion you almost get a free first hit, and with SB + Thana survivors have to decide whether to spend a long time healing, or do everything slower and be 1-shot.
---
And Billy, Freddy.
---
Dude just wants credit for having biggest brain in the game.
---
outplayed
---
No Mither + Unbreakable + Tenacity + Dead Hard. Love this build.
---
I'm trying to save up blood points so I'm not spending any getting items for my main, so I threw plunderers and axe on. So far I'm happy!
---
He needs to go back to whence he came
---
I actually asked him myself about it and he responded that he didnt have anything else to put in that part of the thumbnail....which is like kind of dumb but its what he said
---
yeah, like if instead of being injured you were just “exposed” for the entire match. I guess that doesn’t fit the lore though, so...
---
This is probably going to get flagged for naming someone out or something. But with that being said the typical "negative color pallet bunch of red arrows pointing at everything" video icon is far too typical for Dead by Daylight. I blame Ochido like I do for a lot of things.
---
That being said: OP?????
---
I hust checked, pallets and heals are the same button. All actions besides picking up items are the same for me and theres no way to change it.
---
It does. Just doesnt say it in the description of the perk
---
Weird thanks for the info
---
Love this.  Might have to do something similar!
---
Microsoft publisher
---
Sooo what did you expect them to do?  Also its YOU who decides to heal them or not ..
---
God I remember my first pity hatch. It was against a Pig at a low rank so of course the other players were being toxic and teabagging. Now I don't wanna sound like a braggy little bitch but I swear I was the only survivor doing gens and saving other survivors. Finally I got downed and I set my controller down thinking, what's the point. Color me surprised when, after everything, the Piggy gave me the hatch.
---
They sent me a friend request later. It was a good day at the end.
---
I would say it's not that deep man.
---
Well that’s a bit redundant, you will make no noise ever, recover very fast infinitely and crawl at the speed of sound. Nice.
---
On some promotional art or something I'm pretty sure. It was for that wraith and nurse outfit that makes them look like they just stepped out of an Opera.
---
I understand that self-care is extremely contentious, but I feel like some of the hate is disproportionate. 
---
- Teammate healing you: 16 seconds. You and teammate are both off a gen, so it’s 32 non-gen seconds in total
---
- Self care: 32 seconds alone
---
I get that it’s easier to be interrupted part way through self care but it’s balanced by the increased independence
---
They could work like Hag traps but instead of putting them on the ground you put them in lockers and they head on stun anyone who gets too close.
---
Can I actually know how many hours you have? Lol
---
I play Ghosty on console and I think I'm pretty good. I can definitely get to rank 1 if I really wanted to- but personally I don't see a point to it. staying at high ranks makes it easier to do challenges imo. but, with that being said... Congratulations!
---
no mither just makes adrenaline way more situational than it already is, since usually you’d get value from injured or dying state or being pulled off the hook, making it worth a slot. but pairing it with no mither cuts its potential down by more than half, on top of reducing the likelihood that you’ll ever be slugged assuming the killer’s been playing this years-old game for more than a few months. 
---
unbreakable isn’t as bad bc of the faster pickup time, but it’s still doubling down on the assumption that the killer will ever actually slug someone clearly running no mither. even if they do, it’ll likely be incredibly rare, and they would have to be really, really out of it to let you pick yourself up twice. it happens, but not often enough to necessarily justify two perk slots. 
---
unless you’re memeing, anyway, which, if you’re running no mither, you almost definitely are, so whatever lol
---
(Gets accused of faking afk hours)
---
Fyi you're getting downvotes because you're 100% wrong.
---
Idk man. In one of his head on vids 2 of the killers he faced were 100% new. I mean one them tried to pick up 2 survivors at once cmon. He almost never shows the endcard. But it could also be matchmakings fault.
---
Demogorgon can do this with ease, Hag can do so with add-ons and Freddy can do it if there's a gen nearby.
---
Can I have the receipt to return the “prize”
---
I play killer unless I am doing Rift stuff. I like to play on hard mode ha ha.
---
That’s not true at all. Every game community I’ve been on it’s a debate on if genned Pokémon are legal (even though they have the same stats and nothing from them is changed or modified to get an advantage... thanks a lot verlisify) or wether blowing up mc and bunker businesses count as griefing because “the game told me to do it”  every single community you’ll find a group of people arguing about everything. Dbd is not special in that way.
---
Hell yeah! Add me, my name is the same as reddit
---
beautiful! thank you
---
Who tf was talking about Pokémon and Minecraft
---
Point was every single game/show/whatever fights about dumb shit... what was so hard to understand
---
Am i like tge only person that would hate penny be in dbd? Like dont get me wrong but his dumb ass is stronger than the entity according to books, he is some space shit just as the entity. And what could his power be exactly? Give ppl jumpscares? Seems kinda like doc. Have small terror radius at the start but get "fear" from survivors?  Thats michael. It all just isnt logical to have a pennywise here and in the time of rumors about it i was like oh god please let that be not penny and some original killer. The terrifier is kinda clown but teleporting tho, but even he is more fitting to the entity in my opinion.
---
i didnt think it was that hard to understand but he just doesnt understand what the difference between OP and good is
---
Fuck Neas
---
This is my problem with him too. It's very annoying and reminds me of those clickbait kid channels on YouTube lol.
---
They don’t fight as much as we do
---
What a scumbag. I'm sorry you died for him, he deserves every match to be a bad one.
---
Can’t speak for all Claudettes, but I roll with the light weight perk and would rather run to safety (leaving lower-risk quickly disappearing marks) and heal myself to free you up to go get back to gens. If I’m filling a spot for a perk to heal myself, I’m likely going to take advantage of it. 
---
BUT I definitely assess whether the threat is immediate, and if you tag me to try and heal I’ll usually comply. God help you if you mess up that skill check on me though.
---
**BHVR**: You know what? You are right... LETS GIVE NEA A FULL HEAD OF LONG HAIR!
---
absolutely. he also has an obnoxious big ego and is constantly reminding his viewers that he is good at the game if he ever does badly. he also is the absolute least deserving person of being a fog whisperer. a few months ago he made a joke about disabled people on twitter. whenever someone questions his antics he writes them off and ignores what they say. while responding to both otz and scott at different times he was talking over them while their videos played to basically ignore their valid points. [this thread](https://twitter.com/TrU3Ta1ent/status/1204915183522590721?s=19) where he brings up a "bad experience" of tofu for no reason at all and plays it off as if he's "chill" always brings out a laugh. speaking of his twitter, he argues with the most random people who question his playstyle every day, and its clear that he really cares what people think of him when he claims he doesnt. i realize that i have been typing this for very long and im not sure who will care but i could not agree more with this post.
---
No?  Some ppl like to touch their movement keys and stop the healing. I will try 3 times to heal somebody, if they still wont stop moving, i will leave them . So annoying
---
Wholesome family fun!
---
???
---
Also it’s a meme
---
For a second I thought he was gonna get infinite trapped in his bear trap or something, but honestly nice. Solid waiting to proc adrenaline right off hook.
---
Oh really? Those are usually funny. Thanks for showing me one that’s not
---
"and one of my sisters boyfriends"
---
...wait
---
He puts ops in the thumbnail because he has nothing else to put in that empty spot of the thumbail. I asked him about it myself and thats what he replied with.
---
When Ghostface is in stealth, he can stalk you and give you Exposed. When you look at him, he gets put out of stealth. I was staring at him and nothing happened.
---
So you're a toxic dick and part of the reason dbd is dying? Cool!
---
Are you hiding your aunt's body?
---
Love it.  Love everything about it.
---
Boyfriend, not boyfriends
---
Wait a minute
---
I bet your real fun at party’s
---
Shared this biopsy yesterday on another post, it’s the one I use.
---
Dying Light, Hex: Ruin, Thanatophobia, and Stridor using his Stolen Sketchbook and Legion Pin (rare add-ons). Point of the build is to get everyone broken with feral frenzy because of the Legion Pin, you’re guaranteed to have Thanatophobia active and once you start hooking people it slows the game down even slower because of Dying Light. You’ll here everyone who is injured because of Stridor even if they’re using Iron Will.
---
Side note: Sloppy Butcher doesn’t work with Legion’s power and using his Basic attack takes away his power, hence why I don’t use it.
---
That's like saying playing with perks isn't a requirement. Yes, you can take off all your perks when you play DBD. You don't "have" to play with perks. But when it puts you at such a blatant disadvantage, why would you?
---
No
---
straight out of every horror movie
---
You can only grab while vaulting if they’re injured
---
Yikes I bet you’re the one that tries to make jokes and everyone just laughs out of pity
---
See really that's all I want is for people to assess the situation first
---
How dare he
---
Real clever
---
Ugh, I hate Pengu. One of the most annoying and absolutely pointless cartoons. I am so glad my son stopped watching it...
---
&gt;your emblems wouldn't go down either.
---
Is time spent near healthy survivors not counted for that emblem or something?
---
dont think that fits games like csgo or rust
---
this is pretty hecking stupid. you're the reason the community is so toxic. you only pay attention to the negative and shout at a small team of developers about how their game is shit when you still play it. They're doing their best and love constructive criticism. this is not it. this is not helping. please stop
---
Everybody gangsta till the aunt starts speeding
---
Yea they are pretty toxic to
---
So younge plague with a new version of vomit?
---
Tbh sometimes it’s better to heal them, sometimes it’s better to split after hook and let them self heal, and sometimes it’s best not to heal at all.  It really depends on the situation of the game.
---
Same here, rank 10 and getting 2-4 SWF on console, back to back games of these people. Not touching killer until these problems are figured out.
---
If anything they'd put the priest that got possessed and died at the end of the first film. Probably have a call on pazuzu perk that reveals auras of survivors that are within close proximity to at least one other survivor to callback to the claustrophobic nature of the film.
---
I know that BHVR has openly indicated that there are issues with matchmaking, but I wonder if some of the issue is that the active survivor game population is mostly at red/purple rank, especially with the current rank reset system. You can't "fix" the skill distribution of a gaming population if there are fewer players at certain skill levels.
---
It’s because it’s easier for survivors to rank up on top of swf matchmaking using the highest ranked player. They’re a so few people in low ranks now. It’s only going to get worse as rank reset only resets you one crest color, for some this means literally only 1 level (maybe even 1 pip). They need to revert these changes.
---
Excuse my grammar, my mom is driving
---
I HATE the swamp map😭
---
That’s gay
---
Lol I was for like one game that day, usually I just try to practice my running so that I can stay viable with various builds. Besides, I don't play like that anymore, got tired of feeling gross.
---
I've been having fun using Enduring and Spirit Fury. Get pallet stun to get out of your power quicker and if you have spirit fury you can deep wound stab someone get stunned and immediately down them.
---
I’m half way to getting him for shards and I’m not sure if I should buy him or the security guard cosmetic for David, which I think is super clean. I know that Legion is great for BP farming exactly for the reasons you said, but with all the people clamoring for him to be reworked I feel like the shards (aka the time grinding for the shards) will be wasted when BHVR eventually does do a rework and potentially eliminate his farming potential.
---
New survivor: OP
---
&gt;he thinks that he has the record for the most escapes in a row (around 90 escapes)
---
Which... he does, doesn't he? Nobody's claiming he has the most solo escapes in a row.
---
&gt;In my eyes, to get the record for most escapes, you can't be in a SWF.
---
So you'd rather someone play like a selfish dick for this award than cooperate with friends? Anyone could- hypothetically- slap on Sole Survivor, Left Behind, and Object and hide in lockers all game. How is that more impressive?
---
what does it mean
---
Every game he plays he goes against bad killers who he just bully’s so I stopped watching him
---
Some explanation is welcome but sometimes the explanation sounds almost the same as the perk description, in which case it could've been skipped
---
about memes, if you don't know how to go about it, don't. Forced memes are rarely good
---
wow now I finally know. I always just went to settings and toggled inversion off and on again
---
why tf is that a bound button?
---
Any links? Kinda wanna see it now
---
Since when? I’ve grabbed healthy survivors while they vaulted before.
---
why? shorter is better for loops
---
Third Seal + Infectious Fright + Monitor &amp; Abuse + 1 (Barbecue/Ruin/Thrill Of The Hunt/Knock Out/...) + Frenzy duration add-ons - you try to spread Third Seal as early as possible, with which Monitor and duration add-ons help a lot. Then you slug.
---
Blood Echo is a cool perk to use on Legion. Pairs well with Barbecue so you can find your next target after every hook and basically don't have to worry about Exhaustion perks anymore. Bloodhound has synergy with Blood Echo too, but Bloodhound's just not good. Duration add-ons are good here again, since you want as many people as possible to be injured. The Broken and Mangled Pin add-ons aren't half-bad here neither.
---
Ruin + Bamboozle + Enduring + Spirit Fury is the most "competitive" Legion build, in my opinion. Pair with Cold Dirt + Joey's Mixtape. Can replace Enduring and Spirit Fury with stuff like Barbecue, Brutal and Weasel, too.
---
She’s a ***STOOPID***

I don't think we should see this as a negative thing. He's bringing in a lot of new people to this community, just like ST,  and we should welcome them with open arms :)

I think the whole dedicated servers desync situation deserves a mention in your list. I remember that I was actually looking forward to it when they announced it. Oh boy I was so naive.
---
Add on: Heads Up
---
Legion members placed in lockers no longer attack nearby survivors but perform head on stuns if a survivor passes them during a chase.
---
Add on: Teleport
---
The Legion can teleport between lockers. Reduces the number of Legion members by 3.
---
Add on: Moonwalker
---
The Legion can spawn a legion member in the open. The Legion member will run towards any survivor within 12 meters. Reduces the number of Legion members by 2.

the joke is how Self-Care is 100% useless no matter what with No Mither, but both Adrenaline and Unbreakable are still usable with No Mither. There are several other perks that could've better been used to convey this joke.
---
Out of curiosity would you then also agree that DCing against an ebony Mori, iri hatchet huntress would be ok and understandable?

Well its is 4.4 years and the game hasn't been out that long soooo

Dunno if you could grab healthy survivors when the game first came out, but it’s been this way for a long time.

That’s not an alt u freakin idiot

how could i prove that im not an alt?
---
That’s odd. Maybe it’s cause it was a slow vault?but thanks for the information!
---
fix it
---
Playing the game is OP guys.
---
at least for them it is just specific skins. Imagine how Claudette mains feel.
---
Alright thank you!
---
Recently saw a video of his on Freddy against an SWF. The whole game he complained about the players' ability to cooperate despite complete, demonstrated lack of individual skill.
---
When the game ended, the SWF was 3 greens and a red. And he calls them smurfs. Completely fails to see the irony.
---
Just as the icing on the cake, he spends the entire endgame collapse facecamping someone on hook while whining about losing points for camping. Like his strategy of staring at someone until they die should be rewarded gameplay.
---
Why would he even upload that mess? Completely put me off Tru3.
---
I'd be fine with LGBTQ characters in a game if the LGBTQ community doesn't start going we need X sexuality in the game. When that starts happening it gets annoying because then there's one side all "It's just a game it doesn't matter about the lore" and the other is like "We need more inclusion in this game!!!"
---
I agree. I hit rank 1 on survivor and I do NOT deserve it. I just play semi-efficiently. I don’t think I belong anywhere near the top tier. But hell you would think I would get lucky and face some red rank potatoes. But it seems like I am just facing sweatstacks of survivors that think being Seal Team Six is more fun than just playing the game.
---
Stfu, if ur gonna cross platform do it the right way and dont leave out pc, pc holds close to 0 advantage, and if u think they do ur just a scrub with excuses ;) besides I wanna play with my buds on xbox and we need to get over this co sole separation bs
---
Huh it must be so convenient that he doesn’t any post history and only two comments. One of them being the thing he just commented. He just happened to comment on this exact post. At least try to make it less obvious
---
OP? OP.
---
Fine 3 years 6 months 8 days and 5 hours
---
I mean that's kinda the point, I swear Ace with Iron Will can be more elusive than p3 claudette sometimes lol
---
All dbd youtubers do these awful thumbnails for views.
---
And then I throw him on the hook and camp him.
---
Before I even look it up I'm assuming that's how long the game has been out
---
Except for a day and a half less
---
 &gt;mocking low-rank survivors for playing badly
---
 &gt; complaining that low-rank survivors are smurfs
---
I hear it too at random times. I think it’s just part of the ambient map sounds. I know that’s what it is but sometimes I’ll still check around me anyway. Kind of annoying but whatever
---
I don't normally play her but I really wanted to do that once xD
---
Thank you for not making me look that up
---
i often felt like i was too focused on by the killer back when i, you know, cared about surviving
---
You are welcome
---
It’s a domino effect too because on top of it already being easy for survivor to rank up, it’s doubled because you’re facing low rank killers since they can’t rank up as easily and they’re deranking because they’re facing high race survivors. I’d say 80% of my red rank matches have green rank killers.
---
This comment is literally two months old lmao wtf
---
I mean, he's just annoying. But he appeals to a younger audience so of course half this community would find him agitating to watch.
---
I'm just gonna say he's new, if he decides to stick around and play of course he'll begin to understand what killers are weak and which are strong. But right now I say take what he says about the game with a grain of salt and just kind of enjoy the possible influx of new players which may lessen the wait times a bit for certain ranks.
---
Before someone says "oh but they'll be toxic fortnite kids" they're kids... Are you really gonna bash on a 12 year old or will you just accept they make stupid choices and move on like the mature person you supposedly are, this community is filled with toxicity, maybe some new players will freshen up the perspective and make us ease up a bit
---
Even though people say Legion is weak I like playing against him as they are generally chill people or sometimes just want to max out hunting,brutality and deviousness and maybe get full bbq stacks and let everyone go (atleast that's what I go for whenever I play as him)
---
probably an invisible wall obstacle between u and him because of the enclosed space. safer to stare at him from a more open area
---
U don’t have to post to be on reddit
---
That's why I wish more people would just take a few seconds to assess the situation
---
Thats like every dbd youtuber, esp survivor games. They always talk so obnoxious.
---
I have DbD on xbox so I don't actually have any idea how many hours devotion 39 is but I'm going to guess 9,800
---
Oh of course. Pupper daddy is sooooo toxic.
---
I hope he sees the light in Reddit again. We want him on our side
---
The fact that you’re trying so hard to convince me isn’t helping either... just stop I’d admit it’s an alt Lmao
---
Honestly even if this never happened I'd like the other members of legion to just be there on the map hanging out. I remember one comment on this subreddit suggesting them just doing random shit like sitting/leaning on hooks, standing on the roof of the shack, chilling in the basement etc. Not harming the survivors in anyway, just there as part of the scenery watching the player do their trial.
---
Devotion is levels every 100
---
This has never happened to me, the idea that a survivor would let me hook them because their team is stomping me instead of waiting to teabag at the exit sounds ludicrous on its face.  
---
Let me put it this way, there are plenty of videos of killers giving people the hatch, I have never once seen someone give a killer a hook who wasn't farming.
---
it makes you as fast as walking doesn't it? so anytime you'd walk you can now crouch
---
Am aware
---
So I shouldn’t be trying to prove u wrong
---
Is it? That only difference I found between console and pc red ranks are harder great skill checks because of frames and less Huntress, Nurse, and Oni.
---
I am*
---
Gotta slap on that iron will
---
you didnt answer the question
---
I understand you perfectly, in ps4 that slight auto-aim is bullshit, it happens to me many times with survivors who run in zigzag the auto-aim goes crazy and you fail the attacks when you are sure that you do well :/
---
Also because killer is harder but the masses of survivor mains don’t understand it.
---
And all of the sudden you respond...how convenient.
---
[Here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpeirR0lGTU)
---
One eye on the survivors, one eye on those sweet, sweet clock cycles. I like my CPUs like I like my SWFs: **optimal.**
---
Well now I want the joker as a killer. I doubt he'd be willing to do anyone's bidding besides his own though.
---
Ur not very good at this
---
Yeah, I play on xbox and it happens all the time, the survivor is right in front of you but auto-aim throws your camera to the side
---
Lol, you guys let a rank 20 perkless clown camp you into the hatch? How useless was your team? If you don't have every gen done by the time the second survivor is camped into struggle you aren't really trying.
---
Right? My first thought when I read this post was plag
---
Nice
---
For the love of fuck just break the pallet.
---
Holy shit are you Sherlock gnomes because you suck at this
---
And you’re still trying to convince me. That’s your problem if you want to make it seem realistic: 
---
1 post more things with your alt and comment more 
---
2 never acknowledge from your main account that your alt is an alt. 
---
3 don’t offer to show proof that they’re not an alt that just makes it worse
---
Butcheredmemes
---
Not a fan of the mask, but I did love that show. Season 3 was... Mildly Ok-ish.
---
I play mostly survivor but i got tons of hours on killer aswell.
---
1. Spirit: I can't stand facing spirits. I hate it so much i usually dc, i know, scummy move but i wanna have fun when i play the game. (My favorite is killer to play is the Wraith and the one i like facing the most is the Huntress)
---
2. Doctor: For some reason when i meet a Doctor they really like to proxy camp and i find that annoying as heck. 
---
3. Wraith: As a Wraith main i know how strong Wraith really can be. It's rare to find someone playing Wraith but when you do find one there is a 90% chance it's a Wraith main and he just came to mess up your day.
---
1.  Kate: Kate seems to be the 50/50 survivor. They are either 100% potato and has no clue what they are doing or they are 100% loop god and runs me around the whole map until no gens are left.
---
2. Meg: Megs are weird, for some reason most of them run Urban and crawls around during the whole game, they always use SB and are usually potatos. I would expect to see more Neas with Urban but it's always the Megs.
---
3. Yui: They always have some annoying names like "uwu" or "insert favorite anime character here". They are usually semi good but thinks they are hot shit that deserves to trash talk every single game.
---
Maps
---
1. Ironworks of Misery: As a killer it's not fun. As a survivor it's not fun because it's always so easy. The infinite is so so strong.
---
2. The Game: This map is not for for killers or survivors. Even after over 700 hours i still can't make my way though it.
---
3. The Underground Complex: Same reason as The Game but i can actually tell where i'm going on this map.
---
The only item that makes me annoyed is the tool box.
---
1. Shroud of Binding: You are legit making it easier for the killer to win the game.
---
2. Any Mori: Mori as a offering should not be a thing. It's fine with things like Devour hope but like i said, it should not be an offering.
---
3. Shroud of Union: Same reason as number 1 but not as bad.
---
Yeah I’ve been playing survivor all day and not one killer ive had was around my teams level. Its shitty. Always feel the need to say sorry to them because the games end up one sided as hell. Hope they fix it soon though...
---
Like your grammer???
---
Also that’s my friend and we r laughing at u so hard rn
---
DBD community: We need more players. 
---
*Ninja plays DBD*
---
DBD community: omg fuck this guy REEEEE
---
I just don't lunge anymore
---
That's sweet as Hell, even if it's pink XD Awesome dad
---
yeah russians usually have both keyboards easily accessible &amp; know the latin alphabet so they probably don’t think of the fact that english-speakers won’t usually be able to copy cyrillic
---
So what you are saying is.... The grab bug doesn't still exist after months of patches? How about the Hags Desyncing camera? How about false hits making lunges a 50-50 gamble when they should easily hit, Clearly Dedicated Servers were turned off when they said they would, and weren't kept on and are causing severe problems every other game.
---
This guy is right They are an amateur team struggling to keep up with the demand of their game. The clues are literally everywhere. How about the project lead that was also their writer for the longest time? C'mon now. Liking the game is one thing. it's a fun game. But see things for what they are.
---
Good for you? I mean it was obvious that account was related to you.
---
I have literally seen people in these reddit threads be more toxic about Ninja than I have seen toxic shit about Ninja in the last 6 months.
---
no. not anymore
---
F
---
You clearly have no idea how this killer works
---
Old or not still applies considering we still dont have cross platform xD, if ppl think that leaving pc out is a good idea itll bite them in the butt, already takes forever to find a game ok xbox, more platforms means more players :D means we can all keep the game alive alot longer
---
But ghost face is easy
---
this is america they should speak american gdi
---
Holy shit you cracked the case I’ve lost the because you found out that we know each other ):
---
Lmaoo
---
I’ve never seen someone actually do this lol
---
 Church mass is Sunday
---
Mangled makes Self Care take more than half a gen, and a lot of things Mangle now.
---
Oof don’t be sad because I insulted your shitty meme so you had to bring your friend to get valuation
---
Okay father I’ve been very naughty you know *licks lips*
---
eeee- I think you've explained this better than anyone. thank.
---
I liked it this way but I get what you mean
---
Wraith and Nurse.
---
Bamboozled.
---
Personally I like using Ruin, BBQ, Thana, and Pop Goes the Weasel. Add the sketchbook and mangled pin add-on too!
---
Who's complaining?
---
 Where did I mention player skill in this message?
---
If the survivors are bad then you will get them anyways, so what's the problem?
---
grammar*
---
*validation
---
I didn’t tell my friend to back me up I told him to see how stupid u are being
---
Sure bud
---
Okay? Do you want me to say I main Legion? or should I say a high tier? Spirit? nah- scrap that. I main survivor
---
If this is true that's complete horse shit from the developer...
---
I don't understand how stream sniping is a thing when there is a delay?
---
Wtf is that supposed to mean
---
Ace mains are usually the good ones tbh. Use that built in Iron Will lol.
---
Yeah, the Meg was smart. This was not a SWF so i'm glad Meg understood i might have Adrenaline. Maybe it was accidental but it's not like it matters haha.
---
what tf is your playstyle that this happens to you often enough to merit a perk slot *and* wasted time? self-imposed solo queue sandbag tournament?
---
Under the stairs?
---
😆 wow how long did it take you to come up with that one.
---
Noice 😂
---
90% walking speed iirc
---
I’ll let you figure that out or maybe have your other friend explain it to you
---
Yeah I love these ideas but the way they've marketed Legion thus far makes their likelihood of happening quite low
---
- Teammate healing you with mangled: 19.2 seconds. You and teammate are both off a gen, so it’s **38.2 non-gen seconds in total**
---
- Self care: **38.2 seconds alone**
---
Gens take **80 seconds** to solo repair. 
---
Doesn’t matter if you heal with a teammate or self care, it’s still a total of 38.2 seconds off a gen. Two people on a gen lower efficacy so it takes 44.4 seconds, not 40 seconds to duo a gen.
---
Yeah but I always mistake them for other survivors
---
[deleted]
---
Are you fucking Shadow the Hedgehog?? Jesus dude lmao
---
If you're just doing a character, I love it. Keep up the good work.
---
Always satisfying to see a Face Camper get beat
---
The return of the Ash
---
I'm not even mad, that was fucking legendary lmao
---
12 matches for your first Tier each day.
---
You gonna put a smile on his face, Leto? haha
---
Huntress, Spirit, sorta the Clown
---
yeah, this is where the hate comes from. sloppy, mangled addons, plus the fact that so many killers have 1shot ability or are otherwise borderline pointless to heal against (e.g. legion) and the fact that nurse’s is very meta. it’s not just about self care in a vacuum.
---
very funny, subscribed
---
Oh thanks man, appreciate it
---
One thing I've gathered from testing is that it doesn't work if the EGC started before the last sacrifice completed. Did you close hatch or were the gates open?
---
I mean...if there’s an invisible obstacle between the two players, all that does is highlight the issue OP is pointing out. It’s complete bullshit that didn’t reveal GF, he is blatantly staring right at him.
---
&gt;  in turn always have Deep Wounds going down for survivors no matter what.
---
So old Legion?
---
How clever
---
Oops I guess not sorry
---
Personally i would rather be able to get him out of stealth when i'm looking right at him anywhere.
---
i closed the hatch after I hooked the final survivor. so I basically fucked myself with that one
---
I refuse to open the door unless someone is running towards it with the killer behind them. I am blood warden paranoid
---
 Now this was a ballsy move
---
Listen here asshole, your not the smartest chip in the bag so how about get a fucking education and come back when you know what’s up.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
:0 no way you brought your whole squad? Do you guys swf too?
---
This guy has never played a MOBA before
---
My criticism: it's a picture of spirit
---
I'm getting the fucking boat, we need another flood
---
Yes, but not in the way you think. Almost all maps released in chapters have a golden toolbox Easter egg hidden in them. They can’t be picked up or anything, but they’re just kind of neat. Yes they exist, no they can’t be used.
---
You can still tell where survivors are, where the killer is going, you still gain an advantage. you can set a delay, but if you don't, and it leads only like, five seconds, you gain a big advantage.
---
I think it's more used if you're good for looping the killer, otherwise you will attract killer either to a gen or into no man's land just to distract them, not really good for stealth for that reason
---
Yeah, memes like these are supposed to be rooted in truth otherwise they aren't really as funny.
---
I'm going to have to make a post about this. Red is over filled (most survivors are in red, from 100 hrs played to 1600). It also includes players of all skill levels. You're essentially just playing an unranked mode. It's not unfair, there's just no matchmaking whatsoever atm.
---
Doesn’t matter if you heal with a teammate or use self-care, it’ll still take 38.2 seconds off a gen in total to heal through managed. 
---
I know that sometimes healing isn’t the best option regardless how you do it, but people focus their hate on self care and not teammate healing.
---
How do you get there?
---
Idk who tf this guy is all I know is that he has an iq of over 4 so he realizes how fucking stupid u are
---
lol maybe because "sure bud" isnt a real response
---
I mean, sure, you should've broken him out eventually. But just standing there with little options is pretty dumb.
---
You’re still trying to convince me that you didn’t bring your friends to back you up huh?
---
Random =/= Funny
---
Bhvrs balance team making legion even lower than low tier
---
Can we all stop pretending people have to follow our personal rules?
---
U were trying to prove my post wrong but by what your saying makes me think it’s right
---
I guess In hindsight yeah, but it doesn't really matter that much.
---
None of your 3 viewers are stream sniping you.
---
you can’t pull survivors off vaults if they’re not injured
---
....I can’t believe I have to say this but not all the killers are toxic and not all survivors are toxic. Just because some killers are toxic doesn’t mean they’re the same ones that complain about survivors being toxic or maybe they are we’ll never know so why make assumptions like this ones
---
Matters plenty. You stayed at the corner, then you stood still inside. You could've gone upstairs to a pallet, or started the god loop in that building.
---
I'm the same way basically. I'll give pretty big hints for a few seconds that I'm trying to heal them then if they don't pick up on the hints then I'm out lol
---
Who said anything about his stream?
---
Thx for the constructive criticism instead of saying that I’m wrong like this other dipshit
---
Object is a very VERY strong perk but it's not the kind of perk you wanna run when you wanna hide all game. This perk is for the bold that wanna know where the killer is at all times. Players can decide what the best action is just by looking at what the killer is doing. For example: If the killer is chasing someone you wanna do generators or save teammates. This is the best information perk in the game and would just be a waste in a stealth build as most stealth players are not in a SWF and would rather not loop the killer.
---
How do you use self care correctly? I stopped using it a while ago because it seemed like a waste
---
Just only look into the killers direction if he isnt looking to you
---
Ah you're welcome!
---
Iron will is amazing
---
All good
---
There's a new one. 
---
If you run in front of the killer while they carry a survivor, you can squat under the hook. Doing this keeps you directly under the hooked survivor and the killer can't hit you. If they try, they'll hit the hooked survivor and suffer a hit cooldown. During the hit cooldown, you can unhook the survivor with Borrowed Time and both of you get away.
---
But this new Hook Tech is easily countered by the killer just not swinging. They'll have a survivor hooked, another one crouching under the hook, and won't lose any emblem progress because they're technically not camping.
---
Okay I get i'm stupid lol, that's not what the post is about though.
---
The problem is, as a survivor on PS4, you'll almost never escape
---
Haha, I love it
---
Isn't stealth meant to be used so the killer *doesn't* see you? Object literally tells the killer exactly where you are. That's why it isn't used for stealth, but definitely for looping.
---
Idk these people, but I do know you’re a dumbass
---
O
---
So satisfying.
---
Not from a Jedi.
---
Why did he spell ninja with an y in the trapper thumbnail
---
How convenient that you never made a post on this subreddit or even commented on it... yet out of all the post here you decided to comment on this very one
---
I feel less resistant on calling this one an exploit vs. the one that was patched because the old hook tech you could still get injured/down through if done wrong. 
---
Kinda interesting tho
---
¿OP?
---
Haha yes, I'm so sneaky
---
Just take a break. Nothing wrong with that. I haven’t played survivor consistently in like 2 weeks or so. It burns out quicker than killer does, but I don’t think it’s some unplayable nightmare. A break will definitely help you out. Enjoy playing killer and go back to playing SWF in a little while.
---
Did they show his face after he had used the mask? I often have horror Marathons, but I don't think I have watched a Halloween movie that old.
---
No matter how hard I look at the video I see.no toolboxes of any kind.
---
Well, thank YOU for not taking offense to my criticism, kind sir.
---
et tu, Brute?!
---
Maybe try Civilization.
---
Actually though, just take a break. I though the game was boring for over 7 months until i started enjoying it again.
---
You literally said "Is trapper punished for placing his trap incorrectly?" so I've answered that question that yes he does, and you asked "Does he have a long timer between placing his traps?" and I've answered that in a way he does since he has to walk around the map to get his power in the first place. Both of those are downsides.
---
With Legion you have a cooldown between uses of his power &amp; if you use your power incorrectly you will get punished. How's it any different? If you had to go around the map to pick up your frenzy power up you'd have the same problem.
---
&gt;no matter how well you play
---
If you are using your power incorrectly as you've mentioned in that question then it is affected by how well you play, no?
---
&gt;still lose the ability to down
---
Because Legion's power does a completely different thing than Trapper's and being able to down during it would be stupid? That's kinda why original Legion is stuffed in some shallow grave at some garbage dump and nobody who understands why he was awful for the game wants him back.
---
&gt;hell are even punished in even getting your power from regular M1's outside of it.
---
Yeah that's a valid point I have no idea why that's there. Imo since Legion's power can't down you anymore he should have like 5 second power recovery at max, just make the cooldown longer as a trade-off so the survivor can still make distance if you fuck up.
---
&gt;You still lose that baseline tracking, still had the long cooldowns and stuns
---
With Trapper you have to go around and pick them up to even have a power, and your stuff can be undone or sabotaged, something that isn't dependant on Trapper fucking up at all. It's just RNG. Trapper is like the 2nd most luck based character in the game, if things don't line up for him he doesn't have a power. Being  feast or famine is a downside to me too.
---
&gt;more downsides than trapper for sure
---
I'm not arguing Trapper's power is worse than Legion's, I'm saying that he too has plenty of downsides.
---
How convenient  that Christmas was last Wednesday and I got dbd. How fucking convenient is that I stumbled upon your dumbass comment and am proving you wrong... yet you still argue.
---
Well that too lol
---
Sure you did
---
&gt;You are the one who is trying to yoda 
---
I think you are taking this rng dependant goofy game way too seriously and I think you shouldn't. That's all I'm saying in my message.
---
&gt;Teabaging a player is rude. Middle finger at a person is rude. Same
---
One is real life, one is a videogame.

---
Same, I dont see shit
---
Well let's be honest there's no point in wiggling to begin with who cares if you get hooked in basement as last survivor
---
back at it again with these half-assed responses
---
(:
---
No need to be like this. This is not the OPs fault and you know that. OP is pointing out a massive flaw in the game and not anything else.
---
Works for me occasionally.
---
Mine is always peepee poopoo
---
But that's not the point of my message? It's not the topic at all?
---
Completely unrelated, but what is your profile pic from?
---
and how do you know where hes looking before looking at him?
---
As a David main who has bought the security guard outfit I personally think just full P3 David looks way better so I’d buy The Legion but yeah, either are good options
---
I find that to be very rare but if it works for you I can't argue.
---
&gt;fearmongers about specific streamers playing the game making the game more toxic

&gt;ceaselessly shittalks anything to do with this specific streamer and anybody who finds out about the game because of them

Thx
---
I play Fortnite and I've never met a "fortnite kid".
---
I think the closest I came to a Fortnite Kid was seeing some girl dancing on a sidewalk while I was driving home from work once lol
---
I kinda want his clown costume from when he was a kid tbh.
---
I play on mobile where progression is hard as hell
---
it’s also harder landing hits as killer bc frames
---
Eh? It's Darkeater Midir, from Dark Souls 3 DLC, The Ringed City. He's a bonus boss, and he's probably my favorite Dragon in the history of Dragons.
---
Look INSIDE the crate
---
That nea fucking ruined it, it could've been longer ;(
---
Cool.
---
What's the rework?
---
Wait what? Why? What did I do?
---
"200 IQ play" *is dropped beside the hatch*
---
They’re bringing it back to 90 degrees. Or so they said.
---
depends on the bucket
---
True. Still waiting for the 60 fps patch like promised 2 years ago...
---
Nah, thanks man im good
---
Oh you’re using that one again, it’s because you know you’re wrong you CumSponge
---
Just giving advice.
---
Aside from having a lot of pallets, the pallets are super safe against killers who try to trick survivors by doubling back.
---
Also, Autohaven maps are giant and mainly outdoors based. Being such a big map makes it hard for killers to walk around and quickly patrol the generators. Being an outdoor map hurts stealth killers because even though they can't be heard, they can still be seen.
---
A lot of the DBD community uses Nintendo tunes in all their videos. Surprised they aren’t striked by Nintendo tbh lmao
---
Yeah but a lot of people will decide to crouch everywhere they go instead of sprinting, so they waste a lot of time.
---
I'd love to play with you on PC as well. Steam name is same as here. :)
---
I don't really like the guy but I wouldn't mind getting some more players in the game and I don't think he's the worst considering some people in the DbD community
---
He really makes shitty plays and considers himself a god though. That 200 IQ escape plan was literally him getting dropped near the hatch
---
itsmp123 here
---
When I pull someone off a gen lmao.
---
What exactly am I looking at?
---
I mean I didnt until this comment
---
welp the more ya know
---
Yet when he gets stabbed in the back or hit with a pallet... HNNNGHHH. Lol
---
Mine too. Gorgeous art 😍
---
Hey did you get around to finishing them?
---
The thing is a lot of people have started just not healing much at all. So if that's your strategy, the ability to heal yourself is a waste of a perk.
---
And no one asked for your dumbass input either, yet here we are.
---
Makes me happy to see this.
---
Wait until you try mobile.
---
Well ain't that swell.
---
Why does it take so long for you though? My time to find a match as killer is roughly six minutes, and for survivor 1-2 minutes. And yes I know this is mobile
---
Funny how instead of an argument you attack his supposed viewer count. Speaks volumes about you.
---
Fortnite
---
That’s true, but I feel like if you’re not planning to heal no matter what then you’d know not to bring SC anyways
---
Laurie pulls his mask off in the first movie and he scrambles to put it back on. If you haven't seen the original Halloween film then you need to. It's a tad dated but still a really enjoyable watch.
---
I lost it when he was given a build by a viewer for Wraith 
---
That build was Ruin, Thanatophobia, Dying Light, and Sloppy Butcher with All Seeing Blood and a fast uncloack variant. He said the build was weak and it was costing him the win.
---
His "personalized" Wraith build is Ruin, Thanatophobia, Sloppy Butcher, and Nurse's Calling with Windstorm and a Bell Clapper variant.
---
Like, I get being given a build with some different components that hinder your prefered playstyle, but that viewer build didn't do that at all. 
---
And True routinely gets survivor builds from viewers that don't involve the chase aspect of the game but tries to be chased with those builds anyway and then claims that the builds are weak or worthless despite his complete failure to utilize the strengths of the build he's given.
---
If it brings enough popularity to the game to raise the budget and bring jaws to the game im happy.
---
Looks like a pretty basic DH to be honest
---
Oh I will then, I apologise for my earlier judgemental behavior. As we all know on this subreddit, behavior slips up from time to time.
---
Have you checked out Fungoose yet? He’s one of the best Dead by Daylight players I’ve ever seen, and his commentary is most of the time purely educational. I’ve learned more from him than any other streamer/Youtuber. You should really check his channel out.
---
Don't judge me too hard about NOED we didn't even get there
---
there was one suggestion for a crusader filled with rage (way before the oni) that would swap around armors. survivors couldn't move past the armor but they could temporary cleanse it so they could get through
---
It's pretty hard to DH to avoid something charging at you twice as fast as a sprinting billy, so it's a bit more impressive, especially since he started the DH after i lunged
---
I always think of killers being sweaty when like at the start of a round hes not tunneling or proxy camping hes patrolling gens and actively roaming the map until 3 gens are done and he completely stops trying to regress gens and will proxy camp people on the hook to guarantee a kill or a body for a body save. 
---
Every killer is guilty of it from time to time hell I have to remind myself not to do it.
---
That being said as a killer main you do you boo get dem kills ;)
---
I don’t think he ever said all killers are toxic.. why make an assumption like this one?
---
And nobody asked for **your** input either, yet here we are ;)
---
When I did it, I played immersive as fuck with kindred. If I see another survivor working on a gen and I had less then 50% on mine, I'll head to them and work on it with them. Also sounds scummy but I also avoided healing and unhooking. It is super challenging but you can do it, I believe in you :D
---
Looks normal to me. You can be matched with people 6 ranks apart. Really good practice
---
And this is why Ussylis is my favorite DBD YouTuber with Zubat/Scott close. No (or very few) hard clickbait thumbnails, actual content and not just being a toxic pos, but rather being good at the game
---
Yea keep telling yourself that lol, dbd isnt as toxic as certain other gaming commuties
---
Reminds me of mileena from mk
---
It’s pretty toxic
---
I’ll even just take an ability rework to incorporate multiple members of the gang
---
P
---
I got lucky and did it on my first try. Just wait for over altruistic teammates
---
Ah yes, look at the killer when he isn't looking at you. Not like you have to see him to know that, and if you can see him **theres no fucking point to using OoO**
---
The more impressive thing is that DH actually worked.
---
All i ever get out of it now days is exhaustion and a shoulder ride.

Nobody asked for your input.
---
They're getting pretty creative with that toolbox huh?
---
I never said survivors didn't get any amazing perks but ok 
---
Guess i will just let you get back to jerking off to some degenerate furry porn
---
Here, a real answer.
---
r/perksbydaylight
---
It's like they don't even play their own game..
---
Actually, I think it says more about the average TTV-named player than it does about you personally or the people who make those assumptions. A disproportionate number of TTV people I've played with really ARE extra shitty people.
---
Cool except 2 powers means it wont happen.
---
Why no sound though? I sometimes play with music in the baground, like Thriller, Primadona, any Katy Perry song or if I'm in a loop, I play Duel of fates. But not without sound!!
---
Well I mean other killers have two powers like pig and demi
---
I feel bad for religion
---
Yeah, I was planning on lunging trough the pallet to hit her camping on the other side.
---
I was calling her and watching her play it on steam link through my computer and apparently the sound went to my phone instead of through the computer
---
I've always wanted to see a burnt Myers through a full film too because he doesn't change much :c

Well thanks for telling me. I’ll do so next time. Do I have to block my own as well?
---
lol how is slugging even remotely toxic
---
Sounds rough, luckily most survivors in that ranked are touched by an angel if you know what I mean.
---
Idk his dad seemed pretty pissed he didn't do his homework . . .
---
Yeah they're not very smart are they
---
You are not affiliated with me!
---
I've seen them release on satursay and another day too. It is usually Wednesday though. So its hard to say.
---
Anything where the devs have to reanimate the killer actions they won’t do. Jaws would be cool but will never happen.
---
Ha, you're such a little neckbeard, aren't you?
---
centre of the screen in the slit
---
Ok so I forgot I posted this and imma say I fucked up a bit after checking the rules again. Its only if you try shaming someone in a post (e.g a killer using a mori and not getting a 4k and laughing at how bad they are in the title, or just laughing at anyone for any reason to be an asshole) would need to have the names censored. Still good to do anyway though imo
---
Nah, you're good bro. Just check out the old Halloween films, both 1 and 2 are among my favorite horror movies.

[http://prntscr.com/qh1gux](http://prntscr.com/qh1gux) \- Complains about toxicity made a post with this title.  He is trolling or extremely delusional.
---
If you think even 5% of dcs are due to bugs you're delusional
---
I will be so happy when the random dudes in my survivor lobby get penalized for disconnecting the moment they go down
---
Neither is selfcare if you are playing solo and know how to use it right
---
Usually if you are playing with friends or just good teammates you'll be fine without though
---
I don’t play Adam but he’s low key slept on
---
Lol, gg ez Toxic killer.
---
This Oni clearly overestimates survivor crawl speed lol
---
That's what I mean though. Self care isn't great anymore because there's a lot situations where you just don't want to heal. The less you want to heal, the less valuable the perk becomes.
---
Lol finally someone’s not arguing with me about this
---
It would take a pretty insane amount of work from the animation team, but man it would be cool.
---
What a fucking mess
---
You should go jerk off to Raven from Teen Titans. Might calm you down a bit
---
Nobody does gens when you play solo survivor so I found the challenge fairly easy lol
---
Never said it wasn't
---
Yeah but he's saying they'll spawn if a gen isn't touched for some time which guarantees they cant do what you're complaining about.
---
There's literally no reason to bully a killer. It ruins the fun for everyone else. Seriously, you should feel gross, it's just plain mean and uncalled for.
---
Ok
---
I feel like a stalker going through your post history at times but its only because I love your work. I have been away from this game myself for quite some time. It's just hard to have fun with the current balance of the game right now.
---
All of your posts are on this subreddit, so I hope you find another game to draw for &lt;3.
---
Dude I fuckin hate that shit. It's become my biggest gripe over the past month or so. I hate as much as anyone when someone searches for me halfway across the map after they get unhooked to try to bait me into chasing them into a DS locker grab. But lately it just seems like I've seen so many streamers go right back to an unhook the second it happens, slug the person who was hooked, down the person who saved, hook the person who saved, and then try to pick up the slugged person who got off hook 15 seconds ago. 
---
Then when they get DSd they go "Oh guess I tunneled. Very cool game. Such bullshit, guess I got outplayed by a perk." Like, yeah, you fuckin did tunnel. Then you have some of the kids that watch their stream get all pissy when they emulate that playstyle and they get DSd once. I don't think the bigger streamers understand that the kids watching them are just going to copy them and parrot every complaint that they say. Killer slugs you for 15 seconds because your teammate ran up for the flashlight save before you got picked up? Sweaty killer. Someone gets farmed off the hook by a shitty teammate and DSd you? Obviously a toxic SWF that got too cocky.
---
It's honestly the reason why I find it hard to watch anyone stream this game anymore. If I do it's someone that plays both killer and survivor and would rather play for fun than to play "optimally" and win. Otherwise it seems like half the stream is them complaining about how bullshit a perk or something in the other role is rather than accepting that they got outplayed.
---
This. Used to watch him alot, but then stopped because I got tired of the whining. There are lots of more entertaining streamers out there.
---
What is the purpose of insidious on nurse?
---
EGC = End game collapse
---
Aren't effects like this cumulative and not multiplicative? so if it reduces healing speed by 20% another teammate would heal you at 80% and you heal yourself at 30%
---
But... you had DS.

So far being a killer and just letting people farm bloods while I test out abilities. Every match someone is tbagging at the exits or shining the flashlight in my eyes when I'm stabbing people and letting them heal each other. The last match I was told I'm trash.
---
You could say the same thing about toxic killers. At least they get to kill you at the end of it.
---
What is that beam that looks like it helps with knowing where your gonna blink ?
---
Blink behind exits and when someone opens the gates attack with noed
---
Aren't you like his target audience?
---
Maybe because each player plays differently and are not a single entity?
---
It also talks about it in the cosmetics from that set. Wraith's weapon from that set is literally the Nurse's heart on a stick
---
That is actually the idea
---
Usslysis annoys me because he seems super cocky and has a "better than thou" attitude
---
This is why true is a meme in the community big ego hypocrite streamer who has no clue what he's talking about and a loyal sheep fanbase that'll regurgitate his opinions.
---
My bad, sorry
---
Well 1 thing you can do with noed is hide behind exit gate whenthey are on last gen, and when they open the gate you can boop 'em!
---
If legion just took 3 hits to down survivors instead of the deep wound stuff would that be good? Someone presented me with that idea and it did seem interesting. What do yall think? It seems kinda shit, but idk
---
The Entity ALMOST got you.

When you draw a figure you ideally want to avoid positioning them in a way where their shoulders, hips and head are facing the camera. This stops the character from feeling like they’re apart of their own world. 
---
Secondly, her anatomy while definitely is far from bad feels a little off. I’d recommend practicing realism for a while and figure sketching. A general rule of thumb is learn the rules before you break them, art styles are great however they can be better when drawn from a thorough understanding of human anatomy. 
---
This is a solid piece and I’d love to watch your skills grow, so keep posting! :)
---
When I first started playing my friends recommended I play Claudette just for Self Care. I assume his friends told him the same thing. But I have no idea, I've never watched any of his videos.
---
..what are you even asking?
---
Whoops, typo. I’m curious if it’s worth it to play on 50fps for smoother movement rather than like 100fps
---
Not really complaining :)
---
I have like 800k bloodpoints and more addons for the killers I play than I could possibly go through. I don't use items except for flashlights on survivor and all the survivors I play as have all perks unlocked. There's literally no point to bringing an offering.
---
If you want to get proportions or poses right you can try taking a picture of yourself in that pose then using it as a second reference
---
I don’t know what you expect any of us to do with what little information you’ve given us
---
Ah yes, you have won the argument
---
you honestly cant tell me that 95% of those perks are usable, let alone amazing.
---
And yet everyone stereotypes survivors.
---
This is a picture
---
I used an app to map out the touch screen controls for both survivor and killer for my controller. I have changed the layout a bit since this was taken since some killers have an extra button for their power such as hag who has a button for teleporting to traps
---
you might as well just block your entire screen.
---
No mither + unbrealable is actually useful tho because unbrealable lets you pick yourself up faster
---
I've found if you slug them for about 3-5 seconds shaking  your head no then pick them up it usually gets the message across
---
Also shaking no when you pick them up immediately is a good strat too
---
There is definitely ways for Flashlight Saving to be toxic, just regularly doing it is fine, but when the goal is to bully the killer which it often is then it's toxic.
---
I remember playing Jeff on the new sanctuary of wrath and I legit crouched next to the killer when the killer came around (no tall grass, basically just crouching in the open), and the killer literally walked within swinging distance of me and never noticed me. Sanctum of Wrath is way too dark for its own good.
---
A picture of a joke disguised as a "tip"
---
The buttons are hidden when playing the game, I just had it open to show the layout
---
Uhh, well 60FPS would be preferred, but un-capping the framerate is pretty buggy right now.
---
I'm so tired old going up against NOEAD
---
Bubba for bbq
---
If they made it so that you were exposed, they'd have to rework the perk a bit. By being exposed, you kinda cut out the point of the perk. It's not just a "pick yourself up infinitely, but you're one hit down" perk, it also has the noise reduction, and no blood trails, which make leaving a hook a lot easier. 
---
But don't get me wrong - No Mither definitely needs some kind of rework to be actually useful.
---
Just easter eggs
---
Hopefully it will be just as good as the hundreds of nurse ultra rares that I will never use now because they're trash. Or the 500 or so iri heads that will sit in my inventory for the rest of time because I'm not a dickhead.
---
This is just dumb. Devs can't stop SWF from having comms, so give solo players proxy chat and other ways to communicate without speaking to get them on par with 4-man swf then balance from there. It's not hard.
---
Ehhhh, his perks are very situational.
---
Also on the gas station one
---
With the car wall
---
Object of obsession (which is my #1 most hated perk) is absolutely ridiculously insane since you have this massive wall that you can just give wallhacks behind
---
If it works, its better than using the touch screen controls. The layout is hidden in game anyway
---
fair point, yeah. plus, I guess noticing you downed someone in one hit wouldn’t be too much harder than noticing the broken icon

Healing bonuses are usually addictive, but I’m confident that SC applies a 50% multiplicative penalty independent of medkits/other perks.

It is just the same old story though, a couple too many bad games in a row. Take a break, it won't hurt anybody.

The hatchet throw...i would have shit my pants
---
50 FPS is no longer the ideal FPS, now its just as much as you can get.
---
I played on 50 for almost 2 years, it used to be much better but as the game got more updates 50fps lost what made it better, so i would strive for however much you can make it
---
What if your idea of fun is to be an asshole to other players, though?
---
Omfg I needed that, thank you
---
Mint Rag time.
---
You will regret it at some point, it really can't be anything but a love hate relationship with this game
---
Because if a killer uses items put in the game to make the win easier it’s bad, but if survivors use items put in the game to make it easier for them, it’s okay. That’s how this community works.
---
Wall hack Myers time.
---
Legion is hard to balance cause of his power and how it works. They're either overpowered with no counterplay or absolutely terrible. There's no inbetween. They need a complete rework imo
---
Aw shit I misspelled. I’m bad at this lmao 😂
---
Survivor mains be like
---
As far as I know, the "smooth movement at 50fps" thing is a myth that arose from people using it to moonwalk better. But moonwalking was easier at pretty much any framerate below 60, and moonwalking is kind of the opposite of smooth movement anyway.
---
I don't see any technical reason why it should be better. Movement is client-sided, using prediction, so the more FPS the better. That said, skill checks are always pretty choppy, I think the skill check pointer is simply not updated frequently enough, regardless of the framerate.
---
I personally use urban, self care, and spine chill.  Urban to sneak around gens and to sneak past a killer when someone else is getting chased, self care(used only after getting a gen close-by done UNLESS 0-3 hooks or last 3 gens), and spine chill because I'm a little bitch and need to hide when a killer is coming my way.
---
I wait about 6-10 minutes as survivor per match it's actually hell.
---
If that hatchet hit, you would be dead
---
Deadzone issue maybe? Something like that happened to me where I couldn't go full speed as killer or survivor. I got a new controller and haven't had an issue since. Maybe you can get a new one if your controller is still in warranty?
---
Oh aight.
---
He's so tiny it's adorable
---
He needs neither... he needs a true rework because this Legion is just unfun to play against, not even op. Even if you win doesn't feel like a win-win because the match was so unfun.
---
It’s not like he started playing this game with his wife because she asked him. How dare he try to enjoy a fun game with his friends and family. Seriously we have people complaining about swf’s but loading solo is so terrible
---
Why would I judhe you over you using a perk? It's not your fault that the perk is unbalanced.
---
Yeah he really be doing people dirty with that silver sword.
---
Yeah it does, I edited my comment to point that out
---
Haven't done the challenge but I don't think it has to be one game does it?
---
Legion has been my main since their release. They're fun and with the right build very very deadly.
---
In 4 days of playing this game ive
---
- Fought swf( body  blocking, Dead hard, barrowed time)
---
- Flashing clicking follow you around  blendette 
---
- Gen rushers( 4 man tool boxes)
---
- BM'ers at every pallet drop 
---
- Games where  I've gotten no kills at all
---
My mind set is go in and score points, Im ok with just 1 kill a game, But i do hate blendettes, Hooj sabotaging steves and Body blocking  BMing Megs or was  it neas, I love  the dwights lol their funny  as hell and  sometimes let them go
---
Ninja has a pretty big bucket.
---
Ghost Face is practically meant for slugging and using Survivors as bait
---
Any one else got clickbaited in his “got chased for all gens and piggy has no-Ed” but in reality she had the perk but all dull totems were already equipped.
---
What add-ons did she have?
---
Oh nice that’d be nice to use so you can get used to her blinks because I suck with them lol.
---
100% take a break and try to look for good players in each lobby to create an actual squad... do you play on console or PC?
---
Thank you all for the feedback :) I’ll try out 144fps and see how it goes
---
I'm german, but nice try
---
"Tired of the whining" did you mean tydetyme?
---
Is it the same room for when the basement is in the lab? Or is it a different room at the other basement spawn
---
Both, but only recently started playing pc
---
You can only grab healthy survivors off gens
---
Urban works wonders with Sprint Burst.
---
To be fair, you could of also kept out of los to at least delay it.
---
That being said, you have to look slightly more down to break him out, you're looking too high.
---
Is that the same toolbox that’s next to the park bench on haddonfield? Or is there another toolbox and I somehow missed an Easter egg
---
I don't understand what "toxic" means in this community. I thought toxic would be to do with abusing unfun gameplay, but here it seems to mean winning.
---
I watched the video, which bit was "toxic" to you?
---
By have fun I meant making a fun game for everyone, not just myself. If you have fun by being an asshole to other players then, well, sorry mate but you sound like a bit of a narcissist.
---
His videos are physically painful for me to watch. He somehow always gets matched up against a rand 5 (or so) killer who plays like a rank 20. He and his usual toxic swf squad proceed to bully that killer and give them absolutely no chance at having fun. It’s him and his toxic fan base who ruin this game.
---
How romantic
---
Depends on your sensitivity tho
---
It does have to be done in a single game.
---
Ah me and a group of 3-5 of my friends play on Xbox, rank 3-7 survivors and are always looking for competent people to play with.
---
Looks like one person to me, but okay
---
The problem is that it's impolite, and then they're being a dick head by asking someone else to use a translator.
---
I'm german, but I still don't start talking German on an international server, I write in English like everybody else
---
People care way too much about being facecamped when the game is over.
---
Yeah sorry, ps4 player
---
Probably the most annoying doc build you can run is a 3gen strat build - Distressing, Unnerving Presence, Ruin, and Overcharge. At the very beginning of the match, find out where there a 3 gens that are the closest to one another. Stay around where they are and make sure they never have a chance to do them before they get the other four done. If the surviors dont/cant one of the 3 gens you a2rr guarding beforeit comes down to the last 3 then you have successfully got them in a 3 gen situation. With this particular build you can literally rotate around the 3 gens and continue to overcharge them and apply pressure. 
---
Of course this doesnt work on higher rank surviors but it is no doubt the most annoying doc build.
---
Thought it was got reference

---

---
Hmm, I know there is, or use to be, a bug where ther nurse would sometimes move at normal killer speed during fatigue.
---
how are they cheating?
---
So what are survivors supossed to do?Just lose on purpose?
---
Fancy outfits = high rank vs me in starter outfits
---
It's not unbalanced tho. All the survivors have to do is cleanse all the dull totems before completing the last gen and NOED will never have a chance to spawn. NOED is problem for people who dont understand how easy it is to make irrelevant. Youll never see a red rank killer using noed (unless using a meme/challenge build) because it is a crutch perk. You essistennly only have 3 perks for the entire match and even when gens are done, NOED still may not activate because it's very easy for survivors to cleanse the dull totems.
---
Not really.You can buy outfits from rank 20.
---
That movement looked odd.
---
Because, one person ques up as a killer and the other is a survivor. They have the same names (HitomiLovezJohn/JohnLovezHitomi) and every time the survivor one escapes
---
a german getting hissy about people speaking non-germanic languages? yikes

I think it's fair to be annoyed when someone face camps you. I don't get annoyed for the most part because of my playstyle and i understand why a killer would be mad at me after running them around the map and whoops, 5 gens are gone!

Are there any single perks I should definitely get?
---
Unbreakable is super handy too. And after buffing left behind, it's a good perk set.
---
I didn't mean OP as there is counterplay to it. I'm calling it unbalanced because it's counterplay is really dumb and is really unfun to play against kind of like how Descisive Strike is unfun to deal with. It's a broken perk in the sense that it rewards the killer with a strong ability simply because the survivors did not do optional objective. It doesn't reward killer skill, it's one purpose is to punish survivors for not doing the a very boring optional objective.
---
I’d say just level Bill for unbreakable too
---
yup your right inner strength a better selfcare get a free heal after doing a totem isn't usable 
---
nor is after care even tho all you do is unhook or heal them to get infinite aura reading or dance with me because no one uses windows 
---
I can agree MoM never works tho mainly because survivors are too lazy to go out of their way to take a hit
---
Teabagging isn't a part of playing the game.
---
A better comparison is complaining about genrushing. Both are just people completing their objectives. Neither is toxic.
---
Borrowed Time, Left Behind and Unbreakable (that’s if you get the chance to use it when in dire situations or just getting slugged to the max)
---
I’m not gonna say looping is camping worthy, but wasting a killers time for so long would really make them angry. Also he could’ve just gone for someone else
---
Tunneling because u just dont like the surv because they looped you well or used a flashlight is toxic asf though.
---
Sorry I meant off the Shrine for survivor
---
You could grab healthy survivors in the really early stages of the game
---
Well there is that, but people seem to have the attitude that the killer has to go look for other survivors when the gates are already powered.
---
Like at one point the killer knows a gate is at 99% so what legitimate reason does he have to leave hook? What he should of done was hook you somewhere where there is less LoS blockers and proxy camped though.
---
Honestly that was unnecessary bcuz as soon as someone camps, they’re throwing the whole game anyway
---
You sneaky bastard
---
Ah ok, definitely Borrowed Time! Very useful!
---
Agreed. As of right now a complete rework is the only thing that makes sense instead if constant pointless nerfing.
---
It's nice to see wholesome gameplay in a sea of toxicity.
---
I see you are also playing as my main, good job
---
How is this toxic?
---
Doesn't Feral Frenzy no longer proc sloppy butcher, or did they revert it?
---
I had to turn my brightness all the way up to recognize what they wer (probably) talking about, inside of the crate that the entire vid focuses on.
---

---
It happens automatically over time now instead of you having to manually do it like it used to be. You can also pull someone in by hitting them when they’re awake.
---
People care way to much about teabagging.
---
You hit the survivor or wait until a certain amount of time.
---
And chests
---
And when they are saboing hook
---
And totems
---
And exit gates
---
Self care gamers hell yeah
---
He also plays toxic when he plays killer. He facecamped my friend at four gens once as Spirit, and had an ebony. He was also running stridor. 
---
Few weeks ago he went against a Spirit on stream and complained incessantly about stridor. My friend called him out and he denied it, then backtracked and said he had to play that way to learn her. (Btw I have no issue with stridor this whole thing was just funny because he’s a hypocrite).
---
I also had him on my team as survivor not too long ago. I let the killer sacrifice me once he and his two buddies left because I felt bad she got bullied essentially. He asked “wtf were you doing” and then his buddy started to insult my appearance in chat/ made some sexist comments. This was his friend too, not some fan he was playing with. 
---
I wouldn’t usually give a fuck about streamers but I avoid this dude at all costs now.
---
They get pulled in automatically, you don't *have* to do it - but if you give them a slap that will do it too.
---
[Here's](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Frederick_%22Freddy%22_Charles_Krueger) the wiki page, tells you everything you need to know.
---
I swear I might’ve seen you yesterday in a match, I was Freddy
---
Either hitting them or grabbing them from a generator or a locker will automatically pull a survivor into the dream world. Also from a certain distance, Freddy is invisible to awake survivor.
---

Congrats mate
---
Yeah, this is why you shouldnt discriminate hatch based on wiggle but on how they played throughout the match.
---
True, I feel like I'm one of the few who usually doesn't care.
---
The first tiime I saw reverse2k and ninja playing dbd, they both reported a basement bubba for camping lol
---
Thanks guys 👍
---
If you don't tunnel youll never have to deal witg DS. Im red rank killer and it's funny to see every survivor run DS but never use it cause I dont tunnel them. I almost always go for the person who unhooked because I know for a fact theyll be running DS.
---
Ivroy is a cool fellow.
---
Ok, but when did I mention anything about that?
---
*red arrows* Op?
---
Yeah but people teabag to be cocky or annoying, while tunneling is annoying, it’s fair
---
What happens to the toolbox during EGC
---
A bunch of people just want to have fun but that doesn’t stop shit like toxic killers and SWF Bully squads. 
---
That’s why I think deliberately facecamping or being in a bully squad should be punishable. You’re actively contributing to a toxic environment that helps divide the community. And in doing do, it spreads toxicity.
---
You're getting it wrong. He's just putting the lyrics of gangamstyle into his thumbnails but it's stuck at the "op op OP" part, smh my fucking head

One of Hags perks is literally only rewarding if you do *not* camp.

The web is completely random with perks. It's honestly a bad system to get perks but we just have to deal with it. Just keep leveling it up and itll eventually pop up.

Would also like an invite pls
---
If you want to waste someone’s time, they’ll waste yours, it’s just karma
---
Tunneling affects gameplay while teabagging doesnt. Tunneling literally ends the game for a surv while teabagging does not affect the killers ability to play. I personally dont see tunneling as fair unless its endgame.
---
He’s not as bad as people make him out to be. No he’s not one of the strongest killers and definitely needs some buffs but they way people talk about him you would think you’re lucky to get 1 kill with him.
---
The worst case is the downed uses DS on you and then the Dwight uses head on right after a nice long stun
---
Oh so it’s my fault for being good at the game when they can easily go for someone else?

Looping someone isn’t being “good” at the game, it’s a strat, just like camping. Don’t have to be good to loop or camp

i always like giving the hatch to scoopy steve especially if hes played well. Sad thing is u get more blood points sacrificing them all but i sometimes like to let one go despite that. u get more wholesome interactions afterwards rather than silence or insults
---
Little pro-tip: if four survivors are all injured and decide to group up together, it's not called being toxic, it's called throwing.
---
Teabagging affects someone’s mood, makes them want to go after you. Can’t be mad when you egg someone on and they actually go after you. That’s like saying “wow u suck” and then that person beats u, and you’re like “it was just a joke why do u have to be so mean”
---
Your moris out boys, looks like we got another otz to handle
---
Ninja should not be playing Dead by Daylight if he thinks that he can report everyone who doesn’t play fair
---
I agree with you, Im just saying that tunneling is far more toxic than teabagging because it actually affects gameplay while teabagging leaves it up to the killer on how to respond.
---
JuST dOnT tuNnEl REEEEEEEE
---
Yeah because survivors definitely dont abuse the 60 seconds of invunerability at all. Lol
---
You may be a red rank killer, but it's pretty obvious you're use to more casual solo queue survivors than swf. Descisive Strike is easily the most abusable survivor perk in an organized team and is something I've had to learn to deal with in my thousand hours of play time. Not as bad in a way as it use to be, but without DS, good swf teams (teams that would probably have a high winrate even if no one ran ds) would be a lot less difficult to play against.
---
Gens done, survivors not leaving. Yeah, is face camp too. It's what you deserve when your teammates won't just take their win and leave. 🤷‍♂️
---
Have  they ever thought  of a perk bundle? Like  2-3 bucks  for like 10 perks( good ones) atleast  I'll pay for  that  over  cosmetics
---
Congratulations! What system?
---
It all depends, if you loop the killer and teabag him, yeah he’s gonna tunnel you, like I said you can’t insult someone and be mad when the tables turn. If u didn’t do anything to deserve it, then yeah it sucks
---
His legs were so crippled by those traps he bled out on your shoulder
---
And the killer is PLAGUE!
---
Steve main checking in.
---
I like to do the - killer gets hatch I get door method so we both get points!
---
I knew Freddy was weak before but I don’t understand now you just starting to sleep with out him doing anything.
---
Like one of my games yesterday is a good example. Got downed by a legion with a mori and hooked in a dead zone. Got saved, he came back and downed be immediatly and got moried after earning like 7000 BP. That shit sucks.
---
Well we’re u the closest target bcuz if so I don’t blame him, but if he hunted u down specifically then yeah
---
This is always the best
---
It protects the item I loot out of a chest with Plunderers and Ace in the Hole.
---
nah he ignored a healthy surv trying to bodyblock him.
---
Getting s 4k is more fun though :)
---
Can u teach me how to patrick
---
How do you lagswitch on a console? Lmao
---
so that’s the only outlier? that’s w bruh moment for you
---
Ok then yeah that’s tunneling, if he came back and u were right there I wouldn’t consider that tunneling
---
I’ve been trying to play without self care for a few months but the past few days I’ve had the most horrible teammates who’ll run away instead of healing, be immersed, sandbag, be like rank 13+ at red ranks or just straight up feed themselves to the killer because they want to act toxic but they’re just not good enough and get killed so to finish my challenges I slapped it on and had the easiest matches I’ve had in a few. Had to play a little more selfish than usual but it was worth it. Hopefully I won’t need it again but there’s some real potatoes out rn lmao
---
Jane is very overweight.
---
That wouldn't be impressive. Impressive is playing  normally solo and escaping. Most of the playerbase is solo. Escaping consistently in with random teams is a more impressive feat if achieved by playing the game actively instead of passive.
---
Using SWF and getting information solo players never have does not make escaping impressive imo.
---
Sent you message!
---
Good point
---
What’s wrong with that play style?
---
The plane that destroyed that tank in the movie should be detectives hunch or small game, something that helps you find totems
---
Congrats my man, getting rank 1 killer is so much harder then rank 1
---
Very polite no grabs just slaps
---
Exactly. He has one sacrifice at that point, why would he abandon it.
---
Imagine using toxic and slugging in the same sentence
---
Hey TheDragonJelly on ps4 rank 4 rn looking to make a squad of people to play with often or for the night or how ever long

Except if I'm the survivor getting camped, then all my teammates either rush to save me without BT or crouch next to the hook for 10 years waiting for the killer to leave

Why would your friend run Head On without Quick and Quiet and Urban Evasion on a David?
---
Looking at the picture, it would be easy for one to think that "Patricking", as it were, would be a physical act. But this couldn't be further from the truth. To Patrick is a *state of mind*. We had a whole game plan ready to execute. 99% the exit gate. Unhook. Body block. You know the drill. But in a *single instant* all of that came undone. Suddenly there was no more ego. No more thought. Just the primal instinct to *GTFO*.  
---
  
---
We Patricked.
---
When the fire nation attacked
---
That’s the wrong mentality. You’re not wasting the killer’s time, the killer is wasting their own time. If you know someone is a pain in the ass to chase then go find someone who isn’t as good as them, down them and then catch the good looper through altruism, as they’re forced to go in for slugs and unhooks. Anyone can hold M1 and hit space bar, not everyone can loop. If I get no value (a good pallet or an M1) after 20 seconds every chase, most times I rotate, but of course there are exceptions. 
---
So many killers don’t understand that you decide the pace of the game. You are the power role. Even versus a SwF, just throw on good addons w a good killer and you’re in charge (if you’re good). But they’d rather just tunnel a good looper then complain about genrush and toxicity and all that bullshit when 5 gens get done.
---
ah so u wait for the killer to find hatch and open the exit? smart strat lol this is why i love steve mains
---
Good idea
---
Thanks! Xbox
---
It's our meme build if you notice in the corner my name is UwU_HookMe_Daddy and I run head on, quick and quiet, self care and small game. We like memeing some games lmao plus he loves urban and doesnt use head on or quick and quiet a lot so that's my influence on his build too.
---
Well I play killer and I don’t facecamp often, but it feels like going after multiple survivors is the worse option
---
Maybe try running a perk or two to help in chases? You currently have 3 game slowing perks, you could maybe cut back on them for Save the Best for Last or Enduring. You could try the Enduring Spirit Fury combo which is still reasonably strong. I'm All Ears works wonders at high loops.
---
Tinker around a bit and see what suits you best.
---
Thanks!

---
Freddy is SO much fun to play!
---
Nah that’s too nice.
---
Tie him up and throw him in the lava that should do the trick.
---
Event the Entity would think that’s messed up.
---
Meanwhile I'm in red ranks and no one knows how to loop anymore apparently. Lol
---
Best advice I can give you is to avoid looping as much as possible and if you must loop try to be as unpredictable as possible as long as long as there is a a spot in the loop the survivor cannot see you, also try to hide your red stain as much as possible.
---
Another thing you need to do is learn what pallets you should kick what pallets you should play around.
---
Lastly, learn when you should give up a chase.
---
They probably don't heal you because you've wasted the whole match crouching around the map and hiding in a corner self caring.
---
Object is a chase perk.  It's for really good survivors that know how to handle themselves in a chase.  This is the last perk an immersed player would want to run.  It defeats the purpose of their playstyle.
---
Inner Strength, Iron Will, hell, I'd even take Solidarity over Self Care.
---
Buncha bananas and astraya Luna it’s like well they got their sud baby now they need the swaybee gravy is that bad i can roll sod make it green and just stomp in the lake bc it’s lane left and it’s land aho . Sad is I haven’t even had to do this 0 times not yet
---
you called?
---
This happened to me tonight. Took me all around the map to find the hatch. Dropped me in front of hatch, and then closed it. [And then hooked me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvfyGUfs2Ok)
---
Same, mostly stopped playing killer bc of it. Been wanting to improve my huntress, but with the skill I'm currently at with her it's nowhere near viable for high ranks
---
It's hard to tell without specific gameplay to point out specific mistakes, but depending on the situation, it's not more about whether they can loop you, but whether you should take the chase at all. If the survivor runs to a very strong portion of the map perhaps it's best to leave them alone and pressure gens far away so you never have to deal with that area. If they run to that area and it's across the map from available gens left, they're not doing anything important and you can ignore them. Wraith is debatably, but generally considered a bad killer, perhaps run different perks, different killer if you don't have something that works for you. With Wraith perhaps try catching survivors in a bad area and get a free hit, then immediately cloaking and going for a bodyblock. Try moonwalking, try watching tutorial videos on how to loop structures, I'd recommend a good one here: https://youtu.be/t8u0jRxN2kQ . Additionally, try to focus maybe on macro, trying to pressure multiple people at once, use your high mobility as Wraith to find people healing and interrupt the action, making them waste a lot of time
---
TLDR: experiment, find what works best for you, to end chases quicker. Also, work on macro not just chase, everyone can always improve.
---
The reason hit and run works so well is because you're just injuring survivors until they are find them in a unsafe location. If they go to heal then that is time spent healing instead of doing gens which is good for you. This is why people who use that playstyle use Sloppy, Thana, and Nurses because survivors would waste even more time healing.
---
Maybe you should learn to take the aggro.
---
&gt;There are perks that could and should be base for survivors and killers in general but instead they're always added as perks, nothing exciting is ever added to the actual gameplay.
---
Because a lot of the perks are too strong to be added as base mechanic while they are balanced as perks. Unbreakable, Kindred and Borrowed Time common mechanics that people ask to be default but fail to see how strong they are.
---
Insert Nea is a killer joke here
---
........I was trying to scroll just right to screen shot both those posts but then I realized that it was this post of a screenshot of both those posts.
---
Yup every time :)
---
Or when I’ve had killers come into my stream saying I can have hatch and I let them have it instead!
---
Great job! Keep those chains swinging
---
precisely. you've figured it out, you genius individual
---
Game starts. The map title never goes away. Couldn't see my perks(spine chill) and got downed in the first 30 seconds. I'm guessing it was the same way for the other 3 because they all DC'd within 20 seconds of me getting hooked. I got myself off the hook(what are the odds) and the killer led me around to different pallets. Couldn't do any gens though so once I found the hatch he let me go. Thank you Ghostface
---
Where did I say it can't be used against you? You seem to like putting words in my mouth so you have something to argue against. I said if you dont intentionally tunnel then you wont have to deal with it. And if they do try to abuse it just slug them. I dont really see your whole "this perk is so op and there's no way to avoid it" mentality. 
---
Also, you, me and everyone else dont know for certain if it's a swf 4 man or solo qs or swf 3man etc so gtfo with that. You can abuse it just as easily in solo q as you can a swf group so your point is redundant. 
---
And of course without ds the game would be easier for killers, it like you seem to forget why DS was actually made a perk in the first place and then go on to say it's OP. Lol no it does It's intended purpose 98% of the time. To deter tunneling and give you an extra chance against a killer who tunnels right off hook. Does that mean there isnt othet uses for it like distracting low rank killers? No. So idk what your point is
---
If I had inner strength I wouldn’t even think about self care but I like to get chased a lot and be altruistic and with a lot of the teammates I’ve been getting I can’t depend on them to keep the killer busy long enough or to heal me in between chases because they’ll just be walking around the map aimlessly instead of doing gens so it’s a struggle. Trying not to go back to self care though, just playing a little more safe/selfish.
---
I mean it really is impossible for certain killers to catch survivors at certain loops of the survivor doesn’t make massive mistakes.  It just makes an entire portion of the map completely safe, where if the survivor runs there they are literally free to loop the killer forever
---
I think Puppers already found this.
---
No one escapes eath btw
---
I would recommend saving shards to buy survivors and ignore the shrine, but if you'd rather buy them Borrowed Time is very good. I would also keep an eye out for Dead Hard, Iron Will and Unbreakable which are all phenomenal perks.
---
it's not my playstyle it's the type of people I get matched with. either way, it's good to have just in case. some people agree, others don't.
---
What?  No, they should just be placed in matches with killers actually at their rank.  Or Killer should be made easier (not more powerful, just less complicated) in some way, but that’s asking a lot.
---
&gt;make huntress 115% movement speed and ***don't slow her down while charging a hatchet***
---
Oh I get it, this is a shitpost. Do you want huntress to be uncounterable at loops? Because this is how you make huntress uncounterable at loops.
---
But then would that mean pay for them to be unlocked in the bloodweb or just to pop up in every killers/survivors inventory? If they ever decide to do this it should be the latter, but I doubt they will
---
"Just slug them"
---
Yeah because if for whatever reason I find them working on a gen it is a good idea to slug them if I don't know where exactly anyone else is, great use of my time. Also really hard to slug them if they jump into lockers. 
---
Oh, and les not forget that they can body block for other survivors when they have DS. That's fun because if you slug them they either have unbreakable or be picked up long before you catch up to that other survivor.
---
Like I said, you're use to casual survivors. Lol
---
OP?!
---
Does she have a tumour under her mask?
---
Okay buddy. You keep thinking DS is an OP perk with absolutely no counter play and ill continue getting 4ks -3ks in red ranks with billy.
---
Could I perchance get an invite as well?
---
I hate when this happens too, but I can see that DC at the end.
---
i want to do that but sometimes its not as easy as just decloaking and getting a free first hit, they can run a fair distance away before that happens even if they didnt see me until i was only 10 feet away.
---
His shtick is the use of OP, kind of became a running joke.
---
You most certainly may! Sent you a message :)
---
What? It’s a 4v1... you’re always going after multiple survivors
---
you get shit for healing, shit for not healing, this community is interesting to say the least. either way, we all have love for the same game and just need to express ourselves respectfully and not be rude all the time.
---
Yes, it is an intended feature albeit annoying as hell. I occasionally place traps in ways that intentionally makes it near impossible to not mess up a vault.
---
Someone insert the menacing hand meme.
---
No I mean like if one guy is giving me hell I’d rather make sure he dies than hook other people, let him live, and no one dies ya know?
---
you have no say whatsoever in the perks or items someone else uses, just focus on yourself. it's not that serious
---
That is why Wraith is considered one if weakest killers in the game and most people prefer to play Ghostface.
---
\[EU\] \[PC\] Surv Rank between 3-6  I go up and down.  killer Rank super low bt wanting to play it more.  Up for SWF or KYF - Just DM me to play!
---
So like I said you abandon them and force them out from their loops by forcing them to be altruistic
---
Dude I found just looking straight ahead 180 degrees away from him a better strat to reveal him then actually looking at him.
---
Fuck gf and how broken he is
---
I had that from the second I got to rank 8 the first time. Facing better survivors made me a better killer.
---
When did I say DS was OP? You seem to like putting words in my mouth so you have something to argue against me.
---
that L-T wall thing was actually pretty helpful, i had been going the short way every time.
---
alot of purple perks for being a tier 14 killer.... How long did it take to de-rank...
---
Always when i have unbreakable, it never comes useful, but once i take it off i get slugged immedately
---
Well if that’s how you want to play then sure. But I like to go for 4ks when I play
---
For real. People just like to have something to shit on though.
---
I do too but a lot of my games I hook survivors a ton and they still escape and teabag and act like they didn’t suck
---
How did you know
---
Oh just like you did a few comments ago. I guess what goes around comes around. Enjoy being punished by "DS Abusers" lmao
---
For the record, I Main Hag in Red ranks without Ruin and I still get 3k-4k most games. That doesn't matter though because it has nothing to do with this conversation. Lol
---
That’s also a reason I play ruthlessly for 4ks. I hate so much when I try to be the kind killer and they take advantage of that and teabag as if I didn’t let them go
---
That’s why I’m fine with deranking, easier targets and more grateful survivors
---
Except when they run sprint burst and use it to always go straight to the loop... wasting your time while others work on generators.
---
Nope, I never said the perk was op. I just said it was annoying and abusivable, in fact in my original comment I even compared it to how NOED is annoying and doesn't reward killers for playing well. DS is the same way as it doesn't reward the survivor for playing well, in fact a lot of the time it encourages to play in ways they wouldn't otherwise which is the issue I have with DS.
---
Oh, I dont see where I asked.
---
I hate that prick so much...
---
I don't see where I asked about your apparent win streak with Billy either.
---
LOL 
---
best version of no u
---
\*if\* you get home from work
---
No mither is my favourite perk in the whole game, im not sure why but its extremely fun to be injured. Especially if you have a good day and can actually loop.
---
Exploited College Girls
---
"inner strength a better self care" ok so inner strength counts as a survivor perk, sweet.
---
Yes, sure inner strength is a good healing perk. But that's all it is. A good healing perk, if you are a good survivor you shouldn't be healing yourself unless you have a medkit, resilience is still the better option compaired to every healing perk in the game.
---
Are we just going to ignore the fact that you lose ALL your "infinite" aura readings if you get hooked once? 
---
I don't even understand what you are trying to say with dance with me
---
Fucking please, I would love to know how many times you have even SEEN mom activate. Are you honestly telling me a perk that you have to dedicate your playstyle to, waste a shit ton of time, AND don't even have a 50% chance of it happening if you do all that is even a remotely good perk.
---
I didnt say anything about a winstreak lol great reading comprehension skills bud. Feel free to have the last word since I know your ego needs it.   I said what I wanted to say.
---
Well fucking with the Supernatural and then releasing a monster into the lab is one good reason to close themselves up and drink their sorrows away as the beast feasts on their colleges.
---
Doubt it
---
Look here, the game is over and you are basically dead without my mercy. You can either not wiggle and I might give you hatch, or you can wiggle and you definitely do not get hatch.
---
Bruh at some point the excuses have to stop. Survivors aren’t untouchable dude
---
Nancy's the new hag by the looks of it
---
Yeah, if you try to blind them mid Chase they can just look up or down and ignore your light. I'd recommend watching some good survivors on YouTube or twitch, this game isn't as intuitive as I'd like
---
People say it's because otherwise matchmaking times will be stupid long. If that's the case then why even a ranking system in the first place? Just split it 20-11 and 10-1. The ranking system doesnt make a lick of sense and honestly surpirsed to see they havent changed it yet.
---
When mom and dad see the report card
---
People gonna be pretending to do that NOED challenge until the tome closes.
---
"Ill continue getting 3ks and 4ks with Billy"
---
My reading comprehension is irrelevant if the word "winstreak" is the only thing you cared about out of what I said. Lol
---
Hard to insult my reading comprehension when you're incapable of reading the message instead of the words.
---
Wraith has no tools to deal with looping so youre going to have to get better at looping and deal with it. That may sound harsh but that's the reality of m1 killers. Only thing he has going him is his cloak and without the right add ons is even easy to loop.
---
I deranked from 13 to get rid of them, didn’t work but at least they are throwing in some lower swf. Groups
---
I like him but he has faults that are just as bad. The rap god stuff is super annoying I really wish people would quit asking for it.
---
I’m a killer main and tbh if they make it to exit gates and NO ONE IS DEAD they deserve their escape unless they’re t-bagging in gates and waiting for me to chase them out... nothing wrong with trying to save a teammate.
---
They just made a good play, props to them.
---
Thats honestly rather normal for LetsPlayers, no matter which game, as long as it has PvP
---
Totally overload the Thumpnail and Title with "OP", "Broken" and "NEW", a selfmade (sometimes sexualised) Picture of the Character, a baiting Title, and perfect.
---
Then in the Video they actually behave normally, rarely intellectual
---
Same with perks like autodidact, or borrowed. The moment you take either off you get 500 skillchecks in 2 seconds or have everyone be only saveable through borrowed. Sucks man, it's like they know
---
I was joking, my bad  
---
Really reads like a dumb comment from me
---
The way he's just staring somberly from afar is just so entertaining to me
---
So report them for working with the killer which is a bannable offense. Also, no player shaming in this sub please even if it's not your intent.
---
It's when a survivor is within range of a hooked survivor, I think 16m but I'm not sure. A killer shouldn't lose BP if there's a survivor nearby that's free to chase anyway.
---
Or better yet just have the tank self destruct.
---
He’s called nurse the best killer many times in the past few weeks.
---
Yeah the best type of people are the ones who literally run out the gate just to save someone, even if its futile.
---
you should start the trial healed but be unable to be healed after the first hit
---
and there shouldn’t be a broken icon for the killer on the HUD
---
ah, dw :)
---
when you piss off two generations of family at once
---
This is your second posts within minutes of each other. You can stop now, they are against sub rules.
---
How important is it to get to tier 70 for you ? Honestly you can get close and if you want whatever rewards are left you can just buy the tiers remaining if it's really important.
---
I love playing wraith and kinda acting like some eldritch horror
---
He's kind of a mixed bag but in my eyes he's sometimes like an evolved bald dwight
---
He's obnoxiously huge and loud so playing him is a severe disadvantage, so something has to make up for it. So if someone puts money into Jeff cosmetics, not only did they opt to buy a survivor without any particularly game changing perks after a long list of other more preferable dlc, they decided "i like this guy" and invested even more into him
---
That's only my suspicion. Idk why, but Jeffs always scare the shit out of me. Especially christmas sweater or facepaint Jeffs.
---
I usually have a duo partner that does that, I also don't need chase crutch perks because I can 360 decently and my partner always switches out once they get healed up and I'm back to poppin gens.
---
Yeah whenever someone plays a lower tier killer like clown, legion, or (sometimes plague) 90% of the time they are super nice and just want to do something different.
---
I just think it’s getting to 70 is cool because it shows I was here from the beginning, I’ve been playing since day 1 on Xbox and made a ton of good friends through this game some of them I lost so it just means a lot that I get it idk why I care so much but it just means a lot
---
It works the other way as well, I'm consistently somewhere in red ranks and I see rank 8-10 all the time and somewhat feel bad for them.
---
Feng is a precious bean
---
protect her
---
Yeah I think I put Feng way too far on the left towards toxic.
---
I think it's from my huge bias of how Fengs were a year or two back, where she along with dwight were the only two survivors who had lots of flashy cosmetics
---
Fengs back then were evil incarnate, but now I feel like they either stepped into Kate/ Yui or started using a bunch of other characters.
---
If I made "eras" of Fengs, I'd mirror Feng onto the right side, and I'd put old era Feng right along with cosmetic Dwight. And default Fengs right in that gap (right of Jane) on the top right square
---
Great play, mate. Not many would leave the exit gate to go save, over themselves. Even if its futile atleast you tried!
---
The hard part is remembering what the hell you're doing in game
---
Unfortunately too rare in my experience to throw on there
---
Most of the time people P3 other survivors first and then eventually start buying cosmetics. So by the time they P3'd Jake they are already using a bunch of his cool cosmetics.
---
im confused here, wiggle on the ground or struggle on the killer? With perks like agitation sometimes i cant tell if the survivor is struggling unless there's the really loud grunts lol
---
You can always buy rift tiers. Not the best option but its there. 
---
Push the levels as much as you can by playing and if in the last day of this rift you haven't reached level 70 yet, buy the rest.
---
So which one is it? Au, or Gold? Edumacate me please
---
Ok thanks!
---
Then you get the no mither ace and you know you are in for a loop lmao.
---
That was very lucky nicely done
---
Imagine having to worry about being mangled.
---
This comment was made by the Inner Strength gang.
---
I love it, I've fucked up some people's days playing as Wraith and Billy
---
You lose points towards your emblems if you spend too much time near a hooked survivor unless there's another unhooked one within ~16 meters
---
That sensitivity hurts, idk how you guys do it, you're another breed haha.
---
r/okbuddydaylight
---
I'm convinced they're a deep cover memelord.
---
Could 4 gen them even, to be fair though Demogorgon already does this basically, especially if you throw on his addons that decrease his warp cool-down.  Even Freddy can for the most part 3-4 gen map wise pretty easily if survivors don’t use teamwork.
---
I love the like slide/teleport you do, makes it 10x better haha
---
I watched a couple just to see if he did anything that has warranted the hate. Besides a big ego he's just a standard player and hasn't learned all the ropes. Though in the first video he instantly asks his wife which character has the self heal so yea, he plays Claud for the self care.
---
Play with your food perhaps?
---
No, I checked all her perks and no play with your food
---
Honestly, it's the best approach. He isn't the next ochido, he's a guy with a big ego and people have blown this out of proportion
---
Is it a bug or are you not running while trying to pallet slide
---
His old thumbnails were an acid trip though
---
Au is Gold. Au stands for Aurum, the Latin word for gold, and is it's symbol on the periodic table of elements.

I completely stopped watching Monto after he started the bam bam thing. It’s so annoying.

Wait what?

I’m pretty sure Behavior recently stated that match making isn’t quite doing what it’s intended to so I’m sure they’re working on it

Well now it isn't actually. But it was

---
I'm sure it'll be fixed **Soon™**

Obviously it’s frustrating but take it as a sign to relax and learn some new things :)
---
I don't know about the DC penalty but most people like to heal near finish gens cuz the sound of the gen masks your healing noises, which are pretty easy to hear.
---
I’ll always be a legion main no matter how many times they nerf them !

Always hold the Sprint button. If you are and the character is still slow vaulting, probably a bug.
---
I had a similar experience with Otz's stream today. Normally he's great and he's by far my favorite dbd streamer. However at one point he faced off against a swf that had two commodius toolboxes and meta perks except two OoO. That set him off. He kept saying how upset he was thinking about other people having to face it and it's like dude c'mon... 
---
How can you be so upset at people wanting to play efficiently? Don't like the perk(s)? Ok. However, it seems ridiculous to complain about people just playing the game. They didn't go out of their way to bully him or have weird strategies made to make the killer not have fun. They didn't trash talk in chat. All they did is play the game and play it will. He even timed out one of them in his chat for attempting to defend himself because Otz complained about it for quite a bit.
---
The worst part, to me, is seeing the chats reaction and immediately coming to his side on it. So many people getting mad and calling them toxic. It's the same argument for gen rushers. Uh, you mean, **playing the game?? Doing the only objective that allows you to win??** It doesn't make sense. I love Otz but I think he needs a break from the game. The many flaws it has may be getting to him.

Bonus speculation:
---
**Noobiest survivor: Meg** with almost no contest besides Neas and default Claudettes. Claudettes can of course hide or self care in the corner, but I find myself wondering what a Meg is thinking far more often.  Things like saving Sprint Burst in inopportune situations (letting someone get to 2nd hook state for no reason), crouching and hiding when the killer's heartbeat isn't even near, wasting pallets or dropping pallets from the wrong side.
---
Watching a lot of streams as well it seems that Megs follow that pattern of having both cute and infuriating behaviour.
---
**Most Toxic survivor: Nea** with definite close seconds with a lot of other players. I say there's two types of toxic; the "I know what I'm doing 100%" and the "I'm a relentless dick"- I think *good* players have the tendency to inflict more damage, but Neas, from my experience, have this odd pattern of *wanting* to inflict damage but usually failing. A surprising amount of TTV Neas I peeked in on tend to be sort of crybabies, complaining about the game without actually having mastered any of it.
---
I imagine them being Meg's older, meaner sister.
---
**Evil incarnate: Dwight.** I hear about baby dweets all the time but they seem far too rare in my experience. Especially when baby Megs are so common. But a bald/ ttv dwight is trouble. A team of P3/ flashy cosmetic survivors with a Dwight or two is scary stuff for the killer.
---
Dwight "mains" in my experience tend to be veterans, with the highest amount of "power" to be toxic. They aren't as mean spirited as Neas, but they will "be toxic" simply to have fun. Locking the killer into 7 or 9 seconds of immobility with DS + Head on + firecracker. Borderline throwing the match to get MoM to proc, teabag a mori'd corpse, and still manage to escape.
---
**Special mentions: Claudette**: They're too much of an "every-man" to make any wide sweeping statements on. They can be toxic, they can play fair. They can hide all match and grief their teammates worse than innocent Megs, they can carry a match on their shoulders. They're just about everyone's first pick on character so they come in a wide spectrum.
---
I can say when I'm survivor I kind of resent playing with Claudettes. There's a high chance they use Self Heal for 40 seconds and then go through 2 healthstates in a chase in 10 seconds. I just see it too often.
---
**Most common lobby:**
---
A mix of Megs and Claudettes + a Kate. I don't know why, but the game feels like it puts 1 ok survivor in with 3 survivors who need help. If the Kate dies or gives up early in the match, the killer wins. If the Kate isn't among the first 3 hooks, it's a balanced match.
---
Another common lobby is replacing Kate with a P3 Claudette + Nea. Overall a downward trajectory for survivors (when I'm playing killer)
---
If I see a Dwight, flashy Nea, Feng, or a Claudette with actually bright clothing, but more than 1 or 2 in the same lobby, I assume the odds are in their favour.
---
So that's what the DBD team looks like on the job
---
I think we did a pretty good job this time
---
I personally like Ghostface more
---
Were you running in a straight line? I know its seems like a silly question but the amount of times ive caught a survivor because they are running all wonky is also silly, wastes so much time.
---
Fair but doesn't the louder the gen make it easier for the killer to locate the survivor or survivors and halt the gen progress?
---
This is me with fully bloody Claudette lol, she was my first P3 character and I think the bloody clothes look dope on all the characters, but I know it has a reputation
---
Ghostface is usually seen as the better of the 2 but with myres you do have the potential to KO whole teams with tier 3. It really depends on experience, if your new to killer ghostface is a good option but I would only recommend myres if you have experience with stealth killers.
---
What I've learned is how to play Freddy 😝
---
Did you take this photo with a razr flip phone from 2004?
---
What does the face mean
---
Can you explain what you mean?
---
What region and platform mainly?
---
What system?
---
I see them on Xbox, is it just the switch?
---
Tenacity should be preferred to unbreakable with no mither.
---
any update on being cool yet cody
---
Isn't Otz well liked in this community for his wholesome attitude that kinda acts as a beacon in this muggy place
---
??
---
I’ll probably just whatever hole we on lay down and wait for news of the FONZ like when I was at smash mouth well eventually gg smash mouth they just goin through its late and STTTEEEEE
---
Is that a euphemism?
---
True weeb is Oni mains lmao
---
Actually true
---
Alright I was just trying to be nice but if you’re going to be shitty then I’m out
---
Not affected. M&amp;M works very well with Nurses.
---
Because against freddy it doesnt work if you're asleep
---
Borrowed time doesn't work while you're oblivious, since there is no heartbeat
---
With the most recent rank reset change on December 13th, none of us dropped as far as we normally do. I’m a red rank killer/survivor every season so I was only reset back to rank 5 then immediately right back to red. This problem existed before too, but it’s getting more obviously worse now. The rank system honestly needs a complete overhaul. 
---
Also over the past 2-3 months I’ve seen the survivor queue times become crazy long while killer queue times are always instant. I think people are getting fed up with playing killer and getting bullied really. If we could get more people to play killer, then the survivor queues would improve drastically which would be great for most everyone.
---
These are the 2 main problems right now that are inter connected in my opinion.
---
Overwatch? Pure cancer.
---
Freddy has no terror radius in the Dream World since you have the oblivious status effect, and BT works around terror radius.
---
Like 5 minutes for a lobby. Sometimes 15-20 with errors and leavers
---
Congrats! Maybe I’ll run into you on Xbox soon. 
---
Just some friendly advice, I’d recommend swapping out Blood Warden for something else. It’s best use is when you have a build tailored towards the Endgame. However, your other 3 perks all combine to try and slow down the game as much as possible. Ruin is the obvious one, and then the BBQ and Pop combo directly slows the gen progress down. If you have a really good game, those 3 perks will directly prevent BW from every being used. In my opinion, you’d be better off taking a different perk and just committing to slowing the game down, or swap the other three out for Rancor, Bitter Murmer, Remember Me or NOED, and play Endgame Freddy. One or the other basically. Just some tips from a Freddy main :)
---
What's puppy guard mean? I just had a survivor message me that after a match today, I had killed 2 and had a 3rd on a hook, then the 4th rescued the hooked one and I killed him instead.
---
I gotcha. Yeah having school and work sucks I'm at tier 61 and I feel like all my free time is dedicated to getting to tier 70. I feel like I'll probably make it if not I don't mind spending like $5 for the rest of the tiers
---
Why is it necessary to blink? People can see when you're blinking

Bruh freakin kids getting triggered since this toxic cutie tea bagged chill kids

---
Same but in the other way around
---
I don't see them that often so I can't generally know.
---
For *some* reason though my brain combines Nancy and Meg into the same person. Like they do a typical Meg sort of thing and I go "wait, that's Nancy not Meg"
---
Kind of nooby from my experience, although I have played against a few scary Nancy's. New survivors I can't assign too much to since they can very easily be veterans who bought the DLC or brand spankin new players who like whatever the DLC is about.
---
If I see a lobby with 2 nancy's, a default claudette, and a nea, regardless of the Nancy's cosmetics in my head I'm counting it as an easy match with a risk that I'll get stomped if I notice anyone who knows how to run multiple tiles at once. I've definitely had several matches where I underestimate a Nancy (again, I think of them as Meg) and I got filled with dread as they led me to god bus long wall jungle gym and actually preserved pallets.
---
thank you, that makes sense :)
---
Forever shine down live show is the alternative to well at least w AINT gonna watch anime
---
thank you, im still sorta new to the game so i appreciate it
---
thank you for the response, i appreciate it !
---
B-but Spirit is waifu...
---
😐😐😐
---
He means before any survivors are near the exit gate.
---
Exit gates are powered -&gt; noed activates -&gt; Nurse immediately blinks behind an exit gate and stands still, resulting in Insidious taking effect -&gt; survivors have no idea and open gate thinking ez killer -&gt; actually die
---
I'm rank 16 and the other guys had rank 19, and yes i completed 4 gens, but after the second guy died he started patrolling the last generators. So my friend just killed themself for me bc I found a hatch. I woud do the same for him but he left me to die during the collapse... I was on my first hook. He deserved to lose this one.
---
It’s nerf or nothing.
---
Lol what?
---
"Running is toxic."
---
There’s also one in Badham Preschool, you can’t get into it, but you can see a tiny bit of it through the wall in Freddys basement, as nurse you can blink up to it (you can’t blink inside it) and when you go into fatigue you’ll see skulls, candles and a pentagram
---
Ouch.
---
Yea I think I'm going with Ghost. I like that he can crutch and sneak up on ppl with no red stain as well.
---
**Ugly cosmetics**: This is an odd one. These are honest to god rare. I'm talking deliberately "*What in unholy hell is that outfit*" ugly cosmetic combinations.
---
They are usually *like* the Dwights; veterans who are bored. But unlike veteran Dwight/ Feng, they're usually over the perverted "toxic for fun" phase.
---
If you've played undertale, here's an analogy:
---
- Neutral run = P3 Claudette
---
- Pacifist run = Kate
---
- Genocide run = Veterans (flashy dwights, flashy fengs, legacy)
---
- The 2nd Pacifist run to "fix" the game = ugly cosmetics
---
Hold up nurse tells you where shes teleporting to now?
---
The secret room is cool and all but can we admire the confidence the OP has? Takes their time to record a video when there’s 3 gens left lmao
---
Sorry was just having alot of fun tonight
---
I know man. This whole ride was wild from start to finish. Who needs to play DbD when you get this show for free?
---
Probably use a different account. It’s best to just practice her starting at rank 20 and ease into the play style.
---
I mean, put it this way. Both Otz and tru3 main Feng when they play survivor, as does Umbra. While community opinion may be divisive on these content creators, as are their views on general...ask yourself why so many known killer-centric content creators are choosing her.
---
Well, other than being Best Girl (tm).
---
Ussylis' video was way better on it imo
---
It’s actually on the weaker side, but you have the moonwalk the part the survivor can’t see you
---
Oh can she blink behind gates before they are open?
---
As of 2020 i am changing my name to Ayron because people made a joke about me being on a tv which is op
---
yes
---
Oh god oh fuck oh god
---
honestly I learnt a ton about fast vaulting thanks to Ussylis
---
She no lie kinda thicc
---
Who?
---
You can't blood warden me, if I leave before you hook someone after opening the exit gates. \*roll safe meme\*
---
If you guys go through the comments of his videos, I’m pretty sure it’s satire/irony. It’s become a running gag for his videos. That’s how I perceive it anyway, you’re more than welcome to disagree - we all got different tastes.
---
I decided to go watch his Freddy Krueger video and he instantly dropped shack pallet. I know he's still learning the game but that killed me a little bit inside.
---
Oh no it is, but this entire situation people are making is so minor that I feel an ant hill works
---
Dont you think its a little too much at this point.
---
Yikes, luckily they aren't all like that.
---
Where would you moonwalk exactly?

Yup
---
Oh yea, i watched like three of the four dbd videos to see if he did anything worthy of hate. He's egotistical, that's it. But as a moderately experienced player, watching him do things hurt. In the first one on his channel he got mothers dwelling and went to main house while being chased by micheal, instead of vaulting the window after his fall from the second floor, he decided jump into the basement causing him to get even more stagger and then was shocked when Micheal smacked him and put him in basement
---
Eh I don’t mind. It’s just a thumbnail. So many people use it ironically/unironically (it was at its worst around 2014-16) that I don’t really care anymore. I just think his videos are funny and I learn a lot watching some of them.
---
Grab animations are janky af
---
I got it earlier and the ONE time it's in a good location I get 1 dc, one person kills themselves on hook and the rest just die on hook.
---
Myers
---
Ooh gotcha. I love me some Myers. I'm currently running Ruin, BBQ, Infectious Fright and Monitor and Abuse. Infectious I'm still experimenting with, but it can really snowball when you're in T3 and Myer's massive terror radius will give you so much information.
---
If this is legitimate and is actually applied, it would be very cool. Thanks for the info. See Ya
---
Sounds dope
---
Along the wall where fov is blocked
---
It's unfortunate salty survivors can simply deny you your challenge. Hopefully it's something they'll fix in future rifts because it's kind of ridiculous.
---
She's small and has good cosmetics/ was practically the only "cool" survivor that had a wide variety of cosmetics a year or two back
---
She's also not super loud or anything- good pick if you're willing to put money and time into the game.
---
Man I wish I could 360 like that . I’ve tried it and end up hit. Either I’m too slow to do it or the killers instincts are too fast
---
That’s what he gets &gt;:(
---
This isn't a real killer lol. It's just a fan made killer concept I made.
---
You can have the best game possible and still be denied by 1 individual. Seen so many topics about this one its crazy
---
As far as I know each survivor starts our awake, and then the clock starts ticking down immediately. They fall asleep after 60 seconds. You hitting then will immediately put them to sleep.
---
Ring content incoming.
---
A cool thinf would be to have the other 3 members of the Legion patrolling around and if they detect a survivor you have the option to switch to using that member and you still get to use Feral Frenzy.
---
Maybe even switch to other members on a whim using something similar to Freddy's Dream Projection (the controls)
---
Idc honestly as long as the content is good I don’t care about the thumbnails I’m not going to sit there listening to him talk while looking at it if his content is shit fair enough but he’s an ok guy in my opinion (I’m not trying to hate just putting my point out there 😊)

I once played with a “DBD PLAYER IN TRAINING”. I don’t remember if it really seemed to make a difference, but they didn’t do that bad.
---
I like bond for solo gives you a lot of information
---
Since the last update it's easier than ever and as survivor it was also easy enough before that.
---
Now you have to try it as Killer, that's much more skill in my opinion
---
He can be kind of toxic ingame.
---
Xbox (gamertag wazdakkadakka)

The overwatch fan base begs to differ
---
Ghostface
---
This sub is really strange, best to just say "pretty good job" or some shit if youre after karma.
---
I agree with you. I have to use it all the time now because it seems like every other killer facecamps.
---
I can't tell you how many times I've been slugged then the killer loses me somehow lol
---
Using it mid chase also makes it so you don't have to moonwalk to hide the red stain
---
This is my third killer concept. If you're interested in looking at the others, they can be found below:

[The Shark](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e1f60e/the_shark_killer_concept_jaws/)

Additionally I wrote up a Legion rework. I ended up using some of the concepts in it to make The Gargoyle.
---
[Legion Rework](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e5w9yo/suggestion_legion_rework/)
---
Isn't it an addon?
---
Such a cute drawing. This is something I’d do lol
---
Yeah I've noticed two different things happen if the killer isn't doing very well
---
1. They will just DC
---
2. They start facecamping
---
Because the game is Us vs Them brah, theres no middle ground, if you even suspect that another redditor even so much as *thinks* about playing the other side you downvote because they **deserve it**. Its the only way the devs will take our side seriously and balance the game in our favour.
---
Who "we" "our" "us" is will be up to you, but choose carefully.
---
I CAN'T TELL IF YOU ARE MAKING FUN OF HIM OR IF THIS IS A GOOD IDEA
---
Woah weird tessellation there. Also Umbra pog :)
---
I was in a match for a half hour with a claudette running to the edge of the map and teabagging. When I got her to the hook after messaging them that they were being an absolute dickhead they let me hook them in the basement. Didn't get the shit because of a fucking dcing on the hook yui.
---
Lately I’ve just seen people facecamp on first hook when barely any time has passed. I’m rank 8 so maybe it’s different depending on where you are.
---
That really does sound bad, worst case scenario is a good description
---
Borrowed Time is quickly becoming one of my favorite perks. It's just so positive and generous. Practically costs nothing at all at 6,000 Bloodpoints you drop it in the trial and that chill ass perk gives you deep wounds to use later in the game.
---
Imagine running Fixated and Urban evasion simultaneously
---
I'm rank 12 but still see it fairly often
---
Nothing else to do while queuing lol
---
IT'S A DUMB IDEA BUT IF IT WAS A THING
---
*Laughs in iridescent button Legion with Enduring Spirit fury*
---
(I've never used the combo but if this shit was a fucking thing that shit would be forced on killers do to the immense amount of pallets
---
They're gatekeeping. People will make up their own rules about literally anything.
---
I care!
---
I can’t stand survivors like that I play 60/40 survivor sided but damn people like this asshole make us all look bad
---
Really cool killer and perks! I like the betrayal one.
---
Killers already have more speed than survivors. And gane bloodlust in a chase, making them faster. This killer would be way too powerful with how fast you're making them.
---
Oh possible. Literally played Nurse once so i dunno what shes about
---
I love his content. Him, Ussylis, PainReliever, and Ardetha are my favorites. No0b3 would be up there as well, if he uploaded more often.
---
I play Pig and Huntress mostly so.
---
I don't click his videos because of this, I don't want this annoying shiny shit in my feed
---
I'm gonna go against the grain here and say Myers. I think he is way more fun to play and his stalking is actually useful. Also his perks are pretty good on other killers.
---
Silence, Boomer
---
It's not for every killer, but I agree. I heavily underestimated the perk when I first saw it, but the early pressure it gives you really helps  you start the midgame with a reasonable advantage.
---
You know where killers almost never check? Next to finished gens.
---
Apart from easter eggs they also serve to annoy the shit out of everybody, both reasons serving no purpose.
---
Yeah and it's just a nice feeling knowing that whether the killer is camping or or heading towards you, the unhooked survivor has a much higher chance or survival
---
Not sure what's going on here but I'm concerned...
---
Aaron is the worst content creator in DBD at the moment EASILY
---
It's automatic over time, also hitting a survivor puts them to sleep.
---
A lot of what you're talking about refers to Freddy before his rework. You USED to have to use your power to put people to sleep, but the achievement now just worked based on the passive sleep.
---
Traps only affect survivors who are asleep, they won't trigger on an awake survivor and are invisible to them.
---
You're also invisible to awake survivors outside of a certain distance.
---
Your logic is not so good too.
---
"Omg killer don't want to help me, what a dick"
---
Certainly
---
Ultimate big brain is blink behind gate immediately and wait for 5 gens.
---
Someone:*fart
---
AronPlays : is this op perk build
---
I'm red as well. I feel the problem here is going to be how massive the spectrum on what "camping" is. For what I wrote it only applies to the generally accepted definition of camping. Killer literally doesn't leave a 5-10 meter radius. In which case the ranking system starts deducting points after I think 10 seconds. Don't quote me on the time. And I think that only counts if another survivor isn't within the same range. So no. True "campers" can't rank up beyond a certain point. If a killer knows I'm around for the save and looks around or doesn't leave knowing I'm there. Thats not camping. That's not being a complete idiot throwing games. Starting to leave and seeing scratch marks coming in so the killer turns around isn't camping. Those things aren't punished in the ranking system because why would it punish you for not throwing. "proxy camping" has just as wide a definition depending on the survivor. Pacing back and forth between two gens checking on the hook is what I consider proxy camping. But some people who want everything handed to them cry proxy if the killer comes back on unhook. When I play killer if I'm within 30 meters and somebody unhooks unless I'm in a chase already you better believe I'm turning around. I know 2 people are there. It would be stupid not to. So all in all you and I will most likely never agree. But killers that sit within 10 meters of a hooked survivor never looking for another survivor, every single game, will not rank up past a certain point. That's not opinion. That's fact.
---
Can relate
---
No promises were made ;)
---
Best way to see it is, if your last and get shouldered your definitely fucked regardless of perks, but theres a slim slim chance you get mercy if you hand your fate over to the killer.
---
Killers earn what they get, if you give them the kill its a lackluster victory, not guaranteed but better odds than trying to wiggle.
---
Yeah, I know what you mean. I've been subscribed to him for awhile and he definitely seems like he gets agitated a bit quicker lately. If I had to take a guess I'd say it's because he's doing the whole "master every killer" thing and it's putting him outside of his comfort zone.
---
Maybe he is just burnt out though like you said and needs to play a different game for a couple weeks, because it definitely doesn't seem like he's enjoying himself. Which is sad because watching him play was literally the thing that got me into DbD.
---
You're right on that. I forgot about that. I have the Spirit unlocked already.
---
GAUld
---
I like my SWF's like i am with my CPU/processing power: greedy
---
It’s fine if people wanna fuck with me in terms of meme-ing or doing something odd or funny. I just don’t think people should be purposely hateful towards them when they don’t even know what the person is like. That goes for everyone who plays this game.
---
Cant grab.
---
Also how can she slap
---
Nah
---
3 years ago maybe.
---
It’s quite possible. I actually play a fair bit of Freddy as well. He’s a fun killer.
---
All I understood was "STRAYA CUNT!"
---
And hook saves.
---
Then I’d say you’ve missed something crucial.  Or are already a ninja fan, which gives you an unfair bias.
---
Steve threw a tantrum but Doc will fix him right up
---
Gens popping off quickly are because you don’t know when to quit a chase, you failed to apply pressure and took  high risk high reward perks with you. Toxicity is just them having fun at your expense, you can do the same and crying about it won’t fix it.
---
Thats more or less what it is right now, within 10 ranks, apart from 15+ which is with anyone (that should be changed). Which is frankly as good as your going to get in a 3 year old game
---
It depends on the time of day. For example 8-midnight it’s really easy to get into play killer but during the day it’s easier to play survivor fast.
---
Not Playing DBD at All
---
I honestly never really profile a survivor except god damn Ace and David wearing flashy cosmetics, Ace's in christmas sweaters or leasure wear are always douchebags.
---
I try not to dc when im doing terrible, I'll just take my loss and move on. But it's when survivors are being toxic where I start to to facecamp or dc.
---
Agree to disagree. I’ve met plenty of nice, fun streamers. I’ve met some asshole streamers. Same can be said about the people I’ve met who don’t stream this game. Lots of cool people mixed with a few assholes who try to ruin it for the rest of us. Just gotta try and keep the positivity flowing.
---
Wait so you already had a DC earlier but like you thought you could still get the Basement 4K somehow?  I'm probably missing something here right?
---
Don’t waste your time with killer, too many people want to play killer and so it makes it hard to find lobbies. Learn to have fun with survivor instead.
---
Simply outplayed
---
This is the exact build I run, with resilience and self care
---
Racist
---
Im rank 15 for killer and i get mat hed woth rank 11-6 survivors so i basically get bullied the whole fucking time cause i hate sweating but i guess thats what you gotta do
---
Left Behind will pretty much never be useful except in rare cases, I'd drop it for We'll Make It as that'll allow you to rescue and heal survivors with more consistency. With the perks you have the only other change that might be worth it is spine chill for unbreakable but that's more up to you
---
They dc'd on the hook as I put them on it when they were on deathhook and it was before the bitching about people dcing on the hook epidemic.
---
Them*
---
I'm playing on EU and it's 11 AM right now. Does it matter that much?
---
Then watch them all escape through the other gate.
---
I guess I'll try, but just had a weird first match.. I think there was no killer? Or at least I didn't see him at all.
---
Not all the time. Most try run there to catch one if close by.   When the gen is done don't most want to get the flock away from Said gen?
---
Myers for sure
---
Running both Ruin and Devour Hope isn't a good idea. Because of Ruin survivors will look for a totem and they will most likely also find the Devour.
---
It's kind of a bit hypocritical that you DC because the survivors are toxic while you are only toxic when your "opponent is laughably bad". Those players are most likely still learning the game and being toxic because they are *trying* is kind of a dick move. 
---
The fact that these survivors were toxic because you were laughably bad is also a dick move, but it seems like a case of karma biting you in the ass
---
Ahhhh gotcha so you were hoping the timing was off and it might have still counted.  That kind of makes sense.  Moreso that what it sounded like initially.
---
If I'm injured, I'll head towards a gen I already completed to heal. Gen sound masks my injured tones, and the killer wont check a previously completed gen hoping to find a survivor.
---
Ah, yes. My favourite game Was by Daylight
---
Pretty much yeah
---
But why be toxic in the first place? There's no reason for it and it has no reason to be defended. I admit that I can't quit a chase properly and that hurts me in the long run. But the fact that three of the popped almost right as i hook the first survivor is absolutely stupid. I know crying about it doesn't help but that's why I put the flair that says "rant" on it so I can vent without judgement.
---
Hes a god
---
Well said
---
YOU DID A SHITTY THING.
---
I'm not the only one to say this... it's time you accepted it and moved on.
---
There are various ways to combat tunnelling once you know how to play the game. You obviously don't so... maybe.. stop adding to toxic gameplay. Survivors already get a bad name because of disconnects (not that killers are innocent).
---
Oohhh that reminds me of the last match I played! I was outmaneuvering a Legion like nobody's business throughout most of the match and she had already gotten two of my teammates  then a few minutes later I made one stupid mistake and I got downed shortly after the last gen was done and I got face camped hard. My last teammate came to save me twice but I got downed because there was nowhere to run and most pallets were gone. The killer ended up killing me because of facecamping and I wanted to throw the controller so bad or DC but I held it in somehow lol
---
The first 3 gens don't matter all that much.  It's all about preventing the last two from popping.  I have won countless games after losing 2 or 3 gens relatively quickly.  The game slows down considerably after those first few gens.  At this point you started applying pressure though hooks so altruism can force them off gens and you usually have a fairly tight radius of final gens for them to work on making patrolling easier.  Don't ever give up and get tilted over the first couple gens popping.  Those should be an assumption unless they really suck or you're just really good.

But that's why I've said it doesn't happen often. I don't try to be toxic. It's not my thing. Usually it only happens when I'm playing with friends. But thank you for letting me know that running the two hexes are bad. I usually just try and hope they find ruin first.
---
&gt;But the fact that three of the popped almost right as i hook the first survivor is absolutely stupid.
---
While you chase one survivor, what do you expect the other 3 to do? Grab a popcorn and spectate the chase? 
---
2 to 3 gens popping in the first chase is a normal game. Once you give them a second objective such as unhooking and healing, the game actually starts.
---
What rank are you?  I get insta queues for killer on PS4.  You mentioned refund so are you really new and at a very high killer rank still like rank 18 or 20 or something?  If so the pool of new players at those ranks is small you just need to rank up a couple ranks to fix it.
---
It's the little reward that helps fuel my persistence. Holding it in and stooping yourself can help out a lot.
---
Meanwhile I'm still a yellow rank nurse getting bullied by survivors on a daily basis :(
---
Cant even deal with the just desserts.
---
I know if i end up camping someone and they escape i at least hang my head and bat them away.
---
Yep just bought it, but how can I rank up if I can’t play killer?
---
Ok that is a cool tip. Go to a previously completed gen.  Might try that thanks.
---
Thank you for this. It helps out a lot. I'm not that great as a killer but i do try really hard to be. These comments really hello out my will to play the game as advice can really help out.
---
What app did you use for this? Also, can the camera be mapped to the right thumbstick?
---
Haha this is amazing I love it
---
Honestly it's not even about self care to me.  You won't be using much self care if you are decent. If you need heal, bring med kit. Green ones with add charge or something isn't even expensive. Not like survivors have tons of places they need to spend BP anyway...
---
Otherwise, yes you make good argument. Also self care is useful for bunch of killers, to ensure you get to 99% of health (e.g. dead hard, against legion, trapper using red add-on, other M1 killers etc)
---
You will just gotta wait for those initial queues.  Rank reset doesn't allow us to rank below 16 or something like that forget I haven't been reset anywhere that low in forever but I know there's a hardcap. Basically once you rank up a couple ranks you'll be out of that new player pool of matchmaking and the queues will speed up dramatically.  You might be looking at 10 minute queues until then.
---
Yo what the fuck
---
The issue is, dbd is the only game this happens on. And its driving me insane.
---
Yeah man just seeing my rank get better with each match is what keeps me from Dcing
---
Same
---
How long you think it will take?
---
Yes, i saw that on another comment. I'm not used to that sort of thing usually I can apply a lot of pressure when only two are done, but usually the survivors suck, and other times im getting paired with rank 8, 7, and 6 survivors when I'm only rank 12.
---
I never said the killer was a “dick” for not complying to help me out. I was the last survivor in the game and I’ve given it 8 previous tried to finish this particular tome challenge, all while waving and pointing next to a pallet. But I can understand looking at it from the other end from the killers perspective if there was any miscommunications. 
---
The particular person created the chat and took a while to send his message, and it wouldn’t have mattered if I sent my text because his setting was left in private. So, instead, I got this nice text.
---
Rank up to the mid teens and you'll be fine there and anywhere beyond that.
---
Without doubt my favourite content creator for entertainment purposes.
---
Imagine if hatch could spawn in there
---
Well then, sure. Time to wait 10 minutes for a match XD
---
I have had two newer friends try and do this. They didn’t realize killers can look away, and they think it stuns them.
---
Yes,but that's when it's tier 1,upgrades to 95 then 100%
---
me too 😞
---
I ‘like’ the Pale Rose as killer: less looping around the main building... and I ‘HATE’ the backwater swamp (or other I forgot the name) as killer: stupidly overpowered loops imo (I have no bamboozle or anything that’ll help. As a survivor I like them even, I find Pale Rose more fun, though
---
Golden toolbox is easter egg. There is toolbox hidden on every map.
---
BABYSITTER
---
Time to take out that iri + Mori lol
---
And there it is again. Ignorance. You are ignoring the fact that Myers tunnelled. There are also many in this thread praising me for what I did. How do you propose we combat tunnelling? Slap on a few perks that the killer get even more pissed at? If they've got their eyes set on someone, chances are they are not going to stop chasing them until they're dead. 
---
Answer me this and please don't ignore it once again; is tunnelling a shitty thing to do?
---
Those men went out the way they probably lived drinking
---
Np.  I started off as a Trapper Main before I expanded my killer rotation so I was already used to losing gens out the gate.  Learned a long time ago not to sweat the first couple gens.  Just play aggressively.  Hook your targets then leave to pressure gens and initiate your next chase and down.  Don't overcommit to long chases.  And no matter what they do don't get tilted.  You make them play your game you don't play their game.  If you get a peacock survivor running up to you teabagging and flashlight clicking trying to bait you into a chase you laugh at him and ignore him and go pressure your gens.  Don't let these little shits bait you into doing what they want you to do.  Stick to your gameplan.  Also I dont like Devour with Ruin.  If you run Ruin they're already looking for totems.  Puts a big target on the back of your Devour.  I'd go with one or the other personally.
---
This isn’t exactly a bad build, but I do have some problems with some of these perks: 
---
- Dead Hard isn’t nearly as good as it used to be. Thanks to dedicated servers it is now bugged and often doesn’t work properly. I suggest switching it for Sprint Burst as you can 99 it and use it any time you want.
---
- Self Care is that one perk which seems good, but is terrible. Sure, being able to heal yourself is good. However, it takes 32 seconds with it and it would be much better to just find a teammate or do a gen with your (maybe) Resilience. Without it you can free up a perk slot where I suggest Prove Thyself or Iron Will. Whatever works better for you. Just don’t bring Self Care- it makes you not cooperate with your team and usually makes you not do gens as fast as you should.
---
-Plunderers Instinct is a good perk. It’s just not very useful for all the game. Unless you want to stock up on items now, I suggest just switching it with Resilience.
---
-I don’t have any problems with Spine Chill as it is a very useful perk. Paired with Resilience, you get 15% more vault speed which is extremely good. So definitely keep Spine Chill.
---
Ask any questions if you’re unsure about something I said! :)
---
I watch bon appetite. He makes videos showing all of the ways to cook a certain ingredient like chicken or steak etc.
---
I asked what you meant by the emoji you used and it seemed like you were just being rude
---
Yeah he's good at no grind and fun. Although I do think he isn't as weak as people make it out tho. He's definitely stronger than clown, was better than mikey&amp;GF cuz they had that stalk bug (not sure if that's fixed...).
---
Solid c+ tier imo
---
But again the good news is once you break that rank threshold they can only drop you back so far during the monthly rank reset so it sucks now but it'll work itself out soon enough.  They do this to try and protect the brand new players from getting matched against us lol.  It's a good idea in theory but the end result is terrible queues.  You'll be out of there soon enough.  It's a cool game I'd stick it out.
---
Awesome, is there a anything I can run with devour to perhaps make a good build out of it?
---
Ooo i'll put that on the to watch list then.  I love cooking in general.
---
Just found a match as we speak! Gonna see how it goes :D
---
I wish they kept the phone in the morí it was a lot cooler than the morí we have now
---
I know about the issue with Dead Hard, but for now it is the only Exhaustion Perk I have on him. And I try my best to make good of it and few times it saved my ass in a chase. I feel very uncomfortable while using Sprint Burst, because I usually save it for a chase, and I don't think it is a good habit. So I would be thankful if you advise me on using Sprint Burst effectively
---
Yes, me too. It's fascinating to watch, and its pretty fun to do.
---
Betrayal would be such a sick perk
---
Yes!! It is especially useful on killers who have to set up during the first minute or so (e.g. Trapper) or killers who just have trouble finding survivors first thing. The only killers you don’t need it on are high mobility ones (like Nurse or Hillbilly). This is only because there are better perks for them and their early game is quite strong anyway. Have fun using it!
---
Not enough arrows*
---
Yeah needs more arrows. only one or two per video? excuse me?
---
also,
---
OP???
---
If  you're running Devour just understand that it's a super fun perk but they often find and destroy it before you get use from it.  But when it does activate they're some of the most fun games you'll have.  As long as you accept that you're good to run it.  Massive risk for massive reward type perk.
---
When I run Devour I usually pair it with Pop Goes the Weasel so I have something to help extend the game a bit while I try and get my stacks.  For the rest of the slots probably perks to help you end chases quick so you can rack up tokens before they randomly see your lit bones somewhere.  Save the Best for Last, Monitor, Spirit Fury/Enduring that kind of stuff goes well with it.
---
What a f... I didnt know about it.  
---
We can collect this golden toolbox to get something or what?
---
Omg I did this onece to a friend who didn't know what bloodwarden was and I escaped at the same time it activated and accidentally left my friend to die. It was super funny but I felt really bad about it.
---
Thank you. I appreciate the advice. I'll try and run a build with that.
---
I understand how irrational the guy's claim is. Legion needs a delete, not a nerf.
---
Rework*
---
_Ftfy_
---
No it's just a toolbox that you can see laying around, you can't collect it.
---
That sounds like really bad luck.
---
It’s not necessarily bad to be found first. You will be able to loop the killer more and buy a lot of time for your teammates to do generators. However, a big reason for being found first is that your team don’t do anything which pressures the killer to trying to keep them off gens. If you’re team are all just crouching in corners as soon as they hear the heartbeat, then they won’t be found as easily- but they won’t be pressuring the killer to stop the gens popping. It’s not the best that you’re found first, but if you can run the killer for a while so gens can get done without you doing them, it’s okay. 
---
So basically it’s just the fact that your teammates aren’t pressuring gens.
---
Not playing definitely feels like the only way to win
---
Don’t be afraid of using it at the start of the match, so when it gets to 99 after about 40 seconds you can then start running around until the killer is on you. You have to be very confident when using it, but one small untap of pressing shift will let you sprint away from danger. If you really don’t like Sprint Burst, don’t be afraid of using other exhaustion perks (Lithe or Balanced Landing) or just sticking with Dead Hard. Make sure you understand the issues with Dead Hard if you continue using it, however, as it should probably now be used for distance and not the invulnerability aspect.
---
This happened to me a lot too. I learnt how to be much better in chases (looping etc.) and stopped using the full P3 Laurie outfit (I swapped the bloody shirt for the cardigan). My advice would be to learn how to be more efficient and loop certain tiles and also to maybe invest in some darkly-coloured clothes.
---
Right, like I love that he looks at the back of the camera like ghost face buddy what you looking at 😂😂😂
---
If by "rework" you mean that they would completely remove Legion from the game, then yes.
---
NEY
---
If this truly is the case then it must be somekind of a record. 46 is actually a LOT. And in a row. Are you sure you're not just exaggerating to make a point?
---
What do u have against Legion???
---
browse reddit or pinterest and tapk with friends
---
I'm usually here in DBD subreddit :p
---
So you say you've tried everything but I can guarantee after reading your post that isn't the case. 
---
Learn how to loop and handle yourself in a chase.  
---
That's the answer you need to hear.  Stop putting learning this off and relying on immersion
---
If you do this it won't matter if you get found first. You won't be defenseless anymore and you'll be able to waste lots of the killers time while your teamates pop gens.  
---
This is an entirely different game and a fun one at that when you don't have to rely on hiding from the killer and never being found.
---
I swear if I had a record of some kind I'd show it to you. This kind of shit happens to me all the time you'd think I'd start recording it. I once went 100 games in a row losing on Clash Royale before I decided to uninstall it. And recently went I think 31 games losing on For Honor before deleting that one too.
---
Ghost Face low-key looks menacing and creepy here lol.
---
Thank you :) I will play some games as Meg to get better using Sprint Burst
---
What I hate is that when I get good chases, my worst being a couple of seconds and some of my best being over the 80 second mark, my teammates are being fucking useless. It's like whenever I'm not unlucky in my chases I'm unlucky in my teammates. And whenever it's one way it's the other.
---
I can't be responsible for other people's fun, that is the game designers job: of the game is well designed, they have fun while I'm having fun.
---
I won't go out of my way to make the game miserable for others, but them having fun is not my priority
---
Hey get after it man!
---
That's probably why after I'm downed I look around to see everyone always in a damn corner. You'd think at rank 5 this would be done but apparently not.
---
I’m trying to get it before rank 20
---
Thank you all very much! I will definitely level Bill now!
---
I have the worst fucking luck and I don't understand why. Whatever I did in a past life must've been really fucking terrible because it's been as bad as losing family members to a disease that affects less than a percent of all children in the world.
---
I can understand complaining about OoO though. It's a perk the killer has zero control over, that can't be counterplayed in any way except becoming undetectable. It's also very commonly abused by SFW on voice comms to make it nigh impossible to mindgame or catch any of the four survivors off guard. It's especially hurtful if you're playing Trapper or Hag since it completely removes any unpredictability of your power, as well as Freddy since he's always visible at any range if you're asleep due to his lack of terror radius. The perk needs to be removed from the game completely.
---
Sorry I forgot to ask in my original post what rank are you? And what survivor do you play and what clothes do you wear?
---
It takes 1 minute for a survivor to automatically enter the dream state (1:30 if they woke up from a clock). Freddy injuring a survivor with his basic attack instantly pulls them into the dream state.
---
Red horse bayan?
---
Rank 5 bloody Claudette.
---
Like I said in the post, I said I'd TRIED it, not am currently TRYING it. My strategy so far has been exactly what you said; I said fuck this bullshit and just started running builds centred around being chased. My issue is that I want to be doing generators and getting saves and shit, but it never happens because I keep getting teams that can't do gens while I'm in chase, and usually leave me to die after I get found.
---
Preventng people from playing with their friends would most likely kill the game.
---
Agreed. BHVR should balance killers based on quickly they can down survivors from the start of the game, if they can't get a hook by the first 20 seconds the killer is too weak imo.
---
That's very true but for example on console with one button it saves the last 10min of gameplay. Same thing for stuff like shadowplay
---
You're right this kind of issues should be fixed by the devs but they have twisted priorities, let's say. I'm just told you what I know and how you can kinda solve the problem punishing them even if is pretty rudimentary tbh
---
Damn this is really bad. Ok so, learn how to loop, use perks like spine chill that give you an early warning on where the killer is. Also, try to just rank up to red ranks no matter what
---
That also makes me mad when they complete about 2~3 very quickly. But when it comes to only 2 left it comes pretty easy as you just hop the 2 making sure they cant fix it. Especially as Freddy, you can just use the add-on Garden Rake to replace your Dream Snares with Dream Pallets and it makes it way easier to down players who try stopping you with pellets and then doing the tebag. Then that's where your second rule comes in (well at least mine), instead of picking them up just let them crawl on the ground all day and then have undetectable on and wait by the downed player. Then when they come you go for the kill. I also do the same thing with hooked survivors, just wait by them with undetectable on. It's very useful. I know you probably dont use this setup at all but that's how I do pretty good even with the annoying players. (I call them trolls lmao)
---
We were so close to perfection... so close...
---
(Bloodpoint Counter)
---
It's only a good idea for solo players. For group players it would kill the game.
---
Killers running Iron Maiden are not rare these days, that run is gonna end when the hatch is farther away than the killer.
---
I'm stuck at rank 5. You'd think at this point I'd get teammates who are actually useful but I still get dumbasses hiding in the corner while I'm being chased.
---
Everyone with a soul loves that cute little prick.
---
I'm just a out to go to bed, but I can help during the day or maybe in the evening. GT is lespritdelescal
---
As a legion main, I felt that.
---
He really is, especially if you combine bbq and chilly with pop, after hooking someone
---
Who the hell would be annoyed by something so minor
---
Noed legion? Bruh
---
Save the disguise for a Skin Walker type killer.
---
I was still kind of new
---
And when Feral Frenzy (if they still have it) is activated they chase down the closest survivor and stab them.
---
Wait what golden toolbox? Is there a picture of it?
---
The perks and ability seem a little oni like
---
Maybe that’s where the golden toolbox has a chance to spawn during EGC?
---
No you actually never make a single mention that even remotely suggests anything you tried centered around actually viewing a chase as anything other than a bad thing that results in you being downed and killed first out of the game.  
---
You spotlighted hiding from the killer, avoiding the killer and not much else.  This usually suggests the person doesn't know how to loop or handle themselves in a chase hence my response.
---
If you can loop being found doesn't matter that much you only have to worry about being tunneled off hook at that point and that's why we got Decisive anyways.
---
You can play as Killer. Dont listen to those people who says dont play as killer. You should play as both in my opinion. Personally for me I play both because you'll get pretty bored if you just play as only one side all the time and can even get pretty frustrating so it's good to mix it up like I do. Wait about 4 to 6 minutes to try and join a match. It definitely takes a little longer in the beginning but once you start leveling up you'll find matches faster. (On a side note, if you do become a killer I'd suggest playing as the Hag. Shes still one of the best Killers and very easy to use. You can put traps down and teleport to them if they're triggered.)
---
I always hate when he and others talk about how terrible the killer is playing, when the player is destroying them and the others.
---
It's obvious you didn't try everything.
---
There is a glitch on PS4 where if you activate frenzy when there is a noise notification you can still se the generators.
---
Congrats!!
---
If a gen is completed I'm not going over there to check if there's maybe someone healing, I can't even damage it anymore, and at least one other survivor should have moved on to another gen that I don't want them finishing so checking completed gens is a lot of time spent for the CHANCE people didn't go hide before trying to heal.
---
Congrats!! I love the feeling of completion.
---
Their mind games were playing mind games causing their mind games to mind game the mind game.
---
if u think it is toxic then that rly tells me the rank u sit in
---
"wraith"
---
That's assuming your teammates dont have any healing perks and the killer doesn't have any anti-healing perk or addon. You should rather run something like bond or inner strength
---
Whenever I see YouTubers do this shit, I immediately unsubscribe. I prefer not having visual AIDS in my sub feed.
---
CI and Ruin are like two sides of the same coin, since both are delay perks based around gens
---
Ruin is ultimately stronger, since it can last the entire game and affects all gens, with the downside being it can be cleansed immediately and depends on luck.
---
CI is like Ruin lite, being weaker but better in that it not only completely shuts out three gens, it is a guaranteed effect not based on luck, with its downside being that once it’s over you have a wasted perk slot. 
---
Ruin for strong but RNG   vs    CI weaker but guarantees results
---
It's like if ninja came to Dbd...... Oh wait.
---
Just stop for the day, someday the game just hates you. Other than that practice running, being found first has some pros. You have a fresh map to use
---
How dare they play the game and complete there objectives
---
You don't have to do the full gen, just be working on it when it's completed. If you don't have anyone to queue with, just change your username, talk to other survivors in lobbies and try to get them to help out.
---
People just dislike self care. It's not wrong to call it a top tier killer perk.
---
I like it, but the gargoyle statues could just break the game by holding people hostage too easily. You could stop survivors escaping at all, not just through certain routes.
---
I believe the best way to do it. And even this is a little hard too. Is to touch every gen.  Once.  So that way what ever gens are completed by you and the other survivors. You contributed in some way. And this is even hard for me.
---
It's only on Haddonfield. Not on every map.
---
He’s never played any games at all by the looks of it
---
You waste a surprisingly huge amount of time
---
Cool shiny
---
Bleh
---
It's obviously taken with a security camera from 1977.
---
Hag mains are rare. Keep it up! Im a ghostface main myself.
---
Oh boy, here comes the downvotes.
---
Uh no. Sounds like you're new, but no they're on every map. Haddonfield is the only one where it's easily found.
---
The way I got it is by bringing a shroud of binding, prove thy self and a key with aura reading (didn’t have bond) so we all spawned together and wanted to stay together because of prove thy self. So long as you’re there for the last 1% of the gen, it counts. Bond/ key with aura reading is to see if other survivors are working on a gen so you know where to go next.
---
There was 1 gen left at the start of the video.
---
Gens werent done lmao
---
Can absolutely confirm. My best friend sounds extremely sexual whenever she is in pain and she notices it herself.
---
Swf often does that, goes overboard with altruism and fucks the game.
---
I need this! How did you do it?
---
Never gave an amount but combined with the fact that infinite load screens/getting kicked from the server count as disconnects too, I know there is enough for the disconnect system the devs tried to be a terrible idea.
---
Every couple of games a survivor gets kicked from the server. Its getting old now.
---
There are three different versions of vaulting.
---
The first one occurs when you don't run and just walk to the window/pallet. This version also happens when you are under the exhaustion status even when you run.
---
The seconnd one is usually the one people wonder about. The medium vault occurs when you run towards a window/pallet but not directly. This vault is slightly slower than the fast vault but does result in the same loud noise.
---
The last one is the fast vault that occurs when you run directly towards a window/pallet.
---
Just rush gens while the killer tunnels someone out of the game. That’s how I did it.
---
Video game is in real life. Please stop replying you are just annoying me, yes, you are annoying me even though you are on Reddit, not in real life
---
Up to 47 games now and I haven't tried anything? Sure buddy.
---
I just changed my name to "let's farm pls" and I got matched with a nice ghostface that let me do it :)
---
My chase doesn't mean shit when my team is nothing but a bunch of pussies hiding in the corner doing nothing the whole time.
---
Have you tried this build?
---
Lithe
---
Dance with me
---
Lightweight
---
Quick &amp; Quiet
---
^ this is what I’m currently running. I’ve lost some killers here &amp; there if they find me. You could swap out lightweight if you wish for Spine chill 🤔
---
Also 1 borrowed time, dead hard, or decisive strike can fuck noed over completely once the gates are open.
---
Idk i left it going for three hours and it still didn’t find one
---
&gt;If you don't tunnel youll never have to deal witg DS.
---
Untrue, DS is active for an entire minute, thats a colossal amount of time in DbD, i get DS'd all the time in good games because i can cycle hooks fadt enough that i find and shoulder the active DS after 2-3 hooks, especially if im trapper or billy.
---
There's a streamers who basically almost always gets 4 / 4 with camping and tunnelling. Technically it's not against the rules, but it is indeed not fun.
---
I would say stay with someone the whole time, multiple people if possible so you dont miss out on any gens
---
Using NOED is fine
---
Don’t let others say what you can or can’t use in terms of perks
---
Medium vaults dont exist for pallets, there is only fast or slow.
---
Also even if you exhausted you can still fast vault that has nothing to do with the exhaustion perks. The only thing that hinders you from fast vaulting is clowns gas, you can only medium vault while under the effect of the gas.
---
First: please be decent enough to blur names out for privacy. It doesn't seem like much but could actually be potentially harmful.
---
Now I have to say that I need to see the match before making assumptions on who played the worst out of your team. However it at least sounds like player 2 and you made some avoidable mistake. Taking into consideration that this game was probably in lower ranks I will let your first mistake slip and not consider quick downs as misplays. (You could've ran up and saved after the trapper went to hit Player 2 cause it sounds like you were pretty close to the hook) Player 2 should've just done a 1 for 1 after mindlessly hook-bombing. I don't know how close the hooks spawned but you could've saved Player 1 as the Killer was hooking Player 2.
---
Furthermore there is nothing wrong about prioritizing gens before friends. But with 2 teammates on hook... let's just say the killer can not facecamp both.  After realizing Player 3 was being chased you should've ran up to the hooks to at least attempt to change the tides. 
---
After that it seems like you just waited for all your teammates to die on hook to get the hatch (I dont like that kind of playstyle but ok... no problem, you do you)
---
In a nutshell there were at least 2 major misplays on your part and 1 misplay on Player 2's part. It sounds like you are a very cautious (maybe too cautious?) Blendette.  Again: not judging, it's just the impression I got from reading your post. I realize that you are probably &lt;100 hrs so I will cut you some slack. It's just unfortunate to get a camper. You'll learn how to properly deal with those situations in due time. However I got to say that your teammate has every right to be upset. Playing with or against too immersed people is just unfun (imo). 
---
May I ask which ranks this game was in? What were the perks used?
---
You at least had my attention until this egotistcal hubris kicked in, my god that was cringey to read.
---
The one on Yamaoka is also relatively easy to see
---
Congratulations man, nice achievement I got Freddy recently and I think he's going to be my new main.
---
I noticed you were using Bloodwarden and I'm wondering if that perk can be swapped out for something more synergystic with the rest of your build, since Bloodwarden is more of a support perk for things like NOED.
---
You could try swapping BW for Ghostface's teachable Thrilling Tremors. It synergises well with BBQ to give information on survivors, provides Gen stall on its own and is a great way to get the most out of Pop goes the Weasal and achieve maximum slowdown.
---
Last, nice. I wasnt even doing the challenge and got a DC when i just wanted a game, the first person on first down DC'd and so i quit too (as killer) suddenly my quitting is horrible and theirs is justified. Ok yeah they need to requeue, like the rest of us because of that selfish asshole. Really pathetic mindset in that community
---
Any tips?
---
I ve done it on rank 6. I had to throw match but did this with help of friendly survivors. I asked them if they can leave gen at 99% and let me finish it. For my perks:Dark sense(obviously), Bond, Prove thyself, iron will.
---
Overwatch Rainbow Six For Honor Undertale almost every game is toxic now
---
Damn, all of those downvotes...
---
Honestly the biggest big brain move here was healing against NoED
---
Tbh, you should just level free characters, not worth spending shards on that. Also Unbreakable is good too.
---
I personally think it is simply because PWYF will make chases end significantly faster if you manage to reach max stacks since even top tier survivors will be forced to drop pallets early or get hit. It will also grant you higher map mobility.
---
Dying light is a horrible perk in my opinion. By the time its slow-down reaches a point where it will have an impact, you will already be doing pretty good meaning you will not really need the slow-down. 
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse is good on the plague since having a general T.R reduction can allow you to get closer to survivors before they start moving. 
---
I still think the Nemesis + PWYF combo will work better than M &amp; A and Dying light.
---
Gotta love the downvotes for telling the truth.
---
The pat few months killers have become more toxic than survivors from my experience. Just this week I’ve had Billys that nods when he down someone, facecamps the hook, then nods when he tunnels someone off hook. Ags that facecamp then nod and gloat when they tunnel a survivor out of the game.
---
And the amount of killers I get where 1-2 survivors get disconnected or disconnect manually within the first minute of the game, and rather than end it for the last two the killer decides to slug for the 4k and drag the game out and expect someone to wait on the floor for a few minutes because its probably the first time they’ve ever had one, then they actually give it the “gg ez noobs” post game. This isn’t a one off either, I’ve seen this a good number of times now. The game is essentially a 2 vs 1 and the killers get toxic post game and give an “ez” and other such insults.
---
Estimated != Guaranteed
---
haha i love Ohm, the pg13 son of a bitch, except when he plays Mario Kart Deluxe with the Terroriser, Nogla and the others xD
---
I don't think they healed though? That claud was healed from adrenaline. Looks like they had no time to react. RIP.
---
Im posting my own stuff on reddit now cause why not
---
This was a really easy save tbh. Almost impossible for the billy to do anything in that scenario since you were 1) full health, 2) had borrowed time, 3) had DS, 4) had another full health survivor near you, and 5) you were right next to the exit gate. Any three of those make the save very easy. Two of them still very doable but would take some skill or a mistake from the billy.
---
I don't know how I feel about this
---
Ok... you know that’s just an example to describe the process of stealthing away from objectives, right? You don’t actually need lockers.
---
I usually.get to about 150k before I get way to tempted to spend them. A few occasions I have gone up to a mil but only when I'm about to prestige someone.
---
They ARE trying to be toxic and anger people. That’s evidenced post game where they make it clear via comments, and we’ve all seen the “hope your family dies of cancer” comments post game too”
---
But don’t worry, I’m sure those comments are just goofing around too.
---
That and the state of the art arrows that every youtube clickbait channel uses on their thumbnails. I don’t even bother watching people that do this anymore
---
That’s why I only watch HybridPanda lol
---
I know I'm super later but a dev once said that if anyone but Huntress tries to pick up a hatchet it explodes lol
---
I’ll prestige when I am perk stable
---
Oh I didn’t know that thanks
---
There would only be one statue. Each time the power is activated the gargoyle is teleported to where the statue is and the statue is teleported to where the gargoyle was.
---
Have never played at anything higher than 8?
---
I dont think so.
---
I say this because while I get all red ranks as killer, I get all the green ranks when I play survivor (and I’m a red rank survivor).
---
Seems there are tons of them out there you just won’t get them unless you play survivor.
---
They got the big mac, we got the big mic.
---
They didnt heal that was adrenaline. But the dumb part on the survivors end was that they both went into the basement.
---
Damn this meme's good
---
It goes to 70 right ?
---
So you need 45 Tier.
---
1 Tier = 12-15 games with 10 min per games.
---
You need 45 x 150 min = 6750 min in game time.
---
+ que times , lets say around 50% of your games times = 3375 min.
---
So you would need ~10000 min = ~166 hours
---
It is up to you bro.
---
Excluded challenge and daylie bonus.
---
This is an amazing example of the Duality of man. 
---
Am I aroused? Or am I disgusted?
---
You shouldve saved the 1st guy on the hook when he was downing the second survivor or when he was hookimg the 2nd survivor. Your inaction created the situation, those survivors were def not unsavable...
---
He’s moved house so that’s why he was out for a few weeks before
---
Use headphones and learn to track through sound, that'll really help chasing down survivors.
---
I don't play much Spirit but I would probably use BBQ, Ruin, PGTW and Make your Choice.
---
How long does it take?
---
Betrayal is such a cool perk!!
---
Take a look at youtubers like otz, scott jund or ussylis
---
Doctor: Let me go and leave!  
---
Steve: No!
---
I was stuck around rank 6/7 saying billy when I accumulated 3 of the freddy offerings. I've always hated going against him as survivor so I used one of them with the though process of if i get a 4k with no perks against purple and red ranks then I imagine if i had perks on him. I literally got red ranks 10 hours later playing freddy. He is probably the best killer aside from a really good spirit on console.
---
They didn’t tbag no but I think anyone playing killer would argue that it “feels” a little toxic going up against a swf all co-ordinating a sabo build. They had the toolboxes, the offerings for hooks, they picked the map, unbreakable, breakout etc etc
---
Its 4 people all on mics conspiring to take away your hooks thus stopping you from doing the objective.
---
Sure they fucked it up but its one of those things that makes killers “feel” like its a toxic team, out to piss them off
---
They were unsavable. If I went to go try and save the second person he wouldnof instantly saw me
---
End Game Collapse. Crate seemingly only opens in the endgame.
---
He claims he’s trying to get rid of toxicity in the game but himself and his fan base is one of the more toxic ones. He also constantly blames anything other than himself for his mistakes
---
Not a fan of this guy at all. Going for "90+ escapes in a row",but then last second swapping to Blendette with a Red Key and a fully co-ordinated SWF. Any decent SWF with voicecoms can pull that off, and he makes it seem special for some reason.
---
My only build difference to you is thrilling tremors instead of bloodwarden. It is extremely useful combined with pop because you can see if they are on a gen and interrupt them and knock 20 seconds off the progress right after hooking someone. Massive pressure.
---
Alright. Thanks!
---
Oof
---
Its actually easier to rank up as killer up until red ranks. This is fact. The devs have said it themselves.
---
The matchmaking is bugged right now. Also yes a lot of killers choose to stay low rank.
---
From purple ranks and up matchmaking is totally fucked. It’s not uncommon to go against rank 20-16 killers or play with those ranked survivors
---
StAr WaRs 🤧
---
I hate it lol
---
What a mood
---
I tried reconnecting 5 times and every time i let it go for over an hour. One time i let it go for 3 hours
---
:))
---
I love how Nancy just keep running in circles lmao
---
Agreed. I got to rank 4 last season and then waited for reset and got 1 in a week. Also hit killer rank 1 this season as well and I gotta say it is a nice sense of accomplishment to get rank 1 on both at the same time for the first time.
---
I actually just made a post about this lol
---
The majority of people who have gone for high escapes were in swfs, yes it’s less impressive but 90-odd escapes in a row even if you aren’t solo is impressive. There should also probably be separate categories for most escapes, both solo and swf categories
---
My recommendation is to get a character you have to level 50 with the perks you want and play them as you level up someone else.
---
What prejudice is this?
---
Realistically? Nah, but if you grind your ass off (talking 24/7 here) yeah
---
They should introduce more add-ons that are more than just number changes. Amanda's Letter for Pig is a great example. It shifts all of her power from her Jigsaw traps over to her dash attack. Drastically changed her play style from a stall killer to a pure stealth killer.
---
r/AceBase
---
Docta heugh hugh huh bzzap
---
Stridor, BBQ, Sloppy + Nurses, Corrupt Intervention or Ruin, and Make your Choice are all amazing on Spirit.
---
Stridor is her best perk as you'll be trying to listen for survivors a lot
---
As Hag, dont chase too much and just pressure with your traps and dont be afraid to slug then teleport to somewhere else and hit more then 1 person.
---
Monitor and abuse is a must have for Hag honestly it's so OP it was night and day from using it and not using it, combo that with Make your choice if the Survs dont respect the pop out and insta down combo.
---
Bound Mouse wheel down or up to your teleport button to get insta teleport hit for consistency, its actually crazy how many hits i got from changing it from Control
---
If your traps get destroyed make sure to put more down ASAP cause hag is just an M1 killer without her traps  and make sure to use LOS Blockers if possible in your approach since she's a very short killer. Hope these helped friend
---
my build i used for most of my climb was - Hex: Ruin, Monitor and Abuse, Make your Choice, Nurses Calling
---
That seemed super broken and so unfair a lot of the games 80% of my games i 4k'd after i got used to the mouse wheel scroll Teleport bind.
---
I only got a 0k i think in like 5-10 games in about 250 games in a week due to sweaty SWF with all flashlights.
---
Just practice and patience sometimes will pay off don't just teleport willy nilly sometimes putting traps around loops will force a surv to go to more other pallets then some other surv will probably trip it later for you to get them. hope this helped!
---
I find he’s not as toxic when he’s playing solo cause then he plays the game more like you’re supposed to ,rather than trying to get 3 head-on stuns or something
---
A Legion tried to frenzy whack me then I pallet stunned them. Welp there goes that ability for awhile lol
---
Congrats! I’ve been playing for a few months and love seeing how I rank up when I get noticeably better. You earned that rank 1 my guy.
---
I have 1 more week of holidays so i am planing on getting to 60 and buy the 10 tiers
---
Everything is OP?
---
*Thanos has entered the chat*
---
It's a pretty decent build nothing terrible. The only perk I would switch out would be Self-Care. Often times the 30 seconds it takes to Self-Care could be better put to use repairing a gen. In its place I would run Resilience. It's pairs with Spine chill to give you a 15% vault speed while injured during a chase. It also pairs good with Dead Hard as a last resort when you make a mistake
---
Because a few skilled players can't carry a bunch of people who only know how to hold M1 and do skillchecks to rank 1 anymore?
---
Camping killer?
---
*borrowed time has entered the chat*
---
I literally become a Killer main because the queues are instant. Like for real, i check ready and im already on a Lobby
---
How is undertale toxic (ive never been in that community)
---
Interesting but that will be hard to do unless they give her a timer like they did with Freddy and make survivor lose control temporary.
---
What rank is this at?  Mine have started to get quicker as I climb
---
I'm not sure who messaged me I just know it was somebody from that game I played, but it seemed logical enough to me for it to be one of the survivors since the killer killed everybody. Also yeah i just got the game only about 3 days ago and I'm a stealth built. I didnt want to risk trying to save the other two because the trapper was pretty fast. I was pretty far from the two that was down because he chased me I to the corn field somewhere. Yeah I admit thatsba mistake I could of made an effort to save them but I'm not a veteran by any means
---
So what? He would've had to make a decision. Hook the survivor or drop him to go after you two, which would've given both of you enough time to get to a safe loop and maybe even the third an opportunity to wiggle out...
---
A Nurse with NOED. You're so fucking cute.
---
I understand brotha
---
Try to create some space between you and the killer, looping on pallets and different type of gym will help you alot.
---
Please give us more info. I would kill to be able to do this with DBD Mobile.
---
I get the feeling this doctor was just as confused as you lol
---
4% for every attempt
---
I actually find it quite flattering, thank you! &lt;3
---
Guess my rank then... 👍
---
&lt;3
---
Yeah, Red moris and iri head is bullshit and unfun to play against no shame in wanting to have fun
---
Doesn’t count am afraid
---
Thanks. What is type of gym?
---
This is really what I want to know.
---
Blood lodge is the most survivor sided map in the game and thats what they wanted, every pallet is safe and theres loads of them
---
Yeah I figured you were new to the game. Don't take these comments too seriously. They are advice and an opportunity for you to learn. We can only improve by identifying our mistakes and taking some risks. Otherwise most of your games will end like this. The stealthy approach is something you'll have to get rid of if you want to rank up and get better at this game. You will get spotted one way or another and looping is the thing you should practice a lot
---
He can only tunnel ONE player at a time if he's tunneling. That gives THREE other players the option to gen rush.
---
Ignorance is a funny thing when you project.
---
You used toxic gameplay and thought you were the hero... you're not. People have told you so. Give it a rest.
---
Build is literally Stridor, Ruin, BBQ and you should be fine with earphones (assuming you can do chases)
---
Hilarious not creepy..
---
I am a Hag main too and Congrats. Try to not use Make Your Choice is kinda broken for Hag, and really not fun to play against. Only if you care tho, but it feels really cheap to always get a free down after every unhook.
---
They cant optimise this one.
---
Probaply because you aren’t on the latest version
---
More the end game chat that has me burned out. Bored of the toxicity at end of games
---
It's actually very close to the desktop experience other than the awful controls. Killers sure do love to hard camp hooks though.
---
You need to be incredibly close to them
---
Yeah it's the games fault right? Nobody has this problem but just you so it's not like it is on your end nooooo it's the game.
---
Unfortunately for you, my self worth doesn't pivot on how many digital points my 7th alt account is currently at.
---
I can do chases, I just lose track quite frequently. But I'll try it out.
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
Sound is kinda broken this patch, so you might have the occasional 0 footstep and breathing game with spirit, which will fuck you over completely, but otherwise she is very strong and you can also use discordance.
---
Or just use Bond- Empathy and run towards people doing gens, instead of doing one alone
---
It's a powerful tool for the Hag and one of the main reasons she can get quick hits on teleporting to a trap, but I know how annoying it can be. I'd be fine with it going, but to compensate they would have to remove the slow + reduced lunge immediately after teleporting that she has.
---
I don't think they would remove it though, because it's primarily an emotional tool to make the traps scarier - they wouldn't have the same impact if you just heard a BWEHH and saw half a Hag pop out in the corner of your screen.
---
It won’t let me update it so idk if i am or not.
---
I was just doing it for a quick Rank 1 :) now that it's over and i've got the achievement i might just use something else since i don't care about pipping anymore.
---
But you are right it's pretty rough to verse haha. :D

I feel like BHVR is doing the exact same thing blizzard did to mercy in overwatch. Nerfing them so hard into the ground when nobody asked for it to happen

Yeah, thank you. I'm trying to learn rescuing people even in a riskier situation. Tbh I did that a match later and took someone off the hook and it was just me and her but I then went down right afterwards. Then later she also died so I guess I'll just have to try to wait for the perfect moment

Yes, by changing your region to denmark again. Latest version is 3.3.5.

He post was deleted what a surprise
---
This guy was Rank 6.
---
Sorry, I meant 30 seconds.
---
Well like I said, I'm new to all this. I rarely ever be survivors. I'm guessing you talked on your own back when you said dont take it serious
---
Because theres too many toxic reddit people who wont try to understand both sides of the story. They only look at one person's point of view and automatically disagree with anything a person says
---
It still doesn’t pop up, ill keep trying tho because i really want to be able to play dbd mobile
---
The tome is, at this point, never closing. The rift will
---
It's under the stairs just outside the house right?
---
Learn to take the shortest route to wherever you wanna go, make sure your hugging walls and trees as you’re running. You are slower, so hugging whatever you’re looping is very important.
---
what's the trigger then? Is it the attack button or space bar?
---
shame :(
---
There is no separate button to interrupt - it's *supposed* to trigger when you activate a normal attack (not a lunge) within range of a survivor. It fails to trigger roughly 50% of the time since dedicated servers came out, which is probably why you're having trouble.
---
The Dark Sense challenge destroyed me today. I cannot get it done because it's like I'm racing my own teammates and I'm more likely ignore hooked teammates to ensure I pop a gen. It should be pop three gens in one match, not four. When Killers are using Hex: Ruin and PGTW, or your teammates like to bring the Killer to you while you're working on gens, it's just brutal. And this is me using perk builds that give me awareness of where gens are and what my teammates are up to and even great toolboxes. I have several matches in a row where I was seconds away from popping the fourth generator until in one match the last one popped before mine did and in the rest I had teammates pass the Killer on to me when I had seconds left to do a gen, meaning I either ran away and they popped it instead, or I risked trying to pop it and got snatched at the last second and then my teammate popped it. The second worst challenge behind sacrificing everyone in the basement in a single match. There's challenges and then there's the unreasonable that causes toxic behavior from Killers who'd rather not sweat to sacrifice everyone in the basement, or teammates working against each other, which is what I've found happens with the Dark Sense challenge.
---
You understand how mirrors work, yeah?
---
The element - Gold
---
EGC - Endgame Collapse
---
Golden toolbox can be found during the Endgame Collapse in the portal room
---
On console its just the attack button, you basically need to be in collision with them
---
Well then you clearly do not know how broken red ranks are. I went to red ranks so I could avoid tunnelers and high-rank teammates. Unfortunately, that is not a luxury anyone can afford/earn. I do not know what my teammates were doing, but I was focusing on saving teammates and doing generators. We got up to two generators left before I made my heroic play.
---
You're contradicting yourself. He too used toxic gameplay. He tunneled, so I disconnected so my teammate could have the hatch. To me, that's 1:1. It's even. People, like yourself have told me it was toxic, but what you're clearly ignoring is that people have also agreed with me. You are constantly bringing up the same points and you are constantly ignoring what I have to say.
---
Once again, is tunneling a shitty thing to do? Why do you keep ignoring that question?
---
You just dont want to hear you were at least partially to blame. There is no way you are a veteran player based on your gameplay. Maybe take some of the advice given by veteran players so you can improve, or else ypu will be doing alot more whining on the sub
---
Hobo Jake Hobo Jake!
---
Nm rework should be
---
Start the trial healthy, after becoming injured, you cannot be healed to healthy. You and your teammates will see the broken status on the hud, the killer will not see the broken status caused by no mother. That way, it just looks like you’ve been injured the whole match, not that you have no mother.
---
Eh I stop when I'm not having fun. I didn't bother with the challenges that were too rng based
---
No. It's in locations that you are unable to grab it. Under houses, under tables ,in boat etc
---
use medkits, you shouldnt be getting injured too often anyway so a medkit is enough
---
What's not cool is DC'ing, that basically just fucks others over for the entire match. I hate how common DCs are, it ruins this game for us.
---
No, if you actually look up what I said, I said I admitted that I made a mistake. I claimed I wasnt a veteran at all and even said myself Thank you on the advice. So I dont see anywhere where I said I didnt want to hear myself in the wrong. Your comment makes no sense whatsoever

 Ruin, Bbq, PGTW and personally I run nurses calling. Ruin and bbq you already know what it do, bbq is for ideas and blah blah but nurses is useful when you're in a chase, you see someone healing during a chase you can phase mid chase, the guy you were chasing ain't gonna know you're not going after him and the other one healing will be clueless about it so that's a free down. But that's just me.
---
Tips: Turn your headphones up, you smack em and phase you listen for their little "oooooh, ahhh" to track especially during a chase when you decide to phase. Strider will help you if you wanna slap that in a build somewhere.
---
Father glasses and bloodhound go really well together if you lose a person during chase while phasing. You can choose to slap sloppy butcher on for more blood to see but you dont really need it.
---
Not a tip: she'd makes a really good skin for izanami in smite.

You’d need to play around 500 games to get from tier 23 to tier 60 (without completing any of the challenges).

I suggest you should find streamers who are good survivors and watch them, it really helped me to get better at both killer and survivor. Analyze how they do it and why. And repeat. I can recommend some but they're all russian speaking so you will unlikely watch them. If you dont know where to start, there always is good ol' Noob3 :)
---
That mindset is the issue; it incentives crouching because it's just as quick as walking. So whenever you feel like walking, you will crouch thinking "wow I'm getting good value out of this perk" when in fact you should be running and stop wasting time.
---
The only way I've found Urban Evasion to be useful is using it for a few seconds right after Lithe + Quick and Quiet + Dance With me just to shorten my character model after running a killer around a corner. And even then it's still not that good for players who know how to loop (The good ones).

I talk to my chat if I'm streaming and if I'm not I turn on an achievement hunter podcast...facejam makes me laugh so fucking hard

I would like it more if all ( or just the one Level ) are active and not one at the time.
---
I would get less stress because I would not get "I need to do this right now so I can go on  / I can only take care of this task right now"
---
It also would make the rng one like "uncool the one that unhook you" (I know it is easy if you have friends , but I do not ok) or "kill 2 person at EGC " ,"stun/blind killer x times in game " easier

Noed shut up

I stopped caring about any time limited events or challenges in games. Most of these events force you to spend the majority of your free time on the game and many games have events running at the same time which forces you to pick and choose what you might even want to try and get. Really not worth the time these days.
---
If the killer knows there are survivors nearby they have no reason to leave and patrol gens
---
One major issue with Self-care is the playstyle it teaches new players - healing is a priority, almost an objective.
---
If you are injured and you DON'T have self-care equipped, your only choice is to get on a generator and DO the objective.
---
If you are injured and you DO have self-care equipped, it provides you with a second choice; instead of doing a generator, you can spend up to 40 seconds healing yourself in this sloppy butcher meta!
---
The biggest issue with Self-care isn't how long it takes... (even though that it is crippling). The biggest issue is that it provides incentives TO NOT DO THE OBJECTIVE. \*\*The survivor feels rewarded (gets a heal) for spending 40 seconds NOT ON A GENERATOR!\*\*
---
Instead of using self-care, use perks that allow you to complete the objective even when injured! Use Iron Will, use Inner Strength for the fastest heal (when you actually need it), use Dead Hard...
---
New players need to understand that you can still do the objective when injured. For some reason when they get hit, the only thing they can think of is "I need to get healed... I need to get healed right now! I need to heal!"
---
I understand that if you are new, you probably are not good at looping and thus feel you need the extra health state. But how are you going to ever get good if you never expose yourself to looping when you just hide and heal all game?
---
This is why I hate the perk so much, and I'm glad that more people of the community are beginning to notice. I used to bash on self-care by making memes which got popular, but the comments were filled with angry self-care users. Now I see less of them, but I suppose there will always be some stragglers.
---
Right but on the second killer we popped three gens simultaneously while she was camping away. And she just kept at it.
---
That was just unlucky then :(
---
i find that true makes the game way too technical
---
No idea, but its ''i'' on pc
---
If you place more then one trap at the hook you aint rank 1
---
If they would make leveling up easier there would be a lot less burnout. It takes me 4 hours of playtime to go up one level with queue times. Every 10 minutes of in game time is 600xp which is the max you can earn per game. 
---
They need to make challenges more like half the time instead of basically the entire thing or you don’t finish. Adding fragments to dailies would help a lot too. 
---
If DBD isn’t the only game you play every single day, you’re just screwed. Maybe if we vote with our wallets next season and at least wait until we finish the rift to buy the pass, they’ll change things.
---
This is why I like Noob and Otz. They both offer solid content and usually have good commentary as well as call BS when they see it. Aaron is neat to watch cause he does do good runs, but at the same time he always has a friend to help him which makes it a little less interesting cause he has someone to rely on.
---
Yeah, I see how self care can encourage a more selfish playstyle which punishes your whole team as you rank up. 
---
I’m just pointing out how people get really really mad that you “waste” 40 seconds self-caring through mangled... but very few people get mad when you have a teammate heal you through mangled which ends up being the same duration. Both end up being the same amount of non-gen time but self-care gets disproportionate anger. 
---
When you’re injured without self care, a lot of players use bond to hunt down other survivors to heal them. So it’s not like the *only* objective they can do is gens, their new objective is to still heal themself regardless if it’s through survivors or self-care.
---
It's just more time to rank up again. You get bloodier clothes the more you prestige and better stuff in the blood web.
---
Myers. Ghostface is shit
---
And by better stuff in the bloodweb it's like a .5% increase per prestige rank. Also you lose everything, offerings, addons and perks.
---
It’s honestly not worth it... spend the blood points on other survivors to get their perks instead
---
Basically the maximum level for any character is level 50. You can’t go above that. So you can either choose to keep your character at level 50, or you can prestige it by resetting everything and started the bloodweb all over again. If you choose to prestige, you will loose your inventory items and all of your perks for that character, starting at level 1 again. Almost half of my survivors are at level 50 and I can’t bring myself to prestige them as I love my current builds I have on all of them. :( 
---
If you do choose to prestige, you will get a piece of bloody clothing for that character, like a bloody shirt. If you reach level 50 again and want to prestige for a second time, I believe you get bloody pants, and for the third time, you get a bloody face. 
---
Prestige doesn’t guarantee that the player is really good, it could mean that they’ve used all of their bloodpoints to keep increasing levels.
---
ah thanks then. Yeah i learnt about the lunge through the tips and I use it liike 99% of the time lol since its like a dead hard but for the killer. I still do normal attacks and I've done it where im literally in range but sometimes it doesnt quite pick it up. I assume thats the case because of the angle/theres no 100%  contact
---
the ancient tales mention a luck increase regarding the bloodwebs loot spawn the more you prestige… But maybe it's just a legend.
---
Hey... it’s a red LEGO ;)
---
Yeah wth
---
If you devote your entire next 10 days to nothing but DbD all day. Every 10 minutes of in game time is 600xp which is the max you can earn per game. So if you’ve already done most of the challenges I doubt you’ll finish. Otherwise if you can breeze through the challenges (which took a couple days per level) I still doubt you’ll finish.
---
So is there a button that says how to reset or what ? I've never seen such thing. Ik on Xbox btw
---
Big Chungus
---
It really just shows they've played for a while. You can be a terrible player and still prestige. It's supposed to have upsides but you don't really feel them
---
The wall layout of the wooden places on the map- people call them jungle gyms
---
I just used bond and my friend and I coordinated gens. He would tell me when he had a gen at 99 and I would just come pop it. It’s infinitely easier with friends but if you’re solo you could try coordinating pre game or use Nancy’s perk that shows what gen you’re on.
---
But I like going over the cap to buy teachable perks and better items n add ons
---
You really didn't have to.
---
Run spine chill and resilience it will make you vault windows hella fast... you could also pair it with lithe
---
yeah this is false literally ask in who he thinks strongest killers are in his next stream he will say nurse/spirit Stier then wraith/ghostface are A tier
---
Well I play huntress and I dont camp so
---
I’m kinda just tired at this point. I’m of the group that found the challenges fun, so I got them all done ASAP. However, this just brought me into what I feel the real problem is.
---
The absolute fucking grind of the Rift.
---
After finishing all the challenges, I was at the mid 50s of the Rift. Without anything more to do in terms of challenges, I realized how much of a boring slog it is to get to the end of the Rift because of how much of a completionist I am, due to the fact I’m out of short term goals to achieve in the process. 
---
It’s one of the reasons that I don’t agree with people that feel all the challenges should be selected all at once. Because if that happens, you do less matches to get the challenges done, and that leaves you with an even more boring slog when it comes to getting the rift done. Imagine being at the mid thirties by the end of the archive challenges or something since you do less matches, with your goal being to get to the 70s. 
---
The rift grind is absolute hell and the best way to deal with it is to either make it so you don’t need ten fragments to get up a single tier, or make it so Daily rituals also give you fragments, or even both.
---
So once you get to level 50, there will be a notification on the bloodweb, telling you that you’re able to prestige. To do this, you click (hold down) the skull button on the middle of the web until it completes a full circle and you will then go back to level one. 
---
The reasons people like to prestige is that it’s said you can receive rarer items (I haven’t experienced this with my prestiged Ace survivor), that you get the bloody item of clothing which honestly looks cool, and if you do not currently like their load out, by starting at level one again you have a chance to get new perks such as different teachables that you might not have had before.
---
I heard you don't lose emblem score if another survivor is within 16 meters of the hooked person, and also if the hooked person is on their death hook animation. There was a third condition too but I can't remember it.
---
Yee but the prestige resets everything
---
#YES
---
Keys are annoying af
---
Can you hear if they are working on a gen while you're in that room? If so, it could be used to spook them a bit &gt;:D
---
Which part is he twerking on purpose? Can’t tell, smile.
---
Exactly what I did 😎
---
\&gt; Both end up being the same amount of non-gen time but self-care gets disproportionate anger.
---
As I said, I'm not arguing about how long it takes to heal. You are correct, the non-gen time is true for both.
---
My point is this: I'm arguing that self-care provides the incentives to heal, when (if you want to be an optimal effective survivor) healing should rarely IF EVER be an objective.
---
\&gt; lot of players use bond to hunt down other survivors to heal them.
---
Again, these survivors are using perks to allow them to NOT do the generators.
---
\&gt; their new objective is to still heal themself regardless if it’s through survivors or self-care.
---
That's what I hate. Just don't heal, get on a generator. Don't make healing an objective.
---
I hate players who use self-care because it's selfish. Not because of the 40-second timer - because they are giving themselves an edge (healing themselves) over the rest of the team when they should be doing generators like the rest of us.
---
I hate players who use self-care also because it helps the killer. Several times a match, while healing, they might as well be dead because they are not contributing whatsoever. They might as well die, then reappear in another corner of a map fully healed - their presence of uselessness is the same. Healing yourself is a mechanic added in by the developers to slow down the game and thus aids the killer. Self-care is a killer perk.

Ohhhhhhhhhhh. Interestinnnggg

I guess I’ll confess I just kinda look at porn while I wait.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eh5jie/audio_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
This is about personal attitude. If you treat them as a challenge that you want to get rid of asap and move on quick, you wont have fun. Because you will unlikely do them instantly. Sure some can be annoying and even frustrating to get done, I know it, I had it, but you simply should take it easy. It is a game and nothing crucial depends on it. If you catch yourself on getting annoyed, leave it for other day, it wont get away. It is but an attitude. You also don't have to play as an asshole to get them done. It is what you expect what you will have to do will make you an asshole, according to you, but again, it is personal vision, it doesn't have to be that way. You decide how you play and whether it is asshole way. 
---
I wouldn't say devs did bad job with challenges, personally I had my fun and it was nice to have other objectives than doing gens and surviving, there were bright moments, especially with my swf. I wasnt burnt out in the end.
---
But I agree some archives are impossible for unskilled players and this is sad. This part should be changed.
---
Platform?
---
If they just bought the game and can barely find games, I’d say 15-20
---
20
---
pc
---
Him as a character not his perks
---
Which is not an actual thing, if the killer is looking at a wall i will go through no matter anyones graphic setting
---
That's probably why I was waiting like 5 mins until I got to like 16 and now it takes like 1-2 mins everyone is past 20 ranks now so it takes longer
---
Yep. Rank 1 using Plague/Clown/Wraith/Pig/Trapper. Only gen slowdown perk I occasionally use is PGTW. I have never once used Ruin. I stack chase perks (Enduring/Spirit Fury, Infectious Fright, Brutal, etc.) and typically use one tracking perk so I can pressure the proper areas (BBQ/Whispers/Surveillance)
---
Yeah I was waiting for like 5 mins until i got to rank 16 and now it's like a 1-2 mins and I'm on xbox
---
Ok but why tho
---
What survivors do you get. For me ruin gets cleansed and about 15 seconds later 2 gens pop as I'm hooking the first guy
---
As soon as this game is not spaghetti code anymore so it can stop running like shit on my gaming laptop that deals fine with other, newer games.
---
So probably never...
---
I mean the only way to attempt to get them shorter is by making sure your NAT type is open
---
ywah it's not a good strat by any means but it's the most reliable for a 4k and when you can chase and down another survivor it can be beneficial
---
Very true
---
yeah ok but did you see the cool room?
---
That’s just where Freddy keeps his bowling shoes, don’t even worry about it
---
You still did a shitty thing. It doesn't matter if one aspect of the game is broken or you feel is broken.
---
You used disconnect to give your team a win. You're breaking the game for others... you did something shitty. You can pivot on any point you like. The fact remains... you cheated the system and did a shitty thing.
---
You are not wrong.
---
I liked many of the challenges, except of course the shitty ones like basement and dark sense etc, but the rift grind is just too frustrating. I also had a period a month ago where I was just stressed playing the game, and it caused me to flat out stop playing for two weeks, which should not be caused by something like this.
---
Gutted.
---
Same, stopped playing killer for the most part because of it
---
@MHArcadia
---
sorry, had to do it to ya
---
On a serious note, I feel like the challenges are fine and achievable. However, some of them are stretching it if you don’t farm, and some of them can be dicked over by disconnects, which is also a problem. 
---
You can’t be the dominant person to choose whether it’s a farm match or not as a survivor, so the best thing you can do as a survivor is to tell your team what you’re going for, and offer to help them with anything they’re doing. You have to negotiate to make sure nothing can be cancelled out, which I think helps supports the idea of teamwork. That, or you can use a SWF.
---
4 man swf focusing on the objective is already almost a guaranteed loss for the killer, its funny how they seriosly also bring keys with them. They're so bad.
---
There was one gen left. Just stupid to facecamp at that point
---
It depends of your rank.
---
As a survivor for me (Ps4 Europe region):
---
Yellow ranks (13-16) = instant queue all the time (&lt;15secs) no matter if it's morning, afternoon, evening, night.
---
Green ranks (9-12) = instant queue in the morning and afternoon, up to 2-4 minutes in the evening/night.
---
Purple and red ranks are usually 2minutes queue in morning or afternoon, up to 5-6 min in evening or night (but with errors and killers backout, you indeed sometimes need to search 3 times to have 1 game... That's unfortunate)
---
"AAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU"   x4.

I'm 400 shards away from the Susie sweater.
---
Just like self-caring, teammates healing can also be a huge waste of time making it a stupid decision at certain points of the game. Being injured isn’t that bad. 
---
Self-care as a perk obviously isn’t that bad, but 95% of people who use it are using it so stupidly that it almost feels like a killer perk.
---
He had noed
---
Welcome to youtube
---
Billy and Freddy are definitely not viable against top teams.
---
Yeah, the others were pretty done with the gen when he grabbed her
---
Even worse, you play Otz's video. At least to me, he is a bit too quite, so I turn the volume up a bit. Then the next video is Monto's, and I have to jump out of my bed to lower the volume. Who even at normal volume settings is too loud. 
---
I watch dbd content when I go to bed, and I usually fall asleep. But I'm not even kidding, Monto's "AAAAAH" or random shouting always wakes me up. I have started putting his content on ignore, because it's just random screeching.
---
There are a couple tweaks that should be made, but I really like the archives/rift. So stop trying to speak for "everyone", because "everyone" does NOT share in your opinion.
---
Thank you my dude.
---
They were absolutely toxic. They brought four Petrified Oaks to make it as hard as possible to hook. They also were shit at looping.
---
Finally someone says something about Otz! He is not even wholesome just kinda mature.
---
But yeah a lot DbD creators are getting a bit stale except for Cowiam? (I think that is name) because he specifically looks for bugs in the game and tests them out. He can really showcase how lazy or incompetent the devs can be at times.
---
claudettes are cunts
---
this guy seems to main claudette and loves clickbait, which makes him a cunt.
---
I get the mistakes part, everyone makes them. But you’re using respect pallets against him? Sometimes you have to. He also rarely slugs other than to give survivors a chance.
---
Tbf, dead by Daylight is a pretty boring game to watch for a long time. Just 1 game mode, 2 roles with different characters. That's not enough, there has to be more content from the game itself (gamemodes) to give content creators more to work with.
---
I personally don't watch many videos anymore. The only stuff I find interesting is seeing how toxic players get stomped or a video which is just 3 minutes long and watching how insanely fast someone got genrushed.
---
In all the right places.
---
If a survivor has had really shit luck or played well but their team was Garbo I tend to give the hatch. But if all the survivors are toxic? You all getting the hook....
---
I’ve had survivors be angry they escape (10 ranks above me) and I’ve had them be angry they all died. So it really just depends how I feel who I let live. 
---
The one thing that breaks that rule? Scoops ahoy Steve. He’s a cutie and can live. As long as he doesn’t get too toxic
---
I hope you're a female
---
I didnt expect this to be your reason before clicking. HA But yes, it makes me very hungry too.
---
Mobile DBD: yes
---
Yea I disagree with his opinion there. For Wraith you need add-ons to make him viable. You don’t with ghosty
---
a silent dark room with only crows croaking.an unknown shadow creature staring at you quietly and approaching but you literally cant do anything even cant just move your legs and run.
---
this is sure a horror game.
---
I don't what the fuck I just watched but it's amazing
---
His power is just unhealthy for the game. He needs a new one
---
Not possible
---
Or maybe challenges should give you more fragments? Maybe a master challenge should give you 10 fragments for a whole tier and regular ones 5.
---
EGC stands for End Game Collapse
---
Nice job! 
---
By the way, those are some pretty custom icons mind sharing them? &lt;3
---
Legion is literally the worst killer to play against what are you smoking?
---
But that can be fixed by hiding it. You'll never even notice it's there.
---
I've never taken longer than 5 minutes to get a killer game in Midwest US. Survivor queues are less than a minute even at like 4am.
---
It’s a little easter egg that you can find on most maps. In haddonfield you can find it under a bench, in family residence you can find it under neath the house, in grim pantry you can find it in a boat, in the game you can find it in one of the boxes in the room above the bathroom, in badham in a phone box, it’s just a little easter egg you can find if you put the time into it
---
I was just going to say the icons looked noice
---
That's a fair point if you're playing a killer with strong chase potential. However the situation for the vast majority of killers is that the moment you start moving towards them they will bolt to the safest loop on the map since they have a 32+ meter headstart. Generally the smartest way to play against OoO is by simply ignoring them until you can initiate a proper chase with them, but yes, as a Nurse, Spirit or even Hillbilly/Oni that can close the gap quickly you can go slap them
---
And then we have the survivor version. we are going to live for food. They could cook up a great meal
---
I totally agree, it should be much easier to level up. Increase the exp we get from matches and the number of fragments we get per challenge. Make the challenges doable in a few matches at most. That's how you keep the incentive to move forward instead of making it seem like a huge chore in which you have to invest all your free time or else you don't make it in time.
---
Nothing personnel, Meg.
---
That would also work!
---
That's why I use it :)
---
I feel the same. It took me like 15 matches or so to do the dark sense challenge. The same for the 4 pallet stuns. Doing that kind of stuff in brown/yellow ranks is maybe easily achievable, but in purple/red ranks with good team mates and killers is crazy.
---
This reminds me of a joke: Gold walks into a bar; the bartender sees it and says "A! U!"
---
Not so much to play against.
---
One of the best things about being away from my PC for a week and playing DBD Mobile is no Freddy.
---
You asked a question. People replied. This is not an arguement... it's people telling you were wrong and you trying to pivot on points to try and get the answers you want.
---
YOU DID A SHITTY THING. YOU MANIPULATED THE GAME AND STOLE A WIN
---
when my pc stops being garbage, then yeah, gladly
---
I can't stand seeing killers take me to the basement then as soon as I get unhooked he's already walking down the stairs.. That's called camping/tunneling and damn right I would rather dc then to give you your challenge that way.
---
Have to agree here as a survivor... I hate facing off against legion.
---
#fuckninja
---
I've had this happen to me 19 times. You do this, you get your name written down and treated accordingly in all subsequent matches with me. (Hostage Doc, Iri Head Ebony Mori Huntress, Insidious Leatherface, etc.) Fuck people who do this.

I like the idea and the unlocking of story. I never play killer so wouldn't be able to unlock that side of the tree. Cause I dont wanna be killer... lol but would pay to get the shards and unlock story nodes. 👍
---
Survivor tree.. I'm not even at tier 4 yet. I hate using flashlights and it's screwing me over.
---
It’s gotten to the point where I ignore them I don’t engage in chases and yeet on first hook, from what I’ve seen everyone else feels the same.
---
All it takes is one survivor to find it and stare at it. Then you have a killer who cant move. 🤷‍♂️
---
No name and shame bruh. Just report them and move on.
---
Wraith isn’t low tier, he’s actually come back in to popularity because of people like Tru3ta1ent. There’s some decent builds for wraith now which you can absolutely stomp people with.
---
Away from my computer for a bit but if anyone is looking for a reliable squaddie add Farabee on Steam. Pretty much hit Rank 1 every reset. Also down for people to practice KYF with on either side.
---
I want more of it but the archive tree should randomised so everyone isn't doing the same task at the same time. Have the set tasks just have them appear randomly for players in their rail so we're not rushing to do the same thing.
---
Also encourage coop play on gens...
---
I actually dig this one, usually the ideas are fucking stupid or grossly flawed but this is solid.
---
I always assume killer is using deerstalker whenever I'm slugged and I'm almost always wrong lol
---
I just love it

ya it’s actually pointless 90% of the time and just fucks you

The exit gates are opened there is no other smarter play

Far away with a lot of fog on Disturbed Ward.
---
Legion’s official rework was due to his old, lame kit. Should’ve mentioned Oni if you wanted to make a point. 
---
It’s no secret the game is survivor sided but the devs have made some pretty decent balance changes that benefit the state of the game. They listen to feedback too much and they will hear survivor feedback more.
---
[This concept is so cool that I went ahead and made some chase music for it.](https://youtu.be/CjI0TdvVbqI)

Bro use the stabilizer tool in Vegas please you’re gonna give someone vertigo
---
The problem here is that people made up rules.
---
The moment you try something different you are not following their made up rules anymore and that makes you “toxic”. 
---
Same for strategy. If you try something different like sabotage.... Toxic.
---
If you bring strong perks or addons .... toxic
---
Toolbox? Toxic
---
Yes, this is an argument. An argument between you and me. I have not pivoted any points provided. I have acknowledged them and in some instances, provided counter-points. In reality, I did not steal any win; I lost.
---
To me, and others in this thread -I did a what Myers deserved. You think the Myers didn't deserve it. I know this because you have spoken very little of him and have also failed to answer, or even acknowledge the question I've asked you twice. 
---
You're acting stupid and letting your opinions get the better of you. You are failing to acknowledge counter-points and it is clear you are very biased. Therefore, this is the end of the argument; dare you reply once more, you will be blocked.
---
Yeah the moans are still pretty loud and that can be a dead giveaway
---
Thing is every nerf they do to survivors are pointless. The 10% of godlike players aren't affected at all, leaving the 90% to get screwed over instead. It's not really a problem on PC and maybe Xbox, but on the other platforms, almost every survivor is braindead. It really is a problem that needs addressing, but I think the only way to fix it is a complete overhaul of the game's mechanics
---
Let's not forget the survivors who disconnect on first hook and leave their teammates at a huge disadvantage. They hurt survivor side too. 👎
---
Toss a coin to your witcher
---
We brothas
---
Add in a gauge that fills on survivor over say 5-10 sec that causes the survivor to blink. Allowing the killer to move. Works in scp secret lab on the pc.
---
Would give people a reason to actually prestige instead of pure boredom
---
I would argue that the big nerfs to survivors they’ve made actually hurt the top 10%. Only two examples: 
---
The old exhaustion nerf didn’t hurt the common player, it hurt the good players who were able to get 2 uses of their exhaustion perk in a chase. 
---
The most recent balanced landing nerf. Casuals don’t care about not having stagger while exhausted, the good players who juke do.
---
And who do you think comes out on top when they either do that and killers get screwed by comms or they have to buff killers which everyone playing Survivor will complain about. The game isn't designed for comms which is why so many perks center around auras, and notifications comms just breaks the foundation away which is what makes swf so strong. With my suggestion only a 4 man swf really feel an impact, with comms EVERYONE feels an impact.
---
Cool. Are there any other hidden rooms like this one or is this one the first of its kind
---
i already posted this but somehow it got removed by mods without giving me a reason so i thought i should try again
---
Undertale?
---
If they're camping I'd understand frustration but two wrongs don't make a right, you dcing not only throws your teammates to the wind but also forces the killer to do the challenge again and again. You dc'ing is just making the process longer.
---
I always wonder that, when playing killer and I hit someone doing that shit. What if I was running noed dumbass?

More people need to run borrowed time..

Except when he starts recording there is still one gen left.
---
*Entity pleased*
---
Not that I know of. But probably
---
Im dutch and this language looks familiar? XD
---
Still you'd be surprised how many killers I've played against who dont seem to hear the moans lol and I play Jeff and he's one of the loudest
---
Same bbq and chillin sounds so fucking  good
---
Undertale is full of fanfic and lesbians how tf are they toxic
---
In case anyone is wondering about unidentified molecule . i thinks it,s Terephtalic acid ( 1,4-benzenedioic acid) it is commonly use as a precursor to PET plastic
---
The killer could place one statue by an exit switch, then use noed and remember me, camping at the other
---
A minute long frenzy.
---
I think if you stacked the duration increasing addons and the survivors kept Mending after you stabbed them, along with you waiting until the last second to stab them, the frenzy will go on forever.
---
what the fuck
---
Thats basically it yeah.
---
this whole post made my asshole itchy
---
I went from 27 to 70 in about a week. I got to 61 with all the challenges completed and had to grind the rest. So I’d say it is possible if you can play for 6-10 hours per day.
---
How do you slug non greedily? I'm new. I usually only slug if there's multiple people around me or if it's the second to last survivor and I don't wanna give hatch to the last person.
---
I use it on the blueberry bish spirit. Very strong.
---
O Valley of Plenty ...
---
I just wanna give the killer some free bp before I leave :(
---
Yeah killer at rank 20 is 10-15 minutes as soon as you hit rank 17-16 they’re nearly a half minute wait. I’d recommend using your shirt survivor queues to level your killers
---
Honestly if tbagging bothers you that much just don’t go to the exit gates at the end of the match. They won’t be able to teabag you if you’re across the map.
---
THIS POST IS A JOKE I AM AWARE THAT OTHER GAME COMMUNITY’S ARE TOXIC SO IF YOU  LIKE THE POST DOWNVOTE AND MOVE ON
---
People still complain about NOED? Yikes
---
...a friend of humanity!
---
Ok Garfield
---
I think he needs to be deleted. But I'd settle with a rework.
---
Fries misschien? / Frisian(?) Maybe?
---
Negative.
---
You're a fucking idiot. She's a videogame character not real. Plus she's literally a hag 🤦‍♀️
---
I usually play with Iron Will instead of Lightweight. You can fast vault and kind of loop behind the killer without leaving scratch marks and without being heard (if you are injured) This works especially well in jungle gyms and just the entire middle part of the Azarov's Resting Place map.
---
i would say rank 8 - 12
---

It really does look like it. I can kinda make it out, but also it feels like I'm reading Chinese. That can only be Fries.
---
"NOED is such a broken crutch perk." - the toxic survivor main that was safe and free to leave but instead waited on you in the middle of the exit to tbag, after they got downed with 1 hit and sacrificed
---
Don’t spread toxicity. Just play normally
---
nah man i feel like the rift just gave players like me who have been playing the same game for thousands of hours other things to do like try new perks rather  then always the same 4
---
The water level rises throughout the match.

At first I was like “uhhhh” then I was like “ahhhh!”

Hmm not sure. I'm on ps4.
---
Thanos says "Perfectly balanced, as all things should be"
---
I loved Betrayal's concept, it has strong effects, but getting tokens is also hard. It would a pretty neat perk, with the concept of the obsession betraying their team for bloodpoints. Gross Neglicence, however... would be pretty much a free hit at every pallet you have it, all you gotta do is respect the pallet, force the survivor to play it (and therefore vault it) and then just keep chasing them - if they leave the loop they get hit, if they stay the pallet disappears and they also get hit.
---
Pretty sure this is just about morals. But I'd say if you meet the killer who camped you, while he/she is playing as a survivor, go ahead and camp him/her. But don't take it out on randoms, or the cycle will go on.
---
It’s where he keeps his death note
---
No no no never on randoms just on People who have camped me
---
Ignore people who want attention, go for the ones who are doing gens
---
Thought you were leaving. It's not like you don't know how... just hit ĎISCONNECT. 👍
---
Imagine doing this play without the safety of your 60 second Divine Shield.
---
That's a great idea that I haven't seen come up yet. Really good. =)
---
Not in my experience, against camping my team just sits near the hooked survivor but never does gens or goes for unhookJust wastes time
---
Hell yeah, teach them karma
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
Aqua Teen Hunger Force, good show albeit weird af sometimes.

He's tough especially when the thing pops that shows him/her where everyone is. 😱
---
But there's ways round him... just gotta hope I'm.not on my dwight as his perks are all team boosters. No exhaustion perks which means easy pret for legion
---
I can tell you that that survivor loves you.
---
I tried watching him, but he just comes across as this cocky dickwad who needs back up to do anything.
---
Huntress is hard to play. Normally if someone struggles to play a killer they resort to camping.

he's my friend :) he just recently got dbd and i'm teaching him how to play!
---
Well, by default it's a 1/4 chance so it's typical.
---
Laughs in Joey.
---
I like the pallet perk
---
I have used blue-haired Feng since it came out and I've never had a killer get tilted at me for having it. I feel that's super exagerrated.
---
It’s not hypocrisy. They ruined your experience so you ruin theirs. I’d try to tell it to the other survivors though so they don’t do the same to you later lol
---
Honestly if the last survivor boops the snoot they can do what they want, i dont mind. My snoot is booped so im satisfied

Dont. Just dont

Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer (4vs1) horror game where one player takes on the role of the savage Killer, and the other four players play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being caught and killed.
---
Second worst.
---
First was Ghostface
---
Dude, just stare harder. /s
---
I honestly can barely play Laurie or Claudette at all, because I end up getting tunneled and facecamped for some reason. I wouldn't even dare to use that Nea head cosmetic anymore.
---
Leatherface is my spirit animal since he has an obsession with eating meat.
---
They need to stop being toxic yes.
---
Killers also need to stop slugging for the 4k when a survivor or two disconnects or gets kicked from the game early. You didn’t earn your win, you were handed it on a plate. No need to sweat and make the survivors wait longer, they got robbed during the game more than you did.
---

You're right. I made  this using the default windows video editing app which I don't believe has a stabilisation feature. Lets see if u/stabbot_crop can fix this for me.

New Doctor Rework Power : Portable Sacrifice Hook

He's undeniably good at the game, but also hypocritical. While he doesn't teabag or flashlight click, in his survivors games he has no qualms shit-talking the killer for not playing as well as he would to his thousands of viewers.
---
Monstrous Shrine is pretty useless. I would change it to Monitor&amp;Abuse, which reduces your terror radius 8 meters while not in chase. Otherwise I think it's good bulid

---
Nah, the rift gave people something to do and gain rewards from it. It allowed for the lore hungry people to learn more about the characters they've spent years or weeks getting to know. It forces players to play in different ways, perks, characters etc.
---
Some of the challenges are difficult, sure, but they are doable and it feels good when you are actually able to pull it off.
---
What ruins the experience is what has always ruined the experience in many aspects of this game.....the playerbase. People dc and use other tactics to just fuck up the challenges for other people. 
---
The rift far from being the worst thing to happen to the game. Just because its hard for YOU doesn't mean it is a bad thing.
---
People be saying Jane was the first Thiccc character in DBD but Clown has been right here the whole time. Just a whole bowl of oatmeal.

Anyone else notice these types of stories always say "I HaVe FaCeD  "x" aMoUnT iN a RoW"?

Lampkin Lane without Balanced Landing? You just blow in from stupid town?

I'm also a new person to the game. I feel like the game is a lot funner when you can let go a bit. By design, you will not escape every match. You will have teammates who, by their inability to communicate, will be unable to match their playstyles with you. Just breath out the salt, or it'll make you have a bad play session.
---
Have you tried playing as killer??

I just stopped when I got bored. Finished em all eventually.

When I was playing last night I ran into a very pleasant group of what I believe was a SWF. One of them had the name "4 pallet stuns= kill", so I assumed he was going for the tome challenge and I decided to help him out. After he realized that's what the goal was, the entire team flocked to me and helped me complete my goal of getting 6 survivors caught in traps in a single game. They all got hooked twice and I let them all go at the end, and postgame chat was very happy and wholesome. Remember guys, as toxic as some people who play this game can be, there are still plenty of great, friendly players out there too.
---
Yeah, it's always Plague, Myers, or very rarely, Wraith.
---
Also a comms ban
---
When I started the game, I used to get warned a lot about how toxic the community is... However, I think that with the bad, there's a lot of good inside of it. I've had amazing games, because of great individuals that have later on become good friends of mine.
---
This week is a testament to how awesome this community can be - I went up against a Legion with a friend of mine. The two other players did instant DCs, and the Legion could have easily killed us. Instead, the Legion let us fulfill our challenges and we helped them get lots of points too. That Legion now plays with us, and has become someone that we can play with as well as just have fun.
---
Well I'd say try and find a squad to play with if you're new. Being a solo survivor at high ranks is usually a hit or miss, sometimes you get some really good teammates who know what they're doing and with a killer who respects pallets to the point that they lose you, or her times you find yourself on second stage in the first 3 minutes with a killer whose camping and your teammates are all t-bagging in a corner, (both have happened to me when I first started lol) and about everything in between. If you can't find anyone to squad up with then you might want to learn how to 360 and loop pallets to the maximum efficiency if you don't already.  Also if you find yourself getting killers who use ruin a lot, use small game, helps me a lot. Tell me if I missed anything or you're still puzzled or something, I'll reply with any other advice if you need it.
---
Ed
---
For me personally in either out second or third try or the killer hooks someone on the other side of the map, wanders over and grabs me. There seems to be no middle ground.
---
That was most unfortunate.
---
I mean they are just giving you free points, no real reason to get annoyed there. Especially if it's Legion or LF, tons of points if they get to hit multiple guys.
---
I usually try to give the killer a hit at the exit gates before I leave, unless they are really far away. If it's doc they will usually shock me a couple of times before that. Some more dickish ones will try to take advantage of that to backflip me, but conveniently if you do an emote you cannot get backflipped so it never works.
---
Unrelenting is a rather useless perk, if you're fairly new to the game it's fine for the time being but as you play more it loses what little value it has very quickly.
---
"at exit gates"
---
Y not, it's free points. I appreciate it when I'm playing killer.
---
They usually position themselves in a way where they fall on the exit line if they were to get downed.
---
*reads title* It's rare, but yes. I have run into some honorable players.
---
And that's why we run Bond instead, ladies and gents.
---
I think you're totally right. Another thing to remember is that you have to factor in how long you're able to distract the killer when injured vs healed. Say you can loop a killer for a certain amount of time while injured, before getting downed. If while healed, you can take a hit, and loop the killer for 32+ more seconds than when injured, it was worth self healing. Since the time you wasted healing has been made up for by buying time for your team in distraction.

Carried or nah?
---
All powers have downsides, even the best killers have stuns, cooldowns, recharges, and even some hard counters. I never said they don't I just said Legion has the most, whether or not they are the most severe isn't the point I'm making, even though they do have the 2nd longest self-stun in the game...
---
It's a tv. I'm an Xbox player
---
No real reason to get so serious either about this meme. It's not annoying, it's just stupid and a waste of time. 
---
The amount of BPs for that one hit is insignificant, what I need you to do is get out as soon as possible so we can start a new match, no need to teabag for the entire time of the Endgame. Just saying :)
---
Yea I like the idea that they can search chests to find them, cause that’s kinda the fun in searching a chest but not when they bring a key with their swf lobby. Keys should only let one survivor escape via hatch.
---
Try rust toxic as fuck lol
---
Yeah, there's just no reason to be toxic at all.
---
and if you run tombstone piece and J Myers memorial, you can Mori probably around 2 people rather quickly. So are you expecting the emblem system to take into account each separate add-on the killer uses, or should a killer be rewarded easy pips no matter what?
---
While I find Urban to not be great in general, Self Care is 100% dependent on the user. Kinda like Dead Hard, you can tell an experienced person using it from a noob using it.
---
Oh god, YES
---
Self Care is god tier for solo play though.
---
\^ this but i actually started recording long before that, i got hooked when there was two gens left. I just decided to cut that out as i thought the video would be too long.
---
Somebody counter this with the pig subbreddit
---
The only time I bring them, is when I want to get my adept survivor trophy without spending too much time on it. Otherwise my keys are just collecting dust.
---
I do remember this one time I was up against a Hag, 4 or 5 gens were done, one survivor dead, a Meg escaped through the hatch with a key, the Hag closed it. Downed a Claudette, hooked her, she died instantly because it was her 3rd hook and the hatch opened again for me to escape. It was a huuuuge *oof*-moment for the killer, I'm sure.
---
Still in the honeymoon phase I see. Lucky you.
---
Urban just makes you Crouch at walking speed, you might as well just walk around.
---
Fixated is the perk you want to play with Sprint Burst.

I despise the EGC ones. I'm currently stuck on the *Sacrifice 2 (Hook) Survivors during EGC with NOED*. Like, when I solo alone, people don't stay around for EGC. When I am killer, the ballsiest individuals come out to get hook survivors, and I admire them for it. Just once, let me get this challenge, so I can stop playing Killer.
---
Keys and Moris need their logic reworked tbf
---
Please elaborate
---
I’m assuming you haven’t heard Yui....
---
I like mess smug look, and trapper’s unfortunate fate.
---
What do you mean. Iron will is so good for staying injured and not caring. Sound is so important for killers, especially spirit.
---
I've played this game for a year and have NEVER seen this.
---
What are you doing to your team?
---
C u r s e d
---
The idea behind The Legion is that they'll slow down gen speed by making sure survivors are always injured and being forced to heal 24/7. The only problem is that when you're injured 24/7 there's no longer a point in healing if you're just gonna get injured again, ultimately meaning no gens are actually slowed all that much.
---
That, I can agree on. I think the only reason keys haven't been nerfed yet is because of the "Where did they go" trophy and the fact that it's nigh inpossible to change trophy requirements for console (or at least PS4), since we still have the 'Down 100 survivors with a hatched from further than 32 meters away as Huntress' trophy. The 'Left for Dead' trophy is also still in the game, which is pretty much impossible to get with the egc, unless you are farming because 3 team mates DC'd
---
“Ugh what now?”
---
One of the Fog Whisperers, that will have my eternal respect is Paulie Esther. Dude was very upfront about the Rift and its problems when it came out - Hell, he even advise people not to buy the pass from the get go and just grind it out to see where they ended, before splurging and losing money.
---
He mentioned all the things you guys said, and I wholeheartedly agree. I wish they could include fragments even with leveling. That would make it all easier to achieve.
---
No and I am glad that I see less and less players using it at r1...
---
That’s a goofy trophy
---
It is an UR add-on that also has a massive cooldown, I'm thinking like an extra 10 seconds or so, survivors would still have quick mending and all that. Also keep in mind how I also mentioned lengthening the stun and shortening the duration if it's only used on 1 person. Definitely wouldn't be like old Legion. I also just said that in general, I wouldn't be against also shortening the bleed out either or removing even more from the Frenzy with this add-on.
---
Also I never said how much slowdown, but it can be stacked with the usual perks to have a decent effect I'm thinking only like 5-10%, especially since it will almost always be constant, so idk how you can say it won't do anything, not to mention it's only 1 add-on.
---
Yes my whole point is to make it worth Frenzy hitting multiple people. As a Legion player myself I do think you shouldn't get much use out of your power if you're only hitting 1-2 people with Frenzy the whole time since that is the whole purpose of your power in the first place, switching between targets. Which is why I suggested in the 1st paragraph of boosting your duration and speed while also reducing your stun afterwords the more you hit survivors so it can better facilitate your power, encourage you for using it as such, and discourage you for just tunneling 1 person with it.
---
In turn this will give survivors an incentive to spread out as much as possible to counter it and make almost every instant of grouping up dangerous for them.
---
I can't tell you how many times people just refuse to heal me. Hate relying on others to keep me alive.
---
Ngl I love legion for the cosmetics. His power sucks and isn't fun to use or play against.
---
This actually happened to me recently, minus the noed. The Bill refused to leave (last survivor left), and chose to die to the entity. Messaged him why after, and he said he didn't want me to be lonely with all the survivors gone lol
---
If it's not obvious: These two very original guys kept running to the other side of the map so that I can't bring them to the basement.
---
Idk I appreciate the extra points when survivors do that for me as killer. I guess it differs from person to person.
---
Sure if the guy is on the other side of the map then I'll leave after everyone at the gates gets healed, but otherwise it's fine imo.
---
What rank are you? It never happens to me in red ranks. What happens very often is, that all the selfcare users want to heal everything.
---
Not a better feeling when 3 guys are self caring against legion :)
---
Activate-able Perk.
---
Standing within the Killer's Terror Radius while not in a Chase for 45 seconds activates Diversion.  
---
Once Diversion is activated, press the Active Ability button while looking at the killer or a survivor and motionless to fire six shots into their skull, ending the trial for them instantly.
---
Diversion deactivates once it has been used.

I'm at rank 1, and everyone always only focus gens. I mean like, suicidal levels. They never heal. They might as well be Exposed for the whole match. They try so desperately for the Adrenaline but they die before they get it since chases are so short because they're already hurt and go down in one hit.
---
I understand non-heal if it's against Legion though.

I don't think you can DS AND spend every pallet in the map at the same time, i mean, that timer is running out, may as well get grab'd for it to come into play, otherwise is free pallet cleaning
---
I like how it looks too. Plus I'm kinda bad at DBD so if killers see me do a silly hopefully they know I'm not toxic, I'm just a dumbass in a cool outfit
---
MY NAME IS
---
And most of the time - that's good. That's what I as a killer main, consider "genrushing" and that's what I do as a survivor too :D
---
Generally speaking, working on gens is far better then healing.
---
It's more often the survivor after you've looped and T-bagged then finally get downed
---
You can pull them while healthy from lockers and gens tho
---
I’ve been getting some really good games with Legion absolutely loving playing her/him.
---
You can just get in there with nurse and nobody has found until now?
---
It would also be nice if they added a clown skin for micheal like he was dressed as in the first movie when he killed his sister
---
*surprised pikachu face*
---
Ima be honest, I just farmed most challenges so I’m not really against most of them. Though the ones like dark sense and six feet under should be tuned IMO
---
bitter murmur its actually pretty good, give it a try until u get more perks
---
But chases are way too short. Can't lead the killer on if the chase lasts less than ten seconds because you're already hurt and Dead Hard didn't help. Only cases where non-healing is good is EW3 Myers, Plague, or a really really good Leatherface (speaking in terms of killer powers)
---
Who said that was a bug? You do what is commonly nown as burning them, it works for nurse too when preparing for phasing
---
No?
---
Ha ha funny meme very funni he he ho ho
---
Nah it’s pretty obvious lol. That sucks. Glad I didn’t have to deal with it. I got it second go
---
Short? Chases in red ranks last at least 30 seconds before I even manage to  injure a survivor...
---
Then do the same as they did with Demogorgon
---
Another low effort may may huh
---
I went up against a very high rank SWF recently and as a rank 20 killer (thanks matchmaking) they absolutely clowned me. I was close to just standing in a corner and letting them finish the game that's how bad it got. When they realised I was baby they started letting me hit them and hook them to get bloodpoints. They all escaped obviously but I didnt come out of the match with 1000 bloodpoints and a de-pip. Found that really nice.
---
Good job I’m working on it as well. Any tips for the wraiths adept challenge?
---
If you get 2 quick kills with Piece/Memorial then the survivor team is incredibly terrible considering the amount of stalk that takes (Piece + Memorial only allows 3 total T3s as is). If one tombstone goes off, survivors should have enough awareness to also hide during T3 or hop in lockers. Getting Tombstone kills is far from easy unless the survivors literally hand you it. So yes, it should 100% pip you considering the difficulty and power limitations of doing it.
---
I don't think the emblem system should even be a thing. Pipping made the most sense when it was score based for survivors and the victory cube for killers. Emblems force very select playstyles and punish you for actually doing the objective or using abilities. It's rather silly.
---
I really want Jack Torrence as killer
---
Because most killers at red ranks I see expect people to not heal and just genrush so injured people get smacked down and hooked near gens a lot. Extremely easy to cycle hooks this way. Perhaps this is why all killers have over 60% kill rates at red ranks now (besides Clown), since people don't manage their health and gens intelligently.
---
Don't know why, but this almost feels like a Half-Life reference. I know it's a hint for the golden toolbox, but with the beers, the scientists, and the fact that this is talking about atoms and chemistry, I'm getting some serious Black Mesa vibes right now.
---
Next thing you know he spins like a fookin helicopter
---
Why not both?
---
Jealous that he abuses the system? Arrow + op = some free views amrite?
---
Thanks, yeah the wraith is actually quite good once you give him add ons.
---
The two I selected, one made him uncloak faster and the other made him move faster. 
---
I felt like I could move across the map really fast. I don’t know the names but one was yellow and one was grey. 
---
Hope that helps
---
Thanks I’ll be sure to tell you.
---
If you want to get the challenge done just ask a survivor if you can pick them up off a gen, they will mostly oblige. I do it all the time on Xbox so it should be the same on of and ps4.
---
Close DBD before you load into the round. Problem solved.
---
"And then I ate his liver with fava beans."
---
"C'mon kid... push the button"
---
We are mainly NA PC but we also have some EU AUS and PS4!
---
&gt;It is an UR add-on
---
Something being ultra rare doesn't give a green light for making it bs to play against. Otherwise we'd still have old Syringes, Odd bulb and BNPs. For some reason we still have iri heads, iri stone and ebony moris but that's besides the point.
---
&gt;that also has a massive cooldown, I'm thinking like an extra 10 seconds or so, survivors would still have quick mending and all that.
---
By cooldown you mean stun, right? If the cooldown is far longer than mending timer then the add on won't really do much if they start mending immediately, as you will still be stunned as they finish and they'll still have a moment to get distance. 
---
If it's shorter than mending timer then it's old legion and there isn't much the survivor can do as they will go down either way.
---
If the stun is the same then it's old legion but shittier to play as. Still as boring to play against since there isn't anything you can do in a chase vs him, he downs you either way.
---
Keys are worse than moris.
---
You mori'd everyone and still got a near perfect game? Damn, good job
---
I only had blood warden on for that game because I had never used it before and felt like it was a pretty strong perk. (Quick flex incoming) However I never get to make it to the point where there are enough survivors left to actually USE it so usually I'll use something else like STBFL
---
I'm the one popping gens so hate me all you want but I'm getting us out just as much as the person running the killer around.  I usually pop 2-3 gens each game.
---
What a shit meme
---
A U! Get off my gold!
---
And then for silver (Ag) we learned it as anti-gold lol
---
The Latin based elements were so hard to remember (Pb for lead, Sn for tin, etc.) that our teacher gave us dumb memorization tools lol. Pb = pipe bomb = lead pipe. Sn = tin = getTIN a new screen name
---
Prestige 1-3 is and would still be useless...
---
This just adds millions of more blood points to a grind that already takes hundreds of millions of bp... (getting all character to p3 with all perks)
---
And devs said they won't do it.
---
No thanks.
---
Ok! Thanks for the information! See you soon &gt;:)
---
It just makes me want a 7th can of chicken chili.
---
I usually play with one friend who's pretty good, but my rank is higher than his. I actually got from 4 to 1 mainly in solo queue!
---
Why not BT instead of babysitter? BT is just about the only way to foil a camping killer if they're competent.
---
Fellow Red Rank Bubba. Respect.
---
I've gotten it a few times.  
---
I run it with ruin and thrill on the Hag. Last game I used her, the survivors would not leave the totem alone.  God knows what it even was but they kept going back to it and I kept hooking them.  Got it to 5 stacks.  Killed 2 right away.  Hooked the other 2 and they died on 3rd hook anyway.  
---
If they dont cleanse it once it gets to 3, it's pretty much game over.
---
Except my solution doesn't prevent people from playing with their friends.....
---
I love the idea of being incentivized for injuring a survivor then hunting another! It feels so good.
---
I can see where leveling killer is probably more difficult. I usually don't play killer except just to mess with people. A lot of times I'll hook everyone twice and then start trying to go for really weird plays or something. I just don't take killer super seriously when I play
---
I didn't even realize that lmao
---
What's a hoagie? I googled it but sub sandwiches came up.
---
They wouldn't need a reward, since everything would already be maxed out. They'd play this casual mode for the same reasons they'd play KYF now.
---
That's just the lightburn mechanic, it's intentional
---
I stopped when he called Wraith the 4th best killer in the game. That's worse than "Hag is D Tier"
---
I've done all but two, and I'm tier 56.  The only two I can't do is the Endgame unhook, and the 4 gens with dark sense.  Those two drive me nuts.
---
There is absolutely nothing ”toxic” about that
---
With iron grip and agitation, wasn't it possible to down them before they could make it all the way back?
---
No, it's because of the voice communication. Also, you have no idea why new people are coming in and saying it's because of their friends is just your opinion.
---
Welcome to the shit show, muchacho.

The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.

Did u spam gg ez noob facecamper?
---
Dude. That basement one pissed me off.... especially with fucking dc's. I finally got it yesterday using insidious bubba....I didn't think it would work but holy hell it did
---
Probably because you guys have so many different attitudes.
---
Dont. Or the devs will nerf it too.
---
Not possible on Family Estate unfortunately...
---
Hey, if you're happy with it who cares what's strongest or most efficient? DBD is a game after all.
---
ED
---
Paulie Esther was told there was a hint towards the golden toolbox on the map, but never actually found it, Nice work!
---
This is not every survivor who doesnt like noed. I’m not one to say it’s broken, I do think speed boost is too much. But other than that I think they should have it just to give people who are shit at the game a chance. most of the time you find out the killer has noed long before the exit gates are open. It’s not only toxic survivors who believe noed is a crutch.
---
People use it all the time.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eh7n22/im_brand_new_to_the_game_is_there_voip_in_game/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
If Behavior gave him more regular cosmetics he'd be played a lot more, unfortunately female survivors aren't only technically better (by a smidge) but they also get more cosmetics. 
---
I want to main Adam eventually (maining Jake right now) but for me to do that he's gonna need some more cosmetics because right now I'm not a huge fan of any of them.
---
Its because of the G value. You have to factor that in.
---
Immediately picks up Nea eating a DS and is surprised she had it.
---
Never takes advantage of PWYF + Nemesis + Black Box.
---
Gets good use out of M&amp;A + Pill Bottle, but uses it to bash the survivors in saying they suck at the game.
---
Thinks what the survivors are using is OP, even though he never lost a hook due to Sabo at all and only lost 1 hook the Breakout once.
---
complains he has to face camp and swap hooks when he is literally the only killer that can counter BT.
---
Somehow mocks them for playing like low ranks when they are low ranks, while also assuming they are high ranks playing like smurfs.
---
his comment section agrees with him and thinks everything the survivors were using should be nerfed.
---
I just got it using Legion in rank 2, I used the yellow ruler and mural sketch add on with Agitation, Iron Grasp, Mad Grit, and StBfL. The games where I didn't get it, someone DC'd or there was bad plays on my part
---
I like his denim set, just can’t afford it lol
---
(Six Feet Under challenge)
---
No!
---
Prestige just gets you bloody clothing...
---
Its said its also supposed to give you better chance at rarer items and addons... however anytime I've seen people test this the difference isn't noticable.
---
I'd rather just have a character at level 50 and get them all the perks instead of spending an additional 1.5mil bp per character per prestige... to get to prestige 3 is about 4.5mil blood points roughly... them about another 1.5mil to get back to level 50. multiply that by the amount of characters its one hell of a grind.
---
And after you get to prestige 3 you have to buy bloodwebs over and over until you get all the perks or the perks you want...
---
Prestige to me anyway isn't worth the extra grind for bloody clothes.
---
What do you suspect would happen if legion got a buff? What would the survivors start doing again? The killer is unfun to play against and should either be removed or completely redone.
---
What a pussy.
---
Using four of the same offering to make the game as unfun as possible. You know if they were better they would have sabotaged the hooks better. That’s just toxic and not fun to play against.
---
Except it happens. At least I don't make it the point of my content, it's a clip from an eight hour or longer stream.
---
No idea why you’re being downvoted. Being completely reworked is him literally being deleted and a new killer added back into the game with the same name. And everyone is agreeing with that.
---
Meme is ass. Why not use slowdown freddy or something.
---
What is this language of old gods.
---
Fuck you, now Im hungry
---
I thought the board said EGG for a moment
---
Hahahahahaha no one cares.
---
Baby Steve gets hard carried by Chad Herman
---
r/uselessnobody
---
It will be a good option when behaviour fixes the fact you get hit by the killer even after vaulting a window and running 10 feet Infront of it.
---
or a survivor who’s been looping the killer and doing gens decently the whole match and happens to be getting chased when the last gen pops and gets cheap shotted
---
This is the reason why I live is for posts like these.
---
If windows werent death traps right now maybe pwople would use it
---
My first time seeing a golden toolbox was on Haddonfield. It is under a picnic table so I assumed it was a lunchbox going with the playground environment.
---
Lithe is/was my favourite. Almost all maps have enough windows spread around the map to use it everywhere and in combination with other vaulting perks like q&amp;q it's just too much fun
---
Just delete him altogether
---
Oooh how I miss ATHF. Those old adult swim classics will always hold a special place in my heart &lt;3
---
I wish this could be a think one day. Really different from usual lobbies and at least to me, looks pretty awesome.
---
Honestly there's assholes in every multiplayer game
---
Not really. Just down her first, she'll dc.
---
That hook tech video tho
---
Big gz!
---
I kinda wish that there was less reliance on the Archive for rift fragments, and more rift fragments from standard matches.
---
I’m from Philadelphia, which is where the word hoagie originated from. Basically “hoagie” is just the word we use for “sub”. Other than that there’s really nothing special to it!
---
What about purposely frustrating your opponent is not toxic? Im not talking about bad looping, but 4 oaks sabo quad swf? I sure hope you arent a hypocrite and then also agree that forever freddys nerf was uncalled for, that permaslugging, tunneling and basement camping is fair play, and that Doctor worldwide is nothing to be worked up about.
---
I deleted the game to take a break because I realised the mindset I had with the game was killing any enjoyment I had.
---
Basically I ended my friendship with DBD(temporarily) and now Overwatch/Identity V/Darkest Dungeon are my friends.
---
Wow ur the first person to point that out
---
If you did it for that reason instead of saving the meg, you're no longer a good person. You're spiteful and petty, like a child who breaks their favorite toy so that their sibling can't play with it.
---
This is the friendliest community I’ve ever been a part of, most games are cancer compared to this.  Sure you guys are a little kinky but hey chef don’t judge 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
If the obsession is hooked, the survivor closest to the hook will see the killer's aura for 3/5/7 seconds. Post game for every survivor that survived, every survivor gains a bonus 15/20/25% to bloodpoints
---
Edit: if the obsession is unhooked within 10 seconds of this perk activating, they become the obsession. Only one survivor needs to bring the perk for all survivors to benefit. This perk does not stack on itself.
---
by cooldown I meant recharge, which is currently 20 seconds, upping it to 30 or something similar would be a high risk high reward kind of thing. It still has counterplay and while it can potentially be used to get 1 down rather easily, it will still take a decent amount of time to get it.
---
It is not old Legion, and also just saying it's unfun to lose isn't really a  valid argument. UR should still have potential to be good, making them ass and useless isn't the answer i.e. Odd Bulb.
---
Hell I also wouldn't be against just making it infinite Frenzy and that's it, I would say that's a worthwhile UR add-on and still simple enough to not be drastically OP. With the obvious caveats still in place of not downing survivors with it and everything else that comes with it.
---
Legion needs to be deadly, that is their main issue with their power, they can't capitalize with it at all against decent survivors. This is unlike any other killer in the game, if you oppose every single idea with but they might end up downing you which isn't fair or that it isn't fun because I'm now losing then there's no making any killers viable with that mindset.
---
I did it to let the Meg escape.
---
You ever played killer
---
pipping made more sense when you could facecamp your way to red ranks? Yea no it didn't
---
Because they both RUIN the game?
---
Fair but leave my stabby gang alone.
---
Lmao, really showed him with that, huh?
---
r/delusionalpeople
---
Luckily I just managed to get that challenge done as Oni on Rotten Fields. It was a very fair and fun match too :)
---
Make this the effect for WGLF please \^\^
---
Yeah I’ve got 1400 hours and I play a lot of both, some people are cry babies but this game is no where near as toxic as almost everything else I play. I’d say the only nicer community than this one is the r/btd6 gang lol
---
It takes a particular group of survivors to get a basement dogpile but they really are memorable games
---
Better to be able to crouch away and heal yourself rather than find a teammate who is doing this anyway. The problem is teammates are stupid and either too altruistic (farming) or not altruistic enough (they run away).
---
Congrats :)
---
This is just you assuming, but he is very good at the game so why couldn’t he be cocky?
---
Isn’t every killer right now? Even this hag is a GF main right now.
---
It is an add on, plaid patch I think. It went from a rare to a common add on recently.
---
I tried Fungoose but I feel suffocated watching any of his videos. Trying to keep up with all his commentary is just exhausting.
---
Tapp becomes a beacon in the fog that blinds survivors and killers when he hits prestige one.
---
They are both terrible.
---
Especially when the killer is using noed
---
If you got 9/16 points when facecamping on the victory cube the survivors failed terribly. That means you spent whatever time it took to win 2 chases, stare 2 people down for 2 minutes a piece and then win a third chase and get at least one more hook. So yes, it made sense because the only teams who should even have the possibility of falling victim to that should be in the 20-16 area. Any other group that falls victim to stuff like that deserves the loss and the killer should rank up for somehow making the most easily counterable tactic to work.
---
It’s noble gas notation not electron I’m literally learning about this this year
---
[I just got it.](https://i.imgur.com/cHLSEFT.jpg)
---
Thank god it's finally over.
---
They used 3 petrified oaks and they don’t even do much. Do you also think Tru3 was toxic using pink and purple add-ons? 
---
I disagree that sabo squads are not fun to play against. I like going against them since it’s not that hard to beat them and it’s usually fun for both sides so I would never see it being toxic.
---
I actually want to use that build! Im trying for Spirit Fury + Bamboozle + Enduring + Ruin.
---
I kind of dislike betrayal. Feels very unusable and even overpowered.
---
If you have him Ghostface excels at this challenge.
---
You could also try wraith with his silent bell and hidden red stain add-ons.
---
I dont see the nerfs working... I just destroyed a team in seconds this morning. The survivors are just not adjusting to legion despite how little it takes.
---
Rare to common. What the fuck
---
Still escaped 90 times
---
This Claudette buff is so op, she can literally fly now.
---
It’s kind of like the Ali-A of dbd, in a way.
---
I  got the 4 generators with a Comodius Toolbox, Bond, Prove Thyself and Resilience. 
---
You have to get lucky though obviously.
---
It's where he keeps Quentin's nudes.
---
I deleted the game today to take a break until the rift closes, I got the cosmetics that I wanted but the mindset I had for the game due to the rift completely killed my spirit to play.
---
So what you are saying is, you are scum?
---
Agreed, I watched his videos after hearing of him, and he didn't seem "wholesome" but he is a good guy.
---
Panda’s too casual, he’s not very good at the game
---
Where are all the survivors giving points at exit gate in my lobbies? I just get the tbagging ones who want me to get in chase so they can leave and get an extra couple hundred chase BP without giving me hit points. So irritating I've been having to moonwalk to them so I can get a hit, but 90% run out before I turn around so neither of us gets points lmao
---
What the hecc
---
Nope
---
Why would you not want free points?
---
Ayrun is really underrated, glad he is growing very fast :)
---
Well to be fair you also have the wrong mentality. How can you assume that there is a worse looper on the team? Like imagine for a moment facing 4 really good players who are all equally skilled (or near enough) loopers. At this point your theory starts to fall apart. Yes if they are at an extremely safe loop you should probably leave it. But what if they all stay near strong loops except when they know you are busy elsewhere? (swf) now you have to commit to a strong looper at a good loop or else just sit around while they do gens. How does this leave the killer in control of the game? The survivors can literally choose who gets chased and when or else force the killer to over commit.
---
There are some killers who obviously dont suffer from these problems as much, which is why they are top tier. Killers like nurse and spirit who can ignore most normal loops are actually able to dictate who they will chase and how the game will go. Incredibly mobile killers (billy) or stealthy (ghost face) can catch good players out of position. But the fact is over half the cast has almost no control over a match against 4 good survivors, and mostly relies on survivor mistakes to do well.
---
True, but at least Moris can't be found mid-match
---
I didn’t read all, but  remove anything...the devs need to see all of this.
---
Exactly, Freddy's set could have done this if dream pallets weren't inferior to snares own almost every way.
---
honestly i think lithe should make you invulnerable to the downed state while doing a fast vault 
---
maybe thats overkill but its my opinion
---
i played a game as (solo) yui against a hag with a lobby of two claudettes and one dwight who I had played with in an earlier match. he ended up getting pulled off of the gen but i was able to save him w a pallet drop ! it was my first save ever and i felt really proud lol
---
Theres a difference between asking people to help you complete a challenge and sand bagging your team by sitting in a corner the whole game waiting for everyone else to die.
---
He is very good at the game, but he doesnt need to be a jerk about it.
---
No but some don’t. I mean the other scenarios
---
God what poor soul plays that awful killer
---
I disagree that playing as a sabo squad is toxic since I don’t see it as frustrating your opponent because I’ve found it quite enjoyable to play against and not that hard to win against.
---
should be Jane LoL
---
I don't know the meaning of respecting pallets! ... Really, what does that mean?
---
I use it all the time.
---
I literally never said that. Dont make a straw man argument. I think very few of them are full of 4 really good loopers. But if you dont think those 4 man crews exist then I dont think you have many hours in the game as killer.
---
Also the point isnt them all being godly loopers, its them all being equal skill, and that skill being around the same level as the killer. This could be rank 8s or 1s it doesnt particularly matter, so long as neither the survivors or the killer are significantly more skilled than the other side.
---
I used the example of really good loopers because the way you describe it seems to assume the killer is very good at playing the game. So naturally we have to assume an equally skilled group of opponents. Otherwise this Is a discussion over skill level and not over game/killer design.
---
*Toss a  cut coin to your killer*
---
Why do people bitch about NoEd? Its really not that hard to counter. Break totems as you find them and you're set. Like yeah sometimes it can be crappy because you don't find every totem, but don't get pissed just because they used a perk. I play survivor and yeah NoEd can be dumb to go up against but 90% of the time they need it. If you're running a SWF and finish the game in about 3 minutes with no one being on hooks.. Then yeah, the killer deserves a break man. Some people get outplayed and NoEd is their shining beacon of hope. Besides.. You can still break NoEd during End Game.
---
It was hyperbole , of course some people use it on the regular, but its still not a popular perk
---
We all have games like that but that certainly won't be every game.  Also as someone that's been in that situation countless times where I maxed boldness early running the killer for so long but still ended up repairing 3 or 4 gens for Iri Lightbringer because my team were all Self Care Gaming potatoes I'd point out that if they are that bad you carried the game which means when you die it should be an easy pip and nice BP gain regardless.  If your team is trash just play to pip.  Takes the edge off if I die with 20k+ BP and a rankup.  I can control my performance I can't make teamates be good.  I'd accept that because the sooner you do the less aggravating your soloqueue experience will be.
---
Stunning the killer gives you more time to escape and I’m pretty sure if you stun them they also lose all of their bloodlust which is necessary if you want to be chased for a longer period of time.
---
One one hand most killers hate vaulting windows so lithe + a safe window = great  ut in the other hand if I run lithe or balanced landing I always forget I have it and dont make use of it. But that's just a me problem.
---
Respecting pallets is when you step back right before the survivor throws down a pallet to avoid a stun. This could backfire if the survivor keeps running as they could get an extra loop.
---
Being a dedicated Solo Survivor is much more stressful then maining Killer in high Ranks.
---
At least i don´t get this Trash in my Team, i just have to suck up Abuse
---
Nothing built in, but it is the hidden 5th perk for survivors; it just so happens to also be the best perk and biggest crutch in the game. 
---
There are a plethora of voip services to choose from - a good chunk of them are free to boot.
---
A killer Respects the pallet when both he and the survivor are very close to it and he stops right before the stun, but i don't know why a killer should do it.
---
Umm...
---
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
---
Okay, you know what? That's fair.
---
Both are good perks, but dedicated servers have made dead hard really wonky and a bit unreliable. I prefer sprint burst because you can 99% it and use it to gain distance. It’s also useful for early game. Don’t get me wrong, dead hard is still a good perk! It’s just not as consistent as it once was.
---
Keys exist, that's just part of the game right now. They suck, as do moris. But the fact that you can find a purple or pink key in a chest, of which every map has only three, usually containing brown medkits, brown toolboxes, yellow flashlights or broken keys, I'd say this is the fairest scenario involving an item like this, which, like eboni Moris, spawn about 2 times in every bloodweb.
---
If someone brings a key into the lobby, you can easily dodge the lobby if you want. Survivors can't know the killer is bringing a Mori until they use it, since the shroud of separation is also a thing, for some reason.
---
Idk man people are eager to disapprove of something incorrect even when you're asking a question. Just internet points.
---
Was this post made by the stabby gang? Sounds like propaganda to me.
---
Dunno what platform you are but I queue instantly on PS4 as killer. No wasted time.
---
Agreed, at this point it should be free to play,
---
That's true. But what's impressive about it when you have a SWF protecting you heavily? Any good SWF can do that.
---
what bug?
---
Ehhh I'd still probably rank SWF below both Ebony Moris and Keys in the crutch department but it's certainly in the conversation.
---
It was a thing a few weeks ago, they seem to be doing alot of different things with the lobbies lately, hopefully they keep this rendition.
---
The thing is that when you get to a loop with a window you want to use it as much as possible, with Lithe you either run away from the loop or just waste the speed boost.
---
all 3 were scum in this scenario
---
You need to aim at the shoulder/Neck area, as the Killers Point of View is there, not in the actual Face.
---
I also suck mayor with Flashlights, but i heard this whilst first-time using them for Archive, and it actually works
---
Honestly, if you use him correctly, and with the correct addons, he pretty much ignores BT, which is very useful. This quality is greatly outshined by his downsides though, making him more reliant on Add-Ons, like I said above.
---
Your point was "how is finding a key in game different than bringing one in."
---
My reply was simple, imagine the killer finding an ebony mori in game.  The principle of my point stands.  Finding a key/mori in game is completely game changing, and from the perspective of the opponent would seem very unfair.
---
As far as finding a mori on the blood web, yeah, but you still have to bring it into the game.  Players see the hidden offering.
---
Good one 👍
---
BHVR: we’ve noticed that diversion have been causing some MINOR problems for players, our next patch will fix that!
---
Well, they prob don't want to get stunned, and just smash the pallet right away, which is probably why people get annoyed with it.
---
Monitor and abuse isnt really good on doc tho
---
Gotta pretend you dont know there just gonna rush him duhhhhh....
---
I used to swear by Lithe starting out but grew to really dislike it because of one thing.  Window hitboxes.  Too many times I eat a bullshit hit the killer should never have been credited with and anytime that happens you're Lithe is a wasted perk because eating a hit gives you the same Sprint Burst your Lithe provides anyway.
---
I mean, playing noed on any oneshot killer is annoying and stupid.
---
Yes more obv sure, but it’s not like you have to be incredibly perceptive to see it on high graphic settings, as a killer you’ll have to learn how and when to make sure the survivors don’t see your red stain
---
Even better paired with the summer BBQ event hook. MMMmmm.
---
Ah yes that makes it harder then, didn't see the noed.
---
Its a difficult challenge. Its to be expected from people who simply put dont trust the killer. Not every killer is gonna agree so they do it this way. Scummy? Sure. But whats ratting them out going to do? Let me tell you: they go over to another game and do it again. Just let them do their thing and they are back to normal.

---
Hang on a second.
---
Hello?
---
- Barry?
---
- Adam?
---
- Oan you believe this is happening?
---
- I can't. I'll pick you up.
---
Looking sharp.
---
Use the stairs. Your father
---
paid good money for those.
---
Sorry. I'm excited.
---
Here's the graduate.
---
We're very proud of you, son.
---
A perfect report card, all B's.
---
Very proud.
---
Ma! I got a thing going here.
---
- You got lint on your fuzz.
---
- Ow! That's me!
---
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
---
- Bye!
---
Barry, I told you,
---
stop flying in the house!
---
- Hey, Adam.
---
- Hey, Barry.
---
- Is that fuzz gel?
---
- A little. Special day, graduation.
---
Never thought I'd make it.
---
Three days grade school,
---
three days high school.
---
Those were awkward.
---
Three days college. I'm glad I took
---
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
---
You did come back different.
---
- Hi, Barry.
---
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
---
- Hear about Frankie?
---
- Yeah.
---
- You going to the funeral?
---
- No, I'm not going.
---
Everybody knows,
---
sting someone, you die.
---
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
---
Such a hothead.
---
I guess he could have
---
just gotten out of the way.
---
I love this incorporating
---
an amusement park into our day.
---
That's why we don't need vacations.
---
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
---
under the circumstances.
---
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
---
- We are!
---
- Bee-men.
---
- Amen!
---
Hallelujah!
---
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
---
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
---
Welcome, New Hive Oity
---
graduating class of...
---
...9:15.
---
That concludes our ceremonies.
---
And begins your career
---
at Honex Industries!
---
Will we pick ourjob today?
---
I heard it's just orientation.
---
Heads up! Here we go.
---
Keep your hands and antennas
---
inside the tram at all times.
---
- Wonder what it'll be like?
---
- A little scary.
---
Welcome to Honex,
---
a division of Honesco
---
and a part of the Hexagon Group.
---
This is it!
---
Wow.
---
We know that you, as a bee,
---
have worked your whole life
---
to get to the point where you
---
can work for your whole life.
---
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
---
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
---
Our top-secret formula
---
is automatically color-corrected,
---
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured
---
into this soothing sweet syrup
---
with its distinctive
---
golden glow you know as...
---
Honey!
---
- That girl was hot.
---
- She's my cousin!
---
- She is?
---
- Yes, we're all cousins.
---
- Right. You're right.
---
- At Honex, we constantly strive
---
to improve every aspect
---
of bee existence.
---
These bees are stress-testing
---
a new helmet technology.
---
- What do you think he makes?
---
- Not enough.
---
Here we have our latest advancement,
---
the Krelman.
---
- What does that do?
---
- Oatches that little strand of honey
---
that hangs after you pour it.
---
Saves us millions.
---
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?
---
Of course. Most bee jobs are
---
small ones. But bees know
---
that every small job,
---
if it's done well, means a lot.
---
But choose carefully
---
because you'll stay in the job
---
you pick for the rest of your life.
---
The same job the rest of your life?
---
I didn't know that.
---
What's the difference?
---
You'll be happy to know that bees,
---
as a species, haven't had one day off
---
in 27 million years.
---
So you'll just work us to death?
---
We'll sure try.
---
Wow! That blew my mind!
---
"What's the difference?"
---
How can you say that?
---
One job forever?
---
That's an insane choice to have to make.
---
I'm relieved. Now we only have
---
to make one decision in life.
---
But, Adam, how could they
---
never have told us that?
---
Why would you question anything?
---
We're bees.
---
We're the most perfectly
---
functioning society on Earth.
---
You ever think maybe things
---
work a little too well here?
---
Like what? Give me one example.
---
I don't know. But you know
---
what I'm talking about.
---
Please clear the gate.
---
Royal Nectar Force on approach.
---
Wait a second. Oheck it out.
---
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
---
- Wow.
---
I've never seen them this close.
---
They know what it's like
---
outside the hive.
---
Yeah, but some don't come back.
---
- Hey, Jocks!
---
- Hi, Jocks!
---
You guys did great!
---
You're monsters!
---
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
---
- I wonder where they were.
---
- I don't know.
---
Their day's not planned.
---
Outside the hive, flying who knows
---
where, doing who knows what.
---
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
---
Jock. You have to be bred for that.
---
Right.
---
Look. That's more pollen
---
than you and I will see in a lifetime.
---
It's just a status symbol.
---
Bees make too much of it.
---
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
---
and the ladies see you wearing it.
---
Those ladies?
---
Aren't they our cousins too?
---
Distant. Distant.
---
Look at these two.
---
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
---
- Let's have fun with them.
---
It must be dangerous
---
being a Pollen Jock.
---
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
---
against a mushroom!
---
He had a paw on my throat,
---
and with the other, he was slapping me!
---
- Oh, my!
---
- I never thought I'd knock him out.
---
What were you doing during this?
---
Trying to alert the authorities.
---
I can autograph that.
---
A little gusty out there today,
---
wasn't it, comrades?
---
Yeah. Gusty.
---
We're hitting a sunflower patch
---
six miles from here tomorrow.
---
- Six miles, huh?
---
- Barry!
---
A puddle jump for us,
---
but maybe you're not up for it.
---
- Maybe I am.
---
- You are not!
---
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
---
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
---
Are you bee enough?
---
I might be. It all depends
---
on what 0900 means.
---
Hey, Honex!
---
Dad, you surprised me.
---
You decide what you're interested in?
---
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
---
- But you only get one.
---
Do you ever get bored
---
doing the same job every day?
---
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
---
You grab that stick, and you just
---
move it around, and you stir it around.
---
You get yourself into a rhythm.
---
It's a beautiful thing.
---
You know, Dad,
---
the more I think about it,
---
maybe the honey field
---
just isn't right for me.
---
You were thinking of what,
---
making balloon animals?
---
That's a bad job
---
for a guy with a stinger.
---
Janet, your son's not sure
---
he wants to go into honey!
---
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
---
- I'm not trying to be funny.
---
You're not funny! You're going
---
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
---
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
---
- No one's listening to me!
---
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
---
I could say anything right now.
---
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
---
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
---
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
---
Shave my antennae.
---
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
---
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
---
I'm so proud.
---
- We're starting work today!
---
- Today's the day.
---
Oome on! All the good jobs
---
will be gone.
---
Yeah, right.
---
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
---
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
---
- Is it still available?
---
- Hang on. Two left!
---
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
---
Step to the side.
---
- What'd you get?
---
- Picking crud out. Stellar!
---
Wow!
---
Oouple of newbies?
---
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
---
Make your choice.
---
- You want to go first?
---
- No, you go.
---
Oh, my. What's available?
---
Restroom attendant's open,
---
not for the reason you think.
---
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
---
- Sure, you're on.
---
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
---
Wax monkey's always open.
---
The Krelman opened up again.
---
What happened?
---
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
---
He's dead. Another dead one.
---
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
---
Dead from the neck up.
---
Dead from the neck down. That's life!
---
Oh, this is so hard!
---
Heating, cooling,
---
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,
---
humming, inspector number seven,
---
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,
---
mite wrangler. Barry, what
---
do you think I should... Barry?
---
Barry!
---
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
---
in quadrant nine...
---
What happened to you?
---
Where are you?
---
- I'm going out.
---
- Out? Out where?
---
- Out there.
---
- Oh, no!
---
I have to, before I go
---
to work for the rest of my life.
---
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
---
Another call coming in.
---
If anyone's feeling brave,
---
there's a Korean deli on 83rd
---
that gets their roses today.
---
Hey, guys.
---
- Look at that.
---
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
---
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
---
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
---
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
---
Sign here, here. Just initial that.
---
- Thank you.
---
- OK.
---
You got a rain advisory today,
---
and as you all know,
---
bees cannot fly in rain.
---
So be careful. As always,
---
watch your brooms,
---
hockey sticks, dogs,
---
birds, bears and bats.
---
Also, I got a couple of reports
---
of root beer being poured on us.
---
Murphy's in a home because of it,
---
babbling like a cicada!
---
- That's awful.
---
- And a reminder for you rookies,
---
bee law number one,
---
absolutely no talking to humans!
---
All right, launch positions!
---
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
---
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
---
Black and yellow!
---
Hello!
---
You ready for this, hot shot?
---
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
---
Wind, check.
---
- Antennae, check.
---
- Nectar pack, check.
---
- Wings, check.
---
- Stinger, check.
---
Scared out of my shorts, check.
---
OK, ladies,
---
let's move it out!
---
Pound those petunias,
---
you striped stem-suckers!
---
All of you, drain those flowers!
---
Wow! I'm out!
---
I can't believe I'm out!
---
So blue.
---
I feel so fast and free!
---
Box kite!
---
Flowers!
---
This is Blue Leader.
---
We have roses visual.
---
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
---
Roses!
---
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
---
S
---
If you do totems NOED isnt a thing. Although I think survivors should know immediately their exposed so they have a chance to counter play before someone gets hit.
---
Im on my phone and didnt double check. Thanks ill change it now
---
You weren’t fallowing the survivor rules 
---
Survivor rule number 3264: when ever a survivor is hooked the killers supposed to go to the opposite side of the map and stay their till the survivor is rescued
---
*Aggresivly groans into empty Room*
---
I'd also consider an overwhelming pressense/ distressing build + any other addons that increase or cause debuffs in terror radius. Doctor is the character that can best utilize a giant terror radius. Someone suggested monitor and abuse and while it's a good perk it is not good on doctor. You want that terror radius to be big all the time.
---
With hillbilly, stay away from open areas of possible. On any map, stay away from the edges where the walls are, those are dead zones with nothing to help you live.
---
I can understand that, but sometimes people either don't have teachables or they're inexperienced with said killer.
---
True. But it would make for some pretty boring games when nobody uncloaks him. No need to be afraid if he’s not going to attack.
---
Funny enough, a lot of ppl are like killer challenges are harder than the survivor ones "of course", but I didnt struggle with the killer challenges that hard (besides cases like the EGC one, that made me sweat a lot and it came down to luck). The survivor ones are those that made me suffer the most, I havent even done a lot of the tome 3- ones yet. You know why? Because you have rivality to get it done. 
---
You could end up competing with 3 other ppl to get the same bullsht - for example hook saves - what results in saboing the game. Not to mention that kicking a few pallets/gens is easier done than repairing "a few".
---
“The legend of Dwight”  ^^
---
Glad that you noticed!
---
But its not fun to bully the Killer when you don´t have at least 3 "Get out of Trial free" Cards
---
I had a great time with the early ones.  
---
That's what they need to be.  Relatively simple stuff you can do while playing the game.  
---
The sacrifice 4 in a basement in 1 game needs to go away.  You basically have to play the game a certain way to get that. It's not fun. It's not challenging. It's just a grind for the sake of being a grind.
---
Betrayal is a very interesting sort of perk. Although would probably only see play in casual settings of course. I'll admit it took me a minute to wonder why you wanted to give bloodpoints to the obsession.
---
Combine with Rancor for the double cross
---
Honestly, the entire archive/rift thing is optional. You do not have to a single challenge if you don’t want to. If you feel burnt out from it, just take a break from going for one specific challenge. Switch roles or perks. Try to just have fun games. Even play a different game for a day or two and then come back to DbD. All these things will help. But in my opinion, the archives/rift are fun secondary challenges (a few of them could be tweaked, yes) that are a nice inclusion to the game.
---
Maybe you are just a bad killer? Addons shouldn’t mean you get a free win.
---
Welcome to hell
---
Either a Meg, Feng, or Nea
---
What is backflipping?
---
I got it first attempt soloqueue.
---
I ran Bond with a toolbox so I could get the easy gens with others.  For my other three perks I ran Quick &amp; Quiet, Iron Will and Head On and basically used it to quick vault lockers anytime killer came near so i could stay undetected and go right back to repairing the moment they left.  Worked like a charm.
---
Gotta love the "Imma sit still knowing ghoatface reveal mechanic is a bit shit and hope to god that I reveal him and then post it on reddit" post i see.
---
Good post, but I didnt pay much attention in chemistry class
---
I find this behaviour really interesting, killers are toxic to survivors by camping and start whining about toxicity when they get teabagged.
---
~Lisa Sherwood
---
There is literally a score indicator on the left saying “Killer Burn“.
---
So two survivors would be able to take care of the killer while the other two do all the gens?
---
Thanks I’ll try that .
---
But you forgot dark sense lol.
---
Gotta love the one condescending guy in every post.
---
What the heck :D
---
Don’t know why bother giving brain dead survivors attention
---
I once had a Freddy do that to me, but I had a skeleton key....
---
This community as a whole has a serious issue with deeming things they find unfun toxic. Its an issue almost entirely exclusive to this fanbase, in my experience.
---
La daaaa la tat tataaaaaaa
---
O realm of eternity
---
Sacrificed to the entity!
---
Sounds like a big *freddy stun noise*
---
What's the difference of dcing than dying on the hook, both hurt my teammates regardless.
---
Gens clearly weren't done
---
Lol that's why I didn't get the challenge....nah I'm playing just had a stupid brain fart.  You're right I ran the same build minus Head On.  Dark Sense, Bond, Iron Will, Quick &amp; Quiet.  I love running Head On with Q&amp;Q so much it became a reflex to type that.  I remember now since I only used it for instant immersion on gen repairs with locker vaults I didn't care about having an exhaustion perk period that one game since my only goal was to repair and not be chased like I normally set a loadout for.
---
But their could be “That Guy” who might not get it
---
You just get shit for choosing to heal yourself with self care instead of doing a gen and heal reading your teammates since it’s faster
---
Wtf is the origin of this meme? I’d look it up but don’t know what it’s called.
---
Woah, that’s cool!
---
He wasn’t being toxic he was being smart you shouldn’t leave a hook when 3 survivors are near it’s just plain idiotic.
---
I think that just goes to show how good his teammate also is lol
---
I play killer and survivor equally..I tested it out and its blatantly obvious. I know what I am talking about. It is night and day difference. A def advantage.
---
I constantly get downs in his power and almost always have it built up so i know that’s not the case, and I never thought addons should give a free win, but if you play a fair killer and dont tunnel and shit like that, like I do, then you’re gunna have a hard time winning, I know how to gen patrol, i know when to leave survivors. that map was the game too, not that good for oni but I still killed everyone.
---
That was not my point at all. My point was that to find a key that actually opens the hatch you have to be incredibly lucky. In that aspect the survivor escapes without planning on escaping with a key. Keys exist. They're not fair, but they do. If you find one and you have the chance to use it, would you just drop the key and wait for imminent death? I never said keys or moris were fair, just that having the luck of finding a key and actually being able to escape using it is "more fair" (I use that term very loosely here).
---
Just because a killer got a 3k, doesn't mean he automatically deserves a 4k. Just as survivors don't deserve an escape because all gens are done, but they failed to open the exit gate before they got caught and died.
---
Yes, players can see the secret offering after the match has already basically started. Killers can see keys as soon as they are brought into the lobby, which gives them a chance to dodge the lobby. Survivors can DC while loading after seeing a hidden offering (which could as easily be a yellow mori, a green mori or a shroud of separation) fucking everybody over in the process. So a Mori is just unfair in general in the wrong hands (meaning killers that stay close to the hook, just so they can immediately down and mori a survivor)
---
They should just completely rework both keys and moris at this point, but I think the thing holding them back is the trophies that are tied to them. I despise using either, but they are still in the game, so there's no rules preventing them from being used, no matter how shitty or unfair it is to your opponent.
---
How do you use it? I've never been able to make quick and quiet really work for me... my scratch marks are clearly through the window. Then combining it with dance with me is 3 perks for the 1 gimmick which does not feel super great.
---
I've seen it go both ways. and even if a perk someone else uses bothers you, you just have to let it go. it's in the game for a reason, if people choose to use it that's their decision and no one elses
---
Did you even read what i wrote?
---
Killer has to stay there to make sure you die, so they won't be after your team.
---
The stupid game was replying to that message and everyone calling you stupid was the prize.
---
Love the killer, perks and the backstory! You should try making a vampire killer next
---
Wraith is really good but not number 1 may be the top 5 or 6
---
Unusable
---
Overpowered
---
Pick one
---
A lot of this seems unnecessary.. Yes, while he does need some definite changes I don’t think the stun is much of a problem and half of these changes that you wrote are phrased weirdly. Like, he can only vault windows in frenzy? That sounds a bit dumb to me.
---
No duh that's why I was agreeing that the current AFK detection is terrible.
---
Its just both comments had same typo, not understanding why the downvotes
---
I was just joking about it
---
watch your step is pretty bad and a cool down on the power would help eliminate exit gate camping otherwise it’s pretty good imo
---
That depends. If you know totem spots or have a perk to find totems then yeah, I'd say so.
---
Thank you !
---
Killer closing the hatch gets priority over a survivor jumping in. Just FYI
---
I want a shiny Umbreon. :(
---
I like ayrun but his thumbnails are OP
---
Ah,I see you are a man of culture as well
---
Where in that text does it say that he can only vault windows?
---
When a survivor is downed while facing away from the killer, they faceplant. And when they get downed while facing the killer, they kinda flip backwards. It's hilarious.
---
Even better: we’ll go to China and use Alex’s toolbox to bring down the government’s servers. And then DC so that they can’t get blood points off us
---
I'd suggest Distressing  and Monitor and Abuse over Monstrous Shrine and Unrelenting
---
Awwww how cute you think I was so aggresive you have to state it twice. If you think I've been aggresive then real life is gonna hit you like a freight train 😂 And I see noone calling me stupid actually it's the other way around with me calling you an idiot
---
I liked it. It's okay. 
---
Not as the games, not as the books, but good. I wouldn't want to stir things up here though :)
---
That's not really my point. My point is that killers can see survivors bringing keys into the lobby, but survivors can't see that the killer is bringing a "secret offering" until the game has already started.
---
Seriously don’t play as meg
---
Nope its trash worse than sprint burst
---
Hold up, there is a belI I can press?
---
He makes his own thumbnails and he’s pretty self-aware that it’s stupid
---
You are a bit slow huh?
---
Respecting a pallet means that the killer doesnt swin or walk through a pallet because he is afraid of beeing stunned.
---
An experienced survivor will gain at least one extra loop just because the killer respected the pallet, so usually good killers dont respect it.
---
When you just walk/swing into a pallet 2 possibly things are going to happen, you get stunned and can remove the pallet entirely of the match or you get a hit. Respecting just makes you lose time, with a few exceptions where respecting is acceptable but for beginners dont be afraid to get stunned.
---
Most people I've encountered through xbox have actually been incredibly friendly, coming from overwatch which is the most toxic its surprisingly nice 🤔
---
Yet here we are.
---
Not exactly. Walking by the Auto Haven gas station, there's a line in the dirt where when you walk over it, it makes a ding sound. In real life they're used to let the shop keeper know someone's here. In DBD... it still serves the same purpose
---
This is the actual best one
---
I don’t think the game is allowed in China because there bans of death and other stuff
---
Honestly lithe and dance with me is enough, most of the time the killer knows you’re vaulting but you can leave the loop instead of continuing it
---
otz and scott are good, ussylis is pretty bad
---
I never give the hatch tbh. I play very fair as a killer so i expect to take my win if i can because i believe i deserved it and they had their chance to win
---
Takes him too long to get downs and he takes a while to reload unlike Freddy.
---
Wraith has a pink add on that makes his bell completely silent. Use his red stain hiding add on with it and you'll be able to easily sneak up on survivors.
---
Let's settle the beef, hm? Let me take you out to dinner in my Veneno to wherever you choose (you pay). Then we can go back to my multi million dollar mansion, and go from there. I'll have a Caledonian Victorian bed waiting for us ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
It's also sometimes just the fact that the survivor hitbox is a fair bit larger than the visual hitbox, especially vertically. Some low objects have no tall hitbox, meaning you can throw something over and despite it looking like it completely missed, it still counts.
---
Clown was definitely feeling himself
---
Bubba: ALL WOMEN ARE QUEENS!
---
Billy: IF SHE BREATHES, SHE’S A THOT!
---
360ing isn't what you need to know in a chase. You need to know how to loop.
---
They're hairless?
---
*stabs cutely*
---
Dwight gets falsely accused of rape
---
That’s because hit boxes basically give me lithe when I go through a window!
---
Ah that sounds awesome sadly I’m not a wraith main haha he’s still lv1. Any chance wraith also has insidious? Or is it a teachable perk and if so through which killer?
---
You make all the best posts on this pageXD
---
As long as you don't eat the brains, people meat is perfectly fine :D
---
You basically just said "Being an asshole is acceptable because you can do it too." which is completely callous. The only reason you're defending it is probably because you enjoy being a dick to other people too.
---
That's fucking sick dude, I love that and now I want one
---
Toss a pebble to your killer
---
I think they're living by Valve's motto now.
---
Valve used to make games, now they make money. :)
---
Uh no I think I already established that you were the slow one but I get it you have no self awareness to recognize that
---
Because one actually helps end the cycle of them needing to keep using hated basement builds while dc'ing accomplished nothing on both ends
---
As a survivor main i think that's only fair. I don't want free hatch escapes every time. It's neat if it does happen once in a while though but i'm not expecting or requiring it.
---
Which survivor do you think is the tastiest?
---
I always found that cat breed cute for some reason.
---
This is basically just like saying 'no u.'
---
Oh stfu you're a fucking idiot noone wants you and noone believes you
---
Please Behaviour. Just do it.

LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL. Wow, that was a good laugh, that was so funny.
---
Wow that was rude. Now I'm sad.
---
If the survivors worked with the killer to make a perfect scenario for this, you wouldn't need any addons. Mend time is 12 seconds alone, 8 with a teammate. Base duration is 10 seconds. You hit the first person, they start mending. You hit the second person, and before you hit the third person the first person has finished mending. Then the second person finishes before you hit the fourth person. EZ Loop.
---
Yeah I know that is basically what you said. You don't realize you're the hypocrite and are actually  the slow one so you have to deflect by telling someone else they are bc you have nothing else to bring to the convo
---
Good be sad now stfu
---
Clown would be decent if some of his addons were base.
---
Alright. What do you want to talk about?
---
You're just playing hard to get.
---
r/Stabbygang 🔪
---
That’s funny cause I rarely see this killer being played at all so maybe a buff is needed.
---
And Killers differ from PC to Console if you didn’t know that.
---
Not everyone plays Oni but no one plays Legion who’s been in the game twice as long as Oni.
---
ngl yeah that sounds really good right about now
---
Today I was just playing killer when me a Rank 14, matchmaked against rank 5 and 4, I was able to get a 3K and one of the survivors I killed was valling me noob for being a rank 14 and for using NOED, wtf is wrong with this community
---
HEAD ON
---
Yup. The Clown is just a poor man’s Freddy. Which really sucks because The Clown has nothing else going for him. 
---
Freddy can even teleport to gens. Poor Clown man
---
The fact that clown moves slower when throwing bottles is ridiculous as it defeates the whole purpose of them.
---
It shows one of 2 locations as the toolbox on this map has 2 spawns and only shows in the egc
---
So apparently survivors have this thing where if they see X killer=DC. But why not Meg=DC?
---
Try soylent green instead, great substitute
---
true
---
Its a difficult challange for a reason, just cause you can not complete it does not mean you can complete it by staying in far side of map doing nothing. They dont deserve it. Op did nothing wrong, they reap what they sow.
---
That meme is kinda outdated now with the announcement of Half Life Alyx and likely more.
---
I love cut the engine. That’s disgusting. 
---
Swallow You Whole is a bit redundant with iron grasp. I think it would benefit more by say, pushing survivors who are body blocking. This makes it both unique and still synergies with the other carry perks.
---
I’m guessing iri head with infantry belt
---
I don’t think you understand, since there wouldn’t be a stun, I thought a bigger trade off would be needed to compensate for that.
---
And I’m talking about vaulting pallets, every killer can vault a window so I don’t know why you even considered that I meant windows anyway.
---
Salty lips...
---
The thing is lots of people started by getting the first tome done without much trouble, then progressed a bit into the rift and kept going, thinking it was fine and it would continue to be that way. But then things got crazier and crazier and, by the time they realized what really would take to finish it, they were already heavily invested in it and certain they could finish it, thus becoming extremely disappointed with everything. Not mentioning lots of us bought the rift pass right away expecting to get back their investment and worked really hard for it.
---
It's really upsetting when they feel they have to quit in the middle of their progress and not get what they thought they could get. So my point is this defeats the original purpose of the archive. It was meant to increase engagement, not frustration in a game already filled with rage-inducing mechanics and bugs. We should feel doing the challenges is fun and exciting, not a job. I'm happy for people who got it all done, but we have to understand for lots of us it made them feel like they're done with it and they don't wanna do it again.
---
Speaking for myself, I left a bunch of master challenges behind that would reward me with lore entries I'm really interested in, but I still got to the end of the archive and rift. And I don't feel like going back for those master challenges, even less so doing everything all over again for the next one. I'm really done with this thing.
---
You certainly raise some very solid arguments. I think Clown, Bubba and Legion should be next in the devs list of buffs/reworks.
---
We know the next killer to get changes will be the Doctor. I just hope they take a look at these 3 sometime in the future.
---
They get totally destroyed against good teams in the red ranks. I take my hat off to anyone who pick one of these up and manages to do well with them on the high ranks (without resorting to camping).
---
bUt iT mIGhT bE aBUSed!!!!!!

---
Window grabs count.
---
Injure someone and stick to their back until they vault a window or a pallet, and then just grab their ass. Remember to TAP the attack button, never lunge for it.
---
Same. I realize some killers are just trying to do dailies so unless it's Trapper I try to help them.
---
Never tbag or moonwalk or run in circles. Just standing at the threshold.
---
This one time back when I had recently bought the game, I was playing survivor. The killer was crushing us, and 2 survivors were dead. The other survivor made friends with the killer at some point, and so we ended up just doing gens (we were at 5 still). At about 2 gens left, I had to leave to go take care of something, so I just left my game running. I came back hours later and the screen showed I had escaped. The killer messaged me if everything was okay, and I thanked him after
---
Insidious is available on everyone through leveling but it's not very good for gen grabbing. I could see it working on a smaller killer like Hag though.
---
Quick tip you can grab injured survivors vaulting to get the challenge done as well.
---
In another game try running Bond, Reselience, Prove Thyself and Self Care
---
After you get hit/hooked once heal up to 99% and go around the map working on gens with other people. If the killer comes by, Self care to gain your health state back. Permanent 13% gen speed if I'm correct. Along with a Green toolbox with charges and an add-on of your choice. Bond should help you see what gens are being worked on, Just don't try doing gens all by yourself.
---
Endgame unhook took me foreverrrrrr
---
did not enjoy it at all " outside of the beginning because of the novelty" it become a chore many of the challenges made ppl play in stupid ways 
---
its optional sure ... but its supposed to be a incentive to play more,  not a reason to stop playing for weeks
---
wow. great job!
---
Best counter to NOED is not doing totems you find
---
It's not like NOED needs a counter cause it's not particularly strong to begin with. If the killer wants a free pity kill "on the house" from the match for losing, that's their choice to waste a perk slot.
---
Sucks for the survivor but there's a lot worse a killer can do than run that single perk.
---
2 words: 
---
#Dedicated Servers. /s
---
Why did they remove it?
---
Sorry I meant abusable.
---
What do you mean about his vault ability then? Can they still vault pallets or not? I’m honestly just confused by the way that you worded it.
---
This shit was even worse when EGC wasn't a thing.
---
I was having a bunch of unlucky and bad games trying to escape as Claudette for the Archives challenge, until one game when a friendly Legion helped me repair generators and escape :) Thanks stabby man.
---
Is there a name for the facial tick he has? My roommate has it too but I didn't wanna ask in case he's self conscious about it.
---
Leprechauns
---
What do you mean they??
---
He’s the only killer who can vault pallets.
---
Pretty sure because it was slightly longer than the other moris or just because it didn’t fit the game style, he would take a picture and start texting it then grab the knife from the survivors back
---
Hear me out.
---
Leprechauns, but Chinese.
---
But a digital camera fits the game so much better... Alright BHVR
---
I was meaning by this meme that we were getting so many free events and stuff and now in 2019 even nothing for christmas, only battle pass halloween stuff
---
I suppose that's true. But I'm fairly sure nobody asked for an under-cooked Heartstone clone or an Half-Life title... in effing VR.
---
Might just be me though. Valve is royally out of touch.
---
which is why enduring is such a good killer perk! u can eat pallet stuns all day long
---
Best thing is to hide in there with insidious and wait till someone comes in and dings.
---
It used to be MUCH bigger
---
Guess you never played Wraith? 
---
If you get Light burned you automatically get uncloaked, It's the same as getting as Pallet stunned. The fact that I'm getting away with abusing the Wraith with my Flashlight is a bug. It's the reason why the Wraith was running around Uncloaked AND can't Lunge but the game or the dedicated server thinks he's still in Spirit form. Forcing the killer to ring his bell again and again.
---
Yup, you can even see in the morí there’s no screen to view the picture so why does he even check that back of the camera
---
if it's multiple survivors and depending on which killer and if you let them heal, that's like an extra couple thousand BP for everyone. Nothing wrong with it, especially if it's the survivor standing at the exit waiting for you to hit them out, it's free points for both of you.
---
No reason to pout and cry about it like so many people on this reddit appear to do.
---
No way intentional.
---
Copy paste.
---

---
One gen needs to be done per living character including killer for hatch to open. So you’re wrong, one dead means only one gen can be left
---
&gt;Its a difficult challange for a reason, just cause you can not complete it does not mean you can complete it by staying in far side of map doing nothing.
---
I agree. They are assholes for this of course.
---
&gt;They dont deserve it. Op did nothing wrong, they reap what they sow.
---
I disagree. OP is still a scum for ratting out teammates.
---
Eat shit asshole
---
They as in Legion all together.
---
Also wouldn’t removing deep wounds basically remove the main idea of his power?
---
Oh im just pointing out people like you who do this have the mindset of "I STAND STILL AGAINTS A KILLER AND HE STILL HIT ME? OUTRAGE" like dude. If you want to reveal him atleast be behind a pallet. You aint the first one or the last one to complain about this.
---
Is that what hex totems look like in China?
---
Please BHVR, like at least address it. It's been 15 weeks jesus
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eh94wk/in_the_creation_of_this_meme_alone_legion_and_pig/

I really hope so.
---
Oh, that, my bad. I used to play wraith a lot, but now I almost exclusively play survivor, I don't think I've played wraith in dedicades servers, didn't realize that was the problem in the clip. Sorry, that must be really annoying I bet.
---
window hitboxes may be trash but getting exhausted but still downed because dead hard is broken is bullshit too
---
You're not the first one to point that out on this post. The post is about the revealing, not about my stupidity when it comes to making choices.
---
Hey at least we get ugly skins to waste $10 on :)
---
Yes, I was trying to spread awareness about this bug so BHVR can patch this after the holidays. This is just plain ridiculous since it has existed even before Cursed Legacy but I got treated like I don't know about light burn by everyone lol.
---
I honestly don't see the problem, then.
---
We we’re given free cosmetics all the exclusive ultra rares,  Christmas tree charm, Bill sweater, plague glowing blue eye body all this December and all free
---
Lol yes. I didnt even get to use it once as trapper during the endgame, *until* the one bum decides to tbag a bit too far away from the exit
---
I get that its broken, but I was a baby killer playing on my cousins stuff. I can only imagine the shock on his face as the words “exposed” and the hex appeared
---
Me because it's the killer i have fun with
---
Just as much of a careless unempathic murderer? Nice.
---
ahh gotcha, my mistake. I’ve never gotten it off nea’s web lol
---
Sure
---
You tell me. I hate when they are further then close range lunge but closer for a normal lunge but start zig zaggin left and right and autoaim fucks me up and makes my lunge short swing and miss
---
If you get downed by getting hit from the front or front-ish side, you will do a backflip. 
---
The killer at the exit gates tries to backflip you because it pushes you away from the finish line and lets him pick you up before you can crawl away to safety during his blood wiping animation.
---
That's a bad comparison for a number of reasons:
---
- Demo's portals have a cooldown (the post specified this killer would have none)
---
- Demo's portals can be broken (unspecified about this killer, though I'd assume not)
---
- Demo has to basically go through a loading screen after his channel (while opening the portal) to effectively teleport. This post doesn't specify any delay, just a 3s channel in the same vein as Freddy or Hag and you're instantly there.
---
Yo those perks are actually sick, I especially love Gross Negligence.
---
APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE FOREHEAD
---
When I first started playing the game and I had just gotten Ghostface, someone did that to me and I thanked them. It was my first time playing Ghostface and I had no idea on how to properly play him. The other survivors were toxic to me as well so they felt even more bad for me
---
I'm a new player on PC and queue time is easily 5-10 minutes for each game.
---
Now I'm hungry as well.
---
devs pls fix
---
Honestly this is very hard to answer.
---
I personally go completely insane sometimes and go for a revenge but wise thing to do is to let it be.
---
Eye for an eye only ends when the whole world is blind...

This wins
---
&gt;  an Half-Life title... in effing VR.
---
VR is the future.
---
&gt; Valve is royally out of touch.
---
The Valve index sold out in Canada and the United States, the 2 biggest source of sales for the product.
---
They are so in touch people are being asked to point on the doll where valve touched them.
---
Yeah exactly
---
I guess it makes sense because there would be less people reporting stuff as PC generally has an older playerbase
---
you loop that loop for 5 seconds and not waste the pallet AND you go to another loop safely. 
---
P r o f i t
---
Something something Clown's 15% 2 second slow slows him down by 15% for 2 seconds.
---
Speaking as a Clown main this is the biggest complaint that Clown mains have with him. You literally **can not** use his bottles to chase, and for a **chase** Killer (whose last name is literally "Chase" Jesus Christ!) this is pathetic. You can literally only use Clown's bottles to deny loops, and even then the slow is subpar at best and will at most deny one loop out of a pallet. And while cutting chase time down by 5% is nice and all I'd rather play a top tier Killer and cut chase time down by 50%.
---
I wish that [this video](https://youtu.be/4EYd5izzAsQ) had more traction because while it's rather loose form it sums up the issues with Clown rather perfectly. Clown can't chase with his bottles, he can't deny loops with his bottles, if a Survivor camps a pallet against him he's forced to eat it... To keep on topic about Clown versus Freddy the only asset Clown has over Freddy is that his bottles are ranged (a very slight boon on certain loops) and he has addons which are essentially mandatory to play him. (Flask of Bleach, Ether Vol%, Solvent Jug, Sulfuric Acid)
---
There are several other issues with Clown (extensive reload time, broken bottle hitboxes, broken hitbox for Clown himself [extended belly = extended pallet stun hitbox: citation needed], bad addons [Kerosene Can LUL]) but honestly if they removed the self slow when throwing a bottle Clown would be significantly better. Probably still mid tier at best but at least he'd be playable.
---
And added duration, can’t count how many times I was literally this close to hitting a surv only to have stomach cramps
---
I’ve never heard people call Claudettes cunts myself but thanks
---
Oh, this? It’s called “onigiri.” It’s a kind of food that’s easy to carry around. Not that there’s any point in eating food for a revenant. Although we may thirst for blood, we never grow hungry. ...Still, I think that makes eating all the more meaningful for us. We fight, we drink blood, we revive, we fight some more... Our lives are pretty much one endless loop. But every time you go around, you almost forget... that we were all human once. If I completely lost the memory of my human past, I wouldn’t be me anymore. I’d just be... something in the shape of me. I’d look like a revenant, but on the inside I’d be no different to the Lost. What’s the point of living like that?
---
I served in the army, back before I became a revenant. We always used to eat these things when we were out on missions. I guess... it helps me remember. It was a miserable time, but I made some good friends that I shouldn’t let myself forget. This stuff doesn’t really taste that great, but eating it always reminds me of those friends. So, I guess you could say it helps me stay me. It’s been an important companion in my life!
---
It does register if you get hit before crossing the finish line, which is what I do.
---
&gt;Im pretty sure im not the only one who hates losing and having that happen.
---
I get the sentiment, but the way I see it is that I'm not losing the match any more or less at that point and I might as well get some easy points if the opportunity presents itself. "Making the best out of it" kind of thing.
---
Why do you think he’s bad?
---
I’ll remember that when I’m getting four kills.

You are giving me really good tips but you have to admit there is some luck factor in this.
---
Oh, that's more understandable yeah.
---
well deep wound is 100% useless anyways, its been months since the last time I downed someone that way
---
Freddy's snares are a pure upgrade.
---
I've just had better success with babysitter. BT requires riskier unhooks and I'm not gonna wait for the killer to come around just to give the player endurance. Plus killers like Freddy or Demogorgon hard counter the perk now since they can remove their own terror radius and it never triggers as a result.
---
Steve figures out how to counter the killer by tackling him and never letting go
---
This is my first crosspost, hope tags and stuff work out, just was impressed by this.
---
I would switch out unrelenting and monstrous shrine for bitter murmur and distressing. The Doctor benefits from a large terror radius unlike other killers. Bitter murmur will help you determine which direction a survivor is going in once a generator is done.
---
"There's no getting out of this now. We're too good at it."
---
I play both killer and surv equally and have been maiming stabby gang since day one and I’m gonna tell you hex anarchy wouldn’t be super fun to verse, maybe it the 20 percent or 30 should be the max but not 40, otherwise solo queue survs are gonna be even more at a disadvantage than they are now
---
Edit: I’m a dyslexic idiot and read 40 instead of 30 forgive me, but still maybe only 20 should be max
---
Or they finally fixing hitboxes instead of saying it’s because of latency ^^
---
Spirit and Nurse were nerfed too
---
To bring a key you sacrifice bringing actual useful items to use the key ones in a blue moon. Moris sacrifice an offering..
---
Moris are way worse. And actual game breaking. Keys do not break the game
---
Iron Will is an awesome alternative to self care imo
---
If you get hit at the back and faceplant you land on the finish line and escape.
---
If you get backflipped you fall away from the finish line and the killer can pick you up, so getting backflipped can be a pretty big deal.
---
CORRECT GOOD SIR.
---
Ive been moried 9 times today
---
Being overly cheeky with the killer then proceeding to get absolutely wrecked  in late game are some of my favorite games, tbh. Maybe because I’m solo queue, so it’s very rare the majority of the team is gonna be up for memes, which makes moments like this stand out all the more
---
Like one game a few days ago with oni where we all threw the game running around and BT unhooking/kobeing with deliverance/pallet saving/upping slugged survivors right in his face for a good 2-3 minutes of total and absolute chaos on hawkins until we were all pretty much on death hook, somebody died, and oni started to properly snowball. True Scooby Doo feeling. The most fun I’ve had in a game in weeks.
---
I think if we’d gotten out after all that I’d’ve felt like we were just being straight up bullies, so dying after was preferable
---
I've always liked it. You don't get to use balanced landing every map but there are always vaults to be had and dead hard can be unreliable
---
Imagine trying to do a gen and that thing sprint bursts behind you and grabs you with four arms. Worst jumpscare in the game
---
They literally should’ve changed deep wounds so instead of it being in your terror radius it should’ve been your proximity to the killer. It would’ve functioned exactly the same but perks like Nemesis and Dark Devotion wouldn’t affect it
---
That could be because they're using Bloodwarden though.
---
That was kinda hilarious timing, nodding like an idiot and then gets kucked by his own trap. I was half expecting a DC at the end.
---
there is a difference between the spirit and nurse nerfs and the oni *NERFS*
---
Wrong subreddit
---
Oof downvoted for the truth.
---
No it’s not.
---
True, Legion got a far worse treatment but they still did get nerfed.
---
Legion needs the Freddy treatment where he gets multiple powers because Frenzy is either broken OP with how it can be used or just a faster M1. If you can down people with it while chasing them it’s too strong but at the state he’s in now it’s just a fancy M1. Giving him the ability to essentially teleport to lockers like how many people are saying in addition to frenzy would make him a lot better imo.
---
Yeah it does, it's pretty underrated. It used to be a lot worse when it only activated in chase, so there were times when it should've activated or needed to but just wouldn't because chase was stopped for 0.1 second. It's still niche because not every map has good options for it, and even on maps that do you can't use it everywhere. It's a lot like Balanced in that regard.
---
Personally I still think Dead Hard and Sprint Burst are better all-around options because you can use them effectively anywhere on any map, but they have different downsides, so really it's just about how you want to play.
---
They were literally staring at the point blank nodding
---
Finally some good fucking 𝑪𝑶𝑵𝑻𝑬𝑵𝑻
---
Yessss 😩🤤
---
They slammed it too early and I have no idea why they would stay there to get hit again lol.
---
 [u/VredditDownloader](https://www.reddit.com/u/VredditDownloader/)
---
lol I remember when I was like, "I'm bored, lets do something different and use Lithe." The following game I was getting chased by a trapper, I get hit by a bs lunge through the window and then with Lithe I sped up into a trap. Never touched the perk again.
---
Lithebestperkgang rise up! There are literally dozens of us! Dozens!
---
i mean ig, but they are still amazingly OP, at least nurse is
---
Only noobs use NOED
---
Don't forget that all these decisions to not do events and all were for "Game health and improvement" yet the games been the most buggiest it's ever been the last 3 months.
---
fuck you
---
Angry Lady screams at cat
---
It probably is from latency. The problem comes from hit registers being client side. If the killer has a less than optimal latency it’s going to feel like shit because you’re going to get hit when you shouldn’t. Hopefully we get some sort of massive rework of the entire engine sometime in the future.
---
Nurse is far from OP. Fatigue + Recharge hinders her and makes her extremely boring to play. She’s also lost her map pressure. 
---
There should be killers that are more powerful than other (but balanced) and I feel like Spirit and Nurse were good examples of them.
---
Nurse did not need a rework and I would be fine with them giving her a longer fatigue and nerfing the +blink addons.
---
Hey! You take that back right now; Wraith is best boi. :c
---
I see TTV survivor mains that I get against saying stuff like survivor is weak but then they get all the gens done fast without ruin and they say "the killer just can't pressure gens." Then when a killer has ruin they're all RUIN BAD NERF IT or if they have NOED this guy has no skill. 
---
Some of the Pig nerfs I can understand, but the Legion nerfs made him more boring to play against when I'm survivor. The Nurse nerfs were too much IMO. The multiple blinks addons and the ones for omega blink should've beeb changed because those made her cancer to play against. The Spirit nerf was fine. They should stop nerfing viable killers tho. The ones people don't play much have shit gen pressure.
---
*No-Mither + Self-care intensifies*
---
How did this happen? We're smarter than  this!
---
Ruin &amp; CI aren't a good combo; swap one of them out.
---
I think there are too many perks for gen protection....try Monitor and Abuse, Save the best for last or Nurse calling with sloppy butcher....
---
Glad this bug came back lmao, I like it a lot.
---
I know that. And we all know by now that revealing is stupid. But the way you show it nothing short of stupidity. You wouldnt stand still againts a ghostface unless there was a pallet between you.
---
But they're still red ranked killers, so /shrug
---
At least he's not smurfing and bullying baby killers.
---
No Mither, self care, Mettle of man, and Second Wind.
---
that is exactly what i meant by this meme ;D
---
your joking right? even after the nerfs nurse has 0 counters, you play a against a god nurse, no matter how good you are, you lose. 
---
Boring doesnt mean she isnt effective, she has her map pressure still, just without being able to TP to every gen instantly
---
Nurse just needed her addons reworked. Spirit needed changes though
---
M+A is great on Hag because of her already-reduced terror radius, definitely a good choice.
---
And Med-kit with syringe
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
It’s getting old to see people bitch about dedicated servers when they have nothing to do with the bugs being shown. Gameplay was much worse before. You had to dodge any match that had a killer with shit internet and you’d still have worse ping on average than you so in games now.
---
Yeah, no.
---
You’re telling me - that round was just not gonna end well from the beginning
---
You were the chosen one! You were meant to destroy the survivors, not basement camp with insidious!
---
Tbh I want to play Self-care and No Mither once as a David King just for fun
---
I had a guy not so long ago who wanted attention all game and then tbagged and clicked at the exit.
---
&gt;!But I had Blood Warden and STBFL ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) !&lt;
---
Clown is the worst killer in the game.
---
No shit
---
Note how you said “God Nurse” 
---
Yes, god nurses will kill you. However, there are still nurses that will absolutely get destroyed by survivors if they don’t know how to blink. 
---
As for counters, again you should try to lose LOS when she’s in fatigue. If you’re able to get away from her stealth is key.
---
Yes lithe is so nice
---
i think her rework could use some small changes, i think she should gain her blinks back while charging.
---
Her addons where broken yes, but they didnt gut her, and she is still amazingly OP, i dont really see why people complain about the changes since she still ignores everything in the game
---
haha ikr, its not like this is the 50000000000000000000th i see this meme
---
Couldn t handle the truth, couldn t you?
---
Who cares? You can’t hear them anyway, and they will play just as poorly or good as anyone else.
---
You need to chill.
---
Haven't tried that cause I don't have them all unlocked yet. Currently running Adrenaline, Dead Hard, DS, and Unbreakable. But I'll start working on unlocking that
---
That's not what y'all thought when Killers were struggling to complete the basement challenge. Seem to remember a lot of people mad at the 4th surv DC'ing to fuck the Killer over as well. How is this not the exact same situation?
---
All survivors have the same perks.
---
&gt; Yes, god nurses will kill you. However, there are still nurses that will absolutely get destroyed by survivors if they don’t know how to blink.
---
i would hope so. Do you actually think a killer who ignores every line of defense in the game should be able to be abused by people who have not mastered her?
---
If she was easier, she would get nerfed into the ground.
---
I also love whenever people tell me stealth is a counter, when good nurses dont run anything other then aura reading perks.
---
i never ate chili :(
---
I think you should always play and expect that the killer has NOED even if the killer may not have it you should always play as if they do and just do totems I mean you also get bloodpoints for it so what reason is there not too if you just rush through all the gens and get clapped by NOED you technically let it happen.
---
only difference is the nurse nerf did nothing tbh and the spirit nerf was tbh useless she can still stand still and it will be a mind game and I don't consider broken addons a nerf more like a needed balance but then u got the Oni who was made unfun as fuck bc why make his turning good on console when u could just make it bad for pc too seriously right. Not to mention legion oh poor poor legion
---
The tactic true uses, essentially requires either bone clapper or coxcombed so either they cant tell if you're on them or not, or there is no ding dong
---
I understand that it's on me dick. I came here asking for help not asking to be berated by some bitch ass toxic little asshole who thinks they're so cool cause they can hide behind some little screen and pretend their dick is finally bigger than the half inch you normally deal with. So either try to help, or get the fuck off my post with your toxic shit.
---
Lithe's two issues for me is that firstly I get bullshit window hits on both sides thanks to dedicated servers. The second thing is I'd really prefer getting the speed boost on the 2nd vault in a chase rather than instantly. By then the killer probably has bloodlust and it'd be super useful.
---
That twerk/belly dance combination
---
solo player, so just found it funny when i stumbled upon this
---
Maybe add a “cleanse” feature that survivors can cleanse statues and the statues get randomly relocated somewhere on the map and the survivor is exposed for 15-30 seconds or less this would fix exit gate camping.
---
You don't seem to "know that" because you're still talking about how I shouldn't have tried to reveal him because I wasn't behind a pallet when I just said the post isn't about me being near a pallet or not.
---
Kinda like spirit lol
---
I use what the fuck I want to use
---
Mad Grit: *silence*
---
New player: fucking hacker
---
Definitely not. I'm sure the devs have that ability, but no, it is not available.
---
Awesome, would be cool to download a custom skin pack to make your skeletons look like trapper
---
Ya know it would have cost you 0 bloodpoints not to post this
---
Thanks.
---
And if you play against god *insert any killer name here* you are dead no matter how good are you. Too bad there are no players in dbd who make 0 mistakes, which would make them god players, thus your argument is irrelevant
---
None of that matters though because demo would get there before the exit gate opened and so would this guy
---
if u respect pallets too often u give survivors more time to loop meaning u waste more time the early game is where survivors and killers can gauge each other and find out "does he respect pallets?" or for killers "will they throw at respect or keep going?"
---
usually in the early game is where u feel out survivors and see if u can respect some pallets or not just gotta be unpredictable
---
Mega are notorious for sandbagging. I don't trust them near me in closed off spaces.
---
i think that would he an interesting change. keep frenzy(maybe get rid of deep wounds) and add in the teleporting to lockers thing. i just worry that maybe itd be boring having another teleporting killer
---
Might be one of the worst offenders yet.
---
Hook vaccums
---
What aura perks do you see Nurses use?
---
&gt;Saboteur: saboteur should have an extended duration of the hook being sabotaged than the regular toolbox sabo.
---
how long are u thinking? bc idk if u know but before breaking hooks was rly OP like they would be broken forever and later they used to be broken for like 5 or 2 min idk so just saying there is a reason sabo isn't amazing anymore
---
*ps i am probably wrong about the numbers*
---
I keep hearing this. What about Legion is less fun than being one-shotted, or constantly screaming and hallucinating, or being hit when you're nowhere near the killer, or being jump-scared by a 0 TR killer?
---
Infinite mending Legion was hot garbage and should never been allowed, but what's unfun about a killer whose power amounts to parkour and a worse BBQ and Chili?
---
no and idk why u would want too it was stupidly fucking unbalanced
---
Healing is a priority if you are going against a stealth killer
---
Killers don't usually expect survivors to stick around finished gens and just move on to the next one.
---
Yea I think deep wounds has got to go, just make it so legion’s frenzy hits can’t down you and if you stab a survivor again it won’t give him stomach cramps. Also I think Frank’s mixtape needs a rework too, and so do most of the other add ons since the killer instinct detection range ones are kind of more detrimental because it can make it seem like they’re closer than they actually are and makes you waste your power. Pls BHVR I want my speed add ons back
---
well that all depends on what kind of survivors ur playing against that is just something u have to learn
---
I think your points are solid, but depending on how a hypothetical "disguise killer" is implemented I'd think comms would straight up delete that killers power, whereas every other killer is just strongly nerfed.
---
"Is anyone walking towards me rn? No? K killers on me, disguised as Nea"
---
Against comms, Trapper can still potentially place traps when no one is looking, a disguise killer just loses every interaction.
---
Well in general. What do you usually see them do if you have the perk?
---
Sub is full of shit memes.
---
They’re saboed for the same amount of time as trapper’s traps, that being 2 minutes I believe but maybe bringing it up to 5 or 4 would make it more useful. And yes I know that before hooks would be broken forever, I’ve heard many tales of my friends bullying killers by reducing hooks to almost none on the map
---
Best used on high mobility killers so that there isn't really an opportunity to hide, or you need to do it immediately, risk leaving scratch marks, etc. Examples:hillbilly, demo, Freddy, etc. Yes people will hide, but 60 seconds not doing gens is a long time.
---
usually they heal the unhooked person sometimes they hide close by other times they just run around
---
Certainly.
---
Well you definitely can’t read, OF COURSE I SWEATED :D
---
And do you even know what kind of build they were running? They were optimal &amp; really good swf who don’t have to rely on meta crutch perks. Their perks are for really fast gen speed + hope for endgame.
---
Like a headless chicken? Aight. Do they dont do gens during that time?
---
even 5 min is kinda strong I like trapper and 5 min without any traps or limited traps would be a pain 2 min is already a pain for hooks like hook breaking squad is already a broken build adding 5 min ur not gonna win even more now.
---
Sabo in general sounds like a perk u cant balance that easily but ig that is the whole game in general
---
When you've had morons taking down every pallet for the tome missions and just in general pallet looping ain't an option by the time I get found.  I can window loop if I can find a good one in time but I usually don't get found until the 3rd or 4th gen is done and   I usually have lithe or balanced landing with my set, usually lithe because it pairs really well with spine chill but again, gens are priority and when you're in red ranks and someone is dcing once every 1-2 rounds because "sPiRit/oNi oP" or they got salty they got downed first I'd rather gen rush myself or with another surv.  Me running the killer around isn't gonna get us out because killer usually breaks off, if I do get caught I get tunneled down and camped.
---
no usually if they know it is MYC they already are daring enough to loop me and usually i like playing trapper so a good looper can be a pain
---
Ninja will NEVER be as pure or cool as Joji. I am offended at this rotten attempt at comedy.
---
Aight
---
Don’t know what you’re on about. Nurse is very hard to play as and without addons it’s even rougher. 
---
Also, those are all rank 1 players so they will be efficient on gens. Tell me what killer doesn’t have to sweat going against a 4man SWF?
---
Shouldnt be a problem on spirit i guess.
---
D'awwwwww &lt;3
---
Well the BBQ meat is probably salted and made of survivors, so technically you're not wrong.
---
I started running plunderer's on Kate for the archives for 12 chests and was able to find purple and red keys three matches in a row. :O it was a nice christmas gift for my team and in the 2nd match, we actually clutched and ended up using both keys!
---
Good! Those flying rat snitches finally got their stitches!
---
On every map? Including the original ones?
---
Thank you! Pig is my main, I have a lot of fun with her.
---
i remember i had someone tell me if they made no mither give off 0 injured sounds it would be OP.
---
I think it should give a BP boost and have you lose exhaustion while running
---
I’ll admit I did the exact same thing and forgot dark sense
---
Because default meg = easy win
---
honestly if i've gotten 2 kills already i usually just let these people live because they don't deserve to be punished for being good
---
Just making a meme damn
---
Im all ears, BBQ, Bitter murmur, whispers (not really an aura perk but its similar)  ect
---
Foul and disgusting.
---
Although our Lord and savior does deserve our devotion
---
I know I’m a trapper main after legion and when my traps are saboed I cry in my sleep so i don’t think it should grant you the power of saboing traps, actually traps shouldn’t be saboed in general imo cuz a strong survivor team can reduce trapper to no power. 
---
That’s why I’m not a balancing dev lol, I think that maybe about 3 mins should be a good amount of time for a saboed hook. And maybe you can only have a certain amount of hooks saboed at once, so you can only sabo 2 hooks until they come back, then you can sabo again. That should balance it out a bit more so a sabo squad can’t sabo every single hook in the game.
---
How many gray tank tops does he have
---
It needs a humongous buff.
---
Shit you just reminded me of something I forgot to post
---
I’ve been able to get matches, but it does take a bit longer, and I was being kicked out of the queues for “unknown errors” occasionally but the game was still playable. I just pulled up a twitch page on my second monitor while I waited for a lobby and it was fine.
---
The dedicated servers were going down hill during the holiday season, so hopefully the devs are taking this time between now and the new year to fix some bugs and in the process it’s being difficult.
---
no actually, a god huntress vs a god swf is even game.
---
you are missing the fact that nurse has no counters, you have no defense. You can play against a god billy, huntress, oni, whatever, but you cant play against a god nurse.
---
I dont get it
---
Devour hope, Rancor or getting mori's in the bloodweb
---
Rank 1
---
Freddy's is more rank specific. Anything above Purple and Dream Pallets literally say "Hit tea-bagging survivors for free" because people don't try to loop you, they just try to stun you or for some reason let you come up to them then drop it. As soon as you come against survivors who actually know how to loop, it instantly reverses to Snares being the thing that gives free hits.
---
More stuff like the Speed Limiter on Billy/Bubba or Padded Jaws for Trapper would be fantastic if they offered something in exchange, like Pig does.
---
No Mither: Seems like a fine idea, but No mither is not suppose to be a "viable" perk, it is suppose to be hard mode, so they probably won't change it
---
Distortion: Reasonable idea, personally I would just want them to add the effect "when ever your aura is revealed to the killer it will disappear 1 second sooner", so the perk would still have an effect after you have no tokens.
---
Aftercare: All aura perks, Bond Empathy and Aftercare are more personal preference in which one you use, and I think buffing Aftercare would make the others a lot weaker. I would say if you want the effect to spread just use Empathy or Bond.
---
Breakdown: I think breakdown is fine as it is, but your idea doesn't seem to crazy.
---
Saboteur: I don't think sabo should be a viable strat, it should just me like you said yourself a meme.
---
Predator: I really like this, the problem is Spirit, it would be so busted on her.
---
We're Gonna Live Forever: I don't think WGLF should be changed, yes the killer version is a lot better (BBQ). but BBQ was originally a anti-camp perk for killers. When LF came out WGLF was better than BBQ cause BBQ only gave you 100% extra BP for scoring events when someone was on a hook, and back then WGLF gave you up to 200% bonus BP (50% per stack). I don't think just cause BBQ is good WGLF should be good is a good argument, but if you're gonna do something with it I would just say combine it with We'll make it and maybe change the numbers a bit so we don't get another insta include perk.
---
Yes, because everyone visits this sub.
---
I spent a good 15 seconds ringing it as trapper last game
---
I disagree with it being OP because you’re actively putting yourself at risk with the obviously S tier perk(/s with the S tier part). It shouldn’t require another perk slot to just make it useable since you pretty much can’t run no mither unless you run iron will and dead hard, I don’t think you’ve got people actually saying that No Mither is actually OP seriously even with iron will. But making it recover exhaustion while running is actually a great idea.
---
What if it wasn't a Nea,but a baby Dweet?
---
Dedicated servers still have lots of issues so now rather than dodging you just spin a wheel and get a random connection. So it really hasn’t changed anything
---
That is a very niche scenario that doesn't warrant  reworking a perk.
---
Well, that's DBD for you. Also after you've been in queue for X amount of time I believe it will just put you in a queue with everyone, regardless of rank.
---
It looks like a film camera so I wonder if he does it to make sure it took the picture lol
---
Never apologise for using noed
---
Ah I see, if Rank 5's play how they did I don't really see the problem with that lol. What is normal queue time?
---
Baby dweets can’t loop you for the entire game tho
---
Lithe, Dance With Me and Quick and Quiet plus a rotating 4th perk is one of my favorite builds. Now you see me AND NOW YOU DON'T
---
IDK, I mostly play killer but the queues have been very long for quite some time now.
---
For..... fun?
---
It has changed a ton. I have issues with like maybe 10% as much as I used to.
---
What does this have to do with the sub?
---
Normal/Baby Clauds and Dwights do such stuff aswell
---
Somehow i find pigs to be the rudest Killers a lot of the time (not counting Spirits or hillbillis)
---
Discordance
---
Though I run Stridor on Spirit as only perk and it is enough to have 95% of games as 4k at rank 1
---
I play nurse as well. 4 man SWF is objectively the strongest thing in the game, not nurse.
---
The guy had no addons and juking a no addon nurse isn’t hard dude.
---
For killer perks here's one idea I have
---
Surge
---
It's current Effect is that when you down a survivor all generators near you are damaged.
---
It's new Effect should be that Every time you damage a survivor it's Effect triggers and this Effect can synergies with surveillance.
---
Are you sure? Wouldn't somebody out there have to have an old version downloaded, and maybe they stopped playing, never updated the game, and they now have the files that they could share?
---
The fuck how is that possible
---
I've always thought the opposite - Pig's are the kindest killers. Guess I was wrong.
---
Toxic Nea, Grandpa, No Mither+ self care guy and Dweet. Perfect team
---
I've started dbd on pc recently, killer queue is about 15 minutes for me at level 15.
---
Freddy's Snares are everything Clown's Vials wish they were. 
---
I get that he's all about shutting down loops and predicting vaults, but *I hate it*, he's so god damn slow while throwing, I can't quite get the hang of his projectiles and he does *nothing* else. 
---
With Huntress, I predict and nail a throw, I get a free hit on someone out of range. With Clown, I predict and nail a throw, I get to make up the distance I lost *aiming the throw.*
---
TWO snoops to boop? I don't know if I could handle it.
---
Can’t loop. Vaulting doesn’t matter. And he hits one person and knows where everyone is no matter where you are.
---

---
&gt;Horvath - There are some instances where a lobby will no longer... I'm gonna try to be vague about this, I'm sorry. There are some situations where a lobby will get the incorrect rank for the killer. We are looking into this. But that ends up having a result on the killer you're gonna have. So the killer might be rank 20 playing against rank 1s and there is a bug in our system that just didn't match up correctly. We are looking into this. We are not gonna have it fixed before Christmas. Some time next year... Whenever. We are going to be able to get that done and it should be better. That's an issue with our system at the moment and not an actual desired design.
---
&gt;Horvath - High-ranked killers can also be matched against low-ranked survivors because of how the SWF matchmaking system currently works, which is also something that the design team are looking into and may or may not get changed.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eha13z/art_that_reminded_me_of_the_spirit/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Yea I disagree with not having no grunts of pain with No Mither since if you were to ask me it is still hard mode in chases when you’ve only got one hit but it’s a bit bs that with the person it comes with you are basically constantly giving away your location. Maybe giving it 75% iron will or 80% would make it more useable if 100% is too much for you but I still think only 50% isn’t enough when your survivor is making sounds that put a soldier shot in the middle of combat to shame
---
Ye, this was a longgggg time ago but it still makes me laugh.
---
It def needs a BP boost of some sorts.
---
And i would love for WGLF to become meta so survivors can actually get BP
---
I use it with Sprint burst so not running is goals
---
That’s probably what there going to do
---
Can I showcase this on my steam profile?
---
LOL
---
What in the fuck was that?
---
I know bhvr doesn’t want ai or whatever, but I think a semi fair rework would be how the legion is introduced in the trailer, as a “survivor”. If they could somehow, make some dumb survivor ai disguised as survivors in the match that would do gens without making progress, so if u hop on a gen with one, you would know they’re a legion clone, might give u a notification as legion if someone is on a gen with a clone. You can switch between these clones with a cool down, and there’d be an animation of the clone putting on a legion mask and then u become him. No more feral frenzy, and addons would affect power recovery or gain undetectable when switching or something.
---
*no*
---
Yea I think that it shouldn’t just be a waste of a perk slot imo, it should at least give an extra affect of anti tunnel so the killer can’t track the survivor off the hook. I also think it fits with the theme of the perk, that being that everyone will make it out okay, having it so that your friend can’t easily be tracked by the killer when they’re most vulnerable would be kinda neat combined with perks like Babysitter and Borrowed for the ultra “get off my teammates” build
---
Edit: I’m talking about WGLF if it wasn’t clear not no Mither lol
---
At rank 13 I'm getting red rank survivors. Yeah, it's that bad.
---
fair enough
---
Yes, but the game would never let you past the loading screen, you need to connect to the servers to boot the game. You'd never be able to play it any capacity
---
Not if Toxic Nea is named ,,Baby Dweet"
---
I'll add
---
Surge: Works on all downs
---
Mindbreaker: In effect for 100% of gen progress and 10 second exhaustion
---
Buckle Up: Increase distance from 48 to 128 meters
---
Fixated: Works while injured
---
Small Game/Premonition: 23 degree cone for more precision
---
Furtive Chase: Tokens don't disappear upon obsession death
---
Monstrous Shrine: Basement hooks/sacrifices are worth double points
---
Spies From The Shadows: You don't disturb crows
---
Unrelenting: Works on attacks that hit the environment
---
Hit me with thqt link as well please.
---
Never. Wraith is doo doo
---
Dont ever talk to me or my shit memes again
---
Yeah, definitely a must have... I probably never played without MA
---
the funny part that is 3 players meaning it has to be a KYF game meaning someone here knows how to do the glitch
---
Correct
---
I'd agree with the people here.. if you are underskilled just leave, as a rank 1 I always go back be Aude I'm very confident in outplaying the killer in most situations.
---
*Jazz music stops*
---
Let's just agree to disagree. :)
---
If you're playing to win, taking notes of totem locations and simply rushing gens is always going to be the best choice
---
Best case scenario; gates are open with less pallets + hook states used up.
---
Worst case scenario; you have to check on the totems you saw and cleanse NOED. Or you were in chase, got unlucky, and die. Not really a big deal
---
This.
---
It will be the same thing as if you gain a speed boost after dropping a pallet, pallet is already a safe spot so you dont really need the speed boost
---
They're an M1 killer once you're injured. You can absolutely loop them. And they don't "know where everyone is" he gets a single use of Infectious Fright unless they brought an Ultra Rare addon, and then they have to all be close enough to reach without just getting stunned for running out of power, and *then* if they managed to hit everyone...They're an M1 killer who has a massive stun before they can start a chase.
---
Just seems weird that most people hate playing against someone who becomes powerless as soon as you're injured, but don't have that problem with people who can one shot you or do similar things like Oni/Plague
---
You can’t fuck up all day against a SWF who are optimal on gens because they will do all gens in 5 minutes. Have you never played against a non brain dead team? 
---
I do believe that nurse is the strongest in the game but without addons, other killers with addons are stronger than base nurse.
---
Seriously, the game has been out for years. Not everyone is a noob. Survivors know how to rush gens and a proper genrush will beat a nurse more often than not.
---
I know the glitch wasn't patched even if BHVR tried I only knew the old way to do it unless they way hasn't changed
---
I did all of tome 1-3 but tome 4 broke me, I don't have the energy to sit there and the dark sense challenge or the 4 basement one. So yeah, DBD got me back in and enthusiastic about the game all the way up to tome 4. And i get that the challenges are supposed to be harder but it shouldn't be soul killing
---
What were you doing mate lol
---
A perkless addonless Pink bitch suffices to take him down
---
Haha yeah. He literally talks down on slugging unless it's against the last 2 survivors and he doesn't want them to find hatch.
---
Also as a killer if ur doing that bullshit 4 gen in one match, I’ll help you
---
Its ok noob perks exist for a reason, so noobs can use
---
Oh then he’s just a bot nvm then. I thought he hooked you right there
---
I dont even like BBQ or chilli and it sounds scrumptious!
---
I could be this pink bitch but wrong perks
---
Ooh I forgot premonition existed, just make it work like spine chill and it’ll be a good stealth perk.
---
 Buckle Up should also have people recovery speed increased by 20% like how breakout works.
---
Furtive Chase should reduce your terror radius outside of chases imo and your idea of it not disappearing after the obsession dies is how it should be in game rn. 
---
Monstrous is one of the perks I think needs a full blown rework as well as small game.
---
Small game is a really funny perk because you know it’s been there since the beginning like saboteur because of the sheer fact it’s supposed to counter trapper, it’s honestly funny how many perks and items are used to just counter trapper
---
Spies from the shadows could also be buffed by having crows naturally gravitate towards survivors so if you see a bunch of crows just vibin on a rock near a gen you know that a survivor is near there
---
Other than that these are some really well thought out stuff
---
No they're not. To use a key, you have to be about to win anyway.
---
&gt; I'd still use it over Bug Hard and Bug On though.
---
The best perks of Bug by Daylight
---
Yeah Red's are really the only ones I'm actually worried about.
---
Yet its always shown all killers average more than 2 kills a game. Sigh..
---

---
Thanks for all the help.
---
What your ideal taxic build?
---
Ehh nurse is still fine imo, i think they made her a lot more harder to play yes but that’s how she should be, I think it’s better if she has to manage basically only having one blink immediately after blinking
---
He whines alottttt
---
I mean to be fair I don't think they ever said to balance more killers
---
I think i morid today 4 aces with nurse at rank 20 while hitting them on Hook
---
Why message them?
---
What are you possibly looking to achieve?
---
Why flex a "perfect" legion game... they're the easiest killers to get bloodpoints with in the game, every game is 32k as long as you use your power and 4k
---
I had one carry me to the hatch and drop me near. I crawled to the hatch and right before I got out, he closed it. Then he mori’d me.
---
Looks sick!!
---
Bing Bong Boi is a cool and fun guy! 
---
It's not all about killing people y'know. He's still a fun Killer for some of us.
---
Yes &amp; No.....Yes because it can help you create distance......No because you'll just waste it vaulting and waiting to begin a loop
---
Welcome to sprint burst by daylight.
---
She could have prepared it before being hooked
---
You can't just look at the wall. Dedicated servers broke it. Killers can be blinded by a survivor who is directly behind them from their perspective.
---
Please, mercy, mercy on our stabby gang. We just want to have the best fashion in the game, not to be guys and gals with unique M1 attacks, the things they did to the gang were human rights violations pretty much
---
It's not like we can change screen settings or anything
---
DBD team: Someone got a tattoo of a perk! nerf it!

She made that on wood with paint and the logo is white vinyl she had to meticulously cut out in her Cricut app, probably my fav thing I got this Christmas!
---
Is this the doctor rework we’ve been waiting for
---
They said it was for general balance, since balancing events took way too much effort that they wanted to direct towards balancing the base game. I just focused on the killer part to increase the meme factor.
---
Yes, when you're versing potatoes.
---
Can you message me how to do it
---
We’re you being crouched? I had that happen once. I was chasing bill, he stunned me with a pallet, and when I went to kick it I couldn’t. I was stuck. I couldn’t move, couldn’t kick, and all the survivors gathered around to taunt and teabag me. Turns out a survivor had crouched behind me, pinning me against the pallet. It was fucking hilarious.
---
Dedicated servers is a new thing. As long as there is a killer, survivors can connect. You could play KYF matches in it.
---
I like head on
---
People have been begging for Half-life VR.
---
That's strange,never heard about it,she has nothing to do with Entity as far as I know.Did your friend said anything more specific?

OK he's trolling lmao.....

Keys can throw games because they can be found mid-match, and it is an instant escape. Moris have the chance to not be used at all.

For some reason I saw the froth as rainbow colored and didn't see the text bubble and assumed he is a monster because he is gay
---
* Having an unintentional resemblance to gameplay elements from Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; ...).
---
I'm pretty sure it is, it's just not very common. I've only seen it a handful of times

Glad you enjoyed it

I love it

He is suggesting only people who frequent this subreddit know about booping snoots. I understand your frustration but you cant expect every wild piggy to enjoy you booping their precious snoot. It is a shame when you boop and they do not appreciate. However this is just the way of life. Sometimes you try to boop and it just wasnt meant to be.

Is that the build he complained about for the entire stream? "I would never play this build" "this is not my choice" "bad build"
---
like dude, get over it.
---
lmao i was just kidding
---
The shitposts are cool and all, but is there a way we can make something like this get more attention? These posts get enough upvotes that the community feels strongly enough about it.
---
The next time there's a Q and A, we need to try to get some kind of response from the development team. I don't know if that means enlisting the help of Fog Whisperers, or continuously writing well thought out posts on the official forums, but there's got to be something more we can do as a community.
---
what an absolutely cursed image i love it
---
I will sandbag and teabag the fortnite out of him and his 7 year old army
---
I think it's just the fact you have to send messages through Xbox/psn on console. On PC there's an after match chat where all the shit talking takes place. Less regulated there
---
her face makes her look like she’s given up and her toes....

I don’t anymore. I use Jake.

Same with any support for us deaf people, nothing they ignore it on twitter too even when its upvoted
---
Like I said, it would be a valid change to make, but No Mither is hard mode, and they even went out saying that they won't change it
---
Kind of new to the game what exactly does that perk do? Down by 1 hit?
---
Yea it’s a fat F for no Mither that we’ve got to run another perk to make it useable
---
Lupita realness
---
They censor everything and hope the people will believe the world is just flowers and unicorns? I don't get it.
---
In what world is a key an instant escape? You have to a) not die *and* b) not drop the key or use any other items *and* c) get the hatch to spawn (which means the survivor has already almost escaped) *and* d) find the hatch *and* e) show any other survivors where the hatch is before the killer shuts it. At most, a key can only ever deny one kill.
---
Unless the killer is a rank 20 scrub, the only mori that has a real chance of not getting used is the yellow mori.
---
Put on iron will as the 4th perk for the ultimate now you see me and now you don’t
---
I’ve come to accept that I probably won’t finish the rift, and I’m okay with that
---
I think it has the most build potential.  You can slap on Q&amp;Q, Dance With Me, Maybe even Windows of Opportunity and always make use of it. Lately I've been using Resilience and Spine Chill with Lithe, if you make it to a window before being hit, you get a huge speed boost. If you get hit first and are currently in chase, holy shit you vault windows and pallets so damn fast. I think the vaulting speed is borderline busted but not many people run those 2 together so not a lot of people know about it.
---
She doesn't have any joy but she knows she's dying pretty.
---
The only thing you can do, is play for fun rather than to win. The moment you stop caring about winning, you'll have a way better experience. I play for points and it's so much better. I play all my killers now and I dont care if they win, the game is tilted in the favor of swf teams so there isnt much you can do to stop it. Stop caring, itll be the best thing you ever did.
---
Nah, that's not a cool way to play him and much less fun than burger king myers
---
Fun?
---
Completes all the gens in 5 minutes and everyone escapes 7/10 matches? Weak killer
---
Gets sacrificed the other 3/10 matches? Killers too strong!
---
Today I played a game with Ghost face and when my spine chill went off I stopped working my gen and went behind a tree and kept looking in front of me (because I thought I was at the corner of the map) and when I finally turned around I saw GF crouching behind me and all of us played around for that match. Usually I hate going against GF but that one made me smile :)
---
Don’t give up
---
Really good killer idea, but betrayal seems a little strong, specifically with the aura revealing. And to make it more unique, you could make it so survivors can rotate or mabye push the statue (though pushing is a bit much.) But rotate so if you put it by a gen, they can counter it by rotating so you don't get the aura reveal from facing the gen, and don't have it give a notification, but the killer sees the statue aura and should be able to tell it's rotated. And his addons would be sick. I really think this is a good idea, unfortunately i don't know if the devs even look at things like this, which is a shame.
---
This shouldn't be funny... Why is this so fucking funny..
---
Sigh here we go again *upzips pants*
---
&gt; TTV survivor mains
---
I love the twitchies
---
One time someone dropped me and closed the hatch but I had adrenaline and a key so I yeeted out and he was so pissed.
---
I lobe his videos but the thumbnails make me cringe
---
don't look at her toes you weirdo
---
No, You can't. The game will tell whoever is outdated that you're not playing the same versions and not allow you to connect until you update. Source: It happens whenever a patch comes out and you're mid game.
---
"oh wow she's fast"
---
"wait what the fuck"
---
"WHAT A TWIST"
---
Don’t forget purple medkit with syringe
---
I respect some pallets and some not. I test it on the first pallet and change if he plays different than expected. Some people stay on their pallet and heavily want to stun you and these are the people who I try to trick with acting like I'm going around but then swing and do a 90/180 and maybe hit them. Sometimes I always run through it, sometimes I swing directly and sometimes I stop when I know he is panicking and I don't want to give him the additional escape time.
---
It's always on the playstyle of the Survivor
---
Yes, actually. I am.
---
Winning isn't everything. It doesn't matter who you play, even sweaty Spirits lose from time to time. 
---
IMO it's a waste of time to worry so much about winning in this game.
---
Ahh
---
You get a greater chance to get ultra rare addons by upgrading a killer to higher levels in the bloodweb.
---
Can someone tell me what I'm looking at?
---
They are not teammates anymore, they betrayed. They decided to fuck op for their challange. How I see it is that op told the killer where theses scums are hiding instead of ratting. Also please dont use teammates for such players, even bad teammates try their best to save each other.
---
There aren't that many people that are entitled enough to do that
---
I wish things like that would be more often, it's sometimes so cool to hear that
---
damn dude how long did this take
---
No One Escapes Death, aka NOED. As long as the totem is active, every survivor suffers from Expose status, so yes, one hit and you're down :)
---
The key is a free unpreventable escape for either the last person or three-fourths of a team if there is a tough triple-gen. It can be a get out of jail free card. Moris are hidden and are obvious before the match starts and can be dodged by DCing before the round. Keys can be found mid-match, moris can't, and keys can throw the match even if it was in the killer's favor.
---
Throw a coin to your Hag... I mean your Witcher!
---
Then why are you complaining? That is the point, is that they are small and similar to Survivors. It’s something people were asking for.
---
The hillbilly skin is pretty cool
---
She’s no use practicing at any rank higher than 10. Unless you’re a god, practically every match will be against some sweaty swf groups that are all rank 1s and who will shit all over a Huntress. It’s actually quite frustrating, I wish the devs would implement a more chilled mode with no survive with friends and completely random matchmaking. I don’t want to have to try hard everygame I play
---
i can't believe how hard this made me laugh
---
If you still think Legion is broken then I feel sorry for you. He's one of the funnest to go against.
---
Funny because I've never seen anyone explicitly state they want a new HL game in VR, just that they want something new related to the HL universe.
---
This isn't my HL, it might be yours, but it's certainly not mine.
---
* You're not playing as Gordon Freeman (Alyx isn't as iconic, you can't paint it any other way)
---
* It's in VR instead of a tradicional keyboard and mouse game
---
They had **what feels like a century** to make a brand new Half-Life, a direct sequel to HL2: Ep2 or even something fresh with Gordon as the playable protagonist. And yet the best they came up with was this crap to sell VR headsets. This is borderline disrespectful to the fans imo.
---
Valve is irrelevant as a game developer to me, period. I still thank them for the great games they made in the past and the Steam client (Steam is great, I'll have to give them that), but when it comes to games made in-house they're totally out of touch with their own community.
---
If you can't see this then you're a clear Valve fanboy. People need to stop drinking from the Valve kool aid, they're not what they used to be.
---
I don’t play killer now do I ;-;
---
can I get a link please
---
And it's a pity kill, it sucks when you are the one killed but noed is not a strong perk.
---
People who do this are not only assholes, but they're stupid too.  The more they DC the more killers will be running basement builds leading to more unfun games.
---
Nice meme, but the statement in the title is incorrect.
---
No living being or creature is a cute as Baby Yoda. That's just facts.
---
(Baby Dwight is cute in his own way though)
---
Cute ain't the word I would use personally. But to each their own.
---
Played a game as demo I think it mainly depends on gate placement for how powerful his gate camping potential is the amount of time it takes on a map like hawkins to travel from one gate to the other +base cooldown without addons is enough to almost get a gate open if not open it fully.
---
I'm trying to practice Huntress and I just played a game on the swamp and almost got a 4k, (unbreakable for the win!) And one of them told me I had good aim and everyone was super nice! Made me cry, I'm not going to lie.
---
I’ve just found out that this guy also did the legendary “Clown Cookin’” and “Palletstun.mp4”. Which just so happen to be two of the best things ever posted on this sub.
---
I don't recognize that desktop/OS. Is that a macbook?
---
Im just about to hit devotion 3 lol it takes sooo long
---
They should do specific animations for killers when they lose or win, like if legion didn’t manage to get enough kills, he would walk away with his head down, and the other legions would comfort him (depending on which one ur playing)
---
Stealth level: 100
---
New rank reset probably causing it, litterally impossible to depip unless you try so every survivor is gonna be stuck in red and purple ranks.
---
sure if u want to get banned
---
still a meme
---
DC'ing is just as bad as this. Some players suggested that disconnected player body should remain in trial which can be hooked. It is a good idea as it will also give hooked bp to killer. Now dcing is not making the challange hard, it is the loophole to prevent other from getting their challange done. What if in most survivor challange they need to escape the trial by hatch/exit gate and killer dc when he can not stop them from escaping.
---
ah yes I was flexing a killer that sucks in chases yet got max points for chasing
---
There are many factors that it doesn't take into account. Items/add ons, offerings, maps, pallets spawned etc. Statistics don't really determine anything if they don't take important factors into account, especially with dbd; an asymmetrical game full of RNG
---
I guess those scientists drank themselves to death? 😁
---
Its windows 10 but with a nexus dock and some Rainmeter skins
---
Of course its a ghostface.
---
Can these memes just stop? Why are we making them? Why not yell and scream at the devs to stop killing their game?
---
I don’t really care much for the challenges but I had to take a break until the rift closes or whatever. Its not fun when every killer I go against is tryna hook 4 survivors in the basement.
---
that is a weird way to spell Sussie
---
Oh... okay. Looks cool.
---
Also, nice clip. It's always wholesome when a team of random players manages to work together and escape. :)
---
I thought that was what frank's mask was
---
Gotta be
---
Or better yet, give him this cosmetic.
---
Balanced Landing is not an escape.
---
What level do you have to be to devote
---
Leading the Killer to your teammates so he'll hook them and ruin their challenge is exactly the same thing. People care when it affects Killers, but survivors just have to "git gud." This sub is so full of clear bias, it's hilarious.
---
A ring ding ding! Metting is in order.
---
What? I'm obviously saying both players should have the same client downloaded. I'm not suggesting somebody with v1.0.0 play with v3.4.2 lmao
---
&gt;One one hand most killers hate vaulting windows
---
*Laughs in Shape*
---
Thanks. 
---
And yeah, managing to escape like this is the best
---
i hope i don't get rape dreams because of this
---
Fuck the animation i want cosmetics dammit
---
the first perk is insanely broken and also pretty much a campy version of make your choice
---
And give it a passive ability where the entity doesn't block the windows no matter how many times you vault it. Oh and increase the speed boost to 5 seconds. Maybe make it so when you accidently vault onto the killer you drop kick them and it stuns them for 5 seconds. /s
---
Lvl 100
---
True and everyone on this sub wants to eat Myers meat... or so I've been told.
---
Another one of these for the 1000th time
---
I personally use lithe and it can be a bitch to use with how easy you get hit out of windows. However. It can be used in very very strategic places, and there are a lot more places for it to be used vs lets say balanced landing. No matter the map, there are windows and crap everywhere. Drop offs, not so much. Every map has em, but not many have ones in good places
---
I see
---
It is really one of the best ways to use the traps. If you can fuck up a vault in a safe building from a trap you can easily get a down for it.
---
This is the stupidest thing I've read in a very long time. Have you ever even played a match of Dead by Daylight? 
---
If you're so bad that keys bother you that much, run Franklin's Demise. It hard counters keys. Otherwise, you could just kill the survivor that has the key. Or you could just find the hatch first.
---
Unless the killer is really really really really braindead, 3/4 of a team is never getting out through hatch. Using a key is a death sentence for any survivor who doesn't get to the hatch before the killer does. If a survivor is looking for or being shown where the hatch is, they arent doing gens. If none of the survivors are doing gens, maybe, just maybe, you should be suspicious about the hatch and should go check on it. If the killer knows where the hatch is before its opened, a maximum of one survivor gets out. One survivor that was about to get out anyway.
---
10 days is pretty tuff, you have go play the whole day long, but it's possible. Whatever, I wouldn't try it.
---
Erm... okay, wtf?
---
I, /u/itsmauitime time, have a dream, that I know is just. Of Trapper starting with all his traps.
---
Banding together to make around 60% of the questions based around this would be an amazing way to get their attention. 
---
They keep nerfing pig and legion and they only reworked 3 of Legions add-ons not even bothering to touch the 3 useless purple add-ons. Now they are unfortunately saying "We aren't touching legion because hes capable of getting 4K's. Every killer is capable of that, even pre-rework Freddy.
---
Just oblige and hit them in the exit gate, they'll piss off and you can move on.
---
Nah, they gonna be greedy and your Bloodwarden activates, ggez :')

He's not broken, indeed the exact opposite. He sucks balls, and I say this as someone who loves Legion.
---
This is gonna sound nitpicky but when we're talking about a game that receives frequent adjustments and reworks like DBD, stats from eight months ago are a little fishy. Though, anecdotally speaking, as a lower-ranked player, I feel like it's always a 3-4k for me or nothing, so I'm inclined to agree.
---
but one is a cooler border
---
I mean Leatherface in the movies basically has the mind of a child and the main reason he kills is because 1. he's afraid of strangers and 2. his family abuses him if he doesn't.
---
Optimization too
---
Plaid flannel and it went from very rare to common**
---
ITS A GOD DAMN EXHAUSTION PERK AND THEY SAY NO ONE TALKS ABOUT LITHE
---
This raises awareness, so more people spam them at their Q&amp;A's.
---
I read everything in Elijah’s voice except for the ‘Addons’ part, which instead sounded like a very earrapey text-to-speech.
---
I dunno how the yourubers never ever miss a downed survivor. They zoom in right at them. I know it is good headset but wow, I am impressed a lot by rhem
---
Now hold up. Op himself is a survivor here, or consider any other survivor. They are also doing a challange themselve. Somehow they got down and there so called teammates decided not to save him because those so called teammates has a challange to complete. But what about the one who got down. Dont he have challanges to complete. They have a chance to complete the challange by saving their teammate but they decided not to. Now do they really deseve it. Its not about takin side of killer. We are taking of survivors. Right now I am taking the side of survivor. Its hilarious how you bringing the killer when we are taking of two type of survivors here.
---
if you didn't play toxic ofc you deserve the win
---
Its with insidious too. Blinking behind gates and insidious with NOED is hilarious
---
Ah, you mean how memes about toolboxes and keys raised their awareness?
---
He's gone up in killrate though
---
Freddys left hand is scary af
---
So who's going to tell him?
---
The challenges are for the lore and bonus progress through the "battle pass"

What about my sentence confused you?

When did they say they were fixing oni?
---
Hitboxes dont change on their own. And most of the time they're fine. Its latency
---
I think the devs are trying to get away from giving the notification about killer perks and moving in a direction of waiting until it is encountered. Such as not giving an unnerving presence notification until a small skillcheck is given. Besides, most high rank survivors will be able to figure out a killers build and if they can’t figure out 1 or 2 perks and the killer is playing like horseshit, then he probably has noed and/or blood warden. Maybe 10% I will get caught off guard by NOED. It’s pretty obvious most of the time imo.
---
The toolbox and Key memes.
---
There is no argument to a key being more fair than a mori. I play the game daily and I shouldn't have to bring a perk to counter an unfair mechanic. And the same thing could be said for a braindead killer not being able to utilize a mori. Both keys and moris have specific requirements, both are preventable but are cheap when used successfully. Keys are a wildcard that can ruin a game at any time. I am not saying moris aren't, moris are complete BS, but keys are just as bad if not worse. Even if they aren't doing gens and are looking for the hatch, it is much easier to find it and instantly escape by using the key.
---
Yup Freddys Snares thoroughly outclass Clowns bottles.  Devs literally forgot to give them a downside lol.  They're a bit too easy to use midchase you can just spam them at any loop mid chase and they're screwed.   Compare that to Clowns limited quantity, reload time AND slowdown.  Clown needs some love.
---
# MATH
---
I would rather do 80 gens for one event item than have to do 4 tomes of shit challenges
---
As a killer, I think it should reduce grunts 100% cuz I run bloodhound so u constantly bleeding is enough to not have to hear grunts
---
Why are they confusing?
---
rift challenges are just challenges that give u BP and shards for the battle pass
---
bp = bloodpoints
---
Because I don’t know what you’re talking about?
---
yeah, should've vaulted that window, going into a locker is possibly the worst thing you can do in this situation.
---
never said it was wrong, just that it's in the game for a reason
---
(Nea is killer/Nea is the entity) is a joke/meme.
---
To be fair, you hardly provided any information on what we were looking at. In that regard, it just looked like regular lightburn.
---
Yeah I’ve stopped watching his videos too lately because it’s just too much yelling. Also, seeing him say the F word on stream (the gay slur one) just finished it off for me. Fuck that guy.
---
literally nothing that's just a thing people do sometimes, I can't control it. but what I can do is make sure I can heal myself.
---
&gt;Funny because I've never seen anyone explicitly state they want a new HL game in VR, 
---
So you admit that you're grossly out of touch? You actively avoiding anything VR makes your perspective completely irrelevant. 
---
Ever since it was leaked that Valve was working on VR prototypes (what would originally become the OG Vive and Valve Index) people have been begging for 3 things: Half-Life VR, Portal VR, and Left 4 Dead VR. We know Portal VR was scrapped due to motion sickness issues, Left 4 Dead VR is rumored to still be in production, and the super hyped Half-Life VR became Half-Life: Alyx and has had exceptionally good early impressions. Valve has always used Half-life to push new technology. That what made previous Half-Life games innovative.
---
Cracking open a cold one with the boys
---
THE GRID
---
This one guy wouldnt stop bagging at the gates, so I just let him go.
---
He followed me. My NOED made sure he didnt get out.
---
If you're playing a killer who sucks at chases you get more chase points because you spend more time in chases 4head
---
people are scared of it
---
the hag is my new favorite killer main to use. always sorta flew under the radar for me, but i've been 4k-ing like a cannibal-crazed beast lately, and I love how her upper-level add-ons fundamentally change how her power works. still haven't fully mastered things like collision blocking yet, but it's been fun to learn.
---
also got to pay it forward a couple of times, playing with a sole survivor and just screwing around on the map, having fun, and waving as she escaped.
---
and I'm not gonna finish the rift, but I completely cleared page 1 of the archive, so that's somethin'.
---
Let me guess, terrible matchmaking so a rank 20?
---
That’s why I watch otz for analysis and review
---
You should google the definition of instant and get good.
---
One has multiple counters. The other does not.
---
imagine taking this as a flex lmao if anything id flex my shirt this says more about u then me lmao
---
As soon as they released him, they nerfed the lunge whip and they're still tweaking it
---
I didn't understand a single thing but math
---
This is correct
---
It's not suppose to be usable... It's just hard mode, this is fucking Sekiro all over again
---
Surprisingly enough, no, they weren't rank 20. I was rank 4 and I think they were rank 7-8
---
I'd use Monitor instead of monstrous shrine and maybe NOED instead of Unrelenting unitl you find something better
---
This is whole math tho
---
I think they should just outright change the color of ruin skillchecks, I don’t even have color blindness and I have trouble seeing it. But there shouldn’t be an option to make things like scratchmarks( that are meant to be difficult to see while they are fading) easier to see. I understand the argument for it but I don’t see this change coming. People are acting like it would only be a quality of life change.
---
Also, I don’t mean that I’m toxic 😂 I just mean it’s harder for survivors to be toxic towards me if I’m not the killer.
---
Keys and toolboxes are broken, people meme about it, they're still not nerfed.
---
As a killer main, these statements feel like a personal attack.
---
I can barely read anything even zoomed in
---
But the Winter Solstice has never required any effort whatsoever. Unlike Summer BBQ, Lunar New Year and the Blight events, Winter Solstice is not objective based. It’s literally just a lobby reskin, hooks, barrels and lockers get lights, Winter boxes in the bloodweb and Christmas music. That’s literally it- the devs didn’t actually have to do any work this year, they could’ve just reused assets from last year and nobody would’ve cared because that’s what Winter Solstice has been since 2016. Objective based events are harder to do so it makes sense that they’re easing off on those, but Winter Solstice would’ve taken up no time whatsoever to implement.
---
So tired of these wiggle memes. They should be classified as Oversaturated content. They're becoming the new tier list.
---
When running nemesis + PWYF, eating a DS can be valuable.
---
If you face the direction a survivor will run upon getting DS’d, chase will initiate and be quickly lost as they run away. Since they become the obsession through DS, PWYF gains a stack in this process.
---
Or, you can make no attempt to do this, and just complain that the survivor you tunneled is running DS.
---
Whenever you meet a MadMausi as Survivor, be asured: They'll won't be toxic.   
---
I'm trying to be nice and surprised quite some killers. So sad
---
Well as you can see, all the Legion memes led to the Devs fixing none of their problems. I don’t see what you’re getting at. The devs are to blame. Not the memes. And how are they broken?
---
The Archives (or Tomes), provide lore for the game and its characters. The challenges in the Archives provide both bloodpoints and player XP. XP is used to progress through the Rift.
---
The Rift is a season based progression that awards cosmetics or other rewards as you level it up. There is a free track and a paid track. The paid track included more rewards. If you complete the paid track, you earn back the amount of microtransaction currency that you paid to purchase it.
---
To earn XP for the Rift, all you have to do is play the game. Completing Archive challenges will speed up your progress, but if you play the game enough, you may not need to worry about them. Both aspects of the game can be completed independently of each other, however.
---
Found the meg who bags at the exit gates and has the pink hair cosmetic
---
only toxic if u take it as something toxic which is why I laugh or stop giving a shit
---
There is. I'm not sure how but I know there is. I will get back if I ever find out how.
---
It’s a character....you have this much hate towards a graphic -_- irony anybody could be playing this character.
---
Honestly I think OoO is just a bad perk, I know it’s to reveal the killer and tell people where they are, but I feel they’re just exposing themselves, so of course when I can see someone across the map I’m gonna go after them since I can see them. I don’t mind them using it since they throw themselves under the bus for it which seems unnecessary
---
Maybe if the hooked survivor is last alive? Or if all survivors are on hooks? I’ve seen streakers go afk at hook after hooking the last person, saying it doesn’t matter at that point.
---
it is the new normal
---
One of the players said "That &lt;nword&gt; needs to be lynched with the rest of their kind".
---
how the fuck is this a rant the hell
---
SO you tried EVERYTHING but you still need help... If you tried EVERYTHING and nothing helped why would you still come here and ask?
---
Oh my god do I need to draw everything to you? I'm talking about the fact that people need to yell at the devs to fix things, not make memes about it. As for why rushboxes and keys are broken, I won't even bother going into it, anyone with observational mind, playtime and common sense can see why.

Why cant racism just go away bro, imagine a world without it. Oh wait, we cant cause it'll never happen
---
welcome to the internet
---
Might wanna mark nsfw
---
I need survivors like you T-T I stopped playing killer a while ago and tried playing today and all of my games were filled with teabagging survivors. It’s aggravating and it’s just easier for me to play as a surv. But I don’t ever teabag unless the killer (pig or Ghostface) are teabagging at me in a fun way, cause I know how frustrating it is to have toxic survivors.
---
Dude if you're going to put something like this on blast don't censor the player ID. Otherwise why bother.
---
Shit man one of my neighbors have better internet but some reason their providers won’t provide to us
---
Teabagging is usually toxic regardless of if I take it that way or not.
---
as a killer main, the only time i appreciate them doing this is when im just playing someone for a daily and just wanna get a couple more smacks in. like, i had a nurse daily yesterday and, im still fairly new at the game, ive never played nurse before. the survivors let me get a couple blink hits in before they left, so they all lived and i got my daily done, a win win for both of us.
---
it is just really annoying when im actually trying to do well and they just gen rush me and tbag me at the exit gates though, then i just stand at the opposite side of the map and let them decide if they want to die by the entity themselves or not (which, ive had happen once, someone waited too long to leave and died)
---
I’m watching it without sound, Can someone pls explain what I just witnessed, to me it looks like Micheal killed him self by shoving his hand far up his ass
---
some people have started making up ideas that yes the rift is showing us a new killer idk about a survivor but a killer never the less which is nice
---
I've been playing survivor here and there the last month.  
---
Probably played about 12 matches or so.  
---
Still no pig, plague, oni, clown.
---
When I play her I'm usually nice.  But if you're the last survivor and you've been a pain in my ass all game, I'm killing you if I can.
---
You could have tried new perk even before the rift..........
---
Thanks man. Cuz Legion's my favorite character(s)! I might get more DBD or DBD-inspired tattoos in the future, but started here. I also just plain like the design, so even if I stop playing the game, it can still just be a cool looking design.
---
well I don't want to suffer a stun when I could loop it and get a hit
---
Indeed.
---
They both have counters. Moris are avoidable and can not be utilized unless the killer has hooked people. "Get good" to avoid those then.
---
Very true! Even later in life when dead by daylight becomes irrelevant it's still a tattoo of a hooded guy which looks pretty badass
---
Why use Lithe when the killer gives it to you. 5 perk hacks
---
Well, what if everybody blinked at the same time?
---
As nice as an engine rework would be, as far as I know it’s not that easy. Look at games like Counter Strike. They are trying to update the engine slowly to Source 2 and they’ve been doing this for roughly 2 years now and only a small part of the game has been ported. UI is the first thing I think of, and that’s probably the easiest part of the engine update.
---
It’s not supposed to be useable, but it can be with Iron will do you’re not constantly giving away your location, and dead hard can buy you a hit essentially. I get what you’re saying but it can just be a useable hard mode with Iron will so it’s not super hard mode like The Nameless King in DS3.
---
Survivor:  **ding**
---
BING BONG DING DONG: **BING BONG DING DONG**
---
How dare she play the game
---
Because people with such ignorant and downright stupid beliefs are allowed to breed and instill these beliefs in future generations without repercussions.
---
My NAME ISSSS
---
well think about it like this.
---
Have you and a friend ever said a bad word so much that it has no power between you anymore for me it is "fuck u" it means nothing and like teabagging sure it is toxic but it means nothing anymore
---
mark this nsfw tf bro
---
There is nothing wrong here. What are we supposed to see?
---
NSFW, you egg.
---
The 16, the 2, and me at 7
---
It said the female detective was taken by the entity
---
Even then, I get that gameplay can be toxic - some strategies are unfun to play against.
---
But then people say survivors clicking flashlights and crouching is toxic. That doesn't even have a gameplay impact (I don't think?).
---
Unfortunately that's just how it is right now. They changed swf matchmaking for the worse for killers. Instead of seeing one red rank survivor occasionally, now you get to go against constant high purple or low red rank survivors. I'm rank 8 right now and it's not rare for me to get teams of all rank 2 survivors. Combine that with the recent change to rank reset and the lower rank killers are going to suffer even more. Queue times are worse all around and less skilled killers are getting bad games.
---
Like I usually dont care too much about ranks, but boy is it heartbreaking sometimes
---
because the rules require censoring shit like this. probably so people like you cant go and harass the person over it
---
You are a saucy boy
---
yep and expect next rank reset to put u in the same hell bc red rank survivors and killers are barely fucking moving up from red ranks thank u bhvr
---
No, it’s a joke/meme, she’s not really the entity.
---
I wish I would get a killer that respected pallets. Just play red light green light with them, stop on the other side of the pallet and then don't throw it, when they stop you run another loop and play again lol
---
Ah, back when endgame collapse didn’t exist
---
Being a blatant racist is something a person deserves getting flamed and harassed over. Especially considering video games is how white supremacist groups are going about recruiting new members anymore.
---
At that point I gave up and just stayed in my room lol
---
I even tried to farm but they didn't get the hint.
---
Yeah I don’t care for the rift much, so once I got to rift 2 and it told me to use agitation(which I don’t have), I don’t want to have to play trapper that hasn’t been used at all at green ranks. I was like “it’s been great, but it hasn’t”
---
A lot of my games that would be easy wins, I played shit at the end to give the killer a kill. I always feel bad if they don't have at least one kill.
---
With the amount of backing up they do I've gotten another 1-2 loops every time. I just need 4 pallet stuns
---
I know queue times would be longer but I dont understand why they dont just match you to your own color rank, maybe lower ranks would take longer.
---
I think we all know who wins.
---
Are you colorblind? If not, then please don't say "They're meant to be hard to see". Because it makes you seem inconsiderate.
---
Normie here, what does devotion mean and/or do??
---
Why do people give so much hate for setups like this? It’s not peoples faults they like using good perks!
---
well gl
---
I only went into it once. Don't know if it still happens in the other room.
---
You crazy son of a bitch, you actually did it
---
I want the disrespect, Fight Back is the last challenge I have to do
---
the matchmaking tries but bc u dont wanna wait for 50 years it just says fuck it and puts u as close as possible
---
how do I know my teammates are also doing totems? I wouldn’t care about NOED if survivors got a totem counter in the HUD, I promise you that
---
Yall acting like you had a job
---
Can’t say I’ve ever done that with any of my friends. But I mean regardless of how many times  it happens to me, it still sucks and it’s still frustrating. I like playing DbD but survivorslike that make it not fun anymore
---
Heal is interaction and pallets are actions, so you can bind them on different buttons. Idk if they're different on Xbox.
---
LOL it be like that sometimes
---
It is! I suck at Nurse so I need it lol
---
Mm..... fair enough.
---
Dwight and the gang about to start the DnD session
---
the way survivors are placed
---
well for me it is like this and I wish more people could see it like me but maybe someday
---
ATHF was such an amazing show. This is great lmao.
---
Probably only when the gen spawns at the end of the catwalk thing.
---
Yeah, dbd mobile has a sound visual thing so why not have it as an option for PC/Consoles?
---
Yeah. The post is about you doing an action, in a stupid position, next to a killer and in an unsafe location, hence, you blame the game for the reveal mechanic. Part of it is for sure games fault dont get me wrong, but you did that pretty stupidly.
---
Well, it's a bit hard. It won't let you get inside immediately, you have to hold your blink for a while longer.
---
Pog
---
Same basic ingredients 😏
---
Nurse
---
First you do the gen then your teammate heals you
---
We’ve yelling at them! They don’t do anything. The memes make more people yell at them.
---
That sounds a little condescending... but I mean that’s good on you for having that type of mentality. I don’t play killer enough to get used to the teabagging.
---
Fact
---
That would be an interesting concept for the secondary objectives people are always suggesting.
---
It could be a ~20 second repair with some difficult skill checks to disable the bell, and similar location giveaways could be placed in other spots around maps.
---
Rant doesnt necessarily mean negative.
---
Freddy, spirit, hillbily, nurse.
---
*crowd groans at another post bitching about matchmaking*
---
That's essentially what happened. Michael was saying that his ass finally decided to eat his hand, that it hungers, blahblahblah. At the end of the day, Ghostie ordered one hoagie since Michael died.
---
too damn positive
---
wow, looks great, got any more?
---
You belong on this sub sir.
---
it is not meant to be condescending
---
damn right
---
Somehow my comment seems much more normal than what I just read
---
Beat me to it XD noice
---
wait he can't vault it? that is fucking toxic dude
---
Added Feng - The Main Event
---
Bruh if you were my teammate, i would be begging to heal you. I run second wind, and that alone makes me want to heal anything that breathes. I don’t care if it’s bad, i like it.
---
I'm here for ya.
---
Fair enough, I use Mettle of Man. Heal me all you want
---
Probably to fit with his backstory, since he was a photographer for the newspaper when he wasn't murdering people, and to differentiate him from Scream's Ghostfaces; who are infamous for using cellphones.
---
There's like a phenomenon where Ghostface mains are either really chill and meme a lot, or are complete and utter fucking ass holes who BM, tea bag, and use their power to camp. I rather be face camped than lean camped though.
---
Yeah bad killers are the only thing that make that challenge difficult.  If you got a beginner killer that respects every pallet just stand there and toss it as they swing.  You'll eat the hit but you'll get the stun.  Do that a second time for the down you're halfway done.  After you get saved and healed up you can rinse and repeat for your challenge.  It sure as shit isn't optimal since you're feeding yourself to them twice but you'll get the challenge guaranteed.  I got it that way against a Plague.  Also run Any Means Necessary it helps.
---
it is in his name FACE like leatherface it makes sense now
---
This reminds me of the old days where everyone made TF2 Animations.
---
Almost made me shed a tear
---
Trapper just slightly turning his head towards you in the end is gold
---
I got once 7 hits in a row, The whole video I was like „please don‘t beat my record“. Phu
---
Wow I figured the NSFW would just be an edgy meme not some actual weird, gross shit.
---
I'm sorry the job of the killer is to KILL survivors. If this was in reverse would a survivor let the killer kill them out of pity, nope never happened to me
---
I am the only who want a buff to stake out? I only want one token more, the time reduced to ten seconds and the possibility to win tokens in chases
---
Me and my friend were thinking of doing the same half a year ago before but gave up on the project... Yknow what challenge accepted!
---
I see a buff in the future?
---
Cause that's just stupid
---
Holy shit, I made the post. I'm pretty sure I get to decide what it's about, not you. Stop being so pigheaded.
---
Hahaha what the hell thats new
---
I‘m in rank 4 and started at the end of February this year
---
Rank 19 Trapper who finally caught a Survivor after 4 Gens: **y e s**
---
Mein-Kraft.
---
Straight up. I'm just memeing but I agree that OP builds or good runners are a thing in the game and should be loved equally.
---
The cheapest shit attract the most customers. or in this case, the easiest killers attract the biggest cunts.
---
It seems the simpler the killer, the more cunts play them. And since literally all you have to do with GF is shroud in chase and hold W, you can see why so many assholes play him.
---
It’s not gay unless they touch chains
---
i see you all over this sub but like why are you so mean for literally no reason?
---
Ruin skill checks, auras, or scratch marks? Ruin skill checks and auras are not meant to be hard to see. I’ve seen colorblind people try to hit ruin skill checks. While amusing, Yes it is a problem and should be addressed. I kept getting frustrated at a kid in kyf while teaching him how to hit ruin skillchecks (like 20 in the span of 5 minutes) until he finally told me he was colorblind and couldn’t see the damn things. Scratch marks on the other hand, fade over 10 seconds. In other words, they are meant to become progressively harder to see. The color it would change to ( in this accessibility mode) would likely be easier to see for everyone. More competitive players would likely switch to this mode to perform better. Please don’t virtue signal and call me inconsiderate for not wanting to have to look at the ugly ass colorblind mode scratchmarks just to be competitive compared to other killers. 
---
Also if you are going to put quotation marks around something I’ve said, don’t change what I’ve said to make me look like an asshole. That’s not even a direct quote.
---
Ouuuu I like that
---
I got it after about 5 matches. I got lucky because the killer in that 5th match wasn't good at pressuring. The other 4 games I basically got found first and tunneled. It's very luck based.
---
Yep, can't vault it because it's supposed to only be stopped by breaking the pallet.
---
I am proud to say I’m a meme ghostface main and usually let the last survivor get the hatch or exit gate but sometimes when grinding bp I go for a 4K if I can
---
Would smash
---
Thank you for making me laugh. Have my updoot.
---
Ironically I’m viewing this post after a Ghostface gave me hatch
---
They do the usual release and neuter technique they've been doing for 2 years now, on top of being totally incompetent game designers
---
Yeah they said less events so they can focus on balancing the game, but ever since then they have badly balanced the killers, haven't fixed hit boxes, fps, matchmaking and since then took a christmas break. Oh and I almost forgot, while they did do less events this year, they did crank out expensive cosmetics every wednesday or every holiday.
---
And they say there’s a game in this bug
---
I actually completed that challenge in two tries while playing legitimately
---
&gt;The 16, the 2, and me at 7
---
2 to 7 is normal matchmaking, within 6 ranks of each other. Even if you had a rank 1 in your match it would still be normal.
---
Rank 16 was probably SWF with one of the others.
---
Its so sad that noobs can wear golden feng and stuff , hard to watch
---
I made it to counter people unhooking right in front of your face the second a survivor is on the hook
---
By the way, check out a sub called MusicFromGames: lots of OSTs,but also custom soundtracks and preparation/motivation music. Also a great source.
---
Usually the lobbies are all survivors standing in a straight line, instead of this diagonal one that I got.
---
yeah isnt it a female detective and a female killer that feeds you to her pig(s)?
---
I mean someone has to like it
---
Yea they didn’t act like SWF though which is weird. And yea I don’t care abt going against those, it’s just shitty I can be matched with a rank 13 and the game sees it as chill
---
¿Solo que?
---
I tried it its fun, i got yelled at me for it.
---
If they just sit on a gen thinking they are safe because of DS, slug em and pressure somewhere else. A downed survivor wastes time for 2 people and if you managed to find another that’s 3 people not on gens.
---
Oh, yeah sorry about the quotes thing I misuse them a lot. But you do seem inconsiderate, the slight advantage other people get because the marks/aura are a different color shouldn't be more important than the people who can't even see them to begin with.
---
You do. Doesnt mean you get to avoid my critism for a dumb play.
---
Toss a coin to your Witcher!
---
Rift is a battlepass, you don't care unless you pay for the most part. More you play the more you get
---
Tome is challenges, you can select one to try and achieve per game, for the most part its stuff you should or at least **could have** been doing every game anyway so it doesn't diverge your interests too much. 
---
EG: Do two generators or Open a chest. The farther you go, the harder they are.
---
Distressing is the perk name in English. 
---
Increases T.R by 26%.
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse - Doctor Teachable might work really well with this build as it does the same as Distressing but only during chases causing screams as the chase ends.
---
more like moried lmao
---
i fail to see the logic here, DS activates AFTER being unhooked, at any rate, if the killer chases you, there are 2 scenarios, either you escape(or extend the chase long enought for DS to run out, you are fucked then) or the killer downs you, from there he can either slug you and let DS run its course or, if you are lucky, get to use it.
---
Why did i go trought all that explanation? because there is no point in wasting pallets if you have DS on command, which requires you to get hooked first so you won't have it on your first run.
---
Honestly making it like Head On for vaulting would be absolutely hilarious. Just get rid of the rest of it.
---
wow poor legion
---
Awesome. Which controller are you using if not a PS4 or Xbox one?
---
Looks like Spirit from Dead By Daylight...
---
He stabs him.
---
Right she was trying to prevent a cult sacrifice, good catch.
---
No.
---
Its holidays for me so i can play for like 10 hours max and today got like 5 tiers up so 8×5=40 and i am on 27 tier so i will be about 67 tier if i keep up 5 tiers per day
---
Yup, a detective involved with the cult and a woman that lured men and fed them to pigs (not sure if literal or figurative.)
---
It sounds like they are teasing future survivor and killer with these entries.
---
She literally knew you had that perk but she left the god pallet still bruh
---
You could have sacrificed them too, but this is great for style points
---
I wanna know what template that is. Looks like a movie, and an interesting one at that
---
Today i got 5 or 4 tiers so 8×5=40 and i am at 27 so 67 should be if i keep up the 5 tiers per day
---
I'm guessing the cosmetic department gets no breaks uh
---
Ramalam \*bing bong\* ramalam \*ding bing bong\* bam bam bam... :D
---
Is anyone here?
---
Yes.
---
It should be done soon since the holidays are over, there’s always some shit that’s broken and then everyone goes on holiday to fix it next year.
---
Oh yeah I completely forgot it ever existed lol, but those would be really neat additions
---
Here's a tip, if they have TTV in their name they aren't good at the game. 
---
Real skilled streamers don't bother with the extension to try and advertise because they already have a fanbase. Hell, they use aliases like Cherry O.P. Eggplant, or Overly Tenacious Zebra (figure out who those are if you will).
---
They crank out more cosmetics every week than we get balance updates since the game initially released.
---
I know there's this and the pig mains sub, but are there others for other killer mains?
---
That's actually correct. Maybe if you were polite, said THAT to begin with, or just didn't say shit, that dumbshit argument could've been avoided. But I doubt you care because you probably do this all day.
---
I bought this
---
You clearly didn’t read my last message close enough. I am in favor of making auras easier to see, they are meant to be easy to see, the entire portion of the time they are active. Likely, the only change that would happen with auras is hiding behind gens to hide aura which is partially removed anyway while on a gen. And Ok fair. Call me inconsiderate. Answer this: Is it only a slight change? How do you know? Have you ever developed accessibility setting for colorblind people on a video game? Would it be costly to develop? Maybe it could completely change scratchmarks in the game. We don’t know. Call me an inconsiderate asshole, but I feel like the devs should (and probably are) considering those questions before rushing this kind of project. Should we risk changing a core function of competitive gameplay for an extremely small portion of the community without even considering that? People act like this is such an easy and needed fix they are acting like there is a 0% chance that there will be unintended consequences.
---
I don’t know the numbers but I’m sure as hell not someone who is one to rush into things for a small group of people. What if I’m completely blind or deaf and want to play? Are we going to have a little blinker that shows exactly where every noise is coming from? Or a voice that tells you there is a immersed Claudette halfway across the map that you probably wouldn’t have been able to see with vision
---
Nurse sucks in indoor maps now. You just can\`t wait 4 seconds to have 2 blinks again and then guess in which room the survivor went...
---
I meeeaaaannnn, Freddy got beefed to incredible viability, nurse got her add ons changed and a slight tweak that most players agreed were unnoticeable, spirit got add ons tweaked and that's about it (also a window vault animation i guess), and doc hasn't been shown fully yet.
---
In reality the only killer who really got fucked this year was legion. Oni a bit too but he can still do something contrary to legions entire existence being a mending fest. I forget whether EGC got added this year or last but if it's the former than i guess pig also got hurt badly but in all honesty having EGC is better than not having it so it's whatev in my book, they'll touch her up soon enough.
---
On top of just the killer reworks not actually hurting many of the killers, Insta heals were removed, balanced landing was changed. The only real buff that's come for a meta survivor perk was BT which was unneeded but Legion caused it
---
I argue that Pyro is the cutest creature in this world.
---
There's a clown one, I think
---
I can already see a lot of killer mains complaining about this being “unfair.”
---
To play this game for any prolonged period of time, you just need to accept the toxicity as part of the package. People are going to play like douchebags on both sides and essentially nothing can be done about that fact. You either have to brush it off and let it go, or find something else to spend your time with, it's part of the reason I've actually taken multiple breaks from the game
---
I love how adorable this is yet in the context of a horror game lol
---
The ones that actually have skill are either unwilling to admit their own mistakes or are actually good but dont get many views because they dont think the same way as the people who stop by for whatever reason. I only mentioned TTVs because they're the only ones I know if they're complaining outside of post game chat. I've stopped into streams and heard them insult me because I'm a "braindead killer main who needs Ruin and NOED to get kills."
---
The only thing I can think of for Overly Tenacious Zebra is Otzdarva because OTZ. Cherry O.P. Eggplant might be COPE
---
&gt; I think it has the most build potential
---
Head On along with Inner Strength, Q&amp;Q and Lucky Break. Force killer to waste time checking lockers and waste even more time eating a stun when they get to yours. No blood means they can't make an easy guess which locker you're in. Works well anywhere there's a ton of lockers in an area.
---
I’m a wraith main and I am going to have to agree with this. But I still like him.
---
TONIGHT
---
This. It's basically one or the other according to most survivors. There's also:
---
No gens get done while you're in a 15 second chase? MY TEAMMATES ARE TRASH
---
5 gens pop in 5 minutes? Finally some good teammates!
---
Guess you shouldn't have doubted, huh?
---
I find that they give cosmetics to survivors that already have plenty of good ones but then characters like David are left with pretty bad ones or characters like Adam get literally none
---
I don't know what it means, but I get it all the time and I don't cheat or have any issues, so you should be fine.
---
David and Jeff
---
Just don’t cheat forehead
---
Demogorgon?
---
Bruh im in this locker go away
---
I've only ever played her for dailies and against her when I play survivor. I found her fun to play against if there were weren't any blink addons or the omega blink. I didn't find her fun to play as because I can't hit blinks for shit so I don't do her dailies now.
---
I have never cheated I am only new (6 hours)
---
What if BHVR actually gave Claudette a decent head? Would the game crash or something?
---
In prior PTB notes they had the duration longer, about ~2min broken I think, but they changed it before it went to live.
---
Ok thank you
---
So 4 k’ing and beating most of his opponents is too casual and him not being good at the game... got it. 🙄
---
Impact = small
---
Why should a low tier killer be nerfed? If he / she is in the low tier, shouldn't he / she receive a buff?
---
Let me translate that for you:
---
“Who are you do not message me or else (wnung?) I mean it”
---
He also has absolutely perfect grammar.
---
Perfection
---
nobody asked for you to be a raging cunt for no particular reason either so there's that
---
Once you hit level 100, it resets back to level 1 and you get a devotion level (it keeps going). Basically doesnt do anything but start you over, earning less shards per level but also leveling faster. Nothing changes per devotion level unfortunately :)
---
Ah see that’s the thing, you’ve gotta have more experience with her, I like her rework because it makes her harder now and she has a higher skill gap for being such a good killer
---
I think everyone gets that every now and then? At first I thought I get it because I have custom character portraits and EAC sees that as a security violation but apparently not
---
People just need to chill out about them, like jeeze it's a marathon not a sprint.
---
i just thought of an interesting idea after reading what you said about not being stunned from stabbing the same guy. stabbing someone during frenzy adding some kind of debuff to the survivor stabbed or buff to the killer that increases in effectiveness based on the amount of times you stab him, but increases in duration for the amount of different survivors you stab during the same frenzy. idk what kind of debuff it would be or what the numbers would be, but it keeps a similar feel to the current power while being more interesting to play as and making it less of a healing simulator for the survivors
---
Had a spirit that somehow had no terror radius (only been playing the game for a little bit so I'm not sure what combination of perks they must have had) yank me off a gen yesterday and it's the first time I've actually jumped so far.
---
Fr looks awesome!
---
&gt;calls slugging toxic
---
Lmfao and the rework for his face
---
I just want to use this opportunity to hate on Michael Myers.
---
He can eat my booty
---
Love it
---
Go and watch Otz play Freddy against a 4 man swf who were completely destroying red ranks and had already destroyed him several times previously. The one time he saw them coming and decided to prepare properly he used Freddy of all killers to fuck them. Freddy is definitely viable against top teams.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5uUUAz7m1U
---
This is why you always look towards the entrance areas
---
That's nothing special with the perk
---
Now I want this in the game. The back story is nice and the power and perks

Try Dark Devotion on her! And for extra confusion, use Granma’s Heart add-on! Super fun
---
All killers confirmed to be pallets.
---
How would that work? Carry you to the exit and you somehow get out when he drops you?
---
Haven’t made rank 1 yet but I am a wraith main and agree with you. He has really good add ons and he’s pretty bad.
---
There is nothing more embarrassing than trapping yourself. Lol
---
Well I lied...the only thing more embarrassing is camping that hard.
---
interesting
---
Scoops ahoy and tapp
---
Nice. Thanks
---
Makes sense. If it were available, people would already be playing it. Figured I'd ask anyway
---
More fun that way
---
You can actually do this it on the report screen. But as far as I'm aware it doesn't actually tell the player or do anything.
---
IMO a killer should be hard but not so hard that dailies are hell if you can't play the killer well seeing as this isnt a competitive game. I had fun against Nurse even if I'm not a survivor main when there werent any extra blinks.
---
Always make sure to tell the killer thank you for not showing them mercy.
---
Our community is too.toxic for that to ever work anyway. Killers are often times toxic towards survivors and survivors are 9 times out of 10 super toxic towards both the killer as well as other survivors.
---
Yes, I know the cosmetic team doesn't balance the game, but they do use more financial resources. Also, I understand the validation process, but that doesn't mean you should delay balance updates for months to a year. I mean, they announced they were working on dedicated servers since the game awards last year and even had several beta tests. Yet, they haven't fixed many of the issues since day one. Oh what about the fact that they have gone on stream and said they rather focus on making new chapters than actual balance updates? You bring up the point that BHVR wants to provide balance updates to all platforms and yet, they havent even fixed the biggest issues with consoles. All console players have gotten have been cosmetics and occasional new chapter updates. Im not even sure if they have properly implemented dedicated servers on consoles either. Its beyond ridiculous that these devs rather focus on cosmetics and new chapters than to release a optimization update for the game. Hell, even the new content comes out unbalanced and buggy with overpriced cosmetics.
---
this is that delusional victimhood shit I crave
---
The highest level of fashion one can ever achieve
---
Well, there is something, but it's in the same place you report people, abd it does jack shit. I don't even think it tells the player that you commended them. Either that or nobody commends me ever, and now I feel sad
---
[This in a meme format](https://ibb.co/sjKcyHB)
---
There was a point in time where if you used Dead Hard at just the right time while leaving the i-frames would prevent the trap from going off. But I'm fairly certain this has been fixed.
---
I haven't heard of or seen activated traps not going off in any other cases.
---
Omg you called me a cunt why are you so mean you hurt my feelings 😭😭😭
---
Just kidding I'm not a weak pansy so I really dgaf lol!
---
Ugh, well done ace you won a match. Time to move on buddy
---
It also sucks as the survivor because you think you did amazing but the killer is rank 10 while you're a red rank.
---
It destroys what little accomplishment I feel from pipping.
---
Gotcha sorry for the confusion
---
Yup. If you are cleansing totems and miss 1 then obviously you will have a much harder time finding it once its activated. If you didn't cleanse then it could be super easy to find
---
Yeah but the thing is nurse is super powerful and she was one of the few killer that could consistently 4K with no perks or add ons so she should’ve been nerfed
---
Edit: imo
---
Well, that is just, and you'll have to excuse me, presumptious bollocks. There are "toxic" players all around, in literally every game-related fandom. Why should we care about those ? For one, Overwatch is supposed to be a king of toxicity and in there it actually works. Like... actually really works. With even enemy teams endorsing good play.
---
imo this one is her prettiest face the others are so bad :(
---
same with nea tho
---
What....
---
All I can hear is the actual lyrics.
---
Our best bet is probably something akin to what overwatch is doing with a “sequel”. Keep all of the same characters and progression people have made but release an entirely updated game.
---
A dead one.
---
It's not a bad idea theres some fun despite the bugs in early patches. Maybe one day.
---
I know, but it's not Overwatch-like (more like Blizzard-like, because pretty much the same thing is in HotS) as I kinda try to suggest.
---
based on mere speculation, because you're on this sub constantly, you just have a shitty attitude and are really rude to other members for no reason, no weakness here, just noticed you have a bad case of being a jerkoff and projecting it onto others lol
---
Most (useful) killer perks manifest themselves in some way during the game, so if I've learned your 4 perks and noed isn't among them, then you don't have noed.
---
Yep, right on both. Haven't played with Otz but Brother Cope is one state away from me so I end up in his games often. Great player and funny dude!
---
SWF abuse this game since its release and BHVR doesn't seem to care.
---
*Shift and Space intensifies*
---
I agree. I play tombstone Myers more than I should and  considering if I caught someone there with no window and just stalked them until I killed them that’s not very fair or balanced in any way so it really should be removed. And even if there was a vault there if you’re working on the gen and they don’t notice you sneaking up I could still body block to expose them and then insta kill them because there is not one single thing that they can do. I don’t do this cause I don’t like taking advantage of dbd’s glitches and problems but I hadn’t even though of this that hard. 
---
These slender closet gens with sometimes no window needs to 100% be removed; I don’t have an immediate solution but I’ve never really thought about how broken it actually is for some killers if you got caught off guard. Even if they made it so you could see around the door to see if the killer is coming up- that way at least you have an angle of something like you would on any other gen and not just be starring at a wall until your inevitable death.
---
I'm also a largely killer main and GOD I love playing this build, it's a nightmare lmao
---
Gotta make the most of that mori animation!!!
---
Thanks for reminding how much I need a two killer mode. It would fit quite a lot of modern horror movie with multiple villains instead of one big villain who embodies pure evil by himself.
---
Scream was literally a 2 killer mmovie Us was an entire Nation of villains etc...
---
Seriously, we need this mode...
---
David’s cosmetics only look good if you mix and match and even then you’re basically limited to shirtless and camo pants, he definitely needs new normal looking cosmetics. And ffs give him a head with a normal looking beard lmao
---
I run NOED because Doc cant instakill, and I will run it even more once I unlock Blood Warden
---
Right, Freddy was made top tier, nurse got killed at the high ranks, killers actually need skill to use spirit now. Meanwhile, trapper got infinitely stuck in his own traps, pig got nerfed, oni got nerfed and legion got killed overall. Lets see, EGC is great but still has problems. Every killer has amazing lunges through pallets and windows. Matchmaking is broken for both sides. Maps are unbalanced for both sides. Devs forget about balance/optimization while they work on new overpriced cosmetics, new chapters and pay to earn battlepass (I mean, tomes) and extremely hard and game throwing challenges. The list can go on and on because I only listed a few things here. Hopefully next year the devs can wake up and fix what's wrong with the game.
---
Then what happens if you want to use a flashlight while injured with self care?
---
These players are a pain in the ass for sure.... Some of them even have the nerv to call YOU a dipshi for not working as they want you to.
---
Like instant heal after unhooking.
---
That's because the controls and the extra action button to unhook are so janky that you can't pull off the same hook techs you can on PC or console. Also Borrowed Time is stupid rare since it's thrown in the general perk pool. I've gotten 3 survivors to 40 and have yet to see it. I've only ever seen one other person with it and I'm currently rank 6.
---
What is this shit? No literally what is the point of this?
---
Overwatch is nowhere as toxic as GTA Online or Dead By Daylight.
---
I have my items mapped to B
---
Yes you are weak or you wouldn't feel the need to comment "why are you so mean?!" especially when I wasn't even talking to you
---
It could by all means just be a bug or what you just said but still, wanted that juicy bear trap snap :(
---
I've never heard of brother cope but I know who Otzdarva is. Ive never played against either of them. I just guessed because of the capital letters. It's like morsecode but it's not.
---
LOL that gasp. For me it's usually triggering the hags traps.
---
One time I was playing against a Myers, this dude spent over an hour trying to down all 4 survivors at once. At the end of it all, he chased all four of us to the exit gates, and fucked us all up with noed. Only 1 person escaped because Myers let her have hatch, guess he was just trying to prove a point. But, I feel like everyone managed to pip that game, lol.
---
Yeah, but you gotta admit. When you dunk on them, and go watch the game from their perspective it's pretty funny to see them get so heated.
---
Was trying to complete billy chase daily and break Pallets with Enduring daily, found a survivor and when she saw that I wasn’t going to attack, we than ran around the map practicing loops and just farting around. Had lots of fun and met new people to play with. Good times.
---
This doesn’t mean each game has ~50% or less survival rate.  This mostly means that sometimes killers get pitted against SWF and get no kills, or get pitted against a bunch of randoms with no comms and get a 4K.
---
Legion deserves it
---
Watched this a few times. Have no clue what I'm watching other than a claudette run
---
Strange. No idea how I'm playing and enjoying it still, then. DbD, that is.
---
Then you get back up with unbreakable lol.
---
If you believe you can achieve! xD
---
I’ve had survs message me afterwards saying “gg ez” or “baby killer”. I’m all for having really good survivors, I just wish they weren’t dicks about it.
---
Well no one wants to admit they ate 9 cans of ravioli.
---
A mobile controller by beboncool, [the controller](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQTKLRN/ref=cm_sw_r_other_apa_i_pgscEb7NP7MDR)
---
I run NOED just in case my Ruin doesn't stay up for long or in case they just decide to work through Ruin and also so if I close hatch the game doesn't last longer because I have to chase and down the survivor.
---
Jake disappears from the corner as she is running up.  Its really small.
---
Not on console that's for sure.
---
Really? It must be just be stupid rng because I have bt on my Dwight and Claudette and they’re both only around level 20-25. I don’t like that bill’s teachables are just perks you unlock by playing as that character but I do like when it gives you the option to pick between multiple perks to level up when you do play a good match.
---
Edit; dbd mobile is weird, but a good type of weird.
---
I assume and hope a lot of the things you mentioned get fixed, and if not it still really feels like dead by daylight.
---
Friend got disconnected from the game right after being hooked. I had kindred and could see the killer's aura anywhere on the map for the rest of the game.
---
This just proves not everyone thinks the same way about different things. What one might think is fine, another might think is strong or weak. What one might find fun, another might find unfun.
---
He probably never wins, so this is a huge accomplishment for him
---
why tf is this so menacing
---
Holy shit that's like .0000001 of a second lol thanks for pointing it out
---
your mad lol
---
I like Mint Rag + Make Your Choice. You’ll notice that Survivors become very scared to un-hook when they realize what’s going on. Plus it’s always hilarious to trade people off Hooks over and over again.
---
If I had platinum, I'd award you
---
* submissions from new accounts are not allowed in /r/deadbydaylight, due to scam bots. 
---
Which only works once, and if you’re chasing someone else 9/10 times they are not gonna use it, because someone else would be safe to come. 
---
This is assuming their SWF ofcourse because all the randoms I meer as a survivor run halfway across the map to heal.
---

When he said SSTTTTEEEE I really felt that.

I made sure to save the clip haha. I was like omg!!!
---
Why is it killers can disconnect in game and survivors depip? Why should we be punished for playing well.
---
It works both ways. Unfortunately there are idiotic douche bags on both sides.
---
Just leave bad feedback for the team.

ah?? i personally never see anyone using that perk except for me :&gt;

holy shit. the sub i didn't know i needed. thank you
---
The last gens of xbox and ps4 run it okay. Still choppy sometimes but it works well enough.
---
thanks man!
---
But it doesn't show that. 75% is a 3k average only 3 killers goes above 75%. Not to mention there is a lot of factors that go into those stats
---
You're welcome, welcome to the stabbygang 🔪
---
True, well I’m glad we had this discussion non the less
---
But it is noobs that use noed.
---
Noob really is just a new, inexperienced person. He’s a genuine rank 14, I don’t think deep down he would disagree.
---
And its Nea that has the pink hair, noob
---
The only "nerfing" that is needed in this game right now are certain individual addons and addon combinations and some more changes to spirit to introduce more counter play and make her more fun to face (while keeping her strong ofc).  The level of power that all killers should be is around base hillbilly without addons.  All killers shouldn't be addon reliant either.
---
I play dbd primarily on switch now and yes, it's ass, the maps with rain are the worst in terms of FPS.
---
Queues are ok-ish if you stay around r10.
---
bhvr said nothing and considering for how long xbone and ps4 versions have been in this state I doubt they do much about switch.
---
As far as I’m aware, they’re actually trying to fix this. As a survivor I almost never dc (only done it once, against a hacker) I’ve even stayed when all three others dced, not much you can do at that point, other than farming to make sure you both don’t depip. I had two dcs yesterday playing legion, so I let their teammates get the 4 gens left (with some harassment and dicking around, of course)

Are you kidding? Legion, despite all the crying about his strength is still one of the most common killers out there.
---
If I slug someone and then hook another person, I usually try to leave them close together and then abandon the other person entirely. The slugged guy can become one tap and when I go chase the other dude the next guy can go make a big hero play and up the other two. Or I slug a dude and go back to pick him up and take him to a far away hook so he has a chance to get off and get free.
---
Claudettes that wear the darkest possible clothes and do nothing but hide the entire match
---
What killer are you playing? If it’s legion or especially plague, some dcs are expected
---
A Claudette who wears P3 or her darkest/most camo outfits like the brown recolor.
---
Basically somebody using Claudette for a strategic edge rather than that they actually like her.
---
Welcome to the jungle
---
r/StabbyGang rise up!
---
He’s low ranks what do you expect? Vs survivors with brains he gets stomped
---
No, lithe is probably the worst exhaustion perk
---
The reddit gods have decided this isn't funny so you get downvoted now. Comedy isn't subjective you fool.
---
Same thing happens with me with survivor. Just replace teabag with face camping (wont leave me alone with no survivors near the hook and my team wont try to get me) and replace pointing with dying first every time.
---
Hot damn
---
what for? to increase the survivors egos? its useless
---
&gt; but I just feel like the current setup gives people too many chances to try and ruin the game for others... 
---
Pretty much
---
ooga booga
---
Unless it's a survivor crew of some highly experienced, high ranked players - SWF are 8/10 super casual and not that good, at the game. So, I'm not assuming a sweaty team, at all. 4 good randoms, who know totem spawns, know how to run and spread are far more dangerous, in my experience. Mostly because they know when to cut their losses and are not shackled to ''but we can't leave john''.
---
I'm rank 6 killer, atm.
---
The Endgame update makes it necessary for the Reverse Bear Traps to be active,counting down, in order to  go off when they attempt to escape through the exit gates.
---
Gentlemen*
---
That’s the laugh of a true role playing killer! Lol
---
Wanna see a sexy Hag next? Cool
---
Okay then. If you guys hate it so much I guess I’ll just delete the post then.
---
Bahaha "U mad bro?!"...how predictable lol! Nah not mad I don't anger easy but nice assumption yet again lol!
---
Also, Spongebob lowkey shirtless david
---
*Welcome to the jungle, we take it day by day*
---
Oh, sorry off topic.
---
more like hate, its pointing out that its a useless idea
---
Because I'm only at rank 5, far from the top ranks. There's going to be skills I don't have. What's not helping is you being a giant jackass and coming in here like you're all high and mighty and not offering anything to help. Either help or get the fuck off my post with your toxic bullshit.
---
Also, I believe, If you cause the timer to pause, like from chasing them out, the trap will not be "active", thus no death.
---
None of the other options really seemed to fit any better. I suppose I could have left it blank but I always get yelled at by kids in different forums for that so now it’s habit to just pick something. 
---
Also, of all the things in the world to complain about....🙃
---
Okay. Okay. Useless this, useless that. Fine, got it. No idea why it’s in other games and works fine.
---
I meant more in the “cocky behaviour” department. I have never seen one of my teammates jump on a gen right after an unhook before. 
---
Not saying all SWF are tryhard toxic people but they tend to do these things more then solo players.
---
michael is blonde
---
There’s a give props option, or on pc you can congratulate them in the after chat. There’s not really a way for the system to choose a “play of the game” type commendation, because then what decides it? You would end up with the jackass that broke every totem on the map and farmed his teammates getting more points than the gen jockey and/or looper carrying the whole match. Unless it was decided by vote maybe? But then you’d have swf groups patting each other on the back while the solo gets nothing.
---
I like when people aren't like YOU'RE WRONG (even if it's a situation where you admit you're wrong) and start downvoting because you don't think the same way as they do.
---
lmao i just lost my shit i dunno why it isn't even that funny xD
---
It is unfair or should ruin now stop survivors entiraly from reparing gen as long as the totem is still existing?
---
I tested it with my friends, it doesn’t notify you for jack shit.
---
Imo I feel like that would really limit my ability to flashlight stun as the controls wouldn’t feel as fluent to me but it’s all up to preference. If it works well for you that’s great glad for ya but I would just like some full on button mapping layout where I can remap every action.  I mean it’s not a huge ask the games been out for like 3 years and if we aren’t getting our dedicated servers at least we could get some support in this aspect so you don’t throw down a pallet trying to self care or pick someone up who’s under a pallet. 
---
It’s not something I can see being changed in the near future but I really wish they’d focus more on this aspect as I’ve been playing dbd mobile and the button layout is dog shit to put it very nicely you have 0 options whatsoever when it comes to control besides sensitivity and I can see that not being fixed when it’s released in NA which really bothers me because as killer it’s REALLY bad; if you put on auto it aims idk where and the alternative is- move with the left joystick on the screen towards them while aiming the screen at them on the right side of the screen, while also pressing a button on the right lower side to get a hit. It’s just so inconvenient and I think a lot of people would agree that button mapping on more platforms would just be a win-win all around.
---
Just so i understand correctly, this does not mean putting them on but the decal around the survivor must have the red timer for it to insta-kill them. Having it as the grey timer will let them escape?
---
ah right forgot dbd is a 5v5 team fps
---
They're French Canadian, what do you expect?
---
Jeff's are good at least, except his biker hair being glued to his forehead.
---
Why should it be one to have a system like that ?
---
It’s a map add on. Only survivors can see it. It’s just to mark things.
---
I believe so.
---
yeeeeerrrrrr maaaad
---
It’s a map add on that allows the user to place beacons for other survs to see
---
Map add on
---
I've had a twitchie hide behind a rock without iron will and start shittalking me and calling me a stream sniper. I went into his stream after the match ended and all I asked was "What made you think I was stream sniping?" He started saying "You know what you did" and called me a troll. He ended up banning me and said "If you want to know  the answer, give me your money or sub to me." His chat backed him up too.
---
Fixed the video clip since it's a little hard to see without zooming in. I was running up to Jake to heal him since he was injured, but as I get closer to him he randomly disappears.
---
People do that, on higher ranks, when they know they have DS and plan on forcing you to move from the gen or area.
---
A survivor gets glued on a gen, you down him, can't hook or you get DS'd. He's recovering fast with unbreakable, not even standing up just waiting. So you either damage the gen and move on elsewhere and try to pressure someone else, or you lose the map by idling around the body, you cannot hook.
---
And there is always another survivor, assuming they are good players, who orbits the area waiting to pick him up.
---
Eating a DS is not a big deal, if you are in somewhat dead area, and you can easily catch up. But if you are a bit behind, you have to slug and move on.
---
Just coming back from a break since before stranger things, I can relate. As  soon as I hit rank 10 on killer, i might as well be rank 1 because literally EVERY game is red and purple rank survivors. 
---
Funny enough as a purple rank survivor, I am getting yellow and brown killers very consistently. I dont think I've seen a purple or red killer since August. Hardly even any green rank killers, seriously mostly one to three perk yellow and brown.
---
Is there a serious shortage of high ranked killers on ps4?
---
Might have to do some testing to know for certain. Thanks bud
---
As a killer main, I think I can vouch that a good portion of us would have destroyed god pallet off principle. This Legion let it happen.
---
How can you be frustadet by t bagging?It doesn't effect the gameplay.
---
I always upvote the person I’m debating because they’re making point and people should see those points
---
Oh yes, that Fortnite clone. I don't play Fortnite.
---
/s
---
Decisive strike.
---
Yea exactly that. Meaning the killer had to go out of his way to keep me alive and escaped. True legend
---
Hopefully the "tweaks" are buffs because he is just a weaker hillbilly right now
---
Yeah that happens to me a lot. I’ve gotten sandbagged and left on the hook too many times to count. Even had someone tell me to die already cause they found the hatch :p the DbD community isn’t toxic compared to other communities, but some of the people who play are aggravating sometimes
---
You say that but 20 queued minutes later you'd be ready to uninstall if that was the norm.
---
Different people are frustrated by different things. Not everyone’s the same when it comes to games.
---
Im on console aswell, I know the feeling, it just feels nuts, I hope they make some kind of change soon
---

---
Remember, just the death hook of survivors matters for the tome challenge. Run Agitation and Ig and take survivors to normal hooks closer the basement, but only on death hook should you commit to the basement.
---
I thought it was clear from the start. Your own fault being sensititve. The hell do you think im doing then? Poking fun at you for shits and giggles?
---
i wonder if you could drop a survivor in there... hehehe
---
Prepare to be run around windows for years once survivors learn you have this perk. Try mind gaming them or run Brutal Strength.
---
But it doesn't do anything that would be as if I would be frustrated at seing people breath outside
---
It's funny because three of these were nerfed.
---
Okay
---
Oh what a shame lol
---
What if you have 2 or more survivors in the basement and an overly altruistic group of survivors?
---
I've been on both ends, never really held it against anyone since it seems like a smart play to stay nearby.
---
you seem to be pretty mad for being an ass to other people lol
---
Look I’m not even saying we shouldn’t do it. Im not knowledgeable regarding colorblindness I’m just saying we shouldn’t be harassing BHVR to do things and not even consider the fact that there is an entirely different argument we aren’t even talking about. Not one other person in this entire post is talking about the fact that there is an entire argument against making a hasty change, and they should talk about it, don’t get me wrong. They probably have a lot more to worry about than a couple hundred/thousand people out of hundreds of thousands not being able to see scratchmarks. And when you say there’s no way they could fuck up changing the color of something, I will respectfully disagree, I remember the Claudette cosmetic that prevented hags traps from popping. I still really wish I could see the code that caused that. I’m not even saying the fact that they are going to accidentally fuck something up is a problem. I’m saying it may not be all that easy to implement this in a balanced manner. And being able to see blood marks better and for a longer time is not a slight change. That could be huge change.
---
Oh no, are we going to get everyone posting images of fog since that meme got to the front page?
---
It's a game so most killers are fine. 
---
Ghostboi can spook me on a bad day.
---
Mikey makes me scared to turn my computer on.
---
Same, at that point it’s just them admiring defeat and it should just be ignored imo
---
Op could have graped the claudet
---
I think that Legion is more buffed than nerfed
---
Derank and go play some rank 20's and then come back and revisit this sorry excuse for a shitpost.  It isn't remotely true.  Worse than that though it isn't smart or funny.  This is another perfect example of an empty calory non-post to farm Karma and they are just bursting out the seams of this sub.  Can we raise the bar around here at some point because these posts are lame as shit.
---
Dweet and Sbeve
---
Basically what u/Lampkin1978 said: It takes no effort to put mystery boxes on the Bloodweb and give us firecrackers. But instead we get a shitty battlepass and more ugly skins that no one's going to buy.
---
What, how? We don't see the last gen pop? None of them had adrenaline for all we know
---
r/lostlostredditors
---
What other maps have unique things like the bell ding?
---
And get 4k'd cause you're not doing gens. Sounds like a plan
---
It comes across like you alt f4'd to disconnect during the match.
---
Your useless idea its obviously unnecesary, the game is asymmetrical its a 1v4, the survivors dont like what the killer is doing and the killer doesnt like what the survivors are doing its not rocket science. Most of the time the survivors will just vote for the guy that distracted the killer the most increasing their ego to new hights, hell your idea might just breed a new type of toxic survivor.
---
It works on OW because its an equal number of pvp and because its equal the one that does the most is obviously highly praised since in an equal footing they kicked ass. 
---
Btw your response to receiving negative feedback to your post (deleting your post) shows how immature you are. Grow up a little before posting something on the internet, i guess. But we all know you wont do that because you know better right bud?

New Legion rework literally just turns them into trapper
---
Yeah ok lol! Think whatever you want.
---
Thank you for your comment, but you are incorrect. Try harder. Love, nobody.
---
Me too but I beat it before archive 4 came out
---
It's why I try to stay out of discussions about NOED. The side that's like Nerf NOED won't admit they're wrong when they never try anything to counter it. Same with the ones about camping. I understand if they complain about it before a gen gets popped (it's annoying but not uncounterable), but if they complain about it when the gates are powered when the killer hasn't gotten any kills, they're the ones that are wrong.

I’d say, 900 hours in, yellow rank play can very often resemble red rank play. Not tan, but yellow for sure. Sometimes you’ll get big brains or toxic god loopers at yellow, sometimes you’ll get people crouching in a corner all match at red. It’s less indication of skill level than it is playtime in a month.
---
It's December 2019.  Who the fuck is still D'Cing against Legion?
---
Bruv, you gotta love! Why fight toxicity with toxicity! Now it wasn’t right for him to start it, but it was even worse for you to finish it in cold blood! You are no better than he is! For shame!
---
Killer ranks in general need to be seriously looked at. I find it strange that the game cares about anything except kills in terms of ranking. 
---
For survivors it makes sense, just escaping the trial doesn't make you a good survivor, you have to contribute to the team. 
---
But the killer has no team, their only goal is to kill. It's kind of ridiculous you can't pip for 3 and 4ks. Every other category they rank you on doesn't matter, they are only tools to help you kill.
---
Wow big brain lol basically it lowkey feels like they will do something like this in the future

The two a-holes that went against me yesterday, apparently. I think I frenzied once the whole match.
---
Spirit fury?
---
I just vault over them and break them with my fat ass Julie, with that ultra rare add-on. XD
---
*There are situations where it is a viable tactic*
---
I said that right in my comment. If you know the survivors are altruistic and are swarming the basemeny, then of course you're going to camp.
---
That’d make sense.

From The Witcher tv series, just released on Netflix very recently.

The question I always ask about Legion is who asked for Deep Wounds. I mean who asked for Deep Wounds as a whole but:
---
* Who asked for Deep Wounds to have the same effect as Borrowed Time?
---
* Who asked for Deep Wounds to not go down while in a chase.
---
* Who asked for Deep Wounds *to* go down while in a chase. (Release Legion)
---
* Who asked for Deep Wounds' mending time to be decreased.
---
* Who asked for Deep Wounds to not go down while Sprinting?
---
Before the rework I think Deep Wounds was in the best state it has ever been in, which is hardly saying it was good to begin with. Having it based on the Terror Radius was fine and I think a slight decrease to the Mend time or a slight decrease to Legion's power recharge on chain stabs would've made the debuff more-or-less fine. But now the debuff is a complete joke and there isn't any reason to chain stab, and at that point why play Legion over Hillbilly? Deep Wounds is such a non-threat not only is is *possible* to do gens through it, its **preferred** since Legion can't run over to stab you again if you mend fully.
---
There's still every other problem with Legion but Behavior is trying too hard to balance Deep Wounds around two vastly different mechanics (Borrowed Time and a Killer's core ability) which should've never shared abilities to begin with.
---
Can you explain this in a way someone who failed Year 10 maths can understand
---
No killer does it when I play survivor but today a survivor did it I just loaded my chainsaw then he tried to safe and  I just kill him
---
The dead hard nerf is nice but other exhaustion perks are still a problem. Survivors should gain the exhausted status effect as soon as they start start running because we know except for meg none of them were in very good shape. 
---
Edit: I forgot david
---
Flamingo/bright pink shirt ace with the pink goggles. Or jane with skeleton face and a pink sweater
---
I agree man. I wish I had reacted better.
---
Doubt it. You can't even get close to the gate in the room. There's collision on the bodies and everything else.
---
Jeff because the way his hair flows is beautiful
---
I mean Ghostface's daily is a complete fucking joke and you still get dailies for characters you have at level 1. Honestly I treat any dailies of that sort as a "come back tomorrow for two dailies! :)" daily.
---
Im legit just pebbling ppl with diversion
---
He isn't underatted he is just small
---
Dude I understand the playtime argument and it is partially true but overall apples to apples pick 10 yellow rank players and compare them to 10 red rank players and the differences are often night and day. 
---
Yellow rank survivors can't loop, they can barely hit skill checks, they definitely can't work through Ruin checks.  They overuse immersion to comic effects and waste pallets while not ever looking behind them.
---
Yellow rank killers on the other hand can't counterplay looping at all.  They don't mindgame anything.  They rarely pressure gens.  And they often just rely on a NOED proc.
---
If there is any doubt of the difference "on average" between red and yellow rank players take the Pepsi challenge.  Go derank and see them for yourself.  I did  when I was going achievement hunting for the harder ones a few months back and I felt absolutely fucking awful every game.  It was like Tyson fighting an Infant.  These dudes were all defenseless on both sides.
---
[do u even know what just happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ddj6nv/guide_hitbox/)
---
Things like Omega Blink were all that needed changing. I get the whole "Nurse can't be escaped easily" problem but that's really tied more to map generation than Nurse herself.
---
I think the rework was good in principle but it was executed terribly.
---
It's still RNG, bullshit RNG, but RNG. It took me 4 games to do that challenge and I only found one purple key in total and I used plunderer's instinct and ace in the hole in all of those trials
---
The defence against nurse is to play unpredictably and always try to break LoS with her to make her make mistakes: she missed a blink -&gt; gain distance -&gt; repeat until dead/escaped. She has no direct defences which makes her strong and interesting to go against. Sadly, many kids here cannot have fun if they have to sweat and use some braincells instead of pressing x to win
---
Like I kinda got the DC'a against Original Legion running Frank's but that was many reworks ago and he has since lost all his cheese.  He's just another killer at this point.
---
You know what's worse? 
---
Playing on switch in handheld against legion on yamaoka maps and getting hit with his make screen even darker bs attack.
---
But yes, after some patch they became dark af.
---
so basically they took the Oni on console that was shit in his power and put him on all systems he is now stupidly unfun
---
Mate, it's a meme about the ranking system in matches. Red ranks often see green or purple or even white sometimes. Just chill lol
---
And that’s perfectly fine, if you don’t wanna finish every challenge. You don’t have to. I totally get that some of the later challenges are tough. Hell, I was going to ignore a few of them as well, but I ended up giving the toughest ones a shot and ended up completing them all. Sometimes it takes a lot of games. Would you believe I did the Dark Sense challenge on my first try? But Iridescent Emblem one was a long grind, and the flashlight blinds took way longer than I’d care to admit, haha.
---
But I do think that the point of the Tome was that each level would increase in difficulty (or at least increase the time spent to accomplish each one).  
---
I don’t think it’s that hard to get to level 70 of the rift, as long as you started playing when the rift came out. Jumping into it in mid December would be nearly impossible to complete with such a short time frame. But personally, I got to level 70 before the last set of challenges were even released. 
---
Are there specific challenges you think are so difficult that they need to be heavily adjusted?
---
I always love when the .ttv bitches in post game chat about me not following the imaginary Survivor rules and then when I take a peek at their stream it's some middle schooler with 3 viewers recording himself on a laptop and staring completely expressionlessly at the screen say for the occasional "SHIT" and "DAMMIT" when they mess up an easy play. :P
---
I think the new one is amazing. The braids and those huge earrings.. very chic and stylish! But yeah, most of her others suck
---
At first I didn't notice that the meg was fat
---
Then balance the damn game around comms. It's not that hard. SWF have comms, Solo do not have comms. If you balance around Solo SWF become OP. If you balance around SWF Solo becomes really underpowered. 
---
Now we give Solo comms. Now we can balance around comms. It's not that hard of a concept.
---
Hope you people keep linking that post in every single post about HiTbOxEs CoMpLaInTs

It just does that sometimes, nothing to be worried about. You said you’re new? Hit me up if you need help or advice.

This. I've always said that if you need to essentially sell out your own body for views than you're not good enough to get those views normally.

It's the Raid Shadow Legends / Mafia City paradox. When you're that desperate for advertising chances are that your product is hot garbage and unable to gain publicity through word of mouth.

I used to run NOED all the time because I didn’t have any other perks but it could be used in some meme hex builds to surprise survs other than that noed is pretty much a beginner perk
---
I think that everyone can agree with me when I say that legion is one of the worst killers in the game but one of the most fun killers to play
---
The Game map has blocked doors that open when the nearby gen is completed too (which helps in a quick escape from the killer)
---
im a dumb noob is there a bell in the auto haven store you can ring?
---
Oni is fine just takes a lot more practice
---
In scenarios like these where a killer steamrolls through my team and they die quick af or DC, I always try and give the killer a hint to farm. Quick games don’t benefit anyone with this current system 🤷🏻‍♂️ Sadly the killers I play against don’t care and still end the game fast, leaving with a depip most likely and low BP.
---
That’s the new entity abduction beam
---
I swear whenever I see a competent survivor its always either ace, kate or david. Everyone else is potatoe.
---
Yeah I forgot that Lucky Break makes Head On much better, HO has just as much potential as Lithe. I'd say Dead Hard does too, but that's more to make your injured state much stronger (Resilience, Iron Will, Lucky Break).
---
Good
---
I can't count the amount of 5 viewer Twitch Streamers I've played against who never look behind themselves in a chase, prethrow every pallet, three-gen themselves, and go "UGHHHHHHHHH KILLER OP BHVR SO SURVIVOR SIDED" and bitch and moan all match instead of learning from their mistakes.
---
That being said I have played against Int3r4ct (a content creator I greatly respect) a few times and while he's not *great* I always enjoy knowing that I played against him and watching his stream after the fact. He admits when he makes mistakes and respects good plays from the Survivors.
---
I also played against Zubat's Huntress once and that was a fun game lol. Azerov's Resting Place (*really* good Huntress map) and my teammates were complete fucking potatoes. 1 minute in 2 people slugged I'm injured and the last person is desperately trying to pick the slugs up.

It's a lot of fun and it can help with mori dailies, but competetively it's not very good. If you only want the strongest perks, it's not worth it.

There's to ways to fuck over a killer who brings NOED: 
---
1. Cleanse dulls whenever you can (bad idea on inside maps)
---
2. If the person that got NOEDed isn't dead on hook, go around the map real fast to find the NOED totem.
---
Ive been playing mostly survivor for a long time and wanted to start playing as killer, but its pretty hard to learn how to play properly with this crappy matchmaking.
---
M8 I make shitposts because I think it's funny and I want to share it with people that think it's funny too. If you don't like it, I'm cool with that. Downvote or comment "Not funny, didn't laugh".

Such Clowns. lol

Pig's fucked traps dont work after the EGC begins since they only activate AFTER a gen is done and since they arent active they can walk past the exit gate with the trap on
---
Legion's Fucked (well kinda, his power doesnt count as an M1 hit so it doesnt stack STBFL but the speed buff is nice)
---
Oni was good but it got nerfed kinda annoying to not get the hits because of his nerfed rotation
---
 Nurse got nerfed but...its nurse hell i think they put an even more powerful omega blink nurse in the game, 
---
Spirit got nerfed, i dont notice much of a difference with her since i dont use her much.
---
Doc is next on the chopping block
---
Considering this would work with nearly any pallet and completely fucks legions ability I'd say yes, yes it is.
---
Had the same thing happen except it was ghostface..
---
But then its a swf and everyone starts bodyblocking
---
I always try to raise this issue up with BHVR employees when I spot them in Twitch chat. The only one to respond to me about this is Jeff. He said that it's something they'd "like to do", but there's no ETA on it. It's good I got some sort of answer but it doesn't seem like it'd be hard for them to switch dark red auras and scratches and Oni blood orbs with dark blue hues instead.
---
Old Prayer Beads?
---
The intelligent point is that ranking is broken and pointless. Even at red ranks you‘ll still somehow queue into purple, green, yellow or tan ranks. It doesn’t matter if you’re playing killer or survivor, it’ll still happen.
---
It’s funny because it’s true.
---
Yeah idk if you can tell the difference but this is clearly not an issue with hitboxes. It's an issue with the server/lag.
---
BHVR probably broke it
---
I feel that. I hope that gets tidied up soon
---
Pretty good job so far
---
tbh I see why people are downvoting you but you're right. The problem with Nurse is not that Nurse was OP, but that (certain) Nurse *addons* (namely Omega Blink and Omni Blink) were OP, which was the main point of the rework. But her rework also tanked her base kit for no reason and made her overly addon reliant, which was one of Nurse's saving graces. Add in the fact that Nurse probably has some of the most meme addons out of any Killer in the game between Bloodpoint meme addons (White Nit Comb, Dull Bracelet), Bloodpoint meme addons that sort of doing something (Anxious Gasp), and general meme addons (Spasmodic Breath, Jenner's Last Breath ["Cheers love!"], Campbell's Last Breath, and both her pink addons) Nurse is in a really bad place.
---
The biggest problem with Nurse is that they still didn't fix all of her technical mishaps that kept her from completely destroying the game. Don't get me wrong: if you had a high enough skill cap you could destroy the game as Nurse but the amount of work required to do so now is just not worth it. Nurse went from Overwatch Season 1 McCree (an unstoppable juggernaut who literally couldn't be stopped if the player was good enough) to post-nerf McCree (a character who can still get work done but requires far too much work and is way too inconsistent compared to his / her other options.)
---
Right? Like what do they gain from that besides knowing they’re ruining the game for a fellow player? They are willing to take a dc ban and not get any bp just to be a jerk.
---
No it just switched on Christmas

No mither+sc+adrinal+unbreakable: Pathetic
---
Whats sc?
---
no just the nudes, and some of a few other people too. I wouldn't recommend wanting to look at them though unless you want a visit from the FBI.
---
Self care
---
They should make deep wound the wound work how it used to (based on terror radiu) so you can't run across the map without mending and that way you actually have to worry about your timer going down when you're not near the killer. The only reason to chain stab right now is if you use the Forever Legion build.
---
The answer to all of the above (excluding question #3) is survivors.
---
He was given the build to use the add-ons. He even said they were strong. Sabo squads is just an opinion. You might like them, others dislike.
---
I don't care what anyone says, noed is god tier to me because I get revenge on toxic cunts.
---
It’s one thing to msg someone if ur mad, but bragging? Too much
---
If a survivor is able to vault a pallet 3 times without being hit, then you're not doing well. Break. The. Pallet.
---
ugly and overpriced. deadly combo.
---
Makes you dead weight to the team for the entire duration
---
This is why we cleanse bones and for the extra points
---
Why do you think so?
---
That's the magic beam that creates 276 posts on reddit asking what it is.
---
Not all the time though. Otz is a top, top player.
---
I forgot to mention obviously no swf in swf sc is realy shit
---
I’m alright with like a simple gg or something but saying it was easy or something like it is a little much
---
They should change that daily to "Mark 4 survivors" so people actually want to do it.
---
Hey, I'm glad that u love the game. Remember not to listen to the sea of toxic players that floods the sub and keep on playing :)
---
Because you’re not doing any gens or looping the killer. Dead weight.
---
The nerf to Freddy's rope addons shows that Behavior has no idea how to fix their game. The problem with Forever Freddy was never his rope addons: it's a fundamental problem with Freddy and his interaction with generators.
---
I'm still seeing people who run Forever Freddy (sometimes with Ropes or Swing Chains, sometimes with new stuff like the Dress addons) and they still stall the game out for 60 years before winning by default. The problem is with the lack of counterplay to Freddy's teleport (yes you can hide but you can't stop him from kicking the gen) and the interaction with perks like Surveillance and Pop Goes the Weasel.
---
I realize I went on a quick tangent about Freddy but my point is that whenever addons are a problem the devs rarely know what to *actually* do with them. And they rarely know how to tackle problems in the first place.
---
Baws
---
Why the "nobody"?
---
Yeah, especially if you were looped, flashlighted, gen rushed, whatever and they call u bad
---
Calm down Spirit mains, it was just a joke. Bruh is every killer main a serious guy?
---
Because in my experience, from both sides, most chases end in a down and a hook. When you get rescued off a hook you have a teammate to heal you and so it’s not needed.
---
If you manage to actually lose the Killer then working on gens is a priority. You’re also likely to run into a teammate on a gen who can heal you.
---
But it takes like 15-20 seconds only and then you can start doing things and that's so much better then needing an teamate to heal you and than if a teamate heals you you both canwdo anything
---
Yes and no. A line in the dirt at the gas station where when you walk over it, it dings
---
Doesn’t matter if it affects gameplay, it’s unwarranted hate, like Hitler hating Jews (little extreme but u get my point)
---
You're losing your shit over a game that will never be an esport. Just chill
---
Memes m8
---
I was getting red ranks every other match when I was an r20 killer. Matching is just kinda screwed rn.
---
oh cool, ill have to look for that next time i get auto haven!
---
I always let the boopers live, pig and ghost face are my mains lol. 
---
unless they’ve been an asshat, then I kill them if I can
---
Always when I play the survivor that unhooked me runs away I never see over survivors and I often win chases but fair points
---
Or you could just stay injured and go do a gen and have adrenaline pop and save all of that time
---
I heard they’re running iron maiden
---
Well of course, I don't like something in the game it's clearly because the game designers are big dumb dumb brains and should just not be dumb dumbs and do what I want. /s
---
But seriously, it's sad that Oni comes out, was insanely strong in competent hands, received praise for being fun to play, but they tried to balance it (and only by decreasing the turn value) so it feels more fair to survivors, and suddenly the developers are doodoo again.
---
The bias is too volatile on whether people are happy or not with any particular change. Want to know how they are good game designers? You are still playing their game, and care so much about what happens to the game.
---
Tomes 1 and 2 were ok overall, but I'd honestly get rid of all the "do this in a single match" challenges. I'd also make more than one challenge selectable and giving more fragments. Matches should overall also give more exp and emblems should count a lot more.
---
But its not the killer that will benefit from wasting time. I see how you can just camp but that achieves nothing for the killer and allows for gens to be done from the process. Time is on the survivor side, so camping can just hurt the killer. It doesn’t matter if the survivors are slower at doing gens if there’s nothing to pressure them.
---
That's not really an answer
---
I'm not "losing my shit".  Just calling out the oversaturation of lazy memes and shitposts on here.  At least find a different template that's unique or something even if you have nothing to say.  This sub is crammed to the gills with useless shitposts and memes it makes you forget there are occasionally topics related to discussion or advice about the game.
---
Hello yes I would like you to tell that to me in games where I don’t even find the fucking survivors then get gen rushed because its a SWF that all brought BNP and self care against my pig/legion playing ass
---
I get ur point but he's realy getting frustrated by it  and they don't say anything there are just like ha bad killer I would understand to say it's annoying but not frustrating
---
Obligatory "devs showed us ~~biased~~ stats that say Killers have a 50% kill rate so the game is fine!" comment.

Well it’s not a “big deal” I guess, but if someone doesn’t do anything to solicit hate, you’re gonna reevaluate yourself and be like “did I do something to deserve this?” When u didn’t, just people being dicks
---
It's a waste of time. Selfcaring takes roughly 24 seconds, and the debuff from sloppy butcher adds 8 seconds, making it 32.
---
The problem I experience most is not the perk itself, but the players that run it. I got we'll make it+medkit and get you off the hook, and you run to the nearest corner and start self-caring, fuck these people. This was before archive challenges existed, so you're just being a twat.
---
It also denies points for teammates, hence why sc is sometimes affectionately called "selfish care". And with inner strength, the changes to medkits, as well as bond, aftercare, empathy being more worthwhile options, it amazes me that I have seen people still classify selfcare as "meta".
---
Being one shot is realy a big deal and going for adrenaline is only good if there is only 1 gen left or 2 gens left and one of them is  getting repaired from a teamate
---
Ace by a mile.  He has this look of pure unfiltered sleaze  I find very humorous.  Also you can use cosmetics to make him look like such an asshole.  Probably the most frustrating toon to get looped by.  He just looks so damn smug on every drop.
---
Should at least try, it’s worth a shot rather than wiggling and having a slight chance of escaping anyways
---
UP !
---
I played against a swf ttv stack and when I watched the game from their perspective I was accused of cheating at one point lol. I was even playing Legion
---
Feng min is smart to play first because technician helps you learn skillchecks, if you miss a skillcheck entirely it has a chance to not give the killer a notification of it being messed up. Alert tells you who and where the killer is whenever they kick a pallet or generator. Lithe is an exhaustion perk that can be used when fast vaulting any pallet or window which every single map has.
---
If you level Bill you get a perk called Borrowed Time, which allows you to unhook someone in the killers terror radius and give them an instance of being hit without going down, smart people you unhook can bodyblock the killer from hitting you with it.
---
David has Dead Hard which is an exhaustion perk that is a short range dash that makes you invulnerable during the dash. He also has We're gonna live forever which at max rank when you get 4 safe unhooks or protection hits (bodyblocking a hit from the killer on someone or bodyblocking a hook when the killer is attempting to put someone on it) this also combos well with borrowed time because if they get hit during the effect of borrowed time it'll still give you a safe unhook unless they get hit twice and downed.
---
Dwight has 2 useful perks Prove Thyself and Bond. Prove Thyself makes you earn co-op gen points faster and makes gens when working with someone else 10% faster. Bond tells you where teammates are when they're within 36 meters of you so if they're being chased you know where not to be or if you're being chased to know where not to bring the killer.
---
Claudette has 3 useful perks but one is frowned upon. Self care lets you heal yourself without a medkit but it's at half he speed you'd do it with a medkit. Botony knowledge at max rank makes you heal 33% faster (works with self care). Empathy at max rank lets you see injured players from 128 meters away, which will tell you where not to be if they're being chased or tell you where someone's injured that you can heal.
---
Jake has Iron will which makes your sounds of pain when injured non-existent at max rank (unless the killer uses a perk called stridor which makes pain sounds louder)
---
Meg has Sprint burst, Quick &amp; quiet and Adrenaline. Sprint burst is an exhaustion perk that activates when you sprint which gives you a burst of speed. Quick &amp; quiet makes vaulting windows or entering lockers while sprinting silent, but it has a cooldown after activation. Adrenaline, when all the generators are done or the killer closes the hatch to start the end game collapse you get healed a health state and get a burst of speed for 5 seconds but it gives you the exhaustion status effect just like other perks of this type. Exhaustion makes it so ypu can't use exhaustion perks.
---
But my pc used to be my microwave :(
---
I can not count the amount of games I've "gotten a 4k" in as Clown, Doctor, Pig, and Legion where one person lead me to the other Survivors, another person ragequit, a third person DCed at the start of the match, and the fourth was essentially 1v2ing me and the troll Survivor.
---
And yet I don't see anyone saying that Clown, Doctor, Pig, and Legion are top tier Killers. Hmmmmmmmmm...  
---
Maybe it's because no sane person would consider stats from troll matches, unless they were specifically trying to skew data to look good? Hmmmmmmmmm...
---
This was like a day ago, and I don't follow the updates very heavily but I don't think that nerf happened that recently.
---
You forgot the incredibly loud murder of crows on Pale Rose.
---
You ever been scared so bad you orgasmed?
---
think? sitting in a corner for 20+ seconds is a heavy waste of time ur wasting around 25% of a gen just to heal 1 health stage I would much rather slap on IW and Recilliance and just stay injured with a 9% booster
---
What? You can hear nancy unhooking claud and she was healed instantly, and she had a speed boost coming out of the basement
---
As a killer, I encourage this. If someone facecamps you without reason, you have the right to do so. Just hate when I didn’t do anything and someone does that
---
As a pig main I am appalled by the behavior of my kin, but perhaps she thought you were toxic sitting on the hatch?
---
Ok you're point with people using it wrong ok thats a point but denying points for teamates and the first point it's much better to heal yourself then searching a teamate because being one shot is a big deal and you often only find teamates in a time where you could have healed yourself with sc and just doing something while injured is stupid cause being injured is realy a big deal.
---
BOOMER ACE
---
I didn't know where the killer was until it was way too late.
---
I've played against Runningman and his chat remembers that I've BMed him for the luls and has him bring moris when I have a display name that they recognize. 
---
I've played against Noob3 and he didn't complain even if I brought NOED.
---
I've played against Kittychipz and got her and her swf to DC. I slugged them to death that match.
---
I've played against Jendenise and she complained the wholeee time.
---
I was survivor and got in a lobby against StreamDad_ (looked at recent players and saw his name) so I decided to confuse him. He was really confused that I was running into walls and staring at him whenever he was coming to me. It was pretty funny.
---
Every other streamer I've played against I forgot how the game went.
---
Some outfits are way too expensive. Over twice the cost of buying a killer itself? Jeez.
---
The reason they changed it was Nemesis and literally just Nemesis. (And also Freddy) But because Behavior can't fix one (*two) niche cases they instead had to gut Legion entirely because go fuck yourself.
---
I like this build too but I've started mostly running it without Quick and Quiet. Usually the killer is going to see you vault the window anyways so it's not super useful to take away the sound as well. Let's me rotate two perks to whatever else I'm trying to do instead of one.
---
Nah sprint boost only holds 3 seconds and "if he can catch me" then you need to start running after you're a little bit in his terror radius or you're screwed even with sprint burst and sometimes you get realy bad maps or are at a very bad location and can't find windows/pallets.
---
Typical entitled billy main. Pick “teh most balanced killer”, instasaw, ruin and noed and expect the ez 4k. Cry if you get anythinng that stands in your way.
---
Hawkins is the most killer sided map according to the stats released last month. Most of the pallets are unsafe and survivors often struggle to find gens. While Billy might not be able to make the most of his mobility its still an extremely easy map for killer and even M1’ing should win the game.
---
Well said. Oni has many things on Billy and is still really good. Besides, with Q and E you can still curve 90 degrees
---
They did, until they made the menu available in kyf/custom games while you were starting a game. So either it's a custom game or they found a way to break public games again
---
They had decisive, they woulda been fine
---
I made a post just how fucking bright that skin is [if ur curious how fucking bright he is](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/drf1yj/if_anyone_was_interested_in_seeing_just_how/)
---
&gt;If you can't 4k regularly you're bad.
---
&gt;The game isn't supposed to be easy. (IE You're not supposed to 4k every game)
---
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/confused-nick-young
---
Ayeee
---
I read them you don't have points against them.  It's just you saying yeah but 1 shot...
---
I gave you very detailed highly specific examples of why Self Care is putrid even citing meta perk shifts and trends.  I showed my math.  The membership of your Self Care Gamer club is dwindling.  Community support has rightly been turning on that dumpster fire of a perk for a while now.  It becomes a little less popular every month.
---
The map is very survivor sided, but it is doable.
---
Quality post cause ricardo
---
Not possible. People on here assured me this doesn’t happen. You must just be a filthy disconnecter!
---
Cant wait until they bring in d/c penalties and these kind of people are punished for leaving.
---
Indoor maps are sure tougher for Billy than wide open maps, but they are certainly winnable. I got my adept billy achievement on Hawkins.
---
i got a swf and this nancy with all crutch perks (including d strike) and an insta heal msgs me saying “baby killer ran for 5 gens” when i’m a rank 10 playing ghost face without any of his really good add ons like chewed pen. they were all red ranks except for 1 and i just laughed to myself when i facecamped his teabagging self.
---
Why the fuck would I disconnect if I was about to win a game with 4 kills? Make it make sense
---
sloppy is meta
---
"Admiring" righhhhhhhht. Sure. Dont worry man, I can relate
---
You're only argument whas "back then it was better" and?
---
...I am a survivor main.  Also, those are stats from 8 months ago, and other m1 killers actually have useful abilities on that map...
---
Oh god, imagine a body horror doppelgänger in the game like The Thing who can hide his terror radius and stain. Takes them 15 seconds of stalking a survivor to take on their appearance, and attacking transforms them into a horrific looking amalgam of the Thing and the Survivor they were.
---
That's how it's been for me too, I'm a rank 10 killer going against mostly red ranks :/ I do appreciate how some survivors are sympathetic and apologize for matchmaking afterwards even though it's not their fault. You guys are cool
---
Dude that always happens when it’s quiet, the very sudden noise will instantly make me turn the camera, like, “WHO’S THERE?”
---
David cus he’s daddy af 👅👅
---
Nobody used it even if it's meta and I already explai ed why it wouldn't change much for sc
---
I like Legion the way he is now that I've actually played as him.
---
Was thinking about it but didn’t go the extra mile
---
It can still be mandatory depending on the survivors you’re put with. Better to self-care in the corner to preserve yourself than run around at risk of being taken out of the game because somebody only wanted to farm you for points and has no intention of ever healing you no matter how much you indicate to them you’d like to be healed.
---
Nothing happened because, for every person who suggests they nerf them, there's 4 survivor mains standing by to call then a salty killer main.
---
They should like with balance landing, but with the difference that u can do fast vault
---
Objectively nurse is the best killer in the game still. She can ignore every one of the survivor's defenses with ease. The nerfs only made instantly double blinking after a double blink harder. Everything that actually made her good was unchanged. If you're not good with the nurse, I can see why you'd think the nerfs are unnecessary. But good nurse players aren't affected by these nerfs that much at all. 
---
There is no counter for a good nurse. Nurse is one of the only killers that does not rely on survivor mistakes to succeed. And if anything, I loved the addon changes. Back in the day there were like 3 OP addons and 1 usable one, with the rest being absolute dogshit. The reworked addons bring a lot more variety to her kit, and imo, she is better than what she was before because of it (Also nice not to have all survivors DC when they hear the nurse scream).
---
Also, small question, what survivor rank are you? If you face a lot of weak nurses that were easy to play against, it might have been because bad nurses are really easy to juke. 
---
What it really boils down to is this: Good nurses are the strongest killer in the game, and bad nurses are the weakest.
---
I don't think so. I was in full health and the last person was dying on hatch so it wasn't open. She knew where it was, and while it was still closed, came and hit me.
---
Then it opened, and she crouched, so I thought she wanted a Boop. So I Booped, didn't jump into the hatch so I could Boop, then she closed it and killed me.
---
Betrayal. :(
---
It's almost as if they were too much to handle. Nurse could literally just get rid of any safe pallets or rooms with a single blink, spirit literally just got addons changes and can now not bump into people when phasing which should've been in the game from the start. And the whole vault animation thing for her idk what tell you yeah it was hard to counter play but if you dont trust the spirit then just walk away. And who else was nerfed?
---
Not to pick a side, but to just point out, Hawkins has only been out since September and that isn’t 8 months ago...
---
Yeah hate when people do that, to quote Castro from bo1, “And why, is he here? You lost!”
---
I contributed to the memeing but I exist unaligned with "To wiggle or not to wiggle". Both are valid. Play the game and have a wholesome time :)
---
You clearly didn't read anything if that's all you saw.  I'm not going to waste my time if you aren't even gonna try.  If you're looking for an Echo Chamber to agree with you I can't help you with that.  You asked a question so I gave you an accurate and honest answer.
---
The reason survivors expect it is because of all the crybabies on here who make their stupid HURR DURR posts about how “I was going to give hatch BUT DEN DEY WIGGLES!!”
---
So people dont wiggle because they expect someone to throw a hissy fit because THEY didnt get to walk the survivor to the hatch, proving they have authority and power of life and death over them and fluffing up their ego.
---

---
Yeah there’s a difference between a 4k every match and doing it at least SEMI regularly, which is actually what I said. My point was that you don’t need exploits to 4k unless you’re a trash player.
---
Could have at least taken a hit and made some distance with the boost
---
I have a feeling Tapp would leave this guy on hook
---
This exact thing happens to me when I play killer AND survivor. Internet is fine, connected with ethernet cord, but I still get kicked. I feel so bad too! Bc it not only screws me over, but everyone else. I wanna tell the other players it's not my fault lol
---
Self care is inefficient, it takes 32 seconds to heal and much longer w/ sloppy and thana. That's half a generator, just for you to heal one health state. If you're worried about being a constant one shot, throw on bond to find team mates to heal you. Or dead hard which activates when you're injured.
---
Oh boo hoo.
---
As survivor I get shafted too and I still get sad twats that slug for the 4k after two other survivors disconnect. How am I meant to pip in those games?
---
Suck it up. The survivors who get left behind are more robbed than you are
---
This Lmao and more often times than not they just think you disconnected cause you’re salty and if you try to explain yourself that’ll only make you look more sus 😭
---
That Auto Haven bell was actually suggested by the community and then the devs added it to the map.
---
If your on pc, no as dc penalty’s are a thing on pc.
---
Yeah, I'm debating taking Q&amp;Q off, but sometimes I'll stick Head On as the fourth perk and WOO BOY is that one a fun time. Instant hiding spot and if they find me? Apply directly to the killer.
---
I already said something against you're points in other comments
---
Imagine needing to heal someone to see their aura.
---
This comment was made by the empathy gang.
---
Ash, Bill, Laurie, Tapp, Steve, Quintin
---
Is it still the case?
---
32 seconds or 40 if the killer has sloppy.
---
In 2018/early 2019 I would have agreed with you.
---
Past few months though? Seems the majority of toxic shits have moved to playing killer.
---
Yeah I love doing random antics when I’m playing solo
---
Oni lasted a week before getting nerfed
---
Well it seems like you have most of or all the meta perks already. Deliverance is pretty decent and Pebble is fun so I'd recommend Adam. And then other than that, just whatever perks look fun to you really.
---
Don't forget that they all look ridiculous too.
---
"Oh no it's the big scary killer, with his BBQ sauce bandolier." - Nea Karlsson, probably
---
Yes... you’re taking away games for others. Just push through it. I remember getting a 4k on Lerys the first time I played Billy on there... m1 pretty much the whole time.
---
We would all be better to forget fire up, that perk is trash
---
Its sarcasm durr
---
Based on the fact people on here screamed up and down that disconnects flat out do NOT happen, and that anyone that left the game is lying and should be punished by a 10 minute timeout. Or they claimed they had shit internet and didnt deserve to play
---
For what its worth every couple of games now I see a survivor get kicked from the game
---
Oh...
---
Lmfao deadass tho. Would have been hilarious to see the escaped symbol as he turned away
---
Yes and I also replied to the points you made in my comment
---
Idk man.. idk what the problem is but I hope it gets fixed
---
Those stats are not from 8 months ago
---
yea that is almost fucking 50% of a gen wasted
---
This map is deadliest one according to last stats Devs posted. You can just go for M1 hits since most of pallets are unsafe. 
---
I saw so many coward Billies who just DC on Haddonfield, Lery's, Hawkins. All you lose is your mobility, but other M1 Killers are doing perfectly fine without it there. You still can oneshot ppl.
---
I dont see any reasons to DC on those maps (or any map) whatsoever. Since following your logic any M1 Killer should just DC on maps like Rotten Fields, Mother's Dwelling, etc, cause travel time from gen to gen is just ridiculous for them.
---
its a high risk high reward perk
---
high risk being someone deletes ur totem 1 minute in and youre down a perk for the rest of the game 
---
high reward being a 4 man mori
---
Damn.. that’s just awful. I don’t blame him but every now and then you can get a fun game.
---
And the bamboo
---
What are you talking about?  That's probably the most killer sided map in the game.  Unsafe pallets check, Difficult to find gens check, difficult to find totems check.  Even the strong areas in that map are still very open to mindgames.  I agree the map isn't Billy friendly at all but killers as a whole clean up on that map.
---
Oof, outplayed son.
---
fr? that’s cool
---
Doesn’t mean there aren’t any playing survivor still. 9/10 the toxic people I play with/against are survivors. I don’t really remember the last time I had a genuinely toxic killer
---
Hobbitses keeps Smeagol's precious away from hims!
---
amazing how some bamboo is solid others are not and some just go "fuck u get bamboozled"
---
You ever seen a Claudette hiding in a bush?
---
Exactly. That’s a Blendette.
---
*The whit wolf strikes again*
---
nancy and steve because of the ST but original game characters would be definitely nea kate and meg.
---
 i love their cosmetics and the klischees lying in their name what kind of players are playing them. (i relate to nea a lot when it comes to appearance and characters too)
---
Skill seems to have a large distance from PC to PS4 imo idk about XB. I ain’t a god at this game but I see a lot of very bad plays or mistakes on PS4.
---
The deep wounds change is quite possibly one of the worst balance changes they've ever made. Not only did it nerf a weak killer, but it buffed an already incredibly good perk. I can't see any reasoning behind it.
---
Why can I be 'inflicted by a deep wound' and then run across the entire map and save a survivor with no consequences?
---
Also I can’t see shit in some areas, like if u go through some of the bamboo on estate, you’ll find hidden routes
---
Imagine thinking good players actually do that 
---
this post was made by Sprint Burst gang
---
Wack! Never knew :)
---
You got me
---
Sloppy is used all the time. If you are good at looping you should be able to out run the killer meaning being 1 shot doesn't matter. while being good at looping you can pair this with adrenaline for a free health state without healing and a speed boost to escape the killer. sc makes the game longer than it should be and often gets the team killed.
---
idk why BHVR keeps making more variations of the worst maps in the games and somehow making them even worse.
---
I mean it would be absurdly powerful, but its not like itd elevate him above old spirit considering where he ist, just means he wouldnt need perks for the setup time.
---
At least let the boy start with more than 1, like 3 would be great (and change the common addon to something like +2 max traps idk)
---
I'm just thinking right now... Is it the age thing? Game experience or something I am not aware of? Or are you just plain stupid?
---
Read his comment again, it's well structured and if you can't understand it then ask your parent, someone more experienced in the game or start munching on some food for brain get that omega3.
---
Red Ranks on PS4 is mostly varied. Though Trapper is common recently due to the Archives. Matchmaking is also all out of whack now so that may help too. Though it is still usually pretty varied and I see most Killers do well enough depending on the team. Really organized team I’d assume that it would be close to PC, however.
---
I probably would, the map is just boring and not really enjoyable as some killers because you don’t get to use your power really.
---
When it gets to be just about every game a survivor stuns you and teabags in front of you, it’ll get frustrating. If it were scarce, it wouldn’t be a problem, but I had at least 3 games in a row where all the survivors would do was wait at pallets, stun me, teabag and then use a flashlight. So I mean if that’s not frustrating in your opinion, props to you.
---
I was grinding for a achievement where you inflict deep wound on someone and they have to go down. Ever since they change it it is so hard to get a survivor to go down. I was so close too I think I needed a few more people T.T
---

I can’t believe it needed to be pointed out to him.

*sad bing bong noises*
---
I’ve NEVER met a pig that has graciously let me boop the snoot... the search continues 😔
---
It's just way faster to find a teammate and have them heal you. I guess you'll want to run sc if you're not good in chases, so you can take a hit. But once you get better at chases, you'll hardly ever use it. And if you're worried about being found from the grunts of pain, iron will works better bc it works right away. If you want self care to work you'll have to waste however many seconds it is
---
What is this bell? I never knew about this
---
Is it rank 1 survivors making a lot of mistakes or is it the matchmaker giving you bad people? I've had a lot of low rank people in my games recently.
---
EIRRI said reproduction of their work is okay as long as the source of the art is specified, therefore, please plaster it with links. Lol

---
How often do you think you get very organized teams?
---
Kek I just became a plundering scared Dweet and got it done
---
i am confusion
---
Meanwhile the killer thinks you’re the best stealth players ever and is panicking because they can’t find anyone, not even a trace 😂
---
Oni a week? Usually it’s a few weeks or months even
---
Just sit on it and wait for everyone else to die! Wait, that’s not how you’re supposed to play?!? 
---
~{surprised face in sarcasm}~
---
That's how he responds.  He says nothing of substance or even flat out verifiably incorrect statements like Self Care only takes 15-20 seconds or that Sloppy may be meta but "nobody uses it"........like I'm pretty sure he doesn't know what meta means to finish that sentence that way.  But yeah dudes getting hammered by all sides telling him why Self Care is Garbo and he has nothing to retort with so he just pretends he disproved your points in other peoples comments.  Feel free to read them (he didn't).
---
My general rule:
---
“Sometimes it’s more altruistic to commit to the gen rather than going for the save”
---
So you’ll obviously have a good time finding someone else on a gen.
---
Outside of that, Survivor isn’t really that mindgame heavy in my opinion, and I think TrueTalent said this too:
---
It’s about PREDICTING the killers mindgames and countering accordingly. 
---
So even when you try to mindgame, be aware that experienced survivors WILL look out for it.
---
I once played killer and the easy mindgames didn’t work. So I threw a triple fakeout and got them.
---
There saying to stop nerfing them as they nerfed pig when she wasn't even that good when the egc came out. They also nerfed legion 2 times now the first time was needed but a little bit over kill, then they nerfed him again as he had sloppy butcher and a save the best for last combo with his power so they nerfed it again.
---
Wait, why are the all running leader and prove thy self...
---
Seems like a pretty poor swf team if anything
---
Crouched behind the counter watching a tier 1 Michael walk by out the main door. Shat myself making the mistake of going out the door afterward, having Michael turning around for hearing the bell.

if stuff multiplies instead of adding, they can be strong on their own and not broken together at the same time. currently the more of those you have the stronger each one gets
---
Imagine using an exhaustion perk
---
This post was made by the hooked gang
---
Probably will happen after the doctor rework.
---
Nice joke man, I can think of one, maybe two, unsafe loops. There’s plenty of pallets, drops, and confusing hallways to lose the killer with. I’ve played that map as huntress and Freddy, huntress isn’t the best for that map, freddys a little better cuz of his teleport but mainly it’s pretty hard to win unless the survivors play semi dumb(not saying ur dumb)
---
RIGHT?! I see so many people use both together
---
Then what would it be? Intentionally disconnecting to change the course of a match? What would it be?
---
How is being one shot a big deal? You keep spewing that shit like its self-explainatory... Learn to play of you can't handle being injured for a few extra seconds than be useful to your team.
---
I can relate to this, playing from the killer and survivors perspective.
---
He needs a buff that he won't receive as a legion main and part of the staby gang I can say that a lot of survivors think legion is OP due to there not being only one play style that stops him
---
Thats not frustrating you should be happy cause the sirvivors lost time in where you could do nothing and they could have runed
---
Annoying, unfair, but it’s not “cheating” because ur not breaking the rules, no one benefits from that scenario, not even the killer
---
Nothing scarier than working on the Myers house generator and Ghost Face was staking out on the roof.
---
I’m focused on getting at least one generator done minimum for the team. If I get hooked I get hooked. All the games won’t be Ws and escapes so do what I can for the team.
---
His 180 flick was what people liked about him but BHVR said it was a bug and nerfed/removed it, not sure.
---
If a chase begins you're instant down after like 10seconds with bad luck and with much pallets after a minute realy 75% of the chase is after you got hit and this 75% doesn't exist with sc
---
Strange that pallet looping doesn’t work here
---
You mean girl ;P
---
Classic
---
I play on switch and he has four locked head cosmetics: athleteface, leaderface,smart face and survivorface. They just popped up like a day or two ago. No visual of the cosmetic, just the names and brief description. Hopefully they will be available soon, muh boy needs to look swanky.
---
Edit: I bet they are gonna be Meg (athlete), Dwight (leader), Claudette (smart) and Jake (survivor) faces for leatherface.
---
Yea we all have a hard time accepting that. It’s just sad how they release something then nerf it immediately after
---
1.Part its an fact that sloopy doesn't get used often just look at the stats and the rest points look in othee comments I already said something about it.
---
I was being sarcastic and was defending you but I realise you're kind of an ass so go fuck yourself.
---
this is amazing! i already thought about dark souls, bloodborne and dbd related tattoos i could get because i love those games so much
---
Is this real life?  Feels like a fever dream or something.
---
"I can think of one, maybe two, unsafe pallets"
---
Bro I can think of about 6 safe pallets on that map.  The rest are dogshit.  No need to break midchase just go around and collect your hit.  There's like 3 or 4 of the same unsafe pallet spawn in the map corners alone.  Those are all free hits for killer.
---
I have lost exactly one match on there playing killer and it was against a really impressive SWF while I was playing Legion.  I've smoked them every other game and I've played about 9 different killers on it so far.  
---
You're vastly overselling the safety of those loops.
---
I’ve only just joined this community and am blown away by how consistently I find myself laughing aloud at the memes and shitposts. 
---
Another lol here, excellent. Cheers!
---
had a guy dc after I brought him to the hatch.
---
With enduring : Snack
---
No duh? The way you worded made it seem like you didn't think his idea was good enough.
---
Idk I always seem to get outplayed on the same loops every time, I know that first one upstairs is unsafe, so I leave the pallet their to trick people
---
That is completely not true. Some people simply want others to know that they are broadcasting, to potentially grow a community and gain viewers. 
---
That has absolutely nothing to do with their level of skill in the game.
---
"Real skilled streamers already have a fanbase".... except they all started with 0 viewers. Literally every one of them. They have just had the time to grow their community. There are plenty of skilled streamers that are still growing and it's pretty insulting you feel the need to accuse them all of being bad at the game.
---
I only get upset about not getting the hatch if they pick me up and show me the hatch and then close it in front of me. Very rude. True this has only happened like 3 or 4 times but still. If you wanna farm me, let's dance. If you wanna kill me let's do it. If you wanna let me go, very nice. But don't tease, I know I suck but still lol
---
Is that some abs im seeing
---
MM had been pretty bad, but some matches I’ve had purple/red and they leave others in hook, not touch gens at all , etc it’s happened even playing as survivor too.
---
If I was a survivor personified it would be Ace. I hate how cautious people play this game. You have to take risks. You can still play the game injured, there's no need to heal straight away. You don't need to run to a faraway hiding place after you're uncooked, or hide the second you hear a faint terror radius. And please for the love of all that is holy, please don't waste shack pallet.
---
I'll be the first to admit, I often get punished for my risk taking, but it's something survivors need to learn to do.
---
Dude every game I'm in there is sloppy so that stat is false and if you want to waste time doing nothing productive because you need the safety blanket of an extra heath state then be my guest.
---
Definitely Adam for the memes. I’d say Jeff as the second character. Aftercare can be pretty useful and Jeff is just fun to play as
---
Why didn't you just take a screenshot?
---
I love endgame safes filled with bloodpoints!
---
Wait...
---
Honestly this place kinda sucks for good discussion but the memes here are top tier. If I ever do quit this game I’ll still be here for the memes.
---
I cannot understand after the 10 second thing. You are clearly someone new to the game or not so new but has 0 awareness during the game. 
---
I can be chased by the killer for far more than 10 seconds and that's the truth for anyone that realise self-care is garbage. I can heal for 32-40 seconds in which case the killer had already downed someone else and by the time I get on the gen he'll be back or I'll be forced to go for the unhook hence 0% progress towards escaping in the mean time.
---
I just play my screechy flappy boi and wait for more cosmetics for him
---
What a cool and friendly sub. I love it when people communicate shittily and get butthurt. /s

If only there was a way to indicate sarcasm over text.... Damn shame.

I vote for kate and Tapp. Tapp cause all his perks are pretty decent, kate cause shes pretty
---
Oh yikes. People barely ever went down to it before, that's really rough.

I figured " Comedy isn't subjective you fool." was stupid enough to indicate i was being sarcastic but okay.
---
What
---
Except if you don't put TTV then many people simply won't click your profile and won't stop by your stream, thus affecting your views .  
---
But when you do put TTV, people (like yourself) assume you are trash or toxic, even if you just want to play the game and grow a community.
---
Yes they do! It's quite a fun perk combo with the buff now
---
Are there any aura reading perks that reveal you every time you break LoS with killer? I don't remember such
---
Stabby gang rise up
---
Beautiful. Thanks!

im planning on maining yui, but kate  *is* very pretty

dance with me and windows are nice, seeing as i cannot find pallets at all lol

Those types of thing happened when they released the new dying light, are you using it?
---
hopefully they add a skin where he's wearing makeup like in the first/second film

He really isn't as he can't use sloppy butcher with his power. The bleed out timer stop if your are mending, running, in the killers tr. His power cant get downs anymore. Can't see blood when you are in ff. Made the fatigue time longer and the recharge time longer. Moves slower than he use to in ff. Can only use ff when the power bar is full. The only buff he has seen is that he can stay in ff for 4 seconds longer. To many survivors think that a killer has been buffed than nerfed so bhvr keeps nerfing bad killers till they become unused.
---
lol Half tempted to take it down and re-edit it with that.
---
I know it sucks to play on an indoor map as Hillbilly, but you should just suck it up and play through the game instead of ruining everybody’s fun.
---
Because the tv is only connected to the tv box and my Xbox and my Xbox app doesn't work
---
Okay I’m posting my next vid here lmao
---
I think there should be killers with different aspects. Gen pressure killers should be killers that can get around the map fast (billy, hag, nurse), survivor pressures should be killers that can focus on killing a single or multiple survivor (leatherface, Michael, etc), and game speed killers (killers that overall slow down the game such as pig, Freddy as he used to be, doctor, etc). I think these killers should be buffed and nerfed to fit these roles specifically, instead of overall nerfed entirely, that way every killer has a niche to fulfill instead of being completely unviable, much like gods in smite

Many, many people complain about their games, you just don't hear it. You only hear it from twitch streamers because obviously they are broadcasting the game.
---
The false narrative that every streamer is super toxic only adds to the circle of hate in this community, which is really sad. But there are actually good, positive streamers out there, too.
---
I started on that cable, kept going off during the opening animation load-in
---
David doing the otz nose scratch too
---
He was asking an honest question, why do you have to be a dick?
---
I am a survivor main, but I do play some killer. It is amazing to me how many survivors don't know how LOUD they are, especially injured. Just cleansed a totem and the killer was passing by? You idiot. They hear the bones and the pop. Don't bitch about how they found you when you are being stupid. I am even screaming at my character half the time to stop breathing so damn much when she isn't injured.
---
The golden years of shitposting ;c
---
try swithching your perks to see if its any of them
---
He be kinda wibin doe ngl
---
It's very sad you assume anyone with TTV is going to be a toxic asshole. There are nice streamers out there, too, who just want to have fun games and broadcast them to a growing community (without being toxic or complaining all the time).
---
You mean prioritize the fun of survivors over mine, like the devs do when balancing fucking everything?
---
I think she is just punished too harshly for using both blinks. Her blink cooldown should be shorter imo then she would probably be in a better spot. Im a nurse main btw if that matters
---
When you get scared so bad you fly

Must not have been against high rank players.

Goddamnit I was gonna say that
---
I have my own rules like if I see a survivor teabagging or being a dick for the sake of it I won’t save them from hook or heal them. 
---
If people are farming with the killer I DON’T trust it, I’ve been fucked over so many times haha. 
---
Tbh if I’m being chased or having any contact with the killer I’m usually thinking ‘oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck’ because I am NOT a good looper apart from against nurse WEIRDLY?! (i’m red rank) I’m usually blind when it comes to pallets and vaults. Like I can run them for a decent time usually but nowhere near as long as some people do. 
---
When the killer lets me go they are my favourite person in the whole world. I will remember their name and look out for them again. 
---
If the killer is hag with that add on where it makes you deaf when you activate a trap, then they can go to hell. It’s not OP, it just scares the ever living shit out of me each time.
---
Ghost face is usually my favourite killer because luckily I get all the ones that meme around, 2% of the time they’re a toxic asshole. 
---
A pig has NEVER let me boop the snoot so that’s really sad... 
---
My least favourite killer is probably Freddie because I hate the sleep timer.
---
i get why people blame it on the wacky hitboxes even if it isnt to do with hitboxes
---
Doc: GET IT OFF MY FACE GET IT OFF MY FACE RREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
How do i learn all of the perks im not new to the game but i never play killer any tips?
---
ur not supposed to stare at endermen dude
---
This challenge was frustrating. Had the last survivor struggle off like 4 times and got it just in time before endgame collapse finished.
---
Ed edd and eddy
---
Not a single purple skin available with shards, amazing.
---
Ah, the olde double-edged sword. 
---
The very thing that makes this game meme-able (community, toxicity, imbalances in the game, hilariously fractious relationship with devs, the terrifying atmosphere when playing, et. al) also makes it divisive and disagreeable when discussing. 
---
Makes a lot of sense. I’ve yet to partake in chatter, wish me luck!
---
did the ghostface finish healing too lol
---
She looks like a pre-burned Freddy
---
I concur ted, that was most unrighteous
---
Oh Hawkin, somehow I read that as Haddonfield, my bad dawg.
---
This is ghost face as survivor but actually a ghost
---
Thank you! I love making DBD memes and that means a lot to me. :)

What does that addon do?

Going against nurse on console vs PC is like night and day. She doesn’t have that edge on console. Don’t get me wrong she’s still very good and strong and extremely fun to play, but on PC she just absolutely dominates and I don’t see that on console really, even in red ranks so you don’t see her often. 
---
Trapper because of the challenges but tbh you see an equal amount of everyone in red ranks on PS4 apart from nurse, she seems to be rare for me.
---
I mean, I believe the solution to this is to just get good, see if there are 2 survivors left you both still have time to play the game, some of my best games have happened after 2 dc’s/deaths. Whereas for killers, if all the survivors dc or kill themselves the killer is literally exiled from said trial with whatever bp’s or pips they could hold onto. Now don’t get me wrong both sides do get “shafted” when it comes to dc’s but it is extremely unfair to say that survivors are more robbed than killers.
---
Honestly, people who do this piss me off more than tunnelers. Just go, move on, you won, fuck off, I've got shit to do.
---
Ir grabbing you

Good luck brother and see ya in the fog

You’re most welcome, and please - for all our sakes - keep making them!
---
Not going to lie, I started playing Legion before the changes, and then the changes happened, and I honestly like him more now.
---
Why is that everyone’s excuse for losing/winning? You do realize that, that only makes you look bad? That you can’t if they’re red ranks, right?
---
Boy Scout Billy always fills me with joy cause it just looks so ridiculous, no matter how toxic you are I’ll never be annoyed by someone who uses that skin
---
Cheers legend!!!
---
*wait, what was that noise?*

Take care.

I think it’s a reference to when she stabs michaels eye with a coat hanger in the movie
---
Besides Sprint Burst it's my second favorite when I run dance with me
---
Meg= Killer
---
Something that made me smile is that I was playing as the ghostface in Strodes place and to finish my hook survivors in basement. And a survive realizing this he let me hook him in the basement 2 times ( this was during the end game collapse) and I was happy for him)
---
The normal facial hair on his mangled face doesn't help either
---
Actually if killers dc all survivors safety pip, it hurt survivors more if other survivors dc. This has at least been my experience, as every time the killer has dc’d in one of my matches even if my bad was below pipping it just blacks itself out and gives me a safety.
---
I hear what you’re saying, but I respectfully disagree. I think some of the “single match” challenges are fun, because they depend a lot on the killer, your team, and the randomness of how the match goes. You’re not supposed to be able to get 3 challenges done in one match. Most people would be done the entire archives in a day or two that way. It is meant to take time. It is meant to take more than one attempt. If people simply don’t have the time to do every challenge, that’s ok. But they might not want to buy the Rift pass next time.
---
I will agree that a few of the “single match” challenges should be altered, because they encourage a style of play that can be really un-fun for everyone else in the game. Notably, the Six Feet Under killer challenge (where you have to sacrifice everyone in the basement), and the Spine Chill survivor challenge where you cannot be hooked by the killer at all.

As survivor its horrible

Is that pre-rework freddy?
