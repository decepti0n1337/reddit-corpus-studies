Bug type: in-game
---
Huntress hatchets sometimes go straight through survivors without actually hitting. I've played this game for a long time, they are NOT using dead hard, there was NO lag, this has happened to me about 3 times over the course of a week. I have video proof if needed.
---
Steps to replicate: unknown.
---
I have absolutely no issue with NOED, as I often do 2-3 or sometimes 4 totems a game. If my 3 other teammates couldn't be bothered to cleanse the remaining totems, I'm not gonna risk my life to save them if they get downed because of it.
---

---
*However*, it's extremely irritating when a camping killer has NOED. What's the counter to NOED ? Cleansing totems. What's the only counter to camping ? Genrushing. So in either case, you're giving the killer the opportunity to get more kills either by allowing his NOED to activate, or by losing precious time looking for totems and cleanse them.
---
That‚Äôs just how some matches go
---
Exactly, I don't care if I live or die either tbh. But I don't see the point in not doing anything and making other ppl not able to have fun because the person won't help. Running from the killer and saving ppl are the fun parts of the game, what's the point if ur not doing any of those. Ya know?
---
As a killer I completely ignore those kinds of survivors. They can be annoying to deal with while patrolling gens. Though it‚Äôs a lot harder to loop when you‚Äôre the last person left.
---
‚ÄúIncorrect‚Äù -Ron Swanson
---
First of, MoM does not counter NOED as it is only activatable in the injured state, thus NOED actually counters MoM.
---
Secondly, as the other commenter also pointed out, not every killer camps. There are a lot who don't and according to you they just deserve it because they "camp".
---
I'm not defending camping here, it's an incredibly ineffective strategy that is also really boring. But you're overgeneralizing every killer player/main, also not good
---
Fuckeen crazy
---
He is the last one standing and you got to the hatch before him. He loses. How in the living name of fuck is this a problem?
---
I agree that it was a nerf, but I dont agree that Legion is useless and think anyone that gets bullied as Legion, hasnt played him enough.
---
Also I like the Buffs to bis Ultra rare add on as well as the fact that multiple add ons  became a viable Option due to the cd nerf
---
how is the legion easily loopable?
---
They are on par with PLAG in easily injuring the survivor, technically multiple survivor then afterwords chase at standard 115 speed.
---
‚ÄúDoing gens, you?‚Äù

I understand its unhealthy but you cant stop people from being assholes. What coudl the devs do?  They already lose points for it

jup, just make them look stupid with their Flashlight clicking
---
I don't know for consoles but for PC its a double pip if I recall correctly. You should be able to see it in your achievements place in xbox...
---
If your trapper you can just place a trap right at the foot of the switch and they're still completely fucked solo.
---
Decorate it anyway, grab the diploma, spam the flashlight and dont forget to tbag at the gates. Obviously sent them a mail ‚Äúgg ez‚Äù afterwards.
---
Probably gonna have the killer chase them as a distraction while the rest of you do gens
---
Bingo, same thing I mentioned in my post. Campers should not be able to get the benefit of NOED because the survivors have no choice but get gens done as quickly as possible. There needs to be something in place where the killers needs x amount of hooks (I‚Äôm talking a pretty small number, nothing major) or only survivors who‚Äôve been previously hooked become exposed, something like that.
---
That sounds like Freddy with extra steps
---
funny how almost no one seems to read the nerf, yet so many people complain.
---
The traps simply dont get powered after all gens are done, rest is still the same
---

---
Lithe needed that buff it had a bad tendency to not work while in a chase. Prove thyself? It's good i will give you that but it requires more coordination. Leader? I will be honest i think it's an okay perk., Maybe upper mid tier?  
---
Borrow time was more adjusted then anything considering it only affects the survivor getting unhooked.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
with killers tunneling off hooks WMI is not always a sure thing. As for kindred? I feel that it should be a baseline ability sense a recent Behaviour stat release showed that  majority of survivors play solo. Also diversion is like Head-On it's sorta of a meme perk.(It's fun to use but not always reliable)   
---
Also the exit timer needed to be buffed/adjusted, the EGC was reduced to 2 minutes. from 3.  
---
Lastly if you look at the front page of this subreddit it's clear people have been pushing the whole 'survivor vs killer narrative" long before i have. One side more then the other.
---
It's a mess of a game and I was just surprised that they were able to make it happen. I mean just look at the issues that have plagued the console versions. People seem to be taking offense to my comments for some reason.

That's no way to think
---
You don't get better by not drawing shit. You keep doing it to correct yourself gradually. It's called trash-can, not trash-cannot.  Stay humble
---
But they can prevent the perk by NOT DOING ANY DULL TOTEMS.
---
It‚Äôs not a good idea at all because it makes no sense. Your logic is I‚Äôm going to push survivors into wanting to cleanse dulls by making a killer perk that makes the killer stronger with every cleanse. Think about what you are saying, damn man.
---
Only an idiot would cleanse a dull as the smart move would be rolling the dice that the killer doesn‚Äôt have NOED, pretty much what majority of people already do now.
---
You right.
---
I just find it too hard keeping the tokens. It's literally three swings, and your perk is gone until you find your obsession again. When you have all 3 tokens and have a way of keeping them, its OP as fuck, but there's no real way to progress the game unless you have tombstone Myers or prayer bead spirit or something.
---
I'm confused why people seem to be upset at the comments. I'm not looking down on anyone by any means.
---
Glad that's going well for you what killer do you play?
---
(Equips Borrowed Time)  Your death is no longer my problem.
---
Major bug, while in a chase the music just stops. Half the time I can't tell if he's chasing me or not.
---
Also love how people down voting this wont say why, cause I'm right?
---
If you feel in danger its better to throw it and not get a stun to make distance to risk taking a hit and stunning
---
Professor Tox?
---
So 2 more possibilities after ghost face I assume for lore killers and survivors
---
True
---
Upvote
---
The entire "when going up against a 4 stack" thing has already been debunked. Less than 6% of games have a 4 stack, BHVR released those numbers recently. So what you're saying doesn't justify the reason for camping.
---
play this game before posting here
---
I make it my soul goal when I see that, that i proceed to piledrive any fun that the farming survivor was hoping to get out of them. The only time I will ever tunnel anyone is if they intentionally farm their teammate, and then proceed to give said teammate the hatch after cleaning up the match. Chances are they didnt deserve it.
---
There are 4 more masks you can unlock each one by sacrificing each one of the 4 original survivors around 25 times each

---
You‚Äôve heard it! Doing a gen 0-100 gives no points.
---
I mean right after that you get a free hit I think it's a pretty reasonable nerf.
---
You got some Mister Torgue Flexington vibes goin‚Äô on and I like it.
---
Exactly! You ruin the game for one person, who gets ZERO compensation, and everyone misses out on good BP for the game, all because the killer feels like ruining someone's day.
---
Most of the time I had somebody complaining (including myself) it's typically who liked running her in endgame.
---
The traps remaining the same throughout the rest of the game is kind of irrelevant to their argument
---
Once dedicated servers go live, they can tell why a player DC‚Äôed (whether it‚Äôs a rage quit or console and internet issues), and they will punish accordingly.
---
Don‚Äôt camp baby, please don‚Äôt camp~
---
I guess it‚Äôs just often overlooked, because you can use well-placed traps to force survivors to avoid good loops (or use them and get trapped) during a chase. It sort of ignores the RNG aspect because you‚Äôre right behind them in this case. Whereas with the Pig, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever a situation like this.
---
I agree
---
Repeatedly spamming mori without actually killing the survivor.
---
Ok then why post? Thats the answer.
---
The problem with this is that BHVR will often overshoot their goals once they get it (they often miss their goal a few times beforehand).
---
They have to be careful not to hit people that aren't camping but just passing by (say in a chokepoint map with a hook in the middle).
---
Camping should be tackled don't get me wrong, it's not fun for either side (at least I don't think it is) and doesn't adhere to good gameplay. I just hope BHVR is careful with what they do and don't punish people who play normal
---
Unpopular opinion: I think the Clown is the weakest killer in the game rn... like weaker than Freddy and Leatherface
---
&gt; this is why there should be a requirement for the killer to be able to even achieve NOED.
---
AMEN!   
---
Hell, you know the entire reason their looking at reworking MoM is because they said "If you're going to tank a hit, you should earn it".   
---
Oh? But Killers get the ability to instant down everyone at the end of the game without earning it? That's fucking rich right there.   
---
Meanwhile, we have to WORK to tank ONE hit. But killers just get a free 4k for sucking.
---
Nice Dude ! Congrats !

*‚ÄúThis item is a Territorial Imperative for any killer's bedroom.‚Äù*
---
it's only long because that's the way i write, i try to involve as much detail as the reader needs that way it has the most amount of info to make their own sort of opinion on that. For instance, if i just said that he slugged someone and didn't give me trapdoor that doesn't quite get the point across, i can see a few instances where killer's could do that reasonably. I figured i'd rather give them too much information than give them too little. I also made the post because i found it funny that he went out of his way to try to be a toxic player but i don't have anyone to share the story with irl that would really care so i posted it here. Where...actually people here don't really care here either they are here for memes :| but whatever, you get the idea(i think)
---
Ya cause survivors arent strong enough already. We‚Äôll just guve them a free slot for another meta perk
---
Facts, those heart eyes are for that booty.
---
I woulda thought the Plague had plenty map pressure considering she can just vomit everywhere.
---
I mean god forbid the survivors get to have fun too right? Obviously killers have proven they‚Äôre gonna play how they want, but staring at a hook can‚Äôt actially be fun for you people? Or maybe it is. ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Survivors actually understand that killers have to kill, the wild part is killers get more salty for survivors doing whatever they have to do to...wait for it... SURVIVE!

"It's more logical to hit me and hook me again since you're healthy and I am injured"

You lost me there
---
People who face camp are big gay.
---
Actually not true. If you‚Äôre a fun killer who isn‚Äôt camping/tunneling. Most people don‚Äôt care if they die, but instead killers want to be toxic and slug and leave people to bleed out all game or stare at them on the hook even though the game just started and no gens have even popped. Orrr now they love to close the hatch and when they‚Äôve finally got the survivor(who never stood a chance anyway) they‚Äôd rather BM them and leave them on the ground until the EGC timer runs out. But as long as the killer had fun right lmao.

Is M&amp;A good on nurse? As a surv it seems like you can always judge her position when her shriek changes.

You‚Äôve never heard them because survivors don‚Äôt come on here and post screenshots of everytime someone is toxic to them like the killers do.

you monster how dare you make me relive that scene

It has nothing to do with seeing wraith with good addon‚Äôs  can out run you and has gen aimbot to instantly locate all survivors

---
And in cases like Spirit Fury, you shouldn't even try to stun.
---
My minds telling me "Nooooooooo"...
---
This is the thing that probably annoys me the most when someone DC -or more- why do sometimes killers have to act like complete jerks? You already won, kill me or give me the hatch but don't waste my time and don't try to tilt me when I had the decency of staying in the first place.
---
I'm a lowbie too and good for you, no sarcasm. People are gonna shit on you for rank because they are salty survivors or forgot they were low rank at some point too. Keep on killing! Or surviving lol.
---
Depends on the map and who the survivors are. Try looking for four Clauds on Autohaven for 2 minutes without Whispers.

Man Ray is another survivor in every other panel

---
This! I'm so tired of entitled survivors bitching about getting killed by a killer in a horror game. It's absolute bullshit when you hook a survivor only to turn around and see the rest of the team sitting there expecting you to just walk off so they get an easy unhook so they can all tea bag at the gate.
---
And god forbid you use any perks they don't like. As a killer you're not allowed to use any perks that make the game slightly difficult for the survivors, but they can hop into a game running MoM, BT, DS, and DH and tea bag like they actually have skill. God help you if you run Ruin, NOED, or BBQ because you'll never hear the fucking end of it.
---
This was probably pure luck, or maybe im just used to playing M1 killers, but i got 2 or 3 4ks in a row with legion today.  Deep wound never mattered, i dont think the meter ever even decreased the slightest bit.
---
It was neat when i had the green pin to give broken.
---
It was neat when i had susies mixtape and deep wounded all the survs at one time, but they all mended and the first one i hit healed before i downed the last one.
---
I dont think the nerf is as tragic aa everyone thinks, but its a bit much.  Maybe if they backpedaled or buffed just one aspect the power wouldnt feel so useless without at least one green addon
---
I have, and I watch my SO play it quite a lot. Thus far I've seen nothing but kicking. It's visually boring.

M&amp;A helps you get closer to them before they scatter + it increases your infectious fright range.
---
I usually respond in a similar fashion. Half the time people leave after they've said what they wanted which feels similar to other games where someone whispers something toxic then blocks you so they can't hear your response. I've always found those funny. 
---
But I really like when I can say something like "lol gg &lt;3" and get &lt;3's back. "lol that was fun" gets positive responses too. If someone's really toxic I just tell them I hope they feel better soon. 
---
Arguing back is just a timesink, years ago I used to roll in the mud in an aim to beat them at their own game but close to half of these people are just looking to feel like they can do something and at the moment it's getting others mad and I don't want them to develop that way psychologically.
---
Q
---
How many times does this have to be reposted?
---
Well I wouldn‚Äôt call it an equal search when one side moves up to 15% faster and the slower side also has to contend with being chased if spotted. If you want to say it should favor the killer, fine, but calling it equal is definitely not accurate.
---
*Pans the camera lower

---
Have you actually SEEN the numbers given by BHVR? 
---
The chance of surviving any game, even WITH a 4 person SWF, is less than 50%. So no, the game does NOT favor survivors.
---
same, I always tunnel the hook farmer since I hate it when it happens to me. But you also need to know they don't do that because they are being nice. They are afraid the farmer has barrow time. but most of the killers are nice X Doubt

You get camped for playing for the most part lmao. I usually run borrowed time and dead hard so I can loop if I need to and save when needed. I do at least a gen if I can but it is hard when I got the killer up my ass most the time lmao. 
---
If I spawn next to a totem I feel like a dick if I cleanse it immediately. I will get dull totems to prevent Noed.
---
As do I
---
Its mostly the killer mains who act like that, you should have no problem in the survivor discord
---
...I never realized how much I wanted this until I read this comment.
---
Good for you dude. I already said it in the comments: watch what you enjoy. No need to pretend like my comment was addressed to you personally.
---
Usually play The Spirit but recently been hugging people with leatherface and chain sawing them
---
Nope. That would make baby killers cry and it's pretty apparent they only care about that group. They'll just ban half of all survivors and then wonder why it takes so long to get a full lobby.
---
That's literally my biggest problem with survivor like give me 10 seconds to go check a gen or something. Also stop running towards the hook the killers aren't bots and if they see scratch marks they won't leave and look around for you.
---

"use your mind reading powers"
---
You don't have to read minds when killers gloat about it in post game chat. Literally had killers say they don't care about BP and that they just wanted to make people ragequit and see post game salt. So I'm definitely not wrong here.  
---
"defending the hook from overly agressive survivor play"  
---
BAHAHAHAHAHAHA. You mean standing still and not doing anything.  
---
"super intended strategy"  
---
SURE! That's why they give incentive for killers to LEAVE the hook, and why they keep making anti-camp/tunnel perks. SUPER INTENDED STRATEGY.  
---
"You personally don't find it fun in the moment"  
---
Have you actually LOOKED at some of the other replied before you wrote this book to me? A LOT of people hate camping, not just me.   
---
"If the killer is literally unable to ever accomplish and defend their own goal"  
---
....then they need to git gud.   
---
"Once your mistakes cannot reduce your chances at victory, either personal or team based, the game kinda sucks."  
---
The thing you're forgetting here about mistakes and camping, is that for a killer to lose, he has to make mistakes over and over and over and over again. For a camped survivor to lose, he has to make a mistake ONCE. That's a ridiculously harsh punishment, and you cannot deny that. It's not a "reduced chance of victory", it's losing because the killer doesn't want to work for it by chasing others.   
---
"The killer camping *might* be trying to troll you, but *probably* is doing it because you guys are literally not doing gens."  
---
Look at my picture again. Notice how my gen is half complete, and you can see two survivors on another gen. Now tell me again how we're "not doing gens". This is your weakest argument by FAR. Camping when there's 5 gens left is beyond shitty. The game had JUST started, of course there wasn't a gen on yet. He's not giving the hooked person anymore chance to participate in the game. Considering the rest of your paragraph relies on this false statement, I will ignore it.   
---
"It is a huge psychological body blow that makes them really nervous."  
---
Which they deserve for camping. No sympathy from me there.   
---
"is cowtow to shitty survivors"  
---
Sorry, we're talking about shitty *killers* here. We've already established more than once that my team was doing what was right. Try again.  
---
"and have consistently found that killer gameplay becomes unbearably bad if the killer is not allowed to play defense on the hook."  
---
A claim like this needs a proper citation. Otherwise, you're just spouting shit.   
---
"DCs are not a reasonable response to camps."  
---
DC's get attention to big problems. It's one of the reasons attention was FINALLY brought to Legion. I even made a claim weeks ago that a Legion nerf was inevitable, and it happened. Telling the Dev's you don't like something will get a mark in some data warehouse somewhere. A Bunch of people saying "I won't play this game" in an indicator that something is WRONG with your game.   
---
"happened to get unlucky"  
---
There a lot of things in the game that factor in luck. "Hook Camping" isn't one of them. That's due to a the attitude of a single person in the game.   
---
"you decide to *rob* your teammates of the tempo advantage being hooked camped gives them."  
---
Because I'd rather move onto a game where there's actual opportunity to earn BP and have a good time. Or It's another insidious leatherface and I don't want another teammate to get downed and hooked trying to save me. Again, DC's get attention to problems.   
---
The rest of your post is some bullshit about what you expect of your team. Don't worry, if you're ever in a game with me, I'll make sure not to rescue you either.
---
Chase scoring is broken on Plague.
---
Gamepedia isn't an official source it doesn't mean anything. Ghostface won't have a survivor. Morf hinted at that and he was at behaviour studios seeing it before any of us had any clue.
---
Yeah but since it‚Äôs been hinted at for years I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs coming, I think they would‚Äôve done it by now

"You did 4 totems and missed one" story of my life lmao.
---
I agree that it's frustrating as a solo survivor. On some maps it's a complete nightmare to find totems, even with Small Game (looking at you, Lery's &amp; The Game). A totem counter would be nice, I don't understand why Thrill of the Hunt has a counter but Small Game doesn't ? Like come on.

As I said before, I don't mind dying to NOED if the killer did good and played "normally". I also don't mind killers having OP perks, they're supposed to be stronger. However they should definitely do something about scummy killers. NOED rewards these douchebags, and that's what makes it not fair for me.
---
Glass bead
---
I would spend money on this for sure
---
For perks, Bubba is a must for BBQ plus he's only $4.99. Franklin's Demise and Knockout are good perks for what they're for. FD destroys items and KO is good for slugging/very altruistic SWFs. Amanda has two good perks, Surveillance is good for defending gens and tracking. Make Your Choice is a very strong perk if you're able to find the unhooker. Her last perk Hangman's Trick is useless. Mikey only has one good perk, Save The Best For Last. Dying Light is only good for tunneling, and with the obsession changes can be completely countered, and Play With Your Food is very weak.
---
Playwise is all up to you, depending on your play style and/or like for the licensed killers. Mikey is a very balanced killer and comfortably sits at high mid tier, plus he gets jumpscares and overall has a creepy vibe. Amanda is overall a fun killer, is the cutest killer because she oinks and teabags, is good at stalling the game as long as you don't tunnel trapped survivors, and is mid tier. Bubba is the weakest out of the three, outside of camping hooks and basement play. He's a strong killer because of his instadown, and being the only killer to be able to down multiple survivors at once, however his chainsaw is easy to juke and if the survivor knows how to loop even decently well he suffers pretty badly.
---
Bruh.. We Need Caveira as a killer sometin like pig
---
Oh I go nurses calling, surveillance, bbq, and something I forgot cause I prestige him recently and started playing Billy because they are both good for monitoring wraith is slow and surprising silent so you don't he knows you're there but Billy is fast for monitoring, I have never tried leather face but monitoring is a big deal to me so I did play spirit for awhile but then realized she's only really good for catching off guard people who dont know her sound but that's about it she's pretty hard I thought, but leather face to me is just Myers but you don't have to charge as long but I also have never played him so I'm probably wrong
---
Problem with that is that, other than time, I didn't really lose anything. I get all of the BP from a certain time back and my rank stays the same. Only thing I really lose is character levels and the perks/items I got while leveling them up. And I have no idea what I may have lost in those 20+ levels.
---
I usually do close the game from the main screen. Sometimes, I'll be in a rush and close application from the PS menu that pops up after holding the middle button, but that's never been a problem either. It just seems totally random.
---
Damn man, that hurt *me*.

Definitely the words of someone concerned about toxicity in the DBD community, and certainly not mad and embarrassed that he got the spotlight of shame put on him in response to talking shit in chat.

What he means is "It's more logical( *for the killer* )to hit me and hook me again since you're healthy and I am injured"
---
That may be caused by tinkerer
---
What OP means is "It's more logical( *for the killer* )to hit me and hook me again since you're healthy and I am injured"
---
Thats sweet,but I get matched with low ranks for whatever reason the last few days and I will cleanse everything. Otherwise shit don't get done. (I'm currently rank 8 and I ONLY get matched with Rank 17 to 13....)
---
Most peoplecan't get any gens done till ruin is cleansed. And I'm not a fan of having everyone on deathhook and 4 gens to go. 
---
I only play solo and thats one of the reasons I run kindred otherwise I won't get saved. Also my Killer rank is pretty low and I got a full Killer Loadoutwith the best addons and stomp survivor,if I need to so no mercy for the killer,if I spawn near his ruin. He deserves it everytime.
---
No...this community does not need a chat room.
---
Should have been DVD, VHS outdated
---
please tell me you are joking
---
I think there are more toxic communities out there, mainly due to popularity and size of some games but DbD is densely toxic. Communication is limited to SWFs, after game chat rooms, direct messages, and butt dances. But you bet that those few moments of communicate will be just pure uncut toxic hate.

There's your problem. Try to play a little bit longer before making assumptions about the state of the game. I would recommend trying to play as the Wraith yourself so you can find out what his weaknesses are so that you can play around him as a survivor.
---
Yeah 3 protection hits is nuts considering how many times I try and protect an injured teammate, and the killer just ignores me until I body block him at a door or something and force a hit
---

Unless you just guard the middle like a boss

Just occurred to me that some people who say "just do gens" also complain about gen rushing. Like you can't have it both ways my guy

---
Stick with it man/lady. For every shit ass salt of the earth salt boi, I‚Äôve got some really fun/cool post game messages.  Really recently I had this guy go OFF on me after the game. I decided to kill him with kindness and he ended up apologizing, admitting he was having a bad day, and we ended up joking and chatting about bullshit for awhile.  Good times.
---
Gamers are... lame? But also kind of fun.  Anyway, welcome to the community. Be prepared for more shirtless Myers than you were expecting.
---
The Thing Chapter confirmed.
---
lol, not sure why this is getting downvoted. Gaming is toxic.
---
Nowhere does it say that. She's a hunter, no way does she not know about the birds and the bees.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day has been ruined.
---
I‚Äôm just disputing the point that each side has an equal chance, when that‚Äôs obviously not the case.
---
I honestly  baffled by twitch streamers disconnecting. This is why you don't have viewers, dummy
---
So here's what I've started doing that I love. It makes the games enjoyable for everybody and maximizes blood points gains (everyone gets 25k+ BP usually). The survivors and I still get a thrill (they are still not friends with you exactly) and in many ways it is more challenging. What I found out was at least at lower ranks you can actually single pip up without killing anyone. I don't always do it but I am more likely to if there is a DC, they have cake/bloody party streamers, or if I'm just feeling generous. Alternatively, if somebody loops me like a jerk/pisses me off or just teabags/taunts me I'll generally kill the person. 
---
So no matter what pretty much, I go tryhard as possible at the beginning. I try to go for two hooks on every survivor, but then leave after hooks as not to camp and promote unhooks. I try to find other survivors but if a player gets unhooked and I haven't found anyone yet I will go back and try to hook the rescuer (as not to tunnel) although I will down the rescued if that is the only person I find.
---
Then when someone is dead on hook (have to keep track of progression on everyone) I'll "slug" if I haven't two hooked everyone (and leave the area so people will heal them) while trying to two hook the other survivors or let them escape free from my grasp (often juggling them once to show my intention and then not turning at all while they struggle). Surprisingly, this doesn't hurt your blood points or emblems as killer, while it gives hard to get survival blood points to survivors. Despite this, anytime I get in a chase I will go after the player and try to down them (as not to lose chaser emblem progress). I also try to kick generators as much as possible to help everyone get max objective points (easily done especially with Ruin and/or overcharge). 
---
If you do this correctly you get get iridescent on everything but Sacrifice emblem which allows you to pip up at least at low ranks if you are good at holding generators early and make sure you damage them every time you get in a chase. I often do this as doctor (running Hex: Ruin, BBQ, Distressing, and Overcharge) and I often get positive feedback from survivors. I will say I'm on Xbox though and haven't tried this at green ranks really since I enjoy the challenge and the blood point gains (since I'm still relatively new).
---
My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day has been ruined. I can't believe this is real.

Honestly I hate it when survivors unhook each other 3 seconds after I hooked someone or they unhook them right in front of me. If you don‚Äôt want me to ‚Äútunnel‚Äù then be ducking smart and don‚Äôt unhook your buddy right infront of me
---
lol. Not sure why this is getting downvoted. Gamers are toxic af
---
But does each side have an equal shot at finding the hatch? That‚Äôs what he said and what I‚Äôm saying is clearly wrong. Whether it‚Äôs better than standoffs or not is moot.
---
Rofl, DBD, pretty good job so far!
---
They def need a priority system when multiple actions tied to the same button are stacked/around.
---
Cybersex. Duh.
---
A sweaty nurse lol
---
I think you mean asserted
---
You can just go ahead and assume every killer is running that
---
Cybers3x. Duh.
---
a sweaty nurse lol
---
&gt;You don't have to read minds when killers gloat about it in post game chat. Literally had killers say they don't care about BP and that they just wanted to make people ragequit and see post game salt. So I'm definitely not wrong here.
---
Cool. I mean my greater point was that this is a necessary interaction, but if a killer is going to rub salt in the wound its fine by me, because you can trivially punish.
---
&gt;BAHAHAHAHAHAHA. You mean standing still and not doing anything.
---
Correct, defending the hook.
---
&gt;SURE! That's why they give incentive for killers to LEAVE the hook, and why they keep making anti-camp/tunnel perks. SUPER INTENDED STRATEGY.
---
The first dev diary on the trapper talked about how good he was at camping. Also, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cr1i_zXOlxw&amp;list=FLM9FUOplk94Y6Sek1KJpVTQ%5C)
---
Hook camping was an intended part of the game to the point that old trapper could literally trap the unhook spot. They literally said in the beta that the hook *was* a hook because the survivor on it was a *worm.* Bait.
---
&gt;....then they need to git gud.
---
Counterpoint: The killer got a survivor down instantly, survivor needs to git gud.
---
Also, git gud is literally a facetious joke argument from the DS community. It is not implying you can nerf one side endlessly and the game to hold up. Again, the devs *have* tested nerfing camping and found it is so insanely punishing for the killer the game ceases to function as the killer legitimately loses all control over the game. Not "It becomes really hard" but "The game stops being a game" akin to Chess if one side wasn't allowed to move.
---
&gt;The thing you're forgetting here about mistakes and camping, is that for a killer to lose, he has to make mistakes over and over and over and over again. For a camped survivor to lose, he has to make a mistake ONCE. 
---
No, for the killer to lose, they need to make a very small number of mistakes, because the math of chases and gen repair time (Which has been solved, the killer literally does not have enough time to down every single survivor if all survivors JUST stick to gens and loop for even 30 seconds) favor the survivors.
---
For a survivor to lose to an early game hook camping, they need to be found early, mistake 1. They need to then eat a hit in a chase, mistake 2. They then need to eat another hit for 3, not have been in the chase long enough for killers to feel pressure at 4, and then also go down in a place with a reachable hook that other survivors can't block, which is 5. Not all these mistakes are equal (Its REALLY easy to not be the first survivor chased and if you can't manage that you deserve to lose 100% of your games because you like borderline can't function, but going down in a hard to hook area is really hard and unlikely to help) but it isn't "one mistake." Chases are a LONG string of choices, and if you go down fast it means you make a fuckton of mistakes in such a short span of time you have proven you are vastly outskilled and do not deserve a chance.
---
Like this isn't launch, the average chase length is over the time for a gen to be finished, not 15 seconds. The literal MINIMUM time for a chase is half a gen, due to the killer being animation locked and having a set speed. If you literally ran in a straight line away from the killer your teammates could complete half a gen. The game should not be balanced or change to protect you.
---
&gt;Look at my picture again. Notice how my gen is half complete, and you can see two survivors on another gen. Now tell me again how we're "not doing gens".
---
You either didn't do gens in time for a full chase or the survivor sucked ass. I am going to assume the first because you like actually don't understand the game.
---
&gt;Camping when there's 5 gens left is beyond shitty. 
---
Oh hey, a point we agree o-
---
&gt;The game had JUST started, of course there wasn't a gen on yet. He's not giving the hooked person anymore chance to participate in the game
---
I am sorry, I didn't know it was the killer's job to self sabotage because there was a super terrible survivor on the team, *especially* when players use high rank newbie survivors to artificially reduce their matchmaking rank so that they can stomp killers.
---
Should I give my enemy a full 2 minute grace period after killing half their workers in SC2 with a reaper ambush? No? Of course not. It isn't my job to be your handicap as your opponent, and it isn't the killer's job to go easy on you because you fucked up *so bad* you got caught crazy early.
---
Camping early isn't a good strategy *for the killer* because it is too easily punished, but it is fair. It is a deliberately allowed bit of their toolset.
---
&gt;Sorry, we're talking about shitty killers here. We've already established more than once that my team was doing what was right. Try again.
---
If you don't react to a killer deciding to camp early on you are a bad survivor.
---
&gt;A claim like this needs a proper citation. Otherwise, you're just spouting shit.
---
I shouldn't have to, they mentioned it on multiple dev diaries and on the forums around when the Exhaustion nerfs happened. I can't find the specific video, but it is well known enough that it has been referenced in multiple threads.
---
[Here is an example where a few people mention said devstream](https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1727575977556948315/)
---
They experimented with giving the survivor on the hook the ability to stun the killer, increasing bleedout time even more on the hook, and removing all killer BP and scoring near the hook.
---
They said outright it just meant that survivors would 3 man rush any hook and force the killer to either LET them unhook or lose the game. It didn't work. The killer *must* have a unilateral right to defend the hook or else the game just doesn't work, as the entire gameplay interaction between the killer is the killer can absolutely block any activity near them, but can only be in one place at a time.
---
This is, in essence, the entire game of DBD: Time management, pressure, and location. If you remove that, there is no way for the killer to 'git good' because you removed the only thing killers can do in the only situation that the killer can actually permanently slow the game. So they said they are *never going to do this.* Camping will always be at least as strong as it is now or the game *literally doesn't work.*
---
&gt;DC's get attention to big problems
---
So if I DC as a killer because a survivor flashlight blinded me we can get flashlight removed? If I DC as a survivor because I don't like trapper we can get trapper removed?
---
No, obviously not. Throwing a shitfit and hurting the game in the game is not an actual good way to solve problems. That is why they are gearing up to ban you if you keep doing this. You aren't doing anything but moralizing a non-moral issue and pretending to be unduly victimized by other human beings you are dehumanizing so you can avoid the ego hit and frustration of being forced to take the 'loser's lap.'
---
&gt;It's one of the reasons attention was FINALLY brought to Legion. I even made a claim weeks ago that a Legion nerf was inevitable, and it happened
---
A huge reason the legion rework happened is because the just were not fun on any level and, more importantly, their sales sucked.
---
Hook camping bitching has been around *from beta* and for 99% of the game's history the reaction from the community was to *laugh at people complaining.* Like back when the game first launched the number one way to get laughed on the steam forums was to complain about wraith, the second was to whine about hook camping. It used to be the mark of an awful survivor if they really cared because from the perspective of the 3 stronger survivors on the team camping was *good.*
---
&gt;There a lot of things in the game that factor in luck. "Hook Camping" isn't one of them. That's due to a the attitude of a single person in the game.
---
No, hook camping happens because you were caught early and someone made a cost-benefit anlysis. Not because of tude.
---
Also because sometimes survivors *train* killers to do it. By running near the hook so they think a rsecue is imminent but then going to do gens. Because, again, hook camping is *GOOD FOR SURVIVORS.*
---
&gt;Because I'd rather move onto a game where there's actual opportunity to earn BP and have a good time. Or It's another insidious leatherface and I don't want another teammate to get downed and hooked trying to save me. Again, DC's get attention to problems.
---
And this is why they are going to punish YOU and not the camper. Because you are prioritizing your own moment to moment enjoyment of the game over fair play to your opponent AND your teammates. You fundementally lack the empathy to understand why this happens, why it is necessary, and why you are ONLY hurting your team. You aren't drawing attention to a problem, you are *seen as the problem.* And they are going to ban you from games if you keep being a problem.
---
Camping complaints have been in the game from launch, DCs too and guess what they are doing? They aren't cowtowing to you because your DCing, they are planning to *ban you* because everyone is sick of your garbage and they literally *can't* nerf camping anymore.
---
&gt;Don't worry, if you're ever in a game with me, I'll make sure not to rescue you either.
---
Good! Don't! It actually *aggravates* me when a survivor tries to instant rescue me if I go down early because it means that not only do I die, which I probably would anyway at rank 1 when caught early, but they are throwing away their team's tempo, not pressuring the killer, and guaranteeing a legitimate rescue can't happen.
---
I can't stress this enough: Despite the devs generally being pretty overeager to nerf NPE for survivors, *you are seen so much as the badguy here they are planning to ban you for DCing here.* You are not 'drawing attention to an issue. Your behavior is just obnoxious and people don't want to tolerate it.
---
Here's a way to enjoy the game, give everyone a thrill (they are still not friends with you exactly), give everyone lots of BP (often 25k+ for everyone), and in some ways make it more challenging. What I found out was (at least at lower ranks) you can actually pip without killing anyone (you are only guaranteed no Sacrifice medal). I don't always do this but I'm more likely to if there is a DC, they have cake/BPS, or if I'm just feeling generous. Alternatively, if somebody loops me like a jerk/pisses me off or just teabags/taunts me I'll generally kill the person.
---
What are the changes?
---
The new infinite looks broken af
---
I'm on PS4 and had to make it where only my friends can message me because of all the shit that would get thrown my way after matches.
---
So here's what I've started doing. It's a way for to enjoy the game, give everyone a thrill (they are still not friends with you exactly), give everyone gets lots of BP (often 25k+ for everyone), and in some ways make it more challenging. What I found out was (at least at lower ranks) you can actually pip without killing anyone (you are only guaranteed no Sacrifice medal).

---
So while not tunneling/camping when someone is DoH (I keep track) I'll "slug" if I haven't two hooked everyone (and leave them so people will heal them) while trying to find not DoH survivors or let them escape my grasp (juggling once to show intention and then not turning while they struggle). This doesn't hurt BP or emblems while it gives hard to get Survival points to them. However, anytime I get in a chase I will go after the player and try to down them (as not to lose chaser emblem) and try to kick gens often to help their objective points and get gatekeeper emblem (easily done with Ruin and/or Overcharge).

I love RR for killer, fucking hate it on survivor.
---
What exactly are totem rushers?
---
Even when i have the video muted, i can still hear it
---
Fuck you boi
---
Something around those lines would be alright I think. Maybe it works the same way, activating when the gens pop and all that, but deactivates when the killer downs their first survivor. As for the camping, maybe work somewhat similar to how the EGC timer works? Slows down and greys out when the killer is within __ meters or so. Would act as a nice built-in mini Kindred too with the whole survivor team seeing the grey bar. Idk just throwing stuff out there. xD
---
Wrong sub
---
Well the protection hit detection is trash pal, there are so many instances where I've taken the hit to protect injured survivors and it never counted as protection. Unless they fix this the perk would  be complete garbage.
---
Stick with it man/lady. For every shit ass salt of the earth salt boi, I‚Äôve got some really fun/cool post game messages.  Really recently I had this guy go OFF on me after the game.

thats... thats basically what I said so... yes?

They should change it so you build stacks from normal m1s, but to proc it you have to body block
---
Thats... thats basically what I said... so... yes?

No0b3, a content creator for YouTube and twitch streamer who mains 'toxic' Nea if you're unfamiliar, had a match where only he and a Claudette were alive at the time and only two generators needed to be completed for the Exits to be powered.
---
The Killer began chasing him around the time Claudette finished one generator, but during the ensuing 20 minutes chase Claudette did not get the last generator done. No0b3 eventually got downed and killed while Claudette, unsurprisingly, got the Hatch.
---
In the post-game chat, No0b3 asked what Claudette had been doing and she said "getting generators, you? aside from dying"
---
Even the Killer from that round was upset at her for not doing the last generator.
---
There was no way it couldn't have turned into a huge meme.
---
You can watch No0b3's video on the round [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MvbUqOVJic) if you're so inclined.
---
Maybe they're implementing this https://youtu.be/zKu1Y-LlfNQ
---
I CAN‚Äôt do anything! I‚Äôm in a wheelchair, I have hepatitis c!
---
They literally tried this in a test, and said they would never do it because it means the hooks stop working as a mechanic entirely.
---
You can watch No0b3's video on the round (here)[https://youtu.be/_MvbUqOVJic] if you're so inclined.

You know, if anyone noticed that blatantly you could possibly get reported for working with the killer. I just want to protect you is all

You can watch No0b3's video on the round here if you're so inclined.

The movement speed and vaulting speed nerfs were unnecessary, the updates that removed the exploits were nice. He now has counterplay and although he got even more shit, he now isn't a nightmare to play against so I'd say the updates were a success

No no! Take out the horse because then I knew what was coming! I want to be completely suprised. This is great though!
---
No no no

Nah I've been called a niggerfaggot way too many times today in the actual game already. Don't want to experience that on the outside as well.
---
Now link me topless of the girls for... completions sake
---
I dont see people discussing the youtubers much though. As for original content it's a sub for a game. I don't think we will get a hole lot of new content unless it's just like pictures and memes. I'm here for discussion not just original content. No one I know plays dbd so I come here to talk about stuff with other players.
---
WGLF 4 leaked footage.
---
I like Prove Thyself with those perks because it counters Hex: Ruin so well, and gives a ton of bloodpoints for co-operative action. You basically max-out the Objectives category in a gen and a half, assuming the totem isn't cleansed prior to that.
---
Look out Dwight! Meg's coming for that title if yours

It's great, it's just like when Pig came out &amp; no-one knew how RBTs worked. Gotten so many gate kills

Horrifying/fun fact, the Clown smiles as he's loading up new bottles. I had the joy of watching him press his gut against the locker I was hiding in as he stalked another survivor.
---
When you dead hard into Absolutely Nothing because you fat finger the button.
---
I may be the only one dumb enough to do that.
---
I like spine chill a lot more than tech, since it tells me if the killer is coming my way (if it stays for longer than a blink. It's less useful if you're doing what I do and run the killer around for half the goddamn match, but when I am a gen jockey it is very useful
---
If you leave a game you should get a punishment. First Leave 5 min second one 15m and third one 45 min or even more. You have to play at least 2-3 games to go back to 5 min. or again even more.

They should lower the stacks from 3 down to 2, since taking hits for another survivor is harder and don't happen nearly as often as just taking hits when alone.
---
Yeah, but it‚Äôs pretty easy to just push through the sickness. It *does* make survivors more vulnerable, but other than that it works less like a gen pressure skill (since, again, you can just work through the sickness like you work through ruin) and more like a map knowledge skill (hey, that survivor‚Äôs getting sick, and I didn‚Äôt do it. I think I know where he might be)
---
That being said, I don‚Äôt own her yet, that‚Äôs just my experience from playing against her as survivor

Lol you people can downvote all you want.  The inclusion of a joke doesn't discredit the question asked in the title.  And that is the reason you can't stalk in corn by the way lol.
---
I'm saving this, what a great comment!
---
You have to remember that the Survivors don't see this as a horror game though.
---
When the Survivors can take 7+ hits, actively have to seek out the Killer to get a rank up, and most of the killers can't put the fear of The Entity in them, it's only to be expected.
---
Daddy Myers wears no shirt
---
Even then unbreakable is a one time thing. The killer wouldn't face that penalty if they weren't tunneling in the first place. You get more points for getting as many hooks out of people as possible anyway so I don't see the appeal to tunnel and camp styles, especially when people you do this to don't bm or anything
---
Every single comment of yours is, that you are calling out hypocrisy, yet the only hypocrite I see is you.
---
The title is super misleading, since the idea behind is, that the community is very divided (by either side mains) and then your post makes nothing else than feed it, since it's just killer sided. Also when someone brings a fair point to start a reasonable discussion, you act butthurt and that's really sad.
---
Both sides get nerfs (I dare to say survivors get nerfed more often, but hey, devs only listen to them right?). Both sides have annoying perks and both sides have the ability to make the game hell for the other (camping, tunneling, flashlight clicking, tbagging).
---
So, if you want this community to be "fair and balanced", maybe you should start with yourself.
---
Yep. Plague doesn‚Äôt get any points for vomiting. Sorry if you didn‚Äôt want to be an m1 killer and still double pip cuz fuck unique killers amirite.

You have like 60 downvotes, but fuck me if the console version isn't inferior in every which way. Console players legit complain about how badly optimized the game is, so it's a mystery as to how they are offended by their own emotions.
---
"Kid", "get gud", you sound like such a moron.
---
High level player would never touch them. You think people who know not to heal in situations are going to be stupid enough to cleanse totems where all you are really doing is risking losing the game and gaining nothing? Trust me, I‚Äôm trying to be as nice as possible explaining this but the idea is absurd.
---

That's a mega F

It's more logical [for the killer] to hit me and hook me again.

To complete this daily I usually have to get lucky and either get a competent team, or come across a nice Killer who farms if everyone else DCs. (Had a Clown do that earlier. I double-pipped. Good times.)

i was thinking of like. if the killer is around a hooked survivor for like 60 seconds the survivor actually gets some of their "hook meter" back

Literally on my second day of playing, I got bitched out in post game chat because I guess I was terrible or something. I even told the guy I bought the game two days ago.
---
Next time someone yells at you, say "you suck too if you're in my noob rank :)" because you only get grouped up with people in your same rank,so people in those ranks really have no room to talk
---
OMFG DAMNNN THAT'S SO TRUE!!!
---
I would make their cooldown for coming out frenzy and their vault speed just a tiny itsy bitsy little bit faster, but besides that I think they're in a good place now. I find myself playing them as intended now. I go into frenzy and stab someone, and then look for other survivors and stab them too. If you can stab multiple survivors while in frenzy, or even all of them, it slows the game down a fair bit as everyone goes to mend and then possibly heal afterwards. Thanatophobia is really strong on them too. They're still fun to play. They just require actual skill now to play well, and the survivors have counterplay with them now too. If they can get Legion to miss while they're in frenzy it'll kick them out of it. Because of the slower vault speed they're not guaranteed a free hit at pallets.
---
Before I found that frenzy just didn't last long enough to use their power as intended. To effectively play Legion before you were best off tunneling people with frenzy until you downed them or moonwalking until they get downed by their deep wound.
---
Legion was a dumb troll killer before, but is actually a decent one now.
---
Congrats, you played yourself
---
ya it sucks when you face a bad killer
---
Lmao why would people downvote you? Leave Lobby, have thick skin, sure, there's ways to not let it bother you. It's still good to bring the assholes into the light and make fun of their insecurities. Unless your point is to defend them, then lmao you're just one of the assholes. But I didn't see that. And who gives a fuck about downvotes or upvotes
---
As long as you don't tunnel the obsession STBFL is a very, very god perk. Plus it makes his passive finger knifes go faster somehow!
---
Not even debatable. Hope is great.
---
A streamer had like a 20 match survive streak and looped a pig for nearly ten minutes on the preschool map and zero gens got done in all that time and the Claudette got the hatch after the streamer finally got caught and he asked her what was she doing the whole time and her reply was "Doing Gens, you?""
---
How's it different than any other killer having Franklin's?
---
Hope/Adrenaline is god tier for pulling clutch saves. It pretty much guarantees that you're going to be in a good position to be a solid homie to anyone in trouble in the endgame. I think it's overkill if you aren't using it for altruistic reasons, you shouldn't need Hope on top of Adrenaline just to get out.
---
Yep. Plague doesn‚Äôt get any points for vomiting. Sorry if you didn‚Äôt want to be an m1 killer and still double pip cuz fuck you amirite.

people underestimate doctor skill cap. most of the time he‚Äôs trash, but a seriously good doctor will fuck you up at the same level as hillbilly or nurse
---
I hate how toxic people can be in this game. The official discord is pretty terrible as far as quality discussion goes, it‚Äôs full of salty, edgy people. I just try to spread positivity in the fog, whether I live or die; 4 man kill or fail miserably.

Bing bong of shame for this comment.
---
maybe you should just play survivor honestly since you have bad internet. hopefully it is not a perma
---
Like I said earlier, if downvoting me makes them feel better, go for it.
---
Dear god this made me think of every entitled survivor in their swf that complained after i killed them instead of getting their healthy friend
---
Buy an extra one as a decoy. Put on the decorated one right before you walk
---
Oh my god, someone even made the same joke I made on this one. It was too good to be original...
---
If that's what you want you're playing the wrong game sadly. I would suggest Fallout 76 for experiences like that.
---
I would've understood if someone said yolo or swag, but "lmao"? I use that shit all the time brother lmao

You falsely accused people of lagswitching and got banned? Very suspect.

I play mortal kombat and dbd religiously and mk is no where close to the toxic levels of this community. Shit even friday the 13th had a nicer community

His right bicep says pride with something over the I. It‚Äôs written in black ink. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Someone said it meant white pride so I stopped watching him.

Vigil + Cav = Vokk
---
Holy fuck.  If that's true what a jack off.
---
If f13 somehow comes back from the dead ill be playing that instead
---
this, exactly. the millisecond my terror radius isnt on the hooked survivor, they get pulled off. every single game, without fail. why would I walk away when I know someones gonna try pulling them off even if I walk around the area waiting?
---
people will literally group up to unit block me to save someone instead of just doing gens, and im sure it doesnt just happen to me
---
Same here!
---
Yet another survivor nerf
---
or you rush gens, open the exit gates, and leave. NOED only works when everyone tries running back for that one person on a hook
---
Lmao! Good job
---
You fucker
---
ill play against nurse
---
spirit however...
---
Jen is literally one of the biggest DBD streamers
---
I ran all the way across one side of the map to the other against a pig with noed. It‚Äôs saved me a lot.
---
&gt;No. Its an old offering. U can get it for the shape, pig, bubba,...people who havent bought these killers have a chance to play them
---
There are also legacy ones for Doctor and Hag, from before they were made available for shards in the shop.
---
No it isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs such a cheap move cheating the system imo
---
its not my fault season 8 decided to ruin sansa, dany and jaime
---
Yeah, and it was awkward as shit lmao It looked like he was trying to find a way to say it in the least douchebag way possible, but only made it worse.
---
Sure... I am quite positive devs can tell the difference between bad connection and straight up lag switching. Even people using MLGA can tell it.
---
Yeah can‚Äôt relate lol. You‚Äôre probably just getting unlucky.
---
I‚Äôd absolutely love these if the poses and background weren‚Äôt so boring.
---
I don't personally dc.
---
But god damn if I don't consider dcing after seeing a hatchet two feet to my left down me. Really hope dedicated servers fix stuff like that.
---
...Are you sure you are on /r/deadbydaylight because they most certainly do.
---
He was literally the best part of the dev streams and him not being on it is the main reason I barely watch them anymore
---
I swear survivors know when you bring great add ons. I did a match once as bubba with two of his best add ons and they were the last two I had and a party streamer and as soon as they saw me, all 4 DCd immediately. Fuckin annoying
---
It does say Pride with something over the I but I didn‚Äôt stick around long enough to investigate further.  Why I was told weirded me out. I agree if true not cool. But the fact that he wears it so proudly and no one cares says more.
---
same, and I don't even main her
---
I see, a worthy origin.
---
Lightweight's 'disappear **3 seconds** faster' stat confuses players on how effective it really is, they should replace it with 'disappear **33%** faster'.
---
My issue with NOED has always been that if a killer is shitstomping and only 1 or 2 people are left alive when it pops up then he can easily sweep the game with it. On the other end of the spectrum it just gifts a killer a kill even if they played like absolute dogshit. Someone could literally afk in front of a dull totem the entire game and then when the last generator pops find and down a survivor to get a free kill. There isn't a "downside" to NOED, there is no "worst case scenario". 9 times out of 10 you are guaranteed at least a single kill with it.
---
There are so many problems with the perk that I could go on for much longer about. If a survivor runs you around for 10 minutes only for you to finally down them with your NOED and then you ~~facecamp~~ "secure your kill" them you didn't outplay that person at all you were rewarded a pity kill for making the poor decision of investing so much time chasing someone that knows how to run.
---
What system? I almost never see huntress.
---
Agreed it would be so much better without the horns
---
I really wonder what you actually posted, this community is toxic as fuck but people legit asking for help usually do get real responses.
---
It's just a rant to let out my frustration. I'm not one to complain, especially about this game because I still fkin love it regardless. 
---
But it's still stupid.
---
I can see the new ghostface perk actually being a good reason to not do this. The obsession changes when someone unhooks the obsession? (Iirc)
---
I wouldn't personally want to proxy because it might scare people off. This is assuming that the suggested rework happens, which it probably wont.
---
But then adrenaline pops and they have a key...
---
I felt bad for the last team I went against; 2 immersed Claudettes (1 of them having Iron Will or whatever so you don't scream) I was on shock doc and took out the obvious threats after bouncing around. Those two Claudettes could have powered through the last 2 gens (I had 4 to check, 2 were both at...let's say 60% when I kicked them) The whole time I start my loop of gens, nothing gets done. I kick the 60% gens and look for them for a solid... 3 minutes? I did like 3-4 loops of the gens and after not seeing anyone even tap the gens, I throw on shock and start looking. I find the P3 Claudette crouched between a small wooden post thing and a rock wall in grass out of pure luck, hook her and use BBQ to find the other.
---
After the first 2 or 3 loops they could have waited to bide their time and work on a further gen while I look in last known area. They could have lived. But they didn't. They got barely anything done.
---
Take a look at my picture carefully. Does it LOOK like we‚Äôre wandering around near the hook? At all? Seriously? You can‚Äôt make that argument in this instance. They stuck around until the survivor went into struggle, and NOBODY was there to unhook.
---
Posted as in the original version of this post? Or the post I made/messages asking for help?
---
Have you solo queued as survivor recently? It most certainly is not fun.
---
if you remove noed, you kinda have to get rid of adrenaline too. 
---
if a swf all bring adrenaline, or just multiple people in general, theres pretty much 0 you can do about it besides have NOED. 1 person on the ground and 2 injured? no, theyre all healthy with speed boosts now. without NOED, youre just fucked in that situation
---
As a Claudette myself, I'm slightly appalled you say that. I seem to be the only one who takes doing gens seriously. I'm one to wanna complete all gens and then exit. And how am I supposed to do that while having the same success rate if I wasn't  blending in with my surroundings haha
---
Well he does have something over Billy, his 1 shot can go on for a bit, hit multiple targets, and he can move while doing so.
---
It‚Äôs easier before graduation my friend. Should‚Äôve gotten held back a year and made it last.
---
I think they‚Äôll end up having you use these duplicates for a crafting system instead. 
---
Prolly won‚Äôt see BP trade-in for bloodweb items since that would just make it feel more tedious, in addition to making rarer items less rare due to accelerated movement through bloodwebs.
---
They shouldn't nerf something because of 1 persons unlucky matchmaking. That's ridiculous.
---
That's a fair point. But, his slowed speed while using the saw can make getting that 1 shot a pain in the ass, especially in an area with multiple windows that you can fast vault easily. I think he needs a buff of some kind though, at least let him cancel the saw without taking a huge speed nerf for a second or two.
---
Huntress is actually very rare for me. When I played console they were more common so maybe it's just a console thing? Again, they're pretty rare for me though.
---
Ahhh. Ok. Thanks for letting me know. Was just very confused since it was Michael but the person had wraith add-ons and build.
---
Nah everyone‚Äôs daddy myers
---
both, I know this sub is full of legit sociopaths and morons but usually genuine asking for advice threads dont get made fun of
---
Its a step in the right direction but there are still far too many problems with the game for me to consider playing solo survivor for any longer than an hour or three every week. I'd really like the ability to know how many unbroken totems their are on the map. I'd also like to be able to see what perks my teammates are running in a lobby so I can adjust my expectations accordingly. Hell I'd fucking love for BHVR to add some "hours played" based calculations to matchmaking so the game tries to look for people that have played a similar number of hours as you. I personally believe they should do away with rank entirely in exchange for this (because really rank serves no purpose and I FULLY believe that it would be bad for the health of the game to add rewards to rank) but I can understand why some people think that a rank based system is better.
---
I don't really have a problem with the bloodpoint grind from the survivor side I just wish the game were more enjoyable while trying to grind. Solo survivor is just a toss-up to see how mad I can get in one evening of playing.
---
Then if that were the case, the killer is more focused on looking for that rather than survivors. It's easier for killer to walk around freely while searching for hatch than it is for survivors. If we get seen, we get hooked. If killer gets seen, he can carry on.
---
I hide in between doing all gens if that's what you mean
---

Embrace the vommymommy üò©üò©üò©
---
You're probably just unlucky.  
---
I've been seeing plenty of Doctors today, but yesterday it's been a lot of Michaels and Hillbillies.  
---
No reason to buff or nerf killers because of anyone's matchmaking. Unless it's been proven that one killer is played THAT much more than all the others.  
---
Besides, it's been shown in the data sheet that Huntress is only the most played killer on PC and in ranks 19-20.
---
We get a very very SLIM chance in succeeding to open one without getting caught in the middle of it
---
I've started using this add-on. The amount of times I've been working on generators and turned to see a survivor just staring at the beacon.
---
Cept it didn‚Äôt but ok
---
Well this post is the same I only added that one edit to mention the people calling claudette racial slurs, and as for the post asking for help I just wanted to know how to skip the cut scene that starts when you load up the game and people we're responding with stuff like " press Up, down, left, left, right."
---
I think that instead of nerfing Hillbilly(which is pretty balanced imo), they should buff Bubba.  
---
Maybe give him the ability to chainsaw fake, make him faster while revving, or do *something* to buff him, because he needs it.
---
Because he'll camp out the gate knowing timer is up shortly...
---
It‚Äôs not farming if I have BT :)
---
Is he thinking of stabing himself
---
I would just save up and buy it in 1 year increments. It's only about $80 for a year. Sometimes it's on sale too.
---
While it does take set-up, I find Doc a rewarding bloodpoint farming machine. I use absolutely 0 of his own perks, and 1 or 2 are base perks (Distressing and NOED if you don't have Ruin). Other than that, leveling up Trapper for Unnerving Presence and Leatherface for BBQ and Chili (and Hag for Ruin if you don't like NOED) takes investment, but is probably the most fun games I have.
---
The goal is no longer "Get a 4k" but instead "Get 4 BBQ stacks" then after that you can do whatever you wish. Flex on them with your loop-wrecking skills? Mindgame the shit out of them and shock them constantly for no raisin? Beat them with your spike stick, down em, let em get free just to chase them down and do it again? Why not?
---
But for real I don't feel like I have to be sweaty, I never use Addons and Offerings because I am cheap and like hoarding things. Good games give a good 60k with BBQ bonus.
---
enjoy her green fluids
---
Oooof ooof
---
They piss me off as a killer too
---
By faster I meant 100%, similar to Billy.  
---
I honestly can't see how making him move at even 105 while revving would be too powerful though.
---
are they getting gens done?
---
If you get hit don't drop the pallet, run to a different area.
---
I think I read somewhere the devs didn't want it because people could grief with it by declining the unhook. One redditor claimed they even experimented with it and decided against it. 
---
Personally I find it a load of bollocks because you can already do stuff like hold shift when in dying state to deny being healed, etc.
---
hm, idk, just people being trolls. If you havent figured it out yet btw you just spam left click on the screen
---
I was going to reply to your volume 2 book, but it was actually worse than your first, and I'd be wasting my time.   
---
You have outdated references, overuse of fallacies, self contradiction, and an endless amount of assumptions about myself and my team, despite the situation having been explained to you. Spending my time pointing them out to you isn't my idea of a fun time.   
---
I'll say this much for myself, you don't reach Rank 1 by consistently playing the game wrong. You won't believe that of course, because it's clear to me that you're demented. But it is what it is.
---
Besides for his add-ons Billy does not need nerfs
---
I love Ry!!!

Imagine having sledge in dbd. I can‚Äôt count how many times a sledge player has jumped through a wall and scared the ever living shit out of me

Yo pills man while I agree camping is shit and I hate nothing more than getting face camped game after game I gotta say. You sound like you're still tilted in your comments on here man. These people are just expressing their thought processes. Best of luck out there! GL HF.
---
Oh okay I'll try that also I'll just block and report their toxicity to the reddit mods or on the game.
---
i mean, i cant get a 4k without pipping. so obviously they are
---
Special ability: eating cheeseburgers on one of his plates to heal himself (works once)
---
no moris.
---
i probably dont get enough kills but i cant fathom how 30k bp doesnt resolve in a single pip. i even got a kill that game too (he didnt suicide on hook)
---
Don't take them seriously, don t try to reason with them and stop seeking their approval. Toxics will toxic no matter how much you abide by their entitled made up rules. A sore loser is very likely a sore winner too, don't stoop to their level. If you see no sign of intellegent conversation just drop that gg and move on. They feed on your hatred.
---
Maybe he wanted to let you get some more points before he killed you? I know when I absolutely dominate as killer I'll usually let the last 2 play around for a bit, but it'd be un fair if I gave one the hatch and not the other and I'm not sitting through a ton of gens doing nothing so I usually kill them after a bit of messing around.
---
&gt;i keep getting around 30k bp but no pip at all, just a safety pip. how on earth is that possible
---
Is almost like pipping is not longer tied to bloodpoints.
---
Mind blowing.
---
I just googled "wtf is a steam64" and I found a website to do it for me
---
&gt;are they getting gens done?
---
You can end the match with 0 generators left and still get an Iridescent Gatekeeper. It all depends on how long the game lasted and for how long you had multiple gens still up.
---
i play on pc and im rank 15 i dont play survivor much since i mostly play killer but this last month has just been huntress
---
Dude you wanted to hear someone complain about camping, so I did it. You didn't ask for specifics.
---
KOALAMAAN!!!!!! Hahahahaha
---
maybe i am but this past month all ive been seeing is huntress (on pc)
---
to be fair huntress is easy mode, maybe not nerf her but other killers def needs some type of buffs
---
I will go by this! +100 (+1)
---
"I am 3/3 the culprit", genius, fucking genius. That's the kind of line you come up with 4 days later in the shower.
---
NOED=smol pp git gud run 0 perks and no spacebar allowed
---
It makes him go faster WHILE reloading. Corkscrews make reload itself faster
---
I know, but don't run in front of me while I'm trying to Sprint Burst? lol
---
More annoying when they‚Äôre next to a window
---
I will reiterate this is not an out of date stance for the devs.
---
Your 'protest' is going to get you banned. That is how sick of your shit people are. The devs aren't going to do what you want because you are 'dcing to show a problem.'
---
The vast majority of the community finds the idea of people like you who DC first down with no gens like literally the god damn worst to the point *it is a community meme.*
---
Like you are going to be removed from the game if you keep doing what you are doing, and this was a feature *WIDELY REQUESTED BY THE COMMUNITY.* You do not have a leg to stand on here.
---
Yeah i don't get it either
---
I was talking from experience.  
---
When I play, I usually win by slugging and ending my chases really fast. Most of those games where I get fast chases, I don't pip.  
---
On red ranks, if you don't kill enough, you won't pip.
---
It is really funny seeing a newbie just look at it wondering what the hell is happening.
---
Yeah.. most people are like that but if you'd like some tips 
---
Some ways to get better just include practice really. It's the way I climbed up watching turtorial are also good and learning good perks Claudettes is good place to start just because of self care once you get the teachable for selfcare break off to diffrent characters and repeat
---
Yes, because the killer has to keep track of 4 people. What would you propose? Infinite sprint burst when the EGC happens for the last survivor?
---
LF's do that more often, since Billy can easily find more people to hook
---
Not getting BBQ stacks sometimes in matches even after hooking everyone, yes I have tier 3 BBQ

Sometimes I spare survivors based on how cute their outfits are. Or if they're Jane/nontoxic in a team of toxic people.
---
Congrats on merking a noob killer.
---
no one does that anymore
---
Lightweight is one of the best stealth perks
---
Change my mind
---
They didn't change it people. They're doing some experimenting.

ITS A PROTOTYPE IDEA, DONT FRESK OUT PEOPLE

Locked - Uncivil behaviour in the comments

MOM needs some tweaking, it's just way too much of an annoyance a perk can make in a match.
---
The current ideas are really harsh but something needs to be done
---
Give us Myers PLEASE
---
Every killer is strong in a 3 gen set up, but survivors will usually still win in that scenario if there are 4 left, which there will be if it‚Äôs the Plague

Hey you can add me on steam and I'll teach you some of the basics of the game like looping, it's a fun game if you stay with your people, or Ignore the toxicity. My steam is the same as my username

I checked his steam profile, and it had a group called ‚ÄúBanned dbd players‚Äù and there were only 3 accounts. 2 with the name being SweGamerHD and one with another name, I‚Äôm gonna assume that‚Äôs his too or like a close friend. I literally was showing his montages to a friend like less than 2 months ago and then I went to find them like a week or 2 ago and found that everything had just vanished.
---
Lol we are not bad,
---
You really Need to verse decent surviors at decent ranks to know how one extra hit can be detrimental in prolonging a chase and can result in a one kill vs 3 or 4 kills a match
---
Plus what us m1 killers are supposed to do? Tunnel the obsession and make them use mom early? Or mori them?
---
Its not good of a solution to a rather badly designed perk.
---
Exactly, 2 survs doing nothing, 1-2 going to heal the downed surv &amp; you can immediately start chasing the rescuer
---
Asphyxiate me father
---
Ikr, I'mma add you now I'm playing.
---
No thank you. I want Billy brought down a notch, but the amount of times you can drop a pallet in front of one and they'll be like "I AM BILLY, I BREAK PALLET, THIS KILLER HARD AND SKILLFUL" and wind up their full chainsaw rather than just kicking it buys a lot of time.
---
There I added you!
---
I actually like running Technician :( good for stealthy gen jockey
---
5 minutes and not a single gen done smh

What addon is it? I saw this for the first time the other day and thought it was a bug.
---
Rainbow map can still detect hatch.  
---
For hatch to spawn -&gt; Amount of gens left + Survivors Alive = 4
---
Only safe unhooks give tokens
---
Pretty sure Feng is her last name, in Chinese I think you state your family name before your given name.
---
Okay, so as far as that rule it's still the same now?
---
In reply to your ‚Äòedit‚Äô Reddit‚Äôs system sucks, if people have a opinion that not many people agree with, but it‚Äôs still valid, people downvote then you loose karma and then you can‚Äôt post in that sub-reddit, so people with opinions that aren‚Äôt ‚Äòmainstream‚Äô become silenced, so then there‚Äôs just a shit ton of one opinion :/
---
Rule of thumb is the number of people alive + 2 is how many generators have to be completed in order for the hatch to spawn. It will then open when there's either one survivor remaining, or a key is used to open it. Rainbow Maps unlock the ability to track black locks (aka the hatch) within an 8 metre range (which can be increased with addons).
---
This would make sense
---
The Hatch will become visible (*"spawn"*) whenever the number of fully repaired generators exceeds the number of living Survivors by 1: 
---
* 4 Survivors remaining: 5 repaired Generators / Exit gates are powered
---
* 3 Survivors remaining: 4 repaired Generators / 1 Generator left
---
* 2 Survivors remaining: 3 repaired Generators / 2 Generators left
---
* 1 Survivor remaining: Spawns and opens regardless of how many generators remain.
---
As for the rainbow map:
---
Both the rainbow map and the regular map (as long as they are equipped with a black silk cord) are able to track the hatch.
---
(All of this info was taken form the wiki)
---
You learn something new every day.
---
Thank you.
---
Besides the killer being able to close the hatch, yes.
---
I‚Äòm kinda sad that they changed this
---
But...you still had to be in a chase at some point. How could you barely break Bronze while getting Iridescent in everything else?
---
You can win without resorting to "toxic" practices, but only if the other side does the same.
---
&gt; What coudl the devs do? They already lose points for it
---
remove insidious. the perk has literally no use other than camping people.
---
I don‚Äôt get it, can someone explain?
---
I think it would be cool if they did get the rights for each scream killer, then each time a palette hit them a bit of the mask falls off then underneath it‚Äôs one of the killers from the tv show/film and it changes each time so one time it could be Jill from scream 4, then the next could be the original guy -I forgot his name
---
Thats why you dont listen to the reddit 4Heads, this list is ridicoulous
---
There are things in this game which are known to be anti-fun. Knowingly using them is kinda toxic.
---
It's like when Marth's depip squad got criticised for running old DS in friendly tournaments.
---
Wait... U mean DbD itself isn't a shitpost?
---
I never use rainbow maps, but it should show you an aura similar to totems and hook, I think.  
---
On the wiki, it says the map can track the hatch from a range of 8 meters. That could be increased, using the Stamp add-ons.
---
You can't grab someone with a key
---
Or during the EGC
---
they did a pretty goodjob
---
to this day why killer have one key for 3 different functions is beyond me. how fucking hard would it be to rebind to different keys, but then again its fucking BHVR, the same people who approved of legion.
---
Bubba is OP as hell in basement, because he can hit multiple people, i honestly love how Hillbilly is now, i love playing as him and i love to play vs him
---
Most every other killer? EVERY other killer, she is by atleast 100 miles the hardest killer to play. And i love her.
---
¬´2/3 innocent¬ª lmao. Thank you for making my morning OP, will start using this.
---
I used to be a killer main (mostly pig) but then switched to survivor because it's so much fucking easier.
---
Though that was before I completely stopped playing because the devs suck. From "Balancing" all the way down to monetization it all just sucks. 
---
&gt;and don't bitch about bias when you are obviously bias as well. Pot meet kettle
---
But if they were bots, they also would do the most logical thing, patrolling a hook when scratch marks are nearby.
---
Not me :)
---
I run bt whenever I play survivor for this reason. And as killer, tunneling is just playing smart most of the time.
---
Killer is way easier unless you are in a swf.I homestly dont remember the last time I killed less than 2 survivors.Solo survivor is a nightmare.
---
Nerfing top tier killers will only make survivor mains bigger assholes and queue times worse. WoW classic in August, BL3 in September, so go ahead, be my guest.
---
1 dead survivor &gt; 1 healing survivor.
---
He ran the chase for longer than 10 seconds, I imagine. You're supposed to let the killer down you as soon as he finds you.
---
I agree, also increase he OINKS
---
I hope he doesn‚Äôt come with a survivor, I want as many killers as possible so that we could get a new killer for the regular roadmap
---
Which is funny because one could argue that the entire character "Spirit" is also OP, and yet they do nothing.
---
By the previous guy and your logic, shouldnt Prayer Beads be nerfed in this patch? What exactly is the counter to being pulled off gens other than 100% just guessing or tapping? But only survivors can be OP...
---
clearly I‚Äôm talking about when the survivor isn‚Äôt dead
---
Same. His attitude is just garbage.
---
You can blame AngryPug for alot of that. He claims to be a decent killer main but 99% of the games he plays as killer is Insidious Leatherface who basement camps. He's made the act entertaining, so alot of his audience does it too.
---
I would have died. I sometimes even shake when the sound ingame changes.
---
Wow this has made me realise how much of a cool and clever logo this is
---
Ahhh. I am glad I joined the game when ds got reworked as it is now.
---
Do we start the pillar men theme yet?
---
But here's the problem, stealth isn't really meta right now
---
I agree but it is one of the best perks for stealth.
---
Lightweight, quick and quiet, adrenaline and lithe is my favorite build.
---
Bold of you to assume I try to save people when NOED is up lmao. 
---
But in a scenario where it's an average killer vs average survivors, he'll usually have 1 or 2 survivors sacrificed by the time we do all gens (assuming people don't let themselves die on the hook or DC, which is a huge issue when you play solo).
---
So the killer has the opportunity to get one more kill while you look for the doors and open one of them.
---
should just be a secondary effect of borrowed time
---
This is why penaltys should be a thing
---
You could always replace lightweight with something like Poised or Dance With Me. I think having no scratch marks at all is better than them disappearing faster
---
Thanks! 
---
Will definetly remeber that., cant really use poised as I didn't buy the plauge but will level up kate for dance with me.
---
Played a game where a Myers did this with insidious at the gate sadly no dead hard, scared the shit out of me
---
You cant grab at all. Hatch grabs are no longer a thing and jumping in interrupts the hatch close so if a survivor is at the hatch before its closed they win.
---
Fucking hell that made me choke on my own spit
---
Hate those guys, there should be a toxicness rank where toxic killers have to play against toxic survivors and let the rest play normal. 
---
The campers and tunnelers against the ragequitters and toxic swf with flashlights. Would be great.
---
That's a spicy build fam
---
People just hate playing against it
---
It's a good thing that one of greater builds is from a stock character that you don't have to grind constantly for.
---
Out of all the characters in the game, I think Meg has the best teachables. Not one of her perks can be considered bad.
---
Where's my boy Ace?
---
"you did 4 totems and missed one" story of my life.
---
 
---
I don't mind NOED being "OP", it's normal for killers to be stronger, but it would be nice to have a totem counter for solo survivors. On some maps, it's a complete nightmare to find the totems, even with Small Game (L√©ry's and the Game are the worst offenders for me). It's dumb that Thrill of the Hunt has a totem counter but Small Game doesn't.
---
you can grab during key. my bf did it once

Fucks up with that clown emoji?
---
Dude be respectful to others, dont play online with shit wifi
---
No, we need Brenda. Period.
---
This is why I stopped playing survivor with randos and decide to switch to killer
---
At least if they disconnected while I'm playing killer it'll compensate while survivors are extremely screwed as they have to do work for the person who left
---
This is the best lol
---
Yeah not to be an asshole but if you know you have bad WiFi you shouldn‚Äôt be hosting games. It‚Äôs such a disadvantage to the survivors and if you positively know then it‚Äôs just karma.
---
I unhook people as soon as they get hooked with BT if it's their first hook -- is this BM? Especially with friends, I usually count on them to add a minute or two where we can get some gens done. 
---
The way I see it, if one hook state = one gen, it's a great trade.
---
I agree with this so much.
---
There is some counter play to that. When I don't have a key/map I just linger around the exit gates and start opening one as soon as the hatch is closed. When I start hearing the killers heartbeat I hide without leaving scratches. Then I go back and open the exit gate. Of course that does not always work if the gates are close or the killer is Billy/nurse or has whispers, but it's worth a try.
---
I like Feng's teachables too it's a shame Technician is pretty useless though.
---
same thing happen to me! up against a spirit, all gens pop, was opening the gate then got the "match hasn't loaded because a player disconnected" screen. i assumed she dced but i didn't get any bps or pips. sucked cause it was a good game for me for once...
---
Exactly why I run a huntress build with nurses calling + deerstalker. Slug away, down rescuer, throw some hatchets back and all the sudden it's 3 down one up, and I'm chasing the last one.

Even if he bought the porn at his 50's it still implies that he used a horse to escape. I dont think that's important though. It seems like he had a caravan and even if he had a modern method to travel with the circus he wouldn't have that in a escape from the circus. It explains why he just snatched a horse and road out.
---
Man I wish I could create my own killer, 'The Salt' has a nice ring to it.
---
And yeah this is one of my most important moments in my 'dbd career' xD
---
If technician is changed to 100% sound reduction on missed skill checks maybe people will use it specially noobies.
---
Clown should be swapped with huntress... also LF should be D tier he is useless.
---
Lol currently at a cosplay con. Nobody has recognised me yet.
---
On a sidenote, anyone knows the artist of this art, or a link to the original?
---
It is if the whole team is doing it. You cant get hooked if the killer cant find anyone. Its just boring and uninteractive to play stealthy.
---
Oh god what have you done
---
Alright you're officially my enemy, I don't like your flair.
---
Me, I took the picture and edited it
---
She's not a killer. She's The Entity.

I think it's the other way around

Pallets not being loaded in for killers, like completely invisible but still able to break them and get stunned by them.

Lol that reaction image
---
Paper plate and some scribbles from a marker. Who would recognize that? 
---
I personally like the legion rework.
---
Haha I am kidding, honestly I play wraith a lot and MOM has screwed me a lot so I "mildly dislike the perk" but it's all fun and games until Bing bong boi brings a mori.
---
This image is cursed
---
Alright see you in the fog fam!
---
If they implement console cross pc thingy.. please I am begging please do it devs as all my friends play on Xbox.
---
I do a bit of everything, mainly getting the killers attention tho
---
What i never understood about NOED users: they're counting on losing the game to have the perk activate, why would you go to a match with that mindset?
---
&gt; Why is there any need for justification of using a perk? It's not "only X kind of person uses NOED/etc perk"
---
Use whatever you like but 90% NOED users i face are just plain bad at the game: Bad at map pressure &amp; chases and/or rely on tunneling/camping hooks. They use NOED to cheese their 1k and clearly do not have the will to improve their gameplay.
---
I say cheese because i mean it, if you're a newer player it's whatever but a seasoned killer using NOED is a sad sight. I don't use NOED or Ruin on any killer, i don't tunnel nor do i camp. I can 3-4k just fine without getting "gen rushed" at red ranks...
---
As much as it pains me to say it, I‚Äôd say Nea probably has the best cosmetics. :‚Äô)) I find myself playing her on occasion just so I can admire them tbqh...
---
Obviously its ash because you can wear ash's puppet.
---
I really hope they implement platform crossplay. All my friends are on PC and I'm lonely on Xbox.
---
Lag hits =/= hitboxes, no matter how much and how many people complain about it. You can't fix something that isn't broken.
---
People need to stop being stupid and understand the fact that, killer is playing with 0 ping so your character is always one or two steps behind from where you see in your screen (it depends on how high the ping is). 
---
There are some very specific scenarios where hitboxes are indeed not working as they should but this is not what people usually go around complaining about.
---
Ahh I get the feeling I have to play with randoms as going to discord is a straight no for me.
---
Feels bad   hope you find some new friends there!
---
Yeah I'll post one
---
I hardly play SWF unless it's duos because otherwise it's just too easy. I like the challenge of solo queuing and I did that before I made friends in the dbd community.

---
Looks like Baldi.
---
You can honestly play any killer and survivors will still find a reason to dc.
---
"Why don't you understand, I'm a bush" That killed me

My time spent training with No Mither, Diversion, Autodidact, and WGLF can finally be worth something. The training weights are off boys

They should add a different button to vault lockers in general... I'm surprised they didn't do it already.

You know? When I first played this game, I used to dread that sound. Not because of people DC'ing. No. It was because it was dedicated to when a killer moris a survivor. That "DUUUUUUN" was just so haunting. Especially when it was a Hillbilly mori. All you hear is a scream, silence and then... "DUUUUN" and, admit it, we all did it. We all acted like a character in a horror movie and had that "Oh shit" reaction on our faces. But now? Now I just get agitated. I hear it more from DC's then Mori's nowadays. Which is really sad. Such an impactful sound wasted on such a poor sportsmanship move
---
But this happened 24 days ago and I forgot to post it. And btw they have sent me some copy pasted messages and they didn't even copy paste something else, they literally sent me the same email twice. Thank you dev team!
---
115% while revving with Bubba is stupid tho... There would be no reason not to be revving all the time.
---
I find myself unable to actually escape within the duration of Borrrowed Time if the killer is currently chasing me - regardless of whether I absorb a hit under BT or the killer holds their strike until BT expires.
---
I mean when I play killer and someone gets unhooked right in my face, they don't escape on any map but cornfield; even if they do the whole annoying BT+Adrenaline+Mettle+Instant-heal shenanigan.
---
BT is just a way for someone to guarantee their WLGF stack, it's still BM unless the gates are open or you get the killer to chase you instead.
---
Meg would always be hella cute if they hadn't messed up her expression.
---
Its not because they disagree. Its because he's being kind of a douche.
---
Yeah, Clown is better than Spirit. In Fantasy Land maybe.
---
Lol accurate
---
I do the same. If I see someone get farmed I tunnel that shit all game 'till they're on the hook and I can facecamp them untill they die. I don't care if I lose at the point or not but as someone who regularly plays survivor this infuriates me.
---
You literally got downvoted for saying it's better to not tunnel, which is true 95% of times. 
---
Nice
---
Stupidity is very contagious, and common sense ironically isn't very common.
---
I refuse to do this even though I want to badly because I know with my luck I‚Äôll get banned after all the work I‚Äôve put into this game. I wish BHVR would simply tell EAC that file changes in the icon‚Äôs folders shouldn‚Äôt warrant a ban.
---
The point was sitting while face camping isnt fun. You've never heard a killer say "boy I really hate that I had to face camp you guys" because that's either 1 admitting you're terrible at the game or 2 that you dont know how to play correctly or a mixture of both. Neither of which will they admit. (Maybe the first one idk) the point still stands. He hooked a person, then did nothing while they died and your teammates did gens and escaped. It's not fun getting a 1k then shit on in post. It's not fun playing the game for 5 minutes then watching yourself lose. Noone is arguing who's fault it is (obviously the killers).
---
Lol
---
oh lordt imma have a heart attack!!
---
No, you can run Sprint Burst if you want, but it's very annoying to use, because you need to walk all the time for not wasting your Sprint Burst and if you wasted, then your SB will probably not come back untill you start a chase.
---
technician is a fantastic perk
---
Most survs don't realize the reduction in generator noise because they only experience it from their point of view where its still loud. 1 meter out and you cant hear shit its nuts
---
She can be easy mode. Depends on the players' skill level with her and the survivors you're going against.
---
 I certainly don't care about this topic as much as you so I'm not going to type up an essay, but what the entire point of my post was is that there are lots of instances of broken ass hitboxes with or without bad ping. Yes 50 is higher than 0, but 50 means theres only a delay of fucking .05 seconds lol. 0.05seconds would never cause hitboxes to be as bad as they are sometimes. Every single major DBD streamer I have ever watched knows about the terrible hitboxes, I sincerely hope you dont actually think they're all just wrong and you're solely right.
---
I too like majora‚Äôs mask
---
thats weird, judging by your name and flair i was expecting you to think the spirit was awful ;)
---
im guessing that placing a killer on the left or right side of each tier determines how far up they are? i had no idea. always just thought it was 'this lot are all A in no particular order' etc.
---
Next up, activation requirements for Adrenaline please
---
This is so stupid.
---
the killer has to kill three people before this can even happen, then after he does you are given the chance of a free escape. If he stops that and closes the hatch, why in the hell should you get another chance so easily??
---
They have a support team?
---
Shhhhhhhh! Stop telling people this please 
---
Thanks,
---
Survivor Main
---
Plus with Dead Hard you get temporary immunity to damage and the other 2 give you way more utility in chases.
---
Welcome to videogames.
---
That's mostly all you see, to be quite honest. I play both sides, but really I think killer is more fun sometimes. The problem with it is, survivors don't have a set of rules to play by, but the devs kind of soft handedly force a killer to play by theirs. Tunneling bad form, camping same, but literally they can flashlight click on a macro to disguise footsteps hurt players, whatever is clever. I don't get this game. It's hypocritical. One group is free to be as they wish, and the other is meant to play by a set of gentlemen's rules. The way I see it is, you're not a killer, you're just a slave to their fun.
---
Survivor bad give upvote
---
Until MoM is nerfed, then you'll probably want to replace it. Unless you play in to the new format of the perk.
---
Kill it with fire!
---
Google
---
its an easy qol fix, a basic feature.  so im supposed to do their jobs? ( and i also meant that any programmer could do it, its 3 lines of code) are you that much of a doormat?  If a restaurant forgets your fries do you be like its ok its not a that big a deal imma just go to their kitchen and cook it. rolf
---
I think you should be able to try to escape, but if you don't start doing so within like 10 seconds, then it's instant death, to stop the whole "Survivors purposefully wasting killers time" debate
---
I don't see why people don't like this idea. I personally love it. It would be awesome to see this implemented into the game.
---
&gt;do their jobs
---
You do realize you can configure the keybinds yourself in the settings. Just make it whatever‚Äôs more comfortable for you. That is literally the point of that feature.
---
run bitch! RUUUUUUUUUUN
---
I'm really mad that they're nerfing MoM. I'm not even a survivor main I play killer and Survivor equally. I haven't even got to try the perk as a survivor but I've experienced it as killer an it's really not that bad. The only people complaining about it are killer mains that are so sweaty they can't work around 1 extra hit. Everyone complaining about the perk probably never even plays survivor anyway so I don't get why BHVR is even seeing their argument as valid. It isn't
---
Get Jane because she‚Äôs pretty
---
What happened to self care?
---
You're poison
---
Ngl that sounds like a worst blood lust
---
I can tell you're a killer man and not very good at it from how bad you're complaining about this perk it's one hit
---
Jane is not a survivor anymore ???
---
Legion is definitely not worse then Freddy like everyone thinks. Trapper is probably lower too.
---
Nowadays killers lunge after i vault and still get a hit half the time, they don't even have to aim anymore because "juking was so op" back then just hold R2 and the auto aim kick in.
---
You can't win them all bro let it go
---
Yes. All maps having the same chance of holding the trial is something i want. I'm fine with playing a map i don't like(coldwind &amp; Haddonfield) so long as i don't keep constantly getting it over, and over, and over again(It's a rare trait i know(I don't even DC when i keep getting it, i just get un-enthused)).
---
the requirement is getting 5 gens. against good players that difficult enough. literally no one has a problem with adrenaline.
---
After healing speed was nerfed and Sloppy Butcher became a meta perk for killers, Adrenaline Rush is better than Self Care. It's just better to rush gens injured most of the time and against most of the killers than just wasting time healing.
---
Use FF at key moments, don't just spam it. You need to be able to down, and FF doesn't let you do that. Use it to catch up to a survivor, or to find a new target. That being said, don't underdo it either, otherwise you're literally an M1 killer. Use FF at the right time to stall the game when appropriate and to find survivors if need be. Otherwise, the usual M1 killer stuff applies: learn how to mindgame and loop efficiently, learn where survivors like to hide and congregate, and lastly patrol those fukken gens. Invest in perks like BBQ &amp; Chili, Hex: Ruin, and either the Enduring/Spirit Fury combo or (how I usually run Legion) use Monitor &amp; Abuse for that extra bit of stealth and combine with either Enduring or Bamboozle. 
---
Hope this helps.
---
Is this My Summer Car mode?
---
Can't hear you over the survivors REEEEEEing about NOED, Ruin, and BBQ.
---
When the ping is fine in the lobby, all game, then suddenly becomes unplayable when the gens are done, that is what we call a "special lag spike"
---
You can completely devastate a game in seconds with Hag if the survivors aren‚Äôt careful. Very fun killer to play if you play her right.
---
It's actually more than 4%. 4% is only the basis, the number of incapacitated survivors increase the chance.
---
That's why always someone kobe in slug builds (90% of the time in my experience)
---
Cold wind is okay now that they fixed it though.
---
It's called the Endgame Collapse. Killers can open the gate (though it's just the melee animation) or close the hatch, which powers the exit gates. There's a two-minute timer (indicated by the bar on top,) after which any survivors still in the trial are taken by the Entity and it counts as a kill.
---
If survivors are in the exit gate, timer speeds up, and if they're downed/hooked, it slows down.
---
It's basically a counter to survivors that don't leave. If you just leave normally, you won't have problems.
---
Seems about right. Halo for the win.
---
Fashion is heavily opinion based. Just enter the store and see which ones you like the most lol. Personally my most disliked costumes are for Ace followed by Adam, Im just not a fan of bathrobes and trenchcoats. On the other hand I really like Jeffs outfits and here is how I like my Jeff to look like [https://imgur.com/hVuwI1X](https://imgur.com/hVuwI1X). I also like Shirtless David with red pants and his basic bearded face.
---
You can also intentionally DC without playing the sound effect by pulling your ethernet cable, I've found.
---
I hate Deliverance being absolutely useless if you never get an unhook or if you only get an unhook after you've already been put on the hook.
---
Several times I'll bring Deliverance and some other survivor will rush in and snatch the unhook, or I'll be unlucky enough to go down first and immediately get hooked, rendering the perk completely useless.
---
this is a long thread. it was just a joke. sorry
---
Dwight has got some wild stuff. His pizza bicycle outfit is definitely the best.
---
Probably a group of kids. It is summer time, they do have a lot of time off. The reason I say kids is because that sounds like some shit I would do when I was in high school.
---
32 seconds self-care heal, 40 seconds if the killer has sloppy butcher.
---
Reading is hard.
---
Especially when the reading is in a fucking video.
---
Huntress isn't even top 3. top 3 are billy, spirit and nurse. hag and Huntress are 4/5.
---
(laughs) Yo, if y'all are watching this tape right now, that means I didn't make it. If I'm a prisoner or worse, dead. Anyhow, I'm gonna tell you the rules to survive this situation. Rule number 1: you gotta be quick. Rule number 2: DON'T fall down. And rule number 3: whatever you do, NEVER LOOK BACK! Y'all wish me luck... RUSH THE GENS!!!
---
They fixed it how?
---
I love this combo.
---
People at higher ranks abuse it a lot. It sucks.
---
If I hit someone with Franklin's, a lot of the time they'll dead hard past my next swing back to their item, pick it up and- wouldn't you know it, they stop moving and their internet connection drops. 
---
Crazy coincidence.
---
1. this would be so bad because this would take out 90% of the ability to counter play around pallets also the base saw takes longer to charge then normal kicking 
---
* LF dose move slower while charging but McLean seid that he has LF buffs in his wish list for things he wants at some point (don't expect this any time soon)  
---
if you got rid of the ability to chainsaw pallets would get rid of curving and i love curving  btw i'm a billy main with 2K hours
---
I've had several "teammates" like this &amp; for the most part, it's just an eyeroll. They might have an "escape as" daily &amp; have had several bad games, I don't know.
---
I don't mind dying for people if they haven't played like an asshole (like intentionally farming or sandbagging,) and have frequently distracted the killer to protect teammates who've been tunneled, more than a few times which resulted in my death but their escape.
---
But personally, I'd always prefer to go for the save.
---
No more see-through tiles.  
---
Sure, you can have strong setups, but they aren't nearly as strong as they previously were.

---
Wrong, i've been a trapper main since i started this game and I nearly have 1k hours
---
That's fine by me.
---
The original maps are usually the most balanced ones. I hate when I get Lery's, Swamps, Yamaoka or The Game. 
---
I would hate if they increased the likelihood of getting put in the new maps.
---
DBD is the only game where you expect the other side to not play like an asshole. DBD isn't a competitive game so once people start tryharding it's extremely frustrating for both sides. If a killer is camping or tunneling that poor survivor should get extra BP for his time. 
---
I just love when a killer tunnels some dude and he dies with 6k pts. Do you think that guy had fun or it was gg for him? I'd never do that to someone when I play killer. The killer can get a 0k and still have 20k+ points, its a joke.
---
Nah.. I Like it ( heavily emphasis on I)
---
Overall. They really nerfed his power, so basically you can loop him and he's just low tier but what I like is you can get the first hit really really easy. So with stun reduction addons if they're out in the open, you can down them fast
---
He has decent.. Ehh.. Kinda average map pressure but not gonna lie he was nerfed, with the stun increased from 3sec to 4 sec in ptb (don't know why) and then they nerfed his stun addons (don't know why either)
---
Basically they want us to stop playing him but I love him and since he's 115, he's overall good.
---
If you have the mind games, downing people is easy
---
In my opinion, getting non DLC maps in a row is the best thing I can ask for as killer.  
---
The only DLC maps that don't suck are the Asylum ones, and one of them is on the condition survivors don't hug the main building.
---
I was just about to say something similar. When you have 1000-3000 viewers on a regular basis and all you play is insidious LF, this build is gonna pick up in popularity.
---
A, To clarify, i've been playing only killer today. B, I'm talking about dealing with corn, cow tree &amp; that horrific jungle gym in the corner.
---
claud doesn't give a fuck and fast vaults over the god pallet.
---
It's a very annoying thing tbh. I had a Hag do that to me on Red Forest, I literally got up, went downstairs, got a drink, made a sandwich, came back and she was *still* Mori-spamming me.
---
Then she apologized after because she "meant" to do it to the other Nea, the one who'd brought a key. Apparently my medkit looked like a key.
---
I'm already blocked by someone on here? Nice (The only other person that commented)
---
Which jungle gym?  
---
Cow tree isn't as bad anymore, as long as you loop it the right way.  
---
Corn was never a problem.
---
Don't have thantaphobia, but his build requires ultra rare addons and if a killer needs ultra rare addons then it's gonna be a no for me
---
I pretty much started playing him without addons and
---
BBQ and ruin and noed on him as... Why not I am level 13
---
You forgot Haddonfield :)
---
Pro tip: use kindred. If you are fed up with facecampers, this perk will destroy them. It might not solve you being facecamped but it‚Äôs guaranteed to ruin the killers game.
---
And what are you hoping to accomplish?
---
I've been saying this for a while. BT should be a game mechanic, killers don't have to tunnel or camp. The problem is they think "if I don't get a 4k I LOST" no, a 2k is a win you'll be fine.
---
Yeah, i know. BHVR will EVENTUALLY do something({x} doubt) like seeing if anything that could cause a surv to pull the plug, would have happened RIGHT as a surv DC'd through connection loss. And if someone keeps losing connection at suspicious times, they get the same treatment as those who DC all the time do, you know... when they also get punished...
---
Leatherface paragraph 2 : Bride of Bubba
---
Why is Plagues ma stereotype I'll main Ghostface am I missing something?
---
That's how it used to be. However, it wasn't necessarily ideal for most people since there are realms with only one map. You end up playing Haddonfield, Badham, Lery's, and The Game far too often. 
---
If those realms had even just one extra map each it would be better, but back when the map was decided by realm first, it was annoying seeing the same exact map come up all the time. 
---
I guess it comes down to whether you'd prefer getting different maps from the same realms more often, or getting the same maps from different realms.
---
Ah, you wanted BBQ? Here, take Monstrous Shrine instead.
---
Can someone explain the ending? Haven't had this problem so idk what they say.
---
THE PLAGUE SO ACURATE HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
---
Corn blindness is a thing. I have it, and it sucks. Cow tree isn't bad per'se, it's just a really long loop, &amp; the jungle gym i'm talking about is the one with a normal gym, but with the side wall pushed out a bit &amp; an added window that spawns in the corner of the map in no building coldwind.
---
Also going to mention that the killer can also use the red lights on the gate to easily know where you are
---
Goddamn Aces and their chest hacks!
---
That's one of his perks, when activated survivors within 20 meters gain 150% movement speed but gives you the exposed effect
---
No they absolutely should just make it so you don't instantly die on the hook if you're the last one. since killers are going to hold the game hostage until the end game collapse happens we should be able to hold the game hostage when we're on the hook.
---
I've had this happen as a survivor on PS4. I was downed by a Spirit on Haddonfield, before EGC was a thing, and I escaped and got points for escaping, but my boyfriend saw her carry me to a hook &amp; hook me, and I was even struggling... despite having long-since escaped on my screen.
---
How it be when you lead the killer right towards the cloaked Claud you didn't see.
---
A long wall?  
---
You get over corn blindness, I look for general movements.  
---
You might want to check out [ScottJund's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ) on looping tiles.
---
Coz plague is boring
---
Sorry I play in console I forget nurse exists half the time.
---
I for one welcome our new Cursed Suffering overlords.
---
Actually, the one that is like a "worse unrelenting" gives you a really low cooldown on missed attacks. Borderline Mad Grit except all the time, that's the one I'm concerned with.
---
Ok still how does that relate to Ghostface at all? I personally enjoy Plague don't get how she is boring
---
Have a red arrow
---
It's the commands for copy them paste. Just giving him. A blanket statement saying he'll never get legacy or old event cosmetics back.
---
No it isn't. Probably a bug.
---
I love this :')
---
I'd get my add-ons if I could stop getting splinters for killers I have
---
I get that, I too play on console. you don't see them very much + most of them are bad but once in a while you face a really good nurse.
---
"Some". Interesting choice but unnecessary.
---
well they must have been there before you bought him.
---
I played 1000 hours had every Killer from the start and never saw a single Splinter
---
Reminds me of the time when I played Freddy, as I was taking a guy into the basement and I saw scratch marks out the wazoo down there. After hooking the guy I went towards the locker in back left corner and found a Kate. Surprised she didn't DC off that, best part was that the guy was dead on hook anyway lol.
---
Add on the fact that every single killer runs BBQ, and they always get double points.
---
I don't actually mind Game that much as surv. It's not that bad, 2 juicy double pallets on either side of the map &amp; pallets that are safer than the god pallet. I do get where you're coming from, but i'm fine with playing realms with 1 map, so long as i don't ALWAYS get that realm, which most likely won't happen if the game chooses realms(thank you for reminding me of the term "realm" btw, i knew there was a word for it, i knew i knew it, but i wrote this post just after the breaking point &amp; it slipped my mind completely). I also would like to see different environments while playing.
---
Pointless? I always struggle for my survival points every time. because there's no other way to earn them in game other than healing yourself. The others are killer dependent
---
They couldn't be there before I bought him if I bought Leatherface first
---
I‚Äôve already answered this question a few times over and other responses. Try looking for them.
---
You will keep the gatekeeper emblem you've received after closing the hatch.
---
it's probably worth noting that the only splinters I've seen are for Leatherface and he's the only killer I bought with auric cells
---
HOPE IS DOPE
---
i understand that reference!
---
I did read the data. On average, even with a 4 man SWF, you chances of survival is LESS THAN 50%. 
---
It‚Äôs even worse if you‚Äôre solo, like I was. 
---
How about you try ‚Äòunderstanding‚Äô the data.
---
This comment and post can not be more true
---
‚ÄúThree Dwights huh?‚Äù
---
*WINK CLICK CLICK*
---
OINK OINK
---
referring to coldwind as corn, i see you too are a man of culture
---
Completely disagree. Survivors have been running the game since its creation.
---
WAZAAAAAAAAAAAAP! Perk, call the killer and have him alert his presence by yelling at survivors to pick up the phone
---
^^they're ^^only ^^maining ^^plague ^^because ^^she's ^^the ^^newest ^^killer
---
Ah shit you got me
---
please check the wiki. it says that you can only get them for Killers you dont have
---
sorry ill delete the post immediately
---
Good point but still it's such an order choice would've it be better to put it for Pig?
---
pig isnt the newest killer?
---
Still though it makes more sense as he has her and Micheald ability in two. Just saying it would make more sense to people
---
I think you‚Äôre complaining about playing the game as intended... when did gamers get so lazy?
---
When games allowed people to just buy anything they wanted instead of earn it.
---
youre not getting it... the joke is that people only main plague because they will main whoever the newest killer is regardless of their playstyle. theyre not particularly interested in the plague its just because she is the most recent killer added to the game. they will main ghostface next because then *he* will be the newest killer.
---
Yeah, I still gotta say I remember every time I've kobed, and every kind *person* playing killer who's respected the 4% chance. End game chat always looks like this with People like rhat: "it's cool, man. I play survivor. I understand "
---
That‚Äôs what Claudette mains do. As soon as the killer enter‚Äôs the terror radius, she blends in so the other survivor takes the punishment. Selfish mains.
---
I think a double pack with both Brenda and Cindy would do really well tbh
---
Are you sure? I never heard of that
---
They could talk back and forth to each other
---
Ik, but loops are survivors only defense against killers, so in that vain isnt he one of the best killers in a chase? Unless you absolutely suck at bottle placement there is nothing you can do to really prolong the chase unlike other killers
---
...we always had to earn in games. It‚Äôs called having a reason to play. Leveling up, getting that 100% completion, or finding secrets, etc. micro transactions made everybody lazy

Well I know you can remap it sort of. I heal with a different button than I throw pallets with. But I still throw pallets and get in lockers with the same button because it's technically the same type of action

well th3 grind in this game is extreme and this Change doesnt change anything about the Gameplay, so it really has no downside
---
Ik I get it but I was just saying IMO it would maybe fit pig better but I still think the joke works
---
Wait... how does this guy know about the spirit one?
---
Telling objective facts = being a douche?
---
wat
---
dbd on switch (leaked footage)
---
I know exactly how it works. That's why it doesn't give me trouble. You'd just rather whine than play around it.
---
If they did this i would quit dbd. Idk how many hours i have but i have been playong quite a bit since its been free on ps4 in August, I am devotion 5 or 6 lol 85 and I have nothing I really want to spend bp on. I play surv more than killer and have 4 characters at p3 with every perk along with 3 other characters p3 with most perks and every other surv at lvl 50. On the killer side I have every teachable unlocked with most killers at lvl 40-50 and my killer main has almost every perk unlocked. If you enjoy the game and play it its completely possible to get in a spot where you feel comfortable with what you have unlocked. Like I said I am at a point where I am just lvling things up just because, not because I want or need to. So if there is even less reason for me to have bp then idky I would even play this game
---
Thanks for the tip! I don't have pig yet, but she's on my wish list
---
Still the same - it feels bad for the rest of the team. It's just how things are
---
we all know... you degenerates belong on a cross
---
It literally just gives everyone all the perks instead of earning it.
---
Aren't you complaining about us complaining. ironic
---
These are the rules I live by after obtaining BBQChill on my unprestiged Hillbilly
---
1. Try getting a killer to P3 lv 50, 
---
2. Play as another killer with BBQChill
---
3. Using up all the bp you earn to force feed bp to it until you get BBQChill.
---
4. Once that perk is obtained you can play that P3 Lv50 killer.
---
I have all teachables so sometimes I have hundreds of useful add-ons by the time I get BBQChill on the next killer and then I‚Äôm ready to move on to the next killer.
---
Heh. I like this guy
---
People are frustrated and are allowed to use this subbredit in a cathartic way.
---
Totally agree. With nurse it's either an easy escape or total devastation, depending on the skill of who's playing her. A competent nurse is terrifying.
---
I can't believe they did it. Zubat and Noob both got banned for trying to get it back. It is so stupid.
---
Wow, you're so cool and clever
---
You may think I'm complaining, and I don't blame you for this. But let be honest : there are so much people who can't play video games for a long time, because they have to go to work/study, they have to take care of their family, their house etc... They have barely 1 hour or 2 to play by day if they are lucky.
---
Take example of Rainbow Six Siege : at first we had to unlock all the weapons attachments, and then they make attachments available for free, now the R6 in-game money is for buying skins or new agents.
---
Inaccurate, I exclusively play survivor yet the Spirit one still applies.
---
She can throw those traps down so quickly, they often have no idea you've done it. I was chucking them down mid pallet loop and the poor unfortunate souls fell right in. Mwahaha
---
Im just saying it's quite hypocritical
---
you earned them by unlocking them once.
---
Unlocking them over and over and over again is just mind numbing and tedious grind
---
Funny thing is I didn't even knew for sure. Just had my guessings becouse of how long it took him to get EW3
---
So, what does M1 and M2 mean, anyways? I've seen it here and on DBD YouTube videos.
---
To get the Killer to follow then chase me for a couple of minutes whilst the injured Survivor heals up and everyone else does gens.
---
This template is fantastic.
---
Why? Each killer is different and should be separate from others, you should earn each build for a killer or survivor instead of just leveling up one and getting everything for the other 17
---
I usually just stand by an exit gate and spam 2 towards the killer so he gets to end my suffering. I'll get chased towards a hook too if it makes things faster. There are players spectating right now that are just waiting to fling shit and salt in post-game chat and it's rude to keep them waiting.
---
No, but I am saying it‚Äôs stupid to not acknowledge the fact the killer has a clear advantage in the race to find the hatch. It is not equal. Are you disagreeing?
---
I fully agree with everything here play with your food is completely useless unless you're going for tombstone Myers
---
To be fair I think Noob3 admitted cheating in flashlights or something.

---
His second ban was for... Something, he never stated what. I too suspect it was item hacks.
---
There really should be something for survivors to just give up or something to just nope the fuck out of a slugging asshole.
---
Also Tapp is pretty quiet
---
each Survivor is the same, so why would anyone Level multiple?
---
Also as the game grows, the Grind will get more ans more, so why not at least remove the Tiers if perks and just unlock one complete perk each time
---
Thats just Nea Don't be afraid **"Be Afraid" - NEA**
---
I say some because I know not all survivors are bad
---
So s1 and 4 could have gotten either s2 or 3 up while the killer dragged the other to the basement.
---
S4 took 2 minutes to find the totem (time on hook) and then rushed in the basement, where the killer was camping with one survivor nearly dead?
---
That in itself is a bad choice, but still could be possible if S4 was fully healed up.
---
If he takes a hit, unhooks and then takes a second hit the other survivor can use the time to get out. But no matter how you play this out one survivor will die down there unless his MoM would be ready, or the other survivor has DS.
---
The point is, if s1 and s4 would have reacted better the killer would have gotten 1K, if S4 would have reacted better after the first mistake the killer would have gotten 2K. 
---
He got 3K not because of noed, or his camping, but because the survivors played into his hand.
---
Now i don't encourage camping or like it for that matter, but if people keep feeding this behaviour with points it won't end.
---
Where is Ash and Jane
---
Losers disconnects against anything
---
You forget the fact we have to pay or grinding to get the new characters, and most of us grind for iridiscent shards, so where is the problem if the perks become available for all characters once we unlock the 3 tiers of them ?
---
Mehhhg
---
Whats your nat type when using lan?
---
sounds like a feature to me
---
To be fair
---
Type 2
---
Actually the wiki doesn't say anything about them
---
Left click and right click. Basically, normal attack vs. ability.
---
When playing killer for some reason I see a lot more kobes than I do when playing survivor
---
Thanks :)

You're delusional. Legion isn't DC-able anymore. Getting a Legion is a treat because most of them are terrible so it's like facing an M1 killer with no power. Just because I found a negative comment funny, doesn't mean I DC against Legion. What kind of mental gymnastics did you perform to come to that sort of conclusion?
---
Well what I said still stands those bone splinters were obtained while owning Leatherface
---
I don‚Äôt get the doctor one though
---
Good for you, but not everyone have the same time you get to play. And even with this new system you should have to grind for the killers add ons.
---
The point is that the movement speed can be gained rapidly, and carries over from a chase allowing you to move about more efficiently, but forces you to forgo actually damaging survivors if you want to retain max speed, in the same way that Play With Your Food currently does. Losing two token for hitting a survivor, based on these numbers, is a difference of just 4% movement speed, and can be regained in just 10-14 seconds. The penalty is negligible to the point that it eliminates the decision making aspect of the perk. The penalty needs to be heavy if it's going to offset the risk of allowing a survivor to escape unharmed. It works in a similar way to bloodlust, but it has some advantages over it. It starts stacking earlier and more consistently, it doesn't end when exiting a chase, and it doesn't end after destroying a pellet. And let's not forget the fact that this would also stack with bloodlust.
---
I haven't been playing the longest but I've yet to not get tbagged at the gates by a single survivor.
---
There‚Äôs a reason she is top 3 killer in kill rates :) Glad you enjoy her! I would also second getting Pig Teachables for her. Make Your Choice is great with dried cicada and you are less inclined to ‚Äútunnel‚Äù since you can one shot the rescuer. On some more advanced builds, Surveillance + Mint Rag pretty much assures a 3K min since they won‚Äôt ever be able to finish a gen without you knowing it‚Äôs being worked on and teleport instantly. Also recommend Monitor and Abuse and maybe try out the ‚ÄúBody Blocker‚Äù build with Scarred Hand and Turtle Egg to change it up every now and then.
---
*happy snap noises*
---
Yes please. I had a match where the killer just, refused to hook anyone. He'd slug 3 of us, let us pick each other up, then repeat. I stood right in front of a hook &amp; pointed at it, and he shook his head no and slugged me again. The whole match took more than half an hour before 3 of us bled out. It wasn't fun. I'd have much preferred to just give up.
---
There are clearly some frames missing in this video...
---
... it breeds?
---
Well I provided evidence why that isnt true.
---
You just have "trust me bro" point
---
I thought his two bans were showing exploits and the legacy hack. Did he just admit to the legacy hack but do extra stuff on top of that?
---
even dbd streamers do this, what can you expect? it's pure cringe and i'm super embarrassed for the people who act like that lol
---
Nerfed =/= Make it not garbage for farmer assholes
---
I could post the entire game if you wish
---
Just play without the perks, the grind has been reduced a lot since the game came out and honestly, after you get a few perks to tier 3 as long as they aren't trash your ok.
---
I have a problem with adrenaline, you didn't do anything to achieve those 5 gens though necessarily. Could spend the whole game urban evading around the edge of the map and you are still rewarded with a free sprint burst and heal when the 5th gen gets done.
---
That isnt a personal requirement thats a team requirement. Delivrance, MoM actually require you to have done something that game.
---
Why not make it so you are required to DO a generator to activate it? Maybe have been hooked? Escaped chases with the killer? Things that cause you to secrete adrenaline in real life, currently its just a fuck you perk to the killer. 
---
-Oh the survivors got all 5 gens done, thats bad for me as killer. Oh look all the survivors got free heals and sprint burst as well thats also bad for me as killer.
---
Equips NOED
---
All survivors bitch them out for using NOED which is the only viable counter to adrenaline. 
---
"literally no one has a problem with adrenaline" sounds like a survivor ideal honestly. At red ranks the survivors get all the gens done in no time, if you somehow manage to murder them all with 12 hooks before the gens are done you either played like a complete cunt or the survivors were boosted / trolling.
---
The most insistent critique no one asked for.
---
I'm the same rank for both. Rank 11
---
Still the only survivor I play. Sorry Meg, bit Feng is my Waifu.
---
He's using the map add-on that lets you place a beam marker anywhere that only survivors can see
---
Short for Mouse1 and Mouse2, common names for keybinds referring to Left Click and Right Click in PC gaming
---
most people will dc against a 3 gen doc because it's just boring to go against
---
As a Doctor main, he ISN‚ÄôT easily loopable. With a well timed shock I can deny 90% of the vaults/pallet drops by the first/second loop if I dont mindgame
---
**I'm scared**
---
The showed the hit box in a stream once, its massive, out sized the hatchet.
---
The doctor one means that he only just uses his weapon not his ability and completely forgets about it
---
J-j-j-just shut up. üòÇüòÇ btw you're wrong, cuz I fantasized about it 11 times! üòÇ
---
That would be funny lol.
---
But tbf I've seen people dc often against all killers now, not just legion.
---
I did not miss the point of the post, it's just pretty sad that you think DC'ing is acceptable if the killer is camping and/or doing anything you as a survivor might dislike.  
---
It's so sad, in fact, that I chose to completely ignore it, because why would I ever respect such an opinion as a valid one?
---
r/unexpectedfalloutnewvegas
---
_You husband now._
---
Uh, well thats just not true. Unless its not their main
---
^*nut*
---
I don't care about winning, I care about fun; I wouldnt play low tier killers if I cared. 
---
A perk that punishes (already weak) m1 killers and doesnt do much against high tier/instadown killers is just unbalanced. 
---
I love the concept of MoM, I'm using it myself when I play survivor, but the way it is right now seems just... Wrong.
---
Just my personal opinion.
---
Seconded. One or two teabags isn‚Äôt nothing, a little taunting is healthy I‚Äôd say, but everything in excess, right? If you teabag at every opportunity you‚Äôre just being an immature toxic douchebag.
---
Field of view is nice plus I don't have many perks only starting to learn her now
---
I'm not defending toxic behavior, but I'd  rather be slugged for two minutes than  in a hatch standoff for an indefinite amount of time. The EGC also eliminates having to wait four minutes to bleed out in the Dying State.
---
The words of a true philosopher
---
Start a collection with screenshots of facecamping killers. It's fun
---
Gonna be honest, when I inevitably make the switch in (several) months, I'm *definitely* hacking in my Bloodpoints. I've been playing on Console since a few months after the Console release. No way in hell I'm starting that grind all over again.
---
Yeah, but it was completely fine when survivors held games hostage for much, much longer.
---
Yeah you could. Easily, i make mistakes a lot. The difference is i own them and try to learn from them, i don't blame the killers perks or the way they chose to play the match. Sure getting camped or tunneled sucks, and it's understand able to be salty about it, but trying to get the game changed out of a salty reaction is where i draw the line.
---
This is not hindsight at all, i'm not trying to point out the all the mistakes to put you down, but to make you realize it's not the camping, or the noed, it's how people react to them.
---
And as for S4 trying to win, if he had just left that would give the killer about 8k points. That's a loss already.
---
By going on a suicide mission it probably gave the killer top points and made him win the round, despite using a cheap tactic.
---
Thank you!
---
Fair point, I just hate getting screwed over every time I do bring it and then regretting every time I don't bring it.
---
It really depends on whether the survivors in your game think it‚Äôs good to heal against legion. 
---
I don‚Äôt have to explain this any further, you know what the perks do. I personally run sloppy and think SB is the right choice. 
---
Each are situationally good though.
---
It's about everything in life really - there is an action and there's a reaction. You're completely responsible for your own actions and partially for reaction it creates. So, if a person deliberately throws everybody else under the bus, that person earns negative reaction, whenever they care about it or not.
---
Of course I didn't say people are obliged to respect each other by law literally. My message was different: they shouldn't be surprised that they are being disliked as a result.
---
You cant im fucking blind rn
---
Truth tho
---
Where were all you guys when killers just wanted a simple concede button to end the game when stuck with dudes playing super stealth and dragging out already lost games for 15-20 minutes for no reason?  Maybe if they had gotten some support then, we wouldn't have the endgame the way it is now.  But, nah, fuck killers being whiny, if they can't handle dicks dragging out their game for half the day, they should just not play, right?
---
as long as she has a perk that annoys the killer so much, the other survivors get fed up with her instead and kill her themselves so that it reflects how she died in the movie.
---
Hmm. Maybe it's something like Doctor madness? Game starts, you're at Sleep Tier 1 where Freddy can't do shit to you and you can't see him. Staying in the lullaby or getting pulled into the Dream World manually puts you a Sleep 2, where Freddy can hurt you. Sleep 3? You're blind. Sleep 4? You're exhausted. Sleep 5? Exposed.
---
Go down sleeps by taking medicine or blowing skill checks. Can't leave Sleep 2.
---
Then again, I'm not a game designer. I suppose we'll see in a couple weeks, hm?
---
Yeah because slugging someone and letting them sit there to bleed out is so "adult" like... gtfo...
---
A killer will dc just because you have a dlc character or have on purchased clothing. Anything that makes it look like your good at the game
---
1). Probably not smart to insult videogames in a subreddit centered on one
---
2). DbD isn't a casual game if you are playing it competitively, and getting Prestige Legacy would have taken *days* of grinding, which yes, *is* difficult to do since not everyone has the time or persistence.
---
Begone, troll.
---
Really just two situations- axes and chainsaws
---
Be thankful you weren't here for pallet vacuums 
---
Imagine the nurse but its survivors teleporting to pallets
---
I don't know why they don't just let MoM stacks be earned normally but only consumed when you take a hit for someone.
---
Wuahhh i cant wait 3 minutes doing nothing
---
Wuaaahh i cant tbag no more
---
Wuahh my mom is getting nerfed
---
Seriously let killers have some fun
---
Dream World manipulation is what I'm hoping for!!!
---
To be honest, I wouldn‚Äôt trust the steam location indicator. You can set your location to anything you want at the click of a button. Just dodge the lobbies with high ping and you‚Äôll find a good match within 2 or 3 tries
---
The Hag is so accurate. Jesus.
---
Why have a hatch standoff in the first place??.. go do a gen...  this argument is stupid
---
Not everyone did that. So punish everyone for what a few did.. seems legit !!
---
"It's so sad, in fact, that I chose to completely ignore it"  
---
"you *really* need to work on the way you talk to people."
---
Hypocrisy at it's finest right there.  
---
Yeah, I called people out who said "HuR JusT dO GenZ!" when you can CLEARLY SEE in the picture that every non-hooked survivor is doing gens. People are making shits of themselves by posting what they believe if a fix to the problem, when it was already being implemented in the game. I also called people out who made incorrect assumptions of how to game ended who didn't read any of the full descriptions. commenting before reading is like taking a test without having read the chapter, you're likely to fail.   
---
I think the worst part of this is that you made the false assumption that I DC'd from this game, or that I do it regularly. Neither is true. I've already explained to a few people in detail how this game played out in full, because I REMAINED in the game. I sympathize a lot with survivor DC's because facecampers (or close patrollers) and tunnelers ruin their games, always only walking juuuuuuust far enough away that you can still hear their TR. I don't WANT my teammate facecamped because I know they're likely to DC, and I don't WANT that to happen because I'm down a teammate, and I DON'T blame my teammate for it. I don't believe it's okay to say "Yeah, this one player get's to completely ruin someone else's experience in this game." and I don't think it's childish that people would rather DC and not let the killer become over-rewarded for doing this either. At that point you go from being a player in a game to a doll they get to farm points off of. Fuck that noise.
---
They‚Äôre trying to fix the hit ones so hopefully they won‚Äôt be huge anymore, they stated some things that might be the cause in their dev update
---
No... the whole point of struggling on hook is so that it is uncomfortable, a ‚Äústruggle‚Äù to keep yourself alive.
---
Ehh... Everyone I talked to him on this sub, he seems snarky and frustrated, I don't know but not everyone is targeting the guy.
---
It's not documented, but you can test, slug every one and start hooking. Or maybe is just because all off then will try.
---
But it's like 9 out 10 games someone will do it
---
nightmare on elm street 5 just isnt that good im sorry
---
its not underrated its rated at its level 
---
its the second worst in the series. 2 is worse but thats only because 2 is so goddamn boring! if they had done the interesting ideas they had in that film and jazzed up the script so it could keep the audience awake then 2 would have been a classic. 
---
anyway at least part 5 had some cool deaths
---
yeah curving is the only way to play billy against good survivors. Backrevving usually doesn‚Äôt work against them does it
---
For Billy boi you meant to put "that's it I'm getting me mallot"
---
Wrong post?
---
Who is saying that that was fine? Seriously, I see people make this same stupid comment every time someone complains about EGC but I‚Äôve never seen anyone actually try to defend or justify survivors holding the game hostage. It was bannable so even the devs disapproved of it, even to the point that they changed the whole endgame because of it. Nobody with a brain thought it was fine when survivors did it and nobody should approve of killers doing it either.
---
I'm pretty sure on stream he said it was for item hacking flashlights for videos. 
---
He also said he's never doing any hacking again cause it isnt worth it.
---
no insidious Bubba 0/10
---
His face gives my Bing Bong joy.
---
I don‚Äôt play much pig but I definitely think she‚Äôs an awesome killer, and matches against pigs are usually fun.
---
Thought this would wind up showcasing Survivors who say the killer sucks and is terrible at the game after killing everyone. 
---
  
---
I am disappoint.
---
It's really more sided towards whoever finds it first.
---
Unless the Survivor has a key or you get extremely shitty gate spawns, for the most part you can patrol the gates and see them before they get the gates opened. It takes a solid 20 sec to open gates and the bright red lights are a dead giveaway that they're either working on the door or nearby, but if you spot them before the gate is completely finished, they're done for.
---
The EGC was designed to make the end game not last for 20+ min like it had in the past, and honestly I think (no meme) they did a pretty good job on it.
---
Well to each their own. Was it seemingly a little sudden? Perhaps. But considering how much she went through from losing Viserion then losing Jorah, then losing Rhaegal and then Messandei. Finding out Tyrion has failed you ‚Äúin her mind‚Äù a few times, Varys backstabbed her and the man she loves has betrayed her request and told the information she wanted kept secret, I‚Äôd say her going nuts wasn‚Äôt that shocking when you put all that into perspective. She is experiencing all kinds of setbacks, betrayal, sadness, loss all within a short span and she clearly couldn‚Äôt handle it.
---
Again....I don't care about that. Endgame would be fine if it meant you just died once you were the last survivor and got downed. That's literally all I'm saying. I don't want matches dragging out period. It's why I hated hatch stand offs so much
---
It's 16% I'm pretty sure. It was going to be 24% for the 2.6.0 PTB but they reverted it back to 16% with the official release of patch 2.6.0. but changed the way it accumulated.
---
It's 4% per injured survivor so 4 injured survivors will make it 16%
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Thanatophobia
---
there is this 10 seconds in it tho
---
Survivor sided SubReddit, the killer mains that are on here are clearly not the best. It‚Äôs more efficient for points, rank, and game progression, if you can catch the farmer. I don‚Äôt mind the downvotes, I know what I can and do accomplish in the game.
---
Not a single person I've seen thinks holding the game hostage is ok. Not once did I say it was ok. Jesus christ, stop defending toxic behavior
---
No with the recent-ish change to Thanat, it's only 16% at max rank with all Survivors injured/dying/hooked. 4% per Survivor.
---
Dude it takes like 20 seconds to open a gate. That‚Äôs more than enough time to check on two gates. Besides you also don‚Äôt have to close hatch right away. You can camp it until you have an indicator of where the survivor is, and then close it. Also if you get in a chase with them, they are dead no matter what from end game collapse. Don‚Äôt take this as me saying the hatch is killer sided, but it is absolutely not survivor sided.
---
You say that like the same argument doesn't apply here as well. I've only had one killer do it and it was on the patch day because, I assume, he wanted to check out the entity sacrifice animation.
---
It used to be miserable for ever killer but nurse due to the see through tiles. It‚Äôs at least playable now.
---
Thank you!!! Finally some sense!!! If you have 2 injured survivors at minimum 2 are distracted for the moment, at max all 4!
---
&gt;How do you fix something that is not broken?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Laggy hits are not the same as broken hitboxes, no matter how much and how many people complain about it.
---
this is why shooters have lag compensation, so the "how did THAT hit me" is actually fixable
---
me too, as killer rank 10 and surv rank 10 i dont find lobby, 30 minutes waiting and nothing.
---
Drop your Ruin or NOED for Whispers and this won't be a problem.
---
YAY FRESH MEMES
---
So you make a post complaining about other people's post? Where the fuck is your logic?
---
That would be awesome
---
SFTS is not really useless, if you can‚Äôt track people or loose them really quickly then it‚Äôs actually really good, especially on spirit
---
How about no. How about the killers just fucking play the game. How about we hold killers to the same standards we want from survivors? I don't want to waste fucking 3 minutes just laying there. That's bullshit. You would bitch if you had to sit there for 3 minutes waiting for survivors to escape before end game.....
---
Thanat is fine at lower ranks or with less experienced Survivors when it makes the Survivors really scared of the red bar when trying to repair Generators so they always heal, but at higher ranks or with smarter Survivors they'll just not really give a shit. 16% slowdown (assuming you can somehow get them all injured/dying/hooked) really doesn't add up to all the much increase to Generator repair times.
---
I'd probably just stick with Sloppy since at least the extra blood might help you find someone trying to Urban Evade around.
---
Yea I disagree with competitive lol this is probably the most casual game ever. Even the tournament system is relaxed.
---
It would synergies well with stbl.
---
I got facecamped 2 games in a row by doc and huntress. I was so pissed off lol
---
what‚Äôs his channel name?
---
There are some videos of actual footage, check on paulie esthers channel on his ghostface videos you could find some
---
It‚Äôs the only fair instance of 1v1 in dbd. You can shut the hatch, camp the gates. The most work you have to do is guessing which gate they are going for, and even if they make it first, you have more than enough time to slap them away and after that the odds are in the killers favor.
---
Look guys it's console and huntress so frames look choppg
---
As you guys did for 2 years?? Rofl you survivors sure are funny
---
I personally have no issue with MoM, i also had no problem with DS before the nerf. But the difference with those two perks was that there is no counterplay for that.
---
Noed and camping both have counterplays though. I'm not saying we shouldn't work on them. Like a totem counter added to small game, or expanding hook duration while inside the killers terror radius for example. 
---
But to get back to the point of this thread, no neither noed nor camping are justified reasons for a DC (neither were DS or MoM for that matter).
---
People DC because they ragequit, and while the killers/survivors behaviour or the map, or the offering may push the person over the edge to DC, the fault still lies with the person that DCs. So punishment should go their way.
---
And yes killing yourself on hook will be the next issue they'll have to figure out. The only real difference will be a few seconds for the survivor team, and a not lost BBQ stack for the killer i guess.
---
I main Billy and don‚Äôt really agree, but I also play a lot of Clown and that one is PERFECT. I like to think of myself as a very patient person but whenever I get pallet looped and stunned I will go APESHIT and swear furiously until they‚Äôre hooked
---
RyyFii ! He‚Äôs the OP of this haha
---
Nah, Zubat cheated in legacy for Meg and Jake as well, iirc. Also cheated in a bunch of bloodpoints. He fully admits his ban was justified and his fault.
---
This is a personal attack
---
Why don‚Äôt YOU do something about this and do generators while they‚Äôre being facecamped?
---
It's still more favoured towards the killer for closing the hatch. 
---
If the killer closes the hatch, the survivor relies on good RNG for the doors to spawn far away from each other. 
---
The survivor then has to make a choice on whether to look for the hatch &amp; find it before the killer or wait at a door to get a head start on opening it. 
---
They then have to rely on the 50/50 chance that the door they are opening is not the first door the killer checks because if they are found before they can open the door they are dead. 
---
They also rely on the killer not having a clear LOS between the 2 doors as it could mean the killer can get to them before they can leave. 
---
All of its down to luck &amp; the survivors planning on what is the right course of action. They have to prepare themselves as running to the door can leave scratches for the killer to follow. If they do escape then the killer still managed to win with 3 kills so it's not like the killer lost the game.
---
If I remember correctly, they have been discussing doing something about the grind, such as removing ranks for perks so you wouldn't have to put so many BP into a single Survivor/Killer to get them fully perked out. We'll see if they ever actually implement it however.
---
As more and more DLC comes out, it becomes more and more of a noticeable issue, since the 1 Mil BP cap doesn't get you even remotely close to fully perking out a new Killer/Survivor and it will just keep getting worse with 3/6 new perks per Paragraph/Chapter.
---
I'm sure BHVR is working on something, we'll probably just have to wait a while.
---
I wasn't able to add subtext to the images, but using the top of the fence you can see the difference in camera angle between the two shots. The shot of me not flashing is to show where you have to point for it to be at eye level
---
I'm not an expert but I think his first one was just legacy hacking.
---
Another butthurt killer main.
---
What's next on the agenda now that you've whined enough to get MOM nerfed?
---
It‚Äôs only 2mins, it‚Äôs really not that long. I understand killers can be cunts, same goes for survivors too, but can‚Äôt really stop people from being like that. Don‚Äôt get too worked up on it dude.
---
Thanks, I haven‚Äôt really been playing since the 2.6 ptb
---
Not really, i can check one go check the other and its half way done and then go back see thats worked on and then go back and they're teabagging at the gate.
---
I mean he IS 87
---
I've seen videos haha didn't look very pleasant.
---
I upvoted to counter it &lt;3
---
tier 1 Myers
---
Maybe just general shitiness on bhvr‚Äôs side.
---
Eric Andre for new survivor and Kraft Punk as killer make it happen
---
My personal policy is that I don't DC outside of extreme lag issues, but I seriously thought about it.
---
I mean legion simultaneously forces all survivors to need to heal if played well.
---
Legion in a similar fashion forces survivors to be injured all game or at the very least makes them waste time healing.
---
Unless Plague purposefully leaves the survivor AND the survivors actually cleanse themselves a lot, she will be in a similar boat as legion, chasing mostly injured survivors as a standard 115 killer without much more help from her power.
---
Or maybe - now hear me out on this - maybe we should give wglf an ACTUAL USE other than bp farming
---
It's definitely fun prestiging because you don't have everything you want plus people think if you have them prestiged fully you are more skillful and you play them alot. You get a 3% chance of better add ons I think also when you prestige also
---
I mean you basically give away your position from yelling it so he's comin right for ya. Would work well with Mettle of man if timed right
---
This isn't true at all. Using your time to just rehook the same guy and let the other get away means 3 people are working gens. If you slug the unhook or go after the unhooker after injuring them while letting the unhook either self cares or get healed by someone while you chase, then there's at most 2, possibly 1 person working on a gen.
---
I'm on PC. Around since Plague was released, I cannot finish killer games. Everyone loads into my lobby with green ping, we all start the match together, but after a couple minutes 3 or 4 survivors instantly DC. This happens literally every game. I can host other steam games perfectly fine, just not DBD killer games. My suvivor games are fine. Is there anything I can do with my router? I'm on ethernet. Thank you. :)
---
All perks on my Pig, Ashy Slashy, and my Claudette. Devotion 5 level 23. The grind is very real and if they change it part of me would be like not fair then the other half would say time to grind out the rest.
---
He man its up to you...i prestige my freddy and saw no increase in rarity but i prestiged my stalky boi and he started getting great addons.
---
Can u do me oneüò≠? I wanna buy it
---
"But the difference with those two perks was that there is no counterplay for that."
---
I believe dribbling was the counter for DS. Some killers are still doing it on their obsessions even though that won't work anymore.
---
"Like a totem counter added to small game, or expanding hook duration while inside the killers terror radius for example."
---
I can agree with both of these.
---
"People DC because they ragequit, and while the killers/survivors behaviour or the map, or the offering may push the person over the edge to DC, the fault still lies with the person that DCs."
---
Honestly, if they start harsh punishing people for DC'ing, then people will just let themselves die on hook. The only difference there is that the killer is still over rewarded points, the survivor team is still fucked over, and BHVR isn't going to do shit about it because it's perfectly within the rules of the game to do so. Which means we've still got the same problem where survivor teams are dicked over due to hard campers ruining someone else's game experience. They can't remove it because you're allowed to have the option of "leave me and save yourself". 
---
"and a not lost BBQ stack for the killer i guess."
---
This is one of the reasons why WGLF needs a buff. Once you stack all your WGLF, the perk becomes a wasted slot. BBQ on the other hand is continuously useful even after you get a 4 stack, because you can still see survivor auras when performing a hook (and let's not kid ourselves, not every team member is going to run for a locker the second someone gets picked up). Add in the fact that nearly ALL killers use it and killers don't have to use BP's on items (since their power takes up that slot), it means they get to go cray on add ons for their power. The least they could do for WGLF is reveal the killer aura to the unhooker for 4 seconds so it's no longer a wasted slot, or remove the killer's aura seeing ability once they get their 4 stack.
---
Depends entirely upon how badly you want to get the bloodstained weapons and clothes. Although if you already have 1mil bp then you can try and do it. You get more rare add ons by prestiging in your bloodwebs. Just be warned that you lose all offerings and add ons when you prestige so use what you want to use beforehand
---
Thing is, right now MOM rewards people who get hit, regardless of whether or not you're good or bad, and I think that that's a bit of a poor game decision.  I understand We're Gonna Live Forever rewarding you for taking hits for your team but it also allows you to save them instead.
---
MOM right now just rewards you for taking smacks from the killer which, like I said, I think is poor design choice, but I also think making it something you only get for taking hits for others is a poor design choice because it just makes it TOO situational to be used properly.
---
I never insulted video games, I play dbd too, you know? Cuz it's fun. But it's not work, there's a difference (obviously you can't understand that). Dbd is just a game, that's it. Also I like how you call every1 who doesn't agree with you troll - "he has opposite opinion, troll"
---
Clown may be good but he is by a mile the least enjoyable killer for me.
---
Already a conflict of buttons, the activate button is the same for both dead hard and MoM (if you can activate it) so what takes priority if I‚Äôm running both perks?
---
My comment meant something to activate the perk, like a requirement, not making it something the player themselves can activate.
---
Yeah I just can‚Äôt seem to get the hang of him along with nurse
---
Congrats. Another idiot who cannot see that all the unhooked teammates are CLEARLY doing gens in the picture.
---
Leatherface forgot he had a mori so he hooked me twice and in the end I escaped.
---
He told me he hoped I died from cancer or burned in a fire calling me racial slurs just bc I was playing Claudette.
---
Apart from that occasion I noticed in 800+h killers usually are much less aggressive in post game chat than survivors are.
---
Wow, a comment so stupid you said it twice!
---
Here's your automated reply:
---
no u

DBD is not a horror game, its horror themed.
---
Stidor increases breathing, not moaning
---
just use urban evasion
---
Survivors don't need perks. The killers will be hurt a lot more. I'm also sure people will queue up and be in Skype chat. You can't prevent them from lobby sniping.
---
Theres a difference between looking choppy and missing a bunch of frames.
---
You can clearly see after you hit him with the hatchet you facing a rock and the next frame we can se you facing to the other side without any sign of you turning.
---
He‚Äôs fairly easy to learn. 
---
If they‚Äôre at a loop, throw the gas in the middle of area where they have to loop, not at the pallet. People under the effect of the gas always medium vault and they cannot fast vault. 
---
That‚Äôs the entire character.
---
It depends really on how committed you are and how much you have grown attached to the killer. If you really want to main Huntress &amp; want something to show for it then prestiging is the way to go. You do lose all your items but you will eventually gain them all back. The prestige items are quite nice to look at and show to other survivors that you have experience with the killer you are playing.  
---
I have decided to not prestige any of my killers because I do not want to invest the effort into grinding them back up to the level I currently have them at. This is a choice I have made because I like to experiment with builds and different add-ons so restarting from the beginning for a cosmetic is not something that I am particularly interested in.
---
&gt; that person do earn negative reaction
---
If you paid any attention at all, rather than trying to set up this "I don't care" insult attempt, you'd see that my words literally said:
---
&gt; The only thing I care about is when people try to force upon others a particular way of play, be it killer or survivor, based on their own concept of "what's right/fair/equitable" and convenience.
---
So, to be clear, once again: hate it, gripe about it, fair enough; however, quit trying to compel people to play in a way you find most palatable.
---
Mint rag+make your choice is super scummy, but one of the most broken combos in the game.
---
Do most doctors really not go into treatment mode?

thank you!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
‚ÄúMy my Wraith, what strong perks you have‚Äù
---
‚ÄúAll the better to murder you with, my dear‚Äù
---
O I N K
---
Wait, I think you misunderstood me. I didn‚Äôt mean P3 somebody and unlock everything on that character. I mean: P3 Lv50 a Hillbilly and you unlock Enduring 3, Lightborn 3, Tinkerer 3 on every killer.
---
In my opinion it would be a perfectly balanced incentive.
---
yup! I‚Äôm planning on doing the pig with her new cosmetics next :)! &amp; thank you!
---
If that's the case, then I am now playing as T3 Myers for the rest of the game, with advanced tracking abilities.
---
im a spirit main who happens to be gay what about dat boo
---
My Pig has every perk available killers. My Ash and my Claudette have every perk available for survivors plus I have them P3.
---
i backed out
---
I didn't say it sucks at all. I would be happy for reduced grind. Maybe some friends would play again. I have been playing since march of last year.
---
I mean it's obviously pretty widely forgiven but you can definitely still fault people for cheating in items. If it was someone's "brand" to always use a Mori I'm sure most people wouldn't be singing the same tune about cheating those in. But to me it's more about the principle, not what item you're cheating in, before someone points out that Moris are obviously just a wee bit more powerful than flashlights.
---
She finally kicked her adderall habit. I'm proud of her.
---
i had a stroke reading the title; what?
---
Yeah, he deserved the ban no doubt
---
I wonder how long it will take for this community to understand...
---
Looks great, nice mask!   
---
A lot of Myers-Masks you can buy look really really awful. Did you got lucky or is it selfmade?
---
Just before rank reset and well after it on PS4
---
A good compromise leaves no one happy. So i guess that makes this game, gold.
---
Ur annoying fam

It's actually amazing how full of shit you are.   
---
You start by ignoring the obvious purpose of this post because you wanted to go out of your way to shit on people who DC, and then wonder why in the world someone isn't accepting you with open arms.  
---
"the problem with DC'ing somehow lies in the killers being toxic or cheap."  
---
That's because it is.   
---
"Some people will DC for any reason"  
---
You DO know that includes killers, right? But no, you go on a survivor rant.   
---
"they do not belong in an online game if all they're gonna do is ruin said game for everyone else"  
---
Really? Because hook camping ruins the game for the team, and especially for that one player. So by your own logic, camping killers should not belong in an online game.  
---
"it's these people who DC 99.9% of the time."  
---
Citation needed.  
---
"Would you sympathise with a killer DC'ing...."  
---
The killer always has opportunity. Period. A survivor stuck on a hook has nearly zero opportunity **within their own power** if there's a killer camping. If everyone else does gens (which has already been established as being done), then that survivor is out of a game, and is robbed of potential BP's (minus the few measly struggle BP's they get). Killers are always in a situation where they can gain more BP's, no matter how many hexes they lose, or how many t-bags they receive. It's actually laughable how many BP's a killer can get in a game without getting a single kill. With the exception of glitches, Killers are never trapped in a nearly inescapable situation that survivors have put them in. The game is not survivor sided. If you'd looked at the data BHVR put out recently, even with a 4 man SWF, your chances of survival are still less than 50% (and those are only 6% of games). Solo games have even less of a chance of survival. I'd say my sympathy for killers is out there, but it's definitely a lot less.
---
but do we really need justifications. You don't have to justify 4 players using MoM, Adrenaline, Balanced Landing, and Borrowed time while popping a Haddonfield offering. Is all i'm saying, why do killers have gentleman rules, but survivors do whatever they want? Who made the game that way?
---
Thank you. üòÇ
---
That a whole lot of mess
---
that would mean there is a good chance he was banned before then
---
We DID stop picking each other up, we DID stop running from generators, he DID slug us and let us bleed out. 3 people bled out, 1 person got hatch.
---
But I think those are positives, as it should be really hard to pull off. A free health state with a speed boost on hit is a big deal, so getting it should be really hard. Having it be only 2 hits would make it too easily cheesable (pop instaheal mid chase, for example, and you'd have it)
---
*Instant Evil Within III sound drawing closer*
---
high skill cap ? thats funny shes literary like the easiest to play, i havent played her bunch becasue i think shes too easy to kill 4 with, her hatchets are not hard to hit at all, only time i would miss is when surv was running dead hard im talking about pc i have no clue about console
---
She looks like the actress that plays Quake in Agents of Shield
---
The spirit one hit a little too close to home üëÄ
---
I never understood what makes Meyers so fun to people, other than the obnoxious ass daddy Meyers memes.
---
But hey to each their own.
---
No, if you end up in a situation where the other 3 survivors are dead and you haven't even been hooked once that means you've failed at splitting killer aggro. Ideally the survivors should be trading hooks all game long since effectively as a team the four of you have 8 "chances" before someone has to die. 
---
A big part of this game is the risk that any given perk you select might might be useful every game. I don't know why people get so upset over this specific perk that they want BHVR to guarantee they get to use it. 
---
Instead of asking BHVR to code and deploy systemic gameplay changes and hiding it under this fake-as-hell guise of "It's good for the killer, I swear!" just change your playstyle. It's so much simpler for everyone involved if you just play a little more bolder once you get your Deliverance active.
---
ive actually never seen someone play plague
---
LMAO.   
---
Wow.   
---
You make a claim, it's gets destroyed by evidence.  
---
You reword your claim, it's gets destroyed by evidence.  
---
You go in for an ad hominem, because you can't stand the fact that you've lost.   
---
Thanks you for clearly waving your white flag of defeat.
---
This list doesn‚Äôt work because there are only 5 killers in the game with a learning curve - Nurse, hag, Freddy, Spirit and Huntress.
---
The rest can only be learned to a certain degree and then everybody is on the same level, you understand my point?
---
I agree with this alot. I feel it'll encourage more killer variety and cut the grind down a bit.
---
I had the same ping in a lobby the other day! Me and my friends instantly left lol.
---
I've seen numerous killers do it.
---
I'm sorry you had a shit game, but you have to find ways to make the best of each one. Use your team mates to bait the killer away and revive the others. Hide as best you can and practice the loops. Put pressure on the killer and make them work as hard as possible. If they're determined to slug, be just as determined to not be slugged. Find your fun no matter the situation.
---
Pretty much why I stopped playing lol. It was either getting facecamping killers or brain dead teammates that didn't even know the basics.
---
Um wraith.. i dont think people like LITERALLY meant that then they said "steal her heart"
---
i stayed long enough to take a picture and a video but fuck that
---
Holy shit! What an original idea!
---
How the hell did no one think about this before!
---
Oh wait, they did. This idea is garbage.
---
Fair
---
Bought Myers. 
---
Took until level 47 for BBQ to show up. 
---
This is why I don't bother with prestige on the majority of my characters in game. Bloody clothes is not worth the headache of doing it 3 times for each person.
---
Right lol I think he needs to reset his toaster
---
Untru I've only been playing for 8 months and I never just stood around and hid to be a dick.  
---
So yall bitch about something then turn around and do it. Fucking HYPOCRITES at its finest.
---
real hag mains don‚Äôt camp hooks
---
I'd rather insert MY dominance, ifyouknowwhatimean
---
Exactly I was just suggesting it could fit better on different killers I swear I can't say anything on this sub without getting down voted. Whatever karma means nothing for me.
---
That's dwightest
---
Yeah. I wish progression would stop. Instead people just dc and since losers abuse the method you will start getting banned. They are attacking results not causes.
---
I think playing around the idea of getting healable hits would make it possible (body blocking when killer is hooking someone else, stuff like that). But in return it would get a buff where it prevents going down completely, even from an instadown attack at full health. That way it's crazy strong if you manage to make it work.
---
Gg
---
EEEEEEEZZZZZZZZ! NEWB! OP ADDONS!BBY KILLER/SURVIVOR! TOOONLER! COOMPER!
---
uhhh r/engrish?
---
And just because it's a relaxed game don't mean it can't be competitive. But do you really want to reference Valhalla as a point to use?
---
¬øQue?
---
Same, green ranks for both and it‚Äôs taking me years to find lobbies in both. Killer seems to be particularly worse.
---
But had you let go of the gen before it popped to get the BP?? That's the important question.
---
As a survivor I hate this map. Not many pallets, way to open, almost no window vaults(like 3 or 4 in the whole map) and no place to use balanced landing pretty much
---
work
---
/w…ôrk/
---
verb
---
past tense:¬†worked; past participle:¬†worked
---
1.
---
be engaged in physical or mental activity in order to achieve a purpose or result, especially in one's job; do work.
---
"an engineer who had been¬†working on¬†a design for a more efficient wing"
---
synonyms:toil,¬†labor,¬†exert oneself,¬†slave (away),¬†plod away;¬†More
---
.That's the literal definition for work and worked.
---
Work or worked in this case, means too do something too gain something (in this case cosmetics for the game.) 
---
It does not need to be for money, or your job. It could be anything from experience too the feeling of accomplishment of completing something.
---
Nor does it matter how hard or fun it is.
---
So what he said is correct. He didn't say it was work as in a job but work as in something put time and effort into too gain something that's it.
---
Same friend
---
I actually consider the plague as pretty bad and I somewhat regret putting her as high up on the tierlist as I did. I don't understand how Legion is effective because he just gets looped hard with a little stalling potential. Also, Legion's Frenzy doesn't guarantee a hit as easily anymore.
---
Just give them invisibility when they are 3 feet or less from the hook lol.  That's a buff 95% of Bubba Mains would love I'm sure.
---
It‚Äôs not an objective fact, it‚Äôs an opinion he‚Äôs presenting as a fact.
---
i wonder how he downloaded the game üòÇ
---
I feel like leatherface is actually in a good spot right now and this idea would make him pretty good in chases maybe too good but it's my opinion so whatever. I personally feel doctor needs a buff instead of LF
---
For anyone saying its edited heres the full game 
---
https://youtu.be/3ix-YmyipZE
---
"The problem does not lie in toxic or cheap killers."
---
Except yeah, it totally is. You are completely fine with someone having their game ruined because a killer can't be bothered to chase other survivors. Okay then. If we're ever in game, I'll be sure not to save you. 
---
"Stop pretending there's one side to the coin"
---
Saying that all the fault lies with survivors (as you have been doing) is acting as though it's a one sided coin. 
---
"You attack people who disagree with you"
---
I already made the point that people who replied with specific comments, or simply didn't read the game description, and decided to make asshole comments, got the same treatment in return. That included how you started this whole conversation. You made your first comment, acting like an ass by ignoring the point of this post, and RECEIVED the same treatment in return. 
---
"then wonder why in the world someone isn't accepting you with open arms"
---
I never said I wondered anything about people's reactions. You were the one who brought up treatment, not I. 
---
You also failed to refute any point I brought up in my last reply, so I guess you don't have one.
---
Then don't insult people you moron.  I was lucky not to be struck with the Legacy loss wave. You see I had Family share and considering on my steam profile, I never technically owned the game, I never had my legacy. It wasn't till I actually bought the game that I got my Legacy 1 and 2 for Jake.
---
Love
---
That last paragraph so fucking much yes. 
---
I stream this game constantly as the killer on PC. I usually get at least a 3k every match. Never camp and constantly preach that if you wanna be a good killer and get massive amounts of blood points you don't camp. 
---
Because during the time you're camping you could be:
---
Destroying gems, getting chases, hooking other survivors, keeping other survivors away from getting their points as well. 
---
I will however, soft patrol a hook when the gens are powered and I have someone on hook because really what else am I supposed to do? Let my prey go?
---
I disagree. In my opinion, Leatherface gets looped pretty hard right now, he has no map pressure and only is strong in defending the hook(as well as instadowning bad survivors). I agree that Doctor needs a buff too though.
---
That looks like Jake imo
---
As a huntress main, can confirm
---
This is probably the most accurate cosplay of huntress I've seen. Just look at the legs.
---
‚ÄúYa‚Äômean‚Äù 
---
You can make one survivor drop the item they‚Äôre holding. 
---
‚ÄúYo that jacket is tight son, ya‚Äômean!‚Äù
---
Because it has a map in it, probably. 
---
But I'm honestly not interested in getting Ghostface without one survivor.
---
New Perk: Literally just Object of Obsession. But overtime you look at the killer it says "Whazzup!!!"
---
Plan B: play dead
---
I would like it but it‚Äôs a dude and not a female
---
Yeah I usually run ds because I've been facing a lot of tunnelers lately. For exhaustion I would recommend Dead Hard but balanced landing is alright too.
---
What is your definition of small
---
But when they spend the whole match bm‚Äôing you as well I don‚Äôt care whether it‚Äôs not very nice they wanted to be jackasses I‚Äôm getting a kill. I don‚Äôt usually facecamp unless they really annoyed me and I only got one kill. Sometimes I won‚Äôt face camp and give them a chance and the next thing I know they‚Äôre teabagging at the exit gate because I gave them a chance and now I have to wait 10 minutes in the basement because I don‚Äôt want to give them the satisfaction
---
Most fun
---
Nope
---
Small price to pay when playing swf
---
Yes the title I know
---
No but its like 8 different things in the title
---
"i wanna see boobs wuaaahh"
---
Seriously stfu and let people cosplay whatever they want
---
A lot of people say leatherface has the best defense game of all killers but in my opinion it's definitely hag. If you place your traps correctly you can stop loops, gens, and unhooks (place one trap for gens and hooks though).
---
Huh?
---
???   
---
Yes. Me. Calling you a moron. Because you are. You're not so good with this conversation thing are you?
---
Yeah I was tired I don‚Äôt know what you want me to say ‚Äúoh please forgive me for making a grammatical error oh you‚Äôre definitely the first person to tell me oh my gosh take my money for being a genius‚Äù
---
Just look through it 4Head
---
Karma is a bitch isnt
---
But even when you get karma thrown at you you refuse it and rage quit
---
Hopefullt tiu get a ban
---
I agree with your idea, I really want this grind to be less harsh and I would really love that you could choose up to 4 perks in a single web.
---
MEEEEEH!
---
Devs monitor when someone rage quits soo there is no point in reporting them
---
Reporting them just fills the report system with useless reports instead of dealing with real issues
---
Dwight cosplaying as huntress?
---
That‚Äôs not it. Just imagine a girl cosplaying a doctor. Wouldn‚Äôt look right.
---
&gt;"Saying that all the fault lies with survivors (as you have been doing)-"  
---
\- No. I am saying the problem lies in the people who DC. You chose to make the connection that it means survivors, which should tell you a thing or two about where the problem lies.  
---
&gt;"You also failed to refute any point I brought up in my last reply, so I guess you don't have one."  
---
Fine, allow me.  
---
&gt;"You DO know that includes killers, right? But no, you go on a survivor rant."  
---
Again, you made that connection. I am talking about people who DC as a whole, and the fact that the problem lies in them and *only* them, because it does. This naturally includes killers who DC. They too are childish and pathetic.  
---
&gt;"Really? Because hook camping ruins the game for the team, and especially for that one player. So by your own logic, camping killers should not belong in an online game."  
---
Sure, if the team plays altruistic and basically ends up killing themselves because they don't know how to adapt to the killer's (arguably ineffective) playstyle. The only reason killers keep doing it, is because survivors allow it to work.  
---
I don't dispute that camping ruins the fun for the person who gets camped, because that's true, but even then the survivor can waste as much of the killer's time as possible, instead of screwing everyone else over.  
---
And, of course, I do believe that camping shouldn't be a thing, because it simply isn't fun to play against, but I'm not a developer. I cannot make the choice of whether or not it's allowed to exist, and so I must live with camping being a potential thing I encounter, adapt to it and try to overcome it. I will not DC if the killer camps or tunnels or does something I don't consider fun to play against, and I won't DC if I'm up against survivors who do things I don't consider fun to play against, because I'm not a selfish prick, at least not to that extent. I will not take an arm if someone takes my finger.  
---
I think that just about wraps it up. Whether or not I "fail to refute" your points is up to you and whether or not you choose to continue to be a brick wall. Either way, I'm done now, and much like yourself, I will walk away with the idea in mind that I've "won" this pointless argument on the Internet. It was a nice time-waster, if nothing else. Have a nice life, friend.
---
Yea I think the other guys wrong I‚Äôve seen a bunch of killers interrupt the survivors jumping in. Killer takes priority over survivor jumping in.

I think it was close enough that it could be chalked up to lag, though. It was right as you hit the escape button.
---
i think you may need a little more experience in this game :)
---
Meh, it's whatever, we got Ash solo, now we get Ghostface solo.
---
tbh, no killer would want their HG to be cleansed in the first ten seconds of the match
---
Also I‚Äôm not against anyone cosplaying anyone. People can do want they want. I‚Äôm just giving an honest opinion.
---
Then they wouldn't be "dailies"
---
You should use that time to do gens and wait for a better time to save. BT isn't really helping the guy if its early on. He will just take a few more loops to get hooked again
---
I don‚Äôt think anybody is dominating with Deja Vu.
---
I learned how to run with Object. I think Pharmacy is a good perk. I've been told Alert is garbage on this sub, but it's not

You think I want to see huntress boobs? I honestly think it doesn‚Äôt look right. Imagine a girl cosplaying the doctor. Also I‚Äôm not against anyone cosplaying anyone. People can do want they want. I‚Äôm just giving an honest opinion.

I can confirm that every jake I see is sabotaging shit
---
I would literally pay any price for shorty.
---
I never said its edited, I just said there are some frames missing but I dont know whats the cause of this.

I think If you see an ace then u should assume he has them. Especially if he‚Äôs running around presumably looking for something
---
it‚Äôs a shitpost lol
---
Still waiting for support to get back to me after losing an entire day's worth of progression. My Nea was at Prestige 1 level 30 and got reverted back to no prestige level 40.
---
Followed all of their instructions and still no word back about anything :(
---
You misunderstand. I was looking for a specific perk. Otherwise, it just sounds like being vague for post karma.
---
How do you know it's not deliverance anyway?
---
Personally don't care about not having a survivor this chapter because we are getting Ghostface but I know some people really wanted Sidney which honestly sucks for them.
---
Yeah. The perk allows them to take one extra hit. Not several. and if you really can't get around them being able to take one extra hit, yes, you are the one who is bad
---
Just a question, why exactly does it counter trapper and hag? 
---
You see their traps? I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a counter. 
---
Clown also does fine in chases.
---
Summer doesn‚Äôt start for a month or so
---
how so when im saying that shes easy to play ? im not high rank surv but killer im rank 5 lol
---
Is safe to assume anyone has it if they run straight to a chest at the beginning of the game and not a generator
---
No one left behind shines...
---
No. I‚Äôm telling you that any perk considered A or better is better than alert. That is too many to specifically name. 
---
Out of 56 perks, I could name at least 25 perks that are outright better than alert.
---
ngl that was probably me with my dad's rooster powered wifi
---
I mean yeah but the beard just throws me off. Other than that the cosplay is really good.
---
Agreed, though this game was weird. I was made obsession despite neither of us having any obsession perks. 
---
I saw the Devour Hope totem, my brain died while trying to do math (we killed hex 3 totems) and thought maybe we only broke 2 all while thinking they had an obsession perk. Thought the totem was Haunting Grounds so I didn‚Äôt want to touch it.
---
Then two people got bad touched and I scuttled away to freedom.
---
You haven't done that in three responses.
---
Awesome cosplay!! You should show more picture!
---
I know... There is a horde coming for us
---
bring out the Moris pals, let's get through this together.
---
How about eighthouries?
---
They should go back to having tiered dailies, only this time you should be able to progress through each tier and collect it's reward, instead of randomly getting only a certain tier.
---
......and then DC's
---
I mean I play a P3 Claudette but I don't ever tea bag. Looping and blinding, sure. But I've dealt with way too much toxicity to be toxic myself
---
Try rank 6 as well
---
Imagaine being uneducated
---
i fully forgive you
---
Perk: ‚ÄúWAZZAAAAAAAAA!‚Äù
---
Give the killer 2/3/4 noise notifications somewhere around the map
---
Lol! So true! There is a small sweet spot 8-10 normally you might get a facecamper 1-5 games but with the amount of kids that play on PS4 and there parents don‚Äôt care what‚Äôs games they play you get a ton of facecampers I have had 4 today out of 10games
---
\*"good, get some rest, you will need it ;)"\*
---
Legion one should have been something about being really edgy.
---
no
---
So accurate. Especially pig and spirit.
---
Now that's thinking with your ass!
---
What the other guy said
---
I‚Äôve been finding games pretty quickly lately
---
That question has already been replied to more than once. Go look for the answer, I'm not playing the copy/paste game all day with people who don't use their eyes, either to look at the picture properly, or to read.
---
I wont
---
I am right and you somewhat learned that people can cosplay whatever the fuck they want
---
You are just removing your comments because you realized you are wrong, instead of accepting what you said is wrong and saying sorry to the cosplayer
---
Oh no
---
&gt;When the ping is fine in the lobby, all game, then suddenly becomes unplayable when the gens are done, that is what we call a "special lag spike"
---
Throttling the connection as cheap as it sounds, still is different than lag switching, which is the only thing that will get you banned AFAIK.
---
Learn the max range that you can reach while running FF and abuse that. With the right addons and on the right map you could basically run across the whole map with FF just to stab someone. Abuse that.
---
Also, if you see more than two survivors on one gen, pop FF, stab all of them, and then go after one of them and chase him down. That‚Äôs about it really.
---
Also, use bamboozle because it helps a lot and remember that u can bodyblock while coming out of FF.
---
What if I issue a public apology
---
The gitch
---
You have no idea how to play the game dude... just stfu you're embarassing yourself here
---
I think it's the emojis. Its the mark of someone who is either too socially inept or just too plain fim to understand humour, so they need to be told (and therefore feel the need to tell other) when something is funny. Quite sad, really. No cure. To shreds, you say?
---
To the defense of most Docs, sometimes they just come to you and seem to want the hook so you don't have a chance to use it much
---
That‚Äôs a slow vault. Looks good to me
---
You're probably just mad because you're a killer main and never play survivor
---
Thanks, I was wondering whether bamboozle will be effective or not
---
Aw :( well at least we all appreciate your cosplay here on this sub
---
I feel this way about the lower level of the The Game lately
---
Hmmm maybe it‚Äôs just me idk. It takes 5 minutes or so as killer to find a match and like 10-15 for survivor
---
Object counters both of these killers because you can see where they're laying down their traps, and for hag, you can see where she's teleporting to.
---
You know for someone with such strong opinions on alert, you really don't know how the perks work.
---
One person recognised me. I spent the entire time being bored and slut dropping, saying i smell pennies and other random shit. Im posting the dabbing legion shortly
---
They could just give us 3 brand new dailies every day, which will replace the ones from yesterday unless some progress has been made.
---
Such a beautiful piece of art, I love it.
---
Not exactly a counter but alright. 
---
You are weird bro. 
---
Stop responding to my stuff.
---
I'm sorry you can't handle discussion?
---
No thats just nea
---
Lol you're devotion 4? I've been playing long before the game had a level system... also you've created your reddit account 3 months ago. I've been on DBD's reddit for years.
---
I‚Äôm not saying the cosplay was wrong. I just don‚Äôt agree with the beard. I will admit that I was wrong about it should be a girl because I didn‚Äôt know what I was unnerved about. It‚Äôs really just the beard. Btw cosplayer if you are reading this, the cosplay looks great and it‚Äôs a better cosplay than I could ever do. This toxic person just can‚Äôt learn that people say things that they don‚Äôt really mean sometimes. I feel sorry for the people you are friends with knowing hat they can‚Äôt say anything controversial without you being on their ass about how wrong they are.
---
Because people cant stand losing, so they just DC and go to next game. Sometimes also the game just crashes, and they also DC if your lagging bad.
---
I just tought it was interesting since it's only 5 hours long, yet there are videos that are 40+ hours long on youtube I guess.
---
I didn't really know what sub reddit so I just slapped it on this one since it's semi related.
---
I wonder if the entity lets them fuck.
---
So everyone basically running no mither without the pros of it. Don't see how that's bad for the 115% movespeed killer
---
For real.
---
He hit you through the window, because you did a medium speed vault. Also 110 ping is high, so you should have left the lobby.
---
over 1000 dbd clips even from back in 2016 with pink perks and shish, adding up to a total of 5 hours in 4K 60 FPS.
---
Yeah ok dude
---
Bruh lol
---
Nobody fuckin cares if you've been playing it since the goddamn first day. But you can't assume someone knows nothing about the game when you don't actually know shit. You have no idea about my vast knowledge of this game already. Yet you still assume I have no idea how to play. Well I'm glad you're on PC I would hate to have you as a teammate
---
A ban?? You want people banned.. get a life..
---
I havent played in a while, do you not lose points/get banned for DCs anymore?
---
That's the point.
---
Ahh my Trapper had BBQ are rank 1 forever and I went like 40plus in levels just to get rank 2
---
Absolutely agree they should change them back.
---
Getting a 4k was already a steep requirement at mid to high ranks since your perks are decided for you, but changing it to a 4k and a double-pip makes it much more annoying and [Sudoku](https://static1.fjcdn.com/comments/Commit+sudoku+_b5432d57e1414085c0424a98fdf7a997.png)\-inducing.

Alternative Spirit:

*Okay, listen up you little shit. I don't play spirit because she's fun, or op, or god forbid sexy* (she is canonically a child)*, I play her because of the mental challenge. You pathetic survivor main have no idea how many hours I have spent honing my reflexes and ears into a phase-walking machine. Stridor is a shitty crutch for babies that don't know how to play this game correctly. My IQ is over 135 and I have decided to focus my great intellect into playing the most difficult killer and becoming a god among men. Many of you pathetic mortals think she is overpowered or even remotely strong, but the 110% movement speed makes normal looping unviable to the point of insanity. My ¬£300 gaming headset has 4D 360 degree surround sound, and I can hear your healthy breathing from 10 feet with no Stridor. Even with no perks, add-ons, and on coldwind farm, I will 4K you and your pathetic little swf in 3 minutes. Don't even talk to me until you begin to comprehend how high-skill the spirit is, and how big my dick is as a result. Begone.*
---
\*is rank 9\*
---
\^Okay I know it said 1 sentence, but I got carried away.\^
---
You can tell I just sorta gave up after he hit me lmao
---
Glad I play ps4, no after game chat. And anyone who tbags at the gates is getting thwacked whether you escape or not
---
ProJared because they are absolute shit and cheat you so much
---
No. He run straight into a killer and then died.
---
You do know I was referring to summer vacation right? Or you were so quick to type a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù reply you didn‚Äôt even think about it.
---
"only 5"
---
You seriously think people will watch 5 hours of gameplay?
---
They lose points but not pips i think.
---
I've been chainsawed too many times when my whole body is over the Vault, and I've already taken like 4 steps out of it. 
---
It's frustrating in this game especially considering 
---
**1)** It wasn't even my fault for being caught/put into the dying state,
---
**2)** Thanks to that Lag/Delayed Input/Killer Connection/Whatever, I now have 1 less "life" in the game because of it.
---
Now that's just asking to get twitch sniped
---
Your vast knowledge LULZ. Dude I'm not the one assuming shit. I just know for a fact that you don't understand about this game and by this behavior you showed I'm now assuming you're 10 years old.
---
All right tell me right now what the fuck you think I don't understand about the game
---
Even if you are talking about summer vacation you‚Äôre still wrong unless you‚Äôre claiming the weekend is summer vacation in which that also makes a weekend in winter a winter vacation.
---
You dont have to respect anything. That's just some made up rule some of the Survivor community tries to push.
---
they even reduced it to the hatchet's size at one point and it was broken because survivor hitboxes shit and the sphere compensated for that
---
My friends can say whatever they want
---
But i wont tolerate a person like you making niceguy comments about a cool cosplay just because its not the same gender
---
Hell I bet you call out people if they cosplay someone with a different skin colour
---
I would take being able to outrun the killer while broken over handing the killer an EZ projectile hit, any day.  
---
It is really stupid though that there are two survivor perks specifically made to reduce survivor sounds from either powers or damage, but nothing quells the sound of Plague's sickness. So if you go into the game with either, you'd wasted a stealth perk.
---
Yeah for sure, also save the best for the last is a great pick for him. Anything that involves a lot of hits really just works well with legion, like remember me for example.
---
Michael threw his knife towards you I guess.
---
‚ÄúI wish the huntress would give me iridescent head ;)‚Äù
---
If it's such a "fact" that I don't know anything about this game tell me almighty mateus, what am I getting wrong here
---
Dude there‚Äôs plenty of kids out on summer vacation. Just because it‚Äôs not at your school doesn‚Äôt mean it isnt at another.
---
Tried to fight, realised it didn't work, got downed, hooked, and then face camped until death
---
^Finally ^I ^can ^keep ^these ^pennies ^to ^myself 
---
Can‚Äôt wait to see a dabbing legion lmao
---
Dead harded into a tree*
---
I haven‚Äôt seen the answer tot hat question
---
Me when I play claudette-I FEAR NO DEATH IF I AM THE SALVATION
---
Trust me it is the most beautiful thing to be blessed on your eyes
---
On PS4, I keep getting disconnected from the game while during a match as killer or survivor normally half way thru or the end of the match and then sent back to the main loading screen with a message saying no internet connection. So I figured it was my internet a few times, then I was playing SWF with my daughter and nephew. Me and my daughter are on the same cable modem in the same house. Mine is wired and she is running wireless with a solid 100mb down and 10mb up connection, we all were in game chat thru Play station network, well I get kicked with the same thing as stated above. But I‚Äôm still able to talk with my daughter and nephew thru game chat and my daughter is still in the game and she said it shows that I disconnected. So now I‚Äôm not crazy and thinking it‚Äôs my internet connection, since this took place and am wondering if anyone else has been experiencing the same problems. I‚Äôve made sure all my cables are connected, bought new cat6 line and when playing many other games I have no issues.
---
Hit polygons.
---
The point is people usually leave a tiny bit of charge left not to loose the item
---
Sure I do believe what you want I could care less what you say. The fact you haven‚Äôt been civil in this entire conversation proves that this was a waist of my time. In final the cosplay is awesome and this conversation was pointless.
---
Let's stay real here, juggling was never a counter, if anything it was an exploit and worked for like 5 meter.
---
Yeah DC'ing is a tricky problem and i doubt they'll ever fix that.
---
The best we can hope for is to punish those ragequitters harder than the team they left behind. 
---
WGLF vs. BBQ is a whole other topic. But i disagree that they should be on par. It's still a 4v1 situation, so killer perks should natirally be stronger. 
---
But giving WGLF some use would be good, like sharing your aura with the person you unhooked until either of you get hit would be useful. But seeing the killers aura is a bit strong.
---
Wow you sure got me üòùüòÅüò≥üòÜüò¨üò©üìØ
---
‚ÄúUhh is it like that all over?‚Äù
---
the hits after vaults are a result of client-desync, not hitboxes, not latency.
---
No no, the *other* hitboxes. Like what other gaming communities mean when they talk about hitboxes. Not lag.
---
Don't constantly use your Feral Frenzy. Use it whenever they are in a groups or sometimes use it to catch up to a survivor with Sprint Burst. Legion is not power dependent and his power is pretty good as well. That's why I main him. My perk setup for him is: Discordance
---
also that was a fair hit anyways
---
BT isn't equal to pipping. You have to do a bit in all categories
---
Hanging out with huntress too much I guess
---
"havent been civil"
---
Rofl havent cursed or anything but yea sure whatever makes you sleep well at night
---
"the only wrong thing is the beard"
---
Rofl  you sure are funny, you cant accept others cosplaying but whatever just stop making dumb comments
---
Lisbon iberanime?
---
I mean I'm still not wrong when I say the hitboxes are shit
---
Anytime someone has TTV in their name, weather I'm a teammate, or the killer, I'll pop by and say hi. I've made a bunch of good friends this way!
---
I had once a game, where myers poped into Tier 3 while Our gen has activated his tinkerer.
---
All died.
---
Japan Weekend Valencia
---
Yeah isn't it toxic having friends
---
I do it to find where they're hiding and hill them.
---
There's been a LOT of game crashes lately, unfortunately :((
---
I think a long time ago the game didn't auto-sacrifice if you were the last guy. I'm talking closed beta trapper as the only killer era. 
---
I wouldn't mind if auto-sacrifice was removed. Dying on the hook doesn't take that long. Survivor gets Survival points for struggling and I get time to do stuff like close the hatch, kick generators, break pallets, etc. for points.
---
Wait?
---
Stbfl get stacks from frenzy?
---
It‚Äôs taken me a while to find matches but yes it‚Äôs still alive
---
Borrowed time downs count towards the achievement
---
I hate all versions of coldwind farm aint fun as killer at all
---
Isn't this called stream sniping? Isn't this a bannable offense?
---
Well that makes some sense. So I'm guessing it's a bug since the achievement states "As The Legion.....ect." 
---
Thanks for the answer though!
---
Ubisoft?
---
Tbf it‚Äôs the survivor‚Äôs dumbass fault for putting their twitch in their user
---
that happened to me while going against a pig suddenly I'm downed and it scared the shit out of me
---
It‚Äôs a trailer for a new DLC in Rainbow 6 Siege, but it straight up looks like a DbD trailer
---
Yep, it counts as a hit so u get stacks from it
---
&gt; after missing 2 chainsaws
---
Try 12
---
I don't want to be that guy but the Spirit's lore says she was in college. Canonically she's probably at least 18.
---
Woah.. Wow so if played effectively that's three stacks from one person, holy shit.
---
"Maybe if you weren‚Äôt an asshole, I would look"  
---
You were the one who came here and chose not to look at the picture or the comments before spouting the same thing many others had already done, in an ass-holish manner. Then you got spanked to being stupid when you realized "oh shit! they're already doing gens and my comment was unwarranted!"  
---
"You just bash people for whenever they disagree with you."  
---
You just spout shit without looking or reading. \*shrug\*  
---
"Fucking do gens to get the game over with. Thats the counter to camping."  
---
It's already been established to you that gens are being done if you looked at the picture. Did you really already forget about that?  
---
"you‚Äôre complaining about something you‚Äôre countering."  
---
Had you bother to read other comments, you'd have seen that even with us doing gens, the camper still has a ruined game, and that shit needs to go.   
---
"The developers can barely do anything to fix the camping, it‚Äôs what the players do not the devs, so get a brain."  
---
The devs have given plenty incentive for killers to leave a hook and go after other players, from perks like "Make your Choice" which exposes the unhooker if your XX meters away from the hook, to anti-camp perks for survivors, that and the fact that staying near a hook reduces your BP's as well. Yet killers still do it and are still over rewarded for it.   
---
It takes a brain to win a chase, it doesn't take a brain to stand still and camp a hook.   
---
Read a book, kid. You need it.
---
The have also changed the requirement for the achievement, without changing the description, 
---
‚ÄúDown a survivor whilst in feral frenzy‚Äù 
---
But you actually just have to down someone normal whilst they are afflicted with deep wounds, so it‚Äôs working with borrowed time.
---
Is this how it‚Äôs supposed to work? I just prestiged my ace just cause I wanted the bloody jacket!
---
Why? Put random traps in the corn.
---
Oh yeah like it‚Äôs incredibly easy to get 8 stacks of it just as long you avoid the obsession.
---
Pc players are the most entitled gamers out their, highest DC rate against old legion.
---
Am i the only one who understood that cheeky pun on huntress
---
110 is high ?
---
Yeah but since rank reset the lobby times have gotten terrible for some players
---
When I am playing trapper I usually use stbfl and rancor, BBQ and ruin, avoid the obsession and then mori him end game, fcking perfect haha!
---
Ruin is found too fast and all Survivors have toolboxes so you equip NOED cause no one cleanses dull totems anymore. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
It isn‚Äôt, especially when you play against 2+ Claudette‚Äôs who just sit in the corn the entire time
---
I just pop a green mori and do what comes naturally.
---
How old are you?
---
I suggested that like 2 months ago and everyone was saying just play an offering of a map you like.  Glad to see there are other people who want anti-map offerings
---
I‚Äôm from the UK and I sometimes get matched with Canadians and other NA countries. Have even gone as far as Japanese players too. I think after a while the game just tries to find players, rather than best suited players.
---
11
---
Again you're making a tantrum lol kid. Everyone here knows you're stupid from those comments. Its pretty obvious, I'm not going to explain to you no reason in stopping this hilarious thread.
---
no one is going to help you with this problem. i've had the exact same issue and had a ticket out to bhvr support for two months with no helpful information given. and then my ticket was left on "open" for the last 17 days with no response at all. i even tweeted at the developers and was ignored completely. bhvr just does not give a fuck about the people that this issue is happening to because its only a small amount of people and they don't know what's causing it either.
---
Survivors can run solo with 1 exhaustion perk and do just fine. I say this for a reason. There is no ‚Äúbest‚Äù, it just depends on your playstyle and what you want.
---
Hate face campers? Use kindred. Want to be a MVP and save your team in a bind? Borrowed time. Want a boost of help when shit is going sideways? Adrenaline. Want to avoid a possible tunnel? DS. There‚Äôs so many variations.
---
You need 1 exhaustion perk of your choice plus 3 perks that you want. Honestly, and I say this with respect, don‚Äôt go MoM/DS/DH/Arenaline. It‚Äôs a meta build but it‚Äôs only good with good survivors. If you can‚Äôt loop, the killer will just shit all over you and those perks won‚Äôt help all that much.
---
This is why I play with the one perk that alerts you when the killer is looking your way. I have the worst eyesight and have trouble spotting killers a lot and it's a godsend.
---
He literally talked about his superiority complex at Twitchcon, and how his Twitch fame boosted his ego. Naturally telling all your fans "I'm just using you to get a hard on" doesn't get you a lot of popularity points.
---
It's even worse than no mither! They puke on everything. You can see where they've been by infected objects in the enviroment. They can't hide in lockers cause, well, puke all over the one they're hiding in. And constant retching noises too.
---
Well I'm gonna go play the game instead of argue with an incompetent, ignorant idiot on Reddit. You're not worth my time. Have a good day
---
I'm fairly certain most people are in agreement with you on this. It sucks to be in a game with only 3 players and it sucks to lose your offering when you get dodged at the start of a game
---
well I have the wiki as a Source, in case you didnt read that.
---
Also I have never seen anyone get a Splinter in the Blood Web if they have the Killer.
---
As well, that I honestly doubt that you get sooo many Splinters that it really hinders your progression.
---
Now I will gladly "stfu"
---
Its a lomg story OP, but basically because it now doesnt punish anyone for dcing people will just dc whenever instead of just playing the game. Though some are just regular game dc's.
---
Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Mettle of Man and Self-Care. Thats the most "OP" I can think of.
---
Also good with certain Freddy builds. But that‚Äôs it. The perk is garbage.
---
Killer main here, you do see the broken status so that's how you know if it's deliverence
---
I guess you drug them first then. I mean most kids do throw a fit whenever an old guy is harassing them
---
Pharmacy with ace in the hole is a fun combo to me but most people would probably consider it a waste of perk slots.
---
I mean he aint wrong tho
---
I have only ever camped someone that teabagged me and that‚Äôs bc it‚Äôs the official rebuttal to being teabagged.   Otherwise if I play killer, it‚Äôs to have fun with Survivors and IDC about kills as much as chases and points and skill building. If a Survivor teabags in the exit gates I just laugh because thats just beyond pathetic. (Especially considering I‚Äôm not an aggressive Killer so why gloat?)
---
Cuz you‚Äôre prob not facing good survivors lol
---
Since we didn't see reworked Freddy in the leaked build, it's likely that there are several developer builds. 
---
This one was for the team working on Ghostface, the Freddy rework team have another and the Survivor/map team(s) have another.
---
Interesting, on console the achievement is labeled adept feng
---
I have a couple of rules set in stone when I play killer:
---
1. Don't tunnel or camp. If someone gets unhooked in front of me, go after the person who unhooked.
---
2. If one person DCs, I play normal. If two people DC, it becomes a farming game. I'll message the two remaining survivors and let them know.
---
I do not care about my killer rank. I do not care about 4K. I care about trying to apply pressure to everyone and being a good host.
---
Far too often I've been on the opposite side as a survivor - some games I'll barely see a killer cause he's tunneled one survivor for ten minutes, that's boring as hell.
---
No, even when i play with a friend or 2. The randoms are always the first to die, they don't do any gens or heal, they lead killer to us, etc
---
Nah, 2 is at least unintentionally funny and the party scene is fairly decent. 5 is way worse, but at least the kills in it were pretty cool.
---
What was the info? I decided to watch the series in preparation and there‚Äôs no Ghostface at all in the first two seasons. So it seems like the only part of the series it could come from is the forever-upcoming season 3. However, that‚Äôs supposed to take place in Atlanta but the Ghost‚Äôs add-ons mention Florida. Sadly, kinda seems like it might be an original survivor (if there is one). I want Sidney üò≠
---
Yea, but you have a 0% chance to play with a full premade as a solo survivor, but a decent chance as killer
---
Lol you're the one doing the harassment here kid.
---
You haven't even seen harassment buddy ;)
---
Wait doesnt this mean the genderswap filter will work on mike
---
Repost
---
If i can find the post again i will link it here for you! i dont remeber exactly what was said other than we probably wasnt getting sidney Q\_Q
---
That's pretty much it. Survivors get mad when a killer plays sensibly.
---
Buddy, its not like I care but you should create another account this one isn't lasting. You've literally commited crimes here.
---
Why do you think it's only 3 months old
---
Inb4 all the survivor main butthurt lectures about respect and human decency.
---
Try restoring licenses via the settings or rebuild the database from safe mode or both.
---
Traditionally, a hitbox is just the region of space centered around (hopefully) a model during a specific frame of its animation where hits can be registered (through contact with the killers "hurtbox," or the region of space that can "hit" things during a specific frame of *their* animation).
---
It's exceedingly unlikely that either of these have major issues, and more likely than not when people are saying they have an issue with "hitboxes," they either have an issue with latency, or maybe animation speed. Or sometimes people just don't think the killer should be able to whack people on the other side of the window (when they are both ***right*** next to the window, not a distance away).
---
That's why I made this post, so that we can come up with language that clarifies if someone is actually talking about a ***real*** hitbox, or one of those other issues. It's too much work to make people stop using the word incorrectly, so we just need a new word that can have the original meaning.
---
I'm not saying I expect it all to happen overnight. I'm an animator myself - I know how much work is involved. It's just the sort of thing that would benefit from extra work as time goes on.
---
People watch uncut streams longer then that, but this is mostly for ma different maits I've played with throughout the years, I've neatly marked time stamps for them :)
---
File a ticket with their customer support
---
Thats the longest you can go without going crazy for attention? Lol
---
i did, i was just curious if anyone had this happen before
---
Maybe he only got 2k points and wanted to lose some pips
---
Finally a comment that isn't hate
---
The deadline comes near...
---
I‚Äôm having issues but when I get into matches, I‚Äôve messaged killers and survivors and they‚Äôve all said they had issues but weren‚Äôt having them anymore (but I still was)
---
Not the point. I don't care about getting 4 SWFs as survivor, or 3 SWFs. I only mention SWFs as killer. I just want competent teammates for once when i play survivor, SFW or not
---
Yep I agree with you. As a killer main it makes me so salty that I tunnel them so they feel what the unhooked person feels.
---
Since when survivors are keeping their items after they DC-ed? 
---
*I don't remember keeping them*
---
Yeah. The game would be better if every single  Survivor just stoped playing
---
Not a meme. That's exactly how I feel
---
I give you that, the first hit might me too easy to get. That beeing said though, survivors still get the small sprintburst after getting hit with Frenzy, so I don't see it as such a big problem tbh.  
---
Oh and sorry I dodn't respond to your idea, I think the problem with that would be it would be way to time cosuming again, considering survivors will get another sprint burst after you hit them.
---
It's going to be hell, especially considering the amount of times I try to get a protection hit on an injured teammate, and the killer acts like I'm not even there and tunnel visions the injured guy. The only time I can force a hit is when I body block a narrow hall/door. And by then, the survivor is far enough away where it rarely gives me my protection hit
---
I'm just saying, cuz out of SWF and solos, there's more of a chance solos are incompetent, so that's why one feels killer=play against good survs and surv=play with herpderps
---
There is no strategy. The game randomly places you in a lobby with a random killer. The only way to get remotely close is to have similar ranks and hope the killer lobby is not full.
---
Just a reminder is that it is a bannable offense to help the killer if you know who the killer is. It is considered griefing other players so be aware if you are attempting it.
---
Wym recreation? You literally just added a background to the decisive strike icon.
---
The mask and the veil are perfect. Nice work!
---
Lmao I run ruin.. it helps maybe 20%of time but mostly a waste of a perk spot
---
I keep getting on, getting into a lobby, and then get told I have no connection.
---
It's weird. I don't mind it as much lately, because I just give it right back to them and I tend to play better when I'm shaking my head after downing someone, looking up at the hooked person, etc. I'll never do it first, but I'll give it right back.
---
Had this happen. I just turned off my console and boom it fixed itself. Also heard it works for PC but idk if that's true good luck tho.
---
Thank u
---
Damn it they are down
---
It needs to have a stun no matter what. The problem with Legion before is they can just hit, hit hit you, avoid all pallets and windows with no counter play. Even with the small speed burst it would be way too strong.
---
Gj you picked up a stick
---
Seems like it, just happened to me too
---
Try playing killer, survivors cry a lot more, its very fun.
---
Yup seems like it.
---
Killers run noed reguardless.. people play Billy because once you master him hes so easy to get kills with.  I see the same amount of Billy's, with or without MoM...
---
When Rank 20 killers play Legion. üòÇ
---
Had a Nea just urban evasion with a BNP good thing I found her and made her taste my vomit. Match probably lasted 30 minutes
---
When you get that 4 man dc
---
I play killer! Lmaooo
---
I can‚Äôt get on either
---
Now we need a megathread so we don't see 200 posts about servers being down
---
Just change your user name to Roamin‚Äô Showers.
---
I‚Äôm getting the same thing. Pretty good job devs.
---
Yup, seems like it to me
---
Even when I get into a lobby as a solo survivor with a 3 man SWF. They still seem incompetent ;~;
---
Feelsbadman
---
legit just came here to ask this very same question. I'm in a party with friends but I'm playing killer to kill some time and for some reason, I got DC'd just as I finished the game. I got my bloodpoints and daily done but I lost two pips as if I DC'd. The strange part was that I was never disconnected from the party.
---
Same here
---
Run ds! For these exact situations
---
Don't listen to him he fantasizes about 10-year-old boys
---
Can confirm. No internet connection and Save Game Errors - code 107.
---
No one cares about your opinion, pedophile
---
XD yes monstruos shrine every bw level
---
You‚Äôre welcome.
---
I don't call running the killer for 3 minutes and no gens being done my fault.
---
And I don't call hooking a survivor before every hook save until gens are all done and getting no kills my fault.
---
I face the most toxic survivors, and they always know which gen is nearly done, and where I am.
---
Was probably from the server crash that just happened
---
the idea that the game wasn't designed for SWF is such a myth, they always intended to have it in the game and they've said so on multiple streams - they just struggled to implement it when the game was first released, so it was a later addition. plus the data sheets the devs released recently make it pretty clear that the majority of survs u come up against aren't elite 4 man swf squads - and that even when they are, the survival rate is only marginally higher than for solo players.
---
When you're about to hit a survivor but your frenzy runs out.
---
God I love that noise.
---
Pedophile
---
She's pretty fun.
---
It‚Äôs a quick time event, stop the circle when the xp is a high positive
---
So happy I got this game for free and so happy I never put money into it's dlc. The game devs are amateurs and it shows.
---
Hag is awesome, but I find that I have to be a bit ruthless to do well with her. I'm less discerning with Hag. I'm not looking before I swing when I teleport. My favorite builds are instadown focused with her. Having Haunted Grounds pop when you have your traps set can be incredible. Like, game over in 15 seconds type stuff.
---
Meh, she's pretty fun to me.

Servers crashed a few mins ago
---
Think servers are down on PS4.
---
Oh shut up
---
Sure thing I need to hack into my PS4 first though lol j/k I know you are talking to the other guy, I even uninstalled and reinstalled but no difference
---
It‚Äôs only about 1% of killers that actually do tunnel and camp. It‚Äôs a shame when it happens because it ruins the game completely.
---
You wanna say it to my face, punk?
---
Servers back up
---
They are back up
---
you look so good as julie!! (im assuming julie lol) are you at TCC b/c if so imma be real mad i didnt go lol!
---
facts
---
I didn't click on a DBD post expecting to read the phrase "torrent of cum" but now i'm interested
---
What a kind daddy you are :)
---
I'm referring more to his built in insidious than NOED, I wouldn't have needed NOED to chase them down. It makes the hatch stand off impossible for the survivor as they'll come to the hatch and you can just close it like in the gameplay. The invisibility and insidious gives the wraith an advantage other killers don't have.
---
Agreed. This game is totally balanced. Except when I lose, then its shit tier and I'm uninstalling.
---
/r/dbdgonewild You're welcome
---
I went to yorkshire cosplay con
---
What makes wraith low tier? Genuinely curious I play him the most and seem to do better with him than other killers.
---
Y'know, I doubt I'll get it on time. I never was a great storyteller. I was stuck at one point and haven't really done much since.
---
Wait what? you aren't even using dead hard...
---
I know that's why I wear the Canadian trapper mask. Yes I am stereotyping ok don't kill me.
---
L O U D  B O I
---
Those reflexes to use dead hard in that amount of time tho, well played dude
---
When you get ‚Äúreworked‚Äù so you‚Äôre more fun to play against but the survivors still DC
---
Since rank reset PS4 has been a mess. Couldn't play for 48 hours because of lobby problems, and today its starting again.
---
Why would you use Distressing on Myers?
---
Yep. Especially considering I've gotten survivor adept achievements while barely black pipping.
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Yeah, typo.
---
Why is everyone being so uptight? I once tried to snipe a killer's lobby only because we wanted to play against each other and didn't want a 1v1 , but we weren't going to team up.   
---
I think you have to remove each other from your friend list on steam though.
---
somewhat similar: pre game chat i told everyone I had borrowed time, yet they would race me to hooks so they could be the ones to pull survivors off, getting them killed.
---
seriously wtf xD
---
Hitbox 2: Electric Boogaloo
---
Ouch
---
Thanks for letting me know!
---
Id like it to be that the surv‚Äôs get the full 1st hook to try or not, and it just doesn‚Äôt let you do the second stage/struggle snuggle stage
---
we need the Ancestor as a killer.
---
Wut
---
I had a match with a Billy that ruined all of us the entire game. At the end it was me and another survivor who had a key. The survivor came after me and went for the hatch, opened it and jumped in. I ran to do the same but the killer almost spawned to me and closed the hatch in my face and hooked me.
---
Next match, a Billy. He kept seeing me and ignored me, hooked me once and then let me go on several occasions. Somehow I had the feeling it was the same guy, but only at the end I saw the bamr, after he killed everyone and gave me the hatch. He messaged me and said he felt bad for the previous game
---
The meme?
---
Even ‚Äúescape without being downed using only unique perks‚Äù or something wouldn‚Äôt be nearly as difficult as the current adept killer achievements.
---
Was DH reworked? I remember, that is was useless perk. Killers predicted it pretty often.
---
I haven't unlocked Ace yet but I do want to draw him soon!
---
Same! And getting a good item from it was just so good.
---
Don't think so, how do you even prove someone was watching your stream anyway?
---
I mean, DBD doesn't have a Ninja to babysit and protect from fake reports like Epic Games did
---
Sure did. On her Corrupt Purge. Because it's an offensive action. But her Vile Purge is not an offensive action. And survivors frequent not cleansing against her. So I said bet and started being okay with no cleansing since that means it'll only cost me one stack to do anyone since they'll enter broken from my M2. 
---
Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
Its been balanced around SWF being in the game for a long time now.
---
SWF isn't a secret we're keeping from the devs. They know about it.
---
HAHSHAHAHALOLOLLOOLLLKMALMAO
---
What are you talking about? The game isn't over yet. If someone gets caught when the gens are finished/doors are open how did they out play you?? That makes no sense. If they outplayed you no one would be on the hook and we wouldn't be talking about this. If you feel bad about securing a kill when it's the last objective left then idk what to tell ya. Maybe killer isn't for you.
---
Get the devs to stop giving you ATM, maybe you'll be better in the future and they will too.
---
Waiting 60 seconds isn't the worst thing in the world. But having to do it as a killer just because some survivors have tiny chance to escape due to their perk loadout, when the game could have been over is annoying.
---
Third person helps.
---
Well ho-ho-hokay then. More power to you.
---
Dream Child was so bad. Probably the second worst.
---
wait really damn I felt like playing
---
Honestly, whenever I go against Trapper I can't get mad if he kills me. Sometimes, I deliberately close my eyes at his Ruin totem...yeah, mea culpa.
---
Yeah, I get ya, but my point is that wraith is rendered completely undetectable making him the strongest killer at hatch during EGC. As you said even if a killer can hide their terror radius they can't hide themselves or visa versa.
---
Check out Montos vault master Myers and Wraith vids. Off-meta, but really catches the survivors off guard.
---
I have never seen someone get LEGION this right.
---
I just hate RNG deciding if I win or not. I don't respect it and I don't expect anyone else to.
---
I mean, okay? If they don't want to be good at killer, then what's the point of NOED boosting themselves up to higher ranks?
---
Tempting Purge
---
Corrupt Goblet
---
hmmm
---
I it weird that I high-key want Kirby to be the new survivor?
---
Yeah honestly from my experience Freddy's and trappers are the nicest idk why they just are. Maybe because they take alot of skill  but honestly you shouldn't ignore the ruin  whatever though.
---
Yea I mean, they trash talk everyone. The best compliment you‚Äôre gonna get is them calling you a tunneler.
---
Same
---
And he behaved like a child after the second ban. I already didn't respect him for cheating, but his behavior just made it worse.
---
Oh god. The official maps are already fucked up as it is, and don't even want to begin think about what it would be like playing on user generated ones.
---
He also gave himself legacy he didn't earn.
---
I just wish that hitting the unhooker during the animation would down them and put the person back on the hook. It's good play to down someone immediately after they were unhooked in front of you, but so many survivors take advantage of that invulnerability period to unhook without consequences to themselves.
---
I know I can grab them, but the grab seems to be wicked picky about when it wants to go off. Something more reliable that wouldn't punish the other person would be nice.
---
PS4 has been a mess since rank reset. 
---
Random players get dead lobbies and crashing games no matter the rank for a couple days, then can play for a day and then it comes back. I say this because theres people saying they are good but theres also people that got the same very weird problem.
---
This issue came out of nowhere.
---
Is BHVR doing random servers tests? Because I can't think of anything else.
---
I've posted and seen plenty of recordings from console and this doesn't happen. Your frames are consistent throughout the whole game except for that moment, you aren't fooling anybody.
---
I don't get it, can someone explain?
---
Dude‚Äôs probably having a bad day and needed to vent a bit.
---
It has been a mess on PS4 for me since rank reset, and I didn't touch anything from my setup. 48 hours I couldnt play the game because the lobbies were dead (at rank 14) and the 2 games I got into I crashed or the others crashed. I was able to play for a couple days and now its happening again.
---
The only thing I can think of is BHVR doing random server/matchmaking tests.
---
M1 killer, not hard to loop, map control isn't fantastic
---
as a legion main i disagree because even when i win i dont have fun
---
This is true, they're incredibly nice. It's kinda funny when I meet one that's not. Met a super racist one once.
---
Anti Vax Nea
---
Calm your tits.
---
'Outplayed' doesn't mean you've completely lost. It just means they've managed to do 5 gens while you've not even secured 1 kill. That's a bad killer performance. Definitely outplayed, on the way to losing.
---
In that scenario I would soft patrol the hook/the door. Encourage someone to try to save so I could maybe get 2 kills. 
---
If I just face camp, I guarantee one kill but lose the chance for two, and it's not fun for me or for the survivor on the hook.
---
I find that ranks 11-14 are right where my skill level is and I'd love to just sit there and have a blast forever.
---
Then rank reset happens....
---
Rank 2 and it still scares me
---
Ok idk why this looks like text in a 1990 RPG game on a PC
---
When you stun The Pig she lets out a really cute oink/squeal
---
Just make madness acullty do something useful then hes fine.
---
This was never about anything that can be considered mean lie Tunneling or FaceCamping. That's a different realm. "Respecting the 4%" is not a community rule against a toxic action. That's just some entitled Survivors who believe they should be rewarded for luck.
---
Yeah you're right it's super picky on grabbing someone and I don't know if that's a connection thing or if it's simply a how it was designed thing. I don't know about downing them mainly due to campers and how hard it would be to save then. A lot of ideas are shut down because of the factor some people would abuse the shit out of it. 
---
The other day I was playing against a super campy Huntress who sat on hook. Like litterally right next to it. No looking around no Insidious just standing there waiting to pull you off. I had to trick her by baiting her for the try to pull off. She hit me so I pulled the guy off with borrowed. It's situations like those you have to think about too at the same time it's a nice idea but I think it should be something else. I mean they punished farming by if they get hit in this time no points for you and theres supposed to be a thing where camping killers get less points for camping however I don't know how that works that's simply what I've seen people saying and what I've heard them say.
---
I did write how they can make madness better in my post tho.
---
About 40% on console. Red, purple and green ranks included.
---
They might be putting out a hotfix.
---
Mission Failed: We'll get 'em next time.
---
Been playing about an hour since my last post and I‚Äôm now convinced it‚Äôs up to at least 80% on PS4. üòÇ
---
Yep I always try to be as nice as a Canadian just don't know how they can keep being that nice all the time.
---
I am a Legion main, and I agree (Granted my idea of 'winning' is 4 BBQ stacks and at least 2 kills).
---
The Bunnymom and Piggo ones also apply though.
---
[here!](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests#latest)
---
Man he showed that wall what‚Äôs good
---
If closing the hatch took ten seconds survivors would jump into it while it was being closed. Opening the gate as the killer is the queue to end the game. Having it take almost as long as a survivor is fucking stupid.
---
And idgaf about blood warden. I don't run it.
---
It helps advertise your channel without getting in people's face about it. But even then it still doesn't make it right to stream snipe.
---
It came in 2 weeks after launch. Ofc its been in mind every update since, it takes 2 seconds to think the thought through.
---
Yeah the whole "Getting hit by M1 makes the survivor stronger" thing seems a bit off to me?
---
Wish the devs would see this so they could think it over or something cuz the change they're proposing still sucks :/
---
Then he died of heroine OD
---
The devs said they won't do anything about it (unfortunately) but I heard it's a bannable offence on Twitch
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah, sorry, didn't mean to say they should be downed. Just they should be interrupted, and downed if they would've been otherwise. It's just unpleasant that they can take this damage, and walk away no matter what.
---
As for killers being penalized for camping, they lose percent on their chaser(?) emblem if they're within 16 meter of the hook. They don't actually lose points.
---
Hmmm doctor main seems inaccurate. I love to defeat stealth players with my m2.
---
Tier 1 Myers still wins. Try it in a KYF game.
---
It was still an unitended effect of the DS mechanic to only start a bit after the pickup animation started. Sure the decs can say it's fine to use, but that hard√∂y makes it a counter, especially since it only worked if you were in spitting distance of a hook.
---
Yeah as i said, punishing DCs is not a perfect solution, but it is a step in the right way.
---
Yes they have to give up a perk slot to gain more bloodpoints, but survivors also have 16 perks available. Aura readings of the killer are sparse and quite punished (like object of obsession) because knowledge what the killer does without him seeing you is probably the strongest thing a survivor has. 
---
It also wouldn't work with taking hits for WGLF stacks, Maybe each stack giving a bit of healing speed buff. Like 5% per stack totaling at 20% and stacking with botany.
---
Ah, thank you. I haven't got a lot of killers yet so I don't know, and I don't play survivor.
---
I would love if you could share this skill of yours with me so I can check and prove your proficiency in it. I never really met someone that could vacuum me towards a ~~dick~~ pallet well enough, and I think you are the chosen one. Please leave you ~~phone number~~ survivor name, so we can meet in The Fog and perform the act of vacc.
---
If only this idea wasn't garbage and abusable. 
---
Tip 1. Run kindred.
---
Tip 2. It's a game, get over it.
---
More like...
---
 it's the Nurse and the Wraith
---
LOL love the horror sound effect, its so fitting.
---
She'll literally blink out of prison üòÇüòÇ
---
Been having this problem since at least Wednesday. Think it might have something to do with the shrine of secrets update?
---
End of the game. 3 left, both doors open. One on the hook near the other exit gate to me.
---
I've gone back to get them off the hook and got the trappers attention so ran him away in the hopes the nea in the gate near to the hooked guy would go for the save. Takes the whole time I'm chased, then downed and picked up for them to attempt the save (with me shouting pull them off the hook you can see I'm being chased and his time is almost up! At the screen the whole time)
---
They end up in a trap, hooked guy dies.
---
I get put on a hook and off the trapper goes to get his new victim. My first time on the hook so might as well attempt to get myself off which I do! So I run for the gate I was at originally and heal up.
---
Other survivor on the hook I begin to go back for an attempt to pull them off but they Kobe themself off the hook so I go to the gate only for them to get down again 10 seconds on, back on the hook. I head over but killer is camping a bit and timer is almost out at this point so I turn tail and leave. No point us both dying as there wasn't time for me to save.
---
This was the saltiest survivor in the post game chat. Like I get it it sucks but it's not like I got off the hook and left straight away you saw me come back and scope out the situation both times you were on that hook.
---
Do u know ur nat type?
---
No, its patrolling. Camping is when you literally dont move further than 10 feet away from a hooked survivor so anybody even attempting to go for the save is taking a near gauranteed hit for it
---
No. The survivors will ABSOLUTELY accuse you of camping,but you really don't have any other choice unless they expect you to run across the map for no reason and let them get the save.
---
No.
---
"Soft patrolling."
---
No we do. It's just our fun comes at the cost of yours.
---
Krueger: Me, asking for something  
---
Survivor: my Mom  
---
Pallet: "we have it at home"
---
Funny enough, my rule when I'm playing killer sounds like this: did you respect your teammates during the game? If there's a guy who throws pallets as soon as he sees those or a person was hanging on the hook for 2 stages till sacrifice without me camping, no hatch guys. But overall I like to respect 4%, I don't really want to kill anyways, just sum points
---
&gt; Yeah i‚Äôm getting a lot of messages from the last match I was in. 
---
You just gotta get use to that, the other side will complain that you aren't playing by their rule set.
---
It's dbd. Currently, the new patch screwed around with the audio and is being looked at. 
---
The audio behind walls has really been screwed. When you have a wall blocking the source of audio, it really quietens the audio making gens much harder to patrol. Survivor footsteps have also been tampered with.
---
The Devs have acknowledged this and are planning on releasing fixes for it at some point. Prob with the Freddy patch.
---
When you just accept your fate for the sake of hitting through the pallet. ;)
---
I didn't say that i don't like it.
---
Its just cool that everyone can cosplay a character without wasting 1k dollars.
---
Am I the only one who picks up the trash perks just so they can't appear on my bloodweb again??
---
No, that‚Äôs patrolling, and you shouldn‚Äôt care. Do whatever you need to, as long as it‚Äôs not cheating, to kill the survivors. If you have camp, tunnel, whatever to kill them, do it. It‚Äôs you job, and you shouldn‚Äôt let survivors dictate how you play.
---
That's a weird way to spell 'Entity'...
---
Honestly? They need to separate the ranking and win/loss mechanism. That, I think, is the biggest issue with why killers feel the need to 4K. With the new ranking system, you essentially have to either 4K or somehow drag out the match for ten minutes, when most of them end within five, in order to be told you won. People like to win at games, but the ranking system isn't supposed to pair you up with other people who win/lose as much as you. It's supposed to pair you up with people who are about as good as you, which is different from winning or losing. As long as these are treated the same way, there will be a perception issue.
---
Have you ever considered you rocked their worlds because 4 different people who dont know each other or are communicating with each other are playing against you? You as the killer get to play judge and sometimes you're an unreasonable judge. But I know you dont see it that way, that's why I dont say anything after game, the game let's you, as the killer, choose so why not... right? I know you're more than just the moment you play DBD, but I still think its moments like this where after 300 hours and less than a handful of Kobes you'd consider the likelyhood and get some kudos after game. Seriously. 2 times killer wasnt close. 1 time killer let me go, 3 or 4 times I was hit as soon as I jumped off and put back on the hook. And lemme tell you, I have never teq bagged, I dont sand bag, I dont body block, and I dont use a flash light. So...
---
Yeah i spent 10/15 pounds on it. I already owned all the clothes and stole my boyfriends hoodie.
---
The thing is there must be 3 gens left not only 2, so yeah you pretty much camped since there was probably another generator more far away from the hook.
---
*Freddy walks over*
---
"Looks like I missed something"

PC is the same. Used to be great pings before last update, now it's usually red.

Skulls for the Skull Throne after all.

I play clown and I like playing around and memeing

Yea and im saying thats all he needs
---
Yeah and make you take at least 2 perks
---

---

---
The amount of N√∏kk memes I‚Äôve seen is insane, not complaining though, love every single one.
---
XD
---
Zekeo had already done that in the past
---
Self Care (can‚Äôt rely on teammates
---
Adrenaline
---
Exhaustion perk
---
Aftercare (so you can see everyone‚Äôs aura, super good for solo play)
---
Normally I would, but after getting Streetwise a legit 7 times in a row I just had to know how long the game would keep the streak going.  Got it 4 more times before it was broken.  I don‚Äôt know how rigged the web is or if it was just one of the lowest rarity perks I had left to unlock (though, there are still several yellow level perks I don‚Äôt even have and lvl 1 streetwise is green, so IDK) but it‚Äôs just become a meme for me at this point.
---
If I see bbq and spies from the shadows im takin bbq lol
---
I suppose the issue with Leatherface is that in comparison to Hillbilly, his counterpart, he is massively inferior. Majority of his add-ons come from Hillbilly aswell which is frustrating as his personal add-ons are useless.
---
Leatherface himself isn't a terrible killer. He gets looped like all the other killers but his chainsaw allows him to punish mistakes made by the survivor. I would definitely no rate him the worst killer but he certainly isn't anywhere near the top killers. Against good survivors, he is more or less an M1 killer that can take advantage of pallet dead zones.
---
I agree that the Doc should be buffed. His add-ons can kind of band-aid his power, especially the pallet illusion add-ons but other than that he is an M1 killer with decent tracking abilities. Perhaps having more illusions or making some of his add-ons his base kit is the best way to go for the Doc.
---
What does BM stand for?
---
rank 1 and it still scares me. 
---
i cant see theough it as survivor or killer. it saddens me.
---
Proxy camping is running around the hook but not leaving. Hence the name camping. If you are patrolling gens and the hook, that is not proxy camping. Proxy campers don‚Äôt patrol gens.
---
That was a lot to digest, but I understand. 
---
I dunno. I just felt like I did not want to reward their overly altruistic behavior. Also I did not want to wait however long it was going to take the Kobe survivor to fix 2 generators for the door to spawn.
---
Hillbillies after missing their 3rd chainsaw in a row: That‚Äôs it, I‚Äôm gettin me mallet
---
Okay Nurse is not realy comparable to normal m1 killers. And yeah they do get stunned, but only when the fuck up, not when they do what their power intends them to do.
---
Clown at C while Pig sits at B? Could you give the reason why?
---
I‚Äôm not gonna make any friends by saying this, but no. Camping, despite being annoying as shit, is not against the rules. It is a strategy for super altruistic teams that divebomb the hook to save. It makes sense. No reason to punish it. Besides, you have perks to deal with it, for example Kindred.

---
Have fun with Bubba he is really satisfing when you get multiple downs with his ability.
---
Bad boy billy
---
ok.... my shit myself...and got a ***FUCKING nightmares***
---
The only changes I would make would be to swap the Wraith and Pig with the Clown and Doctor, but everything else is accurate.
---
*puts on insidious basement built*
---
Everyone ### get the fuck out
---
&gt; Honestly Ruin is overrated 
---
I agree, i stopped running it on most of my killers, Survivors just need to concentrate a bit and they will hit most of the great skill checks.
---
I usually try and get the killer to chase me. It works sometimes.
---
BT timer doesn't tick down during chases  anymore.
---
What a fucking nice and detailed post.
---
Shame it doesn't get any attention cause it isn't a meme.
---
Don‚Äôt forget about the players that try to message you even after post game chat.
---
Not that controversial. Tiers S to A we all agree, and tiers B, C, D aren't that far between them so it depends on the player.
---
Only that the base fatigue of the nurse is way shorter than legions. Also Legion has to catch up to survivors while the Nurse can just catch up in a single Blink. But thats not really the point, I think you can't compare nurse to other Killers.
---
And this is a good game. You should see the ping on the bad ones.
---
Yep basically sums it up. It's only good versus new players. I don't get how such a mid tier perk has stayed in the meta this long literally so many survivors know how to counter ruin it does nothing anymore.
---
Then dont run it if you think it's a waste?
---
&gt; and noticed there been so many huntress, billy, and nurse players? 
---
These are the only "good" killers, similar to how survivors will typically play the female survivors as they are smaller and thinner, easier to hide in grass with them. Theres really not much choice in this game, as other killers have crippling weaknesses.
---
Pls no
---
But in two minutes it's still still able to slow the game down more than almost any other perk. It eats seven seconds for every skill check that isn't great.
---
Pls Yes
---
This is not a new phenomenon.
---
It is, but in that case its not toxic
---
OP, are you *actually* trying to play this off as real? We're not braindead. We know what jump cuts are.
---
I'm not bad just boosted
---
Its not but it feels alot more common now than before
---
Because ir popped up on the Shrine some weeks ago
---
Hey man, Freddy's right! NOES5 IS underrated!
---
In the higher ranks you will tend to find players using the stronger/higher rated killers so that they have more success in their matches. 
---
Huntress, Nurse and Hillbilly are very good killers with a relatively high skill ceiling. As a result, more experienced players will use more difficult killers and will have much more success while playing them.
---
Because the meta hurts killers besides the few you mentioned plus people use them because everyone puts them top tier making people main them more then others.

---
Yes keep getting kicked
---
I cant even tell how many times I've been playing trapper and someone DC's cause they see I have bloodycoil/iridescent stone. They should just ban people who dc for a week and get then out of the queue so they cant ruin the experience for others.
---

---
camping is when a killer is still inside the map after hooking a survivor
---
Same could be said to those who camp cuz they just need that one kill tho. It's a game, get over it. Saying that isn't productive
---
This is a repost, Christopher
---
Nurse's Fatiuge scales with her blanks.
---
It now works on all players at tier 1.
---
Update 2.6.0 which made ruin apply to all survivors at all tiers is your answer.
---
Originally it would apply to 2 or 3 of the survivors at anything below tier 3. With patch 2.6.0, tier 1 ruin now applies its effect to all 4 survivors.
---
That Clown placing is not good in my opinion. As someone that plays clown a decent amount and have him p2 he is great at ending chases fast getting survivors where he needs them to go plus his add ons are great especially the hindered and exhausted one's.
---
Me too
---
What the fuck is this bullshit
---
PS4 has been a mess since they patched the Shrine
---
Perfection.
---
And why is that?
---
Now it's down, again.
---
Gen tapping is the only way I know how I counter?
---
For sure
---
I wish steam had animated avatars, this would be godly.
---
Anyone remember when youtube had animated avatars?
---
it gave me a 'game save could not be read' error but then worked when i hit X again
---
Bad Mannering. It just means you're doing something in-game for the sake of causing real-world hurt. If you do something b/c you're just trying to play the game and it *ends up* hurting someones feelings or giving them a bad time, that's fine. It's just when you do it on purpose (e.g. facecamping someone b/c you're mad at them, DCing before the killer can hook you just to deny them BP, etc..).
---
Totally not working for me on PS4 in EU
---
I only see a Tapp and a Nea what are you supposed to look at in this photo?
---
PLEASE...I finally got adept trapper after my near sudoku, it helped that the survivors were complete doodoo
---
Cause that's like me bringing in a SWF, 2 of us with BNPs, 2 of us with instant meds, and everyone running dstrike. It's so much extra handicap that it obliterates any and all respect I might have had for you as a player
---
Going to disagree with you on Clown being very bad. You can make survivors drop pallets early, throw a bottle at them on the other side of the pallet and once you've broken the pallet you can easily close the distance between you and the survivor. He doesn't have to go to a locker to recharge his bottles either, so he can keep line of sight on survivors mid chase pretty easily.
---
Search for the totem or power through it gen tapping makes it so much slower. Powering through it may make the gen go a little slower but besides that it does only add maybe 5 seconds
---
I'd say a majority of survivors are still nice and don't BM.
---
Well, I cant say I agree with your past approaches, but I appreciate you taking the time to read my response and I appreciate your calm approach! It's just one of the things that really bugs me as a survivor main. I dont like playing killer for a multitude of reasons,  but I do like to play, and that means someone else is going to have to like playing killer and one of the many things that means is I'm playing against a person. And I feel like it's always important to remember.
---
I agree the obsession should be effected in a different way than non-obsession. I've ran into MANY 4-man "Shit Sandwich" (DH, MoM, Adrenaline, Instaheals) users and it's annoying when you see them flash white and you're like "Seriously? You're fucking running it too?"
---
I don't know if the protective hit thing would be a good change. 
---
Either way it's frustrating to deal with currently.
---
I'm like 90% sure that when someone DCs, there is a risk I'll also be kicked back to the menu as killer. It's happened three times on my first down and sometimes after the first few shocks on Doctor, precisely when I'd expect people to nope out.
---
Is this suposs to be funny?
---
On the weekend, nice...
---
I made it though
---
On PS4, I'm like 90% sure that when someone DCs, there is a risk I'll also be kicked back to the menu as killer. It's happened three times on my first down and sometimes after the first few shocks on Doctor, precisely when I'd expect people to nope out.
---
And what's weird is that it seems to persist and mess up further games.
---
Still once it breaks you are screwed out of 1 perk. Every survivor at rank 15-1 expects it and it kinda spawns next to them so yeah but honestly this is my opinion.
---
Pig not being S tier is controversial to me.
---
No, I don't know how to check it either ;\_;
---
Yup. Just got kicked out of a game and lost my party streamer. Not too happy about that.
---
Hey, don't shit-talk my Pharmacy!
---
Lol wtf..?
---
Thats why i said base fatigue.
---
Patrick got banned for hacking in legacy for Meg and Nea.
---
I'd be down for this.
---
I want Brenda though
---
I was down for a few minutes but i just loaded into a game..hope it doesn't kick us midway.
---
As a Plague main I‚Äôm shocked how accurate that it
---
This is indeed a  ùìïùìªùìÆùìºùì± Meme
---
r/perfectlycutscreams
---
I think the idea of a perk that grants a free hit is too strong regardless. The potential rework they announced sounds much better, but MoM will still be a really strong perk even if they do go through with the change they've proposed. I think if they're going to implement a caveat to MoM for when you're not the Obsession that they should do something else, but I also don't necessarily think it needs to have a caveat. DS no longer has one after its rework.
---
Myers is the jumpscare master. Now you'll be a bit more careful, always expect the unexpected.
---
(he's also the hottest killer in the game #nohomo)
---
Well yes, but actually no :(
---
Yeah, I think Rotten Fields is the absolute worst. I swear it‚Äôs just the Killer shack, three threshers in the other corners, maybe the meat tree stuck on one side and an ocean of corn between them.
---
Just use Nvidia's game overlays and turn on depth mode and u can pretty much see across the map and especially survivor's items
---
It‚Äôs fine for me. It was down for a bit earlier though and has been dodgy for a while. ;)
---
Oh you shit you right
---
This is clearly a big ~~brain~~ neck Pig player. :)
---
Woah whose the guy on the left???
---
This has been a known issue for a while and was talked about in the last dev stream. While they fix it just  stop repairing right before completing a gen, get the BP and tap it to finish.
---
I was thinking that putting Wraith and Pig higher than Doctor and Clown or putting Trapper the last ( people from this here seem to like Trapper ) will be considered by many people a controversial choice, but idk, maybe I was wrong.
---
You weren‚Äôt a Trapper by any chance were you
---
Better for what? For torture or for actual kills?
---
It looks like servers are down, at least on PS4
---

I would actually love some OC creepy killers. Just anything that would bring fear back into the game and that I wouldn't even want to go near.

I got into the loading screen, hope it works.

Leaked New Killer: Room 1408
---
Clown is probably one of the strongest killers, but he isn't OP. I don't exactly have a problem with his ability, but it's how fast he is. Maybe they can reduce how many times he can throw his bottles and give him a reload buff. His speed is at 4.6m/s \*(Which is the regular speed of Killers). He should be as slow as Hag (4.4m/s) considering the Afterpiece Tonic is used to slow down his victims. Survivor's running speed is at 4.0m/s and under the Hindered effect, it's reduced to 3.4m/s. That's powerful af. 
---
It just doesn't make sense he's as fast as the other killers if his ability is supposed to slow down survivors. Everything else about him is fine.
---
I agree with you on Nurse, OP.
---
Anyway, Huntress is just as broken as Nurse is until hitboxes are 100% fixed. Huntress mains don't need Iridescent hatchets if DbD is making it possible to automatically knock down survivors with headshots. Iridescent hatchets should just give you the Mending status.
---
i was litterally against a bbq, ruin, monitor, bamboozle, joey and julie mixtape build legion today... he/she played susie skin... i forgave him bc of susie... susie is just too pretty to be angry at...
---
You clearly got outplayed. :p
---
‚ÄúReady up, pussy.‚Äù
---
I don't ever remember YouTube having anumated avatars actually.
---
Yeah, been doing that, but usually, forget it so I was salty of getting 14k BP when escaping and doing 3 gens so I posted this wondering if it's only me or not. Thanks
---
Yea I guess but at least sometimes I‚Äôm able to juke him but I can‚Äôt with bubba cause he‚Äôs fucking omnidirectional lol
---
If the gen is completed from X% to 100% then you won't get points, you need to let go when its nearly done and then finish it off and you will only lose a few BP.
---
It's queuing me into lobbies far quicker than normal, but i get kicked from them in 10 seconds or so.
---
This sub loves Wraith and Trapper but everyone agrees they are low tier. The fact that you like a killer doesn't have to collide with the fact that it has it more difficult than other killers against a good team of survivors.
---
I mean, I love Trapper but I know he's low tier and I hate Nurse but I know she's top tier
---
I thought that people will consider my tier list controversial after seeing Wraith or Pig so high or Trapper the last one ( because people from here seem to like Trapper ). Nut idk, maybe I was wrong.
---
I'd say this is at least 87% accurate. Good work.
---
*My interest has been piqued*
---
I had one of them once, he was using the classic funny chase music, making fun of me then i made a sick throw as huntress and he was like Pog, actually dropped a follow, this game lacks some attitude feels like everyone is a bad loser.
---
It has been a mess on PS4 since they patched the Shrine
---
To slow the game down
---
JUST A LITTLE BIT
---
The biggest problem I think is that games end way too quickly in general and Ruin is the only perk that applies map wide pressure from the start of the match. However, I also don't feel like they should simply extend the length of time it takes to repair generators, because survivors already spend most of their time looking at a progress bar. They need to introduce some kind of optional secondary objective for survivors to do that they aren't required to complete but gain a reward once they do, similar to the lanterns or the pustules from the Halloween event. Survivors already earn less bloodpoints than killers do, eapecially because BBQ is so much stronger that WGLF, so perhaps they can earn extra bloodpoints from the optional objectives, but stop earning them if they haven't done any actual progress within a certain amount of time, to prevent people from just spending the entire game not doing gens.
---
Lol I'm sure everything has been said kore than once my guy

Clown is probably one of the strongest killers, but he isn't OP. I don't exactly have a problem with his ability, but it's how fast he is. Maybe they can reduce how many times he can throw his bottles and give him a reload buff. His speed is at 4.6m/s \*(Which is the regular speed of Killers).

That's powerful af.
---
If it stopped a killer could hold a game hostage forever, and campers would just sit outside the minimum radius now
---
I was being toxic and teabagged for 5 mins and went to do that lmao
---
Great Skill Checks grant 0% progression bonus and do not pause the generation repair work, Normally its 2%. So you are losing out on 2% progress each Great Skill Check, which is about 1.6 seconds worth of repairs. You should not tap, instead you gotta learn to hit those Great Skill Checks.
---
or at least make them not lose a pip because of it.
---
I just assume I can't rely on them. I've had way more negative experiences with fellow survivors with "TTV" in their name than positive.
---
Because slowing the game down is the only thing killers can do to survive early game and not many perks do that besides Ruin.
---
Because any time you try to down someone with M1 killers, they always have a second life.
---
What kind of strawman nonsense point are you even trying to make?
---
[Sauce for the bottom pics](https://youtu.be/cJtczkEHq9Y?t=38)
---
As a Billy main I disagree besides if they are camping do a gen and get it done. Sucks for that one guy but we should not be punished for one guy. You also don't seem to understand our point and side as that would butcher both bubba and Billy. You can easily if a good survivor dodge his chainsaw make it hit the survivor on hook and unhook them.
---
the same as yours ü§£
---
One thing they did that clearly revolves around SWFs is the fact that no one can see killer perks or addons until the game is over.
---
Do you know what a strawman is? I can't strawman without a counter argument you absolute twit
---
He's in creative mode
---
How would they get butchered? I mained both of those killers and nothing would change. Please explain
---
Switch version looking great
---
Because even it only last 2 minutes thats almost 2 gens that could be popped without it. 2 minutes can give you enough time to find and hook a survivor before a gen can be completed, and that can give the killer enough momentum to carry through the rest of the match.
---
I'm just saying by your logic if they can be used to camp the survivor then they shouldn't be able to use them right?
---
I mean do you even get to use the "pros" of no mither, like ever?
---
I gotta disagree with that one too honestly, Pig has stall stealth and a little bit of chase potential if you are smart with your ambushes in a chase, whereas Clown just has shit chase. Pig aint good, but I reckon Clown is much worse, like bottom 3 bad.
---
&gt; And saying bubba can only camp with chainsaw is wrong and you know it
---
There is no other reasonable situation where multiple survivors would be within distance of the chainsaw so you could down them both the only time this happens is when you are camping, why do you think people run insidious and camp with LF, also if you know the counterplay then why don't you just outplay him then, its not suppose to be easy to be able to 1v1 the killer.
---
No i dont understand what a strawman is ü§£, the point of my comment is to show you what you posted the other way around
---
It takes Leatherface like 2 seconds to fully charge the chainsaw. All he has to do is facecamp and when a survivor starts the unhook he can charge the chainsaw in time to down them both. It wouldn‚Äôt stop that. The same with Hillbilly.
---
Wraith cannot guarantee a kill with his bell and neither can huntress unless they are iridescent heads. Your point is null and void
---
Penalties for disconnecting, that's a good place to start.
---
Well I want to juggle a chainsaw because I need to wait to hit not wait 5 to 10 second before I can hit them
---
Or 20 seconds if they find at the start which they most likely will
---
Gotta say, though, that was a flawless oink.
---
In game ‚Äòblock‚Äô system to avoid matching with scummy survivors or killers.
---
It also is up to the devs and if they are camping just leave or run decisive
---
i went and searched it in urban dictionary and i dont even understand it
---
When he is revving his chainsaw hug corners really tightly, most bubba players aren‚Äôt too familiar with his chainsaw collision hit box and will hit into the wall
---
I dont do it 3 times.
---
I pick the cheapest perk on prestige 0/1/2 and on 3 i pick all of them.
---
Not since they changed totem spawns, its RNG
---
Yea I like this. I think they should lean heavily into the illusion side of the Doc. Maybe even have an add-on that whener you hook a survivor it will show an illusion hooking animation to the other survivors. So from the survivors perspective it will show 2 survivors on hook and they will have to guess which one is real.
---
Thank fucking god I adepted nurse on ps4 before this system was implemented :)
---
[leak](https://youtu.be/uAWDtXoDmqg)
---
I down them as so long as they haven‚Äôt been toxic and don‚Äôt struggle, I‚Äôll carry them to hatch, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I hadn‚Äôt hooked them anyways before lol
---
Facecamping doesnt hapoen enough to warrant this. Y'all act like youre being face camped every game.
---
Tea bagging causes 30 seconds exhaustion.
---
Its the Phantom and Christine
---
They don't want you to get off noed and rancor because they think you have shit perks, they just want to have fun.
---
Where did you find this gem?
---
considering i play both sides its not a survivor ideal. I play at high ranks with Myers who is a weak killer in map pressure, and mostly adrenaline always goes off. I dont mind it whether i can insta down or not. 
---
also as a counter point NOED isnt worked for in the killer perspective is it? No. It depends entirely on survivors not doing totems and doing 5 gens, survs bitch about NOED and apparently some killers bitch about adrenaline. 
---
To be honest  if one person is only urban evading around the map and not doing gens, thats basically a 3 man game, 5 gens should not get done. That being said, some killers tunnel (not shaming, you play you) and a surv is unable to do a gen. If they get adren last second, then good. 
---
The point of "over powered" perks should be situational. Adren and NOED are both only if endgame occurs, NOED with the exception of totems.
---
and for your statement of "currently its just a fuck you perk to the killer. " To the survivor so is NOED, any Mori, and Instadowns (hatchets/ pinky finger). The sides are meant to hate each other not hand themselves over. 
---
Frankly, it sucks if you have a bad game and 4 adrens pop, but the survs still have to work for it. 
---
I completely understand the requirements needed for adrenaline to go off, but its been a part of the game for a long time and has never caused as much of an uproar as (the old) DS and MoM which are time waster perks requiring literally nothing on the surv parts. At least adren requires a full match, which should give the killer time to get multiple hooks and/or a kill or two.
---
I only hit 0 bp once and i didnt realize it was gonna hit 0 till it  hit 0. I was like no i dont deserve this
---
Your point is aso pretty stupid just because people don't play how you like and if they play a specific killer that can hold their ability you want them nerfed bubba is already low tier making it so he can't hold it for more then 5 seconds will make him bad
---
Charge time would not change... He would still be able to do that... I even think his charge time should be buffed...
---
I‚Äôve also saw someone say because of MoM, but idk
---
Was it against a Freddy? I've had a few people complain about it vs me and seen a few videos of it happening with Freddy.
---
A lot of crying killer mains in my mentions right now because they can't hit chainsaws as bubba and think he's f tier despite the enduring spirit fury meta. And this is coming from a killer main too lmao
---
&gt;"So my suggestion is to make skill checks more common based on repair speed"  
---
Now this is an interesting and pretty darn good idea. I also like the idea of skill checks being made harder, but not "if they're trying to rush", because that's kind of vague. Instead, I think skill checks being made harder for each person working on the same generator makes more sense.  
---
In general, I think skill checks should be made more common, by implementing a max interval between two skill checks. That way, you wouldn't have to deal with either getting 1-2 skill checks on one gen, or 10-12 skill checks on one gen. It would make things a whole lot more consistent, not to mention more interactive, because holding M1 while RNG does the rest isn't that great.  
---
I also believe this interval should carry over, so that survivors can't just tap to avoid skill checks, even if tapping is highly inefficient.
---
My simple suggestion for roundtime-increasing measures has always been to remove the spotlights from generators. That way it is not increasing the time spent on gens, but time spent looking for them. This likewise ups the value of some of the mechanics/perks/items revolving around finding generators.
---
My guess is that games on the maps Lery's Memorial Institute and The Game take longer than games on other maps, on average, due to the simple fact that it takes longer to find generators on them. And with generator spawns already having been more randomized across the board (as well as the possibility to randomize them further), this could go a long way to increase average roundtime without making it more of an M1 chore.
---
This looks like one of Puppet Combo's game. Also, I can't complaing much since I play on the lowest settings and this is almost how the game looks to me...
---
https://imgur.com/XitTUCI
---
The doctor one is inaccurate as fuck
---
Quality of Life is something that wouldn‚Äôt necessarily buff but improve user experience such as perks indicating how long their timer has left like when Make Your Choice got a visual for it.
---
I would consider that a big buff, especially considering in some cases that could end in instant double hit.
---
Where does that quote come from
---
I gotta slow the game down just a little bit haha... I dont have the killermain skills ok!?
---
I say it's ok if they can loop well.
---
If not, then they better cleanse and play safely.
---
I just get to endgame alone too much. Fml
---
Wish you could see daddy Myers doing that to a hooked toxic survivor. I would stay and watch.
---
I only play solo survivor, and i find no problem with it. If the killer camps me i'd be there to waste his time while my team mates do gens.
---
I need ancestor as a commentary youtuber.
---
You just need to use good perks and add-ons and play more. The games changes A LOT when you're using the right perks and add-ons. Just put some blood points on a killer you like and keep improving him.
---
I just want to praise you for maining Freddy, I've tried playing him recently and was just steam rolled by Survivors.
---
Just keep an eye out on most characters animations in the lobby. Feng / Nea etc won‚Äôt cross their arms if they‚Äôre holding an item. So if it looks like they‚Äôre going in with no items but you notice they‚Äôre not doing their usual ‚Äòidle‚Äô pose, then they have a key.
---
Omg are you serious? R you seriously bitching that you cant see a key? It's bad enough killers get to see addons..  I dont get to see killers addons as a survivor..  what type of fuckery is this post
---
Fuck no, Nightmare on Elm street 5 is when I gave up on watching it anymore.
---
DBD needs a killer that causes heartattacks due to stress
---
Unfortunately, this would break a lot of queues, because someone could block you for literally any reason. It would be widely abused to the point of making the game literally unplayable.  
---
I know this, because I played Overwatch when it had such a system, and it was disastrous. They had to remove the feature in order to fix matchmaking.
---
Doing gens is so 2016, let's kick back!
---
It was time for Thomas to kill. He had seen too much.
---
R u stupid? You're comparing dh to an instadown chainsaw? You've lost all logic in this argument
---
Absolutely not. Hitting great skill checks isn't hard after some practice and the totem can be found pretty easily if you look for it.
---
Nope. It just extends the game a bit, and decreases speed to gen completion because of the lack of greats. People think it‚Äôs op when they‚Äôre scared to work through it.
---
It‚Äôs much much stronger than people act. More of an issue than NOED for sure. I rarely use it but when I do I usually have to stop playing for awhile in the trial so it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm just demolishing the survivors with no mercy
---
I think that‚Äôs what the devs use when testing new items or addons
---
Punishing asshole survivors is my favorite part of the game
---
There is no ‚Äúproblem‚Äù. You got face camped. It‚Äôs part of the game. It sucks and it‚Äôs not fun, but some people play like that.
---
You can ruin their game or not, that‚Äôs up to you. Kindred will fuck over a face camper.
---
That's the main problem with this game, and while it effects both sides, it's MUCH worse for Survivors. Because Killers think they're good, or even great, when they get beaten, they constantly complain about how OP something is.
---
I have a friend, who as basically any killer, will almost always 4K regardless of rank or perks.
---
HE is good at the game, and he says killers are a little too strong right now, and i'm inclined to believe him
---
cinematic master piece all the way from the broken hit boxes, to Jeffs head looking everywhere but at the killer when trying to flashlight save xD Everything about this screams console
---
I never understood how people have such a hard time seeing through the corn
---
Against people that have played the game for less than 24 hours yes it is
---
That's Tru. Unless ur too far away then he sees ur aura lol
---
And you deleted the post, nice lol, but you didnt dispute my 4th and 5th points being that free 3/4 of a gen completed for unhooks and survivors can abuse you easy if you can't slug even if a survivor is near the body.
---
yeah, you've got a point. but maybe if the maps had to be approved for them to be public? idk
---
If I remember correctly it's a special skin set for a character. The outfit even says Artifact (insert weapon/outfit). Its the splattered orange glow on a skin
---
That sounds like the last thing anyone would want to play against
---
You aren't obligated to use Ambush as Pig, you can crouch and so baiting the survivor to leave the loop and then uncrouch and get that hit on him. Pig can still gets looped, but Clown gets gen rushed like a joke, I saw Clowns end chases relatively fast and yet still get gen rushed, because he doesn't have map pressure, stall or snowball. Pig's traps are RNG reliant, but at leat she has something to slow down the game, while Clown has nothing. I think Pig needs some buffs, but I think Clown needs even more buffs. Also, Pig is less add-on reliant than Clown and I
---
*so original*
---
DBD is competitive game with a lot of factors. At times it becomes very frustrating, but eventually it will become more fun the more experienced you get. If it's too rough for you, then take a break. Come back after a while and see if you can get back into it.  Playing Killer is all about adapting and overcoming difficult situations. You need experience to improve and adapt, and that only comes with playing and learning from past games to do better.
---
Only survivors who have been hooked become exposed to NOED (to address the issue of campers who use NOED)
---
Then why would it be in the public release?
---
The gen behind the wall being quiet was on purpose, not inconsistent.
---
Was about to say, even pre-rework: "I'M ONLY HAVING FUN IF I WIN"
---
sounds like Legion mains were probably having as much fun with Legion as the survivors then
---
Stabbing is for fun. Impaling is for killing.
---
Nah, it's fine. It's just boring.

Splattered orange glow? Do you mean Legacy?

What about the Legion attack on the gay?

Tru3 is that you?!
---
That's a great suggestion. I can't tell you how many times I've done gens and I've had 2 to ZERO skill checks. Also wish they'd make gen tapping proc automatic skill checks. Also have seen tons of people flying through gens even with Ruin on and when I come up to the gen, there's at least 2-3 survivors on one Gen just tapping. Fine, don't make the gens longer, but that idea of making things more difficult is a good one. Like the way Brand New part works. Rapid fire skill checks.
---
It's literally targeted harassment. What world do you live in where that's not a problem
---
Click on his channel, theres plenty of Thomas the Destroyer ‚Ñ¢ in there
---
He accused us of being a swf because his lack of pressure allowed us to gen rush while he chased a Bill for most of the match, he placed a trap near me while I was on the hook at the endgame, but SAW said Bill rushing towards me, and when my Adrenaline activated we rushed to defend the injured Bill who took a hit to get the hook.  3 of us left injured, none dead because he walked away in anger when he was up Bill‚Äôs butt because Nea was ready to take a hit.
---
You might have. I'm not sure what rarity Legacy would be. :/
---
It is. I changed it immediately once the name change came out and nothing happened.
---
Poor Susie.
---
So he never lost it in the first place? Damn, that was not a smart move.
---
This is WHY I put ttv in my name üò©üò© gimme the Mori
---
I often find it's because they can't do that to a good killer. You know how a bully will pick on someone to make themselves feel better; well that's a toxic survivor. They don't have any real skill so they bully those with less skill than themselves. It's sad, but a reflection of what happens in most communities IRL.
---
I changed mine with 0 issue so I think you'd be fine
---
Ripperoni my backeroni
---
Dbd was never affected by it
---
Holy Christ that must be terrifying. You look around in a panic to see where he's heading from only to find out he's already downed your friend
---
LMAO he got Soo mad :)
---
I mean I have almost 1k hours on DBD and I've been rank 1 survior and killer every season since my 2nd month of the game I feel people just lack common sense in this game
---
That mask is cute and awesome btw I‚Äôm planning on making my own during the summer. Any close where you got the face mold for the mask by chance?
---
That's it!
---
Legit i got it off amazon. Its been spray painted white (reccommend primer) and had used watercolor to get the desired decor.
---
killers and survivors get used to their enemies being bad, be probably played after Rank Reset and thought he was a god then ranks start normalizing again and...
---
Or, he's trying to spread fake news so we get surprised more
---
Hahaha is that a Monto reference? Anyhow, stay creative and have a nice day!
---
Unless you play Nurse, this is more or less the killer experience.
---
Why does it make it better that you failed, Like it feels like something that would happen in the legion. Great cosplay btw
---
That's because not even the Entity is foolish enough to screw with Daddy Myers.
---
Tysm and it makes it better because perfectly cut scream
---
Yup just you, praise be bkuuretsu the enlightened one. Whatever could giving head(iridescent at that) mean?
---
Me first discovering flashlights on ps4
---
It's the killers job to kill. It's the survivors job to survive . Simple as that XD
---
I recommend balanced landing to extend loops, adrenaline as an escape plan, self care for obvious reasons, and either spine chill or bond. Spine chill is invaluable for giving you a heads up when a killer is on the way or they see your aura (even invisible killers) and bond gives you invaluable information about what your team is doing (helpful with no communication so you don't run for the same save as someone else etc).
---
I changed it on day one and I didn't lose anything. Matter of fact the game is listed as safe on the name change site
---
Why is this viewed as a matter of respect or being a cunt?
---
It's part of the game, isn't it? Sure, it's frustrating as hell to go against and severely imbalanced, but there's nothing inherently wrong with it morally or ethically speaking.
---
I'm no fan of playing against a coordinated 4 man SWF, trust me, but why moralize them as lesser or malicious because of it? Seems lame to me.
---
The worst is when you get the 'immersed' ones - nothing drags a team down worse than having two or more stealth survivors.  Not everyone needs to meet up for tea and bisscuits, but if everyone is off on separate far corners of the map working their own gens and hopping in lockers at the very first heartbeat, you're gonna have a bad time
---
I changed mine as well. And didnt have anything wierd happen
---
Do you mean "seppuku"?
---
It's been around since the beginning, but it's kinda died out.
---
Shut the fuck up already, all you do is bitch and complain about a game you got for free anyway, good that you are done responding bitch, get the fuck off my subreddit
---
Wait, who heart is it? I mean is not his, or.. Jeez can't Wraith use some flowers?
---
Can you record it? I've never heard of being able to open the gate BEFORE generators are done. I remember people were worried about Killer's instantly opening the gate and activating NOED + Blood Warden and AFAIK you can't do that.
---
Rank 10. Still kills me. Lightweight? Guess who'd
---
s getting the ivory!
---
Eyesight is pretty important for a predator bro, sorry to break it to you.
---
Its BM and its commonly known to be. It's like someone cutting you off in traffic. Sure, maybe they didnt break a law necessarily, but  you'll immediately call them a dick and bien judgments on their character. They're allowed to play in a skeezy way, just like I'm allowed to think they're a trash player because of it
---
Is that a brandon rogers reference
---
\&gt;"110 ping"  
---
\&gt;"hitboxes"  
---
Way to contradict yourself. The problem here is very obviously latency.  
---
That is, of course, if that hit had been unfair, which it wasn't. Medium speed vaults mess you up.
---
It's alright, dumpster fires dont intimidate me
---
Which killer do you play with?
---
People don‚Äôt understand how much of a hinderance cleansing all 5 totems because there *might* be noed is
---
Flip it around then. Rather than having people flag rude players, let people reward people who played sportsmanlike. Each survivor can reward someone 1000 BP but the Killer can reward someone 3000 BP. Won‚Äôt stop the true assholes but hopefully it‚Äôll cut down on the herd mentality.
---
I think 10 would be too many survivors. Maybe 7 would be better.
---
That‚Äôs  scary for all ranks. It‚Äôs hell trying to stalk someone, or trying to see them after throwing an afterpiece tonic.
---
I want a whole series of Courage-inspired DBD memes now
---
Ehhhhhh..... I don‚Äôt know about that.
---
Maybe because its a p2p connection ? If it was to the server I would understand, but it isnt
---
I‚Äôd like double everything. 10 gens, two different maps, 8 survivors, 2 killers. I would like a rotten fields into Thompson house
---
I think this conversation is getting nowhere. People are downvoting people and words are starting to get called, especially by the OP. I'm glad we could at least have had a civil discussion, even though we disagree with one another. Happy killing/surviving, Graywolves
---
&gt;So my suggestion is to make skill checks more common based on repair speed and how many people are yanking on wires and all that fun crap.
---
But good survivors are already used to Ruin skillchecks. This would do nothing to them. 
---
The issue is that Ruin can be easily removed (I've seen people literally spawn next to the Ruin totem. Some "risk and reward" mechanic there, devs). And while the devs don't want to make gens take longer, the game's much too short to have multiple survivors on a gen with toolboxes at the same time. Meanwhile, the killer can only chase one person at a time.
---
Congratulations, you played yourself
---
Those weak ankles, I feel ya. Same problem here. üòÇ
---
Is it bad taste to use a flashlight?
---
You can really tell lol
---
Does this mean dream state reduces dead hards dash speed by 50%?
---
To me you cant compare camping to dcing. Camping cant be truly defined and sometimes is justifiable. If you mean face camping still its not comparable it affects the killer more than anyone. Dcing affects everyone especially rage quiting. Survivors lose a teammate and ruin their odds. Then the killer either has to farm or go easy because people will send hate mail if he doesnt.
---
It‚Äôs simple, make it short enough that you are difficult to see while crouching, so then you can see them. While running or standing, and harder to see while crouching, right now some killers are almost completely crippled in corn, and because even with expensive headphones I can‚Äôt hear the corn rustling for and can‚Äôt see it rustling because it‚Äôs too subtle
---
what are they gonna do? I honestly want to know what you think the devs can do to stop people from saying mean things in a video game.
---
So that was my general plan but, in order to do that I need bp to level in the first place xD
---
It do be like that though
---
If it were to happen it would be relatively fun, however, it could potentially be more buggy than a regular match. It would be an 8v2
---
Anything would probably bring fear back... for two days
---
Mercy isn't something that should be expected from your enemies. If it is not a surprise, were they really your enemy?
---
I feel really dumb for not getting it
---
You spelt Daddy Myers wrong
---
We really should tho  /s
---
No, Freddy's dream state uses a different Action Speed modifier that applies to a more limited set of actions (it doesn't affect unhooking someone or searching a chest, for instance, whereas Resilience and Spine Chill do - Thanatophobia also does not affect these actions, nor Dead Hard, for the same reason).
---
Funnily enough, decreasing Action Speed for Dead Hard would actually *increase* its dash distance, but there currently are no effects of any kind in the game that apply this kind of Action Speed debuff. There used to be a bug not too long ago that did allow to apply Self-Care's 50% speed debuff to general actions however, and you can see what that did to Dead Hard in [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HWzVe8PU1M&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=540).
---
Because Corrupt Intervention actually helps, HELPS survivors do not 3 gen themselves most of the time and it doesn't affect repair speed, it just force survivors to repair specific gens, which is a bad thing for killers most of the time.
---
Dont feel bad, you‚Äôre not the first
---
I'll be frank, the horror aspect of this game ceases to exist after twenty hours of gameplay.
---
Think that only applies to mobile Reddit, because it looks fine on PC/Browser
---
In a chase dh is a one time use.... you have to break free from a chase for like 60 seconds for it to recover. Chainsaw is like 2 second recovery. You cant compare the 2.
---
Try killer in red ranks without Ruin and you will see why.
---
Even as a both sides player, I do legitimately think while balance HAS improved, it's still very survivor sided IF they are an SWF who's goal is to win and are decent.
---
Yup! Good one I guess?
---
Ugh that‚Äôs another one I‚Äôm not the fondest of
---
Nightmare 5 *is* underrated you slime.
---
You never as killer can't see add-ons, they can see just items. If killers could see add-ons, they would avoid lobbys with Instant Heals.
---

---
Freddy's Dead and the remake are worse. 
---
Not really sure if, out of 9 movies, being in the bottom 3 is really that big a difference from the bottom 2 though.
---
Hag's pretty relaxing to me, you don't need to chase much, just put traps down, teleport to them and hit people.  
---
A good build for Hag would be:  
---
Ruin - because of her setup time.  
---
Haunted Grounds - makes snowballing with her really easy.  
---
Make Your Choice - great for getting quick downs after someone unhooking.  
---
BBQ &amp; Chili - double bloodpoints.
---
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
Shes fun!! Devourhope, make your choice, monitor and abuse, enduring, distressing, pop goes the weasel..  any of those combos..
---
As for addons anything that helps you teleport from a further distance and ones that let you see their aura when they set a trap off.  Rusty shackles is a good one also.
---
Legacy is the same rarity as ebony mories and bnps. (At least i think so)
---
Sometimes you gotta just drop a bad chase, they can sit there and T bag, what you should do at that point is focus gens. 
---
Also, maybe play survivor for a bit, grind out some blood points, and unlock better killer perks.
---
That‚Äôs what I did to unlocl Discordance with Legion.
---
Thats what i said about the recovery üôÑ
---
You dont have to break from the chase for it to recharge, you just need to stop running, you can stop running when you throw the pallets down, or even doing mindgames. The only thing you've given me about not being able to compare the two is the cooldown times, anything else?
---
Um ok dude!
---
It's just meant to show your frustration. Nobody cares about ranking up and if you DC on death hook, chances are you weren't gonna earn much BP anyway because it was a bad game for you.
---
Wow this is actually a logical, sensible idea.  Only concern would be how this would affect new players.
---
The walls were always the real problem. They're still just strong maps in general (abbitoir especially) but at least I can use my brain at a loop now.
---
Hahhahahhaaha Ruin OP HAHAHHAHAAHAHA.
---
Aye
---
I Don t need to learn anything what stranger says to me.

Esspecialy potato strangers Like you. Ty and have a good day

Ehhh I don‚Äôt know about all that
