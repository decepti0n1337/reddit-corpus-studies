The devs honestly could make a whole new cash cow if they made a god damn Mori shop where you can buy all sorts of different moris. Wonder why they don't just do it. 
---
---
---
Probably not, we already see the amount of skilled players de-ranking on purpose. I'd assume those people wouldn't care about rank and jump into un-ranked just to stomp the casuals.
---
I remember during a dev stream they said something about gore and keeping rating in some countries. I do find it a little disappointing but they made a decision for money. The gore from friday the 13th is probably the only area I think it has this game beat its got some pretty true to horror executions.

Id be fine with that i guess

Jesus Christ, I didn't need to see this.

I had a satisfying cocky moment today wish I had saved the recording. An adam was hard to catch he was good at looping. Finally caught up and hit him as he vaulted a window. So on the other side he teabagged and then turned and pointed at me... he was a bit to close to window and I hit him through the window he even did that half backflip down like when you hit them at a run. His friend then tried to flashlight save him when I picked him up but failed so he DC'd and then 5 seconds later so did his flashlight friend. Felt good.

---
And so? You can make assumptions on where the traps may be but every hag seems to be different on their choice of trap spots. It's highly frustrating without urban evasion and even if you have it your teammates may not. Earlier I was playing a match against one and I unhooked an Adam after urban evading past the trap. I kept urban evading but he didn't have it so he got up and triggered a trap by a nearby pallet and she downed me with make your choice. Also it seems all hags must come back to a hook right before a person dies on it and then tunnel the person if they are unhooked.
---
Genuine: Hag
---
Meme: Nea
---
the cat is possessing him
---
the cat is the true killer
---
Maybe because half of the oldest and non-licensed male Killers are african[-american]?
---
Don't disagree there but I'm talking about games where some don't even get hooked. I've had matches as killer where I get completely stomped by a good team and still pip.
---
Laughs in cat.
---
That's why it's unpopular opinion cause everyone seems to focus on their hatred towards legion

Wait till he is 2 and he still wants too...

ahh thats never happened to me, if i play a god swf and i hook maybe 2 of them i lose a rank.

Actually you do get the bloodpoints. But it is pretty common

Played a couple of games as Pig and chased down the last guy who happened to have Adrenaline and I happened to be using NOED. Before Adrenaline popped I was pretty close to them, another couple of steps and I could lunge, and pop goes Adrenaline and they're a million miles away. It still takes a while to catch them. There's no way you're instantly going to catch up with NOED like you seem to think for whatever reason. 
---
So, I'm just telling you that you're a fucking autist who doesn't know what they're talking because even with NOED the asshole using Adrenaline will still get away and still waste plenty of time while you try to catch them. 
---
I had the same thing happened to me and I did everything within my power to make sure I escaped with the sacred hook vessel
---
You do know that no one likes you,  right? 
---
same here, but on PS4
---
That would be op. 
---
I don't think they'll do it. That feature to me seems unnecessary, I never go into a lobby and speculate what everyone else is running. The unpredictable nature of some people is really fun to experience, like when the one guy with a ridiculous outfit and steam name runs No Mither. I doubt the devs would think of anything like this.

noed!! reported 
---
So that if they manage to hide away from the killer while down, they have time for their friends to rescue them. And, also, to prevent killers from deciding its faster to let them die on the ground than hooking them. (Though, I'll admit, since its pretty damn hard to save someone who's downed and being camped as opposed to hooked and being camped, that makes letting them bleed out technically faster)
---
Its just a game mechanic that they probably hadn't thought people would do, and have yet to do anything that really prevents it. 
---
That's probably the only reason why they probably don't want to encourage Mori use since it does tend to piss people off. At the same time there is a couple perks that let you Mori people anyway.

I've only been lucky to have a few games against Legion. And honestly, I've enjoyed the games I have had. As I seem to be in a loop of facing the same killers right now so meeting a Legion is always a welcome change for me.
---
If you're happy playing as Legion then keep playing as them. It's the reason I play as the good Doctor, I like shocking survivors and making them go mad.

emotions aren't dumb at all, I'm a very openly emotional person with everyone I care about.

it's just that it's literally just crouching in a video game. it means nothing unless you let it mean something; they are literally trying to get your attention so that you WILL tunnel them, likely because they have a good build for being chased or whatever.
---
it's not a crime, it's just very childish to let something so meaningless get to you
---
Man I definitely don’t wanna be that guy but if you get gen rushed when you’re playing a killer than can end chases in 15 seconds and traverse the map in like 20 then you’re just not a good nurse. 
---
I agree that some form of a secondary objective should be added, but if you’re playing either of the two killers with the greatest map pressure and getting gen rushed then that’s on you.
---

Is DS really that bad? I say this as someone who ONLY plays killer. Anytime someone uses it on me I end up getting them later.

That sounds like something a survivor in neon cosmetics would suggest.

Difference is I know I can run them around, I’m not a potato
---
cant judge that, without having played against you, so I just have to take your word on that
---
Same goes for you.
---
Why did you make Carter so thick
---
Yes. I’m so sick of killers dodging lobbies after I waited 15 mins and got excited I finally found a game. I don’t know these bitches, I’m playing solo! Stop dodging!!
---

I used a firecracker in front of the killer yesterday, got the blind points but they didnt drop the survivor they were carrying...

The current patch is the most bugged one I've seen so far.

Console bans work. My son got banned for farming because my 2 friends reported him

Here I am playing laurie on the cornfields, mr bingbong is killer and I'm obsession, he downs me after a while and juggles me, he just straight assumes I have decisive strike on! So I get loose and decide its go time and I loop him forever, every time he gets me down he juggles so I just get loose.
---
Finally the gens are done, exits are powered and he has noed, he downs me agian, but this time hes not juggling me anymore...so I did what I had to, and I hit him with my decisive strike and got outta there
---
He is just asking for some really strong after tonic 
---
I mean there really is no argument, pc had the pros of more mods, better performance, more uses outside of gaming and way more games but it’s also intimidating to people who’ve never built one before, can definitely have more issues come up than with console in my experience (although this is completely mitigated by knowing how to use google), and not as ideal for a couch/big tv setup IMO. Consoles have got the pros of their own exclusives, less optimization issues (in my experience), way less intimidating to set up, and also good built in voice chat/party systems for people who don’t wanna download discord or something. It’s major cons are way less indie games, more expensive games, paid online, worse performance and next to no mods available. It honestly just comes down to preference and the only reason I think people are arguing is because everytime console is mentioned anywhere on the internet someone has to chip in that PC is WAAAY BETTER and we’re just sick of it. Like yeah that’s not news man of course it is I don’t need to be reminded every week and honestly the pros aren’t gonna make me switch cuz I just don’t care enough. We just wanna live and let live and not have to constantly deal with the PCMR but I guess that’s what I get for being on the internet ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I used to dodge SWF but after a while I learned that I’d never get better unless I go up against harder teams.
---
absolutely 
---
Why even dodge swf anyway? It might be a bit harder than normal? Suck it up and play the game instead of making wait times longer for everyone. 
---
Don't play 
---
Philip put Herman down please
---
That’s why I don’t want to level anyone this event...too much BP wasted with those envelopes without me knowing if I get anything back after it ends
---
I know it's kind of a basic bitch M1 (R1, RB) build, but I use BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury. But since survivors are hiding more during this event I've replaced Spirit Fury with Whispers.
---
It's really not. Nurse can teleport, thus negating every survivor mechanic outside of pure stealth which you compensate for with perks like Nurse's Calling and Whispers. Once you get good with Nurse, there's basically nothing that survivors can do.
---
right, and sometimes its even easier, as they wont leave anyone dying on the hook 
---
Empathy’s unlimited range is nice but it’s only on injured survivors, bond shows healthy survivors too. 
---
Ik that but this question is based on opinion. So someone can say legion and yeah...also nurse is very slow and should be at least as fast as he survivors 
---
DS goes one of two ways in my games. Either the person DS's and we dont have to worry about the killer for another 60 to 100 seconds, or the potato goes down right again. 
---
yes, i think we all know that, all i said was to "not play on console" to fix the FPS issues, and it turned into a  console vs PC debate because "rapemyassholemyers" wanted it to be so.
---
Gf and I aren’t too good either, got discord?
---
Yes I do
---
Remember when the Pig was meant to move some of the toxicity blame from the killer to the other survivors for triggering your trap? That was a fun time.
---
Noob3 has been banned twice... Didn't stop him from being on this list. Although I love him
---
No -- if he had on a tighter / more defined zip up, then maybe...
---
Unnerving and ds if they still hit the skill check they can have the stun lol. 
---
I see they got tier 4 overcharge. It would've been a lot scarier if you didn't hit that skillcheck
---
The Dwight hiding in lockers all across the map with 4 gens left is gonna die before this joke does.
---
Yeah I main killer. I’m actually horrid at survivor. I don’t like it and I cause everyone to lose. I’ve survived once... ever. It was because the bill wouldn’t leave me die - he saved me and tanked 2 hits.
---

---
I thought it was just me - bloody party streamers are always welcome, but the halloween event items are just sitting there mocking me
---
because SWFs are fucking toxic as fuck and completely unblance the game and are not fun to play against at all. How about give us an option to opt out of being matched with them in the first place.
---
Thanks, Big NayNay Chungus. i don’t think they like to hear it (and all of them are like, mad, even though, I did gens, I got camped, I wasn’t even the one slugged, I’m just saying it seemed completely unwinnable and unfun probably for everyone) and I’m serious that it probably doesn’t even get them more points or *that much more* in the long run so this whole slug for 4k salt fest is probably pointless.
---
There is an audio cue at the beginning of the match. Once you recognize the sound, you won't miss it.
---
How'd you animate this?
---
Those are actually pretty interesting to check out. Especially Billy lol
---
Not that I’m aware of. Don’t know him that well, so could be.
---
But i mean what if Michael with tombstone went and had a randomized mori
---
Many killers can take advantage of the mist!
---
Trapper and hag can have better concealment on traps.
---
Hag, Freddy, legion are small and can use the most to be stealthy.
---
Pig and Myers do really well in the thick mist.
---
I have no idea what biased world you come from, but most Killers can use the mist to an advantage, so long as the killer is not a noob. 
---
Can we also stop saying your gonna get banned for doing somthing. You just sound dumb saying it cuz it's not gonna happen
---
in the original meme, the words closer to the viewer are slightly larger, I was trying to figure out how to give it depth and differentiation because I didn’t rememeber you can rotate in MSPaint. I was originally going to put “camp, tunnel, and slug” but I thought those were all aspects of “playing sweaty.” So that’s why. That choice, I found, also tended to be the more popular one I encountered that night.
---
O.o
---
It’s gay.
---
Lol even without it’s not really much of an issue tbh
---
Rank 20 to 13 was a varied mixture of swf and solo but since ive reached rank 8 it's been a majority of swf
---
Correct. If you need to gen rush 1 Gen engineer is the best option. If you're looking to touch as many gens as possible, comm is best. 
---
Sure, and who are we going to believe, some guy who has friends who claims to have been scammed? Or the people who were helped by it that we personally know?
---
And this is what makes you think you shouldn't like OhTofu as a person and entertainer?

And what lawsuits, exactly? Please provide proof of your claims.

---
Yea if you dodge SWF groups you are a pussy killer, not someone that kills cats or women’s sexual organs, but rather a killer that’s just a fucking pussy 
---
For Honor does this and some of the executions are glorious.  
---
I actually press "ready" immediately if I get 4 survivors at once. Do you know how hard is it to get survivors sometimes on console? I got no time to wait around. 
---
I still love Marth he's a good guy.
---
Having played recently and gotten constantly juggled by the killer... it took them longer to get me to a hook than it would have taken to just take the decisive strike and chase me again.

---
Haha I’ve heard nothing but bad things about it 😅
---
The Doctor just wants to cure her video game addiction
---
Yeah honestly if you have 250+ ms as killer you should not be able to play the game, it’s just unfair until dedicated servers drop 
---
thanks queen

Since when this is a hate thread on Tru3 ? We get it, you don’t know him and you felt the need to chime on something you have no clue about. You dont like it? Dont watch it, dont comment! There’s plenty of love for him! And then people say that his community is full of Reddit kids. I see a lot of other people’s communities here more vocal than Tru3s. That needs to change. Come watch him and then we talk ok? 
---
They probably changed it cos they became under fire???
---
Yeah, all i see here is gameplay. Theres nothing here to suggest bullying. Tbh the killer was more toxic/bullying than the squad. I really dont understand the logic. All the video suggest is that the survivors used perks/items in the game,the killer cried because they used said perks...still 4k'd,and that the creator is a god awful video editor...thats all ive gathered from your "source". I guess playing the game optimally is bullying....you guys are so soft its actually amazing. Its clear that the lot of you grew up very coddled and sheltered. 
---
Can you provide proof of that?
---
That's not what I'm reading, so I'm not sure where you're getting that from in the link. 
---
SWF with voice comms is almost game-breaking, although some people just take it as a harder difficulty :)
---
I could've sworn I heard something about climbing trees. I'll have to check. But I do remember hearing about a flying monster
---
Again, not what I'm reading from the complaints. Sounds more like you are trying to dig something out of nothing. I've literally gone and looked at the checkout page. It tells you the full fees.
---
I thought it was Feng when I saw it
---
Please, show me where. 
---
Your art style is adorable! You should put a signature on it, though.
---
I just used several streamer codes and cleared my cache each time. I compared them to the "regular" pricing and they're the exact same. I haven't seen one that insinuate a discount. I assume that if you use the creators code the creator gets a kickback for the referral. And a bit of googling to find out how their referrals work also seem to align with that. 
---
What an amateur. All you need to do is say "enhance" and your lackey will press enter two times
---
Also, there’s nothing wrong with camping - if used correctly it can change the course of a game, but it’s penalised by the game, and good survivors with make easy work of you if you use it a lot
---
Out in the open beneath the light
---
There is so many video made about it that it’s hard to find, I know that keemstar had a video showing he became a counseler on twitter but he tweets 40 times a day and it was 4 months ago
---
It's not toxic it is strategy, it's really annoying but I can't blame killers for doing it.
---
I honestly feel like it could go either way. Survivors might feel as if you are taking the game hostage since you are not allowing them to get the hatch. But on the other hand, hatch stand offs are the most annoying thing ever. Especially when both sides are being super stubborn. I guess it all depends on who you ask. 
---
It took me a minute of looking for it LMAO
---
If you want you can watch Shane Dawson’s jake pawl serious and the sponsership is in there

This happened to me too but only once. Is this happening more lately?

---
Omg I had no idea
---
“Dick sucking”
---
How does that equivalate to you RQing?
---
Just like you dick sucked that streamer for a whole week then RQd after everyone memed on you and you demanded an apology. 
---
Grow some thick skin Chump.
---
Sometimes cool killers spin with you for a sec.
---
Putting words in my mouth again, never said I watched a video to form my opinion, I read articles and me and my real life friend tried it
---
I’m a survivor that plays swf but my friends are all low ranks (like 20-15) which means I usually get killers lower levels than me and I try to stay out of their way and not purposely annoy them, but the amount of games we get killers dodging us is ridiculous, we could be searching for a solid hour before finding someone who will actually play the game, until they dc half way through the game
---
Dwight. Locker rooms lolololololololol
---
Same thing on PS4.
---
Blood warden is super situational, even more than Bloodwarden why do you want it nerfed
---
It wasn't supposed to be a hate thread, I just stated why I didn't like him, I get people like him and that's fine. And I did watch him, I watched most of his videos he had on YouTube, I may not like the guy but I acknowledge his skill and that other people do like him. I felt that people might have wanted to see where I was coming from just like you did to, that why I commented.

Don't skip perks in the bloodweb ever, because they'll just be cycled back into your bloodweb perk deck until you buy it.

You can blind killers before the animation is complete. Grants you points but the survivor won't be dropped

Do it if you want to, especially if you want to get the 4k. You're the killer, you make the rules (as long as you're not hacking/cheating/etc. etc.). Who cares what the survivors say. 
---
Now just need someone to actually make this a musical cover 
---
Too op pls nerfe
---
I think NOED would be fine if it were a temporary end game perk like Blood Warden.
---
The exposed effect of the totem should wear off in 60 seconds upon the first down, but the speed boost lasts as long as the totem is lit. That way it's not overly powerful on killers like Nurse and Hillbilly.
---
In its current state I feel it's a little too overkill, even for a top tier end game perk. Of course, doing totems counters the hex, but it's not always a good idea to look for totem spawns when they don't align with generators, i.e. on maps like the swamp.

You said he is arrogant: wrong. He is a confident person. 
---
You said he tunnels, also wrong. 
---
Watching his YouTube actually just shows you the best matches, the stream shows you a lot more of him. It also shows you the community he built.

Before you comment something like this, give the person a shot and remember they are also human beings ;)

Platform: PS4
---
- Type of Bug: Visual
---
&gt; Spirit’s left hand becomes bugged at times and is hidden from the screen/POV. Often occurs if a Survivor disconnects during the pick-up animation and resets when another Survivor is picked up and hooked. 
---
Type of Bug: Audio
---
&gt; Leatherface’s (and possibly Billy’s) chainsaw have stuttering audio while revving/charging when playing against them as Survivor. 
---
I dont. The idea of it being nerfed is JUST as stupid as nerfing adrenaline. 
---
What is this picture from?  A movie?
---
&gt; Even though it's horror-themed, most experienced players don't seem to be scared by the game at all.
---
Because people who play scared slow the game down considerably and often get themselves killed early or else barely contribute anything.  There's a reason why "immersed" players are regularly the butt of jokes, because at the end of the day if you want to actually get better at the game you can't play scared.  
---
I want to know how close clown would be if he has tier 3 enduring also while using the gas trick to slow down the DS person. Should be very very close. 
---
This made me laugh for a good minute 
---
It’s almost always a 3-4 man or two 2 mans.  Solo survivors are rare or new players. 
---
Yep!
---
David is only good for we're gonna farm forever, which isn't the best perk. I think after Claudette it's meg, than it doesn't really matter.
---
I lost it at the legion scene lol
---
Legion isn't worthy of getting face edits. They only get the letters lol.
---

ok
---
The game is being balanced with SWF in mind for quite a while now.
---
It's not perfect, but it has made some good progress.
---
New killer Stefano from EW2 confirmed
---
I DIDN'T MAKE IT CLEAR THAT'S MY BAD! THREE OF US WERE AT THE GATE, ONE OPENING IT, ME INJURED AND A THIRD JUST SITTING THERE DOING NOTHING LIKE A BASTARD! THEN THE HUNTRESS SHOWED UP AND WE HAD TO SCATTER AND THE GATE WASN'T OPEN YET!
---
I play almost exclusively swf and it's so annoying having to deal with multiple dodges between games. Like, I get there are legitimate reasons people hate swf but my group and I are literally fucking shit and I just want to play more losses XD
---
Awesome
---
I could do this all night hnghhhh
---
Swf are usually only 6 minutes or so. So at least the game is quick. 
---
I got called a "Toxic Huntress" a while back. I had just started Huntress after playing Hillbilly (during 2x BP) so I only had two perks on her, Enduring and Lullaby. Clearly the most toxic perks ever. 
---
What book is that on the bottom left ?? The one that looks like a manga. 
---
Actually he absolutely teabags at them and flashlight spams at them. He literally tries to get killers to DC simply "4 teh lulz". He's just as toxic as they come. 
---
Throw Afterpiece before you hold them over a staircase with a Enduring 3 and they’re basically gonna either be forced to get downed again or just miss it/waste it. 
---
YEET
---
I think the killer being able to talk to survivors would be freaking funny in some scenarios. But mostly be used for toxicity.
---
why is this getting down voted though
---
of course the manager is asserting dominance over the workers, typical capitalism
---
Had this happen with a Wraith.
---
was playing on my husband's account for event. started of 18 and got to rank 1 in 3 days with trash perks as killer. 
---
holy fukin shit I'm never going back to low ranks. such a dumpster that consists of either noobs who crouch around instead of progressing the game(like why do we waste time here, fam?? just do a damn gen I'm not even trying to kill you, little fly) or their higher ranked buddies who play more toxic than actual red ranks thinking they're facing baby killers and trying to get da sweet revenge not realising they're the reason for the failures. so many people who de-ranked with "high ranks too sweaty" but in reality they just hate losing. so they de-rank to play with worse killers/survivors instead of getting better. 
---
while playing on yellow to purple ranks I've had amount of salt, insults, toxicity in game and in chat more than I ever had in a year. but damn yesterday I hit rank 1 there, right, and was chilling with Totem Queen Rin after a match of full swf with 4 ds and 4 Adrenalines where two people managed to escape. so obviously I destroyed red rank team of 2x2 swf. cause it's a shitty build and I only use it for relaxation to not lose my shit after a bad game. but anyhow, they had the decency to say GG in chat.... I almost cried. the 3 days on my husband's account were nightmare till I got to red ranks. the death threats, the amount of people telling me to kill myself, the amount of dicks I'm supposed to suck or some imaginary lag that I apparently have just because I play well. cheesus it was disgusting. 
---
so for me - flip the picture D: I literally love my rank 1 buddies who stay there cause they ain't pussies and love a good game. &lt;3 xoxo 
---
Smh the Claudette didn’t bodyblock.
---
its window... its not a solid wall my guy
---
It's awesome! But I missed her glass shards :(
---
No problemo dude 
---
You shouldn’t HAVE to worry about the game’s ping skyrocketing like that.  If the game had automatic region detection then you can’t run into people from the Phillipines playing in NA North!  I don’t usually care about lag, but it practically teleported us into the traps and he was the ONLY person who wasn’t lagging backwards.
---
i know! after i’d finished it i panicked because i thought i’d missed them out! but no, they just weren’t there ):
---
Also DUUUUD was intended to mock OchiDO, I personally dislike him.  Just wanted to make it clear you read that in an obnoxious voice and whose voice is more obnoxious than OchiDO?
---
Unfortunately I was sitting on that screen at 4am. Sun rose at 6am, got in a lobby at 6:04am. So yes, wait til’ daylight indeed.

   L_______________&gt;He vaults it.——————I
---
Well fuck my flowchart failed
---
Take my money!
---
I tried telling this to someone just today and he argued that he KNEW they were SWF based on their perks. I guess 4 solo people can’t just run similar perks? 
---
So you're saying that they finally hired some better QA testers......
---
i imagine that she was a cute young lady in life!
---
Stupid strategy. All you are doing is giving incentive to the slugged survivor to dc. Why is a 4 kill so important? The point difference isnt that huge. 
---
Only time I slug for the 4k is if the survivors were toxic. Otherwise, I give hatch cause I hate standoffs and I also like not being a complete dick.
---
Not to mention new players would get yelled at a lot for taking bad perks
---
if you kill the game in task manager, you'll keep items
---
in what vid? id like to see some proof
---
Yes officers this post right here
---
Legion got a buff
---
*Umms intensify*
---
If only we had these graphics 
---
someone needs a nap
---
Wooooooosh. The jokes about how when you get a laggy killer it feels like their arms reach is ridiculous..
---
On Etsy, they're listed as "fan art," just like the masks, and other stuff people have been selling for a while. As far as I know, Behavior doesn't have any issue with all the stuff people are selling on Etsy, I assume as long it doesn't copy/directly interfere with the stuff they're selling? 
---
You never said it, but it is toxic.
---
Dodging a swf group is for fragile minded bitches that should go play a different game if they can't handle it. Honestly, I find it humorous that someone is queuing up to play a violent killer in a video game, but is afraid of 4 friends. I guess in all of these horror movies we love, the true way to defeat a killer is to show up as a 4 man group of friends. Lmfao.
---
As a killer, I only dodge for multiple game/vac bans. Swf is one thing, a record of cheating is another. 
---
Very bold of you to post this with a p3 legion
---
Chocolate DBD perks. 
---
I like it. Now that I think about it, it wouldn't be too hard to make one of these into a mold to make candies... 
---
I play solo all the time, yet I load in with all 3 players. I play better solo than I do when I play with my husband. 
---
🎶**Can i get an Amen in here?**🎶
---
I think in the dream transition, the survivor should be blinded for a couple seconds and stop all progression that way Freddy can mindgame them.
---
Underappreciated post.
---
The hate fuels me
---
What was the killers name?
---
You cannot freely add simple things like new animations if your game is spaghetti-coded. Add/fix one thing, 2 more will break.
---
Nah. 
---
Like I mentioned above, I chose most of the builds for these pictures from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ad0tcg/looking_for_meta_build_lists_for_project/) I made a while back.
---
The "toxic" joke is just because DS is in one, while NOED is in the other.
---
Dead by Daylight Devs need to hire you. Stat!
---
Great job by the way. Wish DBD looked this good.
---
Has anyone done a MKX styled leatherface mori based off of leatherface's brutality where he is smashing the enemys skull repeatively for a long time?
---
You looking at my gut?
---
Her fucking up your FOV is pretty annoying. 
---
Because if they were good they wouldn't have got caught. 
---
Players should join the lobby all at once always in my opinion.
---
SWF isn't toxic, that's such a ridiculous idea.
---
Your bad games aren't because of SWF, and I'd actually bet money the majority of your games you THINK are SWF aren't at all.
---
I've heard the most crazy reasons a group was "clearly SWF and toxic" which are all things I see in literally any random match.
---
Take my keychains!

---
&gt;I like it. Now that I think about it, it wouldn't be too hard to make one of these into a mold to make candles...
---
FTFY
---
It might be harder, it might be easier.
---
You know, like any game against anyone...
---
Maybe try to risk it when the game just started and killer gone and no one has saved after the struggle stage. But it’s not my place to tell others what to do 
---
Indeed, it's so inconsistent.
---
Earlier today I got 9k points and pipped. What? That's hardly anything.
---
In another game, I earned 19k points (did 2 gens, cleansed at least 3 totems, though no unhooks so maybe that's why), and didn't pip.
---
This game's levelling system forces you to do a bit of everything, even if there's no opportunity. Say you get tunnelled the entire game, then you can't get objective points. Or your team is actually intelligent and no one gets hooked, then you can't get altruistic points. Why should we be punished for actually managing to evade the killer? Straight up retarded.
---
It's a semi decent move to secure a 4k. Survivors don't like it when you do that for obvious reasons. Usually neon hair Nea players camping the hatch while their friend gets downed.
---
Albert Einstein
---
PC
---
Gameplag - if you fail a skill check and instant heal it negates the instant heal
---
They get the hatch if they can get to it. Playing the game isn't being ”a complete dick".
---
It's an underlying mentality problem, not a problem with SWF.
---
I'd bet my life savings the majority of games killers do poorly and complain about SWF weren't even SWF at all.
---
It's not designed to make the gameplay fun in the slightest. It's designed to force you into doing every activity in every game, even when that makes no sense.
---
What happens if survivors were smart and never got hooked? Oh we'll depip you for that. Just the most stupid approach ever. If anything, an entire team never getting hooked should be rewarded.
---
Candies or candles? 
---
One melts in your mouth, and one SITS UNDER A PILE OF BONES AS A SACRED TOTEM TO THE ENTITY!

Yeah SWF just rise to rank 1 in a day and win every game. Cause it's game breaking.. lol.
---
LMAO LIT FAM LEGION = DC D STRIKE AEINT TOXIC DUMB CAMPER GG EZ     👌😂👍

---
/s
---
I did that to someone once. He juggled me to the hook, and ALMOST got it, but there was 5% left on the wiggle meter by the final drop so I just wiggled free and ran for the open exit. Afterwards he actually gave me props for thinking of that.
---
Stop crying about it. I've had bad games in a row just like how you describe. Once again, you get shitty team mates sometimes, and good team mates others.
---
Solo players can't go for the save, can't pay attention to where pallets were used, can't block for people, can't work on a gen together, etc.
---
If the killer does poorly, that's some SWF shit right there.
---
I can do what i want and will. Y’all have dug your own grave. 
---
Because they think they're upsetting the killer. But they're actually helping them, lol.
---
Tell that man to get more wrist support, holy fuck. I got carpal tunnel just lookin at this image
---
Hope you still pipped. The only time I hate DC is when they do it right at the start. They get found and downed in 10 seconds, then ragequit. That has the potential to fuck you up by robbing you of potential chase/hook points.
---
Can confirm this happens on pc aswell
---
Really really annoying
---
I wish you worked for bvhr, this is amazing and we should have it :(
---
With each post you make, I always have to ask myself wtf you think is wrong with communists..
---
Ruin, brutal, sloppy and tinkerer. Also, I have started putting traps at pallets they've thrown. Works more than you'd think.
---
They don't block if they dont fast vault afaik. 
---
I played with a 3 man swf as a survivor earlier. I was found first and chased for about a solid 5-6 minutes and was wondering why no gens were done. Anyways I get hooked and I see them all in the basement playing in the lockers. Open close open close open close. Killer goes down there and they all swap lockers as he opens each one and takes them out for hooks.
---
Super annoying. Then I crashed with an error that popped up for the first time ever so I didn't even get to be a whiner after the match, lol. 
---
Rank 3 as well, stupid jerks
---
Actually believe it or not I play on Xbox and I get a fair amount of salt. It's a little more rare than what I've heard about on PC but it does exist.
---
Here will be an influx of “ mori me daddy” survivor names. 
---
So what. No one stop anyone else from using them. Its fair.
---
The day that becomes a perk is the day I stop playing killer. 
---
skskssksksksks
---
"ya'll have dug your own grave"
---
lmao
---
Hey man thanks I really appreciate and I got some more coming soon
---
Rank 1 babeeeee!

Lmaoooo almost got me
---
LMFAO
---
Hahaha you had me rolling!!!! Best commentary ever!
---
[removed]
---
Ohgodohno
---
If the hag is coming for you then you're already running if you are crouching and see her coming all you can do is stay hidden and hope she doesn't find  you. If she does then yeah no getting away from that. What I'm getting at is if the hooked survivor and myself both know she currently chasing someone then as I unhook them they have time to crouch away. This is the only time where I'm like dude Hags busy crouch. Camping hags tho is something else entirely.  Most hags I play don't camp because the traps camp for you. Still she is very obnoxious.
---
When you’re 80 feet away from the window &amp; they still hit you 😁
---
Yeah there’s literally no way to not double pip as legion so I’m not surprised.
---
I don’t even care if doing this directly causes me to die. I would rather lose than save someone now. I’m getting out on my own or not. 
---
Lol thanks glad I can make you laugh
---
Yeah it's called "dedicated servers"  
---
Typically it's the shitty hags that have the potential to bring out her gameplay flaws. Usually they drop chases to secure a recently unhooked survivor. 
---
Oh god forbid anyone gets hooked in the basement, she spends half the time your hooked just laying traps around the stairs.
---
That would be an epic perk 
---
Inexplicable Desync has entered the chat.
---
Both phrasing’s can work.
---
I hope not. This was the 1st time it happened to me. 
---
Dude basement hags scare me. One at the door and the window. Top, middle, and bottom of stairs traps. God forbid indeed.
---
That’s still grammatically correct
---
in my last game i unhooked 2 and healed 2. Did 0 gens and got 3 hooked by the killer. I pipped. Im 90% sure its altruism over all
---
Yeah I’ve had plenty of games where I would swear they were swf, really good survivors and co ordinated and after asking them they were all randoms.
---
Does that 6 minutes also include the time spent after the game getting berated for being trash?
---
Nothing, its just a joke to describe something as gay on the internet 
---
I started may 2017! Weird
---
Your old age WILL catch up to YOU AS YOU REALIZE WINNUNG ISN'T THAT IMPORTANT JUST PLAYING THE GAME FOR FUN IS! Unless winning IS fun then ignore that last statement
---
No
---
Have you even played the game since pickup was changed? People still get saves all the time, also no need to be salty about it
---
When did Freddy become a survivor?
---
Yes, thanks. I will
---
wouldn't matter, they'd just derank so they could match with their friends. Honestly they need to remove SWF, add an option for people to opt out of being matched with or vs SWFs or just create a real rank mode that is solo queue only and a "casual" mode that allowed SWFs 
---
u/title2imagebot
---
DLCs usually don't go on sale unless it's Leatherface's DLC.
---
Of course Scott is biased.I dont understand what you want him to do?Insult her as well?She is his girlfriend after all.We all would be biased.I dont agree with him either about Jen but I understand why he defends her.
---
Haven't heard or seen one like that, there is a speed hack, I think its speedbot, which can allow the characters go way faster. I haven't heard of a teleportation hack though.
---
Then people would just derank (like they can and do already do...) to match up with their friends. This would make it even harder for higher rank people to find fast matches. The devs really just need to make ranked mode solo queue only and make a casual/KYF hybrid free-for-all with SWF and every single perk unlocked and maxed out on each side like there is in KYF.
---
We must be playing completely different games then lmao
---
I honestly dont see how hitting survivors through a window somehow constitutes as a bug? you're still in range, a window does not have a magical force field on it. you can still hit people through it.
---
So you're crying and bitching on reddit about teammates being bad whilst also boasting about now becoming a bad teammate? 
---
fog doesnt even benefit myers tbh, because the fog only covers the ground for some reason, he just pops out of the top of it
---
Welcome to dbd console. 
---
You get salty for winning and you get salt for losing.
---
The only hint we have gotten is that they slowed down fred's movement speed when using his power for a patch by mistake and said that change was related to the rework. We don't know if this change was even kept in his rework or not. 
---
I wish we had not just different Mori animations but multiple ones for each killer. Like cutting off body parts and throwing them to the crows. 
---
Crow Mori where all the crows converge on the survivor and eat them. 
---
Even generic bonus mori where people get their necks stepped on or get beheaded. 
---
Thank you!
---
but who would do that?
---
what? am I wrong, also freddy is a good tunneller because he can apply pressure to survivors without chasing them, also for that same reason makes him a good ignorer, if you're running save the best for last you can just ignore your obsession if you find them.
---
whats your point
---
Hello !
---
Don't worry about this, survivors get salty every times. It's the same thing on PC version. You 4k "omg fkin noob babykiller facecamp / tunnel / cheat" even if you have done nothing of this and if you can't hook someone they often wait you at the gate , tbagging /flash lighting or spamming 360 and insult in the end lobby chat "omg u so bad haha" "babykiller" etc...
---
So just play and chill, they are salty, let them you are the spooky killer after all :).
---
Have a good day and have fun !
---
you act like being immersed in the horror video game in the intended manner is somehow exclusive to playing well, when thats wrong
---
I used maya to setup a rig and animate then I exported it to Unreal 4 and setup the materials and lighting. Unreal 4 has a great tool called sequencer in which you can add layers pretty much everything and keyframe them and so on.

I thought you were just being nice a aware but turns out you just want to fuck me over with make your choice. This is why I have trust issues.

Have you done the check game file integrity on steam?
---
People say over time heals _deep wounds_.
---
I heard enough from you last night to last me a life time.
---
Honestly if I get killed in a badass (or funny) way, I'm down. Just look at F13th, every Jason variant has different executions I believe. I'm not up to speed on that game anymore, but the different executions are an awesome feature. I'm totally fine being mori'd by any killer except the OGs simply because their animations are like burnt toast. Not impressive.
---
On a side note, the moris should have more gore. Hag has no issue ripping out and feasting on their guts, so getting chainsaws in half should split the survivor in half properly and spill out their brains etc. &lt;3
---
I was quoting someone from the video but okay.
---
A mori can actually fuck over the killer, especially if they have BBQ. When hooking a survivor, they can traverse toward the other survivors, gens, or gates and look around. During a mori, their camera is locked and they are stationary, and also deny themselves BBQ. I've accidentally mori'd a survivor when the gates were powered. Needless to say while I was stuck in an animation, both gates opened and I got one kill. 
---
More like a very strong handsome man.
---
Legion isn't even worth _playing against_ so its what they deserve. 
---
Thanks :3
---
You can scroll through older ones I've made.  
---
Or when it's a guy, jam their crotch into the trap while they scream in agony. That'll teach Ace to look so smug while being killed. Even though he would still smile... I guess that doesn't help
---
You went full Mortal Kombat with that one. 
---
I fucking love ohm....YEEEES YEEEEES
---
Same. 400 ping? Fuck yeah I'm slapping that ready button. Better that than match at all. And as a survivor I'll take any ping as long as it gets me into a match. 800? You bet I'm readying up.
---
I am the QUEEN of the universe, the waves part and engulf me, and the water is WARM
---
I don't like when it happens to me as survivor, but I get it. I don't do it as killer myself, unless I already know exactly where the other survivor is. Otherwise, I  just hook and start searching again. I like 4ks but I know survivors also love finding the hatch and escaping as the sole survivor.
---
you have to be a next level loser to DC against a Doctor 
---
True 
---
Can you make one for Legion and Freddy? Thanks
---
Yeah dude went totally berserk there
---
Very poetic.
---
I love pig cause shes cute
---
Interesting. It wasn't a lag switch since no one else was effected. Wtf is this? 🤔
---
This dude knows what's up.
---
In reality he wanted to stop playing but couldn't move because of the kitty! :P
---
Suit Myers would get to kill me every match, goddamn.
---
Where is the Nsfw tag?/s
---
Wrong choice of words you get the point.
---
Legion is the closest thing to a Nurse, but he's still not as mobile and requires multiple hits to down. Really, no other killer in DBD even comes close to what a well-played Nurse can do.
---
Switch out adrenaline with DH and sounds about right
---
Honestly that’s one of the main things that keeps me from playing trapper more. Not being able to use his power without going out of my way to pick up or reset it is so inconvenient and wastes a lot of, in my opinion, the first minute of the game where I’m just quickly trying to set up a few traps. Those few minutes where survivors are free to genrush are so crucial it feels so tedious to set a trap and then have to find another trap to pick up and set.
---
I really enjoy the trappers gameplay of forcing a survivor into a trap you’ve set, but the feeling that I’m playing a guy that walks fast who can swing a machete instead of a Most Dangerous Game inspired killer who meticulously thinks ahead of his prey and herds them into certain doom is disheartening due to how inconvenient traps are.
---
He’s been out so long and he’s always been this way though, so I doubt it’ll change. I will admit I like being able to instantly tell I’m going against a trapper as a survivor by seeing his loose traps laying around, but on the killer side I know that can be annoying af because instantly survivors can be alerted of what the killer is and how to approach going against them. 
---
Has happened to me loads of times to me in January, and not just in this map. With green ping as well.

...Now I wanna do one for every killer I have played. 
---
then maybe give the killer at least the chance to walk away?
---
Justa little tap
---
Im sorry Young Survivors pardon me a moment to ask you, 
---
What is this "Yeet" thing you seem to be so excited about?
---
Reminds me of my own youth when I got my first Walkman.
---
Don't see the point in prestige now with all the cosmetics about. (unless your licence killers) But mine was hag p3 now and doctor p3. 
---
Yeah, it's a good idea to farm for a few hundred thousand BP first before Prestiging a killer
---
You literally dont read anything do you
---
Ok good to know. 
---
I get what you mean. Apparently you get rarer add-ons/Offerings easier on the BloodWeb the more you Prestige, but I don't care either way :/
---
I'm getting close to Prestige Hag, Doctor and Pig
---
Most OP hex because no one would ever cleanse it.
---
I need more of these. 
---
I'll understand if you're doing something like scratched mirror myers and you load into a corn map because the game chose the survivor offering over yours. That's just 100% unfun to play out.
---
I got Ace free recently. My friend bought me most of the DLCs for Christmas and was like "Who do you have already" "I got Hag and you bought me Dr before" and he's like "ok, not gonna buy you Ace, he sucks anyway"
---
I thought maybe he did buy on accident but I checked my gift history or w/e and the Hag DLC didn't show up and I know I wouldn't have bought Ace soooo
---
i got a free guy :sunglasses:
---
Would help with the killer's with dog shit mori's. \*ahem\* Wraith, Trapper, Billy
---
Wait, how does a killer juggle you? Is it when he drops you then picks you up again? How would that help them counter DS, wouldn't it just add less time for the survivor to have to wiggle free? 
---
I'm sorry for all the questions, I don't have DS so I don't know how it fully works.
---
Not really. Every patch makes it more killer sided and it's a good thing. Balance is being handled with swf in mind. Also, I wish I was still a lad. Havent heard "up in the night" in about 20 years.
---
Oink.  (Trapper was the first I got to level 50, but since he got a cool Hallowed Blight mask while licensed characters get fucked I don’t plan on upgrading any non-licensed characters)
---
I feel like I'm the only one who enjoys being mori'd lol breaks up the monotony of being hooked
---
He's full of shit if he claims this is happening regularly at rank 1. Rank 1 survivors are too cocky to allow that.
---
This ain’t it chief 
---
It does for killers 
---
Are you the one who made the hook and doc valentine cards?
---
Phillip
---
I despise the hag I was pushing her to the side on purpose xD
---
Borrowed time should be dead hard
---
I have never related to a post so hard
---
Yup. 
---
If they’re near a hook, they can juggle so the skillcheck for DS can’t trigger. Wouldn’t work too well if they’re far from a hook as the survivor could still hit the DS or could wiggle free. 
---
I had chill games at rank 1 with Ruin BBQ Discordance and M&amp;A
---
They are swf
---
How was that a good chase? You wasted 3 pallets and went down anyways in like 50 seconds.
---
This is the bane of my poor console existence 
---
I remember the best jumpscare I ever delivered to someone. As the huntress, I randomly threw hatchets up in the air from time to time. The match was about to be over, so I decided to throw all 5 in random directions and suddenly I got a hit. I didn't kill them or anything, but it sure scared the crap out of them, they told me as much in post game chat
---
Not gonna lia dude if you want a build that will just help you survive? Iron will (jake) urban evasion (nea) sprint burst it dead hard (meg and David) self care( invisidette) ps. This is assuming you have no dlc 
---
And that tells us a lot about the ranking system ;) People with 157 hours can get rank 1 :,)
---
...how? 
---
Same thing happened to me, luckily my team carried me through it while I ran around doing nothing
---
Dead by Delight
---
Oh it could be that - I thought the killer was just doing it to confuse me a bit so I missed any potential skillchecks.
---
Rank is only playtime in this game. There‘s no fundamental difference between a rank 8 and a rank 1 other than the fact the r1 played a few more hrs since rank reset. 
---
Goda this sub has really gone to shit. There is only three types of post now.
---
1. REEEEEE Killer Camping REEEEEE
---
2. REEEEEE Survivor toxic REEEEEE
---
3. REEEEEE BHVR/DBD sucks REEEEEE
---
Just stop it, all your Meme are bad and are fundamentalally the same. This is no discussion or anything, this is just jerking each other and spraying hot karma-sauce down your throats. 
---
If you don’t like the sub then leave
---
She doesn't sprint, she urban evades everywhere. 
---
I've had this a few times and not got the points for it. 
---
I'm not up on my young people lingo, but isn't yeeting about performing an action and then exclaiming said "yeet"? Sort of like a good luck phrase? 
---
I agree, with respect to the fact that there are learned skills involved. Still, my feeling is that there should at least be a ten rank differential limit.
---
Or the mods here could actually fucking do something instead of twiddling there thumbs in each others asses.
---
If there even are any left.
---
I’m inclined to agree, but that depends entirely too much on the mates you’re matched with, excluding a 4player swf 
---
There are actually a pretty big amount of mods and this sub is in a pretty good place IMO
---
Also I actually put effort into my memes so fuck off
---
This is a great comment about dead by daylight!
---
It's a real r/comedycemetary. It's so beautiful, I could cry.
---
Someone needs to calculate if you worked minimum wage for the cosmetics, or if they are cheaper when just bought with money 
---
How dare you insult daddy meyers this way
---
So it's the thumb and ass thing, got ya.
---
If that is you putting in effort I assume you the bus that brought you to school was of the short variety. 
---
I would expect her to be Ultra-rare though.
---
Have you ever made a meme with little to no photoshop experience on mobile? No didn’t fucking think so cunt
---
Blame big influencers like Ochido, Noob3, and Monto for popularising toxic behaviour and making it seem cool. 
---
Oh I’ve had this happen one match this week. Got me good
---
They are definitely giggling together. Troll squad you know
---
Just realizing a music based Killer (f. e. disco fever theme) would be pretty cool tbh
---
You’re making it seem as though console is completely unplayable. It’s not. In fact it’s very rare for me to come across a bug, I haven’t come across one in about a week. 
---
Also the hitboxes are fine.  
---
While tbagging, pointing, and 360ing may be annoying, I don’t find them toxic. So i cant really put them at fault. 
---
Exactly. You need to use totally different perks against most of the god swfs. Enduring, overwhelming presence, Franklin's demise and ruin. This will be my setup. I don't want to get fucked by decsive strikes. 
---
Just for anyone who doesn't actually know, it lessens the distance between hooks
---
No teabagging is definitely toxic. It’s a straight up immature thing to do. 
---
Of course if you choose to tunnel the person getting unhooked rather than the unhooker, that's tunneling.
---
Phillip Ojorno. I think...
---
i would love to see a 2 killer 8 survivors game mode
---
Happy cake day
---
It doesn’t actually ruin someone’s game tho. Its more of a psychological thing to make you play worse, which would be on you on how play the rest of the game. I’m talking about the toxicity to where you actually have no physical say in whats going on in your game bcuz someone decided to take your game hostage. 
---
Git gud.
---
Better player won.

XD
---
They have no other purpose than to annoy or irritate, that is what toxic is (not 360ing, obviously, there is a gamplay purpose there.)
---
Pisses me off that people unironically use their rank 1 to strenghten their arguments, this sub included. *I think that this build is good rank 1 btw*
---
Okay now you’re kinda just confusing me so I’m just gonna answer your title question. It’s not that hard to figure out. A lot of players only play one side, creating a divide in the community. People who play only or mostly survivor won’t really understand the struggles of a killer and vise versa. 
---
So if a killer gets a 4K or if he camps because he obviously sees survivors nearby, they don’t get it because they don’t play killer and they get mad. Some exceptions obviously, some people who don’t play killer but so scroll Reddit and read some killers posts understand kind of what it’s like.
---
Or again vise versa. Killers get genrushed and they start thinking survivors have it easy, or they get hit with DS every other match and they think “oh what an overpowered perk” 
---
And, all this combined becomes a barrel of toxic waste. There are some golden moments though. 
---
\&gt; Self Care + Adrenaline
---
I will never understand this
---
Why cant they just make it a feature to turn off post game chat? 
---
Yes I have, every time that I do it, I get that everything is validated alright. Thanks for your reply.
---
Did they all do the dc wave after lol
---
According to my trophy list it took me just over a month to go from 100 to 500. I was alternating a little bit between survivor and killer during that time and was a little busy so if I played nothing but killer I probably could of got it faster.
---
I imagine if you play nothing but killer or very little survivor you could probably get it in a month or less.
---
True, but i want the cosmetics. 
---
He fixed it like half an hour later 
---
depending on your play time you can get 1 coin a day or even 2 if you play all day and if games are coming fast. or even killer gets you a lot of points now
---
Hex:Yeetus deletus Legion
---
No ochido?
---
25 total hours as killer I was rank 1 killer, 50 hours as survivor I was rank 1 survivor. All you have to do is do one gen, unhook one person and you basically always pip if you do something else and fuck around a bit
---
Its rare for that to happen with me. 
---
When I was playing low rank survivor the killer would get looped by the obsession for 2-3 gens, tske a DS, then get looped for the remaining gens.
---
At high rank the killers tend to either not bother with the obsession or they leave them slugged if they can't juggle them.
---
Either way when it goes off it normally helps out a lot more than you would expect. You can take gens away from the killer you wouldn't have gotten without someone using DS.
---
They all went half price around Halloween. I haven't seen a sale at any other time so probably won't again for a while now 
---
Id rather they make the event cosmetics require you to play the event but thats just me. I get why they are now purchasable
---
I get a pause/judder when bloodlust activates, its really frustrating as it can make me lose a survivor :\  Happens other times too but mostly with bloodlust.
---
I think spirit is cool but I hate playing her
---
Why not just bring them back in the next seasonal event related to their style? It doesn't mean they couldn't come out with new skins for that event, as well as having the old ones as well.
---
lol thats what I’ve been saying...
---
at least nurse takes skill tbh, yeah they both ignore core game mechanics for suvivors but legion doesn't really take skill
---
She's the only killer I can all but guarantee getting at least a 3k. A solid pair of headphones and some half decent perks and she's all but unstoppable. 
---
Looks like the usual dead by daylight. Whats that you’re asking again?
---
The most effective build is going to be: Dying Light and Black Box Freddy 100%, the rest of the perks are going to be dependent upon how you want to play after you kill the obsession. 
---
I've never read anything so true. Having to play through rank 10-13 after rank reset honestly haunts my dreams
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
I've done the exact same thing with prayer beads and an amulet. I'll get bullied on my huntress or whoever I was playing and just nuke some unsuspecting survivors for the sins of their forebears. 
---
:3
---
Would be fun to have new mechanics. Like being chased by the killer as you both climb up then the killer catches you and pulls you to instant downed state.
---
You don't use SC if you are good? Interesting
---
Its not that evdryone hates losing, its that losing as killer means having to run to the exit gate to watch 2 people tbagging non-stoo, hit one, wipe your weapon, hit them again to force them out, turn to the next guy who's still tbagging, hit him twice, run all the way across the map because the next guy wants you to watch him tbagging, hit him twice to force him out, now you got to wait 10 minutes because one guy decides he wants the hatch instead and he expects you to just sit and chill while he runs around looking for it.
---
Then you get the post game chat where you're told to kill yourself and die of cancer.
---
That's why killers feel so much pressure to win.

Perks will always spawn in the bloodweb if you do not have all available perks unlocked on the current character. If you want a specific perk, the best way to get it is to get the other perks to lvl 3, eliminating the possibility that they will spawn again, and therefore increasing the likelihood that lithe will spawn in the web. 
---
Downvoted for the truth.
---
Reddit is such a survivor main salt mine.
---
Ochido is gone lmaooooooo
---
Nonce
---
Mmmm, candles
---
Sloppy B? is that not allowed now lol?
---
Cause I don’t have much experience? And on the auto haven map most of the loops have high walls so I can’t do shit. 
---
If you're the obsession you get a skill check like exactly 1 or 2 seconds into being carried where you get a prompt to use DS. You can't wiggle during this time or anything, so killers know you have it if you aren't wiggling on their shoulder.
---
If you miss the skillcheck on purpose (not even attempting to use your skillcheck button) you "save" the DS. Often people who miss DS will continue to not wiggle so they psych the killer out when they pick them up again.
---
If you're NOT the obsession but are using DS, it's a little different. You have to wiggle to a certain % before the prompt appears (Whereas with obsession it's instant)
---
If the killer drops you and picks you back up, it automatically fills that struggle meter by like... 20-25%. I don't remember exactly how much but it's usually enough to get that DS very quickly without having to be super far from a hook.
---
When survivors don't have obsession but are running DS, people often call it "hidden DS" or something like that, because it's not possible to know they have the perk equipped until they use it on your ass.
---
OP doesn't make any sense btw, because the killer can see who the obsession is at all times anyway with the player icons. The survivor who just got downed and has the tendrils? They most likely have instant DS. No tendrils? Most likely no DS.
---
Nice excuse. 
---
Show me how you play without it 
---
Me?

Have you made all the perks? Ide love to get my 4 standard perks 😍

Me: On a hook struggling.

My controller: I have decided that I want to die.
---
Apply cold water to Burned area. 
---
No, you can use any perks and still be good.
---
But you probably shouldn't act like you're the NUMERO UNO SURVIVOR NA while saying "I'm rank 1 lmao" to anything that any flaws that any other player points out about your whining after flaming the killer after dying with an instaheal and Adrenaline and performing significantly worse than the rest of your team while accusing Enduring of being a "crutch" perk. Not NOED, not BBQ, but God forbid some add-onless Freddy use Enduring (gasp) while you use Self-Care, Adrenaline, and Decisive Strike.

I'm hoping they got it confused with Unrelenting...

Why? 
---
Dang the nurse is S  P  E  E  D  Y
---
Idk. They aren't my rules
---
You check the profile a few days later.  Interesting that I'm getting downvoted, which ironically proves my point. Snowflakes shouldn't play killer.
---
I don’t care about him as well but he’s not gone. Gone from streaming ya but he will prob still be able to make videos if he edit names out so the devs won’t know who it is
---
Not that I know of 
---
Happy to play what servers u on 
---
Love noob and Demi ❤️
---
I don't mean instaheals mid chase, I mean like using a syringe on a freshly downed survivor
---
There are choice moments to use them and both of these have often extended a game by like 10 minutes or so with very different results (rather than a flat out delay)
---
Not toxic maybe, but clearly unfair.
---
Only survivors, right?
---
The op
---
I would recommend playing Freddie, survivors will have a hard time hiding from you and once you pull them into sleep they’re highlighted in white. Plus, the dreamworld that Freddy stays in is just brighter than the normal game
---
I went into a game, burnt a red envelope as an offering for an extra lantern. Someone else burnt one too. So there should be 4 lanterns up for grabs, enough for everyone.
---
Grab a lantern at the start of the game, turn to my left and saw 2 other players running towards it. "Oh they must have wanted that, oh well there are still 3 more to grab".
---
Nope apparantly I just did something unforgiveable for having the nerve to grab a lantern. These two from this point onwards just ran around sandbagging me, blowing up the gen I was on and slamming pallets to get the killerd attention.
---
Its really pathetic. I dont get a lantern every game but I dont really care because there are still 20 points up for grabs in the generators.
---
I feel this event has destroyed my team spirit. I've taken off we'll make it and now im running leader instead, so that I get healed faster and I couldn't care less about anyone else. 
---
Because they know that a run to another place will get them killed, or they know that they're away from a hook or their teammates to protect them a little longer. 
---
To waste the Killers time? 
---
But if you don‘t respect the pallet they have to leave the loop pretty soon so it shouldn‘t be a big problem. 
---
Moonwalking also works wonders sometimes :)
---
[Decided I'd make it](https://i.imgur.com/vjRmwBR.jpg)
---
i always assume the killer has bbq but thats because im in red ranks and 99% do. what rank are you?
---
Thanks for the tip, does moonwalking confuse as to where I'm gonna go?
---
or he misses and dc's \ kills himself on the hook
---
Not getting these arbitrary cosmetics must have a serious impact on your day to day life.
---
That comparison would make sense if I was asking why they were completing gens, not if they loop
---
And killers do this? And they hit you on hook? 
---
People are just toxic.  Chances are if you are getting tbagged so much you probably suck mad dick at the game and you’re also probably toxic as hell too. If you act like a dick people respond the same way. 
---
A lot of times survivors are trying to be nice and give you free hits too 
---
No one owes you a fun chase.
---
Survivors will moan and howl about camping tho. No one owns them a fun game right ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I know that, but as I put on the flair, this is just me being salty
---
I'm not even OP??
---
Big Brain
---
It was very :)
---
What exactly did you do?
---
Does noed still have the one hit down? there is noting on the description anymore, i thought they remove, it's just say 4% speed and exposed effect. 
---
Because if you run in a straight line you die instantly?
---
spoiler: prestiged characters gonna get reset and you will also loose teachable perks
---
It was the glitch with the bloodweb where you could prestige your characters instantly without spending any bloodpoints. Purely cosmetic and gives no advantage.

That shit looks dope
---
if I may ask did you get reported for it or did they somehow detect it?
---
You should always assume the Killer has BBQ. I personally don't even bother hiding from it, I don't care if I get chased. The only time I hide from BBQ is if the last guy is dead on hook and it's a hatch game, or if I need to be inside Terror Radius to set up for a save.
---
How the fuck? The title of this post is a meme, that's not an excuse. You're a fucking idiot if you think I'm the stupid one for trying to tell you. 
---
O.K
---
yes 1 more gen than those alive need to be done for the hatch to spawn
---
if they are looking at the bloodstain it will confuse them
---
The exposed effect IS a 1 hit down
---
I am not trying to shittalk you and your buddys, but "you aren't that good then".
---
I consider myself to be a above average/good player on both sides, even though I prefer killer. On rank 1 it just takes me + 1 (good) buddy in discord to win arround 8/10 games, no matter the killer or his perk setup.  
---
I can't imagine how 4 good survivors would wreck good killers. Just being able to communicate in voice-chat like discord, skype, teamspeak or something else breaks the game.
---
I don't expect to win every round. I just want a fair game. That being said, I usually let by 2 people SWFs because they are usually indestingusible from solos and they are not so bad once in a while. But 4 people SWF? That is way unfair for me to just press that ready button.
---
Just saying that’s an actual feature, I’ve been blinded before but barely managed to get away from it in time to where the survivor doesn’t get dropped
---
Nurse + Wraith/Doctor

---
What bloodstain?
---
Isnt this game a lot like mario party? Goal isnt to win its to be immersed right? You can win pretty easily by facecamping all survivors and bringing op perks but why would you? So you can feel like a winner? Thats not fun, and it doesnt require any skill at all. Face it, you are a sweaty rank 1 player that tryhards to bolster your ego. Kind of like a grown man going to a childs birthday party to win at darts, then trashtalking the kids when they lose.
---
Why do you have medkit with add-ons and no mither ?  Xd
---
It still hasn't hit me? I guess I'll eat another one. \*zooms out\*
---
Make chocolate ruin and record yourself eating it in survivor cosplay.

A weather condition called "wind" they explored it just recently when a famous instagram influencer fell of a bridge taking a selfi and flew away because he was so shallow.

---
I didn't know that was called the bloodstain, thanks for the info
---
It's not even just one watermark.
---
Why would anyone watermark this?
---
np man
---
Lmao.
---
Ok lets break this down..
---
1) i never said killers don't do that, and yes some do hit survivors on the hook. They are toxic douche ags but it's rare for this to happen in my experience whereas toxic survivors are very, very common.
---
2) "if you're getting tbagged you suck" oh wow, spot the survivor main. Some survivors drop 1 pallet and then immediately go to tbagging, some bring object of obsession and do it as soon as the game starts. No its not done in retaliation to anything, they're just toxic shits. Then you treat them like shit in game because they bring it on themselves and they disconnect and get salty in post game chat.
---
3) lmfao they're not doing it for free hits at all. That excuse is such bullshit. They just like having that safety net of being able to taunt the killer yet being completely safe.
---
Try playing killer sometime, at least outside of rank 20 and you will see how toxic a good number of survivors are.
---
I'm sorry my noobness has horrified you, I can only hope you will recover sooner rather than later
---
Don't feel bad, I just found it hilarious. The bloodstain is the red light that indicates what direction the killers are looking.
---
The game is fine
---
I love this comment
---
PC  
---
**Badham preschool**, when you hit and down a survivor close to those gray rectangle rocks, the fall on a place that the killer can't get them.

Link for a drawn of the location [here](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5d/7d/ea/5d7dea6a49075e1e27c6f9f0602b6e3f.png). I hit the survivor at the pink X, and they down on the yellow spot. 
---
I was mentioning the fact that the irony of the Wall hacking killer asking the Pallet Vaulting killer to be normal. No one was trying to bring up skill. Relax, buddy it’s just a meme.

---
Hag. I'm pretty good with her and she can be devastating, but I hate setting the trap web. I just want to start playing right away.  My other main is Myers tho, so it might be on me.
---
Yea your right. That’s definitely the worst part about her 
---
I wonder if she kicked another generator where she downed the other person. I think I've seen other glitches in DbD where actions seem to happen in multiple places at the same time for some reason. 
---
Guy is supposed to like the blue girl but instead likes the red girl. Thats the meme.
---
He gets so much hate for being the weakest killer though. Is it true?
---
The only good thing about F13 lol. In all seriousness I make so many more friends in that game than in dbd. Usually the killers aren’t toxic but really nice. A good example was when I was the last guy left and me and Jason bet that if I won a duel with him I would get 5 minutes to do whatever I wanted but if he won I would have to kill myself.
---
WANT TO KNOW HOW I LOST MY MEDICAL LICENSE?!
---
Killers will always camp, no one camps to get the 20 bloodpoints you get from a daily
---
FOV: Quake Pro ACTIVATED
---
Turn your graphics down and contrast up. It won’t look pretty but it’ll do the job. And then try perks like blood bound for tracking, or stridor.

*hitboxes are fine* imma stop you right there
---
The entire set though, she just puts the bro through hell, which drives him red.
---
In the end it doesn't matter though, the girl in red is just what the matrix wants you to see.
---
My big problem with console is honestly FPS and some hitboxes, outside of that it has the same problems as the PC version.  But the FPS are awful.
---
They fixed the loading time tho, gotta give them that. They alse blatantly lied to console players faces, so it may cancel out. Very complex situation.
---
Bloodhound, thano, ruin and sloppy. 
---
I've been having a lot in the last few weeks
---
Well the argument falls on its head when you claim 3 genning is unfun on killer.
---
It's a valid strat to start protecting 3 so you can slow the game down by forcing survivors to try and sneak one in slowly.
---
It's also plenty fun to be the annoying 3 gen doctor.
---
Commenting only to say this is not an important question
---
Is for me
---
For all but Legion(when using power)
---
Pre-nerf BT was awful because of you didn't camp and then hook someone at the end of the game you just get punished by BT.
---
Now you can at least down the savior
---
Fair point, it was more an unfair generalisation.
---
But yes! With Doctor it is very fun! I didn't think about him 😂😂😂
---
literally the best 5 entertainers imo. so glad puppers and ardetha were in there. 
---
Is "*Prove Thyself"* good enough?
---
For what I understand it only gives the extra repair speed to your teammates, not to you.
---
Balanced Landing could be good too. Didn't considered it.
---
Wow so much skill in a single photo.Another useless rank 1 post and another legion post.Clearly you have so much skill dude.Go fuck yourself.
---
Lead him to your buddy
---
generator jake makes saturated content sometimes and it's usually just shitposts soo
---
who are you
---
nobody likes him he's overrated and has an annoying voice
---
That is true. But is 36 meters far enough?
---
Isn't that like... just baaaarely outside the standard killers terror radius?
---
puppers gets little to no recognition put your panties back on x
---
I guess borrow time could be nice. I've been facing a lot of camper killers.
---
It still deserves to be downvoted.
---
Lol. That's your opinion. 
---
**Hillbilly + Leatherface**  
---
Charge up the Chainsaw to enter a deadly sprint. Survivors hit with the sprint will enter the Dying state. Hitting walls during the sprint sends you into a tantrum. The sprint ends if the chainsaw hits a pallet, but it will destroy the pallet. While sprinting, press the Secondary Power button to rapidly slow down to your normal speed and swing your chainsaw around. You will keep performing this chainsaw attack until you hit a survivor or a wall. If you hit a wall, you will perform a longer tantrum. You will keep on going after breaking pallets in this state.
---
I feel like its gunna zoom in on her singing the sound of music
---
tell the same to the babies insulting op for no panda
---
I was about to say "understandable, upvoted" but then you fucked all up with your last words
---
Meme or not, it‘s still incorrect. 
---
Yeah, I also try to go for a more "stealthy" gameplay. I suck at chases, so I just try to hide and move quietly and repairing gens while my teammates deal with the killer xD
---
Urban Evasion seems nice, specially for those smaller maps like the hospital or the saw map
---
125 to be exact, i think I'm on 300-400 kills already right now
---
Gotta find that shiny Eevee
---
I can't even argue that. 
---
Created by tyde tyme btw
---
Oh shit I was close. You probably can finish the achievement today if you really try.
---
Hope they don't find you first + AFK on gens.
---
Seriously, if they want you dead, you WILL die, it just takes so long that if the other 3 teammates are smart, all 5 gens will be done by the time they're finished. Legion can literally just ignore all game mechanics, it's ridiculous.
---
Huh, that is true. For quite some time I was taking ***Dark Sense*** as my *"vision"* perk until I found out that it only activates whenever I complete a generator. (#sad)
---
Yeah 36 is far lol. It may not be end to end of the map but you get pretty coverage of where the killer is, what everyone is doing, and if you don’t see someone... you can deduce where they are
---
You can hide it
---
Yeah I'm like trying to get 10 kills every day so I'll be done in a couple of days
---
So 3 games? I would just set aside like a few hours and grind.
---
In that case I guess it's still best to just take all perks I see to narrow it down anyways.
---
My friend also recommended me Spine Chill, but I get so focused on the gens and the skill checks that I forget to look at the perk xD
---
I am not sure if Sprint Burst is for me, I usually run a lot from gen to gen and I would not like to have my perk on cooldown if I suddenly face a killer :/
---
Probably would be Balanced Landing and/or Urban Evasion.
---
If only there was a way to counter NOED..
---
Daddy
---
I like playing against him its a challenge also i enjoy losing him in a chase and even following him until i am seen. Just so  the others can do gens.
---
Now I want a Babadook killer with Essie davis and a survivor!
---
Just don’t use NOED and tunnel and camp and survivors will find it a fun game regardless of whether they survive or die :) 
---
Keep using your crutch baby mode perks 
---
Honestly some matches are way easier against SWF because if there not the smartest they tend to all do stupid things and then you can have them all trying to save each other and no one on gens so you can slug them and keep getting hooks back to back
---
The same one won't keep coming up it'd still random in the next bloodweb but I still take it over items to eventually stop it from coming up
---
No one owes anyone else anything.
---
I hope this is a shitpost
---
*screams in being able to blink through all terrain*
---
I don't even do it in the hopes that someone will fall for it, I just do it to block off the shack as a safe spot for survivors.
---
People STILL fall for it, anyway... Though on the other side of things, as Survivor, I basically say "Well either I go down, or I TRY Shack and see if it's trapped or not". If it's trapped, then I was going to go down anyway.
---
Legion can easilby be countered by genrushing lol, just dont try to dick around with your swf buddies
---
Class photo, pill bottle and range are his best addons. Use the perks of your choice
---
Be an effective teammate and fo something instead of wasting 30 seconds healing in a corner
---
Shadowborn and Monitor &amp; Abuse might help too (widens FOV).
---
*also a 3 man* *legion is also running franks mixtape*
---
You can outplay leather face you cannot outplay legion 
---
Nice meme 
---
Killer afk ? Thats what u want? Or rank 15 baby killer?
---
Jokes aside, that happened EXACTLY the same to me yesterday. I saw the Spirit just standing there and POOF! on the ground I was.
---
(Great post btw, hope to see your other creations!) 
---
Thanks! 
---
Shadowborn level 4
---
prepare to get downvoted
---
Yeah, Leatherface with Agitation, Iron grip (not sure in english) that takes you and camps you at basement with only end for you that leads to death or death to other teammate aswell who tries to free you. Game breaker.
---
On Christmas event you got 2x BPs and one-three ebonies every single bloodweb.
---
That’s your teams fault not the games mechanics leather face can be outplayed

---
Bye'
---
Oh believe it. This is what the “best” players of this game have to offer
---
Its pretty rare honestly. Solo is crap right now
---
It’s been a bit more challenging recently due to Ruin being in the shrine and everyone running it. I do my best to ensure the team has a better chance of someone surviving, I accept that I’m not truly a rank 1 player as I only have less than 3 weeks in the game so my looping/jukes can be pretty laughable at times but other times I surprise myself. I’d say I probably escape about 30% of the time tecently
---
Mine is different. I usually make it to rank 4 with a build like this, and that's barely trying. I almost always double pip, and almost always have at least the CHOICE to 4k.
---
Remember Me. Yes this perk is very good. Seriously my favorite end game life saver. You need to spend the entire game beating the shit out of the obsession. Get them to final hook, but drag it out. Slugging this person but making it clear you're leaving them alive. False hope for later. The deal it you get at least to 5 stacks with this. And ALWAYS kill them before they can touché the gates. The obsession is immune to Remember Me. You just kill the. So they don't remove that extra time you worked so hard to build. 
---
Nurses Calling. Any additional aura reading abilities always help Freddy. People love to say "INSTA DOWNS ARE BEST FOR FREDDY!" No. Knowing where everyone is is best. This perk feeds into another perk. But the point is to boost sight and awareness. If you can keep everyone asleep and everyone hurt you have the potential to know where they all are at all times. That is an insane advantage no one seems to grasp. 
---
Thanataphobia. I choose this over Coulrophobia for one reason. Healing is already slow. Freddy has add one to make action speed slow as well. Coulrophobia doesn't always work as well as we want and it doesn't work for what I am trying to usually do. (You'll get it in a minute) Thanataphobia is not the strongest, but it is another time buyer. 
---
Here is where you can change things. 
---
The final slot is a wild card. I frequently change it. I don't really have a set choice. I will make suggestions. 
---
Franklins Demise can be useful as Freddy. I see people opening chests a lot more with him, and any time EVERYONE has an item and I don't bring this,  I wish I had. It's not essential though. 
---
BBQ is always good. But if you're not getting hooks you're wasting your time!  That means TRADING hooks. It is essential that you don't get sucked into the "TUNNEL THE EASY HURT PERSON OVER AND OVER!" It's a bitch move first of all, and you miss potential. They are already hurt and feeling pressure, go for the fool who thinks he's safe! Trust me. Also free extra aura reading!
---
Knockout can be evil, buts it's hit or miss. 
---
Sloppy Butcher or Bloodhound are good for extra tracking assistance. Dying light is potentially good to combine with Remember Me but kind of a moot point in my opinion. Blood Warden also can be helpful but I feel the same as I did about the former. 
---
Ruin obviously can buy time as well but I see Survivors finding that hex instantly nearly every time. I prefer perks like Discordance and Surveillance over Ruin. It helps instill fear of teamwork and objectives in the survivors, which can be a big advantage. 
---
Devour Hope is a risk, but fun when they realize just how screwed they are for not finding it. Always hide it until it's times for a clean sweep. 
---
If you struggle with getting looped things like Enduring and Spirit fury are good. 
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse is also fairly good. 
---
And here's some final advice. Try running Class Photo with Red Paintbrush. Your terror radius will be small. But when you put a survivor to sleep you will see them and all over survivors for the ready of the dream transition. That's two full seconds of aura reading. Like having BBQ without needing to hook. By the time they get too far away from you, they are shown by the default aura reading the dream world provides you. It's like using the Legion's long distance tracking finder but as Freddy. It's so easy to put everyone to sleep at once this way. Scare them all. And the. They spend more time trying to avoid you and wake back up than anything else. The downside to it is, class photo needs to be paired with something like red paintbrush because of the time to fall asleep penalty. Paint brush helps them fall asleep at normal time wile also giving the benefit of your tiny terror radius. By the time you're on them, it's too late. 
---
I find myself slugging a lot to make sure I am evenly trading Survivors on the hook. I will not back to back hook a person until all survivors are dead on hook. And then I usually start with the obsession. This rule goes the same with Mori's. I save the Mori as long as possible unless I'm behind and need to apply extra pressure. 
---
People honestly don't seem to expect it, or underestimate what I'm doing it and usually pay for it in the end. That being said, I frequently double pip every game. And the best part? I frequently let the last survivor live! Not saying you have to, but just showing that my plan usually works so well I don't even need the 4K. 
---
I would dodge every lobby with immersive Claudettes

How to play legion 101: His weakness without frenzy is slow movement speed.  These are the times you can loop him a bit (keep space so he doesn't hit you).  When he's in frenzy, aim for dead map squares: the farther from useful squares that contain generators and survivors, the better.  This is last resort stuff, though... What you should be doing FIRST is... Stay out of his terror radius, PERIOD.  Respect him, and go the other direction.  If you're alone with him in a dead map square, hide as long as possible, then run him in that area.  The Missyi important final note: when you're not in his terror radius, you should be doing gens.  If you follow these rules he will never more than 1-2k.
---
you’re literally acting like an entitled brat why should any of that matter
---
grow up
---
This is funny, but also the worst thing you can do.  You want to go down in a dead map square so your team can finish 2 gens.
---
Depends. You can’t get 900 points in one day.
---
Ruin, monitor and abuse, thanatophobia and sloppy butcher.
---
Ruin is self explanatory
---
M and A makes legions radius 16 when not in a chase which gives survivors less reaction time, and gives 8 more radius when in a chase giving you more opportunities to hit survivors in frenzy because of a larger terror radius.
---
Sloppy butcher: legion injures survivors pretty easily, giving them the extra sloppy butcher is really nice and wastes a lot of time because of mending+healing. Also goes hand to hand with the next perk
---
Thanatophobia: a lot of survivors don't heal against legion. So if they don't heal, they suffer the thanatophobia effect. If they heal that have to deal with sloppy butcher.
---
You can remove one of them and add bbq if you like, but if you're just trying to win, I suggest this load out. Enjoy the dcs
---
If you need your competition to play by the made-up rules of the Survivor playbook...
---
Killers saying 3 gen is fun are crazy. The fun should always be in the chase.  If you play killer to just annoy survivors as one person above said, it says a lot about the kind of person you are. Oh and people like him are the reason DC's are out of control.
---
Did you restart the game? The moment I am not seeing progress I restart it and it’s fixed. Meaning close the application all the way as a restart. 
---

I almost never use Prayers Beads :D I think speed and charging addons are the best for her once you learnt her. Prayer bead and Yakuyoke are nice for giggle build. But if they start gen tapping you don't have this advantage in chases \^\_\^  
---
Btw a lot of ultra rares aren't the best killer's addons. (Hag(1/2), Pig, Wraith(1/2), Legion, Freddy, Spirit, Clown(1/2, the other one isn't bad though).
---
Yeah! All things that annoy an individual survivor should be DELETED
---
"No brain, Legion main" is going to be my personal slogan from now on. 
---
You know how I know someone is being toxic? They're playing DBD. 
---
I think he’s fun to play and difficult to go against. He brings a different play style and I appreciate that aspect. Even if you don’t cheese his chase it’s still difficult sometimes and in the wrong hands he can be garbage. I usually look forward to these games because it makes me nervous as hell.
---
Didn’t you know it’s the weekend so no one is working! They turned all event progress off when they turned off the light in the office. 
---
To be fair, this meme adds a whole new dark meaning to survivors 'cleansing' NOED xD
---
I like Legion...
---
He has some issues that both make him a very weak killer and a very *irritating* killer.
---
His power is cool but he needs a huge balance patch to help him and the survivors (not that they need it)
---
Killing survivors and doing gens is pretty toxic if you ask me 
---
Same goes for league of legends
---
I've actually probably spent double that time watching guides and gameplay from other players TBH.
---
Why shouldn’t it be
---
Facecamping and dcing when i mori. I play both. 
---
"Oh you're a survivor doing a Gen? Toxic. Oh you're a killer trying to get kills? Toxic."
---
Haha yes
---
That’s because he’s not very entertaining.
---
Simple solution... Play killer. I know it's super hard for you survivor mains, but stop crying already.
---
Would rather scream every second than playing against legion.
---
Dude I'm not sure the devs have played at rank 1, let alone played on console.
---
I don't get why a lot of killers get pissed at SWF. SWF is a big advantage over solo survivors, but you can still easily get at least a pip out of SWF since they almost always save each other- meaning more hooks.
---
Is winning defined by getting a 4k or something? I've got plenty of Ruthless Killers only killing two survivors, that's a win to me.
---
You rank 20 or something? Stop bitching. It happens to everyone, once people learn how to play they do saves 
---
I disagree, most of the time you see me Camping it's on a Killer idk how to play.
---
If different Killer daylis didn't exist, I would never have to play Nurse and this would not happen for me.
---
A compromise Idea for our opposing views would be increase the chances for Chase Dailys.
---
They're very fun to play if you're not aiming to get a 4K. Going against them is either an unbearable pain in the ass or very easy depending on how good their tracking is and the build they're using.
---
Pretty much all of their add-ons are kinda negligible with the exception of the ones that affect mending and obviously Frank's mixtape. 
---
The list of viable perks is... Pretty lacklustre to say the least and I don't see any way they could fix that without reworking feral frenzy (imagine if exposed worked on it in its current state... Yikes). The Legion is without a doubt the best killer to use Franklin's, Third Seal and Thanatophobia on but they're all relatively weak still.
---
Needs Tru3!:)
---
I play with random shit to make the game more fun and challenging since I have all my characters prestige 3 level 50. Except for Jeff. I have him prestige 2 right now...lol
---
The object of obsession one , I didn’t get until 500 hours in. Granted I main killer but getting it at rank 1 survivor felt soo good. Was a rancor game too 
---
🦀
---
I got that one, having not finished the last gen, and being the first one out lol
---
Imagine thinking the Hag is OP
---
This event is the reason my killer rank became higher than my survivor rank in 4 days.
---
Spirit is the best
---
The same thing happened to my friend a few weeks ago. He started healing by a locker and it just... Ate him? He was healing in a locker and he couldn't get out.

Genius ranking system. 
---
#made with memeatic
---
Thanks for the tips
---
Happens to me more often as killer where if I’m rank 7 let’s say I’ll get 1 rank 8 and the rest are ranks 2-3, and when I first played survivor I ran into higher level killers.
---
Your killer rank is the average of their survivor ranks. 
---
#DISGOSTANG
---
There's no challenge involved when facing a legion. It's just hold W until he hits you, rinse and repeat.
---
It's playable. Not saying it shouldn't always be 60 fps at all times, but most of the people complaining about console are overreacting
---
Wraith + Freddy
---
:^)
---
Im dc'ing, see ya
---
I guess the loss really snapped something in his/her head and therefore he/she is just raging towards anyone. This shitpost is meant to trigger some people
---
How dare different people have different preferences.
---
Fun is subjective.
---
Oh God, your username. RIP my man.
---
Eh. It wasn't that bad, I got my own back when my mate farmed tf out of them, but still.
---
Not report worthy imo, just cuntish.
---
There are killer mains complaining about legion too. 
---
“reported for lag switching baby killer nerf spirit”
---
It would be awesome if characters get a new mori when they reach P3 lvl 50, that would encourage to prestige and would be an awesome addition.
---
The amount of crap in this sub has increased over the past few weeks and I blame Legion + free weekend for bringing edgy cringemen here
---
If you're good enough to get to rank 1, (It's not very hard) you'll only be facing lower ranks if they que together and they arent all rank 1, benefiting you.
---
The game is meant to be more casual, as the rank system isnt ranking in terms of how siege/overwatch/whatever game does it, it's to match people against one another. 
---
Earning rank with friends isnt boosting, and even if you're carried, you're still earning the rank yourself since the only real objective your team can help you with is the survival category and maybe intentionally getting hooked so you can save (though, most won't do that).
---
Restricting rank would be unhealthy, as the indirect consequence of restricting would be survivors deranking, making them more likely to face a lower rank killer then they already have queing with say, rank 16's, since they will all be low rank
---
It looks ugly and neither Dynogone nor PS Express get anything out of signing a copy of the looking at another girl's ass meme?
---
What are they going to do, demand karma royalties from RysSelvas?
---
Yeah but it still sucks and ruins the game for the person that he camped especially if it was a fairly lucky kill.
---
I have no problem with Leatherface or Hillbilly, it’s just the wankers that hard camp with them as it’s pretty much impossible to be rescued so being hooked by them guarantees a lost pip. Thankfully at higher ranks you don’t see as many people who hard camp.
---
Beautiful.
---
For a moment I thought you were serious. 
---
Not gonna lie... I dropped my phone.
---
:D so you play doctor for easy matches but I'm the one who should get better. :DD I should also just outplay legion and nurse. :DDD Apparently if a survivor wants something else than AFKing on gens he is also bad. :DDDD And you wrap it up with a stupid generalizing about survivors... But you say it to a guy who switched from playing mostly survivor to killer several months ago. I could get into Freddy as well but there is no point. This is already epic.
---
Inspired by someone saying they DC against *fucking Doctor*

Me putting traps in front of lanterns. Literally got one trap triggered 6 times in front of the same lantern. 3 of those times were the same Dwight. 
---
You say itll make it harder for higher ranked people to find fast matches but do you not see the consequences of making seperate game modes where people can only earn bp by playing solo? There would be tons of survivors who wouldn't wanna play survivor because they can't swf anymore and earn currency for it, itd divide people and make matches take longer to find. A lot of people find solo survivor terrible to play. 
---
I know right! God forbid you might enjoy something someone else detest! 
---
You just rancor'd. Now that's toxic.
---
Doctor will always be biggest gay to me uwu
---
I always face killers that don’t juggle when I’m in this situation!
---
i’ve never had an issue on either side with him and i’m on console
---
just because i play a certain killer doesn’t mean i’m an asshole with him
---
what makes YOU an asshole, however, is you disconnecting against a killer you don’t like and effectively screwing over your teammates because you think you’re more important 
---
i don’t disconnect against an obsession or certain maps just because i don’t like them nor do i camp to try to ruin someone else’s game because i feel like i’m entitled to a win 
---
new shadowborn buff??
---
you literally in your comment above said tunneling is all chases to kill a survivor. yes. it's playing the game, man. it's how you do it. you chase everyone multiple times to put them on the hook and kill. 
---
I remember being called a tryhard and still ez match when I was playing Legion with Beast of Prey and Distressing for BP farming. Didn't even have Ruin or anything.
---
That's what good... nvm
---
I think LOL is actually more toxic than even dbd. I’ve had some *really* bad experiences from that game. 
---
No one said that.
---
This is actually very cute, even with its simplicity.
---
Fuck I was about to say that take my upvote
---
I guess it's still less annoying than hearing Freddy's song lol
---
No childish comments thnx.
---
Phillip looks like he’s about to hit Herman with a running powerslam while manager Sally interferes with the match.
---
I’d say Monto he’s not Spirt or Myers main but his builds and gameplay should teach you how to effectively use that character
---
David does not approve 
---
its not just this subreddit
---
You literally said that
---
I don't think it's awful. it's a needed mechanism for when your game crashes. 
---
Nice
---
Watch zubatlel, he’ll teach you to be a good killer in general.
---
I could care less about the constant shit fps. As long as it didn't take 10+ minutes to find a swf game. It fucking blows my mind that I can Que up as a killer and have a full lobby in less than a minute but I can't find a game with my friends? Shit even solo survivor que usually takes less than 5. It's literally the most infuriating thing about this game. 
---
Hi David, I'm Dad.
---
I actually have Calm Spirit on most of my survivors just for Doc. Everyone but Tapp Quentin and No Mither Meg.
---
4 survivors alive 5 gens must be done or 0 gens left, 3 survivors alive 4 gens must be done or 1 gen left, 2 survivors alive 3 gens must be done or 2 gens left, 1 survivor alive 2 gens must be done or 3 gens left.
---
But that remember thats just the spawn, in order for it to open just one survivor can be alive unless another one has a key
---
Throw in Borrowed time and Saboteur for some extra hook destruction 
---
“Fuck Your Skillchecks: The Movie: The Game”
---
Distressing, Ruin, Nurse’s Calling, Unnerving Presence
---
I hope you’re not one of those players who can see that someone is coming only to attempt to escape, not Kobe and then just not struggle. I have come for people or just given it a few seconds for the killer to walk away and as I leave my gen (you know, the objective), that person kills them selves on the hook. Cool. That’s happened to me so many times I don’t want to go  get people. 
---
I actually want to level up and prestige my characters thank you very much.  5000 bp for escaping right then and there, PLUS with a vessel.  Yep, not going back, I already got all my points.
---
Found one of the survivors
---
What I DO want to make clear is I don’t leave without knowing the odds...  I leave if NOED is active.  I leave if I am injured and can’t heal in time to save.  I leave if the killer camps.  As soon as I get to the gate I am leaving, at most I’ll distract the killer but oh jesus if Make Your Choice is active I already made MY choice.  If I am running BT I’ll go for the save, unless you were a useless pleb who hid in a locker all round.  Don’t call me a coward in the endgame chat because those odds weren’t in my favor
---
I think one could argue that The Pig would be Dark/Steel
---
May not get you many BP but it’s still hilarious 
---
its people like you who ruin the game, as soon as ANYTHING at ALL doesn't go a survivors way, they throw the game and give up, i've never seen more crybaby players in any video game honestly, and its incredibly annoying, I cant remember the last time I played killer and was winning where a survivor just didn't give up because they didn't have a 100% chance to have a 4 man ez escape game because I was winning, it makes a lot of killer victories feel hollow, and when you're playing survivor it just fucks you. I just hope one day BHVR grows some balls and actually bans players who do this shit.
---
"CAN YOU NOT?" is my solo queue mood.
---
I still dont see how it hurts him, whats he supposed to do? not chase survivors...?
---
It should be some time in March, since they confirmed that a new DLC was releasing for Spring via the roadmap. Info on the new killer should be coming at any point now, probably within a couple of weeks

I love lore friendly builds
---
I've been playing nothing but pig, I'm doing my part
---
Oh now i get what youre saying. XD
---
No it wasn't meant to be that...... mostly. 
---
reminder that DCers deserve a ban 
---
That Rank 18 is a wholesome boi &lt;3
---
&gt; There’s a pretty good pallet juke: you need to take two hits near a thrown down pallet, then vault it and run for your life. He’ll get Frenzy cooldown, then he’ll have to break the pallet and only then he can chase you again. Combined with Lithe that’s a 100% chance you will run away.
---
EXACTLY THIS! it counters legion pretty well. or atleast wastes so much time for the killer/legion.
---
Talking about people whining about wait times.  I get full lobbies right away. 😁
---
Oh yeah that'd be fitting
---
i mean he was the first to be killed then everyone else i slugged haha
---
Probably "Man, this sucks, I want an actual game, better finish fast because farming is boring as fuck"  
---
they are playing legion tho, so their fault
---
"Trash" or as its commonly known: " you killed me and i don't like that"
---
That sucks.  Must be horrible to rely on bad internet. 
---
Huntress + Leatherface = She just throws chainsaws now ( ͡◉ ͜ʖ ͡◉) 
---
How about we just uhhhh Let Anna Yeet All The Things
---
*This post made by the Huntress Momma Gang*
---
But that means Leatherface has an advantage over the Hilbilly.
---
New DBD meta? Leatherface fucking obliterates the Hillbilly with a cross chop?
---
Thats fine but just remember its a team game. Everyone does something to progress the game. You may escape with 20k points but what about that guy who had to loop all game so he couldnt get any points? Dont you think he needs that 5k more than you do? Just food for thought. Youre allowed to play any way you want.
---
Love them! Would have gone for the bloody Jeff head on the left but there really nice either way :)
---
Yeah, if only there was a proper secondary objective and no a perk which acts as a band-aid to the lack of actual secondary objectives years after the game's release. Oh well, hope we get one soon.
---
I agree with everything but coldwind.  
---
You risk bringing that bullshit on other killers :P
---
so survivors cant have "fun" unless they all win and obliterate the killer? hmmm... quite telling
---
playing a 40 minute game if you want to escape? Lame
---
why would you break a dull totem before opening the door, that's my question
---
I haven’t been on the DBD spotlight since the legion came into the game and EVERYONE said he sucked and to buff him, but how everyone is saying he’s overpowered... what gives?
---
I really hope I can get that Wraith one with shards.
---
to be fair, usually if someone is unhooking right in front of you, they have borrowed time, which makes the rescuer a lot easier to down, but maybe i'm overestimating the intelligence of some survivors im not sure.
---
You're being punished for playing Legion
---
I literally do not care.
---
It ain't like killers do the same shit. So... Pot kettle.
---
I play for fun and that doctor tactic is the most un-fun shit to play against.
---
Completely agree. I think this is one of the only games I've ever played where I have put in so many hours and still feel like I'm shit at it pretty often. 
---
Nope. I just sit there waiting for someone, anyone. I don’t move (no jumping jacks or hook gymnastics) unless i’m desperate at the last second of attempt phase. I sit through the whole struggle phase while everyone is doing gens (you know, the objective). Sometimes one guy will be running killer, near enough to the others that they know the hook is safe, but they just saunter off to do gens (the objective). The real kick is when two people heal each other the entire time then walk to the opposite side of the map. I’m pretty altruistic, and good luck to y’all but fuck saving survivors. 
---
Yeah, that frame rate is pretty crap, but try playing the doctor on the cornfields. Like watching a Powerpoint presentation ...
---
that fucking claudette oh my fucking god lmao
---
Gen rushing ruins legion, because he has no endgame. Since his Frenzy without Frank's Mix tape is really weak endgame.
---
Most people just panic and stop doing the gens and just run around.
---
Imagine using balanced landing
---
***^(CRAAWWWWLING I)****^(N THE END, IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER, I)***^('VE BECOME SO NUMB, I CAN'T FEEL YOU THERE, BECOME SO)** ^(NUMB, WITHOUT A SOUUUUL....)
---
It's raping time.
---
An easy game is a shit game.
---
Don't twist my words.
---
how are your memes always so good lmao
---
I disagree. People on League are definitely toxic, but people there get mad if I invade their jungle or gank them repeatedly (I'm a jungle). Here? People flame me for literally playing the game. There's a reason my steam profile is private.
---
Kinda sucks that the community is pushing you away from the game. Rip man.
---
While people are saying hes right behind Freddy on the tier list
---
You probably had just as much fun in the lobby.
---
Ardetha always teaches you something, always comments as he plays and he has some Myers stuff. ZubatLEL is a great killer too. Monto is a pretty good Spirit, but he usually uses Prayer Beads.
---
You may find some Spirit mains, the problem with Myers is that most videos out there don't use it seriously, they're just meme builds using pink and purple add ons that completely change his gameplay, like permamori or the mirrors. I've also tried to look for some normal Myers plays, Ardetha gave me that (sort of), but if you find something let me now.
---
And the 1% who just stay and we usually live. Yestarday in a 3 man swf we went against a camping legion he had no ed as well and we all escaped including the random
---
Legion with NOED? 🤔
---
Fair enough
---
For every Legion whining post I see, it just makes me want to play them more. I started out just using them for Discordance, now I live for the tears.
---
Yeah I don't have the proof but he also had distordance and iron maiden
---
I haven’t played in a while. Is legion good now?
---
Having the same issue. Multiple games with no event points. A rotating circle showing instead of the event progress when back to menu. Tried playing different days, restarts, verify. Nothing seems to make much difference. Just seems odd to me that myself and so many of my friends are still having this issue this far into the event, and there is little support or acknowledgement of the ongoing problem. 
---
Bringing a memento mori in case Devour Hope gets taken offline when you hit 3 stacks? I like your thinking. 
---
playing him and i'm having a blast with all the disconects

Doctor is more of an Electric physic since his whole thing is messing with your mind imo.
---
&gt; Stay out of his terror radius, PERIOD. Respect him, and go the other direction. If you're alone with him in a dead map square, hide as long as possible, then run him in that area. 
---
*[Laughs in M&amp;A Legion with a 16m terror radius.]*
---
But hey, the best counter is having a Legion play fair, because it makes for a fun game. Most of my matches generate satisfied Survivors even if they are sacrificed because I keep bouncing on them instead of tunneling my Frenzy. Of course, as a Survivor you don't really have any agency in this.
---
Sounds like people who aren't practiced in dealing with a Legion
---
Baffling, isn't it? I always put a killer shack trap, think to myself "they're gonna snap it" then someone ends up ensnared in it haha
---
Probably in a month or so, new info in a couple of weeks. They already gave us a hint, the flag of Mali. Some redditors did research on african folklore and suggested the Adze, a firefly vampire, as a possible inspiration.
---
Lol OP is obviously trolling.  Even if you're on or those cat strangling sickos that actually enjoys playing Legion I don't think anyone thinks he's balanced.
---
that what i'm doing too. there are some super annoying loops that would waste you so much time without traps. the traps are super visible, but most of the time they panic and run into them anyway.
---
another thing i like doing is not destroying pallets. putting traps there is pretty fun. they either learn that there are traps and wont use pallets anymore (so sometimes they'll run really stupid "loops" and get hooked fast) or they dont learn and i trap them again and again.
---
Learn how to stealth properly. Sadly it's almost impossible to stealth against Legion if you're the last Survivor, as opposed to almost all Killers, but it works quite well when you're still in a team. Last time I almost escaped against a Frank's Legion in a 1x1 trial because I tried my best to use stealth, but of course I didn't escape because, well, Frank's.
---
Yea nah, fuck off cunt. 
---
Struggling to find games must have a big impact on your day to day life. 
---
Yeah. But their understanding of what Enduring is is so flawed that either way it's embarrassing.
---
About every 4 games or so. Solo survivor is being neglected and really needs some attention. Playing rank 1 and going against an onslaught of noed, ruin, ebony Morris, and powerful add ons every match is starting to ruin my fun in game. 
---
Actually wrong lol. I rarely come across borrowed time. But if I hit them and they do have BT I just let them go.
---
Apparently BT is just like mending and doesn’t go down in a chase.
---
I use *Bloodhound 3, Predator 3, Sloppy 3, and Spies from the Shadows 3. I literally never lose anyone in a chase.
---
I stab someone with Frenzy, cancel, let them go ahead a bit and just follow the long ass path path of blood and scratch marks. Even if they walk/crouch away, the blood is more than enough to follow them. It’s not very quick mind you, so the only times I end up losing as Legion is when I’m being genrushed really. 
---
As someone who plays him a lot he definitely needs to be changed. Considering the “Stare at the floor and break chase” Glitch has not been even acknowledged says a lot. It’s literally gamebreaking and an easy way to kill people. 
---
dont fall for michael he plays w ur heart 😡
---
The new shadowborn buff looks great
---
No Dragon killer FeelsBadMan
---
That 10 seconds is a lot of time. That's at least 1/8 of one generator and probably applies to multiple generators.
---
NOED only has utility against one survivor unless the others decide they don't care about the game or you run Blood Warden or Remember Me
---
Great summary of this sub the past few weeks
---
Imagine being that salty at a comment you go and search through someone's post history. Big yikes.
---
BBQ got nerfed into the ground.  Lockers block auras.  Just slow vault a locker when a killer downs someone and you'll beat the read everytime.
---
Also if you're playing the newest killer Legion and you see your health bar first turn orange and then immediately dip to 50% like 3 seconds later just DC.
---
Best tips I can give you.
---
I do but I’m not gonna respond negatively 
---
And you're acting like you've never done it lmao. That's a yikes for me dawg. 
---
Is that the Entity chewing in Myer's ear, trying to get a reaction out of him?
---
He is meant to play Friday the 13th
---
Was only made like 3 times before. So still fresh, even with exact same caption.
---
TOO MUCH SHOCK THERAPY 
---
no thats so rude !!!!!!!!!!!
---
💀💀💀
---
statistically, it takes more time for Fred to down a survivor. he can only rely on survivors being potatoes in chase that's why they call him not a master tunneler but noob stomper. he can tunnel but that is a road to complete loss. as Freddy main for a year I tell you that tunneling is not a valid strategy for a killer with no help in chase apart from tracking. even Doctor can stop the looping with Treatment. and only real efficient killer for tunneling is Legion. 
---
It's usually the type of player that plays Leatherface, honestly. He tends to attract braindead campers who lack basic chasing fundamentals.  
---
tbh it would be enought to add 1 more rank 'league' on top of what we have now. lets say 10 more ranks where to pip u have to do much more than currently. master ranks or something
---
i mean the non-smurf low ranks
---
You don’t actually depip it just shows that in the end game screen. It’s been a glitch for a long time.
---
So your team can ~~finish 2 gens~~ all run towards you to get the unhook for WGLF but each take a hit and run away to mend and Self-Care while you go into struggle mode on the first hook.
---
rank 15 always has sweaties 💀
---
*sees one Ruin skillcheck*
---
See you in the next game boys!
---
Damn kappa Legion, NOED and slugs, you ain't even a baby killer, your ass was born 9 weeks premature.
---
i commend you my fellow slav friend
---
(Laughs in Michael Myers)
---
The clown is waaaaay too majestic to be a fairy type
---
Spirit is just as good as Billy. People that put her in B tier are drunk.
---
I think the true horror here is your build.
---
Dude, they are sandbagging / throwing. Telling them to just stop won’t do anything. Report them in the griefing trolling category and block them.
---
Wow can't believe killer even killed you in that scenario.  Zero integrity.  I'd have to take a shower for killing survivors in a 2 man load in.
---
I do, however, realize that most Freddies you meet are tunnelers. but that is due to them not realising the actual potential of killer and not using all the cool things they could be using. not so many of them too. 
---
Damn i hope not for now. Their dlc is so much expensive 
---
It's just so effective. Can't loop the killer shack. It's like that one spot under the pipe in the Game: you aren't trying to get people to go in it, you just wanna make that vault infinitely less safe to give you an easier chase.
---
Im very jelly of all these doctor players with distressing, my doc is lv 50 and i have yet to get it once in my bloodweb lmao.
---
Correct. There is zero reason to heal against a Legion unless they have Thanataphobia or M&amp;A. Too many people waste a ridiculous amount of time healing just to get Frenzy'd 15 seconds later. 
---
He's not OP unless he has certain add-ons. The problem is that he's boring to play against, and will mean a long match of constantly mending/ healing and running across the map. It's even longer if he has Ruin, and you usually can't work together on gens due to Discordance.
---
It took me a prestige and a half to get Distressing, don't worry.
---
Also it isn't worth it unless you also run Unnerving Presence 
---
I'm pretty sure this is [Prisma Illya](https://myanimelist.net/anime/14829/Fate_kaleid_liner_Prisma☆Illya?q=Prisma%20), or at the very least it's from the [Fate](https://myanimelist.net/anime/356/Fate_stay_night?q=Fate) franchise.
---
Ooooh, now your shoe is on your... other foot... that's in my trap! Yeah!
---
Don't feed him Hex is a well established forum troll
---
makes sense actually, I don't know why I forgot about making him psychic 
---
Lol blame your fellow brothers.  Most scratched mirrors I've encountered camp hooks from behind the wall at Lerys.p
---
Laughs in empathy.
---
Its not toxic, but it feels bad when I get Rancored because I never use d-strike and the killer thinks "Haha, got you, you little d-strike noob"
---
First 2 yeah. You're literally just injured.
---
Adam Francis didn't commit an atrocity, he just *basically* died in a traincrash and was taken by the entity. 
---
I bookmarked the page on etsy, I'm totally gonna get some of these bc they are fire my guy. Love it!
---
I mean is he wrong you know what you're doing with that load out.  Maps so tiny they basically stay in T3 with last 3 gens.  Naturally I'm assuming you also trick them into leaving the gens up you want.
---
Most annoying thing about watching this is you can see him going for the hook save anyway, when there's clearly no point as you're right behind him. Survivors that do this, ay yiy yiiiiiy.
---
Do you not read the perk? If it says that you are injured of course it would have the same effects as being injured normally. And of course This Is Not Happening will be active, cause guess what, you're injured.
---
Yeah man, screw you for wanting to play with the DLC you bought  - every entitled survivor main
---
&gt;Michael - he won't return my calls wtf broken
---
He IS returning your calls! You just can't tell because he never says anything :(
---
Don't let this distract you from the fact Anna wearing shoes.
---
Oh boy 1 person can sit on the hook while the other 3 play skill check simulator and another pulls up another tab until he hears something.
---
This is the gameplay you're advocating.
---
Yeah there are.  2 kills with a specific killer
---
I had an idea for Left Behind the other day actually. Something like:
---
"*You'll get the job done... No matter the cost.* If you are the last survivor remaining in the trail, cleanse and become immune to all status inflicted by the killer. The next time you would be put into the dying state, instead become injured if not already, otherwise, you remain in the injured state. If the attack that would have put you into the dying state is a basic attack, the recovery cooldown is halved for the killer.
---
The exposed status affect applied by Evil Within III is unaffected by Left Behind"
---
So essentially this just gives you more tools to survive when you are the last survivor. It can be extremely strong if the killer is relying on the Exposed status affect or has an add-on that applies Exhaustion. It also give a free hit that can be strong against one-hit-kill weapons, such as Chainsaws or Evil Within, but triggering the affect only has half of the penalty of a regular basic attack. It sort of becomes a much less reliable Adrenaline meant to by more time as one looks for the hatch.
---
I mean you can always stop playing the game if you don’t like being camped 
---
I can't think of anything in gaming right now that pisses me off more than your teammates surrounding the hook while the killer camps. They could each finish a gen in that time but instead nothing gets done and you die. 
---
Why Freddy? He is one of the weakest killers in the game...
---
Hahah nice one 
---
I wish I could see the gen count so I could tell if this was filth or not.
---
DARN
---
You’re a funny one. 
---
ya, i usually play an hour or so a few days a week, so those 3 hours for me were over 6 days
---
i imagine the streamers would have had their 9th coin within 4 days, however, for the rest of us, i was wondering how long their progress was taking. just because i enjoy making spreadsheets and logging data trends
---
How old are you? 
---
That perk build gives me jump scares.
---
Better maybe, but the average red rank player still isn't good
---
I’ve tried this and failed. The timing seems to be very difficult to achieve 
---
Camped as a Myers cause I gotta level Evil Within four times against rank 1's so it's easier to just sit on the hook and stare from a corner when they come for the unhook, then one-shot 'em after evil 3'ing.
---
Nice.
---
3 with hex ruin, should of known to get that was just trying to avoid names. 
---
How would that be balanced for killers though? What happens when 1,2 or even 3 people leave within a minute of the game starting? Should they lose the offerings sonce theres one person or do they get it back? And then how do you balance that to prevent farming?
---
Oh god....yeah short answer is any amount of gens up results in that killer being filth.  If it was endgame though I welcome any killer to camp me, games over at that point for them anyway.
---
because only one is good
---
&gt;Legion can literally just ignore all game mechanics, it's ridiculous.
---
So Legion can insta-down you, insta-kill you, walk through all obstacles, and see you at all times? What, they can't? Oh, that's right, that's because they **don't** ignore **all** mechanics. 
---
They ignore 1 mechanic. Pallets. 
---
Solution? Learn to play the game without relying on a single mechanic all the time.
---
Lmao Legion main salty
---
Spirit, can't see survivors but it's stupid easy to find them because of scratches and sound
---
The Doctor is fun to play/against.
---
1 and 2, yeah
---
3, im not sure but i think the entity picks people with high hope as the survivors
---
if you hear the sound and they keep healing you, you can break the heal yourself with your sprint button
---
😂
---
I tried, it wouldn't work.
---
Yea and that's a lot more common during this moonrise event. People grab a vessel and hide because they want to escape with it. They don't help their teammates and risk getting killed. 
---
I died first one match and spectated until the end. One guy with a vessel was camping the hatch just waiting for the others to die. 
---
The opposite of a yoink
---
Nurse should be Flying-type too, and Legion is Normal just wishes it was dark, just like Rattata. And obvi The Pig should be Oink-type.
---
Im not sure what Im suppose to comment on. Typical doctor game. Lol but for real my fav moment as doctor was when I loaded walked to a gen heard one person scream. Then immediately they all started dcing. 
---
Whatever happened to the victorian/olden times killer they hinted at :/
---
is this water colour? I love it, it’s a beautiful painting :) 
---
When im trying to sleep by my dog wont stop licking himself.
---
This comment is just too innocent and honest to be downvoted, even if everyone hates the killer.
---
That biuld where you just chilling down the basement, protecting the chest?
---
No it wouldn't, If you think that many people would opt out of wanting to play with SWFs that it would kill the game that should tell you right there how fucking broken and unfun SWFs are to play with and against.
---
If people are going to quit playing because they can no longer get boosted or play the game in a way that gives them an unfair advantage then the game deserves to die anyway. 
---
We have the Nurse tho. When did they release that hint?
---
Its beatable just gotta have coordination like have 2 people loop around a gen acting like we all want that gen while a 3rd works on a gen away from them. Survivors make a mistake thinking we will chase them away from the gen. Like dont get me wrong Ill chase but I also(and im sure other killers do to) look where they are going and see pallets and loops that would give their teammates plenty of time to finish a gen. Especially if you sprint burst as soon as I get close and dont get a hit in. So If I get a hit and can tell your not going to a good loop then ill chase. 
---
3gen is also survivors fault for not spreading gens out. I rarely defend 3 gens for end game. 3 gen anyone was brutal af. If you think docs is bad try freddy had 1 last night. I kept sleeping them so they worked on it considerably slower and had to brk it to snap out. Giving me plenty of time to chase/hook(doctor doesnt have that kinda time)and know where they are
---
While I do agree with others that the Doc should be electric/psychic....just look at how many killers that have dark or ghost! A psychic killer would turn into a punching bag for over half the killer cast :(
---
I think they hate what you’re saying but that doesn’t make it less true.
---
It's so hard to watch console movement. 
---
Played legion for a daily (although I do think legion is fun to play as and against if legion dosen't cheese walk backwards it) and someone dc as soon as they saw me, and the other one killed themselves on hook. So I just let the other 2 finish the gens to leave. It was dumb as hell in all honesty
---
*D-Strikes*
---
we need pinhead in the game, his power should be he pulls out the cube and shoots chains with fish hooks attached like in the movie and it can chase a survivor up to a certain distance depending on addons and 1st hit injures but 2nd hit snags survivor and starts dragging them back towards pinhead and the survivor either has to wiggle or hit a couple hard skill checks to avoid being dragged back and picked up by pinhead, and there could be an ultra rare addon that allows snagging of healthy survivors or something....regardless of the power we still need pinhead in this game that would be awesome or just have the cenobites in the game kind like the legion where you can select a different skin between pinhead and like 2 or 3 of the other cenobites from the hellraiser movies. just a thought, but the mori would have to be the death from the end of Hellraiser one where the chains and fish hooks go all over that dude and rip him apart 
---
The killer was carrying the survivor not picking them up. I said that.
---
Yeah they get to tier 3 madness and they get exposed
---
Not enough survivors?
---
Awww Michael you look cute
---
Bro I ran out of game offerings on my doc. So was sooooo sooooo happy when I ran this build. And a survivor gave the game offering.. - now you fucked up!
---
This sub has gone to crap this past few weeks. If someone gets a mosquitoe in his room they post it in this sub. Sorting by new is depressing.
---
daddy 🥵🥵
---
AAAGH-OHH! That hurt you know! What'd you even... stab me with? Euuugh... why do I even try? I should just become a survivor... I dunno if I could do generators though.
---
Disappointed this isn't just Billy/Bubba turning into a Beyblade and letting it rip.

I didnt find a single survivor I wouldnt think the game is that dead

I think it’s also annoying to get legion posts asking why everyone hates them or something related to that

Guess they'll just play the SWF/KYF hybrid then? No point in earning BP there since everything's already maxed out.

Game certainly isnt dead, around 30-45K players daily.

Rank 20 has a long timer for killer. Try to play during high player hours(during evenings). It should help.

I only dc if the legion is moonwalking with franks mixtape. That right there is the most boring match to play. Honestly though the legion fanboys on this reddit are fucking real. Easiest and most boring cosplay pictures everywhere, same with "artists" drawing him. 
---
can't remember my first prestige killer, but my first tier 3 prestige was the Huntress, still my favorite.
---
Did you make this yourself? 
---
Locker plays turn your BBQ into simply We're Gonna Live Forever.  
---
And it's not the killer I'll DC to it's the addon.  I'll play Legions all day but if I see Frank's Mix Tape in that load out I'm loading out of that game.
---
No it was way way after that just before the release of Legion
---
I don't know about that. There's already so many perks. Someone proposed the idea of giving survivors abilities like the killers in order to make them more than a skin.
---
Through the gates practically never everyone's a moron at red ranks, 98% of the time I'm taking the hatch escape.
---
No, a friend sent me it. I thought people would like to see it. 
---
it is! thank you :D

That's not what people generally mean by immersed though.
---
Hey I subscribe to him lol

Considering the fact this image is 10 pixels tall, I'd have to say no, which makes it even funnier someone gave OP gold for this 
---
THE MOST SATISFYING HIT AS KILLER WHEN A HOE IS T-BAGGING BEHIND A WINDOW OR BUSH AND YOU WHACK THE MOTHERFUCKER. 
---
ive had a rough day 
---
Yeah I wouldn't think the game is dead especially when its on sale I will try playing later in the day thanks 
---
Walking backwards as Legion to end the chase so the survivor can bleed out
---
Yeah sounds like you're one of the good ones.  Sorry they ruined your fun man.  If they don't camp I find it to be a fun and intense game.
---
Evil within + feral Frenzy BOI!
---
Deep Wound only counts down outside of a chase, so some Legion players moonwalk to cancel the chase and start the bleedout timer.
---
I don't remember that being a thing, but the first official clue is the Mali flag. I remember something about being the most ancient killer to date, I think from a dev stream, but I don't really remember when so I cannot provide a link. Maybe thats what you're thinking about.
---
Better apply for BHVR then, heard they are hiring.
---
Did legion get changed? I remember people talking about him being F-tier
---
(I haven't played the game since before clown but visit the sub every once in a while)
---
And you got gold for this? :L
---
He is a Fog Whisperer (I think thats the name). They are selected streamers, content creators, part of the community that get official leaks directly from BVHR and are allowed to give us some hints or clues.
---
Imagine you have a dog (or a cat) that constantly shits on the rug. Over and over, no matter how many ties you try to train them to do their business in the right place. It's not going to ruin your life or anything but it's still annoying and there's no way to get around it.
---
That's Legion.
---
I don’t have too much of an issue with it honestly and i’ve gotten to red ranks with her on console but maybe i’m just a weirdo lol. I play at 80% myself and am just used to it. 
---
Yeah, the grind is too much. I think that halving the required points would have still taken long enough but wouldn't be way too grindy
---
I bet they really miss out on holding w
---
That's so good. I started a match next to a pallet and thought maybe someone tries to loop me here later. The whole match played on the other side of the map. I hooked one, they swarmed etc. It was a awesome match. The last survivor was a meg. She ran to the pallet I trapped in the beginning. I heard the hatch noise and smiled. She stuns me, t-bags because of the hatch right behind her and BAM steps into my trap. My most satisfying win ever
---
Yeah, I had to stop the sandbag
---
And his license isn't very expensive, so it is possible. I think the bees would be part of his ability, and the map would probably be something like the ghetto of the movie, so like Haddonfield or Sprinwood, outside setting with houses.
---
Aye
---
I don't even care about the Achievement honestly. It's the fact that over 400 hours of Gameplay, and I've never been able to even get it due to salty/BM'ing Survivors quitting and taunting me about suicide after.

Like bro wtf.Just run from him.Not hard at all./s
---
Have you tried going to your NVIDIA control panel and setting the resolution to 2560*1440 instead of 3440*1440?
---
I like how people ask this then when I tell you how everyone ignores what I say. But, if you will actually listen, here's how to get an edge on Legion:
---
Spread out and take down gens solo. Never work on gens together!
---
Stealth does work but only if you or your teammates don't get hit. It's a team stealth effort.
---
Spreading out minimize's the chances of having your position revealed if one of your teammates does get hit.
---
If you get found try to keep focus on you and don't run any further then your current location. There's a good chance that the Legion will take your bait and tunnel you.
---
Try and bait pallet stuns while they are frenzied. It knocks them out of frenzy and stuns them decently long.
---
If you see them moonwalking or trying to cheese the chase system so the bleed-out timer goes down get up in their face and try out those 360 jukes. Worst case scenario you get whacked and go down which was probably going to happen anyways. Best case scenario you buy yourself more time with the bleed-out timer paused. 
---
If you're in a coordinated team, having one person with an obsession perk to bait Legions into tunneling you will give your team time to repair gennys.
---
Jumping over a pallet then jumping back over it while the Legion is frenzied and hopping over it is a good way to juke them during a chase.
---
Sometimes getting hit by a frenzied Legion is better then getting a normal smack. They won't see your heartbeat and you can juke them easier then. Once safely away mend up and go back to a gen.
---
Touching all of the gens can help to confuse the Legion as to where you are at any one time.
---
Honestly, if you follow these tips and don't get matched up with potato teammates then there's a good likelihood that most, if not all of you, will escape. Sure the match will be *long*, but that just means more BP for both sides.
---
I didnt want all of the cosmetics. I only needed 4 coins to get what I wanted. I just played the game normally. 
---
Do you mean distortion?
---
Yo not gonna lie I play doctor a lot and they always bully me in post game chat saying that it's too easy to play the doctor as you immediately know the location of surviours, but I mean If you can't time your shocks he's a basic M1 killer 
---
You play legion.You are invalid we all know it.
---
LOL who would want to be in the bunker, I shoulda left years ago. See ya chump
---
Those people are dicks, but I just don't let them get to me. And they're exactly the reason why so many of us don't even hunt the achievements in the first place. It's basically a lucky draw if/when you finally get the 4K. And not really worth the hassle either.
---
LOVE 🔥 THIS 🔥 BUILD 🔥
---
Maybe not a lot of survivors on in that rank. What rank are you as survivor? If also 20 and you found a game fast, it’s just a lot of people playing killer at that time. 
---
its a video game man. rise up to a challenge or dont play at all, dont ruin others fun just because life is hard
---
Jumpscare Myers 
---
Pretty good content
---
You need to leave rank 18.
---
Nurse and leatherface
---
Literally just teleport while holding an instadown
---
Fam I can't imagine how long it must've taken to make this 
---
To be fair, in the rank 2-5 range, I always expect to get stomped whenever I go against a Doctor. His tracking combined with his stalling via madness as well as playing with overly altruistic randos equals a pretty damn annoying killer.
---
I don't DC though; I just realize the match will be absolute torture. 
---
This is so awesome xD
---
I literally imagined a situation in my head like...
---
*Doctor used Thunder Wave!!*  
---
*Claudette is Paralyzed and may be unable to move!*
---
I think it's more a problem with the fact that Legion will never be truly fixed because their power is fundamentally flawed in that it subverts every single game mechanic Survivors have to defend themselves.
---
This is the best thing I've ever seen.
---
True story ! 
---
I ran insidious on doctor and one surviour mistook me as an illusion , she DC'ed after I downed her 
---
So can I buy this ? Please let me buy this and please ship to Japan 
---
If you think the game is worse than it used to be, it's probably because you were a survivor main who liked being completely overpowered, and now you dislike the game because it's actually balanced
---
OP dead I guess so that would be a depip
---
Yup I can get behind this ,playing immersed was the way it was meant to be played and Devs still push this agenda but now you just can't , if you want to get better and if you want to actually escape you can't just hide 
---
He is. They’re my favorite killer. 
---
What did you expect? 
---
Yeah I'm also 20 on survivor
---
People stuck in rank 13 should just git gus. It’s way too easy rank up already so no right to complain. Give me those downvotes but it’s straight facts
---
Legion is close to being fixed if we remove feral frenzy*
---
Nope. People just got good with him. 
---
Getting gen rushed? No problem, just use distressing and beast of prey to get an easy 20k bp in 5 minutes anyway, any bbq stacks are a bonus!
---
You just answered your own question. They are focused on a secondary object while you ignore the secondary objective. Don’t worry after the event ends you will go back to the rank you belong at. 
---
Exactly sloppy butcher definitely supports the don't waste 50 seconds self caring against a Legion strategy for a rented heal you lose the moment he finds you again.
---
Also if you get cute and try and chase me with typical m1 since I'm injured I'll just loop the 110% tortoise until he inevitably gives up and tags my injured ass with ability hit anyways.  Not healing against Legion and rushing solo gens for discordance is easiest way to consistently stomp a Legion.
---
The fire is the campfire that leads you away from all this mess.
---
Try to waste as much of his time as possible and hope the other survivors have brains that can hit m1 and space bar. Then hope they rescue you later.
---
But you see, I don’t care about getting better against legion because I’d rather go play in traffic. So if I DC every game I never have to learn to go against him 
---
I think the movie remake is set for 2020 by the Get Out director so it would get some attention maybe
---
Unless they have blood hound like most legions are just ignore the pallet and follows the blood.
---
I've had that happen, I'll be playing solo and get 2 or 3 actual good randoms and the killer will be like "self trash" and leave.
---
they want to get the event done and over it
---
What lol? For one that’s not at all what it said and two this sub is literally a circle jerk of killers telling each other slugging for a 4K isn’t toxic 
---
Alternate take if you must use self-care, run pharmacy instead, it's faster and you'll have a Metric Tonne of Med-Kits for all your tender medical needs
---
Absolutely.  Same with a cross map Billy chainsaw sprint snipe, huntress snipe throw.
---
"The sole intention to ruin that for others..." Who says anyone has the SOLE intention of ruining anything for anybody.
---
Around the time Legacy skins were added, I looked at the perks I had, which at one time was basically only Sole Survivor, Object of Obsession, and Bond. So I tried to imagine what strategy the game was trying to get me to use. I also had a lot of keys and maps at the time since the other items are used more. What to do: use Bond to acquire 3 Sole Survivor tokens, in order to block Object of Obsession, and leave out the trap door. Given the circumstances, I simply came to a natural conclusion that I believe reflects a *fundamental aspect* of this specific horror game: counter-survivor strategy. 
---
For most people, this is a slice of the game that only kicks in after the match is going poorly: hatch camping. But put yourself in in the circumstances I described. Given that perk progress is unfavorable, and at a time when survivor was much more difficult, my thought process is not a product of animosity for the other players but is actually compelled by the design of the game. The steam store page lists that feature I mentioned as the **first one.** The trap door is essentially an immutable encouragement for survivors to honestly, strategically need their "teammates" to die and it is not griefing. So long as the trap door exists, griefing of this form is pretty difficult to prove.
---
So I really cannot see how this is doing anything outside the boundaries of permissable actions. There are just too many in-game influences that encourage this. I mean heck, even the name of one perk is **"Sole Survivor".** 
---
Now, if someone is honestly just trying to "ruin" the game for others, then that is disappointing and they should be punished. But you know who can do that on the spot? **The killer.** If a survivor is being toxic they are probably not playing smart. In which case, the killer can easily remove the griefer and resume normal play. The other survivors can then choose not to rescue the griefer. If the killer decides not to do this and instead takes advantage of the griefer or teams up with them, then **the killer should be reported.** A survivor who is able to get a killer to act passively toward them, on the other hand, is not actually responsible for anything the killer does. When a friendly BP-farming killer is letting you farm generators and hooks, and you do it, should you be reported? no, that makes no sense. It is really the killer who is responsible for this because he wields the ability to progress the game by attacking a player, or not.
---
In this clip, the huntress could have solved this by attacking the Dwight instead of David. And for all we know the Dwight may have just been confused, thinking he was about to be hit any second and raging at David for not getting out of the way. If the Huntress had just walked around the other side of the tree, the Dwight would be dead and this post would be called "David is actually a killer".
---
You're not really proving anything besides what I said really. You're completely willing to put your fellow survivors at a disadvantage like that because you don't wanna put in the time to learn how to go up against a killer?
---
That just makes you an asshole really, try and defend it all you want but I've yet to see a single person be less effective than a guy who AFKs, disconnects or suicides at the very start of a match. I'd rather have a facecamping or tunneling killer than you in the match. Or NOED. Or a surv with DS, Adrenaline and Self-Care + Dead Hard...
---
Or...Anyone who's at least up for playing the game really. Least I can learn, earn BP and have fun that way.
---
But that will only be an issue for the first few weeks. After that, all the sweaty players will congregate to rank 1 slowly and stay there. No reason to derank on purpose.
---
God dammit Jay
---
He’s a basic m1 killer that has a lot of ways to be cheesed by a good survivor group because of how his power works. Most of the time he’s fine but there are a lot of situations where he just won’t be able to react to what survivors are doing because he has to wait for them to fall asleep before doing anything to them. Also worth mentioning is that he’s got the dream world filter over everything all the time that might make finding people and navigating harder for you if you already have trouble seeing. 
---
I think you're misunderstanding why the community endlessly shits on legion. People don't hate Legion because they think he's OP. People hate Legion because he's somehow even less interactive to play against than Nurse. Legion's skill ceiling is somewhere around "ankle sock" level, and his power removes all survivor skill from the equation by countering pretty much all the things survivors do to drag out chases and avoid hits. Getting chased by Legion is about as interesting as holding M1 on a generator.
---
And yes, the hilarious truth is despite all of that, he's still actually one of the weakest killers in the game. Legion basically gets unpreventable downs on a clockwork timer, but that timer is still long enough that he's actually bad. Without Frank's or moonchasing, he is without any doubt in my mind the worst killer in the game. With Frank's and/or moonchasing, he's probably somewhere mid-tier.
---
Run no perks and don’t use your power 
---
You fly through ranks 20-15. You fly through ranks 12 to 1. Ranks 15-12 is a prison.
---
Poison + Fairy fits the Clown so much.
---
That makes no sense, if you’re somewhat good at the game you get a pip every game on average
---
Repost.
---
Gorgos was probably in a SWF with the other two, and they don't care if they make the game unfun for other players.
---
Maybe don’t play legion if you don’t want people to dc
---
How is the Hillbilly the weakest character in-game?
---
Well he can't camp because the moment you unhook the person he has to wait I think 6 or 7 idk seconds until he can attack. Yes he is invisible but you can see the grass.
---
It's not hard to win against Freddy.
---
What even is that weapon? A stick?
---
Oh god so first everyone DC's when it's a legon and now doctor? What's next every fucking killer? 
---
You don't escape a Legion, you just loop them. if the killer is braindead (which most Legions are) you just loop them at pallets for a good minute or two.
---
t. eternal rank 15
---
yep
---
Their ability to consistently 4k is very low, just like Freddy, but their ability to make any chosen survivor have 0 fun is very high
---
End of game based on final points total.  4 tokens = Survivor Cake.  Body blocks, flashlight and pallet saves count too. 
---
It’s weird bc I literally have no problems whatsoever finding a match? (PS4)
---
kinda appropriate huh?
---
Please spread this mentality. This is exactly how I get my 3-4 man kills every game. They don’t heal, they try to solo gens and they can’t hide because no one runs Iron Will. It’s basically playing stab time until I feel like downing people. Also the most underrated addon is Fuming Mix Tape because I can see the generators by their color progression. Also I don’t know why people think the 5% difference means I won’t run them down. Most people I encounter in red ranks can’t even loop properly and the ones who can I’ll just keep tagging them with frenzy until they leave the loop. 
---
Just tell everyone the worst advise. Don’t heal, and pretend to loop. I /promise/ it works. 
---
I love this meme 
---
Yeah thought of it too I will try it tomorrow if it's still not there.
---
Atleast you gettin event progress
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
"Maybe if I stay in this fire for a few more moments..."
---
Having that flair, you're secretly a spy planted by the killers to get information from the campfire.
---
I think it's more that a Doctor who knows what he's doing can legit hold the game hostage for an hour with a good 3 gen, something almost no other killer is capable of doing. Doctor also doesn't even need to hit you to prevent gens, he can simply shock into madness 3. I don't like to DC, but if I ever get another Doctor holding us hostage on a good 3 gen on Haddonfield, you bet your ass I'm leaving the game 
---
That's what you deserve for playing legion
---
I completely understand. But my point is, if you deserve to get out of those ranks you will, because in this ranking system it’s way too easy
---
HybridPanda - he plays a bit of everything (survivor AND killer)  so there aren’t tutorials specific to certain characters, but you can pick up a lot of tips and tricks that can apply to a majority of DBD characters while watching him play. 
---
That’s only a rumour, I won’t tell you
---
Ah that’s pretty sweet, thanks!
---
sloppy toppy lmaooo
---
Lol dude me and my friends get 3 out vs. your Legion players consistently with that strat.  I can't speak for potatoes but that 5% makes a lot of difference if you know how to loop which you should be able to at red ranks.  And if you tag me with your ability naturally I don't just stay at same loop.  I will run across map to next area.  You will get your third brainless ability hit on me eventually but at that point you've wasted a lot of time for my teamates to repair gens.  That is the easiest counterplay to Legion bro but you can encourage potatoes to waste 50 seconds a pop not working on gens and healing themselves while you pick them off like flys 1 by 1 since noone is doing the gens.
---
As a Myers main, the most satisfying thing is finding a subtle little nook to peek at the gen from, get to Tier 2, wait about 1.5 seconds, then watch one by one as the survivors start booking it away, realizing that I've been there the whole time. &gt;:P 
---
I think it was the get downed only once in the whole game and escape x50 or so achievement that wouldn't count the points towards the achievement for me, and suddenly they were being added a few matches later where I was pretty sure I got downed more than once.  Don't think too much of it, maybe it refreshes every few matches or something like that.
---
Thats not anywhere close to equal
---
you might be right
---
Are you a SWF group?  That is the most common reason killers leave.  Otherwise the only reason I know I quit is if a player(s) has just horrible ping.
---
So true
---
there can be bugged parts in the game where someone is basically falling and the animation can look like jumping.
---
Chad Leatherface &gt; Billy
---
Thank you very much for the fast reply. Have a great one! :)
---
It’s just me and my other friend.  So, it’s Just the two of us and we’re very different ranks too 🤷‍♀️ 
---
Sure thing max boldness from basement time survivor.
---
I know I will, it just is slower and a shitshow every single match. A pain in the ass.
---
It sucks when that happens but this event I’ve just been letting people escape and farm points with em when it happens...even when it doesn’t tho cause I hate this event and only want to save BP for when those crappy envelopes disappear I can use em all. Bing bong the friendly wraith!
---
We need some cat ears skin for The Spirit. Maybe if you draw it, the devs are going to get the motivation.
---
BigBrickyPlays has some good Spirit and Myers gameplays, I am unsure if he streams. He has made some very small guides (up until the clown, so no legion or spirit) and a very detailed guide on the Doctor. Overall very enjoyable, just don't get blinded by the forehead tho.
---
To be fair, that's the same for every killer. As any killer I can just camp the first person I downed, and they get to stare at my killer abs for the rest of the game with no gameplay allowed except hammering the space button for struggle phase.
---
Cool.
---
seriously!!!! survivor mains are terrribblllleeeee 
---
Like 30-40% of my games? It really depends on the killer and the map.
---
My fun build is - Diversion, Pharmacy, Ace In The Hole, Dead Heard
---
My tryhard build is - Iron Will, Calm Spirit, Lithe, Dance With Me
---
The thing is, if I forged a camaraderie with them I assume they don’t want me to die, but I will scout the area to see if a save is possible.  If they are in the basement and we’re against Leatherface then imma Hex: Hit That Yeet.
---
Even the camera is keeping it's distance.
---
I originally was going to put the wraith, trapper, and the hag, but I went online and found forums that had multiple people and these three seemed to be the highest ranked lol
---
I agree with this a lot. I'm a survivor main, at least for the time being, and when I play killer I want to round out my skill set to truly enjoy the game in its entirety, sometimes I play Legion, just to get a feel for it, maybe even to learn what frustrates me so I can implement similar strats I see solid experienced survivors employ.
---
I honestly dislike playing against Legions, but I still try to have fun and hang in there, but it's really disheartening when players DC the minute they know Legion is the killer. I've thrown games as Legion, and let survivors pip because it just becomes too often that teams that want to play get screwed by DCs.
---
go to the appdata and you can change it from there
---
I mean like there was no falling spot it was on solid flat ground on the map for the wraith
---
Meanwhile I had one with two DCs and the Hag just let us farm up (after we both let 'em hook us twice and I ran through all the traps).  It was still relatively short but we all benefited from it. 
---
What happened after this? Did you die or escape? 
---
First thing I tried. Changed nothing
---
You can still farm and keep it short in that situation.  If they linger too long then just kill them.
---
This is the build which carried my mediocre ass to rank 1, solo build:
---
1 healing perk - Self Care: pretty self explanatory, there are situations where you just can't rely on others to heal you and since we are talking about solo, you can't coordinate your healing with others and sometimes reckless healing from your mates can get you killed.
---
1 vision perk - Spine Chill: due to the increased number of stealthy Killers, this improves your survival a lot, triggers before the heartbeat starts giving you that little extra time to react, also tremendously helps on risky gens where your  line of sight is blocked by walls, slightly increases vaulting speed (although not mentioned in description but proven), which can be a difference between hit and no-hit. 
---
1 evasive perk - Sprint Burst: although you have to walk everywhere to avoid randomly triggering it, you can control when to activate it, all the other exhaust perks heavily rely on environment and/or very situational like Dead Hard, SB is also the easiest to use and works well with Spine Chill in most situations where there are no high ground or vaults.
---
1 teammate perk - Kindred: very underrated perk, look at it as an insurance as a solo player, you may not need it, but when you get hooked your teammates don't have to rely on having the right assumptions to decide when to go for the unhook, countless time I went to struggling phase only because all my teammates assumed somebody is already went to get me, which never happened or everybody went for the unhook because assumed gen rush, which is equally bad.
---
Tracks it my ass. If that was true we wouldn’t have so many people d/cing all the time. 
---
Not to mention if you evade them you cannot hide since you are forced to mend, which gives them time to find you since you're stuck in one place. Or if you evade and the chase breaks the timer ticks down which means that they can just use their power and down you.
---
You are punished no matter what
---
Nurse has to be Ghost and Flying. 
---
If you DC too often, you get banned. Meaning they track it.
---
To infinity AND BEYOND!!!
---
do you have a gpu and a cpu or just a cpu? 
---
Okay, Serious question. I know it';s mainly a meme now, but what is the issue with legion?
---
Except it's actually possible to loop other killers besides Nurse (yes even Billy Spirit etc). Whereas Legion cannot be stopped by pallets or windows, makes the chase non-interactive to where I basically have to get lucky and hide after they hit me and hope they're stupid enough to lose me. Not really fun
---
Doesn’t make up for the loss of a player by any means. 
---
My gf is tryting to play the game, he bougth it long agoo but barely played it, she is rank 20, she have played several match of survivor with us, but once she tries to play killer she never gets a match, she is waiting for several hours in the lobby (exit the game several times) but no one survivor has ever popped up.
---
what can we do? (The issue is on PC)
---
Stab straight down into back of skull and I'm in
---
Agreed. I don't know why the downvotes because the killer can't have got many points that match either. :/
---
&gt;You may have a good game on PC.
---
B E T
---
*checks upvotes* clearly not a more killer based sub and clearly wasn’t a post solely made for gaining upvotes. 
---
I feel like Amanda should also have Steel because of the traps
---
I'm Loving these bird memes.
---
Oh nice 
---
&gt;Franklin's mix tape is basically Insta down. Or the no cooldown bullshit.
---
JFC. This is the biggest pile of bullshit I've ever seen someone try and shove on this sub. Frank's requires 3 hits. The first 2 *alone* take longer to accomplish than a single M1 from an actual insta-down. Then they still have to do a cool down and chase you again. At 110% until they recharge. Frank's just makes Frenzy about as fast as a standard 115 Killer M1ing you. It's not even remotely close to an insta-down.
---
&gt;Also he ignores windows too you know.
---
Show me a Legion getting g through a window without vaulting it. Go on, I'm waiting.
---
I mean the combined rank is 15.2 so it ain’t bad at all. 
---
This is why I never play Survivor anymore. Legion is that fucking dumb. 
---
andmyteammatesareevendumber
---
Again, artard, an SWF squad can gen rush even Nurse. It's been proven many times over in both the E-Sports tournament and with Marth's Fuccboi squad. Live in your own reality, asshole. 
---
Its a made up rule survivors have. 
---
No, people just refuse to adapt to him and don't know how to play if they can't rely on a single mechanic to save them all the time.
---
Can confirm. Just made it to red ranks yesterday and have no idea how to loop or win chases aside from getting lucky. 
---
400 ping 
---
So is worge only for the sub rather than forums.
---
Spirit theoretically has a nigh unlimited skill cap, due to reading the actions and mindgames.
---
Nurse is just powerful as fuck but if you fuck up a few times you are utterly fucked, not to mention dead zones
---
But going invisible and even being able to fake it out with the husk, so much depth.
---
Same issue with Nurse, but at least when playing against Nurse it requires the Nurse to actually be skilled at predicting player movement 
---
(or having enough extra blinks, hurdur).  Also good Nurses pretty much end the game in 5 minutes compared to Legion where it still takes a long while.  
---
I don’t play on PC so I can’t speak on it 
---
No one cares about that child molesting shit stain.
---
I guess maybe I meant \*rank\* 3?  The system in which the lower the number, the higher the rank you are.
---
Killers figured at ways to make him semi decent, Survivors refuse to learn how to counter him.
---
I'm so paranoid when it's Myers because of that I'm constantly rotating the camera like it's a game of Where's Wally xD
---
&gt; Lettuce Hag
---
Do you mean Alolan Hag?
---
The only thing annoying about going against Freddy imo is teammates who are scared shitless to do anything because they can’t see him or one with his best add ons. Other than that he’s just an M1 killer that has to waste the beginning of a chase putting you to sleep 
---
This is fucking sick no cap
---
Huntress should be fairy type. Otherwise fine
---
The vine is called "How to deal with bad guys" in case anyone needs context
---
He hurls sparkly powder and mist at his enemies
---
If you think not healing is gonna help, by all means, do so. The best counter is having perks ready ahead of time to keep yourself hidden so you can try to stealth around in peace. I won’t try to convince you to change what you do and truthfully I don’t want to. People who play like that are the easiest targets because they bunk I’m going to tunnel or expect me to respect pallets and it becomes their downfall, especially when you learn how to herd people into unsafe zones. Have fun out there in the fog. ❤️
---
lol Legion.
---
It's meant to stop campers, but most people use it to just insta save people for free points, which puts the hooked person in a bad situation. 
---
It may not be toxic to the killer anymore, but it's toxic to their teammates
---
Idk about toxic but it was crazyyyyy strong at one point (one buff and one nerf ago)
---
this is a disgrace to the good name of fairy types 
---
It is really tough but personally I've been grinding to avoid encouraging BHVR to release really grindy events in the future. This is just typical dev behavior to try and strong arm your wallet out of your pocket. 
---
Rank reset is always on the 13th of each month.
---
Well one problem is that if 4 survivors get in and one leaves, it bugs the lobby out so either a survivor or the killer needs to leave. Just one example. Do you have flashlights by any chance? 
---
The spirit is secretly waluigi because they both waah
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
Dont camp then.
---
I got 4 on day one, got one more the next day then stopped cause that's all I needed, some grind huh. 
---
Do you know how easy it is during events to rank up as killers? No one does obj. 
---
Thanks! I get too stressed playing Killer, so I usually avoid doing it. I just had to get that Rank 1 taste at least once!
---
Try Doctor, Nurse's Calling, Bloodhound, you know.
---
I’ve got a clip of a flying nea somewhere 
---
Legion players are the type of people to tunnel a person through 5 gens and disconnect after seeing they were the only person who brought Adrenaline
---
Haha fair. The highest I’ve gotten is rank 6 and I’m a killer main
---
That was an Esports competition (one that’s infamous for being stupid and practically ruined the credibility of space esports anyways) and and a squad of extremely coordinated and competitive players that went up against random people (who were not at all aware they were playing a death squad) with the intent to rush the hell out of them to prove a point. Those nurses were random people that weren’t nearly on level with Marth’s squad, not Ardetha or Zubat.
---
You run into people like that in normal matchmaking maybe 1/1000 matches, so if you’re getting genrushed on nurse or billy then it’s your fault not the games fault. You can live in your own reality where you’re an amazing player and when you lose it’s not your fault, but not being able to accept that you aren’t the best and that you need to improve is the reason why you’re struggling so much. Quite ironic that you’re called me an “artard” after all the sense that multiple people have tried to talk into you.
---
It’s not that hard to walk backwards, if there’s only one place a pallet is going to be for them you know they won’t go anywhere else, even if they do you can just cop a peek to see where the scratches are heading towards
---
When 3 people DC but you still gotta kill that one guy- oh and there's the noed of course why am I not surprised!! 
---
Was the timer super long or something? I know they just “nerfed” it to deep wound. 
---
I’ve heard that BHVR implemented a matchmaking system where everyone joins at the same time sometimes, but the devs get paid to code not to do psychology so they missed the part where people don’t care and will back out until everyone joins one by one or the group looks newbie enough. 
---
Swf still gets dodged but congrats now randoms get dodged just as often lol
---
Seriously why is it taking 10-30 min to find a single game? Im trying to play with a couple friends but they leave after 20min of waiting and no match. Its really annoying
---
Hag and clown set traps that just gas the fuck outta people
---
Sike the hook doesn’t work
---
Don't get unhooked.
---
The majority of games are SWF period. I believe bhvr said 90 percent are at least 2 man. If anything more teams are SWF than killers think.
---
I'm lost. How come when legion first came out we all said he was trash, and now people are DCing against him? I'm out of the loop. 
---
Imagine spending time on a post just to make fun of a large group of people.
---
Same, thought he was the worst killer
---
*screams and stares at hands*
---
Leatherface for me
---
Ok, I'm smiling. This is some good posting 👍
---
It only works on the occasion that it is actually spawned in. And not just acting like it's spawned in
---
i grabbed Ace's look because i have him with every perk in the game (him and Meg are my mains). but the thought of spending +30 hours grinding for the rest really put me off.
---
Sweaty players aren’t the problem, it’s the toxic ones.
---
I think you dropped your /s, sir.
---
What's up with the pumpkin moth Navi thing?
---
If they were to choose between the two chucky's they have to do the one that was from the Don Mancini canon that uses voodoo. They can explain away why he can put the survivors on a hook. 
---
If not they can always have him do a special kind a sacrifice, where instead of hooking them. He lays them down to sacrifice their souls ala the first three Child's Play. 
---
It'd be cool, I can't even imagine the power he'd have since I'm not so familiar with the movies, plus he's short so
---
Weird, I’ve had it like 4 times (more actually but only tried to hook in 4 matches) and it’s never worked but I guess I’ve just been unlucky
---
I'm just grinding the points and whatever I'm short in, I'll just buy the rest.  I just need 3 more to buy my last cosmetic 
---
If everyone grinds instead of buying, wouldn't that just give them more incentive to increase the grind? But if the store works as expected, there would be no reason for them to make it grindier 
---
He is tho. It does’t mean you can’t do good with him.
---
For your sake it better does.
---
Good frame rate 
---
Yeah is weird. The best part is when it does work if it gets broken it shows it leaning over as if it was broken but it has a hook attached to it
---
I rarely find someone play as legion (PS4)
---
Congrats! Nice accomplishment 
---
...The killer couldn't have known bruh
---
Maybe one day, my fellow Killers will stop being babies and quit dodging 4-mans and running NOED.
---
And to think my internet connection went down on the 6th and only came back today. I was just 3 pips away from Rank 1 and I thought I wasn't gonna be able to do it before the rank reset because I had no internet!
---
Imagine saying this unironically. 
---
HHAHAHA I ENJOY THIS AS A HUNTRESS MAIN
---
^This, and it’s not just certain killers as well, it’s literally anything that’s difficult to deal with at first. Killer or survivor, if you drop rank because you don’t like playing against something and want to have fun then fine I respect that but you can’t call yourself good or give credible input about balance. 
---
I agree that legion with franks mixtape is stupid powerful and allows you to win with much less effort than normal, but so is swf, and when you play enough you learn how to handle them a bit better. Doesn’t mean they’re magically easy to go against but it definitely ain’t impossible.
---
No, it happened to me on numerous occoasions. Some killers love to DC to waste your offerings.
---
The truth is, if he is played how he was intended he is weakest killer. How was he intended? Hitting a survivor using blood frenzy to find another hitting etc.. he is designed as a keep everyone injured and not doing gens.
---
Some people have found other ways to use hin, using things like sloppy butcher and then running backwards following the trail u til you drop. You see when you are in chase your mend bar doesnt drop but when not in chase it drops fast.
---
So by running backwards following the blood you can effectively not be in chase mode and they cant stop to heal the bleeding.
---
This resulting in your death.
---
You see offerings before loading. First time DBD ?
---
Fun fact, the zap attack is caused by millions of bugs in the entities realm frying the ground due to overheating, the entity just passed it off as a "feature" and made doc happy
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Aww yeah 
---
I'd love to see that. Billy/LF charging up their chainsaw, spinning in circles, then going at chainsaw sprint speed while being able to turn well. And instead of entering a tantrum or getting stunned upon hitting a wall, they just bounce off and keep going.
---
No they’d see it during the loading screen. The reason I find this hard to believe is what dumbass would disconnect after seeing a party streamer 
---
Rank 1 just takes more time than skill. Safety pipping is VERY easy to do. This goes for both sides 
---
Please enlighten us on how to adapt to him? Running away is the only thing you can do, all legions run sloppy butcher there isnt a way to really outplay him.
---

---
In honesty i was typing high af. I was more angry about shitty server times, to be more clear!
---
To be fair, you still have to learn how to chase efficiently as nurse, it’s just a totally different set of ropes you gotta learn
---
"Wow it's cold outside where's this global warming" same energy btw
---
I already stated in another post that *I do not care* about the Achievement. The fact that I have over 400+ Hours in DbD and havent ever even gotten to chance to get that Achievement due to salty Survivors disconnecting on purpose is what annoys me. And then immediately followed after are comments that I should kill myself, or other homophobic slangs.
---
Toxicity is such an issue in this game for literally no reason. Survivors will purposefully bully/harass/annoy/send death threats to Killers, and vice versa. This type of thing needs to not be taken so lightly, considering telling people to kill themselves is viewed as a crime in some places. The disrespect and horrible things I've read in post-chat doesn't belong in Dead By Daylight, or any game for that matter.
---
Instead of focusing on how I'm "lying" about my Rank, or complaining about a mori, why don't you open your mind and see the bigger picture here that needs to be dealt with?
---
Come and talk to us in with a hundred hours gameplay under your belt dude. You'll see lol
---
This is just too much. Too confusing, too all over the place. Seems like you're trying to add a dozen passive perks into 1 killer 
---
Carried by perks and addons.
---
This sparks so much joy in my heart... thank you
---
You forgot Nea.
---
(Please don't downvote, I know the meme is dead).
---
Because it’s not just a 4K, my Freddy is P3 *level 5*, and slew multi-purples with only two first rank perks.
---
If the toxic players are good then they will naturally rank up. If they are bad... then just kill them.
---
Wait times are long at 19 and 20 (like, potentially 10-20 minutes). Once you get past that, it speeds up quite a bit. 
---
Thank you for demonstrating exactly what I was talking about.
---
Thanks for the detailed info.
---
I mostly do that too. This post isn't meant to complain about me not being able to 4K all the time, or that I'm bad at the Game. The fact that I can play this game casually and recieve death threats, suicide-encouragement and shit like that is beyond okay.
---
With an outclassed ratio of full builds to my level 5, still stomped em.
---
Ah man, getting my ankles stabbed sounds nice.
---
In reality, he'd probably be a creepy killer. Unfortunately there's no way that little guy would be able to put survivors on the hook. Cool concept though.
---
Same here. Happens 3/10 times but it's annoying af, since I have to close the game in the taskbmanager and have to restart it.
---
I did the same multiple times with my lv 5 Freedy at rank 1. Really it's nothing impressive all depends on survivors you get.
---
Ok, I understand now. Thanks!
---
***Unzipping noises*** /s
---
That's 16:9 aspect ratio and wouldn't be affected by FOV changes.
---
Guess who care about that. I will show you list of them.
---
-
---
See? Nobody 
---
Carried by yellows and greys? Lmao!
---
They will drop rank tho that’s the variable you’re missing, they’re toxic. You have your overly competitive people but the kind of toxic that majorly plagues this game is just people trying to bully less skilled people and be a general ass.
---
This is perfection.
---
I'm still waiting for you to tell us how he is to be countered? You gen rush and hope 2 ppl survivor is the only way to get out in my experience so far.
---
fredboi wont let quentin sleep ;(
---
I don't think there's a streamer that mains either of those. Salgu plays Meyers like 1/4 of the time but is Korean so wouldn't be giving tips in English. I imagine spirit main streamers are mostly just bitching about footsteps right now.
---
**Back at the Basement:**
---
"... And then she called me a Dingus, I dont even know anymore..."
---
In my experience it’s less about the points and more about “this game is scuffed, time to move on to the next one”. I’ve been in that situation as survivor and went to go die immediately

---
It's not about his ability to get a 4k, but about the probability he will get one compared to the other killers.
---
You're so good man wow
---
Electricity messes with your mind?

Thanks, i didnt got this issue when i started playing long ago.
---
One day she will be able to play, hope it actually speeds up if a wild match appears at last.
---
&gt; This seems like a game that a mature person couldn't possibly take seriously
---
What do you mean?
---
Howdy!
---
are u mentally challenged?
---
Legion is terrible at getting more than 2 kills, but thrives in matches where people disconnect and there are still 5 gens to do. A lot of people talk about how there's zero interaction, but never mention that hitting the legion with a pallet instantly ends the frenzy, giving you plenty of time to get to the next looping point where you can clap them once more
---
Oh yeah, it's real
---
Well, I am by no means whatsoever some expert Killer or anything like that, but I can share my build with you :)
---
I use Thanatophobia, BBQ&amp;C, Ruin and NOED on my Spirit. It's a pretty neutral strategy, allowing you to defend and attack equally. I used to have Make Your Choice instead of Thanatophobia, but then my build was too aggressive and sometimes it became hard to defend the generators. Haunted Grounds isn't bad either, but it's better to combine it with another Hex perk to make it 3 Hex totems and force the survivors to take the risk. 
---
Distressing can be a good one too. Bigger terror radius = higher chances of no phasing audio cue for survivors. You could catch them some off guard using that (or the add-on for removing the 'woosh' completely), but I find it better to leave the woosh as it is, since survivors outside your TR can hear it and chances are they'll back away from the gens once you start phasing, so even if you're not coming for them, you're still keeping them away from gens, which is good.
---
In the end, it's all about finding your balance. The Spirit is a great Killer and can put on a lot of pressure on survivors, but it's important to know when and how to use your power, otherwise they will run you around for 2,3 gens and your game will be pretty much over. For matches like those, I got my NOED to lend me a hand :P
---
It's that he's not fun to play against and almost everyone who plays him uses the exploit. 
---
Missed opportunity for Amanda to be steel as well, considering the heavily brutal and metallic design of many Saw traps.
---
Don’t really see Clown as fairy, I’d say more psychic-poison; more mindbendingly negative
---
Otherwise this is hella cool
---
Perhaps more emphasis on getting everyone hooked at least once would help?
---
"Hes just staring at me...menacingly"
---
It was buffed a few patches back.
---
The work of art I see 
---
Couldn’t even spell you’re right
---
Well for one, it's a game. Two, its a game about being a slasher killer.
---
Just as a note, they may not have left them on the ground just to frustrate people. There are perks on both sides, killer and survivor, that benefit from that. You can visit the wiki and read up on perks if you feel like someone is acting weird or something isn't behaving correctly. That's usually the cause.
---
While there is more problems to Legion than just the moonwalk, this very closely captures the reaction of everyone to people who try to think of ways to fix him. Realistic ways that the Dev might actually implement.
---
I once got called a baby killer because I was playing distressing Freddy
---
They called distressing a crutch perk
---
On Freddy
---
????????
---
A Fate/Prisma Illya meme was like the absolute *last* thing I would've expected to see on this sub.
---
Not that I mind tho. It's a decent show once you get far enough into it.
---
While it is your job re: sacrificing, it's very frustrating on the survivor end to get less chances and spend most of your game hopelessly hanging from a hook, sometimes its hard enough when solo queueing to get someone to unhook you. 
---
I started off as a survivor and there was nothing worse than being camped or chased all game until death, as a killer I refuse to do it now, and I still manage 4k most games. You're also giving them an advantage at times if they aren't cowardly because survivors like me will do gens if there's a killer staying in one spot. I'm sure the more you'll play you will branch out and be less reliant, its honestly way more fun to do chases imo.
---
I do agree some reactions are immature, though. Both sides have it but sometimes one just has to work through it, at least the games are short.
---
Well, running NOED only works if a totem remains to activate ;)
---
This is what’s confusing me - it can be both. Why are you forcing a dichotomy?
---
That's the way. I don't know why I'm getting downvoted tho.
---
Can confirm it's Prisma Illya. Only that show would boast Yuri lolis in the first season(s)
---
I agree but you’re asking why there’s toxicity and I believe that’s why. It’s a game and people want to win so they will be competitive. The toxicity is just because of immature people that can’t handle losing 
---
Good to know, though this particular killer seemed to be attacking random objects while carrying me around.
---
Iron will and dead hard
---
Noed counter: cleanse dull totems 
---
You’re welcome friend 👉😎👉

Why should I waste my time when you've clearly already ignored [some good tips someone else made] (https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aorqsi/this_event_is_top_notch/eg3atls) right in this very thread, yet again proving my point?
---
Daddy David 😩👄
---
Thanks! Will try it out :) I think stridor can work really well. What do you think? 
---
that's fucking amazing ... we are in 2019, and this game is full of bug and strangeness more than skyrim or any older game that were full of these things ... honestly i don't get it !!! Fallout 4, Just Cause 3, Skyrim, Mafia 3 ... all this big games, except major bugs (but they are open world games with a lot of quest and mission, so it is normal), haven't this fucking problem in their main menus ... DbD have all this things. Even the 60 FPS (Only in the store 😉)
---
I miss being the most hated
---
This right here is why the community is so toxic. Don’t like to play against something? Just dc and screw everyone else over...It’s a game, just try...no one that matters is going to think less of you for just playing even if you think it’s hopeless. If you dc you should just uninstall and do everyone else playing a favor ya scumbag 
---
It really do be like that sometimes
---
lol so true though!
---
I mean  wouldn’t swapping deep wounds with someone else make him bearable? Like an action speed debuff that can’t be self cleansed. Increase his power duration, maybe reduce his speed. Give incentive to spread the debuff to other survivors like he was designed for.
---
Yes! I wanted to give Stridor a go, but I never had the chance to. Hearing the Survivors breathe is extremely important while phase walking, along with being able to follow scratch marks (which I admittedly kind of suck at doing). So yeah, Stridor would be great for the Spirit. Predator too, if you're like me :P
---
My thing would be alot of the maps have grass thats taller than him. So he'd basically be very hard to stalk and track without him just popping out. It would probably be more terrifying to me than any killer we have. 
---
I don't think anyone is complaining about this, camping is literally not moving a single fucking inch and just staring at the hooked survivor. OR staring at the hooked survivor and walking around 3 meters away swaying back and forth.
---
People complain too much about DS.  I cannot remember the last time I saw it used and the survivor did not just get downed again 10 seconds later.
---
He isn't doing anything special in this clip...?
---
How would he pick them up though? He would have to drag people around to hook them. It seems a little more complicated than i thought. He would need special accommodations. 
---
maybe you only tunneled him and camped that is why he only has 11k points and the others used the event thing and those points are showing on scoreboard
---
Ah yes as I said.. run him around for as long as possible. Great strategy. The counter is to run away and not be able to hide. 
---
I'm done talking to you. 
---
Calm down it’s just a perk. Eat the DS and move on, cleanse the totems and you won’t have a reason to cry. 
---
Nah Nurse is just a Ghost type with the Levitate ability
---
That makes sense, Myers is soulless so he's dark on the inside.
---
Dam
---
It knows
---
Removed - Shaming other players &amp; no salty messages of any kind
---
His mouth opens like an inch.
---
No perk is toxic, they’re bloody perks. There are a number of efficient soft counters for DS and you can just cleanse totems if you’re sick of NOED. 
---
If people wanna be toxic they’ll be toxic but using in game mechanics as intended is not toxic.
---
LOL, funny. I DC as soon as I see the killer is legion. It literally makes no difference if they moonwalk, use franks mixtape or not. 
---
Imagine still not understanding the problem with legion isn’t that he’s strong, it’s that he sucks all the fun out of the game. Playing vs legion is like Shaq playing 1v1 vs a 5 year old. Sure it’s not hard to win, but it’s fucking boring 
---
Uhm... trapper gets the fancy dress? #JusticeForNurse
---
Barley viable? Unless your. in a swf group you’re not going to find all 5 totems and unless your running enduring (alot of killers don’t like huntress, nurse, spirit, ect.) then that DS can start up a whole other chasing wasting more of ur time.
---
The fact I had to read this must just to counter this one killer shows how much of a drag Legion is to play against. Good tips!
---
Yeah, anyone can use the final panel if they wanna make their own three panel shitpost, consider the final panel a template. :) 
---
Agreed which is another reason I think the locker change is ridiculous.  It makes killers with BBQ still think of it in terms of the survivors being close enough to hook when in actuality they're just counter playing it in a locker cross map.  
---
I’m wasting my time attempting to reason with you aren’t I. 
---
This image makes me feel things that confuse me.
---
It’s the same reason why people take sports so seriously. Also, I have no clue why humans are dicks.
---
Rank 20 Devs. They haven't played on Console, I've seen multiple times on the forums a Dev saying that they can't make changes to either side because they don't want to create 2 separate games. REALLY?! Besides the game being buggy....
---
1. The Sensitivity is nowhere near as good as PC, can we possibly have a higher movement sensitivity please? It's another reason why Nurse isn't a God on Console.
---
2. Frame rate issues. 20 FPS on Survivor side and 21 FPS on Killer side.
---
3. Sensitivity on Nurse is ass, complete ass, can't even port backwards like on PC.
---
4. Freddy Frame Rate is ass.
---
5. Why can't you turn the characters like you can on PC, you can't even look at clothing the right way because you somehow can't even look at the back on Console.
---
6. Why is Cursor sensitivity on console so slow in the Bloodweb?
---
I feel like movement is so fucking slow on Console compared to PC.
---
It’ll take you 160 seconds to find and destroy all totems (assuming that it takes roughly 20 secs to find each totem). 160 secs isnt “easy”
---
Ahhhh I see it 0:04 - 0:06 such a cute sleppy boii. 
---
The devs started with having shorts underneath, to having the Spirit's schoolgirl outfit, and now this. The devs know what we want. ;)
---
I am “Gud”. Legion is easy as fuck to escape vs, doesn’t mean it’s not the most cancerous and stretched out game possible. Playing legion is a cunt move on the same level of 4 man swf genrushing with toolboxes 
---
I showed you the math. You’re the unreasonable one
---
I didn’t read pass the different members spawn in lockers part. You tryna tell me I have to come out and be in the closet? Smh
---
Have a good night bud. 
---
You need to DC 20% of total matches to get a temp ban.
---
LOL you're 1000 hours late!
---
Love that too...”oh shit, it’s Myers and he just got tier 2...oh shit, he right there”
---
I like you. 
---
He is really good at lower ranks. He is debatable the worst killer as u get to higher ranks. He is hard to play because of his inability to finish chases threw loops and makes or really hard to fight good survivors. 
---
Pretty much.  Legion requires little skill yet gets to ignore obstacles like the Nurse.  His power simultaneously encourages attacking everyone and tunneling like crazy.  It makes it near impossible to actually "lose" a chase as a Legion.  That's why his power requires him to have a long "timer", otherwise he'd be too powerful.  
---
Most survivors want the game served to them on a silver platter and Freddy makes them abandon standard gameplay a bit
---
For Killers, he has some viability issues
---
I have been banned 3 times for DCing sweetheart

---
You are recommending stealth play against a killer whose ability literally allows him to see everyone in his radius....there is no hiding from a Legion especially with distressing or monitor on so many of them. 
---
Ahhhh so he is bad to play as against higher level survivors?
---
1022h? How often do you play killer? I don’t mean to sound like a dick but if that’s all killer that’s not an accomplishment.
---
Legion, facecamping, hard tunneling, sandbagging your team, and hiding in the map after the gates are open for no reason
---
I personally just don't enjoy playing against LF. He's definitely up there in least favourites to play against. He's the only killer in the game that genuinely freaks me out with his noises, and more often than not, when I go against them they're running NoED. Which is probably my least favourite perk to play against ngl.
---
And I’m showing you it can be done with a crippled Freddy. It’s not him, it’s the players.

Continues doing Genny 
---
Hehe
---
I didn’t know Trump could 4K.
---
Don't worry about it was funny pic btw lol
---
Because bad players need DS. A good player with DS is a nightmare.
---
Thanks
---
Oh ok, thanks for sorting by new i guess.
---
Burger King Myers 
---
He needs to be a skin for every character lmao
---
Except when you get into the corn and your frames die on you
---
I love comedy. Calling someone a dumbass doesnt fall in comedy buddy. It falls under the category of being a dick. And how you called me a dumbass it doesnt seem like you were joking with your "friend"
---
You know a lot of killers are dicks too lol
---
Jesus Christ. This is crazy. You can’t play the game and tell people on Reddit that you can’t play it so they proceed to downvote the shit out of your post for being a Legion main and having noed. They also downvote the spelling of your fucking name. I don’t even know what to say anymore.
---
The more I look at this the more confused I get.
---
Well if you are on steam you can
---
Hey! MW here. I drew this fan art for the Pig mains. Nothing special, just simple doodle art... Amanda Young(The Pig) is very unique character and I love her. Also Amanda's trap(Angel Trap/The Ribcage Harness)is my favorite trap in the movie.
---

---
So I play this game too much and consistently play in the red ranks on both sides.
---
Both sides (Killer and Survivor mains) dislike Freddy.
---
Survivirs don't really like him because his kit doesn't really allow him to switch focus. When you put someone to sleep, you want them dead. And the survivor can't really escape because as soon as you are far enough away he'll come back for you.
---
So it sucks when you are the one he isolates and tunneled.
---
On the other hand, killers dislike him because, against an organized team he has so much trouble. He can't catch people off guard because he can't attack right away. Also, he is an m1 killer so that id never good.
---
You can't defend your totems, you can't prevent rescues from the hook. He really does feel weak.
---
But all that aside, I enjoy playing him, I enjoy all killers (except for Legion, he is shit). With good perks and addons he can be a beast. Don't let the fact that a killer is off-meta stop you from playing them. But don't be surprised if you find yourself performing worse than you would with meta Killers
---
They may not have a CD on misses in FF but it still eats time. And their momentum has a habit of drawing them off mark. If you're just 360ing, sure, you'll probably get hit. Again *one* mechanic isn't going to save you. Juke a swing, add distance, try to put something between you. It's not hard. It's not fool proof, nothing is or should be, but it works.
---
Windows still delay Legion. Not as much, no, but they can't ignore them completely like Nurse and Huntress. Hell, windows are one of the best times to hit a Survivor as Huntress, not just negating but completely inverting their purpose. As for sprinting loops, Nurse, Billy, and Spirit are all faster and can down you in 1 or 2 hits.
---
&gt;If you can’t see how legion just ignores the machanics survivors have to escape you’re just bad at survivor 
---
Then I guess being bad as Survivor is the key to not dying to Legion then. Because I rarely do, because Legion is a shit tier Killer.
---
It takes about 160 seconds to remove all dull totems adding on a 20 time to het to each totem and 12 seconds to cleanse. That’s 1 3/4 gens ( adding a 20 second travel time) for a suspicion that they have noed.
---
To the wraith I ran the entire game with my no mither ass build, 
---
I forgive you for camping me, but I will not forgive you salty ass running no Ed 
---
Hahahahahahahah
---
Please dont pallet stun, flashlight, deceicive strike. Makes killers experience miserable. I understand your point, but if it's what they want to do, it's there experience also
---
I'm aware that they exist however in my experience the only hate mail I've ever received in 3 years of playing online games is playing as a killer in dbd
---
I'm sorry survivor just wanna survive 
---
Please dont loop, dstrike or use any perk that lets you survive in general. It makes my game experience misarble.
---
I always thought the Pig should have been Hoffman and the survivor Strahm, but I guess they got the license just from the first movie? Very cool art btw.
---
Dunno how lucky I was. My teammate got rescued and immediately got stuck in the trap on the Basement stairs.
---
The guns not facing his head. LOL
---
I love this!
---
It's a DC
---
Damn you're right... I'll tell the pitchfork guy hes got business coming his way
---
My b. Hard to tell sarcasm over the internet 
---
all those flashlight's but no firecrackers bruh
---
Quinton because who doesnt want to play as a tired AF drug dealer. Kate is a very close second
---
Clown and Hag are my favorite killers, but I dont play killer often.
---
Nothing stopping you surviving and saying gg to your killer though 
---
Bamboozle Nurse, Overcharge Freddy, Distressing Myers
---
Yeah, I don't play Killer a lot. I'd say I only play an average of 5 matches a week as a Killer, and I'm not even that good at it. This is the first time I actually set the goal of achieving Rank 1, and I'm just glad I managed to do it, since until last month I had only gone as far as Rank 5, and I was already struggling. I thought being a Killer wasn't for me, especially playing the game with a Joystick on PC, but hey, I proved myself wrong!
---
I disagree. Ill play 1000 legions over 1 doctor. I can enjoy a match vs a legion. 
---
And it still works.
---
Oh ok. I was honestly scared there.
---
I know, I know, I'm sorry! I'm a masochist, I like being hooked more than I like hooking, it's not my fault!
---
I've Defs been called salty after calling out a killer tthat traps the fucking hatch lol, I don't care for hook camping too much, but why camp the hatch FFS lol
---
For survivors run no mither, self care, sprint burst and balance landing. Sorry for the double comment.
---
I noticed that as well. I play him a lot because I feel like he's underrated. And I just play my normal ("non toxic") playstyle. I don't camp and don't use noed.
---
I don't do those things on any Killers though, but after a game with lf, the survivors all thank me for not being toxic.
---
It just feels like he's getting do much hate because peolle genuinely believe that every LF is an insidious camper. To the point when they FUCKING THANK YOU for playing your normal playstyle lol
---
Same
---
Full video is on my [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCs17v_FePQ) for the ones intrested :)
---
Do you play on PC? I don’t know how it is there but on PS4 you don’t get compliments from survivors unless you approach them first or after you calm them down from their salty tantrum.
---
i'm a survivor main and i hit rank 1 killer waaaay before i hit rank 1 survivor.. i had like 2000 hours when rank 1 survivor happened. i was very skilled at survivor of course, but i just didn't have the patience to actually play properly... even now at 3.1k hours, i always play at low ranks because i love it so much.. i've only been rank 1 a handful of times, it's so overrated
---
And I thought I was the only one that this happened to, everytime it happens I just look at my ps4 like “uh you ok there”?
---
Wait are you calling us tubers?? Like tubers growing out from potatoes?
---
So how long was each individual ban? I’d assume you get permabanned the next time if I’m reading their statement on it correctly.
---
I'd say technically it can be counted by exploiting in some way.
---
Being able to lose out on getting an achievement because of people DC'ing seems like an "error in design" to me.
---
Wheres the fun in that?
---
I love my 8 pages of salt on my profile, theyre like medals for me
---
You're a godsend. 
---
I only have 750ish hours and Im rank 2 cant get 1 Soo close
---
You weren’t on the ground lol. U used it at the same time they hit you, which nullified the hit. 
---
Maybe I should watch whole Saw movie series again. Hard to remember everything...but Amanda was beautiful, that’s the important! Also I’m so glad you liked my art!
---
You gotta run Unnerving presence, Overwhelming presence,  Clourophobia and Monitor and Abuse on Dead Rabbit Vanity mirror myers
---
Exactly! When the Spirit's *seifuku* came out and someone shared a screenshot of her undergarments here I was like *"Okay, that's definitely an improvement"*, then came Feng and it's even better. A bold move, BHVR, but a very rewarding one ;)
---
And being a dick in post game chat is a requirement for surviving
---
I have 2 accounts.
---
I got banned on both of my accounts for a week when the first ban wave for DCing came around in about september, then I got banned again on my main in mid december for 2 weeks. I hate this fucking game so much that it's got to the point where I don't even care if I get perm banned
---
Thanks devs for trying something new :) I like how the event discourages farming, bland doesnt effect the speed of the game :) it's a great experience. While some people complain about not getting all free cosmetics, I'm hopeful that some of them buy them anyways so that you can have money to keep making the game a better experience for us all 
---
Console best I can do is offer the killer the dance of my ancestors at the gate
---
Poe's law
---
&gt;Survivors make a mistake thinking we will chase them away from the gen
---
This always amuses me on maps like Suffocation Pit and Resting Place. I have control over half the map and survivors try to pull me into the dead side that still has half the pallets up?
---
The ears, right!? The *'eeeaaaars...'*
---
Except Myers Op add-ons also take some time and skill to activate which Legions do not. However the majority of Legions add-ons are junk.
---
I'd argue that Legion is actually easier to play against than Doctor as it's even weaker to stealth players which Doctor counters to a large extent.
---
Legion is not OP, I'm a pretty crappy survivor but that's one of the killers I tend to relax with because I know I stand a decent chance of escape. I would agree though that it's not a fun killer by any stretch of the imagination. Right down there with Freddy on the annoyance factor. 
---
Because it completely ruins the fun in the game for survivors. There is nothing fun about watching the killer stand in front of you, and there is nothing fun about just doing a gen when the killer is sitting in front of a hooked survivor. That's why it's frowned upon.
---
Shaman billy: hex ruin, hex devour hope, hex third seal and hex thrill of the hunt
---
Addons: both steering addons and coldwind farm offering
---
On pc as well. I usually just get salty survivors when I 4k. Because if the are geedily swarming the hook as soon as I hook someone, I'm obligated ti move etc etc.
---
Yeah salty survivors exist on pc too. That's why I'm amazed when I stomp ad LF because they are glad it was a fair game at least
---
Noice.
---
I'm here too
---
That seems like too high of a number but I guess disconnects on the games part is factored into that. Plenty of games where the loading screen just freezes.
---
You can do it, you still have a few more days!
---
This should definitely continue 
---
Join in a game with him and drop them one at a time:)
---
All of Legion, I like their masks.
---
It’s the poor players that allowed you to get a 4K in the first place. This doesn’t prove anything other than that your skill level was moderately above those survivors.
---
Well yeah, I know there is salt on pc, I still find it weird that you have been complimented before.
---
Yeah, but most of the time is Hoffman the one that acts as the Pig and Tapp is just in 2 movies (1 really) out of the 8. I guess the problem is there are so many characters in the series it's difficult to pick one.
---
I actually don't really care about the gore stuff, I really like the story of the saga more. But I digress, again, love the art!
---
So do I lol
---
I feel bad for the Rank 10 Killers having to play against someone with over 3k hours who should definitely be on Rank 1.
---
Ah, same. That happened to me today, quite a disappointment to realize that I had not gained a single lunar coin. :\[
---
I honestly love the banter between killers and survivors during and after games. I’m a killer main and yea after almost every game I got a message from someone about something or I message a survivor about something. In the end of the day, it just makes the game more amusing to me lol 
---
I like them and have 2 cats that are alive and well thank you very much.
---
I play solo, rank 15. it's not like I'm running in a SWF death squad so the killers don't have a problem. My teammates are usually shit enough to waste all of the pallets and get me killed anyway. These survivor nerfs have just made the game unfun for me.
---
That's only if he hits someone in Feral Frenzy and you're only revealed if you have not been afflicted with Deep Wounds while being in his base 24m TR.
---
How? You can block them from messaging you, but that's it as far as I know.
---
What survivor nerfs are you referring to exactly?
---
I can't find the link could you pm me?
---
So he needs a buff?
---
If you block them on steam the game will not put you with or against them.
---
brown cow stunning 
---
That's why, the game itself is easy, but the post-match is the death itself.
---
Shack defender trapper hill Huntress 
---
That rank range is DC hell. Survivors quit after getting seen. Much like the picture this has been my last four days at rank 14. I haven't had 1 match without a DC. 
---
That would be correct.
---
I suppose that's true. It is awful that people are able to exploit that though.
---
Remember Me doesn't even affect any action speeds apart from Exit Gates so I don't know where that came from
---
"WAGH" -Survivors when the killer isn't Wraith
---
This looks amazing!! I love the contrast comic-book look. Well done!! ♥️
---
Because people paid for a campfire simulator.
---
Because people paid for a hook and camp game.
---
Because people paid for a laggy game.
---
Because people who paid the game and who aren't good at the game get t-bagged at the exit gates.
---
Because people who paid for the game and can't catch a survivor get called names.
---
Because people who paid for the game work hard for a Rank that doesn't reward them but make the game excessively more difficult.
---
But some people play fairly, and nicely. 
---
Some people derank all the way to the lowest of Ranks to help survivors out.
---
Kill your Friends is a great way to learn.
---
Oh man I'm still working towards the bloody head, I totally forgot about it! Could always add it in future. Thank you very much!
