God I still cannot believe how fucking useless that perk is. 
---

---
At least Insidious has some meme value and it's good for a certain playstyle (even if that playstyle is shit)
---
But Monstrous Shrine is literally useless. You don't even use it for Basement builds, that's how horrible it is.
---
---
---
sick, you even built the walls and pallet!
---
I've seen some people cosplay as Dwight, Bill, Nea and Feng
---
The timer for current ds works perfectly well to stop tunneling. The suggested version is bad. Say the killer doesnt tunnel but instead gets looped around by someone else, or just generally doesnt get a hook. They go back to the survivor they last hooked like 2 or 3 minutes later and get d striked for no reason. Super dumb. There is nothing wrong with ds. The nerf it got was perfect. It's still an amazing perk.
---
Look dope, I just really want a blighted demogorgon skin
---
OH YEAH! that one video of them healing?
---
Big feet, er big er... hands or whatever they say
---
Leaked Micheal cosmetic
---
Yeah points from the event tally up to your total score which is why you get over 32k in points now
---
Idk man, they're so shit they give you an extra health state, like they're so bad they change the game, Like omg they need to be buffed
---
#**Putrid Serum is only available in the free track of The Rift. A total of 60 Putrid Serum are available this year, allowing you to earn up to 6 Hallowed cosmetics (or two full outfits). Putrid Serum will remain in free track for the duration of The Rift. Any unspent Serum will expire two weeks after The Rift closes.**
---
Oh for sure, but he still got kinda messed up by the pallet considering he should have definitely downed me there
---
Wait a fucking fuck-
---
Should we point him to r/dadbydaylight as well?
---
Its in the free Rift track, which is the battlepass like system they added into the patch. Its in the archives section
---
Sorry guy inserted wrong text it’s supposed to say “this is how salty I am about people talking about nerfing my keys or my syringes (junkie) because I play and”
---
I got dbd on a steam sale, and got two dlcs, ghostface and Leatherface, cuz i love those characters.
---
Ghostface and Billy are my favourites at the moment, but i havent played all the killers yet.
---
That and there were several pictures from a few months ago
---
Minor bit of constructive criticism- the legion mask has a bit of a big forehead, if you could someway cut that off, it's a perfect mask. Otherwise a good 8/10!
---
It’s better that you got BBQ. You could always unlock Hag then level her up until she gets Ruin for free, but you can’t do with BBQ as you need to buy Bubba with real money.
---
Beat me to it...
---
we could still play if you wanted to!! no party necessary, I just hate queuing in alone :))
---
When you're trying to go for the achievement:
---
Then don’t look?
---
Its Burger King Myers
---
A full on representation I love it!
---
They don't even were carrying flashlight, they melted your eyes pointing at them with lightsabers.
---
Ruin now exists forever and bbq and chilli lasts for a minute.
---
Aka only prestige if you want the bloody clothes
---
How do you rotate him like that on console?
---
i mean, why would you fixed something that's not broken?
---
Legit the oldest trick in the book, every killer above rank 10 knows this shit
---
It should be “don’t fucking camp pallets in general learn to loop” 
---
Camping pallets is the worst thing to do. It gives the killer soo much more advantage.
---
Funny, laughed. Have an updoot
---
in what way is it not a buff when it was a direct increase to her plethora of abilities?
---
exactly !!! but it's even sadder when they do it against a tier 1 myers cuz hes so slow
---
take my goddamn upvote
---
For killer run bloodwarden but it will still be hard.
---
Also, sorry it’s on it’s side, it’s not supposed to be like that.
---
Ah, yes. Karate Myers
---
You need to run more loops. =D
---
they dont need to be buffed or anything, they are and were perfectly fine
---
Stridor trumps this anyway. Cause Iron Will reduces grunting by 100%, making it zero. But Stridor raises it by 50%. Bringing it back up to 50% of grunting noise. I use stridor on Spirit and you can tell who is using Iron Will or not bc they are much quieter. It actually throws me off sometimes because someone will be really loud so I think they are next to me but they are farther away so I miss.
---
So that's why the update was delayed smh
---
Just in general. You can make a pallet last up to a full minute but instead you give up that minute. Especially at shack pallet lol. 
---
Early throws of shack pallet or shack pallet camping feels bad lol.
---
Even if he moved at 115%, just not being able to lunge is a huge drawback to killers. You can literally run around a rock against T1 Myers and it will take forever for him to hit you twice.
---
&gt; I would fuck with the beat up mask from the 2018 movie
---
bless the person that would have to endure that
---
Yeah, I'm fat, I am cool with it.
---
Tombstone and an ebony? That is some massive overkill, especially during bloodhunt lol. Surprised he didn't pop on NOED over Dying Light (Idk why he ran Dying Light, he wouldn't be hooking anyways. Unless he forgot about it's rework)
---
New Killer concept; LarryLavekio's dog
---
How is multiple survivors escaping through the hatch before all the gens are popped or instantly recovering a health state not broken?
---
Can someone explain what charms do? Are they just cosmetic or do they serve a purpose?
---
Format backwards
---
Perfectly fine is an over statement, they were so shit omg like they made an m1 killer waste no time at all, XD
---
Pro tip for clearing the second challenge:
---
Wraith always starts the trial invisible.
---
Good luck!
---
I thought this shit was in slow motion at first XD
---
I just love the idea that anyone with a positive IQ would agree with op because the only people who do are probably their SWF group. OP seriously thought people would agree with them.
---
Unsafe pallet. Need to look for a better loop.
---
Alright. I sent you a friend request. If you get it and I'm offline it means I went to sleep. If that's the case, sorry, hopefully we'll be able to play tomorrow.
---
Hey dunno if you'll ever read this but I was dead ass wrong. Played a game this morning with some survivors running iron will 3 and it was as if IW/Stridor simply cancelled each other out and made them normal volume when injured. BHVR has bamboozled me yet again
---
Oh so survivors aren’t playing like turds, considering the event is to do gens. Love the hypocrisy.
---
20% of his Upper body neads to be exposed to be revealed
---
i play just as much survivor in top ranks as i do killer and i have to say, i've personally never seen it done to me, im sure its a common trick but i was surprised at the amount of people who didnt figure it out.
---
Cake Day Happy
---
Its supposedly not working right as of this moment, but they said they enabled crossplay between both versions
---
Oh I didn’t even notice it was my cake day. Lol
---
I feel ghost face is honestly
---
Spirits are usually annoying to play against, not toxic.
---
Letherfaces and Micheals on the otherhand...
---
rub one out
---
Exactly
---
ohhhhhhhh the Baby Tums...
---
Looks sick dude should have done the hound mask tho

I feel you brother. I used to get a solid 45 FPS on the lowest setting, but after the patch, I've gotten variably from 12 to 25. As a killer main, it sucks especially because of the post game chat :(
---
I was literally discussing this with my friend! It’s a vicious cycle. Killer gets bullied by toxic survivors, decides to sweat hard next game out of frustration. Survivors then get steam rolled by said killer, decide to be toxic next match.
---
if u set up two screens u can play dbd on two different consoles at once
---
It's ridiculous yeah, they should just change it to holding like with other interactions.
---
I never play leatherfaces and don’t have any problems with Michaels
---
Yeah ghost face is up there
---
I have 120 of both lol
---
Amanda is always the most likely to be playful out of all the killers. I love it!
---
Just the amount of experience you accumulated . Because coding is hard
---
Yoy can loop him by dropping pallets early, chaining tiles together, waking up, and being adaptive to hiya teleport. His not spirit where you cant do anything
---
 His a good killer with lots of tools where you have to put in effort to survive like billy. He competes with billy on rank 3 or 4.
---
First didn’t know there was subreddit dedicated to one killer in a game and second not everyone plays ptb?
---
Tbf, there is an achievement for everyone escaping though the hatch at the same time, so I do believe it was an intended mechanic to some degree. To get the achievement, though, all gens need to be done in order for the hatch to spawn with everyone still alive.
---
I think you missed the last Q&amp;A where they basically confirmed spirit nerfs.
---
They said spirit "changes" but we all know what that means lol.
---
Oh that’s stupid
---
So he can stealth and get the exposed effect safely? And for free?
---
Still better than nothing I guess, but it should be 0% regardless:/
---
The quietness and length of this whole thing just gives it that extra comedic punch.
---
Mods!
---
Thank you random citizen !
---
Blud pints
---
Ok I had two people one game dead hard, Head On, The one that let's you unhook yourself and the one that give you endurance after unhooking someone and they both ran right into my Basement and just fucked around with me down there for four minutes.
---
NOOOOO! Well that makes me a sad panda :(
---
Yeah idk what you're talking about
---
Yeah Z walls are bad but have you seen S walls? gee wizz.
---
I had this yesterday after a Kate got sacrificed on a hook lol. Very creepy, and perfect for Halloween!
---
This went on for like five minutes lol
---
[removed]
---
Spirit is the current face of spikes. Its the easiest to win with and there are those who just play to win for their ego. Ego = toxic
---
What a masterpiece. My respects :)
---
I'm on PS4 and I have noticed since this update when I join matches the framerate is horrendous in the lobby, is it just me?
---
I am a Freddy main, there’s some things you can do that are kind of standard against any killer. If you can stay unseen altogether that’s obviously a big help. But you can loop him the same as any other killer. It’s like any other that has some kind of trap, we try to put them in hard to see places but they can’t be everywhere. Watch out for us putting one down while you’re looping in order to break a strong loop. 
---
Smart players wake each other up and wake themselves up. Against a decent group I find they are hardly ever actually asleep. 
---
Some maps it is still very easy to lose the killer in bamboo, tall grass etc.
---
I dont know what it is but the audio is really satisfying in this setting.
---
Both killer AND survivor ones seem extremely hard but in the end ill pick killer path.
---
Personally I like that they are not same cakewalk as level 1 we got currently.
---
Dang where you be at? I need to see that in person
---
Nothing personal but I really do find people that wait the whole timer instead of just readying up a little annoying.
---
That is fuckin grotesque, is this a fan made artwork? genius take on the demigorgon.
---
Ding-Dong
---
I cant wait to see his mori with the pipe lol that'll be interesting
---
Wahhhhhhh!
---
good boi fredward
---
D'awww, this is adorable. Please take better care of her than what the Huntress does lol.
---
im just making suggestions to help the game, DS currently can trigger if you arent being tunneled
---
Yeah this is way worse
---
8/10 because no flashlight.
---
Had someone recently stating that, if you win, especially by a landslide, and you say gg first youre toxic for rubbing it in... that was actually posted and upvoted to this subreddit just this month.
---
What do you sniff?
---
I understand, sorry
---
 
---
Whatever lets you have fun man :) as long as you enjoyed yourself!
---
I actually like all of them like they’re so good I just don’t have any words
---
Literally me...
---
I wouldn't complain about ruin spots when you are running noed /s
---
Check before posting, this has been posted for countless times
---
pure souls brother ^^
---
I wosh they would either extend blood hunts or at the very least, inform you about them a week before it happens
---
This is like liking your own comment which like sucking your own dick which is like...
---
Why did you get downbooped? Here's some karma ENDURANCE ha. See what I did there?
---
Dude wow the bell looks super high quality! How'd you make it?
---
Thanks! I really did, tonight was definitely the best Halloween I've had in a while.
---
It only blocks the window during chases. Crouching pig isn't in a chase.
---
Or sprint past you but still hit you with her lunge
---
Is this some sort of 3.3.0 joke that I'm too updated to 3.3.1 to understand?
---
That weapon is glorious, is that 3d printed? or paper mache?
---
This is caused by a lag desync between you (client) and the server (killer). Shouldn't happen with Dedicated Servers when they come to console, that is assuming the servers are good enough to not lag badly.
---
Been an issue for a while, BL &gt; DH
---
Thanks!
---
Do good on a killer with noed
---
Or Permanent!!
---
Probably new you were a baby survivor
---
For the killer that pops out of the ground as a trap, does the trap not trigger if the survivor crouches? I got someone left behind because I triggered the trap.
---
nice. easier to do and looks good. makes me want to carve a pumpkin... or a survivor.
---
They could actually do something like this for the Feng Min tome!
---
That happened to me once sorry you suffered too friend
---
High Quality Shitpost
---
You’re toooooo tall for Pig 😁😂
---
Doctor is not letting the game end for the Survivors, regardless of the Gates being open or not.
---
If it’s a 4 Man, I wouldn’t even open the gate. Fuck that tactic, let him sit idle and not get his points unless he moves.
---
Nice
---
ThatsTheJoke.JPEG
---
Absolute lad
---
I have had this happen a lot. I think it’s sever delay. I have been using dead hard earlier to get it to work. I’m using it by predicting an attack rather than trying to react to one. It works out this way since the delay on the killer end results in them swinging anyways and my dead hard actually working.
---
I went as him the last two years! Decided to switch it up haha
---
Ends on the 4th
---
It’s likely the killer was being kind to you, some choose to give the last survivor the hatch if they notice they’re new (doesn’t run the common loops etc) or when they feel like it. Also, occasionally, killers may play ‘easier’ or spare the last one if there’s a disconnect, it really depends on who’s playing :)
---
****Jazzy Halloween theme plays****
---
nice. btw, what did you use for the bodyx
---
Pardon?
---
Happy Microphone day!
---
Correct me if I’m wrong but that’s Monday right?
---
My issue is I don't think that promoting slugging is particularly conducive to a fun time on the survivor's side \*and\* he would suffer from Plague's disadvantage of it being very hard to pip playing him in such a way. If a character like this was introduced he would have to have some modifier to the Sacrifice emblem/scoring category.
---
I also don't think anyone would use his Hex, the benefit of more information in comparison to Tinkerer just isn't worth the ability to be removed.
---
On the positive side the unique playstyle makes some underused perks a lot better and promotes experimenting with a lot of unconventional builds. For example Knockout and Deerstalker become very good whereas hook based perks like Pop Goes The Weasel become a lot worse than usual.
---
Some interesting ideas.
---
I'm uninstalling
---
Very cool!! The little plague is very cute
---
I believe so
---
i don't know why you say pardon like this is real life and im talking to you, stop roleplaying its fucking cringe dude
---
Ok, thanks

"the alchemist" next killer?

---
Devs obv don't Queue as Killer in Aus/NZ.... you're lucky to get 2 games in an hour.
---
Impossible if you try it solo. Teammates will finish 2 gens without you and thus denying you the challenge. This will probably make DC's quite a bit more common when level 4 comes out.

As a killer main I do this al the time some of us will realize if someone is new and not chase after them or give them the hatch to help them out a with bloodpoints
---
there will be a farming discord setup for this.. some of them are bonkers hard unless you've massively deranked
---
That penalty doesn’t occur with other survivors nearby, the third one was pretty damn close
---
Everything looks good to me. /s
---
I just assumed Greg the Demogorgon was finished with his monster energy can and crushed it
---
This is why the event was delayed.
---
Am I the only one who thinks charms are just useless? Especially for survivors. At least killer's charms are big and they shine on hooks. Survivor's are small and I cannot even see them while playing...
---
Lmao what? Im actually so confused. Why am I getting downvotes and hate right now?
---
Level 1 is pretty easy. My game glitched and I got to see level 4 and some of the nodes are ridiculously hard.
---
that's the in-univers reasoning for maps being procedural: The entity is confused by how to put it's legos together so just slaps them together and goes "close enough, ima head out"
---
WHO THE HELL IS FEEDING MYERS?!
---
*Heavy Breathing Intensifies from behind* 
---
Oh shit, oh fuck
---
&gt; You could always unlock Hag then level her up until she gets Ruin for free,
---
 Yeah no you cant on PC. Hag only free on console
---
I appreciate killer's bodies by rotating them then I just stare at the screen for a while, zoning out. Mostly. Sometimes I would watch through my perks and think of some experimental builds I would set next.
---
Everything is 100% hand-made!
---
Why does this matter? Its been leaked for weeks that its gonna be 31-4 lmao keep up.
---
Mine have the liquid in the vials, that's weird
---
I play on PC. I meant you can unlock Hag with Shards. Hag doesn’t exclusively cost irl money unlike Cannibal
---
Probs with that internet that can't load over 144p lmao
---
Its actually made out of 100% authentic fake kidney beans.
---
I feel like this is worded very, very incorrectly. I imagine what it means is “equip the perk Dark Sense and have 4 generators be completed in a single trial” meaning that it counts gens repaired by teammates as well.
---
You are using one of the least fun to play against Killers in the game why are you complaining that they would DC lol
---
spirit main problems
---
Implying that finding 10 games in an hour is possible
---
I just try to use spinechill it feels sooooo good when you get a spirit with the trick
---
That and I have a shitty computer.
---
It happened to me prior on Xbox, it's just a glitch I think. I took the L and I got it next time
---
is it confirmed 2 weeks between tomes?

---
Instaheals were bad for balance lol. If you don't think so play killer at any decent rank.
---
Z U Z I
---
I think you're forgetting that the entity timer starts ticking down when you open the exit gates, so it will end the game in 2 mins regardless of the doctor blocking them or not.
---
And I really would not have a staring competition with a killer that's body blocking. They are trolls and they will literally sit there for hours if they have to, so for your own time, you might as well just dc or die and go to the next game. It's not worth it to sit there for hours to force the killer into leaving
---
OMG you have a skeleton key with blood amber and prayer beads? FU skilless survivor learn to MINDGAME!!!! Oh wait it dies instantly if you do that

Next time let her into your survivor games..

I think you misunderstand. A prayer beads spirit benefits from a headset and can hear survivor footsteps, you can't hear a spirit's footsteps while she's phasing, at least I dont think so. If you could, then by the time you react she probably already gen grabbed you or got a free hit.

I apologize. I don't post often. Wanted to show that the killer was there when I was trying to work on the gen and that they came back, me healing Bill just in time and Bill getting put into the dying state before ending the video. I could have cut off the first part I suppose. My bad.

Nice. What materials and processes did you use to make the mask? I want to make masks for cosplaying in the future. Thanks.
---
If a healthy survivor saves, you still makes you hit one of them twice
---
Why is his mouth blurred...?
---
You shouldn't dc just cause the killer has a mori
---
This is amazing. Please post the pictures of everyone together and posing a chase. kudos!
---
Thanks this makes a lot of sense
---
Illegal serve.
---
thats a yikes from me
---
Ah ok. Just being a cunt for no reason. Nice. Btw sick insults man. You really got me calling me a weeb hahaha what are you 14? Lmfao
---
Stupid. That game is dumb
---
LMFAOOOOOO
---
Oh shit, oh [REDACTED]
---
They're good as long as you have them. Get as many as you can.
---
yeah bro that insult was so bad that you felt the need to bring it up and tell me how bad it was because it didnt get to you
---
People should be encouraged enough with 1000 bp. Lol
---
Yes, it's just the Offering that can't be used, as it relies on the Blight generators and hooks. Once the event is over, you can't get any more unless there's one on your current blood web when it ends.
---
Yeah I was talking about the Thompson house itself lol
---
Ok I’m out
---
Ah
---
The other clown suit is great too
---
I got excited for minute thinking that they added an 8 v 2 mode or something
---
HybridPanda has a few videos on Ghostface.
---
A place in ohio. "After thoughtful consideration for the safety and enjoyment of our kids, the mayor of the city has decided to move trick or treat to sunday November 3rd"
---
I have to agree, I always see them hard tunneling one survivor and running ruin with noed.
---
This is quite common in DBD, the survivor probably dced because he thought the game was being unfair to him.
---
And the rest could just be SWF or solo players who don't want to go through the effort of a 3-man game.
---
?? Mine still have the liquid even though it's not as shiny as before. PS4 btw. Which one is this?
---
I. LOVE this
---
That’s so weeeeeiiiird. I’m in Saskatchewan and we just tell our kids to nut up or shut up. Also why not just move it to tomorrow or Saturday? Do you guys have weird weather going on right now?
---
Stab me mommies
---
just gonna put this here since some people are pointing out that OoO no longer works against Ghostface: I’m aware of that now (I haven’t had a chance to play killer yet since the update happened so I kind of forgot they changed stealth killers). 
---
but I think everyone can still enjoy the meme, since it’s barely been 2 days since the change. hopefully, anyway :P 
---
I could probably think of a more fitting caption to suit the current patch but I don’t really wanna change it now. you guys can make your own memes with this picture if you’d like :D
---
Not really, it's just cold as usual.
---
Sorry if you didn't see part 1! Idk how to link it on mobile. I just said I'd try to post a better picture today!!
---
Thats really creative! I never thought about using beans before.
---
Any reason this was deleted? I would've liked to see.
---
Dead hard can prolong a chase minutes it’s used at the right time. The fact that it isn’t working half the time because of dedicated servers does in fact change the game drastically.
---
lmao
---
On our way ;)
---
Oh snap
---
so for switching targets, but doesnt the chase drop at about 4-5 seconds so you immediately gain TR after breaking away from your target?
---
Yeah it's brought out the most entitled shitty players I've seen lol.
---
Removed salty after game chat
---
T-bag after pallet stun = please tunnel me
---
***PREACH***
---
I must say, i haven't laughed this hard in a while. This is top quality! xD
---
Spirit Halloween sells dummies. 3d printed the hook, stand it build with old deck wood.
---
I feel like you're doing his facial expression and anxious body language spot on,  especially the brows haha
---
Prestiging isn't worth it if you don't want the bloody cosmetics. I just prestige because I want to get full level on everything with as many cosmetics as possible.
---
But she's already 115%
---
It's not fun in the slightest to play vs ebony mori or prayer beads and people play games to have fun 
---
So is the solution to make everyone "lock in" to a character and build before queuing, and then once in a lobby, everyone can see everyone? Dont like a build? Players can opt out if they see mori/swf/beads/medkits and the lobby is cancelled and everyone gets put back in the queue. Fair? Because currently one side can see the other and say "doesnt look fun, I'll pass" while the other side cant and has to suck it up. One side isn't more entitled to fun than the other. Either both can dodge or neither can dodge.
---
Damn...drop dead gorgeous nea ftw!!
---
Claudette bloody clothes is definitely worth prestiging for, though I wouldn't ever expect mercy from a killer again. Literally, like ever.
---
I need this as a skin.
---
Yo that's dope dude that must have run you a couple bucks 😂😂
---
I already go against NOED every game anyways so I guess it nothing changes lol
---
Yeah I agree the others are difficult, but if you optimise your loudout on an endgame build it shouldnt be that hard, saving 4 survivors during endgame collapse is basically all luck though.
---
I don't think they're op, just really annoying.
---
Where can you even spent that stuff?
---
Nice. I have a Michael suit and mask that I wore to pick up my friends today.
---
u/chattywindow created the edit for anyone wondering
---
Please devs, come one!
---
Not everyone has the free time to play games whenever they want. If the event was longer or a concrete date given ahead of time people could change their schedules to be able to enjoy the event.
---
Survivor greeting eachother with teabags or nodding.
---
I enjoy this very much
---
Were they spooked?
---
Ah, yes, the "hey there" teabag...lol
---
Dark sense does include any gen completed now. It got buffed
---
Jumpscare Myers in a nutshell
---
Username checks out
---
My first friend's sister was scared for a couple seconds and my second friend is a scaredy cat. So I did scare one od them.
---
Yeah, when survivors spawn best eachother the bagging spam happens a lot, lol
---
I know, but it still doesnt make sense to me
---
Yeah he doesn’t know how to perfect loop the video aha
---
I like how you were like, _alright_... moving on...
---
Oh absolutely.  That's literally the first thing that I do when I spawn with a single survivor.
---
Multiple ones - teabag party ensues....which may actually be a problem. Lol
---
What mask did you get? Mine is the licensed 1978 one and I wasn't too impressed. Especially since it's gotten deeply discounted since I purchased it. I figured it would've gotten more expensive around Halloween.
---
Lol! Props to her
---
I got one on Amazon.com of tbe 2018 mask and I got it at half price for $50. I think my profile picture still is me in that mask
---
People are probably going to end up deranking just so they can face easier killers just to get challenges done faster and easier.
---
Wait let me just make sure I'm hearing this right, you have to complete 4 generators all by yourself, or does it mean that you have to work on 4 generators that will eventually be completed (meaning that if you tap a generator earlier in the match and then that gen is compeleted later it counts towards this challenge), or does it mean that as long as you are working on the gen when it finishes it still counts?
---
There's also the slow nod when you're crouched in the corner and the killer clearly sees you.
---
The Shape cosmetic: Michael ate burgers, now he thicc. Oh lawd he comin.
---
i dont think she should be though because shes so easy to play, like ive said before, skill ceiling of a wraith with the power of a nurse
---
*tier 3 intensifies*
---
Spread the word. We must end the spirit mains!
---
talk about apples to oranges.
---
that shit sucks so much man. i always try to send a nice message to nurses i see on console, as i know that deflating feeling of getting a nurse daily all too well
---
"I am so proud of this community"
---
Yeah I was wondering cuz it looks really good! Wanted to make sure it was the 2018 mask. Maybe I'll be 2018 Myers next year lol
---
No you don’t get it we can’t have good killer because that would upset the salty t baging survivor’s!
---
Too funny I’m dying!
---
&gt; apples to oranges
---
But you can still compare them.
---
Nodding is a double edge though.... it's either "yes, you can leave" or "yes, I see you and you're going to die".
---
So hard to tell the difference, till you get smacked.
---
Then its kinda obvious.
---
Doctor main here, Oh yeah it's super funny
---
I would say it was worth the money. Nice for my collection too. I recently got a burned Darth Vader mask on etsy.
---

“Hurr but I paid for the game I do what I want hurr moris and spirit op”
---
No, that's not how you're supposed to *play* the game
---
You aren’t forced to run into the snares. More optimal avoiding. Fake pallets is a simple game of remembering which pallets haven’t been used. Wake yourself up and every so often look for 2-3 pallets that are real, but also drop fake ones to help your team out. His teleport trick is a hit or miss and depends on his style. Just run as far as possible from both him and the gen
---
instead of explaining the how the game works, let's downvote him guys.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm convinced this post is just a meme
---
Yeah I got my Jason Vorhees and Myers mask on display.
---
I mean you as a survivor looking at the killer and since you know you're detected you nod slowly. But yeah the killer doing it back is hard to read.
---
Nice.
---
Would I not have seen them DC first? 
---
I downed the survivor, went to pick him up, then he DCs and the game immediately ends. Doubting it was a coordinated DC.
---
Also, in the post-match screen, the chat said "Host Disconnected" but I was never disconnected from the game, no internet bumps, etc.
---
Random chance bug maybe?
---
Going back to what OP said, I think the reason spirits are viewed as toxic is bc people know that she is really easy to play and beast against survivors with. Therefor the portion of the player base that find enjoyment in ruining the game for others will gravitate towards spirit
---
In context yes, out of context no
---
Get a macro
---
which again, you could find out from common sense of holidays=double bp most likely or looking at /r/LeaksByDaylight

u/Skinwalker576
---
Ah lord he t posing
---
They aren’t exactly the safest, but you can kind of juke Killers with it if they aren’t on the edges of the map.
---
Basically if you’re being chased, run directly into it, vault it, and run to the right. The Killer will also go right to cut you off, so once you see him cut that way, immediately go left.
---
It will probably buy you an extra 4 seconds, if that. Moreso if you have Lithe and the wall is more in the middle of the map.
---
And killers DCing as soon as their hex totems are cleared
---
Yeah I’m just joking :D
---
Yeah I think it could actually be a bug like that Legian bug they fixed recently, sometimes losing frenzy would dc them from the match.
---
Everyone: Give us shirtless Myers
---
Me: Gimme chonky Myers
---
Wtf I want this.
---
So Xbox and PS4 don’t have them currently? Good because these lags are terrible.
---
Very unlikely that its going to count those gens. 
---
1-The challange just says that you must have this perk equiped
---
2-This one is in the last page and there are some as difficult as this one
---
Time to show them how easy a nurse can be!
---
Best comment right here.
---
Did you report for holding game hostage?
---
We finally got Myers foot reveal
---
Lore-wise: Because the Entity made it so and it never fully replicates things exactly like they should be.
---
Development-wise: Because they'd have to come up with a desert-themed map set that would be a total pain to design if they wanted to keep it more accurate to Babylon stuff.
---
I think we need both. The Legion nerf was ridiculous but Nurse and Freddy were very well done. Spirit needs some changes and most of the others need some buffs. Freddy, Nurse, Billy and Ghostface are all good right now. Map reworks are an important part of the balance though, too.
---
Sadly, there is a "completely" on the discription
---
This is by far one of the most difficult ones. 4 gens is insane. Final tome just seems like it’s made for SWFs
---
There's nothing there?
---
how lmao
---
If you play killer the survivor charms are in your face when you pick someone up.
---
That's the only time I see them in game
---
/r/wooosh
---
S walls would probably honestly be OPAF XD
---
A whole team DC on me and the sweet sweet killer let me farm some points because I didn't found the hatch, I ended up in the basement because he didn't find it either... At least I got some points!
---
Right, Right, Sorry for joking about insta heals lmAo
---
how is it toxic to prefer to play one role or another?
---
The worst part will be for solo players. I can already see players dcing when they fail to complete it.

This stuff right here is why I love this game.  Hilarious

Ultra-Rare Quality Meme

That's just a bug that can happen, been there since he released. My favorite one is when you get the filter without obliviousness because it gives you the upside down particles
---
Wait a second what if it’s 2 killers v 8 survivors in a bigger map with twice as many generators. So to get this mastery you have to not just race the survivors you also have to race the other killer.
---
90% sure I already saw Christmas stuff in my local Walmart a week or two ago.
---
I found hard to play against, he pops out of nowhere like a tier 1 Micheal Myers.
---
or the loop is just small enough to where she can still hit you before you can make any distance
---
Everyone in this thread is saying Spine Chill full-counters spirit, but what about the Spirit that doubles down and stares at the spot you're standing while traversing the loop?  Even if she screws up and flickers, giving away her phase, you're still toast.
---
We stan Jane in this house

Oh I love it :)

Yeah I hate when the permanent obliviousness happens.

---
got DAYUM
---
Being able to have a giggle with the other survs factors into why I still play this game. Same happens to me whenever I'm in a lobby filled with Meg's, I SWF with my friend and when theres 4 Meg's in the lobby we just put #MOGSQUAD and it ends in giggles sometimes which is always nice
---
Thank you!
---
Can I use this idea in a fan made idea compilation? I will credit you
---
Dude, that twist was awesome.
---
Your schools pretty cool, mine just did spooky scary skeletons this week
---
lol i completely forgout about that, now it makes sense
---
I don't DC against Spirit, I never DC because I would rather keep my bloodpoints, and I'm not that new as I have been consistently playing for some months now. And even then I play this game to have fun, and I never have fun against Spirit, much like Doctor, Wraith and Legion, Spirit is annoying to play against, but more infuriating than the others since you are basically powerless against her if you are injured
---
You Insidious bastard!

The dull totems that are under a light, like the one that spawns in Autohaven, fuck me up.

---
Yes, the leaks are right sometimes but imagine trying to take a day off work or rearranging your schedule around something thats not guaranteed

The devs should take those cases into consideration and let us all know ahead of time so we don't have to rely on leaks and rumors

Nothing, just a cosmetic.

Very cute cosplay! It really looks just like her!

Where’s Meg?

Yes. The Archives won't even be enough to get you to max Battlepass level, you are going to need to grind by just playing the game.

Okay that's true

and your gf must think you're hot so i doubt she would be wrong.
---
Well, at least u guys are smart
---
Hes a hag main
---
They never said rework. They said she’s due for a nerf. 
---
Personally I think they need to buff other killers before they even consider touching Spirit. I know Doc is confirmed for a change, so what the hell is taking so long with Plague? Legion? Pig? Clown? Wraith? Trapper? Srsly stop nerfing the good killers and understand why red rank diversity is so trash rn

---
Spine chill helps with that
---
Don’t think so but when I play as killer on PC it lags the other survivors horribly and it somewhat pisses them off. Avoid playing killer and keep playing survivor until you get your connection fixed
---
This, I started a game as Ghostface, a survivor was doing a gen and didn’t notice me so though I would stalk them. I was able to get a full stalk and down them with one hit, as soon as I picked them up they dc’d.
---

Huntress
---
Theres a perk for that.
---
Might be to far or your not seeing enough of there body. I know with ghost face you have to at least see like 25% of their body to stalk them.
---
No but it’s kind of a dick move to play knowing you’re internet isn’t able to handle it
---
Personally, I don't even know why people call it "mindgames" anymore to be honest. Realistically it may as well be a blind guess on the survivor's part when in a chase against her. 
---
Dodging Huntress's axe is more of a mindgame than this will ever be.

Not gonna lie huntress looks like she’s about to cry.

this is Natalie dyer (Nancy) by the way

That's...kind of upsetting, because it means trying to be smart with Spirit is inviable. Beads-&gt;gengrab is the only whey.
---
Late to the party but stumbled on this idea and love it. Don't get me wrong, I love pig in her mediocre current state; but the only time I feel like I'm an evil SAW mastermind is if I'm running ruleset no. 2, tampered timers and get enough momentum to trap 3/4 survivors very early. Your idea however sounds like it'd be giving you that feeling every game.
---
This would also cleverly work around her biggest flaw of being so loopable by forcing survivors into unsafe situations on trap activations (which admittedly does also happen on live but you need to get the trap on in the first place), as well as being very thematic and rewarding clever play on the killers part.
---
They'd perhaps have to adjust the scoring for pig (I mean, they should on live as well to be honest) by rewarding head pops appropriately with this though.
---
The ideas put forward sound like they'd be maybe a little hard to balance correctly, but thematically I think it's 1000% better than what we have. I'd love to see Piggy get this kind of rework love like Freddy but I can't help but doubt it. Here's hoping I'm pleasantly surprised.
---
And leaving three other people to face spirit. Nice.
---
from my experience, i found more toxic survivor than killer. and it is more frustrating.
---
pure tunneling and camping from the 1st hook is disgusting, but by doing that, especially camping. usually the game will end with survivor wining (some will made it to the exit gate). sure it sucks to be camped on first hook, but the killer also pay the price.
---
meanwhile, there are a lot of things you could do as a toxic survivor. and it could go both ways, to the other survivor or killer. and it is frustrating for both when it happen to them. while the toxic survivor still have the pip, bp, etc.
---
and when you play as a killer, the mindset is you are the one who hunts and superior, when it turn the other way around. it hurts, lol.
---
Yeah check out tru3tal3nt (truetalent). He plays a lot of ghostface and is really solid with him.
---
No I’m literally in their face.
---
I’ve played Michael since his release and I’ve never had this issue, I’ve noticed it since the patch.
---
This deserves so many more likes, that's a lot of effort and looks so good, great job!
---
Maybe it's a nerf because hes so easy to play
---
They could also dc? It’s not my job to make sure they have a good time
---
they say they postpone updates so there aren’t any notable bugs, but you can’t even start a match without restarting your game
---
&gt;Her counterplay is luck
---
Ahh yes, luck for unhooking yourself after the chase right?
---
We've all DCed once or twice. Just don't make a habit of it or fo it because you're losing. Sure sometimes things happen you get called away you've played 20 games and all of them were shitty so you just say I fucking quit when the next one is toxic. We all do it. But don't be a bitch and do it all the time or just because you don't like something
---
Fuck off
---
Exactly!
---
New legion Mori is just a fuckin curb stomp lmao
---
It's only worth it if you care at all about 1. The achievement you get for it. Or 2. The bloody cosmetics you get for it. Other than that nah, it's not worth it. 
---
That being said, I am on a mission to get everyone p3 all perks. Killers and survivors so I do it often. Lol
---
Where is that book thing from? It seems familiar.
---
Clown wishes he could
---
I feel like we'll get to the end and the challenge will be "You whiny little cucks aren't paying up: Purchase the premium pass, also we're selling free instacompletes for the impossible nodes around this"
---
Great costume man! Do you main Myers?
---
Same, looks like not getting pestula points at the end. First couple games tonight kept noticing it, then last game I was only one to bring offering, did 2 gens, got a nice 25k in match, and had 500 something before match. Sitting on almost 51k total after match.
---
I like how these range from impossible to an average day for most mains (the Ghost Face one).
---
To add to this, I managed to see this tome from reading some of the lore after completing challenges, and the game crashed. After loading it back up and going into Archives, I just saw this.
---
No but the majority of the community dislikes getting people like you as a teammate. You cry and whine because you don't want to put in the effort to get better against a killer you don't like. If you don't like the game, don't play it.
---
Where did you find this picture
---
this aged well
---
I love the idea that, despite being completely, plot-conveniently omnipotent, the Entity is also plot-conveniently stupid.
---
Dwight Master Challenge: Be in 2 lockers at once.
---
Its honestly a hard problem to counter, because what you are combating is the free information that players get from playing in a SWF. However, unless its a 4-man SWF, not every one in the game is going to be privy to that information. So if theres a 2-man SWF and you slow the generators down even a little bit, thats still half the players in that game that are being punished for nothing. 
---
I think what would be nice to try is a buff that speeds the killer up a little bit, but only when a 3-man or 4-man SWF is in the game. That would help in finding players that are getting early warnings about you coming because a friend told them where you are on the map, and also help end chases faster, which is when SWF primarily abuse their ability to coordinate out of game.
---
I'll admit it. I played 10 games yesterday I DCed the 10th game because every match I played was a toxic ass killer useless team mates ruins and op builds I couldn't best. By the last one I was done. Am I proud if it? No. But I can't say I'm totally innocent so just don't be a bitch about it and it's no big deal.
---
I hate how this community acts like it's never dced ever when it sees others do it. We all do it sometimes just don't be a bitch about it
---
Lol, kinda figured
---
I am indeed shit at rocket league
---
Thanks man, you’re always invited.
---
Just got to downgrade to DbD beta.
---
I like the game, but spirit is unfun to play against. If it’s a good spirit, you’re fucked. So I’d rather just dc and save myself the frustration.
---
Seconded, he's pretty good and he experiments a lot with the builds. With GF though, it's less about the builds and more about the playstyle, so pay close attention to his chase tactics and overall strategy.
---
Everything is incredibly slow to farm. Because the economy.
---
The other survivor tanking the chase instead of yeeting out is a real bro move
---
Huh, til. Thats neat.
---
Sorry for the late reply. Yes that's right, it's just the wrong calculation!
---
or just dc instead.
---
you deserve to get camped for that, actually abusing game mechanics to guarantee an escape, you make me sick and I can't imagine how upset that pig must have been, shame on you, can we get a mod here to permban this guy from the sub and the game?
---
Indeed I do! Ive got him real close to prestige and I want to do it because I main him, but I'll be saving up a hell of a lot of bloodpoints first
---
Make it take a Charm Slot by force to people who quit too often.
---
Ha. I was trying hard to escape but only because I was oblivious until after it was over. Sorry I wasn’t grateful, killer!
---
Keep in mind only 1/5 players are the killer, 1 killer + 4 survivors. So every time you want to play killer, the game needs to find 4 other survivor players. I'd say more than 1 in 5 players wants to play as the killer, that means killer queue is always going to be longer than survivor.
---
How did you get those eyes? Contact lenses or?
---
I had 4 DCs from other players yesterday, including the person I was playing with who clearly didn't manually disconnect.
---
Uh excuse me?? This clip is a perfect example of why pig needs a nerf sirrrr! Did you see how fast she was?? I couldn't lose her that's OP af
---
Heist with markiplier was fun
---
Wraith and Billy get those too.
---
Trapper and Huntress usually don't, oddly enough.
---
That sounds very similar... if it was you... sorry I was an idiot!
---
Scummy but not against any rules. Your report would be invalid.
---
this is actually a great idea from someone from the community
---
It's supposed to be slow. The idea is that you'd have to spend cash to get some tiers potentially if you don't grind it out as much. I think it is safe to say that overtime - you will get the majority of the levels completed.
---
Haha, were you playing and handsomely dressed Doctor?
---
Sounds like it!
---
Just complete it again.
---
I still don't understand what's funny about this tpose meme
---
prob a bug, if the hatch gets closed you can still open it with pink/purple keys
---
I mean to be fair the original Myers mask was a dollar bin  William Shatner mask turned inside out
---
You can hide in the corner all game and then get hatch. It's kind of a meme for claudettes to do this. Have you not heard of it?
---
Face camping is the only thing leatherface is good at. Give my poor baby a break.
---
Looks amazing!
---
5/10 Legs not hairy enough.
---
Play Bubba and facecamp, ez challenge complete.
---
It’s live on Shrine of Secrets right now!
---
I want Ted, with a costume of him in his milkman uniform
---
I know it’s not Susie’s mask, I’m currently working on finishing hers, Frank’s was just what I used to get something on for Halloween
---
haha yeah it was the only thing i could get quickly enough. thanks though!
---
I disagree. On other killers, its not as useful. The only killers its helped me with are nurse and spirit. Spirit for obvious reasons. And nurse and its important to know where on the other side of the wall they are. Everyone else feels like just mind gaming. If you know what ur doing spirit is really powerful yes, but against survivors who also know what they are doing. She's not as god like as everyone makes her out to be i feel
---
Run bloodwarden if ya can, and noed
---
In that case, no. I don’t believe I’ve seen a doctor yet. This one had a blade or object. It was pretty funny when he was just watching me continue repairing the generator. He was probably getting super frustrated with me.
---
I love how this was almost immediately the first reply. I’ll give it a try
---
If your solo queuing with head  on you'll waste half the game in a locker, never getting a chance
---
He talking about how the shrine changed due to the update and was confused
---
Why didn't your teammate just open the other door while he body blocked you at the 1st one and then you could've ran to the other open door? He can only block one at a time...
---
Unfortunately since I took the challenge literally all survivors I came across are very diligent in getting rid of Totems. Good advice all the same though.
---
Hope your post does well. This is brilliant
---
I so wanted to drop that. Take your upvote.
---
What i did was, let them do gens.  
---
I was running NOED, Bitter Murmur, and Blood Warden. When we reached end game, i just K.O.d and hooked someone and let the rest go.  
---
Worst case, you could always offer to farm and then just murder someone during end game. Lol
---
We deserve it, I welcome it
---
Michael was swole, you are S W O L E, my man
---
How DARE he try to win
---
You should still be able to open it.
---
These are the kind of games that prayer bead spirits  are born from you toxic swine. UnInStAlL bAbY BlYaT.
---
It’s essentially a guessing game on the survivors part which is in a way a mindgame so it does count I suppose. Just an extremely stupid version of one.
---
400 upvotes for a picture of a wall. He’s got it
---
Exactly, even the "fundamentals" artificially alter games, and often to their detriment: if you need to heal survivors or unhook them, you will probably be using Empathy and running after survivors all game, or rush unhooks recklessly and inefficiently, just trying to make that happen, which is not only unnatural, but detrimental gameplay. Most people won't just play normally with the mindset that "healing/unhooking survivors is something I will do sooner or later anyway, I won't go out of my way to do so" - most players will not only go out of their way to do so, but they will try to get challenges done as soon as possible, every single round dedicated to the completion of that challenge.
---
I noticed people racing each other for unhooks, even using Dead Hard to beat out others to get there; I noticed people battling for heals, and healing themselves rather than letting others heal them, since self-healing counts toward the challenge as well; I saw killers abandon chases and pressure potential just to kick gens, or to be able to kick a certain gen twice; I saw a lot of Moris and busted add-ons be used, just to try and do everything for the 4k challenge; and more.
---
And then there definitely are challenges that have nothing to do with fundamentals as well, such as having to complete flashlight saves (let alone multiple in a given round), or hooking a certain amount of players during specific times of the trial. Those more convoluted challenges we've seen in future tomes will downright ruin games.
---
Not bad advice. If all else fails that’s not a bad plan
---
Chest hairs tingling.
---
Sloppy butcher is a good go to. Makes survivors waste a lot of time healing when they could be doing gens. With this build you'll want to smack survivors even if you don't plan on pursuing the chase just to slow them down.
---
Yep, it's an issue.
---
Because she's the flavor of the month hate topic for this community. After she gets nerfed into uselessness they'll turn on Billy next. And then probably Huntress. And then back to Nurse.
---
That's why I said I wish there was required gen participation for the hatch to open.
---
Nonono you don't understand the survivor rule book says the killers must turn 180 degrees and walk into the nearest pallet come end game collapse. Then you must break LOS so the survivor can't see you.
---
boosted then ahaha. Jk. But really its easy enough as a survivor. Im rank 4  surv with WGLF and no items. Im nothing great just do decent on what youre meant to do and its fine. With instaheal you really dont want the killer to have fun, thats why you keep getting spirits
---
Hm, well if your goal is to exclusively get the endgame kill, perhaps a full endgame build could work?
---
Bitter murmur to get the location of all survivors for a limited time once the final gen is done.
---
Remember me to make the doors a tad bit longer to open, gives you more chances to find people.
---
Blood warden, if you hook somebody while the door is open, nobody can escape for the allotted time.
---
Fire up, makes it so every time a generator gets done, your secondary actions get even faster. 
---
No one escapes death, it’s worth it juuuuust in case.
---
Yeah, coughed up 1000 cells for it, im getting the charms and such. Just no cells.
---
not really man, usually hag traps are never dispersed around the map just for no reason so you shouldn't be crouch walking everywhere, just pay attention to where her general location is and open your eyes, you will be fine
---
Yeah, I've run into people that don't play Trapper at all, and just offered to farm to get the achievement.
---
How would you make Legion better? :)
---
You're so high you think that the random wraith player who probably didn't even note your name (even in the off chance it matches your reddit name) is going to come here and happen to read your random comment.
---
Yep ive been on both sides. End game collapse I don't expect killers to do anything other then secure their kills. Ive done it and had it done to me. I don't even get upset. I just sit there and hope someone with BT comes by to do the dance. If not, oh well gg.
---
No freddy, no plague. There's nothing for me here
---
One of my teammates that died opened one and he hooked him there and the other teammate opened the other. There was me and one person left. He only wanted me and wasn’t trying to block her, she was already in the door.
---
you open the archive up on the right side, and pick a mission to do. After finishing the mission you will get experience towards the battle pass. Ideally you want to do as many missions as possible.
---
Lol, yeah, probably.
---
Ok thanks so what are those blue things
---
You clearly haven't played much killer.
---
Nea
---
Wow, using the toxic Z Wall infinite. Do you have no honor?
---
Great plan! I’ll try this as soon as possible. It should hopefully get some much need results when I obtain all those perks. Thanks Diggly.
---
Yeah the event game you an extra couple thousand
---
The original can make my heart stop, you can make it melt. If it’s worth anything, I’d let you stalk me any day. Nice work my man 👌
---
One of the better ones I've seen. Well done.
---
We can make the world a better place by never mentioning it again
---
Console is still peer to peer.
---
?
---
Personally I think hes a little too fast with out his ability. I think if he was just a little slower and his ability made him vault faster I think that would be balanced. I know I said fuck off but personally I think legion doesnt need a buff nor a nerf he just needs to be balanced out better
---
Awesome cosplay 😍
---
wasn’t meaning to be rude man
---
Seriously dude. Why tf are you trying to be a dick?
---
And you're using it? Wow dude, not cool
---
“you dare contest me” exclaims Claudette, approaching with urban evasion
---
Charms are purely cosmetic that you can equip in-game to survivor and killer. You can have up to 3 charms at a time.
---
Admirable. But I think you fail to realize that both survivors and killers can get disgustingly competitive. I have a bunch of cakes left on my Ghost face and bring them every game. I still end up mostly facing sweaty ass SWF teams.
---
Burger King Myers comin for ya
---
I just did it and yeah I took a mori. The last survivor hid until end game collapse killed him.
---
They were all laughing at me in post game “haha idiot no challenge for you”.
---
But it 100% counted and I completed the challenge.
---
Nurses, whispers, ruin, bbq is what I use for typical. If doing body blocker I replace whispers with save the best for last, and if doing a mint rag/shackles build I replace nurses with make your choice.
---
Had a troubled childhood.
---
Lol, I'm just poking fun at this, it's supposed to be funny. But now you've ruined it.
---
Ok.
---
Just drop the survivor lol, bodyblocking will never be bannable.
---
The killer on the left looks like they'd make a great addition to dbd.
---
I like flashlights as a killer main as, even though they are annoying, I can practice walking sideways and lunging at 90 degrees for hits, or navigating blind.
---
When people disconnect is sucks for the remaining survivors lol every second you’re getting carried around is precious
---
I hope he gets a freddy level rework. The whole mend thing just wasnt a good idea from the start.
---
What a fuckin' madlad
---
It very much is - a lot of people have suggested that to me. Make Your Choice definitely appears to synergize with Furtive, given that it may mark the newly exposed target, which is nice at convenient.
---
Furtive has a lot of potential utility to it and, while definitely not game changing on its own, can still definitely benefit builds when used smartly.
---
bruh
---
Yo that kid's in good shape.
---
It doesn't affect everyone, but a lot of people have been getting screwed by crashes and disconnects all month.  
---
My girlfriend can't play the game without having to relaunch the game after every match, if she doesn't get disconnected first.
---
Also there’s no killer that handles SWF the way Spirit does now. That title used to belong to Nurse but after the rework she’s pretty much fallen to the wayside and been forgotten as a killer. 
---
Spirit is also confirmed in the next round of killer nerfs the devs have lines up. Only thing I can hope is that Bubba Pig Wraith Trapper Doc Plague and Legion get buffs before BHVR decides red rank diversity could look a lot better with Billy at a 100% play rate
---
Ricr Fragments? You need like 10 to gain 1 tier of the rift.
---
I just fucking hate that map. Unless you get really lucky and are able to made a three gen by the  arm in the corner and Cow Tree isn't part of the set peices on that wall Killer really struggles.
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah.
---
yeah, weird.  
---
I should also clarify, this happens at literally any time.  
---
in game, doing bloodweb, afk in lobby etc
---
Sure if you want to use it feel free. I use the illusions most if the time anyway! I feel like it's a gamble perk like slippery meat so if I was having a rough time I'd use it for sure
---
Imagine knowing it’s trapper and not immediately disarming the window trap you *know* is gonna be there
---
*consume*
---
The best part is when your both staring at each other on the opposite side of the loop. "alright man I'm just gonna keeeep shocking you"
---
Yeah, nothing we can really do except wait until the devs fix it. It's brutal.
---
Debauchery? What did you do?
---
Oh so your a cool doctor main most I go against get mad because they cant find me they'll send me hate saying that I relied on it to much and that I'm not skilled at the game because I used it against them
---
Dedicated servers just made it so both sides are pissed about the latency instead of just survivors calling every killer host lagswitchers.
---
Neat.
---
Showing respect to your opponent doesn’t change based on how the match goes. Everything you said about what gg means Under those circumstances is just your own insecurity.
---
i can confirm this. he really does take his tome while talking. he’s actually quite slow for a french reader
---
He’s creepin up on em
---
We did it boy's Noed is no more.
---
You’re gonna be waiting awhile, my dude. Pull up a chair.
---
His movement speed is 115 like most killers trapper etc. In Frenzy he's faster but not as he was pre-nerf his power gauge now also needs to recharge fully before using it again, his stun after canceling or hit a person a second time is 4 sec and your screen goes dark so you have low visibility. He was, in my opinion over nerfed, they could have stopped and left his vault speed and movement speed in frenzy the same, and just changed his addons and abuse of the chase system. His power is to punishing to use even if used successfully and to its best, whether you stab one person or 4. When people see the deep wound and hear the terror radius all they have to do is run away in a direction other then the direction of Legion and boom he is completely useless. Not to mention vault teching is an issue when in Frenzy.
---
Yea see that works with spirit with stridor, but not with survivor. You fail to realize. It doesn't matter how good you are at survivor, if you're teammates suck, you lose.
---
This is the actress?
---
The amount I want to vomit from seeing this comment would make the Plague jealous
---
Agreed
---
Smiley boi
---
Well bubba is doing the only thing he actually does well so can't blame him for that
---
Make sure to run bbq guys
---
He'd probably drop Steve lmao
---
Can you NOT omg
---
-DC as soon as you find out the killer is spirit
---
-DC as part of a Narnia juke
---
-DC because of hitboxes
---
-DC because a potato team mate is wasting pallets in the terror radius even though the killer isn't even behind them
---
Yea like I don’t wanna use NOED and blood warden but it makes it easier. I like how there’s challenges based with perks without you “needing” them. Different play style is always cool I guess
---

I believe so, yes.

It doesn't matter if Kyle says it's ok. That's not how it works.
---
Quentin =/= Kyle Gallaghner.
---
If Kyle was a Survivor, that'd be different. But Quentin is the survivor.
---
So even though Kyle said go ahead and use my face, the license holder of the Elm St remake has to give the approval to allow it.
---
And if the license holder doesn't want to deal with the reboot or Kyle/Quentin any further, they could deny it.
---
And even if they are open to it, it wasn't in the original contract. Thus a new contract has to be negotiated between all THREE parties now to allow it.
---
And any one of those three parties could not like the deal proposed by one of the others and the deal could fall apart.
---
So long story short, just because Kyle is cool with it doesn't mean BHVR is free to do it.
---
It still may never happen.
---
This will always bug me. This scene happens when his vision is now fixed by the spider bite. He sees blurry with glasses, clear without. But the format is already known as this so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Real talk it would be cool to have a charm creator mechanic like how call of duty has emblems.
---
When I sent in my ticket they said they’re looking into it and are working on a fix. That was yesterday at 3 pm lol
---
Thanks. I wanted to put gummy eyeballs and stuff in it but i couldn't find them in stores in time.

Natalia is actually very wholesome person!

Now you just need to get a tan

Amazing bro! 10/10

i like that its in a shape of a eye
---
If that's the case then F--- DBD for that server, cause it was trash.
---
I literally watched people hitch/loop in the same spot over and over, then suddenly fast forward across the map.
---
Isn't it on the shrine this week?
---
If I had one, I'd post it.
---
It was real bad.

Devs said that they balanced rift progression in the way that you will need to play about 1 hour per day to complete it at the end.
---
Oh no, he wasted a whole 2 min of your life. Someone arrest him.

I was expecting a lot of negative downvoted comments, so I volunteer as tribute... Downvote me so that when people scroll down, they only see this post as the downvpted post!

No, they’re locked until specific dates.

---
They've changed the shrine once before and this one has bbq for the first time ever, im convinced they changed it as a halloween. treat.
---
Teachable and it's near useless anyways. So not really a great argument.
---
I only say the last one as a joke when the someone dcs on the loading screens and it just ends the game
---
I simply do not believe you at all. I find that quite literally impossible if not completely improbable
---
Yeah I'll just ignore them like the bot they are next time. Good idea.
---
That happens sometimes, that sucks. Just move on.
---
no gg but wp
---
People may hate it but this is kinda why we won't see DC punishments ever.
---
SWF is basically ton of free perks and a massive advantage with comms, saying your friends suck does not change anything as they would suck solo as well.
---
You mean chaotic stupid!
---
I legit was brainstorming ideas for killers, and started to write something for a vampire, then found this post. Here is what I came up with so far as a rough idea. I think it would be cool to have a killer kind of turn a survivor to your side, but nothing op.
---
The map would have a day and night cycle.
---
The killer could have the ability to infect one survivor at a time as a vampire by biting them. The infected survivor would then have to feed on another survivor during the night cycle by biting them which would cause one health state of damage to the receiver of the bite, but cure the survivor of the infection. If they fail to cure themselves after the night cycle ends, they will be put in the dying state.
---
Just a note, while situational, Wake Up isn't completely useless.
---
1) It definately helps during EGC when the hatch was closed on you and getting a gate open fast is your only shot.
---
2) It completely counters Remember Me. You ignore the debuff that Remember Me gives when using Wake Up. So it can be good for that.
---
3) Wake Up is helpful to the group as it allows one person to get a gate open faster and show the rest of the team which gate is being opened and where it is. Which when a killer is chasing them, can be a life saver and let others all congregate there and body block for them.
---
1 and 2 are obviously situational benefits but Wake Up can still be a useful perk.
---
It's certainly not one of the better perks by any means but it's not a worthless perk either. And it definately falls in line with being a team helping perk.
---
Vigil however is absolutely useless trash. And Pharmacy is only good when running chest builds.
---
But Wake Up has its uses.
---
I used to run it a lot and it helped my SWF team on many occassions. But obviously i did eventually drop it after awhile for better perks.
---
Happened once to me, unfortunately I was survivor. Was playing against Myers too.
---
Answer me this, do you negotiate with terrorists? I don’t. The end.
---
I know they said that the switch is being delayed but does anyone know if we are getting an extension on the event/rift. Or do we switch players get chipped on the amount of time we have with these events?
---
Did you just make a Shut Up and Jam Gaiden reference?
---
i literally just got facecamped by a bubba-  
---
good costume, btw.   
---
mask looks awesome.
---
thank you!
---
Thank you!  Sorry about the face camp, I’m certainly not *that* kind of bubba
---
I played pig and thought it was kind of op. Maybe I’m wrong, is the consensus that pig needs to be buffed?
---
This isn’t about rank. I’m really just wanting to support small streamers who play DbD. I just dislike being called a stream sniper just because of that.
---
Looks great!!
---
They also instantly removed ruin after less then 24 hours, so take your pick
---
Say no to drugs
---
Big old press X to doubt
---
Well, I may or may not be right in this regard because of dedicated servers, but it used to be the killer could run shitty internet which would make everything super hard to do because of lag.
---
Why aren’t more people commenting on this!
---
Bingo. Just blow it. You'll get it back quickly anyway.
---
Everytime I escape, I always say "thanks for the hatch/door :)" and the replies are funny
---
Is it really so easy for you that you cant believe that not everyone does that? lol
---
Unnerving Presence
---
When the killer purposely fucks their internet by downloading shit so that the survivors have bad connection while they still have a really good connection
---
No it’s bait it’s haunted grounds
---
lol the last 10 seconds fking got me weak.
---
Pretty damn cool!
---
While the is true, it's more often than not unnecessary. It requires you to be the first one on a gate, and it requires the gates to actually be powered. It is also overlooked by another team supporting perk, Leader. Leader boosts opening speeds by 25% which can not only negate Remember Me, but still open the gate a tad bit faster. 
---
However, combining both Wake Up and Leader makes for a hilariously fast open speed.
---
I'm curious to know how you felt about some of my suggestions tho.
---
Does everyone in America live in bloody Mansions.
---
Because he went to a Halloween party and they ran out of shots so had to improvise
---
Honestly..thats pretty good face matching. Usually the AI is non existent in these things. This matched the face shape to someone close, so...
---
This &lt;3 I'm glad at least someone has intelligence in this pit of salty losers.
---
No one has narnia juked me yet that seems funny as hell
---
Everyone asking where clown is but what about my BUBBA?
---
It's not that I DC often it's that I simply don't believe  Anyone has ever gone there complete time playing a game without doing it unless they are brand new and even then after about their 1st month it's had to have happened at least once and I don't believe anyone who claims they've never done it

Terminator franchise from best to worst:
---
- The Terminator
---
- Terminator 2: Judgement Day
---
- Wayne's World
---
- Last Action Hero
---
Same here, suppposally they are working on a fix
---
Then they'll just AFK after getting hooked and come back later
---
Omg I loved every single one of your comments 😂 who cares about size when you got a mad lad that can make you laugh
---
Did they like slug you all at the starr because you thought they were gonna farm or something like that?
---
why baby dwight cute tho
---
&gt; respect farmers 
---
Yuck. Farming games should be bannable
---
I mean yeah, if everyone is slugged and you try to find a chance to heal them rather than abandon them, you are certainly not holding the game hostage.
---
Me too. I miss when Halloween was actually enjoyable
---
Ummmm, no you're wrong. Luck does nothing to chests, thats a common misconception. The only thing that luck effects is trapper traps/hook escape %'s.
---
Ngl It looked like you were all in like the 4th grade but then I noticed the car in the background
---
Awesome, just had some Chic Fil A
---
So, about that NOED. First game since asking and I completed the challenge all thanks to NOED.
---
Whining really does solve your problems! /s
---
Anyway, I still wanna try that build at some point. Thanks for the suggestions!
---
Hilarious. "Game is survivor sided". Try playing solo survivor once in a while, killer main. Survivors have been nerfed into the ground. In 2016 killers had a reason to complain, now they don't.
---
I was fully healed on the other side of killer shack and could barely hear it. Unfortunately I didn't get any corroboration from my teammates
---
No, they're starting on Hag first
---
That's what the perks say in their descriptions, but I promise you it's not how it actually works in game. Test it yourself if you want with a friend, Stridor completely negates Iron Will. (Which is pretty bs imho, but whatever.)
---
And yes, me and my friend tested this with tier 3 of both perks. (We did it in Custom Game.)
---
Of course I spent like 5 hours playing yesterday on my day off, and now I'm back at work and won't be able to play again for a while!
---
bloody party streamers :)
---
Honestly i disagree with any "chance to add progression" luck varitions. Imagine just getting rolled even harder as killer because they brought 4 salty lips and popped a gen in 30 seconds through ruin with great skill checks.
---
Luck should start affecting chests, removing keys from the pool of increased odds too until they are reworked. Honestly just incorporate ace in the hole to base luck stat and make ace in the hole spawn multiple items in chests instead.
---
Ohhhh I’m a fool
---
Yeah I figured, I just want something that has to do with Luck. We have so many Luck offerings and they're pretty much just garbage due to how useless luck is in the game
---
Good job, man
---
I clicked it. I actually clicked on the photo. HAHA.
---
This. Needs. More. Upvotes. 
---
 It looks really good man 🔪
---
/r/uselessnobody
---
Well believe it. Not only is disconnecting a dick move in most games, and im usually the host in a lot of games, but disconnecting ruins the game for everyone ALOT in DBD, especially.
---
When do you disconnect? its not like its Team Deathmatch, where your losing until the timer runs out. You fail..you die permanently. So you just disconnect when your about to be hooked? Thats such bullshit.
---
Because Micheal is a slender build. I wouldnt cosplay as Blade as a mexican lmao.
---
And people are complaining because of dc, lol
---
Reverse bear traps? Don't think so.
---
F
---
Yeah when the endgame collapse first came out in a love stream what they said basically amounted to "you win some you lose some"
---
Its part of the rng of the game and that creates emotions and that feeds the entity
---
Ha. If I saw this irl, we would have been instant friends. Lol. Kudos
---
this is so wholesome
---
They've been live for the past month on PC and Switch i think.
---
alrightttt thanks
---
 don't think you can surprise scare most survivors like that
---
Naomi smalls who?
---
No0b3 approves
---
Only on Switch.
---
Girl FEET
---
Yup. Those are some of the challenges in part 4 of the archives. Have fun.
---
That is EPIC!

Just coming the future to say: wow you pretty much fucking called it, almost like the Devs read your theory!

Hey I like that little bra fucking Megan me missing and fucking little Nancy wheeler are really liking those tiny little bras hey maybe you need a maybe you need to pop off that little bro I'm Nancy wheeler mingfeng Meg Thompson you got tiny little tits in that tiny little brought I want to see him take off that will a bra

Damn, yeah this is noticeably bad. I've never had performance issues like this after an update.
---
I’d pay 20$ for a 3 survivor chapter
---
burger king myers
---
Yes because people ONLY cosplay people who they look like. Its not like theres any freedom to it or anything like that. Its strictly against the rules to cosplay someone unless you look exactly like them.
---
/s
---
Finally, my power for ruining toilets can get me something besides embarrassment
---
I’m so sorry this happened to you as well, it was so frustrating to go against and literally made me never wanna play survivor again.
---
They will probably change these eventually. I mean 4 gens in 1 game?
---
A blonde Dwight would be awesome and hilarious. 10/10.
---
Things should be balanced around generic game perimeters, not around a perk.
---
I do not get the auric cells too
---
"When do you disconnect. Whenever you're about to get hooked" Saying that while claiming you never DC is projection.
---
You're awfully defensive and hostile for someone who never dced ever.... Suspicious
---
He did it! That son of a bitch did it!
---
\#ّFancyNancy
---
Ironically he works in the dairy department
---
I didn't know how to make it!
---
And I shall just like You can keep telling yourself something that isn't true
---
Had a dude dc because I was apparently "the 5th person in a row to use devour hope+thrill of the hunt."
---
In your dreams Kruger. Larrys the only sole brother nibblin on them floor fingers this hallows eve. Your crispy scrotum lookin ass can file the bunions off all the busted, gout ridden piggies that Larry discards. You may be a dream demon, but Larrys the the foot fuckin boogeyman, baby.
---
The Killer: I bet they're planning to bully me...
---
The survivors: Let me borrow your beanie.
---
It honestly shows how survivor sided this sub can be at times. I swear anyone who says the killer should have left that hook never bothered to play both sides.
---
*Lerry’s
---
There's probably a weird tug of war with choosing skins for the pass. You don't want really good ones since you can sell those individually, but at the same time you need something half decent so people want to buy the pass.
---
Guess it's time to derank to 15 and bully baby killers.
---
I think it would be good if hooked survivors in the basement wouldnt show up at all when using this perk, so survivors will have to realize someone is hooked and look for him
---
Unrelenting is definitely not the worst thing you could get
---
Only saw pictures. Not video
---
Girl you Jane every night!
---
Lol menudo error, me pregunto desde cuando ha estado eso puesto asi xd
---
i thought you don't have to prestige to continue the bloodweb progress
---
Wow You even have a working bing bong. That's impressive
---
This is good wow
---
&gt;the game amazing
---
Currently the only amazing thing is the amount and age of bugs. Plus maybe the amount of monetization in an already pay to play game.
---
Me when I shock an uninjured t3 madness survivor like 10 times in a row around a loop without even bothering to hit them
---
Memes are supposed to be funny, but I am this guy and I do it all the times, this meme makes me suffer :(
---
Fuck me I'm stupid as hell!
---
I think it was ded servers being weird. I never even got the prompt for hatch, maybe on killers screen he had already started closing it.

Check out streamer Tokki, she has an uncanny resemblance sort of, to Natalie aka Nancy...
---
I think I found my answer to why I completed the challenge yesterday when I never got a 4k while it was active.
---
Useless when it removes potential bloodpoints from you. Its objectively economy wise to mori someone then to hook 2 more times and sacrifice.
---
Winning/losing wise yes it is unmatched slowdown with 0 counterplay other then "dont get caught lol".
---
Mine did nothing
---
I'm glad to see this community isn't completely toxic :)0
---
Yo is anyone noticing that they straight up photoshopped his wrinkles out? dude looks younger in this than in the movie
---
oh no please dont step on me 
---
oh nooo
---
Seen multiple people report this issue, on here, forums and discord. Hope the devs catch on fast and release a hotfix soon
---
She's ready to kill the noobs inside the exit door
---
I agree.
---
I'm still going to DC on Haddonfield, though.
---
I rarely ever win with loops like those as a killer, so I usually just take the pallet since that would save more time than committing to a loop.
---
may I ask the source of this picture
---
Made me laugh more than I should've, take my arrow!
---
Yes.
---
As a new player its hard getting used to the idea that everything is based around farming. It kinda sucks but the game is still addicting. But i wish decisions in a match were made to play the objective instead of to get as many points as possible. But for sure im gonna stop wasting 7k on these when pumping the bloodweb lol
---
Yeah I don't know what's going on. It feels particularly egregious on maps with very 'central' locations such as Mount Ormond (Which has always been shit optimization wise to be fair), Wrecker's yard (Which prompted me replying, it's getting old as hell having drops down to ~30 fps on average in the center of the map), etc.
---
It's seriously frustrated.
---
I think they do...at least I hearded it with the clown
---
looks great
---
I can tell you are running the Burger King Myers build
---
I run calm spirit, just because i like that you dont scream after killer hit you or after killer hooks you.

How many pallets did you eat my man? Also very good costume. I dig it.
---
How do you like that silver?
---
I saw more killlers DC yesterday then survivors tbh. This always happens when the Bloodhunt event starts :P
---
Just use a infinite for 2 hours
---
Lord forgive me for what I am about to do.
---
Sloppy is a great perk, especially with nurses. You don’t really need thrill of the hunt since you can just trap your totem and get that notification when someone finds it
---
Sorry I misunderstood the post, I’m pretty new to the game. Just trying to help out, sorry!
---
Is this just for level 1 of the tome or does it cover level 4 as well?
---
If you have problems with getting to hook then sure keep iron grasp on. 
---
But seeing as legion is a from one survivor to another I’d put on Ruin. Since pop you have to manually kick it. I prefer pop in general but for legion I think Ruin may be the way to go.
---
Someone should make this template but with Ash holding the Necronomicon

I clicked on the picture, then thought to myself,

"You dumbass"
---
Ggwp!
---
You look KILLER! I would be super spooked if I saw you stalking me on a gen!
---
Something so simple yet effective
---
I’d probably take it off unless you are still vrsing people that fail at skill checks. 
---
But around that area people seem to get better at skill checks. But once you are in top 6 you definitely want to change that perk.
---
Give us bloodpoints or we take your game hostage.
---
I’m kidding. Fuck em.
---
Rant? Are you sure this ain’t a shitpost mate?
---
Naw Fungoose (streamer in Aussie) even has some ridiculous wait times. Once I’ve watched a stream of him not getting a game for literally a fucking hour lol. It was interesting. 
---
So I feel sorry for ya mate.
---
Territorial imperative, ruin, nurses, and sloppy (this is a basment build) you put your portal on the top of the stairs and after you hook someone you leave and the second territorial goes off you teleport back
---
This costume is horrible. It doesn't match up at all. Disgusting cosplay.
---
You forgot 4 white spots on your right elbow
---
Eh.

Boomer teacher
---
Seems he needs a bit of cardio, so make him toon of loops

I think someone is gonna get hurt if you swing a screwdriver at them but I’m no doctor or killer
---
It's happened to me once so far but have had 3 crashes since this last update.
---
Oh rip, that sucks.
---
Hahaha Pig got me ahha "put a reverse bear trap on your own head and kill 4 survivors before it sets off"
---
"Nope. This is unacceptable" LMAO.
---
I was thinking more of a picture of this community sucking Otz's dick
---
I love that you’re being downvoted for asking why someone is running self care.
---
How dare you state this very common opinion on this subreddit?
---
Well, I hope not xD
---
Yeah I would say if you can’t get a game in 15 minutes at the max play another game and retry again. 
---
Fungoose has had some quick matches but then sometimes it’s fucking dead lol. (for clarification dead as in can’t connect to anyone)
---
Last minute hero isn't too bad.. bring borrowed time, swf and gen rush to endgame and then have friends willingly get hooked.
---
Completely repair 4 gens.  do YOU have to repair the 4 gens from 0 to 100% yourself?   If so  you are going to suffer a lot of punishment in SWF looking for incompetent killers.   If your team as a whole has to repair 4 gens while you have the perk then its no big issue at all.
---
Decisive light..  Well any good killer can stop most flashlight blinds when picking up.  Given a few matches you should be able to pull one off.   But two in a single match?  You are going to need to find a special derpy someone to pull this off and there is no misreading or confusing this one.
---
The game is speaking the language of the gods
---
I main doc at red ranks and I gotta say, the only perk worth keeping is pop. 9/10 games I run ruin, nurses, bbq and stbfl. You can run a few different builds though if you dont like this one. Pop, discordance, thana, monitor, survalence are all good options. 
---
Definitely do not use distressing. It sounds good on paper, but it's actually really terrible. Especially on doctor. You'd think it would be good because of the bp and terror radious being doctor and all but it's actually quite bad. If you replace anything definitely replace distressing. Also I dont recommend overcharge either.
---
Damn
---
This should be posted on Cringetopia
---
Resorting to insults now are we? Okay. This conversation is over. You're clearly butthurt I called out that everyone does it and you're being defensive and projecting because you don't want to admit to it. You are everything wrong with this community right now so you're going on the block list. Have a nice day, get some cream for that sore loser ass of yours
---
I think disconnects should be punished with -2 and not - 1
---
I’d run 
---
Save the best for last ( you can use shred on obsession in order to not lose tokens)
---
Ruin (because yes)
---
BBQ
---
And maybe a pop goes the weasel to stop the gens from progressing
---
You can also place portals near gens to quickly teleport after hooking someone
---
Charms
---
This pallet is way to unsafe.
---
Did you bing bong?
---
It's in the known issues my dude.
---
There's a lot of stuff, i recommend taking a look at the patch notes.
---
I LOST Kreygasm
---
Honestly I'd prestige to ditch Discordance 3
---
This has to be a troll lol she is honestly even better
---
Actually look like Steve in the face, nice.
---
Ok so wait , isn't distressing better for increased terror radius in treatment mode and monitor bad for decreased terror radius ? I'm confused
---
I always say gg. And if there like is a big rank difference. I go "gg man you played well sorry about bad matchmaking ranks."
---
What is OoO
---
Should have added crows
---
So it seems to perfectly match a tier 4 rift challenge reward.
---
Maybe explain how she is better because as far as I can tell the only difference is the blinks needing to recharge which is a huge nerf especially on console where getting good with her is extremely difficult already.
---
Do you have a link for it ? Cause tried to find it but couldnt
---
Is that your girlfriend playing spirit?
---
I have no idea why this made me laugh so much
---
Speaking of sizes, we have different sized lockers... and they look more random to me.
---
And 1?
---
I'v made it a habit to watch whatever show im into while in queue. Sometimes I get through an entire episode before I get a game.
---
shes faster and by the time your fatigue ends you already have the charge back plus her addons are strong as fuck. it is only a nerf to ppl who always use a lot of blinks and if that is the case they are not very good nurses anyway
---
Please look at the sub before you post, there have been 30+ posts on this and you’re adding to the spam

And I’m telling you to grow up. It’s not the end of the world. Move on.
---
What
---
Yup yup same! It happened to me when I was pressing left and right trigger to cycle through levels in the rift and switched back to the tome accidentally, I cannot get it to happen for the second or third times though.
---
Sadly you do not keep progress. Thought it would since it makes you sign into your Xbox profile on the Microsoft store. /:
---
If you stab me, I'm disconnecting. :^)
---
I like this idea

Its on the main page. Just look

All platforms were blessed with BBQ&amp;Chill except the Switch. They said it will be fixed soon.
---
And I was in a bubbling mood yesterday
---
It changed for everyone probably due to an error. 
---
Or the one we got at first was next weeks.
---
The best luck is that you don’t unhook yourself and just die in first hook while versing spirit
---
Maybe I'll get some hair gel and do it up, I did that last year but :shrug:

Assuming you can get into 10 matches within an hour.

Same that's what I do most of the time.
---
so if i buy bbq and chilli its fine and it wont get taken off me?
---
sorry very paranoid
---
Naughty boi
---
I did. Basically she is add-on dependent now. Really disappointed. There was no reason for this at all.
---
Simple, Just learn nurse and whoop their asses.
---
I would love one.
---
I have a killer who targets me specifically. If they're online I literally just can't play survivor because there's so few people in red ranks and I'll get paired with them often. Iriheads or prayer beads or some shit like that, camps me specifically, hits me on hook until I die or slugs me for 4 min
---
It's fine the teacher was strapped up.
---
Maybe she can Relift pallets that were dropped during a chase ? Or maybe she can put things on fire like pallets, gens &amp; lockers ?
---
Wait... That Wrench... THAT WRAITH IS A SPY... or is he an engineer?
---
Dude, this is amazing!
---
Your problem is that you're ranking up too far and the game is trying to lower your rank so you don't play killers that are too good for you. Not even joking. There's no rules for high rank killers and if you're mad about this or haven't figured out how to unhook someone getting camped then you ranked up too fast. Coming from a rank 3 every killer tunnel camps. They all come straight back to the hook. Better have DS
---
I want him to vault into my *mouth* at tier 3 speed
---
My boi no matter who it is or how big anyone is everyone that wears a Micheal costume is *HOT*
---
1. She did need a nerf. She completely ignored so many gameplay mechanics to such an extent that good Nurse players are absolutely unbeatable.
---
2. The nerf is not game-breaking. Just wait a moment before trying to blink again.
---
3. Some new add-ons make her somewhat more consistent with other Killers and less dependent on her console-unfriendly blink. I hadn't used Nurse since March 2018, as I found learning her intolerable, yet I enjoy using her ultra-rare that ups her movement speed to 4.2m/s
---
Ty
---
You'd think that would be the case right? I thought so as well but it turns out having a bigger terror radious is only good for the very beginning of the game. Making the survivors scream in the beginning is easy with the distressing but you dont want a huge radious because the higher rank you are, people play way more smart and giving people that extra notice you are close will make them hide. The smaller radious with monitor is good on doctor because they have less time to react to you being close by. Doc doesnt need the terror radius because hes already great at tracking. 
---
This is just my opinion though. I've found way more success NOT using distressing. 
---
I used to run ruin, distressing, thrill and bbq for the juicy blood points but yeah it's not good lol
---
She's still the better without addons than any other killer is with them...
---
How suvivors get 8000 in survival anyway?
---
You get rift fragments for XP (simply playing the game).
---
I would wear it proudly.
---
Honestly I only run Borrowed Time at low ranks because of this.
---
New killer comfirmt
---
The animation and sound effect mane no sense that's for sure
---
I wouldn't use them I save them and try to search chests for them in game you'll find them in chests rather than lose them go find more in game

God damn it I never get to the good ones in time
---
What about "ggs" ?
---
If this isn't make for fun you really nees to question yourself, the nerf was annonced like a month ago, plus when you open the game the first thing that appear is the Patch Notes, plus she is still the best killer in the game or tied with spirit, doesn't matter that you are on console, she is still stupidly strong
---
No one has the balls to tackle shirtless Myers
---
I only do it when the killer got a 4k
---
People are probably almost done with rift by now so youll see alot of ebony moris coming out to complete it faster
---
Sloppy butcher is a must have on legion imo. Legion excels at injuring multiple survivors so I'd put sloppy and maybe even thana as well. Will definitely help slow the game down. 
---
My legion build is sloppy, thana, nurses, and bbq. Bbq can be swapped for pop or anything else really but I like the blood points.
---
You usually don't want to get stunned as legion so swap enduring and iron grasp because its really situational
---
A lot of people have made this point, which I don't understand.
---
As long as survivors don't make the mistake of vaulting back over the pallet, towards the husk, then the killer (by phasing but standing still) has achieved nothing.
---
As soon as you realise the killer is phasing, a competent survivor will walk AWAY from the husk towards the next loop.
---
Am I fucking stupid?
---
I think by not getting hit and surviving. Could be wrong though.
---
Want.
---
escaping as obsession
---
Lol no, but it’s a bug that is affecting people that finished the first tome. Everyone’s been talking about it on the sub.
---
Pepega
---
Yeah if you complete the first tome it currently bugs to book IV.
---
When you have to take 3 extra hits to take 1 extra hit 🤔
---
Wants to give him more teenagers, you have to grow up big and strong Jason!
---
This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
---
Doctor: hee heee
---
She would only be able to lift if it was in her view.. &amp; she can still be stunned of course .
---
Yo you broke that doctors ankles lol
---
Oh okay. It's worked for me. But you must be right =3
---
If nurse is s what is spirit?
---
Ummmm where is shirtless daddy Myers?
---
I just finished the first tome. Took two days using the best killers (spirit, billy). Props to you for being a nurse main on console! Not easy being a nurse main. And yea with the nurse nerf and the insta heal nerf, nobody uses burse on console so its literally just a nerf to insta heals for the console players. Im on xbox as well and yea it mile take more than a few games to do some of those those.
---
Bing bong your life is now gone
---
This is so bad its good
---
You're still a douchebag if you dc vs Spirit. People on this thread like to pretend that it's impossible to win vs her, and even if she was anywhere close to unbeatable, it still isn't an excuse to waste the time of 3 other survs and a killer
---
Probably hiding a tombstone pizza under there.
---
SFW who think they are gods at the game when in  reality they can't do shit alone
---
Yeah, better scrap the game because an entities realm doesnt make logical sense
---
Survivors all having enough mechanical knowledge to repair broken generators isn't logical
---
Demogorgon isn't logical, remove it.
---
Cant really use logic to justify or discount anything in this game...
---
r/blessedimages
---
I've had this happen to me. It's just a visual glitch, you haven't been softbanned. You're probably just having bad luck with killer matchmaking or whatnot. Don't worry about it
---
Thought this was a gif.
---
I want reverse beartraps to not be completely useless when survivors gen rush and get all the gens done before you get 4 downs.
---
Another doctor main here, honestly use what you want. The Doctor has so many other tools at his disposal that Calm spirit isn't that big of a deal. In my opinion nothing is really toxic if you earned that perk/offering/item/addon. Really just the people are toxic.
---
What is the pallet made of?
---
Consider Surveilance or discordance instead, doesnt rely on survivors missing a skill check when they rarely do at higher ranks.
---
I don't think it's downvote worthy, I'm not mad that I got killed over a mori, I'm more so just wondering why people would use a mori during bloodhunt when you can get so many more points by dragging the game out and hooking people more. I also have the unfortunate luck of always getting people who BM when they do mori me so that might be why it's a bit frustrating
---
I'll admit that if there's a streamer in my lobby I leave their stream open on my phone. Not to streamsnipe them but to watch their reactions when I do something cool or stupid

"DeDiCaTeD sErVeRs WiLl FiX tHiS"

both lines are talking about different things, "permanently" is meant to mean "you cannot remove it manually".
---
"for a set amount of time" meaning... well... basically the charm slot is temp locked.
---
It took me a few seconds but holy crap is this the funniest thing I've seen all day! 😂
---
I dream Myers as a dadd- I mean baddie! But this works just fine too
---
What do you want me to say??? You just uploaded an end game screenshot
---
How old is this video?

No
---
Have to be obsession, and either unhook yourself or DS killer and escape
---
&gt;only to see that charm on their body
---
Implying that anyone sees / looks at other people's charms lmao
---
Oof, you were 100% out of range.
---
Killers have priority in closing hatch. So if you both try to interact with it the Killer always wins.
---
Speaking from experience you start breathing like Mikey after a few minutes of chasing those pesky survivors with that mask on.
---
They are just another way of milking the whales for BHVR.

You didn’t have to say anything lol, I’m sorry I was sharing something I was happy with on a suited subreddit?

Because on the other side you have SWFs that will loop you without end, Tbag you and bully you unless you play top meta. 
---
In my games yesterday I constantly faced groups that genrushed me, looped me with Object of Obsession, teabagged me and used purple addons on flashlights or toolboxes. Dstrike,Borrowed Time and whatnot. And when yoh manage to kill them they whine about it. All they want is that you help them get BPs but don't kill them. It gets old. 
---
I used Plague with fun perks one game without trying to tunnel or camp once. Got murdered and then "why so ez?" in the chat.
---
So some killers get pissed and fight fire with fire.
---
It takes years for someone to develop a proper taste for cringe. Where they still dislike it, but they know good from bad.

Haha nah you’re the only one

At least don't teabag him o.o

The nurse was way too strong. I could get 4ks in the first 5 mins. I think that these changes will help balance her out as getting 4ks that easily becomes boring.

Because the exact same behavior on the survivor side. You also have a huge influx of SWFs during Bloodhunt, who want to bully the killer to get BPs but still want to survive. 
---
A lot of people don't give a fuck about those extra BPs because if you run BBQ+use a few event hooks you get a buttload of BPs anyway.

I play red rank killer and can approve this! I mean, what the hell is wrong with people at red ranks? I kill all four survivors before a gen even pops because they couldn't find ruin....
---
Dedicated Servers will probably fix it. Probably. When ever the fuck they come out.
---
mmm yes, lemme unlock my lore bits which are locked behind an around 10 day timer
---
Good Job!
---
Call me dumb, but I don’t quite understand
---
Quick to judge that everyone who opposes your opinion is a ‘baby camping killer’. The fact is, you put a post up probably expecting upvotes and comments complimenting your “godly play” but that doesn’t seem to be the case lol
---
Yeah, I always feel better after I get surrounded by 3 people and get manhandled. Tends to stop the bleeding
---
Yeah, they probably got carried to red ranks in SWF.
---
I know that happened to me. I’d play with friends, just do the game, have a couple laughs and then go to the next.
---
Didn’t take long for me to get to red ranks. Only problem was that when I’d play solo at that point, I was not at all prepared. You get better and learn, but the system is a bit broken in terms of boosting people who do SWF.
---
Agreed. You learn so much as a solo survivor. SWF get it way easier.
---
The only comment that matters
---
Happened to me as well, played with no add ons so I don’t think that matters. Probably the daily is just broken.
---
No. They nerfed insta heals.
---
No. It's 2 weeks...
---
I'm only playing survivor when I'm playing with my friends and my experience  playing against a Nurse is. You have 2 Nurses. The one is good but you can win. The other Nurse is deleting the whole in 2 minutes. So maybe he was to strong
---
no? you get it from the pass it is for the full pass
---
The heartbeat was the clapping of asscheecks all this time. My whole life was a lie!
---
Scraped off like Playdough.
---
How do you submit tickets for bugs and where do you go to do it?
---
I live near London, my ping to this match was 19. The killer was from Paris, so I can assume they had around 50-60 ping.
---
If the killer isn't the host anymore, why is this happening? Why am I being punished for *their* latency?
---
The frequency of which this is happening is increasing by the day.

Eh I like it, it's cute and small.

Don't listen to anyone that commented here... It's only two weeks that we have able to get the serum, the Rift stays open 70 days and the serum you COLLECTED will stay around until then. But you can't earn more after two weeks from yesterday... So now you know and so does everyone else.

The PASS lasts 70 days. The SERUM and the EVENT lasts 2 weeks.

If that's true, that's too bad. As someone with a full time job, there is no way I can get to tier 50 in two weeks. Oh well, as long as I can get enough for one full outfit, I will be happy.
---
Video won't play, what happened?
---
I love to think that if you dc, all your characters will have this charm stuck on their customization for the next couple matches so everyone else will know you're that guy.
---
mind sharing a link of the devs saying we have 2 weeks to get the serum? cause as far as ik and almost everyone on this sub it is for the whole 70 days and the event has nothing to do with it
---
Im playing in Switch and besides the Missing Charakter it runs fine and I think its an good Idea getting it on Switch. A friend of Mine comes often to my place with his Switch so we can Play together while WE are sitting next to each other.

Pretty nice what the Switch makes possible :D

True :(

that is low-key fucking amazing!
---
Then make it an emblem that just takes up most of the torso of the player.

This post now has a new meaning: you see the object but they don’t see you so you get to tunnel the shit out of them and fuck them over

And that is not to mention the party lobby (with friends) which gets bugged around 1 out of 3 matches

Not to do with this meme, but the fact that teletubbies are like 10 ft in real life haunts my nightmares

I reset my Xbox every time I turn it off, so that doesn’t work

It’s difficult to relearn her add ons some are meh some are great I prefer using none always have but the worst thing is people who don’t want to relearn it they have just swap to spirit which is about a 95% chance of a 4k game oh and disconnections.xbox btw
---
I swear to God dude this game is so broken, this is the fucking bullshit reason why I can't stand this game, abusing these stupid broken ass infinites. Like seriously devs what the fuck are you guys doing, my fucking god, can this shit get any fucking worse.
---
It’s extremely easy to rank up as survivor.
---
I have no idea what you're referring to

On Xbox she wasn’t omega blink didn’t work well as it was so inaccurate it put you like 30 feet away but it’s ok all can be relearned.

During the bloodhound event, I usually do this when I see a baby survivor, a survivor that isn't toxic and actually plays well or when 1 or 2 of his teammates die. What I do let them stun me, blind and sometimes I even let them escape through the door.
---
Hehe nice
---
Ranks, I mean ranks.
---
 these challenges are quite hard tbh

They wouldn't get extra money from that so it won't happen.

---
So long as they're within 8m of you, or were within 8m in the last 15 seconds.
---
I got it in the first try, as trapper, killed three survivors (throughout all the match), before killing the third i collected traps and put 2 in each gate (one in front of the open panel and the other one around there), while doing that i tried to find the hatch (since there were only 2 left and they had 3 gens), killed the third survivor, closed the hatch and went and downed the last one (whom i left in the ground to its dead, to which i apologized after the match, since it made the match longer for no reason other than the challenge)
---
It’s happening to everyone I think
---
Did it pretty easily without NOED. Just have to play normally and hook people before so they are primed and die when you hook them. Apply enough pressure during the game, not everyone runs Adrenaline and some people are injured when they open the gate. Don't be afraid to hook/kill people sooner, if you reduce survivor numbers it will be much harder for them to coordinate during endgame collapse when they are 2 instead of 4.
---
I did it my first try as Bubba, Just Facecamped someone in basement.

More like Burger King Myers!

ez game fucking noob camper uninstall game
---
Yea bit if you use spine chill, which imo is god tier, you can juke her or any killer easily. Also iron will is very good.
---
They did update it. If you go to his power information it clearly says Evil Within 1 grants the Undetectable Status Effect. No where in game can I find anything that says he trumps detection abilities anymore.
---
* Screenshots highlighting unbalanced matchmaking (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
I think they meant it as 4 good solo survivors playing together.
---
Ight, I have egg on my face
---
Because this game is not a competitive game ? If you want a true matchmaking , look at identity v where only the top 20-30 players can reach the highest rank
---
Oh no nothing related to dead by daylight

You’re actually amazing for getting all these links. I rate that.

Wow bro amazing costume. Are you running Insidious?
---
It’s fucked, worst thing is a laggy huntress as their hatchets are laggy af. Needs to be sorted
---
you made this man so ashamed he deleted
---
Tbh,  on console, you have to go out of your way to message players and most of the time it’s feels unnecessary. Just move on to the next game..
---
Imma level with you, doing that will make every killer busted for no forseeable reason, several ALREADY have some pretty big balance issues in niche scenarios, now just imagine what a spirit level Bubba would look like?
---
There is no argument that Billy and Spirit are overtuned if not OP while killers like Clown, Trapper, Huntress are pretty damn balanced with some exceptions.
---
Shrek outfit for The Shape should be added.
---
Oh is it only Xbox I thought it was for everyone
---
It's simple, they are probably under a lot of pressure right now. The game has been very buggy and the community has been toxic about it. Especially with the event not coming out on time. They just simply made a mistake, it happens to everyone.
---
There’s a difference between tunelling and getting out a weak survivor early. If they’re able to hook you 3 times and you hit DS without all gens being done, you’re the problem. If someone goes for an unhook and a survivor isn’t great I’ll slug them for pressure.
---
Since we are on the subject of tips for challenges: the one for the Killer where you have to kill 4 survivors in one match? Counts if someone’s dc’s during the loading screen and the match is cancelled lol.
---
Really DC on a mori , but when you gen rush with 4 ultra good tool boxes it’s fair ..... yeah that’s how much one sided you are
---
Yeah ikr? I think with this update they (the devs) have either fucked the matchmaking or they're testing an algorithm they have built for the dedicated servers that they're testing.
---
Yes, dedicated servers are still on right now, I know it's like braindead to blame them, but maybe devs are testing a matchmaker for their proper implementation.
---
Where are u lmao
---
It's 37°F here
---
Spine chill survivors: Pathetic
---
Basement
---
Wrong
---
yeah same usually small loops like this one kills can easily force you to throw it by not respecting pallet, and the pallet becomes pretty much useless after because if you stay at it they just mind game you and get a hit eventually not long after hahaha. I don't know what she was doing, but it made for a nice little clip.
---
to get hit I think
---
based
---
Damn trapper got butt injections
---
he just stood still for more than 3 seconds
---
You know you can knock someone down after all the gens are done and open the gate yourself then hook right? It’s how you can force bloodwarden too.
---
Calm spirit cant save you if you're one of those that bomb rush a hook, its good for avoiding the doc altogether, but if he sees you he *will* chase you and *will* get you to M3 if possible, and at that point the illusions are way better pointers than screams.
---
this has been for over month for me on PS
---
Hey im also a doc main in training, why not use noed?
---
imagine fixing a gen and then you see these 2 in front of you
---
The first Trapper challenge is actually doable.
---
Trap all survivors, then trap yourself.
---
r/oinkers_
---
You get all stuff from before tier.
---
pls BHVR make this real.
---
Higher rank Trapper, huh? I saw a Trapper main on this sub saying at red ranks they run a pretty oppressive 3 gen strat.
---
Pick 3 gens in close proximity and decent location. Lock them the fuck down with traps and patrolling. Yeah, they'll probably get the other 4 while you set up, but then you turn the tables.
---
Trapper's set up time is always tricky against a team that is focused purely on gens.
---
I'm on my way back to red ranks to and I thought it was potentially useful info.
---
I like to do this when I play DbD on my brother's PS4, I can't do it on my PC sadly.
---
*Laughs in calm spirit*
---
Aaaaand you ruined this wholesome moment
---
Gen rushing is not a thing. It is you applying too less pressure. Try a different build or different addons. Watch otz if necessary
---
Thanks :)
---
You get all the stuff before. Be wary it does give you in store dosh but you lose 25 cells every time you level up on the premium line after that. Not sure if you do everything and then buy if it just gives you everything or makes you claim to go to the next level in the chain 🤷‍♂️
---
It's sad that this guy got twice as little upvotes than the guy that photographed the wall saying it's a wraith cosplay. Comedy over actual effort?
---
Killer probably had a lag spike and since everything is coded client sided on this game, you died in an unfair way.
---
How it works:
---
Vaults, just as pallets, seem to be broken in the sense that the hit detection is coded client-side, which means killer-sided as he is the one hitting.
---
Now that the devs added servers, the problem became even bigger because of this.
---
Just an exemple: Before when the killer was host (he was the server) :
---
Survivors had a certain latency to the killer, let's say a decent one 80ms. It meant that all of survivor's action (which include vaulting, dropping pallets,...) were registered 80ms later on killer's screen, meaning he can hit you in that time-frame. And if he does and the hit barely connects on his screen, it will register, whereas on survivor's screen it cleary didn't connect. And it was with good ping exemple, the more latency the survivors had to the killer (whether it's just distance, survivor connection or killer connection), the more unfair it was for them.
---
Now with current dedicated servers: when I connect to the closest server, I always have 70ms stable latency. Let's say the killer has around 80ms latency, my position and my actions are registered on the dedicated servers in 70ms, and these informations are sent to the killer 80ms later, which means he receives all my actions 150ms after I actually do these, 150ms where he can hit me freely if he's close and we're going for a vault or a pallet drop. This is two time worse than what it was with killer hosting. And same here, the more the latency one or both party have, the more killer is rewarded and the survivor is punished for this, just as it was with killers hosting but to an other extent as both latencies are stacked together in killer's favor this time. Also lagswitching, even though very rare and happening way less often than what people claim, is still possible because of all this.
---
The only solution is indeed dedicated servers but with server-side hit detection, and I hope they will implement it soon enough. Whether they decide to do the whole swing animation server-side (as in F13th), or let the swing animation client-side but still do the hit-detection server-side, it will be perfect.
---
Current situation:
---
-if both killer and survivor connection are good, it is mostly decent experience for everyone, not a lot of unfairness, just a bit on the survivor side (although with current servers and stacked latencies, survivors are facing way more unfairness).
---
-If survivor has a poor connection, he's punished for it and it's OK. I don't think it's unfair.
---
-If the killer has a poor connection, the survivor is also punished for it and it is extremely unfair for him.
---
Situation with with server-side hit detection:
---
-if both have good connection, it is the best experience, no unfairness at all, latency is always a thing so some hits that may look like hits on killer screen won't register, some hits that don't connect on survivor screen will register, but usually fair for everyone, and especially, it is no side favored.
---
-survivor bad connection = survivor punished with far away hits.
---
-killer bad connection = killer punished with hits that don't register.
---
-most lagswitch usage not possible anymore.
---
That's why the server-side hit detection is the best solution. It is way more fair and should be the way to go. But who knows when they will implement this.
---
It's because if you do something bad then they can't identify who did it because of the mask.
---
Uhh what? What do you mean you lose cells
---
Laughs ins basement Hag
---
Ill try to do that, thanks for the tip :D
---
No it wasn't. Now you have to give us the 2v8 mode. xD
---
And how exactly can I apply pressure with a trapper?
---
But they're still testing them. So i guess it will get better. It's not easy to get them right considering dead by daylight wasn't made for dedicated servers.
---
Bought the mask from Funworld but made the rest myself

That might have been me. Do you happen to play on Xbox?

Of course I could play a basement trapper or proxy camp to pressure but thats scummy and boring for both parts.

Just trap them, 4head. Easy.

Eh no, i'm pretty sure that it was data-mined.

---
It could also been caused somehow by the engine update. The fact that it isn't mentioned in the patch notes makes me wonder, lit it's unintended and just happened as a side effect.
---
Cringe zoomer humor
---
Pressure isn't really a thing if survivors spread out on a big map and play safe at pallets early.
---
It's extremely difficult to depip as survivor so if you play a lot it's hard not to rank up
---
If not ruin, corrupt. Can’t complain bout gen rushing if ur not running at least 1 of the 2
---
Because he had a premonition ghostface would get a 4K.
---
L-T walls you'll want one of the windows, preferably on the T side.
---
And Jungle gyms I usually go to the long loop side of the pallet in grass if available. 
---
If you get 3 gens real close to the killer shack, make sure you trap the pallet so half the trap glitches through the floor tile, and the window, this is always your best home, as a hook in the basement is almost garanteed death for someone.
---
Also, I believe you said your were rank 6? From this point on you're going to NEED a trapper bag add on for success.
---
Hope this helps, I'd say I'll see you at rank one, but we're both killers :P
---
It aint much but it's honest work
---
Damn awesome job! That cloak looks wicked cool!
---
You can't guarantee flashlight saves, even in SWF. And Unbreakable is only used once.
---
As the other guy mentioned, too much bullshit goes on this game to be trying to punish DCs, especially when first hook suiciding only takes like 10 seconds more. Window vault interactions is just one instant where this game can constantly be bullshit for both sides.
---
You just sound like a salty killer main who's been cucked out of BBQ a few times. We all been there. Just get over it. Any DC punishment will literally just translate to killing on first hook and you might get all the BBQ stacks but you'll get shit points regardless if a whole squad does it.
---
Agreed. I have an xbox and a ps4 and the achievement progress is really nice. Woulda came in handy when I needed to shock 500 ppl as the doctor and it took forever and never knew how close I was
---
Yw. I love Ghostface. And this is a really good chibi of him
---
This is so wholesome wow.
---
Least you didn't have something that happened to me, where I threw down the pallet, the killer got stunned on the other side then just teleported to my side after the stun and ended me.
---
GG = GIt gud

Yes, could you explain more?  I'm thinking of paying near the end.  Thanks

Saying the survivors are evil is like saying a rabbit is evil for escaping a hungry fox, let’s be honest here.
---
I mean they kinda do if you dc to much you get punished
---
And then obi wan continued to tbag a akin around every pallet because ani camped obi wan's mate
---
I would be fine with it but taking some durability away in %. So if you wanna use a syringe, for example, with a medkit that should heal you twice, heal you once
---
Seems fair that way. You exchange one heal for one heal but faster
---
Ok
---
I second this.
---
I agree with your comment overall, but can only think of 5 counters to bbq; hide in locker, get close, use distortion, hide behind a gen, walk one way for 4 seconds then run another. Am I missing something?
---
Corrupt over ruin for trapper
---
New syringe takes twkce as long as a normal medkit heal (or normal teammate heal)
---
It's just a combination of "None shall survive" (for the name) and "Reverent" (for the challenge itself).  
---
But yeah its name was photoshopped in or the challenge was photoshopped in.
---
U think that you used the meme wrong
---
Because they didn’t get permission
---
What did he say?
---
She looks like a granny
---
I think it unfun to play killer
---
If you played with me you would wonder why within the moments the match began like 10 seconds I would say I’m already injured, 5 seconds later I’m hooked.
---
He said “of course I could recognize her, with that gremlin face.” Awful.
---
The bottles are filled with his tears of being a s**t killer.
---
Oof
---
This is also for the people who don't have or can't afford the game
---
You forgot the tunneling part
---
Welll don’t report it or they will disable the patch and we’ll have a week delay for them to change it
---
I see people say "make it two hooks" a lot, and the real issue with that is that it's almost always faster to just hook the dude for the third time. Making up for the fact you'd be getting hit with Decisive by the whole team was really the only good reason for it before, and that's just admitting you lost preemptively in either instance.  
---
 At this point, it really is just the same as the issue with keys: Is the game trying to be competitive, or do we actually acknowledge there are offerings, add-ons, and items that are outright unfair?  
---
 These things don't make much sense in a Ranked setting, but are a lot of fun to mess around with in Customs.
---
I completed it with noed (lasted for about 2s after the down. That's why noed is useless) and dragged one guy so far away after opening a gate myself as bait
---
After the second attempt I did it. I had to literally throw the game to make sure to complete it but still, wasn't hard
---
The thing is, some challenges ruin the game for either side. Like the hook saves or run a specific perk/character that you may or may not have perks on. Like on my case for Claudette. We're stuck in it, we hope to better challenges, especially well thought ones in the next wave. For now, the next 3 "gates" are in the same way, silly
---
Did you at least BOING BOING BOING?
---
Aww, thanks! I just have to be WAY dirtier.
---
Idk, maybe to get half the amount of points killer get
---
Arghh I'm confused reading through these.  
---
What is it that ends in 2 weeks?  Just the offerings, torches etc..?  Not the Serum?
---
I would like to get all of the Halloween event cosmetics, do I have 2 weeks or 68 days?
---
Thanks
---
Two them rage quit in the first 5mins. So felt a lil generous. The entity wasn't pleased tho.
---
Almost all your rhetoric about DC concerned how it screwed over killer, not survivors. And how the hell do you flashlight a killer facing a wall? Or that's across the map from you?
---
DCs for things like that aren't that common. A lot of DCs from survivors come from killers being a dick or running unfun builds and/or just playing Spirit/Nurse. And killers are often doing one of those things so 
---
I play a lot of killer, even quite a lot of Plague who I know survivors hate going against because of the Purge, and DCs happen like 1 out of 10 games. Even top streamers don't get that many DCs when you take account how many matches they get in.
---
DCs are problem but there's 20 other things this game needs to fix before they even think about punishing players. Especially since there's no real solution to it.
---
Yo holy shit that’s really good
---
Who let the guy with the pogo stick in?
---
What’s identity v?
---
Frankly, that Doc committed Low Rank and didn't commit to anyone at all while in advantage. Playing Killer, you pretty much know that's always gonna leave a little room for somebody to grab a key. Nice of you to get the goons out with you, though. \~
---
The lack of a thiccwitch cosmetic is a crime in several countries.
---
[This](https://imgur.com/a/FBKcRl4) is a common occurrence when loading into a lobby as killer
---
Waiting for you to crouch up and down and blind me with a flashlight. Looks great
---
the event ends in the week
---
the serum lasts for the full rift days and we can keep it from 2 weeks after it ends
---
Nice cosplay. We need more survivors cosplays around here.
---
Yeh, I'd put that at the bottom of a list of things to remember too.
---
but the survivors are evil. Toxic at least lol
---
I’m on PS4 and I agree
---
I just got pissed and decided to get off and go to bed
---
Same here with another challenge.
---
Big Scooby Doo energy
---
I only run mori's when I see a flashlight in the lobby. Being blinded isnt fun. I could ask the same question...why bring a flashlight into the match during an event? To make a killers game miserable.  Ik, let me load my mori. There you have it.
---
I did that one with Freddy and no mori, had to slug the 3rd survivor just to be safe though
---
That's pretty much any "new" word that becomes trendy on the internet. But I feel you.
---
&gt;Nice way to take constructive criticism. 
---
Dude you literally bitched about me being a cry baby, so fuck off because apparently you're the only cry baby here.
---
But she’s LITERALLY edgy, because, you know, glass has edges
---
NOED, Remember Me, Blood Warden, one other perk. You'll get 'er done, compadre.
---
Yeah after that I gave up. Glad that during event and double bps I can either get into a game with a laggy camper, or can't find a game as a killer...
---
If I can say personally I haven’t run into people like that much I think once and I played like 5 pm to 5 am and only faced one Myers with tombstone if anything people are more friendly I find
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWLvmgIIWQw) is a video from Fungoose talking about his preferred Demo builds.

since this post I've seen 1 other Quentin while playing and I play almost daily lol maybe it's my internet attracting everyone else but Quentin mains

Hilarious, it’s clear this is being skewed by console players.

---
idk but dying and then spamming 'ezzzzz' sounds like the funniest way to acknowledge your own death. especially if its a stupid death like walking into the killers arms or whatever
---
BOOP
---
My Myers build is built around the perk: IF, Deerstalker, M&amp;A and STBFL + Dead Rabbit add on.
---
I have enough big terror radius to basically "see" half the map after downing someone in Tier 3. It's a nice snowball build :P

if you get wiped 95% of the time as swf, then you all suck at the game.

---
u/TheCanadianRedHood Just now as soon as I got into a game two of my teammates disconnected and instead of the killer being cool he pretended like he was going to let us go during the wiggle timer just to unhook us and hit us repeatedly and shake his head. I got 18,000 bp.
---
NOED, STBFL, Blood Warden, and Brutal Strength. Survivors will literally hate you.
---
&gt;These gunna be posted every half an hour of the next few days?

Probably, unless devs fix it. Every player will see the Tome IV upon finishing Tome I.
---
*Smokes cigarette* You wouldn't get it
---
Finished all the survivor ones, hoping to take a chunk outta killer ones tonight.
---
It's really quiet.  Are you running insidious too for maximum mind games?
---
I always say “gg wp” unless the survivors are being toxic. Then I just say “gg”.
---
Thats so cool
---
u/Kalem56 So either you've been playing the game like mentioned above or you just don't sleep. 😂
---
right - so much worse then every Mori.
---
Ok sorry for the late response, but I managed to get a store bought mask &amp; costume. Then my dad got some horns in the house and attached them with silicone. Then he painted over the mask layer by layer.
---
I had one of my random teammates chasing after crows the whole match. They didn't do a gen or try to save anyone. Good times with that match.
---
That was so wholesome.

---
Try Evil Incarnate :) 
---
I recently completed every achievement and i must say the Evil Incarnate is the hardest one because survivors just afk in lockers or DC when they realize what you're up to.
---
Cool i like it
---
They were busy or didn’t wanna do it video games weren’t in their original contract would most likely need to be paid a lot of money to say lines for the lobby thoe Bruce Campbell did say he would be up for doing more with dbd
---
Because i have nothing to add
---
u/DwightLovesGens Apparently people also think that it counts as a safe unhook immediately after the killer hooks me.
---
Very well reasoned. I guess there's no way devs can ignore this suggestion.
---
What is this bullshit.  
---
e\_e
---
I would gladly let him shove his long hard pipe up my ass
---
gG eZ BaBy SuRvIvOr
---
She’s just waiting for NOED to activate
---
I think BBQ should be "nerfed" by simply making the BP hook bonus baseline, and BBQ only being the aura reading. Do the same with WGLF and find some other effect to give it. 
---
Would reduce the grind for both sides since people don't have to bank a perk slot just for points.
---
Get any killer, attack tits, profit.
---
It's "Cleanse 8 totems" you can do it in more than 1 match.
---
Legion above Clown? What the hell?
---
The reworked med kit add-ons allow exposed players to take a hit. Could be that maybe?
---
Red rank trapper here. My setup is a bit unorthodox. I run more of a protect the gens at all costs build. Which is ruin, corrupt, thrilling tremors, and bbq. I use the corrupt time to set my "nest" with traps. Trap ruin, then go on patrol.
---
Good for you
---
My skillz just couldn't compare 😔
---
What killer were you? Some attacks don't count as exposed hits.
---
Classic bubba.
---
Is there really such challange?
---
I’m pretty sure the title is a reference but I can’t put my finger on it
---
He becomes handsome squidward and gives everyone in the mach a heart attack, thats gg
---
Damn, I love this, I personally love BHVR version of the costume.
---
mobile keyboard...
---
saddf k.
---
Thank you
---
Please stop your scaring my kids
---
My setup is your exactly but I swap haunted for corrupt intervention
---
Placing down and activating 4 portals on the unblocked gens at the start of the match can help give you a good setup and pressure in that area of the map.
---
That works cuz of my playstyle tho, I place portals right on maybe 4-6 gens and check them often, I do a lot of swapping targets but it helps apply a lot of pressure
---
gg ez baby killer
---
ive done this before, it used to be an achievement. Then they nerfed it to only require 3.
---
True. 
---
But I like the clean version and without male traits.   
---
Sometimes I think she has a very male shape and large shoulders.
---
Ohhh the anti blabla syringe thing so they have the same effect as bt? Yeah although they didn't have the same aura as when you hit someone with bt, or does it not show in the same way?
---
you're very certain for someone who's just making assumptions
---
What happens in November?
---
That one only requires they die during endgame. You can hook them and it'll count.
---
What?
---
yeah, it looks like you need to put "(JOKE)" on the title now, so people understand it... It's sad.
---
Stop double backing.
---
So just follow them until I eventually catch up?
---
I agree but he was always leaving before someone could acknowledge him about his death. Good that i stopped playing with this salty bastard.
---
Yes
---
&gt;**Permanent**  
---
&gt;*Noun*  
---
&gt;Lasting or intended to last or remain unchanged indefinitely.  
---
If Golden_spider didn't mean this, they did not mean to use the word permanently. You don't get to change the definition of a word just because what you said isn't what you meant.
---
I actually had my first survivor boop the snoot while I was playing as The Pig. Ended up letting them leave.
---
Press F to ~~pay respects~~ recover.
---
There is a tone of fake ones going around. I would take everything you see with a pinch of salt.
---
I wonder if she's into DbD. I mean, she's had to at least check it out considering her character is in the game
---
Why don’t more people use Infectious Fright?
---
Yep. And dont respect pallets.
---
Ok thank you
---
I also thought about doubling down on gen perks with Ruin+Corrupt, Demo has a lot of issues with early game.
---
Your playstyle is exactly how I play him. I found that you really need to apply a ton of pressure on everyone, to the point of leaving chases if you see someone back on your portals, and not give the survivors any breathing room across the map.
---
Really can screw with some team who have a dedicated guy who just wants to loop you while the rest does gens.
---
Been out since Tuesday
---
I would say ghostface is but not demo
---
It's not the worst, but it's been on my past 5 bloodwebs for huntress
---
It’s a blank wall. Not much to look at. But then I remembered that the wraith had invisibility.
---
Well at least they did something right.
---
You must be trippin if you think terminator 1 is better than Judgement Day
---
Since the event started, my FPS sometimes drop so low it hurts my eyes
---
One of the key things with loops is learning which pallets are safe or not as in which ones you can mindgame to get a hit. If the pallet is not safe you can almost guarantee a hit and don't exactly have to worry about breaking it. If it is you need to break it right away. You also need to recognize what tiles are too strong to continue chase as these will waste a ton of your time while gens are getting done.
---
It's like they've made a challange "Stand near hook for 2 minutes".
---
First of all, generally if you get looped that long, you should switch targets. You need to put pressure on as a killer, and you are not doing that. there’s so many factors that depend how well a survivor can loop you, and it really depends on the circumstances. If the survivor is throwing every pallet, try to use spirit fury enduring or brutal strength to eat through them. If the survivor is playing optimally and saving everything, you need to practice mindgaming. It’s all just about practice/trial and error. You can also get killers that have powers more adept to ur situation. Wraith has no power in chases, and billy is a very high skill. You can try a killer such as trapper and trap loops, or clown to stop how long each loop can last. I find the YouTuber/streamer otzdarva is someone you can watch for excellent tips on playing killer, if you have time for that.
---
Apparently everyone else thinks that they need to get it as fast as possible.
---
Better yet, go tell Scorpionz why he's wrong. Streams everyday at GMT, has 4k hrs in Pig. If you're confident in your viewpoint, might as well take it up with one of the beat pig players ;)
---
I see 3 pumpkins in total here.
---
Good catch btw. They deserve it every time, especially when they do this against fast one shot killers. :D
---
Thats a shame. Sounds like last years halloween event, survs only out for themselves. Problem is this is a permanent addition. Its not worth ruining games for. Ik when I get off work, Im gonna do killer and my next one is kick the same gen twice and Ill probably just farm w them.
---
Or fix matchmaking for less swf 3 mans
---
I was spirit
---
dedicated servers :D
---
&gt;gg! wp:)
---
reads more like sarcasm regardless of how the match went, but especially if it went poorly for the opposing team.
---
If it's not longer a true instant heal it should just consume the addons and leave the med kit untouched.
---
"Billy is very high skill."
---
Lol okay. Nurse and. Spirit are high skill, Hillbilly? Not really.
---
Did Nurse get pushed down by a bunch of people kneejerking about the "nerf"? She's still the best.
---
You run Enduring + Spirit Fury and always chase and swing through pallets
---
Its brainless, everyone dies
---
Don't they already do all this?

fuck.

You sound like a racist misogynistic. Stfu.
---
I would've preferred shirtless Myers tbh
---
Thanks agreed I was super surprised how fast I could pick them up oh well I guess I should dump some points on him so I can get more than one perk.
---
This is actually the 3rd time it has been on the shrine.
---
Because it is a problem? Yeah this is pretty bad too, but that doesn’t mean you can ignore another issue
---
Never seen legion standing with such straight legs lmao
---
Meh if Shape’s Pipe weapon sound effect is a “stab” what are you expecting 😂😂
---
I didn't have to know that existed.
---
I Michael Myers have a dream.
---
"New killer \[Doctor\] aims to break the game"  
---
"Similar to *popular* killer, the Trapper"
---
I mean I think overtime killers like spirit and billy will get slight nerfs here and there and weak killers will get buffed or perks will be added/changed to make new strategies.
---
I hate playing against spirit and nurse but at least with spirit if you run the right perks have a million iq you can counter her whereas nurse you can’t really in chases especially if she ran “I’m all ears”  to counter LOS block.
---
Right now it may be bad to run into spirit after spirit at high ranks and with every survivor (almost) hating vs’ing her she will get changed I feel but the devs will take her time since she’s fun to play as and I reckon survivors would love playing spirit if they weren’t forced to run the same perks to feel like they have some form of counter play to her and that’s if she’s not a high level spirit player herself to make good reads anyways
---
Best Ruin buff ever.
---
Ahhh ok I'll check him out thank you
---
Because you can DC 100 times in a row if you want. Meanwhile mori's and iri addons have a limit.
---
*laughs in console* 
---
We’ve been subject to non stop Spirits in high ranks for over a year
---
That’s awesome
---
Sorry was changing the batteries in my keyboard. What a dumb ass....... 4K match.....
---
Nurse is still top tier, though.
---
emphasis on the shitpost
---
Exactly! But then I get downvoted for giving an actual idea in a discussion from over 4.7k hours in experience, so I guess my experiences with this game mean nothing :/
---
BBQ is here in the new patch
---
Spirit is far from high skill
---
You're right. Probably only a small portion of the Dead by Daylight player base is on Reddit, plus the small amount of non-dbd players who're here either from YouTube or some other reason.
---
But I always have to think about how weird it is that most all people would agree camping sux, play fair and nice and don't DC but rarely do I go a single game without any show of toxic behaviour or disconnection from playing Legion or getting downed early. Really not cool.
---
Wait did they actually say something?
---
On LF i stick face into nearest wall with insidious and when i see yellow hook aura move i pop out and tunnel guy and mori him
---
Its hilarious.  Depips unhooker and guy who got morid 30 seconds into game
---
That sucks. I hope devs know about it :/
---
I've got his Scoops Ahoy shirt because I don't like the default shirt and it goes with his default pants and head. I have him at P2 now, half way to 1mil bloodpoints :D
---
He had to do it to em
---
I mean they all have one thing in common
---
They hate survivors
---
(And that they kill people and blah blah something)
---
Very nice. I  see legion get a lot of hate but one of my favorite killers.  :)
---
As a spirit main, I completely agree. She is a braindead character
---
Some quality stabbin'!
---
“You mess with the bing you get bong”

Well there’s a lot of killers in b tier but I don’t believe hag is one of the best. She should be high in b tier but not in a tier
---
I started at 12 and now i’m at 22. I went up against a Claudette last night who already had the new Puffer Vest, so they either bought the Tiers or they played for 24 hours non stop.
---
Cause people are arseholes
---
wouldn’t it be more effective since more survivors are injured?
---
They also confirmed doc is up next for changes. So if they do change spirit it won't be in the near future
---
Started at 9, current tier 15
---
Mine was a killer was being friendly and farming as I brung party streamers and it was bloodhunt but then he had noed and he used that on us but my friend saved me also before that I had almost finished a gate then I used DS on him then escaped
---
An Apple a day...
---
What the fuck.
---
Nurse was broken OP she needed to be needed
---
 Shock horror you might actually have to learn to play DbD not just nurse
---
If I could randomly find moris in a map, and sustain them with key rings or just take them out with me when im not using them. You can't compare an offering to an addon. 
---
You could compare it to stuff like Insta Hatchtets, Prayer Beeds, Tombstones and the like. But a key is still more readily available.
---
I have been getting mine back just fine but people have been having this issue. Submit a ticket

---
SelfCare did work!
---
Wait really? EGC sacrifices don’t count toward “sacrifice 5 survivors” though lmao
---
For some reason this makes me want to see a survivor who’s whole concept is that they actively have no hope left but only rage towards the entity, but no matter what the entity tries to do to force them to do as it demands (punishing him and such) it just makes them more spiteful and enraged at the entity and pushes them further into a desire to piss off the entity or get back at it for putting them specifically in the fog (not caring about anyone but themself and any and all altruistic actions are just to spite the entity)
---
Which is why people who use spirit buy those huge ass clothes for her and her hair style that's tucked down. You can't counter that shit because there is no tell. It just becomes a huge guessing game. Unless you just watched her phase to you, then you gotta sit there looping around and even after her phase recharges you just gotta guess. It's a 50/50 chance that you'll get away for longer than 3 seconds before the angry blue bitch is right back on you again. 
---
You can also fast vault a window and try doubling back with a slow vault while she's phasing but that only works if you're not injured. 
---
There's no real mind gaming the spirit because it's all one sided in her favor. Especially since she has player collision while phasing. Body blocking invisible blue bitch is irritating.
---
not for long, spine chill is gonna get fucked, not seeing wraith, pig, GF, etc.
---
That was proven to be false
---
Just use them and get bps for leveling her back up. Fight through the DC's 😂
---
Yeah but shes billy tier now.
---
Not really. Solo survivor is awful, never expect anything from any teamate. Be happy if you dont die on first hook. Killers are often twats like survivors however they can ruin your whole game
---
Suddenly we stan
---
Okwell its calm spirit isnt there and thats a gift to all humanity.
---
Must be the 200th thread on this
---
What? She literally kept her game breaking mechanic, she is still S tier.
---
Well with all the DC's that happen against him (Especially when he uses a jigsaw piece) I'd argue he's breaking peoples internet connection.
---
Lol she doesn't have a gremlin facr
---
Hope they still keep her a high tier killer, just much more complex to play like nurse.
---
Dont worry. I like the idea
---
Don’t
---
Yeah I was dumb and prestiged at a random time with no bloodpoints saved. Got bullied when i had no hex ruin or stall perks
---
They're reworking Doctor's add-ons, but I do not believe they're changing his power. Well then again they changed Nurse with no warning
---
If someone is looping you for that long, drop the chase and get map pressure because people are doing gens. A chase should not go on for that long, even a good one. If the survivor can loop you that long, they are letting objectives get done and it sounds like you get tunnel vision on one survivor.
---
Yes! Burn through all your good stuff and save up some BO because when you prestige, you lose everything (and gain a bloody cosmetic)
---
As a fellow chunk myself I say next time go clown, due to the fact the clown is a chunk like us and also people are usually more scared of clowns.
---
cuddling w/ their waifu
---
NNN
---
Thank you, i honestly needed to hear that. I love this game and things like this just make me want to drop it. I frequently forget you can have good experiences too.
---
That’s not accurate
---
Started at 3 and I'm up to 17 having completed all the challenges.
---
for me we'll make it should merge into WGLF
---
Somewhat, but I'm looking for the explanations like in League's: https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-921-notes. I enjoy the way Riot explains their reasoning and gives a short blurb about the changes, that way we can at least see the ridiculous reason BHVR has for nerfing Pig
---
When you need to kill survivors at 8 but nobody is guarding the intel room

wtf was that t bag. T bags are suppose to be squats, Hes not committing! Claudette can show him how its done.
---
One of the points I want to bring up from this post is the cleansing against a plague. If the killer has thanaphobia then you kind of have to. I played a match and had everyone broken but they still refused to cleanse. Made it very easy to kill them all. So if the plague has thanaphobia then cleanse
---
Was the highest like 14? I started at 4 and my brother who plays at 0 so if it was as high as 14 I can see that
---
What's sad is the Archives isn't going to be an event thing. This is going to happen from now on until people realize it's more fun just playing the game normally.
---
This is the myers skin we really wanted
---
Legion look like the little chavs who go round stealing hubcaps off cars. It's insulting even comparing them to a young Myers.
---
"What the hell happened here?"
---
Yeah lol
---
Imagine that revving towards you. I’d shit my pants!
---
Well, Ash at least had some lines of dialogue.
---
I don't think it *really* matters if we had Joe and Natalia voice grunts, groans and screams for Steve and Nancy.
---
They said there were looking into reworking nurse and her addons a year ago.
---
What are you trying to do? Make me fail NNN on the first day?
---
Currently at 24
---
Just run spinechill, now you win the game as the killer can never catch up to you
---
And I'm not even considering buying it until I basically get through most of it first.
---
they did not say that doc was next, just that they were working on him.
---
Yeah that is fucked up. I think the wraith is just being an asshole. (But your teammates were waiting for you to get hooked)
---
I am not looking forward to Escape with Spine Chill without being hooked. There will be a surge in useless blendettes running Spine Chill, Urban Evasion, Distortion/Sole Survivor, and Left Behind simply waiting for everyone else to die to grab hatch. If they get found, they'll DC.
---
I didn't say flashlights were overpowered,  I said they are annoying. As such, I mori away.
---
Been out since Wednesday morning my dude
---
I'm rank 6. Is that still considered low?
---
I think Legion was just put in time-out until they could make them a real killer.
---
Thats the moment when my life flashes before my eyes.
---
Well clearly people don’t see I was joking. Whatever
---
&gt;30?? Have you finished all the Challenges yet?
---
Unfortunately, yes. Now I have to wait until Tome II, on November 14th.
---
Yes they did, on the discord server. I was there when they said it
---
This should be considered spam at this point.
---
It's also out accidentally. The shrine had ruin before the archives patch dropped and reset it again.
---
Same can be said for Plague if her vomit changed color.
---
After the first interaction with it you know.
---
Actually no, does it really take 20 mins? Thats odd
---
Suck at the game like me
---
personally, I like either prove thyself/bond/BT(just in case I need to trade hooks for a teamate)/spine chill or a meme stealthy build like dance with me/lithe/quick and quiet/spine chill or the sprint burst/ spine chill/ lightweight + any other good perk
---
I timed it. 16 minutes 42 seconds seconds lol
---
Damn is Tome II confirmed to be 2 Weeks away? Was hoping for it to release earlier..
---
25
---
did you read what i put, if she got corrupt it would still be red, but just glowing, its still clear that red = bad, and the infection on objects and humans can stay green
---
I got a 4K running an endgame doctor build during the collapse. Blood Warden, NOED, Remember me, Bitter Murmur. Down someone, wait for the door to open or open it manually, hook to block the doors.
---
You can also get a 3K, shut the hatch to trigger the collapse, then find the 4th and sacrifice him.  
---
But yeah it's not that bad. There are harder ones which require you to use NOED.
---
Either way I'm doing full endgame builds for these challenges.
---
When I spawned into the map as a Survivor for the first time, I pulled down the first pallet I saw, cause I thought that the Killer would be blocked from using that path for the rest of the game.
---
I also didn't know you could do a long lunge as the Killer until a few weeks after I got the game :P
---
&gt;Damn is Tome II confirmed to be 2 Weeks away? Was hoping for it to release earlier..
---
Unless they postpone it, yes. The info is in-game, check the news. November 13th actually, just double checked it.
---
When hit:
---
*INSTANT MORI*
---
Her power counters looping when used correctly. It also grants mobility and forces Survivors to waste time slow downing or using up Flashlights if they want to move around safely.
---
IMO she's at Nurse level in the right hands and with the right perks.
---
Receipts? Because in the latest q&amp;A Mclean was very clear that the doctor may not be next https://youtu.be/dmFyEKu2CWc?t=3449
---
Ok thanks very much
---
I had the same issue with devour hope as Myers. Maybe there is a bug with Myers’ totems?
---
You actually only require a 4K for that challenge thankfully.
---
Not just top 3, above Nurse.
---
Freddy S-Tier confirmed.
---
Awesome costume !
---
STBFL is definitely a must have for me on him, just fits him perfectly, may have to copy your build for him
---
You guys had Halloween?
---
Same thing getting posted every 30 minutes...
---
You’re right. Killers are always super try hard during the events.
---
Translation: "I do not want the narrative I am spreading to be challenged"
---
The shit you are complaining about is the same shit people have been complaining about for years but now it's magically because of the rift? yeah okay
---
I didn't go
---
nurse changes were not a good thing, i lose chases constantly due to having to wait to recharge breaths all the time
---
unless they didn't change that and i just suck ass at nurse
---
I only do it when I'm the last one left and the killer lets me escape
---
Unrealistic. Let’s too thicc
---
19 I think? something like that
---
So true lOl
---
Well someone's doing rift objectives
---
After finishing all Lvl 1 Quests, i got into this screen. 
---
This particular quest wants you to blind a killer TWICE in ONE GAME while CARRYING a survivor. Time to derank to Rank 20 to even have a chance to finish that one. 
---
Theres also one where you are supposed to unhook 3 People after Countdown started in one game SAVELY... so even with borrowed time killer probably has NOED, got absolutely rekt and will camp you dead IF u even get an unhook. 3 seems ridiculous.
---
And as Killer you have to sacrifice 3 people with NOED after endgame countdown started.
---
Use them all up. You could probably get 1M BP's with the event.
---
You just suck as nurse. Base nurse is barely different
---
I didnt play when they originally came out but I have them so I assume they're for everyone
---
Awwwww
---
yeah pretty sure it’s the open chests one
---
I really thought about doing this to mine but I couldn't justify throwing almost 80 bucks down the drain and ruining my mask by permanently staining it with fake blood.
---
Old David
---
It snowed and was 20 degrees Fahrenheit so Halloween was pretty set back till next year
---
i thought there was a way to speed up crouch-walking  so I tried the sprint button at the same time and didn’t understand why it wasn’t working until I realized: urban evasion
---
I personally don't mind spirit's power level. She's not that overpowering once you understand how to play against her. She's still strong, but I think she's overrated.
---
I see a lot of complaints about prayer beads when the ring is the actual problematic add-on. Prayer beads should only work the first time it happens in the game to any survivor that has basic map awareness.
---
I still firmly believe that Billy is stronger than her just because he has map wide pressure and instant down. I've won games with billy under a minute, you can't do that with spirit unless you get a lucky haunted grounds, but then so can every other killer.
---
However, spirit is my #2 most annoying killer to play against, simply because you cannot play vs her the same way you play vs most killers, and for that reason alone I fucking want her to be nerfed into the ground until she disappears. (Plague is my #1 most annoying killer to play against).
---
I am aware that this is not an opinion that a lot of people share, and might get downvoted for it, but whatever.
---
I have thousands of hours in this game and have basically been rank 1 survivor and killer every month I've played.
---
huh, it feels a lot different now. probably just placebo i guess
---
(playing this game for just almost 2 weeks so)
---
Well it depends on the time you are playing. For me the fastest games are during night (im from Germany) then killer games are actually faster than survivor ones (im rank 1) but 16 mins is ok compared to half an hour that some lower ranks have to wait
---
They actually don’t mine didn’t count when I had three dcs for a kill four survivors and I only got one of the kills who didn’t dc so maybe you got lucky but it most def doesn’t count
---
I'm curious. What was your rift level when you finished?
---
Hehehe those videos are pretty entertaining
---
Legion was broken as fuck. The amount of people complaining about him far surpassed the few people whining that he got nerfed. It was for the best.
---
2018 Laurie
---
My girlfriend picked the game up a while after me. Found a flashlight in a chest and thought the purpose of it was so you could see better. Used the whole flashlight to look around on the ground so she could see where she was going 😂
---
“This is unacceptable, mask off!” Lol
---
I love Sam's work even tho the writing is not as good as first 4 episodes but he has created really a wholesome parody.
---
Well, with the way the masks wear, only Susie would actually see you cause Frank couldn’t see anything
---
This is my new head canon.
---
I thought that the trapper would be unbeatable.  My first game someone followed me around and disarmed all of my traps lol.
---
Is that so? My friend got 2 DCs while doing his and it counted for him too
---
OMG that Nea! lol
---
*All women, are queens*
---
He’s in the entity’s realm then, right? But he isn’t affected by the entity.
---
Last time I checked survivors do that all the time not only when the killer is afk
---
op's sex life is private.
---
what kind of micropenis joke is this?
---

---
I would let the kid keep the mask but put on a shirt. Maybe its the rules but its micheal fucking myers, respect the mask.
---
Very late comment, but, to be fair, doesn't Nurse herself give off the same vibe?
---
Because you spend irl money on bbq
---
I got that one really easily by playing killer. If you wanna get crows, do that. I can't fathom why someone would play survivor for that particular challenge
---
You sound like you need to get a BT teammate who can unhook you too. If killer camps you can easily unhook and use the unhooked guy as bait to get them stunned temporarily.
---
But there’s 4 survivors
---
So the rift says, explicit, to get safe unhooks and you have somehow decided that people unhooking you right in front of the killer is the rift's fault?
---
I never thought about it that way. I've been just rushing through my challenges so I don't have to worry about them for the rest of the event
---
*laughs in jackalope*
---
Assuming so
---
xbox?
---
I prefer them, because their download speeds are faster and I have up to 50GB free of storage. ;)
---
He  sounds drunk to me
---
This is great lmao thanks for the laugh
---
Well the killers get punished if they don’t do as told by the entity, so they do it to avoid any pain.
---
Dying is painful for a fix via starvation (same thing can be said with how kings are vital for hamon users)
---
both sides are toxic imo
---
Very true, it's hard listening to some opinions when it makes it so obvious they've only played one side lol
---
Not even that good but annoying. Feral Frenzy hits would deplete the Deep Wounds bar, meaning a Legion could use their power to down a survivor with very very little counterplay, albeit over a painfully extended chase - not fun for anyone. This was exacerbated by Frank's Mixtape, which made FF hits deplete double the amount of Deep Wounds bar, meaning chases were reduced to like 30 seconds max with the survivor not being able to do anything besides pray for a stun.
---
As far as Im aware its the entire audio for both; alchemist, Evan, and Claudettes lore with a few other small audio files included.
---
Thank you for sparing the baby megs
---
Old pustula offerings from last year are reenabled again for this year, although their effect was modified. So yes, chances are they will be reactivated again next year.
---
Put on your glasses twat she does not have a gremlin face.
---
Quintin (in dbd alone) has a gremlin face, Nancy just has a face
---
You can play against a Spirit only if you use Iron WIll. Without it you are dead.
---
That's the problem about Spirit: you shouldn't be forced to use a perk just to counter a killer. You should be able to counter a killer by using your knowledge and skill.
---
Killers that are hard to loop but still be loopable are Hag, Freddy, Huntress... They are in a good spot, not Spirit.
---
These other guys are way overblowing how good pre-patch Legion was. Like, Legion was okay, but probably only around middling power level in terms of actual kills per match. The real complaint everyone had was that the chases were boring as sin. Since Legion can literally vault windows and pallets as fast as survivors, there wasn't much you could do during chases outside of little jukes behind them when they vault pallets and windows. It was just repetitive and lame, not overpowered. Legion was, and continues to be, outclassed by many, many killers.
---
This pretty much sums up entitled survivors, complain about noed but they use all meta perks and genrush but thats "ok" to them
---
Oh God Why? I stopped reading at prayer beads, o man that is... Dude... The game is in deep with those challenges if everyone starts to take extreme measures to get them done. No wonder since the update I've been having really unfun games, I thought it was due to bad players making their way up the ranks already, fixable with a good old rank reset, but maybe where good players doing stupid challenges.
---
Or at the very least A tier because she can literally still ignore 90% of objects
---
That Freddy does not haunt your dreams he helps you enjoy them
---
That is a really good idea
---
The lack of perk themed responses to this comment fills me rancor.
---
We'd have sent this sooner but due to unforeseen circumstances we had to delay
---
\&gt; Unhook 3 survivors when all the gens are done (in 1 game) 
---
Wow. Unless I'm incredibly lucky, I don't think I'm gonna do that.
---
We need to add thicc myers instead
---
So you're saying dbd is pay to win?
---
r/technicallythetruth
---
Comparing flashlights to an ebony mori is not really the point though, and they have limited usage and are avoidable. I was just talking about point gain and why there's such an increase in moris during bloodpoint events
---
What’s worse a rebounding centre, or when who reckons they are Steph Curry
---
Same, its the main reason i main ace,i already sunk so much so i thought why not?
---
Anyone who hugs the paint
---
Excellent costume. Nice touch on the head pose.
---
From what I understand, being edgy is trying way too hard to be cool by being way too dark to the point that it become ridiculous and you just make a fool out of yourself.
---
Example, this pussy Sasuke in Naruto is edgy.
---
That's true I suppose.
---
Pretty sure the devs have said that everyone in the Fog is atleast 21
---
DING
---
This is hilarious. Do you have a version without the text?
---
Pantless Myers tombstoning Shirtless David with his big thick pipe :)
---
Oh, I see. Yeah, that'd be nice
---
Honestly, my main thought was ''I'm probably gonna get a ton of DCs which will leave one person to track down and close the hatch on then surprise them."
---
It ended up being a normal match where the survivors didn't DC.  I felt....horrible. Strange.
---
It's been happening long before the blood hunt lol
---
I hate dcing, but if someones is getting farmed, camped or facing against a gen grabber spirit or insta down huntress, I FULLY understand.
---
Literally every killer in the game can do that.
---
Frank's bio explicitly states that he is 19, and the other members of the Legion are all younger then him.
---
Addtionally, Laurie is 17, Quentin is 17-18, and Steve is 19 while Nancy is 18.
---
I mean, spirit's schoolgirl skirt can be glitched into her ass, im sure myers can get the same treatment
---
I dont think so because i played kill my friends and it happend toobut he was ghost face
---
* Screenshots highlighting salty messages of any kind (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
I pressed the skill check button as soon as I heard the sound for my first game 😂
---
NAAAAAAR-
---
Yes. Its double BP queues are gonna  be bad for killer
---
Freddy is EASILY 3rd best, he has mind-games, map-wide pressure, cuts loops early, negates borrowed time and has inbuilt-slowdown.
---
Clown, on the other hand, has no actual fucking power. When he throws bottles, he gets slowed down at the same rate survivors do. NOTHING is being achieved when he plays perkless and addonless.
---
My info must be outdated then RIP me
---
Naw, squats and oats
---
it is I been removing a lot but more keep coming
---
Yup, up to 15 minutes
---
at first I thought it was a video and I really waited for a good second to see the costume
---
One ot the perks is like: Hide and seek
---
Let's hope so because at least on PS4 it's desperately needed
---
Prayer beads Myers, that is nightmare fuel.
---
That's a really unsafe pallet bruh you don't gotta break it
---
Bonus points for the Entity's Claw behind nea cat.
---
She can, actually. The way her mask is cracked actually gave her way better vision than Frank. Frank’s mask ended up being worn lower than planned when I made them, so he can’t see anything
---
I will do, just doing a killer challenge ;)
---
Oh how the mighty have fallen.
---
I saw your other pictures as well and they’re all amazing! You did such a good job with your decorations!
---
* General Spam - Extremely low effort and/or zero effort posts.
---
Myers in T1 didn't have auras before, though...
---
not worth it dude
---
It doesn't stack. It just doubles the bloodpoints you earned in the trial. So with 4 bbq stacks is essentially triple bloodpoints
---
Iron will is amazing on anyone. I feel its probably the biggest reason I lose the killer in a chase so I highly recommend using it regardless of character!
---
Karma is a bitch
---
I've been enjoying the Plaid Flannel at common rarity, that more than anything has been helping me learn Nurse and I've been performing with her better than pre-patch. Losing Omega Blink or 5-blink isn't much of an issue, I honestly never used those addons because of how cheap they felt.
---
There’s a close up photo of the masks on my profile that’s got a better view
---
I'm curious how this game ended
---
That's why I left my last group, they'd get pissed when they got morid but laugh it off after unhooking me next to the killer.
---
Lord forgive me for what I’m about to do
---
Finally a high effort meme!
---
I do, but I'm currently occupied by haters so cant chat rn...
---
you can actually go around him and just route the boss if you want to lmao
---
I do use iron will a lot because it's a really strong looping perk vs every killer, and it does make facing a spirit trivial, but it's not a requirement.
---
If you dont use it vs a spirit you need to play it like she has a permanent instant down, because your injured state is just extending the inevitable. That being said there is still a possibility to mind game a spirit while injured. My favourite, and you would be surprised how well it works, is dropping a pallet in front of me and walking/running back. It actually works vs even the best spirits, since they just go around before it's even dropped usually, meaning that they can't locate you as well with sound since they're walking away.
---
Value your healthy state above all, Don't be greedy with pallets, drop them early. Try to lose her more than loop her unless her phasing is on cd, etc.
---
Don't get me wrong, she is very fucking strong, but I adapted my play style in such a way that she doesn't bother me as much as she seem to bother other people. I do understand why she's strong, but I do think she is overrated.
---
imagine being salty that someone said something mean about tru3 like a month later still
---
Especially since there's dailies that REQUIRE moris!
---
I love the nea
---
I said me specifically I would not dress up as blade. You know why? Because it looks weird. Please stop responding i have work and im not tryna argue over Cosplay with some kid.
---
I’ll send you a friend request. I’m not always down for voice but I haven’t queued with any reliable teammates since my friends all kinda moved on lol.
---
Nea straight up lookin like that small asian woman movie stereotype
---
Admittedly the amount I’ve been waiting in Killer queues is now.. insanely short. Usually I plan around the wait time, I go to the bathroom, get a snack; you know. But several times in a row it’s just been very efficient, somewhat to my detriment.
---
I have no idea! It's actually why I like calm spirit.
---
You can very easily loop Spirit as long as she's bad at the game.
---
Source: I'm bad at spirit.
---
I popped my first Hag trap, which made me scream and run. So I ran into another Hag trap and screamed louder and ran faster. Another trap. Louder, faster. Eventually, I'm just this high-pitched whine zooming around the map.
---
Now I have Urban.
---
keep in mind that some of the later challenges are extremely difficult and most people probably won't complete them - so you might want to add in some gameplay hours on top of the required total
---
what do those do?

Ya they messaged after and wasn’t salty which surprised me tbh
---
I mean, they are worth more...
---
Nurse is still one of the best killers. Once they fix spirit, Nurse will be the best again.
---
Isnt that archivist?
---
No!!! My snooooot... You booped it!
---
It's because the blight hooks/gens give points outside the 4 categories
---
I thought the same as you, all my friends kept getting progressively more confused and annoyed when I said “no campfires are spawning I can’t interact with any plants”
---
I got 15500 in the game then should be double with the bloodhunt and I also had 3 stacks of BBQ and chilli and a pulsula petal ( which I got) bt grand total was 36000..?
---
Boops snoot again*
---
That’s not something you should be looking forward to. Ask the cacophony of Nurse mains if we like this change. Bc we sure as hell don’t. 
---
The addon changes I personally couldn’t care less about. Send them through. The base kit nerfs were uncalled for. If This version of Nurse is to be the best again, then we’re in for dark times.
---
Run D/S on your build so you don’t get tunnelled? You are playing Laurie anyways, might as well
---
Stop! It‘s No Nut November! But it looks pretty cool. Nice Work!🔥
---
No you
---
Battlepass charms, and I'm already calling it that there are going to be separate paid charms.
---
Behaviour: This addon is way overpowered, so let’s make it really hard to get!
---
Also Behaviour:
---
u/Avalinia Tried that on Kate and even after I stunned the killer he kept chasing me.
---
&gt;That's the problem about Spirit: you shouldn't be forced to use a perk just to counter a killer. You should be able to counter a killer by using your knowledge and skill.

They instantly down a survivor if you hit them with the hatchets.

---
As a stealthy claudette I tend to run Urban, Iron Will, Resilience, and Balanced Landing.
---
That's part of the reason I've never bothered to learn Nurse, even though I don't have the console handicap against me. I just don't want to go through 10 matches of people being smug about dunking on a Killer I can barely play/am trying to learn.
---
I always leave too though I get why some killers wanna ensure their kill. But I see it the way that I was out gamered and I need to get better and kill them earlier.
---
Is it canon that Claudette is always a cunt? asking as a new player who plays mostly killer
---
Was in a low rank survivor game yesterday, Huntress was afk. Powered through the first 3 gens while ruin was up. Then she decides to start playing. 4ks us and come to find out after she was P3 lmao
---
**Someone’s** gotta upkeep the entities realm around here
---
Aw.. I'll be your baby dweet
---
Every single frame of this is on different spectrum of "cursed"
---
It's a good building, but you're running it terribly if you think its infinite. Some if the windows are very weak, it's mainly just the 2 inside on the bottom floor by the stairs, but those are never BOTH open.
---
Dedicated servers aren't great at all, they mess up a lot of things
---
I mean, Ash occasionally screams like a girl when downed.
---
It's really abusive and yeah you can easily kill everyone in the very end but if they got all Gens done and opened the gate. Man they won just let them go
---
Moris boot players out of the game early and encourage tunneling. = Unhealthy

Keys are only usable at the end of the game. = Healthy

Well yes I agree, but it's easier to use a mori than a key as you have to meet a certain requirement for keys where with mori you can tunnel each hook before they even get the gens done and slug the second last guy to guarantee the hatch doesn't even spawn. Both are over powered though. I know both have requirements but you can work around a keys requirements but not a moris.
---
A strong man farts strongly
---
One is a hex and the other is a problem, yes.
---
Toxic Feng at 0:08
---
well yeah. the only way to sacrifice is on hook.
---
Ok I get you, so you get 100% for blood hunt + 50% for BBQ (with 4 stacks) of the base value - so in my case 15500 x 3?
---
But I got 3 stacks of bbq so 100% + 37.5%?
---
Yup, wasn't accusing you bro. But just to put things into perspective - I would really enjoy my games with nurse and hate my games with legion (where there would always be multiple d/c's). 
---
...Separately, i'm no huge fan of the spirit, but enjoy her games because my friend hates her so much and I get to hear his rage squeals.
---
I know! I always forget the dude was so young in the first movie.
---
The 21 thing for the most part references the survivors.

Hey guys just swinging by to comment on another reposteroni don't mind me
---
EGC kills actually count as regular sacrifices. Devs said this explicitly
---
Cosplay as her ? You cant, you are literally her ! Looking good ! The only thing in dbd i could cosplay is the clown .... at least i got the belly going !
---
Unless the killer is doing well. 2 hooks and suddenly the survivors can escape any 2 gen strat.
---
well they obviously don’t if it doesn’t work for the challenge
---
Unless your totem gets cleansed in the first thirty seconds because it spawned near a gen or on a survivor.
---
It's close to a coin toss, tbh.

Good one phantomal44
---
True, but some of them are highly situational/require specific builds/quite hard (repair 4 gens? sacrifice all 4 in a basement? sacrifice 3 in EGC with NOED?)
---
Here comes the Clapper!
---
Is this an old screenshot? I thought games wouldn't start with three survivors people anymore.
---
To be fair, he act got sort of nerfed in one aspect but buffed on other. Now, T1 myers has no terror radius at all instead of the 6m he had before, but he is now detectable by Spine Chill. So, the takeaway here is that Scratched Mirror Myers no longer needs Monitor and Abuse.
---
Why would they think this challenge is a good idea?
---
I mean, it just depends on if u plan on being a boring person and only running the same 4 meta perks every single game ever.
---
Oh yeah because DBD is never bugged amirite
---
you can go back and check the patch notes for the EGC release and see it for yourself.

Ps4
---
If you dont plan to use them then yeah just skip them, you can always come back to get them later at any time.
---
Ahh yes, my sleep paralysis demon at the foot of my bed
---
Do you have a blank available for "re-memeing" purposes?
---
You can't get DS without unlocking the other 2 first. If you skip a teachable it will just keep reappearing until you take it. (i believe so)
---
But did you sounded like an air pump?? 
---
Great cosplay xD loved it!
---
Haha nah just with some of the perks i can’t see myself using them. I’m definitely going to try different builds in the future. Still fairly new to the game aswell!

Yeah. As noble of an act this was, it was all for naught. But you shall be remembered!

Why not just reroll the daily?
---
My Nurse went into the trash can after I finally got the Adept Nurse achievement.
---
She let us go. But I gave her a bunch of points with the other survivors first (:
---
At purple ranks I get insta lobbies as killer on ps4 and at yellow ranks it only takes me and my buddy about  two minutes to get a surv lobby. It's really popular still
---
pfft. imagine survivors can just use the skeleton or regular key to escape the RBT.
---
Jesus christ how did I not realize what this was implying when i was a kid
---
I remember we had a wraith who we thought was afk in a swf. We did the gens quickly then all went to find loot and the suddenly he just noeds and bloodwardens and we all got killed. Felt like a right idiot that game but at the same time I respect the hustle.

Yeah dude I get it, I over reacted, didn't saw the flair, sorry. Just that i can't have consistent fun with friends because that wich you joke about, actually happens... a lot. [https://imgur.com/a/KxKryqy](https://imgur.com/a/KxKryqy) standard SWF experience for me, I juked his chainsaw getting myself into a locker, head on him after his tantrum ended, one gen later when finally got me, that was the rest of my game.
---
This picture is actually full of them.
---
If you’re higher rank it’s going to take you a while to find matches as players don’t reset down too low each month
---
God forbid spirit stays good. Maybe take out prayer beads but that's it
---
Unlocked all perks on my main lass meg!
---
&gt;  so think something might be amiss the day
---
Halloween hangovers, end of the work and school week, people who play really late logged off to sleep
---
I like the fact you chose exactly the character stereotype to represent each panel. Especially Nea. Lol
---
Well, yes
---
Counting DCs as deaths shouldn't change the numbers much. I know DCs are still a problem, but I only see them once in a while now, and most of them happen in situations where they were about to die anyways. The most common DC I see is when people are tunneled straight off the hook and they DC before the killer can sacrifice them. You'll also see DCs in situation where the survivor determines that they are in an unwinnable situation, where again they almost certainly would have died anyways. Counting a DC as a death in such a situation makes sense. The main worry I have is that an early DC can result in the death of additional survivors.  
---
  
---
Keep in mind that the survival rates are also inflated by escapes from the hatch, farming killers, merciful killers, afk killers, etc. The actual win rate for solo queue survivors should be significantly lower in theory. Additionally, that win rate would still be averaged across all killers, not just the high tier ones. Can you imagine what the solo queue win rate against Spirit must be.
---
Gonna have to disagree with you on that one, chief
---
we must commemorate OP
---
The fact that you can see the Trapper's mouth makes this incredible
---
Nothing confirmed yet
---
Only one of the two god windows will ever be open, and actually sometimes neither of them are. Both windows upstairs are super unsafe as the killer can just drop down after they vault. If the window next to the pallet downstairs is open it can be a kinda strong loop if the killer doesn't break the pallet, but that's really it.
---
feel free to, I disconnect a lot vs spirit aswell,

&gt;3.5 seconds is a long time in a chase.
---
Mindbreaker new Meta???? Jokes aside, the distance a survivor travels in 3.5 seconds is less than that of one blink.
---
The cooldown punishes bad nurses for consistently missing their blinks. The nurse mains who never usually missed their first blinks won't be affected.
---
Some killer builds are designed around getting to the end game. Like permanent tombstone myers or remember me &amp; bloodwarden builds. But because they have a key, you only get 1 kill. Guess you should just go play nurse, spirit or Billy.
---
The same arguement can be said about Legion though. People spread out? No power basically, stab a single person and then chase em, not much is agined. How about ending chases? First you have to cancel your mediocre power, get stunned for a long ass time and then enjoy trying to mindgame loops as a basic m1 killer, unless you manage to bodyblock a really cocky survivor from getting a window (like you do with Wraith), cancel your power and then manage to catch up to them before they actually reach a pallet then the speed-up of the power is worthless too. Also one thing Clown has going for him is that his addons actually make his power more viable, Legion's are just laughable.
---
&gt; Is there any reason to get those ones at all? Thanks!
---
The teachables you skip will always be in the bloodwebs for their unique character. That's it. So it doesn't really matter unless you plan on using Laurie at some point
---
Our old deck. We skinned some boards to get them thin so it'd be light.
---
specifically toxins lol
---
At first I never got why people called legion " the school shooter" and I'm starting to understand why. 
---
Home room head ass 😂😄😄
---
Looks terrifying
---
Really OP should have said spine chill is how to never get pallet faked.
---
Congrats on not posting the generic "get chased for 2 seconds" daily. Impressive.
---
If only one person died, the hatch wouldn’t appear until you only had two gens left?
---
That isn't accurate. Once you hit level 40 you could have all 3 teachables in your web
---
I am speed
---
V O R E
---
M E
---
M Y E R S
---
It's not just that. If you're running an end game build for killer then it just let's 3 survivors escape for free. It discourages builds like permanent t3 tombstone myers and using perks like remember me and bloodwarden.
---
The hatch doesnt spawn if 4 gens are still remaining.
---
Yea the events tend to bring out the worst of the community, I had so many survivors dc on me yesterday. I was trying to help my buddies level up their first characters but half the time we had another survivor dc or a proximity camping killer so the matches were awful.
---
As far as I remember I have like at least 25-30 of these on my huntress. As well as like 20 ebony moris lmao. Ultra rare indeed.
---
Because how dare anyone complain when cheated out of something they earned. Especially confused new players that don’t necessarily search by new.
---
Again tell that to billy
---
As Sally is my baby girl I feel I should leave my opinion here. While it was definitely a nerf no doubt about it, I feel as though it was a needed nerf. I've played about 10 games with her since the rework and to be honest I'm loving it. It is substantially more challenging to play her now but, for me at least, it's equally more rewarding. The addons while not being anywhere near OP actually give her like 10 different playstyles and even halfway through a game survivors don't know what you are going to do. Will she blink twice? Three times? Can she go through walls? Is she running faster? Why didn't I hear her sneak up behind me? I know she's not running stridor so why is she finding me so easily?
---
I have to admit I am really really enjoying the new nurse. Once I remembered I can't play like I used to and I reprogrammed my muscle memory to not blink immediately after fatigue and i made new strategies for different addons and maps it was an absolute blast. It's so much fun to gen grab somebody with nurse because they can't hear you. I like being able to have basically 5 perks. Really the only downfall I saw when I picked her up again was we can't spam blinks and most of all In the beginning I kept trying to blink without letting 2 recharge and it cost me games. However it also showed me how wasteful I was being with the blinks. How many unnecessary fatigues I went through.
---
All in all I am truly loving Sally now. She's a challenge again. And if I get bored I can change my playstyles 180 degrees so the survivors who just got comfy with her again start screaming in confusion. Just play with her. Love her and she will love you back.
---
Thanks people, ill buy the spirit :D
---
&gt;just walk
---
&gt;since you're long gone
---
it wouldn't be as bad if people wouldn't mori off of first hook. idm getting mori'd as long as I had time to earn points and play the game. a GF mori'd my entire team off of first hook one round last night and I didn't play anymore after that. all of my rounds so far during this event have been horrible.
---
Not Vommy Mommy &gt;:(
---
Lmao if it would be the joker, i would never stop playing the game
---
I agree that passive phasing should be either removed or reduced to a degree that it's barely noticeable.I don't remember how many times I've been downed because of the passive phasing "mindgame" she has.
---
Get rid of the prayer beads and that's it honestly,maybe reduce the duration of the phase too to lower map pressure.Also the phasing sound is a bit wonky.If you're looking at her the phasing sound doesn't play even if you're not in a chase.
---
&gt;People spread out? No power basically
---
The basically is important here, because although Legion's power sucks ass, Clown straight-up has no power. I'm talking base level, where we don't put in compounding variables like maps or addons or perks.
---
Clown, base-level, is the definition of M1.
---
If they did this though, it would only make sense for them to nerf keys as well. Not that I’m against this. Even having it so keys only open the hatch when all the gens are completed, if there’s three or more people left.
---
I don’t know, devs would have to work it out and find a balance.
---
But for sure moris and keys need a rework.
---
Don't forget Ash and Jane.
---
I felt super bad last night cause I had to go AFK toward the end of match(baby started crying). Came back to post game chat to a bunch of GGs, so hope the survivors got some fun booping my Freddy.
---
Natalie dyer. Pretty sure that's how it's spelled
---
Bell ghost!
---
Its more likely that the event is promoting gen rushing and toxic sandbag unhooks and killers are tired of it. (I play both sides.)
---
I play both killer and survivor and never DC even if I’m being tunneled or camped or killer/survs are being toxic, only time was early release of the game when the game was unplayable and I got stuck inside of a hook :/
---
that is some dedication, well done.
---
Beside the basement part, trapper kinda is a proxy camp killer has he doesn't apply as much pressure than other killers.TBH if you don't want to be gen rushed maybe trapper isn't for you, as he takes a bit of time to setup his traps..defiantly use ruin and hope they don't find it right away!
---
Iron Will is a great perk overall. Laurie is indeed one of the loudest characters so it is especially good for her. 
---
The only character it’s mostly obsolete on is Ace because he is literally the quietest survivor in the entire game.
---
I fall under the plays both sides category,
---
According to this, it will only work with other PC Players 'for the time being', but Crossplay with Xbox may be a thing in the future:  
---
## Q: WILL CROSSPLAY BE EXTENDED TO THE CONSOLE VERSIONS OF THE GAME IN THE FUTURE? 
---
A: We would like to offer the same treatment for all platforms. We do not have an ETA at this time, but we will keep you posted as new information becomes available. 
---
He gets slowed, sure, but for a much smaller amount of time. And when he *is* slowed after chucking a bottle, his speed is still above 100% movement speed. The survivors, however, suffer from the Hindered status effect for over a second, on top of having their vision blurred. It’s a chase power that is often misunderstood and underestimated. Meanwhile, Legion can’t use his power to down people. Sure, he can run fast, but he has that long stun afterwards, and his power takes way longer to use. And while you’re busy looking for everyone, they’ve already mended and also probably healed. At least with Clown, you can confirm that they will go down.
---
I really hope they change the doctors power. It feels so janky compared to the other ranged killer powers and it doesn't work if the survivor is even 1 inch off the ground
---
Hey, I posted this last night! &lt;3 I'm Austin Powers
---
this is definitely the reason I started using her. I love that they added this skin.
---
Auwh.
---
No but its fucking boring.
---
Have you read his chapters?? He tears killers apart for his experiments and breakfast.
---
Ahahah i dont know what this community likes or not, She looks fun and a cool character
---
Solo survivor is a fucking miserable experience. Red ranks usually don’t get much hardcore tunnelling/camping because they’re bad strats, but since the archive updates it’s become really bad for it. I just had a game where I was camped by a rank 1 legacy trapper. Team mates on the other side of the map so it’s not like he seen scratch marks or anything. Last few days have been awful on dbd, think I’m gunna give it a couple weeks and see if it dies down.
---
Are the level 30, 35 and 40 still set though? Or can you get for example both DS and sole survivor on lvl 40 if you don’t get sole survivor on 30?
---
My least favorite part about her is you can't really "hide/walk away". She can bump into you while invisible and find you regardless.
---
Because it's more easily readable this way to someone who isn't familiar with Spiderman lore
---
Ya....I only asked because I couldn't find that information....but I read that link.
---
Mind breakers problem is that no survivor is gonna work on a gen less than half done while the killer is near. 
---
The cool down adds a very real dimension to her gameplay in a negative way. It’s 2 cool downs for the same power, it throws off your muscle memory, and it doesn’t even accomplish the goal BHVR said it was meant to accomplish. None of that is fun to play with. And that doesn’t even account for the fact that now her map pressure is either atrocious or godlike and her chase potential takes the title that her map pressure didn’t. 
---
Nurse was designed to play by a different set of rules in a positive and negative way, BHVR blatantly disrespected that and didn’t at all adjust her to fall in line with the game rules in any beneficial way. They said they’d be calculated and measured in their changes, yet the base kit nerf and half the new addons just look so lazy in their design. They said they would only touch what was universally agreed upon to be problematic, and her basekit was never regarded as problematic. 
---
Nobody said “Base Nurse is OP” until BHVR said that people said “Base Nurse is OP”. The appeal to authority is striking. 
---
Even if you exclude any kind of math, there is no justification for this nerf. One missed double blink is too punishing now. And contrary to popular belief, not every Nurse is a god tier player who never ever ever once in their life missed a blink attack.
---
i have Spirit and im decent with her but i never play her cuz she is rather boring for me.
---
Facts.
---
Yep, if someone knows nothing about the context of this scene, the "correct" way will appear to be backwards
---
No worries!
---
No he injected serum into them thats all. he said he WOULD do it if it means he gets the flowers the entries never say how storng he is all it says is that he was experimenting he didnt kill them only trap them for a bit and they still escaped we see the alchemist himself BECOME a killer I think youre taking the entries a bit too seriously or literal with the tearing apart thing
---
Perhaps stealth killers then?
---
I'm not that bad. I'm getting better each time I play. The relevance is you said:
---
&gt;  idk why it’s so hard to just hook people.
---
and the and the answer is that I literally just started learning a new killer who has a high skill floor
---
why you being such an asshole? relevant flair I guess
---
Yeah I found that too after I bought her. It is a pretty simple mechanic of phase when approaching survivors.
---
Yeah, I find it funny too. He isn't popular since BHVR released something else than the holy trinity (Wraith, Billy and Trapper).
---
Mind you, And that's if the killer is sloppy enough to reveal his mori. The killer can see who has a key. Additionally they can hook multiple players before even choosing to mori a player which puts the remaining survivors in a situation where if they happen to get chased they're dead (Due to the killer hiding mori meaning he would be relatively good) Who's to say once he's ready to start killing people he slugs the key and goes to mori another person that took a hit for the wiggle? No offense but are you a killer main? It seems like you don't have much experience with how a mori can change the game and how a late/delayed mori can end it
---
Alright for Myers. 
---
BBQ is good and it’s on the shrine game for it.
---
Mood
---
and maybe making it so she has more than like one downside in contrast to her millions of upsides
---
It's an honest mix up. A lot of people will be her cause it's a lot easier for her to blend in than others. So you get a lot of newer people being her or trying to get her self care perk. I see a lot as survivor that will hide and sandbag me at all costs as long as they are safe. Will hide in lockers the second they hear a heartbeat. And then I see really good players with flashlights that mama bird the other survivors. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
I had one last night that wouldn't let me pick up downed survivors and then dc'd when she was about to be on her own 3rd hook.
---
Started at 1, now on 11. Sucks it takes so long without the Tome.
---
As long as shes still fun to mind game with then im happy. Totally down with her prayer beads getting gutted
---
Words how survivors don't want to counter 1 killer and yet killers are expected to counter the meta every time because survivors don't use anything else but second chance or clutch perks.
---
(I am aware there are some that line me run different perks, but not that many)
---
You can get two because of the new bloodweb re-work, but you only get to choose the first one and then the entity takes a second one at random so then you get what's left
---
You are talking about the video, go read his audio narrations. In multiple chapters narrator talked about how even Killers were his plaything wherever Entity put him after he escaped the void. 
---
Also yes, he yearned to go back to trails as he can not remember where his home is. But he is simply too powerful for it now.
---
It's not like anyone was doing anything interesting with her. Nurses always had the same build. Very boring playing against.

Can i have a blank please?
---
A lot of people are complaining so eventually.... Yes... her add ons with prayer beads needs a nerf not her base power
---
This ur OC? I love this
---
That's a well fed Myers.
---
Hope you had a *killer* Halloween.
---
Thanks! So the other two aren’t as useful for him? If you know of any builds I can get just by gaming that would be much appreciated
---
Agitation and Iron Grasp means you can get to the basement from pretty far across the map. On a smaller map with the basement in the middle, you should be able to get away with only basement hooks.
---
Trust me, Legion are better than Clown (In dead zone wise)
---
They do need to focus on buffing killers before nerfing imo. On console we have two very good killers and thats spirit and billy the rest are pretty meh if u hard nerf spirit then all we will have is billy. Also if they start buffing meh killers that solves the problem of only seeing the same killers bc ppl will be encouraged to actually play someone else since the risk of them getting obliterated is lower.
---
I know what t posing is. I just don't understand this dumb meme or find it funny
---
I think they should look into giving weaker killers like Clown, Pig, and Legion some love before they start changing killers like Spirit.
---
What are prayer beads?
---
Oh god why
---
Yeah but I find prayer beads to be the biggest problem.
---
Why get pantsless myers when you can get T H I C C myers
---
With deal in absolutes
---
1- my point was that they discourage playing more fun/varied killers/builds. Not everyone who plays killer wants to be locked into playing nurse, Billy and spirit with ruin, bbq and your choice of whispers &amp; nurse's calling or enduring &amp; spirit fury.
---
2- getting to the end game as a survivor shouldn't be a default win. That's why perks like blood warden and remember me exist. It's why pig's traps go off if you try to leave the exit gates. Keys make it a win state if even 1 survivor is out already.
---
3- keys might be less common than moris but that's just because most survivors will look for items within the match or bring toolboxes/medkits.
---
4- I don't use noed because I play plague, demogorgon, myers and ghostface. None of which can exploit it properly/ can expose with their own power anyway. Stop projecting and calm your tits.
---
6- I play plenty of survivor and I feel cheap enough getting the hatch without a key
---
The entity is a bit spider munster, leave em’ alone they haven’t done anything.
---
Where did u find this pic from ? :o
---
I ah e to admit I’ve been playing for rift achievements but I don’t let it affect the rest of the game.   I’m having a ton of fun with the rift tho.  It does make the game funnier.
---
Yep. Everyone over exaggerating her nerf.
---
#YES LAD BOOP THE SNOOT

No brutal strength is good you just need to combine it with a Billy perk that I’m blanking on.
---
Almost 4k upvotes for a picture of my wall. Reddit is truly a beautiful place.

No map pressure, power doesn't directly injure/down, have to reload, lowest killrate (tied with Legion).

Its snowing by you already?
---
But thr constant stuttering is insane. Also trapper now steps into his own traps, which is annoying. Myers tends to simply not stalk people when looking directly at them. Lot's of issues for practically no reward
---
I hope you got it/get it soon! I'm having a blast with these quests :)
---
He is insulting me. I still don't believe you or him. I'm  not a sore loser. Fuck off
---
&gt;it throws off your muscle memory,
---
That's an individual's issue, not a game mechanic issue
---
&gt;Nobody said “Base Nurse is OP” until BHVR said that people said “Base Nurse is OP”. The appeal to authority is striking.
---
I actually argued against changing base nurse, if you go through my reddit history.
---
&gt;Me: If I'm on one side of the wall and the nurse is on the other, just like every other killer, she can't hit me. Sure, she can use her power, but this is where the mind-game comes in; I can fake corners, fake window vaults, use tiles but run in unpredictable ways. Nurse ignores looping, not chasing.
---
&gt;I think most survivors just want Billy copies; killers that are strong to the point to where they have potential, and thus are fun to play against, but at the end of the day, are still loopable to shit.
---
&gt;Playing against a no-addon nurse really isn't that terrible. It's her range addons and a mori on top that makes it unfun.
---
It really is just bad survivors who will downvote me here, since (like you) they can't formulate any decent responses apart from "no u".
---
If you want to explain why base nurse isn't fine, then explain to me so I can be enlightened.
---
Otherwise, from my own experience, I find base nurse not that bad to play against. Hard? Yes, harder than most other killers, but still fun.
---
&gt;Even if you exclude any kind of math, there is no justification for this nerf.
---
That's not an argument. I just used math to show that cooldown is justified.
---
Well if you get like an additional 15k per challenge as well as battle pass tiers granting limited time cosmetics, the incentive lies in completing challenges, not normal gameplay.
---
I dont see the killer there, just some 4 survivors looping themselves
---
You can watch Fungoose and he has recommended killer builds and will give you all the tips you need. 
---
He’s on twitch so you have to wait for him to get on.
---
Thank, finally someone who actually reads. I’m not dcing to be an ass, I’m just sick of getting killed immediately and being left with the feeling like I couldn’t have done anything different. This subreddit can be so pitiful sometimes
---
I just find zero enjoyment from playing survivor
---
Tru3: *Yes*
---
Every survivor build: Decisisve, Borrowed time, Adreniline, balanced Landing
---
But if a killer puts on noed then he's a garbage killer who needs crutch perks
---
Skips leg day
---
Lmao ik. But then there’s other people literally voting.
---
This should be a post by itself so more people are aware
---
Sounds like something a sore loser would say, you're sure doin' a lot of projecting.
---
Nurse is great. She just requires a lot more love to get good with her.
---
The player base.
---
You mean Herbert west? Lol.
---
&gt;Paid cosmetics and passes in an already pay to play game are not fair or good,
---
The base game is extremely cheap and is given away for free way more than any game I have ever seen. Almost all of the content can be acquired for free just by playing. If you don't like that there is a paid battlepass you can just play the free path. And cosmetics are like the only goddamn way BHVR makes any money, and most cosmetics can be acquired for free as well.
---
And how is it "not fair?" It doesn't affect gameplay at all so it's perfectly fair
---
I main LeatherFace, Freddy, and Pig. Don’t camp, don’t tunnel, don’t literally camp your Hex all game, don’t use noed because you’ll never learn that way, don’t chase someone for too long if you have to drop them then do it, don’t chase someone that wants your attention unless you catch them in a bad spot or they’re ass, and don’t DC. Perks: Tana, sloppy, ruin, pop, corrupt, bbq, enduring, spirit, nurses, franklin (when you see items), and devour. If some DC’s I just give the survivors a free win because it’s unfair.  Just watch youtubers or streamers play and see what they do in any situation.
---
you feel way more attacked than I’m actually attacking u. calm down.
---
I love leg day like I love my wife, Boomtown!
---
It's very noticeable though. I've not come across a Nurse that's killed more than one person since her changes.
---
Almost two weeks is nothing. I’ve been playing for about 3 months and I still feel like I have plenty to learn, especially as killer. You’re probably just climbing in rank and getting better survivors so that’s why you’re losing chases
---
I’m not getting my auric cells from my rift pass

Isn't it more efficient to double blink each time? Here's some admittedly hard to follow maths (values for her speed at various points in use of her power here  [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Movement\_Speeds](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Movement_Speeds))  :
---
1 blink at a time: 2s charging for 5.78m, travels 20m in 1.5s blinking and then 1.5s chain window before fatigue starts for 2.31m. 2s of fatigue for 1.92m, and then 1s walking while waiting for recharge for 3.85m travelled. After this point the cycle can repeat. This gives us a total of 33.86m over 8s, for an average of **4.2m/s** (your video seems to indicate this is a little off, but I think this is due to you not waiting for the second blink to recharge after the first blink of the video) 
---
2 blinks at a time: 2s charging for 5.78m, travels 20m in 1.5s blinking, 1.2 s chain blink charging for 1.392m, then in 0.9s another 12m travelled while blinking, and 1.5s lunge window before fatigue starts for 2.31m. 2.5s fatigue for 2.4m, and then 3.5s walking while waiting for recharge for another 13.5m travelled. After this point the cycle can repeat. This gives us a total of 57.38m over 11.9s, for an average of **4.8m/s**
---
Yes huntress masks would be great!
---
i run bubba with bbq, spirit fury, enduring, and infectious fright at rank 5 and do fine, i run tenacity, resilience, spine chill, and dead hard  at rank 4 and do fine. when you're playing something as strong as spirit, you don't need any perks to be viable, shes that strong, i don't feel any sympathy for spirits having to run a "specific build to be viable" when they don't even have to, i think you just need to look at this from a balance perspective and realize whether its perkless spirit vs perkless survivors or full meta spirit vs full meta survivors, spirit will always win
---
Do you mind listing all those upsides and telling us why exactly you think her *base* power is so strong?

Right now, can you tell me how many character went throgu the tragic death of a or (or multiple) relative(s)/ close friend(s) ?
---
A LOT of them right ?
---
Well, when this happens in this manga you have 2 path that open for you, you either get over it, find yourself an objective and become a babyface. Or you become an edgy pyschopatic bastard villain that want to kill everyone and their grandma and shit. So that include most main villains of the current arch (actually all of them except maybe Kaguya and a few other unthoughtfull ones).
---
I doubt she got DS 3 times by mistake.
---
My game actually crashed a few days ago upon gaining madness 1.
---
Michael failed the penis inspection day
---
Please use the pinned Megathread.
---
Nope.
---
She's canonically a shy, reserved, anti-social girl who has more of an interest with nature and botany then making friends and being toxic.
---
Lmao this kid died to nurse so now she needs to be nerfed into oblivion
---
Dwight is adorable &gt;_&lt;
---
It’s an add on for the spirit that makes her phasing completely silent.
---
This is the information I was looking for! Great response and is appreciated.
---
One more question. Just went to the shine and bought it, now I’ve already upgraded Myers to 15. When would that teachable show up? Same with the Hags Hex? Luckily Hag was free with the game pass so I was able to already have her close to 30
---
lol oh fuck off with this shit. you wre combative and rude off the bat and had to make a remark about my Huntress skills for no reason
---
I play both
---
This is good! Thank you
---
You don't have many friends do you
---
I’ll have to check him out! Pretty sure I was watching a few of his YouTube videos last night debating on who to buy
---
Ok well I dont have time to open game again and snap screenshots for you right now
---
About toying thing i was paraphrasing the experiment stuff
---
However the tearing killers limb to limb apart is verbatim there at least 2 times.
---
A Line indacates he Will do anything for more flowers (what a addict) the ENTITY could use that's again that's asuming Vigo and the alchemist are the same
---
..... no please don’t think that’s it’s black metal tradition. 
---
Look up behemoth or mayhem. It’s called corpse paint.....
---
First game I happened to be the obsession I thought the entity claws around my name meant the killer could see my aura at all times or something. Explaining the obsession mechanic to a newbie is pretty complex, googling it didn't help. Took me a while to understand it.
---
Stalking with ghostface is a really weak way to play him
---
Like that is going to stop 'em... they'll see it as a badge of honor you shouldn't reward that shit!
---
People playing meta killers likely want to win at a higher rate.   They may believe tunneling is a good strategy.
---
Is that his first teachable at 30? Or is it all by random
---
lol dude, I literally just said hooking is sacrificing. and I didn’t make a remark about ur huntress skills, I just asked what they had to do with it. Idk why ur so offended by my input, but you do know it’s really hard to tell tone from texting.
---
That was really cool!
---
Well BHVR said they reworked all of Nurses addons bc they didn’t want Nurse players to forgo using Nurse to her full potential bc they messed with her muscle memory. But then were fine slapping this basekit nerf on...
---
Or the same devs who argued survivors shouldn’t have to track 2 endgame timers and that’s why they nerfed endgame Pig seemingly gave zero shits about Nurse players. It’s just...there’s a clear double standard BHVR had set for Nurse players here. It’s frustrating as someone who enjoys Nurse and had high hopes for this rework to look at this change and watch almost all my hopes get dashed. Muscle memory being an individual problem or no, it is very very obvious that BHVR held Nurse to a different rule set here. And the whole goal of their rework on the issue of her being unfair was to bring her more in line with other killers, not maintain this “she plays by her own rules” except now just throw to the other extreme. 
---
That’s the same thing Blizzard did with Mercy in Overwatch. It’s the same thing Nintendo did with Bayonetta in smash Bros. It’s a double standard and it feels shitty to be on the receiving end of that. 
---
I agree with your sentiment that base Nurse was not a balance problem. I think there’s a miscommunication here. I don’t think her basekit needed nerfed at all. Her addons? Oh yeah definitely throw those out. I only ever used Blink movement speed addons bc they made me feel faster. But BHVR with this rework treated a necessary power like a luxury. That is a problem. 
---
And as for your final sentence. Ur correct survivors don’t gain much ground. The problem is that In that 3.5 seconds, they have ALL the power. The problem with chases in this game right now as a whole is that there is too much power that is left to survivors. Now most of that has to do with map structure and the unfairness of certain pallet/window structures, but now that power dynamic is built into Nurses kit. Meaning no matter what the maps look like, survivors are always gonna get that 3.5 second of complete control even if they get hit. 
---
This game is already bending more towards survivors with every balance patch that nerfs anything to do with killers, regardless of whether those nerfs are necessary evils or not. Giving them a surefire almost 4 seconds of being untouchable in a chase even if they get hit, is not a solution to any problem with Nurse. It’s just taking the ball and throwing it into Nurses court, and then cutting off her limbs so she can’t send it back.
---
When did they ever give it away for free?
---
The game has a moderate, acceptable price tag for a full game.
---
Almost half of the chapters are licensed, and are not obtainable by playing.
---
I can play the free path in a game I paid for, great stuff.
---
If a cosmetic is not a reskin it's more often than not bought with auric cells.
---
You atleast accepted the fact that ~~idiots~~ people that throw out money for microtransactions keep lining the pockets of people who indulge in shitty practices.
---
It's not fair because it requires additional payment on top of a full priced game purchase. At this point they could just say that the game is free to play, and everyone who bought it before could get a permapass.
---
This is both the worst and best dad joke I have ever seen 
---
And I hate you and love you for it lmao
---
I’ll tell you if you take the jacket off.
---
Each teachable has its own slot one by 30 then 35 and then 40. 
---
I can’t remember the power of the interwebs help lol.
---
Imagine using self-care in 2019 lmao
---
Clown is pretty shite tbh
---
Looks like it was me being an idiot.  You can spend to open tiers early. It just seemed to me like I had to spend to progress.
---
Sorry. My fuck up
---
&gt; and I didn’t make a remark about ur huntress skills
---
"what does being a bad huntress..."
---
you are actually amazing with this shit, acting like you never said things you said 10 minutes ago. top tier gaslighting
---
I came here to make the exact joke but I was to late. I am both saddened I missed my chance and pleased there is dad jokes going on regardless
---
Edgy is a not a new term bu any stretch. It's been around pre internet with the same colloquial meaning.
---
i never said that nurse needs to be nerfed, she actually takes skill to play, spirit does not
---
1. Keys do not prevent ANY kind of "fun play style" period. You're mistaken that for the "Gen rushers" which isn't based on what killer you play, I've "gen rushed" all killers and there isn't much you can do if everyone spawns separately and decides to jump on a gen. If you get gen rushed, you get gen rushed. 
---
2. Getting a single hook shouldn't be a free kill with the only requirement being a short tunnel session. And those perks are what ruin the game for us survivors, We do well in a game, avoid/out last the killer and what happens? Blood warden. NOED. The survivors must complete 5 Generators and escape, Which was accomplished, Imagine needing to get 3 hooks on survivors (which is the case) but on the final carry everyone gets DS, Sounds fun right? You do your job and do it well only to be punished by an unfair and unbalanced mechanic. And if 1 player is already "Out" via escape gate - The game is over, if it's by hatch most of the gens were done and the game was about over. It's called "GG" try to patrol gens more often or invest into gen slowing perks because the community will skin you if you try to rework any killer to help with roaming. Also that's just pigs ability, She also has the ability to down and hook you to take away even more time from your box. (The time of avoiding her, and being reset on a hook)
---
3. Keys are less common because they are less effective than what you're comparing them to. There are too many factors at play to even compare the majority of addons and offerings other than making sure neither are too strong, Which is not the case. (Mori succession rate vs Key escape rate for example). Tbh escaping with just 2 people has been a celebratory event for me, Just 2. 
---
4. Excuse you buckaroo but i was using noad as an example of why 4 players escaping at the end of the game could be annoying and the only thing I could think of was a killer using noed as a good example. You were just the example such as buying 2400 loafs of bread for a match problem, Calm your tits. 
---
5. Wait you skipped 5.
---
6. No offense but you clearly haven't played enough to see the imbalance between mori and a key
---
Good,  they need to adapt. We all thought spirit was a meh after her buff but people soon realized her potential. If you keep practicing and building muscle memory then you will be able to play nurse before the changes but with more counter play.
---
You are right but given that he has been able to subdue and dominate killers Alchemist is a very powerful being in Entity's realm.
---
Also, yes he is an addict but given he escaped the void (a place where survivors get loat after dying too many times) and came back thanks to that flower, I'd say he has no other choice, that serum is the only thing keeping him sane or whatever consciousness he has now.
---
Yep I was Ghostface to get candy lol. 
---
My cousin had my 2018 Michael Myers mask. (Best mask)
---
You want THE wraith to go through wall!?
---
That would be to over Power, it eoukd make wraith THE best Killer in the game!
---
IF it would to be in the game it would have to bei an add-on and not an bit Hard to get bit THE hardest in the game to get like nearly Impossible to get.
---
Big if True
---
You are a sad, sad creature.
---
If there's a hidden offering then assume it's a mori. You can't hide a mori unless it's devour hope(which is fine) or rancor(which is less fine). A key can straight up delete an endgame build killer's ability to get more than one kill. A mori can shut down a survivor's game early but using it late makes almost no difference. And you physically can't take a hit during the wiggle for a moried survivor cause you don't wiggle during a mori.
---
Yeah that’s a pretty obvious statement there ace. 
---
I was fine with the idea of Nurse getting nerfed, provided the nerf was made in good faith and not just a hamfisted handout to survivors who hold shift+W and rotate their camera around a pallet and then wonder why Nurse downs them.
---
dude you fucking literally said u were new to huntress and she has a high skill gap? tf else am i supposed to assume from that? did you expect me to think u were a god huntress off the bat?

Plague is fucked by survivors who rob her of her power bc, and say it with me bc nobody listens when it’s just me, VILE PURGE IS TOO WEAK AND CORRUPT PURGE IS TOO STRONG.

nice bo3 tat!

Basement hook build. Iron grasp, agitation, mad grit, monstrous shrine.
---
This lets you get to the basement easy and avoid any body blocking, it also slightly helps kill them faster

My friend says he plays both sides but thinks decisive strike needs a buff and insta heals were balanced and shouldn’t have been nerfed lmao

Probably use that spinning thing like the Tall Man's silver ball from Phantasm

True
---
It's great that you want to play with your friends. It's not great when those friends are using external chat programs and essentially have telepathy.
---
Don’t get stressed or over whelmed.  Don’t worry about kills.  Focus on hooking everyone twice and bloodpoints.  You’re learning.  You’re also likely a survivor main so you know what it’s like getting tunneled.
---
If they survive, good, they had fun and you aren’t rushing up ranks.  If you hook everyone three times, good, everyone in the lobby got a lot of points and had an intense game.
---
Get BBQ ASAP!  Its a free 2x event all year round.
---
I was a survivor main for over a year.  Now I’m a friendly killer (I usually don’t kill until red ranks).  I play everyone except the meta killers (Billy/spirit/nurse/hag).  
---
Because of my focus on chases and hooking everyone twice I have become a better killer.  I now average nearly 28k without killing until red.  Then it varies.
---
Early on I’d focus on the basics.  Understanding what hits you can make (through windows/pallets/end of lunge).  You can quick swipe or lunge further depending on how long you hold down the melee button.  Pushing survivors away from strong loops.  Pay attention to which loops are a waste of time.  (If a survivor has balanced landing and is looping a Haddenfield building, forget it).  If a survivor isn’t looking back, they’re less likely to attempt a 360.  Saving 3 gens with in proximity for the end is huge.  When picking up survivors, face a wall/tree.  When you find a survivor on a gen, it’s usually best to chase the survivor and kick the gen after catching them.  Learn when to use abilities.  Sometimes it’s better to just hit them.  Trap the shack window outside.
---
The flashlight beam reflected off of his chrome mask and blinded you. Well played tbh.
---
Now if only dailies worked that way.
---
Depends on the loop
---
i played against 3 spirits in a row and depipped each game since my team got slaughtered into hell and she could always phase to me after a hook due to BBQ and her insane phasing speed, no way i could've gotten the hatch
---
Right!
---
* Common media repost (e.g. Sharp Hand Joe, kid dancing in front of a Myers mannequin, "Die, Bitch" scene from Scary Movie 2, the "Your eyes on drugs" meme featuring The Doctor, ...).
---
I’m liking this sassy Meyers persona haha
---
"MYERS CAN'T LOOK AT ME?!"
---
*Meg scream*
---
True but there has to be a point where the meta is balanced enough to not affect past killers (unless over time they get power creeped which seems to slow be coming the case), I personally believe now the meta is pretty balanced on the killer side, but I know I’m in the minority so it’s all good lol
---
If you play this game regularly you should get 9000 iridescent shards which can get you a non original dlc killer like the doctor, hag, clown, and spirit.
---
That's how I got doctor just from grinding

Isn't the campfire populated by the Survivors you played the last game with?

It has been quite some time since I have played with or against an Ash.
---
All the toxic players that main killer play spirit.
---
I like it but there whole “another hit thing” has to be throw out. 
---
It needs to reworked because it’s really either good or horrible. 
---
And making a killer hit 3 times sucks but let’s make it a 4th with syringes lol. Maybe even 5 times with a good deadhard.
---
The secret ingredient is deranking
---
I agree that nerfing spirit would be a lot easier and quicker than buffing those other killers, but I just think making those other guys more viable is better for the game’s health overall.
---
This is amazing dude
---
Using anecdotes from reddit is weak evidence. I've played over a thousand hours of DBD. People DC, but it isn't every match. I get a DC once every several games at most. Many days I get on and don't even see a DC. Of the few that do, most of them would have died anyways.  
---
If you look at reddit as an indicator of how many people DC you are going to get the wrong impression. All you see on here are the people who are upset because they just got screwed over by a DC. What you don't see posted are the majority of games where there were no DCs, and nothing remarkable happened.
---
How important is it to know how to 180/360 spin for a survivor? I'm rank 8 and still can never pull them off.
---
I’m so fucking happy you drew Carson as Steve. I love this
---
I see John Cena...
---
Have you considered... if you know she has BBQ... countering BBQ? You can see when someone goes down, you can see when someone gets picked up... Not that hard to either get within 40 meters or go into a locker.

You guys are missing my point, lol. The Entity empowers the killers to be stronger than they actually are. It's how they get their powers. But someone like Michael doesn't even need the assistance of a dark entity to be a fucking badass.
---
Old meme that has been used several times...
---
Doing gods work
---
They do for a lot of slower builds (tombstone myers, bamboozle builds, end game remember me/bloodwarden builds, etc.
---
DS does exist and can be used throughout the game. Adrenaline and hope are basically the survivor equivalent to bloodwarden and remember me except you can outplay bloodwarden pretty easily by just not opening the gates until the killer hooks whoever was downed/starts another chase.
---
Pigs traps work the way they do because she's meant to have the upper hand going into the endgame. 
---
Open gates =/= survivors win, why would you think that when such end game perks exist.
---
Except with all of the builds I mentioned, it can be annoying for the survivors to get out for free because key. Or even if the last 2 survivors 3 genned themselves but it doesn't matter because key. Or if you're watching the exit gates but, oh would you look at that, a survivor has a key so all 3 of the ones left alive get out anyway. Even if you close the hatch for the last person in a match, it just straight up doesn't matter if they have a key; they just get to escape with no method of counter play available.
---
Keys aren't rare because they're not useful, they're rarely used because they're valuable. If you're using a key for the add ons, you use a green key but then it's not as helpful as a toolbox or a medkit but if you use above that, then it's the equivalent to using a purple (or iridescent, even though they don't exist) toolbox or medkit which most people also won't do. 
---
Moris are more common because they're actually usable when they're green, even if they are substantially weaker.
---
And gen rush is like face camping, it only seems good until you either let two survivors die (gen rush) or let two survivors live (face camp). Toolboxes aren't fun to play against but its more the equivalent of nurse or spirit than it is a mori.
---
So your the guy who was blocking the ruin I found!
---
there have been a bunch of threads on it since yesterday.. everyone has speculated its the guy from the archives.
---
You are comparing her to one of the weakest killers just to purposefully inflate her strengths. Okay.
---
Her movement speed while cloaked isn´t "tremendously" increased, you have to use add-ons for that. And your comparison is utter bullshit because you are comparing perma-invis with aura visibility to temporary invis with cooldown and hidden auras while invisible. Like, wtf?

You listed multiple downsides in your post. She can be mindgamed, she can be countered with multiple perks, she has less movement speed and needs to use her power to catch up, and can be evaded in her power if you know how to do it. Her power can literally be heard (and don´t go telling me about add-ons, I asked about why her BASE power is so strong in your opinion). I had survivors easily leave gen with urban evasion, fixated or iron will as soon as they heard me coming and hid.
---
She doesn´t have good map control unlike killers like Billy, she doesn´t have built-in instadowns, she is slower, cannot break pallets instantly like Demo/Billy, I could go on but she DOES have weaknesses, ones that you can exploit if you just run perks that help with it and if you adjust your playstyle.
---
Let me be clear here, I am not saying she is a weak killer, even though me listing her weaknesses does paint that picture. She is absolutely strong, and her add-ons are definitely in need of tweaks. But her base power is fine, just because you cannot counter her like other killers ("waiting at pallets or windows") does not mean she is ovepowered.
---
Are these level 2 challenges?
---
Aye, my friend.
---
Yeah I see
---
Welp I do that too when people are super altruistic to get the savior, which most of the time has bt so it's pointless hit the farmed guy
---
Even like that I get DSed too. Idk, to do something like that your team might have done insta unhooks often
---
I usually hook twice and let go. But at rank 7-8 I see to many really good red ranks. It’s funny tho, the ones that’s say eassssssyyyyy are the ones with lower ranks and I try to get everyone chases and 2 hooks

Eh noobish or not the best advice I can give you is play to have fun. 
---
If you are having a bad time just quit for the day or a hour or so. 
---
That’s the advice everyone should take but sadly some don’t and you can see it because they start to get toxic and it carries through each and every game they play.
---
Damn man that hits me home exactly. I always try to give hatch to either people who carry, had a bad game, or are new. It's sad to get salt messages (usually for a 1 time use of noed or op add-ons) from the person you have hatch to... 
---
It's getting harder and harder to spread the kindness when there is limitless toxicity around...
---
One of the better ghostface cosplays if you ask me. Take my arrows sir
---
He doesn’t need to do that. Playing normally and u disturb enough crowd lol
---
To be fair I explained exactly why the evidence was flawed, and pointed out that those accounts are from one off events, which are inherently biased. My own experience, while still technically anecdotal, is at least the cumulative data from many thousands of games.
---
There’s been like 6 new killers, as well as DS getting nerfed, insta heals getting nerfed, exhaustion needing you to not be sprinting, and the new hallowed blight event is out.
---
Honestly at this point I'd be fine if it was just fully removed from the game and replaced by another mediocre perk that is at least useable
---
Well on PS4 you can’t see this do to the shitty graphics and shitty FPS!!! Maybe if the incompetent devs actually updated their game and brought it into the 21st century we could see that! Anyone else on PS4 has some killer clean graphics and then you load in DBD and it looks like something from PS2.

So you play bubba without ruin at rank 5 and do fine..
---
Sure buddy, at least be believable when you lie
---
Not having a main, that's the first tip
---
Yes it is, but I will keep doing my best, im purple on both sides so I know why both sides get angry though, its like a stand off
---
I agree, it's actually part of the reason I'm venting is to just blow off some steam.
---
My mains:
---
- **Trapper** - Be unpredictable in laying traps, always carry a bag to carry multiple traps and fake placing traps to break the loop.
---
- **Plague** - Always keep moving, try to keep all 4 survs infected. Dont be greedy about corruption vile. Equip them only when Survs lead you to one and try to loop nearby.
---
I guess could be a more stateful perk kinda like second wind. Make it so when you are put into the Dying State within 60 seconds of being unhooked, you get the chance to stun them next time you are picked up unless "revived".
---
you're right it doesn't say they need to drop them, hopefully that's the case
---
That’s always the worst on ps4, I have messages turned off so someone sent me a friend request just so they could leave a message through that and go off on me but they were so vague that I couldn’t understand what they were talking about lmao
---
Yeah the tribalism is crazy... I try to play fair most of the time. Though it's really impossible in certain situations.
---
Nurse ignores pallets, windows, survivor's distance, loops. Literally everything except immersion.
---
God, i wish he was a survivor.  
---
Need the green syringes as a charm.
---
Lol I watch movies, shows or YouTube. 
---
Sometimes I’ll rewatch deadmeat, best YouTube channel lol.
---
Omg DS already got a rework lol its strong as is. Doesn't need a buff or a nerf. Let's just leave it where it is
---
I just want to thank you for being a kind person trying to brighten up the Halloween event for everyone!
---
End game nurse?
---
Omg James a janisse is the bestest boi
---
Nea should have been the one pointing lol.
---
Freddy: you're a control based killer. If somebody tries to loop you, use your snares to control the flow.
---
Ghostface: nightshroud is an incredibly strong ability for loops where survivors dont have vision.
---
Use it with I'm all ears and you will have the advantage in most loops.
---
Yeah, I needed to do the challenge where you need to sacrifice one survivor during the Endgame Collapse so I decided to use a full endgame build since I need to get there anyway
---
What does gg wp mean?
---
I rage about both sides so it’s so hard to know if I want changes or buffs IDK MAN IM SO CONFLICTED
---
I didn’t bitch at you. I pointed out ways you could try to outplay the killer. You guys are ridiculous thinking that anything needs to be a “guaranteed” outplay. That’s where skill and luck are involved. But if you’re going to take that as “bitching” too then I’ll hop on out of here so you can can continue to suck at the game and DC your little hearts out. I’m obviously not going to change the mind of anyone who thinks like that.
---
Oh! I love when people understand references lol. 
---
Herbert west is like a good guy/villain but more good lol. 
---
I can totally see him being on really either side as a killer who unleashes his reanimations or as a survivor. 
---
But he’s probably try to inject green goo into the killers lol.
---
She's too busy being looped by another man
---
I love his appearances in the killer music video and in certain channels like crypt tv. Funny enough I actually saw his reference on crypt before I saw his video on it. Needless to say the surprise was fucking awesome.
---
Bamboozle is a good perk. I'm not to great with it and I almost never use it but it's a good perk if you use it well.
---
Fuck yes!
---
Theres a chance he might not know who it is and he's trying to get the mask off so he can be like "KEVIN, THIS IS SUPER UNACCEPTABLE"   "SERIOUSLY"
---
I'm just waiting for someone to complain about NOED. I'm waiting...
---
Infinite or just really long? I havent had infinite, but I get "Disconnected from host" frozen screen followed by a really long loading screen followed by error and sent back to the main menu
---
The way the Claudette just stood there, looked you dead in the face and accepted her fate
---
Yes, by saying I have that opinion because I take them from Reddit?? Which I never said or mentioned but by making that point is easier attack my point and make me sound dumb. Dude, those debate tactics don't work on me, I'm sorry
---
Your points are anecdote as mine, plus I get around to see data from BHVR and different opinions from other people, content creators included. Just by trying to dismiss my argument by making one I never made out of your ass, just show how dishonest you are. I don't even believe you have thousand of hours at this point if you lie in such a manner
---
YOU LITERALLY JUST PULLED THIS SHIT!
---
&gt; “You sound like a salty killer main”. Nice way to take constructive  criticism. “Can’t guarantee” means you need to play better. Maybe if you  spent less time DCing you’d get better at the game =\*( 
---
Are you that THICK or what man?  It's pretty blatant that you can't handle people disagreeing with you.
---
Just bleeding
---
I feel like survivor can be annoying or idiotic at worst, but killer can be out-right infuriating like nothng else in the game.
---
I play by both almost equally to stay cool minded.
---
I have more fun as a survivor and I feel accomplished if I do good as killer.
---
I can’t find the crypt that fun to watch but I respect them because they are fucking dope. 
---
Also you seem like a guy to enjoy this, go to my recent dbd post you may enjoy a hidden gem in a movie I love that i recently watched.
---
She was also the Rancor :D
---
Clown closes loops and eats pallets faster than any other killer except new freddy who does basically the same thing and wraith who just does it in reverse.
---
I actually was reading it as we were messaging back and forth and I very much enjoyed it!
---
I never said that, I just said that bbq and chilli is better then wglf because you spent your real life money on it where as wglf is a free perk that only needs BP to unlock, if they made them the same I would’ve been robbed of 5 bucks and pissed off and many others would be too, BBQ is better then WGLF and that should t change.
---
That's a fancy wording for 'I can't win this one, gotta bail'.
---
Have a fruitful life instead of shitsposting on dbd reddit all day every day, cheers :)
---
All but 3 far each side seem pretty do-able. the blind, plunderer, unhooking, and the basement sacrifice, NOED, and catching the same surv 5x are pretty rough though
---
Fuck if the game had taunts and killers talking that would be great. 
---
Every time Freddy hits a survivor it’s either a good cheesy one liner or a really bad one lol.
---
Haha. Line em up and knock em down. Nice meme.
---
yeahh!! i agree with this when the killer is a camper.
---
It’s broken. I had a mori challenge and once I realized I didn’t receive my 60k points I went back and it changed to escape with jake. Sry to the team I moried.
---
Lol I thought you would.
---
Is the only thing you can purchase with putrid serum the killer halloween outfits?
---
What do you gain from this comment?
---
Lol at that trappers mouth.
---
The others need to be buffed for sure but no one will care about them being buffed if the stuff they current use goes unchanged.
---
As a legion main, I find this video really satisfying
---
been happening to me a lot too
---
frustrating but remember to always send the report and try to give as much information as possible. what offerings were used, who you were, what map it was gonna be (if you have a swf friend to tell you). 
---
the more info you give the easier time they'll have finding out what's wrong
---
Ouch extra insult to almost escaping
---
Why did I read "cutie" with noob3 voice....
---
Pointless, they are generally starting to remove the tier's usefulness. Think noed, ruin, and the very newly changed plunderers instinct.
---
Can’t tell you how many times I died on first hook last night, while 1 guy was working on a gen and my other two teammates were literally standing in a corner with their dicks in their hand. All random solo on PS4 and then eventually some of my friends finally got on and we had some fun, we recorded and reported this Claudette for throwing the game last night, doubt she will get banned since BhVR has no balls...
---
Jesus marie, they're minerals!

Yeah maybe it’s a glitch with the new killers that spawn in undetectable

I thought of something like that too, but just think of how long the queue would end up being if we split the community like that, still a good idea tho
---
Hey I play both sides, but I am offended to have Nea as my character. Sure I know the gag that she is a killer, but come on...she ugly!!!
---
Possibly
---
Yeah,  it's just a trash tier list.

You know, he has a crossover comic with Ash. Would be neat to them together again.

---
Bug, will be fixed next patch
---
no, im comparing her to one of the weakest killers because she is literally just a better version of that killer, in  every single way, they are not different, she is just better, there is NO reason for a killer to be a direct upgrade to one killer, atleast bubba has a different play style compared to billy. id argue she has great map control because her phasing is like a chainsaw sprint without the instadown but with way more maneuverability, and id also argue that pallets are a complete death sentence because she can mindgame that without even trying. id you're right, i did list a few downsides, and you are right, she is absolutely strong. but she's too easy to play to be that strong, my problem isnt that shes super strong, my problem is that the skill needed to be super strong when using spirit is so low that i get frustrated seeing someone who misses 3 whole ass swings mid-chase and kills me 30 seconds later because she phases into my ass and downs me, i dont see why she should be so powerful if she's so easy to play, so im just saying either nerf her so her power is atleast somewhat tied to her skill ceiling or make it harder to play her, im not saying to make her f tier, dude, i know im repeating myself here but she just shouldnt be that good when shes so easy to play
---
Lol, ty too
---
Which are still poorly balanced since they essentially handicap players for doing very well. DS can also easily be played around and that's if they can effectively hit the skill check. Also they're not the equivalent to those perks, Adrenaline and other end game perks to help escape a winning game while MOST of the killers endgame perks essentially offer a free win in most situations with few earned such as players teabagging a gate only to realize blood warden just proc'd. To be doing extremely well all game only to be instantly downed via NOED. 
---
And you can kill a survivor before they reach the hatch even if they don't have a key, It's happened to me plenty as survivors must avoid a deadly chase which will usually put them behind the killer while looking for the hatch. The killer can also grab you out of the animation among everything else I mentioned in favor of mori- which cannot be stopped. They are not comparable.  
---
Personally I don't use a key because I actually play for the win, Not to do extremely well only to be cucked by noed or mori mid-match. If i did plan on playing around mori i sure as hell wouldn't bring a key, it would be perks to avoid detection at all costs because the killer is faster than a survivor, And they can easily tag on Iridescent stuff to essentially stomp survivors. Cough "Iridescent axe head + 2 Axes". 
---
I've given more than enough PROOF that keys are not comparable to mori's in between the fucking escape to mori ratios to usability in a match and there's no imaginary line that could disagree and make sense.  
---
We're talking about Ebony mori's here, Every example i made used Ebony's effect so there's no reason why they should be brought up unless you're trying to switch the tier of the mori. 
---
Gen rushing is as much like face camping as mori is comparable to a key.  
---
Lastly survivors cannot mori the killer on their first hook- therefore they are not the same.
---
good game well played :)
---
Hey, and that's understandable. I prefer killer, but I play both.
---
It’s the same in Germany, that you can do what you want. But no one above the age of let’s say 30, would look at a 19 year old and be like oh yeah that’s an equal to me.
---
Serves you right for camping a pallet &gt;:)
---
No but in all seriousness that’s pretty fucking ridiculous lol, spaghetti coding
---
So it was a feature?
---
I would love to have a true casual mode where people go into the game with fun in mind over sweating for the win. However I don't know how you would implement that and keep people from playing super try hard in the casual mode. Lets be real, people will absolutely go to casual mode and run sweaty builds (on both sides) to have easy games. 
---
Even if you were to disabled certain perks/ items/ addons I don't know how you would prevent things like a killer face camping or survivors bullying a newbie.
---
Qeue times are already to long. If they have ranked and casual qeues I probably wouldnt play anymore unless qeue times were fixed also. They might as well lock out playing against dlc killers and maps unless you have the dlc while we are at it .
---
Oh that’s fucking dope. I didn’t know they made comics for those 2 characters. I was even surprised to see Hellraiser has comics and I need to get them lol.
---
Yes, and david
---
You are input? Sick grammar
---
That’s just objectively a buff lol
---
Right , Thanks for the tips I'll try em next time I'm on DBD

Yeah that’s were the kinda comes into play

man this is so great
---
shhhhh
---
Ye i thought they removed that, i just walked onto the bale and lunged to hit them but i cant do that fsm anymore?
---
they said all DBD characters are "international adults", i.e a fancy way of saying "yeah ok, they are 21 pls don't sue for violence on minors"
---
The only thing is that your eyebrows are much better and .. exist. Hers are just M.I.A.
---
did you see "save 3 teammates during endgame collapse in a single trial"?
---
Thanks I thought it meant welp now I feel stupid
---
Ye idk guess they removed it
---
When it works as an anti-tunneling perk, it's fine, but sometimes it allows survivors to make ridiculous plays because they know the killer can't pick them up without eating it. During endgame it's practically broken. My solution would be to make it so you lose DS if another survivor is hooked, because at that point the killer definitely didn't tunnel.

I occasionally proxy camp on pig I'm not gonna lie. But that's if they always save immediately after I leave. So I pretend to leave, then crouch and walk back. It's a free slug on the unhook and injury on the altruistic survivor. Works great against flashlight clicking groups because they are too altruistic.
---
That's probably what I'm thinking of

She’s still the strongest killer in the game

Slightly strong than spirit imo

Do it.

I can confirm this issue. I think the nurse changes have broken the daily for now...
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) got u bro
---
Even part 1 Neji wasn't edgy, he was just stubborn and arrogant. Gaara was edgy, especially after he went to kill Lee in the hospital.
---
I’m probably the worst killer in the game, but for the archieves I played spirit and it wasn’t that hard.
---
Oh, you mean like how killers learned to counter old DS, MoM, and Insta heals, and didn't just beg for nerfs and move on?
---
Oh wait...
---
Also, killers run the same pool of perks just like survivors do. They just have more viable perks so it gives off the illusion that killers experiment more.
---
:(
---
This is a different issue related to dailies in general.
---
"I've seen and people admitting, DC against legion, doctor, spirit, nurse anything really
---
Even just if a killer bring certain add ons or get downed first. "  
---
I'm not making anything up here. I assumed you meant you saw this stuff on Reddit, because where else would you be seeing it, the DBD forums? Either case it's the same thing.   
---
You explicitly referenced other individuals admitting to disconnecting. There is no way to extract a percentage, a ratio, a probability, or anything else that can be used to gather a conclusion, because it doesn't relates the number of disconnections to the number of players overall. Since BHVR hasn't released any data on DCs yet, the anecdotal evidence that comes from the experience of players who have played thousands of matches is literally the best evidence available. Unfortunate as that may be, we have nothing else.
---
That looks great! You draw really well
---
She took time to master to begin with, especially on console, kind of a slap in the face for players who took the time to learn her.
---
Dm me your email, I'll share the doc with you
---
Yeah, I was moreso thinking of when Neji was all 'destiny cant change, we're born with something and cant change fate' and stuff like that, which is a bit edge but under his circumstances, it makes sense he'd think that way tbh.
---
But yeah, Gaara was 100% edgy.
---
Good luck doing that challenge without anyone DCing lol. Its impossible for me!
---
I love that he just casually breaks the pallet, then looks at you and is like "heh, oh yeah, you suck btw"
---
I would be more than happy to trade Spirit nerfs for buffs to other killers
---
Hey, I play Steve all the time and I've been playing for a long time 😂
---
Oh btw I salute you for searching for new, I see you are commenting on most of them lol
---
That's cringy as fuck
---
I main as a survivor but I don't complain unless it someone 15 or lower with a high level monster with good perks, body guarding because they have experience and should get better at hunting, idc what monster you use or if I'm first one dead don't body gaurd
---
tf is boomer?
---
he procc  
---
he attac  
---
but most importantly he made Nea a cat.
---
Misses skill check, spine chill flashes 
---
Aight imma head out
---
If a white ward is activated the key is actually taken out of the game and I specifically mentioned having the killer watch over the corpse (Could it be for the key you killed the survivor for possessing? Hmmmmmmm?) 
---
That is not the equivalent of anything, IF anything it would just make the killer more aware of where the hatch is and since he can get there before the hooked person completely dies the hatch will still be closed for the killer to shut. 
---
That is if he is still alive as the game is already over. It is also unlikely as the survivor isn't told where the hatch is once it is closed so instead of the hum they would have to find it. The killer can easily end the chase in a map exhausted of pallets before then as it's happened to me many times before. 
---
The exit gates are not powered if the hatch  is closed while there are generators and more than one person left. The hatch will remain closed and survivors will play through the match as they normally would. With that comment you clearly lack a lot of experience with the situation of survivors, With that much of a gap it would be impossible for you to understand both sides of mori vs a key.
---
Yeah..... "fixed" ... how about fixing somthing that the suvivors have, like deadhard,adrenalin or so many other 2chance perks ?
---
have you ever played without ruin before
---
Just a piece of the dress haha
---
It's not the bug that changes the daily, I still have the same daily.
---
A dev on the steam forums confirmed that the Spirit is far over performing and will be addressed.

Thank god.

"anti tunnel" yeah
---
Me: hooks someone other than the guy who just got unhooked

Walks across map
---
Downs someone, I don't realize that it's the ds guy immediately
---
Get hit by DS
---
"Damn sorry for tunnelling." And I am a 50/50 player, i want moris butchered. Prayer beads too.
---
Didn't read anything after "you can grab them out of the animation" because that's actively not true anymore. Which means you've not properly played around hatch since endgame collapse came out which was months ago. If a survivor has a key and they find hatch, they get out and there's nothing you can do about us as killer now. 
---
Regardless though, you keep complaining about noed when the only time I've mentioned it was to say I don't use it. Yes, it's overpowered and could use a nerf similar to DS's. But not every killer uses it so acting like it's just taken for granted that you'll always get killed with noed before you find hatch is just disingenuous.
---
figured as much.
---
atleast she plays smoother now on PS (for me)

I won't lie and pretend for a fact I knew he was trying to pull a fast one, but that fact he was extremely toxic in-game and with messages leads me to believe that was the intention.
---
And I was mainly salty about the after game messages. Not to mention that 4k =/= fun a game. They honestly played very annoyingly (like t-bagging after pallet camping every pallet).
---
This made me laugh so hard, thank you for this😂
---
Yeah it’s not a good thing lol.

It’s a horrible habit mate.

---
"negative affect" is too vague. Like mangled from sloppy butcher? Or the exhausted status affect?

Some affects don't have a duration like sloppy.
---
Cool idea nonetheless

Fair criticism but I feel like it’s just to show other people how far you are in the rift

No, that's 3 'at the same time'. This is just 4 in general.

I guess but personally I find it redundant
---
These are really funny, I love the editing
---
level 4.
---
who does spirit look like
---
The whole point is to punish tunneling. Obviously it would be way longer if the killer tunnels the unhooked survivor, but now survivors can’t take advantage of it either because if the killer doesn’t interact with them at all for 30 seconds, ds is gone.
---
This would result in more cases of ds punishing hard tunneling, and less cases of survivors taking advantage of it by getting the killer to grab them off a gem in the last five seconds that ds was active.
---
Tried that daily last night, over 2 games and none of my hits after blinks counted. Tried a wraith "hit 4 survivors after coming out of cloak" daily and got it first try.
---
It was literally a compliment

Cheers, I'll think on what you've said and make changes!

People always hating on Legion so it doesn’t even matter imo. At the end of the day it’s how the person plays that matters. Legion is in no way that low, but you know what? People gonna have their own opinion. Can’t do nothing about it.

Omg, I need this perk
---
Did you see that it's on the shrine now?
---
Yeah that could be interesting, maybe post an idea on here? Was thinking the map could be dracula's castle or something like that or a graveyard type
---
Rather than it pause when you go down, it should pause if the killer is within say 40 meters.
---
I understand that and I am not saying it should've been extremely unique items with complex designs at every level but these recolors are kinda lame. Hell, even other charms would've been nice.
---
When does the bloodhunt ends ?
---
The way DS is now serves its purpose. The timer is there for a reason, to cancel the timer b/c someone else gets hooked makes no sense, and actually would make the perk weak. 
---
Why is the locker bullshit? It forces someone to pick you up, or you can use it as a fake/mind game. This is a very poor argument. The killer can just leave you alone or take the ds and get rid of it. This is the kind of argument that sounds like it comes from someone who plays one side.
---
It is completely random when perks show up in the bloodweb. Just gotta hope that luck is on your side. There are ways you can manipulate the entity to eat up large chunks of bloodweb so you level up quicker. Also, if you have the option, go for tier 3 perks first, so that they will no longer appear in the web (this giving you a better chance of getting BBQ).
---
For a second I thought this was supposed to be a killer perk and so I was immediately like "fuck no that is the most unbalanced shit I ever seen"
---
Seems pretty good as a survivor perk as well though, it would basically be a stronger bond though since exhausted, mangled and exposed are all pretty common to have at some point, and would hex:ruin count?
---
Definitely. However it better suites the role of "anti-tunnel" as it is the immediate down and subsequent hooking that defines tunneling. You can't, in good faith, call downing someone 10 seconds after they've been unhooked and standing on their body for 50 seconds before re-hooking them "not tunneling"
---
Adjust the timing a bit but otherwise I think it's way better. Personally, I think the "home free" time should scale with remaining gens to allow more counterplay on the killers side during the endgame
---
Your OP never said he was toxic in game or post game. Saying "you could've given me the hatch for my challenge" is like the least toxic salty comment someone could make lmao.
---
idk
---
Luckily, I do the P3 Pig head as my default costume for Pig, so it works out. The blood I use is also water activated, so it washed off easy.
---
And I was explaining why I use a mori.  You don't have to agree, but this is a reason why killers may come across as a prick during the event. If there is any inkling that I have a toxic survivor,  I will use the tools provided by the game to deal with them. Downvote away, I dont care. I have 4k hours in this game, have every perk unlocked for every character, so I have 0 incentive to play for points or to play nice with anybody, as is my prerogative.  Disagree,  that's fine. But this is why killers can be dicks.
---
Buff weak killers never
---
After you kill them all, you gotta kill yourself
---
Out of ideas, they had so much potential for some cool unique charms but I guess they’re saving them for next rift
---
This pose makes me want to hug you
---
I always do new posts it’s more interesting. And because you spend time on here when you could be doing better things with your life lol. No offense.
---
If 60s DS is broken at endgame then what about bloodwarden?
---
Monday
---
That David wasn't going to mess around.
---
It's not the point, I play survivor at Red to Purple ranks and push through ruin so it isn't that hard. People just run around looking for it all game instead.
---
No problem :)
---
Same for me. I've to close the game after almost every games.
---
I swear if they dont add ot then whats the point or porting it
---
This hit too close to home 😂
---
Their username is LadyXev? So idk
---
***SNOOT BOOPS***
---
What do you mean water activated? What is the blood you're using made out of so that it doesn't permanently damage the mask?
---
Mate,being on here long enough I’ve seen it all lol. 
---
There’s way more entitled survivor mains then there is killer mains.
---
Init there ain’t much point.
---
My killer main is :
---
#Legion
---
Keep pressure on the survivors and don't let them do gens. Use anti-heal builds and game-slowing and most importantly, do not stick to a chase if it takes too long. If you chase someone around too long you're gonna get gen rushed in no time.
---
Ah yes, let me stand at this empty hook for the rest of the match because if a survivor takes 2 seconds to pick up this key then they can get out, even with the gates closed. Face camping a dead survivor isn't exactly the best counter. It's like telling a survivor to just leave their teammates on hook to counter noed or to cleanse all of the totems before completing the last gen just in case. It doesn't solve the problem and just makes playing that much more of a pain. 
---
Unless it's a stealth killer, the survivor will usually be able to find hatch by using the killer's terror radius. 
---
Even then, it's not impossible to just look for hatch without the sound effect. Especially on some maps (such as play school where it's always in the same spot).
---
Alright then, I was mistaken since I've never closed a hatch with more than 2 survivors alive but it can still skip an entire gen and give the other survivor powered gates. I fail to see how that derails my argument. Still not accounting for the fact that for 3 survivors to be in the map at the same time as hatch, all gens must be completed anyway.
---
Push comes to shove, it can guarantee 2 escapes if the survivors are 3 genned or 3 if you're defending the gates. Or one if they're the last one alive. In descending order of difficulty.
---
Then I play both sides and still get dismissed as a survivor main. Fun times.
---
Her eyes dude
---
GF can be punished when he make mistakes, and is add-on dependant
---
Yours is the argument that sounds like it comes from one side. I'd rather reduce the timer by 10 or so seconds for every down and have it just not work on grabs period. Running into a locker completely removes the slugging counterplay.
---
I kinda forgot these things exist. I always buy DLCs right away so I never get them.
---
&gt;I'm not making anything up here. I assumed you meant you saw this stuff on Reddit, because where else would you be seeing it, the DBD forums? Either case it's the same thing.   
---
My own experience. Like you just used yours, the difference is you lied about my point to look weaker and hypocritically use anecdotes when you said they are weak in the first place
---
Dude.. stop
---
&gt;You explicitly referenced other individuals admitting to disconnecting. There is no way to extract a percentage, a ratio, a probability, or anything else that can be used to gather a conclusion, because it doesn't relates the number of disconnections to the number of players overall. Since BHVR hasn't released any data on DCs yet, the anecdotal evidence that comes from the experience of players who have played thousands of matches is literally the best evidence available. Unfortunate as that may be, we have nothing else.
---
Yeah and I don't even believe you since you showed how dishonest you are! This is a problem spoken also in a stream with several content creators, forums, steam, Reddit and my personal experience too
---
So in this case, for your dishonesty, and for saying 'my anecdotes are better than yours' argument. I won't take anything you say seriously. Here and anywhere you're gonna post from now on
---
I find it annoying so I don’t do it as Killer but when i’m slugged as a Survivor I just go afk, let crows spawn and wish the other Survivor luck. I’m not attempting to get picked up again to be knocked back down and have that repeat for 5-10 minutes, especially with multiple gens to go.
---
As if 4 man swf wouldn't DC the first time somebody gets grabbed with prayer beads
---
Okay but what perks should I equip to counter the DCs that will be ruin the chances
---
On that note, I shouldn't be punished for people playing that dumb and they shouldn't be able to do that. I have to 1 waste the time slugging which might entail a chase or 2 break off and let them run around freely getting a generator or some other stupid stuff. There shouldn't be a mechanic in the game that lets people delay for playing like morons.
---
Richard Kuklinsli is believed to have killed his first person at around 13. He beat his childhood bully to death with a baseball bat.
---
So, yeah. Legion is a believable killer.

---
I apologize if my comments are coming off as hostile, I promise you that's not how I want you to read them. I just genuinely didn't understand what they did wrong. Adding in the context of them tbagging you all game helps make it a bit more understandable.
---
Honestly, I didn't come here to defend them, I actually came into this thread expecting to feel sorry for you as I love chill killers who don't sweat. I always make sure to go out of my way to thank them for the fun match. It sucks when people play the way you did and then hear that the survivors were super toxic to them anyway, but your OP didn't really say they did anything wrong. 
---
As for the hatch thing, I agree! There's no way you could've known he was doing a challenge and even if you did its not like they're entitled to having it. There's absolutely nothing wrong with killing the last guy instead of giving him the hatch. I just don't think that comment he made in the post game chat was all that toxic.. Like yea it comes off as him being a little salty, but its not like he was ripping on you for not letting him have it.
---
I want to buy several of the dlc but I'm waiting to see how they handle this before I spend anymore money.  Any update would be nice.
---
hail vommy mommy
---
The game should match your desktop resolution, at least it used to.
---
\*Instant DC\*
---
I make it myself. Corn syrup, red food coloring, and a little bit of black icing (for texture and color). It's easy on skin and actually acts as a moisturizer, and comes off of the mask easily. I've redone it, and you can't tell it was ever bloodied once cleaned up.
---
I would think once they're picked up, the perk can't "activate" again until they've been hooked
---
Please make sure it requires two swings, like in the past. Recently the Harvester tile was changed so that killers could get around the side with just one swing, and even hit the survivor at the same time, which essentially made the tile unusable for survivors against killers aware of this tech.
---
Years if playing sports games with meters has made me great at the skill checks in dbd. Generators with ruin or lullaby rarely even give me trouble.
---
But don't worry, I'm not mad at ya. It will still be me that costs the team the game by doing really stupid stuff and sucking at looping.
---
Me too, but many time person will either kill themselves or killer will play badly to the point of not catching anyone or camp or teammate saving the guy 0.0000000000000000001 milliseconds before me
---
Yes. So? Still freaking difficult since gens run so fast and ruin is a life saver even if for a little bit
---
Just the fact you say, with bubba, arguably the worst killer in the game, you're fine without ruin and not get gen rushed in 3min is hilarious
---
Unless you play in some country where people barely play DbD in the first place or are kinda bad. Which is a possibility, not denying that
---
Love the content op. Keep it up.
---
Let's be real. No Nea main plays both sides.
---
&gt;Base game - £5
---
The game is 20 euros on steam, what are you on?
---
&gt; DLC - £2-3 
---
The dlcs range from 3 euros to 12 euros, with an average of 7 euros.
---
&gt; Let's not forget the DLC packs they gave us for free too 
---
The what
---
&gt; The game hasn't changed for you at all. 
---
You know, that's the saddest part, and you said it. The game has been a buggy mess for a long time now, and a huge number of bugs are just never going to be fixed because there is no extra cash to reap from them. The only reason for DBD's playercount now is that there is no serious competitor for this genre. If a mid-sized studio decided to make the same kind of game, but with less attrocious spitting in the player's face with bugs and microtransactions DBD would have no chance. BHVR has been able to just cruise on autopilot with skinpack releases and clunky dlcs, that I doubt they would be able to 'put up a fight' against a competitor.
---
&gt; but unfortunately that's the state of the industry 
---
And us, the players should not give a penny for microtransactions to discourage devs from doing them.
---
It's all fun and games until karma hits you. And then it's funny when they DC afterwards for making a fool of themselves.
---
Not terribly important - it's just an additional mindgame that can buy you a few seconds in any chase that happens between tiles.
---
Thank you! I've been doing corpse paint for a few years now. I adore black metal, so, I figured I may as well do it.
---
I love when people just basically say "no u" instead of making a good counterpoint. 
---
DS was already nerfed super hard. It used to be OP. Now it seems a lot more balanced, this is coming from someone who's a much better killer than survivor. Not working in grabs makes absolutely zero sense from a gameplay consistency standpoint. It's the same reason removing Spirit bumping into people doesn't make sense, despite being a good idea on paper. It's already a highly situational perk, since smart killers just fuck off for a minute and go chase something else, requiring someone to stop doing gens and come get you. 
---
Reducing timer for 10s is such a survivor main thing to say. That would encourage slugging even more, which is generally already considered a douchebag move, other than in the aforementioned situation with DS. It would make DS actually weak. Now, it's strong in certain situations, but by no means OP.
---
Well they didn't. And they all escaped and bullied me in chat. So that was fun.
---
The best situation for a killer imo is (excluding more than one hooked/downed cause obviously that’s better):
---
1 on the hook
---
1 on the ground
---
1 in chase
---
1 who cares
---
In this situation, you have total control. DS doesn’t come into play unless you make it. If someone gets a farm, go after the farmer. If you see the guy just pulled, down him and leave. If he’s down he’s not doing gens and someone has to heal him. There are plenty of ways to counter DS not even including perks/add ons. 
---
Again I agree it can get out of hand against SWFs but it really shouldn’t matter.
---
Slugging for 3 minutes is toxic in my opinion, if you just slug for a bit, just looking quickly around to see if you can find the last player is okay in my opinion. But waiting the whole timer is really boring for everyone, and I'm OK with people dc'ing for this reason, trying to give the hatch to the last guy, it makes the game actually continue.
---
I wanna see where this is going, consider me subbed!
---
Aw a bing bong boi! Awesome costume ! Well done.
---
Honestly I felt like she was to easy. It took me one week to learn to play her, on console, but she didn’t feel rewarding unlike huntress who takes more skill but is weaker.
---
Its not toxic but its just why? why are you so desperate to 4k or so scared not to that you waste 2 peoples time. 
---
Its boring af to slug for the 4k and certainly sweaty
---
I’d even take it as a Devotion level reward.  It’s intense for new players, but after 1k hours it’s more damaging to controllers/keyboards than anything.
---
Put these on the killer hooks as a trophy for every DC you got the past 30 minutes
---
I just find it boring.  If they get the hatch, onto the next game.
---
Swimming through sick lullaby’s
---
I was stomping an overly altruistic group as Trapper and three of them grouped up and dropped their toolbox, medkit and flashlight in front of me. So I just went AFK and let them finish. I just can't have fun winning when the opponents no longer want to play it out.
---
Probably just spirit now as she is the only remaining killer with very little counterplay 
---
Billy they might nerf insta saw or at least make it a red / purple combo
---
Then after that they should buff the bottom 60% of killers
---
I'd suck you
---
Wow dude nurse is gutted!!!! Waiting less than 6 seconds for both blinks back absolutely worst killer now she’s worse than pre patch freddy even though you can still blink through walls and through floors unlike any other killer!

It’s one of the those niche things in the game that is so satisfying when it happens.
---
Honestly a fair judgement! and I honestly made this while I was salty myself... I think my judgements were a little quick and hot headed and maybe it was just something of coincidence circumstances.
---
I actually had a salty comment on my profile from a surv that I mistook as him. So I unfairly made judgements based off of that as well.
---
I'm honestly sorry if I misjudged them. I still believe they were being toxic because of how they acted but I acknowledge I might have slandered poor guys just trying to have fun.
---
But Myers was an insane cold blooded killer from childhood, while the Legion are kids being peer pressured by a drop out who wants to feel cool.

OP please sign your art and give us the clear template, such a amazing piece

I'm rank 1 and I can't really loop, I'm kinda a baby. Been playing for 2 months only.
---
Although I think it's just doing that because in the patchnotes they said this
---
"Adjusted the players usernames to prevent overlapping from the Killers point of view in the online lobby. "
---
I saw the first sentence and I started laughing.
---
Even survivors should know that old MoM and pink instaheals were broken as fuck.
---
It’s a game people play for fun. 4ks don’t matter. Unless I got a ton of points in the match, I don’t mind DCing so that the other survivor can potentially get the hatch and we can all move on to a new round. Queues are long enough as it is. I don’t wanna stay slugged for 3 mins on top of that.
---
damn, had to take a second look to notice myers in the back.
---
BHVR will never show the killer who is SWF and who isn't. This feature will bring no good to DBD and only killers dodging SWF nonstop.
---
It’s actually quite pathetic isn’t it
---
That's how we show we're ready to play. A simple SWF logo next to our level would be perfectly fine.
---
No, it can generally get out of hand in general. It's dumb that the game gives people a free out for playing bad. I get it, tunneling can get irritating. I've put time into survivor at lower ranks and it feels bad. But I also look at it that I'm playing bad if a killer can tunnel me that well. Should I get a free out for being outplayed though? Nope. I've played games against rank 2-5 the past few days, and people will assist each other so much because they have stuff like DS so they can tank hits for others without fear of getting punished. There are tons of ways DS is just a BS ability.
---
Like this: You hook 1 person, 3 others are standing around at full health to unhook. 1 gets the unhook, then I try and chase them, but the injured person will body block knowing if they go down knowing I can't hook them or they'll both get away. So I have to knock the body block, and walk away, giving the other survivor time to get more distance or make it to a pallet. Now I have to either chase that person or someone else while letting that other person lie there. With how healing works now, it's super easy to fully heal so basically, it's a lose lose lose situation.
---
Prove thyself
---
Because without it, the chances of getting a 4k are incredibly slim which is the goal of the killer. I am not desperate, but that is really just the best way to go about things. I will try to look around, and if I feel like I cant find them then I will just hook them anyway.
---
h yes, the survivor tantrums continue to make good killers weak instead of improving the diversity by making weak killers at least mediocre.
---
I mean the grouping, not the checkmarks
---
3 are on the left, 1 on the right
---
Neat! I really should watch those movies.
---
Really? Maybe my post was being unfair. I just find it hard to get to rank 1 myself even playing my best. Though it doesn't exclude his toxic gameplay and messages, I find this to be a fair counterpoint.
---
Using something as an advantage to get more kills is not toxic. You are not hurting anyone's feelings by slugging anyone. All it does is tilt a player when you slug,  facecamp, or whatever.
---
Yeah, if you want killers to dodge SWF 24/7.
---
the survivor's version looks worse. Like its get more details and green, but then it suddenly turns red.
---
Why am I represented by a new who looks like a pig?
---
Escaping really shouldn't matter then either then, but survivors are just as insistent to wait killers out. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that, but it is extremely disingenuous to imply the killers should never really go for the goal when survivors do everything in their power to escape.
---
I did make counterpoints. I'll elaborate on then also. DS was not "super nerfed" it was a side grade at worst. The stun now last 5 full seconds since the Enduring nerf. It not working on grabs would have it make much more consistent with other similar "anti-tunnel" perks. There's no reason having both DS and BT should make you completely immune to all forms of interaction. Reducing the timer on downs makes much more sense than removing it on hook since Bubbas would just chainsaw both on unhook and hook the rescuer first just like they did in that patch where BT didn't work if the BT player went down.
---
Fuck! You're right! I haven't seen TGTTM in forever! Was trying to go off memory! I should have watched it before commenting!!!!!
---
Although if someone knows what a baby survivor means maybe they're not actually a baby.
---
I definitely agree why port this if theres literally no info on it anywhere
---
TL:DR: Insta heals weren't that bad as long as there's only one (maybe 2), some killer addons are more problematic
---
I have a theory that for the game to stay healthy, there needs to be "unbalanced" things. If you have a shitty game, followed by another and another you need something that will guarantee the next one isn't as shit. IMO old insta heals were good for this, because they reduced SOME progress for the killer. It's not till there are more than 1 that the game starts to get ruined by them (Like when people would use them all before the nerf). For killer, some of the alternatives are actually more of a problem rn. Things like Iridescent head, Prayer beads, and old omega blink nurse are examples. Things that while counterable, aren't fun to play against. If a survivor goes from dying to health right infront of me, it riled me up and gave me more energy to kill the guy with the med kit, but playing against 3 insta down hatchets just made me want to dc on hook. 
---
I did like Ds suggestions from other comments tho. Perhaps removing the timer and adding a condition saying "If you are downed before a different survivor is hooked". Let's be honest, you shouldn't be ds'd by 3 different people in the space of a minute
---
I don't typically wait out the whole timer. I look around for like half of the timer and if I can't find them I just hook. I don't necessarily slug all the time either, but there are situations where I feel there is a call for it.
---
The point is 60 second of complete invulnerability is too much just to counter "tunneling"
---
I don't think anyone of them is pressured besides maybe Susie
---
Toxicity is completely subjective.
---
I see your points, and agree that in that situation it’s rough. However, good killers (purple/red ranks) don’t seems to run into that problem and don’t come out in the negative side often imo. Speaking as a survivor main and killer rank 7, I’ve been outplayed by killers in the exact situation you’ve described. There’s a bit of luck involved as killer as to whether or not body blocks get pulled off, but again there are killer abilities that compliantly nullify that issue (sprit nurse, bubba, huntress, Michael). Not to mention perks.
---
Easy. Whenever there’s salt just say “mad cause bad” or “baby rage” and you’re set
---
Freddy is my favorite killer, but even he cant preform as well as spirit can (he comes very close !). I think killer use spirit because shes fun, ends chases quickly, and has the best mind gaming out of any killer. Not many killers can hit all 3 of those categories or if they are map reliant. TBH I would love to play wraith, or pig for fun, but when I do i get hit with “gg ez baby killer”. If they would buff low tier killers to the point people are not growing grey hairs trying to protect gens, spirit will remain dominant
---
I feel like once you reach green ranks (about Midway up the tiers) you can't classify as a baby unless you got boosted or got lucky or something myself. But yeah, I feel it is plausible he was actually a baby at purple ranks but it's most likely wasn't the case based on how he acted n such.
---
i think i had a stroke reading this
---
If you like to play the hag you’re just a cunt
---
If you really want a 4k fine but i dont get wasting so much time every game, you hardly get more points for it. 
---
I sometimes just leave, nothing is worth laying there for 4 minutes
---
Absolutely love getting a full stab off in the beginning good job
---
Wooshy ghostboy. Nice costume!!
---
You are the perfect example of a survivor main having no idea how impactful DS is.
---
Exactly. Imagine playing her on console. Now there's even more of a learning curve for console players, who already had it bad.
---
A meme picture of a wall has 600 more upvotes than an actual picture of a wraith cosplay.
---
Yeah, I only had 2 days to work on it. I cut it out of a weird material and I was basically working on it to the moment before I left to go trick or treating
---
&gt;Maybe after the game?
---
After the game would be an awesome feature. I would love to know if I got stomped by a 4 man SWF or 4 godlylike randoms.
---
Yes, the exact same issue.
---
Idkw they havent added that yet
---
Just what I'd expect from a Steven. Hello, Steven.
---
Oink
---
Perhaps think less of it rewarding bad players, and more part of the game that comes into play sometimes. We’ll just have to agree to disagree on wether or not it’s balanced. My suggestion if it really does give you trouble is run a different build or killer to directly counter it.
---
I’ll never understand why gays insist on being slutty. It’s so cringe. Please stop. You make the rest of us look terrible.
---
Obviously Hex:punish DC
---
Lol sadly no. Nobody could see me so that’s probably why
---
With dedicated servers survivors get to keep their bullshit hits AND killer grabs/tombstone/stalk/chainsaw gets rolled back constantly.
---
For killer missing one of these can mean the whole game is a loss.
---
Even though I don’t play legion, this must be really hard. Like hitting a rail gun doctor with green electrode. Good work!
---
Jesus christ nea what happened
---
I don't insist on being slutty, I'm slutty by default, not your problem.
---
Twunk trapper? I can dig It
---
Uh, if you're speaking from the Obsession standpoint, DS got a hard nerf. I would probably agree that the Enduring not applying is dumb, because it also doesn't make sense from a consistency standpoint. 
---
I already explained my problem with it not working on grabs. The killer is picking you up. I view it as a clever way to make the killer make a choice. Leave you, or take the ds. It even gives mindgame potential to people without DS. It also isn't consistent from a gameplay standpoint. To say nothing of BT(BT + decisive is evil, but what do), but I'm not opposed to more anti-tunnel incentive when so many bad killers still do this shit even at red ranks. It's a way for killers to artificially inflate their rank without being good, by camping/tunneling an area/person.
---
So while I understand that it is very frustrating sometimes, I think it makes sense from a balance standpoint. Just like we killers need strong perks(Whispers, SF, BBQ) and killers (Spirit, Nurse, Billy, Ghostface), survivors do need some reasonably strong perks too, despite games generally being survivor-sided as you climb.

Yeah kinda. I had to learn how to use a sewing machine yesterday lol
---
“Entity, I’m trying to grab the survivors off the gens, but I’m dummy thicc and the clap of my booty cheeks keeps making them run away and loop me.”
---
That's not true. Killers like plague need the 4k to even pip. If the piping system wasn't broken it wouldn't be necessary.
---
Yeah the menu can be extremely laggy. I didn’t notice too much of a difference in game though.
---
Oh I like this idea!
---
People play plague? 🤔🤔🤔
---
Yup you got big energy
---
I really wished they had done that. On the other hand I enjoy the fact that Ash is the only one talking
---
Yes and why should that matter?
---
Omegalul
---
I wanted to make a splatoon cosplays but it came out bad
---
I dunno like...I'm still relatively new to this game I've only been playing for a couple months(I'm high red rank rn though for what it's worth), but I feel like I'm able to offer new perspective at least because a lot of people have played a long time and might be locked in to a mindset or jaded. I played games competitively growing up and kind of have that mindset around things, and this game seems like it was doomed from the start in terms of balance.
---
1. There's only two main objectives for a survivor from an individual standpoint that have perks based around them when it comes to "winning"(surviving). Support perks are nice, but that's an unknown for their effectiveness going into a game.
---
- Surviving(obviously)
---
- Doing gens
---
Everything else is moot, and doing gens is such a simple task that every perk at the highest level is devoted to personal survival. Some people take support perks, but if your teammates are potatoes than there's really no point to them and you've wasted a slot. Personal survival is a guaranteed safe bet every game. Exhaustion perks, decisive strike, spine chill, perks that help you evade the killer or prevent things like tunneling, are all the most effective because they all help you the most at accomplishing the goal of staying alive and are effective *every game*.
---
But how many survivor perks are there? And how many are "good"? We're looking at like 10% of perks even being usable here.
---
2. The difference between having voice comms in this game and not having voice comms is extraordinary, even more so than games famous for communication. I played CS 1.6 and CSGO *very* competitively, and in random games due to the lack of information available, voice comms are even more important in DBD imo.
---
The devs needed to make a choice, and they can still technically make that choice. Either don't allow SWF, or give voice comms, like a radio or some shit to people. If they care about balance then you really can't have it both ways, it's literally impossible.
---
3. Killer perks give *so* much more information than survivor perks, and this is probably due to SWF balance.
---
There's just so many perks that let the killer know *exactly* where survivors are, and combos of these things are so extremely effective that if you're not SWF 3-4 stack, than you have pressure on you the entire game and basically can't turn it around.
---
Look at BBQ for example. There's no downsides to that perk. You hook someone, you instantly know if someone is in a locker due to BBQ(which is a form of pressure and prevents progression), or they are within whatever meters in which case they are not going to be progressing gens for a while.
---
Many killers when they see only 2 survivors or even 1 survivor, will patrol the area for quite some time looking for the survivor or trying to bait them into a hook dive. This is lack of progression the entire time if you are within that area. Pair that with shit with some of the other information perks and you know immediately what the situation is.
---
And yes, in SWF this might be balanced and a good way to approach it, but when you're with one other person or you're solo it is *super* fucking powerful.
---
You can technically account for certain perks ahead of time, occasionally I do it, but it's honestly better to wait and see for most perks and adjust accordingly because you're on a short time limit before the killer snowballs. But when it's not SWF, *everyone* has to find this out on an individual basis and that makes the perk literally 2-4x as powerful.
---
So again, let's take BBQ as an example, let's say I stick a gen on hook to test if he has BBQ. He runs right towards me. Okay now I know he has BBQ and I'll get in a locker or close on hook for now on...but *everyone else* has to learn that on my team since it's not SWF, so that's 2-3 more free chases/downs for a killer throughout the game. That's so significant in terms of how powerful the perk can be.
---
And this applies to most killer perks that aren't something global like Ruin, everyone has to learn it on an individual basis instead of through voice comms.
---
How can a game be balanced this way? It's impossible. And wow this turned into a huge rant.
---
Your friend is stupid
---
This is why I’m in the car Jake I’m sick of your crap
---
Have you heard of collision kid?
---
I’d actually use the fuming mix tape with that change
---
Lmao, I play way more killer than surv, and I'm red ranks on both. I know exactly what DS  can do, which is why I think it's in a much better spot now than before. I'm not a salty baby killer who tunnels survivors to win and artificially inflate my rank. All killers have been screwed by DS before. The difference between me and worse killers is that I don't want to Nerf a perk completely into the ground just because of the 1/5 or 6 times someone uses it effectively.
---
When you coop a generator you each repair at 90% speed. With prove theyself it's 100%. Equally as fast as two survivors repairing seperate generators.
---
I'm not sure what timezone you're in but yesterday the killer times were near instant later in the evening. Gotta wait for the 9-5ers/school folks
---
Angy
---
It's not whining. It's trying to make the game fair on both sides in one of its biggest aspects. I'm trying to make a point that this (and many other aspects I haven't mentioned) is unfair and I would like it to change. Nurse was a free character but was the best killer in the game for a  long long time. Now go shove that bullshit excuse of yours up your ass. - Love, Shenlong1904
---
Subtlety? What’s that?
---
No. They've specifically said they try to avoid punishing for farming. The only way to really get in trouble in that regard is if one survivor helps the killer farm all the others (against their will) in exchange for survival. And in that scenario the only one that gets in trouble is the survivor (killer is just taking advantage of an opportunity)
---
Nah. 17
---
I see why you put Nea there lol. Killer and survivor! lmao
---
&gt; Their grunts of pain are 50% louder.
---
Patch notes 3.3.7:
---
&gt; Known bug: we have identified an issue with Stab Wounds Study that makes grunts of pain 50x louder. And also makes people in other games DC.
---
And so it grows
---
I've also had many times where I WAS mashing like an absolute mad-lad but died anyway for seemingly no reason as if an input got dropped.
---
It's not even like the torture sequences in Metal Gear where you're given quite a bit of leeway when mashing, pretty much a single miss or late-press results in death and removal from the match.
---
I'd rather have skillchecks every few seconds (Missing results in losing a chunk of your bleedout bar, maybe a great can give you an extra second?) or auto-struggle with hold to let go, etc.
---
You are right man, I was expecting people to say it is just salt, and people did say that at first, but now all the survivors are claiming it is sweaty, unfun, and worth of a DC. The entitled survivor meme is 100% true.
---
Only solution I se is to not care about rank and just have fun.
---
I LITERALLY THOUGHT THE SAME THING ABOUT BOTANY.
---
yeah sure bro blame that
---
I've never experienced this as a killer main since the servers came out, but I'm not dismissing you. It's entirely believable. They are a mess.
---
The most I've had personally is a weird stutter while breaking a pallet. Sorry you have to deal with that.
---
Yea, I took the picture with a house knife and just held it tne way the grooves in the handle feel comfortable. Only just realised :/
---
To be fair, the one I'd taken my brothers trick or treating with (a pretty standard cheap plastic Halloween knife) I'd held the right way around.
---
If you don't struggle, he will gently place you into that puddle behind him and allow you to wiggle away to freedom.
---
you don't play without ruin do you lol
---
I usually don't get along with young people but we'll see
---
I run Iron Will 3 every game too? That still doesn't change the results of the test I conducted with my friend. I love running the perk, but with a lot of Spirits liking to run Stridor, it completely negates Iron Will.
---
Alright!
---
His regular clothes and a easy drawn mask out of a piece of paper I assume? Cute 👍
---
This thread is really good evidence on why they deserve being called that. I have never heard of killers dcing being justified or survivors being called sweaty and tryhard for trying to do their objective. The entitlement survivors have are really through the roof.
---
you realize you could've just said it and it wouldve been fine and not spam links
---
i wonder how these fan-made lores begin. nea is the entity and myers is a hawtie
---
I did worse SFMs...
---
Kakashi is that you
---
I'ma be honest too. 99% of the time this happens to me it's Freddy or pig or legit anyone with a small weapon.
---
*laughs in trapper*
---
Dailies are borked in general. There are a number of survivor dailies that, upon finishing, are replaced immediately by a killer daily as if it had always been there. Not saying Nurse isn't particularly broken, but dailies in general are to be avoided at the moment.
---
It's fucking crazy how everyone in here are calling killers sweaty try-hards for wanting all 4 kills. I doubt they would say the same about the survivor team trying to get every person out. These same people screech when anyone mentions the Survivor Rulebook
---
Aye I give you props for wielding a real knife in the photo lol. Idk I just love real ness over plastic. I’m hoping to get all the Slasher weapons I love one day. I have a metalworked Freddy Krueger glove I am entirely happy about lol.
---
god I just imagined the doctors laughing sound when he zaps u when I saw this meme :(
---
prove thyself is just reversing the debuff effect, but with the right stuff it can be used to zoom through gens pretty easily
---
The only time you should mess up as spirit is if you get mindgame’d by BHVR’s scratch marks
---
Last night during my play session, there were no less than 10 Trapper games with very little variety in between.  My SWF and I were getting pretty annoyed because it's boring to play against the same killer every match.  Wonder if they felt that same way.
---
How dare you mock handsome squidward merged with simba?
---
Very true. A lot of my opinions changed when i started playing killer. Now I dont get mad at the killer for doing well i yell at my team for being potatoes.
---
ME ANGER! ME GET NO POINT. THAT WILL SHOW THEM(I don’t dc either just imagine this is how they think)
---
I mean they changed freddy recently

this is my kink
---
Laurie looks like she’s possessed by Rin
---
Um I like it because now 3 people can’t spawn in and that fucks all the survivors over. 
---
So think of it that way, it’s more of a positive then a negative you just got super unlucky.
---
I still have that problem with supers :(
---
There are a lot of problems both sides are dealing with abd BHVR is just soooooo slow with reacting.
---
I'm not trying to belittle your personal experience. Whatever you've seen in game is as valid as what I've seen. Up until now I was basing the arguments on what you said earlier about what you'd seen other people admitting to. If you've seen DCs more often than I have, then it's relevant to the discussion. These things probably vary based on a number of factors including rank, platform, and region.  
---
Anecdotal evidence is usually frowned upon because it represents individual one off experiences, and aren't representative of the population as a whole. Evidence isn't weak because it's 'anecdotal,' as being from one person, but rather because it has a sample size of 1, and is subject to reporting bias. Of course there can also be inaccuracy in reporting if the individual isn't properly recording data, which admittedly could be the case. I don't exactly have a spread sheet keeping track of every DC. These are just my estimates based on my experience. In this case my experience could be called anecdotal, but it's doesn't share all the same weaknesses that anecdotal evidence usually comes with, since it's based on the average of many experiences, rather than a single one. While I think information taken from individual forum posts is weak, I acknowledge that your personal experience in game has a much value as mine as far as evidence goes.  
---
I haven't tried to be dishonest with you. Sometimes it's difficult to reach an understanding over text, and perhaps I've come across as more combative than I intended to. The reason I press peoples arguments is because I am legitimately trying to gather more information to improve my understanding. If I post my opinion online I can gauge it's validity based on the responses of other people, especially if I can get not only their upvote/downvote, but also their reasoning, and any information or experiences they can share.
---
aren't you missing a finger or sth ??
---
I think ghostface's knife would be cool to have. One 9f the things I like about Michael though is that he doesn't have a weapon per say, he just picks up whatever sharp knife he can find.
---
Noed crutch :D
---
NO JOKE I LITERALLY MADE MY FRIENDS HATE BOTANY BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS USELESS TO FIND A CAMPFIRE AND HEAL THERE
---
I was just kidding sorry for being gross
---
Yeah but I like going for authenticity. So I’d find the exact same fucking knife they’ve used lol. 
---
Michael has a big kitchen knife and I need to find the same copy (don’t do this it’s not all 100% worth it). 
---
Leatherface I’m just going to get a real chainsaw. 
---
Pinhead well I have to buy chains and attach hooks to the end.... I have to be careful with those so I don’t cut myself lol.
---
Its the timewasting thats the issue for me, its boring to sit on the floor for 4 minutes cause the killer is so desperate for a few points or an ego boost. 
---
If killers do it whatever but its an eyeroll every time
---
Here are the screenshots of the messages I had with the bad salty teammate and the killer https://imgur.com/gallery/LPgq6RS
---
It's ironic, theres a link to read more on the post about the event; but you can't open it on console.
---
Why not replace remember me with bitter murmurs for the vision at the end
---
Imagine just a bunch of batteries around the map and you need a bunch to power the gates
---
I think alot of Killers just don't want to be seen as campers, but it's silly because it gives survs space to do gens fast.
---
I just know that if I do sit near the hook and If survivors are actually smart, they will just do gens uninterrupted.
---
Nea plays both sides cuz she is the Entity and a Survivor at the same time. Imma head out
---
I love this. Did the killer let you escape?
---
Might be right about that, I can't prove anything beyond the clip
---
Lmfao thought this was a joke challenge
---
This is true I am the afk killer
---
&gt;It’s probably dedicated servers but you’d think they’d play test the game a little more
---
If you watch the dev streams or at least read comments regarding devs announcements, you'd known that servers are still being tested and tweaked. They decided to test on live servers because PTB never really gives them "normal gameplay" feedback.
---
Spirit: use unpredictability to your advantage to stir up survivors and keep them injured and moving. You have the advantage of using the spirit plane to change locations (mostly) in secret, so try as much to conceal the intention of where you're going. You can get a lot of free hits when you spot survivors hiding when they think you're occupied chasing someone else; leave a husk behind to occupy survivor #1 while you go ambush survivor #2
---
As a joke
---
Yeah, it was shitty of me. But it’s something I’ve seen online a lot lately, and frankly I’m tired of it. The shit these dudes pull has a backlash on all of us. This guy’s perception of gay people could very well be decided by the perv making unwanted disgusting advances on him. But whatever. 
---
I’d rather have another gay guy be “homophobic” to me than have someone make sexual advances on me without my consent. Also, it’s pretty common knowledge that a lot of gay people are slutty as hell. Be slutty. Just don’t make advances on a dude who’s clearly taken and most likely straight. It’s gross.
---
I misread this as DND and still made sense 🤷‍♀️
---
This puts a smile on my face
---
I'm gonna take this opportunity to complain about my own thing. I have had two matches now where I was the only one to burn a petal and both instances the map was Temple of Purgation and both times both event hooks were in the bottom of the temple and I was unable to use either of them
---
Thx
---
Thats what i do as a killer. If i just see no gens being done and hes abandoning a teammate, i just decide that hes the one not leaving. Also of course it was a nea.
---
Before you kill me just know theres a claudette in the Bush by basement
---
I'm down.
---
Yes, you can.
---
It's not "desperate" or an "ego boost." It's just playing the fucking game.
---
Nice :D
---
Nurse and Spirit already sucked. Incredibly boring and unrewarding.
---
It is and they wouldn’t. Not without maybe getting slapped or punched.
---
Did dwight say that
---
Yes he did actually he was happy to let me go
---
I have gotten games where 2 people went for a save and I hooked them both and still got hit with ds
---
It puts a smile on all of our faces
---
Yep, started yesterday too
---
Plaster strips and newspaper over a basic mask to form the shape
---
This is great
---
Still holding on to my eternal hope for Pinhead.
---
Oh cool
---
Wait a second, doesn't that addon give you all three of the perks to use? If so, you'd be using all 3 perks on a level 1 Pig. That's actually genius.
---
The Switch port sucks ass to be sure. 
---
I have probably 1000 hours on PC so I know all the maps, good spots, etc and I find that it REALLY helps me on this lag ass Switch version. 
---
Two big problems I have: 
---
**Game runs like ASS in docked mode**, like 15 FPS it seems at times..... made me miss skill checks before. I imagine the resolution in docked mode is higher but the extra performance from docked mode isnt enough to make up for it. 
---
Hitting great skill checks (Hex: Ruin) is nearly impossible, especially ones that show earlier on the circle. 
---
Hex Ruin really seems broke, I can imagine some other perks like "Overcharge" that make you complete a really hard skill check would be massively OP as well.
---
You load into blood lodge and see all the pallets, and your like "oh yeah." Then after five minutes of looping the Clown you finally run out. You look to the bottom left of your screen ... 5 gens left. You get hooked and look around for the other survivors auras. One guy's in a locker, the other guy's practicing his moonwalking, and the third guy heard the heartbeat once 5 minutes ago and is still looping himself on a jungle gym.  
---
You may have heard of this scenario by its other name, "solo queue."
---
Sorry about that then
---
There is no better feeling in all of DBD then getting DS'd and having them immediately running into a trap.
---
Don't wanna get hit with BT and DS. Don't tunnel and camp :) Simple
---
BHVR has never said Decisives scope of use is locked to countering tunneling.
---
Imagine using ace in the hole only to be surprised by basement bubba
---
I played a trapper game last night on Haddon field where my Ruin got fkked within 3m and I had 0 kills by the time all gens were powered (bc I did not tunnel). The last guy I hooked got saved, downed again, then I chased the rest out. 
---
Instead of waiting accurately for 60 second for potential DS to wear off, I slugged a bit (while chasing the rest out), picked him up, got DSed and everyone escaped. Post-game chat I got called a shitty killer bc I attempted to wait out the DS. 
---
Bro I took turns hooking yall Mary go around style on a shit map for killer (bc I figure it’s Halloween) and got 0 kills. Could a man not try to get one pity kill while y’all had all the fun?
---
With Rancor, I already have an idea where everyone is. Not as detailed as the information auras give me, but info throughout the whole map (instead of 16 meters from a gen) and a free mori on the obsession is worth it in my opinion. Rancor with Remember Me also synergizes well as you’d want to kill the obsession asap so they don’t open the exit gates at regular speed
---
&gt;buff legion 
---
&gt;give some love
---
There is a special place in hell for your kind.
---
Whats a friend
---
Behavior has never said decisive strike is meant to be an anti tunnel perk.
---
Give me a few hours
---
I’ll catch the hatchet and throw it right back at your ass
---
I had a whole post typed out and went to reread your post to make sure i didnt miss anything and saw 
---
&gt; survivors running fucking boiled over so you can't get to your fucking hook as killer.
---
This is a joke post right? I almost got baited.
---
Might get high latter is what that costume makes me think lol.
---
Alrighty. Sorry if I came off as rude btw, I just tend to be brutal with my approaches or vague.
---
Survivors have just as many viable perks, it's just their inability to play at high levels without a crutch that gives the impression that there are less.
---
Your two posts are a perfect demonstration of projection. Telling the OP how he thinks and feels about the situation, when it turns out that it is YOU that has the problem after all.
---
Fix Legion first then his add ons
---
Same thing happened to me, twice. They said that they would restore it around 24hrs ago.
---
I downed the Dwight before the exit gates were powered, and I carried him all the way from main building to the exit gate (He didn’t wiggle). They didn’t even know I had NOED until I hit the injured dude, or saw the totem next to Dwight’s hook.
---
[Me playing doctor for the first time, barely getting one kill](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rj-1egNPnaY/hqdefault.jpg)
---
Salty SWF is salty. Not everyone is that way my dude. Just sucks there’s no way around it. Props for playing with honor
---
Gen rush isn't a survivor fault but a broken game mechanic..
---
Are you ok?
---
Loops for days
---
That’s what I said
---
as the other guy said, yeah, it's random as long it's unlocked (remember to level rag up to 40 to get her perks!)
---
since stranger things dlc came out the bloodweb has recieved a mini-rework, and now starting at 40(or around that) there should be 3 perks per web (you can pick up 2 at a time), and at lv 50 4 perks per web, so the chances to unlock the perks you want increase by a lot
---
If no one burns a event offering find the one event gen that spawns in and camp it. Gets lots of salt . . .
---
*bing bong you opinion is wrong*
---
Legion should see blood again and hitting a survivor with a feral frenzy hit when they already have deep wounds should apply mangled and hemorrhage change my mind.
---
Big Brain
---
Not sure I will find out
---
IMO, Freddy was an awesome change. The only problem with his kit is that it's bloated, but overall I think he's at an awesome place balance wise.
---
You can slug them, but then you've wasted time because now 3 others have free time to either work on gens or heal or whatever else. That isn't punishing anyone. It's wasting time. Also with how fast people heal it's almost pointless to slug in general. Higher ranks, you'll slug, turn around chase someone for 10 seconds, and then the on your slugged is now up and fully healed and running to finish a generator. That isn't punishment. There are plenty of examples out there where you can point to how DS is BS overall. Does it prevent people from climbing? Nope. But this game isn't skill based. The game is perk and build based 90% of the time. 
---
And getting hit with NOED is always funny because it literally means, "I don't want to be bothered with taking out totem and so I rage for it." You know how long totems last in higher ranks? They seem to go down in about 30 seconds more often than not. I'm way more worried about stuff like ruin than I am NOED, because the longer a game takes to finish the more likely a killer will win out in the end.
---
And learn to respect perks isn't good. People should be critical of them so that the devs know there's potentially a problem.
---
Yes i do play on PS4 &amp; PC.
---
It's not hard to hold on to DS against a non-tunneling killer, though, and that's when it's problematic. Ignoring the mess that is adrenaline and borrowed time in a group, let's say you manage to catch a survivor and hook them at the end. Their teammates come and coordinate a save where the best you can get is a trade, so you trade 1 for 1 eventually secure a kill. Sure, that can ideally work in some good conditions. That doesn't change that you could easily get more kills if it wasn't for DS at the end game. So many times I've seen situations where survivors are free to crawl out of the exit gate and the killer can't do a damn thing about it because they'll eat up a good knife to the back if they try to pick them up. That's not exactly tunneling. Multiple times I've seen, being on both sides of it, a whole team with DS active at the same time in end game.
---
I think it's a great perk when it serves its intended purpose, but when as killer you go and down/hook the person who saved or someone else (not even in endgame in this case), then happen to find the person who got saved (either by chance or because they wanted you to find them since they don't get punished until their DS is out), and you can't really do anything to them even if you catch them. That's not exactly tunneling.
---
It's been posted like 100 times but ok
---
They have to fix the secrets. If its really a secret then not show it at all or everyone thinks its a mori
---
Yeah honestly when I'm playing to win (hag with optimal perks and no offering) the only thing that worries me is swf on comms. Even then I can ramp things up with the camping and tunneling if I really need to, and I could always bring in moris.
---
Meanwhile half the survivor games are basically unplayable since I solo queue.
---
I typically don't play enough to hit rank 1 in a month (those fucking wait times) so maybe there is going to be some drastic jump in difficulty going the last four ranks from where I usually get to, but I kind of doubt it.
---
Unfortunately pc have long killer queue times and have been this way for a while, but since you are rank 15 I recommend you try to get around rank 10 that the queues should be very slightly better.
---
How dare the survivors and killers try to win!

Just use a Makro, it isnt banable.
---
It’s all good, you just getting your word in. I don’t get why both killer or survivor would be extra sweaty in a game like this. In truth we all chillin
---
I'm with you except I cleanse when the exit gates are powered usually not always
---
The range would have to be real small or DS would break Hawkins Lab.
---
Claudette's is just about how she spent her 8th birthday hiding in a bush anyway
---
I don't mind the Trapper setting traps but I would have to constantly hear him setting traps while I'm sitting in a lobby (not as the Trapper) - yeah, it would be kinda annoying.
---
Why u bully claudette
---
That would be because it’s on for 40/50/60 seconds...
---
Been twice today where a ruin totem has looked like a dull. Once where I cleansed it for inner strength and once where a team mate cleansed it next to a gen I was on. You just have to laugh at how many bugs are in this game.
---
Ya I get it. They coulda been all solos or maybe 1-2 stacks. But games like this reminds me why I usually try to make it a 1-3 if I have 1-2 gems left so I stand a better chance. Gonna be a strong believer :)
---
Me as survivor: where are all the fucking pallets?
---
Me as killer: why so many fucking pallets?
---
Right but if they’re downed they can’t be picked up or they get a free escape. But if you don’t hit them they get a free escape as well.
---
For how much money from this bhvr will get, they could do more charms than just recolor and put them on the paid track
---
Omfg....I realize the beginning chunk of the post is missing. Lol I had people telling me these things as both killer and survivor (I've been playing a lot of both).
---
I feel like no matter what I do I'm being called a "try hard" in dbd

No problem, son.

Writing is mediocre + voiceover is horrible, I turn it off. Still want to hear more though.

I personally dislike killers who farm so I would rather die and get my points then stay.
---
Legion can't see blood during Feral Frenzy
---
Also me as both: "ok they're obviously speed hacking, I'm never that fast as killer/survivor"
---
Good on ya. Don't understand why some killers just stand there and look at them, especially fast killers.
---
This has nothing to do with the event, happens in normal games aswell.
---
That was the point. You didn't make an argument. Hatch &amp; keys encourage letting teammates die/DC = unhealthy
---
Dang it Jake my opinion of you is a rollercoaster of emotions here
---
I don’t think you know what a mindgame is.  It isn’t about making a read, it’s about making a prediction.  It’s like in a fighting game.  Reactable moves are not mind games; predictable ones are.

Excellus was a guy?

I'm already gone I had sprint burst
---
Yey
---
nah lol i'm not petty like that
---
horrifying, thanks
---
Yes. In real life when you get stab by an edgy young man with mask and a knife, you're really bad. If you're getting hit two Times in a row, you're probably going to die. But in DBD, it's not really the case. It's dumb that actually hitting a dude two times with a damn knife does nothing. At least give them a status effect for that. Because this illogical interaction doesn't work in your favor.. :(
---
This was on a high level of gratification, thank you for sharing Megan
---
So you cheated instead of just moving on with the game, seems like the the shit teammate was you
---
I am the toxiest!
---
*You are put in.
---
Welp, you won't by the levels otherwise
---
...the greed..
---
Oh, for sure. It's a game of momentum, where if you don't get some snowballing going early, things will go badly for you later on. But that doesn't really change that your comeback potential in endgame, regardless of the number of people alive, is severely limited by people running DS. Then there's adrenaline in groups and that's a whole other can of worms.
---
I know you can *probably* guarantee one kill if you try hard enough, but I feel like you shouldn't be punished as a killer for punishing survivor mistakes in endgame, making it so you get less kills than you technically earned. At rank 1 this stuff is brutal, and it's *very* hard to play as "fair" as possible without having 4 alive late in the game.
---
On console
---
Gg on the completely undeserved win
---
Yeah that's true but I was really hoping to play...but I'll try tomorrow
---
On console :(
---
Oh my god! That’s was my costume for contest at work. I don’t think I won
---
Along the same lines, there are killer perks that SHINE at endgame. Noed and Blood warden being the best imo. Can turn a easy 4 man escape for some over altruistic SWFs into 4ks.
---
The thing about Thano is that it's effect is pretty weak but, it affects multiple things. For the Plague though, it is only a gen regression perk. If you need a perk to slow gens then there are better options.
---
It means survivors are too altruistic. I can hook someone, go away, check a gen and most of the time the person will be saved after 3 seconds from now on, so I just start walking towards the hook early and it works rediculously well. I always down the saved guy first if possible to not give survivors a safe rescue and punish them, and then either hook if I think that they don’t have decisive or leave them slug, after that I go after the savior if it’s possible to track them.
---
&gt;I have been playing, like a lot, way more than usual. But I only have 12 vials and it takes 30 for one item. Last year I grinded enough vials for the max amount of free cosmetics quite easily. But holy shit it is taking wayyyy more time this year. Anyone else think the free track is a little too slow? I think the challenges should give more rift fragments.
---
lol, you still have challenges available and think the rift is slow? Wait until you are done with Tome I. The Rift will barely move. 
---
With that being said, you have 70 days total to grind for the serum, you don't need to unlock everything in a single sit.

---
elo? not familiar with this abbreviation but there are far more gf in red ranks than huntress if thats what you are trying to say.
---
Look the logic I’m given when I say NOED is BS is that because you can cleanse the totems and render noed useless, it’s balanced and needs no changes. 
---
Since it’s clear you agree with me that NOED is problematic here’s the deal, I’ll concede and not argue against a sensible DS nerf provided NOED gets nerfed first since it’s been this way far longer.
---
Darn, I've been caught abusing this absurd infinite loop.
---
People do that, it’s called dodging lobbies lmao. I was totally behind your original message, it’s shit when a slug dc’s for an easy hatch, but you’re going on like a child. And your edit is absolutely cringeworthy, just because people disagree with you doesn’t mean they’re an eNtiTlEd SurViVoR MaiN. It’s a video game, grow up.
---
I agree that it was against the rules what you did, but I won’t act like I wouldn’t have done the same 😏
---
Definitely, but I don't like running them because I feel kinda scummy with NOED and blood warden is too gimmicky and niche for me. I don't play high tier killers really, so I need all the perks to help me early, and running those 2 perks basically means I'm counting on the game going to the end each time and praying it works out.
---
IDK as survivor seeing your whole team trying to save you when getting camped is way more frustrating than getting geny rushed.
---
Even back when spar parts acted like an actual ultra-rare add on On the occasion a 4swf brought in 4 my reaction was "ok that's hilarious, gg I guess" 
---
I play to enjoy the game and not for rank.
---
Although post game chat is way more toxic to killers.
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
Just rotate the stick you dont have to break the controller.
---
Just play Killer 4Head
---
Never said that and that wasnt my point(s) my point was that 1) on console if they nerf her hard were only gonna have one semi s tier (billy) killer which sucks and that means at high ranks players are only gonna see that one killer. 2)if you buff meh or bad killers ppl would actually play other killers more and it would make a spirit nerf more and practical bc ppl will have other actually good killers to fall back on instead of being forced to play mid tier killers. Imo spirit besides her bullshit addons is not op at all and has counterplay ppl just dont want to learn how to counterplay.
---
Fair enough ae
---
These "bugged devotion level" posts are getting annoying...
---
I searched "The Alchemist" and found nothing related other than the cinematic with 2 comments at the time.
---
Honestly yeah, killer queue times are always bad. Survivor is awful so no suprise really
---
I'm completely fine with that, I don't touch NOED anyway.
---
Natalia always looks so cheerful! I'm beyond happy to main her character :)
---
So, you couldn’t take one for the team? You rather him get the 4K? If I’m on hook and it’s just me and another person, I’m hoping other person found hatch so I can stop struggling.
---
I knowwwww I was hoping to find a burning house to complete the look, unfortunately there weren't any :,(
---
I was actually working for a charity organization for kids last night so I couldn't look too charred up haha! Think of the children lol!
---
I sometimes do with certain builds but is harder, so what?

You lie about being able to win without ruin with bubba at rank 5. As I said, at least I don't lie
---
That's funny, lie to make you look good. That's hilariously sad
---
A STUPID BIG LION
---
This subreddit is not a support forum for the game
---
What here? Why would posting here do anything?
---
&gt; I have never heard of killers dcing being justified or survivors being called sweaty and tryhard for trying to do their objective.
---
Okay you didn't say those EXACT words, but you said that killers never complain about how the survivors play when... they do.
---
If that's the goal then why is talk about the spirit coming up before paid content. Considering the fact she got an unneeded and unnecessary buff shortly after she originally came out. Content such as you literally have no other option but to spend real money to use the character. You can buy spirit with in game currency.
---
That's a big no no. It wouldn't be good for my weak heart to hear The Pig ambush sound out of nowhere and then nothing happening.
---
Nice :)

https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dq8uav/heres_what_level_4_of_the_tome_looks_like/
---
I dont play much but i got spark of madness and that doctor is my favorite
---
What xeactky in their comment caused you to make that weird remark about white knights and being "triggered?" What they said is simply the reason - it takes longer to get the serum because the timeline is like 4 times longer than last year. It makes complete sense
---
Honestly, in doctor's case, reworking the addons and the base power should almost certainly go hand-in-hand. He absolutely needs to have something like moldy electrode built-in, because the base range on shock therapy makes it actually useless. He shouldn't be forced to devote an addon slot to some type of electrode every single game just to be allowed to play.
---
Did you bother reading what I said?
---
Lmao if only
---
Kind of impressed they didn't use the chainsaw. Isn't that pretty much why people camp with Billy?
---
I never said it would. I just wanted to know if people were having the same issues as me.
---
They really can't make hair in this game... Looks like a mop.
---
Personally I’m fine with it, but yeah sometimes controllers break like that. I think you can change it to a button in settings though.
---
not a bad idea, but it would have to be common or brown. this would help killers in a lot of ways. but it would be worthless upon the first or 2nd survivor hit. so it'd be gone in a flash.
---
Freddy thought of the kids alright...
---
It's because last year you only had a couple weeks and this year you have around 8 or 9 to do it
---
He face camped me with the chainsaw until I went into struggle
---
yeah you're complaining about post being removed then asked why support is so bad.
---
Haha top tier killer player. XD
---
So post to their support forum or submit a ticket dont just moan on a subreddit
---
Either way, I think the grace period should inversely scale with remaining gens, down to a very small duration during end game. Assuming that; wait to hit them. If they escape you, either they're better and made full use of their second chance or you hooked too close to the gate (which current version punishes you there too).
---
I agree that adding just baseline what I suggested would be ridiculously strong, which is why I would also want the added stipulation. Already, late game, it can be used to destroy momentum and allow easy escapes where, otherwise, more people would be sacrificed.
---
it’s a compliment lol
---
Stridor should also not counter Iron Will
---
Slugging is when you down someone and just leave them on the floor instead of hooking them. It's mostly frustrating because it takes longer to get back up and lowers the points for the survivor saving you and the killer themself. 
---
Most people are fine with being slugged if the killer leaves you because they saw/heard someone else, and it's actually seen as a generally NICE thing in some cases (like if they've downed you twice in a row), but if you slug someone for basically no reason, it's pretty annoying.
---
Hey, I'm also on ps4, so I'd be down later
---
I mean I kinda get why he was camping. The gen is at 99% and if he had BBQ he could see everyone is close why would he leave? But yeah that DC was unnecessary.
---
im a killer main
---
The lobby is extremely laggy, navigating through the archives is so slow and choppy it gives me a headache. And then this is just icing on the cake.
---
No shit, but buffing others won’t decrease the pick rate of spirit. Y’all have thick skulls.
---
How do you know that 100% though?
---
Did you have eyes on him/her the whole time? Or are you just assuming because every time you saw him/her, he/she wasn’t on a gen?
---
Don’t forget to cut you arm and lags
---
GG EZ baby gen.
---
Only 2 skillchecks? Git Gud noob
---
I didn't know that wanting to know about whether or not people are experiencing the same issues as you in a game was moaning, but ok.
---
[Happy dance](https://tenor.com/zMgC.gif)
---
You are right that people complain about gen rushing, and while I believe most are criticizing the game's design, I admit at least some complain about the survivors being tryhard. So I admit I definitely exaggerated. I typically see those people shut down hard though anyway.
---
Not surprised to see it being a Nea, they seem to predominantly be the toxic survivors
---
Ikr, I was confused because it was still making the sound effects of a lit totem but had the texture of an unlit one
---
The worst part was that I ran past it 2 generators ago and ignored it. Not to mention it was one of the totems in the cornfields which had literally no cover
---
Please, ruin as killer: spawns on other side of the map right next to survivor can't get to it in time even with tooth and it's always ruin first.
---
If it was a purple flashlight, then they deserve what's coming to them.
---
Yeah, killers slugs for the 4K and nea doesn’t want to put herself at risk of dying so she doesn’t rescue. Plenty of times I’ve done that it wasn’t worth me dying when I know we’re both not getting out. It’s not my fault the killer is slugging, and it sucks to be the slug but the blame was on the killer for putting OP in the situation where they had to bled out, not the nea.
---
You've asked me this before, and I sent you the link to where my friend originally bought it. It's in your messages
---
This exactly.
---
Iron maiden went off twice. The first time was when Nea left the locker, which is why OP made a beeline for it.
---
Tbh you can’t really know from the clip but all I’ll say is that for the KILLER to actively acknowledge Nea was afk it was probably pretty bad. Teammates like this are usually afk for most of the game. I’ve had this happen to me once as survivor too when it was two of us left, I even had aftercare and watched the other player camp the hatch for a solid 5-10 mins while I ran the killer. There was one gen left and they chose to give up and hide. Eventually the killer realised what they were doing and went to find them at the hatch and let me go. I don’t think it’s a bad thing to punish players who play that way.
---
oh, its you. sorry, i lost the link. ill look for it again. my bad.
---
Bot jokes &gt; dad jokes XD
---
&gt; dont forget his add ons that basically make the game a hostage situation.
---
OG Freddy could drag the game out way more than New Freddy can. Base-Kit OG Freddy had 50% slow when asleep and up to 75% with addons. NewFred's best addon (Swing Chains) only gives him 12% slow when everybody is asleep.
---
You know you’re meant to be bait?
---
Is this game worth getting into? Is it fun?
---
Why I got downvoted?? Wow this community is really.. something else..
---
To add on to this (but not by much) behavior is a canadian game company so they might not see them as teenaggers (but thats a strech)
---
Laurie looks like the oldest one, besides Bill of course. She has a mom vibe going on.
---
But, it is an argument? If not why were we going back and forth? 
---
To be clear: I believe fun matters more than competition in DBD. For that reason, I dislike the way Moris currently work (Kicking a player from the game early) because they can't play, so they can't have fun. Keys do not work that way, they can only be used towards the end of the game, or the very end of the game after the Killer has closed the hatch: Everyone has gotten a full match at that point, and had their fun. Keys are healthy, Green/Ebony Moris are not. I think that's a good argument.
---
Alright then let’s unpack DS. What’s an acceptable timer do you think? I personally would be fine with a 50 second timer
---
Sounds like you got a low-quality HDMI cable. That, or the cooling fan within your PS4 is either blocked up with dust or breaking. Old consoles tend to do that.  Either way, I’d check on both.
---
Omg wraith is now an engineer
---
If she was afk the whole game I’m on your side. If she just chose to not pick you up and wait for you to bleed out then you’re 100% in the wrong. In most cases the killer is hanging around the slug to bait the fourth player and secure the 4K. In that case I’d want my teammate to leave me and get hatch. It all depends on the scenario.
---
I think everyone agrees that they're stupidly hard that it's not even worth trying
---
and hows that going?
---
No I'm using the one that came with the ps4 it's pretty good quality.
---
hit if you have save the best for last and it's not the obsession, or you suspect a flashlight save/ better chase oportunity
---
grab otherwise, gives you more points and it's faster
---
I can do the same you know?
---
&gt;You should be glad you have over two months then. You are mad for literally no reason
---
What exactly in my comment caused you to make that weird remark about me being "mad?"
---
If you run STBFL and they aren't the obsession hit them for an extra stack. Otherwise, just pick them up
---
Good, I’m on lv 14 since I spent all of it on ace, the archives is a good get blood points as well
---
I always pick them up, unless a second survivor gets trapped nearby, then I may consider slugging the first.
---
Other perks to try are brutal strength, surveillance, and franklin's demise. Those perks work good with most killers.
---
Handsome Squimba
---
... I have never seen anyone use "edgy" to mean anything other than something or someone trying to hard to be dark that it becomes ridiculous  and laughable.
---
There's only so much you can understand without direct experience. I don't comment on balance for Killers like Billy, Hag, and Leatherface because I don't play those Killers. I have my views on those Killers but my views have been proven to be flawed, and I don't make comments on them as a result.
---
Yeah I saw them.. it's dumb
---
But you know.. devs don't play this game so end up making stupid decisions as well
---
As a survivor dedicated servers have definitely been an improvement but as a killer they are a fucking nightmare. I have 30 ping in every match but the trapper thing always happens. I can't play Myers at all because the stalk physically doesn't fucking work somehow even though I can stalk fine on Ghostface.
---
people at the extreme ends of rank generally have pretty horrible queue times. The best queue times are people in green/purple ranks
---
I’m the type to play both sides but I still hate some things killers do (camp and tunnel when there are like 3-5 gens) and I hate survivor heroes, (flashlight and blocking) but there are counters to these things with the right perks
---
Nah it's not the hdmi cable I was using a pretty decent one I think it was the latter all of my consoles are on a display shelf and the ps4 is at the bottom, think I'm gonna have to move it up.
---
reminds me of the Halo 1 end cutscene where Master Chief takes his helmet off to reveal another helmet lmao
---
Ah, the prophecies foretold of such a thing.
---
The elusive rank 21 claudette
---
Oh shit, looks like the time to dip out the game for some folks because it will be NOED every game basically. 
---
Also these requirements really scream farm or Swf lol.
---
Funny how 99% of survivors under 9 run it
---
It’s way worse for survivor for me cause dead hard broke and killers weapons seem to go though walls
---
&gt; What exactly in my comment caused you to make that weird remark about me being "mad?"
---
It's pretty obvious. rainbow-kats gave you a really reasonable and calm response and you acted like they lost their mind. It clearly made you mad for some reason.
---
Nice attempt at a "no u," though. I'm sure you'll nail it next time.
---
Soon enough the survivors would stop taking into account what they hear in the beginning of the game. But it would gove us hope if we hear someone we hate that maybe it's not them.
---
Yeah I don't think anyone has ever called legion "young adults". They've always been referred to as teens because... thats just what they are.
---
This was pretty forced just make a meme tbh.
---
It's annoying to go against but not game breaking so shouldn't be bannable.
---
I mean, the bear traps just requires you to be a little creative/play on Haddonfield, but yeah, the others are ridiculous.
---
They wouldn't be so bad if they weren't something you had to do in one game, though.
---
Well deserved!
---
Most if not all of the Tome IV challenges will be doable if they just remove the "in a single trial" requirement.
---
The t-bagging always gets me in these videos XD
---
What about Sam and Krampus from the holiday horror movies?
---
Putrid Serum is not connected to the event. It is connected to moving through the free path of the Rift
---
&gt; Excellus was a guy?
---
i think so
---
&gt;xp bro. Plus you drop a free bologna bolganone
---
true true, truly a delicious tome
---
What I REALLY want is a mixture of the two
---
(insertlennyfacehere)
---
While I understand your point, how many people actually read?
---
The Destiny devs explicitly put in a mechanic because no one understood their PvPvE gametype, and a lot of people still don't know what to do
---
&gt; Yeah I saw them.. it's dumb
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; But you know.. devs don't play this game so end up making stupid decisions as well
---
McLean is the lead developer and he plays it quite regularly. Not_queen is not a dev but she is constantly giving them feedbacks and she also plays regularly.
---
Bunch of casuals play this game and hate having any sort of a challenge. The harder the challenge the more satisfying it is when you achieve it.
---
I think only the EGC unhook one is particularly difficult. The others are very doable
---
OG MoM had very little if any counterplay against M1 killers. You could run One Punch Freddy (OG Fred with Monitor, Save The Best For Last, Play With Your Food, and Rancor) and mori the obsession after ignoring him all game but that's about it + all four survivors could run it.
---
I agree against high-tier killers MoM did almost nothing but fact a single perk gave you a guaranteed free health state against lower-tier killers (Unless they camp or tunnel and mori) only widened the gap between weaker killers and stronger killers. 
---
Since I suck at Nurse and Spirit (Been practicing though for spirit but still suck, probably because my hearing isn't like it used to be but I imagine with enough practice I'll get a hang of it) I main the rest of the cast and MoM was absolutely brutal when combo'd with Dead Hard, Deliverance, DS, and an instaheal.
---
&gt; Oh shit, looks like the time to dip out the game for some folks because it will be NOED every game basically.
---
As if it weren't already, lol.
---
&gt; everyone
---
I don't. I think only one is really difficult
---
Bust out the basement build! Also the traps aren't as hard as you think, a lot of trapper mains Cath everyone at least once in more skilled matches.  But the saving during ECG is rather stupid
---
Super interesting, but what kind of add-ons are you thinking for this?
---
I have this print on a shirt!!

THE CAT 😍😍😍😍
---
Killers not doing anything wrong by slugging for the 4K, but OP is upset they were slugged and neither killer or nea would pick them up, and I think it’s silly to be placing the blame on nea, who’s not rescuing because it’s a trap, instead of realising that it’s really the killer who’s keeping them hostage because they wanted the 4K.

Best way is to just step into a trap

Not too sure yet. It's a barebones idea. I don't even know where to start with add ons. Maybe ones that slightly increase the time the can mimic, or possibly slightly reduce the cooldown without being too op.
---
Groovy.

Doesn’t matter. The perk still had time left.

Me: *mains survivor*

Yikes, a nurse when all the survivors are broken? OOF

ZzZzzZzz Play kill your friends if you want to mess  around

Most red rank survivors actually have played a fair amount of killer to understand the mechanics
---
Weindgo?
---
I don’t think I’m “better” i have always let my teammates get hatch if I’m on hook, this player didn’t deserve that
---
Keys take the satisfaction of a good game away when there's one person who just abandons the end of the match for the sake of an easy escape. It sucks competitively and it taints the game in retrospect.
---
I think object makes survivors aura yellow (maybe purple) but definitely not red
---
Yeah, something like those. Either way, it's a neat idea!
---
What that guy above was doing is basically trolling, 
---
but yeah I followed the same concept you explained in the clip, only difference was why do it across the window. Well thats where it was big brain thing. I knew he was keeping eue on doors, so any attempt there would have spooked him and he was prepared to jump the gun on window.
---
Going exposed and not seeing me anywhere on gates made him panic and lunge for window (i think he had lithe) to gain distance but thats what I was prepared for.
---
As someone who plays both, survivors are far worse

Fucking brilliant
---
I've always seen legion as a cool killer but was never good with them, so this is a real cool video
---
Chucky would be cool, but Freddy would attract way too many kids
---
?????
---
Thanks! Just thought i'd throw it out there even if I don't know all of the details yet. You never know what someone might pick up on and contribute from a simple planting of a seed.

Always use pig mask to mind game survivors into thinking they face Amanda
---
Devs dont care. Ive done this hundred of times.  Its the killers choice who to spare after all. I only see justice in this video.
---
Clown and trapper are your idea of balanced?
---
Ok lol
---
it makes the survivors aura purple-ish so i dont think so
---
i like how you cant win with anything that isnt an S tier killer that has ruin, so anyone who does it is immediately lying, its not even that hard dude stop malding
---
My dream is for pennywise
---
You can't really understand something you've never tried. Bad meme, 0/10.
---
If SWF didn't act like they were competing for the the cuntiest player in the world, it might be worth playing against them.
---
Am I the only one who thinks it’s too bright?
---
The shading/shadow textures on him make him look so painfully white, both his skin and garb are just too damn bright in most maps
---
Hahahahahaha no. Nice strawman tho
---
Just because you don't understand English apparently, or just won't understand my point, doesn't mean I don't understand that companies are MADE to make money
---
You're just too stupid to understand I'm sorry
---
If you get hit it uninstalls the game
---
I'm assuming no one here understands how the "Broken" status affect works? Lol.
---
Survivors can't be healed while this is active. Although i do feel like there is a bug sometimes that makes it permanent. Not sure if there's any perks or add-ons to make it stick like that.
---
bro do you get stomped at rank 5? have you ever even been to rank 5? i dont even think you've ever been to rank 5 honestly
---
&gt;insanity counter in the bottom corner on The Game map
---
Honey, you got a big storm comin
---
The problem is that if you are higher ran then usual you can’t pick up and learn a new killer because you will get your ass handed to you and that’s not fun

It’s gonna be licensed with all the hints they keep throwing out for pennywise if it was original we wouldn’t know about until the second or 3rd week of November
---
Why are you so mad? Dude just chill, I thought we were trying to have a discussion
---
Yes! I always wanna send a quick message saying "I'm not trolling I swear! It wont let me heal!".
---
*You know I had to locker-juke ‘em*
---
Again.. strawman, dishonest and liar.. I'm done with you
---
See people like you wanna cry about wanting to play a normal game when that’s all we do when these events aren’t running and that we should all go the fuck on.  How about you just accept the fact that there are more of us who wanna go farm and you people can pull the plug and go find another match if you don’t wanna make some extra points.  If kill your friends have put bloodpoints so I can level up some of my survivors and killers during the event we would be there and leave you crybaby’s to your normal games. But we are all in the same boat, so you can play along and get some extra points or pull the pin and check out!
---
&gt;How do I unlock the blue and white nea headpiece, I've seen people on ps4 with it and wondering if I can get it for myself
---
Buy the headcase DLC.
---
So you claim shes too easy to play but have clearly never played her?
---
I mean.. if you had you would know she cany go thru walls lol
---
So sick of people who only play one side acting like they know everything
---
*laughs in sniper doc*
---
Ok dishonest liar, I'm done with you
---
Same thing happens with dead hard. It wont execute but the game shows you activated it.
---
Yeah, a bunch of different errors, including one about timeCreated or something of that sort. Probably some servers are dying
---
I thought of a "Hook yourself to save someone else" perk a long time ago after reading a similar idea of a self-hook perk.
---
You'd do something like bring Deliverance, Dead Hard, DS, and the self-hook perk, have the killer chase you, hit you, dead hard, then jump on the nearest hook to rescue your buddy, yeet off the hook with Deliverance, and you now have Dead Hard and Decisive ready.
---
Its in head case dlc. You get a bunch of cosmetics for like $2
---
Pretty much servers in a nutshell. Worst part is, 70ms or lower.
---
Huh. Guess I was wrong. You didn't nail it at all.
---
I've literally been tunneled  and mori'd all day (5 hours straight) whilst trying to escape as Claudette for the challenge. I finally did it but had to leave Tapp to die so press F for that Tapp too. You will be missed
---
Oh, like exhaustion perks, pallet vacuums, Decisive Strike, Mettle of Man or the hatch?
---
Shut the fuck up.
---
When is it not the right move?
---
i like how you know im right lol
---
Yes exactly! Fuck that’s annoying
---
Thanks for sharing a clip of you escaping by opening the hatch with a key.
---
How dare I want to actually play the game
---
Literally unplayable, when wearing those on a hospital you're supposed to not have underwear
---
Pardon me, coming through
---
Welcome my friend, we are many... also buckle up and get ready for the ride of your life with BhVR Interactive on PS4
---
yeah the perk was garbage for the game but not OP. Just garbage design
---
X doubt
---
That happened to me today, I had a rank 9,5 and a 20. And they got fucked by a Myers in the basement but I escaped with a hatch. The game ended so fast.
---
i've been getting this too
---
&gt;edit: a dev on the steam forums said she's far over performing and will be addressed. so take that assholes
---
Should I bring up freddy? Or doctor? Maybe legion since is more recent and you must be new
---
Same here keep me posted as to when it stops
---
new player here, I just think it's a neat game
---
My friend said he is gonna get me the game this weekend so I can’t wait for the game
---
The problem I see with that change is if the killer is camping you and someone goes down in order to save you but the killer downs both of you before you escape and hooks the guy who saved you before he hooks you. How would you address that scenario?
---
It just started happening to me about 10 mins ago. Can’t find a killer or survivor match.
---
That one survivor challenge is actually the one I think is too hard. The rest are fine and I see no reason why it would change behavior or at all.
---
You will not, ever, get 4 people sacrificed in the basement by camping, even with Insidious Bubba
---
Sometimes it’s actually beneficial to as she has to travel across the map to get corrupt
---
Me too :\  I'm on ps4
---
If you hit them with stbfl you can get a stack otherwise hitting them allows you to pick up the trap before you hook him so you can keep moving instead of tracking back for it.
---
That sounds a lot easier, do you just constantly search new like every ten minutes or just come back every few hours?
---
Yeah then other Freddy might have to be burnt again..
---
You mean like titeraly everthing killer has? Suvivor stuff gets reworked, not nerfed moron! The fucked over the nurse, Morris where nerfed, most killer perks are utter garbage AND counterable, but where is the xounter0lay in adrenaline? In the ds? In lieraly everthing you can use as suvivor, so you have fucking absolutely no fucking clue, so shut the fuck up will ya?
---
Also Pumpkinhead, Maniac Cop, Negan from The Walking Dead, Jason (Maybe in like 3 years), Pinhead, The Predator, Pyramid Head, Mr. X
---
Yep PC
---
Same issue, PS4.
---
Connor is gay
---
Surprisingly yes I got one down in that entire match.
---
There's no counterplay except looking at the ground or at the sky or at a wall.
---
Credit the artist
---
I’ve been struggling with shit like this since the event started. They should of just cancelled the Halloween event because this is just.... wow
---
2x bloodpoints EXTENDDDDDDD
---
bro you're malding stop malding bro why are you so mad bro

Is the broken effect only visible to the person affected by it?

I just browse through "new" while sitting in queue or at work.
---
same here, on Xbox
---
These hatch spawn locations keep getting weirder.
---
I’m on PS4 and having the same issue for about 15 minutes now. “Error reason: timeoutCreated” every time I’m about to get into a lobby.
---
Oh, yikes. Hope it gets fixed soon
---
Yeah.. because people can't use the "search" button or use Google..
---
Can anyone confirm for Switch &amp; PC ?
---
There is also a bug that won't let you heal. Has happened to me a few times. Or rather to my teammates. I rescued a teammate from the hook and tried to heal him. No broken status or anything.
---
Flip-Flop is criminally underrated
---
Then you, sir/madam, are the most skilled player in the game
---
Same issue for me on my xbox
---
Just got home from work and now this shit happens
---
I’m on PS4 and I’m still able to enter a lobby. I just can’t find a match.
---
#metoo
---
Just equip plunderer’s instinct and open them first thing.
---
same one.!
---
Hell yes herobrine
---
I'm very tired and I read that as "I ate her red pants" haha

I only see 2 archenemies. Ricardo and Mikey.

Same I just got back from college and was so excited to be a couch potato all night :(
---
I'm not.. just tired of arguing with a dishonest Chad like you
---
Same on ps4
---
This meme won't die
---
Yup, same here. Funny how we got this second bloodhunt because the first one had server issues.
---
go outside pls
---
Charcharbinx7 - PS4 - trying to get the chest rift challenge, so I just need 3 survivors who won’t open any chests :P been trying for ages
---
Same issue
---
Yh, so annoying.

We just got a full squad

---
Can I ask what Freddy would do?
---
His games don't really give off a good Killer Vibe, since he essentially has no abilities and doesn't really have a backstory to use.
---
Also, if we're going Horror Antagonists from games, or Horror Characters in general, he really needs to get in line behind Isaac Clarke, Leon Kennedy/Jill Valentine, Nemesis, James Sutherland, Pyramid Head, Paxton Fettle/Alma Wade, or the Amnesia/Soma protagonists.
---
your comment mind fucked me because "you're" works there but I've just never seen someone use the contraction there
---
After all the delays and bugs with this event and the rift it would be a decent gesture especially if the servers are gonna be knocked off all evening
---
Yes hello Mr. Killer could you please stay still right in front of me while I blind you? Thanks
---
why is your grammar so bad dude you're bad at DBD and you're bad at speaking english you must be pretty dumb
---
"Catch ya on the Flip-Flop"
---
I'm having the same issue, I'm on PS4.
---
Me and a buddy haven't had any issues so far on xbox
---
That's because no one else can start up the game. whenever this happens a very small fragment of the population is able to get in, and that's it
---
&gt;And because you can yell to your friends to to go do something makes it really un fun the devs made that game with teammates so you have the uncertainty that your safe and you can do a gen (if I find a link to that I’ll edit in) swf makes that go away and it makes perks useless (bond and empathy for and example)
---
So because people do gens the game is unfun for killers? Gotcha.
---
This is what happens when I play spirit for dailies. I hate playing against her and I know 95% of other people do too so I don't subject them to it. I just start farming and don't hook so they know what's going on. Seems like there's always some rando immersed blendy that still runs away or hides every time they even think they hear my terror radius. Then opens the gate as soon as they see I start hooking people and letting their team unhook for bp.
---
Honestly this feels like more of a nerf than a buff.
---
Not in this case another surv was close
---
Have you used Plunderers?  I did mine straight away.  Oh &amp; you could burn an offering for an extra chest.
---
It means the servers are down.
---
&gt;You will not, ever, get 4 people sacrificed in the basement by camping, even with Insidious Bubba
---
Camping or heavy patrolling will be the most common methods used, I bet. It's *possible* but highly unlikely in my opinion that a killer who is trying to get this particular challenge done will play the game fairly, and normally and still get the basement 4k.
---
That’s what I’ve been doing, and sprinting to each of them, but I always need one more that someone has already opened.
---
I'll think of this meme every time I go against this build. At least I'll have a chuckle before I die
---
Image unavailable, but I imagine it's:
---
Connection with host could not be established
---
Well I guess they're extending the event for even longer now.... What can they mess up next?
---
It is the same for me, I’m on PS4
---
The shit part is I need to sleep in 2 hours to get up early for work I’m disappointed:(
---
Kind of off topic question; did Ricardo put his video up on his own or did it get leaked or something?
---
Because I've heard he hates it because his kids might see him dancing in a thong, and my sympathy for the man sways depending on how it got on the internet; if he willingly did it.....
---
Well man, you've got to talk to your kids about being careful about what you put on the internet sometime....
---
I’m just not going to hype myself up for their events anymore. They always end in disappointment...
---
This is happening to me rn as well
---
Oooh that makes sense
---
Full counter
---
I mean tbh, doing nothing for a game and expecting hatch is kinda scummy. I think the killer picked up on that so she teamed with claudette so Nea couldn't gain anything by not playing the game.
---
*squeals in leatherface*
---
Thanks! I almost missed on like 3 of the slashes, just turned hard, slashed, and hoped.  
---
I don't usually play Legion, I just wanted to hit the daily, but it turned out to be a fun match.
---
And probably ya boi John wick...
---
Yes I have, and I’ve used all my chest offerings, unfortunately I think a lot of players are trying to do this challenge now I guess??
---
I'm on Ps4 &amp; same for me.
---
Yeah me too, must be down. Now I'm just wondering how long its been like that today since I'm just now trying to get online.
---
Lol l was super surprised, I was just kinda listening for sound queues.
---
Thanks for letting me know!  Instead of stubbornly rebooting the console over and over again I'll do something else and hopefully it's patched up later :)
---
Legit I think he'd be a neat Survivor choice
---
"Come get me Nurse you asthmatic bitch!"
---
Id love it.
---
LOL "you know you play too much DBD when..."
---
That doesn't seem fair at all...
---
So now we have:
---
Drift Billy
---
InstaSaw Billy
---
And
---
Overcompensating Billy.
---
Hah I want old freddy back too. Mainly because I enjoyed playing the old one since with the right playstyle and build he was a real monster to cocky survivors who often underestimated Freddy.
---
7 seconds to fall asleep, NOTHING to directly help in a chase, and self-care to wake up didn't matter if Freddy constantly disengaged and reengaged survivors (Bypassing the 7 seconds since I'm going after someone else, preventing Self-Care to wake up since I don't hit them right away, etc.) and used the aura reading with a tiny terror radius to ambush them in pallet dead-zones.
---
The issue was on the survivor side the match took forever. Spirit and nurse can bypass pallets, Wraith Pig and Ghostface can sort of try to mindgame pallets with cloak/ambush/crouch. Trapper and Hag can set traps near pallets and vaults. Huntress can use hatchets. Clown has his gas. Doctor can do the zap to try and prevent the pallet drop/vault. 
---
As Freddy my go-to strat was to literally waste everyone's time as much as possible. Since I can't really counterplay a pallet I'd simply eat the wood. Heck I'd often lunge even if I was sure it'll miss just to try and get the survivor to whack me with the pallet so I can break it.
---
If someone was looping me and I didn't feel confident I could catch them I can just disengage! I waste THEIR time more than they wasted mine because they now have to find a generator or self-care to wake up (Which alerts me so I can re-sleep them.) or they find someone who's awake (Which is hard since as Freddy my goal is to have 2+ survivors asleep at all times. I can also see their aura crouching meaning I can go re-sleep them and their woke buddy) during which time I might decide to cut them off or go for another hit. 
---
With that much stall going on, it literally doesn't matter. After I get 40 concussions from pallets dropped on my face with several generators left survivors were screwed. 
---
I think new Freddy's kit is seriously packed with stuff though. I think he's alright but I wish he got an addon that made him work more like OG Freddy with limited aura reading on sleeping survivors, even if the addon removed passive sleep and his teleportation power.
---
For real. Sucks :/
---
Yes - I just started having that issue as well :(
---
Thanks though, maybe later!! :)
---
Kinda glad I'm not the only one with this issue. NOBODY should be havin fun I go can't
---
This NNN is going to be particularly complicated this year.
---
someone has already made this exact post.
---
&gt;but, no, the killer is not going to get a basement 4K by playing scummy. I don't know how much killer you play, but it just won't work, for a lot of reasons)
---
I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.
---
Other than every Nea main. She's the closest thing there is to a survivor-killer hybrid in the game
---
Was it a buddy of yours you could see had no broken status? I've never been able to see a notification telling you a teammate has it or not, curious if I'm just missing something. No one ever seems to be able to tell when I'm broken either when i know for sure it's applied to me lol.
---
Servers are down for me on Xbox.
---
Oh right i forgot the constant spirit and nurses i get at high ranks are playing so everyone can have fun
---
Happening to me and my roommate as well
---
It was ps4
---
&gt;No thy get done too fast look at meta build for killers it’s mostly perks that slow the gen progress to give the killer a chance to down a survivor and not get 2 or possibly 3 gens popped
---
I never use pseudo game slowing perks in exchange for chase or information perks and my games go just fine. I might lose 2 or 3 gens early but then survivors can't get anything done because they are constantly unhooking each other or being chased.
---
People lose 2 gens and think the game is over. Patrolling 5 generators instead of 7 is easier, causing you to trigger chases quicker and you can pick and choose your chases. If someone is leading you towards an area that has zero generators but a bunch of pallets, why would you follow?
---
But does he come from Transexual, Transylvania?
---
Same here on PS4. Also, earlier today I'd always lose my carried item even when escaping.
---
hahaha.
---
Thank goodness... I am so tired. Let me sleep pls
---
Yeah, there’s a megathread on here right now about it, it’s going on for all of us :(
---
They were leaked
---
Same

---
kEYs ArE FiNe
---
I was making good progress on the archives too.
---
again, just because you are right, doesnt mean you need to be a dick
---
No one is able to access them yet as far as I know. Some people are able to *see* them, but no one can actually select or complete them, so there would be no point in making them difficult for protection.
---
If anyone DCs it should auto-give everyone in that match a guaranteed black pip, it’s stupid how much you can get punished because someone else either crashed or is a bad sport.
---
That sacrifice 5 survivors one is fake but for what you can see some of the level 4 challenegs are incredibly difficult. I cant see me completing some of them, itsjust too annoying
---
sacrificing 5 survivors in one trial is not the challenge, it's just 5 survivors. The picture you refer to was fake
---
Same issue, PS4
---
Once a team knows you're camping or hard patrolling a basement, they aren't going back there. They will let whoever is in there die. After that, they will do everything in their power, including intentionally going down elsewhere, to prevent being basemented themselves.
---
That's the main reason why you can't scum your way to a basement 4K. *Maybe* at brown ranks, but past that? Not a chance in hell
---
I’m also having this issue, on PS4.
---
It's gotta be server or wide spread, that really sucks
---
Literally every challenge in the 4th Tome is a single trial challenge.
---
I've had it vary from 30 seconds to 20 minutes like you've said, I'd say average for me at rank 11 is like 2ish minutes but tbh at this point I always alt tab out and watch YouTube or something while I wait
---
&gt;No need to speak with someone "who plays both sites" but apperently dosnt no shit about the game...

Not working on my Xbox too
---
PWYF, Ruin, Furtive Chase, Devour Hope, and two Windstorm add-ons. 
---
Farm PWYF stacks from the obsession to achieve maximum zoom, find someone else and hook them. When they get unhooked the unhooker becomes the obsession. Repeat.
---
Getting it on ps4 here
---
I got it too! Glad I’m not alone in the struggle bus.
---
Fitting that Nea is the one who is both survivor and killer...  
---
Also TRAPPER'S MOUTH WITH HIS MASK PARTED IS NIGHTMARE STUFF
---
Servers are down
---
You cant play a KYF either wow 😢
---
I don't think any of the leaked challenges are too bad at all except the EGC save unhooks
---
I don’t even think excluding PC would be required, the nurse nerf would make her feel less shitty to play against. The only killer that would shake things up for console players is Huntress.
---
It worked now for me (Xbox One)
---
Hey man, thanks for your answer! 2 minutes seems fine, heck, even 5 minutes is okay. But at rank 20 it's just taking sooo long, kind of a bummer, since I actually like playing killer, it's refreshing.
---
Damn it been downloading the update for hours and now that I finally have it game goes down big oof lol
---
It’s back up x1
---
Just got into a game
---
You have a good point but look at it like this you start the game of and you patrol gens you find a survivor and get in a chase there teammate with a map goes finds your ruin while the other two are doing gens you him the guy you were on a chase with and hook him bbq shows you two guys on a two different gens if you go and chase one of them the guy that you hooked gets saved and thy go back on the gen that the guy you are chasing was on and They finish it and the two gens get popped and then repeat after you hook one of them again
---
yes I believe there is another post about this. a mod commented, they are working to resolve it.
---
Same thing here on PS4, I'm able to create killer lobbies just fine though
---
How? the only thing you could consider a nerf was the trap release time, but it is 1.5 seconds per try with a 25% chance, I think consistency would be better than gambling the odds
---
The first survivor furthest to the left is the last one you played with, and the others are randomized

Upvoting this post, hope doesn't take to much time for them to fix
---
PS4 - same thing for me
---
Probably replace monstrous shrine with some gen slowdown perk, corrupt intervention will force them onto gens close to possibly make it easier to get to the basement.
---
Shrine just isn’t a good perk even for basement builds IMO.
---
Removed please look at megathread
---
Everywhere or just Xbox because I can watch people stream the game just fine
---
I just got in a game. What are the best that we get kicked out?
---
&gt;Once a team knows you're camping or hard patrolling a basement, they aren't going back there.
---
Yes, this is ideal but definitely does not always happen. I just had a match an hour or so ago in red ranks where my entire team got rekt in the basement. However, my original comment was saying that it would *encourage* toxic behavior. Sure, camping may not guarantee you a 4k but it doesn't mean that people will not try this method until it inevitably works, or they get bored and switch up their tactics.
---
#MeToo
---
&gt; The challenges are mostly basic
---
People are seriously acting like it's impossible to get a basement 4K or EGC NOED 3K. Ridiculous.
---
Working now
---
Oh I wish I could do this to my teammate that sits in corner
---
I come back to play after a couple of months and this is what I get.
---
Always so awkward... I remember awhile back my queue times for killer were around 20-30 minutes so I would make food or shower and then come back to play a game that was just now starting.  
---
Sometimes though, I would come back to find the game halfway done and I'm surrounded by a bunch of survivors. Most awkward for me was probably back when I used to main Nurse (I'm sorry) and I came back to 4 Claudettes teabagging while surrounding me as if they were doing some kind of weird ritual...
---
I think, why?
---
Get a life pls
---
Or stop being a Chad. That works too
---
Consoles only apparently
---
I've seen this list just continuously grow this week
---
Just got in a game now, after entering the archive menu. Don’t if that’s a coincidence
---
Just enable keyboard and mouse on console then make crossplay input based and that way we can have crossplay across every device minus mobile. Only advantage pc would have is better graphics and frame rate, but then again Xbox one X has an advantage over regular Xbox one because the X is way more powerful so it handles frame rate better.
---
I feel like the subreddit is much better than the actual in-game community members I find.  
---
Haven't been in the sub long but perhaps it's the work of the mods? And the fact that people are here to see content, not just say "gg" then queue for the next game.
---
Correct
---
!!!TRY RESTORING YOUR LICENSES!!!!!
---
Then you might run into a issue, especially with Gen grab Spirit, where you might unphase inside of someone and possibly end up breaking the game-crashes, stuck, etc. might be more or a issue in the long run. I’m all about making prayer beads an ultra rare and giving it a downside, no scratch marks, or half the phase time, something like that.
---
&gt;  just had a match an hour or so ago in red ranks where my entire team got rekt in the basement
---
Because the killer was camping?
---
&gt; was saying that it would encourage toxic behavior.
---
people will always play however they want no matter what. people who don't typically play scummy won't magically do it for one rift challenge
---
That would be awesome I will never play with a swf again fuck that guys
---
Bubba is here!
---
Well there is technically lightborne, but it's a very situational perk.
---
I wasn’t saying that, I was just saying it wasn’t right to say there’s “no point” to buffing low tier killers just because they still won’t be picked as often
---
Because if they try to learn other killer they get there asses handed to them in the most toxic way possible
---
&gt; What do you think?
---
I think this is a troll post
---
I only know who two of those are...
---
but language isnt a race so its not racism, bro you're so smart bro :D
---
Not only does it have free path (which entirely contains the event currency), but it’s also lacks the aspects of other battle passes that could actually be considered as greedy, such as limiting the rate at which you can progress if you’re playing free, (like the special battle pass challenges in fortnite where you had to have the premium version to do them), or making outfits in the battle pass limited time content. 
---
If memory serves, the devs said everything in the pass will be released at a later point (I think six months) so it’s not like if you don’t drop ten bucks right now you’re going to miss out on never seen again content.
---
I know some people are mad about the new change, but honestly I think the devs took the most respectable approach they could and I’m pretty happy for it.
---
No. I've seen it several times on my teammates.
---
It was a random teammate but you can see the broken status just as you can see which teammate is injured in the lpwer left corner of the screen. Along with the injured picture on your teammate there's a red cross that is crossed out in a similar way that a cigarette might be in a no smoking sign.
---
Yea I'd like to see cross play at least between Xbox and PS4
---
Not being able to pick someone up can screw over a killer. If gens get done fast, just having ds equipped can prevent a killer from securing a kill and stopping gen progression a lot more.
---
I think I was able to because I charged it a bit b4 nea saw me she thought she had more time to tease.
---
Feels like a console thing, unless you play on a controller, or you are a low rank survivor/killer and can’t hit hatchets, good huntresses can snipe across the map
---
I still don’t get the economy argument, I just wanna finally level up Doc for Moniter and Abuse teachable :(
---
I haven't been sniped by a Demogorgon halfway across the map yet. Lol
---
Of course it would be required. Red rank killers on PC often play at uncapped 120+ fps. Console is lucky to get a stable 20. There's no way you can match them and maintain competitive fairness.
---
You mean like saving 3 people on the EGC? Yeah, some challenges are just ridiculously difficult for no reason
---
Do you have the shiny coin or tarnished coin offerings? I had the same issue &amp; used shiny coin so that 2 extra chests spawned &amp; managed to get to 3 of them first
---
&gt;Because the killer was camping?
---
It was a mixture between camping and heavily patrolling the area, and survivors who really want that unhook. 
---
&gt;people will always play however they want no matter what. 
---
Yes, they will.
---
&gt; who don't typically play scummy won't magically do it for one rift challenge
---
Not true. For example, I never play unfairly on survivor/killer but if I felt that it was my best chance of getting the challenge done, I would do it.
---
As someone with a One X, not really? Certainly nowhere near the gap you see with top end PCs and consoles.
---
I usually play chill but when you get the perfect snowball towards the end of the match and you're chasing the last one with 2 dead and one on hook and they get away with a key, it's dissatisfying. It doesn't prevent it from being a good game but it doesn't feel like a win. 
---
And enjoying winning an online game isn't a bad thing. If you don't enjoy the fact that it's a competition then people wouldn't play. There's no need to to full reddit armchair therapist on anyone because they like when they win an online game.
---
Nobody does, even economist. Real ones.. because in a close market like this makes literally no sense..
---
I restarted my Xbox and I can get into a match
---
This post is just full of salt lol. And what exactly do you want them to do about swf? Let killers know that's it's a swf? Cause then every killer would just lobby dodge. Completely remove it? Then you'd effectively eliminate half of all people that play Survivor and what kind of online game doesn't allow you to play with friends? People like playing with their friends get over it.
---
Right when I’m making food damn it lol. I’m going to try and grind 1 or two levels today so I’m happy it’s back though
---
How would you call it being discriminatory against a culture, place and language? Tell me, come on I'm waiting (which is still bad as racism btw)
---
They are working on it currently.
---
Iron Maiden went off at 20 seconds. You hear Nea scream.  
---
Believe whatever you want, it doesn't really matter and not worth contemplating over, you only have what OP showed you. I'm just saying usually for a killer to actively choose to spare one person and go for another they're afk.
---
Dont do it you know that things are broken dont be a survivor main
---
it isn’t meant to counter stealth tho, literally makes wraith, GF and pig garbage too. OoO is also getting the same treatment
---
Y’all just running from the real killer, Meg
---
And leatherface
---
call it whatever you want but it's not racism bro
---
That's the only one I think is too hard. But people are complaining about all of them
---
Is it just me or is the face Belle makes with her tongue out fucking weird and disgusting?
---
This is so wholesome omg I love her! It won't happen but imagine if she agreed to do some voice lines like Ash :')
---
Did you mean to type this three times ?
---
Are they really? I hope so. Where did you hear that?
---
No no that I think about it it should not be removed but you said it every killer would lobby Dodge them why because if you play them you wouldn’t have fun even if you kill all of them
---
Foot reveal
---
Ok then it's a Nazis idea. What about that
---
&gt; It was a mixture between camping and heavily patrolling the area, and survivors who really want that unhook. 
---
yeah
---
no
---
massive doubt
---
&gt; Not true. For example, I never play unfairly on survivor/killer but if I felt that it was my best chance of getting the challenge done, I would do it.
---
You should be adept enough with Trapper then to do it without being scummy but oh well if you're not good enough I suppose
---
It’s a different coloured aura to the BBQ aura so unless the killer is colourblind, no.
---
If you're carrying someone and they escape your grasp, DS doesnt activate. Its only after being unhooked. Its hard for me to consider your opinion about a perk if you don't even fully understand how it works. 
---
Sometimes I get tunneled with my DS and loop the killer for a good two minutes on one health state. I get down, no DS to punish the killer for tunneling me. DS clearly needs a buff! 
---
No but really, its not playing like shit to go down to use your DS. If the killer is idiotic enough to pick me up after tunneling me off the hook, or in a very short time after hooking me, the DS is just deserved. 
---
Moaning about DS, even tho the perk is overpowered in only very niche situations (next to the exit gates is a garanteed escape) it is good as is and deserves no change. 
---
Its like people complaining about NOED. How to counter it? Do bones. Do you waste time? Yes. Are you even sure the killer has it? Nope. 
---
How to counter DS? Slug, it makes the survivors waste good time anyways. You dont even waste time doing it.
---
is your F5 key totally worn out PS4 holy shit lol
---
No offense, but that's how it should be.
---
But I was talking about people with an equal amount of time to play. I think people seriously underestimate how much of an advantage SWF players have in just about any situation.
---
“Yea just don’t cleanse” - Every Plague main
---
BHVR: Oh look! A easter egg!
---
Its not the Survivors job to make sure the killer has fun. And vise versa.
---
Trust me, I would like crossplay between all platforms, but I’m still worried about the possible advantages. But I’m sure the devs would take that into account.
---
im pretty sure not liking someones language has been around before the nazis bro
---
Smol boye
---
pussies*
---
I've literally had killers do the SAME and camp our event gens. It goes both ways.
---
Yeah you're right, sadly they're both really bad.
---
You mean my save? Hahaha
---
Wazzup!
---
As someone who upgraded to an Xbox One X after a while I noticed that the same as a lot less choppy framerate in the original Xbox One is what I'm saying. Weirdly enough I get the most frame drops inside the game menus.
---
I agree with you.  I believe that creating a new competitive gamemode where swf is not allowed will balance the game a little.  The casual gamemode would allow swf and killers to gain BP without consquence of losing, and the competitive gamemode would allow killers to play balanced with survivors who are (kinda) forced without comms.  Of course, survivors could always cheat and invite players to VC in a game.  Just an idea that will probably never be used.

ay

You  mean my save? Lol

&gt; Isn't like people do other things than just play but ok BHVR good player base bad yadayada
---
I think that’s the point, as far as grinding events for cosmetics go, we’ve always had to grind the game out over a course of around a week. Sometimes people are busy with other things during that time, maybe you’re on a work trip during that week.
---
Well now, to have ten weeks instead of just one to do some challenges and get your vials. Over all it make take a bit longer, but you have ten times the amount of time to get it.
---
This sucks dude. First they delay it, now they have server issues
---
This, and the guy wearing the bucket, getting chased. Lmao
---
I was about to say. I'm new to the game I joined because of the stranger things event.
---
Do you play solo queue, or strict SWF? This happens all of the time, I'm genuinely surprised you're in such denial over it.
---
Either way, I commented earlier that we should agree to disagree because we're just going to keep going around in circles.
---
Anywho, have a good day!
---
"red offerings" you mean ebony moris? That's not an addon. And yes, I did. It was quite the shitshow.
---
I feel that, got off work 2 hours ago so it’s time for interactive video media and Panda Express lol
---
I got this once but have consistently been able to get into games on PC
---
Did I say that, my apologies, I’ve been drinking
---
Joker would like to know your location
---
Mostly solo queue, occasionally 2 person SWF
---
&gt; This happens all of the time, I'm genuinely surprised you're in such denial over it.
---
it absolutely does not. I'm genuinely surprised you're this dishonest
---
maybe if the nurse wasn’t near optimal lmao
---
Sounds like a good damn time ha good luck on the event. I’m trying to get 1 or two levels a day until the next challenges come up and if my math is correct it will normally take 20 games for 1 rank up
---
That's a engineer wrench from tf2
---
OP did u get the new player outfit from rocket league its exactly the same lol
---
Yeah I agree with you a game mode for that is great but as you said it would never happen
---
I just spam that pulse bow on Hunter.
---
That’d be a hell of a list. It kind of depends on your preference.
---
I'm a purple rank survivor, I don't feel i should be, too many nice/farming killers lol

It’s a prop lol. Why would an American teacher care about that?
---
Yeah, as I said I get a lot of variation though so keep that in mind
---
So you're saying that all killers should switch to spirits and nurses because everyone can then have fun?  Both arguments contradict each other.
---
Yes I am on xbox and cannot get into a match as a killer without getting the timeout error which OP posted. i just tried playing as a survivor and got in no problem though. WTH
---
It is working again.
---
That’s to op let’s be honest
---
They decided to make this intentional. I'm the same rank as u on killer and get same survivors ranks
---
BOOP THE SNOOT
---
"unneeded and unnecessary buff" bruh that buff stopped her from being a meh m1 killer who can't chase as at cause survivors can counter their movements
---
Yea I figured so. Just wasn’t sure if anyone had compiled something like that. I know there are some that are considered better than others all around.
---
Ik im buying clown and then it’s either hag or spirit but I don’t like spirit
---
Myers toes Myers toes
---
&gt; would expect them to play as a team
---
DBD is a team game as long as working as a team benefits the player(s) involved.
---
Your *(bannable)* actions are in no way justified. As far as i know, Nea didn't break any actual game rules while you and the killer did.
---
Thanks for sharing! Hopefully we get an update soon!

It’s all working now!:)

Because its a useless comment. No one cares about the upvotes.

ig sarcasm is hard to detect in text, even when its super obvious

Np took an age to scroll tho
---
A lot of people don’t like spirit; I don’t. But I know she has a very good cosmetic.
---
But mah boy :(
---
Ya its cool I’ll just never play her lol
---
Really, you can do well without add-ons as Ghostface, but you have to play VERY tactically and focus on adapting to survivors. Is this survivor going to be attentive? Stalk them instead of grabbing, and vice versa. Is this survivor good at loops? Then go for a sneak attack instead of stalking and approaching, essentially giving them a heads-up. Add-ons just reduce the difficulty of this, or allow for viable methods of outsmarting survivors (such as moving faster when crouched, or being able to hide your red stain longer and for greater periods of time with the License/Plan or Pen/Notebook). Though, I will admit, Ghostface is way more dependent on *perks* than he is add-ons.
---
I feel like if they did add him his ability would have something to do with his size, like I didnt watch all the movies but to my understanding he dousnt have any particular abilities other than the fact that hes a (Imortal?) doll.
---
Holy shit this made me lol good work
---
I have to comment because you explicitly called me dishonest and I don't appreciate being slandered. 
---
We have just gone through different experiences, it is also probable we play DBD on different systems so the playerbase we face is different and therefore our opinions are formed differently. It doesn't make either of us wrong.
---
I mean the new Call of Duty for example has crossplay even with PC players playing against console players. If it's anything to be scared about just have an option to disable cross play problem solved. If you find out or figure it's not fair turn it off. Only reason I'd love it is for having potentially cross saves in other devices.
---
Mine was a rhetorical question, same sarcasm as your's, just flipped.  Don't take it personal

---
Why didn't you put meat hooks in your back? It brings the whole experience together^/s ^obviously
---
I guess because there aren't rank rewards, it doesn't really matter because when my friends play with me, they're playing against killers they should be. But it is annoying that we have to wait 30 minutes for a game because of me, where otherwise they'd be waiting 1-3 minutes on their own, and about 5-10 minutes for me on my own.
---
But about the SWF advantage, I know it's definitely there, but I seem to have a much harder time winning when I play with friends. Played all nights with friends trying to get Ace to open the exit gates, closest I got was one game I finished the last generator but got sacrificed. I play one game on my own after my friends get off, and even with the ping, I escape.
---
One. you dont learn spirit. Two, Billy, Demo, Freddy, huntress, hag. most of them are high skill cap killers that take skill and can do well in high ranks

i recommend killer bodies, no sets. just collect your 6 favorite bodies, as theyre the biggest pieces
---
I think the DEVs would be %100 supportive. I just wish it were up to them lol. No secret that Sony is strongly anti-crossplay. Microsoft and Nintendo are moving forward with several plans, wouldn't be surprised to see crossplay hatching next year.
---
hawt!
---
Ps4-Screech201
---
Down for whatever, just enjoy playing the game
---
Mic preferred just cause it’s cool meeting new people and coordinating or just chilling’ and killin’ in custom matches
---
Yea but it's hag, she can just teleport back. Like I said it really depends on what Nea was doing prior. If she was afk the whole game you're in the right, if she chose to not take the risk of getting you you're wrong.
---
Remember, Nea wouldn't have known that the killer wasn't there. Most killers use the slug as bait.
---
&gt; it requires level 47 in the rift so they want us to get to level 47 in two weeks?
---
Incorrect, you have the remaining 68 or 67 days
---
The Putrid Serum will remain in the Rift for as long as the rift lasts. 
---
The two week event is just for gens, hooks and spoopy items.
---
I've had this exact thought before, because I will basically never take bbq off any killer with the bp grind being so ridiculous
---
I kinda want them to make just the blood point parts of bbq and wglf baseline, as both of them do kind of incentivize better play anyway.  So just remove that and make both of them useful on their own
---
69 days for the rift. 2 weeks for each individual tome page.
---
no i think you have 70 days to get them, the silly halloween gens and hooks are what last only 2 weeks and theyre just for bps so doesnt matter much
---
This is so cringy...
---
you know what, i’ll take it.

---
Someone pissed her off her last match
---
Was doing that twice intentionally? I think reddit is drunk
---
That's true. I hope they will
---
Maybe I had the skill bug out on me, but I literally just had a situation about an hour ago where I never hooked the survivor and yet they used DS on me.
---
And how is it idiotic to chase someone, hook them, they run across a map either hook someone else or can't find anybody, they turn around and seeing you just running around not a care in the world so they knock you down. They should 100% be able to hook you again. 
---
As for slugging, that shit doesn't even work right now with how quickly/how many heal states they are. By the time I slug someone, turn around and chase someone else for about 10 seconds the person I slugged is usually back on his feet and fully healed. lol sure, there are ways to play around it, it's still possible to get 3-4k matches as killer, but it's tedious.
---
And holy fuck people cling to "NOED is op" so badly, when there are some WAY worse perks out there. I'll take the small chance of having to deal with a NOED killer over having the killer run ruin. NOED just flat out seems like a crutch for almost every killer. Like... it for sure sucks to die to it, but in my 100 hours of playing, I've climbed more and ranked up better on killers without using it than when I did, because there are just so many better combinations out there.
---
Very true
---
I thought your hand had 4 fingers, but looks great!
---
Imma have to say no chief to fazbear. Im 18 and that thing gives me nightmares
---
Get rid of furtive for Make your choice
---
You told me to call it whatever I wanted, bro
---
Noed🤢
---
I'm pretty sure he knows to look directly at him, His English is bad. I've had plenty of cases where i can't expose a scream I'm looking directly at until I'm exposed. He's definitely still a bit bugged
---
Jesus that’s gonna be rough. I’m waiting till rank reset for that one. Put on Backpack Hag and hope to get a good map.
---
Altruism is just one of four methods of working towards your win. No survivor is obligated to risk their life for an obvious trap. There are some situations where realistically you are already dead, and its not your teammates obligation to risk everything to save you in those situations. Maybe Nea is a selfish cunt, maybe she is just reading the game state correctly. OP is 100% not reading the game state correctly and is a salty cunt.
---
That's reasonable
---
Swap NOED out for anything else and sure
---
Isn’t it good?
---
YES!! xD
---
I want you to know, out of all.the comments here, I read yours in the meme voice, preceeeded by a "dun dun dun dun dun dun" and a pause...

Some people don’t dc at all I know it seems foreign in this sub but it happens.
---
It’s a Crutch perk I play killer as well this isn’t a surviver thing but I don’t like the perk I don’t even use it when I play killer
---
Ahh thanks but then again that just makes it feel less of an event. It could be thanksgiving and I’m finally unlocking a Halloween skin lol but thanks again
---
#justpermavirginthings
---
Anything works on spirit, you must have little faith in you if you gotta use noed but whatever fits you.
---
Noed in higher ranks won't even activate. It's useless
---
Use something like BBQ or sloppy so they waste time healing
---
I mean to be honest yeah it’s a good perk. definitely helps you get kills, but it’s just really unfair.
---
On the contrary I recommend only getting killer heads it's seems to change the look most commonly assocamiated with said killers.
---
Only when you're the survivor. Playing as hillbilly, the hitbox is like swinging a needle around
---
Because is a bad perk, not a crutch. Quite opposite.. very weak one
---
I was joking I feel they have lots of potential goofy ness with clown
---
Like people have said before, take out NOED with something else. If I were you Rancor is a personal favourite. If you find your obsession after the last gen and can fit in one hit you'll be guaranteed one kill
---
I try to play both sides but survivor is just easy mode and low queue times
---
I'd prefer not to wait 20 minutes to play a low tier wraith
---
\*Laughs in low rank
---
Oh jeez, this is so creepy and terrifying! I would definitely be scared shitless if I had to face you in the trials....
---
A scream yes that is the name
---
I'm complementing the post, what are you smoking?
---
&gt; a salty cunt.
---
Strong wording on that one but OP is definitely breaking game rules and should be banned.
---
I've in all honestly got 0 sympathy for people that play SWFs because it can be so oppressive. You get 1 person super good at kiting and their team can get like 1-2 generators done before the killer can knock the person. And having a rank 5 survivors that are good against a rank 20-8 killer can make the game unbearable for the killers. They aren't chatting and laughing with their friends and having a good time.
---
I totally understand people wanting to play with their friends and everything, but that shit can make for a miserable gaming experience for a killer. There should be an un-ranked version where people can do whatever without having to worry about shitty queue times and what-not. I'm not even worried about my rank most of the time, outside of having to wait like 30 minutes to play killer when under rank 15.
---
If you have Nurse's, equip it. Can't tell you how many times I've been able to down people self healing nearby thinking I'm too busy chasing another survivor and using phase to break chase to go to them instead.
---
Lmao i love when people say noed isnt a crutch. its litterally the definition of a crutch. Its a reward for doing bad.
---
Lol. Point out the ingame fact that there is a status effect that prevents healing, and someone goes through and downvotes all of your comments. This fucking community is ridiculous haha.
---
Ok, just ignore that... Instead... "The game is a broken piece of shit, but just keep playing." seems to be the usual go to that people like to hear. 😂.
---
u/zylez is using a redirection site (**qualityonehere\.best**) to hide their spam site.
---
I don't think so. You just have to play the right killer with the right build
---
I haven’t had any issues with it.
---
I mean, the wait times are terrible, but it’s not unplayable.
---
Cat-Nea is the best thing I ever saw.
---
But is punished by horrendous map pressure and the fact that pallet vaults are still the same speed. Ignores being good to a certain extent
---
**This post is spam** from a stolen/compromised account: u/erikodo

Be careful of any t-shirt links in the comments.
---
1. if they made one they would get shit cause it would be sexist. 2. this sounds like a mega virgin post
---
i have 3 more of these gems, but i do not know how to post more then 1 pic.
---
It's never been a basic perk on switch sadly.. It's only available in the shrine and on switch, we haven't had it in the shrine yet since we don't have the halloween event yet.. :(
---
sure i did, doesn't mean its not wrong bro
---
Just report in-game and that should be enough.
---
You're right but during events the toxicity seems to rise.
---
I don't know if you've found a new bug, are making this up or got  head-on and assumed it was DS. It litterally cannot happen because the only way to activate DS is to leave a hook. 
---
And stop it with the overdramatisation lol. 10 seconds from downed state is just a stupid digit you made up to serve your point. Slugging is excellent: you avoid DS, get to chase someone else sometimes, and at least one other survivor uses up precious time running to the slug and healing him instead of working on gens. You get 3 people doing nothing productive towards the escape. 
---
The guy isnt invicible. Smack him and leave him to think about his mistakes. If they play like this they just want to taunt you anyways.
---
Smh to anyone that uses "infinite" without knowing what a real infinite was like in 2016
---
Yes I watched the video Tru3 put out today
---
I don't really know. I just know that when I get a team of try hards in my lobby I know it's not going to be a fun game. I try not to let it bother me though.
---
Just report. Not like the devs will ever do something about it
---
Why bro? Just saying isn't right because it is it's a fallacy bro
---
i did this so often as killer.
---
The problem with Borrowed time is that the rescued has no say over its trigger. The rescuer doesn’t have any agency over who saves them, decisive gives them a bit more of a “fuck you” that they control. 
---
And your downplaying a scenario that isn’t at all that rare
---
Those orange gens are marked that color for the Withering Blight Event... 
---
Just so you know.

you sure that is not just the special gens?

umm the community seems to feel that reports in game go on def ears. Do you know of any other means? I see a lot of players like this and they haven't been punished yet. At one point he even implys I can report him and it will do nothing.
---
Yup, even the killer sees it.
---
The trade off is that you no longer need monitor and abuse for tier 1 Myers. A perk slot is worth way more to me

Thank you for sharing that, I'd love for you to read this: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/60j6se/hi_im_a_dead_by_daylight_player_and_psychologist/
---
...It might give insight as to why that feels dissatisfying. I've heard others argue that a escaping/dying doesn't matter, it's just all about BP farming: That determines a successful game or not. Others say it's about pipping, but Killers like the Plague don't pip even when they play well. And if it's about killing... well, sometimes players DC, Suicide on Hook, give up, or use a key: Those are their decisions, it doesn't mean you need to be dissatisfied, don't let your happiness hinge on that.
---
Ehhh.. no..
---
I never saw that, neither in my games not people I follow. To do that I literally have to derank to rank 15, and even then I'm not sure for how matchmaking works these days
---
Can't shred over windows and pallets
---
Normally I do, but this seems to be a unique level of toxic.
---
Dang. That's quite the coincidence then haha
---
It's just the event generators, map does the same thing
---
Don’t let them assholes ruin your day. Just toxic pricks.
---
Ok tell me the difference between noed and adrenaline
---
Because I can already tell you one to help you, one can be denied, the other cannot
---
Kyle Gallner wants his face in the game for Quentin
---
Joe Keery is a hot man
---
If they are salty that just means that they lost and it was humiliating for them. If they want to have a calm discussion on why the game was unfair that’s cool but this shit is just people acting like children.
---
It becomes an everyday routine, sadly. Simply move on, you’re a killer after all. Fulfill your task by all means necessary
---
thanks for sharing i ordered one also
---
some ppl really do go out of there way to be an asshole though during events and I do not mean just them not wanting to farm
---
You can't, but you can place them in an imgur album and link in a comment!
---
Can be denied before it even activate. It can be denied also after it activate
---
It's a wasted slot 99% of the cases. Low ranks excluded
---
"surprisingly"
---
yeah i opened with gg like i normally do, most of the games i have had during the event have been less toxic then normal tbh. A lot of nice surv lately.
---
Because straight people don’t matter anymore. Neither do white men. It’s all about the gays and make believe genders
---
M-Scrote and his ringbois are assuming the only people who will get that far are sweaty SWFs...ergo that's what the cheeves are "balanced" around.
---
Where did I say there is no point? I said it’s dumb to do it first because it won’t shift meta until nerfs happen. They clearly do need buffs desperately but nerfs come first to shift meta.
---
Meme reference
---
no it's flavored as a question when it's a rant. i know what a rhetorical question is
---
man, that sucks. I really enjoy it when it does work
---
There are some stability issues with the latest release. The menus are more laggy and I've been getting a lot of connection issues. They 've done a lot behind the scenes and adding the archives seems to have left room for optimization. I would expect there to be a bug fix/ stability patch in the next few weeks. That's my own speculation...
---
i used to do that but now not anymore. Im tired of toxic campers.
---
A really big thing to remember is that pallets won’t succ you anymore, so killers can kind of hit you if it’s timed right. Just be careful around pallets and don’t rely on old vacuum pallets
---
So help eliminate them. No point dcing and giving them the wib
---
Couldn't read it, is because mobile?
---
All survivors start the trial separated

Reminds me of the giant Legion bug

Of course.

---
Vigo
---
It's not good sportsmanship if you meant to rub it in.
---
Some people do. Those are the parameters for when it looks like that.
---
Falling is supposed to be risky, that's why the killer doesnt have a fall stun and they have balanced landing as an available perk to make up for that difference. Some of the strongest loops involve drops with balanced landing. Enabling them to be further exploited would be unfair.
---
Stonks.
---
We get it, no one’s ever satisfied.
---
Shock Therapy range for one. Default range basically guarantees you won't be able to use it to interrupt actions with it.
---
Speaking of.... Survivors should get costumes for Halloween events. Witch, Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster.. ect.
---
Then why do so many SWFs only gg when they win?
---
One can only hope
---
Sucks man. Just keep farming the bloodwebs.

I don't come on reddit that much.
---
The original meme was posted in a Discord I'm on, and I loved it so much I had to make fanart.
---
Unaware it has already been made, but frankly its more fun seeing other people's interpretation of the meme and adding their flavor on the idea.
---
Cute!!
---
Not my problem if you don't believe me or not.
---
And it isn't much of an exaggeration with how fast people are healing right now. Or how many ways people can recover health. I don't even hate DS that much overall, but I think it's probably the single dumbest perk in the game, because it gives players a free pass for playing dumb. There are more ways to abuse DS than most other perks in the game.
---
Also, if you think at higher ranks people are just going to leave someone downed for long, then LUL.
---
It's not Killer players' fault tunnelling is optimal play, save for a few band-aid perks.
---
I had this bug a month or so go on a swamp map as huntress
---
Maybe this would be to much, but not having it so he has to switch between modes and just having him be able to shock or melee at any point in time.
---
If you've ever visited a post game chat you wouldn't be surprised
---
I don’t think he needs a buff I think he needs a full rework like Freddy. Not sure what they’re gonna do but I’m very hopeful for him
---
Either way if you've played against flashlights as a killer then you know how annoying they really are, 
---
Wonder if they should change it so a flashlight "Illuminates" traps, since that seems to be the direction Behaviour seems to be going now with Freddy, Witch, and the Trapper.
---
Thank you kind sir
---
Billy op fax no printer
---
It happened to me so many times today. I was either left or tunneled and mori'd off the hook. I just wanted that escape as Claudette challenge. I finally did it after 5 hours
---
I think you're being downvoted because you called stripes, plaid. It's called fashion honey, look it up. ^/s
---
We all want to see that schlong
---
Plague doctor mask was The Doctor, right?
---
I honestly have no idea. If you want to see it in it's current state dm me your email
---
Lmao sure.
---
does myers still have the 6m terror radius or nah?
---
Because there’s 4 survivors
---
That's the thing, she can't blink instantly after missing therefore while she didn't go down 3 tiers she isn't the God she used to be
---
I noticed the extremely long wait decreased as I ranked up. Once I got to rank 10 or so I tend to find games in &lt; 10 min. I’d say just stick it out and I’m sure your queue times will improve!
---
Maybe I'm wrong but I think if you stand too close to any vault you can get hit through it.
---
Lmao “Name of thing”
---
"Name of thing"
---
I had the money and I wanted to have the extra goodies. Also it helps out the game. There's no harm in it.
---
Be friendly and farm that’s how I got the level 1 one
---
Give him a slow, a teleport, and call it a rework, like the others.
---
Though it sucks how the ruin is uncleansable and likely resulted in your team getting bodied from lack of gens, ruin should try to be worked through and can. If 3 survivors are working on gens from the very beginning of the game, two should pop (assuming the killer stops progression on one) if the first person caught puts up somewhat of an acceptable chase. Granted, I'm still shit at finding pallets any where on Yamaoka Estate and understanding how to run the weird tiles. Luckily though it wasn't Devour Hope.
---
And trapper, pig, clown, wraith and plague
---
Thank you for your advice, I'll keep it up! :)
---
Have they announced the dates yet?
---
I want Rob Zombies Halloween 2 mountain man michael.
---
How are there that many ways to abuse DS? If you keep track of how long they have been off the hook you can easily nullify it if it's that big of a problem for you which it sounds to be. There are definitely not more ways to abuse DS than other perks. Unless the killer is dumb. It's one of the few perks that you as the killer can judge when it's cool down is up and when it activates. Come on bro, stop being so God damn dramatic.
---
Unfortunately no.
---
Which Is why you should buy the Soulja Boy Console port instead.
---
Not true. This is considered sandbagging. It's okay as long as the killer doesn't know the survivor
---
We also had a dc and the hag was very good with trap placements. Our only chance really was cleansing it.
---
Anything can be cringe, no matter how fun you have.
---
I think he does not
---
Ummmm, when did that happen? Micheal killed his sister when he was six and was taken to a psychiatric hospital where he stayed for 15 years and escaped on halloween at the age of 21.
---
SWOLE
---
I know I've seen them but in the game she looks motherly.
---
3 saves in the endgame collapse!!! That’s insane!!
---
You need to use the petal offering and have to complete the Halloween gens or Halloween hooks. If they are normal you don’t get the points
---
You're kidding. Clown has a power. He closes loops and can use our to catch up. If you cut off a survivor's path with his no-no gas during EGC he at least has a chance to get a second hit in with a good bottle.
---
Legion's power is useless once the generators are done. What are you gunna do, run slightly faster to gate and get one hit on the survivor? It's why you need STBFL on Legion if you want any presence at all late game.
---
I play a bit of plague and the number of people who don't understand that she can start with a pool of corruption in purple and red ranks is crazy. Also when someone cleanses on the opposite side of the map of the last three gens and someone gets all pissy end game, when the only way for the plague to get the pool is to walk clear across the map and give time to finish the last gen.
---
Was happening to me, I restarted my game then it worked
---
Well people will always target whats strongest, and that sorta makes sense. Whatevers the strongest makes you inclined to use it even if you like something else better, before that was nurse, now its Spirit. People weren't complaining about spirit because she wasnt the best, she wasnt making people want to play her purely for her power, that was nurses job.
---
Its okay. I don't mean to sound rude. Just had a very long day
---
Right and I sometimes get into really balanced matches where I almost dont escape but I do and I love games like that where I'm challenged but not trolled and people are being jerks. If a killer draws out a game and goes for points instead of kills at the end of the day and still pips thats also possible. You dont have to suck the joy out of the game for everyone.
---
I forgot to mention that I have been burning the offering as well, the game tells me I get 3k points for the completion but at the end of the match it shows I got the points but the game doesn't give them to me.
---
Id say shes still the strongest killer in the game without a doubt. If your good with her your still gonna destroy with her
---
Why is Michael walking his dinner for tonight?
---
Come on bro stop acting like there aren't tons of ways to abuse the perk to work to the advantage of survivors. I never said you couldn't play around it, I said I don't like that it's a free time kill on the side of survivors and that it promotes survivors to play like idiots because they know they're untouchable for 60s. Even slugging them is in reality a time waster. I could just as easily say stop being so dramatic about getting tunneled bro, because plenty of times survivors get tunneled for playing poorly.
---
If you don’t like it then don’t play. If you do try to get better. There will always be people better than you but given enough time you will find yourself winning more. Once you hit rank 1 then you can call yourself decent at survivor. If you really want to with get a group of 3 other good survivors and watch as you crush every game that doesn’t have one of those powerful offerings or add ons like prayer beads or iridescent heads.
---
no fallacys here
---
Yes, well, apparently staring into nothing is the best workout routine/driver's ed
---
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity
---
Hope you got balanced landing for that drop
---
I think he means scream
---
-Some totem spawns can't be reached at all. -Some hexes spawn as dull totems. -Archive challenges aren't working properly? I kicked 8+ gens (only needed 6) Says I only damaged 2? -Match making is shit. Level 19 killer gets paired with level 8 survivors? No thanks. -Sometimes can't be healed. Sometimes can't heal others.
---
PC
---
so i  assume that the update was originally as buggy as fo76, but delayed as much as they could to attempt to fix most of the bugs, but with this bug and having personally seen a David have the sprint burst bug happen to him it seems like they didn't iron out all of the bugs intime
---
Exactly I really hope they get rid of these challenges
---
Yeah some of these challenges make it so you wanna derank so you can do them more easily. I know high ranked survivors who are experienced are gonna know common trap locations as well as be extra cautious around grassy areas etc.
---
There used to be a test with that. 
---
A group of mainly killer players played 100 matches with survivor perk less. 
---
They lost a single game and the total deaths didn’t reach double digits.
---
She didn’t have haunted grounds. She had thrill of the hunt and ruin, and we cleansed thrill of the hunt.
---
It might mean just finish 4 which still hard but possible
---
Devs are idiots
---
You can't tell me that wouldn't be terrifying chasing you around.
---
Don’t forget we still have 3 more levels with challenges to complete.

Oh no. 😱 There was balance to her before removing her phasing sound. Man, what a shame that they removed it so you have no idea if you could safely get a small amount of distance from her instead of the broken state she's currently in especially considering the speed at which she moves while phasing. 
---
Everything has a counter to it in this game. There's nothing that counters a spirit with their headphones blasting away. You can't even run from the blue bitch with iron will in your loadout. There is absolutely no counter play to her. She's currently broken as fuck. But sure, she needs more buffs before everyone else gets their shot in rotation right? Fuck out of here.
---
that’s odd because i’ve been seeing people say that spirit is super strong and needs tweaks for a long time now 
---
just because it was drowned out by nurse hate doesn’t mean it hasn’t existed
---
4 coordinated survivors are far more powerful than a killer.
---
And you must have done that by either getting lucky with teammates using coin offerings or by playing SWF and getting them to use them. Only 3 chests spawn by default, then 5 with the Shiny Coin offering.
---
Yeah, that's not an issue. That's the way it should be.
---
Oh, okay, I'm against such behavior too. Some people just think that what I listed above is toxic.
---
Yeah, I dont know why this killer isnt removed from the game still...
---
I don't think it's needed really...
---
cool!
---
I feel all of these
---
depends on chance and addons chief
---
Level 4 of The Archives got leaked and you can only earn 85 fragments in total on that level. Going off level 1 and level 4 The Archives won't even cut down half of the time I mentioned in the post.
---
Noed is a fair perk ngl
---
It takes a lot of practice to judge how far a blink will carry you (now, there's a brown add-on that gives you an indicator).
---
After blinking, there's a significant fatigue animation, during which it is easy to lose track of Survivors.
---
You have a VERY limited time to get a hit/second blink after blinking before getting the fatigue.
---
Nurse's base movement speed is *slower* than the Survivors' running speed. That means, without blinking, you can't really catch up to Survivors. This is why she is so hard to learn; not only is her blink hard to use, but you HAVE to use it. With most Killers, you *can* do well without even using their powers. Not with the Nurse.
---
Yo! they buffed trapper a lot!
---
How about just make it get disabled after another survivor is hooked so it is truly an “anti tunnel” perk.
---
I have never had any problems versing a spirit unless they managed to outsmart my mind game while I was guessing their mind game. And I'd suggest that anyone who has trouble playing against spirit should learn spirit to know how to and how not to react more. She isn't hard to mind game and you can make her mind game herself.
---
It does use the term completely repair. That makes me think from 0-100% progress on it.
---
GG i guess?

**t-shirt spammer**

Hahaha this is amazing ! I take my hat off

/u/vredditshare
---
I personally don't do that.
---
If it's only you and another survivor vs the Killer, and the other surv gets hooked... well, sorry, but you're dead. Unless the killer specifically runs off to the other side of the map to let the unhook happen, going for the unhook is a losing play, because one of you two WILL end up chased and hooked again right away. So either you 'save' the other survivor just for him to get rehooked, or you save him at your own expense. 
---
If you already found the hatch, I can fully get behind just staying there and taking it.
---
Entirely different story if exit gates are powered, or there's 3+ survivors around... but 2 survivors is a lock-down victory for the killer.
---
Huh, your ghostface and rank is really similar to the one in the video that Tru3 just uploaded, your name didn't happen to be hunter did it? Also I had this glitch last night, except instead of my character level, it was my player level, i was devotion 6 million haha.
---
They rise to the occasion, yes.
---
her new outfit fixes that
---
read the perk buddy.
---
Oh before I yeet into the distance BBQ&amp;Chili is in the shoring this week and if you ever play killer and/or like bloodpoints you should grab that
---
That was the Entity
---
Yeah, specifically if the offering has "Secret" as part of the description, it is hidden from Survivors, though in practice 99% of secret offerings used are Moris.
---
Noed is for baby killers tho
---
This was really well done, I was afraid it would be cringe but it was great!
---
One step further is chuckles I believe that is actually the least known name of him.
---
if you’re missing bloodpoints, you can send a support ticket in. Sent one in a month or so back for 15k missing as well, although 15k really ain’t much, but they sent me 50k bc of it.
---
No I could see it's aura. Maybe the first game this is what happened but the second game I made sure to check and the totem was there and lit up. It gave me the speed boost but not the Insta downs.
---
It comes from a series YT vids called Hilarious Halloween Outtakes.
---
He killed his father and his sister's boyfriend
---
"Matches where *KILLERS* play for *KILLS* ... are such a waste of time"
---
YOU FUDGING WHAT?!
---
By-the-by, most of my solo Survivor games result in 2+ escapes.
---
u right
---
If you are using your shred ability that’s why
---
Well then I'm a baby killer. When your killer is only like level 20 you use what you have. Sorry I don't follow the survivor rule book.
---
The real question is do you call Clown and ghostface by their real names or aliases? As well as each individual Legion?
---
Have you? Even at rank 1 it causes exposed status effect.
---
I pooped my pants too after that sick outplay wtfff
---
Just in case you don’t know, noed won’t make your power insta down.
---
when i play survivor i always let baby doctors kill me 
---
doctor main solidarity 😤
---
All I did was make it so that there's no difference between being then Obsession or not. I actually slightly buffed the perk.
---
If not then do you have any other hex perks that would also be lit? Trying to eliminate all bases
---
it's rare that I'm not immediately tunneled after a successful DS and normally die anyway. just eat it if you need to attack the same survivor within a minute. it doesn't need to be nerfed.
---
I mean that just means your a bad trapper if you couldn't complete the 2 survivors in 1 game one.
---
All 4 survivors is kinda sus though unless your in low ranks.
---
Damn, they didn't even use lube
---
feels bad, man
---
Nice to know but I hit them with a regular m1. I'm not lying lol. It's not a big deal but it is a bug. Is it really surprising?
---
wait so if something in the store costs nothing at all. What happens if you try to buy it?
---
Guys guys guys, killer is nea cockson
---
Shock should stun (stop) as shock is his most important ability but doesn't inspire any real worry.
---
Just wouldn't let me, not enough currencies
---
In other words, you want the game to go back to when Killers were completely powerless?
---
Yeah well I don’t play trapper and I’m rank 1 so I didn’t feel like trying hard lol
---
&gt;if there is a Dull Totem remaining on the Map, this Hex is applied to it. 
---
Going through the other replys it seems the totem was still lit but you didnt specify this in the OP. Your likely using shred, and if not then i've never seen this bug happen, must be new on this patch.
