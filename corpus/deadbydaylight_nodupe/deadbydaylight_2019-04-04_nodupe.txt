yo op what happened in post chat?

---
Quick question without any judgement: Are you immersed? 
---
I WAS ON PC. YOU'LL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IF YOU GET HIM IN YOUR LOBBY.
---
You’re wrong. They played up the humor (intentional and otherwise) in ED2 because people reacted strongly to it. 
---

---
And since when is it a rule that exploring a new genre is somehow disqualifying? Are Moonraker and Jason X no longer part of their respective series because they introduce sci-fi? Do you watch the funny X-Files episodes separately?

You need to get hit and have mettle of man activated then have the killer leave you so you can 99 yourself. You need a medkit with enough charges to 99 yourself or you need to unironically run self care which is already too much effort. The perk is already good enough without needing to do all of that.
---
And Small Game, my guy
---
I prefer jane, ash is over hyped in my opinion
---
Why do that when you could just... heal yourself before you get caught?
---
He definitely earned it before and had video evidence. They even acknowledged he had it and still didn’t fix it. He said he never wanted to be a fog whisperer though which I respect. 
---
I don't really know what that means
---
I find it is extremelu annoying as well
---
I think there are similar pictures of the wraith and hillbilly that you could use for the other wallpapers. 
---
ZA WARUDO! 
---
TOKEIA TOMENEI
---
WHY IS THE TRAPPER SO FAST? THE DUDE IS SPEED WALKING EVERYWHERE!! I LITERALLY DON'T HAVE TIME TO RUN OR THINK BECAUSE HES ON MY ASS WHEN HE SEES'S ME!   
---
P.S if any of yall wanna play, hmu on steam. Drop/dm ya unsernames and ill add :) 
---
WHY IS IT THAT WHEN I GO AGAINST A HAG THEY CAN FULL SPEED LUNGE ME OUT OF A FUCKING TELEPORT, BUT WHEN I DO IT I WALK LIKE I'M FUCKING FDR FOR A SOLID 3 SECONDS? OR EVEN BETTER, HOLD LEFT CLICK, AND JUST DO A NORMAL FUCKING **SWIPE**
---
Speaking of reaches, comparing a 30 year old Nintendo game with any game with competitive online interaction. LOL
---
There’s always been an elongated window there, where the staircase turns. 
---
Trick question. You both are evil for standing in a corner doing nothing while someone else is getting downed 
---
I'M GONNA SAY IT AND YOU CANNOT STOP ME:
---
#GROOVY
---
Sounds cool. Maybe they could create a BP pool, evenly distributed to all survivors if ANY of them escaped. It would emphasize the team aspect a lot more, players would feel less frustrated for getting kill rushed if they started viewing team success as their own. Right now if I'm not playing in an SWF, I give less of a shit whether my teammates live or die if I didn't escape, too. If BP was pooled in some form, I don't technically 'lose' just because I was eliminated early. 
---
Relax 
---
But no, killers need more nerfs, amirite Behaviour?
---
There it is
---
tbh its legion so it should had been a expected a bit
---
It’s confusing even on a re-watch. The Evil Dead ends with the force rushing at Ash as he screams. About 7 or 8 minutes into ED2 the recap ends the same way and as he’s flying through the trees the sequel proper is beginning. If you know that you’ll see that it’s a full-blown prequel and the only thing after the recap that rehashes the first film is the tamer tree rape. Everything else is entirely new when compared to the first film.
---
People have even cut the two films together by cutting to the post-recap ED3 right at the end of the first film.
---
I mean... All the buttons are DC
---
OH OK I'VE NEVER GOTTEN AGAINST HIM 
---
I don’t think he said anything, prob left as soon as the game was over 
---
No mither? I love running it. Usually don’t use decisive with it though I prefer resilience because if left unnoticed you can destroy generators super fast.  Iron will is great as well, it’s just hard to choose over dead hard.  The no mither build is extremely fun to play imo.  Being one shot is tough but it’s s good challenge that I extremely enjoy.   Loadout I used to run
---
Self care, urban, we’ll make it / leader, sprint burst / balanced.  Lithe doesn’t trigger at the right time in most cases.  Anymore though I prefer not to heal and if it happens then it happens.  
---
did the killer help you or no?
---
Trust me, I understand wholeheartedly. I got pretty sick of the sweat that was the red ranks. I gave in to underhanded tactics long ago and have never looked back. I also strongly admire you for actually having the courage to admit anything to the motley crew that is this sub. Kudos. &lt;3
---
Pfft no, I can tell you he did not live. 
---
Twitch breeds disconnects. Change my mind. 
---
What do you consider a broken perk?
---
I'm a little too used to the muscle memory of having it, I'm afraid. So I have like 30 of them at any given time. 
---
What perk did you used to use that you're swapping for MoM? 
---
It's a good build, I agree, but it just doesn't seem to me like it's so good as to be problematic and OP like in the days of old DS and self care before the healing slowdown.

Mending Simulator is not fun, play a different killer
---
nope, just rational - part of being rational is not investing into something you do not enjoy if it does not bring you benefits, such as playing a match against 1-2 of the 6 addons in the entire game I dont like, out of hundreds.
---
and because I am rational in that regard, I not only understand, but wholly encourage anyone who is playing against me, or even with me, to DC if they are not having fun - I'll probably laugh about it, but I dont put blame on people for doing it, and thats because their time and enjoyment is more important to them than mine. pretty simple concept, really.
---
I mean she only gets hurt if you get caught. :^)
---
We made the holster from scratch using fabric and stuff from a craft store, and I modified a Spirit Halloween animated chainsaw - hollowed it out, put the handle with the button on the inside with a hole and we used thermoplastic to make all of the "metal" parts. Used one of those lighter leashes and attached it and a fake handle to the side so I can "rev it up" and press the button on the inside and the chains will move and speaker will rev too.
---
Unpopular opinion but... I would want Ginny from F13 part 2:( she also wears a blue shirt!!!
---
Of course not, but her relationship to Ash is explained in Season 2 and is barely hinted at in The Evil Dead.
---
I agree I have low self esteem and every time I play dbd I get hate mail and I want to die. I'm not even a good player. I m a level 10 killer with only 10 hours in the game and no teachable perks yet go against 4 man survive with friends who are using 4 2nd chance perks. Even when I get annihilated survivors still bully me.
---
It seems like the only downside for avoiding against boosted squads is that some dude on the Internet will do the *"bawk bawk, you chicken!?"* routine. No wonder they're getting dodged.
---
David King (different from David Tap) and Meg are free. If you're playing on console you might have to download him (the chapter he's in specifically is Chapter V: A Lullaby for the Dark) but regardless you don't have to pay to use him.
---
She's also borderline psychotic if you've ever listened to her when she was on one of those podcast rants with Tofu and other streamers. Her boyfriend doesn't seem to be far off from that road either - no wonder they don't get along with Mr. Bathrobe aka TydeTime, it's like a competition among them to see who can be the biggest nutjob. 
---
dbd, the B movie of games.
---
It seems like the only downside for avoiding against boosted squads is that some dude on the Internet will do the *"bawk bawk, you chicken!?"* routine, flapping elbows and everything. No wonder they're getting dodged. I doubt they'll ever penalize it, so it might be time to start looking at incentives.
---
Yeah? You'd prefer a 30-minute ban because your dog ripped the ethernet cable out of the wall? 
---
His perks are far superior. 
---
Decisive/Borrowed/perk of choice depending on my preferred playstyle at the time. Borrowed if I am getting a lot of unsafe saves lately, decisive if I cant rely on my teammates to save me safely or pre rework decisive, and maybe we'll make it for safe saves? Really the last one didnt seem all that important and MoM is better than most of them. Even more so if you often carry a health kit like me and can drop self care for borrowed.
---
I'm not sure how this is important though. I explained why MoM is stupid strong right now and you dont even need an instant heal, either a medkit or self care and teammates you probably told to heal you to 90% instead of 100.
---
To many. 
---
No scratch marks for killer 
---
Idk pretty sure people who play Fornite have a disease.
---
Because it makes you an attractive target to chase and waste time on for the killer.
---
If they found 2 survivors one of which who is injured they are likely to go after the injured one if the hook states are relatively the same.
---
It's all about wasting time. If you're full hp it doesnt have the same effect.
---
Also you dont have to self care it. You can get understanding teammates and a medkit of any type and just heal to 90 to 99 with them and use the medkit for the last 1% allowing you more time to put on gens on top of more time in a chase.
---
Hey just FYI if you wait more than 5 second before the downvote, it'll look like some one else was being petty
---
So when using his power, he's basically a powerless Hag/Huntress/Spirit with Enduring, Brutal Strength, and Save the Best For Last?
---
I missed that discussion. Why is it a hard no?
---
Then I throw open those doors and say "Boo." in the most Master Chief-like voice I can manage.

Two instant heals technically 
---
I think Jeff is still the king of being loud.

Thats kinda smart tbh. Just let your crops grow while you play dbd
---
Just saw an ash hiding in lockers and crouching up to gens. Broke my fucking soul man
---
hail to the kings baby

&amp;#x200B;
---
When OP is a survivor main
---
You know flashlight blind got changed to just me a kind of closed eye now right?
---
The creator is a pedo
---
Fixed DS though....
---
//killer mains only have that controller (;
---
Are you forgetting the fact that it doesnt charge up against anything but M1 attacks? The only way to charge up MoM stacks against good huntress, myers, billys is to take hits while they are carrying someone which is a huge waste of time just to activate the perk.
---
Self care is no where near meta ever since the healing nerfs, its not worth the perk slot anymore because it just takes too long.
---
To be fair, a lot of the perks and character bios have typos like this. Probably why people thought  it. Whoever is responsible for writing those out really needs a proof reader or even a good writing assistant program. 
---
Sorry for lashing out, but I get that response a shit ton and 99% of those who comment like that are douche bags who gate on furries, sorry again XD 
---
Just play and do not pay attention to it.  There is no special way to get them faster other than being a good player.  
---
Play both a killer and a survivor match a day for the bonus EXP. and the rest is to just play alot. Thats pretty much it
---
Gaming addiction is definitely a real disorder, but (as far as I know) the process leading into it, and the effects it has on your body and brain, are not conducive to a disease.
---
If you fall into the poor habit of overfocusing on a game or gaming, and you do it to the point it gets in the way of basic needs and social obligations, you're on your way to creating a dependency. That dependency will slowly cause that kind of disorder if you let it become the central part of your life, instead of just remaining a part of your life.
---
 Honestly, gaming addiction is more akin to fucking up your sleep schedule and calling it insomnia than actually having or creating a chemical dependency or imbalance.
---
Make that 2, Jane &gt; Ash 
---
That I can agree with...
---
I see nothing wrong in this picture 
---
[removed]
---
Imagine encouraging killers to DC in the middle of a match when they don't like the survivor's loadout. "Mettle of Man? Ooops my ethernet!"
---
With my luck I'll run around nearly every inch of the map and have 4 totems be revealed on it; none of which are Ruin. I've had this happen 3 times out of 4 when I used the map last week. 
---
Didn’t the creators of “Friday the 13th” get in some serious legal problems with the creators of the movies? I don’t think Behaviour would want to get into that 
---
It's not important, I just wanted to know. I'm not grilling you or anything, it's just a conversation. Are you downvoting me?
---
You tend to get shards fast when playing survivor as games are usually shorter compared to killer. 
---
I'm not sure if the longer you stay in the game, the more XP you accumulate but generally when playing survivor I found that I gained shards significantly faster than by playing killer.
---
Play games frequently as to constantly level your XP up. Try your best to rush through gens &amp; escape as fast as you. This should allow you to level up faster.
---
Which maps are broken in survivors favor besides haddonfield  
---
Hell yeah that's my favorite Meg head cosmetic 
---
When everyone brings offerings to increase the mist in the trial
---
Considering F13 is nearly dead and will be within the year after all the crap...wouldn’t be surprised. 
---
when the killer is the ultimate life form, run at 150% speed
---
I agree to a point, if you crouch and don’t find them at a gen or somehow walking around without them noticing you, you just wasted a lotta time. She’s definitely the only stealth killer I’d give an exception to when it comes to the perk being strongish on them though.

Its half baked but not a bad idea. Idk why everyone says he is basically trapper, they could make jason's perks so much more brute focused. I think if his ability was more like he is able to supress terror radius for so many seconds at a time, that would add to the suprise factor. Not too sure how i feel about the shrine
---
It is there. She’s the annoying 5th wheel and when she insists on going home it’s big bro Ash who has to take her. And she taunts him by pointing out that she’s his sister when possessed.
---
You can’t just pretend something that’s there isn’t there because it doesn’t fit with your demonstrably-false statement.
---
Here’s another one for you: why isn’t he in medieval times in AoD? I mean, you act like AoD isn’t required viewing but you’d go from him being surrounded by knights to living in a trailer park.
---
You know, admitting you’re wrong really isn’t that hard. 
---
Yeah, but also mortal kombat licensed jason so its not impossible
---
Ez gg
---
They basically would do the same as they did with Hillbilly and Leatherface. Except this time it’s Jason and Trapper. Trapper is there generic non licensed version of Jason, just like Hillbilly is non licensed Leatherface. Could use an aura reading ability power. Could try to incorporate water into the game by adding a new map with a lake. They have plenty of options, but could easily just copy and paste trapper. 
---
I mean, murder is illegal. 
---
g r o o v y
---
And a horrible lengthy Bloodweb grind to first unlock/buy that perk, and then a whole other diceroll of whether it will even appear in the Bloodweb at all. 
---
Someone should try making a fan made kit for jason
---
He specified that he was doing gens and unhooking, but I don’t know if that was edited afterwards or simply that you didn’t notice. Hate immersed survivors with a passion though
---
The interesting thing about trapper and hag is the playing survivor will help you out significantly.   As trapper, think: how would I loop here if I were being chased? And hag think, where would I walk to get from point A to B? They're also my favorite killers and few seem to understand them.
---
Happy cake day!
---
What outfits?
---
I BOUGHT ASH AND I STILL HAVENT BEEN GIVEN ASH, WHO WANTS TO BE GIVEN THINGS THEY PAID MONEY FOR 
---
Maybe have it like Legion where you can swap between the two, simply call them the Winchester Brothers instead of just one specific name like the others
---
This might help curb people letting themselves die on hook a bit but I don't see how 2000 potential bp is going to stop people who have already chosen to forgoe any point gain by disconnecting, I don't chronic disconnecters really care, I've seen people ragequit in the middle of matches during double bp events.
---
Yes, this would be holding the game hostage. Report them when they do this if you like. I have no idea if it makes a difference but it's worth a shot.
---
[this is what I decided to do with it](https://i.imgur.com/geVSf8B.gif)
---
It's not holding it hostage because they didn't technically prevent your movement or your ability to end the match, they were just being garden-variety dickheads.
---
Honestly imagine that with enduring, brutal strength and STBFL. Shit would be insane to go against. 
---
You file a bad touch complaint with Entity HR
---
I'm not trying to defend or attack anyone, but I can only imagine how difficult it is to truly balance a game out or get it as close as possible. For example; I thought The Wraith was a trash killer. You can clearly see him coming and you can always run away via sprint burst. Yesterday, I saw a top level player use him with perks I never thought would work together and he recked people for days. He made it look too easy every single time.
---
I know that's just one example, but it is one way in which smart players can truly break the game. There's a ton of smart players out there, and I'm sure that they'll continue to find ways to abuse the games mechanics even if a hundred more patches come out.
---
That being said, BH did come up with some pretty bad patches. They're not perfect, and they look for us to help them with their game. We have to work as a community so that this game thrives. Im 100% on board with people who get frustrated over mechanics, or loading into a game to have one person DC, or to have the killer insta DC due to the recent patches. I completely understand, but let's work together for a better future for the game. 
---
I love this game and the community for it is nothing short of funny ass meme lords. I love this subreddit, it makes my day sometimes. All I'm hoping for is for all of us to work together to make this game even more kick ass.
---
If you got 4 hook saves and completed two gens solo you must’ve gone down pretty quickly in chases, unless your red ranks. 
---
lol no biggie. Fair number of my friends are involved in the furry community in some way (only like one or two of em are what I'd call a full on furry tho)
---
Pictured: Leatherface casually building up his BBQ stacks, just before Nea uses Balanced Landing for a surprise flashlight save.
---
I’m rank 12, but no he didn’t down me at all. He did hit me 3 times but I got downed at the end bcus of noed and I died 
---
Imagine how entitled you must be to complain about playing with "strangers" in an entirely multiplayer game. 
---
With all of these "free escape or second chance" perks or whatever you wanna call em. I can see why one would run NOED. If you lose chases that shouldve been won otherwise then I cant see why people would keep complaining.
---
(No hate, just thought this was funny.)
---
Victim complex. For a game about brutally murdering people, we got a hella sensitive community.
---
lol "bug" in quotation marks for 5-minute mending
---
found the Legion main
---
Me but with RuneScape
---
If everything you’ve said here is true you should have single pipped, are you sure you didn’t? 
---
I'm a furry but I like the art and literature section of the fandom and not so much  the other things like fursuits and such. 
---
I want that lol
---
I can assure you everything I said is true. It was a really good game for me, I was hoping to see a +1 but there was a fat 0
---
It's selfish to prioritize your enjoyment over everyone else's
---
Even worse, AFK'ing is actually a reportable offense, but chances are they didn't know that, so you should be fine OP.
---
I'd just chase them out next time and move on, so you don't have to be around them.
---
How on earth is trapper not hard mastery. Also spirit is intermediate to learn. Those are my 2 mains, so it’s where I have the best input. 
---
3 MAN SWF AND ME THE SOLO GUY. WENT IN TO SAVE ONE OF UR FRIEND, I GOT DOWNED AND U ALL ESCAPE WHILE LEAVING ME BEHIND. KILLER EVEN TOOK PITY ON ME AND DROP ME OFF AT THE DOOR.
---
Kinda pretentious but he's a decent dude. I liked his dark souls stuff
---
4 survivors escape, iri. 3 is gold, 2 silver, 1 bronze, 0 nothing. One of the (many) problems with the current shard system is it doesn't really judge what makes a good survivor. If you run the killer around and are the only one sacrificed, you were arguably more valuable than all the players who sat around pressing M1 for a while, yet right now you get jack and shit for it.
---
Some people have complained this means you don't get your shard rewards until the game is complete, but I frankly don't see that as a problem. It's not like you will be moving more than one rank in any direction anyways, so who really cares when in return you have more people sticking around on the hook simply to give more people a chance at escaping and less people farming each other. Plus this means that when the killer fails everyone is actually rewarded.
---
I would change other shards too, but this is probably my biggest gripe.
---
Hmm, maybe I’m mistaken then, honestly I haven’t had much trouble in the new system. 
---
I had a match where the survivors wasted literally every pallet on the map. After they wasted every pallet, in every chase I would think: "Where is your God now?"
---
I don't believe that was the case. I believe the issue was with the original writer of f13 and the current owners. The developers saw that as a good excuse to stop supporting the game and had nothing to do with them.
---
It’s been seriously affecting me... since I’m stuck at 12-13 I can get out against rank 14/15 killers that face camp me at the start which deranks me by 2
---
Is facecamping becoming a trend? Like at this point its literally every two games Ill get chased for a little "too long" and the killer just gives up and facecamps me. This is frustrating because Its stopping me from getting out of these ranks...
---
I've played 30+ games in rank 10 and I can't get out of it so I'm stuck with average killers ;(
---
Its so smooth it scares me
---
I’m a bubba main so seeing this saddens me but alas, what you say is true. My brethren know no kindness. 
---
When you're reaching your hand out to grab something but you're still having trouble deciding  wether or not you should get it.
---
Spooky. Myers spying on you from the distance is still one of the creepiest things in the game.
---
ones who run through pallets a lot r called greedy

---
I don’t think afking would matter in a situation like that though, if gates were up and the survivors were at them OP should be fine even if they did get reported. 
---
Mettle of man is gonna be in every single build here in about a week. Hardly any downside 
---
I love how survivors always complain about how killers DC and then immediately pull this bullshit, because it’s “not fun”. Like, we don’t like getting looped and slammed and Tbagged all the time yet here we are. The insane double standards man.
---
Honestly I was contemplating how a Time Stop Killer would work and that would probably result in a movement speed boost. The question is if that would be too similar to a Spirit, and if we'd end up reaching critical mass of Killers with "move fast" powers. (Nurse, Spirit, Hillbilly, Legion, ZA WARDO)
---
But is it really DIO if he doesn't throw knives at people?
---
Lol sweetie you're using third-party voice apps and demanding your opponent take that match, you're way more entitled than the player just looking for a balanced game without your voice boosts. Have you tried playing without your crutches yet? 
---
P3 is new? Hmmmm
---
Oh my mistake then, I thought there was only one shard category, I wouldn’t mind this system then tbh. 
---
Anyone else feel like it's a little weird that OP feels entitled to quickly receive content they saw from people data-mining the next month-or-so's scheduled content?
---
Honestly I have no idea considering when someone asked Dave Richard if the survivors or killers will ever talk he said “no...well not unless it’s super central to their character and story but other then that no.” Now all of a sudden ash talks, Jane says 1 thing from what I’ve heard and the plague has lines as well. I think every character from now forward will have voice lines but I’m doubtful about them going back and giving the old characters voice lines. I do wanna hear the bae Kate talk though, or sing.
---
That’s literally the most fucking retarded thing I’ve heard in a while
---
Could play a lot of survivor but pool pints into both sides. Honestly from the video you showed they can’t be all that experienced, they didn’t even bloodlust very well. 
---
You sound like such a retard. Third party voice apps? Pretty sure ps party chat comes with the system, you know with it being PS chat. Mong. Yeah, imagine actually wanting to talk with your friends while playing instead of sitting in silence? I guess you can't relate as you don't have any. Crutches? You've literally admitted you'll DC over and over until you find some solos. And you probably still lose.
---
Still a shit killer. Still a little bitch.
---
You know, I'd really hope not, but I was thinking the could pretty easily take a video and try to pass off that OP didn't move at all that match.
---
 I think the mods do check the match itself, or throw the ticket out, though.
---
Yeah like, good for this person if it's legit, but I don't think getting 4 iris as survivor is actually possible in a game.
---
Are we just not going to show my boy Leatherface any love here?
---
*cries in Bubba’s Chainsaw with Carburetor Tuning Guide and Award Winning Chili*
---
Would love to play like that
---
Ah no worries. Yeah I definitely don't want this to be the only meassured, I just think that even if you die every game if all three of your teammates consistently escape, that's indicative that you are actually contributing to the team a lot. I still want to reward people for their individual actions too.
---
Jane has voice lines? Any idea what causes her to speak?

Yeah that's true. Although in my opinion, if I was to be a survivor main and play killer on the side, I would rather spend bloodpoints equally between killers to unlock new perks rather than into 1 killer for the cosmetics
---
Someone please make this. I'd gladly buy.
---
Program the game to recognize the use of the quit game/DC button and only penalize those players.
---
Wow I did not know this. Thanks I appreciate it. 
---
Don't forget about the immersed claudette that just unhooked you, running borrowed time 3..😂 
---
You look genuinely terrified lol.
---
It's due to the fact the did't pay enough
---
(and DBD has a lot of money) 
---
I don’t use Spotify. But I can see from the thumbnail that you included Jonathan Young’s cover of Hero. That’s an awesome choice. 
---
True but if we're going with non slayers I'd definitely prefer pre witch willow or maybe even cordelia 
---
Just hit them.
---
I made a good idea on how he could work
---
Anyway the did Leather face who is just like Billy
---
And spirit is just if nurse and wraith had a child
---
Yeah, he mumbles in the lobby and then won't stop yelling in game.
---
I didn't encourage anything. I simply said it is unfun. Playing legion and expecting survivors not to DC isn't a very high IQ decision though.  Just saying 
---
"This content is not available"?
---
If you punish your players who aren't having fun by not letting them play, what do you think eventually happens to those players?
---
Probably for the best considering the title.
---
Yeah Im on my discord is: xLDE#7466 Im talking to someone right now but I might talk later
---
I mean it is a defense against getting hook farmed.  Hit, hit, hooked, hit, hooked, MoM trigger to potentially let you escape.
---
Honestly most of the complaining come from solo-survs, which as expected is the majority of the people here. Adding a totem counter to small game is something that I would really enjoy.
---
Also my original comment was a joke..........
---
Ash is perfect for this game.
---
It's a nod to the puppet doing something similar in the show haha.
---
As a clown main, I can’t say we know much about kindness either 
---
How could you know what they would have called it?
---
Only for someone else though.  Really really good to Borrowed Time hook save though someone who has MoM.
---
Well there are three hit downs now 
---
I've had this happen, and the same thing but with white. 
---
I can attest to that
---
You know, the fact  that it was pure coincidence makes it hilarious to me.
---
I mean, that scene is gratuitous and out of place (especially as the series got progressively more light hearted), but that still makes me laugh.
---
GAAAAAAAYYYY!
---
Happened to me the other day as Claudette :(
---
lol, I was too lazy to make this version, fairs fair.
---
Believe it or not I almost escaped like this lol
---
Facecamp and tunnel.
---
Most killers are awful players with no strategy and thoughts behind their actions and therefore resorted to caming snd tunneling as it is the easiest thing to do.
---
They put him in as a ploy to take our attention away from the eternal search times and cheeks matchmaking
---
I'm a really vocal poster and most of my opinions tend to lean killer, I'm RES-tagged and all my posts start at -1, lol it's all good dude 
---
Legion, run around hitting people.
---
i love people like yours and /u/lago17 smug attitude and general just being a cunts, can't wait to see you fucking crying in the near future because you can't games and lobby queues are too long because the people left who are willing to still play killer have just said fuck this. 
---
It CAN trigger in bad situations, the issue is that it triggers REGARDLESS of the situation. It's the same issue as old DS, people bring it saying "I need it cos killers do x, y or z" but it doesn't counter those, it counters killers playing normally in every game
---
Heroes of the storm has a great system. Instead of a ban they mark your account and when matchmaking for X amount of time afterwards you will only be matched with other Disco players.
---
FUCK LEATHERFACE AND THE DOCTOR SO MUCH
---
More blood for bloodweb! 
---
Awesome, I needed some new tunes for work tomorrow :).
---
Me but with runescape, gotta get them sharks.
---
At lvl 50 you have 53 perk tallies. You get a perk per lvl and you start with 3.
---
THIS ONE MADE ME LOL. U SERIOUS?!
---
Honestly if I'm going to take them to a hook and then I hear the hatch I just take them to the hatch.
---
Play whatever killer YOU think is fun, fuck everyone else lol. It's your shards/auric cells, do as you please.
---
MY FUCKING INTERNET IS BEING A SHIT HOLE TODAY AND I LOOK LIKE ONE OF THOSE SCUMBAG DC'ERS. FML.
---
Franklyn's demise Legion time.

Somebody's never played League of Legends

THEY DID IT FOR THE SAME REASON THEY MADE LEGION THE MOST BULLSHIT AND UNFAIR KILLER TOWARDS THE SURVIVORS. NO ONE KNOWS.

I want to say thats racist but I'm not sure how it is
---
(/s of course)
---
If you’re on pc try giving nurse a few more try’s, if your on PS4/Xbox try the spirit i think she’s pretty good and fun as you can just pop out of no where or down times just tap your ability stand still and people think it’s the clone and run in to you 
---
Ash literally got his own show because he’s so popular. You may not be a fan, but there’s no need to act like the character isn’t pretty widely beloved. 
---
Yes because we all know youtube of all places is the final arbiter of facts...
---
FOOKIN LASER SIGHTS

I don't even own legion...
---
MORI'S ARE THE WOOOOOORST
---
PLAGUE PWNED ME THE OTHER DAY WITH THIS
---
Today somebody got mad at me for camping the last gens because they where close to each other
---
There are 0 reasons why it would be racist lmao. It's not as if we're calling her the n word 🤨
---
Yeah make him talk in game so the Killer can hear him inside the locker lol. 
---
Nice original post. 
---
Only 50%? Those numbers are for rookies!  But in all seriousness yea you pallet loop you get camped in most cases but it’s really all a survivor can do 
---
nice original salt.
---
Someone else mentioned this on a different thread a long time ago, but a "Stylish Death" bonus for being Mori'd could help disincentivize disconnecting if the killer brought a Mori. Could go to Bold or ironically enough survival since Survival point gain is only really self-heals and escaping the trial. Doesn't have to be alot of points, and could "compensate" for being taken out of the match early. 
---
first time it’s happened to me. there’s overused memes on here but you decide to comment on this? how original.
---
Is this for Demise of the Unfaithful?
---
Yeah you have it in the top tier, I don't get his comment either
---
Oh sorry about that! Righty oh Chum! 
---
The hardest part about getting the "kill 4 survivors in one match" trophy is getting a game without a disconnect
---
They're listening to killers a tad too much, but yeah. Balance is mostly good
---
I would die to have them go back and get Freddy some lines. Maybe just a few classic quotes that randomly play during his mori. Even though DBD Freddy is remake Freddy I would main Freddy using exclusively moris to hear him scream “welcome to prime time bitch” even though that’s not really fitting for the situation lol. 
---
A prequel quote on the dbd subreddit? 
---
He can't do that, shoot him or something!! 
---
Unrelated but I can't help but read RBT as random breath test, no matter how much time I spend on this sub
---
I always have to do a double take 
---
I use Lithe, Prove Thyself, Bond, and Spine Chill/Head On/WGLF
---
I always wonder what squadette traumatized you people. My SWF literally just farms each other aiming to die as soon as possible, usually awarding the killer an easy 50k in like 2 minutes lol. 
---
MoM is trash. The most used killers bypass entirely. 
---
I play legion main as my main farmer and the meme that everyone insta-DCs when they see deep wounds is a total lie lol. It takes Frank's &amp; a hidden offerings to do the job but never just vanilla legion. 
---
Shitty quality, rip
---
It really depends on how you like to play. I have almost 200 hours and I find nurse pretty easy to play, even though I have barely played her. You really just have to remember how much you have to hold in the blink in correlation to how far you travel.
---
While Billy and Huntress are easier to pick up and play, they have limitations on what they can do. Maps with a lot of obstacles and walls can neuter their powers and they can still be looped just like any others.
---
Nurse is in a whole other league. Too many walls? Doesn't matter. Good jungle gyms? Doesn't matter. Got pallets, windows, drop off? Doesn't matter. While she is harder to learn, once you do the survivors don't stand a chance.
---
I honestly didn’t find her too difficult to pick up either. I just felt like the other really good killers were much easier.
---
i have five as well if someone wants. 
---
Nurse's skill ceiling is much higher.
---
Somehow you missed the /s, so here it is: /s
---
(Maury Voice) The test determined that was a lie. 
---
Seriously. I've suffered long waits as solo survivor soooo bad. Just now I've waited upwards of 5 minutes to get into a lobby only for the killer to dodge before the game starts. 
---
The game is obnoxious on PS4 right now.
---
Change the title to
---
"please watch my horrible stream" 
---
Game is definitely less enjoyable as of late.
---
Killers that dont have insta-downs or zoning tools get looped forever. Survivors as of this patch have too many survivability tools, constant never ending survivor flame/dcing when they lose.  The general time to kill right now feels super long, like I'll start a chase and by the time I get them down 3/5 of the generators are done.  Not exactly cultivating of a good experience.
---
I get angsty at killers because I'm new to the game. But I don't give them shit for it because I know it's on me to git gud.
---
Damn now i wonder if someone has spotted me while playing DBD, send me a screenshot if you see Alfr2000 on ps4
---
Yeah as if this community wasn't toxic enough. GTFO
---
Someone msged me saying i was a Vag of the highest order
---
Ain't even that bad 
---
WHY THE FUCK DOES NOONE BODYBLOCK FOR ME AFTER I'VE BEEN SLUGGED FOR THIRTY SECONDS AND AM RUNNING FLIP-FLOP. 
---
THEY ALWAYS BODYBLOCK WHEN I WAS DOWNED AND IMMEDIATELY PICKED UP A FEW FEET FROM A HOOK, WHERE IT WON'T EVEN FUCKING MATTER.
---
FUCK LAG SWITCHERS TOO, I REFUSE TO BELIEVE IT'S THEIR INTERNET WHEN THE LOBBY HAD CONSISTENT AND PERFECT PING AND IT ONLY CONVENIENTLY SHITS ITSELF IN A CHASE.
---
And what if you want to play a killer that doesn't have a gap closer like hag, plague, freddy, trapper, and wraith are you just suppose to get looped forever?
---
The aura reading outside of 16 meters is a pretty big downside. 
---
💀
---
Killers get amazing perks: Survivors--That sucks but whatever
---
Survivors get an amazing perk: Killers - Oh my GoD WtF DeVs?!?!!!! oP, NeRf NeEdeD!!! 
---
He's just staring at me, menacingly!!
---
I noticed that if I don't hit survivors they won't dc... Probably 90% of survivors I down in first 60 seconds of game leave when I'm about to pick them up.
---
But yeah, there's a lot of random dc's going on.
---
This ^
---
OP, Nurse just seems to have no downsides to her. Her learning curve is a nuisance, but once you get good with her there's really only one way to counter play her and that's by predicting how far she'll dash. And, even that, can be extremely tough as top Nurse players can easily throw you off your timing by dashing in at weird moments.

The Killer downed me a second time after moriing someone else and holy shit it was the biggest relief of my entire life when he picked me up to hook me.
---
My greatest thanks to the [P3 Dwight who sacrificed himself to save me from the basement so I could do my daily.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1702661520) You're the true hero my dude ;-;
---
(Facepalm) 
---
Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against every good loop in the game. They're kinda the only thing survivors really have to distract the killer. I just hate the shop loop because it takes next to no effort or skill to waste a few minutes without even dropping the pallet. a few more if they get hit instead of dropping the pallet. a few more if they dead hard after that instead of dropping the pallet and then a few more if they finally drop it. then they FINALLY move on to the next loop. I think the double window plus a pallet is a little overkill, it should only have one window.
---
This community is full of bullied Killer mains though so she's an evil toxic Survivor main.
---
Random dude but I like playing legion though. Than gets so many downvotes it has more down votes than people on this sub
---
Had some take me to the hatch so I can look at it and then hooked me right next to it. Sadistic bastards
---
Something about this game is just worse though. Can't really put my finger on it but the constant angry tension all over this subreddit is like a big ol toxic radiation puddle.
---
You knew he was blocking you and being toxic.. why the heck would you corner yourself..
---
I think the same thing about Dwight’s hoodie every time I see it in the store
---
Yes. 2000 hours in, still play daily on xbox.  Don't plan on stopping anytime soon.
---
While doing gens at the start of a game we had a tier 3 Mike already chasing us, after completing two he hooked a survivor who was immediately rescued and then farmed twice, then it happened to me and a friend. Is this a common occurrence, and what’s the most appropriate way to go about getting these players banned?
---
Agreed! Glad you like the idea.
---
Ash is not a smart man haha 
---
I can confirm, used to play dbd on an xbox one and everytime i would throw a hatchet(Huntress) or go into T3(Myers) i would always lose fps alot and other things to cause my fps tp drop, since i got a xbox one x, ive never had any issues with fps 
---
Has nothing to do with the devs or money, it’s about the director and writer of the original film arguing over rights
---
Yea, there’s a loop on Michael Myers map where it’s almost impossible for the killer to hit you, it’s 2 long fences that make a corner and it has 2 windows but I use it a lot as a survivor because it’s just to good and when I play killer I kind of get annoyed because of that spot lol
---
of course, it just feels strange that that's the only option. It doesn't make much sense to me that there's a loop that strong to begin with. there should definitely be places where (with skill) a survivor can waste a bunch of time, but there's no reason to have the central point of a map a loop so strong that a survivor can delay for 5 minutes with next to no skill. It wouldn't be AS bad if it was in the corner or somewhere out of the way but it's the center of the map and has a gen in it so survivors are ENCOURAGED to go there and it's pretty easy to lead the chase to there. 
---
lmao, when I go for unhook, the moment I arrive they kill themselves.
---
You named whispers and spies, which, don't show you auras...
---
If you enjoy having no counter play then sure he's fun.  Do you like playing single player AI bots?
---
I mean I wasn’t thinking I usual hide in that one spot when a killer is trying to find me but I was also checking for a totem. I thought it was also big enough where he couldn’t block me guess I was wrong 
---
She has no counterplay and ignores every tool the survivors have.
---
Also she's not that hard
---
I always thought that since The Entity exists out of time it can pull from any time. That way all killers and survivors are added in the exact order they are canonically even if their times are different. That would make Ash the newest for us and the trials in general. That would also explain why perks change shortly after release, that could then be explained in the lore as The Entity tweaking the changes it had made to better balance hope against Its being fed. There is direct evidence in the lore that The Entity tweaks their abilities to better suit Its purpose (read Freddy's description in-game).
---
Legion is evil! hand stabby
---
I'VE HEARD SOME PEOPLE IN THE PAST SAY THAT NOTHING THATS IN THE GAME AS FAR AS PERKS, ADD-ONS, OR ITEMS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TOXIC AND FOR THE MOST PART I AGREE BUT WHAT THE FUCK WERE THE DEVS ACTUALLY EXPECTING TO HAPPEN WITH DYING LIGHT? ESPECIALLY WITH DS BEING FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED YOU ARE JUST PUNISHED FOR EXISTING BECAUSE REALLY THE ONLY WAY TO GET OPTIMAL USE OUT OF THAT PERK IS TO TUNNEL THE OBSESSION OFF PERK. WHY IS THERE A PERK IN THIS GAME THAT ACTIVELY ENCOURAGES TUNNELING? SEEMS REALLY UNHEALTHY IMO.
---
I will assume they have some basic knowledge of juking, and at least tried to do so. But if someone is a good Nurse, then they’re bound to predict good and bad jukes
---
do you not think it's problematic that loops exist where the only choice is to drop the chase? 
---
It would make sense, especially after the new emblem system was implemented. It gets harder to go up if matches go too fast, or if they don’t do a bit of everything 
---
Weird, DS is still in the game for me.
---
Ok I think I'm convinced. I'm gonna buy it. 
---
It's pretty good on xbox one, I have no complaints. The community is no more toxic than it is on PC
---
Any killer except plague doctor or legion
---
And I can’t consider that to be a mindgame. Mindgames should take skill imo and I feel that there is little if any skill involved in many of spirits, “mindgames.” 
---
Yes, the game is over, they should've left a long time ago 
---
Are people not allowed to have different opinions? Maybe they dont care for Ash's stoty
---
I MIGHT GET DOWNVOTED FOR THIS BUT WHEN A SURVIVOR TEABAGS ME I TUNNEL HIM AND FACE CAMP HIM, BUT ONLY HIM.
---
I do agree with you. I feel so bad when survivors d/c on a killer. 
---
Lol. Nice. 
---
Michael because he can actually scare the crap out of me lol
---
Addiction can be linked to mental disorders like depression, but on its own it's not a disorder. And game-addicts more often than not don't seem to actually be addicted, just have nothing better to do with their time.
---
Or, hear me out, legion is perfect the way he/she is. 
---
As a survivor the game is supposed to be difficult... legion is currently the only killer who can actively put stress on the survivors really. 
---
She is also a reanimated chopped up corpse, so there might be a few other problems she has to deal with
---
Myers, his tier 3 actually scares the shit out of me, plus IMO he's the most balanced killer in the game. Plus he's fun to play as when I'm not going against him 
---
Welcome to the fog 
---
Why don't you like going against the Plague?
---
If you think Billy has "intermediate mastery" you're not in a position to talk about him.
---
Especially with Myers as "hard" holy shit this has to be a joke
---
Corn maps in general, while not broken imo, are very problematic because of the see through tiles everywhere.
---
However, Ormond, Iron Works, Temple of Purgation, Badham, and Torment Creek are. And the Disturbed Ward can spawn double safe pallets which is broken
---
Survs who just wait at pallets tilt me to hell as killer tbh
---
I mean maybe when he stuns? I don’t mean just to randomly talk....
---
Yea that sucks I would of been mad did you get vid proof?
---
Sometimes I do get messages from the killer to farm blood points 
---
Should have been wraith or freddie
---
When I play killer I low key understand why killers DC when they get rekt because the survivors love to not leave and stay for an extra ten minutes t bagging and looping.
---
It's like... fucking leave I already feel like shit 
---
On PC you can close the hatch at all times so why not
---
ghostface would be a better way to do the pretend to be a survivor than legion and it even works in ghostface's lore 
---
Damn, just finished levelling ace to get ace in the hole
---
I still think one of the scariest things is looking at a window, looking away, then looking back and Myers is staring at you through the window.
---
Puke lasts way too long on generators. 
---
Really?? For ps4 you can’t 
---
I heard devs took that out a long time ago because they didn’t like it 
---
Well you weren't specific.... 
---
Did you read the comments on the second post? It was a reaction to a comment from the first post. 
---
You think getting matched with a rank 8 killer at rank 10 is rediculous?
---
r/whoosh
---
This may be a shit post, but I would buy it
---
No
---
Not entirely sure how to get screen record on PS4, so no I didn’t. 
---
:/ yes I really want my survivor to say “SEE YOU ON THE FLIP FLOP” while sneaking past an insidious leather face
---
Change the backstory to Russell Crow after he dies in Gladiator and I think we're good!
---
when shes in her corrupt purge mode you gotta wait it out, going for a save while shes in that mode is a bad idea
---
If he's boring then stop complaining about him? Or just die and move to next match 
---

Great idea, +1!

I would love this

that's a confirmed bug. chill out
---
It's a confirmed bug. Relax
---
Most people would be surprised at this, But Im gonna say this first: I am REALLY bad, like really really bad. The max rank i've gotten should be 13 But because Im liw level, Nurse. Shes really fun to juke at that rank and most of them get mad and start to make weirder movements and i kive laughing at how bullyiable she is at a low rank!
---
Not a guy. 
---
Your SWF is pretty much the usual. Just friends playing together. But sometimes you get toxic motherfuckers who coordinate with the simple goal of making the killer as angry as possible. Those people are usually a Twitch streamer + their mongoloid friends, and those are the ones that show how broken SWF can be.
---
Like?
---
I do that with either my phone or Spotify.
---
Umm u cant but ok..
---
Do not play DbD, but I play League, and my possible explanation would be, after watching so many DbD streams:  
---
Poor sportsmanship in League is shitty, you get a 20 minute game of just dicks, but it eventually ends. And getting another game is a couple minutes. 
---
DbD can last longer if they are REAL dicks, and then getting another game? 10-20 minutes? Maybe longer? 
---
I'm on a crusaders to upvote you as much as possible. You have concise, logical arguments that people arguing from an emotional place (mah fun) just can't grasp. So they mass downvote you like children.
---
here's also another stupid method because Behavior games is weird.  
---
just click Auto Adjust, and unclick, boom. it's done. There's an odd effect when it loads the game it tried to have it near best graphics even if not using best graphics, one you click and unclick auto adjust, it actually adjusts. 
---
That didn’t answer my question at all but thanks. 
---
Literally adrenaline, mettle, decisive and deliverance works sooo damn good to annoy killer
---
Myers and Plague. They feel fairly balanced. 
---
I had someone trying to troll from the second our game started tonight. It was against the plague and this ash gets hit first so his reaction is to run and corner me knowing I'm trying to hide, so I get downed of course and he takes off. 
---
He heals comes back and teabags till I'm in stage 2 of the hook and runs. I was lucky my other teammates weren't trolls cause they got me, then I followed him the rest of the game and funny enough he went down 3 times before I even went down once more. 
---
The best part had to be after I had ran behind him for a bit just to follow him since he was trolling, was when I got him to finally allow me to heal him missed purposely and got him stuck where he was lol. I never bm but he totally deserved it.
---
Does the killer see you like this as well?
---
*plays nurse* NANI!
---
She looks at chase mechanics and looping... And just says "fuck that noise" and teleports up your ass. She used to have higher movement speed and three blinks base, so back in the day playing her was a no brainier. Even after the changes it still is. Winning as nurse is entirely dependent on your skill with her, and not survivor mistakes. So if you're good? You won't ever leave a trial with less than a 3k.
---
It is getting boring telling everyone its a bug - maybe they should stick it on the front page
---
Even speedwagon saw that one coming
---
Go away
---
Not sure. I checked and I only see no tags for shaming players. My Xbox tag is IM A Dirty Roo feel free to add me. 
---
Killer: Corrupt Intervention, Monitor and Abuse, Devour Hope, and Make Your Choice. If I'm not playing nurse, I tend to switch out MYC with Thanataphobia or Sloppy Butcher.
---
Survivor: Self Care, Mettle of Man, Dead Hard, and Distortion. Occaisionally switching out for Poised, Leader, Spine Chill, Autodidact, Breakdown or Calm Spirit depending on the game.
---
I think that somebody's selling these on etsy, but unfortunately it's without the dcs
---
I mean... If they get looped for 4 gens, I would too get atleast 1 kill
---
The exact same as you, huntress and nurse 
---
Don’t use gay ass crutch mettle of man perk then
---
LEATHERFACE WEAK AF ON HADDONFIELD MY WHORES. 
---
youdont need to "see" the totems to have them indicated in your map. You just need to be in a certain radius from their position. 
---
so clearly : Just run all over the map and then everyone can see every totems and gens when you activate your map.
---
You made a good point that you get sprint burst as you get unhooked, if I tought of that, I would probably have placed ot in the meta.
---
I don't watch no0b3, I just think balanced landing deserves to be meta from my experience
---
Does the game actually have that mechanic? Where you can bonus XP for playing both sides?
---
Yes
---
Oh ok no idea why some ppl are yelling it’s OP then. Thanks 
---
It’s definitely annoying but I would say not as bad as the old decisive strike
---
Whenever I see a 2000 in a username, I think "Wow, if that's when they were born then they are literally a fetus!" Then I remember that 2000 was 19 years ago.
---
Yeah bruh i turned 19 just a few minutes ago
---
I fuggin hope so man, maybe reports will actually mean something when that particular sun dawns, until then I have to stick to trolling reports that don't do a fucking thing
---
I would be so salty is this happened to me hahaa 
---
when i played killer on console a few times all the survivors would just dc and other times. I would dc it made killer unplayable but as survivor. I could play just fine but thankfully after the recent patch that fixed it. it rarely happens now.
---
You know damn well that I mean the old DS.
---
That made me laugh actually, I was doing a daily never used him before lol.  That’s some shit I would do in swf gg
---
BRUH SAME IVE BEEN DOING MY SPANISH OMFG
---
Nah that’s on them, if they 3 gen’d themselves trying to rush and you were smart enough to catch that and cover a select 3, then hooked someone in the proximity that’s completely fine. Sure if you wanted to be super generous you could have baited them to go for an unhook but that’s not necessary at all. I try and play as fair as humanly possible but even in the games I’m not killing people I find I have to go reeeally out of my way at times. You gotta draw a line somewhere. Usually it’s the obvious kids who do that kinda thing and I hate always having to point that out because it often means inevitable downvotes, but I’ve never ran into older players (18-20 is iffy sometimes but 20+ are usually keen) that act like that and blame the killer.
---
Love blasting metal/rock as a killer. For my main boys I have band maid or babymetal for spirit, bon Jovi for hillbilly and ice nine kills for legion specifically nature of the beast and my last buddy clown gets anything that has clown aesthetics to it because it's to funny
---
Stop tunnelling then
---
I'm very confused as to why he didn't just start swinging for the fences lol

You’re in the wrong here mate. Stop acting like... THAT.

---
&gt;Glad to see a DS buff; it sucks getting farmed by a killer and them not getting punished because of Enduring.
---
unfortunately the perk still sucks ass, it should guarantee an escape and it still wouldn't be that good 
---
Nah, i got rescued. It just took them forever to get to me
---
Ohhh I gotcha
---
AND THEY DON’T EVEN HAVE BORROWED TIME! 
---
I love the gameplay against the huntress, but sometimes the hitboxes/latency with hatchets makes it unenjoyable
---
If you make it up to how good you can dodge attacks its not that good period. But I see what you are saying and I agree. Yet nurse is a base attack killer and her hits should fill the perk up. Legion is clearly debatable
---
DS only worked once.
---
No you cant be banned
---
Ok but that only you only getting hit two times and you would get stunned. Don’t really see how this is like DS but fair enough 
---
Daddy Myers
---
Can you do a rule34? Thanks :*
---
You definitely did the right thing I think 
---
Because you are playing Dead by Daylight.
---
Ever hear about taking the high road?
---
\*groovy\*
---
\# WHEEEEZEE
---
Pallet camper:  a survivor who after being chased will stop at a pallet and wait for the killer to show up so they can drop the pallet.  Easily identifiable by the confused look they have after waiting for several seconds and instead of the killer showing up another survivor is downed.
---
Dwight:  as in being a dwight.  A survivor that quickly hops in a locker whenever they hear the terror radius, or whenever a survivor is downed.
---
It's fundamentally broken, there's no debate about it. All you can do with a lot of the killers is break chase. Problem is you'll notice that as soon as yoi get in range of a survivor they'll immediately dash there. Last time I played the game it was that map and they ran for it every single time.
---
With some killers there is no counterplay, nothing to do but bloodlust around it eventually. Apparantly that's fine....but pick Legion and watch them all disconnect and tell you how broken he is post game.
---
I'm not a Legion fan by any means but the double standards are astounding.
---
The game is in a horrible state and people are just pissed and the frustration is growing.
---
and? that supposed to be an achievement or something? i don't see Devour Hope with 5 stacks so it was at least something cool to share. 
---
Did you trace this directly
---
That cancels out with killers complaining about DS (pre-nerf, that is). 
---
Pig, Michael, Huntress, Legion, Doctor
---
Yeah it really hurts that a game-breaking bug like this is still here. This is the type of bug that would be fixed before anyone went home. But no, it's still here after a few patches... Disgustingly incompetent. 
---
I wouldnt compare it to bt. Its more like a technically shitty version of dead hard. It takes way more to use it and it has the downside of tge killer seing your aura, but is way easier to use because of how you can just not lounge at first or when you have a bad ping and dead hard doesnt trigger
---
Unless you start streaming it with title like "Exploting dbd1!1!!1!1!1! " Yoo should be fine
---
I’ve only had this happen once but it was with a Jake and a p3 MM he had a tombstone add on as well and I saw what was happening while he killed one of the other teammates 
---
The Jake essentially stalked the survivors and made as much noise as possible and when Mikey started chasing us the Jake would try and body block at every chance so he could grab and kill us. I definitely raged a bit after I was dead. 
---
Idk though coz strangely enough I’ve only seen it happen with Micheal killers has anyone had it with others? 
---
Both you and the survivors are lame but no not hostage taking just dumb
---
JUST played a game like this. I was like did they buff this motherfucker? It was taking soooo long to mend no one could do anything or could even save because we needed to finish mending. I almost DC'd. I was mending for so long that 2 people got chased, caught, hooked and then found me STILL mending from bbq then downed me.
---
If ur playing legion i cant blame them
---
Is there a clip for this? 
---
Yoshikage kira as the next killer confirmed
---
HAIL TO THE ONE
---
I made a video about this, its more of a meme vid tho. But u get the deal https://youtu.be/tT9X-oTj7es
---
Explain please
---
Everyone uses the dead hard example which given is pretty accurate, the only reason why I relate it to BT is because the killer has to activate it and not yourself. You can wait on someone to choke or use a dead hard but BT your forced to bail on the chase after or keep pushing them just like MoM. Plus your aura’s only visible if you heal to full and are at distance, which SoleSurv already counters, and unless you’ve been tunnelled early on MoM should mostly be used as an end game perk like Adrenaline. Personally I see it being extremely strong used correctly regardless if a seasoned nurse can counter it, but that’s just me.
---
Not sure what you're on about, but I used to watch her streams for a while. After realizing her toxic nature I stopped watching, only to find out she's been given rewards for her toxicity
---
do you see that op in their post literally aimed for it and is very proud? that's not smart, that's desperate for 4k. catching and hooking a person in the middle of these obviously mostly survivors' fault but op is bitching how they are salty as if it is not a normal reaction in a videogame where the punishment for your mistake was not a swift death of your character but boring camping and 3 genning aka time wasting. they have full right to be salty and to bitch just like op had full right to abuse the situation. 
---
That is the problem addressed in my edit. It is doubling down on the difference in power between killers.

People really out here recording their gameplay on their phones still 
---
MoM Perk stands for ?
---
There was still 3 gens left and it was in a 3v1 no less lol, that killer was such a fucking sore loser. He probably shouldn't play games in general.
---
I can't go a hole day on xbox without selfish team mates or asshole killers. It's a okay enough ratio that it hasn't ran me off though. 
---
I feel your pain, but playing killer has it's own set of problems. Like getting a 4 man SWF who all bring flashlights and taunt you every chance they get. 
---
The new rank system it terrible, and honestly don't worry about it. Rank doesn't mean a whole lot, and it's not like we get rewards for the ranks. Just try to enjoy the game man, and worry about ranks later when the emblem system isn't shit, and the game runs properly from time to time.
---
That's not a mindgame, but it does make a very slight difference in how fast they get back out of the basement. It's basically a "might as well" thing to do if you can, but really doesn't matter that much.
---
My logic is idiotic because you tried comparing a killer to a perk in the first place.
---
Make Your Choice is not meta and not useless, so it was either average or gimmick and I tought it fit the gimmick category better. And again, gimmick doesn't necessarily mean worse than average
---
I steal my internet connection from like a half a mile away from me, get steady 70 pings, and it’s rare this ever happens to me.. even when I find a killer with 500ping. I really wanna know where the heck you guys are finding these lobbies.
---
?
---
Any chance you got the snapchat filter one by itself?
---
It will eventually. 15 is a lot but you will find it soon I'm sure. 
---
"I can smell your desperation Killer."
---
Hey! don't disrespect my canadian stabby bois/gurls!
---
Hmmm yeah after looking at the ping indicator it does seem that is likely the case, could have been a failed lag switch though too. Either way I just wanted to show off the cool play with those two spins.
---
K
---
It’s random. It’ll eventually show up if you keep at it
---
I want to explore a canal too
---
As a killer, I would say hunting Jane is a lot easier because of her fucking fat booty 😍. It sticks out like a sore thumb. 
---
Oh, man—the game is super fun! Even better if you have friends to play with (or friends who already play!)
---
I didn’t know squat about the community when I joined and still am having a grand ole time playing.
---
Try it! It’ll take a while to learn but its not too hard once you figure out the controls. And with each death on a hook comes a lesson to be learned!
---
Them being a little boosted after those 360’s and hitting a switch is pretty likely seeing as it started just after that window incident, which then him accidentally booting himself is like 100%. Regardless it was an entertaining clip 👍.
---
What happened to the cancellation of the w?
---
Dbd is one of those games where you need to block communication or just expect some trash talk.  If you cant block them it would be harassment but you can so do so to stop the trash.
---
As for is what they did holding the game hostage?  It very blatantly is.  With the gates open and the killer in a position where they can not end the game by killing survivors it means they are left with two choices, disconnect or wait for the survivors to finish the game.  Maybe the survivors were too good for you,  maybe you didnt want to chase them out the gate.  But it is not the killers job to dance and beg survivors to leave.  
---
However, and this is important,  it is a killers job to make sure a survivor didnt troll another survivor and trap them in a glitched pallet.  But they get crows from that so if there are pauses in the notifications you are fine.
---
Do survivors need to exit instantly?  No, by all means loot a chest, break a totem, make sure both doors are open.  But 10 mins of open doors and  no killer means they had plenty of time and have been holding the game hostage for a while already.  Their objectives are done, record a video of it and report it.
---
I expect this survivor behavior will be a thing until they add a Pudge/Scorpion/cowboy killer that can creep up on the gates and hook/lasso a butt dancing survivor and pull them back in for a sacrifice.
---
Lol.  Now all I can think of is Outback Steakhouse.  Ummm yes sir can I order a Bloomin' Onion with a side of Toxic Cancer please?  We're extremely hungry sir can you please tunnel it directly to the table?  Thank you sir.  Oh to drink?  Uhhh Fosters I guess.
---
Oh don't worry I didn't mean to sound like teaching or anything, I just kinda wanted to vent abit about how BHVR handles their updates. I think the user shouldn't have to do anything for the update to work properly (ofcourse downloading it)
---
An example and comparison are different
---
q u a l i t y  c o n t e n t
---
Rage: Increases his movement speed while active (not running like legion, more like meyers speed) and can auto-break pallets that have been dropped as he charges through them. If he runs into a survivor the rage ends early and he grabs them automaticly.
---
It’s meant to be funny, my swf were German and trying to explain what happened to them was hard lmao 
---
What's a Wraith supposed to do? Hag? Pig? Freddy? Half the killers are fucked.
---
Damn I love all the RPDR x DBD crossovers on this sub.
---
I really like it! I hope to see more of your art 😊
---
What exactly leads you to assume that he blames the killer? It's just the usual post update error that claims you modified your gamefiles.
---
Well at that point you/they aren't ragequitting for getting downed first, but as soon as someone goes down and they "conveniently" lose connection, I'll make their night as miserable as the round they left me. Actual connection issues are one thing, not everyone can live around a stable internet connection, but deliberately leaving because you're too much of a baby is something else entirely and you can basically see it every single time it happens. Nobody "suddenly loses connection everytime they get downed". It's the rq/dc babies I have an issue with
---
So you want the game to be balanced around you potentially getting an immersed team ?
---
Sound like great game design lul.
---
Groovy
---
I would probably take Clown over Legion as you get bamboozle which can be a great perk for many killers, pop can be good on fast moving killers too. I am not sure on your reasoning for Legion as to me if something makes me miserable I don't want to do it to others but if you play Legion legit they can be fun although.   
---
Neither are that great and I would say the plague and spirit are more fun killers to pick up. Everyone will tell you different things so my advice is check out a streamer or some YT content of the killers your choosing as that will give you the best idea which would compliment your game play style and pique your interest most.   
---
They have a different group of people working on cosmetics though 
---
If they did this they have to get the Robert Englund skin to make it feel legit lol. 
---
You will be more than welcomed and a lot of people in the community can help you out. Do note that there has been an increase to bugs like infinite loading screen, so you may have to be a bit patient with the game from time to time. Now as for your other questions, you will get the hang of basic things fast, but i highly recommend watching streams and/or youtube videos for the side you want to learn more about. I recommend Hybridpanda to start off with, he is not a god by any chance but entertaining enough and  his videos don't contain anything too advanced in terms of strategies, also it helps that his sodium levels are low. On the toxicity part, you will meet people in the game and on this sub that are human scum, but don't let that paint a bad picture of the community, there are a lot more kind and helpful people buried under the vocal minorities that are more than happy to help you out.
---
The downside is that it’s killing the quality of the game for half the playerbase. I’m usually all for lobby dodging but it’s legitimately incredibly difficult to get a survivor game right now, even as a solo survivor.
---
Funny, that's exactly what survivor mains told us back then...
---
While defending Infinite loop, the old DS, old BNP.
---
You aren't defending this kind of childish  bullshits reassure me ? :}
---
Then enlighten me on how my idea was "the worst idea EVER" 
---
That... doesnt look like an intentional DC. Id say his connection timed out or something. 
---
Usually, the killer is standing still (going in the menu clicking exit blabla) but seeing him move and actually continue the chase *then* DC points to a connection error of sorts.
---
Might be weong tho, you never know but in my experience I wouldnt call this a “Sore Loser DC”
---
I didn’t mean to go into a locker but before he was vaulting the window to make the clown come and I like to be in chases so I helped then I heard a heartbeat and he was following me 
---
I can understand your point with the rage quitters. It is more the connection drops aren't internet based it seems to be almost like the game crashes. Have you not had the game disappear to be replaced with the blue screen that then says you can report the issue and after that your back at the dashboard? It happens randomly, I have had it happen mid chase, so I am trying not to think every DC is a scumbag lol. 
---
The mindgame is that youre both invisible, but the spirit has the advantage. That is the mindgame. If you think thats not enough, then youre obviously not good enough at spirit
---
"Stop tunelling huur duur"
---
Became the new "Just break the pallet"
---
Survivor mains never change.
---
Yeah, might have been a connextion drop but I thought it was a failed lag switch because of how he stopped after vaulting thr window.
---
If only I can get survivors like these in my lobbies 😩
---
I’LL NEVER STOP ASKING, WHY THE TEABAGGING? I’M JUST PLAYING KILLER BECAUSE ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND SURVIVOR ROUNDS, DONT BE AN ASS.
---
You know what I  mean so don't be pedantic. You fast vault into the locker and out creating 2 noise notifications and then do the same with the window creating 2 more. All of this right by another survivor who is just stood their so your clearly attempting to bring the killer to that location which is why it is all toxic. 
---
The game has a steep learning curve. However, learning is part of the initial fun I would say.
---
Overall the game is definitely worth the price. I have around 900 hours and no plans of stopping to play.
---
Unfortunately the community can be pretty toxic (mainly survivor vs. killer trashtalk after a game). However I don't engage in any potential toxic postgame debates since you might be arguing with a 10 year old and it isn't worth your time. There is no direct communication within a match so there is no trashtalking directly ingame.
---
Like I said Before I wanted to the killer to come he didn’t have to stay there he decided to follow me instead of leaving (I like being in chases)
---
I hope that doesn't change for you because it is really frustrating lmao. After Legion got introduced I had it happen often, once 3 times in the same gaming session so my feedback had gotten a little salty at that point haha. 
---
He's making a joke.
---
Well last thing I will say on this is judging from your attempt to twist my words and your attitude of wanting the killer their but you do it right by another survivor that you got what you deserved. To that Jake you will of come across toxic doing that as if you want to bring the killer right to them so they gave it you back. 
---
Am I the only one that prefers the rich blonde guy whit the red sweater that screams whit a funny face at the beginning of every Friday the 13th match as a survivor?
---
Ok let’s say I was being toxic the killer would come from me I didn’t game throw causing other survivors to die on hook etc vaulting a window doesn’t cause harm to anyone else, and if they think that then they can simply run away 
---
The shop loop is not actually so bad anymore. It used to be a lot worse because the back window could spawn open, now however, with only the front window being open, the distance the survivor makes on you with that vault versus the distance they need for a trip around the shop is not that favourable. You should regularly be able to catch up on the second loop, especially depending on how the survivor plays the small window. Entity blocker is a thing. A survivor should not be able to loop the shop for minutes if you do not play unoptimally and allow them to break chase or not to have to use the window on every loop. Just follow straight, work on your pathing, break the two pallets that spawn around the shop if you aren't close enough to force the survivor to have to play them. A variety of the killer abilities can be used to play around that loop without just having to follow straight. Bamboozle is also a thing, a perk designed to deal with just these kinds of tiles (and unfortunately also applying to not-so-"problematic" tiles).
---
To note: I do think long wall windows such as Ironworks are BS and should be reworked, by either removing them and replacing them with pallets, or adding more counterplay possibilities, such as mindgame-able shortcuts (think drop-downs in Asylum), or yet, coming up with new map mechanics, such as limited-use windows (i. e. windows that collapse once used X amount of times), or windows that turn into doorways once a certain gen or certain number of gens is done, etc.
---
Learning nurse I’ve had a surprising amount of encouragement from survivors, helping me learn to hit during a chase around obstacles and such. Was expecting them to take advantage of the baby nurse due to the hate she gets at higher ranks but no, nothing but gratitude to those people
---
Just a pity the more toxic ones are easier to notice and more obvious 
---
I figure anything during the Legion update was intentional haha, coping doesn't seem to be a strong suit of this community, but at least adaption comes with time. Basically all of my dc's when I'm a killer happen when I pick someone up or knock them down so I have a pretty narrow view of what dc means. To me it basically means the player sucks and shouldn't queue into a team based game if they're that weak in the mental and every game I play where it happens just reinforces that. Anytime I message anyone, asking if they dc'd naturally or need flaming, for the most part I get a 12 y/o response and have absolutely 0 respect for them. So idk man
---

Yes, I went vs a Billy who only lagged when carrying a survivor lol. He started lagging after someone did a flashlight save. Hmmm

---
Them hoit 360s bitches
---
its complete RNG which perks show up in you blood web but they can only show up if you have unlocked them as a teachable. So basically the more teachables you have unlocked the smaller chance you have of getting the 1 perk you want.
---
KNEEL TO THE CROWN
---
Well, you gave an example where you compared a killer with a perk. I hope you understand now.
---
She’s allready mid tier and her ability can be completely ignored yeah lets nerv it even more 
---
Yea i havent had a billy do it. But this plague couldnt catch me. I looped her for a good min or 2 straight. Seemed longer but she couldnt vomit on me. So she went to lag to get the upperhand. Lol. 
---
I like playing against her, I also think she is upper mid tier. You need to spread sickness really early tho to get the game going, otherwise you are in for a hard match.
---
It's a clear exploit and anyone knowingly equipping this on their loadout to create literally unwinnable games for their opponents with this exploit are scum.
---
No I gave an example how one 
---
...but you didn't even explain the joke, all you did was explain what the perks do which most of us already know here....
---
Really no reason in talking to you since you have no higher than a 4th grade level education
---
I dont think you know what "OC" means...
---
Unfortunately, you consider Legion cancer and have rendered your opinion moot.
---
Thanks for actually giving an appropriate answer instead of just down voting with no reasoning.
---
Survivors: Does anything
---
Killer:
---
RNG, homie.
---
I play pig and it happens from time to time. Unfortunately you never see anything cool, the person just dies off screen somewhere. I have yet to actually see it happen, but a few peoples heads have indeed been blown...
---
"BuT FaCe CaMpInG Is A lEgIt StRat."
---
If the way you play results in losing progress, that's not the way it was suppose to be done. The wouldn't have a progress system otherwise. 
---
Now I won't tell you how to play but don't come at me with dumb ass rational like that because not only are you provably wrong. You're just trying to make yourself feel better, which I have no reason to care about, tell it to your mother if she's even still talking to you. 
---
"What if you can't find any survivors"
---
Sucks to suck, I guess?
---
It'd be hard to prove the person is intentionally exploiting the bug. So i'd say bans for this aren't going to happen.
---
Always been there. They are rarely open though.
---
I legit had a game yesterday on Haddonfield where the Pig bodyblocked the stairs to the last Jigsaw box and watched me die. It was...tragic.
---
"We need to build a wall"
---
LOL no other game lacks the "leave game" button...You can't take that away, no matter how many people leave. The real answer is to add incentives to getting pips, rewards or something.
---
No.
---
Climbing the ranks is way too difficult, especially for Survivors, meaning inexperienced players are going up against very experienced ones.
---
As for Killers, the new perk Mettle of Man is shortly going to ruin the whole experience. I'd wait until the 30th, when the mid-chapter patch *might* come out.   
---
Same here EU. I cant get into games at all. Been looking for some official info. Also I dont see any ping figures..
---
Completly valid opinion.
---
I think it kinda fits the lore and as it's a human killer it should be a thing to vault or do something survivors can do atleast to compensate the background. Based on the perks it's about intuition how survivors would react and where are they (coop at gens or hiding in lockers because they're scared) 
---
But as stated before the execution of the killer is poor .. sadly. Maybe a rework could save them. But this won't happen in the next year I'm afraid :/ 
---
This is cute, you landed your first dead hard and shared it with Reddit. Grats! Many more to come!
---
IT RUNS PRETTY BADLY ON PS4, I AGREE. PLAYING KILLER IS LIKE TRYING TO HIT SMUDGES.
---
The one with the flashlight is the evil one cause flashlights are evil things
---
The title is really depressing 
---
&gt;  every time I try to chainsaw a survivor up close they spin circles around me and I go zooming into a wall,
---
Learn to rev the chainsaw at 85% and only release after they have done a few circles and tired themselves out lol...works like a charm.
---
THOSE EW PLAYERS WON’T GET PAST HIGH RANKS IF THEY CAN’T GET ALTRUISM POINTS OR ARE FACECAMPED EVERY ROUND.

if its vs meta using SWF or just a crap map vs good surivors as a lower teir killer I don't blame them for only getting one kill, and the new perk fucks all killers barring the top teirs.
---
"Thanks for MoM, devs.
---
I was quite sick of all the Wraiths, Trappers, Doctors, Freddys, Pigs, Hags, and, Spirits at high ranks.
---
Maybe I'll finally get a chance to play against some Hillbilly and Nurse."
---
Did you keep this picture on purpose to release it for your cake day? ;)
---
Well....lots of killers get looped, windows and pallets are the safe zone for survivors. Nurse says fuck that and just flies through. The only thing you have is mind games.  Yup other killers easier but Nurse is still number one lol she's been that since she got released mwhahahaha
---
I’m not gay
---
Killer main here, I switch often. I think  most of them are fun. When Legion came out though, I played Legion ad NOBODY else, I had such a good time, didn't think I'd leave my favorite Billy in the corner for weeks
---
It's an obsession perk, so it's exactly as visible as DS was.
---
LOL haha yeah that does sound wrong
---
Aka, you can't struggle(wiggle)
---
The delicious salt is totally worth losing a match to watch someone die on a hook sometimes. If it’s an obnoxious four man squad, sometimes I’ll camp the first person just for shits and giggles- they really don’t like getting “All I wanted was to watch you die.” as a response to their post match nonsense.
---
Yes, I know. Though I must remind you to not get triggered by people off the internet and remember that to a point all shitposts are rooted in truth, including this one
---
Lol a bad day at work for Legion. Mine needs their perks back. Then I'll see if it's bad for me as well, the dc :c
---
Why do people hate him?
---
I would have cracked up if it was just a screenshot of you hovering over the killer in game, making it say 'Hard, Intermediate, Easy' 
---
Doesn't know how it is possible
---
Proceeds to write down the answer
---
Aweome!
---
So if I compare this to Tyde Time’s rankings then it nerfs top tier killers and balances them?
---
It blew my mind when I found out MoM didn't proc on nurse blink-hits. Such awful execution of the perk, it's useless against the BEST KILLERS and has a 100% chance of procing against the weaker killers in this game. So sad.
---
I PLAYED VS MIXTAPE LEGION AND IT WAS 3 MAN AND 1 DC'D AND WE GOT OUR ASSES SLASHED TO PIECES BUT I WANTED TO BE NICE SO I SAID "GG" AND THE LEGION SAID "GG EZ NOOBS"
---
THEN IT WAS A 3 IRI DOCTOR GAMES IN A ROW AND A HUNTRESS CAMPING AND SLUGGUNG IN 3 V 1 WITH DC. 
---
Due to the wording of the title the list is in reverse
---
Smooth hair is way more unrealistic smh my smh 
---
The point of this tierlist is to show how baddly MoM affects killers that didn't need a counter while making already strong killers stronger in the meta.
---
S-tier: these killers can either completely ignore the perk or take massive advantage of the aura reading. I know perk is currently bugged against nurse, but even still she can use the aura to a great effect.
---
A-tier: these killers can sometimes ignore the perk, but not quite as consistently as  s-tier
---
B-tier: can situationally counter the perk or delay it. Or again, take an advantage of the aura
---
C: have no real way to counter or delay the perk, BUT can power through it sometimes
---
D:  No counter whatsoever, just have to eat it and hope the survivor can't use it to great effect
---
I love your Megerino outfit. 
---
Yea. I didn't think the title through... too late now. There are explanations in my comment
---
-Learning curve is quite small but hard to figure out on your own, I recommend streamers as a learning source, though avoid thinking of anyone as an absolute definitive source of info, everyone has their own opinions
---
-Decently high skillcap
---
-Most of the community is nice, but like any game it has its share of legitimate sociopaths
---
-also as a bonus tip avoid balance discussions until you're actually good at the game, a lot of people do the mistake and as a result often start to pin their fuckups to balance.
---
Yeah, I agree. It really does
---
As a trapper main my feet hurt from walking into traps
---
Sounds like someone is bad at mindgames
---
Ash’s perks are just problem solvers for situations that may never happen. Buckle Up is just useless. Flip Flop is just another anti slug which begs the question why do we have like four anti slug perks now but only one perk that even interacts with the slug in question? 
---
MoM is probably going to be very annoyingly powerful. 
---
Jane fits the same category. Niche perks and gimmicks. Except Jane doesn’t have a “Mettle Of Man” perk. Solidarity is her best perk imo but I wouldn’t put all three in any priority over hers. 
---
I count 1 one thousand all the way to 14. If I get to 14 they are probably wiggling off, so I have a way to kinda know.
---
Because
---
No, I just looked at the image in my laptop and drew it, along with looking at in game references 
---
😂 What would you like to see? 
---
Killers sounding salty as always.
---
I meant explain the joke, not the perks
---
thanks dude :)
---
Is there a question here or are you just trying to be downvoted for Legion?
---
*Nurse intesifies*
---
I just played a game, didn’t camp, didn’t tunnel, and didn’t think I was using anything OP. Would this be considered cancerous?
---
I wouldn't say so. People just like being butt hurt over Legion
---
I love pallet campers. Get 1000 points, I’m collecting way more in the long run. 
---
As long as you don’t run purple add ons I believe it’s ok.
---
KILLERS KIND OF HAVE TO BECAUSE OF THE NEW RANKING SYSTEM, I'M SORRY BUT BLAME THE DEVS
---
Not all of us are toxic. Just like not l killers are toxic. And i still think both should have taunts. Geez this sub really is a "them vs us"
---
100: ma-male
---
That’s what I tried to get the person to understand that there isn’t a whole lot wrong with base Legion. It was like he read a Legion hate post, without seeing what it was people hated about him
---
Wasn't me, but I've been doing that kind of stuff lately. Apperantly i got a someone who copies my "playstile".
---
I call it "doing chores &amp; watching videos while deranking in DBD". Not everyone has fun in Red &amp; Purple ranks.

---
It’s a meme to hate them at this point or they just don’t understand his counter play which is his own fault I play legion also 
---
I actually don’t think it’s fun to play him the cancerous way. I think he’s outright one of the most fun killers in the game when played how he’s supposed to be played
---
Why were you so immersed at the beginning of the clip?
---
Dont listen to what people say. Play a character bc you like them or think they're cool. I'm p3 with legion and hes the most fun I've had with a killer 
---
Before I reached that area with the Gen, I heard Amanda's breath somewhere close, which is why I looked around for her and not went straight for the the Gen.
---
Legion isn't a killer though, he's a cheap piece of shite.
---
I was hyped for him before he even dropped, simply because I thought he had a cool design. The hate surrounding every Legion player by so many people astounds me
---
IT'S NOT WEDNESDAY AND RANKS DO NOTHING, YA NERD  
---
Okay, I have had teammates who do that all game with non stealth killers so I was slightly triggered seeing that until I saw Amanda lol
---
I also don't find it fun when survivors looks through the cracks in the farm map walls to completely eliminate the mind game so that they win every loop every time but they still do it every single time because it helps them win. What part of not having no chance to win the chase for killer is fun?
---
Believe me, I know exactly what you mean. 
---
I've had so many matches with survivors doing literally nothing but just crouching around the whole game and escape, while the others died.
---
SORRY WAS JUST LOOKING THROUGH THE THREAD AND DECIDED TO RESPOND TO YA. I KNOW RANKS DO NOTHING BUT FOR SOME PEOPLE THEY NEED THAT EGO BOOST
---
Suffering from Success
---
i end these loops easily. it doesn't take a lot of time anyway. i don't understand the complain. killers can bodyblock and all that. 
---
3 genning is just long and boring and desperate. 
---
I GET THAT; SOMETIMES YOU JUST WANT TO HAVE THE  BIGGEST E-PEEN ATEE AROUND. 
---
I have no problem with Legion. 
---
Just dont like playing against him.
---
Can someone explain me how to do this 360‘s properly? Is it just running in circles or am i missing something ? 
---
How did you do it?! There are together on my screen you sick bastard xdddd
---
I think you could have tried to dead hard that swing and get one more vault.
---
But yeah, really annoying.
---
Uninstall
---
Legion isn’t cancer as long as you don’t use cold dirt and I think it’s franklins mixtape or whatever the purple mixtape is called. Those perks make him op but other than that I could care less when I go against a legion. 
---
Or is it because some killers get gen rushed and have only hooked very few people camping when all the gens done is acceptable it’s all down to the survivors being greedy trying to save when they could have gotten out 
---
Can’t please everyone I guess.
---
If you only you had something to blow lol
---
Someone running the loop through the main building on most maps is long and boring to but if the opportunity shows itself to use that loop to waist the killers time should the survivor not take it because its not fun for the killer?
---
Franks Mixtape. Those two are damn strong. I play survivor with my friends pretty regularly, and we’ve gone against Legions who run both. I honestly don’t think it’s game breaking unless tunneling/moonwalking gets thrown in myself, but I understand people’s complaints with them 
---
it's fun to me. a chance to mindgame as killer
---
As long as you aren’t one of the people who DC at the sight of him, you’re good with me lol
---
Esc-&gt;leave match-&gt;leave match. Not my first rodeo.
---
Yes, getting matched with 3 rank 15 survivors vs a rank 2 killer while you're rank 7 is great matchmaking.
---
But yeah, queues are fast, but matchmaking is worse than ever.
---
Different killer
---
BECAUSE WE DONT DESERVE TO PIP, WE HAVENT BOUGHT EVERY COSMETIC YET 
---
You were both toxic.  You were trying to bm the killer by spamming noise notifications (directly next to another survivor) and they were toxic for body blocking you.  Clearly the bodyblock was toxic but don't feign innocence here lol.  You were being a little shit too.
---
Are you saying I should use a different killer?
---
Yeah the gen progress bar didn't pop up for me one game either so wasn't able to get any gens done. Also been getting games where I get stuck on wiggle state which sucks bc it makes me lag at times bc of it
---
Yes screw legion
---
Hard pass. Nothings wrong with base Legion. 
---
It’s more to secure that first safe unhooking then helping yourself. 
---
0.1% 
---
It’s important to understand the difference between possible and probable. Could KT be added to the game? Sure. It’s not going to happen though.
---
What is this, have we gone back to 2nd grade?
---
Yes, everyone knows it, that's my point. There's no way you know what they would call this game is that movie didn't exist. 
---
But Bubba take you to the basement anyway.
---
That's a perfect example of column 1
---
I love it so much I main spirt I got her to p3 so I love this and all I can think of is the spirt be looking cute.
---
The joke is that they disconnected.
---
Just because other games have it means this one has to? I don't buy it. 
---
But that's fine, keep it there. Just make it cost 10k bp to use it. 
---
I've had that happen to me as killer. Game crashes.. yep those people probably thought I rage quited.
---

---
Good build but I'll replace thana with whispers since he's a slow killer, it'll help with finding survivors fastly and not waste time looking around a area no one in.
---
T here are a few reasons tbf; one, the abuse of frank's mix tape and cold dirt (they're incredibly common on the occasions one would encounter a legion because otherwise he's a sub-par killer, while those two together are fundamentally broken) is one;. another would be that in a game that forces us to hold M1 for an eternity when playing as a survivor, we want something interesting; a new way to engage. Instead, we got a killer that sounded fun in premise, but instead forced us to multiply the amount of time in which we hold that damn button.
---
People hate that legion gets a free hit for the most part. And that they then have to take a minute to mend themselves. They just hate how he makes the game really slow. 
---
#JUSTICEDICKFORASH
---
When a IRL nice guy plays DbD.
---
She could take three hits she so THICC 
---
It’s not the killers fault that you got screwed on that vault.
---
It's balanced in the fact that it doesnt work for all killers, but it is very strong for M1 killers.
---
nobody is holding the game hostage, since you can just hit them out to end it or they can leave to end it.
---
I see the argument, don’t get me wrong. My point was that he just isn’t outright broken unless certain addons are thrown on. People can dislike playing him, I’m fine with that. The whole thing started over someone complaining about Legion being cancerous, when in my opinion he isn’t, unless those aforementioned addons are thrown into the equation. 
---
Make it client side only
---
play a lot
---
LMAO 💀
---
Hahaha this guy sent me some abuse recently, the icing on it was seeing he was in the furry group
---
I mean, if I dc I win, right?
---
Just kidding lol
---
Yeah, people have a hard time with empathy in competitive games, though. :( 
---
It's a perfectly fine dumpster fire filled with spaghetti code and poor design decisions!
---
Yes. Any killer can block pallets, windows, doorways.
---
Some killers such as Hag can use special add ons to block stuff with her traps.
---
While cloaked with wraith if you move in front of a survivor to block a pallet you can uncloak and hit them without them being able to pallet stun you.
---
Yeah, you can block windows and pallets. It can be tricky with pallets but it does work.
---
It’s not the killers fault that the survivors weren’t smart enough to see that coming or weren’t good enough to distract the killer and spread out their gens
---
There’s no such thing as a “toxic strategy” a strategy is a strategy. That’s like calling a chess player scummy for running the 4 move checkmate instead of calling out the other player who fell for it
---
On the show, the person who said this was referring to one of the queen’s who had a stroke and used it as an excuse constantly, and also was struggling at the challenge of that day.
---
and trapper's traps, and wraith's invis hits, and pigs dashes, and legions feral frenzies, and nurses hits, and spirits phase hits. So basically it's a Freddy and Clown counter
---
Sportsmanship has never been a strong trait amongst sweaty gamers.
---
Dr isn’t part of the base game unless you buy like the deluxe package or something I think
---
Balanced landing, Self care, Adrenaline, and mettle of man (Ash’s new park that is too good). 
---
Activate, yes. But it won't help it stack the necessary stacks it needs to activate. You need 3 hits, hatchets don't count as 1/3 hits.
---
i didn't say it's toxic. i didn't say it doesn't have place. i didn't say survivors are not to blame.
---
i said going for this strategy at start and relying on it overall is fukin boring and saying survivors are being little bitches calling op a camper is just so damn pathetic. 
---
Maybe you could give credit?

Thanataphobia hardly does enough, you’re better off with nurse’s calling or sloppy butcher
---
I play league every weekend with friends and it’s a lot less toxic than dbd.  As killer atleast, literally anything you do gets you hate in the post game. If you watch the hooks your a camper, but if you don’t and instead chase other people your a tunneler or whatever.
---
START REWARDING CONSOLE KILLERS! YOUR QUEUE TIMES ARE PATHETIC ON CONSOLE! YOU NEED MORE KILLERS ON CONSOLE!
---
i’m pretty sure PS4 automatically records your games, it’s just up to you to save them.
---
i might be wrong about that! you might have to turn it on in the settings, but you can also change how much is recorded.
---
you save videos by holding down the share button and selecting the relevant option, then you can go into your gallery and cut it down to the relevant parts. you can upload videos the same as you can upload screenshots.
---
survivors/killers working together isn’t particularly common but it does happen. lately there have been more survivors trying to sell others out than usual for some reason in my experience, but survivors straight up working their killer buddy all match is thankfully rare and, obviously, bannable.
---
I actually don’t care for Nurses on Legion, but have considered Sloppy 
---
it only works once, imo that makes it non OP for sure
---
Because baby killer is baby. Drop that survivor and feral frenzy some ass!
---
On a side note, I think killers should get instant downs if all 4 survivors are with 10m of the killer. Body block me now, biatch!
---
r/unexpectedsiege
---
I fucking love endgames like this 
---
&gt; Getting pissed about NOED for existing
---
Ok buuuuuudy :^)
---
I need to level Leatherface so I can legit run the Iron Grasp + Agitation + Mad Grit + Territorial Imperative build for the memes.
---
Tell me how you'd play around it except playing 3 killers that it's not good against (Billy, Nurse, Huntress).
---
How does a Wraith or Pig play around it?
---
Ive seen one in almost every game in the 12-10 rank area 
---
You’re a demon.. I exorcise this demonic energy!
---
Killers without an instadown have no way of playing around it, and it's effectively an extra life against them.
---
Been in rank 10 as I haven't played for a while since resets.
---
Haven't seen a single legion, ruin in only about half the matches.
---
It's been the most fun I've had in a while
---
Yup, I've ran into 2 killers before who had such dial up connection that it took about 2.5 seconds to complete an action like vaulting, absolutely ridiculous.
---
It’s whatever man. It sucks but it is what it is. You can’t get mad at the killer because the devs have a fucked up game. 
---
The other day a survivor looped the same window 5 times with the entity blocker up. I mean, sure I can get mad at the survivor for cheesing the window but at the same time whose fault is it really?
---
I do really hate when people DC. Even some of my friends do it, and they don’t care about rank so I’m always stuck 2v1 with a random a lot of games. I’m one of those people that love legion and they’re cosmetics but You’ll never really be able to express that anywhere without getting harsh words
---
Really bad play by that killer.
---
It was his own fault he got looped that long and the facecamping was just toxic.
---
(Also a killer main)
---
Fix the problem, not complain about people who are reacting to it.
---
Fix prayer beads (and other broken add ons) and you will get less DCs. They are bs to play against and I am not suprised at all people don't want to put up with them.
---
Plus it really feels like "hey, let me abuse this op thing, don't leave :C".
---
Being hooked and someone is crouching in a corner
---
Haha I thought it'll be project ozone 3
---
Nah Distressing, Unnerving, Ruin, Coulrophobia with a jigsaw piece makes for a good honest days farming. Made the mistake of prestiging when I had the funnest set up ever. 
---
I'll summarise it for ya:
---
"I'm a toxic little shit who should be banned, good luck having fun in my matches!"
---
except Freddy, until he put you to sleep
---
I once went away from a good, open hook as a lowly Freddy when the gens were powered because I thought I'd obey the imaginary survivor rules that game and walk away after every hook and be nice.
---
I chased Claudette out the gate, went back to the hook, he got unhooked on the way, I couldn't get him before they made it out. I got teabagged at the gate with a "gg ez" in chat. I didn't even use NOED that game (never used it).
---
No more Mr. Nice Krueger
---
i think Bloodlust level 75 might had played a part as well
---
Shhhhhhhhh, stop it. You’re making too much sense.
---
Well yeah but it attests to what I’m saying too. That even though this is ‘ungodly OP game ruined’ it’s still not comparable to addons like iri heads and omega blink nurse, instasaw and Fragrant Tuft/J. Myers. 
---
To the guy that rendered the P3 Ash?
---
They said nurse hits are a bug. So that basicaly means wraiths invis hits and spirits post hits are also a bug. Only counter MoM has is chainsaws, dashes, legion, and plague
---
Support the devs
---
I pity Bruce Campbell. If he ever came across this sub I’m not sure what his reaction would be.
---
3-person body blocking is toxic, since there's no defence against it. You can't change my mind.
---
If the squad are really being c***s, you can just tunnel the first person you hook each time they’re saved. Against co-ordinated teams I’ll admit that if it’s obvious only one of them is a good looper (There’s always one ‘distractor’) I’ll down them ASAP and tunnel them off hook. 
---
Did it a spirit two days ago. The whole team crumbles down once you take out that one guy, so the other three DCed as soon as I put the person on death hook
---
Is it toxic? Probably. It’s certainly somewhat unfair and I know that I can easily goto gens after hooking them but if the team is so reliant on one person I will absolutely punish them when they’re being cocky
---
They're full of shit dude, it's just 5 legionmains circlejerking each other with maybe 2 survivors in there who last longer vs legion than they would a real killer because that's just how bad they are and that's why they think legion is fine. I guarantee you right now you're gonna get some 70IQ answer that won't answer anything.
---
Eh, fair enough. I love horror movies, but I’ve never been that into TCM and therefore haven’t and probably won’t buy Leatherface (not even for bbq).
---
Pity?
---
I fucking idolize the egomaniac. He's top 10 in my celeb to do list.
---
You were kinda being a dick to the legion before they downed you though
---
wtf are you talking about nobody heals vs legion so both of those perks would be completely useless
---
And that’s why I pity the man. I can only imagine what his reaction would be if he ever saw the floodgates of Daddy Campbell open. 
---
Sorry what? How? I was body blocking hoping I could use borrowed time/
---
scp-076-2
---
i feel like he'd just end up being a legion clone
---
Hopefully he will embrace it and be flattered.
---
Do you pity carpenter or castle for the daddy michael stuff?
---
I wish that would have happened when i played against a freddy as ash. I wouldn't be a mega toxic survivor but i would farm bold points at least xD. But to be fair I'd stop doing gens unless they killed everyone already
---
Is that the Russian one?
---
Does the Hash Slinging Slasher count?
---
Wow, I think that’s a bit more then the situation called for. 
---
Mettle of man going to ruin the whole experience. Lmao
---
Didnt he die on hook in both games?
---
Castle strikes me as the kind of person who would laugh along with it. Carpenter would probably be less than pleased though. Jamie Lee Curtis would just be confused.
---
The sash wringing?
---
If they don’t heal, M&amp;A will let the OP get close enough to down survivors with the one hit before they run to far. Legion doesn’t only hit people with Feral Frenzy
---
Sloppy is just nice for encouraging the survivors to stay in injured state for easier downs
---
no its "able"
---
I've never gotten around to watching the show, but what's funny is the first film was so low budget, it's actually kind of a scary film. It's good too. But then the second and third are each comedies. They're not bad but it's just kinda different. Idk, to each his own.
---
What’s your point?
---
I can’t tell who this is aimed at
---
Shut up bitch you play legion your opinion isn't relevant anymore, 
---
I do really like the idea, but i can already see people going in as toxic as they can as the killer, throw in legion with mixtape and franklins or 5 blink nurse, and just fuck around with people until they DC. slug them to hell and whatnot.
---
It would certainly tone down the overall toxicity i believe, but it would breed a whole new generation of farmers that wouldn't be fun to face at all.
---
Leatherface, ez loop
---
Nerf DWM? It’s a joke ? Lol 
---
jane is over hyped in my opinion 
---
On this subreddit, it's very common to get downvoted for having an opinion. Same thing for asking a question here. :)
---
Someone really salted your crackers. My condolences 
---
Dude you literally ran at him? 
---
Not agreeing with the hive mind will get you a swift downvote 
---
I love how people seem to think Legion can only hit while in Frenzy.
---
Same! I got it yesterday tho.
---
All I was thinking through this as a killer main is why the Legion player not hit. Seriously, worst case-scenario, one gets off the shoulder but the rest are injured. This can lead to a down and possibly a win-win scenario.
---
i'd prefer they just be placed in time-outs(say 10-20-30 mins) with a 24-48-72 hrs ban coming after 6+ DC or whatever works best. This all starts after 2 maybe 3 DCs.  
---
Thank god the pallet vacuum is no longer a thing. Respecting Pallets was a legitimate strategy back then because if you disrespected you'd more often than not get smacked. 
---
Legion is awesome just add Franks mixtape and cold dirt and that build will be perfect. 
---
😂😂😂😂😂
---
Check my perks. I wanted to use borrowed time :/ 
---
Imagine being the exact person this meme is poking fun at.
---
"For Whom the Bell Tolls."
---
“With all 6 stones, I can simply snap my fingers, they would all cease to exist. I call that mercy”
---
Same, I think Ash is scarier than the killers
---
He got no air
---
Yeah so wait around the corner out of sight, even if he stays nearby you’ll still be able to get the save.
---
If you wanna play killer: sure, I recommend spirit she's braindead-mode easy and you'll be rank 1 in no time.
---
If you wanna play survivor: Legion is braindead cancermode that's been part of this game for 4 months now yet the developers don't really seem to give a shit, spirit is lame to go against, our best perk just got nerfed and made into some "anti-tunneling"-perk, just a few more years and you'll have a perk that stops cheaters from wallhacking but it'll also be kinda shit.
---
So yeah go play killer don't play survivor unless you are willing to go through 7 matches of swamp-ass before you get a decent match where you could still just get demolished but at least it's not a legion/camper/spirit/tunneler/ebony mori.
---
Yeah this happened to me on PC a couple of weeks ago.
---
Both the Killer and the Survivor had similar names and were from Poland. Same DBD Steam group as well.
---
Wasn't anything I or the other survivors could do about it. The farming survivor was running Bond, Empathy and We're Gonna Live Forever.
---
You don't. Unless you drop it before the killer DC's.
---
I think the reason they don’t do this is because of how unstable the connections can be, such as crashes and how they aren’t that uncommon, and how it’s hard to place the blame on a certain person for disconnects.
---
BUT that's just it.  It encourages the "Fuck it" attitude.  If someone is being a dick, and you don't want to give them your points, you literally park yourself and wait it out.  If you do nothing and refuse to DC, they get fewer points.  So it counters the assholery.
---
Like, imaging a 4 strong claud squad with flashlights.  Are they being toxic as hell?  Face a corner in the basement and let them leave.  No chase, no blinds, no unhooks...  Kind of forces you to play honorably to avoid it.
---
Got a doctor with lullaby, thrill, ruin, and devour on the hospital with madness out the ass?  Go afk, get your crows, what's he going to do?  He can't force you to play into his point grab.  He's be wasting the round as much as you would be.  
---
Everyone would leave with their own points and thoughts on playing more legitimately.
---
Ok. Doesnt give him an excuse to do that bs though lmao
---
No it's not, I can juke nurses, you're just bad at the game so u think it's the same thing because ur shit.
---
I didn't say that I planned to do 3 gen strategy in the beginning. They were gen rushing, and 3 gens were done in like 2\~3 mins, and I saw three gens really close to each other.
---
What else would you do? I mean, I do agree that planning 3 gen strategy before the game start is lame, but they literally did 3 gens on the same side of the map in 3 mins. 
---
I feel like it’d be an issue since Universal has been a dick about the rights to AoD. 
---
Uhh maybe at the guy who I replied to? #legionmainbrain
---
Funny, because I really used to main Wraith but stopped playing after some time.  
---
Some day I saw the new chapter and Legion, I've bought the DLC and started playing again till today.
---
I don’t have thick boi, is Fire Up viable?
---
True lmao wtf is this angry kid doing here
---
True.
---
Look at his comment history, he is toxic AF. 
---
So is this though 🤔
---
Dude my mouth is watering looking at all those blood points 
---
Same, it hurts when people argue we should be penalised for things out of our control. 
---
Obviously! 
---
It's right there in the daily: "Chase the Survivors for a total of 180 seconds WITH The Trapper," not AS The Trapper.
---
Clearly you helped him chase someone around the cow tree or something for 10 seconds. ^(/s)
---
Gotcha.  You do t ever play with MM?
---
Maybe all of you can stop being rude and be nice for once ok how about that...
---
Oh wow, very cool. I have not used her yet.
---
Is this a teachable perk?
---
Wraith was the first character I ever played but, as I just proved by playing him, you don't have the proper tools to stop anyone without teachables and you still get teabagged and treated like shit so why bother?
---
Yeah it’s like a fucking sewer 
---
I mean, nobody is stopping you from playing Legion. It's just a given that people are going to complain about it as it's not really fun to play against.
---
If you genuinely enjoy them then there is nothing gating you from doing so. Some things will always annoy people more than others, especially when they are unbalanced/tedious.
---
Either Flip-flop or mettle of man. 
---
It’s decent, but you need to have an entity blocking power on to stop the loopers.  Fire up should get you get closer to them faster.  What killer if you don’t mind me asking?
---
This made me play franks mixtape and cold dirt thank you
---
Man that guy’s a cunt. He has like a vendetta against killer mains, especially Legion players.
---
Ash Williams its the ultimate survivor outside of his movies the guy survived in the marvel zombies universe and fought Freddy and Jason in a comicbook crossover the guy its as badass as it gets.
---
His counter play? Gen rush doesn't really count.
---
Yeah, it’s getting rough. Playing both survivor and killer yesterday, I got a handful of full games, about half of my games where 1 survivor never loaded in, a good third of my games where someone rage quit, and 1 special game where I was THE ONLY survivor to load in. This is worse than it’s ever been.
---
I uh. Kinda hoped this was sarcasm and we were about to get woooosh'd 
---
That does not seem to be the case
---
I tried when I first got into the game, due to being a fan of the movies. Prestiged him once, and just came to the conclusion that I just don’t have a lot of fun with him. Out of the four licensed killers, my favorite is surprisingly Freddy
---
Your comment convinced me to look at his comment history, I feel cursed now. 
---
I actually meant ps4. I rarely get DC’s
---
Imagine being a legionmain and daring to admit it, "i'm gonna stop playing not because he's braindead unfun but because you bullied me into wehhhhh" fucking queer.
---
Yes. Please.
---
The sitting in the tall grass line is too great not to use.
---
I don't like Legion in his/her current state, but he/she has a lot of potential.
---
I didn't much get the legion hate but I played a game last night and my mend timer was taking literal minutes to complete. The Legion realized and just went from person to person stabbing and not hooking. Eventually we all died from how close together we were and how long it took to mend. The game lasted like a half hour I wanted to die so badly. 
---
But why am I getting progress when I played ash
---
Normal Legion without add-ons has a hard time downing &amp; winning games as he either has to chase a survivor with 110% movement speed or he frenzies them to death which wastes a lot of their time allowing your teammates to just do gens.
---
Generally, with Legion the best way to fight him is to;
---
- Maintain a good distance from him. 
---
- Loop him until he goes into frenzy
---
- If he hits you with frenzy &amp; still chases you then just run to a loop &amp; keep looping him. He has to decide whether to chase you with frenzy or chase you with 110% movement speed.
---
- Using frenzy to down a survivor wastes a lot of time at base. Dont use a pallet if he frenzies you on a loop as you will waste it. 
---
- If he chases you at 110% movement speed then loop him like a normal killer. Drop the pallet only if he is within normal lunging distance or your confident you can drop it if he does lunge to stun him. 
---
- Do not heal against Legion. It wastes time. Just do gens.
---
There is a reason why Legion is rated as a low tier killer in the game. Although his power is uncounterable, it doesn't really do much unless they tunnel you with it. 
---
His lack of map pressure &amp; killing potential means that it takes ages for Legion to down anyone. His slow movement speed hinders his map control meaning he usually relies on survivors healing to waste time to provide him with the chance to kill survivors.
---
BEING POSITIVE ON RAGE WEDNESDAY? THAT'S A MORI.
---
And pollute our For Glory servers? Yeah nah mate you're alright.
---
Oh boy the legionmain hoped everyone actually was his friend, oh jolly. Bitch how many hours of people have you  wasted playing fucking legion? If you think I should be nice to some douchebag who's okay with wasting everyones fucking time all day long htan you're sadly mistaken, bitch.
---
Your tears are delicious 
---
Yeah and you aren't the sole metric who gets to decide either, what is your point aside from stating the obvious???
---
What we can do is look at the evidence, which is a load of players complaining about player behavior from smurfs on all forums, and social media, as well as a significant amount of streamers who intentionally derank and bully players.
---
I've never had an issue myself with long queue times after reaching rank 1 as I'm used to queuing large amounts from other games in order to have balanced matches. Doesn't mean I deny it's a problem because I can recognize a problem from the aforementioned sources.
---
Like I said before, a major factor is the deceptiveness involved in smurfing. You aren't intentionally trying to start at rank 15. However IT IS undesirable for a rank 1 to be matched with genuine rank 15's, unfortunately because we cannot telepathically see a player's skill there needs to be some games which are unbalanced. I definitely would advocate for a placement system as they have in other games which have ranks. However I don't think this is a major problem at this stage of the game, new players are able to tolerate good players in some of their games, this is different from smurfing which also involves a bunch of other undesireable behaviour.
---
Sorry guys, I was so upset and tired last night, and wasn't able to explain the whole story.
---
I NEVER plan 3 gen strategy from the start. I do understand just camping those three gens and waiting for a chance to hook a surv in the middle hurts good gaming experience.
---
I played huntress, and 3 of the survivors had too boxes, two with brand new parts. In less than 3 mins, they get 3 gens done on the same side of the Spring Wood map. I think I hooked at least 3 times before I even hooked the survivor in the middle of 3 gens. Among the 5 gens left, one was in the killer shack, the other one in the basement right next to the killer shack. The attached three were around the playground area(Not sure what this area is called). It only took me 5 seconds to loop the three gens, and I hooked a guy who tbagged.  
---
GOD YES I did hooked that THICC in the middle of the three gens on purpose and I camped there.
---
I personally agree to niemniemnieeem that choosing which 3 gens to camp from the beginning of the game is lame, and boring. But I still don't understand why survivors expect killers to make the game easy for them all the time, and got to fire shits to the killer if the game doesn't end as they wanted.
---
Ugh your annoying 
---
Well at least I know I'm being laughed at by a braindead 0IQ legionplayer with no redeemable qualities, that helps.
---
pc or console? 
---
DECISIVE STRIKE SHOULD BE AT LEAST 120 SECONDS OR 2 MINS 60 SECONDS IS NOT ENOUGH TIME!!!!!!
---
Legion bad is the orange man bad 2.0
---
I didn't understand the "Meg looks like a man" jokes till now. 
---
Never knew that counted lol
---
Google it bitch, it's been 4 months, everyone with an ounce of respect in this community has decided legion is bad for the game and giving their reasoning for it 2000 fucking times, if you chose to ignore it and fail to have the brain capacity to figure it out for yourself, than I'm not about to waste time explaining some braindead dipshit like you for the 70th time why legion is for monkeys. 
---
Shit’s still wack, yo. Random, unexplained disconnects as survivor. 
---
I honestly can't tell, it's too quiet.
---
"it CAN counter hard core tunneling". Simple as that. 
---
No, I want you to explain it to me.
---
It's called playing the game and trying to survive
---
Just tell me I'm not completely insane about the "shitting in the bush" part...
---
&gt; I guarantee you right now you're gonna get some 70IQ answer that won't answer anything.
---
And thank god you were here to provide it.
---
But it's 3 parts.
---
I see evil Morty memes I upvote, I am a simple man.
---
Doctor, it should’ve been easier to stop em but I just suck :/
---
Don't know 
---
Well too fucking bad moron.
---
This is beyond fantastic.
---
You really need to get the fuck over whatever part of this game hurt you so badly.
---
That's what I fucking thought.
---
It does say "chase the survivors" and if i am the survivor am not the one chasing survivors. Thats what I have always thought
---
Very Conflicting Ideologies about it so I’m not going to use that term
---
He has a number of voice lines. It changes here and there, one about pissing in bushes, one I think says you gotta be kidding me, etc. 
---
Haha how else are survivors support to you know survive lol
---
Would you rather they ran in a straight line?
---
What would the power, perks, and lore be though?
---
Don't make excuses for shit behavior.
---
“You need not wander.  You cannot upgrade from perfection.”- Ace Visconti, the only main anyone could ever need.
---
Yeah, there are a hell of a lot more red rank killers than survivors.  I've seen one rank 3 survivor since the update (besides right at the beginning), a few rank 4, everyone else purple or green.
---
Man, Conan really changed after the gates to hell were opened.
---
"Look who's shitting in the tall grass" I believe.
---
Apparently a lot of adepts are broken right now. Unfortunately you'll have to do it again once a fix comes out
---
Now we just need Ash's animation 😂
---
They've absolutely fucked survivors with this system.
---
I've even seen killer mains on YT saying it's bullshit for survs.
---
Lol shut up n-word I hope you get matches vs legions in your next 100 games untill you uninstall.
---
Because pussies would rather insta DC than buy their team any measure of time whatsoever.
---
Bruh that really is a GG. Thanks for the heads up. I MIGHT consider doing this again
---
It’s not even a counter lol Precise blink is literally no different than any other killer using their ability and it not applying, with the exception being she’s a far harder killer to learn.
---
Lol not this moron again, get blocked son.
---
Once in a blue moon I’ll meet a cool Bubba. After playing for about 6 months, I have yet to meet a clown who isn’t at least a little toxic. So the first one I do will be getting a wholesome message from yours truly (if their messages aren’t blocked) because I will have found the diamond in the coal mine. 
---
Yeah I was just kidding lol
---
U thought something? Go tell your mom she'll be so excited her downy fucking braindead song can think stuff.
---
wish i could but i don't have a mic atm
---
loool
---
Its actually "Time to hide in the tall grass"
---
But I prefer yours :D
---
My point is i hate swf because it feels like cheating
---
If you are talking about 2 L walls that kind of make a square, there's not a lot you can do, bamboozle but mainly make sure you chase counter clockwise around the walls, it shortens the loop for them and if they don't play it right they get a medium/slow vault rather than a free easy fast vault
---
You have to buy the game to play it...
---
It's awful to play against, a lot of people value their own fun over other peoples' fun so they do it.
---
I'm not making up excuses, I'm explaining why it happens and how they should fix it. Fix the source of the problem.
---
Wooow I feel so dumb now...
---
I had a match against pig on the game and 75% of the map was a blinding white light where I couldn't see anything but my HUD and the rest were green, red, yellow walls. I probably see some sort of item with texture issues every other match or so, garbage on the ground is light blue, the trees are pink, etc. 
---
dont do that :(
---
His voice is insanely quite sometimes and hard to unterstand 
---
I hope when you're no longer able to use this sub you'll look back and wonder where you went wrong.
---
The Legion's Mori animation is one of the few things I like about him. 
---
Hey Bud, mods don't like you posting that here. You may wanna try your luck with the partner subreddit. Just go to community info.
---
I mean, i clearly fucking do, asshole.
---
You just want to complain for the sake of complaining. 
---
You have to double pip and 4k 
---
CAKE DAY IS THE DAY SOMEONE JOINED  REDDIT
---
FOR EXAMPLE MINE IS JUNE 10 2018 AND YOURS IS APRIL 3RD 2016
---
AND ON THAT DAY YOU USUALLY GET EZ UPVOTES BY PEOPLE THAT SEE ITS YOUR CAKE DAY
---
It's a 2 day old account with a very disgusting name, it was created to troll people. I feel bad for those who have so little joy in life they need to create negativity to feel better.
---
That's just it, hes sub-par but frustrating without them, and also broken with them. It's lose-lose.
---
As if Ash is a good character 
---
Sbeve
---
By all means go for it, just know that you're adding nothing of substance and you're just an annoyance to the people trying to use the same platform as you 
---
WHAT? PLAGUE IS FROM DBD.
---
Ah, PC it is specifically meant to be bad due to smaller playerbase tbf; I'm PC but also currently in Australia with a relatively small playerbase for obvious reasons, so idk.
---
I would agree with this, I've been harping on disabling bloodpoints for survivors that DC for 1/3/5 games. If the grind gets worse, people might think twice.
---
If you could mention him it'd keep you from stealing his work, seeing as (I assume?) you didn't render this (correct me if I'm wrong here lol)
---
We're hoping to get an Eastermoon bloodhunt again, but we haven't seen any datamines to suggest that it';; come with an event.
---
I’m a survivor main and that one burned my biscuit too. Especially the part about if it’s someone who “has it out for” them!? What does that even mean?? They’re the killer, you’re a survivor. Of COURSE they have it out for you! xD 
---
Probably a glitch. I had a chase ritual for the Plague pop up a few days ago that also claimed I had already done 10 seconds.
---
Bitch you don't even know why legion is bad for the game, you probably have less than 300 hours and here you're yapping away thinking you have more to add than me, anyone who plays legion or doesn't understand why legion is bad for the game is adding only retardation to this subreddit, all you do is join the morons and make them louder and get upvoted for it because you're part of them, you're actually more retarded every post you make thinking you add anything of substance with your braindead "explain this to me for the 17010383th time because I'm lazy and stupid".
---
Which sucks because adept survivors do NOT have to double pip. 
---
My gamer tag is lobotomizeslow
---
Me
---
I like pug because of all the different ways you can manipulate the game it her traps. Plus ambush is super fun. I  just find plague satisfying and fun. Idk why I like nurse so much but I do lol 
---
There is more than one Claudette skin? 
---
Another suggestion that would work is a 5 DC allowable limit per week, and a 24hr softban warning once they've reached their limit, followed by the actual softban with the possibility of escalation should they continue DC'ing over the limit. This allows room for DC'ing for reasons outside of the game, gives a buffer for those times when you are just having a bad day or experiencing a game breaking bug, and helps to change the mentality for DC'ing. The current issue is that people can DC whenever they want, for any reason, with no consequences, and so they are shamelessly DC'ing En Masse despite how shitty that is to the other players. Creating an allowable limit, and giving fair warning of consequences will dramatically decrease the amount of DC's, because despite how much people get frustrated with this game, they still want to play it. Any threat to players that they may lose the privilege to play due to their poor sportsmanship will have an effect on their mentality. 
---
However, If it also gave the victims of your DC your points, that would also be nice and make it feel less like they wasted their time getting into the match in the first place.
---
God I hope they don’t add any “creepy” pasta killers. 
---
I added you 😊
---
You know: Adrenaline can be avoided by not letting the survivors alive till end game, DS by not tunneling, BT by not camping and MoM and Instaheal are one time use. Flashlight are easy to avoid too
---
And people thought 4 man DS was bad.
---
Legion definitely has counterplay, unless it's one specific build, which I specifically mentioned in my original reply, you petulant child.
---
Personally I really love the Clown, primarily because I don’t see them often, I can make people scream with the bottles, and then do a dance all around them afterwards. He’s the one killer I purely just have fun with.
---
No I don’t think I you do, killer is not that hard, you. Just have to understand when to swing Nd mid game them.  Think like. Survivor when you are playing killer and you will 4k in no time.  Also word of advice if one guy is looking you hard and you are spending too much time on him leave him alone and do a gen patrol.  Separate the weak from the herd.
---
You have to double pip (he likely did because he said he got merciless), but you don't have to 4k unless on red ranks where it's required for double pipping. I got Adept Plague with one escaping through hatch (Gold Devout, everything else Iri).
---
"Legion is so cancerous you spend the entire game mending!"  
---
[&gt;Doctor be like](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CvuRP1CWcAAnfJm.jpg)
---
While I don't think Legion's core concept is bad I think the way Behavior executed it was very poor. In essence Legion is a discount Doctor since both character's powers are used to stall the game, but Legion has to try way harder with his power and can do way less with it when compared to Doctor.
---
I do think Legion's core concept of "run fast and stab shit" works but I think they need to have a use that's significantly different than Doctor. Weaking Survivors with Feral Frenzy and then finishing them off normally makes the most sense to me. I think if Deep Wounds worked similarly to Plague's infection (gradually grow weaker until you're finally left at a significantly weakened state) it would be a lot stronger. I don't think Deep Wounds should cause you to be broken but perhaps if it inflicted Hindered?
---
Wow you got me figured out. You really showed me. You're really sad and pathetic bud, I feel bad. Sorry Daddy touched your peepee.
---
Literally me IRL.
---
And DBD isn't a hard game in the first place so her "high skill" means literally nothing.
---
And yes, it's fucking different. Why do Freddy's Dream Chaser, Spirit's Grudge, Wraith's Suprise, Hag's Phantasm proc it but not Nurse's Blink-Strike? 
---
I haven't either, I just wanted to be able to play all killers and I've learned that LF is honestly really powerful without camping. Theres only a few killers I can't find myself having fun playing
---
I've gotten against 4 dead hard, 4 bt, and 4 adrenaline before. imagine if they all had MoM i'd be fucked if i didn't play Legion
---
The only counterplay to MoM is m2 Legion, Plag m2ing till you're broken, downing with chainsaw if you get really close, being good at hitting hatchets, survivors stepping in traps ??. If you play Doctor, Wraith, Hag, and all the other killers they'll get their MoM and you wasted your time on the chase.
---
Jokes on him I downvoted all of them.
---
I'm just so confused at what made you this full of hate for other people.  Not just the whole legion thing, which is in and of itself really dumb to get that mad at people playing a character you don't like in a game, but you're also obviously a raging fucking homophobe so I'm just lost as to what could've created a person like you
---
He’s talking about basic “infinite’s”. 
---
He said crotus, so he means the window in the atrium and the window by the stairs. 
---
THIS GAME IS SO BROKEN I NOW PREFER WHEN GAME BREAKING GLITCHES OCCUR BECAUSE I NO LONGER CARE ABOUT WINNING, ID RATHER SEE SOME FUNNY STUFF HAPPEN.
---
Also unless your survivors literally just bought the game you will never hit anything but blink-strikes, so it might as well be coded to say "Nurse can't stack this btw" (besides for the fact that it's a literal bug so you're double-wrong) 
---
I like pugs too with their squished lil noses
---
I like this
---
Alright no problem man I’ll take it down.  I appreciate the heads up. 👌🏻
---
I disagree; like all things in this game, it's situational.
---
Sometimes the Killer messes up, gets outplayed, or just tunnels one person the whole game. I can understand that being pitiful.
---
But there are also plenty of scenarios where the Killer has little to no agency in their own success or failure.
---
If you're playing Scratched Mirror Myers on Coldwind and you somehow hook someone as the final generator gets powered, I'm not sure what else you could do besides camp them or how anyone could judge you for it.
---
Spirit, Wraith, Freddy. I guess I just like being invisible. 
---
It's just a troll, they just get off on being douchebags because they have no friends and feel it's the world fault they're so annoying and unlikeable.
---
Sometimes I would joke around and say “oh hey its a mexican myers staring at us” and surprisingly there was a myers staring at me.
---
Thicc boys rise up!
---
It was just a joke that you got progress because you were chasing other Survivors as Ash with the Trapper.
---
Thanks bro, I’ve always had trouble with gen patrols, that’s why I got the Doc but I didn’t know if it was acceptable to leave a survivor in a chase
---
If it’s not a hard game then there’s no issue and it should be changed. Ez answer. Or you could just bait her to swing normally.... so there’s that. Dream doesn’t hurt people, his main attack afterwards does. Spirit shouldn’t apply to the perk when coming out of phase IMO and haven’t faced her yet so I don’t know if it does but in regards to her and Wraith.. It’s not like they come out of know were, you can hear/see them giving you ample time to get out of the way. Hags phantasm doesn’t hurt people... only her normal attack after she chooses to teleport does. All simple reasons tbh. 
---
Ash - Groovy
---
Love that 😂
---
Im going to lopped you if you keep talking about legion.
---
Oh shit I had no idea they were bugged. I remember playing against a legion and the mend was longer than previous ones I did in that match, I thought I was going crazy.
---
r/dbdgonewild 
---
Sorry, but you shouldn't get a counter to a killer just because you're not good enough
---
And no the drawback is not significant. All you have to do is 99 your health until the killer initiates a chase
---
I once completed a Spirit daily by leveling up Clown's bloodweb.
---
This game is buggy as heck; stuff like this is to be expected and not understood.
---
It's not the size of the player base though seeing as before they reverted the awesome new system we were getting accurate time wait time predictions and really quick queue times. Then they reverted it and we're all stuck in waiting room hell.
---
Yeah, but I'm more talking about stuff devs put in explicitly. Comms is 3rd party 
---
I heard a dev confirmed on zubatlel's stream that it's a bug that nurses attacks doesn't count.
---
It absolutely is not, but I know you're not acting in good faith here.
---
&gt;Your opinions immediately invalid when you act like a child
---
Yeah totally hard to figure something out that you admitted to 5 mins ago. People like you are why politicans lie and promise bullshit, because you don't care about facts or even have to agree with someone as long as they "act mature which obviously is to be superduperfriendly and respect everyones safespace", it's fucking embarassing that people like you have the right to vote.
---
Now that's hot 
---
Those are pretty much infinite loops, certain killers can still catch survivors there but sometimes the best course of action is to leave the survivor and try to catch someone else out of position. 
---
I can see that, but they should be able to tell when someone presses the "exit match" button. 
---
Most chili bois camp because he is the best at it, especially if it’s a basement hook.
---
Why are they trash? Maybe because they don’t know when to m1 or to use the saw, maybe because they only camp, or because they are an inexperienced killer.
---
Saltiest killer because you searched the basement chest probably.
---
All you’re doing is admitting my point that only higher skill players would use her, and as such all they need to do like I’ve already said in another post is just blink again and you’re down. I’m just stating the facts and people like you are clearly offended by an opinion and thinking I’m trying to be “correct” by stating it.
---
Ah, good! 
---
My friend, just leave the game immediately or disable chat. Life will be a lot easier that way. You’re doing just fine!
---
I dont dc as survivor but ive dcd as killer a few times when something urgent happens. Like when the gates are open and survivors want to play hide an seek while ive been holding back a coffee shit all game. Sorry guys, im not shitting my pants so you get your bloodpoints. Also, if the pizzas here, my games over.
---
He's one of only three killers to be labelled as "Easy" to play so newer people are drawn to him more.
---
As good as that sounds, it just means people would close the game remotely or end the connection to the internet so it can’t be seen lmao. People would go to lengths to DC if they do it a lot now.
---
I always use a headset no matter what. Stridor just lets me filter out my breathing cause Legion sounds like a survivor breathing sometimes and Stridor really brings out those subtle groans mixed in with the breathing. If you don’t like it or if Iron Will becomes more popular, just switch to Bloodhound/Predator. Bloodhound is preferred because luminous orange/red blood is noticeable on every single map. 
---
There's a glitch with Legion that stacks the blade add-ons onto your mend timer everytime you get hit. Using the filthy blade alone adds 5 seconds to your mend timer EVERY SINGLE TIME you get hit. I tested it in KYF and my friend literally spent over a couple minutes to mend 1 time. It's a worse bug than the moonwalking exploit Legion has and the fact that they have 2 exploits around their power just makes the power that much unfun to play against and I don't blame survivors for not wanting to play against a killer who is actually cheating.
---
I compare it to Wraith's who purposefully used sloppy butcher a couple patches ago when it was glitched on him.
---
It’s just a glitch. I had the same happen with a Wraith chase daily and I hadn’t used or played against a Wraith in 50+ matches.
---
Same reason the shittiest survivors on the team tea bag. New players.
---
LF is usually a killer newer players are attracted to because of BBQ and he’s an easy killer to play. Most anyone who plays this game for any amount of time will play Billy over Leatherface. Until LF gets a fix/rework, there’s no reason to play LF over Billy.
---
Since new players don’t know how to control the map or pressure gens, they naturally tend to tunnel or camp.
---
LF=Scuffed Billy
---
Good.  You will get there.  Match by match.  Think of when you play survivor and how you would act and move against the killer.  Put it to work.  Good luck sir. 🤞
---
Any decent Legion wouldn't let get themselves stunned. Your strategy isn't new, a lot of survivors try it.
---
It’s not like the person being unhooked has much of a choice in the matter. 
---
I'm starting to wonder if this sub has any form of moderation. This guy literally just took someone else's work and split it into 3 images and posted them after the other. 
---
Lmao I'm totally fine with this as well. That would be pretty entertaining but you would have to catch them still so people might not like that. I play both so I'm down for anything that helps.
---
Hmm I have a kill secured here, the only way I could possibly lose it is if I go watch a survivor teabag me at the exit.
---
WAIT is that 14 vault booms from a healthy Dwight right next to the exit gate? I better go get him, easy 2k, they won't know what hit em.
---
Any hotline character would be fine with me
---
The second is pretty much a recap of the first, but with bigger laughs. 
---
Camping the last hook is the most interesting part of a fair game for the killer actually. A lot of free yoinks cause they think you're just a dumb m1 killer who doesn't know any better ☺️
---
Imagine complaining about Doctor
---
*Summer of Head by Mitch Murder from Friday the 13 th kicks in*
---
IVE BEEN GETTING MORE GOOD MESSAGES THAN BAD LATELY. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT, ESPECIALLY SINCE IM TOO GOOD AT KILLER FOR THE RANK IM IN BUT I DONT PLAY ENOUGH TO RANK UP ANYMORE BECAUSE OF LIFE CONFLICTS. 
---
That's true but he's a victim of his fellow survivor's stupidity not me camping like a bastard
---
I know it doesn’t, but it has seemed to help a bunch. I’ve only been killing for a couple weeks so I’m not the best but just the added speed boost allows me to catch up and finish chases easier. Getting lots of 3-4ks so it must be helping me somehow :P
---
Also. Using this same logic: survivors can just not get camped/tunneled by not getting downed in the first place. All problems solved in both of our post together. How come this wasn’t thought of sooner?
---
Man you guys will take any opportunity no matter how irrelevant to whine that people don't like Trump
---
UNFORTUNATELY ITS GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE YOUR TEAMMATES HAVE TO DO SHIT LIKE THIS TO PIP AFTER CERTAIN POINTS. IVE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE DO TERRIBLE UNHOOKS WITH BT DESPITE KNOWING YOULL STILL GO DOWN QUICKLY BECAUSE OF THE ALTRUISM
---
Opulans - you hook everythang!
---
This is so true. I had to take a phone call the other day after I hooked someone and the last gen was already done. I figured I'd just confirm that kill while I was talking, but the last survivor just stood there teabagging waiting for me to hit them so they could unhook. It was a pretty quick call and I just chased them after I hung up and got another kill.
---
WHERE THE FUCK IS BUNNY FENG?! WE AINT FORGET BVHR. 
---
All that's needed is to change the requirements for the autoban. Currently, it autobans if you DC in a certain percentage of games. WHICH IS FUCKING STUPID! WHOEVER CAME UP WITH THAT IDEA SHOULD BE FIRED! PREFERABLY OUT OF A CANNON! 
---
Now I can picture a cultured trapper reading his novels in between trials; a huge, muscled beast of a man reading quietly near a fireplace with brandy lol
---
Might be more accurate to say a nude version of what was posted.  Censored iimplies a mosaic or something.  
---
I had three matches as killer yesterday where survivors used party streamers or escape cake. Those were the three matches I couldn't load into... Felt bad.
---
That Freddy has no kills, one person in dream state, and one generator left. At this point he needs every advantage he can get.
---
He didnt earn it
---
It would make things worse for the reasons others have said already. More killers would start blocking multiple survivors in the basement to try and get their points. Yeah it’s reportable, but the frequency of it occurring would rise so much it would probably take forever if any action was even taken. Also survivors in a hatch situation would do the same thing and just hide in lockers to try to get the killers points. A killer and survivor could also team up and rake in points game after game. Some games the conspiring survivor would DC after farming the helpless teammates to give all the points to the killer, and then other games the killer would return the favor and DC after killing them to give all their points back to the survivor. In short, things would get very ugly and it wouldn’t even solve anything.
---
As a legion main I'm totally cool if people DC to Frank's. It's purple but it's basically his iri hatchets, anal beads, pinky finger etc.
---
However as a stock legion if survivors just stop self-caring and actually do gens I usually get 0-1k.    A 110% m1 killer is pretty easy to avoid or I can self-stun myself 3 times to tunnel you down with frenzy. Usually spend early-mid game focusing on my BBQ stacks then just frenzy farming the rest of the group if they're good.
---
Because it’s so easy to camp with them 
---
what a pointless feature
---
Mexican myers?
---
Sorry to pop your bubble but no survivors besides for Ash talk. 
---
Another thing Ash only takes in the pre game lobbies.
---
Sorry, but i know what frank mixtape do, but i don't know the moonwalk bug. is like when legion moonwalk, chase stop and the wounded-countdown start?
---
It's powerful, but it's definitely not OP. When I use Mettle of Man, I think about how many killers have secondary attacks that are far more useful than their basic, and it's a large majority. Blink attacks don't work with the perk even though getting hit with a nurse base is extremely rare, killers like the huntress and the plague rely on their ranged attacks to hurt survivors, etc. Of course there are some killers who can't counter the perk, but the perk for the most part can be countered, so I don't see it as an OP perk. At least it's balanced.
---
NOED cn=an be avoided by cleansing totems
---
Imagine saying Legion has to work way harder than Doctor. 
---
CAN I ADD SOMETHING TO THIS?
---
GATEKEEPER AND DEVOUT ARE 100% RELIANT ON SURVIVOR BEHAVIOR. CHASER EMBLEMS ARE NONSENSE BECAUSE SOME KILLERS END CHASES SUPER QUICKLY, AND IF THE SURVIVOR IS A POTATO YOU CAN DOWN THEM WITHOUT EVEN INITIATING A CHASE. PULLED OFF A GEN? NICE CHASER. SNIPER WITH A CHAINSAW OR A HATCHET WHEN INJURED? LOL YOU THOUGHT. SURVIVOR THINKS THEYRE SUPER WELL HIDDEN WHEN THEY ARENT AND YOU GET A SLAP? WELL YOU SURE RAN THEM AROUND!
---
THE EMBLEM SYSTEM FOR SURVIVORS IS TERRIBLE BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOUR TEAMMATES TO NOT GET IN YOUR WAY. YOU HAVE TO BE SELFISH AND GET AS MANY SCORING OPPORTUNITIES AS POSSIBLE. 
---
THE EMBLEM SYSTEM FOR KILLERS IS TERRIBLE BECAUSE ONLY 1 ISNT RELIANT ON SURVIVORS AND YOUR SPECIFIC KILLER
---
Yeah, exactly that. You hit them twice with Frank's and then turn away and follow the bloodstains and injured sounds and you can either finish them with another frenzy or down them normally. It's cheap.
---
TBH its a pain in the ass. But I get why it happens I don't blame them.
---
Nope. When I picked up a key he said something. I know for sure.
---
HIP ATTACK
---
Me too, no mic...
---
we got a blood lust gamer here, watch out, he's gaming
---
mmmm ok ... now i undestand much more things
---
I hate creepy pasta so stupid, all of them are just dramatic teenagers with knives 
---
&gt; stealing
---
I never mentioned anywhere that i "own" it. Im joking around and ofc people are getting toxic. Welcome to dbd
---
When did I say that? I was replying to the insinuation that Doctor is cancerous 
---
DC's aren't happening for bloodpoint purposes. Giving the killer/survivors more BP for one just encourages them to be shitty to each other and does nothing to address the root problem of DCing.
---
Aren't you forgetting someone?
---
(Oink, oink)
---
Oh shoot my bad Miss Piggy 😂😱😱
---
This mans still playing Smash 4 smh
---
All I’m saying is eventually the devs aren’t gonna keep nerfing perks on either side because it’s just getting too much. 
---
I agree with you on DCing, but console Nurse’s can smack as good as anyone if you know what you’re doing. Speaking from experience 😬👩🏼‍⚕️
---
I don't have ultimate I just assumed they still have it 😭
---
The ultimate irony is that DS finally gets nerfed and then they immediately introduce another perk that's just as bad and also lets idiots get away for free without any effort required on their part. 
---
God, I sometimes really hate these devs. No one during the development process for Ash's perks thought "Hey, this might be a little too strong?" No one thought that? Come the fuck on. 
---
I agree, the idea of it is what hurts the most and the idea he follows to stall it just becomes annoying. You get a stalker killer who waits behind you far enough to mend then chases you or you get the one who leaves stabs others and revisits you and that becomes annoying. One way or another it might have been a good concept on paper but does not translate well to the game.
---
Well, yeah. But its hard to juggle 4 people with top tier perks that are difficult to counter unless I play like a cunt. The only reason I got hit by ds is because they ran from the hook together and I ended up finding the ds guy. Hey, fair play, hit me with ds. But when it stacks on top of all the other perks that punish the killer pretty harshly it kinda just added up.
---
The visible to the killer only applies if you get healed to full. The simple solution then is once it goes off you dont heal to full but by then  you either get downed and are on second hook state or you get away and can put time on gens until you get downed. Then by the time you're about to get on death hook hopefully all gens get completed and adrenaline pops and by then all you need to do is to not be the one opening the gate. You've pretty much already won if gates are powered and somebody can open them. 
---
#hello#
---
Who is that?
---
It's no fun for both sides. Had matches with 3 survivors, still had to tryhard to get a blackpip. And as a Survivor I get Killers who camp in a 2vs1 match, completely stupid since they barely get bp and pips like that.
---
Idea to stop face camping!  if killer stays close within 24 m radius, the hooked bar goes down slower.  Give that POS a guaranteed 1 kill and only kill
---
That would be avoided if they didn't release perks with severe balance issues in the first place. They have a duty to fix the broken aspects of the game. I know that the hot new survivor meme is that MoM isn't that good because muh reasons, but it's a bad, broken perk
---
Holy moly a clown main, never thought I'd see one
---
I'm not a clown main, but damn I love him 
---
It's not that people don't like the character itself, people don't want to spend an hour mending then self healing again. People don't want a timer to be ticking because the killer cut chase and get found the second you're about to complete your mending. It'll be nice if the timer doesn't go down in the terror radius. No one wants to go against and moonwalking Legion, you have no chance. The whole match becomes trivial, boring and repetitive, the meat of the game is in the chases and this killer offers little in chases. 
---
Right? Like, the perk has little downside at high ranks. You think I constantly want to look for an aura of a guy who is begging me to chase? Thats a time waste in itself.
---
I actually see clowns be the most toxic. LF camps the most but I see more clowns camp, tunnel, mori spam, and bm than almost any other killer
---
Make the game more Broken with a variety of perks. Keeps it interesting. That's why MvC2 was so fun. It had so much variety and was a healthy broken so you could always discover MORE busted stuff
---
the dude is dwight? 
---
Community manager here- let me assure you that yes we do.
---
this actually is a great idea and i absolutely support it 100%

For some people crashes aren't just "uncommon", they're the norm.  I had 2-3 straight-up crashes yesterday alone, as well as when I had to alt+ctrl+del on the loading screen once in addition to that.  And that is stuff is 100% their fault, not mine (I've repeatedly contact them for tech support and such as well, which hasn't helped).

Some characters will launch on their own. The same happened with Bill (PC only) and Leatherface.

you should shock the window or pallet before they get to it

In the full video it seems the DC'd survivor is even unhooked and remains ingame. TFW a bug ends up outright improving your gaming experience, like it should have been that way from the beginning. Why can't we get DC'd survivor "bots" so we can mori or sacrifice them and get the bloodpoints or BBQ stacks?
---
how did you accomplish this i really want to get the achievement for it
---
you reposted someone else's content and used it to get more karma. That's stealing
---
its basically an indirect buff to her
---
If i was you i should call the police
---
Because no one who plays killer would ever characterize it the way you did. You're talking just like a person who only plays survivor and only perceives perks as an individual use. It's flatly untrue that it's "just an extra hit" and anyone who ever played killer would know that
---
I didn't believe the people who were like "as a killer main I actually loved being hit by DS" and I don't believe you either.
---
Also, back when I only played survivor I used to lie about playing killer so I'm able to recognize it when people like you do it.
---
It takes one to know one.
---
REMOVE LEGION SO MY WHOLE TEAM CAN STOP DC'ING IMMEDIATELY.
---
Could do it with a rolling window. Every DC moves the punishment tier up, but after say, a week, that DC is no longer held against you. If your connection is bad enough that you are still getting high punishments, then it's best if you just don't play the game.
---
I feel for you. It also has an emotional impact on me. Just remember they’re just venting their frustration and it doesnt even matter what you did or did not do! Keep playing! 
---
What does it do? Haven’t played since plague came out.
---
"loop legion" because their power doesn't give them a huge speed burst, fast vaulting windows or jumping over pallets? 
---
I think it's just because new people play him.
---
I never thought I’d see a username this relevant in a context this niche. Groovy. 
---
I know. I wish Freddies power would make you see survivors. Better use overcharge to slow the game down a tiny bit too
---
Correct, I was able to continue BP gains and down Claudette a few times / hook, as were the other guys able to save. 
---
lol your post history makes it super obvious that you only play survivor. Other people have even called you out on it ffs
---
Legion's pretty good tbh
---
I’m sorry I’m not convincing enough for you buddy, I could give you proof if you’re so inclined to have it. It’s not really cool to just accuse people of lying because they don’t agree with you, that makes you look bad, if I’m being honest. 
---
Okay, add me if you dont find anyone with a mic. My psn is HOTLIPZ-  
---
What lvl are you?  I'm only level 13 survivor... 
---
Because MoM is a busted perk
---
Not according to my game last night he didn't.
---
Dude, I just asked you to credit the guy who put time and effort into rendering it. Posting his work and gaining karma or popularity or whatever odd of it is considered art theft because you didn't make it. How does asking for props to the artist make me "toxic"? This community is so sensitive, I swear.
---
I should have it but i dont
---
lookin good
---
lvl 13? well level doesnt rlly matter if you know how the game works and know what to do when the killer is following you
---
Thank you :)
---
Oof.  That's sad. M1 killers are punished and killers that can down with m2 are not.
---
I've never had 4 man DS  where they all hit it before. They've had DS but  only 1 or 2 hit the skill check.
---
Fucking this. I have no idea what problem that MoM was designed to solve. 
---
Can't think of a better way to die
---
Hit'em with that "ha-CHA" all peach style y'know what I mean
---
Deadbydaylight is a soulslike confirmed
---
Getting hit by a killer isn't "situational", it's routine.
---
Made my friend mori me in KYF with clown just to see it. Its confusing, to be sure
---
I would like a shapeshifting killer, because the stealth killers are my favorite to play (I main Myers and Pig), but it’s unfortunately just not viable. The ability would be useless with squads and eventually it’ll be far too easy for survivors to figure out that you’re the killer. 
---
It’s hard to be bad at something when there’s a 50% chance of winning every time. 
---
yeah maybe through the emblem system
---
also  make the endgame more dangerous
---
You can't expect people to be playing a game together and *not* talk about what's going on. You can't control that, the devs can't control that. Getting pissed off at an internet stranger won't make a difference. 
---
Myers and Pig. I love scaring the shit out of people and getting them by surprise. I also really love the visible fear from survivors when they hear the Halloween theme and kind of look around like, “oh shit, was that from me?” 
---
Forreal. High rank play is an absolute headache already. Buts its been manageable you know? This new perk is just way too messed up. 
---
If someone is the obsession hes running DS too
---
How much empathy do you have for killers disconnecting from loadouts they don't like? "Wow, another Mettle of Man? Eh...I'm not dealing with this shit, I'm gonna DC. Can you blame me? I wasn't having fun!"
---
Nope. I've run DS and some random who didn't even have DS was the obsession. 
---
My computer is basically fine and I just got used to a crash a day or so. All of my friends also crashed at least once a day. It’s really a problem and unless that’s fixed then punishments probably shouldn’t be discussed.
---
YOU KNOW WHAT'S VERY BAD? WASTING HOURS SITTING IN A LOBBY AND HAVING THE COMMUNITY DIE BECAUSE OF IT.
---
Strange - that should not happen. Maybe you missed another obsession perk like OoO 
---
Gotta give Freddy a bone or two every so often.
---
He looks like a mexican, change my mind.
---
Only 4k bloodpoints! That guy must've been really trash.
---
I’m guessing both Jeff the Killer and Ghostface inspired Legion
---
the killers i play the most are the hillbilly, michael myers, hag, but recently i have been playing the nurse a lot
---
There’s no name for these loops, but there are some maps that have these specific really strong vault loops that can feel impossible to break without Bamboozle. Most of them will give you Bloodlust if you keep the chase running long enough, but usually the best solution is to leave and find a Survivor in a weaker location. 
---
The power of survivors is directly related to the tiles in their vicinity. You don’t need to engage good survivors near powerful loops. Honestly, even if you can down the survivor it’s generally not worth the time investment to do so. 
---
Jesus, survivors get a decent perk and every killer has to cry. God forbid if you were to touch ruin or noed though
---
That's true borrowed is a godsend tbh
---
He wants the survivors to start with the mangled condition, deep wound, and broken. 
---
A man of class and a fellow chili purveyor

I crave the sweet release of death in one way or another
---
This sub is obsessed with legion. Either you post about hating legion or post about other posts about legion.  At this point I'm thinking it's just a meme because legion is one of the killers I run into the least
---
distortion seems kinda trash you might as well just use lockers and hide behind gens in order to escape aura readings
---
Also if you DC before getting moried with an Ivory you'll just allow the killer to mori someone else instead.
---
Better idea: how about actually punishing ragequitting? If you ragequit 2-3 times in an hour you get locked out of the game and can't earn any BP on either side for 24 hours. 
---
With the purple and green add-ons, each timer increases by 1.5 times the previous timer. I think the 4th or 5th hit is 2 minutes of mending
---
r/cursedimages
---
Uh ok? 
---
Thanks for answering my question! I will record it next time once I know they’re safe and take into account that some time is spent healing, with totems, etc - I understand trying to farm some bp at the end. Also, I admit I didn’t do a great job - I killed one and had three hooks total for the game I mentioned.
---
Also, I have settings set where no one can communicate with me. I researched the game before playing and didn’t want to bother deleting comments since I knew I’d be playing killer. However, there is no way I can prevent them from adding me as a friend. That was an option on the 360, but not Xbox One. I think it’s so fans can follow popular streamers/developers.
---
Finally, thanks for mentioning glitched pallets - I did not realize that could happen! I usually see all that are left run toward an open door (I don’t just give up once all generators are powered), but I will check on them and break the pallets if they’re trapped.
---
Why get survivors when you can get the killers ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
---
There's like three killers you won't get to use it against, and they'll need to down you with their kit instead of an M1 attack to avoid activation, and don't know you have it anyway. Outside of them, the only situation that your team wouldn't benefit from MoM is if you escaped without ever getting downed and never even needed it. I don't see a whole lot of reason not to be running this perk right now. 
---
And yes, I realize the irony in this.
---
MoM is meta potential and a personal favorite of mine.
---
Buckle-Up is an okish situational perk that can counter slugging.
---
Flip-Flop is a good perk but it’s pretty situational.
---
*HYA*
---
she had sooooo many opoortunities to throw a hatchet at you
---
Think it's happening across the board.
---
I'm on PS4 too and I haven't had the chance to play as Ash yet.
---
Plus that damn beautiful laugh never lets me get mad at him
---
it doesnt matter either way is correct
---
Nope, SFM.
---
I think we disagree on the issue. I hate playing against certain killers playstyles from a difficulty perspective such as the pig and myers. This makes for a very hard game that I often don't win. But it is different with legion because his character abilities basically stop any counter in the chase. He can just follow you around all game if he wants to, assuming it is a slightly experienced killer. It is not fun because you know you don't have a chance to escape a chase, therefore the game doesn't feel the same. There is no suspense. It is a strange game for me because the gameplay is stressful and tense and you get fun from that, but only if you have the feeling that you have a chance. Unlike conventional game fun-ness.
---
Please kill yourself, no one will miss you 
---
Bonus points for the puppet.
---
How about instead of engaging in a pissing contest you record your game and get proof of Ash talking. 
---
But still. Its not hostage unless you physically cannot end the game. Next time just beat their ass. You got this.
---
Lmao, equating my opinion with the earth being flat, how funny. It’s a video game dude, not the end of the world. I don’t see how an opinion on a video game mechanic can be wrong since there’s no “science” behind how the game is supposed to work. The devs decide that, and if they decided this perk was viable, so be it. 
---
YES THEY DESERVE IT
---
Do you organize by hot or new?
---
I think she was out
---
Hilarious.
---
Playing like a dbag isnt cool. They need to fix the whole crouching thing and your timer still going. It's so dumb. Seen pigs trap people in the basement with traps on their heads 
---
Bamboozle won't stop the Asylum loop, there's two windows and they can run one until the bamboozle wears off on the other.
---
Wait did you want to do a link battle or something, I grab five examples myself of people bitching about Legion?
---
It's bad now, I never had an issue before with finding a game. It never took 10 mins! sometimes even longer.
---
Our bellies shall jiggle unto eternity! 
---
The puppet is what makes it a double dab
---
Ash is the only character I've been able to play as weirdly lol. Started maining Ash cos I saved up a load of BP but was an Adam main before and now I can't find a game with him at all.
---
You felt the need to make a lengthy post about it, so you obviously were annoyed. Walking backwards isn't chasing them out. Chase them, hit them, then they exit. That's just the way it goes. If you're not going to attack them then you've only got yourself to blame. The fact that either side was willing to do this for an hour and forty minutes is baffling. 
---
And no, they can't use any generators if the exit gates are already powered.
---
I browse hot. And that's my entire point, the subreddit is all about "boo hoo you get downvoted into oblivion when talking positive about legion" when the only posts that get upvotes are the kind that I linked above, and no "legion bad" posts actually reach the frontpage.
---
Damn got em
---
Oh shid you said the n word shits gonna get real.
---
Don't listen to what survivors say. Some of them think Ruin and BBQ are OP. 
---
Rule 1: you don't listen to survivors as killer. Don't play by their rules and don't listen to their bullshit. These guys cry about everything and they're going to keep crying in their piss-soaked diapers shaking their rattles until someone listens.
---
Don't be that guy who listens. 
---
I’m not hiding - I’m using spirit’s ability to get bp. I would estimate she gets 252/minute. If they go over 5 minutes, I either chase them out backwards or leave the game on, but do something else, depending on how badly I want to play another trial.
---
Also, walking backwards through the game doesn’t guarantee they’ll leave - though in that situation I am able to hit them during their “butt dance” (I like that phrase:) and have even got a small number hooked.
---
It’s not afraid - it’s more like I want to give them as little satisfaction as possible, plus simple curiosity about how long they’ll do it. I don’t understand the purpose of it, but it must give them some satisfaction since it gives no bp, correct? Unless they want me to chase them for more bp, which does not benefit me since Spirit can get bp without them. 
---
I’m not sure if you need specific perks for it, but I’m pretty sure you do get rewarded more in bloodpoints and emblems for altruistic actions that take place after the gates open. And in some cases, dying for a teammate can be worth more than saving yourself. Also Tapp’s tenacity with Ash’s flip flop and Mettle of Man can help you unhook someone from a face camper after gates are open and still make it out alive after if the killer chases them to gate instead of hooking you immediately.
---
I've been sorting by new posts for the last few weeks, and while it's slowed down, there's definitely still plenty of 'Fuck Legion' posts.
---
C[an]nib[al]
---
There's a single achievement called "no one left behind" for unhooking someone after the gate is open, and I think the "We'll make it!" perk gives people you rescue a speed bonus if the gates are opened.
---
Ooh, did I win?
---
'THIS POWER... IT'S TOO STRONG!'
---
It gives survivors an extra health state per match, with a completely avoidable downside through exploiting the healing system. 
---
Huzzah!
---
But are you *positive*?
---
Cause that seems to be working out for op. 🙄 
---
Obviously op probably shouldn’t be toxic, but I actually wouldn’t blame them if majority of their games were like this. 🤧
---
Mine is a little unrealistic because you can't have the same perk equipped multiple times but if you could I would run:
---
1. Pebble
---
2. Pebble
---
3. Pebble
---
4. Pebble
---
I think it's called distraction but idk I've called it Pebble since it's been out.
---
Thank you. I’m hoping they help people find more use for a perk that may seem useless at times and promote more team play.
---
I personally like playing Leatherface or Clown. Maybe that’s because they’re both simple and easy to play. They’re both fun to me, so either way I can’t really say?
---
Something about having us in the first half
---
You should absolutely be running this perk right now, in fact you're handicapping your team's success if you're not, it's that good. I can absolutely see why it's users are anxious over the level of criticism, I wouldn't want to give up a perk like this either. I don't blame the players trying to downplay it's strength or accuse it's critics of exaggerating. Can't wait to unlock it. 
---
I've seen, from multiple unrelated people, the sentiment of "Fuck you, I denied you a BBQ stack therefore I win"
---
It was especially funny one time when I wasn't even running BBQ to which they replied
---
"Yea, but you should have been, so I still win, fuck off"
---
Spite is such a strong motivator in the game, I would love to see BHVR utilize in some manner.
---
Lore, too many people were ignoring him trying to help them learn another language, one day he snapped and went on a mass killing spree. Power... Overwhelming guilt and procrastination. 
---
The problem is absolutely the perk lol.

No see the point of playing legion is you WANT them to be salty, rage and sometimes DC. You're missing Level 3 Ruin, Level 3 Chili, You need NOED, Use a Ebony Mori and a Frank's mix tape.
---
Spirit is my main followed by Pig. I love playing them both. Although I have to admit about half of my Pig games end up in a farm fest. When I sneak up on people and they don’t see me I start acting like I’m helping with the gens and then when they realize it they either sprint burst away or play with me lol.
---
How is this any less overpowered? It sounds stronger unless I'm reading it wrong. 
---
Definitely. I just feel most people see it more as a get out of jail free card that’s useless against half the killers instead of a time waster that can be used to help the team in multiple ways.
---
Instead of keeping you in the injured state, it gives you the bleed out timer. It’s the same as bt.
---
That’s how Jane mori’s killers
---
If you’re playing nea yeah
---
They're not going to adjust the perk, people just paid money for it, the cynical part of me thinks they purposely made an S-tier perk to sell the DLC. 
---
This is pretty much the truth. There's no reason not to run it if you have a slot open.
---
Hell, even vaulting a window as you know you're going down is still technically more helpful. Yes, I bought maybe 2 seconds, but that's 2 more seconds for people to work gens and process where I went down.
---
Yeah I've run into just one other person here on reddit who has our issue, so it seems we're in a very small minority. There aren't any major streamers who seem to have this issue either.  I'm not expecting a fix for us until MAYBE after dedicated servers and even then it'll only be fixed on accident because they're changing so much. I'm fully expecting dedicated servers to be a shitshow for at least 2 months though. I love DbD, but BHVR is just objectively the worst run game company I've ever had to deal with. 
---
It depends on how often you're DC'ing though. I mean, if 20% of your games drop because of crappy internet, it's not really fair to other people playing the game, even if that's out of your control. If it's more like 5% or maybe 10%, I'd say that's more acceptable. People are going to have their own thresholds for what they feel is okay.
---
I wouldn't want to punish people who have an occasional DC due to issues, or someone holding the game hostage. I get DC'ed due to poor connection to the killer sometimes, but it's probably once every 20 - 30 games. What needs to be changed is how a trend of disconnects is dealt with. The current threshold is way too high.
---
Pig for sure. I feel like her style is how this game should be played/ how it was in the beginning for me. Workin on a gen and frantically looking around to see if shes coming. Then you get hit with the rbt and the panick strikes again. 
---
r/deadbydaylightmemes
---
This is pretty much how I play Legion too. Focus on BBQ stacks, then mostly just run around and stab people. I don't really play killer to rank up. I've been to red ranks already and I hated it there.
---
I know, it’s just I get the feeling it might just be ds 2.0. I don’t expect it to be changed at all tbh, this is just an idea I though of.
---
I hate that the shack is a place that the killers fear and the survivors rejoice to find.
---
We’ll make it actually just makes you heal teammates faster after unhooking someone so you can immediately get them back to full health. Can be amazing if you really want to go full on medic but won’t help much against campers and tunnelers. Borrowed time is a far better option in those cases.
---
The tutorials cover most everything and if you really want advice just post and ask
---
I will not reveal your blasphemy to the B I N G B O N G B O I.
---
and swf still go in with 4 flashlights, let's not start a discussion where it's not needed
---
Wait, you're really a community manager for behavior? Well if you are I'd like to say I appreciate the effort you guys put in and I love how dbd is now!
---
(except for MoM) 
---
Yeah, that line of thinking got me to drop Prove Thyself for an exhaustion perk. The time I'm saving by helping gen speed is useful, but it's no more beneficial than the time I'm buying by prolonging a chase. 
---
edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger!
---
Few things are as scary as repairing a gen and looking around to see mike staring at you.
---
I appreciate the pun
---
A new epic survivor came out. Survivor lobbies are taking longer due to killers not playing
---
It's okay, you lost it the moment you used the word "uses" in a plural situation.
---
Of course, how can they camp and tunnel with that broken perk? 4head
---
Who's complaining?
---
Myers EW3 is also not affected by MoM. The perk stats you need to be in the "injured" state for the thing to proc. I have been finding to use insta down perks for the M1 killers works well. Make Your Choice, Rancor, Iron Maiden (not NOED, cuz it a crutch perk.) Make Your Choice my preferred one. Especially on like Hag or Spirit
---
You dont need franks, just double hit someone in frenzy and while stunned turn around and look at the ground for 1 second then start following their blood. They either misposition themselves and you can hit them again or they keep running and you can frenzy hit them and their bar will deplete
---
It looks like you. You said you were going to kill yourself because of d-strike. Seems like a complaint to me.
---
What a lazy attempt at shaming with a reliable 'But I do it too' to fall back at. You should be ashamed, but only for this comment, you inconsequential prick
---
Okay. 
---
Hope or wake up? Either ends the game faster
---
It's a good idea but I think there would be some issues. Mainly people leaving games if they got garbage perks. If it picked random characters too you could have people DC on you simply because the game chose you to be legion
---
Then move on to the next survivor 
---
Because she uses perks and is good at the game.  
---
ALMAMOD I LOVE IT
---
It has counters. Camp first stage. Aura is revealed to survivors who are within terror radius infinitely after a heal. Without heal it’s basically a regular chase with the added effect of moaning and blood unless they’re running iron will. It’s countered by almost half of the killers. It costs money meaning that some people will have and some won’t, it’s not gonna be nearly as popular as self care. Due to the aura it is quite literally impossible to escape a chase successfully almost guaranteeing a hook eventually. I’m not saying it shouldn’t be tweaked, but most complaints are about full SwF teams who run the perk, which is bullshit. But when 1 or 2 people run the perk it ain’t that bad.
---
The killer you are playing is the least fun to vs of any killer, and if I have to explain why..... well just keep playing a character that doesn't play DBD I guess.
---
That perk set up disgusts me
---
First of all, we need context.
---
What rank and region are you? 
---
Calm down lmao, I’m just saying that i do this sometimes too. Imagine being this wound up over a comment on a video game. Incredible 
---
Didnt mean like that, im good with everyone bringing whatever , its in the game afterall. All im saying is the system works great, as toxic builds already exist pretty often anyways 
---
Its not as bad as I thought it would be. 
---
They need to do something about how easy it is to exploit the healing system and mitigate the downside of this perk. Healing progress should at least slowly decrease when you're not actively healing. 
---
Sounds like a tunneling Freddy to me. 
---
That's like every killer no? 
---
WHY THE HELL IS THIS GAMES RANKING SHIT!! I HAVEN’T HAD ONE FUCKING EVEN GAME!!! EVERY GAME IT’S RANK 15 SURVIVORS, AGAINST A FUCKING P3 RANK 2 BILLY!! HOW THE FUCK DO YOU MESS UP THIS BAD?!?!!? 
---
If you were the only teamate running an obsession perk previously including Decisive, than yes it did until this most recent change guarantee you were the obsession.  If multiple teamates were running obsession perks than the obsession would go to one of you at random.  Regardless in the previous system, it was always assigned to someone running an obsession perk. 
---
Theres no counrerlay to understand
---
I caught one going for the rescue, so that was #2. The third happened to be just close enough outside for me to bring them in. I think that last one was hoping for a hatch escape. So yeah, it took some luck. :)
---
I was curious rather than annoyed and did admit my post was long and added a tldr. It was long so that people wouldn’t make incorrect assumptions. When someone poses a question to me, I like to hear details. I forgot I even posted it until today. My post should have been asking why survivors don’t leave once they’ve cleared totems, healed, and completed everything that gives bp, since now I’m wondering about that. 
---
Also, I can’t hit them if they’re that far away. I do hit the ones hanging out near the exit but still within hitting distance when I spot one.
---
hitting survivors before they are on the other side is normal but whenever i play survivor the killer hits me when i’m already like 5ft away, i don’t know if it’s just a bug or actually their connection though oops 
---
I mean the majority of the good killer perks are dlc perks. BBQ and chili is an S tier perk that's not only never been on the shrine but its only available by buying LF by himself. Ash has an S tier perk and you buy him without a killer. Bill has an S tier perk on PC. Clown has an S tier perk. Spirit has an S tier perk. Laurie has an S tier perk. Not agreeing with either side just saying that almost every licensed pack has good to great perks. Even remember me can be S tier in the right situations and Make Your Choice is certainly S tier in my book too. I can't think of a single killer who released with entirely garbage perks. Nurses calling, Ruin, Monitor and abuse/overcharge all buy able on PC all pretty damn S tier in proper builds. 
---
&gt; But it is really selfish if you don't stay here for as long as possible to waste your time... For me... a random survivor.
---
But it is though. At the end of the day it's your choice and I won't villainize you for it or anything if you decide to DC, but doing so makes the experience that much worse for the other three survivors in the game.
---
Like, I get it. Legion is not fun to play against. But at least maybe be a little considerate of everyone else on your team.
---
truly an amazing perk. they think they can spawn far away and do a gen fast? BOOM they get pranked.
---
My favorite games have to be Plague and Miss Piggy. The fact the killers add another objective already make them 10x better. Plague games I have gone against are so fun. When you hear the bell ring from her drinking a fountain turns her from an annoyance to something you need to avoid. (If she an aim her puke of course :P) 
---
It's not op. 
---
That sucks lol.
---
Aura reveal is really nothing. Killers are not weak because they lack information. Infact survivors use being revealed as a benefit, like Object of Obsession to lure the killer to the strongest loops. Time to down is everything. "Countered by half the killers" is not exactly correct. Are you meaning to tell me that killers now meant to not only keep in mind how many times they hooked who, who has what perks, which gens to protect  due to map layout AND on top of that count how many times they hit each survivor? Meanwhile what do survivors need to keep track of? Run to gen and hold M1. It's already even more popular then Self Care. I already see it on 100% of survivors that I play against. Just now had 3 matches in a row where all 4 survivors had it. Impossible to escape a chase? You know that doesn't matter right? As a survivor you don't even want to escape a chase. You want the chase to go on as long as possible. The game was already bad on killers. Now it's even worse.
---
I do occasionally kill them or hit them when I feel it’s possible (like if they’re outside the gate). Walking backwards through exits works 90% of the time, but I can’t beat them when they’re at the doorway unless the developers change Spirit so that’s she’s not blind when moving rapidly. 
---
nope
---
And other hilarious jokes you can tell yourself vol. II
---
I love chases with leather face. 
---
When I know we are approaching a pallet, I start revving up my chainsaw. They either drop the pallet that I instantly break, or they keep going and run the risk of taking the swing themselves. 
---
BBQ and chili + hex devour hope are great together and make him fun without any need to camp 
---
Yeah it would *still* be a strong perk even with the BT effect/Deep Wounds timer.
---
Can confirm. Was just killed by Freddy. 
---
Check my history. I made a small post with my experience with it. 
---
Nice post though. I agree.
---
*new survivor gets released and finally has a perk that isnt a total meme and might actually be worth running*
---
“I think they purposefully made an S-tier perk to sell the DLC”
---
hottest take yet so far. The survivors have gotten complete trash perks in the past 4 expansions. Kates perks suck, Adams perk suck, Jeffs perks suck, Jane has one good perk (Poised) and the rest are total memes.
---
Ash has two god awful “anti slugging” perks that are just worse than Unbreakable and MoM. All MoM does is make M1 killers weaker. Just like any other perk in the game, they hard counter some killers or get hard countered by other killers. 
---
You are never charging up enough stacks against a Huntress or a Billy or even a Myers that knows when to proc T3. All the perk does is make M1 killers like Wraith and Freddy weaker, which Dead Hard already does while also working against all killers after the first hit and can be used multiple times a match.
---
The worst survivor is always found first and thus always killed first. Then that survivor whines about the killer tunneling after the match.
---
i would say lithe, self care, dance with me and quick and quiet, the amount of times i have gotten away from the killer is insane.
---
I guess it's just a weird tradition. They wait for one last hit because you (the killer) get extra points for that last strike and they get extra for escaping one last chase, win win really. Of course there's an element of goading when some people do it and still run back inside and don't leave, but again it comes down to you being too stubborn to not chase them. I know it sucks when some survivors have run you ragged and are all teabagging at the exit, but that's more of an incentive to just play along, make them leave and move on to the next game. Sulking away from exits just makes them think they got to you (whether they did or not.)
---
Hey please post your video [right over here](https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us). It might be possible to take action against this player.  
---
Exactly, it’s a good perk, definitely, but there’s nothing wrong with good perks for both sides. It’s requires 3 hits to activate, which unless you’re running an insta heal or somehow escape the chase, you’re hooked. And even when it does activate the best option is to stay injured unless you’re okay with wasting time healing or being spotted through walls. It might need some tweaks but other than that it’ll ruin the perk.
---
Well let's be fair now.... that's going to happen to matter what. That's gaming culture in general, the fact that you can leave when you're unhappy or feels the odds are too stacked against you.   
---
I don't feel like that's enough of a reason not to bring in new game modes like this, because I do believe the amount of people who would enjoy it will outweigh the ones who don't enjoy it. It's a mode for people who want randomness, and if you don't enjoy the randomness, you go back to playing the normal mode. 
---
Yeah but I’m a smol brain doctor main
---
Other than the first one (and I guess the remake although I haven't seen it), they're pretty much all comedies. So, there's tons of gore but it's so over the top that you have to laugh. 
---
No, it's not. When the killer DC's a few seconds after you load in the game you depip since the only emblem you get is a gold Unbroken (or w/e it's called, the one you get for escaping) which is not enough for a safety pip 
---
I know, but I’m smol brained
---
Maybe a small but good way to balance it would be to let the killer know when it’s active on somebody via a change in their player icon. Same for borrowed time. So rather than something that catches the killer by surprise and wastes time, it’ll act as a deterrent and encourage the killer to go after someone else. 
---
I don't dc. I have once when I only had a games time left but I tend to stay. I just don't blame people who do. I agree with you in that at the end of the day its your choice. Its not the end of the world. I would usually be against unreasonable dcing but I understand how boring games against legion are and games can last a long time.
---
My point above was they are dcing not to waste time. It is a sorry state but hey, i'm sure it'll get sorted.
---
I agree it does seem very strong, definitely becoming a staple in my normal survivor build for obvious reasons. Hopefully this discussion doesn't turn into a pissing contest from both sides. But I believe the perk will inevitably be nerfed or reworked for the reasons you stated above. Hopefully one day the devs will tackle core game mechanics instead of inventing more perks to combat a poorly thought out system. It really does feel like these last 3-4 sets of new perks(on both sides) are just band aids to bigger issues in the game.
---
im shaking and cryign 
---
except stealth thats the biggest counter to her
---
I agree 100%
---
Honestly though ebony moris are just horrible to go against. I don't dc from them but they're my least favourite. 
---
God forbid survivors get a new perk that is worth running in a DLC. There hasnt been a good perk released for survivors in awhile. They’ve all been total memes. Tapp’s perks, quentin’s perks, kate, adam, jeff...like god damn.
---
I dont remember this reddit freaking out when Spirit Fury got released. That perk is insanely strong on almost every killer and I think its ok. While MoM is completely useless against certain killers and against the killers its good against you dont need it to win.
---
FML
---
Stealth is literally the least intuitive way to play the game and it doesn't do anything to her compared to literally any other killer. Nurse doesnt need Ruin or any offensive perks so she can also run 4 tracking perks, so you know, stealth is literally not an argument. 
---
xbox framerate is so much better than ps4, however i have a ps4 so i make do with what i have. but yes for sure
---
“Killers are not weak cause they lack information.”
---
I’m not saying that killers would be still weak without it. Specific killer balance is a whole other topic. What I’m saying is that killer perks like BBQ are generally popular due to having information revealed to them. If you’re honestly saying that information isn’t important than I don’t know what game you are playing. 
---
“It’s already more popular than Self Care”
---
More popular than self care? Just because you had three matches in a row with these perks doesn’t mean anything. Survivors pick self care VASTLY more than a day old perk, that is a fact and you know it. 
---
“Impossible to escape the chase? You know that doesn’t matter right?”
---
Yes escaping chases is important as it stops pressure, forcing killers to search for survivors again. Distracting is a legitimate strategy, but losing them is also important if possible.
---
Also, no. Killers shouldn’t need to keep track of the perk. When an entire SwF team runs the perk it is bullshit, but again, that’s a whole other subject. When individuals run the perks it isn’t as strong due to a lack of efficiency that comes with solo queue.
---
For real. You tank 1 hit on your 4th hit and can’t full heal or you’re revealed. People put together all of these theoretically synergies like “the survivor dead harded me, then tanked with MoM and then Adrenaline activated and they got away”. Like yeah okay. It’s easy to sit here and hand pick these picture perfect scenarios but the chances of that fucking happening in sequence are extremely rare and not common enough to affect balance.
---
But dropping a chase on purposr is against what the killer is supposed to do. Its one of the main reasons pwyf is not used a whole lot.
---
I make Memetages in pvp and would love to play with other members. 
---
GT: Lord JellyBelly
---
From my experience, clowns are the worst. Never met a cool clown but I’ve met a few decent bubbas. Bubbas will continue to get the benefit of the doubt from me until they prove otherwise..
---
I have no pride in it. It's not an accomplishment to point out the obvious. I do however feel like calling you out on it the way anyone spouting bullshit should be
---
They definitly did that on purpose to sell the Dlc, there's no way they didn't see this was old DS while they modified sair perk in the same patch.
---
I've stopped playing killer, don't care. There's just no reason to play a role which is more stressful, unbalanced and now frustating. Just like in moonrise event, when there were a shortage of killers, I'm gonna sit waiting my queue time as a survivor while I read threads whinning about time in matchmaking. Guess what? No one wanna have a frustating game by actually doing what you are suppose to do with no counters.
---
It reinforces using meta killers, it encourages the 'tank' playstyle that they were trying to neuter with the exhaustion changes a while back, it raises the ceiling on SWF gameplay while lowering it for the M1 killers. This would be a problematic perk even if it *wasn't* the best one available.
---
Aww, okay cool thanks! Enjoy the rest of your day!
---
If by "fair" you mean "absolutely shit" then yeah. The perk wouldn't even be strong if it was 100%.
---
Yeah. I see a lot of people trying to get hit once just so they can heal and have it activate on the next one. If you do it right though you can make it a 4 hit with insta heal after it activates which not everyone will have all the time. Its nice to have. I just wish killer had a new perk too that was good so we wouldmt hear as many complaints.  
---
You could also counter with perks like Make your choice, NOED, Nurses, etc
---
*unfurls "THE SCROLL" and puts on his glasses*
---
Thanataphobia, Ruin, Freddy, STBFL, Freddy, Tinkerer, Trapper trap hitbox repeatedly or trap hooks, Billy downing survivors on the pallets, removed a Nurse blink, Hag traps being able to be crouched over, Freddy, "Snap out of it" doesn't count as healing, "Deep wounds" recovery doesn't count as healing, "Iridescent Heads" remove 4 hatchets from Huntress instead of 2 in addition to wind up time add-ons being removed, "Brutal Strength" (twice), "No One Escapes Death" (twice), removed the killer's ability to shove survivors away from hooks....
---
...I mean.... I could keep going, but this list goes on, and I just felt like naming the most significant ones that came to mind.
---
I like the spooky killers in the background
---
5 ft away is for sure a connection. Do you just fall down without them around or do you rubberbamd back to the window?
---
Agreed. It's not that often you and a survivor are both injured. It still wouldn't even be high tier either
---
I think the game has gotten to the point where the games need to last abit longer. New objective, 7 gens etc. Itd not only bolster the games fun and possibly bring new mechanics, but it will also give killers more time to fckn do something without stressing out the whole game.
---
Less annoying still than a Killer with Mix Tape, Irideacent Head, Ebony Mori, etc
---
Confirmed. It’s not “hiding” he defiantly says the above.
---
Where's the switch edition?
---
Thats what ive been saying the matches need to be longer and the survivors need more chances.
---
Make it fun for both sides. 
---
In all fairness he does say the beginning. He doesnt say how long either so 30 seconds is a good amount. 
---
Maybe more like 75%. 50% was fair to start with but it doesn't seem to be super useful or save a lot of time. 
---
Youre right. If a survivor isnt able to ust heal in 2.5 seconds then a perk is garbage. 
---
Maybe run leader with it. Find was to synergize perks together. 
---
my characters usually "teleport" back to the window when this happens, it sucks oof
---
I don’t even use the perk and probably won’t even buy Ash. You guys constructing your perfect arguments with perk synergies only trick so many people. In order for MoM to be op it needs multiple combinations to go correctly which simply don’t occur enough for them to be reasonable arguments. Also like I said, half of the killers ignore the perk. Both chainsaws, huntress hatchet, Corrupt Purge, Legion basically ignores it because of deep wound, traps, and does nothing against nurse.
---
No where did I say anyone is entitled to anything, stop baiting. All I’m saying is that survivors finally got a perk that *might* shake up the meta and this reddit immediately starts whining and complaining. Yet how come no one did this when Spirit Fury released which is one of the strongest killer perks ever? Why cant survivors get a new perk that switches up the meta?
---
Its a good thing that decent perks are getting released so people start running something new, the meta changes. Will people start running perks like Haunted Grounds/MYC on killers like wraith to try and reduce the MoM stacks? 
---
I havent seen anyone give a reasonable argument that MoM is too strong. Its strong against M1 killers and completely useless against killers that have an M2 that damages survivors, and has diminishing results against the M1 killers that have a power that helps then in chase (Spirit, Hag, Myers). 
---
I’m interested to see how M1 killers adapt to accomodate for MoM. I think its exciting that a perk that is strong in chase and isnt C tier finally got released. Just like when Spirit Fury got released. 
---
Yeah I think there's a tendency for everyone to exaggerate when they're speaking about something they're frustrated with. But I don't see how the strength of this perk can be downplayed, or that stacking abuse shouldn't be considered when we discuss it. It's not a 1 vs 1 game, and 2-4 extra health states per match with a completely avoidable downside can and will be extremely problematic.

Did you ignore every other strategy I suggested? I’m listing them off and as much as camping sucks it’s a strategy, I’d be disingenuous if I didn’t at least mention it. About SwF and 4x, that’s why I’ve been saying to wait it out. FFS this perk hasn’t even been out for a week and people already are saying it’s op. We should wait for tech or strats against the perk. It is possible to balance against SwF while also maintaining it strength for solos. 
---
It's still situational for all of that. For me i really get to shine ds and mom if I get tunneled. Had a guy do it the other night and i got away so in those situation i don't have any sympathy. 
---
I N T R E S T I N G
---
I guess i shouldnt have expected you to argue in good faith. 
---
So, basically Deep Wounds and Snapping not counting as healing is all you got? 
---
I agree. When I play survivor and get matched with a killer who is clearly new or just not very good yet, I often give them a kill when everyone else gets out. I feel bad their game lasted 5 mins and they got 1 hook.
---
Sometimes they carry me to the gate anyway bless their hearts. I digress. The game is definitely getting to the point of needing longer games though. Agree 100%
---
The perk is garbage. Are you saying it is a good perk?
---
Leader doesn't affect solidarity as far as I know. Leader buffs other survivors speed, not your own.
---
Not sure how it's deserved, though.
---
Yes, so when they do heal you it goes faster. And wont last long because of your own progress.
---
If they are injured they will tank the chainsaw hit though
---
Lmfao can we get a darn for him?
---
Hm now I wonder if the post above you was your killer and your mad at him XD
---
Yeah, I called and told my boss to let our clients know I was bringing some insta-heals and gloves and instead she just told me to stay home. We were running a 3 man and didnt want anyone else to dc from sickness.

---
Do you think the perk right now is balanced? It is just shit, nobody uses it, nobody thinks it is good.
---
It wouldn't be mad house at all. Did you ever play with the perk? You would quickly realize how bad it is. 
---
Two survivors need to be injured and they both need to find each other for it to even have an effect. Even if you run Empathy to find another injured survivor the distance you need to cover to get to him even makes you lose time overall. 
---
I never get hit by noed. Yawn
---
&gt;About SwF and 4x, that’s why I’ve been saying to wait it out. FFS this perk hasn’t even been out for a week and people already are saying it’s op. We should wait for tech or strats against the perk.
---
Why though? It's not some abstract concept, SWF and stacking perks and items already exists. DBD isn't that complex dude, how difficult is it to consider how problematic 3-4 extra health states with an avoidable downside is to killer gameplay?

Yes, it does. I'm missing your point though?
---
I was wondering when someone would make this edit. 
---
 this happens to me too
---
I didn't even see the post lmao thanks for bringing it to my attention
---
LOL you must not play much or you do not play Survivor.  It is impossible to play thousands of hours and to never have gone down to NOED 1 time.

He cuts off the nose then takes out a finger somehow
---
In a normal chase there isn't anything you can do.
---
Rancor is a late game perk and only work on obsession AND you are assuming the target is full health. If they are injured they will still live.
---
This is how freddy sees that perk
---
They should just increase their ms to 115% and stabbing you and the meter depleting brakes you. you have to cleanse the bleed at first aid stations. When you do Legion can use the first aid station to get dirty needles which they can throw at an arc in front of them injuring one health state. I think the duration of the power should last around 60secs.
---
Also legion can use their power to stab pallets with knives( generates, hooks, vaults and other survivors) which makes you start bleeding if you interact with them.
---
Aaand DC.
---
No auto haven
---
wish that were true.
---
Im sure i play a lot more than you. Both sides. Promise. 
---
The fact that you think noed needs more changes than it already went through shows that much.
---
Probably how most M1 killers see that perk. On the other hand, if they're not obsession, it's free STBFL tokens. If they are though, well shit
---
-Dwight drops god pallet immediately into the chase while the trapper was at the window-
---
I actually hate the in-game Ash because I consider him annoying. 
---
1 vs. 4
---
The trapper can bypass it by trapping survivors &amp; picking them up - 1
---
Hillbilly can bypass via his chainsaw to insta-down survivors - 2
---
Myers can bypass it with tier 3 insta-down. Fair enough its situational as you mentioned. - 3
---
Huntress hatchets can bypass perk by not providing tokens. I can confirm this that only M1 attacks from any killer will count as a hit for the perk - 4
---
Cannibal can insta down with his chainsaw - 5 
---
Legion can bypass it with his frenzy. Using his power does not give the perk tokens &amp; forces the survivor to maintain the injured state meaning unless the MoM heals then the effect wont proc. - 6
---
Plague can bypass it with her vomit &amp; corrupt - 7
---
So overall around 7 killers have the ability to bypass the perks effect effectively making it for around half the killers. Fair enough it can be situational considering a Myers may not insta-down MoM or a hillbilly may choose to use his mallet instead of chainsaw but they have the option to avoid activating the perk.
---
LOL, unlikely if you are trying to say you have never gone down to NOED.  At least make up something believable
---
Ok? Not being injured isnt a bad thing. But if you werent healthy then yeah, its a great sounding perk and if I owned jane id use it.
---
Solidarity, empathy, leader, and an exhaustion perk. Just a small example. And before you say "you dont even have the perk", it honestly doesnt matter. Its straightforward and seems like it can really help save some time.
---
We can agree to disagree.
---
The old bnp didn't need to be nerfed. If a killer can hookthoy then kill you, then an instant Gen should be allowed. Especially since it's not every round which is what killers use to defend Morris. Old DS was also pretty useless unless you were the obsession thanks to the fact that there's always a hook up your ass as killer. And as for infinite loops, those needed to be nerf but you can't compare that to a perk with a one time use. Nice try, though. 
---
I wish i had the positivity of "thank god i can hit survivors more times so my STBL gets more stacks"
---
I didnt say i havent ever gone down to it.
---
I said i never go down to it.
---
As in like the last year. Maybe once or twice when im fucking around.
---
Dec2017 ok kid. Like i said, good faith. 
---
when someone downvotes you for the truth. GG. but i agree. people sometimes do.
---
I'll always be able to find that Meg. I won't be able to find you again cause you'll probably just be urban evading in a corner.
---
When I play killer, I main huntress first billy second. I have always believed that iri heads are too op if the user is at least semi competent, so I never run them. I think a cool concept for an UR gimmick addon would be to remove her humming and make her heartbeat 28 meters. This would allow for some more interesting huntress play, but not outright overpowered. 
---
No one would run that, sounds like plagues doodoo iris
---
I haven't played a ton of killer, but I haven't ran into it much. I've never used STBFL until recently, and it just feels fun to use. Extra stacks helps the fun factor
---
Eh define brutal?
---
1 vs. 4. Some of you all are being disingenuous as fuck in these MoM threads with your false equivalencies. 
---
But obviously you're just going to focus on noed. Like every other bad player does.
---
It’s the game telling you not to play legion.
---
Marth de-pip squad never went down to NOED. Git gud.
---
What.
---
You. I like you. It was essentially my first thought when I saw her in action. People won't care though, because you can still conventionally loop her for the most part, and that's the biggest issue people have with Legion outside of scummy shit like Moonwalking. You can't loop them in a conventional manner. They can just activate Feral Frenzy and hit you again. There's also the issue that mending isn't interactive in any way. It's similar to a lot of other Killer Powers that slow the game down for the Survivors, but at least when you're asleep/reverse bear trapped/sick/T3 Madness/etc... You have something to actively do, even if it's just a skill check, instead of just holding M1 for x amount of time.
---
I doubt that is true. Heck, Marth has gone down to NOED a lot recently
---
For solidarity I feel like 90% is just way too high. Would 75% make it more worthwhile? Also slippery meat? I take it youd use it on a pure luck build?
---
This is because MoM isn’t as strong as a perk if only one person is using it. Its the groups of people who all run with it. 
---
MoM is a momentum killer. You go from getting a hook and slowing the game down to chasing a survivor for another run. Not like you can run away from this survivor either since you’ve spent too much time on him and the time to abandon was long ago. 
---
The 99% self care thing is very annoying and I honestly think you shouldn’t be able to heal/have to heal to full before this perk activates. 
---
Fairly obvious the devs wanted this perk to be strong to increase profit on ash. MoM will never go up in the shrine. People want to downplay the power of this perk since it’s their new Decisive. 
---
Fair play, I’ll just piss survivors off even more and run Hillbilly every game. MoM only increases the frequency at which we will see the “annoying” killers. 
---
It's a shame but if it's shelter woofs or yamaoka estate I'll try to tunnel urban clauds out of the game first since I'll never see them again. 
---
Okay but like. That's the whole point of the perk where a very small window they get a powerful state.
---
There is nothing broken about it. You can do something about it. Even after its active.
---
It literally takes 20 seconds to open a gate. They are out a perk the entire game except for the last minute. Not even that if you play it right. There is absolutely nothing OP about that. 
---
The difference between MoM and pre-nerf DS was that Enduring reduced DS effectiveness by 75%. There isn't a perk for MoM.
---
This is a big problem with D/Cs and what I believe has created the disconnect epidemic.  This bug has been prevalent for a while and it makes it seem like the other party has disconnected.  This leads to it becoming part of the culture and giving people little objection in their mind to feel free to do it. It’s become such common place.  It furthers the killer vs survivor wrath and helps rile up a toxicity in a community that doesn’t need help in that regards. 
---
This is also why we’re not seeing d/c bans. BHVR is well aware of this bug and can’t decipher what’s on their end or the players.  I almost guarantee we won’t see any change until dedicated servers. 
---
Why?
---
“This is more fair than NOED” 
---
Lmao. NOED can be completely negated if you just stop being bad and cleanse totems.
---
I think it is fine. I really hate the push of the community to remove everything deemed "too strong", "too boring" etc. Playing against Iri Huntresses once in a while is a fun change of pace. As long as they aren't too common.
---
Probably unpopular but I personally wished they wouldn't have changed the Moris either. The only one I agreed with a little bit was insta gens but they were also overnerfed imo.
---
Never said that.
---
YOOO Pebble gang. I started running random perks when i stopped caring about rank and Pebble is by far the most fun
---
I'd be fine with it if they added a totem destroy noise or counter. Playing solo is a huge waste because you're always somehow the only person interested in doing it while you team crouches in corners (even at higher ranks ppl are garbage)
---
MoM can be completely negated by non M1 Killers, NOED, Make Your Choice, Iridescent Head, Moris, etc
---
That “negate one down” can literally give someone a free win. I’ve used netter if man and it usually works for me at the end of the game. About 3 times I should’ve been dead but because mom is such a bs perk it let me win. And by instadowns I assume you mean Michael, billy, and bubba. That’s the killers power. Prayer beads is not even that good, once they know you have it they won’t be fooled again if they have more than 5 hours in the game. Dude at least try those things, instadowns and prayer beads do not give you the win, it puts you at an advantage. Mom lets you win. By the way you said the last part, I can easily assume you are a survivor main, people that play billy 90% of the time are not tryharding, they are using a good killer that’s easy to play. At least play a little bit of killer before making a comment like this.
---
https://youtu.be/wKBmOhYI1TY 
---
It's at about the 3:50 mark. 
---
People can play however they want. But the term "tunneling" is typically used to describe killers that intentionally focus on only one survivor until they're dead. Again, killers can do this if they want, but I personally think it's lame. 
---
I'm not making this to ask for a rework, I'm making this because a rework will happen and wanted to give my 2 cents on it
---
I’ve tried all the free ones plus Cannibal and Spirit and Spirit was my favorite by far. I sucked at using chainsaws and hated Bubba and Billy. Wraith was much better, and Doctor was fun as well. I’ll admit I was a horrible nurse, and Trapper and Hag just weren’t fun for me. I liked the schoolgirl outfit for Spirit and bought her and the outfit I liked.  I also liked her backstory and pitied her - her story was more relatable to me.
---
As for actual gameplay, my friends said I was dumb for picking such a weak character classified as “hard” when I had little experience with the game. I don’t think she’s that weak though. She very quickly can reach a generator when it’s finished or someone fails a skill-check. Also, either some of the the survivors I’ve faced are dumb/hearing impaired or think she’s blind 100% of the time because they sometimes don’t run or keep working on a generator when she’s obviously right behind them. I also get far more hooks and kills with her. The screams of the hooked were so exciting when I first started to get decent at the game. Also, I can leave the hook and still search while watching it. When the hooked is unhooked, I can quickly return and at least slash either the previously hooked or the unhooker. It’s like camping without having to be too near the hook wasting time on the rare occasion no one saves them. I mostly get SWF groups (I guess we all do unless we play at odd hours?) so as soon as my terror radius is gone, someone runs over to unhook them.
---
Finally, it seems like I can see survivors better after looking down to break a pallets. I’m not sure why, because I always lost people playing with other killers, but they rarely get away when I’m using Spirit regardless of how many pallets they break or windows they leap through.
---
I could go on, but this is getting long. I love Spirit and doubt I’ll play anyone else unless another cute girl with a sad backstory is announced as the killer. Plague’s story was sad and she was likely pretty at one point, but I’d prefer not to vomit on people even in a game. Alright, stopping now.
---
A few tweaks and this could be pretty awesome. Great idea!!
---
So because it's a "consumable" means it's ok for it to be op lmao?
---
I have 32 ebonys on my billy, is it ok if I used all of those 32 games in a row that's perfectly fair and balanced just because I'm eventually gonna run out?
---
Oof, welp. This will be fun
---
We're talking about perks.
---
Yeah with Up the Ante and sometimes just slippery alone for fun in case I play against a Trapper...which never happens though.
---
75% would be a start. I doubt it would be good enough but at least a little better.
---
This is a fair point; probably the true reason.

Okay. But Mettle of Man activates when they are hit 3 times with a basic attack. Soo dealing with it during a chase is not likely till the later part of the game. You are going to mainly see this perk after the exit gates are powered or to help save survivors or to help counter major tunneling. 
---
If you use insta down perks, that is 1 hit. If they never heal full, you will put them on death hook before the perk activates. 
---
I was playing spirit last night and never saw Mettle of Man activate on account of my Make Your Choice perk. The Ash survivors I saw were the ones doing the saving, so I could just down them in 1 hit.
---
It was on my queue on steam. I watched Ohmwrecker videos to see gameplay
---
 First experience with the game and Ohm.
---
My bro was a fan and watched him play it and even tried it out myself. Had to get it after the Saw chapter came out and been hooked ever since (pun intended?)
---
Right! Legion too, absolutely. I had that on my other post, should have checked.
---
Plague and basic T3 Myers don't actually count as they still add stacks, so you're one bodyblock, rescue from slug, or solid chase from preventing them counter-playing it. Functionally, they can natively prevent it by downing you a third time when you've gotten your third stack.
---
Trapper also is iffy functionally, but he definitely can avoid it, so he counts. Far as Huntress, I've been seeing people get tokens sometimes from it, so I'd assume that's a glitch.
---
With that in mind, there's probably about three tiers of Killers against specifically countering this perk:
---
- [Natively through Power does not give stacks.]
---
Easy: Hillbilly, Cannibal, Huntress, Legion, Trapper.
---
- [Through Exposed and Broken Effects, functionally countering it.]
---
Intermediate: Myers, Plague, Trapper, Clown. (exposed bottles)
---
- [Through using an interrupt action in all three chases, or exposed perk]
---
 Hard: Everyone else.
---
True. I knew I wasn't going to name all the perks that give the expose status effect.
---
I'm starting to wonder if this sub has any form of moderation.
---
I'm not saying all of those are OP individually. But you can't deny, at all, that that build is too strong. 
---
Or the killer just chainsaws the saver and makes half your perks totally useless lol
---
I knew something was off.
---
How come I have never faced against you? Sounds like it would be a fun chase.
---
All leathefaces I play against are brainless as fuck and always respect pallets then camp at the end to secure a kill
---
This guy literally just took someone else's work.
---
Get used to it with this guy. He argues by focusing 1 aspect of your responses, quotes it, and then goes on a rant about it while ignoring every other point you make.
---
Didn't you hear? They made it one VS one now cuz survivors were too OP. LoL.. 
---
Agreed had one last night like this, he was doing it all and the moon walk bs right behind me, after a few mins I DC and will continue to do so against any legion. They won’t fix him so fuck BhVR and people wanna abuse these exploits so fuck them too!
---
Don't be sorry, you did good 
---
Dead hard might not be OP but its annoying as fuck. For example, when a survivor is heading to a pallet, and you know you will be able to hit them before they get there, they can just press their E key and extend the chase for another minute.
---
Survivor is extremely easy and straight up relaxing if you don't get someone who camps or tunnels
---
Yeah but when you do it can be a nightmare, although when I’m killer I try to be fair 
---
Cnib
---
Right. 
---
My only argument is that DH isn’t OP. Most players don’t know how to use it. 
---
Dead Hard is shit in that scenario, however it is godly in loops where if you get some extra distance and extend the loop for another minute.
---
I actually started watching Jojo’s recently did lol
---
What are they supposed to do? Um, deal with it? That's like me asking "What are survuvird supposed to do about sloppy butcher, rancor, etc" Perks don't NEED a counter lol 
---
????
---
I don't even run Ruin in my Trapper builds because it's so anti-fun. My matches are extremely difficult and go by insanely fast because of how easy survivors have it, especially if the're in SWF
---
Np
---
"The killer is able to alter 3 Gens"
---
"... failing the skillcheck reduces the progress to 0"
---
--&gt; this is Overcharge, Pop goes the Weasle, Huntress Lullaby and Thanatophobia on Steroids. For just 3 gens, only 3 Skillchecks, with the drawback to give then some % if they hit it.
---
Still. Bringing a 50-80% gen down to 0 in one instant seems good. 
---
Ouch. That's pretty harsh.
---
It's literally impossible to be in red ranks if you camp. You can't even get a pip sometimes at green ranks if you 3K. But sure, people camp at red ranks lmao
---
Yeah but like, when you get fired up you get angrier so it would be fire down.
---
Yea exactly haha I was extremely happy to finally see a new survivor perk that I will use often outside of meme builds.
---
r/Gaming had a post about a game where you could play as Michael Meyers, Freddy and the Pig. That intrigued me so I bought a Humble Bundle. I keep trying other games and end up coming back... guess the fog has me.
---
&gt; I think it is fine. I really hate the push of the community to remove everything deemed "too strong", "too boring" etc. 
---
Yet killer mains keep asking for every survivor perk like adrenaline or MoM to get gutted? 
---
That could be true and its odd hearing people do it against spirit bc she's scary as hell
---
While I disagree with saying that a perk isnt OP because people don't know how to use it, I'm fully agreed on the fact that 99% of people use dead hard wrong lmao.
---
I saw it on steam the day after release and thought “yo that names lit”
---
I had 20€, did 0 research on the game and just went with my gut and well... I have about 2100hrs on this game so my gut was right xD
---
Mr. Nicemare
---
Stretch Armstrong killer confirmed? 
---
This thread is great. Love the banter 
---
Cote is in there like 8 times, the screenplay was written by That One Guy Who Wrote the Dbd Lore, and the Entity directed this film.
---
This deserves more likes
---
Dead hard is countered by thinking. That’s why I say it’s OP. 
---
If a healthy survivor isn’t in the safest of places, they aren’t going to get to the “minute-extending” loop spots. Survivors with dead hard won’t always be in these spots. 
---
-except Crotus. Fuck that map. Doesn’t matter where you are on it, if your thumb isn’t in your butt, you can usually make it back to that middle building shithole. 
---
Try playing Trapper or any low tier killer at Rank 1. Oh wait, you can't because you're not a rank 1 killer, and you never will be.
---
Survivors need a quiter bonus. Also. Try putting this to “We’re number 1” I feel it would fit perfectly 
---
It may not be better than other options available to you but if you really think about it its mathematically good and balanced.
---
Instead of two people healing each other for 32 total seconds at base you instead heal for 24 seconds total of both players with 16 for the first heal and 8 for the second...that gives you 8 seconds each to work on a gen instead or do something else. Typically if you heal near a gen that's 16 seconds or about 1/8th of a gen
---
If you were to make it any better now you have 16 seconds per survivor at 100% to put in a gen. If you're hiding or searching for gens it isnt good but if you know what you're doing and where you're going that's pretty broken. It makes healing way too strong again.
---
What kind of rank 20 gets juked this hard on a L wall T wall
---
Make it so it affects killers with one shot abilities too and I'll be very happy. 
---
So your suggestion to counter MoM is to stop playing low tier killers and keep playing Billy/Nurse? Sounds good to me.
---
My dude the game is made so that there is 1 vs 4 in mind. When things get balanced they keep that fact in mind. Rancor only works on obsession because it would be way too overpowered if it could work on more than one guy. 
---
&gt; Seen pigs trap people in the basement with traps on their heads 
---
What's wrong with that?
---
ISNT THAT JUST A FART
---
People who complain about MoM do they even play the same game? If y'all want to complain then you should look at all the broken shit killers have. Survivors were overpowered 1 year ago when pallet vacuums, exhaustion recovery while running, double pallets, infinites, decisive etc. were a thing. Survivors are not overpowered now and 1 single perk is not gonna change that.
---
It's just a shit perk and shouldn't be in the game. But people that main one side couldn't care less, they just want a kewl perk.
---
Leave it in, in fact put more perks in that take skill out of the game. Then we can all watch this dumpster fire of a game die.
---
I wanna hear him say "shoot first,think never" everytime he flashlight stuns a killer.
---
&gt; If a healthy survivor isn’t in the safest of places, they aren’t going to get to the “minute-extending” loop spots. Survivors with dead hard won’t always be in these spots.
---
Depends on the map tbh. If its Coldwind, Ormond, or like you said Crotus, they should be able to get to a loop, but on a map like Pale Rose they will struggle.
---
Shots fired at the end lol.
---
Give the survivor Broken for the rest of the trial, and I'll call it balanced.
---
match wasn't going well so they did all the gens but there was 2 people left at the end and I managed to kill them since they were being dumb and both on last hook
---
Sounds pretty weak tbh. Doesn’t give him any map pressure, barely slows the game down, and doesn’t help with downing survivors. It would kind of help with tracking, but there are single perks that do a better job than the entire power. 
---
When legion slices through the ether to hit you
---
That would be amazing.
---
TTK is too slow compared to the flow some SWF groups dictate, they should add more objectives like instructions to how to repair a generator instead of straight up being able to repair it. Then they should add actually useful perks to mitigate the increased time to escape, not overly situational garbage which seems to be the trend nowadays. I'm hoping that after the optimization and dedicated server they'll look into it.
---
Rip the thiccness 
---
Survivors would have just DC’d anyway. Franks mixtape alone is enough to make most quit.
---
I am very concerned on the logic Spirit Fury is the best killer perk. I prefer using the other 2 Spirit perks over Spirit Fury. Plus with Spirit Fury you need to pair it with Enduring, wasting 2 perk slots. And it really doesn't apply to killers like Nurse, Hag, or Huntress.
---
But for MoM I find MYC has been a fantastic perk to help deal with it. It honestly isn't that bad of a perk. Just hurts Wraith and Freddy which were already on the bottom tier anyway. 
---
The downside is avoidable, but avoiding it puts you at the same position that you were at before, injures. Again, not only do you moan and bleed without IW, but the 3 hits you put yourself in to get the perk activated is basically worthless. Items like insta-heal shouldn’t work with it, I agree, but the perk already has a significant downside to it. Nerfing it alongside the possibility of a counter yet to be discovered would make it another useless perk amongst the dozens.
---
*Make it so it only affects one shot abilities. That way low-tier m1 killers like trapper and wraith aren't punished, while Billy and iridescent head Huntress have some new counterplay.
---
Why are you repeating yourself?

My hatred for him is like a thousand suns. 
---
I played against a clown with discordance and I never even thought that he had it since no one uses it usually.
---
Just because MoM is a thing doesn’t mean you have to be THAT big of an ass. Lmao. 
---
I could run insta saw Billy but there’s a fine line.
---
LOL it's cute that you think the game will die because of killers leaving when it's actually the survivor mains that are leaving because we've getting gutted every single patch for over a year now (with this new perk being the **sole** exception).
---
That's why killer queues are shit
---
Is there a list of the bugged add-ons? I'm having a lot of fun with Legion (because i suck at loops) but i don't want to make it more miserable than it already is for the survivors :)
---
Just the typical case of killers mains whining cause it’s an inconvenience. Survivors finally get a perk that isn’t complete garbage. So, boohoo.
---
I'm not gonna unhook someone when you're standing there bub. I'l also not going to stay in a game against a Legion longer than I have to, I wanna have fun too.
---
*"They wanted to make an OP perk on ash to sell more dlc's and make more money."*
---
*\^*This one.
---
The devs aren't as dumb as they appear to be. As soon as this perk was leaked everyone knew it would be a problem, surprisingly though it's even worse than everyone suspected because people were assuming the non-obsessions would get a lesser version but they didn't.
---
End of the day survivors are just skins. Why would someone who has P3'd Claudette for the +100 to stealth and got all the perks on here change to another survivor just because he says "groovy"? Why would someone who has hundreds of cosmetics on Meg go through the long grind again? especially for a survivor who will probably end up with less cosmetics in the end. Fact is they probably won't.
---
So it doesn't matter if it's a popular license or not ,the fact is that its the perks that are going to sell the DLC, and with this being survivor only content they were probably a little uncertain about how much money it would make, especially considering it's licensed. So they threw in a busted perk to sell it.
---
It's profits over balance with this company. I don't know why anyone would support them anymore. On top of that we've been waiting for hundreds of issues fixed since the engine update all the way back in December and so far we've still got pretty much fuck all.
---
It's just a shit development studio and they deserve all of the shit thrown at them.
---
I’m sticking up for you. I was directing that towards BillMurrie who ignores everything and says the same thing repeatedly and then blames you for not listening.
---
and you can't slug MoM, can't dribble, and there's no nerf to the non-obsession version.
---
they say that but we will see
---
har har har fuck you funny
---
damm, Well imo the perk still isn't overpowered, It's one use and extremely situational, people are gonna see it as op when swf abuses it tho, which really sucks because the sweaty tryhards ruin it for all of us who want fun perks that are actually good.
---
I see. Just be civil, all you can do I suppose.
---
As far as MoM goes, I personally feel like its wayyy too strong against a 4 man. Just my experience though.
---
balanced landing players when haddonfield gets picked
---
Omg Kate yassss 
---
Survivor gets a meta perk for the first time in 2 years, ofc it should be nerfed. Show me them statistics on Killer's avg time-to-catch in the days when DS strike was introduced VS today. "I DC on maps that have more than the 8 minimal pallet spawns and aren't 90% deadzone."
---
As a solo main, eat shit baby mains. You just got 2 strong perks that delay the game/help catch from Plague.
---
Self care has saved my ass a stupid amount of times.
---
Yeah it is Killers are about 1:2.5 or 1:3 so queues are about 5-10 times as long (It only works on PC and this is all PC stuff)
---
I don’t think it needs a buff. It’s a niche perk that works in many builds. Use it with lithe and qnq and it’s pretty much a free escape every time.
---
It already has one, are you retarded?
---
The icons near your username would be nice
---
Meg has nice eyes wtf
---
The fact that devs joked about an extra health state for April fools shows that they are aware its ridiculous. I like your idea though. It needs a strong downside or a prerequisite that you work for.
---
1) A lot of those nerfs were needed. Pallet vac, exhaustion etc
---
2) I wouldn't be against a survivor buff at all. Not sure exactly why but they were getting whooped the past month. However it should have been a good buff. Decrease the healing times a little bit, give free kindred, things that help them enjoy the game more like less time holding M1, more info against campers or accidental farming, throwing in a perk that just gives them a free hit was totally the wrong way to go about it and it makes the game less fun for the other side.
---
Nerf claudette
---
That's one survivor. What about the others? Just not sure how you're jumping to a 4K from one person using MoM.
---
Even for that one survivor, that assumes they've healed to full health since the perk activated, which means that they've probably found another survivor, or are running self-care as well (requiring at least one teachable). They could be carrying a medkit too, which is possible, but less common.
---
Except old DS had no counter unless the killer ran an obsession perk too. MoM has a built in negative and can be countered. It needs tweaking and some minor nerfs.
---
I wish that the range was 33 meters on her.
---
I imagine it doesn’t take into account SWF differences. 
---
Having a killer with 3 people in lobby makes queues awful. 
---
LITERALLY FUCK ME DUDE. FIRST GAME OF THE DAY AND 3 OF MY TEAMMATES DIE TO A TIER 3 MICHAEL IN 10 SECONDS I CANT BELIEVE WHAT IM SEEING
---
Jesus. Bit extreme lol.
---
You're an idiot. Go learn about game balance.
---
Self-care and Ruin were so common that yeah they probably needed to be looked at. It just felt like a waste of a perk slot at the end. When both sides constantly take 2 perks because they feel they're NEEDED then you know something is wrong.
---
There already is a condition though, what else would you suggest?
---
This is a repost 
---
I sleep...
---
the 2 blade add-ons are the bugged ones. Nasty Blade and Filthy Blade, the ones that increase the amount of time to mend.
---
Didnt you know you're supposed to let the survivors escape?
---
LITERALLY DUDE I HOOK SOMEONE AND CLAUDETTES COME FROM THE SHADOWS TO SAVE LIKE SOME FUCKING BIRDS. DID WE FORGET IM THE SCARY ONE HERE? IGET REWARDED WITH TWERKING AT THE EXIT GATES WHILE I FEEL INSECURE ABOUT MY LIFE. FRICK.
---
We cry about everything? Killers have consistently been getting amazing perks and 0 survivors have complained. Survivors get ONE good perk finally, and all killer mains are crying over it. Just scroll through the sub and you'll see it, lol. Killer mains are so hypocritical. 
---
So you are saying the game continues with an AFK player? That is a team game thing. That would not work in DBD, it's far better to just end the game, yet still recieve the points for it, survivors wouldn't want to finish out a game with an AFK killer every time a killer DC's.
---
Saw it in the store saw gameplay and thought thats badass
---
The perk can work with some builds, so I don't think it needs a buff atm.  
---
I think there are plenty of other survivor and killer perks that need a buff like Left Behind, No One Left Behind, Head On, This is Not Happening, Hangman's Trick, Fire Up, Territorial and more.
---
&gt; 80 to 85% chance now 
---
Lmao would love to see where you get these stats from
---
my wife and i play almost every day (PC), and we see disconnects in about every other or third game. sometimes our game crashes and it registers in the match as a "disconnect"
---
happened to me while i was opening a gate. i was bummed
---
Too weak or too strong and what would you buff or nerf
---
Shhh I've gotten better at skill checks. Now I only do it when other people are with me and the pressure is on to not miss them 
---
Couldn’t give you one. 
---
Getting hit three times isn’t super unrealistic. If you never get hit three times, it’s either because you’re getting 1 hooked or escaping. This is playing against M1 killers. 
---
And yes, billy can become an M1 killer.
---
Yeah it's like the answer for a couple of problems is sitting there in perks. Then just make it so that the perks buff the thing that they correlate to. Or just rework them entirely and give ruin and self care/sabo to free up a perk slot so we can atleast have some build diversity and have it be viable.
---
pretty much the same here. had so much fun with F13 when it first came out, then it slowly went to complete shit, so we went looking for a similar alternative.
---
Its less potentially and more 80% chance of at least 2 boosted team members. If they made the rank system work at all, or just have some incentive to stay at high ranks then I wouldn't mind boosted team members that much. Hell they could just make survivors get a similar amount of blood points to killers and I wouldn't care about the games flaws as much.
---
Getting a team of idiots, doing more than the rest of them combined, then getting 1 hooked, de-pipping, and getting 9k bloodpoints is just really, really insulting and makes me not want to play the game at all.
---
I love you OP
---
Do it 
---
u/vreddit_bot 
---
I would just change it so that you are protected against one shots. Still super powerful, still could give survivors free escape, but not as bad.
---
Good survivor mains arent using self care
---
It’s actually coming late summer, I believe. 
---
The entity doesn't allow survivors to have weapons in its realm.
---
yup, can confirm this is the new norm for the last week for me at least.
---
I think they should make insta-heals not work with MoM and one tap Self Care shouldnt exist either. 
---
You can see it on the pictures I posted of me. 
---
THIS GAME ISN’T FUN FOR KILLERS. THAT’S WHY YOUR QUEUES ARE SO LONG.
---
FUCKING LERYS FUCKIMG ME OVER MOTHERFUCKER 5 GENS AND I FUCKING EVEN NEVER HIT ANYBODY FUCK AND I NVERER SEAN ANYONE MOTHERFUCKERS
---
Yeah but OP didn't attack his opinion. He just said that he shouldn't quote him out of context.
---
I don't know if BillMurrie only argues in favor of the killer but if he does then he is probably biased (at least according to you).
---
fuck i have to remember the new meeting of MoM because for a second I thought Master of Masters from Kingdom hearts got added as a killer. 
---
I was the guy who made the other shitshow MoM post. I just want us all to get along and compromise but I know it won’t happen.
---
Their salt was from their failure. You only apply pressure where you find them, so smart survs learn to draw you off. Amazing how it is on the killer to compromise when survs gen themselves into a corner. 
---
You play the way you want to play, honestly. Anything else is community-made rules. Every “rule” made by the community often has a mechanical consequence, although this particular one does not. Is it scummy? Maybe. Is it the survivors’ fault for letting it come to that? More often than not, yes. 
---
Tl;dr you do whatever you need to, to win. 
---
Hey, Myers Jacksoooon! I just saw this picture and recognized it immediately, too, ahahah! It's our match together: impossible to forget thrill and laughs you gave me! &lt;3 XD 
---
MAYBE IF PLAYING AS A KILLER DIDNT COMPLETELY SUCK ASS, PEOPLE WOULD PLAY MORE
---
I don't think there is a lack of anything. I have quick killer lobbies and [near instant survivor lobbies](https://gfycat.com/heartyposhcommabutterfly).
---
These look really good, tou should try many different colors like orange, the old brown. Gold (if that can work)
---
Yeah the meme is crying that people don't like Trump
---
Doesn’t that make the perk pointless?
---
Really the survivors could have spread out the work and not left the last three gens to be rotated on but still they could have worked on some and hid when you came back nearby and then continued to work on it until you went away. Or someone be a decoy and leave tracks leading you to the other side of the map so they can work on gens. I mean there’s a couple different ways they could have gotten it done.
---
Being around this rank I’ve noticed ruin isn’t handled very well
---
He doesn't. OP is just whining that they get called out
---
From just playing the game dumbass lol
---
Ah, then I'm the one out of the loop. Sorry lol
---
I don’t consider it BM even if it’s done intentionally. I saw a post like this earlier this morning and I’m going to use the same analogy I used then (and before you call me a scummy killer main, I main surv)
---
In chess there’s a series of moves the first player can make that allows checkmate within 4 moves. Survivors yelling at the killer for using the three gen strat is like yelling at a chess player for using a 4 move checkmate even though the opponent shouldn’t have fallen for it. 
---
Survivors failing to see that you’re backing them into a corner or their inability to keep you distracted long enough for them to do gens in other areas is not the killer being scummy, it’s just the survivors being mad they fell for an obvious trap and not doing something about it.
---
SHOULD DO WHAT ME AND A BUNCH OF OTHER KILLERS ARE DOING IN RESPONSE:
---
STOP PLAYING.
---
And they also have to stab you 4 times and you can pallet stun them. The point is that if they don't exploit they still have to hit you.
---
"kIlLeR mAiN gUyZ"
---
WHAT SERVERS?
---
This is just like all the old "as a killer main I actually loved being hit by DS!!1!" posts
---
I contemplated on purchasing FT13 during its release, but then I saw DBD. I ended up buying both. No regrets to this day.
---
Why self care when you can bring a medkit?
---
He didn’t get called out, quite the opposite. It’s just frustrating to have real discussion with others and then Bill comes in and rags on about SWF and insta-heals which can be fixed.
---
Like montos
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/axe1b1/when_jane_uses_head_on/
---
Oof the English is horrible 
---
Today we crashed on the loading screen on 3 out of 8 games. Also there was one killer DC. Fun time. 
---
This is for discussion not ranting
---
Exactly. Combine MoM with Adrenaline, DS, Dead Hard, Borrowed Time, bodyblocks, and an insta-heal, and you aren't going to down that survivor anytime soon. 
---
reeee muh addons are too op 
---
Why do you need Enduring and Spirit Fury for Leatherface and Billy when you can break pallets almost instantly? Doctor can shock the survivor to prevent the pallet being thrown (if you have skill). Trapper and Hag can close the loop off completely with a trap. Clown has his bottle so you can close the gap and get the survivor before they get to the pallet. Plague has a ranged attacked when it is corrupted. Pig has the ambush trick if the survivor has no line of sight.
---
Plus, the only bad pallets are ones you cant mind game. Watch people like Tru3talent play killer. The mind games you can pull off usually closes the chase pretty quick. Just gotta know which pallets are "safe" for the survivor and which are not. I prefer Brutal Strength over Spirit Fury honestly.
---
Yeah lol. I try to play as fair as possible. But if there are 1-2 gens left and I dont have a kill, im gonna tunnel abit. 
---
Deadass this does sound cool as fuck but always new content makes me thing “is this going to be as cool in game? Or too op/weak?” I dont have enough exp to gauge it. 
---
Honestly what i imagined if a werewolf was introduced would be for the devs to flip the script—
---
We anticipate a werewolf would be a killer but more often than not killers are released in pairs w/ a survivor and map. 
---
And what could we commonly pair with a werewolf? Yeah a damsel in distress type could work. Or a *werewolf hunter.* it sounds bonkers but what if we had a werewolf survivor and then like a buff af like van helsing kinda killer. 
---
It's a strategy, did it for the first time yesterday and got face camped, rightfully so, got 4-5 blinds off before he caught me
---
I imagined the meme as making fun of both sides, survivors a little more than killers tbh.
---
Omg 😂😂😂
---
Despite what some people say, its in the best shape its ever been in with the most balance it has ever had right now.
---
I have a shirtless myers now... 🤔
---
Toxic is a playstyle. Not an item. 
---
Flashlight blinding is largely ineffective if the killer has his headset on and can hear sound. If anything, it puts you at a disadvantage since you’re losing ground. If you can gain benefit from putting yourself at a disadvantage, go for it. 
---
Play how you want. Flashlight clicking is toxic. Using the item isn’t. 
---
im just a sick fuck that need an outlet 
---
It really doesn’t come off that way, but whatever floats your boat henny
---
Furry shit, us weebs aren’t THAT low yet
---
Idk about this either tbh, because then it just promotes bloodlusting M1 bois. And bloodlust chasing is some of the least entertaining gameplay on either end.
---
True, maybe because I was the Doctor, they thought it was intentional. I did have Overcharge but then again, my doctor doesn’t have many options as I rarely play him.
---
Basically someone looped me in the same general area several times, and because I was there chasing, the 3 nearby gens were left alone. Once that happened, someone would try to bait me out of there and I would chase, I certainly didn’t care to stick around and camp them. But as soon as they got downed and hooked, I’d check the gens and they weren’t even touched.
---
RIP
---
&gt;That’s a very niche scenario though
---
I don't know what rock you've been living under, but all of those perks are meta. 
---
I agree with the insta-heals not working and one tap healing (should be healing in general, not just Self Care) not working, though. 
---
I don't think We'll Make It needs a buff either. I think it is actually a well done and cool perk but not too strong/annoying either.
---
Even with selfcare being less meta. Two injured survivors meeting each other at all is already a rather rare occurence overall except maybe against legion. If only one of the two survivors is injured then Solidarity doesn't do anything. To do it effectively I feel like you would have to run empathy but then you need to be injured as well and be close to the other guy for it to be efficient.
---
I definitely think it could be buffed and even then people wouldn't use it over meta perks.
---
Probably have to agree to disagree here.
---
YES
---
Why wouldn't they be preaching the message of this meme. It's common sense. 
---
Not toxic at all.  People need to learn the difference between toxic and annoying/strong game mechanic. Personally, I love getting blinded at pallets. It wastes more of their time than mine. 
---
Is bloodlust even a thing to be worried about any more?! If Freddy can only hit me because he bloodlusts me, MoM is not even gonna get the stacks.
---
MoM’s issue is it weakens the weak killers, whereas stronger killers remain strong. This aims to reverse that.
---
I’m happy to hear this. I didn’t do it intentionally at all and when a survivor baited me out of there, I was more than happy to chase and let the others try to do one in time. They were def a SWF all DCing at once but I was surprised they didn’t hop on a gen whenever I left.
---
Also, Happy Cake Day! 
---
I want the game to be balanced, and for killers to not need hand holding perks that give them free auto downs, free pallet breaks, free aura reads and not one for where solo survivors are repeatedly shat on on by tunneling camping killers. If you have a problem with that, I repeat: get bent.
---
DS and BT can be ignored by not camping and/or tunneling. Insta-heal is bullshit, adrenaline popping during chase is just lucky (solo queue) and MoM can’t be countered at full health with an M1 killer but that person willingly took the aura risk and does actually need changes. And I don’t have any doubt that survs will run some of these perks, they are meta after all. 
---
Sometimes I get nervous 
---
Don't be so passive-aggressive, it's not a good look. You can reply to my post directly if you take issue with anything I said, otherwise I'll leave you to your circle jerk....
---
&gt;I am a killer main sitting at rank 5 at the time I post this
---
Says the guy whose first account activity was from three hours ago....
---
I would love that tbh.
---
Thanks, and it’s definitely on them. Too many folks complain about situations they’re responsible for :)
---
Jesus, it is not that bad of a perk. Clearly overreacting over something that won't change anything until the late game. Run perks that give the MoM survivors the exposed status effect. The perk only gives the survivor the invul ability after 3 M1 hits AND they need to be injured. All insta down attacks will just put them down. Run Make Your Choice, Hex: Hallowed Ground, or hell just use Rancor. MoM already an obsession perk. If you get to the end game, mori them 
---
Throw Cannibal up there, too.
---
Funny story, I use STBFL and my Obsession was a Ash, and with all 8 STBFL Tokens, I decided to chase him.
---
I hit him once, he drops a pallets and Insta-Heals.
---
I hit him a seconds time to injure him.
---
I hit him a third time but the uses MoM.
---
Then I hit him for the fourth and final time, finally putting him into the dying Health State. Just to realize he ate all my STBFL Tokens.
---
Sad times.
---
Look at his eyes
---
When I play survivor I do this to make it so the killer doesn’t know where I’m going as well, but when this happens to me as a killer it’s super annoying.
---
Part of the strategy survivors NEED to do, is not leave the remaining gen's close together. And if they do, and then blame the killer for only needing to walk around 20 feet, then they're morons. Survivors only objective = fix gens... Killers only objective = kill everyone before they fix gens... It's as simple as that. 
---
Blinding a killer while they are stuck in an animation is fair game.  I mean if I know you have a flashlight and I'm kicking this pallet then I sort of expect you to blind me for doing it, I'd do the same as survivor.
---
The only thing I find somewhat annoying is constantly clicky clicky trying to just annoy me until I chase.  Which I'll generally ignore but it's still annoying.
---
The aura reading is pointless at high ranks. You know damn well they want you to chase lol.
---
Medkit cant do trick if no more charged
---
Just when you think haddonfield can’t get more survivor sided. Now they got low gravity tiles
---
I play solo only (I find people on xbox to be annoying, also im pretty introverted). If the killer doesn't have ruin its basically gg. However, alot of the time my team are complete potatoes lol. 
---
Noed usually isnt a problem because I run small game.
---
This is gonna get removed. 
---
Yeah it's really concerning that can happen. Not to mention gens have been noticeably faster lately and totems still spawn out in the open next to gens
---
I did this a lot around the time LF came out
---
Distressing/Unnerving Presence/Overcharge and BBQ because those games always gave a shitton of BP. Ruin instead of BBQ for maximum annoyance.
---
On some maps with good gen placement there is little the survivors could do especially if you killed one guy before you have to defend your 3 gens. 
---
It is really annoying to play against a Doctor who does this but it is a good strategy with him.
---
Yee, Chili's information is worthless IMO but killer needs more BP because of add-ons, so I run Chili as base. I really wish I could have more perk versatility. I also never take WGLF off on survivor. I'd definitely support this.
---
The cake is a lie.
---
 Not OP to certain killers but the weaker killers it really punishes them. 
---
Yep. Every killer I played against today had Ruin. Luckily for me, most of them lost it in the first minute and then gens got popped like crazy. It was less fun when I was the Wraith who lost Ruin early and then lost 3 gens within seconds of each other though, haha.
---
In my experience (from both sides), games where Ruin stays up are more likely to end with 3 or 4 dead survivors and games where it isn’t an issue end with 3 or 4 survivors escaping. 
---
I don’t think body blocking is reportable 
---
Perks are the least important thing. Its mainly about the map and what killer it is. 
---
It only really happens if the survivors don’t watch what gens they are doing. 
---
Deliverance is worth it so why not. 
---
It is when you can’t move for 20 minutes. 
---
Ehh. I personally believe it’s due to the fact that survivors can only get smarter and better while killers can only play “better” killers. Sure, one can do mind games but realistically, it’s not as impactful as learning to loop. 
---
Once survivors learn to loop, almost every killer is at the hand of the survivor. The killer will win eventually, but a good looper can waste a lot of time. 
---
Usually I would only have to use a medkit once or twice.It’s better to use what you need in most situations,than using something like unbreakable in rarer cases.
---
Imagine using Cannibal chainsaw against good survivors.
---
I can't. 
---
Heh, nice. Half-Life reference.
---
Happy rl cakeday to you, Makayla! Hope you're having a birthday matching this cake's awesomeness!
---
I'm a mothertucker, what can I say?
---
Imo its a waste of time at high ranks. 99% of the time I can hear where they run. The only thing I consider toxic is the end game hatemail.
---
I disagree. I would say the ability to take 3.5-4.5 hits after bodyblocking shenanigans is both more annoying, and viable if they don't all rush to proc it at the same time for a meme. (Bodyblock to try and force M1's on any killer that could counter, build stacks, take a hit, Dead Hard, Hit, Insta, Hit, Hit. Add looping in the middle of all of these.)
---
It's not even meme territory, or hard to do. I've been doing it solo to gross effect today.
---
I didn't know I needed this until I saw it just now. 
---
I've had a ton of times you blind someone crouch nearby they head off in the wrong direction. This builds way more time than me running to the next pallet. Doesnt matter headphones or anything else. Something that works to help you win chases is strategic. 
---
Lol imagine being this passive-aggressive. 
---
Not sure if I love this because it's so great, or if I hate it because he's holding the flashlight in the wrong hand.
---
Did he hit you
---
It really only messes up Wraith and Freddy on account they have nothing outside the chase and smack the survivor with the M1. But getting the MoM target the exposed effect will not make it that bad.
---
But to counter argue, Make Your Choice counters Borrowed Time :). Also is really good on Spirit
---

---
Its pretty much impossible to have reliable data to argue on this if you want to take this seriously. An item stays and item, and they are like « extras » that shouldnt fully be part of the main strategy as theyre hardly reliable (unless you run pharmacy to refill your medkit stock). Overall it depends what youre replacing self care with, as there are obviously better choices it doesnt mean everyone has them or that these perks goes well with their playstyle
---
Please tell me you're joking lol.
---
Flashlights are useless now. With the shorter pick up time, they're so easy to avoid. 
---
He's getting bodied in the other MoM threads and just called me out by name.
---
Myers is new Ricardo Milos
---
Plague: PLAG
---
Not until the last gen was done and noed activated
---
Oh man if only he had come out sooner 😂
---
Yes I’m having a great day (aside from it raining earlier!) Thank you!
---
uh its faster if i do gens by myself
---
Hey OP about that whole Ricardo milos, I see a lot of space there in the background
---
The shit shouldn't have been introduced to begin with. But as for how I would balance it - as soon as you're hit for the third time, you can't heal yourself/or be healed by another person until after your next hook. If you don't end up getting hit again in the trial, or if your next hook is your death hook you can't heal yourself or be healed for the rest of the game.
---
I'm happy to help 
---
But you guys are pretending that we shouldn't consider stacking and SWF coordination when we talk about perk balance. You're being disingenuous. You just hand-wave away the idea that it can enter the meta, the downsides can be completely mitigated by 99%'in the heal, and that 3-4 of them cause similar problems that DS did. 
---
I don't have a model for him unfortunately 😂
---
So the killer hooked you after? If so then the game wasnt held hostage. If you dc'd because of it and the game was well over, then yeah thats a problem. Not condoning his behaviour but if he killed you then it wasnt held hostage.
---
U (don’t) got that
---
Glad to hear! Enjoy!
---
Imagine doing exactly what everyone in this sub expected you to do and trying to blame the OP
---
"Edited by hotrod mccoolguy" You legend 
---
He doesn't have to be high-tier, just on the list. Trapper should be up there too, honestly.
---
That's part of it as well.
---
Body blocking is not reportable, however holding the game hostage is. This is holding the game hostage. Body blocking is taking a hit to prevent a hook. Holding a game hostage is cornering, or preventing a player from moving for extended periods of time
---
I am biased, and I do not always argue in favor of the killer. I don't know how transparent I can be past admitting that I generally empathize with killer gameplay and issues more than I do from the survivor perspective. That being said, you can view my post history on MoM and decide for yourself if I've been disingenuous in my arguments. 
---
Why did you do a complete 360 with your answer? Lol. Well in that case it still isnt reportable. The dc is though.
---
He held me hostage for 20 minutes in the top floor. 
---
What? I love Half-Life.
---
Im hoping, and this is from a killer, that they some how rework NOED. Its waaaay too much of a crutch right now, and hopefully they can find a way to change it for the better like DS.
---
It’s annoying, not toxic. They’re two different things.
---
so basically put tenacity on with his 3 perks and be dummy altruistic
---
aiight chief i'll give it a whirl

---
Well your previous response said that he hit you with NOED. So your team took 20 mins to finish gens? Honestly you just seem upset about being trapped for abit.
---
I have enough medkits to last me a while.If you want the best load out then self-care shouldn’t be the perk to run.While I agree self-care is good for inexperienced players,experienced players are better off with a medkit.
---
Did you see the trailer for ash it was beautiful 
---
Because it breaks the rules maybe?
---
Legion is good though cause he wastes the survivor's time
---
Yeah. That’s a reportable offense, and not an ok thing for the killer to do. 
---
Idk, I dont see this perk any more annoying than Dead Hard. Had a SWF the other day that all ran Dead Hard, Borrowed Time, and Adrenaline. Adrenaline was the one that made me upset. I would've proced the MoM ability long before the last gen popped in that game due to how many hits I did.
---
I dont trust you. 
---
THICCCCCCCCCCC Jane
---
There's a reason that Nurse and Billy are the only killers who don't NEED ruin for a game to function.  They can both get hooks rolling so quickly that pressure is on from their existence alone.  Every other killer can be looped to hell and back, billy can be looped but can also cross the map in seconds and can saw you down if he suddenly charges across the map and catches you in a bad position.  Nurse is...  Nurse.
---
Make your Choice doesn't have any interaction with Borrowed Time, it just heavily incentivizes avoiding hard camping and tunneling.
---
Huh. Imagine being the kind of person who needs /s in order to recognise jokes.
---
Yeah, the ability to quickly get to gens to exert pressure is hugely important. I’m on PS4 so I see a Nurse once every fifty games or so, but Billies are unsurprisingly common. 
---
The perks that allow the killer to down you in one hit require very bad game play on the survivors part. 
---
Devour Hope? Shoulda cleansed the totem before they got 3 stacks.
---
NOED? shoulda cleansed totems before end game.
---
MoM works 100% of the time unless the killer has a one hit down. It is a PERK, which means it's usable every single game. So you cannot compare it to a mori, which is usable exactly once before it disappears for eternity into the void. Or the TWO insta-down add ons killers get, because they also disappear into the void. They're one time use only. Please try to show a little bit of intelligence and think before you post something like this.
---
Either he was making a very smart absurdist joke, or yes he is as dumb as a brick.
---
I guess that's BHVR's prerogative, but I think they're being awfully shortsighted here. Killer mains provide consitent queue times. The most obnoxious SWF tend to hang out in the rank 13-7 range, and a lot of those killers might decide the frustration isn't worth it. 
---
Blocking for NoED isn’t reportable, much like pig crouching to kill a trapped target. 
---
I mean if the killer takes a nap for 3 hours then I think that’s a W. Sitting there would be pointless. 
---
I mean, even if that's true, if you zap me from long range, I'm just gonna run to the next loop lol. There are only a few vaults (almost all indoor vaults) that you couldn't just run around to the other side of the wall if you get hit with a shock. Doctor is a terrible killer, almost as bad as Trapper in my opinion. I've only played against good Doctor addons
---
This is fucking amazing.
---
Happy birthday!  16!?  Holy shit I’m getting old. 😭
---
You called me out for avoiding the points in the OP, now you're passive-aggressively calling me out for addressing them too many times? Lol I can't win huh.
---
Its only going to be a problem when SWF troll groups run it. Solo, the perk is decent. If they do end up nerfing it, i hope it doesnt become unusable. Its the only good perk survivors have gotten in the last couple DLCs that can actually be used on its own without any builds to make it work properly. 
---
Maybe broken for 90 seconds. 
---
&gt; Discouraging negative behavior is better than encouraging good behavior.
---
I personally disagree but you could do both. You could do the same in the other direction. D/C too much and you start to gain less BP than you normally would.
---
Salty post game chat usually does. 
---
No one cares
---
Rancor can counter Mettle of Man when used by the obsession, but it does nothing against non obsession MoM users. Make Your Choice is difficult to manage, because with many killers you can't come back to the hook too quickly, so survivors will have time to run away and hide and you will have a hard time to find the savior. Also, SWF can unhook in front of your face for making MYC useless, because they have Borrowed Time, MoM, Dead Hard, they have everything they want. Haunted Ground is a gamble. You need to using it with Ruin for make them interested in totems, they can break Ruin first and then ignore Haunted Ground or break Haunted Ground when you chase a injured person.
---
Im pre sure they said they didnt wanna bring religion in too much— thats why the plague is a babylonian— aint nobody worshipping those old gods no more. 
---
But we might aswell get cynical w/ killer jesus and survivor satan hehe
---
11/10 Amazing job
---
My bad fixed it. 
---
Clearly you do if you went out of your way to comment that 🤷‍♀️
---
DO IT!
---
BE THE KIND PERSON,
---
DO IT!-
---
If time didn't exist in a linear fashion then everything that has ever happened will happen in the same moment.
---
For the sake of preventing a paradox, lets say it doesn't cause an eldritch mess (or maybe we should say that?).
---
Imagine that priestess from 3000 BCE arriving at the same time as some dude from the year 2050. Even though they came from different times, they all arrived at the same time. The entity probably likes the idea of generators opening gates and finds the mechanic amusing. There is also the possibility that because each character in this game comes from different places and times, maybe they experience different realities that make sense. So the manifestation of what they perceive as the thing that opens the gate is a generator because all of our survivors come from a modern era.
---
Even the plank is imitating her, aspiring to her thiccness 
---
Introduce a badly designed killer with no counter = survivors d/c and cry foul
---
Introduce a badly designed survivor perk with no counter and a few almost infinite loops = perfectly fine and balanced.
---
A lot of those killer players run M1 killers as well. 
---
Despite what the survivor mains say, 4k’ing every game with insta saw Billy/Nurse isn’t fun. Variety keeps killer alive since they all have differences. 
---
M1 killers already get punished enough by needing to run spirit fury/enduring to deal with pallets. It’s gonna discourage those people from wanting to run M1’s. 
---
Honestly I see it going like this: Killer player gets on, tests the waters with a few matches, if MoM is prevalent then the player will just bring out a counter killer. Either that or just quit the game for the day since they might not want to play those killers. 
---
Add me if you need one more, I need the trophy too and I'll bring in the key if you'd like. I'll send you a PM of my psn name and you can add me if you need a fourth person.
---
No I called you out for aimlessly posting like a self absorbed ass the second you seen your name being mentioned. The subtle ribbing was just to see if you’d follow the stereotype you made for yourself trying to spin the argument against someone else and not bowing out. Pretty much a slam dunk on that one.
---
Don’t necessarily need all three of of his perks. If you’re using tenacity, you could get unbreakable over buckle up to get more wiggle time or we’re gonna live forever to get amazing bloodpoint gains. Though buckle up can still help in situations you’re injured near a downed teammate as you could pick them up and give them the aura reading to outrun the killer longer, essentially helping you get better positioning and wiggle time with tenacity and flip flop along with potential mettle of Man safety once you flip flop off the killer.
---
Depends on how you want to ruin the killer’s day or make yours.
---
I mean I'm definitely abrasive too, but I can check it and have a conversation here and there. It's odd that I'm being called out for posts about MoM though, I've been pretty reasonable and consistent with my points I thought.

---
The survivor perk situation is abysmal, for sure. I don't think survivors need any further shitty perks.
---
Counterpoint: MoM can be ran team-wide with heavy synergy with a good exhaustion perk and the best chaser perk to shit on the majority of regular killers. This can be a very heavy change on the meta, so people are going to have strong views immediately.
---
 Rancor, which is much less useful for winning than running an Ivory or Ebony mori, caused a lot of complaints on release because it shook up the DS meta.
---
Both of these perks have deserved discussion, however, and that's why we discuss them on here. I think a change to the non-obsession variant is pretty much inevitable, but I don't want to see the obsession version nerfed at all, personally.
---
Cause they respect and or m2 every pallet lmao I just keep running and running 
---
PS4?
---
Yeah you are. I've seen the uwu soft boi weeb tumblrs. 
---
Turning everything into yaoi and shit.
---
Discouraging/encouraging works in different situations. I don’t see how the devs could positive incentive those who stay in games. There are a lot of DCers but lots more people actually stay in the game. 
---
That solution makes me ask what about those who don’t care about BPs.  
---
Because i dont want a medkit i want to bring a tool box. 
---
I think MoM is badly designed. It makes the weaker killers struggle and it doesn't do much to stronger killers.  
---
Sure, it makes anyone struggle if there's a full team with it, just like any other second chance perk. Just imagine, a full team with 4 Deliverance, DS, MoM and Unbreakable/DH/Adrenaline. That'd make any killer struggle, no matter what.
---
You should've seen Ardetha playing today as Pig against 3 survivors with MoM. It's was so frustrating for him, of course that match was a 3 escape man and he said that he probably will play Nurse until developers will make this perk useful against Nurse, then he probably will switch up to Huntress and Legion. He really was pissed off about this perk if he really wants to be a Legion main now :).
---
You are being disingenuine implying that MoM works against EVERY killer with no counterplay.
---
aaand still 5 gens left even without hex: ruin.
---
It's definitely useful as anti tunnelling perk. 
---
Let's make a list of things that don't count towards the three hits counter (before the perk activates) :
---
- Wraith if hitting after uncloaking
---
- Hag if hitting after teleporting
---
- Pig dash attack 
---
- Clown when attacking when the intoxicated effect is active (?)
---
- Hillbilly's chainsaw
---
- Nurse if hitting after blinking
---
- Huntress's hatchets
---
- Bubba's chainsaw
---
- Spirit if hitting after phasing
---
- Legion's stabby stab
---
- Plague's vomit
---
Now let's make a list of killers where MoM will likely never be activated:
---
- Hillybilly (chainsaw)
---
- Nurse (always blinks)
---
- Huntress (there's a low chance to get hit three times with her basic attack)
---
- Bubba (chainsaw)
---
- Spirit (depends on the skill)
---
- Legion (stabs)
---
- Plague (either she breaks you and instadowns, never reaching three, or pukes on you, not counting)
---
And then you have Wraith and Hag with low chance of activating (a bad Hag will be fine), and finally Pig and Clown which are okay I guess.
---
Now please tell me how MoM is as strong as DS. Or even strong at all.
---
Why even give mind to someone who can’t even speak half decent English 
---
What was that? You cut off at the end there.
---
Hmmm maybe you just don't like me :(. Weird because I can't say you've ever made an impression, do you want to start this relationship over though? We could chat about MoM or basketball or Ramen or something.
---
Yes, but that’s the point of the post. To let people know they may need to practice altruism in order to actually get Mettle of Man to work against killers like plague or nurse who can ensure you never get it online otherwise. And I’d hope people knowing they can use it to double their bloodpoint gains with We’re gonna live forever would motivate people to be more altruistic for the personal rewards if anything.
---
I'm gonna flex...I'm a rank 1 Trapper/Pig main. Haven't played much since the new rank system went into play but I went from Rank 8 to rank 3. 4ks, no tunnel, no camping is no longer a gauranteed double pip. Hell, it's not even a gauranteed pip. Just a sure thing you won't depip. Its hard, but I like the challenge. Only thing that annoys me are the few times I do get beat (when using a different killer for dailys) it's a sure thing I'm getting a message from survivors saying "gEt ReKt" or they're tbagging. Its ok though, I usually save those messages and Mori them when I see them again in another match. 
---
Anyways, haven't gone up against people using Mettle of Man but I want to so I can try to figure out how to deal with it. I never cared much for the way DS used to be. I knew how to deal with it. Dribbling or making sure I'd down them near a hook. Coming from mainly fighting games, my mentality is to learn and adapt, not cry for nerfs.
---
They would still be banned for excessive leaving like they are (or should be) now.
---
I think most people care about BP but also rank. Lots of people right now D/C to save their rank so that would need to be fixed as well. 
---
I don't know if Ash is available for shards but he's probably the funnest survivor to play as and has some cool cosmetics. 
---
Yeah, I knew that. OP probably just missed that their teammate was running an obsession perk.
---
Look guys! He’s doing it again! 🤣
---
Stops working on gen. Looks around. Sees claudette start working again. "Dont its a trap" 
---
Piggie: oink 
---
I don't think it works against every killer, so let me clear that misunderstanding up for you. 
---
I’ve been having a lot of killers kill the lobby as soon as I get in, at least from last night. I don’t know that kept happening.
---
Can't blind the killer and be toxic.
---
Last night as Nea, it seemed like the killer was oblivious to me fucking up the generators. 
---
Do you have her perks yet? I got her thinking she'd be fun to play but oh boy do i not have fun with her. I ended up playing other killers and using those bp to get her to 40.
---
But if you don't have her perks from the shrine i'd say get her to slow the game down just a little bit.
---
I can’t think of any situation where anyone has gotten banned for leaving despite them saying bans will happen. 
---
DCing causes a loss in rank. 2 pips. 
---
Those who DC enough to deserve a punishment probably don’t care about BPs. 
---
Why even waste the time typing up all this nonsense. At least I didn’t bother reading the entire thing
---
I thought we're supposed to have an endless supply of insta heals?
---
ITS OKAY, FRIEND. LET THE PAIN FLOW AWAY. I JUST REMEMBER THAT ONLY VERY SMALL PEOPLE TEABAG--AND BY VERY SMALL PEOPLE, I MEAN CHILDREN. ACTUAL CHILDREN.
---
Explaining a joke is like dissecting a frog.
---
What else should I do lol, I shouldn't mention they're being petty for calling me out, I shouldn't talk about MoM because I guess I've posted too much? What's left besides chatting about the weather or something?
---
Also you turned out to be kind of a dick lol.
---
Why Satan when man bear pig is far superior?
---
Right.
---
Look up some tutorials on youtube, a lot of them have on screen keyboards
---
BT instead of SC seems more common
---
I agree, Mettle of Man isn’t that much of a problem. The problem is when you get a 4 man SWF who are all running some combination of Mettle of Man, Decisive Strike, Dead Hard, Adrenaline, and Borrowed Time. It becomes way too much of an effort to down a Survivor. 
---
&gt;I can’t think of any situation where anyone has gotten banned for leaving despite them saying bans will happen.
---
I know, thats why I said "should" :)
---
&gt;DCing causes a loss in rank. 2 pips.
---
It should but after restarting your game you will regain the pips. 
---
&gt;Those who DC enough to deserve a punishment probably don’t care about BPs.
---
Maybe but there are not only excessive D/Cers but also the ones who only do it sometimes. Bad map, wrong killer etc.
---
Streamers would do it less because they care about BP and then their viewers would do it less.
---
In general the game could use some increase in BP overall.
---
DARN
---
As Spirit, I always phase at the god pallet so my husk blocks it. As long as you pay attention to where they were and watch for moving grass, you can turn the killer shack into a kill house.
---
Strategy. Killers get points for not getting blinded.
---
So I'm confused, most people have been arguing that it's has the potential to be an OP perk. Do you disagree? I don't see why you'd be comfortable with Broken or Hindered added to it if you believed Mettle of Man was in a good spot right now. 
---
The streamers need to fix their acts. I’m convinced if some of them acted less toxic then their communities wouldn’t be such shitholes. 
---
Absolutely astounding that you can reset your game and have your pips come back. I’m taking you at face value but I don’t know why you’d lie about that. That’s something I never thought BHVR would screw up. 
---
Welcome to The Dark Side, brother.
---
You could pick up what remains of your self respect and just be humble dude. I don’t go out looking for reasons to not like people but damn you make that difficult. Hell if you wanna chat about ramen I’ll chat about some spicy ramen, but not today, and not on this thread lol.
---
No reason to be testy about it. I never said “OP pls nerf”, just that it has potential to be really frustrating. I could’ve sworn I saw a video the other day where Bubba sawed two Ashes that it activated on at the same time though.
---
If you actually read my posts and weren’t so busy trying to spin this around you’d know that answer already now wouldn’t you?     
---
Shot from half court.. It’s good!
---
Pipping is stupid right now. Ignore rank and keep gitting gud.
---
Shenanigans. 
---
O ok so he was keeping you trapped to gaurentee a kill off noed rather then letting you escape with a normal swing. That just sounds like a scummy tactic. Not the most fun way to do things but I guess I see it
---
/u/Accentrick I think they should decrease the healing meter when you're not actively healing so you can't bank the 99% and completely mitigate the downside. I also think that applying the BT/Deep Wounds timer would still keep it a very strong perk instead of a free health state, it obviously wouldn't decrease in chases and you'd still buy yourself time with it, but you'd need to at least mend before you can get back into the action.
---
Today was too rough, daddy 
---
Shoyu ramen, eh? That's a really good choice but I'm more of a Tonkatsu guy. Add some pork belly and chili paste and you got a meal going. 
---
Cool I'll just drop a couple pallets, fast vault then point at a hook. Also hope you know the devs have said thumbs down report goes literally nowhere just there to appease angry players. 
---
That's why temp bans aren't a thing.
---
I'm a simple man. I see a survivor, I ram my stick up their ass- healthy or injured, regardless of whether they've been hooked or not. Don't get found, don't get hooked. I suppose for you, that's nary an option, huh? 
---
Using your analogy we send criminals to jail after a lawful court proceeding where they are judged by a collection of non-biased peers. Witch hunts generally do not consider all the evidence, don't give the accused a fair trial. This could lead to someone toxic getting mad at a player who beat them so they get friends or supporters to witch hunt them even though that player did nothing wrong. 
---
I know this is probably just my experience but about 80% of Ash players were potatoes. Probably because I'm still in purple ranks.
---
I don't wanna hear any excuses.
---
Your punishment is a mori. 
---
Do you have any friends to play with? I just got up to 12 because my friend teaches me and goes into kill your friends with me to show me how to do different things so I can watch him as a killer. Then he’ll be the killer and tell me what I’m doing wrong. 
---
Which hunting like that can also be illegal ya know... sadly there is privacy laws in most situations and countries to prevent that. If it’s an actual criminal offence like DDOS’ing then there’s systems already in place to report that and have it handled, same as you can report hackers to the devs and it’s handled.
---
...What's MoM?
---
Jesus is already in the game
---
&gt; Bubba (chainsaw)
---
 You make me laugh
---
For real though, Devs have said that MoM is currently bugged for several attacks, most notably Nurse blink hits. If Nurse Blink hits are intended to count towards MoM, it is also likely that Wraith surprise attacks, Hag teleport attacks, Clown attack while intoxicated, and Spirit grudge attacks are also intended but are currently bugged. So really the list of killers that will almost always be unaffected by MoM will be
---
* Huntress
---
* Pig
---
* Plague
---
* Legion
---
* Billy*
---
* Bubba*
---
 
---
Oh my god. I swear you’re stalking me 
---
The booty in the visual novel tags. 
---
I always play with to of my friends who are ranks 10 and 8. The problem is that my friends just seem to get pips much faster and more frequently. We do the same things throughout the game yet they get one and I don’t. A few days ago I escaped every game I played and didn’t get one pip. I just don’t get it. 
---
That's not an interaction, that's just player intervention not triggering BT.
---
Like, Wraith and Pig counter BT. Insidious also counters BT.
---
Probably the prick who keeps setting stuff on fire
---
Smart people kill themselves on hook so whatever.
---
If hes not running purple add-ons he can be easy to beat, all those add-ons do is turn one of the shittiest killers into one of the best. Hes too dependent on add-ons
---
Killers cant 'force' survivors out..  Some survivors are very skilled.  Some killers are very bad.  There is a very big between area where killers cant accomplish anything.
---
Which of these two can choose to end the game immediately with out disconnecting.
---
Killer who is unable to catch survivors.
---
Survivors around an open gate.
---
Killers end games by killing survivors, thats it, thats the only way.
---
Survivors choose to stand in gates and tbag.  
---
Survivors choose to take a hit before leaving
---
Survivors choose to take a mettle of man hit as well before they go.
---
Survivors choose to be downed before crawling out.
---
Survivors bodyblock so their friend cant reach a hook and they can choose to run out or not.
---
Survivors sabo the hook by the exit gate so the killer has to wait 4 mins for it to respawn before they can reach a hook from the gate, during which time survivors can choose to exit at any time.
---
Survivors can choose to get hooked and have a friend bt them to the exit.
---
Survivors can choose at any point above to run back into the map and juke the killer around for as long as they can skillfully handle (potentially indefinitely in some cases)
---
Survivors can often stealth around potentially indefinitely hiding in nooks and just being invisible to killers that suck at finding them.  
---
At what point above did the killer choose to have the game go on?   The killer has the choice to 'try' or 'give up'.  This killer gave up.  After a reasonable amount of time for survivors to screw around, break totems, and loot items survivors are expected to do their UNCONTESTED objective of leaving the match or they are holding the game hostage.
---
Similarly in a game where a survivor has no exit option and gives up the killer cant endlessly mori spam or pickup-drop-attack for hours on end.  They need to do their uncontested objective and end the game or help them escape, else they are holding the game hostage.   
---
no, current state is more like "DC, DC, DC, Involuntary DC, DC, Infinite Loading Screen, DC, Freezing Loading Screen of Death, Involuntary DC."
---
sorry, i usually don't get too upset about technical problems in games but it's getting a little bit annoying at this point.
---
I still don’t get the hate (unless they moon walk).
---
Continuing this subject just further proves your own stereotype and that you don’t bother to actually read anything else people say besides taking a single line and responding to that. Trying to throw you a bone here dude.. you’re in control of your own image not me.
---
Soooo cuz you have no confidence you can win you dc and ruin the game for everyone just cuz you don’t like the killer he chose?
---
Yes, things can be problematic for killers they’re called “obstacles”. Without them I’d not play killer. Extra heath states is strong but not the fuckin catastrophe people are saying it is. Since the healed MoM user is visible that cuts down a decent chunk of time trying to find him/her. Than it’s just a matter of patience and studying like every other killer match. Some survs will waste pallets and vault unsafely resulting in a relatively short chase. This leads to them healing, wasting time, just to reveal themself again. Since you know this guy sucks he’ll down again. Unless he has instaheal or adrenaline MoM is essentially gone. We all get SWF god teams eventually as killer it just comes with the job. The perk needs some tweaks. Trying to adjust to quad god SWF meta just isn’t ok, they are the minority. Run perks to counter the meta, something survivors and killers do alike. 
---
The perk is good but definitely not OP. I run it and most of the time I have to go out of my way to use it. I don’t play immersed either.
---
The only problem I see with this perk is that it can be used together with certain perks like dead hard and adrenaline. Even though pulling off a perfect combo like this is very rare.
---
Without a combo, it’s just another dead hard. Especially if you manage to bait an attack with dh. But it can only be used once.
---
I suggest people actually try to figure out how to work around it before immediately demanding a nerf.
---
Thicc Jane
---
I always miss the last skillcheck at 98%.
---
Im not witch hunting like that. I dont know what op means but im saying if these people are cheating and the likes and its blatant ban them. If they keep circumventing bans then we need to just not play with them or dignify the playstyle. Just quit as soon as we see it. If they go game to game and never get to play it removes incentive to cheat because they could never win. Thats my witch hunt. 
---
Thanks for replying and being polite. I'm not sure about this myself, because playing solo surv there's a high chance your teammates turn against each other (nothing new, really). I wish the devs actually used PTB for those  ocasions. 
---
The perk is obviously strong to sell the dlc, my problem is that they will take their time to change it so they can squeeze the players to buy it.
---
That could still be an issue but I still think it would help to some degree. It would also allow killers to get their BBQ stacks. Other survivors could at least attempt to save etc..
---
Never thought I'd spend $10 on cosmetics.. please don't give BHVR ideas on how to open my wallet! Great art though as a fan of Bubba I rarely see him get love from the artists of this community. Can't wait to see more hand puppet killers.
---
Now THAT killer is hard to imagine playing against good survivors, MOM will still be an issue to him.
---
Doesn’t matter. If he needs a nerf that’s up to them. You are still just pulling your cord out cuz you don’t like the character he chose. What game would we have if every killer disconnected just cuz someone picked the invisible Claudette? Ppl got upset with killers not wanting to play against swf and yet some think that’s wrong but it’s ok to dc just cuz he picked a certain killer and ruin the match for 3 other survivors that signed in for a real game. 
---
How so? I'm sure i can produce 100s of examples of how uncivilized society is. Like if you think other wise thats just a fallacy you created on your own. The real world is a harsh place. 
---
Wait wait wait...
---
I know at least spirit's hit after phasing and clowns intoxication DO count towards the m1 hits. I am also 90% sure wraiths and hag's hits do the same, but i havent been able to test myself, which begs the question: did you test this and are you 100% sure everything you just said is true?
---
 To me it seems that the only m1 that doesn't trigger it is nurse after blink, but i am sure that is just a bug
---
Just listing killers that can avoid adding stacks, not their viability. :0
---
That is fair enough but I don't think it would class as witch hunt. Maybe more a consensus DC lol? 
---
You will still have the issue of people believing someone is cheating just because they are good, or that person doesn't understand something, or maybe the connection is just poor. I remember playing some newer people using Freddy and they didn't understand that when in dreamworld I can see there auras from a distance, they assumed I cheated and would of DCed. 
---
The easiest answer is BHVR just bans these players but even that is complicated and from what I gather they need a crap ton of evidence. I saw a post of someone wanting to report lag switching in a game they recorded but just because they hadn't clicked report at the end of the game the devs wouldn't do anything, if that is true its pretty weak.
---
Just got 3 back to back games at rank 5 with 2 out of 4 players running that build... Except the flashlight but it's still bullshit. 
---
If you think getting hit 4 times in a match is situational, i don't want to know what you think is consistent
---
No that's Myers. How do you even mix those up?!
---
Would be neat if their was cream inside to represent survivor pudding.
---
When you reach the end of the game either bait them with a body in basement or if you don't have any killers, sit in basement. Usually for whatever reason survivors are toxic assholes that will search the whole map and keep the game hostage just to fuel their ego I guess.
---
This makes me,,, feel things
---
I would love this but they already struggle to balance 4 vs 1 imagine what a shit show 2 vs 8 could be lmao. 
---
Huh I don't se... Oh. 
---
There are times when you just need to heal yourself. Good use of self care isnt healing every time you get injured, but sometimes it's still necessary.
---
If you’re trying to judge the world based on the actions of the minority of the population then sure, but that’s not reality. That’s just having a strong bias for uncivilized actions and your own personal desires, which adds fuel to the fire.
---
I feel like it’s gotten worse since the ranking changes were implemented. I have a sneaking suspicion that quitters are more likely to do so when they know they’re actively hurting your progress. 
---
The average survivor will be hit 6 times in one match, if instadowns and abilities are not included. I think the perk is good, yes, but I don't think it's decisive tier. The perk pretty much requires self care or a medkit (if you're going to be a fuckwit and exploit) Otherwise it's stay injured or give the killer wallhacks.
---
Would watch if this was an actual to ing
---
Bm? Nah, heck you didn't even plan it.   
---
Sending HATE mail? They suck. 
---
It would be strong if it cut every heal duration by 25% but it doesn't. Only when two survivors are injured and in the same spot the perk will be efficient.
---
It is better with communication but even then it is only worth it if you are close to each other to begin with. Nobody uses the perk right now. No SWF and no solo player because it just shitty to be frank. 
---
The scenario in which you can utilize it is semi rare and even then the effect is not super noticablr. Other perks save you way more time and are usable in more situations.
---
I think doing it at every single pallet is toxic, but it’s a strategy if you use it to escape the chase.
---
I've joined you also :) 
---
I actually clipped some Freddy vs ash moments for a video I’m making where I tunnel ashes I find in game and try to be as toxic as possible, had a laugh and a really frustrating time dealing with them. Had one disconnect as Freddy. Who dced as soon as I downed him. It’s probably smart as Freddy to use up that perk as soon as possible.
---
Is it just me, or Quentin bugs out the most? A lot of the major float/out of bounds glitches I see seem to be Quentin.
---
If you play him well, Freddy's a fairly powerful Killer. 
---
He has a number of unfun mechanics, suffers unnecessarily from both Self-Care and Adrenaline, and can't defend anything (unless you're running 3-second transition), but he's never been as bad as all the memes say he is.
---
never gonna happen
---
It’s funny since Plague can basically ignore MoM
---
Is it bad I read all of this in Duke Nukems voice?
---
He’s the slug God as we all know.
---
I think it is a good idea, but I would say take away the trappers traps.   
---
Mainly because my poor trapper has enough to worry about IMO 
---
I've had that twice. I've noticed if u act kinda like a PC where u hold forward on a lot of games to run and use your right stick to turn it works that way. I managed to 360 twice against a doctor last time I had it. I prefer not to have it but I mean u will get used to it eventually lol
---
The issue is nearly every tactic in this game sort of boils down to annoying the way it plays out. Not toxic, annoying. The true problem is that some people see annoying as toxic. So they make quick claims that an annoying system in this game is toxic, when it is not.
---
2 Legions 😫🔫
---
I know I was being toxic because there are different levels of being toxic vaulting a window isn’t that bad 
---
There's no real benefit for Survivors to use one control scheme over the other. If you want to play with your PS4 controller you should since you're comfortable with it.
---
But it does, 32 seconds total for 2 people to heal each other. 24 seconds if the first one healing has the perk. It is strong assuming the team isn't just standing in corners self caring.
---
The only time it is not strong is that situation where everybody decides healing alone is more efficient than working on gens and healing survivors when you come across them.
---
Additionally if you combine with we'll make it now you heal 16 seconds total. 8 seconds for the first heal then 8 seconds to finish the second. If it was at 100% now you heal 2 survivors 1 health state in 8 seconds. Thats absolutely broken and again its not too hard to get 2 injured survivors if they are properly focusing on gens instead of spending 32 seconds to self heal.
---
I'M GOING TO BE A SURVIVOR PLAYER NOW, THOUGH I'LL STILL FINISH MY PROJECT OF GETTING ALL PERKS ON DOC SINCE I JUST GOT THE LAST KILLER I NEED TO LEVEL.
---
Hi, killer main, its not that we hate a perk for being good on survivor , but that it can almost guarantee an extra minute of chase if used correctly, and when stacked on a 4 man team is ridiculously powerful (when done right). Not to mention it's one downside can be negated with clever play.
---
I am all for having a strong survivor perk, but I just think Mettle of Man was balanced poorly.   
---
Its the Killer equivalent, right now, to Franks Mixtape for survivor.   
---
It can be a \*\*\*\*\* to deal with, and isn't fun at all for the killer. Now , if there were a downside like what others have said, such as "can't heal until the next hook", and remove the aura reading thing, I would be fine with it. 
---
Strategy, but it's very frustrating and I make a point not to let these players escape. 
---
I never play with Ruin on PS4 and my games always depend on the first and second chase.
---
If I find someone quickly, down and hook them, and then find someone else I'll 2-4k; depending on how good the Survivors are.
---
If I lose the first person, commit too long, can't find anyone, or fail to find a 2nd person after hooking the first I'll lose the game unless I can get a 3-gen going.
---
I know this is beating a dead horse, but Generators just go so fast that Killer depends on early game pressure to do well.
---
It's the reason Killers run Ruin; it's one of the only perks they can use to try to give themselves more time to build that initial pressure on the Survivors. Even if it goes down in a minute, it's bought them time to search, chase, or down.
---
Sounds like you're being disingenuous with this. More than half of the things you say dont trigger it I'm sure actually is supposed to and probably does because it's still a basic attack.
---
Stand still and let me kill you 
---
I think depending on which killers are paired, the killers could honestly smoke the 8 survivors pretty damn easily. 
---
BTW; even after the update survivors can still spawn right next to the Ruin totem and take that out. Not to mention that maps are small enough that they will still find Ruin in about the first minute of the match, not unless like I said they spawned on top of it. Not to mention that Ruin still has a ton of downsides like: being discovered in the first minute of the match or less, survivors can brute force a gen with 2 or more on a gen to get it done, survivors can gen tap, and survivors can be good at hitting Great skillchecks consistently (unlike your piddly ass). Complaining about Ruin is a bitch move. 
---
I just ran Glass Shard + Glass Fragment, and found it mildy useful occasionally, so, better than blonde hair.
---
Everything you just listed literally happened, it just took time. Thanks for making my point more valid tho :)
---
But you gotta think about the bp economy!!! 
---
I've been surprised by the amount of times you can get some Self-Heal off during a chase and get SOME of that progress going.  I'm rank like 15 but still, it's nice when you can do stuff like that.
---
It also helps since I run a BUNCH of luck stats for Purple Toolboxes, Keys, Maps etc with decent addons with Aftercare for the odd time I do get a medpack.
---
Being able to just heal yourself instead of chasing down people is really, really helpful.
---
Lol, nice comeback but Killers also have many perks that give them free insta downs, moris, etc. And powres that do the exact same. Maybe it's YOU who should shut the fuck up and stop complaining. Also, deliverance isn't piss-soaked diapers? Seems that's you guys right about now.
---
  Corrupt intervention isn't needed Lmao and you can do without ruin if you're good enough. 
---
Every single time I’ve swapped out Self Care for something else while playing solo and brought in a medkit instead the killer has Franklin’s.
---
I don't even care about balance, add it as a new unranked game mode like KYF, just for fun.  No bloodpoints no ranks, just a new game mode for fun to reignite the game.  People would play it like crazy.  Later on if it they make some tweaks with the balance of it and map sizes, then possibly add it as a ranked mode.
---
My major issue with a 2v8 game mode would be that you couldn't predict how the other Killer would play.
---
For instance, I'm an extremely nice Killer main by the standards of the community. I don't camp, tunnel, BM, etc. I play to have fun and for the Survivors to have fun as well. What if I down a Survivor then the other Killer camps them? What if I down a Survivor then the other Killer body blocks the hook I carry them too? I can't damage them, how do I hook the Survivor? How would perks work? If I was running Sloppy Butcher, then all 8 Survivors have an increased healing time against another Killer with 4 perks. What if the other Killer has NOED? Would I instadown Survivors with it? Would Ruin only affect 4 Survivors? 
---
There are just far to many things to work out for a 2v8 game mode to even be remotely considered right now in my eyes.
---
Got it when it first came out, had a glitch where I got caught under the world uninstalled never played again until my brother came across the game in my steam library one day and said he’d play it
---
&gt;*"This picture of a cake sure is real."*
---
But it looks nice and tasty. Happy IRL cake day! 🎉🎂
---
Forgive me for being totally new to this thread, but what is DCing?
---
Wow, that cake is Amazing! Happy Birthday!
---
She's a sneaky one 
---
Just make it so you have to be the obsession and instead of hits that bring you from injured to dying make it work against hits that take you from healthy to dying.
---
It then doesnt punish weaker killers and is an effective perk against expose.
---
When the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis kills all your friends but you kill the book and get that epic Victory Royale. 👌😩🔥💯
---
This always happens when I bring in a purple item with good add-ons. Always. That or it’s a 2 man. And the killer never wants to farm.
---
Quote I made from another discussion I had:
---
&gt; "I would say the ability to take 3.5-4.5 hits after bodyblocking shenanigans is both more annoying, and incredibly viable if they don't all rush to proc it at the same time for a meme.
---
(Bodyblock to try and force M1's on any killer that could counter, build stacks, take a hit, Dead Hard, Hit, Insta, Hit, Hit. Add looping and possible flashlight saves in the middle of all of these.)
---
[...]
---
I feel like you're describing it in terms of just one guy having it, when if it is considered meta in the future, that will never be the case in high rank.
---
Finally, exposed swings still add stacks, so flashlight saves and slugging any of them for too long can result in a very messy endgame for the Killer. It's a band-aid strat, honestly.
---
I'm not saying it's a massive problem yet, but I won't be shocked (when) it gets a nerf down the road for non-obsessions."
---
I was rank 3 before I stopped playing surv and the game for awhile. Rankreset down to 15. My god my back hurts from how much I carry. Like omg I do most of gens and saves while watching them hide. Tf you doing! 
---
Care to comment? Megapellican just slid himself up inside you and is thrusting repeatedly. 
---
I feel like 2 days from now every single Killer is going to be dabbing while every single Legion does a Fortnite dance in the background and Nea and Claudette teabag. And they'll do it to the rythm of [Hooked and I'm Bleeding.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw7acVWt6uo)
---
You fool! Its Dio! Get away!!!! 
---
Lol
---
Repost the memes just a lil' bit.
---
All of the survivors play the same, there is no specialisation, other than each characters teachables. Learn how to run from the killer efficiently. Play survivor before moving to killer, as it will help you learn how to play both sides.
---
Thank you!!!
---
A lot of people are getting this right now
---
I COULD animate that. But it would need destroying as soon as its finished and never seen the light of day
---
Realistically this would be impossible for killers to win, since at most only 2 people can be chased at a time. So that's 6 people hammering on gens. Finding and hooking a survivor can take long enough so that one person can complete whatever gen they're on. So that could be up to 6 gens popping at once. Even if you doubled the amount of gens to do, it would still leave only  4 more gens, which again, 6 people could easily do without issue. 
---
Honestly I think the only way to have more people in a game is to add another game mode that isn't dependent on doing gens, a la Friday the 13th.
---
Thank you so much!! This cake sure isn’t a lie. 😉
---
Ok then
---
Whining. Thats pretty meta, ngl.
---
I play like this too and I gotta say that it doens't matter how you play. Seriously, if you do this because you like it, props to you, I wish to play against you. If you do this however to seek enemy validation, just drop it. People are shit to oponents just cause they can and I highly recomend you to report them. As far as i read, the devs keep the chat log so there's nothing to worry about.
---
By the way, GG and keep on

---
I think I brought it a good luck baggy but it wasn’t too big of a deal. But yeah I’ve had that happen to me so many times 
---
&gt;Numerous nerfs to survivor, completely gutted DS, map changes, newest killers have strong and near unstoppable chase gameplay, addition of spirit fury
---
&gt;survivors get one perk that gives them another health state ONLY against M1 killers IF they took 3 M1 hits prior
---
&gt;I just cant play killer anymore its too stressful and unbalanced
---
Give me a break. Talk about overreaction. How come no one made these posts about Spirit Fury? Maybe because people realize its okay for both sides to have strong perks. Do you just want every perk to be iron maiden/breakdown tier so everyone just runs the same old builds every match? Not to mention Ash also released with two meme tier perks that no one will ever run unless they’re joking. 16/18 of the most recent DLC survivor perks have been trash meme tier garbage. 
---
This MoM complaining would be valid if old DS was still a thing, because you’d down the obsession, they’d DS, you’d down them again and hook them and then next time you hit them they’d MoM you. *That* would’ve been obnoxious but thats because old DS was ridiculous.
---
Ash has some really nice perks but I think you got the really good ones already
---
If they honestly nerf ash after him being the one dlc that brought me back to play this cesspool game because its ash I'll just quit playing again I'd play killer but that shit is totally unfun and I got high rank with killer and then there's survivor which isnt fun unless theres somewhat of a chance to punish targeting killers which is p much the only time the perk comes useful to me when I solo. Combine it with DS it really is a fuck you to tunneling killers
---
The piss babies won't stop crying about Legion until they get their way. Simple as that. When the next killer comes out (please god let it be either Pinhead or Jason) the piss babies will still cry about Legion and shit out half-hearted shitposts for those upboats. And the comments for said shitposts will consist of:
---
"i hate Legion xd"
---
"OmG i hate legion too. I disconnect all the time!" 
---
" Everyone hates Legion. How could Behavior do this to us? We should all ragequit until they listen to us!" 
---
"Legion is fine (comment hidden)." 
---
I think a good way to fix this is to make skill check zones colored in a meter-like fashion - red to green. The closer you are to the green (currently great skillchecks) the more the gen progresses. But if you go into the orange zone (middle) it does not progress, and red it loses slight progression. Something kinda like this:  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/aWUv5iq.png](https://i.imgur.com/aWUv5iq.png)
---
(I know i know, i'm an amazing artist).
---
So green would give as much progression as great skillcheck does now, and yellow would give normal progression. Orange would give none, red would decrease normal amount, and missing would lose 'great' amount.
---
Plague has some amazing perks and is easy to play but o think you got the best ones already
---
Thank you! And ikr I was so happy when I saw it. The lady who made it did a really good job.
---
Virtually the same since you've stopped playing, minus Decisive Strike which can be swapped with Mettle of Man. Killer meta hasn't changed, it's still Ruin/BBQ/Tracking perk/Pallet perk. 
---
Please tell me you got it for Jeff Johansen. Legion isn't that good in his current state. 
---
My game freeze in the loading screen pre game. I can wait 8 minutes and it doenst load. Only happened today but I didn't play much since 2.6.3
---
Did they nerf Decisive Strike? And why Mettle of Man? (Appreciate the responses btw)
---
Don't hug the edge of the map. Be proactive, learn to run from killers and utilize pallet slams and running around in buildings. 
---
Expect to die. A lot. It can sometimes be quite pleasant.
---
DC'ing is the meta. 
---
&gt;I really want to see more aggressive, offensive-type survivors. Not just hiding and running.
---
There's other games that do that, I'd be disappointed to see this turn into Friday the 13th. No thanks.
---
Some killers are, others are fine. The lower tier killers are getting worse, but the higher tier ones are doing alright.
---
In terms of toxicity it really does suck, but the best thing to do is hide chat and just enjoy the matches. Go in to them to enjoy them, and not have any expectations of pipping etc.
---
They dont say anything when you mention Spirit Fury, the strongest killer perk in the game to end chases quickly that synergizes with another meta perk, Enduring. Imagine if there were posts everyday talking about how Spirit Fury is “bullshit” and “problematic” because theres NO counterplay to it!! Lmao, its just as ridiculous as MoM complaints.
---
They probably dont understand that Spirit Fury is even good because they respect pallets and are deathly afraid of getting stunned.
---
