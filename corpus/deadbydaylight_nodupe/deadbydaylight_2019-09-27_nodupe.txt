Try Harding with 2 perks and no ruin. They always have an excuse on why they lost.

---
---
🤣 that’s way too adorable
---
I remember the top right. So good
---
It’s  painful experience, I had to dc, I apologised to all the survivors first.
---
Or enduring+bad timed stun
---
I think I made someone drop their switch yesterday when I was ghost face. Don’t think many people have jumped onto the dlc yet so no one knows how the paid killers are. Dude cuts a corner and I’m just standing there waiting for him and he stops moving for like 3 seconds after quickly jerking to the left. I didn’t even hit him because I was too busy laughing
---
I GOT IT TO WORK.
---

---
Only time it happened that round, but I DID IT.
---
Are you proud of me dad?
---
My first killer game:
---
- Hag
---
- Rotten Fields
---
*Need I say more?*
---
Im wondering where you get your data cause right now you sound like the toxic one
---
Tea-bagging is toxic, but staying at the exit gate until forced out is proper meta strategy for survivors. You stay there to put pressure on the killer to allow the other survivors a chance to open the other gate, heal before heading the the exit, or in case you need to body-block for them.
---
She is nowhere near Michael. Michael can beat red ranks, even a group of strong SWFs in red ranks. He is extremely feared when in EW3, perhaps the best group of addons in the game bar none, probably second to the Hag in terms of being able to snowball. Michael is never out of a match because with one pop of an EW3 he can turn what looked to be certain defeat into a victory. When the Plague pukes on you you finish the gen, when Michael pops his EW3 you run the hell away as fast as you can. The Plague wishes she had that viability and fear factor. She's a joke to any skilled survivor.
---
Great edit! Perfectly sums up his voice acting.
---
After hooking a Steve I had to take a moment to process what I just heard.
---
 It doesn’t give you an advantage in anyway so it’s fine. Just your finger saves more energy
---
Same but it was relatively easy
---
Doesn’t matter as a killer either. People act like this game is Esports shit. The hit boxes are so generous
---
I dont remember this Garfield movie
---
I usually use my best add-ons to make sure I win, but I let the games drag if I have to
---
#What a garbage developer, the game is a joke mechanically. People literally only play to piss off, troll other people or for the iconic characters from loved franchises, but the problem there is the killers implementation is garbage mechanically. Why the fuck would most of these killers act like the beholden bitch of some "entity" and do chores for them? Then "looping" is a thing in a game centered around horror villains and survivors.... like what? They should've just made a hide and seek mode where the killers can actually just outright kill you but get bonus points for the amount of time they leave players downed, or let them go, or stalk. Both survivors and killers should have the same vision whether its 1st or 3rd person. You can peek around corners, hide under desks, in lockers, in bushes and you get more points for how long it takes to be found and killed. No crows, not even afk ones. Instead the longer you sit still in a locker the heavier your breathing gets, or the longer you sit in one spot the more uncomfortable your character gets and starts making small hints of pained noise from holding the same position for so long. In a game about iconic horror killers and survivors the horror is completely absent and replaced with gimmicky chores for both killer and survivor alike and one time use items that are pretty uninspired. This game as a concept is solid but the execution is just garbage compared to what could've been and is the real reason the community is so "toxic" it's just designed in such a way that you have to be cheap and silly to win and that has no place in a game about iconic horror franchises. Newer players camp because otherwise they get looped permanently by the rank 5-1 players they were paired with and they have less than 5 hours of play.
---
What rank were you at, I had to get all iridescent as it was red ranks :(
---
I agree. Nobody liked pallet vacuum. Except for toxic survivors
---
[deleted]
---
I was at rank 8 they was potatoes
---
The game should drag. This game is grindy and we don’t get bloodpoint events often. When I play killer I don’t use my best add ons, but I make the game go quite longer.
---
Code for what though? it's safe to save or the killers camping it isn't code for anything other than an impatient survivor in my mind, your making an un appaplicable suggestion sorry mate it's not happening just play the game normally if you do poorly during a double blood point event you'll get twice the reward get an escape cake ready up and just get on with it :D
---
Oops should have clarified. 
---
I play on PS4 so once I have a full lobby, I send it to them (whoever accepts messages at least) as a group message. (:
---
Imagine disliking when the bullied killer takes the smart way out
---
yeesh, you okay buddy?
---
Ik also rank 6 in a rank 13 killer game.
---
Eh, spirit can't see most of the time anyway
---
Yeah makes no sense. I don't even understand it because a survivor yanking the cord actually makes them keep their BP and item, so I don't get why losing connection to the killer acts completely differently if the killer is the one who pulls the plug vs the survivor pulling the plug.
---
Even bedazzled?
---
That's a terrible idea
---
iFunny.co
---
Ghostface, he has jumpscares AND teabagging. What more could you want??
---
I admire the excellent story telling, but are you posting on the wrong Reddit thread?
---
Haven’t won ONE FUCKING MATCH EVER SINCE THIS UPDATE FUCK THIS STUPID FUCKING KILLERBASE GAME
---
Oh yeah, when game looked not like a soap
---
You hurt me op by reminding me...I want to downvote but I won't because in too scared to look at the picture again
---
OP, listen to me and my replies in this thread - because if she was as good as people in here were saying there is no way in hell she wouldn't be played as much. Killers that are viable are popular. And killers who aren't, are not. You will never, ever ever see the Plague take off in popularity until she is made viable. Point. Blank. Period.
---
I wanna see the rest of those notes 👀

Legion

Same :(
---
Wait what happened here?? I'm lost...
---
Is there a way to actually make legion good??
---
Talent
---
I was having the same issue this morning.
---
Yes waste a bunch of time, because the point is you don't know if you're going to do that and get a worse game than you would have had if you stayed. You end up using more time ruining people's games than playing.
---
Basically same build for me, though I usually run Unbreakable instead of Borrowed Time.

4 games in a row, i think i will dream corn.
---
She kinda freaky tho
---
How can I get rid of discordance 3 if it's on a p3 killer?
---
Hag's ultra rare addons are the clothes she wore on the day she was kidnapped, the shoe addon is "a child's shoe", they say that no ones underage for legal reasons despite Laurie and Quentin being 17, killers can be underage but survivors cannot be.
---
Late summer 2k17
---
So that magically allows the killer to see everyone at the start and literally down them one after another without a zero hook? Righhhttttt. 
---
Oh well more DCs for me.
---
Excellent!
---
I play more killer than survivor nowadays, don't assume things you don't know to seem smart.
---
Nope literally spawned in and 40 seconds later everyone was downed.
---
Ah, that makes more sense. I wanted to do this on PC but it wouldn't work quite as well.
---
I've had 2 games with a DCing killer, 1 killer lag switching, and only 1 game with more than 1 streamer
---
No such thing as a good killer.
---
Survive with friends
---
Survive with Friends.
---
Yep. Everyone is a hacker.
---
Had a rank 8 wraith last night who demolished all of us using showdowborn and no ad-ons. It's how you play the perks arent everything.

Agreed. Not being able to tell right away would at least be more thematic. The point of the perk is to slowly make things harder on the survivors. Add a level of complexity by making it an invisible debuff and we'll have something scary.
---
Got em.
---
Oh true, forgot that
---
Sounds like a good killer to me
---
That happened to me a couple games ago. I looked up, saw it was still full and escaped knowing damn well that was a lie lol
---
On my last post about it someone talked about how they saw Steve get hooked but searched around for a wounded female because that's what they thought the moaning was.
---
God. These are so nasty buy I love them lol.

I watched this like 3 times in a row. I haven't Kobe'd in a hot minute...or been able to use my DS like that

Nice screenshot!
---
I know SWF exists but couldn’t they do something with a paranoia status effect where the longer you are by yourself, the more paranoid everyone else becomes of that person. As the percentage increases, being near that person causes team actions to be slower for their team if they are working on the same thing. The Thing could sabotage a certain amount of gens(limited max like 3). The survivors have to find parts that allow them to fix those gem. If you get 100% paranoia and the Thing gets you when you’re alone, he auto kills you
---
Repost
---
Clearly you are rank 20
---
Yes.
---
Often, especially if I used a mori that match.
---
I he only spirits I run into have prayer beads. They ALWAYS have it
---
I got this bug too but it said brutal killer lol
---
i never saw it before send link
---
Dont DC. That ruins the game. Some killers are just really good. You cant win every game
---
Another Myers main here. I seem to always get Nurse...... as a console player.
---
There is a difference between hurting someone and showing someone how their actions hurt others.
---
I can say I hate and abhor violence, but stepping into protect someone or even myself doesn't make me a hypocrite. Mocking a bully for bullying isn't the same as bullying to be an ass.
---
By the way, the post was removed, because it was the perfect example of toxic language used in this very community and sub; it is strong language that bothers people, even from faceless strangers. Besides, we've already said that could have been done better. Like your doofus comment, I think you're being naive.
---
Had the same issue on xbox. Noticed it while playing as Huntress today, felt like my sensitivity was low at the start of the game but it was still set at 100. Turned it down to 90, then back to 100 then it was fine. This has happened every game for me as killer.
---
Been playing this game for 2 years and have never encountered this problem. Hopefully the dev's know about it and address it soon since it's pretty annoying.
---
K I'm going to sleep have a great fog day
---
Just DC if a killer is spamming mori. 
---
Just waste them.
---
The deep wounds timer only goes down when you are outside of Legion's Terror Radius, and doesn't care about chases.
---
Upon activating the Dark Devotion perk by hitting the obsession, Legion has no Terror Radius and therefore allows the deep wounds timer to go down the whole duration of Dark Devotion.

Nea is a hot diggity dog, y'all just straight.

It’s my only Adept Killer other than Hag, Ghostface and Hillbilly atm
---
Ah yes, enslaved rainbow.
---
Hilariously enough, I got that achievement for tombstoning all 4 survivors on that intense corn map on the first try after rank reset. If it was red ranks, probably would've been stomped on.
---
Bro....
---
I love this...omg
---
Borrowed time, Balanced Landing, Self-care,  Urban Evasion. When I have a med-kit I switch self-care with either Unbreakable or Diversion. The latter is just for laughs, it’s funny watching the killer be all confused and search the area
---
Thats a really cool idea!

hook twice then mori

---
oh i found the image online
---
&gt; the reward get an escape cake ready up and just get on with it :D
---
Since as long as I can remember, wiggling on the hook signifies the killer is in proximity. It allows others to know this. Don't downvote me, no need.
---
THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED LIKE 2 GAMES AGO
---
Lmao
---
The offerings will decide your fate
---
Always get billy. *Its almost always billy*
---
Oh wow, I was wondering what the hell happened.  I can forgive this legion for nodding smugly.
---
I'm fine, guess the truth hurts some people's feelings.
---
Literally it’s so anti-fun
---
I farmed as hag, I got called boring and survivors walked out with 20k bp. I played casually as ace, someone DCed at the beginning and the plague slugs at the start to take advantage of 3 people. I play as wraith I get called a bitch for playing the game when someone DCs. wtf does this community want from me
---
No not Bedazzled, or the Mummy series even. Geez I'm not a monster :P
---
She looks like an extra on Spartacus
---
Not much of a difference. It only takes 1 person to say "I saw him going over ____".
---
Then their friends will get an idea go where you are going
---
Statistically, in my experience, it pays to drop and move on. I for one prefer not to DC or suicide except on special occasions.
---
I like it. I like most maps without many open spaces, no matter whether I'm playing killer or survivor.
---
Also, you gotta admit the bathroom gen placement is hilarious.
---
Demagorgon should be higher definitely, his shred now breaks pallets by default
---
You've been hooked ever since? Wow, your teammates left you on first hook. Report.
---
At this point I'm all for a survivor strike to just keep DC'ing till they fix the fucking bp ratio.
---
You know how we have the meme about devs  "We did a pretty good job so far" right now? Well back then we had "MINDGAMES" because devs called spots like this one exactly that - mindgames.
---
And for real, they were truly infinite looping spots, because unless survivor was new or completely braindead there was no way to get a hit as a killer. And every map had multiple of these spots mind you. Damn, now that i think of it, i have no idea how did I do good as a killer back then. I guess the game was new so people didn't know how to play...
---
sounds like killers hurt yours considering you're inappropriately using the term incel
---
Just Michael Things
---
The best youtuber
---
I know I’m never touching this game again if I can’t play with my friends
---
I agree, this game is really all about small and subtle advantages.
---
You as well, friend!
---
you're just not a pro gaymer
---
The core game is survivors working *together* to survive against a killer
---
It’s fair for the killer, but unfair for higher ranks. It really didn’t solve much in my opinion
---
I don’t think Demo can travel to portals that are in the process of being closed, like if you’re on it and performing the close portal action he can’t use it
---
Happened to me yesterday too
---
Downing survivors with the ambush attacks instaheals the survivor instead and gives them a permanent sprint burst.
---
Survivors: Oh god here comes Michael
---
Me, in their DM’s: “Hip, hop, a hip hop hap, I’m giving you all,
---
The Michael Myers Rap.”
---
Solo players: Point at gen, pallet, or chest, while keeping a distance. “Do That” 
---
Killer: Fuck.
---
Even if there was a fake do gen option, a smart survivor would stand by the gen and see that it wasn’t increasing.
---
Also, there’s no way that the killer could get in close for a hit in SWF. A survivor with x&gt;6 is gonna keep their distance while asking. New metas would be bringing a medkit or something to make sure m1 isn’t in use

Most killers are tbh as long as you do well. He doesn’t get any more points than anyone else, he just fills up a little faster.
---
Yes, matchmaking is trash right now. It makes it really tough to move up a rank when it keeps putting you with teammates that are beginner Rank 20's. The other day I got down ranked because I was paired with 20's who refused to work on gens and just wanted to rescue each other all game, it's extremely frustrating but luckily I usually manage to escape via hatch whenever I'm paired with Rank 20's.
---
tysm ;-; &lt;3
---
What about a killer with a utility belt? The ability to use an item wheel to select interactive objects but only one of each. Basic machete, a spear, a trap, another tool or two? I'd enjoy it, he'd be a killer that punishes the surv who doesnt pay attention and a killer that can reward the adept.
---
Not to mention if they had different reach weapons on the killer they might figure out some things about some of these lunge ranges on everyone else. Maybe.
---
1 - Cause streaming content 
---
2 - Downvotes from people thinking I'm using deliverance?
---
3 - GF mains not like seeing their boi get dunked on XD
---
4 - My voice (I've been told it sounds like a rocks in a blender)
---
I had fun, as you can tell
---
Something else that could be interesting, going off the paranoia idea, is as it builds that player looks different to the rest of the survivors. If they are playing Meg and the paranoia is really high, they appear as Nea to everyone else. Dunno, just a dumb thought. I like the paranoia idea, would love to see The Thing.
---
As ghostface main I appreciate this post. 😱
---
Suicide by hook is the big brain dc
---
I'm just glad I was streaming it, one of those moments if I was to tell the tale, I'd get called on it. The old saying "Fraps or it didn't happen"

Certainly living up to your username

Okay but why tho

It was a rough night of matches, but that 1 minute made up for it XD

thats an easy challenge for Vigo

Maybe they shouldn't suck?

If you put a hentai mc this wont be a challenge
---
Hmm,  I might go plague.
---
It’s annoying dude. I’ve escaped only once today. Can’t even play killer because the wait on PS is so long.
---
Idk i kinda also want sex
---
It's actually decent in handheld mode. Kinda nice starting fresh. No one's running full meta perks and nurse runs better for me on switch than on Xbox. No idea why but that's how it seems
---
Underrated
---
You just let him go. What a nice guy
---
You’re definitely exaggerating but remember people grind the game a lot so many people have map offerings for days except the new map so your chances are low at getting it often. Anyway just keep playing I’m sure you’ll get an offering to go to it soon. I’ve got a few right now.
---
How bout i give you insight one were i was hmm? I was inside those houses in the michael map, minding my own business after i was healing a dwight, i go up stairs and i see her close to a pretty good loop spot, i start working on it so if she gets caught i can go unhook her, next thing i know she goes blazing through the door up the stairs and vaults, next thing i know im being hooked into oblivion and no one comes to help.
---
You seem to care since you responded
---
Im so excited to wait 15 minutes to play killer, so i can get two guaranteed disconnects every game!  Thank you so much Behavior for looking out for us killer mains! Much love. Always got the big brains at full force.
---
Her add-ons suck ass they have lots of negatives and change her playstyle too much compared to other killers. She needs a few more straight buff add-ons that don’t mess with muscle memory so much.
---
HUNGY. 😍
---
In your case i get it,But she wasn't on he last hook.
---
You’re welcome.
---
No
---
Would be awesome if I could find teammates that didnt just camp outer wall whole time while i pump out generators. Then camp hatch while i waste away on a hook on my first life. Game sucks if you dont have a sqaud :(

I do understand the point of people coordinating and using swf as a huge advantage, but just because you’re playing swf doesn’t automatically grant you a win. I play swf with my friends often and I’d say we’re all around different skill level as well so it’s not like we win every single time, but we just enjoy playing together. Honestly, usually one of us dies every game if not more than that. We hardly ever all escape.
---
We don’t demolish killers and we aren’t toxic. We’re just there to have fun. And honestly, the only time we do talk on mic (we play on PS4) it’s mainly just to joke around. But we don’t follow each other or gen rush or even try to coordinate too much even though we could. We play normally. 
---
Not every swf group is like this, yeah, but some people really do just want to have fun with their friends. Besides that, taking it out would ensure that a lot of people just stop playing the game entirely.
---
What? nurse has some of the most broken addons in the game. 
---
Addons that increase range and addons that give more blinks are op and you're delusional if you can't see that
---
Everyone just brings envelopes :(
---
if you're a Killer main, good.
---
early impressions make it feel HEAVILY survivor sided, like Haddonfield levels of bad.
---
i live for moments like these
---
It doesnt remove the toxicity, but I hide the chat on nights when i just cant deal with that bullshit. Regardless of GGs or not, theres a lot of times I'd just rather let my performance as killer speak for me.
---
Pig doesn't get shit
---
The forbidden Demo head lol
---
Same, I’ve only escaped once too. I can only imagine how PS is right now. I’m on PC.
---
Have you seen Quentin? Ghostface wants nothing to do with that.
---
You have to be able to load up the teleport fully before they close it, and you'll teleport. If they close it first, before the grey teleport bar is done loading, then you won't be able to.
---
When you want to post in the DBD sub but you only speak in random word generator...
---
That fucking face lol
---
Oh my God, any perk that shows my aura to other survivors is like an invitation to bring the killer right to me.
---
Sure, get us both killed why don't you?
---
I don’t understand at all. DCing on a BPS makes you a fucking moron. And at that, base kit Nurse takes skill and if you’re actually having problems with Freddy you can’t be past rank 10. Split pressure and constantly wake up when possible
---
Yup, you need $$$ to pay the people to do the eptimization
---
How the fuck was I supposed to know that was a joke there was no satire at all
---
Probably just got banned but all smiles over here
---
How can you play as a Billy, and not get sent to Coldwind?
---
Plague by far
---
Her toe!
---
Makes sense, thanks for the explanation.
---
Lol calling Legion boring while simutaneously suggesting Spirit. 😂🤣
---
About 120,000 i remember most of the players bringing event cake offering
---
Legit had two matches as Billy back to back. First one, got sent to The Game. Second, Lery's. Wanted to kill myself lol
---
That's what my friend told me, was it a visual glitch that I went from r4, to r3 on that d/c? That persisted until I got 2 pips next match?
---
I'm a Nurse main. Lemme give my 2 cents about ur ideas. 
---
&gt;the amount of distance you can cover with 4-5 blinks seems to begin to outway the stun in my short time playing her.
---
This is correct. Nurse with 1-2 blinks is rather balanced. It's when Nurse gets 3 or more blinks that the imbalance begins to kick in. This is bc with every blink she has an extra bit of room for error and the Survivior has less and less counterplay. 
---
&gt;Another thing that seems to make her just that bit more annoying is her lunge. Now, I'm not saying take her lunge away, but what I am saying is that I think it would be an interesting idea for her ability to lunge to be either halved/removed when she blinks for a second time,
---
Her lunge in general is very long. It should definitely be nerfed by a solid 25-30%. But halving it or removing it is definitely too much. Her swing coming out of her blink is fairly short and you almost never blink right on top of someone unless they were playing poorly. A solid 25-30% nerf would be fine, not crippling but enough to feel it. 
---
&gt;Compared to many in the community I'm a baby but even at my point, I can see there is some pretty hard-baked in things that can make the game much less fun for one side or the other.
---
I wish you luck in playing Nurse my dude. She's not an easy killer by any stretch, buy she's a ton of fun and her power is not to be neglected.
---
More blinks = useless for a good killer and messes with how you play her. Range is good though.
---
Hi, decently new to the community. Have watched true some times but besides being cocky haven't seen much wrong. Could you give me some of those reasons?
---
I hear you, I've been down ranked from Purple to Green twice now because my wack random teammates are apparently piss poor at playing the objective or they play the objective too much and don't rescue me. I really need a squad to run with on this game.
---
auf wiedersehn
---
Her add ons are amazing. Even the brown ones are good. You have to consciously understand that there are add ons changing something with your blink. 
---
Save for that, have you seen Omegablink? It's broken.
---
I've seen the chainsaw version but never the karate version and I seriously cannot stop fucking laughing. Oh my god. Why. Just why.
---
Like 142k
---
Ironic. He could kill everyone else, but not himself.
---
well the way i see it i’d rather just die/escape quick where as with legion you’re mending the whole game or getting tunneled
---
That fat kid from iCarly?
---
It feels bad getting your butt kicked but it is still important to have good sportsmanship.
---
No need to stay for potential toxicity making it worse. Lol
---
Sorry but where are you getting these numbers from? They are inaccurate by a lot. If you’ve seen the new gameplay of him or played with/against him it’s very clear to see it is faster than a normal break. It’s also (more importantly) faster than any other killers ability that breaks a pallet (chainsaws) from charge time to having full control again, which is ridiculous.
---
Okay with me as long as they don't keep running from me when im LITERALLY UP THEIR ASS without hitting them
---
*oh god oh fuck I think I’m looking to much into it*
---
It's called moonwalking and it isn't new. Lol
---
Yeah it was patches
---
In a perfect world, your max PERSONAL earning would be 128,960 BP (32k base + 32k perk bonus + 32,960 Gateau offering + 32k Bloodhunt bonus). This is not including any other offerings that other players may burn. 
---
Now if you were to have great luck and earn a perfect 32k game in which you received 4 stacks of WGLF/BBQ and all 5 players burned Gateau offerings, all during this Bloodhunt, your max earnings in a game can reach 260,800 BP!
---
Best ghostface build is NOED, Make your choice, haunted grounds, and Iron Maiden
---
I mean Open Handed is a fine perk in aura-related builds or just to buff your team. *Up the Ante, on the other hand...*
---
i be lOoOooPiN
---
That Kate has to be boosted.. unless she was just playing braindead.
---
I'm gonna try that
---
The Spirit. She's just not fun at all to play against, man.
---
Ataxic, Catatonic, Wooden horse, Torn bookmark, Cincture, Fragile Wheeze, Campbells, Bad man's, Spasmodic, and Pocket watch are all amazing add-ons. 
---
That's 11/20 of her add-ons. Well over half of her add-ons are really good.
---
Shoot the man give input to your post which is clearly a vent post and you criticize his opinion of Freddy and call him low rank! Super positive behavior.... kinda like DCing when they see you are plague
---
Yeah, that would actually make looping more difficult for the veteran players. Would be super interesting to play against
---
I can just see the outline of Claudette's bloody stupid hairstyle and stupid thin shoulders peaking out.  It ain't even godly because I can't see through corn.
---
But let's be real here, ain't nobody seeing dick in corn.
---
That's not at all true
---
The fact that bubba and ghostface's power are basically only instadowns, no one on this fucking planet, and I mean no one, is this dumb to actually want to nerf them. Then again, sorry
---
Yeah, as a killer main I can say that swf isn't the issue.
---
The issue is swf teams that use instaheals and toolboxes
---
As some one who plays both sides from what ive seen they both are pulling out the sweaty guns. Survs i face as killer been bringing insta heals etc and killers been tunneling etc. besides the trash talk i think its the guarantee blood points. So say as killer if u tunnel thats guarantee sacrifice and bp and for surv if u insta heal thats a prolonged chase etc so more bps. In the end ppl are greedy lil blood point whores lol
---
You lose your offerings and you de-pip. Don’t do it. Especially as killer.
---
Yeah your type of swf isn't a problem.
---
they can gain Hunter and Brutality faster than any other killer due to the ability to gain more than 2 scoring events per chase, (i.e. it's easy to hit everyone more than 2 times per chase) and gains Deviousness pretty quickly as well.
---
Legion is the only killer capable of getting minimum 20k bloodpoints, a pip, and still never kill anyone in the average non-farming match.
---
thats kinky
---
I appreciate that Michael is gradually taking over. He controls the horizontal and the vertical. He kills without Moris. He is the one who memes.
---
Or goofing off
---
this says a lot about our society
---
That's not Quentin...
---
Smart play
---
The Game and Lery's are my favourite maps.
---
Masochism is underrated (also Plag is super good on the Game especially)
---
Kinda the same with NOED though. As soon as I see that the killer has NOED, I'm far less likely to go for a save if the gate is available to me.
---
You have no idea of what stupid fucking ideas I've heard about killer ability nerfs and this isn't even one of the worst
---
Put it outside for Halloween.
---
Are the candle underneath it to light it like a hex?
---
Or maybe pay more BP to survivors and they'll be less inclined to DC and go to the next match.
---
Yes, but it's not a good idea to light them on the carpet. I'm going to get battery powered candles eventually
---
Got it, you're salty you got mori'd.
---
If i go by top three it would be 1)doctor 2)freddy 3)clown. Docs just annoying in general, clowns boring as balls and his gas hurts my eyes and freddys can be fun but in my experiences freddys usually are jerks
---
Killer didn't bring a hex perk
---
No, they are mediocre at best - fragile wheeze, Ataxic,  Campbell's, and catatonic are nurses only good addons.
---
you seriously complaining about body blocking? lol
---
Or it was an endgame hex
---
If the map is small the stealth wouldn't matter and having a windstorm add-on completes it all. I get what you're saying though. Would be very situational if it ended up working in your favor
---
That's what he wants you to think, it's all a ruse.
---
I only ever get Billy’s and GF’s in red ranks on xbox.. Well I mostly get purple/green killers bc matchmaking is shit atm but yea p much all of my red rank games are Billy or Ghostface.
---
Does anyone not?
---
Besides the human sweat glands who live and breathe infinites.
---
Yes, don't get me wrong, it's smart and I would do it too. But it doesn't make it any less annoying.
---
Dude. I'm a Nurse main, and you are completely wrong.
---
Spirit. Cheap killer and horrendously unfun, not even touching on how op some of her addons are.
---
He's got shit to do.
---
Post the picture with them lit up when you do! Looks sick!
---
Damn. I bought the game early 2017 and stopped for a bit.
---
just hit them? drop the slugged person and get stabbing... free hits.
---
Being a nurse main means you're going to do good no matter what, the strength of the add-ons is irrelevant.
---
I’m literally playing killers that I never use just to get a BPS yet these greedy P3 fucks still use escape cakes.
---
You do know that the game existed before SWF was implemented right? 
---
I always find these threats from SWF players that "if BHVR ever got rid of it or nerfed it in the slightest then the playerbase would collapse" to be hilariously pathetic.
---
Noice
---
It was literally ruin. End screen showed it, had a pop up of it but every totem on map was dull
---
someone call an ambulance I think he's had a stroke
---
You do unfortunately.
---
By chance were you playing on the snowy map?
---
Hag because her traps always scare the shit out of me
---
Oh... I'm not talking about that kind of body blocking, I see the confusion. I am talking about survivors body blocking the survivor doing a totem, force you to hit them instead of the person you're chading, or body blocking injured survivors so that they can get to the exit gates.
---
Aren't ALL of the Killers except Demo just dudes with some powers? If that?
---
I guess Spirit is legit a ghost, but you can physically beat her up with pallets and she has ONE power, instead of The Grudge's 72 Earthly Damnations, so she's on thin ice.
---
OBJECTION!
---
"The Ghost Face" in DbD isn't the antagonist(s) from Scream! It's the license for the mask that Killer used!
---
Did they play an offering where they get to play a different killer? If they did the stat screen she's the original killers perks, but the offering killer plays with no perks.
---
Spirit didn't GET to kill anyone. With the way Rancor and her mori work, it seems like she just THINKS whoever she's hunting is her father.
---
First time ever playing him when the switch version launched. He’s ruined all the other killers for me. He seems pretty balanced but I do feel like his stalk ability is way too good haha
---
idrk why people downvoted me, I’m just memeing christ
---
What shit are you on? Freddy is like the 3-4th best killer in the game atm. I consistently win with him in red ranks without bringing ruin. He can't deal with swf like Nurse or Spirit can, but he's not easy to deal with either. Lol
---
A. Why did you delete the other comments? They contributed to the discussion
---
B. Why don't I deserve an answer?
---
Most of these just make the killers worse and don’t actually give you any decent gain to BP, they just help you fill out deviousness, so stay away from using these.
---
You don't lose offerings if someone doesn't load in
---
You can if you mori after second hook. I aim to hook everyone twice before mori'ing (that is, I won't start using my Mori until EVERYONE has been hooked twice). The 1000BP it gives after those hooks is soo good, that you don't even need to 4K to get 8000BP in sacrifice. You can literally let the last person go and still max out your sacrifice. I find it fair to only Mori after 2 hooks and I go the extra mile to hook everyone once, then everyone twice, then Mori
---
You don't lose offerings if someone fails to load in.
---
Farming is boring, but nice guide on how to get max points while playing the game for real!
---
Huntress is outright a human who hasn't been empowered or mangled by the Entity, but she's very, very stupid. Can't figure out children need food.
---
The fact is the game was never designed to work with SWF, and especially SWF that use voice communications. It was literally built for solo survivors and the devs themselves said before SWF was implemented that doing so would break the game.
---
However it's also a fact that SWF isn't going away, so I feel the best way the devs could counter balance it would be to give SWF a debuff based on how many in their party. Also Object shouldn't be allowed to be used in SWF period....but none of that is ever going to happen because SWF players are without doubt THE most entitled, loudest, whiniest group in the fanbase that lose their shit any time anyone even mentions how easy they've got it.
---
It was the doctor
---
Santa Clown seems to have a 50/50 chance of being a horrible asshole or being really nice, so I'm glad you landed on the good side of the coin.
---
Are you ok ? I'm literally asking a question and you replying like I broke ya foot . Please seek help .
---
*unzip*
---
And other hilarious jokes you can tell yourself
---
Not only that but they actually made original movies instead of just redoing their old movies except without the animation that we all loved them for. 
---
Somehow still the second richest entity on the planet though
---
Theres even a very brief window after it's closed that he can still target it
---
My significant 2k hour game experience vs thousands upon thousands of SWF groups is just "my feelings?" Honestly, I could say your entire argument is just based on assumptions as well. You assume that all the SWF players would keep playing if they could group anymore. That's a VERY tall assumption, that one would have to be very inexperienced to believe.
---
Hell, I personally play with 4 people that literally do not play outside of SWF. They find the game boring without a group.
---
I've been getting a lot of Ghostface recently too, but I haven't seen a billy in a long time. But good lord, the amount of spirits I get is insane.
---
Like 230k
---
Oh, if your internet connection "dies" the game lets you keep your item. If I was using a white ward and the killer had Franklin's, I would go into a locker and never come back out. There might be crows on my locker and gates may be open, but I'm not coming out of my locker.

---
Ruin was working. None of us got out cause only 1 gen could get done
---
every swf game I play has one purple rank, two yellow and one green. (we all started at different times) yes, rank doesn't mean everything, but we also aren't toxic and we don't have a high percentage on the escape side. still enjoy the hell out of it. I would hate if they even hinted at removing that.
---
Kind of? He has a massive terror radius and can still be looped.
---
I'm in this picture and I don't like it.
---
Man cmon why’d you mori me I only teabagged like once at a teammate bro
---
Ah. Thinking that moris shouldn't exist in their current state is now one of the "stupidest" opinions you've seen.
---
Are you new to the internet? Or read your own statement regarding moris equaling "protection" from toxicity?
---
Also saying "Git gud" which has literally no relevance to anything in this discussion. 10/10.
---
Got 141k last game
---
Spend time with the nurse. If you can learn her well, you’ll be unstoppable. Especially at low ranks. Ive had the game for over a year and still havent learned the nurse very well
---
Hawt
---
Ghostface and Steve for me
---
Is the rank seperation thing already in place? I tried queueing with a rank 20 when I'm at rank 11 to show them the ropes and they kept getting dropped when I got into a lobby
---
What is even going on in that comment thread?
---
Wow you sure are smart, if you honestly think the playerbase wouldn't die then you prob think spirit is balanced 2.
---
I had been playing survivor exclusively for two hours after the event started; I was farmed to death in my first game when one bp was burned, was farmed again in the next game, and that's when I decided  to focus on doing bones with small game.
---
It just really sucks because I would never intentionally unhook someone when the killer is *right* next to me; the Kate that killed me literally got hit and then unhooked me. I run Borrowed Time on the two survivors I main 100% of the time, it ain't hard.
---
Discordance be like.
---
I think it depends on the addons they would use since we have insta down huntress, infinite tier three miers, etc
---
I’m not good as her but I would say Nurse
---
I’m just here to make sure no one gives the Legion any wins.
---
Just want all my killers to have BBQ and chilly so when the event ends the BP grind doesn’t feel soooo slooowww haha
---
&gt; My significant 2k hour game experience vs thousands upon thousands of SWF groups is just "my feelings?"
---
Yes. It's *literally* anecdotal evidence.
---
&gt;I could say your entire argument is just based on assumptions as well.
---
I haven't made an argument. What I stated about SWF not being in the game from the start is an objective, verifiable fact.
---
&gt;You assume that all the SWF players would keep playing if they could group anymore.
---
Please point out where I said this. I'll wait. Not only did I never say anything like that, I've also never said SWF should be removed from the game. So now you're just straight making things up.
---
&gt;Hell, I personally play with 4 people that literally do not play outside of SWF. They find the game boring without a group.
---
Good for you mate. I personally don't play SWF anymore since it makes the game way too easy and know of others that do the same. I guess that makes it a fact right?
---
Whenever I ran Infinite Tier 3 Myers those problems never really showed up for me. Mostly in DC's and survivors slowly noticing my Tier 3 isn't going away ever.
---
Legion is the worst, but DISCORDINENECE is an amazing perk
---
How? Every pallet on the map is unsafe, it’s a killers wet dream for me
---
This game is boring without a group. High rank survivor is garbage without at least a 3 q of SWF, even then a bad teamate can bring down 3 good players just by existing.
---
Survivors would have to be buffed if swf got removed, and you know killers will complain about that constantly.

BIG BRAIN
---
Steve and Nance
---
Probably billy or the trapper. However leatherface does have other worldly strength if you catch my drift
---
Not true. The open hand is related to movement speed (Open hand when moving slower) which is why you see it with tombstone which can be countered with Play With Your Food. Tombstone Piece has no tell until Myers suddenly murders you.
---
Quest for P3 Quintin.
---
Stalk really does intensify.
---
Omega blink nurses don't care about being to blink long distances ironically.
---
No one uses ataxic or catatonic for the ability to blink across the map. Charge speed is a qol, it doesn't actually help you catch survivors. Extra blinks are some of the few add-ons I said were good. Blink movement speed just means it's harder to juke which doesn't really matter because you're playing nurse.
---
I just had this happen to me. Like five minutes ago.
---
A survivor insta-heals and the killer has to hit them again. That's more BPs, but is seen as an "inconvenience". I don't get it. Like I don't care about the event or getting any characters to P3, because it doesn't do anything...Nothing changes.
---
I tested it the other day. Physically yanked my cable and I kept a medkit I looted from a chest as well as my BP.
---
I sometimes struggle not to cry when games go really fuckin bad
---
Why the fuck do u even play a video game if u want to go Farming? Sheesh just do real work or read books to dogs or some shit
---
are you dumb? explain the counter play to spirit. why would i chose spirit and not nurse if the only thing im complaining about is how strong the killer is? 
---
The fact you think spirit isnt broken makes you look like an actual clown. Honk honk buddy
---
I'm curious what Ojomo looked like before he became The Wraith.
---
This is how I know you don't play Nurse
---
Sorry I’m probably just being salty right now.
---
Not all killers have to look scary. God damn!
---
Fantastic quality, good editing. Highly questionable plays.
---
With her nipple out
---
Just happened to me as well about 2 hours ago 😥
---
And killers that facecamped in the right spot stopped survivors from even attempting to unhook you because you could only unhook in a certain spot
---
same except my survivors all bring instaheal medkits, balanced landing, self care and adrenaline.
---
and they burn Escape! Cakes instead of BPS.
---
I'm letting every survivor go as long as I get a single BPS.  
---
Otherwise you can go to the Entity.
---
Lot of stupid people that don't understand how to get bloodpoints :/
---
All 4 legions would get wrecked by probably every killer.
---
His hand is open because the devs were too lazy to animate him opening his hand when he moris a survivor with tombstone.
---
I can tell that Hag was probably smashing their controller or keyboard after that, well played
---
Ghost Face main, can confirm that this happens more often than you'd think
---
Same happened to me with about 35% left. Pissed af. How do they keep fucking shit they don’t touch?
---
Why u waste the pallet
---
This guide is gold and absolutely shouldn't die on new. Thanks for all the tips! Happy double-bloodpoints event to all!
---
He’s gotta go check his ruin totem
---
yep
---
I am 100% sure it's related to movement speed. I was messing around with a controller in KYF and when I pushed lightly on the analogue stick, Myers hand was open. I've also been tombstone piece'd by a Myers on Rank Reset a few months ago and his hand was closed.
---
Haven’t seen it before hotfix but I never made it to endgame collapse as survivor when stranger things patch came out. Always got kicked early.
---
Huntress
---
Bottom left lust
---
He was clearly just getting his warm up exercise on.
---
Kick gens like Liu Kang
---
Yeah I remember that one.  Trapper also used to be able to put a trap right in front of where a Survivor would have to unhook a hooked Survivor at, thus they'd get trapped the moment after they unhook their fellow Survivor.
---
dont know
---
Well his perks are trash, people on the know won’t buy him.
---
Are his perks any good I'm looking to buy a survivor and a killer
---
&gt; are you dumb?
---
Clearly I must be, at least compared to someone with your shining intelligence.
---
The counter to Spirit is mindgames. It's what her entire powerset is built around. Call me Krusty then I guess. Sorry I like an actual challenge and not just running from loop to loop until I'm eventually caught.
---
Obviously Legion
---
Ah what people would do on console is testing their NAT type. It would let’s them get their pip with a bonus to unbroken so you always get it gold and your item and bp
---
Steve, Bill and finish levelling up Ash
---
It’s not even debatable, Nurse is the best killer in this game.
---
Yep. It's fun af.
---
this is totally going into r/dbdgonewild
---
Huntress with Iri head. Just stand somewhere safe and snipe for days
---
Fuck being good, it’s all about that Campbell loyalty
---
Scoops ahoy
---
why? Its just like Plague, with a bigger Terror Radius
---
No fun allowed.
---
Do you really not know why Omega blink nurse is powerful? Increased blink distance means you also blink short distances faster because it takes the same amount of charge time to blink further distance. Lol
---
This happened to me. I got cocky at the exit gate (all 3 of us could have escaped) and I ending up getting downed and hooked. Then the other two came to save me but they died to the end game even though there was loads of time left. I wasn't even mad though I deserved it.
---
Yes I'm aware of this. 
---
It also allows you to cross the map even faster and apply pressure even better. There are non-chase benefits for Omegablink.
---
tier 3 has longer lunge
---
Nothing I said was DbD specific.
---
so?
---
BaeTier already explained it for the most part, but Legion's mobility and ability to snowball wounds helps him rack up points very quickly.  During the summer event or w/e with the fancy-named cake offerings I could regularly get like 70k bloodpoints without a 4K.
---
Dont forget that toxicness goes both ways with tunneling, camping and mori spamming. I do sympathize with some killers as I play both sides, but it also lets me see the toxicness of both sides of the playerbase.
---
if you mean rage quits middle of the game yeah i agree
---
longer lunge usually fucks you up quickly
---
Nurse the best. My favorite is myers
---
Idk about you guys but for me The Legion is one of the scariest killers in the game. For some reason, the way he runs at you and vaults the pallets always creeps me out.
---
An incredible drawing, but that's not meg.
---
No one cares about the non-chase benefits because everyone is dead.
---
only if you wanna be Ultra pallet efficient
---
That's when it's time to take a break
---
infinite tier 3 myers is still terrifying to go against
---
One the best maps for gf tbh
---
Sad part for me is I bought BBQ when it was on shrine of secrets ages ago and it just won't pop up on my bloodweb for any of my killers :(
---
hate farming and never will do it, but you wrote this well
---
Or just don't bring streamers so you don't get pissed
---
you got to try to remember when the gens popped at to try to stop this. when running in a straight line after popping a gen, skip a gen here and there. works wonders
---
You could say he wanted a captive audience.
---
Spirit is my bae.
---
Nope, perks are bad.
---
Michael Myers with that chainsaw is terrifying!
---
Proximity?
---
If its a big ol battle royale then probably wraith cause he can just chill in the corner and no one knows, then wipe out the last couple when theyre tired. If its like a 1v1 thing probably huntress or billy
---
its an iron maiden for your unmentionables.
---
Or you'll poop it
---
That killer is beyond mad
---
If anything it's killer sided, for the most part though I think it is pretty balanced.
---
The Meme Myers

The Hot Myers

The fast asf boiii Myers

More like you broke your head. I'm literally telling you whats up. It's pure RNG what you get from the bloodweb every single time and you tell me that "No lol, something with my bloodweb is totally broken" When in reality it's not broken for you in any way and you are just being unlucky.
---
Heaven help survivors if you're playing Freddy, they will never know where he is coming from. Lol
---
In regards to your assumed reading comprehension issues: I said, "You assume that all the SWF players would keep playing if they could group anymore." Which by the way, has to be true if you do believe that the game would be fine if SWF was axed. Regardless, you said I was putting words in your mouth and that you do not believe this. Using my brain and very primitive logic, that means that you think the only other option, that many players would leave if SWF was axed. You can't believe neither because that's impossible. So please tell me the flaw in my assumptions. 
---
Back on topic, I can use your own arguments against you. Please do provide me proof that players would not leave in droves if they got rid of SWF. Of course there is no statistics on this matter, don't be a moron. That's why I'm using experience and the apparent experience of many other comments on this thread as my arguments. There is a shit ton of SWF groups even if it's just a duo. Getting rid of SWF would make at very least a significant amount of survivors quit because they don't like playing alone. Which would drastically increase killer queues, leading to make some killers quit also. None of that is far-fetched assumptions, that's just how literally all things would go. 
---
Best case scenario is that the game has a smaller population, less new players willing to try the game, and Behaviour takes a hit in profits and future sales. Worst case scenario, a very significant amount of survivors quit, leading to killers quitting, leading to massive profit loss and massive new player rate decline. Obviously anywhere in this spectrum is a very bad thing, so no this isn't "Chicken Little," it would be a very bad, stupid, idea to get rid of SWF.
---
I get the map all the time
---
Since I have everyone to at least 40, I’m just going to work on prestiging my Spirit to 3 &amp; also prestiging Steve &amp; Nancy. Going to get all the good perks back on my already-prestiged Meg.

Dwights get pips too!

BHVR pls buff Diversion by making killers play a stunned sfx when hit by the pebble.

Nice.

Is a real shame. Haven't gotten Nurse's on hardly any of my killers.

We get it bro you're so hard
---
&gt;killer seems to attract the most desperate and helpless of incels
---
That’s quite the conclusion to jump to
---
&gt;attracts a more altruistic team based type 
---
Like the blendette that dced when I found her? Or the farming David? Or the Adam unhooking directly in front of me for deliverance?
---
You Discordance level 2 ? You should buy it to get to level 3
---
You can’t
---
Dis made me chuckle
---
These look cool, but the last thing the game needs is MORE obvious totems lol
---
Lmfao!
---
Where did I say SWF should be removed from the game?
---
Was she pregnant with his baby or something?
---
Hahah, you see you definitely mean to swap the photos. Because otherwise you would be making fun of my thiccywicky boi The Clown, 
---
honest mistake
---
It 4 horseman not 7 deadly sins so no
---
I try not to buy anything remotely connected to it and it kinda works
---
Because when you try to show new people how to play they get destroyed, rage quit and never play again. Tried to get my brother to play, im rank 11 and he couldnt do anything, at all. Bullying killers sucks but scaring off new players does too
---
Baited them into going that way
---
This happened to me yesterday but I still got the 30k. The survivors weren't amazing though... Unsafe unhooks everywhere so it was easy to get.
---
There is a certain breed of player that will do so precisely because you get less.
---
I guess
---
Not Otz
---
the mask is the best part
---
Imagine using NOED on a Ghostface. Just 99% everyone before the last gen, it's like a built-in NOED
---
I wish they added this during October
---
Yeah, the smiling masks are the best
---
Did you get the daily?
---
All falls have a invisible wall so survivors cant dead hard while getting hit, and go flying insane distances, you used to be able to escape The Game, by deadharding over a dropped pallet in front of the exit gate
---
Lol
---
Sorry dude, was gonna upvote but saw an iFunny watermark. As a dank offensive memes Instagrammer with 500 followers, I'm afraid I cannot let this SJW normie trash on my good Christian page. It's time for a crusade. Know your place, trash.
---
What are you humping
---
Even cuter than before
---
Not in that game but the next one I did get the daily done.
---
Because you use Level 1 whispers
---
I’m twerking, boomer.
---
Up The Ante is funny to run when I feel like blaming everything that happens on luck.
---
This video is a pure work of art
---
I play on xbox. If I do well as a killer, I get hate mail. If I do poorly as a killer, I get hate mail
---
What the fuk is a boomer
---
Baby boomer???
---
Does the switch version not have LF on it?
---
They stack like this: If you make 20k points you get 20k for bloody party streamers, 20k for bbq and chilli and 20k for the x2 weekend.
---
Imagine if the killer started throwing money from the stairs. 💸
---
despite making up only 20% of the game population, 100% of murders are committed by killers.  coincidence?
---
Hey guys I found the boomer

That's what my dog looks like with a stuffed animal

Again, everyone else- *is dead*
---
Hey I know I'm super late to this post and new but I was just wondering, how does one farm during a game like this? Like if the survivors want to farm with me how do I do it without killing them and them getting mad that I didn't farm?
---
Make it rainnn 💸💸💸💸
---
replace rancor with noed or ruin
---
I was directly responding to your last statement mocking people for claiming the games playerbase would collapse without the option to play the game with friends.  It absolutely would.  There is a huge chunk of players that only play the game to enjoy it with friends.  Take that away and you'd lose them.  Queues would suffer immensely and they aren't good to begin with.

You have some weird assumptions kid

It's a creepypasta that I believe originated on 4Chan, basically with the premise that there's an infinite network of rooms you can access if you noclip through certain areas of the real world where you're hunted by an invisible monster

You just called me kid. You must be mid 40’s at least.
---
a person born in the years following World War II, when there was a temporary marked increase in the birth rate. Thanks Google
---
Implying there was a time when it was not a mess
---
What's "reverse" about it though? This means there is a normal dick trap that does something else.
---
I think they should incorporate an in game voice that the killer can hear it’s distance related if your half way across map your team shouldn’t know you found ruin or what type of killer it is until you find and meet up
---
Also cuz they pull my camera which is aggravating.
---
That's cool. This happened to me yesterday and I got it done first try because my half of my survivors were Galaxy brain.
---
Switch does not have Feddy or LF likely due to licensing issues.
---
Apparently their perks are free on the switch version now but I haven't seen them yet.
---
Lol got me on this one

Lol... I just decided against queueing with a key because I’ve lost 2 now. Fuck this.

Me playing legion with equal opportunity stabbing:
---
The unhooked gets a stab
---
The unhooker gets a stab
---
The blendette shitting in the tall grass gets a stab
---
The Adam working on the gen with the toolbox gets a stab
---
please if youre gonna be using flashlights, never use odd bulbs, green battery and focus lens are easily the best add ons for flashlights
---
I was playing Ash with two Naceys and a Scoops Steve, the huntress literally ignored me and tunneled the Naceys who weren't great runners, Steve on the other hand was great and looped her while I soloed two gens, she got Steve eventually though.
---
I mean she was so entranced by the Stranger things characters I kept running up and body blocking and all she did was try and not wack me but then when I trapped her she just wacked me and got back to chasing the others.
---
I got MoM to activate from all the body blocks and made it to the hatch because of it, you have no idea how hard it is to get Mettle of Man to activate, that's how many times I body blocked that match.
---
Not on early bloodweb.
---
I knew Freddy was caught up in some lawsuit, but that surprises me that LF has licensing problems at the moment
---
Almost 30 but but by your clap back I assumed you were 14 to 16
---
That’s tuff
---
Well ye, its like one consumable thats worth saving for bloodhunt
---
Alright cool. I’m new to being toxic so I guess this’ll help! Thanks!

It only adds 100 of your game score. A party streamer won't result in 400% for example
---
True
---
its good imo, maybe swap out spies from the shadows with bitter murmur
---
Yeah, I actually played a few games since then. I'm blessed with not-so-long waiting times, it seems.
---
Pig is the new Freddy. 
---
There must always be one Killer that gets unnecessarily nerfed by BHVR and memed about by the community.
---
Pretty much sadly. I think maybe Frank's mixtape or a fast cooldown build can get him to work well but otherwise he's really going to struggle against survivors confident enough to not heal
---
anYonE cAN bE GoOD wITh sPIRit. No just no.

---
r/Oinkers is defensive of Amanda
---
Legion in my experience has been really fun to play as.
---
Demo is also fun and is actually pretty good.
---
Ghostface could debatably be the best but he'll likely get his stalk nerfed in the future.
---
&gt; I'm not a mind reader
---
Yet all your """""arguments""""" would make me assume otherwise.
---
&gt;You either believe that getting rid of SWF would make players leave or you don't, but now you magically don't believe either.
---
Because it's not relevant since I never said they should get rid of SWF. Why is this so hard for you to grasp?
---
&gt;Saying things like "you have no proof", "you are acting like Chicken Little," etc. these are all arguments.
---
No. No they're not. Asking for you to provide evidence to back up the claims YOU made or mocking your insanely exaggerated claims are not arguments.
---
&gt;I mean just the fact that you think people quitting the game if they got rid of SWF is a far-fetched idea
---
Where did I say no one would quit if they got rid of SWF? I keep asking you to point out exactly where I made these claims you attribute to me and you keep dodging. Starting to lean towards the liar angle instead.
---
Brilliant
---
I still haven’t played against clown yet ):
---
Yep
---
Im just trying to make sense of why ppl act more “toxic” during bp events theres more that both sides do besides what i stated i just didnt wanna ramble lol. Im not gonna argue abt insta heals or tunneling and stuff like that affecting the game as a whole bc in the end it doesnt matter and theres already tons of discussion around it. As for not participating i get why u dont but idk why ur suprised ppl are taking advantage of a event it’s happened almost every event lol (again not saying to deal with it or that its cool and ok to be “toxic” during a bp event im js it happens almost everytime so its not really a shocker anymore lol!!)
---
Thats just the survivor. The killer player is standing up right in-front of the screen when the game starts.
---
Now this makes me think the entity is an adorable omnipotent being that just nom nom noms on useless perks.

My bad. I didn’t clarify in the original post. I meant to ask if it was additive or multiplicative stacking. I’ll edit that.
---
sigh Another biased killed so wrapped up in their hate if playing against swf's that they are incapable of displaying even the tiniest shred of objectivity to say they suck I hate them, but I understand why the playerbase needs them.  This is the equivalent of fire is hot man.  You should be able to understand if you know this game and the current state of queues how impactful losing swf as a playerbase would be.  
---
You are really grasping at straws with your attempt at a reversed killer point.  I'm having a difficult time drawing a reasonable line between this tangeant and removing swf from the game and the impact it would have.  This feels like a desperate comparison.  Either way it's a false equivalency.  And noone is asking for nerfs to those killers here.  Random and unrelated my friend.

Happy b day

Reminds me of that one scene in the Amazing Spider Man 2 where gwen fucking dies

I know the Pig is a murderer but posts like these always make me think she's adorable.
---
Her base power with no add-ons doesn't take a lot to master, and extra blinks simply make her power less efficient and are pretty superfluous.
---
We also shouldnt lose offerings if someone dc's while the match is still loading.

That's some bullshit.

How do you like the Friday the 13th game? Is it as fun as Dead by Daylight? I've thought about grabbing it but I don't want to waste money.
---
Thank you!
---
You played the game and tried to win. *thAt's SuUuu taHk-sik, rhee-poRted.*
---
I'm sorry, but literally your very first comment was an argument. 
---
"You do know that the game existed before SWF was implemented right?" 
---
That is an argument for the stance that getting rid of SWF wouldn't kill the game. Not a relevant one, but it is an argument. The fact that you are trying to pretend that you don't have a stance and aren't trying to prove your point is just telling me that you're either fucking with me or really, really ignorant. 
---
Yet simultaneously, you're ironically calling me a liar by lying that I said things that I didn't. I didn't say that you said people wouldn't quit. I said that people would. You said that was far-fetched, among other pretty basic obvious things like it would take away profits from Behaviour, worst case scenario would be massive profit losses, etc. All pretty reasonable things to assume when doing something that would cause people to leave your game. But you think they're far-fetched, that's fine. I just need more reasonable arguments as to why those are far-fetched, and not that "I'm a liar" over and over again. 
---
I'm using logical thought pathways, that may or may not be right, but in my head they seem valid. If you don't actually usse some logic yourself and argue with me. Don't just call me a liar. That's not an argument without proof.
---
Hey, I think that Freddy is pretty strong to pick-up after his rework and you can mind-game easily with him. 
---
For the portals, I found it to be best to not place the portals in plane sight (right next to a gen) as they will see you coming. Instead, try to place it in thick grass or around corners so it’s easier for you to catch them off guard. 
---
Hope some of this is useful to you, have a good night!
---
I've literally wanted to punch my screen after the fourth or fifth match in a row where people DCed (there's always one, I swear). Shit, one time two of them just left *without being hooked or hit*, and me and some poor Ace were left going up against a brutal huntress who had no mercy for our abandoned souls. At least it was quick.
---
Wait you can get that as a skin?
---
Reported for turning your PC on. How far you do such a thing lol
---
Legion with NOED is not a good idea, his power overrides the one shot and alerts the survivors that NOED is active.
---
If by easy you mean simple and not many tied mechanics, probably trapper and wraith. One sets traps that can shut down hard loops and the other lets you go invisible so its easier for you to find and sneak up on survivors.
---
I havn't played much demogorgon so I cant really tell you anything.
---
Ghostface might be good too because he has stealth and is arguably stronger than Wraith because of insta downs.
---
Thats funny, I feel irrationally irritated.  Im glad not everyone hates Legion though, keeps the game variety up
---
Good survivors can still die to a bad killer, especially if you’re trying to cover for bad survivors.
---
Interesting. I've seen trapper, and he seems fun, so I might have to try him next. Thank you so much! Have a good night.
---
I fail to see the humor in this.
---
mmm best thigh in dbd
---
I would play Freddy, but sadly he isn’t on the Switch Version. People are saying it’s because of licensing issues. Thank you so much for the reply though! Have a great night!
---
***sees legion in A tier***
---
awwwwww :3
---
If killers can have moris then I’m allowed to use a key 
---
Fair is fair
---
Free necklace
---
Agreed.  Bitter murmur and BBQ is a little heavy on the information perks, even before you add iron maiden.  BBQ is sufficient on its own.
---
You know Franklin's work with Medkits/Toolboxes too, right?
---
Look behind you when you run, this gives you time to react when said killer wants to mind-game you and catch you out on a mistake. 
---
Also, try to get into chases frequently so you can learn how to improve by experience, not sure if this will help you but it’s how I improved. 
---
There’s obviously helpful information and guides on YouTube, too.
---
Welcome to the community!
---
If only you patted him well and good you would’ve have been camped!
---
Add on steam and send the message, ive had it happen to me a few times and you can get loads of bps
---
First daily of the event. Mori a survivor. I'm sorry, little one.
---
It used the item interface but people were able to bug it to work freely as items.  Survivors could also use killer powers, but none worked properly.
---
Id disagree with many but I can see why you put them there, but I honestly cant see why Trapper is in S tier. Whats your extended opinion on that?
---
He got mad because he doesn't respect pallets. Nothing more.
---
You know that wasnt the point of the post right?
---
This is the type of \_\_\_\_ I wanna do
---
Other great option is Billy, when you master how to curve the chainsaw runs, you’ll easily get a lot of downed survivors.
---
Not sure what the Nintendo version entails as I play on pc, but I’m sure you’ll find a killer you enjoy!
---
Oh FINALLY a good tier list!!!
---
Thank you so much! I've seen Billy in the menu’s, and he looks pretty fun. Thank you so much for the reply!
---
but if it was
---
What is the Boomer climb? xD
---
Not really. It happens very often. Not just spawning next to it, but out in the open in obvious spots. 
---
3rd Seal isn’t even a decent perk. Nobody uses it because it’s not gunna end the game for you. Same with Thrill. Hardly anybody uses it unless you’re running all hex perks, or are really salty about having bad Hex spawns previously.
---
I’m only rank 10 rn but so much same with the high rank match ups.
---
[https://youtu.be/LURHUeNQLWg](https://youtu.be/LURHUeNQLWg)
---
Right lmao? 
---
shit people who never play spirit say
---
this guy was doing self care in the corner and I was saying how dumb brain for doing the same thing a while back.
---
Don’t they have to have your permission to get in?
---
Lol red ranks buddy try again.  You sound like such a salty noob hating on killers over Franklin's.  Seriously thank you for this.  This was the funniest and dumbest shit I've read on this sub all day and that is really saying something because we get some gens on here.
---
Could you explain a few of these.  Assuming left to right means better in X tier, why is spirit above nurse, and hag/trapper above billy.
---
Ignoring that,  I'm curious why your pig,  legion and clown are so high and plague is so low. 
---
Regarding trapper as well, I am actually inclined to believe he is actually among the strongest killers when played at his best since the plague released (corrupt intervention) it's just interesting to see someone put him up above myers, billy and huntress
---
 I've played nearly 500 hours and I didn't know what it meant until now.
---
Then they would all most likely be lust and wrath
---
For me,i seperate them into two lists.most annoying, and most difficult.
---
Annoying:
---
1) doc - for obvious reasons. I mean, i like that he's not your standard m1 killer, and his effects are interesting.....but gd is he annoying to play against.
---
2) Hag - fuck hag and her dumbass traps all over the map, popping up and yanking my camera around. 
---
3) Legion - i can't put my finger on it, but legions are always just annoying to play against.
---
Difficult:
---
1) Nurse - good nurses are just straight up bullshit.
---
2) Spirit - what's the point, just let me go ahead and hook myself.
---
3) Huntress - seems like i end up against huntress a dozen times a day. Most of them seem to be really good at landing those hatchets. Extra asshole points if you bring the bullshit iridescent head and extra hatchets add ons.
---
I'd say S is stretching it,  but I can understand the idea that he is a High tier killer.  He doesn't give up nearly as much early game as he used to thanks to corrupt intervention forcing survivors to have to deal with his interruptions if they're to do generators while he sets up traps. 
---
After that he can snowball stupid hard with exposed effects and powers to help him down and injure multiple people.  
---
He also has 1 of the strongest end games where survivors get forced to take extra time to actually access the gate as well as alert him that they're coming. While you may not always catch survivors in traps too but the extra care taken due to the fear they create and survivors avoiding hard loops cause it's guaranteed to be trapped make his power quite good. 
---
But in saying that an insane amount of knowledge is required to play him well
---
Cringe
---
I... I didn't I needed this...
---
I REALLY needed this...
---
Thank you for making everyone's day better...
---
Every step you take you also grumble about milennials and how they’re ruining this great nation
---
No no as a survivor main I like that idea as well
---
How do you crouch on bubba? Also lol gold!!
---
Dead ass bro was trying to show my people how to play instead of the trail cause they only show you basics but since I’m level 8 they wanted to give them level 9 and 10 killers Lmfaoo they didn’t even stand a chance SMH
---
Bro they slightly wiggled therefore their hitbox goes to mars
---
Can’t be a cunt when endgame started and I’m real desperate
---
don't lie, you were scared
---
Usually a result of camping/tunneling. People are tired of the shit. 
---
If you weren't then I have no idea why,  seeing how they put on offerings and all.
---
It will come with severs right now as it is it’s impossible to know who dcs or crashes cause of an in game bug so it’s not fair to punish the innocent
---
Idea credit: u/Xerden
---
Damn now we got mixers
---
&gt; Usually a result of camping/tunneling
---
HA! Good one
---
Bar has been wonky since double BP hit for me.
---
Straight FACTS
---
someone explain to me why the strategy of camp'n'tunnel finds it revival in every single blood point event again and again
---
This explains the general intelligence of Blendettes
---
BBQ Billy &amp; Huntress would like to say hello
---
how dare you
---
It’s a glitch you just gotta move em alittle bit to get em back to normal
---
Fun sounding idea but that’s a perfect idea to make killers dc
---
I dodge in real life when a hatchet is thrown dont know why I just do
---
Yup, this has been an issue for me all day. You also get screwed out of WGLF bonus and escape points.
---
Only solution seems to be being the first or second person sacrificed. Or 3rd if you can die fast enough. The killer going to match results seems to disconnect them from the survivors, which seems to be what causes this problem.
---
I get real sick of people discouraging new players from playing certain killers. I like this tier list.
---
The killer playing the game isn’t toxic. Just because you want to farm and they don’t doesn’t make them toxic.
---
You act like that's not plausible. 
---
I play killer AND survivior but main more to survivior. I have had people randomly DC on the me playing both, it does happen. But usually with a rapid DC it's when a killer face camps 1 member of a swf or random team and they all DC. Denying points like the killer is doing.

---
I'm a killer who doesn't "farm" or any of that shit. Reason being is by the second day of the Bloodhunt I am bored and have no desire to play anymore. DBD isn't nearly as fun to me if I don't **earn** my points.
---
Pat the nut
---
Please let me join, I love and respect the pig.
---
The sad part is that I actually really enjoy playing as “Killer C” and the only reason I’m not is the insane queue times on PS4. ):
---
5 vs. omega blink nurse, buy your tickets now
---
To a lesser extent plague would too, 
---
The amount of times I’ve been found cause a plague randomly sprayed through corn
---
Yeah i agree with op thats just a dicker move than being toxic in an swf group
---
I do NOT expect to farm, but that don't have to try so hard to slaughter everyone in 2 seconds.
---
can i have some
---
I have been summoned.
---
So many ppl playing surv during the BH killer Q's are horrible, i've been getting 10-15 minute pre lobby wait times, then taking 2-3 more to fill and start all day. This means the algorithm is adjusting to get survivors in quicker and reduce delay where it can.
---
I have moried once. On xbox. First ever ebony. 
---
Felt so bad about it
---
Nah as long as it's understood that left to right has no value that's all good.  
---
May I ask what advantage you think legion has over plague then since I feel they suffer the exact same problem (with plague at least getting around it with a red apple):
---
I was told i got looped for five min the other day, I checked my stream afterwards and it was about \~35 seconds.
---
people overestimate how long they loop for.
---
It's true fuck the meta
---
With a possible Stephen King DLC I really hope we get Jack Torrance instead of Pennywise (who is far more likely)
---
What rank are you?
---
I'm not biased at all I'm calling it like I see it based on how you've handled yourself and what you've said in every comment.  You absolutely reak of bias man. 
---
You didn't say that?  Are you serious bro?  You literally laughed at people for saying just that?  I'm not doing your homework for you.  Scroll up high enough and you'll see the words you seemingly forgot you said.
---
I'm a survivor main and this is my first Bloodhunt!! First game, we had a super nice Ghostface who just wanted to farm - I'd repair the generator a little, come off it, he'd damage it. I'd repair it some more. He'd chase me to a pallet, position himself and let me stun him. He hit me a couple of times and then let me get healed. There was one hook - a Meg who tried to cleanse the Hex: Ruin totem! It was super fun! He watched me open the gates, but I let him slug me one last time before I crawled out.
---
All my other games have been people who simply aren't interested in farming. :( No face-campers, luckily!
---
The most common reason I find people DC is cause they were found first.  
---
Survivors definitely don't require much provocation to disconnect
---
Maybe play good enough so you don’t get slaughtered in 5 seconds?
---
the reverse dick trap works by inserting a catheter-like metal straw into a man's urethra. the metal straw is split longways along the length of the straw, but as long as the trap is inactive, it is water-tight. the metal straw feeds into a cum repository capable of holding 8 pints of cum. once the cum repository reaches capacity, the lock on the trap disengages, allowing the victim to safely slide the metal straw out of his urethra and free himself of the trap.
---
this is of course assuming the victim satisfies the conditions of the game before time runs out. if, after the specified amount of minutes (set with an egg timer wired to the device's mechanisms), the cum repository is not fully filled, the metal straw is forced open along the above-mentioned split, tearing the dick open from the inside.
---
of course, our intrepid Dr. Vigo was able to easily escape the trap.
---
5. playing with friends 4 and 7.
---
At what time do you play the game? I find matches way faster after 5 pm than any time of the day
---
Can confirm. Shitty legion. Still get bloodpoints.
---
Those films have been consistently ignored though, first with H20, then Halloween (2018). Hell, 2018 even cut out the Laurie is Myers sister stuff. It keeps him much more of just a fucking crazy dude who likes stabbing babysitters.
---
My game has started to dc me when I die, then it says “No Internet Detected” but it’s still up... I’ve gone from rank 6 to rank 9
---
Glad you’re enjoying it!
---
Yeah, the closest thing there is, is mews’ fleshy corpse
---
It's good but looks NOTHING like Meg
---
Hell yeah
---
Not going to lie I wasn’t expecting this nor did I think of this, but this is amazing.
---
More info is better. More auto cues is more info.
---
Just ask Otzdarva.
---
lmfao ur name says it all
---
Upvote or this nurse will be in your dreams tonight
---
Does it outright say she doesn't feed them? I assumed they likely died from sickness due to infections, fear, suicide, etc.
---
This is all building up for the final chapter of the game in 2023. All the nerfs will mean nothing when she unleashes her new power... 30-50 feral hogs who swarm the map whenever someone touches a generator, all totems must be destroyed to remove the power, and anyone who is touched will be mori’d.
---
So what do you do when you find yourself going against survivors who don't bother healing and just rush down the objective, realistically feral is useless on an injured survivor and he just turns into a 115% with nothing but an M1
---
In no way shape or form did I say anything remotely resembling bias towards killer or survivor.  Again you're just throwing everything at the wall and hoping something will stick.  It's sad.
---
Deadly serious huh?  You must have the memory span of a goldfish.
---
"I always find these threats from SWF players that "if BHVR ever got rid of it or nerfed it in the slightest then the playerbase would collapse" to be hilariously pathetic."

“Excuse me what the FuCk”
---
Have you heard the theory?
---
The game is more competitive than relaxed. People want to win more than to have fun. When they do win, they talk shit. When they lose, they complain.
---
As unfortunate as it is, it’s really that simple. I just had a person on Xbox call me sweaty, trash, emo (I’m not, but because of my profile pic it seems that way), and call me a loser because of my days played (I leave my Xbox on a lot). All because I don’t like to farm. The game is very fun but the community seriously ruins this game.
---
Normal traps snaps *shut*, while a reverse trip snaps *open.* If you're familiar with reverse bear traps you'll understand what this implies.
---
¿Quieres?
---
Like I said
---
&gt;inb4 some other pathetic excuse as to why you won't link it.
---
God I want a backrooms esque map with no set layout
---
Killers don’t need to farm, bloodpoints are easy to come by for Killers. Might suck but if Killers want to play normally that’s their right.
---
Lol not really man.  Just laughing at an entitled clown.

would’ve been funnier if you missed it
---
I played many hours of trapper when I got into this game, good luck!
---
What if I didn't want to look at smooth doctor
---
That was when I ruled the land...
---
Idk what’s going but I have 12 ebony Moris on my demogorgon, I literally get one every single level and he’s not prestiged
---
Goes to show not every SWF is good and great killers can annihilate a 4man Navy Seals team
---
I liked pallet vacuum but only because it let you do reverse drops which looked cool as fuck, [example](https://youtu.be/CmTmyd4CPQ0?t=5). You can still randomly do them now but its almost frame perfect.
---
Playing "normally" is FINE. I don't expect to farm what so ever. But being tunneled off the first hook every single game is annoying. I'm getting decent bloodpoints, I'm rank 7 but my team mates are averaging 4 and 6000.
---
I use franks mixtape sometimes to get the extra kills on them with the deep wound but other than that I try to patrol gens as much as possible and it usually comes down to around 1-2 survivors by the time the exits are powered and I try to run back and forth between the exits for anyone to start progress (Bc most of the time exits are within 50 meters of each other lol) and then I kill them and try to find the last survivor before they find the hatch but if they find it that’s good for them lol
---
:)
---
Lol!  I never said you said it should be removed and I've specified that before.  Are you intentionally being disingenuous at this point?  You were arguing that if it were removed it wouldn't have destroyed the playerbase from all the players leaving the game.  We've all been telling you you were wrong about this and now suddenly at the end you started walking back on that comment.
---
*escape cake
---
Lolololol,  I'm rank 7. I play plenty good enough. But how can one help get fucking tunneled and insta killed as soon as they're unhooked? I'm averaging a decent amount, but people on my team are getting 4 to 6000 that's insane during a event.
---
If it's a full stack than that might explain it, the game seems to rarely match people with full stacks
---
Broken totems not dull totems
---
I can deal with tunneling most of the time,  if I can hit lithe I can give a good chase before going back down. But the instantly slap down and mori'd after being unhooked is annoying as fuck. I'm used to the tunnel as well,  my friend and I play a few hrs a night but the ebony moris non stop is not normal. That's just them being cunts. But i can be toxic as well,  and I'm guessing that's what they're asking for during this event lol. So it's whatever I guess.
---
what's wrong with how it is now?
---
Kinda reminds me of the crappy Five Nights at Freddy's songs where they talked about how the robots were just scared or some shit
---
Actually they retconned that so his father did all the fucked up stuff. Check the wiki i was surprised too.
---
Honestly about the same. Everybody decided to get Xtra Sweaty today on both sides and it's giving me a headache.

---
For badham, always try to run into the school building, its easy to break line of sight and the drop down hole helps you alot. Make sure to mind your scratch marks when you run into it if hes not directly on your trail. Also houses are always a great place for survivors and the killer shack it good aswell.
---
As for legions I'm not too sure. I didnt play survivor very much before becoming a killer main and I only versed 1 legion in 3 months or so.
---
Wait... Why is it only frank? Is it cause hes the worse of them all? Thats probably why.
---
I love running it on legion. Map is usually littered with items after I frenzy
---
Refering to Kyle being the Night Hunter
---
Nope, you change them by changing the game files and you can't do that on console.
---
You’re my hero
---
No, I believe it was starvation. She would tie them up and never feed them and she grew frustrated because she couldn’t understand how starvation could kill them.
---
You do realize this was a joke right? I didn’t mean it seriously.
---
I just think it’s dumb to complain about survivors completing their objective. I think the problem is more on the time it takes to do gens rather than the survivors being toxic.
---
I think complaining about gen rushing, camping, or tunneling is stupid. Survivors and killers are just doing their objective

Starvation is mentioned in the in-game story. Apparently she'd just been tying their necks to the wall and letting them starve to death or succumb to illness, completely unable to figure out that they need the things she needs.
---
Yep. It's lame. And on double blood points! 🙃
---
🖤🥀
---
As long as hes good with said killers, he should be able to do good with any of them, leaving a killer in the state legion is in is unacceptable as with just a few minor buffs he could be about mid tier. Its like the devs want him to be complete dogshit and the only reason i play him is cause they're fun.
---
Everyone should be able to play a killer and do good with them, albeit you will always have your best and your worst killers, it shouldn't feel like such a massive viability difference between the best and the worst.
---
Dang dude, you laid some pipe
---
Does anyone notice the finger? No? Just me?
---
Of course now is the time for everything to go buggy. Sounds are fucked, sensitivity is fucked and now the servers are fucked. *clap* *clap* good job BHVR as always
---
it was working fine before the last hotfix. the devs literally killed the game with the last update

4 my opinion he isnt that bad i like him
---
Theyre trying their best
---
I only use it because I like to make flashlighting cunts drop their precious thingy
---
Would demo be in s?
---
B
---
Eh, fair point
---
I honestly have to disagree. A system like that would be either an absolute torturous 3 generator strat or still not worth using. We also already have something very similar to that, Mint Rag Hag, who can teleport to any of her 10 traps instead of having only 2 traps that are much more obvious.
---
Billy, get the chainsaw
---
I dunno, feels pretty nice to make people waste their streamers when they want to be complete assholes

is it out?

They are all additive, two 100% increases will just triple your bp earned rather than quadruple it
---
10 minutes for a killer with terrible WiFi

What does the killer gain by not (face)camping at endgame? I understand its frustrating but what should they do?
---
if u complain about that then you are a filthy survivor main and u would never understand the pain of playing killer.

I’m sorry you’re having a bad time buddy. I hope all of your future games all the killers and survivors act accordingly to not hurt your feelings.

What do you learn from playing against spirit? you didnt specify the "mindgames" you have to use to counter her. Tell me how you are supposed to counter a killer that can hear you, run into you, see your scratch marks, somtimes blood, ect.
---
When you play Bubba and don't face camp end game because it's a shitty thing to do.
---
Maybe make the killer mori’s first person, like the legion for example
---
Man people still complain about ds in 2019
---
Definetly trapper, wraith and huntress. Their mories are so boring compared to the last killers
---
Honestly I think this just feeds them. In my experience toxic swf groups want to make killers dc. It’s a badge of honor for them.
---
It’s cool. I do understand some killers have better kits but I do genuinely believe it’s who’s behind the controller that really matters. Most people put Trapper in a very low tier but if you watch Otz on YT you can see how well he can be played even at higher ranks and from my own experience in red ranks there are some really great players who don’t use meta killers.

What's with the glasses?

Oh. Do you know how long it will be out?

Feelings aren't hurt at all,  I'm annoyed lol. Well was when I posted this. Which people are ALLOWED to be annoyed,  and allowed to rant or it wouldn't be a option. Hate when people act like "Oh something didn't go your way, poor wittle survivior." That's not the case at all. Just ranting about what I see personally happening during events. If you think it's all fair and fine, cool. But I don't and I'm going to say how I feel with no fucks giving about your down votes or judging.

I wish I was on my phone so I could spam you with emojis for the joke so just pretend I emoji'd a bunch at you please thanks

Games that are really popular bring a large pool of players, some of them are just mean people. Sorry you have to deal with them so early. Personally I got called the hard R my very first game on PC, just because I 4ked some derankers looking to bully new players. Hope you pull through because this game is amazing

What is the Bloodhunt
---
I dont get it.

my thinking was that it would only get halved/removed on a second blink, or maybe halved at a 2nd blink and removed at 3rd-5th blink
---
Thanks

Except doctor shockter, he gets all the bloodpoints

Happened to some survivors I farmed with earlier today. I saw the counter going down and was smacking the exit like "GUYS GET OUT NOW BEFORE YOU DIE!" but they just sat there healing until they were spiked.  
---
After the match  they all said the timer said they had more time left.
---
Killer main spotted. I play both sides, any kind of camping is absolute cancer.
---
Rule 34 time!
---
Yeah, but imagine going against something like tier 1 meyers or ghostface with it.
---
Maybe they were trying to farm and you were try harding?
---
Spoken like someone who hasn't been red rank survivor in ages. I think we are done here. Remember this convo for when you change you're mind &lt;3
---
what the fuck else are you supposed to do at tier three, sit there and let them farm
---
Some of us just want to play and don't feel like catering to those of you who want to farm. And you call him sweaty just for playing the game. Kind of lame of you.
---
Looks like she got tied of you stilling around doing nothing to take hatch instead of saving her or doing a gen.
---
I love this
---
Bye
---
Lol you’re probably a killer who thinks the game is actually fun
---
now thats a hot take
---
Lol. You're trying to find a game as killer? Not possible right now. It is double bloodpoints weekend and everyone plays killer during this, thus making queue times literally dozens of minutes long
---
She was running circles in front of the locker. Theirs a special place in hell for people like that.
---
So you practically say "gg ez" and get mad when someone says "reported" and is probably joking
---
If you believe this then idk what to tell you
---
True that
---
Im new to dead by daylight so sorry but i have to ask what SWF means?
---
Report people that help the killer. No way she didn't mean to do that... I've seen that kind of shit multiple times.
---
&gt;Spoken like someone who hasn't been red rank survivor in ages
---
I'm literally red ranked both survivor and killer as we speak. Try again buddy.
---
I find prestiging killers more important even tho I play survivor more so it's all going to demogorgon for now. If I manage to P3 him, Freddy next
---
Nighthunters Ribcage claws are so cool
---
I got one today and was just wondering, does double bloodpoints carry over to daily’s or no?
---
Nurse is objectively the best killer in the game
---
I dont.
---
It possible to get it even if it at level 50 but presitge is a good idea for cosmetic if case you don't have it
---
Hey there! I'll assume you're in the low ranks like me, so in the unfortunate match that you are with a Legion we should assume that the killer is also running basic perks. Among the Legion's 3 perks, he's most likely to bring [discordance](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Discordance) because it's the most beneficial perk to his [feral frenzy](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/F._J._S._J.#Power:_Feral_Frenzy) where he can down multiple survivors at once. Knowing this, my personal play style would be to
---
1. Do solo generators as far as possible from the other survivors, possibly have them do the same thing
---
2. Be aware if Legion is using his power, in which case try to get away from his Terror Radius asap
---
3. Break line of sight immediately and use pallets sparingly if he's using his powers, although at this point expect to get stabbed.
---
As for Badham, you'll get a better feel for the map if you try playing as killer and get that place. If you watch streamers play killer or survivor in that map, you'll see most of the chases happening indoors and the safest loop being the white fence window vault near the school. I once played demogorgon here, and I realized that breaking line of sight indoors and juking the killer is where most of your plays as survivor will happen.

I'm in this picture and I don't like it

Demo Dad's Signature Oatmeal™
---
Yeah some people think theyre quirky for intentionally bringing mories during events lol. Nothing you can do other than move on, they just want reactions.
---
please don't generalize us, My personal rule is if there are 2 dc's I let the survivors farm, I don't even farm myself. 1 dc I play normal though. however one thing I would say is that if you ever get into a farming sesh with killers, try to cleanse every totem you can. You'll know real quick what they are planning if they try to get you off their totems.
---
Game would probably not run any worse tbh
---
Come on people, this game is about more than just BP!
---
Winning by camping is no different than a runner winning a race by tripping his opponent. Technically you won, but, did you really win? 
---
You're only cheating yourself!
---
You dont have to prestige, you can get it as is just keep going through bloodwebs. The only thing prestiging does it give you a bloody cosmetic piece.
---
Urban invading?
---
#NOBODY EXPECTS THE URBAN INQUSITION
---
Camping is a legitimate strategy tho in endgame. Because some survivors are too alturistic and then you end up with more kills as you played smart over leaving the person you had hooked to get someone who or probably just trying to lead you away so everyone can get out. Also the analogy you said to a racer tripping his opponent he didn't win because judges would most likely disqualify him from winning

I like this

With the new rank system a lot of people are hardcore deranking to go bully new killers or play easier games for the event

Both

Most streamers use twitch and place T.TV or Twitch.tv/Username. Mixer is another streaming site which people appear to start using
---
Adam's don't even give a shit anymore, they just throw rocks
---
Yeah no, demo is gone in like a month or so. It's just that you cant play a different killer without literally getting bullied like its not about the kills, its about the fun and getting followed around by an OoO isnt really that fun when playing ghostface, just saying.
---
Ya people thinking they're clever trying to bait reactions even though it's been done forever now lol
---
Every demogorgon I played tonight tunneled and hook camped me. And I’m in red ranks. I don’t get it
---
I think the BT bug is just like that because it would do the same for Freddy (as it now makes you obvious in the dream world) so overlapping code is what is proving it to activate BT but not count it fully as the terror radius
---
I just tested out otzdarvas basement build but didnt get to do it in the first place, im sorry ):
---
Oh, my bad didn't see the edit
---
u can leave the match now if u see a secret offering. its a small price to pay but at least u will not have to deal with this sh@t :-)
---
can’t wait
---
It does if all 5 gens are done ;)
---
survive with friends/survivor party
---
Try getting some chases in if you think you can handle yourself, it’d definitely help the team and pressure the killer more than a 3v1. You might not escape every time but it’ll give you and everyone else more of a chance at pipping than just doing gens. If that doesn’t really become an option do what you usually do and wait at an exit gate. Open it until right before the first light comes on, I think it should be the E in Exit and then it turns on. By then you’ve powered the exit a quarter of the way and if you play it smart you have more of a chance at escaping. I recommend learning to loop and getting chased more often. I usually help my team out by getting myself into long 3-5 minute chases sometimes and being very active around the whole map, gets me closer to double pipping most games
---
Aside from spirit and nurse(which I’m sure we can agree are no fun to go against like 99% of the time), clown, even if I escape the games are pretty boring. He’s just genuinely not fun to play against imo
---
Removed salty after game chat
---
and when I play killer and try to farm blood points people just genrush the shit out of me then get out, what the fuck?
---
do they even know there’s a bloodpoint event going on?
---
My friend keeps disconnecting during the lobby it's really damn annoying
---
What? Every Clown i played against so far was a fucking asshole who just straight up camped or tunneld everyone
---
Removed for salty after game chat

Video for reference
---
https://youtu.be/zFytjbD9b0s
---
That would be pretty cool but maybe we could have Aiden when DL2 comes out? He just seems cooler than Crane, not to be greedy but both would be pretty cool.
---
If you’re a team player then you wouldn’t condone someone giving up a teammate no matter what. Chances are this Nancy did it before and it seems like she was going for her but just didn’t want to risk getting caught out in the open then when she noticed she was picked up she probably hid in the locker in case of BBQ. If Nancy had been hooked she could’ve gone for the save (if it wasn’t her last hook). But Nancy got her caught and probably ran off to find the hatch for herself, all around just a dick move.

This offering lets you play the pig for one match, your perks or add-ons won't be used
---
But I have pig tho
---
I legit just saw a streamer on Twitch who was a Bubba facecamper, He was typin in endgame chat when I joined the stream explaining to the survivors that he always camps like he had done in game that just ended.
---
I left after he hadn't said anything for 8 minutes while just furiously typing to the survs.

Which =\= you autistic lil bugger you!

What about Hillibilly?

I think it's putting both feet on 1 stair before moving up

Here, eat freddy kruger's flesh
---
I mean... is there anything wrong with D tier when the killer doesn't camp or tunnel? Even during the bloodhunt don't survivors like to earn their bloodpoints? I know I like to (yet out of the 2 games I've played today I got tunneled twice because bloodhunt) (I don't main killer or survivor btw)
---
“jUst DoNT geT caUGHt, dUh!”
---
Prefer? Sure. Does it really make a difference? No. Nurse is OP on any platform.
---
Why is matchmaking this freaking bad? I'm not even talking about the various ranks in a lobby. I'm talking about how the party system has so far been utter crap.
---
At least once every two games someone in my party has to hard reset their game just to be able to connect to a host. At this rate, I would rather have to be invited back to each party if it meant I could connect to a killer.
---
KEKW is the new POGGERS, change my mind
---
I think it's supposed to be that after you open it up for the first time it tries to bunch up at the bottom because it's been shifted, and the box bulges out.
---
I would too if I outplayed survivors this badly
---
This is a good format haha Fits really well for suggestions too, "Spirit needs a nerf" - Literally a line of people going down
---
Look up some youtube videos on looping. You want the lower walls so that you can see where they are. Play around the pallets dont just drop them and run. Unless its a small loop always wait for them to break the pallet and then run it gives you time to get to the next tile.
---
Very few people are playing regardless. The devs have broken matchmaking even worse now.
---
I've played 2 survivor games in almost 2 hours
---
If your teachable gets consumed by the entity, then the next time you level up your bloodweb it should reappear. Example: Bloodweb 35 -&gt; 36 (PERK REAPPEARS) -&gt; you are happy
---
This just happened to me. A leatherface burned a 3 year anniversary cake offering and just facecamped everyone on their first hook. What an absolute waste
---
stabbing people is okay but THIS. PUSHING DOWN STAIRS? NOT OK!  THIS IS WHERE WE DRAW THE LINE!!
---
Talks about bringing Ebony Moris to fuck w/ people but then questions why they keep getting killers with Moris. Obvious troll is obvious.
---
If a killer tunnels or facecamps I wouldn't consider them a strong killer. Always go into a locker when someone gets hooked if you're not within 40m. Also when I get frustrated as survivor I play as killer for a bit.
---
You’re a sweetie, wish I was lower in rank so I can spin in circles with you. &lt;3
---
Ok but have you considered...just waking up before unhooking?
---
Did u get hit? No? So it works!
---
Glad I could change your ways and show you the truth. Good day
---
You're playing in isolation then. Look up guides, read posts..
---
I’m not salty, I’m just pointing out your inconsistencies lmaoooooo
---
Im a rank 4 survivor who has had this game for almost a year and I am just now getting all perks tier 3 on my first character. So if I can help others out I happily do so even though I dont really enjoy playing killer
---
Sounds like I should main Legion...
---
It’s just that easy isn’t it?  Considering the wake up is usually across the map or you’re getting chased and want to save a friend before he dies?
---
I don't even question it. You know it's a SWF. We've all gotten our asses kicked against SWF.
---
Can u explain? It’s not a fucking Eva reference is it?
---
Rotten fields doesn’t have any infinites
---
Nothing but tryhard nurses on PC at the high ranks :((((
---
Hey I’m answering as I’m reading
---
I’ve been playing for about a month and a half, so you still may count me as new considering I’ve also been crossing platforms, actually just call me new because I came to PC about a week and a half ago, I’ve been a bit inactive, but as of now I’m rank 15, so far it’s only gotten worse actually, but you’re right, I usually end up highest rank in my group actually so it’s not surprising 
---
And on the hatch spawning, I didn’t know that’s when the EGC happens, wow, isn’t that kind of a dick move from the killers? I mean technically not but technically yes
---
On the last game I waited for the heartbeat to disappear so that the killer would go to the other door (they looked around the door I was at for about 10 secs) but I may have been too quick, honestly I was just hoping they would be nice to me considering I did ALL the work of my group with the killer on my heels, I mean that’s a bit impressive right? Either way I’m naive.
---
I do have spine chill on all platforms, but on PC it’s just the first level, I’m level 27 Dwight but level 2 of spine chill hasn’t appeared in my bloodweb quite yet, I think we can all agree that spine chill is a must though, and I have dark sense level 2 as well, but usually it’s too late when I notice spine chill is active 
---
Honestly it’s surprising I’ve made it this far-
---
I’d be down with multiple Moris for each killer and it just randomly chooses one.
---
But for now I think trapper needs his changed. Maybe he sets up a bear trap under the survivors head and they raise their head to get away from it, but he puts his boot on their head and slowly lowers them into it as they push back against him.
---
Pig also needs something better, it’s too boring. Could chuck an rbt on the survivor and then she somehow cheats and speeds it up 
---
And also wraith but I don’t have any idea what to do for him
---
Somehow that uuu whacha said song sounded in my head.
---
To wear clothes.
---
Hag fking camps me even if she has traps. like wtf
---
If you’re being chased, someone else should be going for the rescue, that’s survivor 101 right there. And if you’re just going to a clock to wake up, there’s more than enough time to get there, wake up, and go unhook, unless you’re squandering that time doing other things, which is on you
---
Cries in Bubba
---
Lmfao gold!
---
Remember, it's not _just_ Freddy. It's the 'Gorgon too, and they're planning on adding Oblivious-related perks in the future, so _every_ Killer can benefit from the BT-related changes.
---
Also 39.99$ xD
---
Curse of the entity.
---
Yeah but it's a good perk for getting survival points which is hard to get otherwise (I refuse to use self-care).
---
Dwight's mains bizzare adventures
---
&lt;to be continued
---
Serves you right &gt;: 3
---
Yea cause survivors are super toxic
---
They're off touching each other in the corner of the map.
---
This hotfix broke more than it fixed, the game is a half step from unplayable.
---
*laughs in sneeky breeki*
---
Freddy puts you to sleep when he hits you. If were assuming theyre camping what is going to stop him from hitting me before I unhook...
---
Some things to focus on. 
---
If you are not being chased, make sure you are on a generator. Even if the killer has ruin, work on gens. Dont run around like a monkey searching for ruin because that wastes a crap load of time. If you happen to find it, cleanse it but otherwise, just work on gens and practice hitting those great skill checks. 
---
Look up a video on how to loop common tiles. Common tiles being L wall T wall loops, killer shack, jungle gyms. There are good and bad ways to loop these tiles and it's fairly hard to explain how using text so it's best to check out a video. 
---
Use pallets only when you have to. I cant stress this one enough. If you aren't injured, in some cases, especially if the pallet is a very safe pallet, a lot of times you are better off just taking the hit and running to another loop. The more safe pallets on the map for end game the easier it'll be to survive. 
---
Try and focus on getting optimal perks as soon as possible. Perks such as dead hard, borrowed time, adrenaline, decisive strike, and iron will should be an early focus. 
---
Lastly, while self care may seem like a great perk, it is in fact quite bad. Healing yourself with self care takes an enormous amount of time. Either bring iron will and stay injured until another survivor can heal you, or bring a med kit and heal that way. 
---
I hope this helps. If you want me to try and explain the proper way to loop tiles I'll try my best. If you have any questions feel free to ask.
---
Maybe, I definitely haven't played every single killer for long enough to make a tier list. Still, I tend to think I'm behind the survivors skill-wise if I get dunked on as any killer, not that the killer is bad.
---
i’ve haven’t came across any other killer other than the four in over 3 weeks
---
i mean doesn’t from time to time
---
thank you sansdeltarune
---
puppy
---
If you can’t avoid getting hit before the unhook, you probably shouldn’t be going for that unhook anyways. Typical play when a killer face camps is to rush gens. If you hook dive a face camper, even one vulnerable to BT, best case scenario you trade places with the guy on the hook, worst case scenario you both get trashed and you just involuntarily doubles the amount of pressure the killer has (This is all assuming the killer isn’t brain dead of course). Gotta know when to let a teammate go for the sake of the win
---
No problem dan
---
exit lobby IMMEDIATELY after the game ends
---
Yeah she's a spitter
---
Lol chill out, they nerfed an unintended bug holy moly.
---
Yeah I had just prestiged so my perks were cheeks lol.
---
Yep this happens every game on ps4 if you leave last or die last. You miss out on bloodpoints from survival and you also often lose the item if you escape with one
---
You’re asking a lot out of a console that’s the size of my foot.
---
Sorry, wanted to make whoever watched feel what I felt in that moment. Even without the sound effect my heart dropped seriously.
---
I keep em in my pocket
---
What if its endgame. I know its probably best to leave people to die but cmon dude, thats not fun for anyone. Im just saying if hooks are going to be traded atleast have the perk work in all situations.
---
I feel like I’ve only gotten it with an offering
---
You do lose offerings
---
I’d swap iron will for adrenaline tbh
---
Yep, I had to start playing her just to get over the fear. My survivor matches used to start with chanting "Not the Huntress, not the Huntress, not the Huntress, for the love of-"
---
I love that movie haha. 
---
A+
---
Don’t worry. You’ll get coldwind farm 5 times in a row
---
Such a bad movie, such a good meme... damn
---
fuck off.
---
You don't tho
---
Every game I've had tonight was sweaty killers and bad teammates at high ranks. I get that you don't have to farm but I would love to not get ebony moris when I use my streamers especially bc my teammates love to hook farm my sorry ass. I just wanna get hella points and prestige my characters yo
---
Have you thought about bond instead of better together? It might be more useful overall, but I haven’t really tried out Nancy’s perks.
---
i mean it IS a horror game, after all

No one didn't even got a skill check then😳😂

If I didn't I'd have abou 15 bloody party streamers, but I only have four
---
Perhaps the game is glitched for me?
---
So an example here, if I don’t buy a level 30 teachable perk all the way up to level 35, at that level, will the 2 perk options be the 2 available teachable perks?
---
You mean ruin? Lol
---
Idk maybe it's just map offerings cause i had a player leave and i didn't lose my hawkins offering.
---
ah a man culture
---
Alright, thanks for the help!
---
But where's the fun in that?
---
Might be something like that since I never use map offerings so I wouldn't realize it
---
I see. Thank you for all of your help!
---
All non-licensed characters at least.
---
Laurie and Quentin are canonically only  17.
---
Because they want to?
---
sadly Im no longer a kid :(
---
Also, what makes you think Im "butthurt"?
---
Iron Will can help you pull off some real risky saves. I think Better Together can be swapped out here.
---
Why not
---
I do not see any problem here
---
But the perk provides literally no other benefit, I just want it to do its job without situational instances nullifying it.
---
a perfect boy
---
They fixed it but iirc a patch or two ago it came back
---
When it came out there was increased chance of getting the map, now it’s normal chance out of the tons of maps there are
---
Good huntresses are super scary, made me feel like she was so good I became a huntress main. I still get smacked but its definitely fun as heck sniping people from time to time.
---
The Pig now has no weapon and must kill survivors with RBTs. We felt this fits better with the SAW lore.
---
A mummy character would be interesting and having both Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weisz as survivors would be neat.
---
Well it’s Netflix fault I was looking at horror movies and they show me this, as comedy yeah it’s fine tho.
---
Not a bad idea. Only have IW On because of all the spirits I’ve faced today
---
Game ends more quickly = less double bp + sadface
---
Bond would definitely be the better alternative but Better Together is the poor mans version of it IMO
---
Snares and pallets would be bull shit. I play Freddy and being able to place snares without a slow down is insane. But both snares and pallets and having control over every single loop.
---
The corn fields are potentially one big, sprawling infinite.
---
Think you a word in there, chief.
---
Thanks man. It’s pretty late here and had dream like 15 minutes ago after playing some late night DbD, this was the horrendous result lol.
---
He doesn’t need buffs, he can place snares with no slow down and already has control of loops, doesn’t need pallets and snares.
---
I think it’s ok for powerful perks to have conditions, especially a condition as simple as “must be within terror radius”
---
Hag can't be in top 3, because she's easily sabotaged. I'm a Hag main myself and while I know she's strong, she's not stronger than Billy and Spirit, as those can always do their job. Hag depends on players not fully knowing how to deal with her.
---
I really think Pig isn't as bad as people call her. Her ambush has many more uses than people think and with her recent "bugfix" that made her crouch and uncrouch speed change smoother she feels good to play. She also uncrouches quickly enough to get some gen-grabs and her traps really slow the game down, and also make people run around the map, making them likely to bump into you
---
I stopped bringing offerings during the event because it's all just camping, tunneling, and moris. I'll get more bp during a regular non-event match, so I'll bring the offerings then.
---
I am a Freddy main I think he is in a good place and doesn’t need a buff. There’s other killers that would benefit way more from some help.
---
Reading comprehension sweetheart
---
Plague, you either permanently one shot survivors or you become huntress with an uzi
---
usually I say play what you want but expect with some killers that it is gonna be harder
---
For going for the same survivor that was hooked 60 seconds ago? You can just wait that time and go check some gens, or get make your choice next time
---
especially bc the new SWF system
---
I mean, he willed it - but ya boi Trapper was the one that DID it.
---
Why post that here? Need some attention?
---
Now it's just an asshole move to end it so quickly
---
The fact that you ranked Huntress 5th worst killer makes me sad. It’s your opinion though so it’s fine.
---
Why did they think that would work lmao
---
If you’re in a 3 man swf if one of you is chasing that’s an easy 2 gens done between your friends. How are you saying that the killers build is terrible when they are destroying you???
---
Before she hit the ground she disappeared like: 👩🏿✌🏿
---
I only ever done that once and I stood there I surprise and I was put back on
---
Yeah the pigs Mori sucks. I never feel bad getting moried by her because it’s such a lackluster one

*pleb
---
Actually if the survivors lose connection to the host the dont get anything. zero!!! happened to me quite often last night
---
In the past, a bug occurred where killers would get a fusion, a tposing nurse with Jake's head and chainsaw for example, having the chainrun ability, without heartbeat, nor any kind of sound
---
He's strong, but he does need changes.
---
Namely, his add-ons. They're an embarrassment to game designers everywhere.
---
There are quite literally **two lines** that are good.
---
* Ropes/Chains
---
* Pictures
---
Aside from that, there are a couple one-offs that are good.
---
* Class Photo isn't to my liking, but it isn't terrible.
---
* Pill Bottle is OK. It's a massive downgrade from the old version, but it's not outright awful.
---
* Both Ultra rares are mediocre and forgettable, but they aren't  exactly bad.
---
**Everything else is doghsit**
---
* The Dresses are somehow even worse than they used to be.
---
* I get annoyed when I even think about what they did to the Block add-ons.
---
* Dream Pallets are a fucking **JOKE**. Oh boy, if the Block add-ons annoy me, the Pallet Add-ons make me fucking livid. They looked at every possible choice they could have made with these things and chose wrong for *every single one*.
---
 * Pallets shouldn't be mutually exclusive with snares.  The pallets simply aren't very strong on their own. They aren't versatile in the slightest, they can't even be used in many locations (if you're running Pallet Freddy on Hawkins, you just leave the match), and they're beyond simple to deal with.
---
 * Even if they're mutually exclusive with snares, they definitely shouldn't be an add-on. Freddy already has two add-on lines that are complete garbage before you even take into *consideration* wasting add-on spaces on Dream Pallets.
---
 * Even if you bind dream pallets to add-ons, they **100%, no way in hell** should take up an **entire goddamn add-on line**. It's one thing to say "ha ha, here's a common that replaces your godly snares with meme-tastic pallets". I don't like that, but I can accept it. Wasting **three** add-on slots on a line of useless add-ons is just a terrible way to go.
---
 * Even if you dedicated an entire add-on line to this god-awful effect, there's no way these devs would be dumb enough to dedicate one of old Freddy's *best add-on lines* to this dumpster fire? Wouldn't they at least be wise enough to dedicate this dogshit item line to something that was already dogshit? Fuckin' NOPE.
---
Add-ons aside for a moment, including moving dream pallets off add-ons... the other changes are either plainly necessary or just make sense.
---
* Pallet vault speed being unaffected makes no sense, considering window vaults **are** affected and it's *the same damn action*.
---
* More Dream Pallet spots in Hawkins. This is non-negotiable. You load in on that map using Dream Pallets and, instead of just having a weaker power than normal, *you simply don't have a power* since there are almost no spots to place the damn things. It's ridiculous.

Episode?
---
not everybody cares about points
---
Bloodhunt rules are pretty simple;
---
1 - No mori/instaheal allowed
---
2 - No op addons or op killers are allowed (crack billy, gen grabber spirit, omega blink nurse...)
---
3 - No tunnel and camp allowed(i personally neither farm nor kill people as a killer main during bloodhunt, i play normally and count which hook stage each survivor at and 2 hook them all then only down them and slug, not kill.
---
I guess that will do the explainment
---
Delicious, finaly some good fucking food
---
me when i try to controller 360 lmfao
---
| You don't lose offerings
---
I'm sure about addons, but not on the offering. I have to check my plays.tv
---
NO YOU DONT GET IT I HAVE 3 EBONYS ON BUBBA
---
fucking 3 ebonys just sitting pretty
---
U got in wrong. Survivor -friends builds 2 SC, and shit perks. They use to prolong chases. Now they die in a minute
---
I did, but with an ebony at the end :)
---
If I walk away to get gens, the downed survivor gets picked up and I can never know if the survivor has DS or not. You are suggesting me to leave each and ever survivor I down for 60 seconds, which is more than enough time for at least one other survivor to come around and pick them up. If I patrol the area instead, other survivors will just rush gens while another one waits for me to leave. If I eat the DS, I just lost momentum.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
DS is busted regardless of whatever numbers they attach to it.

---
Congratz, I hope you feel good about yourself.
---
Yes because wraith can do the same amount of pressure as the nurse, spirit and hillbilly
---
thats ur imagination...u cant really assume that their toolbox or medkit has those attachments on it...and i hardly doubt it that EVERY GAME U PLAYED THEY HAD IT...
---
nevertheless, survivors who ‘gen rush’ with bnp are dumb....the longer the game the more points they get...specially survivors when they barely get bp.
---
That's exactly what you do when somebody is hooked in the basement and it's Hag

---
Saving people from Hag is a fucking shitshow. I always make sure to *very slowly, very obviously* sneak up to the hook to pull them down, and instead of using their fucking brain the survivor becomes Usain fucking Bolt and takes off the instant they touch the ground, popping the trap and fucking both of us over.
---
No doubt the same survs that go "wah Hag OP please nerf"
---
There’s not much to do when the blood web doesn’t give you what you want :)
---
Yeah, she's mid dab!
---
I hope they eat popcorn and get a piece stuck in their molar for a week.
---
Good. Even though theyre all bad, surge is the least bad.
---
bout to hit da stanky leg
---
thats fucking terrifying lol.. wtf is with the Dwight head nurse Jesus pose killer
---
Here's a question:
---
Why do people save up offerings to use on the Bloodhunt when the double BP is not affected by them?
---
Blood hunt just gives you double your base end score (which can be improved by BBQ or WGLF), but the offerings like party streamers are then added after that and only mutliply the base end score. They give you the same bonus regardless of whether it's double BP or not.
---
Lol looks like we only play the game after the event ? We know what we are saying and the game lobbies and matchmaking after the update is trash !

it happened to me multiple times and on the top of the random dc i get zero progress and points

Its nice when idiots like those are trying to bully the killer and end up dead...
---
What is the Jotun was one of the killer oh my god hahaha
---
or turn off chat and let the the salt flow as you go afk to get a drink or go to the bathroom as survivor mains cry.
---
Demomogon is actually really cute when he doesn't scream.
---
Oh don't get me wrong, Whispers IS great, but at tier 1 it's absolutely useless.
---
used as a polite or respectful way of addressing a man, especially one in a position of authority
---
If we shoot at the killer, will he get injured?
---
He does the opposite of what he says( example: telling others to not be toxic but he is really toxic aswell when he plays survivor, doing rank shaming all the time), complains non-stop about the builds people donate to him saying they are shit builds, also complains non-stop about anything really. If you ever think he is wrong or have any sort of criticism towards him or his gameplay, he will see it as a threat and permaban you from his chat then proceeds to talk on how good he is and keep repeating that he is right but you are wrong..it's that kind of asshole so yea, his fanbase is just asslickers honestly

---
The timer is messed up really bad, every match I get to the gates I'll leave at a 1/3 time left cus I havent seen it reach 0 since before the update. I've seen quite a few people die that way trying to make it to the end of the timer for hatch or gates and die to the entity early
---
Mm mm mm them legs 💙
---
Bubba dropping frames every chainsaw isn't fun

Lol @ thinking a semi competent killer can't stop most teams
---
Yes
---
I've been playing a month now and I've only gone against her once. Definitely a rare encounter
---
Mid-rework Legion intensifies
---
I had two infinite tombstone Michaels back to back. 
---
Then my third game was a Michael with an ebony. 
---
4th game was Hag who camped and killed everyone on their first hook.
---
Then to top it all off, a demo saying “let’s farm bring bps” then kills and camps 3/4 on first hook. That’s not how farming works, I tell him. He says “shouldn’t have done gens then.” What? How am I supposed to get any points? 
---
Less then 10k every match for me and less than 22k for all those killers. Why guys.
---
Or killers want to use the double BP event to prestige and use their rare shit to not waste it.
---
Same argument as last time. Survivors wouldn't throw away keys and insta-heals either.
---
Yes because the OP totally said that. One killer being slightly outclassed does not mean another is dogshit. I rotate them all at rank 1 and I'm telling you from experience that every single killer in the game can be good if you're competent with them.
---
They should really penalize killers for camping like that. And not by "creating space" as that's the risk that these kind of assholes would take. 
---
Furthermore when all gens are done there isn't any space for the killer to waste anyways.
---
***KING CRIMSON!***
---
What rank I’m at? Currently I’m rank 15 because I’ve been lazing around this season, but most of the times my teammates have all been rank 19s and 20s, not a big difference though and on average the killer is either rank 20 or 15
---
Last game the killer was rank 17 or 20, can’t quite remember, I got around 5 chases, 4 gens all on my own, 2 or 3 saves, but it all went down really bad when the first teammate died
---
We already had one DC around midway through but one survivor had the reverse bear trap on and he didn’t even try to find the key to unlock it, I was with him half the time and he wasn’t looking, so he died 
---
Then there was a chase for my last teammate (one gen left) he got hooked, I rescued, he got hooked again, I rescued again, and then he got hooked and died
---
I was left alone and I sat near the exit gate when EGC happened, killer walks by and doesn’t notice me, I didn’t quite know what ECG meant when that happened so I made a mistake there because I opened the hatch only 10 seconds after the heartbeat stopped when they left for the other door, since they closed the hatch that probably means they didn’t want to be nice so

On wendsday, when I wa doing a daily ritual with Hillbilly (one of the killers im very bad with) i manage to get lucky and kill 3 survivors, but the last one (a biker Kate) disconnected like the coward slut she is.
---
new attack animation, "the back hand slap" and to ensure blood she will have a ring on.
---
Surely it's the other way around? I'd think that if there were too many survs, killer queues would be short cause there's more to go around.
---
Hitting a skillcheck is making a play now..also ds just a tunneling perk, literally can't pick you up lmao

Inner Strength, DS, Adrenaline, Borrowed Time. I just like it.

Legion is my second main after Pig (I apparently hate myself), and I've never had too much trouble with him. Regular 4ks all the way up to red ranks. So I agree, I don't think Legion is overly weak - you've just gotta remember to use his speed to keep pressure/deep wounds on.
---
**Buff. Our. Squeaking. Pig!** 
---
Stop nerfing her into the ground!
---
My dude I’m not putting words into your mouth. You seem to be getting very defensive. I understand what you’re saying but your missing the point of this post. Have a good night dude cause we aren’t going to come to any kind of agreement here! See ya in the fog if you’re a console player!
---
majority of those people are at least level 10s on their characters, but you’re right, I’m just experiencing the works of bad matchmaking on dbd
---
Same thing happened to me a few hours ago.
---
Thanks 👍🏻
---
\&gt;"I don’t want to play killers just to win."
---
\&gt;Posts 300 word rant about how sad it makes him when he doesn't win and the survivors are mean about it  
---
Look, the fact is that if you want to play a decent killer who can win games against decent survivors, you need to learn how to play Hillbilly, Nurse, Spirit or Hag. Others are viable with particular addon builds, but you should get good at someone like Hillbilly in order to farm points to finance your occasional trapper habit. You can't deliberately play in a half-assed, underpowered sort of way and then bitch about losing to people that take this competitive game more seriously than you. You're like a survivor that runs Kindred, OoO, Dark Sense and Deja Vu because they think it's OMG SO COOL to have all four of their perks look like eyes, and then bitches when they get dumped on by any reasonable killer player.
---
&gt;You seem to be getting very defensive
---
Because your arguing with me? lol uhhh.... ok then I guess the elevator doesnt go all the way up and you missed my point entirely. Have a good night
---
Yeah, had this a few times as both the killer and survivor. 
---
Pretty good job... So far!
---
All I’m trying to do is encourage people to stop that behaviour so playing is less unpleasant
---
Im not arguing with you at all? I forget you can’t tell emotion through text. Sorry you feel I’m arguing.
---
Stop seeing so high of yourself, you are apart of that matchmaking. If you stopped blaming others you’ll win. You don’t need a team to win in DBD. If you can outrun the killer you can easily escape
---
Just pick Billy or Leather Face, luck is on your side
---
Farming is on the killer mate. You are ruining the game.
---
I wonder how cause all I keep encountering are killers who don’t wanna farm,  just want a 4K bringing ebony mori’s
---
The "why are killer queues so long?" starter pack
---
Chances of getting rarer items/add-ons/perks is higher. Supposedly, anyways.
---
Why is this discussion, what do you want us to say???
---
How am I being emotional? You where the one who called me defensive for literally defending my point as if that makes me in the wrong. (Do you just want to say nothing?) The reason I said the elevator doesnt go all the way up is because you missed my point entirely. sorry
---
The usual tier lists seem to have doc, LF, and piggy at the bottom, and everything above that is just personal opinion excluding the obvious nurse being numero uno
---
Every killer has a loving community for the most part
---
He did this build already, I think it's just someone using it
---
It wasn't exhaustion back then!  they were cool down perks if I remember correctly. So you can stack sprint burst adrenaline and balanced landing.
---
damn, when your so clueless that you BM as hard as possible without even knowing :D
---
Funny story
---
It’s a de-sync in timers
---
demodog fren boi
---
What if you dropped it on hit regardless of Franklin's? So there could be more of a competition among survivors instead of being a race at who finds it first.
---
Just spat my coffee out
---
I got mori’d 3 times tonight. All I did was exist. I’ve given up on solo queue
---
cause not farming is unfair?
---
Yeah that was the point of shitpost/meme.
---
Wasn’t here to cause any “arguments”
---
its pretty Close to a meme tho :D
---
I don’t mean it is, I mean if we all die because of two people who DC that’s one half of the teams fault 
---
I mean it is somewhat the head trap guys fault that it went down because he didn’t care about his own survival but it’s my fault that I didn’t wait longer for the exit gate when everyone died
---
What even is the concept of winning at this game anyways?
---
Okay I'll switch it
---
most People want to play and not farm I guess
---
From what I understand the dailies are given to you for what you least play to give you more incentive to try something you normally dont play. Like I get a lot of trapper/wraith dailies but I never play them... i also get a lot of survivor ones for characters i haven't played.
---
I always use all my high to mid lvl BP offerings before I prestiege as well as all my pink/purp/green items/addons (when possible). Its a grind but I still gain BP regardless so still a win
---
I do wonder where in this post I said not farming is unfair.
---
The people that want a challenge and don't expect 4k each game still play other killers. The entitled little brats still complain and justify that e.g. nurse with 5 blinks is balanced and a counter to an X (insert literally anything).
---
ooof.
---
Did you have a stroke?
---
Freddy is already super annoying as shit to face cause fake pallets feel super cheesy to go down to, people are dc’ing from Freddy cause he is not fun to face, not cause he is strong. If these changes went through (at least snares and pallets both being base) no one would fight him lol
---
This literally happened to me like 10 minutes ago
---
Luckily they were too altruistic
---
felt like you implied that with "everyone getting a good amount of points" and "playing fair" like playing different is unfair
---
No it’s your fault for activating the trap. You said you’re the only one doing gens and you did a gen whilst he had a trap on, so it’s your fault he died. Winning is popping
---
There should be an option to pet the killer. I'll give you hatch in return for three pets.

No I wasn’t doing gens when he died, I was following him around, but his timer went out, in my defense it was my second time facing a pig at that point so I don’t know if there’s anything I could have done to help him other than try to protect him while he goes to those key places

No, I didn’t. Everyone gets a good amount of points if the killer just doesn’t use moris, doesn’t camp, or hard tunnel. If you classify those as playing “different”, then yes, it’s unfair.

I put a whole bunch of points into Ghostface during the anniversary event and he's currently sitting at 30-something untouched Moris but I can't bring myself to prestige him before using them all
---
&gt;&amp; can you not be a dick 
---
Now look who's emotional? Dont be a baby please
---
I love me some Legion.
---
Look gamer, it may be hard to do, but just “gg” and move on, getting stuck up on toxic players will only make you not like the game. Saves your emotions for the nice people, don’t waste your time on the toxic ones. Play your way, one side has to win and one side has to lose, that’s all there is to the game.
---
I get that its not "fun" to be morid, tunneled etc. but its not unfair, as in "against the rules"
---
Lmao didn’t you already say sorry for that? &lt;3 I love you. See you around Atomic Ass Pugg
---
I prestige without looking cos I know this will happen .-.
---
I hate that. The killer was so thirsty for a 4k he let the other one go near bleed out. The other one felt entitled and instead of just going for gens and even when the killer comes to keep working on them she decided to fuck over the other guy, not cool. 
---
I wish everyone doing that kind of crap like the survivor calling out his teammate did is going to get banned.
---
Her toe is sticking out and I can't unsee it
---
That’s annoying bc the main reason I don’t play killer is the queue times. I have ADD and can’t bare waiting 10+ minutes to get a single game. 
---
Also the dailies I get are mori dailies for lvl 1 killers. It would cost more BP to get a mori than what I’d get from it 
---
Thanks for the response though
---
There is only demo not human being, what are you talking about?
---
Only thing they should remove/fix is the fact that she can crouch camp behind you while doing a box then downing you mid way so you die bc of it. The timer should stop then...
---
Is it just me or that cat *e l o n g a t e d*
---
Someone had to do it eventually.
---
The killer has to hit consecutive skill checks for two minutes for the trap duration and if a single one is missed the trap comes off
---
Plus a bloody variation of the character's default outfit.
---
Wtf!
---
#1 you wasted time following him around. #2 Doing a gen activates the traps timer
---
wish PS4 had a chat in the game...
---
Being mori’d, tunnelled etc. just because a killer feels like it (assuming the survivor wasn’t toxic at all) is definitely unfair. It’s just obviously isn’t unfair, as in “against the rules”.
---
Your an emotional baby. I actually I take it back after talking to you I honestly believe the elevator doesnt go all the way up. I have never met a person so hard headed as you. Kinda creepy IntothePenis
---
Unacceptable? What is this a school report on behaviour?
---
I'm not talking about fun factor/playstyle, I'm talking how any time I use the chainsaw it drops ~15 frames for half a second and I struggle to reorient
---
Funny since I barely touch survivor and also rarely get survivor dailies.
---
Look! You can joke around! Me = baby &amp; my Daddy is Freddy.
---
Is there room for me in the box? Definitely just did this yesterday and felt extra smart afterwards

#RAW
---
F for Friendzoned
---
Had a Dwight of all people do this. I hid in a locker cause Myers was around, he chased Myers into the room I was in and fucking pointed at the locker. 
---
Myers grabbed me, dropped me, chased the Dwight, brought him back to me, and fucking mori'd the guy in front of me. Then he dropped me in the hatch. It was equal parts amazing and terrifying, but bless that Myers.
---
Congratz champ!
---
Farming is boring. I would rather play normally. 
---
I don't bring Mori, but I won't be running around farming with survivors.
---
Ab shit. Here we go again.
---
It's the pain of being a low rank
---
Wholesome &lt;3
---
My friend and I save up all of our cakes to play during times like these. We both use our cakes and hope to have a great time and allow everyone to earn lots of blood points but 3 matches in and we are getting hooked and camped immediately. When we manage to open the exit gates, the killer disconnects before anyone can leave so we lose our cakes and nobody wins :(
---
I'm not rly a immersed gamer but hiding and waiting for the heart beat to go away just is going to make u waste time hiding when you are usually pretty safe
---
I didn’t notice the killer putting it on him, like I said I spent most of my time doing gens trying to give us a chance to get out of there, I was about halfway through a gen when I notice his timer start ticking and then about 30 secs later he walks past me and wanders around and I stop the gens but he does everything BUT remove the ticking trap so eventually I go back to my gen, finish it, his timer is still okay but this happened hours ago and I haven’t slept in 24 hours so if that’s impossible it didn’t happen but if it’s possible it did
---
Anyways he didn’t get hooked or chased much but I followed him after the gen and he still didn’t try to find a key in those jigsaw boxes so I ended up just having to watch him die
---
If it’s not possible for him to be fine after I did the gen then the middle text is just my imagination
---
Ehh I mean if you consider max 30fps, mostly dangling around 25fps as “running pretty well”, I guess youll be fine. But for a game that doesnt even look that good I think its unacceptable that it doesnt run at a steady 60fps.
---
Yeah but I just wanted to get out fast and the killer didn’t want to play nice at all so I just ended up waiting for the heartbeat to go away and then an extra 10 seconds
---
That was a mistake though
---
Ye probably or cause he's the main one lol
---
This is super well edited 👍
---
I feel the tumors.
---
Had this happen also. Checked end game screen, no increased rate of stalk add ons either. Weird
---
MYC?
---
Would love to see trapper brutally beat someone's face in
---
These are the people who i then do my best to kill fast af if im killer
---
Nope just PC
---
If not the full perk, at least make part of it non hex. The 6% extra regression should stay even if the hex totem is cleansed. It might not be much, but better than nothing
---
You’re definitely right. RNG always gotta be like that.
---
On my other killers, I’ve got whispers level 3 but since I only use it on the spirit.. I’ll never get level3 haha
---
Think he was rolling a D20
---
I keep having the problem of not showing the tally of everyone readying which then leaves people behind, also sometimes not being able to join lobbies. Xb1 btw
---
clout.
---
Distressing Doc has deviousness maxed before the second gen pops
---
But you don’t know which one it is and you can’t see chat. Sounds like and is total bs

“Jeff that shit ain’t working. I’m grabbin PILLS”
---
I play xbox so luckily the msgs "save"
---
Erm you break ghost face or by looking at him in the centre of your screen, your character model can block this so being face to fave isn’t gonna help you.
---
Agreed love this headset
---
turtle beaches 420x+ stealth turtle beaches are overrated but they serve there wirless purpose and the surround sound is good enough to hear with direction hurt survivors are going especially as spirit so there pretty good I guess
---
My friend ran to the door in relief while the random healed right next to the exit gate...INSTANT DEATH. The scream ran in bagging so hard
---
I’m just fed up with people’s shit here and they need to be aware of their intolerable behavior.
---
B..But Adiris was a child
---
The Xbox version is annoying as hell recently. Getting thrown out of matches and lobbies while the game stutters and takes 10 seconds to load and switch between screens.
---
Fax
---
Enough of his body has to be exposed and it has to be with the center of your screen literally draw a line in the middle of ur screen there u go
---
Yeah well it can still be a gg if it was a fair fight which the survivors only just lost. If he wins by camping, tunneling or lag-switching, then I can see your point.
---
You might as well use them
---
*THE LION SLEEPS TONIGHT INTENSIFIES
---
I’ve encountered more toxic players than good sports both here and in-game. It’s sad.
---
This is so sad, alexa play despacito
---
Do you feel better now?
---
I swear it's mine, I forgot to flair so I screenshotted it instead of going back to the editor. Look everywhere man, you won't find it
---
Killer trying to fix her missing period so he doesn't have to pay child support
---
Good bot.
---
Yeah I had 2 games yesterday where the killer pretended to farm with survivors and then turned on us, both times had 3 people hooked at once and still managed to fuck up the 4K lmao. One was a Mike the other was a legion. Both got 1 kill. 
---
PSA: if you’re pretending to farm with survivors and then turn on them to try and get a 4K, just know that you are doing the biggest bitch move in dead by daylight.
---
Somewhat. It’s good to rant.
---
Pls-rework Legion intensifies
---
What? Rottenfields isn't that bad for Myers. No map is really that bad for Myers, except maybe the new map
---
I'm glad people told me Freddy sucked when I first started playing, he was the first DLC character I bought when I first got the game and I might have stopped playing if I thought playing killer was that frustrating. Since rework and dem skill gainz I love Freddy.
---
In Friday the 13th, the environment lets you kill. In Dead by Daylight, the environment blocks your view of the kill
---
Good I'm happy for you.
---
Wraith is definitely a double-stepper. Have you seen those legs?
---
Is it just me or does anyone else get reminded of those super blurrycams of WWII "caught in the battlefield" type photos every time Chainsaw Myers is posted?
---
Kill your friends?
---
Immersed basically think of that survivor that hears the heart beat and sneaks away and hides in a bush or corner 
---
But keep learning man the Dead By Daylight discord has a teaching room where someone teaches you how to play you can try that idk how good it is but worth a shot. 
---
GLHF man don't give up yet just try to take a loss as a time to learn what you did wrong but also remember some game you're just not gonna win. 
---
When I wanted to get better at survivor I recorded myself quite often and then watched the bad games back and actually found myself doing some no nos mainly being overly greedy
---
Honestly the dbd community is waaaay less toxic than csgo, cod or league. Facecamping is mean, but in the end it is an allowed technique for the killer, same goes for looping. People flaming in chat wont ever stop, cause if people lose, they get angry at themselves. They just let it out in chat.
---
Pointing at Pig removes the trap and puts ot on Pig's head
---
you mean 95%. Remember the "When you heal David you die" glitch?
---
Pffftttt HAHAHAHAHA
---
Literally looks like plague
---
I’ve played CoD since the Black Ops 1 days and I can say with honesty that I’ve encountered more toxicity here and in the game. The only game I can say I’ve encountered more in, would be GTA Online. But that’s a game where tryhards and griefers can really maximize on those terms.
---
Can't rly relate over 400 hours of dbd I stopped taking the seriously stopped caring what people said you can only hate it if you care and you seem to care a lot of people saying shit.. listen I know this community isn't all saints but for the past months it's been rly stale chat is just a GG and that's it lol
---
I'm a console player
---
“Survivors hold the game hostage” they can’t 😂😂😂
---
Can we talk about how many add-ons are useless?
---
i let them go
---
And this is why I bring NOED and have zero shame.  
---
Also because I'm a loser.
---
Just don't get caught 4head jk
---
Thinking about trying this one, have you had any issues with it?
---
Hag, gotta have that Ruin. Dwight on Survivor side, Prove Thyself is great for extra BP.
---
Ever since I started playing killer, I've honestly come to kinda hate Claudettes. Always Teabagging n shit. I see more toxic Clauds than Neas
---
Have you played LoL? You would be flayed alive.
---
It’s not all toxicity channeled via chat, it’s also in-game actions such as fellow survivors dropping pallets on others, sabotaging the game, killers hitting you on the hook to taunt you, teabagging in front of you, etc.
---
Lol I’ve lost a few streamers so far. It’s never been this bad probably with the influx of players!
---
I've noticed the end game timer bug on a few games. Just made me and one other survivor lose an easy win. I've also noticed that quite frequently I'll get disconnected from killer JUST after the game ends. It doesn't mess up my outcome, but it means I can't see the killers perks or how much they scored. It pretty annoying just how many bugs have come out with this update, but I guess that's dbd for you.
---
Well that’s good, despite not having escaped for 23 rounds doing all the gens etc is paying off really well when it comes to everything so I’ll probably be rank 10 by tomorrow and then maybe things will balance a bit again
---
Just because I see it as a more casual game compared to the others I play, doesn’t mean I *want* others to purposefully fuck with me or try to ruin the game.
---
You mean Evangelion?
---
I can't promise much but you'll get better that's for sure
---
Leatherface.
---
I disagree because personally...I can't go three games without a ghostface showing up. I'm sick of that son of a gun
---
I'd say probably Legion-
---
That’s good enough for me, in the meanwhile I’ll just get all my characters to level 30 so I can teach perks
---
&gt; hopefully
---
“””””When you just loaded in the killer and ruin him””””””

Now time for 3 upvotes or 900 down votes. The risky plays

Angrypug?
---
Doctor, too this day I haven’t had a bad game with him
---
No one uses him properly.
---
Ok.
---
Fair but compared to ur other points the amounts I've seen survivors act like dicks to each other has maybe been 1-5 times I'm a killer usually when I see ppl fucking over other survivors on purpose I punish the other person there has been many games where I just let the person go that had no chance but tbaggin and flashlight clicking along with trying to get the killers attention isn't toxic it's throwing. Just stop caring about most of these things and move on like you said no?

That’s actually pretty great, as of now I’m level 30 Dwight but he doesn’t have the most interesting perks so that’s one thing to add to my dbd education list
---
GL man
---
If you're awake and go unhook someone BT will proc. It's only when you're asleep and there's no terror radius that it doesn't. He is also now countered by OoO, which is... annoying, but oh well.
---
I think it should be 4 pets cuz I’m a good boy
---
well fuck now i look stupid
---
KING CRIMSON NO NORYOKU
---
No no, you get hatch, I get the pets.
---
Enormous difference is that you know that’s he’s in the area, but not if he’s actually going where you think he might go.
---
You can see Ghostface heading to the shack and tell your friends, only for him to appear at the ironworks by the window stalking your teammates. 
---
But with a mimic you can literally just say “D1ckCh33ze is that you by the shack?”
---
“No that’s not me, I’m by an exit”
---
“Ok he’s disguised as a P3 Dwight holding a medkit”
---
Now everyone knows who to look out for, it makes it impossible to use the power efficiently and you end up becoming a shit Wraith
---
*sigh* Fiiine you can have the pets
---
So cute and wholesome, I love it!
---
:3
---
I dont know if its intented but it is a good change, so people can not derank as easy as it used to be.
---
And now it got nerfed. thx devs
---
There's no slug if someone is on a locker. You grab them and get da or leave them.
---
WAZZAAAAAAA you made me drop my croissant D:
---
It can suck. Me and my friends spent an actual hour just trying to have a custom match
---
bloodhunt is on?
---
Yes it is
---
*WAIT WHAT?!*
---
That shit happened to me
---
As a Killer main who hasn't played in a while and is practically forced to play Survivor due to longer queue times and being rank 17 on Killer.
---
You're a bitch if you try-hard during a blood hunt.
---
Well it still has a large playerbase so that’s highly unlikely. Also it’s actually good sooooo
---
I feel like Bubba would try but fall on his head and break his neck
---
He just needs yet another rework. Something about the original terror and chaos, but also the manageable balance we have now.
---
It's too fragile, too easy to lose frenzy.
---
Maybe decrease the ludicrous speed, and extend time?
---
Friday did too
---
Nice, if only u had tombstone
---
It’s crazy that a video game makes people this way.
---
Brokenface because he's so bad he's broken?
---
Ohhh shieeeet how long?
---
For 3 days from now on
---
That’s why I play killer with Ruin. Game lasts longer for more points and I don’t gotta mori anyone
---
pallet into barn is kinda a big loop though
---
I play killer and survivor equally but I use Astro a40 and they have really clean sound.
---
Isn’t rotten fields the map with no large structures?
---
Chank you, gonna get my grind on
---
What happened to being the bigger person? Lol
---
IT'S FREE HITS
---
Doc passively generates insanity on survivors that are within his terror radius. So small map = closer to survivors = more insanity. Doc struggles in maps like Coldwind with wide open spaces where you wont be that close to survivors as often. 
---
Billy's power becomes nearly useless in tight, enclosed spaces, which is all that Lery's is. His chainsaw gives him amazing mobility, but you turn very slowly, making it impossible to traverse maps like Lery's using his chainsaw. A map like that effectively turns him into only a mouse 1 killer. 
---
Lery's is a great map for Doctor, but horrible for Billy. Coldwind is a great map for Billy, but horrible for Doctor. Was just my luck that I got them switched one after the other
---
I get soo many killer dailies and I'm a survivor main. I wish you could filter dailies to your preference, or even better, have 3 separate killer and survivor dailies.
---
I play survivor and killer a lot. I'd say if you're good it happens a lot. I manage it a lot on survivor and for killer it's ranks 1-2 that do it best.
---
I love how we all get downvoted by survivor mains LMAO
---
If you're starting to get frustrated you're probably gonna be playing worse. It happens to me sometimes too, it's best to just take a break and come back another day.
---
I completely agree with you
---
Nurse YELLS like crazy when she teleports? And unless you are deaf (In which case terror radius wont help you at all) then you hear she is close and about to teleport. Thats a first thing, and a second, it would make killer detection perks a much more viable option for games.
---
I honestly did not think about it like this. I kept on facing killers with mori’s and it’s been pissing me off but now that you said that and it makes sense, I’m not that upset anymore
---
Just remove pig and make reverse bear traps an offering
---
Horro game? Yes? Arcade? I dont see it in the tags.
---
I mean if you go vs bad survivors, sure. No good survivor is scared of a killer. If you're 2 survivors on a gen, the killer can only follow one.
---
If he was smart he would have picked up the other survivor
---
Bc the fact that she has a pretty high skill cap to be useful and because she is so slow and punished by exhaustion perks so easily
---
I played against a Billy last night as the odd man out with a 3 man SWF on my team. The 3 man SWF disconnected within the first ~2 minutes when it was obvious that the billy wasn’t going to farm even though they all 3 dropped BPS. When they all 3 DC’d billy and I farmed.
---
Why DC? Even if you aren’t farming, you’re still going to get a SHITLOAD of bloodpoints with 3 BPS during a blood hunt...
---
I always get this map when I play Fuckface
---
So i have to go without vision on my target, while survivors can look ahead and are faster trough looping because of smaller hitboxes? How is that fair?
---
He is quute fun to play
---
pretty good job so far
---
I facecamped and slashed people on the hook as Myers when I first got the game last year. Had no idea what I was doing. Got a ton of messages 😂
---
Meh it came out a month before DbD for consoles and playerbase wise the difference between the two is huge. DbD also has had far more in terms of additional content and also hasn’t been abandoned by the devs, isn’t totally broken so half the time your kills don’t register and isn’t a boring drawer searching simulator.
---
I don’t think DbD will EVER go the route of F13
---
Amazing how adam fits perfectly in this scene 'is there blood in my mouth?'
---
Outfits really. Heard a few streamers say it's better to just keep leveling up for better items
---
I think if it also had "increased regression per stack" then it would be better.
---
Alternatively, don't remove the regression penalty bonus when the totem dies. Skill checks are easier but the regression still exists.
---
Honestly I really don't like the character portraits. However the layout of the items and perks is really good. Also the progress bar should honestly stay in the centre, it's easier to look at while staying alert. Other then that I like it
---
Just reading all these, I feel so old and at the same time fortunate to have lived through these trying times.
---
Oh cool
---
agreed
---
What movie is this?
---
For real. In eastern USA (on ps4) I can find a survivor OR killer match in under 3 minutes at basically any part of the day. Prime time I can find killer matches in under 1 min and if it's really really slow it MIGHT take 5mins tops but that's at like 6:30am
---
I wonder why killer lobbies take too long
---
So I know its a glitch but is the timer still 2 mins for survivor or is this shortening the time?
---
I wish there wasn’t a timer like it used to be it was fun to goof off when gens we’re done and gates were open
---
It still has the little “ambush” text at the bottom of the screen while crouching, you just aren’t allowed to use it
---
I don't know, but I don't think I wouldn't enjoy the game if I started playing, I played some bottom tier killer and lost every single game wothout hooking anyone.
---
well damn, I met a fuck ton of bitches tonight.
---
She’s not stunned, she’s crying
---
lol and killer has you on his shoulder like “lol guess he really was a noob then”
---
Wait u can’t get it anymore!
---
No u
---
Literally in the title
---
True this lol just play with friends who have borrowed time. Badda bing badda boom
---
I cant read
---
Don’t see why it matters since you can’t derank past 15 unless I’m missing something
---
Spirit will completely dominate up until purple ranks where most people fall apart cause people start to develop a brain and people learn how to mindgame and Iron Will is a much more popular perk at higher ranks.
---
Legion - Chad... You can only pick one.
---
You dont have to moonwalk for more than 3 seconds and you should be able to predict where they are
---
"Ps4 and iPad lover" remember you from the F13 days. You are absolutely not an adult.
---
I’m giving you a warning
---
It takes the demo 1 second to FULLY charge shred. Which means your above numbers are wrong already. And the 3-2-0 patch notes, those numbers have nothing to do with the shred ability breaking pallets, that’s just the shred ability. So that’s inaccurate.
---
Demodogs. Give him nougat
---
Nah I needed this for a presentation and I had a friend help me in KYF. I'm a rank 6 usually.
---
There’s no way this is a joke. That skill check is not even that hard to hit. You are definitely the guy who runs around looking for ruin because he can’t hit greats while doing gens. Try hitting a ds skill check against a doctor in tier 3 madness with unnerving presence. Now that is a bit more of a challenge.
---
Absolutely nothing. It was tested. You'll get the same amount of items. The only benefit is tye bloody outfit which is pretty useless with all the new cosmetics.
---
&gt; SEE MY FLICKERING LIGHTS AND PEOPLE SLEEPING ON FLOORS. :(
---
Yes, sleeping, that's what they're doing.. Just.. peacefully sleeping there on the floor.
---
I can’t wait till you find out about unnerving presence.
---
You only know she's close, but not how close. You'd be suprised by how many gen grabs you can get as nurse if you run perks like tinkerer and dark devotion. For the second part, they'd have to buff detection perks which would yet again render our current stealth killers useless
---
They changed that a long time ago, you can not derank below 15 unless its rank reset.
---
We all used noed when we where baby killers but is about moving past it and getting better overall without it
---
Exactly this.. I can't even fathom people leveling a character to 50 and not using all their yellow+ BP offerings &amp; good items.
---
...Which is an absolute cakewalk compared to that shitty thing they call a "skill check"
---
I took the G̶o̶b̶l̶i̶n̶  Quentin face pic from [this post](https://reddit.app.link/JdZed8f3j0)
---
Correct on the part that the 1 second is needed to fully charge shred, I did misread that part (still takes 65% of that which is .65 seconds). But if it's that inaccurate, then please show me your source for the pallet stun taking less time. I timed it myself a few days ago and it was exactly the same but I did not want to cite that as a source since, without video evidence, it's not really something you would (or should) believe just like that
---
If it's one of your friends I'm sure he will understand, if it's you then ehhh
---
Who one?
---
Define acting like a bot
---
Unnerving presence applies to DS... So if you think it’s difficult now... lol
---
I cant hit good skill checks idk I woke up one morning spastacated and now I can't do ordinary skill checks anymore
---
Try nurse or billy
---
Yesterday I got a LF who wanted to farm, I started running in circles around this wall and he couldn't land an hit on me, then when he got me he facecamped me, me and my friends got scared and did gens while he tried to land one single hit on us
---
You know what's even more fun? Jumping over pallets from a hill as demogorgon
---
This happened to me with a pig perk and I played a game, ranked up Freddy instead, and when I came back to check on the pig I had been promoted a level and the perk was automatically unlocked.
---
For some reason I lost the 150k bloodpoints I got from a single match (i used a sp and there were 2bps) either due to not restarting my game or because i got reported for lag switching (i was installing d2) what do you guys reckon the reason was so I can avoid this happening again
---
You just started playing spirit just practice and you will get it
---
I really hope he gets a buff.  I understand why he got nerfed but he got nerfed way too much.
---
And now you see the benefit survivors have that the Killer has a First Person view.
---
The only ones I'm scared of are the stealth killers like pig, myers, ghostface, demogorgon and wraith, but only on maps where they can lose line of sight easily and sneak up on you
---
I’ve been mostly solo survivor cause matchmaking parties is an actual chore. Nancy got WGLF at level 45 so I can keep playing her to gunnel for Steve. 
---
I did get some killer games on to clean some dailies. Made me realize that Clown gets a lot of Deviousness points off those bottles.
---
You can look at anybody playing the demo on YouTube and time it yourself. I timed it on my phone which was inaccurate of course, but that showed it was faster. Have you played against it or with it? I have. It’s 100% faster than a normal pallet break and way faster than a chainsaw even mid rev. Plus with the added bonus of he can already hit through a pallet, it’s broken.
---
True but it’s the same for the shape. 
---
I feel like playing in a healthy way punishes you against those swf. Fortunately not all games end with “gg ez killer”
---
So it was ignoring players and only kicking gens, then it would chase for second, go back to patrolling gens, wasn’t breaking pallets, eating them, and it was swinging through thing it couldn’t have possibly hit you though (IE Barrels and dividers, general looping debris) 
---
Not to mention he wasn’t stalking at all, and yet he kept tiering up some how? Like, it was a tier one Michael, that was able to keep up chase with me...?
---
yeah sorry i meant to many killers, takes forever as a killer to get a game.
---
Why so trihard
---
Its a nintendo switch, its a tablet what do you expect
---
Well no because survivors could theoretically hold the game hostage forever at that point
---
I would rather do opposite, increase movement speed decrease the duration
---
Honostly it's not hard just don't think about it too much I mean unless a bird flys over the white part which has happened to me twice GODDAMN Birds  but I'm not great at doing skill checks atm ethier for some weired reson
---
I use to be a rank 1 shape back when it was way harder as killer and I can tell you it just takes practice and learning to loop. Playing spirit is easier than him as well so I’m sure you will get it when you at a pallet just stand there and see if the survivor makes a move or not it’s all a guessing game for them with her
---
I forgot to also mention a cut coin. This offering legitimately works against a killer since it takes away what survivors can waste their time on instead of doing gens.
---
With spirit you shouldnt have a problem killing multiple people even when playing fair. 
---
At high ranks you pretty much need to slug people when its the right moment, like when you down someone but you know for sure someone else is around you. Now you have 3 people not doing any gens (1 down, 1 getting chased, 1 needs to come to get the downed guy up). Survivors probably will complain about slugging, but its needed at high ranks when you dont play one of the top tier killers like Nurse or Spirit.
---
Eh, Legion right now is objectively bad. You can do very well with him but if you're up against competent survivors even the best legion mains will struggle to get kills because of the slow frenzy speed and such
---
True true. I do that, I love the mind games with spirit. Unfortunately it can be countered by a flashlight.
---
Thanks for your advice though, I guess I’ll just play and practice
---
tbh, its better if they can do like dead space with no UI. All the information entertwined within the game
---
Thats a new glitch?
---
AGAIN
---
#A G A I N !?

Lucky me I literally just did that using this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdf7Qs_NS7M at 8:33. By slowing it down to 0.25% speed I can be rather accurate with the timing and I got 9.05 seconds at that speed from start to finish of the animation. Divided by 4 that gives roughly 2.25 seconds.
---
Please show me the footage you're talking about because I genuinely cannot find any evidence that what you're saying is true
---
Yes, they just do it to be annoying
---
Amidst the shitty toxicity that is our community. I love seeing posts like this. Brings a tear to my eye
---
No I'm saying that because I literally just did that. BH weekend games have made me DC constantly and I've went from 15 to 17 in just under 2 hours by leaving.
---
Just before you do it turn a little so it’s harder for them to do it. I seen many do that. And ya np you got this
---
Hello and welcome to Dead By Daylight, get used to it.
---
Mmmm do you have video proof because I’ve been getting DC’s all night from buggy games at 15 and it won’t let me past and I’ve been depipping
---
I think ima do some testing today if I can get my friends to get on
---
Playing as survivor or killer?
---
Killer
---
In this case let's just agree to disagree. I don't think we're getting anywhere with this discussion
---
For those unaware, Freddy now applies Oblivious to Survivors who are asleep, meaning that if they unhook someone with BT, it won't work since they technically aren't in his terror radius anymore.
---
Welcome to the club 
---
No but for real me and my friends will sometimes be looking for no joke an hour to find a game and sometimes we just give up entirely.
---
The rule of thumb is if it does not say it does not stack then it stacks
---
Tbh I’d still say I enjoyed running around the map and hiding in random boxes with the boys was a blast 
---
Playing hid and go seek from the survivors and killer was definitely one of my favorite things
---
I mean... No harm has been done here apart from the queue time. The match was canceled because someone crashed mid loading. Why would you want to punish for that?
---
What rank
---
How do you play against someone using ruin? Cause if you arent hitting great skill checks every so often then you are screwed
---
That was definitely deserved, but it still needs to be fixed because that can happen to someone genuinely just trying to escape
---
16
---
Well I'm happy to be here
---
I play 7 or 8 killers anf I'll tell you, Myers, ghostface or wraith are my favorite must fun killers, I love stealth. Guess what, when you get to rank 5, say goodbye to your fun. Infinites, loops and lack of map pressure, you can't use your power and everything is out of your control. Forget about exposing with ghostface, forget about catching people by surprise with wraith, because good survivors will always have an escape route ready. Forget about stalking with Myers because no good survivor is going to let you stalk him, and when you do, 3-4 gens have popped.
---
You don't know.how much I wish this was true, but it isn't. I wish I could fun doing stuff in high ranks with my stealthy killers, but I can't, I'm forced to play billy/spirit (I don't enjoy nurse) if I want to have any fun in higher ranks, because it's just not fun to be unable to do pretty much anything.
---
That or just derank or smurf, and I don't feel like 5-10 minutes queue just to derank 1 pip.
---
It’s prob cause of that honestly. Since they made changes to the matchmaking now your getting more ppl at your level and that level is not the best for finding games
---
ppl could be disconnecting not because they want too but more bc the game crashes, their wifi crashes I know my shitty wifi adapter has a tendency to give up and it sucks whenever it happens
---
oh
---
😂😂
---
Brilliant guess I'm here to stay then haha
---
And when they do have dedicated servers I’d not be shocked if they still can’t detect if it was a closing app thing or a game thing
---
This is adorable. My only suggestion is that instead of rice cake thing, you could make it the blood point icon. Though, spirit is Asian anyways, so culture wise, it makes sense.
---
I challenge you to make the doctor or clown loom adorable like this!
---
Personally though, I want to see all the killers in this style, especially GF.
---
Mountains ftw
---
You don’t lose any offering or items when a player DC or crashes during loading screen.....
---
I'm not saying you are wrong but if we are gonna punish DCs it will just need to be as simple as if you disconnected while loading in or while in a game you get punished ofc if it crashes maybe it shouldn't be a punishment idk how much info BHVR can get once dedicated servers come
---
Wholesome
---
You missed the point, misread, or u can't comprehend.
---
Yeah might as well figure out how to do your fucking gens
---
It's even worse when I'm forced to jump in a locker and they take the bait.... Then I miss and look like an idiot.
---
I really enjoy this style. Lovely put together
---
Knowing bhvr they sometimes make changes and forget about broken stuff, like when they added the end game they forgot about left behind and the perk was completely useless until like   last month
---
Playing killer and getting useless cut coins are the worst. I'm Spirit, give me some prayer beads or dirty Uwabaki if you want to be expensive.
---
too obvious, not that good bait. if you actually put in some effort to make it more subtle, people think you might have a decent understanding of the game mechanics and baiting responses
---
My favorite is how Freddy breaks borrowed time because of that new status effect that really was not even needed for him since he already did that
---
I don’t use a headset. I stick to default sound since I refuse to get a mic because I usually break them.
---
^brother ^I ^see
---
#thighs
---
When he hits tier 3 it plays the Halloween music. 
---
There are add-ons and  perks to lower the terror radius. They don’t show the killer load out unless you stay till the end of the match. 
---
The thing from your other post where the killer swings at a gen or a broken pallet or something with no intent of hitting a survivor is trying to indicate to the survivor that he wants you to do that.
---
um.. Agitation is an underrated perk I wouldn't call it unpopular just ppl haven't rly understood the power of it Otzdrava made a great video about it
---
shadow born is nice on nurse ngl cuz when u blink u see much more and rly fun on billy bc it looks like ur going SUPER FAST 
---
Light born funny to use against happy flashlight users but making both those 2 perks doing the same thing eeeh but interesting
---
*Laughs in 18 ebony moris on my level 47 freddy freaker*
---
&gt;I'm not saying you are wrong but if we are gonna punish DCs it will just need to be as simple as if you disconnected while loading in or while in a game you get punished ofc if it crashes maybe it shouldn't be a punishment idk how much info BHVR can get once dedicated servers come
---
I disagree with this. I can sort of understand punishments for people DCing during a match which makes the game boring for everyone involved. When a match is canceled, nobody is penalized for that, you just re-queue again.
---
It's a really old bug
---
Wanted to upvote your comment, but it's at 69 so I shall not.
---
Literally the only nerf iri heads needs is to override any +hatchet add-ons so you always only have 1.
---
Either leave, find the totem or tick it, but usually I'll just leave
---
WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY OH FUCK WHYYYYYYYY DID I HAVE TO SEE THIS WTF
---
I just never use more than a green mori because A) I want points, and B) its kinda tosic.
---
What’s “noed”?
---
Thanks! I appreciate it. I've been trying to cultivate this relationship for like a year just to be turned down.
---
I'm just going to enjoy my favorite game and try to get some bloodpoints! See you in the fog.
---
How I felt prestiging Steve last night. So many red and purple items
---
Instantly finished generators. No skill checks. Just finished generator
---
Idiot ass Claudette. Maybe this bug should stay to warn players to actually escape ASAP.
---
Spirit is really good and doesnt require a huge learning curve. Also on console nurse is impossible to play.
---
Shadowborn isn’t popular?
---
Lmao, It's already annoying that I have to walk the damn baby survivors out of the gate everytime I play killer.
---
I dread to think what it would be like without a timer.
---
Like I said idk how much info BHVR gets when they have dedicated servers
---
No One Escapes Death
---
killer perk ”no one escapes death”
---
Gotta wake up and do careful saves if you want those altruism points.
---
That said if freddys gonna camp BT won't counter him which sucks
---
I have such terrible reactions so never aim for great, I always go for good and if I hit the great then it’s a pleasant surprise. However if there is ruin I just power through hitting goods because it’s still more efficient then looking for ruin with my luck
---
What’s it do?
---
I've always wanted to try Mad Grit on Plague
---
i know what you mean with loops, and i don't know shit on how to do that
---
silence, heathen.
---
Left 4 Pig
---
*Yes more nougat* and we need a dart skin for the demo Gorgon
---
Ill play normally as killer, but ill bring a cake every game :)
---
The wire makes your hex look like an IED. Hex: Fuck'em. Dull hex that explodes when cleansed cause the killer is sick of your shit. Brings surv to injured squeaky bitch state.
---
Also it deny's Ace his good items.
---
What exactly are we supposed to be looking at here?
---
The average survivor I play with
---
Ya you should be fine just remember after you get a good stop working on the gen until the sparks go away because during that time progress on the gen won’t be made anyway until it’s over and it will save you from getting like 4 in a row lol
---
Say that to the 3 offerings ive lost today
---
Dead Hard, Lithe, Balanced Landing, Adrenaline
---
Yes we are called unitards.. er..wait.. no... unicorns.
---
He will get banned once dedicated servers come out
---
Shadow born is popular af. On huntress and nurse. Not so much on killers that it’s pointless on.
---
I am aware thank you, one of the many things I’ve learned from this sub, still new with &lt;100 hours so I’m sure I’ll get better at hitting those greats in time
---
Music plays for Mike when you hit tier two, but not survivors.  The music plays for survivors when he hits tier 3 to indicate to them that they are all exposed. 
---
I have no idea what a DBD bot would play like, it sounds like he was just trying to farm.
---
I'd say perks that help keep generators up, for example: Ruin and discordance are very good. Discordance is also very good because if you teleport to the marked gen, 2 people won't work on it instead of 1.
---
Depends on your play style/favorite killer. If you want a solid killer that doesn’t break the game, go Freddy. Most killers have their own specific play style, so just try them out and see how you like them. Nowadays Freddy might be one of the best m1 killers on account of loops being a free hit for him with his dream snares.
---
I did that with nurse, 2nd game playing nurse. He notched in the afterlobby to no end
---
Idk why some killers have to be extra shitty when it’s double blood points tbh. 
---
I’m not saying farm, just like, don’t be a cunt?
---
You have 400 hours and you dc for ruins? I really don’t mean to be rude but.. do you play with your feet or something?
---
Oh ya you will and devs are always working on proving FPS so even if your on console they are trying to reach 60 will they ever hit it like they say they will I can’t say but it will be good lol
---
Yes it does. She made a post saying all killers are good. I said wraith will never have the same downing potential as spirit, nurse, and hillbilly. Keep playing dumb it's funny to watch
---
Me, because I always lag out on skill checks. :(
---
You’ll lose -2 if you try to mess with your WiFi as a survivor ( Nat type or whatever to try to keep your items ) my friend did it all the time but it doesn’t work anymore ( they tried it recently )  along with losing -2 pips and item with no BPS . It’s like the game knows ,
---
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
I had it too lol, tho it skipped like half a bar. Even while I didn't tbag it was deserved, I should have got tf away from the match
---
Anyone who doesn't climb up the stairs on all fours like a gremlin who caught the scent of moldy pizza rolls I no longer wish to know.
---
When I play spirit I use perks like Surveillance, normally after I down someone if my surveillance pops I’ll try get a gen grab or down the person on gen. gotta apply pressure.
---
4Gamers videos aren't exactly funny in the first place.
---
It better not &gt;.&gt;
---
They should instead have a threshold. Like for example once you get to rank 10 you cannot go lower, and same for 5.
---
Damn boi he ***T H I C C***
---
Now that's the real crime.
---
So why start a discussion if you’re going to shut down into a ball and deny everyone else’s view point if you already are so stubborn on your own.
---
This is a bug, not an intended feature and hate for toxic survivors seems a little old at this point but I get where you are coming from but those extra 10 seconds have saved my ass no end of times at endgame.
---
Won*
---
I really don't know
---
If you want DemoDaddy's meat you have to ask nicely
---
What was the video? Can't seem to watch it
---
I mean all killers are good with practice and etc she never once said some are not better than others so your statement honestly meant nothing. And ppl even pointed this out to you then for whatever reason you just decided to insult the OP. And I agree it was pretty funny watching you reply
---
U haven't even described your experience... u said I'm the problem. When I explained that I'm doing gens, and hanging without SC. What did I do wrong?
---
bots would be more helpful than some teammates.
---
"hAtE fOr ToXiC sUrViVoRs SeEmS a LiTtLe OlD" You're right, so instead we should thank them for their toxicity, and get on our knees to suck their dick. 
---
If you're toxic, you deserve every bit of inconvenience you get. Simple as that.
---
That's not really true the killer could... get this... kill them!
---
Hahah that made me laugh.
---
You’re right in every possible way. 
---
I just have this stupid urge to respond to whatever they say. That’s why I don’t change my privacy settings on my PS4, I love the drama.
---
Me and my friend were running from the killer after he saved me I got out and he ran though the exit and it didn’t let him go it trapped him outside the map
---
But you don’t have to prestige to get teachable
---
*Dies*
---
"Reveal +500 boldness points"
---
Yeah, she got her future revealed.
---
That boy is not correct 
---
He is flawed
---
Remember kids, if the timer doesn't move straight away your life span will have been cut by about 12 seconds
---
I've been playing long enough that I have everything I need, so I prestige licensed killers for their cosmetics. Like for Demogorgon I have him P2 with the chain head cosmetic. I use Pig's bloody weapon. P3 Michael. P3 Leatherface. P3 Freddy.
---
Personally I just like leveling up and unlocking things.
---
I think this should have the "Shitpost" flair more than anything.
---
I find DbD's HUD to be very good actually. It never distracts from the game or screams for attention and it provides the info it needs to.
---
I always run deliverance and 75% of the time get hooked first lol
---
Almost all of the killers are good but gens pop too fast with a motivated team.  
---
The self care nerf created the gen rush meta.  No need to waste the best years of your life healing when you can just knock a gen out...not to mention no self care means another perk slot for d-strike, balances landing, Dead hard, borrowed time, adrenaline, ect.
---
Huntress is on 110%, but, good advice
---
Hey man, laughing in horror movies is like the best thing. "So bad its good" should really be its own genre... But I guess that wouldnt sell that well.
---
After finishing the entire anime series I have a fondness for wild Jojo references.
---
Surely being able to party up shouldn't cause too much of an issue with it?
---
I can see how it'd fuck with things if someone swapped to killer while in a party, but maybe there could be a warning message if the button gets pressed, or maybe it could just be deactivated while there's no one else in the party with you.
---
I have been getting kicked from games a lot since the stranger things dlc launched. It will show that the killer disconnected but they didn't.  My swf will still be in the match. 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Year yare daitzoink
---
When does this hag cosmetic come out?
---
Cries in I have already bought everyone on console so now I refuse to switch to master race or switch
---
Don't blame them, blame the swf they were just put up against.
---
tbh, I'm okay with moris if they are on death hook or the last survivor with a Cypress.
---
&gt;This is a shitpost and a meme
---
Yes this is a shitpost and meme but I just made a comment and defended myself. I explained my argument and she either didn't listen or doesnt understand. I tried being polite and she kept going to I threw an insult back. If someone shoots at you and you defend yourself your not the one in the wrong. It's the person who shot at you.
---
tHeY bEaT mE iN a CoMpEtItIvE gAmE = aSsHoLeS
---
I don't follow this
---
That didn't happen 99% of the time.
---
Freddy doesn't need a lot of specific perks, so you could make BBQ work (with discordance), discordance is more of a way to catch more people with you're teleport. Otzdarva has made a video a while back where he give tips on making builds for every killer (also with an example build), can't give the link now but you type 'dbd otz killer builds' on youtube and you should be able to find it.
---
Don’t know where this will end up because I can’t pin comments BUT we’ll just say this is for people who don’t care about their rank and I know you’re out there. If you’re on Xbox, I’ll see you in the fog! Have fun &amp; stay safe.
---
sure BBQ is always viable
---
Don't have the dlc yet unfortunately.
---
5 singluar bp, gotta share, 1 for every player :)
---
I like them on trapper. Get all the fog.
---
r/nobodyasked
---
Play an easier killer first. This would include Billy (easy to play hard to master), Freddy doesn't have a huge learning curve so he's pretty good, same goes for Myers and he is just fun in general
---
Yeah, no shit, that's why I said theoretically.
---
You can get teachables without prestiging lol. What are you talking about?
---
As for why people prestige, literally just for fun and for the outfit. I just got Plague to prestige 3, and she's my first time prestiging anyone. I did it because I main vommy mommy + the bloody outfit looks great with her whole aesthetic
---
Nyoom
---
Ruin and BBQ are perks that are pretty much Meta on any killer
---
It's a lot easier than it was before. You will get use to it.
---
It happened to me yesterday. The killer was letting me go, so before leaving I came back and put my toolbox on the ground as a 'thank you', then the entity exploded me anyway.
---
You expect too much from BHVR. They gave us persistent SWF lobbies after 3 years. In a year or two we may see "change role" button return.
---
Can we talk about how many perks are useless?
---
Dude what. You dc if they have ruin? In purple/red ranks you are gonna be dcing almost every game bc Ruin is extremely meta I hope you know that.
---
I would say avoid nurse if you’re brand new unless you’re really patient.
---
Only one thing I can say
---
Get good
---
Baby killers
---
Assuming clown is actually good
---
Fuckin happened to me yesterday too, our timer said we had a quarter time left, was nearly at the exit cause trapper was gonna go to other door, but all of a sudden the timer went straight to 0 and 3 of us died when we couldve easily escaped
---
Tutorials there are many of them
---
You did a pretty good job except look at her feet...
---
No the math is pretty close. You forgot about the blood hunt bonus, and that the cake gives 103% bonus. So with 4 bps, 1 cake, and bloodhunt, it’s X+6.03X, or 225000, so still pretty close. He also said he didn’t have bbq tier three, so maybe he had tier one or two, which could explain it being slightly higher than what it should have been.
---
It was removed to fix the glitch of the multiple killer glitch if u wanna see it in action go watch IAMcow
---
It's for both survivors and killers, check your score at the end of the game it tallies it the same way it would tally bbq
---
It was at 70, I had to downvote it.
---
Party up with buddies. This gives the advantage of voice communications and proper syncing perks and items.
---
However, the game wasn't built for voice comms and perfectly complimenting teammates, so SWFs can bully killers easy
---
Unfortunately no , sorry forgot to respond
---
No it's not. It's a type of offering like the one shown in this screenshot.
---
Not gonna lie, this is totally me when I just loaded in and I already see the killers Ruin

Unless you’re like me and don’t buy cosmetics. All my killers rock their P3 outfits, unless I can afford anything with shards. It looks cool, but at the end of the day it’s up the player if millions of BP is worth just looking cool, when you can’t even see your character while playing lol

Now one mention of Hag, I feel alone. She's always been my favorite and I did a game where I used no perks with her on rank 10s and killed them all!
---
But the plot twist is the glitch has returned
---
I love when people do this. I run Spirit with NOED. Just back away, quickly phase over to them, and they’re down. I usually like to run blood warden with it too. It’s so fun to hook a teabagger when they think they’re in the clear.
---
teabagging, the buff LF needed all along.
---
Time to get tunneled by killers yay !
---
Thank you ^^
---
OK ty
---
Killers can now get pallets in their bloodweb
---
Well fucking good job BHVR is what I say
---
Ty

I never even look at my hex totems. Who knows when Survivors are watching

---
And yes, Jeff *had* to be Chewie
---
It's not the survivors who DC. A lot of people are getting kicked out of the match. After almost every match I have to restart the game too because the game will try to look for a match and then it says "lost connection, try again" and it keeps you trapped in the lobby. End game is acting weird too🤔
---
Tell that old freddy
---
They stack, why wouldn't they? Only they stack successively rather than cumulatively. So at for instance 5 tokens of Dying Light and with all four survivors injured, it's not a 15% + 16% = 31% debuff, but you apply the debuffs separately: a 80 second generator in this case takes 80 / 0.85 = ~94; 94 / 0.84 = ~ 112 seconds.
---
Both perks are pretty awful and not worth perk slots, by the way...
---
Hatch stand offs only happened if the killer didn't hit you and the survivor didn't jump in. Its not one person holding the game hostage, its both people being stubborn.
---
Zzoom
---
Thank you ^^ i plan to draw everyone eventually
---
Holy shit, they lost even though they burned a Haddonfield offering with 3 balanced landing, a strong toolbox and 4 insta heals against a huntress
---
mega oof
---
Yep, me also. Sucks cause I'm trying to p3 David and so I'm just losing alot of offerings and add ons because of this.
---
Thank you all for all the advice, I will start with farming for ruin and BBQ than try out some of the killers with a smaller learning curve and work my way though, just as I did with survivors
---
I honestly didn't think this post would catch this much traction, just thought it would be a Kodak moment.
---
I do appreciate all you guys! The support is unexpected. I send my respect all around. Keep up whatever you're doing to this subreddit, it makes daily life more enjoyable!
---
Probably has to do with loading lobbies while making purchases resulting in unexpected consequences (duping, losing funds, crashes) they could def block it off again but it's not a huge issue
---
D E S E R V E D
---
Only good Meg cosmetics to hide her face
---
Did you one hook them all bc you don’t pip that way . To really max out points and pips is playing the game fair mostly , like not tunneling bc you end the game too fast that way also not being in hook prox . By fair , I mean by having both sides have a chance to do anything . ( I know someone will take this to their grave or heart ) 
---
Have a great day of double BPS ! Spread positivity

"your flashlights hand em over"

How to get away with murder
---
The entititty is the definition of the "This is brilliant, but I like THIS!"
---
This would be a good **thing** for the game
---
Imagine going home to 60 fps. Rough times friend.
---
I thought you got better stuff?
---
Can we talk about how my life is useless?
---
I get that reference!
---
Killer: exists
---
Survivors: -rep toxic camper omfg reported
---
All I've encountered is dcing killers and people lag switching. So the usual
---
I don’t get it either , was he tunneling or something ?
---
I have only bought 3 outfits. I got the rest by playing during events or getting them with shards. You don't HAVE to spend money on cosmetics.
---
they do not.
---
I got a Bubba who wanted to farm, me and my friends (we only text no comms) didn't like the idea of it but since we already started the game we agreed. I literally run around a wall for 1 whole minute (no pallet or window, just running in a circle) with this Bubba chasing me without landing a hit (no wonder why he wanted to farm). When he finally got me he tried to facecamp me, but oh well he was also bad at tracking
---
Getting salt from survivors is a part of the killer experience. Getting salty comments is almost a badge of honor lol. Just ignore them, laugh at their immaturity and move on.
---
wig ok?
---
Honestly seems like the Wraith saw a better target below or said "screw it". Where as 4Gamers usually involve the killers screwing up on accident like that pit near the Temple for Plague.
---
He dced after i downed him when the other 3 were on hooks. So i would consider that a 4k in my books
---
*hot in the title
---
*shirtless david
---
What characters were they playing?
---
Yeah because he's shit.
---
Amazing guide, for newer players this will be hella useful.
---
That kid is going to cross map you every time- and you know it.
---
If you check the end of the clip my badges should have at least been ivory or gold but they were all grey, likely think this is a glitch
---
I did that earlier when they were running 4 bps. They literally did nothing but hide for the first 3 gens, then followed me around with flashlights through every pallet of the game. I just figured if they wanted to be assholes, they didn't deserve a mass of points. I enjoyed reading the shit they were messaging me lmao, karma never gets old.
---
Quick and Quiet + Lithe I feel are amazing perks for getting the hell out of there while confusing the killer. Lithe is easier to set off, but no so much on accident like with Sprint Burst while Quick and Quiet removes the sound notification that you are making a break for it or if you jumped into a locker as you rounded the corner.
---
Yup, this is pretty much it.
---
YES JEFF 😂
---
Oh very cool. Do you have one of Pig?
---
I really like this. Good job!!!
---
Prestiging VERY SLIGHLTY increases the chance of rare items/addons/offerings. What it distinctly doesn't affect is perks, and even if it did the amount that it affects your bloodwebs is so negligable that it doesn't really matter
---
Especially with the new system of being able to unlock two perks per 40+ web, it makes 0 sense to prestige for the purpose of the rare drop increase. If you're gonna prestige, do it for fun.
---
Glad 2 of them were bringing bps. Fuck their points.
---
My Claudette would probably be like level 500 by now.
---
Where's the Nurse appearing out of nowhere?

My bad, never actually got to such a rank so with people all talking about teachables in these comments in the same breath, I made an assumption. More I know.
---
Danny, my sweet Danny, have you forgotten that I've given you a part of King Crimson's power?
---
Dude's lucky huh?
---
"I got killed therefore it's not a gg"
---
This isn't a big, it's a feature. Honestly, having a perk to do this would be pretty cool.
---
&gt;they're not bad, but their builds are terrible.
---
ermm and on that note, I think you're forgetting your whole discussion bud
---
Toxic folk will just crouch 9 times.
---
I was waiting for a clip like this since I heard about the bug. Thank you.
---
Can someone edit this and put Nani when the killer saw Bill
---
Teachables are unlocked at level 30, 35 and 40 for every killer/survivor. After that they can appear in the bloodwebs of other killers/survivors, regardless of prestige
---
I forgot that i was in crit health state, my bad im just gonna teleport into fucking valkenheim and evoid the hit.
---
This is why i dont tempt the entity as my p3 claudette. I know it already hates us because we’re too sneaky, plus i know killers pain
---
Oh yeah , you’re right . Thank god I never had that , my friend had a glitch where he couldn’t rank up even tho he would do OBJ and safe unhooks , etc . So maybe you have that bug
---
swf = bullying?
---
I think the slugging complaints come from the ones who just down all 4 and slug and not pick everyone up and youre just forced to lay there knowing the game is over. Like we get it you won let us move on to the next game.
---
Hag is a lot of fun and terrifying with the jump scares, definitely one of the most unique and fair to play against!
---
So rude, smh.
---
I’ve been disconnected a few times.
---
But my main issue with the update is when I’m connecting to a lobby as a survivor I get this error Host Unreachable, AND after that the game just becomes bugged. I can’t return to the main screen and it can’t connect me to a lobby. So, I have to quit the game completely, and wait 100500 years till it loads back in.
---
IF the second gen ever pops hahaha
---
Bro I loved The Babysitter, so fun and only ever takes itself seriously when it has to. 
---
The big chad guy (played mike the chad in Until Dawn which is also really great) had a godlike scene that I won't spoil too much, it simply goes back and forth between bullying/threatening and encouragement/genuine care.
---
EXCELLA GIONNE VIBES.  Really Big .....
---
I love these new suggestions but that Ghosty one would be busted. I already play him without marking survivors because his shroud is so solid. If I had a brown wall hack add on I’d actually win every game.
---
Mmm yes happy cake day
---
If you don't have it yet, would agree with Leatherface for the BBQ boost, once you got it then I know some swear by Hex:Ruin (Hag).
---
technically no, but it makes your frenzy last longer as your frenzy doesn't deplete while vaulting, possibly resulting in more deviousness from a single frenzy use.
---
Spirit is better on console, Nurse is better on pc. 
---
On console Nurse is hard to use and a lot of the time doesn't work that well. On the other hand when you play on pc, Nurse becomes a s+ tier killer that can easily teleport through everything, ignore a lot of the games mechanics and in general just be broken even without addons.
---
Exact same thing has happened to me several time’s playing survivor.
---
I had Cancer, trust me I'll take facecamping over another year of chemotherapy...
---
Ignoring how dumb that is, you're ignoring the point of the picture.
---
[imagine my suprise thinking i could rescue my friends with a lot of time remaining](https://streamable.com/63xrt)
---
For low tier add one for Freddy you could use garden rake, outdoor rope, the yellow add on for fake pallets I can’t remember the name. Pretty much anything that says slows down healing, repairing and sabotaging and then fake pallets.
---
Adorable! 💖
---
Last one didn’t have a flair, Credit to u/itsmesib for the image.
---
Im new to the game can someone explain this please?
---
It’s not just killers. SWF teams are having a hard go of getting into matches too.

---
Oh yeah, that happens as well.
---
The way they explained it is that the game is full of 'spaghetti code' and that even the easiest fix become more complicated. They would have to recode the entire game from the bottom up in order to do these simple things
---
Bruh, I read all those comments and OP didn’t insult you first or “freak out” you started with the “elevator” comment and they told you “&amp; can you not be a dick and insult people’s intelligence” 
---
They weren’t being rude or bashing your comment in any way. 
---
Honestly from your post history it’s clear to see you are sexist, you then looked at her profile and saw she was a girl. This is further back by the fact that you keep using “ but you’re just thinking with your dick” as an insult.
---
Grow up and quit being a sexist jerk man, it’s not cool and that’s probably why your post history is you complaining girls don’t like you.
---
News flash- girls don’t like sexist men.
---
Jeff is my boy. And I will only ever use the black metal skin
---
I’m rlly glad I don’t play Claudette. I used to jut run a healer team oriented build with her but as killer I saw so many p3 Claudettes dc on first down, t-bag, etc.
---
Clown fucking sucks tho, I had the most depressing experience with him and Even tried different builds landing 2K at max.The bottles seem to do nothing and survivors usually bully me.
---
To be fair your score and their scores are kind of a joke for a 4k.  Looks like you gave them the PS4 Spirit experience (tunneled into the ground off each hook).
---
The characters were absolutely awful in my opinion. The movie does have a little charm but it's completely overlooked by the shitty characters and the cringy take on pop culture. 
---
Actual Dialogue from the movie-
---
King Bach's character: I heard when you die you loose all your instagram followers
---
Girl: OMMIGAHD, THAT IS LIKE THE WORRST
---
Survival bloodpoints haven’t been registering for me either. Gotta love Dead by Buglight
---
Understood!
---
Joe mama
---
The points shown there are witbout bbq
---
No shit Sherlock. I get the point.
---
When youre 2nd and 3rd prestige it feels like the entity keeps all the best perks till lvl 49
---
Crash or people quitting?
---
Doc: “Wasn’t it bring your pet to work day?”
---
Entity: “Well yes but WHY THE FUCK DID YOU BRING DEMO WITH YOU!?”
---
Doc: “So when the test subjects become mentally unstable, they’ll freak the fuck out when coming face to face with a monster from another dimension, oh and demo gets to eat.”
---
Demogorgon: *Happy hiss noise*
---
Oh hey thats my trapper! I thought this looked familiar. Sorry about the points... and the 3 gen lockdown.
---
Hex: Snatched
---
A hex totem rooting its power in hope.
---
After the final geberator has been powered, any dull totems will turn to a hec totem and have Hex: Snatched applied to it. 
---
For every that survivor stands within an open exit gate for 15 seconds or more while not, healing, recovering, mending, repairing, or sabotaging, and there are no other survivors inside of the map, AND the End Hame Collapse is within the second stage, Hex: Snatched gains a token.
---
Every second that passes, there will be a 8%/10%/12% that that second will be skipped on the end game Collapse. The End Game Collapse timer does not show the removed second and proceeds down as normal. If the End Game Collapse finishes before the timer were to run out, the timer ends and all that remain in the trial will be sacrificed.
---
-The entity screeches from its roost in anger at taunting from those in power. Eventually, it may even snap...
---
Had this happen in reverse as well. Was hooked with egc, got unhooked and the bar went back up by a third.
---
I played fair last night, first game ever as Plague.
---
Everyone escaped but not before doing the ritual exit gate booty dance for a full minute.
---
Next game I had to go with an Ebony Mori Myers.
---
Game lasted 5 minutes.
---
Especially cause it's basically scratched mirror Myers with faster movement speed.
---
I have seen killers bring way too many moris. Like what the fuck!?
---
But plague is a infinite Tier 3 w/o addons
---
100000%
---
As a killer main, I’ve secretly wished it would stay as an anti toxic measure XD
---
If that was me I would hit him out of panic.
---
RIP legion. O e of my favorite killers nerfed into..  heaven? Maybe they'll get buffed some day
---
Perks? Feh that's irrelevant fool, fashion is the only thing that matters.
---
Oh my God he's just a lil baby.  Quick someone take a picture he's playing with my keys.  Soooooooo adorable!
---
Thanks man I'll be playing Freddy in no time considering how fast levelling is right now. Can't wait to try him since I'm stuck getting gen rushed with bubba :D
---
He’s super fun to play. You can mindgame the shit out of people with his teleport and fake pallets always give me a laugh.
---
Lol!  Decisive skill check is so easy to hit.  You sound like you just fell off the back of the truck new.  Just learn how to play the game and you'll feel foolish looking back on this post.
---
Had one with 4 BPS yesterday and the survivors wanted me to farm which I was cool with.  Unfortunately I wasn’t getting any notifications on Xbox and they were all showing up on my phone.  While I was trying to figure it out I got a “No Network Connection” message and was sent back to the main menu.  Gotta love it.
---
It’s honestly hit or miss for me. Sometimes the entity gives me a break. Other times “imma just take 30% of the web kthenks”
---
I didn't mean that BBQ was affecting the score, I meant he had 4 separate hooks, but only 15k. Which means that each survivor had to have died on their first hook each. You get a lot more than 15k for chasing and hooking 4 different survivors multiple times.
---
Ruin dying light and thanataphobia on plague means gens are going to take forever. Or you can cleanse and let me wreck some faces. Worth the slots if you ask me.
---
I only teabag killers that facecamp. Or if they were friendly I’ll get close and teabag next to them. Otherwise I never do it lol.
---
That's so hypocritical, didn't you complain about other people ruining your games by being toxic? Isn't trying to take bloodpoints away from survivors at the end of the game super toxic?
---
Best dad
---
Eh? I'm a Legion main and completely destroy lobbies.
---
Hey look! My new home, scoot over kitty
---
Jane: Bill! GET DOWN the doctor is coming  
---
Bill: ***SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST***  
---
Jane: wait wha-  
---
Bill: ***NOT GETTING LEFT BEHIND AGAIN***
---
It was at 70.. Now it's at 69. A small price to pay for salvation.
---
Killers can also ruin this as much as survivors by bringing Moris. The game just feels like a big pile of toxic players right now and the only way to avoid it is to not bring offerings.
---
I beg and plead aloud while being chased and a killer is doing bad and there's one gen left like, dude please get somebody and I don't even care if it's me. Mostly coz I can't play this game unless I've been hitting the vodka first and I don't want the killer to be so bad he can't catch me drunk Dwight driving.
---
Not as much as Diablo, it eats battery faster though.
---
you obviously care a lot about strangers on the internet from this post and your own replies. \*"I would probably do something like that\[dcing so others cant get BP\] except I don’t like DCing (never have, probably never will) and I feel like at least *something* good should come out of the shitty game. If nothing else, I get a few bloodpoints"\*. legit wanting to ruin the game fopr others since they were "toxic"
---
F.
---
Just a non-DBD note, though - I don't know all the facts, but you should never 'cultivate a relationship' for that long. (First of all, it sounds a bit insidious. Like you've spent a year of your lives grooming someone.) If you're interested, take some time to find the best approach, but don't wait that long. Do it, or accept the friendship.
---
Think if it from her/his perspective: they thought this entire time you'd been friends with no underlying motivation, then suddenly you admit 'This entire time I've been building up to ask you out, and this has been more than platonic from my side'. It's a bit creepy, and they start thinking back to times that they assumed were completely platonic, but you had a sexual/romantic side to it that they weren't aware of.
---
People aren't objects to be primed, or groomed, or put into the most advantageous position and state of mind to ensure their acceptance.
---
I downvoted you.
---
I like his little hands, they make me happy
---
I got a good chuckle out of this. Have my upvoye
---
*gets 5 ebony Moris on nurse*
---
She can't be THAT hard right?
---
10 minutes later
---
"Fuck that stupid bin bag bitch flying into walls n shit"
---
The point of the post was to show a glitch 
---
The glitch made it so all my emblems were grey as if I did nothing
---
The reason for the low points was due to the game being around 5 minutes with all the survivors entering the basement 1 by 1 after I hooked the first guy in the basement. Allowed for a quick and simple game
---
We're gonna live forever is your best bet
---
No she started it when she called me defensive for defending my point then she called me a dick so I said an insult back.
---
&gt;They weren't being rude or bashing your comment in anyway
---
Yes she did she again she called me defensive for defending then called me a dick. Then I threw my insults. If you dont want to be insulted dont insult other people because if you do someone will do it to you. 
---
Also I find it so funny your saying I was sexist towards her when I never said anything even then if she said something sexist towards me you whiteknights will try to spin it to make her look the victim even though she started it by calling me offensive then a dick.
---
&gt;News flash girls dont like sexist men 
---
Ok that has nothing to do with it. I made a comment on a post she responded by calling me defensive and a dick so I said an insult back.
---
tHank u kind stranger!!! XDDD 🎖🏆🥇🥈🥉🏅🏅🥈🏆🎖🏆🥇🥉🏅🥇🎖🎖
---
Why
---
Gotta love new SWF gonna see low ranks in high rank games FUCK YEAH
---
Dude you fucking killed him
---
King Bach shouldn’t be in any movie man is not funny lol
---
It's not called farming if you're on the winning side and try to slow down the game by hooking a survivor and leaving it so everyone can get more bloodpoints. I don't like farming either but I certainly don't like finishing the games as fast as possible.
---
Wtf is that flair
---
This has happened to me a few times. No toxic intentions either. I had a game earlier against a Freddy who had blood warden after he hooked me, I had deliverance so was waiting nearby the gate to wait for blood warden to go so I could escape and the timer was no where near the end. I clipped it and saw that it even reset a bit and continued going down.
---
Nah don't defend that type of behavior by downplaying the conpetitiveness of the game.  Not everyone takes it as casual as you do.  Sandbaggers playing to kill teamates is a valid complaint.
---
I had that happen to me while I was trying to escape after saving my friend ;-; 
---
It sucked
---
This has happened to me before, but I wasn’t just waiting/teabagging for the fuck of it, I was at least healing just to get a few more points before leaving.  The last 2/3 inches of the timer just zapped to 0.  I was pretty mad that day.
---
Was wondering what this was. Had a game as Huntress recently to get 4 hatchet hits daily quest, and I was letting everyone escape so we were just messing around. I saw the timer running out and was like “they’re gonna leave, right?”  Spoilers: they didn’t. 3 died to it. Had a good laugh in the lobby after
---
They’re too busy doing gens, you?
---
haha
---
This needs to be an offering.
---
Haha
---
My fav killer is Myers, and i have a blast with him until about rank 10. It stops being fun when winning requires playing dirty as Myers and I dont want to. losing and reading shit talk in the chat because your fav killer cant keep up on certain map,s or whatever the case it is, ruins the fun.
---
He’s saying that his friends have terrible builds dumbass. Op isn’t talking about the killer
---
Yeah, this is big brain time.
---
You hooked everyone but only got 15k?
---
Yikes someone's toxic.
---
Same exact thing happened to me :(
---

😝
---
Nobody hates hates the character just his poorly thought out power
---
Aww that is very sweet thank you q.q
---
..your claudettes do gens!?
---
Yeah once I've noticed a big when playing with a friend (PS4) where when the end game collapse would start, my timer for it would be permanently paused, while my friend could see the timer going like normal, so he had to tell me when it was getting close to the end. If I wasn't playing with him, I wouldn't have even been able to tell.
---
This happened to me and my friend last night. Killer messaged to farm and during the endgame collapse I got out and my friend waited for the hatch but our 4th wasn't leaving and my friend tried to leave through the gates cause timer was getting low and when it got to having a quarter left it just ended there and killed him. What's the point in a countdown if it doesn't portray the correct time you have left
---
I don’t think it was ever fixed, but if you do it, you get banned.
---
Not shirtless, that's too cliche. How about a type of lingerie that shows his belly and thighs?
---
I think I might be going to far with this.
---
This happened to my entire team meanwhile we were just healing up around the map. We knew it was a bug and the timer froze at the start, except the ground didn’t even turn orange so we thought we had time and all died.
---
OMG I wanna upvote 100 times and more. I read everything singing. Thank you for your time and creativity writting it for us. 
---
I'll use doc's message. o/

Damn, how hypocritical of you, you wrote "if she had google places" hmm, maybe you should check yourself before calling someone out for a simple spelling error?
---
I have this daily to do and oh god please no corn.

Stop nerfing the oinker!
---
Thanks! I appreciate the help
---
Your memes are D tier. Literally 3 in a row and they all suck.
---
Right back at you.
---
Thank you. &lt;3
---
Most I’ll do is slug if they’re on death hook and the game isn’t going too quickly or I still need a lot of points to max.
---
This is more based on their personalities. Except for Freddie being a boomer cause it just plays on how you gotta be woke from his sleep.
---
Y'all forgot about when Legion was the most annoying ass killer I take it.  Even more annoying than Spirit.
---
nice

I ALREADY HAVE FREDDY, ENTITY, STOP GIVING ME SMOKING SPLINTERS.

Oh God 😂

you also have 13 karma

Basically in TF2 you can slide up stairs like it's a ramp if you hit it at the correct angle and speed. You can look up some rocket jumping stair slide videos.
---
It was  kinda necessary, he doesn't need a buff or a Nerf. He needs to be scrapped and completely reworked. His power is just horribly thought out, buff him and he loses counterplay or nerf him and he becomes almost useless
---
MuHaHaHaHa!

[no buddy. I’m so sorry, but no](https://youtu.be/_MvbUqOVJic)
---
Oh okay. I didn't know that.
---
Cute!
---
Karma isn't important to me. It is to you clearly. Seeing as you post the worst memes ive seen all day.
---
Yup, the bloodweb was changed in the Stranger Things update.
---
You're a fucking thief giving his opinion on memes LMAO. Please save your face and delete this.
---
I don't even think bottom left is a bad thing.
---
If you are awake then you are in the terror radius so Borrowed Time should work. However, even if borrowed time activated and unhooked survivor nullifies one hit, they’ll go asleep and mending timer will not pause, so if Freddy decided to keep tunnelling them they’ll fall anyway.
---
Bro she playin' Castlevania over there wtf
---
Took me 15 minutes to find a game
---
Oh no! Please no reddit! GiVe mE KaRmA
---
This to be honest it works quite nicely on plague due to either you cleanse and give uer power a nice boost or all 4 of you sit with a new thana debuff.
---
It does work nicely on other killers but it works nicely on plague due to her killer mechanics.
---
I do gens til the fucker is breathing down my neck
---
I want that LEDface
---
Going for the save is the opposite of greedy tho
---
lmao same, or a demoknight trimping
---
"Insta heals" and tbags only to get hit by noed.
---
I wish her weapon wasn't so huge. I feel like it blocks my view way more than other killer weapons so I tend to lose track of survivors way more often on a missed hit with her.
---
Nice acting Lindsey Lohan
---
Yay NEW BUGS!
---
Unrelenting, fired up, remember me!, and NOED, if you kill the obsession before they finish the last gen they’re screwed
---
I'd say demo should be in a higher tier
---
Amen brother
---
Also ghost face they shouldn't be with the doctor or clown
---
The Claudette deserved it TBH :)
---
If this is a bug, it totally should be a killers hidden offering.
---
Big Freddy buff, survivors never wake up
---
Lol it's the entity, working that over time so you can't escape.
---
Still waiting to see that in game.
---
haha thanks
---
this happened to me when i played surv for a daily, finally got unhooked and thought i could easily make it out seeing as the bar was still halfway then BOOM all 3 of us get insta entitied and the guy who ran out the gate immediately didnt comment on what utter BS had just happened! killer said gg ez and left afterwards.
---
The plague should go down to c tier.  She's just not that strong without her ultra rare addons
---
And you got mad enough to reply. Look at that, the pot calling the kettle black.
---
Grow up.
---
STOP BEING NICE - Entity
---
I have a few really nice builds to run. The one i run the most is PWYF, Make your Choice, Ruin and Haunted Grounds. It allows for you to get really fast speed which helps the Wraith tremendously in chases and getting back to hook. Haunted and Make your Choice snowball extremely well and can cause for a really fast game if you play it right. The add ons I recommend are double shadow dance so pallets and loops become 100x easier to deal with. There are a few other really fun and good builds out there such as fast bing bongs, full speed builds using windstorm and all seeing ones where you can see the survivors essentially at all times. I suggest if you are looking for good/ fun builds for Wraith to check out Monto or Otzdarva since all of the builds they use the go in depth on how they work and show how to effectively use them!
---
Protip: Expensive items dont mean shit if you combo Ace in the hole + Plungerers. No joke I have got more iridicent maps and dull keys from chest runnign those perks than I could ever get from the bloodweb going from 1 to 70+. I must have gotten 3 iri maps and 2 keys last night and I only played like 10-12 games.
---
Anyone with AFK crows during the endgame collapse should get exploded.
---
That would be hilarious for the first month as all the toxic players learn about the new feature the hard way.
---
Hey, do killers find waiting at the exit gates "toxic"? I do it if I haven't been in the game for 10 minutes so I can max out my level gain for the match, because if I instantly leave, it's a minus for me. I'm trying to save up for Spirit so I can actually get to rank 1, you know..
---
I play both killer and Survivor equally, and of course, tea-bagging at the gates can be a little bit frustrating if I haven't gotten even a single kill in that match, and is something that makes me lose a little bit of faith in myself for a short amount of time. If I know that I've played well and gotten 1-2 kills before the exit gates are open, I actually feel better, because tea-bagging a killer at the exit gates means you've done well and people want to take "revenge" on you, by repeteadly pressing CTRL.
---
TL;DR it isn't toxic to wait at the exit gates, but it IS toxic to tea-bag at them. If you wait at the exit gates and give the killer a hit before leaving, it's ok. But if you don't give him any hit / make fun of him, that's a whole different story.
---
Youre also rank 2, this is my third comment but this post is so ignorent and I'm not having it. You really expect any killers to farm in high rank??
---
I also like how the Bill went behind Dwight to take the hit for him
---
Good idea. I’ve always wanted to try Scratched Mirror Myers. I’ve only played one game as him, but I’ll get there eventually.
---
Minecraft Myers: *exists*
---
Creeper: *am i a joke to you*
---
I don’t care about loosing. I care about fun and Bloodpoints for everybody. If a killer tunnels and or camps it will be a lot less fun for everybody, but exponentially so for the one who is on the receiving end.
---
From my experience behavior like this greatly increases during events. 
---
Why not make events a place for people to be a bit more forgiving and friendlier to each other no matter the role instead of making the general atmosphere worse than it is during normal play, is all I am trying to get at.
---
Dying quickly to a killer due to misplays or similar stuff has nothing to do with it. I merely wanted to call out the people who seem to be out to ruin people’s fun rather than using the event to farm BP by playing normally or friendly.
---
Awesome, being rude for no reason!
---
LET ME TOUCH YOUR BUTT
---
Maybe if he could hit one survivor it ends but they need a teammate to mend it? Like fuck knows but I think he is a fun killer because he's different but hard to balance
---
With your build i’d say you’d get about max of fifteen thousand with a bps thirty thousand, you have to make yourself make the game last longer than it would have
---
Clown definitely. I would say Clown is pretty unusable. Legion might be second worst, I'm just saying I don't find him tremendously difficult (whereas I do find Huntress difficult, myself).
---
It feels so satisfying and so deserved. I wish for this too!
---
Classic movie lmao
---
Why do you sound like a overbearing parent. Enough with this kindergarden shit
---
This does put a smile on my face
---
EVERYONE IS SO CASUAL ESP DWIGHT
---
Spirit huntress trapper clown and legion should go down one
---
And leather face, and demo should go up one
---
Didn't get a clip, but had this happen with a group while I was playing The Nightmare for a daily the other day.  I'm rank 13 right now, but freddy is level 8.  So I don't play with him and he only gets 2 weak perks.  It was pretty bad, I got my daily completed but they ran all over me.  Last 2 people were running around the map with a key hunting for the hatch... both died.
---
It was a brilliant touch, I haven't had a good scare like that in a while so thank you, really. 😆
---
Going to have to downvote it to keep it at 69
---
They need to make the gate interactable so a killer can close it. If you wanna waste time or be toxic. Trapped.
---
Why do you have to be such a downer? Take your negativity somewhere else dude.
---
How dare you lag switch you filthy bitch, even though I’m the only one who was lagging.
---
All of the other ones were once human, normally their minds are distorted beyond understanding, but legion is just an edgy teenager
---
But my problem is 10 matches you have played you have been tunneled, but so have others. How does a killer tunnel more than one person?
---
Happened to me yesterday I stayed back to try and save someone, and got fucked by the timer.
---
Dad I'm Sanic
---
I thought I was the only survivor going through that garbage lol.
---
Tecnically legion only killed one person before going to the fog
---
Did he steal this from Bill?
---
It’s really trippy when people act surprised when people DC. Duh, no one wants to get demolished during the Bloodhunt.
---
Underrated comment 😂
---
My nipples look like milk duds!
---
Briiir brrrirrr brurr
---
Mostly just because they want the bloody clothing, Supposedly having higher prestige means rare addons and items appear more,but I got a P3 Feng with all the perks (the ones I have unlocked) and the increased chance must be very darn minuscule because bloodwebs are around the same between her and any of my regular lvl50 survivors.
---
Same, EXCEPT if I'm the only one who brought a BPS, then I'm doing whatever I feel like.  If they bring a lot of BPSs, I'll be extra nice.
---
Had this happen yesterday, a Huntress got 1 sacrifice before we were able to get all the gates opened. I had more than half the timer left, so I went to get a totem that was right near an exit (no killer in site). Timer gets halfway down, then just drops completely, I was so pissed
---
Yesterday we got a AFK Wraith so we did everything and we were waiting in the gates to get more survival points... then the AFK Wraith got a 4k.
---
Hello, what is the protocol for babies that teabag? I don’t kill often but when I do that’s what kind of people I get
---
My bloodhunt has been going pretty good I’m playing killer finding games and getting around 90k perk game I make sure to never put on Mori’s unless it’s a daily other then that I bring 3rd year cakes bps survivor puddings and shells and the survivors I’ve gotten aren’t toxic at all
---
I understand and I am okay with this sacrifice
---
Freddy should be with huntress and billy, hag might be up there as well
---
You want me to post a very, very nice tutorial on how to use them?
---
But like I pointed out there, even with all four people injured, it's only a measly 15 seconds more on generators - and that does not mean a total of 5 * 15 seconds either, as generators get repaired simultaneously. On heals it's even less (3 seconds to be exact). Plague is the best killer to use Thanatophobia since survivors will not seldomly all be injured at all times, and even on her it is unfortunately just not worth a slot. Dying Light is similarly awful, since its numbers are also negligible, to an extent where before its numbers start mattering, you have to basically already have won the game without DL's help, getting 8+ hooks.
---
Ruin, Weasel and Corruption are the best stalling perks by far.
---
Spirit is not SS unless you have beads
---
Yeah I agree with that but as the killer just force them out of the gates, go to the hatch and be done with it. It's like an extra minute of time and it's not that big of a deal. 
---
Calling everything toxic and blowing it out of proportion actually motivates the worst of the toxic players because they want to get a reaction. With as much as it's discussed and as upset and people seem to get, those assholes have all the motivation they need.
---
It looks good
---
Why is her ass 90 degrees from her back xD But it’s 100 times better than anything could do !

Apparently the only reason to prestige is if you want the bloody outfits of the killer/survivors, otherwise, if what you want is to increase your chances at getting ultra rare addons/items your best bet is just to get ALL perks available with that character and then continue to generate bloodwebs (so that the spaces destined for perks are now used for items, which increases the odds for an extra ultra rare to spawn)
---
That legion thing is pretty bad, its literally just a sped up chase theme
---
No, the Chad move is to hit them with a fat NOED
---
The patch notes for 3.2.1 already states this as a known issue. Just get out as soon as possible when Endgame starts.
---
good thing you didnt stop, you could have been killed.
---
I feel for ya, bud!
---
Yesterday I had to stop playing earlier than I wanted, because the survivor lobbies were so long (it would take around 15 mins to queue into a game) and after the wait is finally over, I’d get a Mori or omega-blink Nurse or camping Wraith. Like it just wasn’t worth it.
---
or hooked
---
I ain't very good at proportions and shite tbh, why I'm practising haha
---
Backstory: this is how the game starts, i grab Dwight out of a locker thanks to monitor. I go across map to shack and find David who i chase all the way back to Main house, hook him and ignore injured Dwight who is like 10m away and start chasing Feng who was clearly higher rank then her friends. However Dwight starts healing now right behind me, close enough for me to hear him bandageing up so i slug him and continue after Feng. She escapes and i turn around and see Kate with nurses healing Dwight and thats pretty much where the clip starts.
---
Knock em' out for good.
---
There might be a ghost face stalking around that area!
---
I appreciate some of the more grounded and less monsterous killers like ghost face and legion. Adds some different flavor to the lore and feel of their characters
---
just like Legion, if anything there are several killers that arguably weren't "ready to kill" when being taken by the Entity and were forced into doing so via torture, so even in that department Frank at the very least is willing to kill, and his friends have a dangerous loyalty to him that they would as well even Susie despite her doubts. That's what makes Legion dangerous especially with all of them being at a rather young age.
---
Because you can hear a downed survivor 36 meters away right ? Imagine you got the ears of Mickey mouse
---
Man a whole surv group got 4k'd on a game I played because of this.
---
If you have the game saved and could make a video showcasing it. I’d love to watch it, just a thought you don’t have too
---
just have to ask did he make a new account because you blocked him? idk why he would make a new account
---
I ain’t doggin your drawing skills but the first thought that came to my mind was damn you need the pythagorean theorem to find the slope of dat ass
---
I like your idea, but let's give a good polishing to the killers that are in need of some good ol' reworks, aka Wraith and Bubba.
---
Freddy is dummy strong now, with all those additions to his base kit.
---
It will take me out of game and say disconnected from host.
---
* Removed The Pig.
---
I always see them keep going in circles
---
Screw this
---
*DC*
---
and this is why people dont give any reason anymore, because you sheeps don't even care about reading them. Keep licking his ass
---
Omfg hahaha, I did a much better drawing a month or 2 ago on this account.
---
The "how did you know I don't have friends?" build
---
Trueeee
---
Goodbye
---
I remember it but I saw it with legion.
---
Hang the f*ck on... is that a Myers in the field?
---
And doctor is useless without his add ons, Freddy is a lot weaker without his, Myers is a boring m1 killer without his, the hag can only teleport 32 meters without add ons, trapper carries one regular trap without add ons.  
---
That's not really a valid point because you get add ons as you level them up, bubba's are boring and don't really change up his playstyle or give him any advantage besides faster charge time or cool down.
---
I have some iteration of "ttv" in my name 4 times, but I don't stream. No one sees the meme and I hate it.
---
Everyone wants to play killer and it also depends on your region and time of day.
---
There is no need for an "SS" tier, unless you're referencing the 3rd reich, because Billy and Huntress are really not that good.
---
Also Demogorgon (debatably) and Hag (inarguably) are both about as strong as Billy and Huntress
---
Thanks for including the movement speed increase in your description. Too many people just mention it's expose effect which is obviously amazing but the extra movement speed is just the extra "fuck you" that makes me hate the perk.
---
This is emperor crimson's ability
---
Also what the fuck is Trapper doing that high?
---
I may have played you last night when you were Mikey lol. Sounds familiar.
---
get Tapp(ed)
---
And then they just crawl out anyway because they dont leave the entity wall
---
The twist is it was cleansed when it activated.
---
The Incel account is a year old so he didn’t just make it, I don’t really know why he commented with another account. Maybe he just wasn’t paying attention when he commented and forgot he was on his other one.
---
In my experience, killers just do this when you find their ruin
---
The matchmaking takes way too long right??? I thought the same... I mean I know a lot of people had mentioned it before. But wow, 40 min and still no match
---
Seems unnecessarily mean for the bloodhunt.
---
Yeah I was actually shocked at how long it took to get into a game last night. Did you have a glitch where it looks like you’re going to load into a lobby but instead it takes you right back to the survivor screen, where you have to ready up again? I had that happen like every other game, it was so frustrating.
---
Suppose that makes sense, it's still frustrating as a solo queuer who switches regularly... do swfs go back to the same lobby when they leave now?
---
Lol ok.
---
True but it's super demotivating to get tbagged when I'm just getting bp playing leather face. Just wanna chill out instead getting frustrated.
---
&gt; **From a survivor's POV:**  Fuck you for being especially toxic at the sight of 2+ BPS. All I see  are mori's, tunnelling, facecamping and are just going out of your way  to fuck people over. Thanks. 
---
Honestly, I think this is a way to get back at survivors for another season of toxicity and affter the last round where 4 escaped and insulted me into oblivion, I am glad I saved up like 2 dozen mori with Spirit.
---
feelsgood.jpg
---
Sometimes, it's necessary to tunnel someone in order to reduce odds for the other survivors. Having 4 survivors alive for more than 3 minutes in a game is like asking to be anally ruptured.
---
Of course, tunneling at the start of the game may be annoying, but if I get tunneled mid-game or something, knowing that I've already gained a pip, or safety pip, I don't really care. I just leave with my BP knowing that I can instantly get in another game.
---
If you get destroyed in your first match, that doesn't mean that the second one will be crappy too. People are different, and you'll most likely not face the same person two times in a row. Infinite mindgame possibilities.
---
Holy shit
---
Not shirtless? We’ll see about that...
---
Yes!!!!! It's been happening a lot! I thought the killer just disconnected before I loaded in... i assumed they couldn't get any game as well so they gave up. Never knew it was a glitch haha
---
Wraith gets no love. Shame.
---
Easy to avoid getting crows. Trolls do it all the time.
---
I wasn't meaning to imply you don't do those things. Just kinda throwing some thoughts out. But yeah we gotta take sweet justice when we can in this game lol
---
The queue times for killer are abysmal on PC. Taking 20+ hours to get into a match. I've played over 100 hours as survivor and just started playing killer a week ago. I find it is the survivors that are toxic more often than not. That being said I'm just trying to either play normally or farm.
---
Hope this and the glitch that won't let people escape get fixed
---
I always see toxic Kates. Like, if you're playing a Kate with a flashlight.. prepare for tunnel town bitch. It's over for you.
---
When the EGC begins opening the exit gate if the hatch gets shut or the other door is open, you get points for opening the door during the EGC
---
It’s annoying bro. My streams have been nothing but me playing survivor. I like playing survivor but fuuuuuuck, I want to kill.
---
Did someone said whispers?!
---
It not a bug it just the entity getting sick of toxic survivors smh
---
She must be a highschool gym teacher
---
He who controls the pants controls the universe!
---
This would be a really interesting addition to the game. As long as the BP we're worth it, otherwise people would just ignore it.
---
it took me a minute...
---
I am confusion
---
It isnt enough for some people to just win a match. They gotta be shitty at rub it in. This guy got some serious justice at the end of his game lol
---
nurse and wraith would fit more as parents tbh
---
Ok good, so it’s not just me, haha. Yeah I think it is a glitch because I never even see the lobby screen, and usually if the killer is going to dodge, it takes a few seconds for them to leave.
---
Thats stupid for banning people on custom games
---
r/nonononoyes
---
Kindred and Open Handed are broken together as a solo, use a 4 man team with it and you see the killers aura for 56 meters
---
I can dream they're still there
---
Is that an I funny.co water mark? I don’t think you made the edit
---
Just make a new steam and wait till the game is on sale lol
---
[By far the best explained tutorial I've seen.](https://youtu.be/pshlJLOeX7k)

Pretty much nailed that on the head.

---
THIS IS THE POWER OF「EMPEROR CRIMSON」
---
Wha- what is that white stuff on Goku?.... DEAR LORD
---
That does not address the root problem.
---
I agree.
---
If I run thst build, they probably cleanse DH/Ruin first
---
Release happens when you open the gate durning the end game collapse. In order for this to happen, the other gate had to have been opened or the killer needed to have closed the hatch.
---
Poor Philip! I love you Philip!! ❤️
---
Would you even believe if I had all the cut parts to make the edit?
---
Then what do I do
---
Root problem of what? You cheated and getting banned? You won't "win" anything from it you are wasting your time
---
Did the killer even have time because she hopped in right as it opened.
---
I mean sure but why is the water mark there
---
That should be true
---
Well X is suppose to represent how many points you get before the boost and just note 8k for each caategory and im pretty sure perks dont work after the offering is applied they should work before but either way he still lied theirs no way he got 229k
---
Usually takes around 4ish minutes for me to find a lobby as killer. It’s really easy to find matches at night but kinda sluggish in the morning.
---
I do
---
I have seen that happen before, yes! Not every single game, maybe every third one. There are always so many weird bugs after each chapter/update lol
---
Waiting 10 minutes for a lobby just so that only one of you actually connects to it. Feelsbadman.
---
Same. And its quite frankly getting annoying.
---
Some people are just mean
---
you also get tokens for taking hits near an injured teammate, no need unhooks
---
you did nothing wrong, tho it wasnt really nice :D
---
No you don't understand. You're at a 4 to 1 disadvantage for literally just buying the game/starting a match, it's not fun watching legit no joke 2 gens finish in the first 1 minute of the game because you chased one of the 2 survivors off a gen for 15 seconds tops , and the other dude immediately goes back to working on that same gen since they know you're a fucking Pig and won't be getting downs anytime soon.
---
I've seen multiple games end with people dying to it like 10 seconds early lol. Just really sucks cause saves at endgame are super dangerous now cause of the broken timer.

I lost all my brain cells reading this. Thank you!
---
If they've been nerfing survivors for a year, maybe is because they were OP? They still are better than the killer, just not as ridiculously stronger as before. And Otz? Pffff, nice joke. Otz is good, but he doesn't make advanced tutorials, besides, even he knows how if you play low tier killers, in high ranks vs swf, there's no way uou're winning consistenly.
---
Just a little map awareness and headphones is better than wasting a perk slot.
---
I literally have no flashlights on my 6 P3 lvl 50 survivors. None. It takes to lvl them up like 4-5 times to get one.
---
I've never had this much issue getting into a game before...i don't get it.
---
Killer has been impossible to get a match and I've only been able to get into 3 games as a survivor since last night... one of which was a waste of time because NO ONE but me worked on gens.
---
I've also noticed that in all 3 matches i have gotten into, the killers have been disconnecting after we all leave...pointless.
---
Thanks alot this was really bothering me!
---
this is me during this event  
---
it's taking me like 20 minutes to find a game as killer, and i'm either obliterating genuine new players who are rank 20 or being matched with purple/red meta perk survivors and getting smashed. 
---
i just want some bp :( i brought banners and they still acted like complete assholes
---
while your right, imagine us farming while nea just does gens. Thats not playing normally. Dead By Daylight is really boring without a killer (IMO). So just because three people want to get cheap bloodpoints an entire other persons game is ruined? I don't find that fair.
---
It's good if you know how to abuse it, it isn't good if you just use it passively. If you know how to force the killer to grab you, it's easily abused, specially combined with good usage of exhaustion perks.
---
Just another day with DBD, fix one bug, create 10 others.  aka Get BVHR'd

4 survivors escaping is toxic!!!!!!!! Don't they know at least THREE of them are supposed to let you kill them? how fucking dare they
---
This means Freddy’s fucking his sisters.
---
Why Legion?
---
I still win wo it
---
I do understand, I’m a pig main lol. I never really said there wasn’t better killers, I was just saying IF your having fun then the killer is good. That’s all. I’ve been “gen rushed” and I’ve gen rushed killers but honestly what else are you supposed to do as a survivor besides gens? Yeah you can get chased and do totems but you won’t pip from just that and you won’t be getting out any time soon if no one is doing gens.
---
No way he was getting in grab range. Would have been beautiful though.
---
Literally every double BP event is like this, most older players cringe a little when we hear BP events are coming.
---
Why would pure evil bring streamers?
---
Copyright Monto's build industry : russian roulette spirit
---
Eewww a basement dweller! I personally think monstrous shrine isn’t good at all. No matter what the build is.
---
Because you are probably green ranks, they don’t know how to play. If you reach purple or red ranks you’re gonna get gem rushed
---
Look, I get it if you want to use mori's against toxic SWFs. It's normal to get pissed off, and while I don't personally do it, letting off steam with an ebony every once in a while is, to an extent, understandable.
---
What I don't get is why people like you wait to do it during this event specifically. If everyone brings BPS, farms and gets the max amount, everyone wins a hefty amount of bloodpoints. If the killer decides to bring an ebony and just demolish the opposition, the best you can get is 15K and all of those BPS's were wasted. No one wins.
---
What is prayer beads spirit?
---
That game only would've lasted 10-15 minutes. Its not that big of a deal that the Nea would be upset over losing such a small amount of time, plus she would've gotten her share of bloodpoints too from being the gen jocky. Instead of everyone benefiting only you and the Nea did. Most people dont play normally during the bloodhunt, a good amount of us meme and farm. You might wanna get used to it.
---
Dont worry, 8 meters dont seem like a lot solo so I understand why you believe it should be buffed. But when it stacks, its insane for Kindred and Bond. Its alright
---
A game that lasts like 40 minutes but gives you 30k isn't really better than a game that lasts 10 minutes and gives you 20k.
---
Something recent has cause a really big desync issue, especially for the endgame timer for some reason.
---
At the very worst she should be B tier, if Survivors refuse to cleanse she still halves the length of chases and gets slightly better tracking on Survivors
---
This...disappoints me greatly
---
I also played as survivor and found games in less than 5 minutes.
---
Why would they use them now? Even if they fail to kill all four, you still get double BP for what you did get done. Simple as that from my perspective.
---
its always the sacrifice category....
---
Clown is really fun to play, you're not going to win but it's fun lmao. Let me rephrase, when you play against better survivors you will hook like crazy but them peeps aint dying.
---
Just spin and hit walls until they notice you’re nice. Then you can hook each of them twice over and over (they will hopefully let you) then you can let them enter chases and hit pallets on you. And at the end either let them escape and be nice, or murder them all
---
Justice
---
not a 4man swf (2 at max), but well done
---
KINGU CRIMZON!
---
How what happened to it?
---
a skillcheck can't trigger if there isn't any charge progression. It's useless to stop working on the gen after you failed a hex skill check.
---
Or maybe the entity had enough of their shit lol
---
My cousin once got grabbed and moried at the exit gate my Myers, they were running Fragrant Tuft and Judith’s, we didn’t know until the very end when he got moried. Taught me to never try something like that against a Myers lol
---
No one can sneak up with spine chill
---
yeah, I felt just like you.
---
I found the store button enabled and was checking some dope plague cosmetics just to realize it cancelled my queue.
---
As other people have said, nurses calling is incredible on wraith. Ruin sloppy and nurse’s is a good foundation and you can run anything else with it tbh, but I would get rid of deerstalker ASAP
---
Just chase them out.
---
It's the equivalent of a killer "facecamping" the last survivor in the game as they're dying on hook. It's a non-issue relative to gameplay.
---
Imagine someone else coming to work on the generator with you and a legion comes sprinting out of the field
---
Got-dangit Joe Bob
---
Eh kinda deserved it tho
---
I don’t approve of this basement camping living bullshit don’t camp
---
Spirits by default, and outside of that, the types of Freddys I see a lot.
---
Freddy with Dying Light, Thana, Ruin, Pop, using Swing Chains/Jump Rope/Outdoor Rope.
---
I really don't want to spend 3 minutes on a single gen to have Freddy come and remove the last 50 seconds of progress. That shit is ultra boring and when I come across it I will kill myself on first hook without hesitation.
---
I commented this somewhere else but I've literally been trying to queue into a killer match for the last 2 hours. I've played 1 game. I'm getting frustrated. They literally supposedly just fixed matchmaking. I'm a low rank killer too 18 and a notch. I don't understand what the issue is. Inb4 everyone is playing killer cause double bloodpoints! No. This should not be a problem.
---
That's really unfortunate 😂
---
We had a 3 man swf yesterday against doc on disturbed ward, our random got found and hooked first. They instantly hook suicided, my friend ran him for every bit of 5 gens. He got downed at the very end and doctor had a cypress mori so he just stood over his slugged body waiting for the rest of us to leave him, long story short he was just about to crawl out of the exit gates then doc picked him up so I go in to try and bait the save with BT but he used the doctor tech and instantly grabbed me then tried to drop me so I wiggled free. Then as I do my girlfriend unhooks him and as soon as his feet touch the ground the EGC goes from maybe 20 seconds on the clock to 40 to instantaneous 0 and we all died which allowed the absolute baby doc to turn a depip into a 4k all because the game was bugged. Horrible way to end the match /:
---
Tbh use Whispers III if you have it instead of deerstalker
---
Don’t forget you can manually get them to wiggle out by dropping them 3 times, but flashlights are good too.
---
I like my green keys with a prayer bead and a praying rope
---
If you camp basements with Leatherface, you're a problem.
---
Either be better, or uninstall.
---
understandable lol
---
Love it, and it has some nice achievements added to it.

Why is this NSFW?

All tier 3 by the way

I just want to have fun. Hell, just yesterday when the bloodhunt started, I log on and the first match I get is Spirit proxy camping with red mori. The next match I get a different spirit that started to slug and camp the last 3 gens. I talked to both killers in the post chat and the Spirit with red mori said he camped because he doesn't want survivors to hook rush for BP and then the spirit camping gens said that she just wanted to waste time and hold the game hostage because ONE GUY in the lobby t-bagged him at the gate in a previous game. Now listen, I am not trying to paint the killers as bad guys, because they are not in fact, both killers and survivors can be toxic, but lets be honest, this toxicity is ruining the game for everybody involved.

---
It's ok, I see why though. I thought he would be cool.
---
I can play killer how I want to. Survivor mains can't tell me what to do.
---
It was needed for consistency. Anytime you are oblivious it means you can not hear the terror radius, and in the dream state you are oblivious, therefore Borrowed Time shouldn’t work. I think the change is perfectly fine.
---
I'm killer, I do what I want. Survivor mains can't tell me what to do.
---
I encourage Otzdarva meme in every t-bag webm from now on
---
The basic layout, except I use M2 for skillchecks, which makes it waaaaay easier to hit greats. And clicking the scrollwheel for item use since I don't usually bring items much anyway.
---
If your camping might as well hang out. Or just use insidious and no other perk and call it a day.
---
Yeah then it just gets depressing and frustrating
---
I mean it's pretty bad but if you're going for a Basement Build (Monstrous Shrine, Agitation, Iron Grasp, Insidious) then sure?
---
9% faster progression is saving you 10.8 seconds so it goes from 120 seconds to 109.2 seconds to fully sacrifice a Survivor.
---
15% increased difficulty on escape attempts makes it 0.6% more difficult so instead of 4% Survivors get 3.4% base.
---
9% increased penalty to escape fails means Survivors lose an extra 1.8 seconds per failed attempt which is an extra 5.4 seconds removed.
---
Bet you get gem rushed every game fat buba disgrace to the killers
---
I started using it because of Pain Reliever.  I feel it's the best of the exhaustion perks, if only for its passive.
---
While this makes sense on paper, it feels more often like pressuring one survivor takes several off gens. One is on hook, one or two come to rescue, leaving only one or two to work gens.
---
If you have considerable gen slow or even just a ruin they can't push through, that's one more still pulled away to look for totems.
---
Chases against an unhooked survivor are *always* shorter than their fully-healed counterpart, giving you ample time afterwards to pressure the nearby medic and slug out DS. 
---
Worst case scenario, you have two survivors working full time on gens. Even if they crack 2 or 3, bringing the player count down to 3 quickly does so much to slow gen progress. Your next tunnel only leaves 1 free to work on gens as 1 person is dying and the 3rd is playing medic for that person. If you take a second out of the game it's basically GG, as at that point there's essentially no way to work gens and handle chases at the same time.
---
Now I don't play this way as it's unsportsmanlike and disrespectful. I understand that much. But I do see why people play this way, as the deck seems to be stacked really hard in the favor of a killer that takes out a single person as quickly as possible. 
---
inb4 "of course you observe xyz at low rank play" yes maybe so so please enlighten me how do high ranked players get around this "tunnling = win" effect?
---
That happens way too often
---
I used to run spine chill, but not using it makes the game more enjoyable in my opinion
---

Sure, i've given up on lithe with the way hitboxes are around windows.
---
The decision is between dead hard and balanced landing. Balanced landing is map dependent, dead hard is ping dependent. Nothing more infuriating than using dead hard on 160+ms.
---
Thanks.
---
If you as the Killer and 1-3 Survivors want to farm while the others do not then just leave them alone to do Gens &amp; Gates while farming with whoever does.
---
okay boomer
---
But he wants to play basement boy, so he will play basement boy. For him it’s not boring or frustrating cause he likes it, and I respect that.
---
I am the kind of guy who doesn’t care how you play long as no rules are broken, and you can use whatever perks you desire, survivor or killer. Can’t tell me what to do and I can’t tell you what to do.
---
Vigo has fucked EVERYONE in the fog (except the pig)? Damn, he must have gone to great lengths to do that then.
---
SCP-096 is the next killer, confirmed.
---
No, it doesn’t
---
The current detection perks are not strong enough to deal with constant 0 terror radius, so they'd have to buff them. But omce they do that, its no different from the terror radius except that there is no heartbeat or music. It really wouldn't make it feel more like a horror game because you know they're coming anyway.
---
Yeah it sucks for the person on the hook but the main point here is that you already get punished as a killer for a bad play if the survivors react accordingly. If they swarm the hook like bees a flower, then they make the killers strategy work.
---
Absolutely. If you want to rank up with survivor at all you need it!
---
I dont fully agree with that. If you're a lithe player you most likely arent looping the killer through the same vault over and over, and EVERY map has pallets you can drop to trigger lithe on.
---
With a full stack or up to 4? Because its almost worth it to keep the stacks at 4 since everyone blows those skill checks
---
Everyone who doesn’t realize you can’t tell him what to do and it isn’t against the rules to play basement bubba: LoL gIt GuD bAsEmEnT cAmPiNg FuCk Go FuCk YoUrSeLf!
---
Me: while I personally don’t like basement camping, I respect your opinion and ain’t upset by it, good sir!
---
None of those add-ons really make him properly viable. You basically have to run 2x Windstorm for him to be worth playing, in my opinion.
---
Leatherface may have boring add-ons, but he's overall more powerful than Wraith, just by virtue of his insta-down.
---
Blinding the dwight too at the end there. Good play!
---
*starts teabagging*
---
Entity: STOP THAT
---
So good
---
This helps. Explains the nuance of this phenomenon in ways I haven't been able to explain to myself. Thank you.
---
I see a lot of bm in my SWF group about tunneling and facecamping, but you make a good point. Both can be valid strategies to outwit a poorly focused survivor team. We're being played for suckers.
---
I’d say F but I can’t relate aha

"KNOWN ISSUES
---
The End Game Collapse timer is visually desynchronized between clients and host."
---
Dude.. You good?
---
"robs of your game" if you end up being facecamped by me you probably had enough time to have fun in "your game"
---
That’s good to know. I like your ideas btw.
---
Its the cannibal so they will camp you no matter what.
---
True. Been playing plague and getting 3 to 4k (fuck hatches) at rank 4
---
Thanks. Heres some karma
---
U mean 1st hook? Or 2nd hook
---
I didnt know tampons could get sand out of your vagina
---
God, the other day I was playing Spirit and had some dudes milling in the gateway. Flash-stepped in and smacked one of them. Still got away, but it felt amazing.
---
Yup. He was my favourite when I got him, but I just cant play him anymore cuz I cant win most of the time
---
Honestly if I ever run into one survivor out of four who don't want to farm.
---
Typically the main rule I tell them is go do generators but if you cross my path I will treat it like it's a normal game. Granted I want tunnel your fuck I'll let you go and do whatever the heck you're doing then if I see you again off then I'll down you and hook you like normal if you die that's just on you
---
Try plague, I've been using her at rank 4 and having a lot of fun and winning

New update: Teabag = die instantly
---
This is pretty funny. bill has no shame.
---
A vast majority of killer mains are  complete cunts. This is truth.
---
When I find it during a chase I’m always like: Fuck.
---
*laughs in respecting opinions of both sides*
---
It's a general lobby issue, the ranks don't play a role.
---
 That perk symmetry upsets me
---
Wait a second that isn’t a Dead By Daylight
---
Current Objective:
---
SURVIVE
---
Well that's your opinion, but even with wraiths basic tech it's not that hard to shut down a T wall, or a safe pallet loop by body blocking the interaction.  If you're just mindlessly chasing survivors around with wraith you're doing it wrong.
---
Your ears would tell you
---
Not even a little
---
Me:
---
You: No, fuck you
---
Sure, that was just my first match as an example. When I play survivor (usually only with friends), during one of these it is often just Nurse, Billy, Spirit, moris, ultra rare addons, etc.
---
I personally like the schoolgirl outfit w/ the red hair
---
You could see after you escaped the killers grasp the timer went back up a bit that’s so weird
---
Each one gives you 100% more bloodpoints
---
Dwight(50/50 being baby Dwight or jerk Dwight),Claudette, Jake, David and Quentin are the top S/A tier for toxicity in my experience. 
---
Megs try to be, but soooo many make huge mistakes and are often what I call Megamind Megs xD
---
My guess is that someone went to stage 2 on first hook
---
Haha oh shit!! 
---
My bad. 
---
I'll delete this folks  :)
---
I mean you could have escaped but you teabag in front of him in toxicity.
---
Karma I guess.
---
For the most part you're not going to be out running the killer you could try to lose the Killer or waste their time to the point where they stop chasing you.
---
You'll find out that the better the killer is the quicker they'll make the distinction whether it's worth chasing you or not
---
Oi slag no one gives a flyin fuck let a man play his game. Also maybe instead of being an idiot and tryin to save your friends out of basement when you realize they are being camped, maybe you actually do a fucking gen you dumb as fuck p3 “doing gens you?” Claudette player. Play the game how you want OP! No one can stop u ❤️
---
There's no protocol and if they teabag then that's them being teenage dweets and maybe they're ready for the big boy hooks. However if they are in default skins and just doing what they think is protocol I boop them and shake my head at them and leave them slugged. They might get two of those then that's a hookin'.
---
Hey buddy I think you picked the wrong sub
---
What teabag
---
It is blatant
---
I'm getting lots of both. Game is super buggy atm.
---
I just noticed this myself a few days ago. I always laugh after that and think how dumb this actually is :D
---
Certainly not, knowing how much time you have can be vital on when the exit gates need to begin being opened, if you can save someone etc.
---
What movie?
---
Not sure you're in the right place..
---
Haha I did yeah.
---
I'm going to delete  :)
---
Gg well played lol this community falls for bait really easily its kinda hilarious
---
Theresdragons in dbd?
---
"Why'd he go down with just one hit? Oh well, he must have been exposed"
---
I dont recall this killer

discord\_irl

Sweaty Killer Camping Mode!
---
A C T I V A T E
---
I feel the the first part of my kit matches ur idea. The second part of my kit is meant to give him an answer to a lot of thing (double machete to challenge corners and pallets, spike to challenge windows and dropped pallets) but not just tanking shit like nothing. I don’t want to remove fun from survivors
---
r/lostredditors
---
Has this happen to me in a game, except the timer was only like 50% It got 3 of use
---
Bill, Ash, Laurie and David would be the most horrifying survivor squad to go up against as a killer if they were true to the source material lol.
---
No.
---
Dragons in next DLC confirmed!
---
Got lucky this game we farmed and all got 250k+
---
Could you dm me which streamer it is? I think I have an idea of who it could be
---
Wraith as a disowned child makes me sad :c 
---
He just wants to be loved ❤️
---
Skill checks are client side, so it definitely depends on fps
---
Damn!
---
That's some gourmet shit right there!
---
Okay we don't have dragons here buuut how about murder and salt? Can I interest you in murder and salt? We have plenty of that.
---
^^Ha ^^^aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
---
Dude bro man 15 extra seconds on a key is OP! It takes a second to open hatch right? And with that add on you can open the hatch with a skeleton key 45 times! Clearly broken.
---
Yeah, it is the same level. If you t-bag, insta heal, flashlight spam, and loop the killer 15 times then he's gonna be pissed and most likely face camp you. 
---
&gt;then you probably need to git gud or take a break from the game if you get tilted so easily.
---
Tilted so easily? If you get tilted when someone camps you because you were being toxic then YOU need to take a break from the game.
---
I feel this as a Myers main
---
Lancaster?
---
This, window of opportunity is a godsend "training wheels" perk. After using it for a while you will start to memorizze all the best routes in each map to loop (considering someone else didnt already spend the pallets there)
---
I sent it to my brother and he said he sounds like an air raid siren.
---
I think you need to hook every survivor 3 times or get some late hooks and sacrifices to get max bp in sacrifice. If they kill themselves on second hook then you lose the opportunity to get more “hooked” points
---
Actually before they hit you with the knife they flip the knife around and use the handle to apply extreme blunt force trauma upon them. They just wipe the knife to flex.
---
I can't actually recall a clown game where he didn't camp for no reason, also throwing bottles at me constantly
---
Flying over people just burning em no hook needed
---
Love how he deleted the post lmao
---
I’ll take and extra serving of salt please.
---
When you get hit AFTER fast vaulting.
---
Yup, I only realized how bad it can make killers feel when I started playing killer myself. ~~Too bad I only played survivor for the first few hundred hours~~
---
Even with end gate timer.. I, as a Killer, WILL NEVER move to the gate once I know everyone is in it.
---
Pre timer, I'd even sit in the basement for up to 20/30 minutes for people desperately trying to toxic teabag at the gate.
---
Like fuck your points bro, I ain't standing there in a zero win situation to make you feel cool for tea bagging and pointing.
---
Even had one match where three SWF came to me and tried to get in the basement, I just turned my back at the top of the stairs to deny access and idled for 15 before they gave up. You survivors are toxic AF for NO reason.
---
Welcome to the killers life
---
Claudette is the most toxic.
---
The things I do for love.
---
I feel like survivors have an automatic advantage with third person, unless it’s Myers, then he can turn your ass into a jack-o-lantern
---
They're not necessarily rare, it's just that when you factor in map offerings, bloodpoint boosters and items and addons, there are such a high amount that the chance of a green node being a BPS for a survivor is a 1/36 chance of being there compared to the 1/11 for a specific purple on one of those nodes, or a 1/3 for Ultra Rare addons for a survivor.
---
So lets say you have a full bloodweb, and it spawns 2 Pink, 4 Purple, and 9 green nodes, with the rest being yellow and brown.
---
There's a 1/3 chance that the pink for a survivor will be a Syringe. You might find a syringe or two with every single bloodweb.
---
For those 9 green nodes, there is a 1 in 36 chance of it being a BPS. Even less if you have green perks to unlock still. 
---
This applies to killers too, a consistent huntress player will gain a vast amount more Iridescent heads than Bloody Party Streamers, simply because in here bloodwebs, there will almost always be a pink spot or two, and it's either an Ebony Mori or a Iridescent head, compared to the abundance of map offerings and addons that appear in green nodes over BPS.
---
I pressed crouch so you think I was teabagging? Do killers have ptsd or something?
---
I absolutely love Ash vs Evil Dead. Honestly, I think it’s my favourite piece of Evil Dead media- I think it’s even better than the films (which I love, by the way). It balances horror and comedy really well, and whilst its cancellation was a shame, it had a very good run. All three seasons are on US Netflix I believe (I know for sure Season 1 is on UK Netflix, with Season 2 out in a few days now).
---
Ok. I keep that in mind. Thanks.
---
my b thats what i meant
---
They also look very similar. No other killer in the game has so many similarities with other killers.
---
You could have ran right out and didn't.
---
You crouched in an attempt to be toxic and died.
---
Stop being salty for your own toxicity.
---
Are you seriously using survivor add ons and items as a way to justify your tilted behavior? Those are part of the game. Insta heals is ultra rare. Flash lighting is a distraction and it’s your fault if you fall for it. 
---
Standing stock still to ruin someone game because your got tilted is ‘your’ problem. It’s no wonder they had to invent perks (borrowed time and kindred, it seems I gotta help you reach simple conclusions) to serve as an anti-camp for sweaty killers.
---
telling people to "literally kill themselves" and using the R-word.   
---
Really welcoming community you are helping foster here.
---
Disconnect
---
ok boomer
---
Has no dlc killers
---
Dang i dont know what Quentins u r going up against but i try to not be toxic. Unless you consider using meta perks toxic then maybe it is a little valid lol.
---
*leather face chainsaw noises*
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one but sad because everyone's having a hard time
---
Most toxic are those Blendettes in Macmillan. The blend in regardless of what you do. Megs are fine. They don’t do shit and most Neas are wannabe Toxic players that can’t juke nor use flashlight. Nancy(s) are becoming the new flashlight Neas
---
Every time this happens to me someone d/c’s before the game fucking loads
---
Oh shit your right. I demand a prayer beads nerf
---
You all know this is from Halloween 4 right?
---
Maniac Cop or Captain Spaulding would be cool as well
---
The only tierlist I’m perfectly happy seeing Kate at the bottom of. She is a wholesome girl
---
If someone didn't crouch to bm, he would've lived. I don't even feel bad for you
---
Cool idea. I'll mention you in it if I make it
---
Probably better to just make the hag addon reveal all auras near the trap
---
Ash should be S tier
---
dude it was so fun, i can't see how you could think it was "bad" in any way
---
yea
---
You don’t lose offerings when the killer DCs tho
---
Yea i saw that, Haunted should be coming in shrine soon though since it has been a while since it has been in there. It is unfortunate that he cannot get PWYF since that is almost mandatory, but there is still possibility of it being in shrine. Other than that, i would suggest you save up iridescent shards for spirit for bot spirit fury and haunted. And then you can use Spirit fury, Enduring, ruin, BBQ for a simple yet effective build.
---
I am getting Moried, making me the victor.
---
Feng, nancy, steve and david go up to s and we're good
---
Someone put it at 70 again, which is why I’m here. 69 once more, lads
---
 Claudette needs a S++ tier
---
Thank you, kind stranger.
---
I think you may be in the wrong subreddit. Just a thought
---
Because it is the level 30 perk and most level 30 perks are max green rarity. It sucks but eh we get used to it lol.
---
I feel like the only option against a noob is either get the game over with as quick as possible or do what you said and make the game fun for them. Survivors who taunt baby killers disappoint me. Especially when they find out it’s a new player and they prolong the game by not doing gens. I’ve had teammates tell me to not finish gens or open the gate because of this fuckery. “No Kyle, I don’t want to prolong the game so you can shit on a new player all while giggling maniacally and telling everyone an exact play-by-play of what you just did.”
---
in the shop I suppose it is because it might cause some bugs and since now you are buying stuff with real money, they want to avoid that problem.
---
Damn that's smart. I'm gonna add that to my list of really useful strategies that I probably won't remember to do in practice...
---
Kate, Feng, and Dwight need to be higher.
---
Honestly this is my little brother to a T
---
200 IQ
---
Well I learned something today.
---
I fixed the number once more. People must not ruin perfection
---
Don't worry, you aren't missing anything right now lol. 20 minute queue times for killer, and mori games for survivor.
---
Yeah if you're going to ignore gens 99% them for points and then walk your happy ass into the basement.
---
We need anime eyes
---
Ghostface : "King Crimson!"
---
*time skip sounds*
---
Claudette: "NANI!?"
---
I don't play killer to be a survivor punching bag. Most survivors are toxic and deserve it either way.
---
Me too. Only found lobby with &gt;300 ping. From morning to midnight. Rarely see yellow ping lobby
---
A tierlist i can get behind.
---
Thanks, I'll try it out.
---
Summary of the comments here: everyone should be S tier. Jeff players don't exist.
---
Then you should know just standing by the killer watching him watch your teammate die literally rewards the facecamping even more and allows for easier snowball to turn that 1k into a 2k or even 3k
---
Monstrous would make the build better. Less time needed to camp since they die quicker.
---
It does work but you cant smack the survivor and kill them, youll get the option to kill them being right behind them. You can do it but the survi or cant be downed.
---
Yeah, I feel like his design is kinda basic but true to his movie image.
---
Yeah, I don't want to wait 30 minutes to just get a lobby
---
Holy this I'm getting roasted so hard.
---
Perks having differing rarity has no actual purpose anymore. There's no reason to make some perks cost more than others, it's just silly. Maybe if it were based on how good the perks are, but it's not.
---
Oh thanks! I didn’t know that.
---
Kinda wasted my addon now but good to know.
---
Adorable.
---
This. Also you should not use tombstone piece but instead use Judith’s tombstone (the ultra rare version) since tombstone piece kicks you out of t3 after one kill.
---
I mean it does say
---
&gt;Note: Tombstone Piece does not stack with Fragrant Tuft of Hair.
---
I guess no one would be using the tombstone otherwise.
---
Borrowed time radio.
---
That's a lot of text and cbf to read it all but
---
&gt; QoL features (quick switch, upgrading post-match (but only for survivors for some fucking reason!)) removed for no reason.
---
You can upgrade before the match.
---
Quick switch removal had a reason - premade lobbys.
---
&gt;SWF groups shitting up the game and making it an unplayable, unfun mess even more than it used to be, since they rolled it into the survivor side and let you stick with your group after a round now.
---
SWF keeps this game alive, also removing features that should have been in to begin with is stupid.
---
&gt; Killers being able to ragequit and it not only keeps you from getting points, but you also lose your items. That's fair, right?
---
Can't be fixed till dedicated servers.
---
Who is that and why do I keep seeing her in memes
---
Look up "press f to pay respects"
---
Where does it say that?
---
On the PS4 it just says what it does and that it stacks.
---
This, you can't just pretend losing is fun because you like the killer so much
---
Have you ever seen a Kate with a flashlight?
---
I just love when I am getting fast downs and following bbq auras and always hook different people in succession, but still get DSed because the timer is so fucking long. They could double the timer if they wanted as long as it goes away when you hook someone else...
---
DAMN BRO. F
---
Yea but if you use tuft does it kick you out still ive never tried
---
Who care how fast they die. It doesn’t make it more fun to play. You have a boring play style.
---
It is basic, but that’s what makes Michael so terrifying than other slashers. He’s simple and theoretically, anyone could put on that boiler suit and plain white mask with a knife, he could be anyone. ((That’s How it is in the first film Ofcourse, the rest except 2018 he basically becomes Jason Voorhees in blue))
---
But doesn’t using tuft hair counter that? 
---
Fragrant Tuft of Hair allows you to have an unlimited duration of EW3 combining that with Tombstone piece would be better than Judith’s.
---
(Because judith’s make you slower)
---
That’s how I was thinking, but it’s not the case then?
---
It's actually dumb, it allows for easy face camps as Freddy with no counter perk and as someone mentioned even if you do get the BT off you will still go down easily as you won't be in his TR and your deep wounds will go down even when he's chasing you. Not really sure why they gave Freddy this change
---
That wouldnt do anything for you. A chase starts as soon as a survivor is running from the killer. So you just step into his los and run away you will get the points and a successful chase.
---
This was me my first game after equipping it to try it out. I didn't know what button it would be and then when the prompt showed up I got too excited and missed.
---
Yes it does.
---
I reject this belief that we are all toxic
---
I think he's one of the best killers in terms of design because of how much certain add ons like scratched mirror, and tombstone piece can radically change the way the match turns out.  Even the add on Dead Rabbit with the perk Monitor and Abuse can be just added into your build for a 4 meter terror radius on phase two michael.  
---
My only complaint about mikey is his teachables.  Not a huge fan of them outside of specific builds on killers.
---
They fixed the internet thing when demogorgon came out I think.
---
Tombstone piece still kicks you out with tuft
---
How so? Honest question.
---
I tried Palgue for the first time yesterday and did horrible; when usually my Shape games are 3K-4K.
---
No tombstone piece trumps tuft of hair. That build requires double ultra rares to work.
---
Try playing other survivors and look at their cosmetics, maybe you will like them more.
---
In my opinion claudette doesnt have that many good cosmetics
---
One of the chests in the map contains a gun which can be used to reenact Amanda’s death, granting all survivors still in the game an automatic win
---
It means "I'm not original, so here's an overdone joke"
---
It's almost as lame as running to a video game subreddit and seeking attention because some chick won't give up the snizz.
---
An edgy teenager
---
She looks like a lost granny
---
wholesome post
---
So you’re saying the tombstone won’t work with tuft of hair?
---
I’m gonna try it when I get it again.
---
if your not having fun dc all you want
---
I had the chance to do this yesterday, but I didn't have a trap.
---
I think it’s fine as it is, but if I were to change it I would only add the scream when it gets cleansed.
---
But Trapper is daddy.
---
I think they all spawned pretty close to each other so she was able to easily patrol them
---
That is pretty smart, but it must be tricky to catch a good Survivor group with that build
---
Adorable
---
Hex has a downside they’re balanced. Plus you can still do generators fast with Ruin active.
---
People who put an Ebony Mori instead of the BPS: Oh, you're a villain, alright. Just not a super one.
---
I thought you couldn't but the other day one surv escaped with a trap attached in one of my games.
---
I have no idea how it works.
---
That is what I said. Maybe I worded it in a confusing way. Sorry!
---
Going against Spirit is always annoying but those hexes together barely does anything. Cleanse them while the Spirit is chasing someone.
---
And if we are talking viability I am still having 3-4ks even at red ranks. I have really yet to have a “bad game” because even if Legion is down to their basics, sometimes that’s all you need to secure victory. Especially with the new Dying Light Build I use, I don’t make escaping easy and teams fall apart after their last few gens. 
---
Would I like to see them get some QoL buffs and addon touchup? Of course. But I can do well with what I have now.
---
no, it is also good way to tell others the killer is camping you or at least near.
---
hOw DaRe YoU!

Known bug, there is a slight desync with the timer between killers and survivors. Best to get out asap in future
---
Am I wrong? If so, please educate me with something that puts legion over clown.
---
It's a bug, the timer is visually showing more time than there is, works fine on killer side I believe but it's broken for survivors
---
Ultra rare and iridescent is the same thing tho
---
Everyone knows the mask backstory ((atleast I hope everyone does by now)) But I legitimately didn’t know the original theme was based on another jingle! ((Even though John Carpenter didn’t really know how to write a musical note at the time))
---
What was the original jingle?
---
Like another already said it’s for the bloody clothing which is fine. I like the clothes. I just don’t get why people complain about not having bbq, ruin, dead hard, balanced landing, etc. when they themselves prioritize the cosmetics over their own loadout. I feel like people saying that they’re “unlucky” with rng has become so common it’s just kind of a thing to fall back on if they’re not handed everything they want when they think they deserve it. There’s a bit of entitlement or maybe just ignorance showing when someone constantly blames rng for not having the perks they want but at the same time happily hits prestige and resets all the perks back to their bloodweb.
---
They were a bit OP which is why they spent the past year nerfing them lol.  They aren't anymore.  All the broken cheese was removed from the game.  Playing killer has never been easier than it is right now and no survivors are not the power role at this point the killer is.  It takes an incredibly skilled, coordinated swf group to challenge that.  Again if you feel this powerless still the fault lies in your own play not the games balance.  There isn't much more they can give us without the game feeling unfair for solo players.
---
Otz is amazing and it's no joke you still sound like a babysurvivor he can help you out.  He routinely smashes great groups running all manner of killer most of the time without so much as Ruin.  He has plenty to teach beginner and advanced players and you definitely fall in the former category based on your views of the game.  Give him a chance and try to learn how to play better.  The game becomes more fun once you know what to do as killer.

He is just guarding you so your friends get all the Objective points, good guy Bubba
---
Ikr. Hard to convince your friends to play lobby simulator 2019 :/
---
I only play Michael for fun because I really enjoy him. I don't worry about 4ks, if I get it great if not it's fine. If it's a good group with that build it can be tricky, if it's not a great group most the time they either get use to the terror radius and ignore it or they panic and hide a lot.
---
Even if you find people, you can still easily loop the killer for 60 seconds. The extra stuff I added isn’t even that big of a difference as well. Many survivors can still loop a Michael at tier 3 with enduring, brutal strength, and bamboozle.
---
Depends on his add-ons and how close you were to him. Default is within 32m to reveal but with addons iirc you can knock it down to around 12-16m
---
Even without NOED, real Chads come to give them a parting gift. And get a few extra blood points, too.
---
That's true but it's hard to when she patrols the map. that is how we were able to get 1 gen done but at the cost of my friend😂
---
If matchmaking worked better they could use an average system
---
He doesn't force slow vaults anymore though...
---
HOLY [FUCK](/intensifies) I HATE PLAYING AGAINST ADRENALINE SO GODDAMN MUCH.
---
What a douche lol
---
It seems like a shock and awe tactic, it’s still smart though.
---
I'm surprised she didnt dc. Assholes who tbag at the exit like to dc whenever it gets then killed or they get outplayed.
---
If I’m going down then you’re coming with me
---
If this is being toxic then killer who face camp are cancer.
---
More worried about making a dull game for the others lol.
---
The first one is overpowerd, gen rushing is already a problem and is the reason why hex ruin is mandatory on every build nowadays. The second one is fine if a  little usseless compared to something like deliverance and the third one would make unbreakable and no mither completely useless
---
I think the exorcist bell theme? But it's different enough that it dosent really matter 👌
---
So
---
Survivors always escape is what you support?
---
Bug... but should teach you a lesson to GTFO instead of sticking around to troll.
---
Oh yea Legions add-ons are horrible, but the devs already confirmed they are looking to change the pins to be on the 1st frenzy hit instead of the 2nd.
---
Outside of the button and the duration add-ons no other add-on is worth it.
---
Thank you! And I'll check out the perk too!
---
r/emojipolice
---
Perfect. Thank you!
---
Not even kidding we would start to cleanse when she was after someone but would stop the chase to get us on the totem
---
With how this sub talks, you’d think everyone posting is Rank 1.
---
r/EmojiSquad 😎😎🎖🎖🎖😎😎😎😎😎
---
Your comment has been removed from /r/deadbydaylight for the following reason(s);
---
That’s REALLY interesting. I never heard that before and I thought I researched the original flick to a fault. 
---
Btw, the original film is so timeless, just talking about it makes me feel cozy.
---
Exactly! It’s literally like, “Oh, you fuckers wanna do that do you? Fine by me.” Combo it with NOED and it’s the perfect counter so long as the full totems aren’t cleansed.
---
THE WORST IS WHEN THEY DO IT KNOWING THEY'RE ABOUT TO GET THIRD HOOKED ANYWAYS BUT JUST FARM YOU FOR THE EXTRA BP AND PUT YOU ON THIRD HOOK AS WELL.
---
i mean its not THAT worthless. it isnt is very great add on but its something. i mean having your teammates aura revealed forever with no range is decent.
---
No, I wouldn't ruin such perfection. We have a traitor! :O.
---
This happened to me the other day and scared the fuck out of my swf party
---
i literally lost brain cells reading this and i didnt even have any
---
restarted the game app the internet everything the problem seems to be on sony side
---
As a Feng main, I don't usually see a lot of other toxic Fengs...... I've only really seen toxic Claudettes.
---
because he's literally a M1 killer that his power doesn't help pressuring the survivors at all
---
I hate everyone who plays this fucking stupid game
---
Oh I just remembered.
---
The theme was inspired by the song/jingle "London Bridge is falling down"
---
I was mad when I found out it wasn't an original idea, but fuck it. At least JC modified it a bit to sound dope.
---
You guys really should watch this one documentary about Myers/Halloween
---
(Im not sure which doc I heard it from...maybe the 1st one)
---
https://youtu.be/lXtPgnuL330
---
https://youtu.be/xwT2Wqfa3mk
---
I use myers a lot, he has a few add-ons that grant extra bloodpoints in brutality . He's fun to play
---
It’s been the universal camper signal for as long as I can remember
---
Yeah after seeing Steve getting bummed by a demagorgan I had sit down quietly and stare at a wall .....
---
I’m pretty new and bad and when survivors teabag me and just make me a laughing stock, I always wish there was a killer who was just a guy with a gun. Or predator.
---
Legion is the best point farming killer by far but he is kinda weak so if your trying to rank up while getting points I’d recommend Freddy
---
Megal Myers.
---
I’m on mobile atm so I can’t send it
---
Worcestershire
---
All right, thanks!
---
Is Myers the only killer can mori survivor at the exit gate?
---
oh boy wallhacks time
---
Same experience here, as if the player balance has shifted. As a killer I wait +5 minutes, as a suvivor only ~ 1 minute right now
---
Must be annoying to have any sort of disease and listen to kids compare it to mild inconveniences.
---
Horrible advice dude.  Please don't prematurely destroy our Jungle Gyms so you can cheese a Lithe Proc.  Respect Jungle Gyms and keep them in tact as long as possible.  Another reason not to run Lithe if it causes players to waste pallets to use it.
---
But then it turns out the survivor is in an swf and the other surv breaks the ruin
---
I think it’s more impressive that he took that simple rhythm and changed into one of the most Iconic themes EVER. And you are right, I can definitely here the theme with the rhyme, but it actually made me smile rather than piss me off
---
Distressing isn't good because it just helps you hit the cap faster and it's relatively easy to hit the 8k with doctor without it.  I'd swap it with sloppy butcher or make your choice.  Otherwise it's a very solid doc build my man.  
---
The other problem with distressing on doc is that it makes it easy for survivors to get to tier one while you're already in an active chase.  You don't want the entire team to get their initial scream out of the way in the beginning of the round.  
---
For add ons I'd suggest the one that increases the madness gain per shock and then a brown range extender for more length while still having a charge time that makes it viable to cancel vaults/pallets with.  You can still do it with all tiers of range, I just find it being easier with the faster charge and a little extra reach.
---
She’s Greta Thunberg, a 16 year old Swedish environmental activist
---
But for real though if you think you are “bad”, as an fairly experienced killer I could give you some pointers or show you some good tutorials! If you are interested just send me a pm.
---
Did the money leave your bank account?
---
I died because I couldn't self heal.
---
i legit ran the killer for 4 gens yesterday
---
and then they just stopped doing them 
---
he got a 4k
---
I've been having problems with the game getting stuck while searching for a match. It says cannot connect to host then something else about host then gets stuck on connecting while I'm unable to back out or cancel
---
Wow, look, someone who can't take a joke.
---
There is nothing speacial about that build...
---
glorious xDDD
---
I read the first part of the sentence and thought "why'd dude get downvoted 26 times, he seems reasonable." 
---
I read the second part, and understand.
---
Haha. No
---
Quentin looks so much like Smeagol in this picture
---
Clown is slow AF, both his movement and his bottle throwing.
---
Hey man sounds dope! It’s hard to think about what would give the killer away besides him transforming and his inability to do gens but I’m excited to see what you come up with
---
Because they are crouching around watching.
---
He wants his extra blood point, but he wants to earn em
---
Oh ok
---
Have you ever played spirit?
---
Clown is like the other M1 killers. Basically if survivors don’t loop pallets they’re fucked. If a survivor just keeps throwing pallets early or when the killer gets to it and just waits there for the killer to attempt to break it then they can’t do shit. Especially Pig as her ability is golden for loops but people don’t loop her.
---
Oh that's so sad :(
---
Lovly
---
Yea I feel like something with matchmaking is bored. Playing survivor? Less than 3 minutes and I'm in a full lobby. Playing Killer? 10 minutes before I'm put in a lobby by myself and survivors trickle in.
---
Trust me plenty of killer mains would call you trash too.  Players on both sides that know what they're doing frown on your rank 20 antics equally.
---
BBQ was in the shrine last month you’ll be waiting ages for it and losing double XP every match you don’t use it.
---
Stuttering mainly, ping doesn't affect skill checks
---
It’s a bug. It will be fixed. You don’t need to make a post out of it.
---
i only read the bold one :/  
---
remember this man : game was made to have fun, if you not feel like fun at all and only make you depress or stress out, better leave the game. choose the game you enjoy the most will make you happier IRL too. game was made to be fun. well no one can blame since competitive game will be there a winner and loser. and of course experience lose is not fun as winning. but if you cannot accept the lose, i think you not fit to play competitive game. you can try another enjoyable game for your own good
---
gotta get them deviousness points
---
And that is why nobody likes play with a swf
---
It'll be fixed. Let us enjoy our Karmic Retribution while it lasts
---
Although perks effecting the Endgame Collapse would be nice
---
Well in that scenario it doesn't matter what killer you play.
---
Well that's awful to hear. Guess I gotta tune down my graphics...
---
It's a meme, just laugh and dont take it serious.
---
But if you want it to be serious, I run make lobbies great again so I have constant info on all player's ping. Which helps know if a survivor is experiencing heavy lag or if a killer is possibly lag switching. So lag isn't a reason I've run into.
---
The main reasons I found for why people kill themselves on hook are:
---
Made a stupid mistake and they want to move onto the next game, disregarding their team and the loss they feed them. 
---
They see that the killer is snowballing to a point where the game is almost unwinnable.
---
That's what we call karma
---
Seems legit xD
---
Fragrant tuft of hair - gives Evil Within 3 unlimited duration (at the cost of +10  evil to get from 2 to 3)
---
And I forget the name of the other thing but I'm pretty sure it's used to reduce the evil it takes to get to Evil Within 3, which pairs nicely with the tuft of hair
---
PREACH
---
Just do gens through ruin and all of the sudden Spirit only only has one perk for the entire game.
---
many survivor wont open the gate until dying survivor got hooked or escape from hook
---
Biker for sure!
---
Okay but it’s crazy how it’s completely counter-able by just not being a dick
---
45 minutes, what server are you playing on? It takes 2-3 minutes for me at all times of the day and night on PC.
---
Same
---
Haunted Ground is fine, no need for a needless buff.
---
So do the survivors still get the full time (2 min?) or does the timer for them just burn slower or something visually?
---
When you run straight at the window but still get a medium vault
---
It happened to me today. I had to look at what the killer had to make sure.
---
Swap haunted for huntresses lullaby.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Yeah but since it's a CONCEPT and since they still will have to pick locations for each map, the problem is solved
---
OH
---
Is this a perk?  An exploit?  A feature?  This happened to me and my team the other night, the meter was like half full and suddenly we all just got impaled.  We werent being toxic, we were just trying to save somebody and get out lol.
---
BEAUTIFUL!!!!!
---
Why does this happen though??
---
Biker Kate all the way. She’s the sexiest survivor now.
---
Ruin, Nurses, Sloppy and Thanataphobia/Enduring/Overcharge for the 4th would work.
---
Hey what is this it happened to me yesterday I wasn’t even staying in the exit gate for a long time I had like 10 secs left and opened the gate and tried to exit and just fucking died
---
its nightmare fuel...
---
No it's not.
---
Sometimes you just don't get out till the very end of the timer. Like when the killer knows your injured so they camp the exit, you have to run around to the other exit and escape that way.
---
Or when team mates are hooked and the gates are already opened but you go save them.
---
Implying the only people who have close escapes are people being dicks is dumb asf.
---
“Shitty killers”
---
It’s a competitive game, if they do something shitty it’s usually just normal play. You lose because they denied you a win and you justify it as they are being “Insert insult here” Trust me, I know this all to well. I hate myself every time I get mad at video games.
---
You tried and succeed
---
A joke: what do you get when you cross an owl with a bungee cord?
---
-moment of silence 
---
My Ass
---
*Everyone laughs*
---
I think this is an interesting idea could you maybe explain more about it?
---
its rate 1 : 4 . so you must finding 4x times or longer than survivor need
---
They run Borrowed time and DS, and stick to gens like glue. They're also pretty good at looping so the guy you're tunneling will take you for a whole-game long tour and will also escape.
---
Because they feel the need to tell other people how to play the game?
---
I mean most of the second generation do look inbred so probably so
---
Yeah he's the reason I started playing killer before blood hunt started. The shack trap strat is super effective.
---
Why would you ever mention that? The nightmares...
---
Yeah I've seen the dude on here repeatedly defending survivor BM.  I think he used to attend the Church of Ochido.  Very sad.
---
You gotta to admit that would of been an 2000 iq play though.
---
One rework for every member of the legion
---
* Do not post flamebait or troll other users.
---
GOD I NEED THAT
---
Yeah, just had a 5-10 min wait as killer...
---
Takes me 10-15 on average at rank 8, its a pain tbh
---
To be fair, 90% of the time they could of just left to avoid being killed so it is 100% their fault.
---
I don’t recall the exact ranks, but I know that one might be red. I’m the lowest at a rank 17. I don’t play as much as the rest of them, but you think that might be part of it?
---
Did you play solo or with a SWF team?
---
My b, Very rare
---
Lmao. As a killer I run a toxic looking spirit and watch the first 2 DC right after their first hook, and then farm the last 2.
---
Is it just me or do I get the shittest teammates
---
and then when Im killer I have to go against try hards. Like FFS fix the matchmaking
---
I think it's funny as hell. I'll miss it when it's gone.
---
Haha. I'm sorry. I'l lower the volume next time i post
---
While on this topic, anyone on ps4 just always get teammates that don’t do gens? I went from rank 16-6 in the past week and my teammates still don’t do shit. 
---
Most my games I solo 2 gens and that’s all that gets done the entire game. I run bond and just see useless clauds or neas crouching around with urban the entire game doing nothing. It’s making playing survivor extremely frustrating.
---
Also when I play killer gens get slammed down in 4 minutes but I just assume they aren’t solo queue like me.
---
By toxic looking, I mean triple hex totems with Thrill of the Hunt. Im not camping or tunneling though. They usually just freak out at the sight of Spirit
---
Ive had this happen aswell its dumb
---
OH!
---
If you don't have time to run to the other exit then you don't have time to run to the other exit, the broken timer won't change that.
---
1000 Bloodpoints less just for the ability to use aura reading which, let's be honest; no one does.
---
Close escapes are not as common as you make them out to be.
---
Most of the time it´s just people being dicks.
---
This wasnt scary movie or cabin in the woods. If they were trying to take that approach they should of been more obvious, because in that case the only horror movie thing they were mocking is the annoying teens, and they did a pretty shit job at showing that. The rest of the movie was just a comedy horror
---
How I see it, it wasnt a joke of horror movie characters and one of those shitty boomer jokes you see in newspapers like "look at these kids addicted to their damn phones", and was mocking them for it.
---
Maybe this is my problem. As a killer, I usually search for like 30 seconds and stop searching if I cant find a game. Im just not used to it taking long with other games or as a Survivor.
---
Imagine being such trash you think keys need to be deleted.
---
10... 9... 8... 7... 6.. a fuck die..

---
Run Franklin's then? Especially if all 4 are queued up with items in pregame lobby.
---
I enjoy playing Pig *when things go well*. But it's much easier for *things to go well* while playing Spirit, Billy, Myers, even Hag.
---
I'd let him escape if he pulled that shit on me
---
Hands down.
---
Yeah I like his stream but sometimes but he is so inconsistent criticizing something then actually doing it himself 🤔
---
Yeah. It's almost like they should balance out the BP so that survivors get more.
---
Even when I solo queue there are so many issues, like I start loading into a match lobby only to end up loading into the waiting lobby again. Or just “unknown error” pops up.
---
I usually do shit like that with her and get everyone good and pissed. Then i down them for their last hook and let them farm if they are willing. I've watched people turn from salty to giddy really fast
---
Same things happened to me in [this](https://youtu.be/03hK5N41TjM) game. 
---
The odd part is seeing the timer first jump forward on mine and then just plummet to zero.
---
They were going to the meeting duh
---
2k is still considered a killer win tho
---
Well yes, but you can sort of hold the game hostage in a way, if you find a healthy survivor and hit them, 9/10 times they will open the gates.
---
I think it's adorable!
---
No problem!
---
Is that a Grenade launcher from fallout new Vegas?
---
Disconnecting is a escape
---
Nah choose this add ons with a green key: milky glass and weaved ring
---
Rank 4 &amp; rank 20. Nice
---
[https://i.imgur.com/9aJeWxK.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/9aJeWxK.jpg)
---
Because there are just better perks that help throughout the game while both NOED and bloodwarden are inconsistent and are both able to be played around.
---
Now that's what I call a pretty good job so far
---

---
No, blood warden has conditions and a perk, I'm talking about a new mechanic that can still work with blood warden. I expected someone to reply BW cause this sub doesn't consider that this game is bare bones as fuck without perks
---
Bro, together we‘re unstoppable. Killers will fear us far and wide!
---
if you make a clean escape off of a pallet drop, it's not a wasted pallet.
---
Keys are a free escape you dummy. It has nothing to do with being bad you dumbass slut.
---
On console u tap on second so i got confused
---
You do know what tunneling is, right?
---
You have to be the last survivor alive, and fix the last generator &amp; escape through the gate.
---
I stopped playing almost completely other than an occiasional swf. Low rank solo survivor is actually one of the circles of hell, and playing low rank killer meant I was almost guaranteed multiple rank 8+ survivors because of how swf did mm.
---
After the matchmaking change I've done nothing but play killer. I don't always get a 4k but I never feel like I got blown out by someone leagues better than me when I lose.
---
THE BABY HUNTRESS OH MY GOD THATS ADORABLE
---
You’re the reason we’re all going to die.... fucking hell...
---
Yeah to be fair even if here in the UK (We contribute 1/20 of what China does to pollution) if we made a massive effort and turned everything around nothing would change. Idk why this needs to be said : China and India need to be held accountable and sanctioned before we make our own individual efforts
---
But you can’t do that anymore thats why i’m asking
---
They let us know briefly in the patch notes for the demo buff, it should’ve been front and center though, as a “hey, don’t fuck around at the gate rn, shit’s broke”
---
I love how well he's translated in-game. His very *existence* alone ramps up the tension of the early game even (or maybe especially) as a Spine Chill user.
---
I just love how they made an action as innocuous as *looking* feel so pants-shittingly urgent to get away and take line-of-sight from due to the mechanics of Evil Within. He's one of the best-designed killers as far as how well his thematics intertwine with his gameplay.
---
I believe it's modelled from the China Lake in Payday.
---
That’s exactly what I did.
---
I wouldn't say their selfish lol, there's a million potential reasons why they weren't burnt in your particular game
---
You’re the kind of trash that sends hate mail to anyone who beats them on DBD.
---
This happened to me too it scared me tbh
---
Proof behavior has been fuckin brain dead
---
Dwight is Op, and u rank him the worst one.
---
confused by the question tbh. if you purchased it from the shrine, you just have to level up the survivor until it appears in their blood web. if you just purchased laurie, you will need to level her up until you get the orange teachable for the perk. once you have that, you can find it in other webs. hope this helped.
---
I thought it was hilarious
---
Ahh totem yoinking spirit, fun times 😂
---
My issue on this is I don't know how the whole switch mechanic is gonna effect moment to moment gameplay
---
Entity needs a tampon badly
---
This was clipped from my youtube video "The Switch Experience"  
---
[https://youtu.be/WXgpW\_I0G9k](https://youtu.be/WXgpW_I0G9k)
---
But I need EVERY LAST PALLET you see, because I don't know how to use pallets efficiently and don't understand how in the remote fuck escaping a killer benefits our team at all, nope, no sir-ee.
---
No. Don't listen to anyone that says otherwise. They just bad survivors themselves. You can camp, tunnel as much as you want. It's not against the rules.
---
Last I checked, 2k is considered a draw.
---
And I certainly checked a week ago.
---
It's a desync problem between the survivors and the killer
---
That, my friend, I cannot tell you. I suppose its to prevent further bm from the killer, or make rancor less powerful, as its downside is supposed to be "the obsession sees your aura each time a generator is finished", which could be cut into only happening twice and then just give you a free mori. But your guess is as good as mine :)
---
*Survivors insert personal attacks and tell you to go kill yourself like usual*
---
Yeah but honestly killer is a hit or miss all depends how quick you can get downs &amp; use your perks at 100 effectiveness. Survivors are very reliant on others &amp; don't run killers effectively enough. So its 50/50 for me
---
also seems to obliterate freddy after the change he received since if a survivor is asleep, freddy basically doesn't have a terror radius anymore
---
which reminds me that i can't wait until the devs add the undetectable status to stealth killers
---
His abilty is only good for getting rid of pallets but it’s not a free hit so it’s not that good
---
Shshshlshslshlshl
---
[this](https://imgur.com/gallery/R7y7Nt8) was my take on it from a while back, mines based off the rob zombie Halloween movies hence why the variant has a hole in it.
---
The prove thyself with the toolbox dick fucking kills me.
---
Oblivious has fixed this issue for stealth killer like Ghostface. 
---
Not all survivors who run OoO are good enough to run you. Just saying, quite a few are overly cocky potato’s.
---
I believe Myers is the only killer with the add-on that enables him to Mori survivors at Tier 3. So it's not necessarilly that he's the only one that can mori at the exit gate. Normally, there is an offering that enables you to mori (one with the skull-like icon), but you have to have hooked that survivor at least once. While Myers with that add-on, can mori without even hooking anyone.
---
best thing about this rework is 
---
S U S I E D U B S T E P
---
I will enjoy
---
Doggy doo doo made me smile. You win.
---
secret 50% off end game timer. I can go with this
---
True Ghost Faces teabags back at the Ooo USERS.
---
Is this 128x128???
---
Usually experienced killers don't chase the one and the same survivor for the whole game because it's simply inefficient, they know when to switch targets and when to patrol. The thumb of the rule is - if you're chasing the same dude for so much time that several gens were fixed, you were just wasting time
---
Teachable perks will always appear until purchased but that's referring to the orange perks to unlock the perk for all characters,
---
once you buy a teachable either on a shrine or at level 30/35/40 it will just be added to the pool for other characters to find in their bloodweb, has an equal chance to spawn as any other unlocked perk
---
I chose that since her mixtape description is "Fast paced beats"
---
Exactly get out of my house when the door is open LOL
---
The one time I bought BPS I got found first by a nurse who hooked me first.
---
She then came back and tunneled me off hook and got hit by DS.
---
She then continue to chase me, downed me again and got pallet stunned when picking me up.
---
She then continued, again and got me only for me to wiggle free.
---
She then got me and put me on the hook, 4 gens later.
---
I'm done bringing BPS x)
---
True. One thing to fix this broken shit is to make ALL stealth abilities apply Undetectable effect.  
---
My biggest fear is that devs will say they won't do this because perk is balanced
---
after the last generator is done, it grants killer to one shot down a Obsessed survivor and mori them for free, essentially
---
This idea would he cool if you could control which member you could switch to. Also, that Joey switch is rediculous.
---
Guys endgame collapse doesn't prevent this achievement as long as the killer doesn't close the hatch
---
there better be a shirtless myers minecraft skin on my desk tomorrow
---
I’m not a good looper. I would say average to below average but I had one the other might where I looped for what seemed like 2 minutes and within that time only 1 gen was done. I was pretty pissed.

Oh shit im sorry.

As a huntress main I’m just cumming every time  I hit those cocky lads from the distance
---
Well yeah, survivor mains hate everything that isnt a direct nerd to killers or buff to survivors. How dare we make a mechanic to counter toxicity and gate gamping.
---
points is a non-toxic reason, it just comes across as toxic. I always sit at an exit, not to be toxic, but because I want to maximum points, so getting "chased" and hit, and sometimes healing, at the gate are all easy points.

It's called hyperbole my guy.

No Mither alone was already overkill.
---
Sounds like you just suck at breaking a loop and want an ez game
---
Absolutely. It feels like the possibility of victory is always within your control even in the absence of Hex: Ruin. Loops become a fun mini-game, her mobility is incredible (and on a personal note, I love her glass sound effects).
---
There's a feeling of powerlessness with other killers that doesn't exist with Spirit. She's not forced to eat certain pallets or windows, and her gameplay is all the better for it.
---
I don’t care about depips, so I won’t bat an eye other than “ya coulda gotten away with us, my friend!”

**that and if I get the most unlucky early game hooks I just off myself there because I know I won’t get anywhere now**
---
Feng belongs in s, dwight in A
---
r/imreallysorryjon would like to have a word with you
---
What? That’s the ancestor from darkest dungeon,
---
killers wouldn't wait forever anymore because more people would play survivors rather than killer, this equalizing the queue times.
---
Every....... Single....... Game
---
Getting tired of it to be honest
---
Sure seems like it. I’m actually surprised when I don’t see hex ruin in a game when I’m working on gen.
---
Do you think its too strong?
---
I disagree, many times when using it you might not even find a survivor as many will just become immersed for 60 seconds. Additionally, survivors can also just go to strong buildings so they can never be hit, or loop you for too long and you only get 1 down with it. It also may never even activate because some survivors will know if there is no hex perk and so they will never cleanse it.
---
it’s called being bad because you can’t get kills without using spirit or nurse, appearently
---
It's not even really a joke at this point.
---
It's become part of the social lexicon of online games. Most people who interact in the communities of online games will know what you mean by just typing F. In a lot of cases it is used in more lighthearted contexts, but it does get 
---
It's actually a fascinating phenomenon to study, because usually it's slang that this happens to (leet, noob, etc), or an acronym (lfg, pst, etc), but it's very uncommon for just a single letter to gain such widespread understanding of an implied meaning, especially in such situations where that letter was just randomly assigned.

---
You see, Bill had a very interesting adventure last night...
---
Spoiler dude
---
No? It's well known that survivors&gt;killers other than nurse and spirit. So many broken loops in the game.
---
This happened to me with a demogorgon. We did a 3 man dive to save the hooked dude, I started teabagging at a weird angle and he shredded me but I wasn't able to crawl away.
---
Only if you do it a certain way.
---
(Unplug the router)
---
Ok, I edited the first two, are they any better? Sorry if the edits also suck.
---
However the 3rd seems fine to me as it is. You'd have to fix at least 60% of a gen without stopping. This means that if you failed any skill checks or the killer found you, the gen would be rendered fairly useless. Also if other gens are already fixed, you can't get tokens off them. It rewards team coordination if you wish to get maximum tokens, and a careful playstyle for fixing the gens far from the killer.
---
it’s not too strong per say, survivors are. killers need things to counter gen rush. but it’s incredibly hard to balance something like this as to not extremely tilt it in favor of one side.
---
When i play killer and someone has flashlight they know how to use it.When i play survivor and someone has flashlight they suck.

Looks to me like you deserved that.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/da4f0l/love_the_new_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Maybe in green/brown ranks
---
But if you're letting survivors complete 5 gens in those ranks you got other issues
---
The grammar on Hex: Bloodletting is abhorrent; fnaf doesn't even belong anywhere near this game.
---
If they aren't within terror radius already, just leave. I used to wait to give last hit but it's far more frustrating to have them not leave unless I'm already there.
---
Wait, what is the size of Mike's terror radius with dead rabbit and M&amp;A? 4m?? I've been wondering why people sometimes make mistakes that would of been prevented otherwise when I run those
---
Definitely! I threw together a [concept video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL-M3DidVKs) a while back with a couple songs for the different killers, and it was pretty fun to watch and imagine. 
---
The Demogorgon having it's own chase/TR theme really gives me hope that we'll get some for the other killers in a future update.
---
Yeah. I had the generator almost done before the last survivor died. Finished it before the hatch was closed.
---
an easy fix for both moris can only be used on last hook and keys can only let the holder out. that way if 4 survivors show up with keys and you ready up as killer anyway that is your own fault
---
The timer is a factor in your decision making.
---
It's supposed to be information the game provides you to help make decisions - Except right now it's not doing that correctly.
---
ah yes this pleases me
---
True, us Nancy mains just want our totems and to get out.
---
Literally the reason Ghostface is here, I wouldn’t see him coming any other way!
---
how do you keep 2 people in the basement till end game collapse?
---
I'm curious, did the team three gen themselves? Comeback potential for killer is usually higher during 3 gen situations.
---
I’ve seen games when killers get bullied. definitely understand what you are sayin though about balancing.
---
That llama knows what you are doing and is afraid for you.
---
Yeah even when I play killer I see more Dwights and Fengs being assholes than Meg by FAR. Nea is the top though. Always Nea. When I'm surv it's Nea, Feng, and Claudette. I rarely see anyone else acting like a shitbrick.
---
I wonder if it was like 50% of gens are impacted by ruin would help.
---
No, but you are a jackass for feeling the need to kick someone while they're feeling down. There was literally no reason for you to make a comment at all. You could have just seen it and said nothing and continued on, but I guess on the internet every asshole with a keyboard feels like their voice needs to be heard.
---
Nice tracking job!
---
What did the fella say?
---
Woah zenyatta has "Overconfidence is a flimsy shield" 
---
And thought that you were playing off that. My bad
---
One person goes for the unhook and you stand on top of the stairs and don't leave until the other Survivors open the gate. Bodyblock the Survivors so they can't escape and force the Entity to take them.
---
That's what hostage taking is and it's bannable.
---
God, I know, right? And it always seems that I can never find the damn totem when it’s noed or ruin, neither can my teammates, and I want to die. 
---
They’re not even like OP considering you can actively get rid of them, but it’s like whenever a killer has them for me, I just can’t cleanse them. And I try to look but I don’t want to waste the whole match looking for the totem.
---
If we remove everything that's mostly used for being a dick then crouching would be the first thing to go.
---
It doesn't matter how common they are, The timer exists to give you information regarding the game - When that information is wrong there is no point having it.
---
Moral of the story, don't be a toxic shit.
---
Overly altruistic teammates will do gens when no one is hooked, but will fall one after they start I hooking people
---
please dm me that guy i want to have a big boy laugh seeing his streams
---
What did you do with the remaining 75 minutes?
---
Camping is not taking the game hostage. The second two survivors can finish the game. Taking the game hostage means it cannot end.

damn so hostile lmfao. you’re the one who literally said you get run around 20 times at one loop “just to be stunned.” I can only assume you’re bad at other killers from *that statement you made*

We don't know the whole story because he 'doesn't want to get into it" he just wants attention.

1. There are other subs he can talk about relationship issues on

2. This post should have been deleted because it's not game related
---
3. For all we know the relationship didn't work out because he's a giant creep.

Go to the right subreddit, go to tumblr or just move on with your life...this entire thread is grosser than saying you were friendzoned. You weren't friendzoned, she just doesn't find you fuckable. Crying about it on reddit isn't going to help that...in fact it does to total opposite.

It's not a game of chance unless you have Iron Will.  You're just dead unless she's bad if youre injured.

---
~~side note I feel like Spirits tunnel off hook a ton and it's annoying~~
---
Don’t have fun? Don’t play. Easy as that
---
I've only played as Meyers a few times, but I remember creeping up on a generator as a survivor just started working on it, I stayed at the edge of stalk range and got all the way up to T3 within the first few minutes of the game. Definitely a pretty fun time and I can only imagine how the survivor must have felt when I finally charged in and 1-shot them.
---
Don’t need to keep posting everyone knows including the devs...
---
Lol you’re good, it’s the quotes after the first ones that really let you know
---
Demo has been my go to, playing demogorgon makes me feel strong we killer
---
Really? I made these skins all on mobile and I use them on my phone all the time.
---
Also, they don’t work on Java? That’s a shame. That’s my favorite platform.
---
You fucking dumbass I literally replied saying it was hyperbole. Every killer other than spirit and nurse get looped around object 3-4 times. I was exaggerating. Youre the one being purposely dense. Fuck off
---
How else do you think she gets such distance on them?
---
I like her design and most her sounds, I just wish they'd change her voice, honestly.  It didn't bother me at first, but as I played with her more it got kinda annoying
---
If you want to focus points on other stuff don't worry about it.  Legion's good at getting regular interaction with Survivors which is part of why he's good for farming BP.
---
everyone talked about it when it was new in the ptb and then everyone basically forgot about it after that.
---
Survivor Loadout:  The Coward
---
-Sole Survivor for aura hiding
---
-Left Behind for hatch finding in endgame
---
-Spine Chill for sneaking and hiding
---
-Bond to lead killer to other survivors during chases
---
I’ve got 18 cakes ready
---
Guess I’ll just have to ignore the incoming messages from that survivor on the hook then begging me to rescue him with my uninjured body and health kit.
---
**thanks, now I actively ignore EVERYONE when gates are powered! Fantastic help since it means others die guranteed!**
---
maybe if you weren’t as bad at being sarcastic as you are looping, people would understand your overly frustrated ass.you made the post, don’t act like I’m supposed to read the tone of ur voice.
---
This is a problem that’s been happening a lot, the end game timer was out of sync. Aka, it started early for the killer,and when it ended for him, it ended for everybody
---
Can’t tell what’s worse 
---
Verbose Claudette or Immerse Claudette
---
Because you're trash. Boo hoo, they'll have a extra chance at escaping if you slaughter their team. They have to do their objective before using it, not like you can open hatch at the start of the match.
---
I must of missed that, then, cause I didn’t even notice the change until yesterday during a kyf

How exacly does the perk work now? Haven´t played in months, but i want to refresh my knowlegde
---
What if the shock from being stabbed is enough to completely cloud someone’s self-awareness to the point that they can’t speak and all they know is that they have to get help.
---
I got farmed off the hook literally ASAP no BT. It was versus a Doctor. Just died, I fucking hate people
---
It’s my favorite out of the bunch, though I’m excited for new ones to come out *-*
---
They weren't hooked they weren't being sacrificed. That isn't camping that's hostage taking. They weren't being killed but they also couldn't escape.
---
What the hell was that?
---
I can understand this but personally disagree. Michael isn’t supposed to be one dimension but an omnipresence almost like Dracula ((But a lot more subtle)). He isn’t just evil, he is the personification of pure abandonment of humanity, complete and utter darkness. Michael didn’t just shut himself off because he went crazy, something deep inside him, inside ALL of us, overtook him. His eyes are devoid of reason and pure thought when you look at the beginning of the first film, he just coldly stares. As John Carpenter put it, “Michael Myers is like the wind, one moment he’s there, then he’s gone.” Yet he also makes it clear that Michael is still indeed human, but enveloped into a deep and almost supernatural darkness.
---
You're thinking too much in terms of 'score' rather than the fun of the game. There are so many instances where I could just leave the game, take the score, say sucks for them and try to rank up, but the real fun of DBD is trying to make the play, going for the save and see if you can try to route around the killer and escape. If you die in the process sure it sucks, but the times where you succeed it's such a huge rush and makes for very memorable games.
---
yeah since its a perk change you needed to go a fair bit down in the patch notes to find it.
---
Run Franklins if you see keys in there hand crybaby! Takes 2 seconds to see that in the lobby! Tired of hearing you guys bitch about remove this or remove that! Get over it and learn to play the fucking game and use the tools that the Entity has given you!!!
---
And what are you going to help with exactly with EG timer ticking away with a camping killer? Because that’s what’s going to happen since the general consensus seems to be it’s ok to camp the last hook if the gates are open so I’m not sure what the accomplishment would be with a 1 hit down killer camping and lingering around.
---
You are preventing the hatch from opening letting me hear it to, and it’s not as situational as you think as I’ve been killed by the timer for the umpteenth time because survivors think they’re going to save me IF I even go down camping at the gates with their fingers up there butts.
---
The really sad thing is I’ve had hatch’s at loops multiple times that wouldn’t open while mindgaming because survivors like you refuse to leave.
---
Downvote me all you want but if you get me killed because of the lingering around you’ll get a colorful message on PSN from me.
---
You can't put portals as close you could once. 1 meter maximum distance allowed increased to 4 meters distance so if you don't have the addons that expand the detection range survivors can sneak past the portal and open the gate
---
maybe ur teammate hates people too and that’s why he killed u omg
---
What about Rancor?
---
Look man, my job is kill you and you brought an item that allows you to escape early, of course you're a priority. Don't like it then get better at the looping or don't bring in keys.
---
Right ok. Thanks man
---
It's faster to work through ruin than it is to gen tap btw, even if you hit all goods.
---
American flag top + biker pants + head of your choice.
---
I'm sorry but this is so laughably wrong. Many of the killers can beat survivors at loops, a huge part of it is mindgaming the survivor, if you can't do that then you'll definitely get looped hard. I have 0 issue downing survivors at loops without nurse And spirit. Infinites can easily be broken so they can't be abused and it only takes bloodlust 1 to stop a difficult loop.
---
It removes the red-stain (I believe) and removes the terror radius after standing still for a few seconds.
---
You slug them, then someone else comes by, picks them up, opens the 99'nd gate, and protect him as he runs out.
---
Keys can be countered by Franklin's, they will spend time looking for their key less time doing the objective which they HAVE to do to use the key. Unless the rest of their team is killed.
---
I hope this makes some people rethink their language. At least that's what your statement did with me.
---
As a survivor I find him one of the easiest killers to deal with and struggle with Leatherface...
---
Myer’s certainly is even more terrifying in T3
---
Using good add-ons on killer is not toxic, please stop feeding into this.
---
ok but what’s the verdict if I put a pig helmet on him without toxic add ons and he still dies to it
---
I'm good at looping,  I'm not trash at the game and don't look to ruin someones day. So surviviors should be aloud to DC if they don't like ruin/bbq/the map or so on? Because that would take away bloodpoints you could be earning,  just as you are doing to them by tunneling them and denying them any chance.
---
Honestly it's your fault that you even play survivor in the first place
---
Young plague, Non half dead spirit,l would be skins that would make them a lot of money
---
Me too man and I also main legion unironically
---
Think the Quentin might’ve been, can never tell. They were just overly altruistic but not toxic at all
---
Yea I see that.
---
I still think they should make it so you can see the hatch at any time that it’s spawned, not just when ur last
---
Also, quit acting like people don't know it's a KILLERS job to kill that shit is played out. Also they STILL have to do a certain amount of gens before using the key, and then hunt down the hatch.
---

---
Yeah if the game was limited to how it was meant to be played with random people you can't speak to, then killer mains would literally have nothing to bitch about ever. It's heavily HEAVILY tilted their way and they forget it's not 4 v 1 it's 1 v (1v1v1v1) unless it's an swf.
---
I mean, that would be nice as it’s own perk, but the whole point of left behind is to give you a helping hand when you’ve been
---
Well
---
Left behind
---
Been happening to me for a few hours. People are loading up and as soon as the countdown timer hits and you’re about to go black screen, they leave. It goes black and you’re waiting for a few minutes, then you get the player disconnected screen. 
---
It be very hard to do punishment for anyone who disconnects due to internet may have dropped etc. However, the game has been fine until double bloodpoints came out yesterday. 
---
Almost like people are intentionally doing it to mess people up and not let anyone get the points.
---
It depends on the Michael, I just had one laid the slate clean of high tier survivors and we were getting gens repaired quick. One guy had a flashlight and tried to blind Myers, only to get T3’d by Myers instantly and I shat my pants
---
"The scream ran in bagging so hard."  
---
No.  
---
I believe you mean The Ghostface.  
---
Please.
---
I swear... nothings more satisfying
---
They weren’t toxic at all so I’m glad, they just had good add ons but didn’t act super tryhard either. I probably wouldn’t lost against a more determined team
---
What about Legion? ;-;
---
Yeah they are only compatible with bedrock and even then only on phone and windows 10 edition because they’re the only versions of bedrock that allow custom skins, like I said I too make Minecraft skins but I stick to 64x64 it looks uniform and anyone can use it.
---
not afaik, but I wasn't able to get away for more than 30 seconds or so when the second chased guy got downed at the gen I was on.
---
np, definitley worth checking out
---
Well done. I only get matched up with green/purple SWFs, and I’m only rank 14.
---
Psycho (2019)
---
Yea I should have mentioned that a lot of teammates immediately run for the unhook and go back to hiding. I had no idea you could pip just off farming teammates and barley anything else, thanks for the info.
---
You had valid points. 1- true. But again see the section of posting to a group of people who share a interest. Human nature and all that. 2- maybe but you seem to be the only one who is making a big deal about it. 3 - also could be true, so its a measure of faith if he was or wasn’t and I tend to lean towards giving people a benefit of a doubt. 
---
But then you go and invalidate everything you said by being ugly.There is literally zero reason for the last part but to insult people because you are either unhappy about -# by your post , or just wanted to find a new reason to insult people.
---
well I just think if they wanna make it actually viable that should be in. I get the point of the perk but imo it’s still not good enough to be even b (on a scale of s a b c)
---
I didn’t feel like he was that strong though. Especially against good survivors he’s hard to tier up with, and even when you get to T3 you’re basically just a slightly faster Plague with your 1 shot kills, still no chase help. 
---
Don’t mean to derail the thread, just giving my impressions as a wee nub.
---
At low ranks ruin is king. At high ranks it does pretty fast.
---
Always claudets 😀
---
Then theres only 4 totems
---
She started a vault
---
You can grab a survivor when they are vaulting similar to how you can grab them off gens, but only when they are injured
---
it has been in the game for a couple years now
---
We (the killer mains learning survivor) love you!
---
Definitely, watching him stalk from a far is very nostalgic for me
---
If you have enough time to stand by the exit gate to teabag the killer, why not just leave? There's no good reason you should be risking your escape just to teabag.
---
Survivor body blocking isn’t bannable, killer blocking to endgame is, don’t be an idiot
---
they’re done :)

The first game I played with BPS yesterday had a rank 8 (im rank 14) who gave up immediately expecting me and the others (15 and 17) to die immediately so they just hid in a locker and made food while we played. Ended up getting 16k from doing nothing. Second worst experience I've had playing this game.
---
well I’ll believe you if u can provide the link to bvhr confirming this.
---
ok so basically I play spirit cuz I love both her power and the cosmetics she has but fuck yeah everyone hates me even if I use fucking yellow addons
---
Understandable, though Michael did come out LONG before plague. 
---
I feel they did Justice to how he plays and how authentic it is to the first film, that’s why I enjoy it
---
Always knew that I didn't exist and the whole Universe is just an illusion.

Ah okay, that makes sense, I just didn’t think she’d vaulted bc that would’ve been straight into me lol. Thanks!

Agreed

I edited the comment to include a link to a video with those animations

I’m not scared of a fictional supernatural darkness tho, and I also cared more about Michael as a character study than a stand-in for wanton evil

---
They still get the full time allotted, but what happens is at some point, the bar freezes in place for a bit. Unless you watch it the entire time it's hard to notice if you're actively playing the game.
---
Make Your Choice, Pop Goes The Weasel and Dark Devotion
---
A big step toward that is adding a perk like BBQ that doesn't involve putting yourself in immense immediate danger.
---
Should have been legion with that image lol
---
I completely agree with you good sir, but for many people it's really hard to empathize with the other side.
---
At the end of the day everyone has something to complaint about because something went wrong but it would just be wiser to tell each other why we did what we did and understand that everybody is just trying to have a good time, so we can share the good and bad experiences to make everyone have a better time.
---
It's a de-sync issue between the host and the survivors.

---
I fail to understand why David is not at the top. He is one of the first characters that come to mind with toxicity.
---
Taking the game hostage is when a player or players take actions that require someone to disconnect to end the game in a reasonable amount of time. Blocking someone in the basement during Endgame Collapse does not fit this definition because the EGC timer is limited and the survivors will die in a short period of time. This has been confirmed by the community managers at Behaviour.
---
I agree that it's not fun to be trapped in the basement, but unless the killer is blocking the doorway and all survivors are trapped down there, it's not taking the game hostage. Behaviour also adjusted collision on the basement steps, so in some cases you should be able to get by the killer. I think if they stand at the top it may still block you.
---
It's not wasting time to stay around to help team mates, There are literally perks that encourage it.
---
Timer exists purely to stop games lasting forever - that's all.
---
**Stop. Defending. Obvious. Bugs.**
---
*laughs in avoiding starting a comment war where one side down-votes the other because theres more of a type of main on atm*
---
Different strokes for different folks. I prefer the character study stuff for Leatherface, Pinhead, and Jigsaw
---
This has happened like three times in a row.
---
Isn't ghost face undetectable whilst he's in night shroud? If not ez fix just make him undetectable then they cant see auras
---
I don't care if you bring a key, I'm just not going to play like an idiot because you feel entitled to use it. My job is to kill survivors so eliminating the risk of someone escaping early is only logical. I play around keys just like I expect survivors to play around my shit. I expect survivors to jump in lockers if I bring tombstone, I expect survivors to tap gens if I run prayer beads, etc. I think it is very shallow to call something "toxic" or this case "trash" simply because people are playing smart based on what add-ons the killer or survivors bring. If you bring a key, of course I'm going to make sure it isn't used within the best of my ability.
---
Maybe some actual useful perks?
---
Your flair literally says you can't loop. Don't tell a vet how to play the game you fucking noob.
---
Which majority do use them for but sure lets keep gamebreaking bugs because your feelings got hurt over the crouch button.
---
OH?!
---
Chunky Jesus descends from the heavens to give an old Vietnam veteran some back rubs.
---
In their defense, they do constantly break their own game and often make it unplayable.
---
You just sound salty as shit. I only leave if I know everyone else has made it out, or if there’s nothing I can do to help the people left. I don’t care about the killer’s feelings lol, I want to save my teammates since that’s what being a good teammate is (why I run BT) and give a fuck you to any camping killers whenever possible. 
---
If the last guy got hooked near an exit gate and is being camped by Freddy then I’m going to go back in for a BT save so we both escape. Especially if I have another teammate.
---
Then you have the games where ruin stays up the whole time and your team manages to pop 3-4 gens while you loop the killer. I sadly only get those teams every dozen or so games if I am lucky :(
---
*heavy breathing*
---
Hard yes, or encourage farming. BBQ discourages camping but WGLF encourages hook farming :|
---
I’m a kate main and I’m a cunt sooo
---
We were trapped in the basement for 2 generators, and if the other Survivors didn't do the gens and then open the gates we would've had to DC. That's hostage taking, and if Behavior thinks it isn't then they're crazy.
---
Yeah usually we all just stay hidden and tap gens and dip quickly to hide again. They last a long time but as long as he can't tier on your ass you're good :P
---
I’ve played both sides, most arguments are borne from nothing. Survivors its camping, tunneling,crutch perks. All just buzzwords because they dont like losing fairly. For killers its toxic,Crutch perks. Cant catch someone? Call em toxic! They use dead hard? Crutch perk! Killer uses ruin, noed, bbq? Crutch perks because they suck! Mature arguments arent a possibility in this game most of the time
---
No because they take turns bodyblocking
---
It isn't revenge on anyone because you're doing it in a fresh lobby against different survivors.  They weren't toxic to you so it isn't revenge on anyone.  It's just a lousy killer being toxic for the sake of being toxic.  You're an equal part of the problem in this community as any of the teabagging flashlight spamming survivors.  You're just the other side of that.
---
You should've known that! Sorry my dude, that's 10 years of 50% bloodpoints reduction that goes to the LORD Entity and to pay medical assistance to baby dweet.
---
Question for everyone, FAVORITE HALLOWEEN MOVIE AND MOMENT?
---
imagine calling someone a noob unironically lmfao. no. my flair is a meme. sad you missed that since appearently you’re such a vet.
---
How are survivors &gt; killers?
---
That animation even explains why you can get grabbed so far through the anim lmao
---
It isn't it's the fault of a babykiller who'd rather blame the opponents for how their games go instead of putting in any time or work into learning how to actually play the role of killer.  If you want to punish toxic survivors do it against those survivors.  You're doing this against fresh lobbies who haven't done toxic thing 1 to you.
---
Really? Never happened to me, what do you play on?
---
Okay but this doesn’t change the time, just makes it unseeable so close escapes can still happen only dicks will consistently get killed by it lol
---
Amazing save.  I wonder if that was by design or just pure luck?
---
Survivor main here, I always cringe at tea baggers. They watch one noob3 or monto video and think they are god. I'm glad you got her. I'm surprised she didn't rage quit.
---
You you you and you... FCK OFF
---
&gt;Why are you so salty?
---
*Proceeds to swear and scream*
---
I hate toxic players period.  You are one of them.  Toxic players on both sides are scumbags who make this community a much shittier place than need be.  You are a part of that.
---
The problem with the first one is that currently the only thing that allows you to unconditionally do something like that is a brand new part and that is a ultra rare addon so id say it needs some downside to be balanced because in swf groups this can result in 4 gens being done 30% faster which makes swf even more unbalanced the second one is still very niche but fine i suppose and the third one is just too strong,unless you have a garbage team and/or you let yourself get chased the entire game you will 100% get enough allone time to get at least 1 token and can result in 2 possible jokers. Again in a swf group having one person take all the agro during the first 2-3 gens you have 3 people that are immortal and can just do watever they want without the killer being able to do anything about it
---
I think The Doctor would constantly be smiling regardless of his mouth piece.

Xbox. Happened to me early in EGC’s existence where I debated wether or not to go unhook someone or at least take a hit for them at the very tip of the exit while they were injured.
---
I’m so proud, Reg!
---
I'd say he's one of those killers where detection perks are really good, especially discordance for me personally. Make sure to keep up your abyss often for a little bit to make sure no one is destroying anything. There is nothing different from the meta, and Pop Goes the Weasel is particularly good. You probably wouldn't need anything to help you in a chase, just because of the lunge, but you'll have to get good at using it. So basically any perks that are good for traversing across the map because of detection, and Make your Choice is really good.
---
Ya
---
&gt;:c
---
"Gamebreaking", haha okay. I have never had an issue with this bug, not once, maybe because I´m not an ass survivor. 
---
It´s obviously a bug. Big deal. It will be fixed. Meanwhile karma is being served. Enjoy it.
---
I’m gonna come back to this post after I watch the kill count for that
---
You can't bodyblock the basement anymore, did they not know and just let it happen?
---
Oh man, the downvotes. They're coming.
---
Im a really low rank survivor (rank 16) and I hate leatherface, hes just so good at low ranks due to me not being good. Also I watch too many high rank killers and I cant mindgame my killers because they dont know what they're doing xd
---
Here's an official response from Behaviour:
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/62203/holding-the-game-hostage
---
my thoughts exactly lol
---
My fellow player I am new two and I like bubba and huntress. I find them fun but you might want to ask someone more experienced.
---
This needs to happen. The only problem would be cosmetics.
---
Yaaaasssss! xD
---
Not even a prank, that's just not right
---
You're a sad little man. Bye kid.
---
and you called me salty xd
---
That’s true lmao
---
So it's your first time in any community huh? Never heard of CoD or LoL? For Honor? Literally any community I listed is worse, maybe not much for Honor but still
---
Entity merged them all into one person basically? Entity is a pretty big meany
---
I already thought of that, the member you want to be first you put on the body of that character in cosmetics
---
lmfao I love ur post history btw, complaining about billy and spirit and now making posts like this. ur such a meme.
---
Butt dancing displeases the entitty.
---
Just play like you have no clue what you’re doing and you’ll get by man. Low ranks are a pain
---
Mmm Legion is fun for me to play because they are quick and even faster using their power. Chasing survivors with Legion is a ton of fun as well. Pig is great when you want to sneak up on survivors and not even use the dash attack but roar and watch them all scatter then cancel it before it finishes. Lastly Myers just because I like the idea of blowing my load on one or two unlucky survivors.
---
No that's not it (although it's funny to think about) they are still 4 people but they would switch out mid game like Capcom games
---
Jack is right. If you have any problem at all with items, Franklin's is there for you.
---
Huntress is pretty good and fun if you can land the hatchets and I find freddy really fun too
---
Pig is good, I only recently got her, and I enjoy her playstyle. Personally I go for killers that interest me with their powers, you're more likely to enjoy them and want to play them more.
---
What i mean is that with the rework the entity could have done that. Either that or once ff ends you are a normal powerless m1 killer til you go to some placed small sheds and switch with a different member
---
Wasn't cheating either.
---
Yes I can I can loop very well actually. But every patch it gets harder and harder to do. Totems are ez to find. I'm just sick of the devs catering to killers more and more by the daily.
---
No you shouldn't be worried
---
What I’m trying to say is by going after the same survivor multiple times you waste time. There are perks that prevent tunneling by wasting your time as a killer. Time is really important for killer. The survivors will gen rush you if you don’t apply pressure to everyone.
---
Kinda like the plauge pools
---
I've played this game for 2 years I know all that stuff it's the fact that over the past 2 years killers have gotten stronger and stronger until now rank 1-3 you survive 20 percent of the time unless you have a strong 4 man
---
Michael Thomas
---
Because they hate pig
---
Wait, how do i fit urban evasion in there
---
Yeah sort of. Just small sheds where legion would open the door and there would be another member, with distinct clothing differences so you’d know. Cosmetics will be a problem
---
No. One of the instances this happened was ghost face was at the bottom of the hill standing still stalking me. I was about a 2 feet directly in front of him on top the hill. Another time I circled him inside of a jungle gym but idk.
---
You were asking for it
---
We have a mechanic to counter that: the End Game Collapse. If you want to give the killer a way to shut gates that are already open that's completely ridiculous.
---
How can you be happy with yourself !? &gt;:(
---
Good solution except you dont start with a joey or susie body. But they'd probably just add default versons for them.
---
No, that's not even that good of a build unless you get slugged.
---
They can be strong, I mostly play survivor I just think we all need to calm down on the complaining and just enjoy the game for what it is, and if you can't then I'm sorry but sometimes it's a you problem, not the game itself.
---
Until you move or act again. That's why it's usually linked to camping.
---
This couldn't be more false.  Killer is the power role after a years worth of survivor nerf patches.  The only thing that challenges that is a skilled coordinated swf.  Otherwise you can play any killer if you know what you're doing and win.  If you still feel this weak as killer you need to take a hard look at your killer play and address the weakness in your game that is causing those feelings.
---
And when you get it , the ranks won't even be close.
---
report it to BHVR, I bought Auric cells 2 or 3 times and I always got them +/-10 seconds after I purchased them so this is not normal.
---
They should remove keys and buff the perk so that you can see the hatch even when it's not open
---
Yup. Came here to say this
---
I didn’t know
---
Survivors have always fallen after a second hit with BT:
---
If the unhooked Survivor takes any damage while affected by Deep Wound or if its timer ends, the unhooked Survivor is immediately put into the Dying State
---
So how I would do cosmetics is whichever member you want to be first is decided before the game in the cosmetics menu, if you want to be Joey first put on Joey's body
---
Okay, I actually *really* want Broken Lense to be added.
---
Overconfidence is a flimsy killer.
---
Wait a minute...
---
Rubbing it in is still a dick move. Just go away, let me get my BP, stop teabagging, and ECG doesn't prematurely kill anyone. I'm not speaking for all Killers here, but a lot of us will let Survivors go once the gates are opened
---
You make them think you *might* want to farm.
---
But you are only there for the tears and the screams.
---
I thought points had nothing to do with rank. It’s the requirements for the shard right? Prove thyself wouldn’t count as more generator progress, and I don’t think sabo even gives rank.
---
If a dev even sneezed there would be someone demanding they revert back to before the sneeze.
---
You can't revenge players in a fresh lobby lol!  Are you a little kid or something how is this not sinking in?  It's a very elementary concept.  You're just a toxic dick no better or worse than the very survivors you hate.  You're every bit as cancer to the community as any of the survivors that bm you.  You're all trash that makes this community a crappier place than it needs to be.
---
I play both sides and killers already have the EGC and BW. There's no point in having a mechanic that already does something a perk does well. You get people camping the gates? Well use BW and punish them for not leaving.
---
Thank you mum
---
When I play killer the person that unhooks usually is just trying to toss the hooked person under the bus.
---
Is that the laughing from feel good inc
---
Were they Dwights?
---
Whaaaa--?! 😱
---
I was playing with a friend against an afk killer.  I left early.  He wanted the hatch, the team didnt leave before the timer skip.  An afk killer got a 3 man.
---
I have her she was a free dlc
---
How dare I camp a pallet for ONE second to defend myself from a killer.
---
Each one gives you 100% more blood points based on what you earned. So if you get 20k and had 5 with event that's 20k x6 which is 120k, you can also add another bonus with bbq &amp; chili (cannibal perk) or no one left behind (David perk)
---
At this rate i dont even try to get the rescue and just go for gens and heals because sometimes ill get the toxic teamate that purposely f### up a skill check if i dont heal them which is bs but what am i gonna do except heal them which i wish more people understood that you 99 the gen then pop it unless its the 4th or last gen in that case you just pop it because most likely he or she has adrenaline and/or the killer will come their very soon
---
It puzzles me when it gets down to just one or two dudes left and *then* you get yelled at for "tunneling."  There's only one of you left, man—what am I supposed to do, start hunting crows?
---
*happiness gurgles*
---
so... balance them out? or only make them switch if they actually landed a hit?
---
Randomness doesn't stop people for doing that anyway. It only makes them sometimes take more than 3 and sometimes take less than 3 tries but the statistical effect would be the same
---
Yeah but my friends don’t play as much as I do so my highest rank friend is usually rank 10 while I can get to rank 2 since it’s pretty much the only game I play right now
---
Nope. The hag begged for the entities help upon death and then ate the cannibals that were eating her alive.
---
That’s not what he’s saying. If Freddy were to tunnel the person with the deep wound, they would fall whether Freddy hits them or not because it will tick down due to the terror radius not being there
---
By any chance was this on Haddonfield? If it was we were tryna find the hatch to get a four man escape and no one could find it.
---
Not sure why this is getting downvoted. I’ve had plenty of games on both sides where the killer is on a the verge of winning with 1 gen left and then 3 people escape and killer gets entity displeased. Not saying they need to be removed but keys are definitely not balanced and they definitely dont get countered by Franklins.
---
I main Vommy Mommy and my favorite add-ons are the ones that make it more effective, giving them the broken status faster. This helps me get early downs and snowball to keep pressure. If I get a team that actually uses the pools then I make sure I vomit on everything i can forceing them to get sick more often and therefore waste time cleansing again. Also when I was learning her I used the pink add-on that reveals them when they vomit but that's only usefull if there the type that dosent cleanse.
---
That happened to me last night too but I wasn’t being toxic lol
---
PS4 btw , pretty good job so far
---
We do **not**, *Never*! Who told you that!? Was it Meg?
---
 I am going to do a butt dance when she gets moried next time.
---
I mean... \**innocent mouse noises.\**
---
I played a lot of spirit, got her to p3, used prayer beads maybe 2-3 times total.
---
It’s severely overpowered and needs to be removed or changed. Anyone who does use it regularly should be perma-banned and have their pc/console confiscated.
---
A killer where all you can do is hope she just randomly pull you off a gen or appear in front of you out of nowhere will no counterplay possible should not exist.
---
“But you can hear her footsteps tho” ya by that time it’s to late and she gets a free hit because of an add-on.
---
Buff Pig and Trapper please👍
---
My graphics card is broken. Still haven’t got to the stranger things chapter. And now I’m going to miss double blood points. D:
---
But if they didn't get Joey again they would be sitting there waiting their survivor pressure, survivor locating, and faster chases to slow the game
---
Are they disconnecting in the middle of the game, or is it only at the end screen? On PS4 there is a bug that disconnects survivors from the killer when the killer gets to the match results screen, resulting in no escape points or player level xp.
---
Weirdo. Only Reddit nerds look through peoples post history just to have some rebuttal. You got reckted kid give it up.
---
Me looking at this meme  
---
First vignette: uh wow, he glue bubba's face perfectly, he doesn't even look photoshopped.  
---
Second vignette: OH GOD JESUS CHRIST WHAT IS THAT THING
---
Was it one of those situations where the last gen is like at 80% done so every survivor keeps trying to play for that one gen while the killer keeps hooking survivors around that gen?
---
r/collapse
---
I'm laughing at this harder than I should be.
---
That combination of addons fits great with No Mither, Self Care, Solidarity and Second Wind. Arguably the best build in the game
---
Points are a big factor. Can't confirm it's 100% the deciding factor but it plays a big role. 
---
For instance, killers are punished for ending games too quickly. Usually because not enough gens were done to give gatekeeper and chases weren't long enough. Things like that. 
---
Of course, I could be 100% wrong and I apologize in advance for any misinformation. But points aren't the end all be all. You can get the maximum amount of hooks in the game but if you were around the hooks too long, the emblem associated emblems will suffer. 
---
So, there are some ways to end with high points and bad emblems but for the most part, if you properly prioritize points during a match, a safety is easy to come by.
---
It’s hilarious how people still think that DS is strictly an anti-tunnel perk, and you can completely avoid it just by not being a toxic tunneler.
---
That's wild, pretty cool bug, doesn't seem to be common though or it would be a real problem for Killers. 😂
---
Halloween is also my favourite film of all time. One of the main reasons I got into Dead by Daylight was because of Myers and then they added Ghostface as well which just completed it for me. I agree. Michael is the greatest slasher of all time and much better than Jason.
---
I'm liking the new biker jacket with the black metal face+legs.
---
Trabslation for those wondering: Top guy said his team was shit.
---
Not at once, after another. Let's say the killer tunnels a survivor and then he dies, but the game is not over yet, because in the time it took to tunnel one guy the other 3 were unable to finish 5 gens. Now the killer chooses another target to tunnel. Does make perfect sense in my book.
---
Accurate
---
Oh god, yeah is like that feel you get when you see a youtube comment on an old song that says "They ripped off XXX artist" you know, that artist that put \[Cover\] in the damn title of their video.
---
WHERE ARE YOUR MANNERS YOUNG BOY?
---
Hag was in a life or death situation though, Ghostface just walked in one day
---
Pretty much
---
Dude it doesnt matter whether you find the hex or not when its leatherface 80 percent of the ranks who play as him will camp no matter what (excluding ranks 1,2,3 &amp; 20)
---
How about we add another perk slot in the game and also use inner strength
---
Either this is the same exact person that I played with last night or it's just the exact same map, killer, and circumstance but that was super deserved if it was you because you were a bad teammate and didn't really do a whole lot the entire match lmaO
---
Good for you:just keep in mind teabagging is just fucking around for some of us. I don't take it personal as killer but I know it can be annoying. It is a survivor's job to be an annoyance though right?
---
I thinks it's funny because he was bullying the Claudettes in the pregame chat by saying they need to do gens, truly he was the shit teammate.
---
what u expect? they are winning hunter. they cannot live without winning. if they cannot winning, others cannot too. that was already in their mindset. they are like a loser IRL that full of pure jealousy of others success
---
This game is toxic without events. Not everyone is toxic though. You just have shit games.
---
Sorry, you missunderstood me. I was not advocating for or against this playstyle. 
---
I was merely explaining to CreepyClown why I would consider going for that save 'greedy'. It's a risky play. Whether you greed for points, fun or excitement makes no difference to me.
---
Done

Don’t know much about pinhead but yeah same reason I like the saw series, lots of interesting characters
---
This happened to a random in a game my friends and I were in too.
---
Sarah or June as a survivor and then one of the creatures as a killer would be lit!
---
Good job! Pig is not the strongest killer and it's pretty difficult to understand how to use her power, so props to you!
---
Imo NOED is fine, cleanse totems and it is gone. What frustrates me when I play killer is swf where the coordination is light years higher than in solo and you can't get anything done as killer.
---
I wish all the killers I faced played that poorly. In the time spent tunneling 1 survivor the rest of us will be slamming out gens with impunity.
---
And then we gotta take them half way across the map to ensure that no one else finds it. 
---
Meanwhile a claudette has been watching the whole thing and has her teeny little invisible woman fingers fondling the totem as I run to hook the first guy.
---
I thinking her hearts in the right place but she isn’t really bringing anything new to the table. She’s just blaming people instead of rallying people to clean up beaches or donate to a cause.
---
Yes, althought unpleyable is an exaggeration.  But that doesn't mean that when BHVR posts about their company's new website they should complain about the game in that tweet that has nothing to do in with that post
---
So deserved. If only Meg got the same punishment
---
Im a Rank 4 and out of my friends other than me the lowest rank is 6 and the other two are 15ish. They didn't enjoy playing yesterday cause I was pulling them into harder games. I like this new system but I feel like in just encourages people to derank.
---
Yes, but if giving pressure on your team and killing someone off, it makes hooking a new guy more valuable if theres only 3 survivors instead of 4. I'm sure you're right about higher level play, but at an intermediate level, people tend to keep trying to save the same guy rather than letting him die. This gives the killer a lot of power in the game if it's used right (not just camping the hook and things).
---
Exactly!
---
Did the timer seriously go down that fast?
---
*insert gen jocky build here*
---
how to transfer? do you have  drone and place it? doesnt it make wallhacks? it just make camper more happier. insidious is better if far away from hooked player 20m and make it fully disappear while standing 4s. and while move , terror radius still 0 for another 10s
---
That’d be really cool, but it’d be too strong for Hillbilly and Nurse.
---
In order of the most fun you'll have I only have Legion and Demo but I assume it's like this: Legion, Demo, Ghostface. In the form of best perks: Legion, Ghostface, Demo.
---
As a meg main, I love it! Please do more. Maybe you'll encourage them to give her more diverse cosmetics.
---
Your perk designs are truly awful to look at lol
---
Even after the hotfix it's still doing it.
---
Holy shit this isn't a troll account. 
---
You are legit fucking stupid. Like you know how people just say "you're dumb" to be mean to people? This isn't the case for you. You are literally stupid.
---
Connections are shit lately, idk why.
---
Hasn't affected me but a lot of friends disconnect from the game, normally I also lag heavily when they do but don't dc.
---
It'd be a good way to mindgame, while still making it a unique perk. You could insidious near an exit gate, hook, or generator and put your terror radius there to add a thin layer of defense while you go do something else. Imagine dark devotion, but more static and under your control.
---
That would be so situational. It'd only be really good on mid/endgame killers like Myers or Wraith
---
* Looking for Group posts - Use our weekly Campfire Meetings LFG Megathread or /r/dbdLFG.
---
It absolutely is, did you not read the rulebook?
---
Everyone hates on Claudette so much man. But I'm just over here doing every single gen from the shadows..
---
I used to rely heavily on spine chill but I find that unless it's a stealth killer it's kind of a wasted perk. My current build is Iron will, Prove thyself, better together, and fixated/resilience.
---
As a Jake and Laurie main, I don't know how to feel about this lol

Uh oh. Another survivor main who just wants killers to get nerfed so they can bully the baby Trappers and Wraiths /s

Ok that’s the doctor, and good luck doing that against red rank chainsaws, you missed the part where I’ll let go of struggle if you go for a risk save you really shouldn’t be going for, that’s fine if others want to put you in danger but I’m not going to enable any more melee points or chainsaw power points or trading hooks so you do you boo
---
I'm just not willing to wait the time to get into a match with sweat buckets that leave me with 9k bp
---
I'm browsing because I'm wainting
---
I'm solo queue and it's happened to me alot too right at the end of the game and after you've used an escape cake on a double exp weekend it stings haha
---
HERE HERE!!!!!!!
---
Are you the same person that made the doctor skin as well?
---
Good shit man, hope survivors are treating you nicely.
---
I think Legion is fun how come you feel this way?
---
Depends on luck aswell i guess. but ye if a survivor uses an offering where all survivors spawn together and rush two gens in 2 mins its gonna be tough.
---
Just. Leave
---
Great idea. I really hope the devs can revisit some base perks. There are a ton of teachables right now, and most of the old stuff is pretty bad. Looking through perk rankings, most of the perks for all killers/survivors are B or worse...not everything can be A, but some of them could use a buff.
---
Every DBP event I just farm. I load in and message everyone and farm the fuck out of a game. Makes the 48 wait time worth it.
---
You know you can hit survivors from there right
---
Absolutely, what makes him better is that he’s so simple. His mask, suit and weapon are unique but simplistic ((unlike ghostface, which tried simple and generic)), he’s still human but with an almost supernatural omnipresence that could be felt to from the opening scene, to the ending shots of the Myers house with his breathing. 
---
It’s a timeless, creepy, and oddly comforting movie.
---
I’m getting weird disconnects lately. Last night I canceled Frenzy with Legion and it dc’d me. I’ve also put people on hook and immediately dc’d, get pallet stunned and dc’d, etc.
---
For the most part, they are. Only a few tea-baggers.
---
Spirit
---
This brings a smile to my face.
---
Thank you for this insightful post, very cool kanye
---
I still feel like when a survivor dcs the rest of the players should automatically safety pip whether they do nothing at all or what because when a survivor dcs it hurts the teams chances of surviving and in some cases piping and it can hurt the killer by making him/her lose points depending whether it was an early dc or late game dc
---
Is she hard and is the survivor that comes with her good
---
This is actually me. *But* my friends have a habit of actually not doing a fucking thing so it’s okay
---
Solo survivor main here, and I’ve noticed the farther up in rank I go, the more survivors DC on a first hit. On PS4 anyway. It’s actually been quite nice starting fresh on the Switch, no ones DCing, they just wanna play. I’ll take the questionable graphics over 3 DCs any day.
---
lmao on xbox me and my friends literally have to quit out and restart the game every 2-3 games just to load up together. Such a shitty update. Love this game but this update just sucks :(
---
If you don't already, start watching otzdarva and you'll eventually put all of them in their place.
---
relying on NOED to get kills, pathetic
---
Congrats!! I was so hype over my first 4K!
---
this happens to me when I swf.
---
Or it serves a function in match other than "more BP plz"
---
Well for that to happen the hooked survivor needs to be a good looper and you have to either not face ruin or get rid of the Totem really quick. You‘re completely right though that it is poorly played by the killer.
---
What I was complaining about was merely the fun factor though, as I consider this type of game very unfun, as it is neither engaging nor challenging, but at least you get Bloodpoints.
---
I mean, yeah almost all survivors are doing it to be toxic, or do it because they see others do it, I think most don't realize or don't care that it helps them get points.
---
Nice work, killer. Keep up the hunting. 🤘🏼
---
For me it's Nightmare on Elm Street, the first one. As for the favorite moment, it's hard to decide. All dream sequences are memorable, but especially the one at the school where the protagonist doesn't realize she's asleep until things start getting progressively weirder. I love how at the end of this dream, when Freddy's chasing her in the boiler room, the music is so upbeat, like in a fitness video. Modern movies go for eerie melancholic tones. Old Nightmare on Elm Street? Time for some aerobics, everyone!
---
Stopping to teabag is obviously so important 😂😂😂
---
I feel like this is a totally valid complaint and should be fixed ASAP
---
Bloody cool is amazing it gives you one shot potential and a good hex defense
---
I'll definitely check him out. I've been watching HybridPanda for a couple years, so I know the basics.
---
Didn't Myers agree to it as well?
---
Something something Laurie was here?
---
In my experience, killers attract a very particular type of person. It's a role in which you get to cause harm to 4 people and they can't do anything back to you except run well. It attracts a particularly whiny incel and they mostly seem to fucking LOVE causing grief. Best thing you can do right now is log into killer cue and choke up their lobby time. I've played about 30 games since BP event started and 2 of them were farming sessions, 4 were good games played in earnest and the rest were sincerely desperate attempts to just fuck people over including 6 killer DC's when the scales were tipped against them.   
---
Outside of those 2 farming sessions 0 killers have played BPS and almost all of them have played pudding.
---
Congrats
---
Long live the king 🎃🎃🎃
---
Never been a fan of watching other people play a game but I can watch otz for hours. Dudes a saint
---
I like them and that's it, I don't expect others to like them because they don't see them.
---
Oh I fucking farm the fuck out or DBP. I saved up a bunch of birthday cakes and I go in and just farm the absolute shit out of the game. 
---
Makes the 48 waiting time worth it.
---
The trap activates if it’s on a survivor when a gen pops. You can’t escape if you have an active trap on, otherwise you’ll die once you get far enough into the exit gates.
---
If you put the trap on after all the gens are completed, however, they can run out without any repercussions. An inactive trap won’t kill you at the gates, and there’s no way to activate it once all gens are done. 
---
Also, you can escape through the hatch even if you have an active trap on.
---
Except if you have spaghetti coding! And we do :(
---
You better not come close or I'm gonna head on yo- and head on didn't work and I got Downed
---
Did you stop or get blocked? 
---
Bad decision/loldickmove by teammate.
---
You can change colours with the skin packs
---
PS4 had this same issue when the game first launched on PS4 a couple years ago. Took them months to fix it
---
It feels so shitty when you bring BPS and end up with like...7k points.
---
&lt;3
---
Check in with you Doctor. It's probably not a Dead by Daylight issue.
---
Enough people in the community wanted it this way, devs just gave us what we asked for.
---
The only thing he brings to the table is catching survivors basically just a much worse version of nurse. His chase potential is on par with Freddy but Freddy has no reload and a teleport.
---
How quickly the tide turns!
---
non't
---
It's good to know people have their priorities straight in this game.
---
I like the stark contrast of it tho, you only get edgy dark serious stuff now. Btw, I meant Halloween movie as in the franchise, but I’ll change it to slasher flicks in general
---
*is a claudette main so sees no evil here*
---
&gt;Quentin looks so much like Smeagol ~~in this picture~~
---
It’s still annoying I can’t play with any of my friends anymore
---
I actually saw that video. Thought it would be better.
---
Honestly I think you are right, gonna get downvotes for this, but hear me out, if I killer focuses you after you get unhooked, then stands over you for 60 or so seconds to wait out your ds, its pointless to even bring it. There have been so many times that I have just been sat on in red ranks while they wait for my ds to run out.
---
Everything is fine, just dbd, maybe it's glitched?
---
She isn’t even op tho lol (prayer beads is a different story) if you dc to a spirit your the worst player ever. Just learn to mind game
---
That’s fair I think. It takes 90 seconds to do a gen I believe
---
Because killers hate on survivors and survivors hate on killers it’s a two way street.
---
Any end game perk sucks, tbh. To get any value out of things like BW or NOED you need to play badly and get to endgame. Outside of ST6 crap
---
The perks, items and addons are locked behind bloodpoints, so we have to take advantage of events like these to get ahead. Can't do that without farming
---
I had 3 daily's dash attacks with pig, rescues with Steve and survivors caught in bear traps. I like trapper but I have zero time and points invested in him so I reset that daily and it was sabotaging 2 hooks. I did the pig game first successfully then a survivor game to knock 2 out at once but I came out of the match with only 1 complete the rescue one. I check my daily that's left and the sabotage one had been switched with use the doctors shock on survivors. I reset it on purpose but having my daily switch on me after I had the intention of completing one that got yeeted is annoying.
---
Yeah crazy to see such a humble guy playing a game with a community as bad as dbd's.
---
They should add a time penalty and when you dc you get hit with like a 15 minute or 30 min ban,  but every time you dc it increases the penalty, but the dc time penalty gets reset back to the orginal time every rank reset.
---
Its a neccessary evil, almost every other competitive game punishes you whether you crash or not.
---
The old Joke would have had Freddy in F anyways, I miss those memes...
---
I might try to get some games in this evening. I messaged you.
---
Game added anti-aliasing. Are you on console or PC?
---
Pc
---
Teamwork: A+
---
Never heard of him tbh, I'll probably check him out.
---
Yeah, that's literally the only counterplay to a key and moris have zero counterplay, hence the "*little* to no counterplay".
---
Honestly, _I_ don't have a huge issue with them. If I get mori'd or if a Survivor escapes through the hatch with a key, more power to 'em. I just kinda take issue with the fact that they can just cut a game short.
---
I honestly don't care how many times I see clips like this, they never get old.
---
I’m not sure if this is a killer meme or a survivor meme,  but either way I like it.
---
Same. I'm pretty bad at looping but I can hide well and do gens efficiently. Usually, I don't manage to distract the killer for long, but I did loop the shit out of one for at least literal two minutes this one time and not a single gen popped.
---
If they DC they had fun (on the next trial)
---
Correction that looks like my sister after i tell her my honest opinion of something even though she asked me to do so
---
I mean, maybe he was staying so that the killer could get points for hitting...?
---
What if I slug him, leave him, and he still bleeds out?
---
Bruh what did he say. Spill the tea
---
And next post about surv bad killer good sooooo boring
---
Simply because they last longer and so do the games(I’m not meaning this in a good way). What takes them 20-30 minutes takes good players 10-15 minutes. They might pip up and still get bp but they are playing games for much longer which is going to add up and mess with their bp earnings. Me knowing that playstyle still fucks them over in a way makes me very content with those types of players. I can always get in a new match with different survivors, but they have to fucking deal with themselves and deal
---
with their own bad habits every game until they actually use critical thinking and realize certain things are priority depending on the circumstance. I know it ain’t all that serious but I’ve had plenty of time to think about this so I’m locked and loaded on the subject.
---
 I am totally a survivor main and there is no way I actually play more killer. No need to check my History at all because I  truly hate all killers and wish to see them all leave so the game can finally become good.
---
Dude, at least some part of you must realise how cringy what you just now said was...
---
That's why he's my favourite. What an absolute mad lad
---
Ahhh yes, you can turn it off through going in appdata settings or some shit. I haven't done it yet as my games fine but this is the info that the official forum gives. 
---

---
I had the chance to do this yesterday, but I was playing survivor.
---
you still have him once if four tries. The net value of spamming the ability to get him is the same no matter if it's random or goes in a set order.
---
I just want to release the frustration the randomness would bring, make it predictable so it can properly get balanced and give it a possibility of skill expression via planning around the cycle
---
Didn't the Clown join fairly willingly?
---
Nah, they were all right on the exit (like with the gate open) healing each other and messing around
---
For me, at the end of the day, why argue at all? It’s just a game. I’ve never once messaged someone because they were being shitty. I just jump into the next game. Maybe it’s because I’m not a confrontational person, but being an asshole to someone being an asshole achieves what exactly? Not a damn thing. You’re not gonna make that player play any differently. If I get a nasty message, I either completely ignore it or I send them a link to my current favorite album with “#StreamSoAndSoOnSpotify”. 
---
If it’s in the game, it’s fair and square (bugs not included).
---
Can confirm it kills early at random, it fucking happened to me early in EGC’s lifespan.
---
I doubt he just DCd cause that happened, game has been dcing a lot of people lately again
---
You reported a killer for camping 2 people? Talk about salty, if that's how they want to play the game that's their prerogative lol, can't ban a killer for killing.
---
My brother and I always get matched up with useless teammates like that. Maybe we can play together and form a new squad :)
---
They are disconnecting mid game,or like when we get all 5 gens
---
As a Ghostface main I can confirm
---
I looked it up. Thanks for the trauma k bye
---
Because then you just become part of the problem. Toxicity breeds more toxicity.
---
Fast forward to 26:00 min in, why was this removed though? It looks better then it does now.
---
Okay but people tbagin at exit gates happens  20x as much as that situation
---
The end-tities child has been confirmed 
---
End all neas

---
Even rank 1 survivors don't hit greats every time, and you're far more likely to run into at least some of the survivors struggling to hit the skill checks giving you a lot of time. If survivors instead opt to look for ruin instead of doing gens, that's even more time wasted instead of getting gen progress. If they gen tap, that might honestly be the best use of ruin: it doubles the amount of time it takes to complete a gen. That's insane amounts of map pressure. Even if ruin gets found within a minute, if that one minute buys you enough time to get a down and prevent 3 gens popping within 1 Chase, it's still one of the best perks in the game
---
Could have saved some time and just bought a Nintendo Switch.
---
It doesn't matter it's still great.
---
I guess so,it’s sad
---
This was a rank 1 nurse on PS4 and was getting gen rushed after ruin getting broken before first hook so I think this person DC’d but idk hope  I you’re right.
---
?
---
Ruin only works like 1/10 games anyways, it gets broken within 2 minutes except on new maps there are some really good spots
---
Didn’t get that part blood streamers either smh lol.
---
Entity displeased.
---
Spirit isn’t hard but I’ve been playing this game a bit so she might Be to a beginner. I forgot the survivor that came with shattered bloodline
---
I stopped running it a while ago, it makes things more difficult but it wasn't exactly useful. Corrupt Intervention is so much better for slowing down the early game which is all Ruin is good for anyway
---
Thank you a lot
---
In my personal opinion it should be Ruin instead of Hex ruin
---
Wax brick is awful.
---
I mean no, it doesn't. You just remember it more.
---
It's like saying we should remove crouching because people use it to BM 20x more than people who actually crouch.
---
Something tells me it still wouldn't last more than a minute for me.
---
I think ruin is fine as is, the totem spawns need work though
---
Idk but Michael is so evil he can resist the entity which is cool.
---
I once saw Ghostface x Meyers there and I've been trying my hardest to repress that memory ever since
---
So I come back after yet another break too the new DLC and low and behold it's a fucking mess....... Seriously getting sick of playing a game that always has something wrong with it.
---
Gotta get a squeeze in when you can
---
Whenever I try to farm with survivors they just don't fucking get it. Like, how many times do I have to smack this fucking rock and let you wiggle free before you realize I'm not trying to fucking kill you?
---
Most games that I set out with the intention of farming, I just end up killing everyone because they just don't get it and I give up.
---
If you DC from the game it will also say that the killer DCd and everyone escaped.
---
In reality though, the game might still be going on.
---
This makes me want a Predator chapter
---
they should put stamina on survivor . like they can run alot at first, but slowing them by time
---
It didn't backfire though, you just remembered you took a mori lol
---
When  you're so bad you can't even facecamp
---
mostly animation time. it takes a second now, it used to take 4
---
also, while the games is a "horror" game, they didn't want to make it actually terrifying. Just look at the current designs on basicly everything
---
He has no map pressure and no way to move around faster and only has 4 bottles normally.
---
Survivors can also just go to another loop spot.
---
Clown is clearly meant to be good at chases but he sucks at that and he also moves slower when throwing bottles which defeats the whole purpose of the power he really needs a rework or a buff.
---
And that's why killers dodge bully with friends.
---
You my friend clearly haven't played the game enough
---
Me and my friends were farming with a hag, and we were sitting at the exit gates and seeing who would leave first, I did right before a time like this and all three of them died lmao.
---
I play the game how I want to. Filthy survivor mains who only want the killer to be a punching bag have no say in it.
---
I've run across my fair share of really bad players across all ranks.
---
He can oneshot from any distance with a homing missle
---
The new map for ruin is difficult to find. hawkings lab. Im still trying to find the spots
---
Filthy survivor mains can't tell me how to play.
---
Wow a Claudette that didn’t dc? That’s a rare breed.
---
4 toolboxes + Prove Thyself SFW squad is my worst nightmare
---
“We believe that these locations should provide optimal coverage for most regions. If none of these locations are near you, you will still be able to play the game and have the same experience as before. “
---
I had this problem the other day. I was chasing injured Claudette, and I'm right on her ass. she ran up to the hex totem, teabagged, then started cleansing it just before she goes down. ~15 feet from a hook. a gen pops as I hook her, and BBQ shows all 3 susrvivors sprinting straight at the hook. so I go nowhere while the whole team swarms, playing musical hooks and failing to bait me into an obvious strong looping spot. they all end up dead with 4 gens to go, and never did get the hex. I then receive 2 PSN friend requests informing me what a shameful cheater I am. 
---
No idea how they got above rank 10 with such bad skills and perks, but here we are.
---
&gt;The DBD community seems very leftist. 
---
Most subreddit communities are, from what I've seen.  Even the news and politics subreddits.
---
Is there any lore on how Michael actually got into the entity’s realm? Did he choose to go or was he like asked and went or something or was he forced?
---
This is likely sarcasm, but for those of you who actually want to know:

---
Periodically enabling additional regions to test the impact on match quality
---
Because they use teamwork?
---
What happened to "Noed is fine, your supposed to work as a team and break all the totems."
---
Plenty of issues with SWF - Sharing the ruin location? Not one of them.
---
Honestly, survs could use a chatbox or some form of better communication - They are supposed to be a team after all.
---
He entered the realm by chance and felt home, ghostface already knew about the entity.
---
The longer they stay alive the more survivors run into your sex dungeon.

---
Now the daily recommended sodium consumption is no more than 1500-2300mg so make sure as the killer you dont play anymore than 23 games well in a day because you are gonna get a lot of sodium from those ganes if you play with that setup
---
I think he wanted to kill Laurie and she got dragged into the realm
---
At least with pig you can teabag back after downing them
---
It’s not comparable to people saying that crouching should be removed..... it’s obviously a glitch and will be fixed soon it’s just the people bitching about it are the ones who wait in the exit gate to spam tbag
---
The entity dislikes Michael because he kills the survivors instead of sacrificing them
---
Well fuck you and your daily I guess.
---
If you're over web level 40 more perks will appear. 3 and then after 50, 4.
---
yes they reworked the blood webs with the stranger things chapter release to offer 3 perks at 40-49, and four perks at 50+
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/da5x21/wtf_why_cant_i_pick_up_a_survivor_if_there/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Clown. Meyers. Hag. Spirit. Nea.
---
True, but let's assume the killer is nearby and your gen is at 90% progression. In that case i would start tapping that last 10% to ensure either a completed generator or, at least, some insured progress that could be thwarted by a skill check.
---
Me too, I meant that in a good way. It's what I like about DBD too, not just murda murda murda, but lots of ridiculousness as well.
---
Issue number one: Possible running it with Haunted Ground and 2 other hex totems would require 6 totems to be on the map
---
Issue number two: many survivors still claim it's overpowered
---
Issue number three: New totem spots are actually decent
---
Issue number four: It's the risk factor of it. Ruin's job is to **possibly** slow the game down *(just a lil' bit)* during the early game.
---
I just started during the free weekend, why do people disconnect after their first down? Rage?
---
I'm pretty sure the entity just kinda grabbed Michael although Michael is said to have no soul and be the embodiment of evil so he could probably leave if he wanted
---
Okay, well, sorry, but again, people with a gap like that honestly should be barred from pairing together. Some of the old situations were absolutely egregious.
---
Dude just spat a lot of mean shit and merciless insults in response.
---
When i'm feeling extra toxic ill knock them down and keep them slugged until they bleed out. Then I'll camp everyone else, only if it's face camping though. GG EZ. Bubba with insidious is the best ya'll.
---
Exactly, I think DBD might do crossover with AHS 1984 IMO, seeing as they just did stranger things
---
I understand why they did it but it’s still pretty
---
for Bond
---
I can agree with most of that but strodes map is were i disagree that map he can use his lunges pretty decntly at the fence chases and his portals can have some great hiding locations such as in the houses in a room most will fail to see but is close to a gen
---
I usually play survivor, but I occasionally play trapper and I had ruin on Hawkins,  behind a door on the third floor.  It was crazy good.  Definitely a spot to look

Dark Souls 2 has absurdly bad hitboxes.  It's fact at this point.
---
Steve players who use the Scoops hat and shirt and the jeans are in S.
---
I personally hate double bloodpoints events. 
---
Killer queues take hours. 
---
Survivors are more interested in farming than in playing the game. 
---
Many people with internet connections that are too terrible to play the killer still choose to play the killer.
---
Friendly killers are driving me crazy.
---
People calling you out on being "toxic" cuz you're playing Hag during a "farm event"
---
Just fuck off everyone and let me play the fucking game. Get yourself a farming sim and stop wasting my time.
---
The only thing driving a rift between players is the BP disparity. Survivors have to do 10x more shit to get 1/5th the points. So until that's resolved the salt will get much worse.
---
It’s too cute to be cursed

Not people, ghouls *

I'm not sure if it's enough but it's close
---
Hahah jerk. You got me.
---
Ah yes, Wolverine and Edward Scissor Hands my two favourite Dead By Daylight characters and Horror mascots
---
The issue with this game is all the imaginary rules both killers and survivors have come up with. Survivors can't loop the killer, can't run the meta perks, can't teabag, can't flashlight while the killer is destroying a pallet. Killers can't tunnel, Run noed, Facecamp (I obviously don't say that Killers should do this but it's not against the rules to do it) Can't run whatever addons they want. i'm sure you know i could keep going with atleast 200 more imaginary rules for survivors and the same goes for killers.
---
There is no damn rules and people can play however they want and from my experience it's the Survivors and Killers that hold onto these imaginary rules that are the most toxic and just won't let it go if those "rules" are being broken. You can think they are assholes for not following your "rules" But keep it to yourself for the love of god they are not doing anything wrong.
---
So satisfying. Fuck that Claudette
---
Just start timing him. My crew is pretty vicious and will let you know exactly how long you looped for, but boy howdy does it make you get better.
---
Mortality clarified in a single strike
---
Clown stuck by, Myers was probably chasing Laurie, Hag was dying, spirit was dead and looking for revenge, ghostface just wanted to join the club... And Nea IS the entity.
---
Death waits for the slightest lapse in concentration.
---
Me when the killer asks me if I wanna farm but ends up killing me instead
---
Oh god I love how you put it
---
Teammates who don't do gens, and teammates who dont save you until youre about to die on hook. The worst.
---
he either was going to give me another chance by hooking me or he forgot that he had a mori either way by her doing that killed me
---
This was me yesterday getting sandbagged by all three of my teammates
---
More blood soaks the soil, feeding the evil therein.
---
This is such a great clip!
---
This makes me happy
---
I kinda love how this sub is quite left leaning. Rare among nowadays "gamers"
---
I love the idea for multiple weapons! Jason Voorhees is just the character to do it, plus, it fits his character.
---
This happened to me and I died on my first hook in the basement, the full 2 minutes my teammates refused to rescue me, even though they were right next to me, even when the killer was obviously downing someone across the map, they didnt even go down the stairs.
---
You kinda deserved it if you wanted to BM the killer tbh
---
Note a key word on this before judgement being Try
---
Start of most games: I'm going to play chill, and I don't care about survival or beating the killer. Let's just roleplay and get all the totems and chests. We can all have fun, and the killer can get me whenever.
---
*Baby Dweet getting tunneled off hook noises

For all the people saying "Karma" or "Next time don't be toxic" how the fuck are we supposed to know the killer wasn't also being toxic?
---
Gee. It's like killer pays about 5x the BP for half the work and everyone wants to play them. I wonder why the lobbies are bogged down. Here I am on surv I can get a match in 10 seconds. Shame it doesn't pay shit.
---
Yep cuts the grind in half to get all the perks on a character now from Level 50 webs
---
Yeah which shouldn’t be possible but he’s just too evil for the entity to control I think... is that right?
---
Ohh okay that makes sense
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/da61fk/is_matchmaking_broken/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Plague, Spirit, Clown, Hag, Doctor and Myers disagree. 
---
Demogorgon just kinda wandered in like ?????? Food ?????
---
Please,  I would love to see proof of this “funding”. The photo people seem to think she had with Soros was fake.
---
Oh man, freddy has always been the tunnel king hasn't he, at least he still has no counter to ds
---
u have to get 12 hooks overall...:/
---
What difference does it make, I swear autoheaven, farm and estate are the only fucking maps in this game
---
I didn't have a daily. I was winding down before bed after a day of killing for double blood, just doing some surviving lol so I decided well might as well try to play around with him 😂
---
Honestly when I play Hag, I come across so many survivors who don't know how to play effectively against me and I almost always feel guilty as hell for getting 4kills, so yeh. That hatch ;)
---
I think the implication is the Entity saw how he was literally evil personified, and then snatched him up at the end of Halloween where he’s been shot out of the Doyle house by Loomis. The lore doesn’t actually mention how or when the Entity took Myers or Laurie, but I think this is the implication. I don’t think Myers has any problem being in the Entity’s realm.
---
Just use decisive strike
---
I hate it cause it just encourages you to depip and if not matchmaking takes forever
---
Had a Rank 2 Wraith with NOED and Unrelenting DC yesterday. Feels
---
Sucks, man. But it beats the old way where a rank 15 killer will get matched with a group of red ranks and one ranked 17 guy. Not even the reds are having fun in that game.
---
Got greedy, honestly throwing the pallet may have move your hitbox closer allowing that to hit.
---
Pretty good, keep it up
---
r/unexpected
---
Damn, I did this as a pig but without the petting part, you gave me some great ideas
---
I dont enjoy not having a killer power (leatherface)
---
smashed through head. critical hit
---
Dude you just posted cringe
---
I don’t think Myers has a problem with it either but he just doesn’t like to listen to the entity’s rules and he’ll kill rather than sacrifice if he wants
---
Yo.....what about cropsey tho?
---
You right
---
awwwww so cute!!
---
A non-hex version of NOED could be interesting.
---
The worst is when they are all on gens when you get downed, and them when you are picked up, they all stop, and crouch near the Gen.
---
Wait for you to die on hook, then resume.
---
I mean auras are magic, basically... so idk
---
so many questions, so little answers.  only a sack of assumptions
---
Just tunnel people who bring keys and you won’t have to waste a perk slot on Franklin’s.
---
Billy’s actually a tough one to facecamp against too, lol.
---
If you tell them that it's the objective of the game. They will say it's the objective to kill you... it is but the way you do it is very ineffective and not fun for anyone.
---
You dont get to choose a server tho?
---
How was I greedy lol, that was my only option
---
I don't play with him because we share a ps4 but he's much worse than he thinks he is
---
A perk is generally a lot more valuable than an add-on, getting to use 4 perks + prayer beads &gt; 3 perks and Distressing + a different add-on (usually)
---
Yup ,he's the one killer who can disobey the entity
---
Why do you have the purple fastening tools below the green version? The purple one is better in everyway.
---
its ok, no reason for you to wait till end anyway.
---
Ghostface is a bad killer but every person I play with is too braindead to reveal him.
---
I've done this before, it's great
---
maybe animation stun make him stuck and dced
---
kind of well deserved tbh
---
Wow this is a comment that someone actually wrote out
---
They’re going to have to fix matchmaking then. Also sometime the game crashes, and looks like a dc. Do we penalize that?
---
In a way that could be way more savage. Notice he's playing DBD? Wait for him to start a chase. Start timing. As soon as he goes down, from behind him say, "Yeah that chase was 15 seconds."
---
In my opinion monstrous us bad no matter what. You won’t get more blood points because people can’t get survivors quick enough to get 3 hooks per person
---
At least you use party streamer as a "sorry" gift
---
This game doesn't reward you with your points if the killer dc's in game?
---
Spirit and hag was dead or dying. for the other's, the entity found them and brought them and they enjoyed after knowing the place. Ghostface was: can I join?
---
I'm just here for the comments
---
Logical application of new mechanics being applied to under powered killers? Not with Behavior on the case!
---
I just started playing him after leveling up most of the others and he seems pretty solid to me. The add on that mutes your hearbeat is brutal. I just uncloak behind something and I catch them working the gen every time. I played against him once and he was using that with the coxcomb clapper and it was nerve wracking. Added bonus, you're not playing douchebag Ghostface.
---
People will derank regardless of this change. It just means people have to put more effort into bullying low rank players. I got so sick and tired of playing against newbie killers over the last week. This is a much better alternative.
---
You're having game crashes? I haven't had one in a year.
---
Sharing ruin location, location of the killer, location of hatch, percentage on gens, if someone is going for the save, status on gates, location of other surviors, used pallets, how many totem there are left, killer perks, survivor perks, surv items.
---
Communication is a big problem. The game was built around Survs having no communication.
---
I wonder if it'll be fixed
---
Level 18 dwight's? What lol? So you're getting bullied by rank 20s?
---
Nope, its my trapper. It's a very unique build that only I have. BBQ, ruin ... oh wait...
---
Still it was me though
---
i guess the Entity really liked that Claudette
---
Lmao id love to but hed just get mad at me and honestly its not worth it
---
He fell asleep on the couch and woke up like “guess I live here now”.  But most of the rest of the cast knew what they signed up for. I’d argue back Plague was brought in by lies.
---
One suggestion I saw was to make it so you could disable your tr for a short time by pressing a button
---
Bruh hahahaha this just happened to me last night same thing ol leather boi camping the gate, and I'm tea bagging his ass while the trap door is right behind me.... And then the timer skipped to the end😂😂😂
---
Killer crashed a few times, they messaged me asking why I dc’d. I was thoroughly confused. So I guess lucky you, but matchmaking needs some love after the last update. I stay in loading screen while my wife gets added to a lobby.
---
Trying to survive as the survivor is toxic, this subreddit contains so much wisdom
---
That Myers part. Makes me feel in ecstasy too, that shit is sooooooooooooooooooooooooo *SATISFYING*
---
WHERRE ARE HIS NIPPLES?!?! LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE!!!!!
---
People (the killer) just get fed up. I'm not talking got outplayed. I'm talking losing because of voice coms and gen repair times. When you finish every chase in 10 seconds and chain bbq downs all game like a mass murderer and still have 4 escaping off gen rush and adrenaline
---
someone's never been in a detroit lions game thread
---
Ranking does NOTHING except have you play against more try-hards. There is zero point to say you got to rank one. No matter how well you play, you are always going to have people complain on both sides if they lost.
---
Oof ouch this is awkward
---
i mean, he legit waited for a full minute for someones ds after they got unhooked. he intentionally played like a scum bag because he was upset he wasnt doing well. it wasnt his objective to "kill someone" he wanted  to ruin someones times. he said it himself.
---
I mean yeah people always say hex ruin op a little tip every time you hit a hex ruin skill check stop for a 3 seconds then continue to do the gen if you continue to stay on the gen then it increases your chances of getting hit with another skill check
---
Distortion sure is working wonders!
---
That new white sweater chick should be atleast A tier too, steves aren't that bad tho
---
News and politics aren't real subreddits. They're outrage simulators.
---
They do penalize them lol. In emblem and blood points
---
inb4 head on, quick and quiet, ds
---
Francis I think
---
Spirit still had the option tho. It was a pact, she didn't need to agree.
---
"He smiled in anticipation" he know what was happening. Him and the hag is the only killers that already know about the entity.
---
Nah that wasn’t greedy. killer was just the better player /s. This won’t be fixed/better until dedicated servers are polished and released.
---
Please take all of the upvotes. Please.
---
lauren aint that ugly
---
Ash mains who are toxic are the least groovy people on Earth. Those guys aren’t true Ash mains, it’s all a ruse.
---
Well yes, but her primary objective is to get revenge.
---
Some people pair it with Quick and Quiet if you intend to use it mid-chase as sort of a poor man’s insta-heal. You could use Head On too if you’re worried about being interrupted but I think it’s fairly useless as long as it remains an Exhaustion perk. 
---
As someone who thinks Small Game is a bit underrated, I actually really enjoy it with IS.
---
Hello ebony, franklins and discordance
---
think about how actually terrifying that would be if New Moon offerings still existed
---
SALT THE WOUNDS, STRIP THE FLESH!
---
Its moments like this that makes me wonder why I even bother to try to save randoms
---
They won't know. You have to add them before the match or you're not farming efficiently.
---
&gt; The killer was so thirsty for a 4k he let the other one go near bleed out.
---
If hatch wasn't based on luck so much and didn't encourage hatch campers this wouldn't be the case

Try downing a survivor and repeatedly dropping them. That survivor should realize you’re friendly and the others will all see that as well. They usually flock to me like little baby ducklings when I do that.
---
He angry as fucc
---
Why didn't you just say so, you filthy survivor main
---
What do u expect if the game is broken and nothing works?
---
Gold/silver/bronze trophies are weighted differently
---
Love those colors, the light on the mask is really popping.  
---
This is making me want to practice with my own tablet.
---
Its a cheese but i just jump on n off n on so i dont get the skill check lol
---
I'm not sure how it works but if you are from NA you get NA region servers right? If you are from EU you get EU region servers and wherever else they have their servers located. If not a lot of people from NA are playing, queue times longer. Same for all the other regions. Then it also factors on Xbox, PS4 and Switch. From what i have heard queue times are way longer there because the playerbase is not as big as PC. So a lot of things factors in. I have easily played killer for 3-4 hours today and my longest queue time was 5 minutes.
---
Especially with this blood hunt. Every game there are at least 2 with toolboxes and the other 2 have flashlights or medkits.
---
Yeah it would be a fun little gimmick perk to play in a meme game but I wouldn't use it in my rank reset build
---
Yea it’s always sad when your at green ranks and those people who think their noob03 after watching one of his videos are kinda sad
---
Wrong, Z is also accurate, 1/10 literally unreadable.
---
What exactly doesn't work?
---
PSN trophies are weird. Bronze trophies give a smaller percent towards completion while silvers and golds give more. I have no idea why they decided to do it that way but it looks weird when you have 25/50 trophies for a game but the bar says 38% because most of the remaining ones are silver and gold.
---
Yup. And The Clown. And Ghostface. And The Legion.
---
I actually remember a game as bing bong boi I was chasing a quinten I exited stealth he used dead hard but the burst of speed let me hit him then he DC’D (i was normal wraith and rank 16 three people DC’D and no I didn’t tunnel or camp)
---
They’re *mostly* true, too.
---
\+monitor, 4 stacks on furtive and prayer beads :)
---
I can tell the people who gave me negatives are leatherface mains that most likely camp
---
I remember that, but I wonder if the Bloodweb update (including more perks) is impacted.
---
That doesn't justify ruining the survivors bloodpoint harvest or making them lose their items just because the killer is too arrogant to admit they lost. And instead of moving on they decide that in a last ditch attempt to sabotage the survivors work. It's no justifiable it's pretty and childish
---
This has happened to me before I was about to run out but nope I had to get my *neck snapped*
---
Wraith doesn't have to be disowned. He can dissapear. Making him the dad.
---
 SiWF on comms using insta-heals that's what happened.
---
\- The Entety-Timer is totally off  
---
\- Lobby still sucks (disconnects, ppl arent in the "before-game-lobby" and getting kicked out  
---
\- Matchmacking is still fckd up  
---
Wanna hear more?
---
Thanks but it was a joke. Someone had to say it at some point. Sorry for the misleading
---
Like, I am Sorry for mentioning but why do you start flashing so early XD battery draining or you cant aim really fast? Sry tho
---
Yeah that would be awesome but the production value would be garbage probably
---
Pretty much what i said and i got negatives but i wouldnt doubt that the ones who did give me negatives are most likely the camping leatherfaces

if the killer is getting that mad so he leaves mid-game causing everyone to get screwed over he should stop playing for a while and play another game
---
There was a super good Myers. I was doing a gen with two other survivors and look up at the nearby Temple -- he's standing there, stalking us. I start pointing, but neither he nor the survivors care, so I start running. Five seconds later, the other survivors are being stabbed to death.
---
At the end of the game, I'm the last hooked, but it was my first time, so we're just standing (hanging) there, staring at each other. I start raving with my hands. He starts raving with his head. We rave until I die, and even then, spine chill says he's still head-bobing. It was so damn funny that I wasn't even upset about the death.
---
Why are killers bringing Moris and tunneling during blood hunt
---
imo the only killers who don't need ruin are all the S tier ones and ghostface
---
Well, at least he didn't use the mori without absolutely having to. That Feng play would've been pretty clutch had it not been for that.
---
Biometric Sightseer:

Be able to see a fully healed survivor in a radius of 20/25/30 Meters away for 5/6/7 seconds.
---
This is a repost
---
2 killers?
---
Tittle is double appropriate
---
Points themselves technically have nothing to do with rank. There's a correlation between getting more points and getting more emblem progress but they aren't really connected at all. They don't even fit the same categories. For example totems count towards boldness bloodpoints and towards the objective emblem.
---
New to reddit?
---
I mean,you're not wrong lmao
---
It all kind of evens out.
---
Survivor get into matches faster and gets points faster in small quantities (unless you do everything in order to get 8000 on most categories)
---
And killer you wait longer and earn slower but get huge amounts.
---
god i love corrupt intervention, its so underrated and its really nice to have
---
I agree, IS, Small Game, Quick and Quiet, and Head On are definitely the way to go.
---
Nice!
---
It's a bug that loads 2 killers and 3 survivors.
---
Overrated perk, so many ways to counter it.
---
Does it effects the lung attack?
---
Hey, I think I’ve seen this porno before!
---
Ive seen some aggressive shit on this sub too lmao
---
"Excuse me spider-alien-spikey creature, would you have room in your ranks for a ghosty-boy who loves to stalk-n-stab?"
---
&gt; and now he has a 100% guaranteed counter to borrowed time?
---
this is blatantly untrue
---
He is absolutely not a bad killer, one of the top killers actually. I'd only put Nurse, Billy, Spirit and Freddy above him. Him and Daddy Myers are probably the same level
---
That's what you get for tbagging.
---
Ahhhhh, I see. You want the survivors to gain max BP, so you bring hex totems that give more BP for cleansing. Nice!
---
I don't know, i find a match as survivor in like 2 mins max, as killer i have to wait like 20 mins to start a lobby.
---
Seems to me like people play killer less
---
I’m sorry what perk is IS
---
PLEASE
---
Would you say it was Bill’ Bizarre Adventure?
---
That's cool but can be a pain in the butt

Really? Weird I thought I was the one who created it, considering I did it this morning may I see a link to the OG post
---
*N U T*
---
How does one acquire this bug
---
I had a game the other day where neither the killer nor I could find the hatch for like 10 minutes. It just didnt spawn. Then I finished a gen and the endgame timer didnt run down for me at all.
---
Hail To the king baby...
---
&gt;  Considering the wake up is usually across the map
---
from where the rescuer is, which has nothing to do with where the hooked person is. Could be on the same side of the map. And there are other methods to wake up
---
&gt; or you’re getting chased and want to save a friend before he dies?
---
imagine thinking it's okay to unhook someone as you're being chased lul (unless you're the last two people ofc, and in that instance BT won't matter)
---
Anyway, if killers have to deal with instaheals and SWF and keys survivors can deal with Freddy countering BT
---
My game has crashed during killer before yea
---
Afton's Reign:
---
When all generators are power, you will be able to see sprinting survivors from a radius of 35/40/45 Meters. You will also be able to see the aura of a survivor unlocking an exit gate that is 50/45/40 Percent done.
---
Your games take twice as long because you're farming.
---
It cancels out except that you don't even get to actually play
---
'It's a feature, not a bug" -probably Behavior
---
Love the idea but they would have to remove SWF from it so it's fair on survivors and killers alike. Because if you're not picking your own builds then you can't prep for SWF. 
---
I'd play this all the time.
---
Okay, just wondering if it was crashing or just killers ninja dcing
---
nope, but you don't lose stacks with the shred.
---
P3 + Biker jacket + P2 is my go to outfit :’)
---
Hate how much I have to rely on ruin and it gets popped to quickly.
---
Because of that I basically have to run only 3 perks
---
I guess so,cause I go straight to the main menu and it says “Server disconnected from host”,it happened to me and my friend 3 times and we both didn’t gain any points
---
I didn't. The youtuber who posted it did
---
Imagine we are playing tennis. Except in this universe if you have an s a w and an f in your name you win regardless of outcome. When you beat me 12 to 0 and make me look like a noob I still win because I have certain letters in my name. And don't complain that having letters in my name has nothing to do with my skill or who actually won. I won get good noob.
---
For some reason we both didn’t get points
---
So I can safely down the obsession without losing tokens?
---
Uh, no? Did you even watch the video?
---
if you use the lunge, then yes.

The main reason I've DCd this event is when stupid survivors assume that I'm going to farm, just cause there are 3+ streamers up. That's great, let's play a normal fucking match. If your gonna be so idiotic to assume that I'm gonna farm even after I try to show you IN-GAME that I'm not gonna farm or I try to fucking message you and tell you I'm not farming. 
---
It happens so often that I've decided if I see it again I'm dcing and taking everyone's offerings. That I don't feel bad about.
---
I've been kicked out the game about 4 times tonight as survivor, the name spouting it being "network connection" but my internet has been perfectly fine. Wth
---
I feel sorry for whoever would have to write a 1hr 30min script using DBDs lore.  
---
That's a rough gig
---
Interesting that it doesn't apply to other killers I wonder why
---
Yeah, especially if he was afk
---
One time a guy told me to kys in a message after I won as the killer. For the next 30 days strait I messaged him more than 100 times each day  like he was my best friend. Eventually my account was banned for harassment. But man oh mighty did it feel good to wake up in the morning to "Hey it's me again buddy, hows the hemorrhoids treating you?" from all that butt hurt shit talking you do I bet it's been acting up a lot.
---
I think that would make him about perfect.
---
I mostly play killer and haven't noticed. Then again, I have been off for a few days.
---
Its not an opinion, its a fact.
---
Is monitor on spirit a thing? She already sneaks up with the phasing
---
I would record but my computer doesn’t do well with it, only thing I’ve tried is streaming with obs but it’s super low quality.
---
I'm not a tryhard gamer and don't prepare for the swf anyway. I would take the option to have it regardless.  You could always choose not to use it.
---
Everyone is telling this guy to change his list, but this is HIS experience, not yours.
---
100% this. This is one of those days where I just got sick of losing to coordinated teams cause I decided I didn't wanna play nurse, billy spirit w/ meta builds. Don't mind getting outplayed and I do pretty well at recognizing when I make mistakes, but just like my last match when you have a really quick first chase only to see 3 gens pop it just makes you wonder why fuckin bother?
---
Because of that exact reason
---
Killers rarely say gg after a loss as well. Guess both sides do the same thing.
---
Clown would most definitely be the weird uncle that gives you "treats".
---
Also wraith Pig and Ghost are hard counters to BT
---
Thanks for the clairdiation!
---
Hex : Spring Failure
---
Applies onto any Hex totem, after hitting survivor. If the survivor is 30/25/20 Meters away. Hex : Spring Failure will activate making the action to run and fast vault 2/4/6 slower.
---
The Hex stays on the map until cleansed by a survivor.
---
that's what I've been doing, I just carry them to the center of the map and drop them or look for their allies and give them back their idiot.
---
As a killer main, I can confirm that those teammates were useless.

Survivor hand book hall monitor detected \^\^

Survivor: Brings an INSTAHEAL and prove thyself
---
Ghostface who just marked them: PARRY THIS YOU FUCKING CAUSAL
---
This isn't even a farming thing. Like killers will get obliterated in game by survivors and just dc. This causes the survivors to get no bloodpoints and loose their items. It might just be a PS4 thing but ive lost close to 200,000 bloodpoints already from DC killers. I lose my items, my offerings, and my bloodpoints.
---
Just mini edits I thought would help! :&gt;
---
Good point.
---
I've noticed this too why are match searches so long all of a sudden it started happening to me when the stranger things Chapter released
---
Hence why I left mid-game.
---
In all seriousness, it's not right, but it happens when we get frustrated, it happens to every single player who plays this game. They get pushed just a little too far and they play toxic or DC or whatever.
---
It’s the best out of the current bunch imo, she kinda looks different with it tho i can’t explain it.
---
Is this real or a glitch? I love that
---
This one was a lot harder to come up then the killer ones, but I hope you all enjoy this ideas!
---
You don't do it for blood points.
---
WGLF doesn’t really require you to get into immense danger. The unhook has to be a safe rescue so you should wait until it’s safe and rewards you for something you should do anyways. Plus if you were in danger you could get double tokens for it in a second.
---
Mostly for getting ready to prestige but
---
It’s only because im all out at the moment, I like running windup addons because they make huntress feel S tier
---
My apologies I was a little confused of how it worked.  But it’s a counter that takes 0 skill and is honestly unfair.  His PASSIVE power creates a counter to an anti tunneling perk.
---
Don't have Franklin's  or Discordance:(
---
What an idiotic perk set, BBQ literally does the same thing as thrilling tremors you don't need both
---
"it's your turn to play the game now"
---
I get just as many tokens as survivor as killer. I really don’t get it. The only category that sucks is survival because idk how tf to get that maxed, but boldness, obj, and altruism aren’t too hard to do. I’m really surprised how easy it was to get to and maintain Rank 1 as survivor, especially having only played for a month.
---
Now its different when literally everybody's there it's not really camping but if you patrol a little and dont see anybody but stay close to the hook thats camping to me
---
I'm not defending the bug, I'm just saying if survivors should know the risk when they choose to be altruistic.
---
I think each or Evey few episodes should focus on a trio of killers with the first season focusing on the original trio Trapper Wraith and Billy
---
He has built in Noed... why would he need to bring that lololol
---
Some people find point farming to be boring. Personally I don't mind goofing around but I don't want to just do a gen while the killer stares at me, or trade unhooks.
---
I just got this with demo
---
&gt;  But it’s a counter that takes 0 skill and is honestly unfair.
---
I mean, this game is full of stuff like that. I mentioned it in another comment to you, but this is also true of shit like instaheals. And moris. And keys.
---
and it's not unfair. It's strong. That's not the same thing
---
I do think BT should be based on proximity rather than terror radius, though
---
I want one to react to a baby crying
---
Legend
---
Yeah match making has been iffy lately, and honestly for a while. It’s being worked on atleast so hopefully it doesn’t last much longer
---
This analogy makes no sense. 
---
SWF are frustrating cause an optimal one will output more than you can. survivors can do 3/5 of their objective at one time whereas the killer 1/6. There is already a disparity between a good team, but good killers of varying tiers can still beat good teams. 
---
An optimal SWF however? Only Nurse, Spirit and Billy (on certain maps) can beat them, and you have to be playing to tip-top of your ability to do so. I'm not here to argue balance cause that's not what this conversation is. I'm slightly explaining why they aren't fun to play against.
---
Sounds like your brother has a detrimentally fragile ego.
---
This is what is called, sucking.
---
Lol he pre swung cause he knew you'd drop the pallet, the counter to this is simply running through it and getting another loop.
---
I’m fine with her dying, pain in the ass to play against
---
It's just started today for me
---
Don't worry I get my fair share of Ormond and forests too just to rub it in even more, but on estate you can still play like 75% of them decently and on the farm you can get lucky with torment creek or rancid abattoir but god forbid you actually pick the pool with blood lodge *eugh*
---
Okay. A cave map sounds awesome but the creatures just arent iconic enough in my opinion
---
You could run through, since all killers can pre swing in anticipation of a pallet drop.
---
Believe what you want, I'm not here to play by made up survivor rules. If you don't want to be tunneled and camped then don't give the killer a reason to, it's one thing if they do it normally, but now you are bringing a item that further encourages it.
---
Because it's funny lol. People's reactions are usually disproportionate to the actions themselves.
---
I was bagging once and the killer watched me for like 20 seconds. After the game he was like "why are you wasting time" like I was holding the game hostage or something.
---
Then go back to the first slug, they can't rescue and body block another person at the same time.
---
Immediately into the dying state
---
Pretty much.  Seems to just be where people vent and meme about stuff.
---
No its random. I made this post because yesterday i missed it because i wasn't expecting it to be at the start of the circle. It was at the 5 o'clock position.
---
its miserable playing killer during this bloodhunt with the queue times being garbage, i mean yeah i could play survivor but oh my GOD i literally get a bowl of gelatin laid on a keyboard as teammates
---
I never got around to finding out how to actually do it, but it was related to the SWF (Survive With Friends) and KYF (Kill Your Friends) features, although I believe it's been effectively fixed since the 3.2.0 patch, where they changed how forming a SWF group works.  
---
Basically, you can't do it anymore. Any footage you see of it was recorded before the 3.2.0 patch.
---
I mean I get it from both ends. I had a game just a bit ago where I got fucked out of 3 gens way too fast and there wasn't I could have done differently to prevent that. I was done with this game so I said fuck it I'm out. Survivors do the same thing if they see have a bad team or just don't like the killer. If we get pushed a bit too much we get angry and leave. Everybody does it at different points in this game and that's normal but definitely frustrating.
---
If survivors got more points then there wouldnt be long killer queues.
---
Yes. I haven't played the game in like 4 months and i'm pretty shit
---
Generally the higher your rank the harder it is to find a game. Im rank 8 killer but rank 2 survivor
---
1. Bloodwarden is useful. 2. There is a limit to how useful perks that affect the endgame can be considering they only effect the endgame.
---
I love how we live in a time where people have to tell others that they're using sarcasm.
---

Just go to each individual folder and replace the Qatar folder e.g Qatar perks go into perks-&gt;qatar
---
No, you can just run borrowed time and unless the person stands still you will get your stack.
---
Don't look a gift horse in the teeth.
---
If you don't want the points, just walk at them and they'll likely leave. End game collapse will also take care of them.
---
I love these memes, but I feel like the games community changed so much from when I used to play.
---
The Claudette picked up the med kit with insta heal
---
Yes they fucking are.
---
Why does it need to be 'iconic' ? The creature is awesome on its own it doesn't need to be 'iconic'
---
Possible insta in chest? Idk thats messed up tho the fuck
---
Shouldn't have messed around.
---
Iv never heard such a noobie comment.
---
Alright bruh... that survivor is being healed, you can pick him up because hes literally got a survivor on top of him... ya follow?
---
This is the easiest shit to figure out but try attacking the survivor doing said healing....
---
You have these things called wasd keys please incorporate them into your gameplay.
---
Can you believe this guy lol?
---
Right? I don't understand why survivors waste so much time especially when the killer is afk.
---
Yeah, too bad they fked up sounds again.
---
At least I can hear killers steps clear as day as Survivor...
---
Which perk are you talking about?
---
It probably evens out
---
Weird. Imma check it out.
---
Can you explain the three other times I hit her, then?
---
the killer was afk and the match wasn't 10 minutes long so I dont get 600 xp
---
I see people talking about SWF ruining the game, honestly SWF doesn't even matter until red ranks. SWF below that are just friends who want to have a good time and play DBD together. Red ranks SWF are people who often times only know each other online and only care about winning as fast as possible, preferably while humiliating the killer player like they're a second class citizen. 
---
Personally I have mostly stopped playing killer for the remainder of the blood hunt. Without exaggerating, 7/10 of my games are those toxic SWF groups. (Even though BHVR claims SWF is like 5% of games or some bologna) And while I don't condone disconnecting, camping or tunneling (that's just being toxic) I definitely understand your frustration. You can play extremely well and still barely scrape out a 2K sometimes. I just got out of a game against a ghostface and legitimately felt bad for him. The game ended in 4 minutes and he only got a kill because of noed.
---
this may not be what i had in mind but i'll allow it
---
Maybe she thought she could be nice and 1 for 1.
---
It amazes me how hard players in this game work to put a negative connotation on something that is harmless or good.
---
I love how Trap Dad's add-ons are essentially just sensible QoL updates
---
How do you hold two people in the basement considering they fixed the collision boxes to where it is impossible to block people in the basement?
---
Good
---
I think I used the wrong word, I edited the original comment to match what I was thinking
---
I was playing as the Doctor yesterday. Game loads, and it’s Haddonfield. I spot two survivors, they see me, and immediately DC. I quickly find the remaining two and start hooking them, but then I see them signaling to me to come over. It took me a few minutes, but I figured out that they wanted to farm. So we spent the next 15 minutes going from gen to gen. They’d fix it, I’d break it, repeat. Then I’d chase them for a bit, hit em, hook em, and let em heal, repeat. I also stood under pallets so they could drop them on me, and they let me shock them. In the end, I let them go, and we all got a fuckton of BPs.
---
&gt; Communication is a big problem. The game was built around Survs having no communication.
---
Yet we can't nerf top killers because communication exists in half the games?
---
They won't stop allowing people to play with friends - So add more communication and balance around it.
---
Obviously things like object of obsession (Fuck that perk) can just be deleted from the game.
---
----
---
Also as a sidenote - As someone who runs aftercare I usually know most of the important things you listed but gen percent.
---
Used pallets are never going to get called out regardless 
---
"Oh i used the one by the car."
---
"Which car"
---
"The one in the middle"
---
"Which one there is 3"
---
....
---
------
---
The thing is right now we have point (which is already "Killer is over there" btw) and "Follow me."
---
You either want to balance around survs having teamwork and communication or you don't.
---
You can't just have OP shit running around with the excuse that "Oh some groups can communicate" because all that does is encourage those without groups to form them.
---
Im have the same experience as you, except NA.  They used to be awful during summer, but things are mostly fixed
---
That works too. I usually just wait till it’s safer so I can live long enough to get all 4 stacks.
---
An important lesson for killer is learning not everything is worth chasing, it's better to wait until they're out in the open for you to down them instead of at that real good loop
---
You do not seem to have a rebuttal for anything I said but instead go for personal insults.  Sad!
---
Jesus, you guys are off the deep end.
---
"That player risked their life and sacrifice themselves to save another. What a greedy fuck".
---
I get people are toxic in this game, but your perspective is burnt if you really see it this way.
---
Relatable my dude
---
I agree that killers don't need to be super iconic, I definitely didn't use the right word. I edited my original comment was edited to match what I was thinking more
---
PLEASE put this online somewhere, there are no good myers skins
---
This is why I always refer to the demogorgan as "the rape dwarf."
---
• “Small ass near impossible” while quite literally just a regular Skillcheck
---
• Description even tells you
---
• ‘Useless’, is literally one of the single best
---
Nigerian Spirit
---
Actually it is the opposite sir.
---
I like these actually.
---
They take twice as long with 4 times the profit, so I disagree with it being a waste of time
---
Yours were still good! I just editted
---
I've seen less people use ruin actually.
---
I like them all apart from corrupted silk.
---
That’s probably because I’m a Trapper main  and his traps still feel underwhelming. 
---
Otherwise? I like these add-ons. Not OP but still strong and some are also situational. This is the kind of direction the game should be going into add-on wise rather than ultra rares like BNP or insta-heals.
---
if undetectable then OoO is trash. Object of Obsession, that already clear that killer can see the aura survivor too that encourage him to chase him ( and tunnel facecamp lmao ) . just kidding, well OoO is fine by itself since it only seeing aura both side. if you cant land hit while chasing ( survivor speed 4/m , killer 4,4 - 4,6 avg ) . idk anymore
---
You’re dumb as fuck dude lol don’t think you’re in the right here
---
For epinephrine shot the secondary button action is on the same button as run for controller (not regarding just changing it), maybe make it like healing but you’re still running?
---
Yeah, you definitely don’t need to be chasing at every opportunity. Especially at the shack or one of the fixtures with multiple windows. Or the school bus on auto haven. There are a handful of really good loops that you can waste a ton of time on, if the survivor is careful.
---
Chases aren’t bad if you know you’re in a spot to get them, if you’re going from loop to loop it’s smarter to pull off and switch targets. Juggling survivors/gens is usually more beneficial than brute forcing your way through the match and hoping everything works out.
---
That is true for that guy. I was more of less just trying to counter a counter claim against your claim. So I totally agree with you.
---
Exactly.
---
Ugly sweaters! My favorite accessory for each character!
---
We did this glitch yesterday so i guess it wasnt patched, but it is only in private games
---
I may be mistaken but doesn’t the entity actually fear Michael? Or is at least cautious with him.
---
Now i would agree with that if these bs hitboxes and trash perks like Noed and insidious didnt exist but have you tried to 360 with a controller its nearly impossible and if they get rid of communication and still continue buffing the killers while reworking the survivors (not buff nor nerf) its gonna be pretty difficult to survive unless the killer is an absolute noob now some survivors need to play smarter like the farmers but at the same time this pip system is pretty much setup to were you rescue or depip/safety pip but again with these hitboxes that are ridiculous its almost a neccesity to have communication so you can survive have you played a game recently to were everybody survived(excluding white and yellow ranks) its very difficult to get a four man unless its wraith but the communication is kinda needed so you guys can play smarter otherwise its just fortnite bs where its all r &amp; g on whether you win or not since you really cant strategize except by doing specific gens first which really all you can do since the mind games are r&amp;g because you dont know whats going to happen if you do something else
---
Horror movies can do well on lower budgets and such if the makers do it right
---
Practical effects all the way
---
Team mates sprinting by you doing a gen is 7/10 times a signal, lol.
---
I don't think it's a good idea as the lore is meant to be very secretive and gameplay would be very different to a movie portrayal.
---
You broke through! So many younger killers dont end chases and think you need to spend an entire game chasing one person if need be. Not the case. You should definitely be patrolling gens and breaking chases and causing whatever slowdowns you can in order to win.
---
Ah yes, the most evil setup
---
And a bloody party streamer, to give the survivors some money while brutalizing them
---
I never said clown was as good as those other killers, and demo doesn't really have too much increased movement speed due to cool down and charge up. Clown's strength isn't in map control and stealth but rather his chase potential.   Yes legion can move faster but similar to spirit it takes his already non existent chase potential. legion can garantee a 1st hit but that's about it, then he has to hope there isn't any set ups or pallets , because at that point he essentially doesn't have a power.Clown on the other hand if played properly can almost always cut the time of a chase in half or less and if they choose to loop vault heavy setups you just get a free hit.map control doesn't mean much if you can't down anyone.
---
How about don't do that anyway?
---
*”You didn’t see anything.”*
---
Just a little bit does not mean 30 seconds. Then its a wasted perk slot. What should happend is that it spawns a hex totem 2 mins into the game so trapper and other snowball killers have time
---
I mean people don't have to change the way they play just because it's double BP.
---
Lmao this was me last night. I looped this killer for damn near two minutes and no gens got done. Lol. It felt good to successfully evade the killer and see some progress in my own playing, but the fact that no gens popped during it and we were still at 5 when the chase finished, kind of pissed me off. Lol.
---
I liked yours better, plus I love the names
---
yes!! i love the sweaters it would be great if the devs gave us some new ones :)
---
Ah yes. I'm still questioning my life choices.
---
I mean, if somebody started timing me without warning, I wouldn't be happy. It just depend how mad he would get.
---
Thanks!
---
Tell me one thing, in game, that is shitty in dead by daylight.
---
This happened to me and 3 other survivors running to aan exit gate, but there was clearly more than half the time left
---
I love working a gen while watching the killer chase someone in a circle
---
Such a toxic killer! How *DARE* he use strong perks!
---
Yeah true. Halloween was made on only a budget of $325,000 and made like $60 or $70 mil I think
---
I've been informed I'm lag switching plenty of times but I'm still able to play so I think you'll be fine for a while
---
Nea is the entity?
---
What is she going to do with the trap anyways?
---
Don't worry about it, you probably wont get banned if its just this time. You might not want to play anymore until you can get your internet sorted out though
---
I think if you use an abbreviation you should capitalize the entire thing.
---
You pretty much have give up a couple of bad gens to set you up for the late game. Take what kills you can, but don't waste time chasing people across the map. Once there's a couple of gens left, they're  forced to do gens around you. It makes it a lot easier getting kills knowing theres only a few places they can complete objectives.
---
I mean they both had the exit gate open and could have just left but instead chose to sit there and mock me. Then when I got one of them downed and picked up, rather than leaving, the other chose to come try for the save because she thought she was good enough.
---
I play killer on switch on TV, so 1080p mode. Honestly, I think it is fine. It gets choppy but I'm having a blast. My biggest complaint is lack of players, but I know the game only just came out. It's Saturday morning, 720am, and I've been searching for a match for almost an hour.
---
I’ve been reported for “lag switching” countless times by salty survivors. Don’t worry about it lol
---
Its not really fair to the survivors, but you're not lagswitching so I'm sure you're fine
---
How is the PS4 population? Should you play on PC so you can have low queue times, or consoles are fine atm?
---
Would have loved Gale
---
Can we appreciate the names of the survivors
---
Ah, then I suppose it has only been fixed for public matches. I was not aware it still worked in KYF matches.
---
Climate change is a thing but it's going to happen no matter what that's just earth. We speed it up with cow farms or really any animal farm. The polar will be super cold again, tropical will be super hot again and temperate will be back to the middle. We are gonna have another Ice age like thing some year...
---
I wouldn't worry about it, specially now. The game has been having issues with connections ever since the last patch, almost every game I am in whether I am playing killer or survivor, people keep disconnecting and or lagging severely at random. Have had many games were 3 people just drop when we we're winning and a few where the killer DCd while they were dominating. So no, I wouldn't worry about a ban.
---
Myers goes above Super Cute. How dare you!
---
“Yo is that scream” ITS GHOSTFACE SAAIDDWFFHESHG
---
* Having an unintentional or passing resemblance to Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; news articles that mention Dead by Daylight in passing, …).
---
Agreed, I was thinking maybe randomize the timer as well. Obviously longer than a minute because of BW, but playing the sounds at start and half of a randomized timer sounds exciting
---
If it's not fun for you don't play it. Play civilization or somethinf
---
This is why we dont teabag myers clauddete you asshole
---
Reminds me of the "If you see me running, there is a reason!"
---
Oh whoops. Interesting. I have somehow never known this. XD Thanks so much for the info.
---
Hexes are weak in general since can be cleansed. That combo is fun but nowhere near strong, it's decent only because some people are stubborn enough to get obsessed with it and they HAVE to Cleanse when they clearly notice people have thrill
---
Glad to hear the Switch is running fine enough but this update absolutely tanks the game at times. I seen another post about it but didn't gain much traction since this sub is primarily PC players.
---
seems fair
---
Character resets to level 1
---
Inventory and perks gone
---
New bloodweb that is supposed to drop higher rarity things more often
---
Special cosmetic
---
Thanks for the support it’s just that I have spent so much money on this game and this is the first time I actually feel guilty for something even though it’s not really my fault.
---
WHAT
---
You’ll probably be fine. 
---
If someone has bad connection and either DCs or just lags the whole time, there’s always *someone* who will accuse you of cheating or being toxic.
---
Not as boring as palette stunning a killer who doesn't hit you and rushing gens when the killer's not stopping you, right?
---
As a Myers main, I agree
---
Is it worth it do?
---
Imo he would be a better killer than Ghostface
---
Yes the killer can close the hatch before they finish jumping in.
---
I agree, chasing can be useful at times and can assure that final hook, and that moment you spot someone carelessly banning midloop it feels good to pull then right off.
---
*all* of us dying may be a bit of an exaggeration but we wouldn't know till the next ice age like event... so maybe you're right but if people during the ice age with fur clothing survived then so are we with technology but it could be 100x worse who knows?
---
Matchmaking is quite ok now, they literally adressed that the entity timer was desynced in the patch notes(all the more reason for your ass to not stand around inside the exit gates), and lobby shit is always gonna be like that til they get servers
---
Yeah if the slug is 99nd and all three are healed and there to help. I've been in those situations plenty of times persony
---
I'm no survivor main I'm a 50/50 player and it's both the Killer and Survivor side of me telling you you're trash and people like you are the problem in this game.
---
Hit boxes all over the place, leaving through the exit gates but still stuck in the game, getting stuck in lockers, game crashes, And that's just technical issues nothing game play wise.
---
I think i swaped spirit and myers by accident Michael dosent have any cosmetics tho
---
Happened to me twice on Thursday, all 4 survivors tea bagging at the door and then they all die. I was so confused because they said the timer skipped for them but not for me as killer
---
All killer dailies too which I really don't want to do because playing survivor due to more bp gain.
---
Not a survivor main.  Play both equally and both killer and survivor mains would tell you you're trash.
---
Glitch. I had the same thing happen earlier
---

Hey Jush
---
Queue times are a tad slow for killer on PS4, but I've heard it same for PC players, aswell as Survivor games being easier to find.
---
I get your talking about gamers rise up stuff and I love that too but rarely anyone is actually like that
---
Up to you I've done ace twice and I'm considering one for Myers once I use up my inventory stockpile. The cosmetic is kinda cool but I wouldn't do it just for that.
---
The biggest issue is if you prestige your character how long will it take you to earn the blood points to get them back where you enjoy playing them, things like during my second prestige of ace I got screwed hard by the web and not getting the perks I like till the mid 40s put me off from doing it again unless I have a plan to farm the points without playing them if I can't get a setup I enjoy.
---
How come? Was hoping my fellow survivor would reach gate (I wasn’t the smartest at the time) and I could take a hit for them.
---
Teachables will remain
---
Damn it! I am sitting on Auric Cells here and I was going to buy that skin straight off, I love it.
---
Thx
---
Fuck no they arent, get out of here
---
its so satisfying. Only other killer that can get gen pulls that easily is meyers, and you need to be in the slow ass tier one to do it. Bing bong boy is su fun
---
Dude please don't host games if you know your connection isn't up to the task.  You're creating unwinnable games for your opponents with them freezing in place and rubberbanding.  That makes it impossible to counterplay a killer in chase let alone a Spirit.  Get your internet working properly or just play survivor man.  It isn't right to host with that internet connection.
---
Predicting is a pretty big part of looping. Watch the red stain closely to see where the killer is going, but they may mind game you with that at really high ranks.
---
Top-notch.
---
No idea, it kills the vibe :(
---
I mean, a little bit... but I’m not about to get all depresso in reddit comments
---
The lack of locker displeases me

That's how it should be this weekend. We all leave with a metric dickload of BP and smiles on our faces!
---
Damn, forgot the most important part
---
Imagine caring about karma
---
Yeah the thing is every other day I have perfect internet, I had no idea it would get this bad, and it is the first time I have ever had internet this horrible
---
No one's a looser, If you are depressed or having bad thoughts talk to someone close and cares about you and if you can't please do try to get a therapist.
---
Entity: Hey can you sacrifice the surv-
---
Myers: HOW ABOUT NO
---
where does it say that?
---
They’re my default for every survivor.
---
I was playing on Xbox. Probably something funky with the last update.
---
Well the only other ways for a Survivor to be mori’d without an actual mori are with Devour Hope and Rancor, and since both Rin and Lisa have an abnormally strong bond with the Entity due to them voluntarily entering its service for wrathful reasons. This means that either A.) Michael has an incredibly strong bond with the Entity, something which I highly doubt for obvious reasons, or B.) Michael is just that evil that the Entity literally cannot control his bloodlust.

Completely agree!

---
What if instead of no scratch marks give the user a small sprint burst like the adrenaline shots in left for dead
---
Because you suck
---
prayer beads = DC
---
Ya it’s very situational, the key is thinking fast on the fly. As a survivor you’re really only focused on where gens are and 1 other target. Killers need to be able to mentally track 4 players plus gens and go from there, which is why a lot of new players get frustrated. Its a lot more pressure and easy to get too focused on a target.
---
3 gens left, urban evading instead of fixing the last gen
---
It's a meme, her face was so ugly that people started saying she was a killer.

Fantastic movie. Completely agree.

---
Legion can allready prevent insta heals. Just use the pin that causes broken. Its just as effective if not more personal because you stab them twice.
---
Some people just hate farming. I was playing a baby Billy yesterday for a ritual and was trying to farm with some survivors. Like I was standing under pallets smacking them and not doing anything when they saved their comrades. They just did everything in their power to "win".
---
I somehow managed to get two of them (despite being one of the worst Billy's in the world) and post-game they said farming was "boring and stupid". Some people just don't know how to have fun I suppose!
---
It's good you're getting therapy, I had to get a lot and its changed my life for the better. It can be hard but try to do what the therapist suggests, I knew a guy who had 20 different therapist and he would switch them because he didn't like what they said. He was and still isn't a good man. What they suggest may make you feel uncomfortable but at least try it (unless its them taking advantage of you).
---
Depends. Early game? Ghost Face bodies Myers. Once Myers gets into EW3 range though? Myers. Can’t beat consistent oneshots with a long ass lunge.

OP has good taste
---
Yeah, you can have 60 fps in normal gameplay and have it stutter only when the skill check is on screen. I've noticed that the game has a nasty habit of starting the skill check before it shows up on screen, making the ones where the success zone is on the bottom right almost impossible to pull off with Huntress' Lullaby.
---
Then bloated piggy comes and drills you up the ass. Oh wait, maybe that’s what makes her cute!?
---
how could they reach the gate when there was like 10 seconds left + why didn't Entity slow down the timer when someone was clearly hooked
---
Well whether i get the leatherface in my match or not he is most likely gonna camp anyways since ill admit i uaually get in the purples but thats usually because i dont like farming people off the hooks and like i said somewhere else its either rescue or de/safety pip because thats just how this pip system is and well rank 1 2 and 3 you dont get people as thrusty for those altruism points and play smarter which same goes for killers on playing smarter at red ranks and how often do you see a leatherface main in red ranks, almost never and its because almost all of the mother fu##ers camp and the reason i exclude rank 20 is because usually theyre just learning how to play him and so they may tunnel and patrol but most rank 20s surprisingly wont camp
---
80 seconds with 1 person 50 with 2
---
Ive had console issues such as, not being able to heal myself (med kit or self care), others not being able to heal me, or heal others  (med kit or normally), no struggle on 2nd hook, no recover on ground,and no vaults (pallet or windows) . Game is spaghetti code. Still fun when not broke tho.
---
Doing something like that would probably result in lobby dodging. Just always assume the team can communicate.
---
I agree with that or even if they make it in the code where it does the opposite for every daily.
---
Chef scott is just staring at him...
---
They should be killers though. That way their mori can be the survivors running from them and impaling themselves on something lol make them interchangeable like Legion
---
Welp, at least I got a crap ton of blood points from it :D
---
Thank you, it’s nice to get support from unlikely places, like a Reddit comment thread hehe...
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/da5tve/endgame_timer_when_it_was_still_a_new_feature/
---
I can only see this being a quality of life change. If anything it'll encourage people to play more.
---
Did you play a game this patch? If they say they "address" something that only means they made it worse. Not even kidding. Literally saw a person dying earlier while the timer still had a quarter left.
---
They should be in the game.
---
I have had only killer rituals for the last month except for 2 days. so irritating
---
"prepare accordingly" for most killers equals dodging. SWF squads would never be able to play the game.
---
It's a bug with the latest patch. Prepare for a response from someone else with a bunch of links from previous threads on the same topic. *Eyeroll*
---
Epinephrine shot is completely useless. You use an add-on for a single use that removes scratch marks for three seconds. At this point just use dance with me at least it works many times.
---
Yeah exactly, they both thrive in different parts of the game, so I put them roughly on the same level
---
The DC thing is a glitch
---
So far this bloodhunt has been a bust for me. It's nearly impossible to play with friends anymore since we can't stay together while connecting to matches. Such a bummer since everyone is so hype for the new DLC!
---
All Trapper needs is to have his brown sack addon baked into his base kit and slightly darker traps. Beyond that, it all comes down to knowledge, skill, and a dash of luck. But a nice QoL would be letting him reset traps without needing to replace them. Anything else would need to be suggested by a superior Trapper.
---
I'm pretty much in the same boat and I'm on xbox where killer lobbies take 2 years to form.
---
They just made him tolerable, careful what you ask for hahaha almost everyone I know still straight up DCs when they see it's a legion
---
Honestly as a spirit main I rarely use prayer beads. I usually save them for a special occasion.
---
I would try to wire yourself up if possible. It'll be a better experience for you too!
---
I had something similar happen, a trapper was guarding the exit gate but I heard the hatch under me in the preschool so I was about to go in when the timer went from one third to zero I think it might be a ui glitch
---
Have you even played the game? Lmao
---
I want Brenda.
---
The BNP isn't even all that good these days. You know how genrushing isn't actually a thing anymore? That's because the old BNP isn't a thing anymore.  
---
Nowadays, it's neat, but pretty pointless.
---
KEKW
---
Was it against a clown on Halloween map?
---
Excuse you, the line is "haha no SWFs actually communicate information its just friends memeing! xDDD"
---
Uh first she/he tbags
---
Second matchmaking isn't a thing so he/she can just be "juking" new players
---
Many subreddits are liberal, there are barely any leftist communities
---
I just love how i got 3 negatives stating facts as to why ranks excluding rank 1 2 3 and 20 and i get people saying carmas coming my way but i just chuckle because its not like saying something else wouldve changed anything if i get a leatherface hes gonna camp me unless hes 1 of the 4 ranks i said but how often do you see a leatherface main in red ranks, almost never and its because they fu##ing camp yet still get mother fu##ing killer mains who still fail to realize that
---
Wait it's a fucking hand. I thought it was someone's arm flexing.
---
Do you actually play this game gasmask?
---
Address just means to acknowledge that it exists you twat.
---
Bubba always underestimated by this sub
---
Should have 99 the door and then farmed the points. Once it went bad y'all could have left.
---
that just make swf wont match with killer
---
Yeah i do, for 2 years now. Rank 8 killer, i getting matched against swf’s with rank 7 and 8 as their top, and randoms are almost always 7,8,or 9
---
Uh, turn of auto aim then
---
1/10, not accurate enough.
---
Lmao the panic scatter was amazing. I bet they came back like ???
---
Yo, what the actual fuck is that sub reddit? Not even an exorcist can cure that.
---
I would like to teach you how to stab people well
---
Or you could not jump to conclusions and be "that guy"
---
Warms my heart to see young men saving water by sharing the shower. Way to save the planet, guys.
---
I don't, basement camping isn't efficient.
---
Welcome to dead by daylight, the game where you can’t guarantee whether you’re gonna have fun or not.
---
ah yes my fave sub
---
make dailies actually interesting
---
Cant on console
---
Nobody tells me how to play l. I don't see how you being a 50 player is relavant.
---
I know they THINK that it encourages survivors to play killers, but really it just makes rituals near useless. 
---
And when I DO get a survivor one, it's for a level 1 character and requires an escape lol.
---
I say it whenever I see posts like this: Roll "We'll make it" and WGLF together.
---
We eventually did farm it out. Killer was waiting a while for the lobby and went to get cereal. Came back to us doing a ring-around-the-rosie around her, which is when she decided to farm it out. Gave her 2 kills for being a good sport.
---
It's not like killers do the same thing. 
---
Of course there will always be people who like other people with a similar game style.
---
Lmao, pretty much yeah.
---
Yes a fucking joke. Worst killer in the game
---
100% facts. Nice, funny, consistent, and helpful.
---
cannibal should go to cute
---
(it's because you only play survivor and they try and encourage people to play both)
---
When have you last seen Bloodwarden? I have been grinding a lot lately and I have seen it exactly once: on a low level Freddy who probably didn´t have anything else. Didn´t help him at all.
---
I don’t believe they would This ghostface is a new ghostface created for dnd. Also the only possible survivor from this ghostfaces past that we know of was “killed by ghost face before the entity could get him.
---
Reasonable upstanding people would say I can play the game how I want to.
---
They would not throw random insults at me that do nothing for their argument.
---
Think of it this way: 4 BBQ stacks = × 2
---
Bloodhunt = × 4
---
BPS = × 8
---
Survivors get × 4 at best because of no BBQ. You don't wait an entire match in the queue (normally) so therefore killer is slightly ahead
---
unhooking is good. imagine flashlight 9 times with dwight. damn
---
&gt; Used pallets are never going to get called out regardless
---
Killer shack and if a player can say "I used X pallets" which gives you an idea how safe an area is.
---
I just stated a load of benefits of SWF, and there is plenty more. You're just strawmanning.
---
Wow, you sound like a man of culture.
---
You cant find what you never see.
---
The game can tell when you were lag switching or just have bad internet don’t worry.
---
If thats what culture sounds like to you then ok
---
Quintons arent toxic they are just got tier altruistic
---
Just stop taling to me you "twat"
---
Stop replying to me, brainlet
---
I can barely understand what you're saying with zero punctuation.
---
You're spoiling mates good name. Shame on you.
---
&gt;Lmao do you think immersed players just sit in corners the whole game? You think they don’t touch gens at all?
---
I can assure you that I am not that type of Nea. I use the immersion to avoid screaming when hit by clowns and doctors to avoid being chased in those situations since they are my least favorite killers. I will admit, I can be toxic in the sense that I usually am looping killers around pallets when seen. I am usually doing gens. I feel like there are people who do that; however I am not one of those who sits in the corner. I find that boring. I am a rank 5 by the way.
---
dont doodle on ur home work
---
I think you mean We're Gonna Live Forever, No One Left Behind is a useless perk.
---
oh hurr durr survivors who won a game shouldn’t get to escape because they’re t-bagging
---
I think they should have their own seasons per killer! Give us some backstory !
---
For trying to help?
---
Yeah I think B is the more agreed upon answer
---
Let me guess ps4
---
What rank was this? I am assuming this was a lower rank? I have never seen any of the higher ranked Neas play like this because you cannot rank up if you do this. You literally have to be in the match 100% of the time to pip up at rank 5.
---
Aight so I got bug where I’m playing killer and like 2 or 3 people get disconnected from my lobby mid game, and it’s happened like 10 times. Idk what to do or how to fix it. I also have no idea where to post it
---
Oh sorry
---
99% rank 20-15 everyone else is in the 1%. On a side note it’s now impossible to find a game as killer.
---
Reasonable upstanding people don't condone ruining the game experience of their opponents intentionally on either side of the aisle.  You don't get to take the high road with me facecamping to grief buddy.
---
PC, it's the same effect when I hit bloodlust
---
The Meg also t bagged at the end. I thought that she played really well too at the start
---
I don’t want the paper to go to waste
---
I feel your pain
---
I was yelled at for being a fucking camper when the exit gates were opened, I had one guy on the hook and the rest of them were running around me like bees trying to get me to follow them.
---
Like...seriously? Why TF would I ever leave that hook? Especially since it was a hook next to the exit? 
---
Excuuuuuuuse meeee
---
Detecting stealth killers with OoO is exactly why it's goddamn broken.  
---
And you realize that playing stealth against such stuff isn't really F U N, right? Making abilities useless isn't fun.
---
doesn't matter the timer at the top needs to be accurate
---
*sad bing bongs*
---
He's not bad. It just feels like you can't use his power sometimes. Like the stealthing works just fine and is great, but the stalking part feels so inconsistent. I feel like I get more out of his power by just sneaking on people and never stalking.
---
You accused me of being a survivor main.  I was correcting you.  You did babyyou if all you can do is troll players in this game.  But don't kid yourself for a second that you're "revenging" anybody.  You're just another garden variety BM troll playing only you make the game miserable for the other side.
---
Ok. I think no because they are too adorable to be killers BUT if they don't actually hit anyone and just try to "help" causing the survivors to just fall on hooks and die in ok with that xD
---
She crouched literally once
---
That would be awesome.
---
Literally playing killer at rank 16 and I spared everyone (bp event but we played slug tag with some hooking) and someone afterwards was like breaking down saying how they needed this mental break game. Poor baby players :(
---
NiCe JoB mOrOn
---
Oh lawd he stalkin'
---
Just run 4Head because survivors using the things they need to survive is greedy
---
It used to be a non-hex perk during the first stages od the game, if im not mistaken
---
If your goal is 4k and not points, it's the best choice
---
I mean it would need some creative interpretation but it's definitely doable.
---
Once I looped a killer for about 3 minutes and not a single gen popped. Then I got hooked. All of my 3 teammates were urban immersing the map. There was not even a ruin. Feels bad.
---
I'm not a Trapper main, but here's my opinion anyway.  
---
#S-Tier  
---
* Iridescent Stone  
---
* Honing Stone  
---
* Bloody Coil  
---
* Stitched Bag  
---
These add-ons are without a doubt the best in his arsenal. They provide lots of good bonuses, reduce down-time, and/or puts a lot of pressure on the survivors without having to be in a chase with them.  
---
#A-Tier  
---
* Trapper Bag  
---
* Trapper Sack  
---
* Tar Bottle  
---
* Fastening Tools  
---
These add-ons aren't quite as good as the literal meta add-ons, but they provide solid bonuses and/or reduce his down-time, which is quintessential to performing well as him.  
---
#B-Tier  
---
* Setting Tools  
---
* Trap Setters  
---
* Trapper Gloves  
---
* Logwood Dye  
---
* Rusted Jaws  
---
These add-ons provide decent bonuses, reduce the Trapper's down-time a moderate amount, and/or put a decent amount of pressure on the survivors. All in all, they're okay, but not spectacular.  
---
#C-Tier  
---
* Oily Coil  
---
* Secondary Coil  
---
* Serrated Jaws  
---
These add-ons aren't necessarily bad, but they're not really something experienced Trapper players are looking for. You won't find these add-ons making much of a difference in your games.  
---
#D-Tier  
---
* 4-Coil Spring Kit  
---
* Strong Coil Spring  
---
These add-ons are like the C-Tier add-ons, only worse.  
---
#F-Tier  
---
* Wax Brick  
---
This add-on is pure garbage. I don't recommend ever using it.  
---
#Unranked  
---
* Padded Jaws  
---
While pretty pointless for applying pressure, this add-on is a lot of fun to use. On its own, it's literally only good for basically guaranteeing 8k BP in the deviousness category.  
---
Keep in mind, though, that you can pair this with the Honing Stone add-on, meaning if they break themselves out of the Bear Trap, they still enter the Dying State. It's a hilarious combination that I absolutely recommend trying out.
---
🖐🏻
---
Not every one does that it affects people who are genuinely going for last second saves.
---
I can’t imagine my life being so lame I’d reply to a a comment like that...
---
They may not condone, but neither do they try to take the moral high ground and judge them by calling them "trash" and "cancer."
---
Pay close attention when nea breaks free and goes to the gate, and also Meg
---
Instead we got Oscar the Grouch on meth
---
I said I wasn’t the smartest at the time
---
Only the brave May enter
---
What?!
---
Are you sure about that? Any proof?
---
Just to make sure, I’m joking. But if you were playing along my bad.
---
&gt;you accused me of being a survivor main
---
Where?? I said
---
&gt;Filthy survivor mains can't tell me how to play
---
That's not the same as saying 
---
&gt;You're a filthy survivor main
---
Don't strawman my argument by putting words in my mouth, it's disingenuous.
---
The game can tell who’s lagging due to lag switching or just plain bad internet. You’re fine. :)
---
The only time i'm not on a gen is if i'm getting hooked.
---
Really? So every at the gate DC I've experienced for 6 months has been a glitch?
---
I'm sorry. I couldn't tell. Btw, s/ is a thing :)
---
DC=BAN thank god for dedicated servers :)
---
Ok.😂
---
Yeah that is the thing. She doesn´t bring solutions, she is just there to bark on people, make the news and incite protests. Which, arguably, she achieved. But now we have people who know nothing about climate change just mindlessly yelling without actually thinking about the issue.
---
She took a 4 million boat across the ocean to be "green" while she had a crew *fly* there to take that boat back lol. That makes next to 0 sense, other than making headlines.
---
No, there shouldn't. That's like saying survivors should get a notification of what killer they're going against in the lobby.
---
I seriously think none of these people play league I've had people tell me they hope I outlive my children on there
---
They could start blood spattered and you could prestige them for regular clothes
---
You are the one being disingenuous now.  This whole thread has been you and me talking to each other.  You were clearly inferring I was a "filthy survivor main" and you know it.  The bullshit is seeping out of your eyes your so backed up at this point.
---
So like, legion?
---
And killers used to be able to mori survivors on first down
---
What use is there complaining about it now
---
The same things that are shitty and toxic in every  other game that exists? How is this not a concept you're familiar with?
---
Thats hilarious cause their post is right above yours haha
---
Why? Not spending for a dlc you don't care about isn't dumb, are you okay dude?
---
You are actively making the community a shittier place.  There's no sugarcoating that.
---
Shadow billy
---
I literally see Meg running into the exit gate, Nea runs towards her and passes her, Meg crouches once, Nea teabags and gets downed while Meg escapes.
---
Sorry i added some comas to help you out on were im stopping but once youll read it youll understand it if you look at it from bothe survivor and killers point of view but if you just look at it from one side youre gonna dislike it
---
Legion is my killer so I admit I'm biased. But IMHO to keep true to the fucking trailer they sold him on he needs a few minor changes. One, no terror radius and slower movement only outside of frenzy. Two, longer frenzy but allow you to down people. Three, ffs give us some decent chase music or a fun terror radius damnit. Half the add-ons are mix tapes. How cool would it be for chase music to reflect mix tapes?
---
Clown in “eww” = downvote
---
Lol stop being so sensitive and answer my question
---
It's me. I'm the random teammates.
---
Man, survivors need more ways to make BPs. It really sucks how little they can earn without BPS, and let´s be honest, most games you won´t have 5x BPS. 
---
I tried playing some survivor games. Was so bad. Switched to killer and easily started dropping 100k games without much issue.
---
What you showed here was everyone got out and then the killer "DC'd" which is just a glitch that's been happening once all the survivors
---
Can't you get reported for this because it's body blocking?
---
The Ghostface in DbD isn’t associated with any movies, they only got the license for the mask
---
Exactly and if they don’t have a key when the match starts and then find one in a chest oh well, happens all the time and there is nothing you can do about it!
---
The Ghostface mask was licensed from Fun World (as was the one used in the Scream films albeit slightly modified).
---
So the character and 99% of the design were all created by BHVR and share nothing in common with the Scream franchise.
---
He's the best dlc to buy. Great killer with add ons that completely change your playstyle
---
Also Laurie that gives you ds OoO which can also help or give you the option to run a chase/diversion build no problem
---
Best dlc so far imo
---
I would agree to that thought process but if they make it possible to get into a killer match semi quickly I would play killer but it's just stupid how long it takes I probably waited 15 just to get into a lobby by myself then another couple to start the match.
---
So that’s why the outfit quite differs from the original.And I was wondering about the waving clothing.At first I thought they just decided to only release the killer
---
Wait omg I think I played with the Nea afterwards cause I was in a lobby with a Nancy (red ranks) and a nea joins and says “don’t dc like my team did against a legion” and I was like lmfaooo I wish I had a legion as a killer
---
I can't wait until they release the full v̶̧̛͚̯̘̫͎͇̘̺͊̋̊̐̌͆͒̎̌̌̂͗͊o̴̧̨̭̫͙͍̲̩̕ͅi̷̘̦̦̾̎̂̾̄͌͆̀̀͒d̷̙͈͍̞̝͍̱̗̥͙̾̈́̈́̑ collection for all killers
---
That dude must have been high as Fuck when they did that shoot!
---
What you showed here was that everyone got out and then the killer "DC'd" which has been a recent glitch that happens once all the survivors leave you weren't in the exit gate when he left
---
I wasn't trying to infer that at all.
---
My apologies if you simply misunderstood me, but your continued disrespect and rude speech makes me believe it was fallicious in nature.
---
**Deserved**
---
If there was a lery's offering that would be called a guarantee win
---
How is that only once, you can clearly see her standing in front of the exit gate so she could make sure the killer would see her, and that wasn't just one crouch
---
Incorrect. You can have Franklin's on your loadout as a matter of principle.

I’m running adept Nancy + stake out and I was mori’d 3 TIMES last night. 
---
I get that survivor meta perks suck, but to be fair they are trying to stay alive against the only thing that can take them out of the game and stop them from getting points. It’s a lose lose for both sides
---
Yeah, pretty much the same thing here. And I also have the feeling as if certain killer just have also better chances of getting pips. I´m normally playing more Survivor than Killer, but still, closely before the rank reset, I'm higher ranked with Killer.
---
Read u/kerplunk124 comment... 
---
I've had my fun.
---
What is a SWF?
---
True but I normally don’t run it with my Myers, I like bbq,ruin,save the best for last and nurses or dying light. Throw on NOED once in awhile for kicks, but if I see all flashlights, or toolbox’s and or a single key and franklins is on baby!

I really only see her crouching once, Nea does it twice

I give up
---
Sounds like Legion 🤔
---
Yeah, basically.
---
Survivor bloodpoint gains are and in general because of what grants them. Getting a perfect game of 32 k as survivor is effectively impossible unless the killer is farming and both of you are very patient. 
---
This mainly comes down to the fact you get 5 k in survival for escaping but only ever really get survival from wiggling out of a killers grasp and struggling on the hook.
---
Entity: stop killing them! That's my food, you mute bitch! 😤.
---
Michael:...........🖕
---
I recently got the Plague.You rarely get to play her against her and she is a fun pick for me.Her range shooting vomit is pretty helpful,especially when you get the corruption purge.She also is an interesting character
---
We are on easy street and the feels so sw... wait it isn’t easy street? fuck
---
Yah it’s getting old with the same broke ass shit, hopefully whenever dedicated servers get turned on we will have a nice new match making system that works and isn’t a repatch over repatched spaghetti coded mixer...
---
I wish it happened more often. I’ve had a few rude survivors that could’ve used a slap in the face lol
---
I havent had a que longer than 3 minutes so eh
---
The epinephrine shot is as useful as a bnp, makes sense why it's pink
---
Up your camera sensitivity, and make sure to look behind/around you a lot when looping. Knowing how far behind the killer and if they're trying to mind game has helped me A LOT with looping.
---
Imagine being a killer and complaining about DS still.
---
My man, I just came back from playing ark Official servers. This game is so sweet in comparison I confused it with a candy store, really puts things into perspective.
---
Oof. Everytime I get a toxic swf I just pick the weakest one and tunnel tf out of them. Usually they'll try to save, which gets you more hooks
---
I'm still skeptical of using it since the patch notes said the game crash is still possible, low maybe, but possible. I cant waste those BPS
---
Can i be in your games then? I see it every game more or less.
---
And you wonder why you get teabagged at the exit gate
---
That was the plot of Freddy vs Jason lol
---
Forgot to include Gruesome Gateau
---
Honestly, unless it’s insta-cleansed, you get value out of it for the time it takes survivors to either look for it, or struggle through it if they’re decent at skillchecks. You could get 2 hooks in 2 minutes, or 8. Depends on how you play.
---
Tldr; It gives value if it lasts 60+ seconds
---
Since your the first Ill get plag but first well she have a halloween blight skin
---
I personally think the stranger things update ruined pretty much the whole thing that made this game kinda fun before. They obviously don’t test out much of the patches they put in this game Bc this is shit
---
Yeah there needs to be another way to get bp in the survival category.

oof. Thanks for that, I just saw a pic of someone wearing the ghostface mask with their cock fully erect and out
---
Yer lucky to FIND a survivor before it breaks half the time quite honestly.
---
Leatherface is the most dogshit killer if you want to be competitive but his perks are well worth the money
---
That looks more like the killer swung and missed.
---
what th. Fuck
---
You’re really fucking pissed, fucking huh?
---
If I hooked 2 guys in 30 seconds then no... If it lasts a couple minutes I say its worth, otherwise nope another perk would be best. I can buy 2 minutes worth of stall with other perks.
---
Two hooks? What a privilege. Usually survivors spawn right in front of my totem or the totem spawns next to a gen. :( But yet it really helps slowing the game down, even for a minute or two.
---
Im so fucking angry with this game rn bc this double bloodpoints event is making me play this game all day. Ive realized there is so much wrong with this game and how fucking easy it is to play survivor
---
Imagine getting 1-7 ranked people in a game against me ( a rank 13 killer )
---
But I'm that one survivor main that also plays killer to meme so I stand up for you guys.
---
But in all honesty, why play host if you know your internet is trash? like I always wondered this, it's not that your good, it's that it takes me 3 seconds for the damn vaulting animation to start. I always end up leaving, i've noticed survivors just quit the game if it gets bad enough, and Killers have had the nerve to PM me asking me why i'm leaving the game and that it's reportable. lol.
---
In the current state the graphics need to be tuned and there’s a bug that keeps resting peoples ranks, those things considered, I still bought it because I love this game.
---
Remove Mori Rituals, not everyone has or wants to use one
---
Oh no the scary clown known for eating kids EATS kids. Too much spoils
---
Yes I am. I just played a match and all of them where rank 1-7 and they gen rushed 3 gems before I got first hook and then finished the others by the time i got done hooking another person.
---
No idea why this is downvoted. I play both sides and even so, I partially agree and am prepared to be downvoted, I guess. 
---
I honestly believe that if you know have bad internet and survivors repeatedly tell you it’s a problem, yet you choose to continue playing as killer, you’re indirectly adding to the toxicity of the community even if you mean well. I’m NOT saying you aren’t entitled to ever play killer. You paid for the game like the rest of us and I know it totally sucks. But to play a particular mode when you know you have an unfair advantage is just a bit jerky. 
---
That being said, survivors can see your ping so they should be aware of that. It’s pretty much the only countermeasure for survivors but killers should understand that it is not always accurate. I’ve had yellow-green ping games as survivor that still rubber-banded. 
---
I say all this as someone who has experienced bad internet on my end, gotten complaints from survivors, and took a break from killer until I got it resolved. I mean, in the end, it’s not just about what you as a laggy killer are entitled to. It’s more about just trying to do right by the community.
---
If I can get a survivor on a hook before it’s found, I’ll take it. Pressure’s on.
---
Is this loss
---
I’m taking that as an opportunity to double pip
---
Buy the two items leading to the perk you want the most.   2nd buy the two items that lead to the perk you want 2nd (second choice). THEN immediately chose your 1st choice. If the entity takes your second choice the just got straight to the last perk. Guaranteed to get two in every bloodweb
---
Can you explain that to me? I thought Fred was the only one who could deal with it.
---
Supposedly they are currently re-working him. The way people have talked, it doesn't sound like a numbers buff type of a re-working, or just an addon type of re-working, but a real rework like Freddy was. I've asked around for more info but I haven't found any yet.
---
Ah yes, gonna add. Thanks :)
---
Adiris also comes with a great perk which the entity blocks some generators in early game
---
Watch the film and you would understand then
---
Only if it’s longer than a minute.
---
You put a survivor on a hook? How dare you try to complete your objective, you toxic hook rusher.
---
Really? Most people I speak to including myself find survivor 100x harder. With killer I don't need to worry about going out of my way for the other 3 people I don't know or making constant annoying skill checks. Killer I just run to 7 auras that are always visible and boop people that literally leave signs leading to them.
---
yea I get it. There are survivors and killers who ruin other people’s fun when they think they’re going to lose. I was just trying to shed light that not only survivors can be entitled
---
No worries
---
Ghostface Pig and Wraith have stealth mode which disables their tr so bt doesn't work on them
---
Could be down to either your or the killers internet. Also you can get hit halfway through vaulting a pallet
---
I just rewatch the entire OchiDO funny moments playlist while waiting
---
I have no idea if I should watch this movie after these comments.....
---
Just immediately go for the perk you want most and hope the entity rng goes for the perk you want least. As long as you go straight for a perk you should be able to get a second one every time.
---
In addition, all the ones you listed except for leatherface can be bought using iridescent shards. You can grind for the rest if you really want them
---
I would get a heart attack.
---
Welcome to DBD.
---
Welcome to the world of DBD hitboxes. It happens to everyone all of the time I’m afraid
---
Sorry, I thought it was clearer. It's just that I got 3 perks that are useless in my opinion
---
Platform: Xbox
---
Type of bug: Menu

Description: Daily Rituals aren't showing correctly. I scrapped a killer ritual (Mori someone) earlier and got a survivor one (heal people). A match or two later I went to see why it didn't pop yet, and it was changed back to a different killer one (teleport and hit as hag). It's happened a few times over the last week.
---
Steps to reproduce: I guess just scrap a ritual, and don't complete it right away.
---
I'm not saying you don't have to try to survive, I'm saying you don't have to be a shithead while doing so
---
Why would they encourage people to lock up the fucking queues? It's 4 survivors to one killer. Dailies need to reflect that ratio.
---
You're also basically holding the game hostage if there's a survivor that just wants to play.
---
Then he'd be an actual bogeyman

I blame being a decent human being for unhooking. Nobody wants to be benched or see others benched. It's a trash mechanic really. It's unfortunate that some people are a bit too eager to help and others just want to use the one good BP survivor skill to farm

Yeah I’ve tried this. It literally doesn’t work. It instantly takes the other one, and by that time you cannot make it to the third.
---
Going for the personal insult already? you're poor
---
Oh shit, I haven't thought about that movie since lil flip was relavent
---
Well done! Excellent list. I think you forgot Prove Thyself, it is an excellent perk for survivors if they want to farm bloodpoints.
---
A nice sight to see as survivors.
---
What could you possibly do for the jar of salty lips?
---
What's that thing to the right of Dwight?
---
That's completely incorrect, I'm only hooking everyone twice and then let them escape. If you want to leave, then complete the gens and escape, all it'll do is cut your and your team's total BP gain. I won't prevent you from leaving.
---
First that's not how bloodpoints stack. Second survivors also has a perk that doubles bloodpoints.
---
At this point I'm just assuming its a maturity thing. If you've been on the internet long enough you know that teabagging is far from anything new or original. I've seen much worse things you can do to be toxic in this game. It only affects you as much as you let it do so. If someone is teabagging you its because they want attention and getting pissed about it is just playing in to their hands. Thats why Ots said don't let it get to you but w/e. 
---
Most of the people still playing this game and still getting mad about this didn't even play back when TRUE infinites existed so they don't even know true toxicity. Acting like someone hitting crouch in your general direction is a terrible thing while having never experienced someone being literally unkillable because they are exploiting poor map design is really funny to me I guess, I don't know.
---
Survive With Friends
---
usually a SWF means three or four players matching up together using this option, most likely on a voice call too
---
*me running across the map and missing a hit last second*
---
Are you on PC? Killer queues aren't bad at all on Xbox.
---
Tru3ta1ent every game he dies.
---
Beans
---
I just don’t find him fun or enjoyable. Also I still got a downvote lol
---
There’s different speed vaults, if you fast vault you pull off the wall faster and you shouldn’t get hit, if its a slow vault you’ll get hit. A lot of people try and pretend like the killer doesn’t have arms that can reach though an opening more often then it really being an issue of ping (which happens still frequently.)
---
Personally I just find a pallet around survivors and smack it. It doesn't always work, mind you.
---
Frames and this game dont go well together really
---
thats the closest thing i have to skill
---
just let me have this one
---
95% of the time the last Survivor is the Urban Evasion guy that does nothing but hide in tall grass all match.
---
Find one , bang on a generator with your knife, if you happen to down them stand still let them wiggle out take them to the next generator. I don't play killer much only to try and get the extra BP from the missions so this is how I let people know I'm not interested in catching them
---
I would even just take a Tucker cosmetic for HillBilly and go around cutting trees and repairing damaged pallets with my hammer. See if any survivors “accidentally” get in the way.
---
Isn't that what Moris do?  Or is that sanctioned killing by the Entity?
---
M1 a generator in sight or just keep chasing them until it’s apparent you can hit them but don’t
---
&gt; You're just strawmanning.
---
How? I'm not even disputing that SWF gives benefits, I literally say it multiple times during my post, what are you even on about?
---
I meant I’m dumb cuz I literally never took into consideration they didn’t buy the dlc.

You got it!

That's not unintentional or farming, though.
---
Probably just a bug. Same happened to me and my David adept. In the end I just used an achievement manager to get it because I didn't want to use no mither for another minute
---
It crashes the game at 5/6 stacks. I’ve had it happen to me every time a killer was good enough to get that many stacks. Couldn’t figure out why it kept happening until I saw it in the patch notes.
---
I'm on mobile. Link just says I need permission to join then kicks me out.
---
HES GUNNA NUT!!!!!!!!!
---
I'd be too scared that he had noed. So kudos for the bravery! 👏🏽
---
considering i can't play in a match as killer or survivor without getting disconnected as of the "hotfix" patch , its okay to call it unplayable
---
Aw the baby only wanted some friends 😊
---
well it depends, if you've been tunneling maybe once or twice and thought no no one would notice or care, they probably aren't talking about just the end of the match, survivors are dumb but they never complain for literally no reason.
---
Thank you, I´m gonna add that :)
---
pff the last couple of days ruin looks useless its like im not even putting it in players just hit those skill checks or just tap tap tap there way to victory lol
---
Billy with the base cowboy hat is cute. Everything else eww.
---
Oh, I’ve gotten 8 a few times, hasn’t crashed for me yet.
---
Huntress and Hag are absolutely above Ghost Face too. Ghost face is also better then Meyers, but that’s only because he’s so fucking buggy
---
Being in red ranks for months, I can confidently say that that will be most of your games. Every now and then, you'll get survivors in your game that are just absolutely fantastic, but then the next 15 will have total duds again.
---
I've been running a farming build since Steve came out, and I've been running Aftercare with it. It's actually crazy how many people I see being useless with that.
---
It really is. I don't *intend* to farm, I just play that way because it's fun for me. I'm literally *not farming intentionally*
---
Never got that, in my experience most camping killers get 2 kills at best, you have to be really bad for that to be better then playing properly given all the chasetime &amp; other points you loose.
---
Im gonna delete this and make something else
---
That's why I run corrupt intervention.
---
That's painful
---
i started using Dark Devotion on Legion and it's incredibly fun and also probably scary to be working on a gen in silence, then some edgy teenager stabs you out of nowhere
---
A black screen?
---
Only 1 survivor, its in custom games.
---
May I ask what the slur began with?
---
To address the second point: that perk isnt easy to get double with, so it isn't as reliable as bbq
---
Ah, i was seeing so many people using that term that i decided to ask, now i know. thank you sir.
---
I'm not being sensitive, I'm calling you an idiot. IRS not like DBD has some like magical filter that makes it not toxic when some dudes being a jackass. Ever played Siege? Or Overwatch? The same shit that's toxic in those is also toxic in DBD, it's not that hard to understand.
---
Cursed comments lmao
---
I just got the game and I win 1/4 matches on average, but I wish there was a way to see how many wins and my win/loss ratio
---
I'd say at least 1 hook as then you have pressure starting to roll out.
---
I physically cant hit them if they 360 right
---
Thank you:3
---
FFS. Not having a good night lol. OBS seems to have messed up as well. It was meant to show a leather face insidious camping in the basement as soon as anyone was downed.
---
Honestly no clue tbh. Its weird
---
And he definitely can't sprint transition!
---
Same if they were respectful and did decent chases, unhooks, all that I tend to let them go
---
I run ace in the hole purely to get this OP beast for free from a chest.
---
While you're jerking off with the other survivors and don't actually try to chase or actually play the game, even if the game ends eventually you all ruined it for one of the players.
---
I mainly getting toxic survivors/killers no matter what I play so like Idk what to do
---
Probably a Z
---
I kinda love that he has no reason? He just... chose her. In 2018 it make sense that he'd come back for his 'lost kill', and in the first she's just his, well, his obsession. 
---
I really like the lack of reason for Michael, I feel it's a big part of what makes his character so iconic.
---
I usually run at them and vault.

And with only Make Your Choice for your perks? I'm trash at finding survivors with not a single aura reading perk/add-on so Congrats!! 👏🏽
---
You’re the only one that I’ve seen said they have that problem
---
Nope I was patrolling the exit gates and I went 20 meters away from one and when I came back she had it open
---
Damn I take a break from the game for 3 months and now everyone is useless? What the hell
---
It’s that one thing that Dwight loves to stay in all game
---
It is! I think I recall from a certain devstream, they described it as,"Sure, I'll let you have one" as what the Entity may say so to speak when a Killer decides to Mori a survivor. It's allowed, but I'd only ever assume that it's just one kill per trial. Michael, on the other hand, kills whomever he wants whenever he wants.
---
This is honestly me lol
---
That rank it is not that bad, sometimes get worse, me, rank 8 versus a killer rank 19, and in my match have a guy with rank 2, thats the worst
---
I feel like when used properly, wraith becomes one of the best killers!! ofc that's just my opinion, but I don't see him as a bad killer
---
By the way, why you censored your ID only? And the perks?
---
IT looks horrible tbh he looks like cring ass nae nae baby 😳
---
How would the cake offering benefit you??
---
Idk just didn’t wanna get spammed or something I guess
---
Let's not go into this "ruined the game for me" stuff, as it can easily go both ways (killer being bullied getting a 0K). Farming is not mandatory, despite your claims. Want in? Sure, let's smack pallets and spam traps for a bit. Don't want in? The door's right there, no one stopping you.
---
But if *dumb farmers* are *ruining your experience SOOO MUCH*, **surely** you could let us have our 4 days of messing around and getting rich while you have your 4 months of playing the game, couldn't you?
---
lol
---
Nah Meg did good. Nea just fucked it up by t bagging for something she didn’t have any control over.
---
So a 4 rank difference with a rank 16 is fine, but a 5 rank difference with a rank 7 is just too much? Would you have made this post if he was 17 instead of 7?
---
well, i'm not the only one who it's happening to. quite a few people are having this issue, making the game LITERALLY unplayable.
---
So would they be classified as survivors or killers?
---
This post is more for the survivors who loop successfully while getting good saves and doing gens. If it's just a random survivor hiding who should know better I'm hookin em lol but if it's a good survivor who did well but couldn't fully 1v1 I'll give hatch
---
I understand it, but the survs needs privacy too haha

I can’t remember the specifics but you need to be in a straight run at it for a certain distance (let’s say 2-3 meters) for a fast vault to trigger. If you hit it on an angle it will trigger a medium vault and if your running up along the wall then vault it’s the same as just silently climbing over. If you’ve seen any gameplay where a survivor sorta beers away from the vault then darts back at it it’s so they get the distance in order to trigger a fast vault. Just like learning the loops it takes some time to learn mastering fast vaults wile in a chase with a killer. I’m certain there will be a couple videos on YouTube showing examples.
---
Cool.  I don't play killer often so I wasn't sure.  Thanks!
---
This is very far from horrible. You had ONE survivor that was higher than you and he wasn't even red ranked. Have you never seen the multiple screenshots of people going against 4 red ranked survivors?
---
GeNs ArEnT dOnE tO fAsT
---
I don't think it is
---
You don’t need to, bbq will help a lot as a killer but even as a survivor it’s easily possible tho
---
Michael is basically evil incarnate so yeah probably B.
---
Only if I get a notification that it's a Spirit or not so that I can... "prepare."
---
Nah I did upvote
---
What console? I literally never wait on ps4
---
It seems to be doing that a lot now I find where everyone but 1 person is the same rank, although to be honest rank 7 isnt that high of a rank sometimes they're still not very good they're just boosted lol.
---
Lol imma be testing this rn, sounds fun!!
---
This happens on every game, the Twitter/instagram account posts a cosplay/art/lore "boring" "we don't care" "fix your game" and it's pretty annoying like the guy who manages the account can actually do something and he's gonna fix the game right now while you're sitting your fat ass on the couch complaining the whole day because you lack of skill or willing to be better at the game &gt;:(
---
Bruh this is so fucking funny it makes me want to make an SJW Owned Compilation
---
It’s not bannable, but you are fucking yourself over, it’s better to hook both once you find the last guy, you get less emblem score for bleed outs
---
Ghostface likes to play games, I bet he gets along with The Pig.
---
He stood there like you can't stun god.....HOW DARE YOU
---
There’s a line between “I just have bad internet and it’s ruining everyone else’s fun and I’m going to whine about it” and “the one survivor who stayed in the lobby with red ping is complaining about lag switching”
---
Ya that has been happening a lot and then the other survs are usually lower rank. Ya but most of them just pallet loop for days against any killer and it’s getting kinda annoying not getting to play against fair survivor ranks
---
How to rotate text please
---
Ikr legion is so op lol
---
Survs just hookfarming each other.
---
Had a Nea run around behind the ghostface earlier because she was trying to suicide and I saved her, so she went around hookfarming her own team with him.
---
Wraith clanging the bell
---
Yeah... That's the other side of the coin. You finally get a match and it's 100% toxicity/tryhard central.
---
How would it not benefit you?
---
Btw I’m the person on the right not the left
---
HALLOWEEN II THEME INTENSIFIES
---
Nope. Never played siege or overwatch. So those comparisons dont work on me unfortunately. If you don't or can't answer my question then stop responding to me you absolute fucking cum guzzling retard.
---
A 5 rank difference isn’t that much tho, this is fine
---
Otz is a very good killer
---
Some killers cant take a hint.
---
I blocked the comments cause I don't want to scroll past a bunch of  links.
---
Nice! I love the look of the background and the perk icons. Keep up the great work OP.
---
Im trying to say that people always flame on others for playing characters that you like or perks,addons etc.
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
No. Bring bloody party streamers
---
He lacks map pressure, at higher tiers of play, that’s a major detriment, he’s low tier
---
If three gens get done simultaneously, maybe the killer needs to change how they play.
---
my favourite part is the creators comment "not mine, just added nips"
---
Dead By Tunneling
---
I don’t know how but i am finding matches pretty fast on ps4 as killer. Does being a rank 1 killer make it easier to find games?
---
He was clearly in a chase with someone else 
---
Also gens are done too fast why do you think Ruin is so fucking core
---
Yeah, it only works if its a syringe, that way you'll get the deep wounds out and heal another health state, if not its pretty worthless
---
Ninja leave no trace...
---
If I dced everytime this happened, I would be level 1 on every character
---
That’s not what I was saying I know discord can tank my WiFi so I don’t play killer then. I’m talking about only one survivor lagging then calling out the killer saying that the lag switched when no one else had the issue.
---
Aggressively nodding works really well I find
---
All I'm imagining is him moonwalking into the moonlight and tipping a hat at me

I'll farm with survivors but the nea is still dieing

Just like survivors DC after their first down
---
I think it’s out in Germany for some reason
---
not that cake my dude
---
I feel like a fnaf killer has a lot of potential and could help introduced liscenses killers from other games.
---
Aha, so again it's no ones fault but the survivor. But yes we are the entitled ones lmao. You sound really upset, I hope me in no way insulting you doesn't cause you to use quotes anymore.
---
No idea, I couldn't get away from the killer long enough throughout the game to be able to tell.
---
That made me chuckle
---
there was at least 1 but idk
---
He was stuck in the pallet what is he supposed just sit there and let you guys do gens
---
This shit always happens everytime. Just when killer matchmaking starts to get semi-on track it goes to shit and we're stuck with 15-45min just to open a lobby.
---
The report button is third from the right, btw. You seem to like downvoting my comments (like it does anything in a one on one conversation) so I thought I'd help you out. Maybe you needed a distraction from being a pedophile that you like discussing so much? Jesus Christ people like you wind me up. You probably spank your monkey over Greta Thunberg too. Disgusting.

&gt; You either want to balance around survs having teamwork and communication or you don't.
---
&gt; You can't just have OP shit running around with the excuse that "Oh some groups can communicate" because all that does is encourage those without groups to form them.
---
&gt; Yet we can't nerf top killers because communication exists in half the games?
---
Never talked about any of those things which you mentioned.
---
&gt; I'm not even disputing that SWF gives benefits
---
I know, I'm not disputing that the game shouldn't be balanced around communication.
---
Communication in dbd is a big issue because the game wasn't designed around having communication. That's all I said. All that you wrote is like I said "You can't add communication to the base game because then it would be broken. Remove SWF". You took what I said and turned it into something else I didn't say so you can attack it.
---
In fact actually for balancing around communication. Either nerfing/buffing people who are/aren't in SWF or base adding communication and buffing the killer.
---
Irs hard when you're facing survivors that are half your rank
---
I made a new cunt circle!
---
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, this is filth FILTH
---
The Doctor worked with the Entity to create the Iridescent King chess piece and take notes from the Carter’s notes series. 
---
Plague knows the Entity but as their Sea-Goat God. 
---
Spirit semi-knows the Entity. 
---
Nurse, Wraith and Trapper know the Entity first hand cause they all got tortured when they arrived.
---
I’m on PC but I’ve been playing as killer and I had like 3 games in a row where they didn’t even try and do gens, I just found them hiding in various places. Of course that didn’t stop them insulting me in chat afterwards
---
Did that to me once and pissed me the hell off
---
That actually pretty acuratte, I dont know why people complain so much. I het that the game has issues but its not like its broken and cant be played. I get that they want the game to be great but of course the devs are working on the problems every day
---
I thought SWF places groups at highest ranked team member now? The only way you should be going against 1-7 at rank 13 is if they are all solo and the game cant find enough people are your current rank to fill a lobby.
---
Yeah, they kept going back to the same gens over and over so it was pretty easy to keep track of them. Though I lost the same claudette in the cornfield about 4 times.
---
*laughs in Franklins demise*
---
Yeah, nothing we can really do about matchmaking, or bugs, or crashes, or anything else really. If only there were a company that we could pay money to address these things :(
---
I had 13/16 emblems. And one of my 3 golds was literally a pixel away from being iri. It’s so stupid, with survivor I can do jack shit, get the hatch, and get Adept no problem. If I go full on try hard as killer, even at low ranks, Adept refuses to happen. I killed the 4 survivors, I showed no mercy towards the survivors, but a fucking emblem dictates whether or not I was merciless instead of me literally showing no mercy towards the survivors and absolutely demolishing them? It’s just so frustrating.
---
Dwight stays inside a stick man the whole game?
---
Brought 3 Bloody Partys and a Grateu Cake. Killer brought an Ebony Mori and Morris us all after 1 hook...
---
Bing Bong this opinion is wrong. At worst Ghostface is a better Wraith. At best he’s a full speed T1 Myers who can still gen grab and jump scare all the way to the late game.
---
Ah-ah, x3.  
---
We are truly blessed on these days
---
Pretty sure one of the devs mentioned that it’s a mechanic of the game, that’s why killers are able to hit you if you stand on the other side of vault locations and why hillbilly can chainsaw you if you’re in mid vault or close to the vault location.
---
Ye
---
Every time I go against wraith it’s always one that camps
---
wow. this post is really vague. you do know you can be hit through a vault right
---
Yeah not even the second panel. Sup bro followed by tricking you to meat hook and then face camping and body beating for 2 minutes lol.
---
I’m not even saying you’re wrong, people shouldn’t host if their internet is potato powered
---
Feel free to tell people you owned me in this argument though, you really got me
---
I had a game the other day where we managed to get 4 gens done and I had gotten 2 of them. I was the last to be killed and the killer brought me to the hatch. I'm really bad at running from the killer so it wasn't too long a chase. Killer gave me hatch though.
---
So in the after game lobby I said thanks but my teammates started raging like "why'd you give him hatch! He didn't do anything! He didn't deserve it!!!!!!" Like bruh, let the killer be nice smh
---
Sucks for them. I'm sure they depipped as a result.
---
It might be talking about Trapper’s ultra-rare  add-ons that automatically sets traps every 30 second
---
Today we were farming bps with the Killer and this fucking bullshit happend. Four dead.
---
Awesome work, BHVR, awesome fucking work.
---
I hate tunneling but sometimes it really do be like that especially when they run past something important like the hatch.
---
killers can eat shit all they want, that's whatever, but i just really want some fucking teammates that aren't so god damn stupid and just play like they're actual red-ranked like i am.
---
Honestly and this may sound abit radical but why not just do away with scaling bp's altogether? Just make it so both parties all get the max of 32 k by default for staying till the end of the game.
---
We would still have the ranking system to tell use how we did individually that match but our ability to progress wouldn't be locked behind some arbitrary mini-game.  
---
It would also double to serve as a further incentive to not just dc as you could just make it so for every dc they need to play a complete match before they can earn bps again.
---
Better spend bro you're capped
---
Yes, it’s *actually* no one’s fault but the only survivor who is lagging. If the host has a decent connection 75% of the people playing this game he’s not the one at fault.
---
Not all of us want to farm every single time, you aren't entitled to it.
---
&gt; for DbD to improve upon its horror aspects, as far it is now, its just meme game,
---
DEFINITELY a shit meme game sadly :(
---
They need to revert it back to just a 4k for killer adept, making it emblem-based was a really weak move that doesnt make any sense.
---
Not bannable but a huge waste of time
---
ive been hit everytime while i was running out of the vault
---
Whole sub is survivor sided anyways lmao
---
same. tunnels one after another and camps.
---
definitely not a mechanic when it literally teleports me backwards into the hit
---
I’m not sure if they do or dump it out because of time constraints and I know they have said that when a update hits the live environment it reacts different then it does on the PTB or internal testing. What they need to do is restructure from the inside out and really start hiring some more competent people to code the game.  They also should dump the update out 3 weeks before for a few days and be able to identify the glitches the. Pull it all down and be able to fix it properly...
---
Boy have we had a doozy of a day
---
It works off the reverse method of getting points for BBQ, it's even easier to get points using it, unless if your team is bullying the killer and they can't get any hooks.
---
I always spin in circles in front of them. spinning is a sign of friendship.
---
Unless it has two abilities like the Demogorgon.
---
It took me 1 hour to find a match on ps4, what rank are you?
---
I play killer but do you escape them to not escape? The point is ESCAPING. Not fucking running around doing nothing, lmao yall killers are so braindead and ignorant
---
Perks like distressing still cap at 8k, it doesn't add onto it as a post game bonus. It just helps you max deviousness
---
Getting don’t starve together vibes
---
Oh god flashbacks to the not being able to escape glitch
---
Uhh it’s neither of those things though? Sure there are still a lot of bugs but it’s not unplayable enough to be classified as “broken”
---
Anywhere from rank like 8-16 depending on how recent the reset has been lol
---
I was hoping you had tombstone lol.
---
Vaults are fine, it’s either lag or you’re vaulting at bad times. Fast vault or not you can still get hit. We have no video clip to see so it’s kinda hard to know what happened. You said you got “pulled back into a hit” which means it’s lag.
---
I mean, I dont see anything wrong with it. Like he said, he has borrowed time, that's good since you can help your teammate and if the killer decides to tunnel, the person should take a hit to get a boost of speed and can just continue wasting the killers time. However like others mentioned it's only countered by certain killers. Which I should also mention, you didnt specify which killer you were up against.
---
Thank you, I didnt know that yet :D
---
Thank you, didnt know that yet :D
---
I played a game where a Claudette kept running into a corner where I couldn't make it to a hook when  I downed here there. I tried 3 times since I thought she'd stop struggling at some point and let me hook  her.  She did not, and kept running to the same spot.  I finally just stood over her to let her bleed out  and her teammate that was left had 1 gen to complete but just Urban evaded around the map until she died.  The hatch spawned right in front of where I was standing so I closed it and waited for the last guy to leave.  Well, he ended up walking up to me and died to the egc instead of opening a door and leaving. 
---
Anyway, no bans for bleedouts afaik since that's part of the game. Just don't BM while it happens or Mori cancel over and over.  That could get you banned for harassment.
---
Then what item should they bring?
---
Not disagreeing, just wondering xd
---
It procs on that too.
---
I usually hit mine. When it “misses” it’s usually a lag spike
---
Laurie probably isn’t too happy about it though
---
That sounds pretty annoying tbh, 1 slug is the standard. No one bats an eye because it's a solid strategy but slugging 2 and bleeding one is pretty toxic
---
No. It is just the sheer number of items in a game atm. at least 3/4 survivors in the vast majority of games have an item. The usually get 3 gens done by the time I can get a hook.
---
I read that. I will “as before experience” which I assume means it would be like I don’t have dedicated servers, which i do want
---
The timer is bugged. It might have been they thought there was more time to BM you.
---
Who the fuck is Lisa
---
nahh they didn't do this by mistake; we just goofed off all match and i let them get their emblem points, my reward was that clip apparently :D
---
Small game has been like that for years, perks have to be specific as traps is just very vague. But whilst being specific they use big boy words like tremendously instead of a percentage
---
But, why?

---
First of all, I am not "one of them", read what I said again...
---
Second, survivors who sweat so hard that I can smell them when the round begins,, pop my ruin in 30 seconds and blind me behind every pallet are not looking to farm.
---
I had not a single "let's farm" sign in any game, they all played normal.
---
Also, I do not play for BP. Sure it is nice to get a lot, but I am way more satisfied to destroy a cocky SWF cancer group.
---
Lastly, since ever I started to play, survivors have rarely been anything but toxic cunts and I've had it. Only themselves to blame and at this point I don't care about "collateral damage" anymore, I just want to see them DIE.
---
(sole exception are low ranking/baby survivors who are obviously new)
---
I had a game, against ghost face who morid someone 2 people after there first hooks. But me and a meg did 3 gens and stayed alive for a good amount of time. 16k game and secured a pip at rank 3. Thought the game was over before it started but you can always bring shit back if you play your best
---
I'd be down, I have one friend who is really good and we duo but always find selfish teammates. What do you play on?? We're on xbox unfortunately lol
---
Wow that’s brutal, I’m never going to stay in the endgame-
---
the last place I expected to find a jojos reference...
---
Good shit right here
---
I can't believe they actually showed those cute little kids being eaten. Why?!?! 😫😫😫
---
Ya only mori spam is as it stops them from moving and recovering so it’s “holding the game hostage” and it lengthens their timer on floor
---
You need to actually be using the med kit in order for it to work. For example start using the medkit and immediately hit M2 ir anytime while using the Medkit and the add-on will be used
---
Yeah, the very next game I played I got 16/16 so I got the achievement now, but it’s so annoying that there’s such a difficulty gap between survivor’s Adept and killer’s.
---
Are you hitting M2 while you’re healing? You start healing with the medkit, then hit M2 when you don’t have a skill check to use the syringe.
---
If only
---
I mean then you could just fuck around and let the killer kill everybody instantly. I think a certain amount of bp for finishing the game would be good though. Maybe like 5-10k for finishing. Bp incentivizes people to actually do things. Without it it would just be a farming simulator. 
---
I think the most logical thing would be to just max it if you live. I mean you survived. What else is there to survival other than surviving?
---
In the movies, Myers occasionally did that kind of thing, inspecting whatever weapon he just murderized someone with. It just looks really silly in first person
---
What was your ping in the lobby then?  This happens to me me when there is more than 200 ping.  It's just that you feel like you are already out of vaulting, but your client is behind the killers since he is the host.
---
i fucking love Rango
---
Okay thanks for the info.
---
They always fricking slug one survivor when 1 vs 2 situation for the god damn 4k i always dc when i see that
---
The FPS is capped on purpose and messing with the files is bannable. The only file that can be changed and you won’t be banned most of the time items, character icons, and perk icons. You could try to send in a ticket but they probably won’t respond.
---
ah, ok thanks for that. Wasted up to 5 of those to try and figure that one out
---
And that's why I've been using small game every match.  Also, balanced landing is ridiculously good in the hawkins map.
---
Yeah but it will still take perk slot, it would be for those who prefer safety over being faster etc. It would encourage variety.
---
Huh I wish I got this lucky. (if this ever happened I bet survivors would have a "accidental internet failure"
---
I would not call it shit, but its definetly inferior to Friday 13th the game.
---
Yeah but DS? Unless you go for the tunnel...
---
We play on PC and it is to the point where my girlfriend asks the lobby if anyone is running urban. If someone says “yes” she dodges. It’s like if a survivor has urban and self care it’s an auto loss.
---
Wtf is this even from lmao
---
How about no.
---
Filthy frank I guess
---
Still really shitty. Would be fine for cosmetics but like damn, literally in game advantages you need to re-grind for
---
So Addons which are category-related also dont stack above the cap?
---
It's cause you're not on a pc, you're on a mac. Cause that sounds exactly like trying to game on a mac.
---
You can imagine the sweat with some of these killers. 
---
Wish I could see their face as we DC. 
---
Probably smash something up in real.
---
Ohhh ok that makes a ton of sense now
---
The game has been improved and optimized to run on a platforms, even the switch handheld. 
---
PC is a mixed bag as there are too many configurations to work with. Regardless, if you're having issues that's not driver related you either lack the CPU, GPU &amp; RAM or a combination of all of those for it to not run.
---
Shouldn't have teabagged 🤷‍♂️
---
This is so cute, who made this?
---
This hurts me dearly but I made a fix to their power
---
Trust me it's not perfect but it's better
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/da44v2/a_rework_to_legions_power/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Yeah it's really not worth using on console until dedicated servers come in
---
Legion goes 125% but only for the first hit, can't use scratch marks or blood trails (meaning jukes with iron will are a thing), takes a fatigue that's way too long even with their add-ons, and even loses half of their max power when basic attacking outside of feral for no god damn reason. Not to mention, if you use their power for map traversal, you have no power in chase.
---
Yes, you can get 4ks as Legion. I do often. But I also get obliterated if the survivors are competent, because he has no power except what boils down to a worse plague's. You can be as good as you want, but survivors still have the power role against killers not named Spirit or Nurse.
---
Even though I've read, this was not a BHVR bannable offense, they've been very upfront about the anti-cheat software saying that if you do get banned, there is little to nothing they can do to reverse it.
---
Problem is I could've just stood on top of it, so she would have to slap me, and then at that point I'd still have enough time to hop in, if not she'd have to pick me up before closing the hatch, and then I still use DS and get out.
---
Err, no.
---
It works like this:
---
Lets say you get 10K points. 
---
4 BBQ stacks = bonus 10K points (100% more BP)
---
Bloodhunt = bonus 10k points
---
BPS = bonus 10k points for each bps played.
---
So BBQ, bloodhunt, and BPS will only net you 3x, not 8x
---

---
Hi, your hitbox is there until you actually land on the ground.
---
Happy cake ha
---
Never in my gaming career have I ever been banned for modifying an ini file that changes fps, even in games with a way more strict anti cheat. Are you sure that's why you got banned? Cause tons of people including myself have changed the ini file. Everyone saying it's bannable is wrong, it's literally the file where you change fps, sensitivity, full screen options etc.
---
I understand that. I just feel some survivors do apprciate getting some extra BPs and such. Though I do get what you mean
---

---
Every game bro, every game
---
Since the survivors just have to escape, the killers should just need a 4k
---
ya i just had to verify the files and my fps is still high and i’m unbanned
---
Bum ba dum bum bum bum bum
---
Oh that makes sense. Hope you guys had big fun
---
Technically she didn’t do anything but bitch moan and protest. I didn’t like her speech because the way she spoke was over dramatic. She claims old people are going to the younger for solution, took her childhood (this was where I almost stopped watching because it made 0 sense) and was generally unaware.

The UN has had projects to help our earth since that one lady was elected. I’m gonna look back through my notes and find the link but the UN has been actively working on our environment for years starting with plastic production the burning of which is a leading cause for pollution alongside car emission of CO2. C02 is was traps heat on our planet we are currently 50ppm of CO2 too high which is why many places are much hotter than they used to be.
---
Thank you for the silver kind internet stranger
---
Survivors body blocking other survivors or body blocking the killer? Because body blocking the killer can be countered
---
Anxiety ITS OVER 90000000000000000
---
What's the harm?  
---
It's true that they always break the game with new updates.
---
You can destroy the hags runes with a flashlight.
---
This is amazing. Id buy all the costumes if they ever released them.
---
I mean, I've been bringing Brand New Parts solely to get the Objective farming done faster to move on to the other ones.
---
And we see why I hate getting Killer dailies.
---
Smack gens or run after people without hitting them. They'll get the hint.
---
no it’s fixed lol, still have the high fps just had to verify my files thanks for being nice though
---
why'd you have to pick the ugliest character in the game
