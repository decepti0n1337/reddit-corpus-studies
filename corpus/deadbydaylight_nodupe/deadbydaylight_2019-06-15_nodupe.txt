only unlock teachables that you really need.

---
So you‚Äôre like ‚Äúoh, the killer isn‚Äôt tunneling. Imma wait 30 seconds before fixing that gen!‚Äù. Good to know
---
She's not a killer I ever have problems escaping from.
---
Might have been the scarred hand.
---
You look entitled with your ‚Äúplay normally‚Äù.
---
Thanks! :D
---
Did you say Ash? I think you misspoke. That's the build you run after you break your leg, because you need to limp around on crutches.
---
The rules said no excessive gore
---
How fast did he die? Haha.
---
there's a difference between people playing survivor and all the terribad nerds who "main"
---
He Was Basic Threw Every Pallet Down And Didn‚Äôt Know How To Mind Game.So Is Say In 5 Minutes.He Even Got Saved 2 Times.
---
What a compliment!
---
[removed]
---
Actually before even that he had to be tested since he was never tested and John only test people with something wrong. Because in the beginning of making the angel trap Amanda said so when are you going to be tested knowing he will be tested. 
---

---
Also that envelope had to be made way before John Kramer‚Äôs death also He swallowed the tape which Hoffman found.
---
Since he helped with the angel trap I always am curious if he made traps impossible to a point.
---
Maybe I‚Äôm biased since I like Amanda more then Hoffman but I know there was something wrong with Hoffman
---
There‚Äôs a strange, kinda sadistic enjoyment, to be found in salty messages, especially if you played fairly. 
---
The only thing that makes it better is when, as the killer, the survivors take your side in the post game chat
---
You ain‚Äôt kidding , ugh. Like where‚Äôs the sense of originality.
---
This is a fair point. Cut everything's price in half, but double the rarity of higher-level add-ons. They should appear in about the same amount of BP spent as of currently.
---
I thought we were going with killers anonymous
---
Fair enough.  I'm still new to many things in this game.  üòÖ
---
Yea I‚Äôm a Feeling It Right Now Lol
---
or you know, don't put things that effect game play behind a gate in the first place so the only thing people have to deal with is a skill gap.. not skill + gear\perk\whatever gap.
---
I meant when survivors dc
---
 You should go for add ons that reduce cooldown speed and ones that increase the Feral Frenzy timer
---
I love this catto already
---
They had US in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
Probably a NOED user tbh.
---
"Wahhhh wahhh why is everyone complaining about NOED??"
---
"ThIs Is WhAt YoU aLl SoUnD lIkE!!1!"
---
"How does everyone expect me to play like an actual killer and not rely on my crutch NOED for kills??!"

But the perk in the given situation has no real value to the survivor - only the killer. OP states that the survivor running it can loop him. If a survivor that was terrible at looping can see the killers aura then I can see it having use - the survivor can try and avoid the killer. If the survivor thats running OoO, as per this situation, is merely running it to get the killer to go for them, then, it has no value other than showing the killer where they are. If the survivor in the situation given was running any other perk they could merely fast vault repeatedly to draw in the killer. Here is only advantage is giving the killer precise eyes on the survivor as well as reducing the survivors perks by one.
---
tysm &lt;3
---
Another example of a survivor saying "It's ok when I do it but bullshit when you do it".
---
How about "If a survivor DCs while loading, the killer's mori shouldn't be burnt on a game that never started?"
---
ya know you won when ya get hate messages
---
Lol. I think I faced you the other day.
---
Wow this guy really is something else. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with the Spirit besides maybe the husk going away addon. Wow that was something else.
---
They have the people, but all the head developer wants is content instead of fixes. If they made only 2 killers a year, but put most of those devs into weekly bug fixes, this game would be so less broken and have a lot of QoL that it lacks.
---
Queue as swf everyone except one use bloody partystreamers. 1 of your team disconnects once everyone farmed. Repeat.
---
That's why.
---
I'd recommend checking out r/dbdLFG! It's a bit of a smaller subreddit, but there are always people there looking for teammates, and you can always make your own post there.
---
Oh. My bad, then I kinda agree.
---
wow an actual hacker
---
People DC whenever someone cleanses
---
As Killer, I play Wraith and spam my bing bong on top of a hill or something. Survivors will almost always work on generators and ignore you at first though. When there's like 1 gen left, sometimes they'll come out and farm with you, lead you to pallets, do healing circles, etc.
---
And it's all hit or miss tbh. Some people just want to play the game and some people would rather just go to the next game if they know the one they're in is going to be a long dragged out farming game. Just keep trying and you'll hopefully get something good!
---
*And blinded
---
More of a Ed Gein skin imho
---
really cool take on the spirit :)
---
Sure, because camping is not acting like a dick towards person on the hook. Don't try to excuse one terrible behaviour with another. Teabagging at least still allows you to play a game, camping prevents that for everyone.
---
Just subtract the bps points then
---
That‚Äôs true as well. Also I forgot Hoffman tried helping with the rack trap and it didn‚Äôt help. 
---
But yes it is implied he did heavy lifting. 
---
I‚Äôm sure Hoffman could make simple basic traps nothing to the point of where John could do.
---
You stay awake too, my friend) which console you on?
---
I Get That Too But Whenever I Do I Stop For 5 Mins And Then Test Internet Connection.
---
Oh boy yeah
---
Sometimes lol
---
Now that's podracing
---
üòÇ it‚Äôs hard enough getting the dang door open when the killer has only two exits to watch... but the timer is even worse lol
---
Wow a concept skin that isn‚Äôt spirit. I love you man
---
Love the spicy hate messages like that, especially when you know you didn't do anything wrong :)
---
Watch ‚Äúfinal chapter‚Äù and all those are his, very rudimentary nothing he couldn‚Äôt hook up from some YouTube I think.
---
PS. :( I know nothing about XB community but I imagine you're rarer than us. At least my neighbours in Asia seem to like maining sleepy boi.
---
Anybody who sacrifices themselves is a hero in a nurse game that gets that close
---
Yeah I watched all those but I think John had all the instructions written out on a paper since most the targets where his and he had to make the traps special to them.
---
*He's back*
---
Oh god fuck it‚Äôs haunted grounds
---
It's not like it 100% locks it from happening. Plus once you learn the spawns for gens what use is it rly...
---
I really enjoy the saw movies it‚Äôs nice to see I‚Äôm not alone
---
if a survivor leaves, it starts the match over and everyone keeps their offerings though
---
In all my playtime I only ran into one other P3 Quentin, I mostly play with Megs tbh
---
Her jagged movements would suit this theme soooo much
---
Mhm thats what I'm talking about.
---
1000000/10 toxic af. 
---
I love it
---
Same here and I like debating and figuring out things so thank you. Also I‚Äôm excited for the new saw movie they‚Äôre working on.
---
Nothing wrong with that IMO as long as everyone is in on it. When people DC I try to guide the survivors to it. I think it can also be good to go into a match with people to experiment with things and farm. Wish there was more  to do to show people the ropes and get   some practice where they aren't thinking oh crap oh crap and have to worry about being a drag on the rest. Easy with a bunch of friends if you've got them.     I think what makes this series of thoughts appealing to me is the amount of salt for leveling a new toon with that toon instead of farming points on your main.
---
Yeah there were a few other perks people suggested too, but if you saw the whole game I wouldn‚Äôt have lasted without my set up, maybe if I could 360ü§î
---
I can‚Äôt get past ‚Äúsearching for match‚Äù as the killer....
---
Like it won‚Äôt create a lobby for survivors to join
---
The doctor doesn't like to be disturbed during his..... Showering sessions
---
Tbh I'd be cool with that for a bit. Seems to be a good selection of killers from what I'm seeing so might as well take time to balance some killers who may be weak (cough, Freddy, cough) and fix any issues the game has. To bad they probably won't do it :(
---
thats why ‚Äòmy post‚Äô has a salt flair. it means i can write whatever i want shitty or not....r u illiterate or u have a brain damage and cannot read?  
---
ur dc reports dont work DARLING as u r the host and behaviour legally IS not allowed to control ur connection. now take that and put it in ur as@@@le:) 
---
p.s btw by being the host u r allowing the survivor to reach ur IP easily and he can force the dc from ur side! 
---
see u in the fog honey
---
I've said it before but mechanically there should be hardcore punishments for camping and tunnelling. Like... decisive should be built in and not be a 1 time use hardcore. Killers bitch and moan about perks like Borrowed time and decisive like they don't think they're the reason they exist the way they do. 
---
But naturally I think toxic behavior should include tunnelling and camping and I think it should carry hardcore punishments. Like...if ur camping a hook you get stunned for 10 seconds, enduring doesn't lower the stun value, and ur hitbox collision goes away. If you tunnel, the Survivior gets to use DS more than once and the stun duration doubles when used the second time.
---
If you did tunnel, shame on you. If you did camp, shame on you. 
---
If not. Ignore them
---
I think u need to quit assuming I don't play killer. I play killer all the time and I know what each of the terms mean so u can keep ur quick wuts to urself. Camping I mean proxy/facecamping even if no other survivors around. Tunneling I mean chasing a single person til they are dead before going after someone else. And slugging by downing 3-4 ppl before picking a single one up. Don't try to down me.
---
Very cool!
---
If your on Ps4 you can go in the community and go in games and go on Dbd and you should find a bunch of trhem
---
Mines fine ? Been playing for the last three hours ?
---
Americans voting for Trump...thats wrong! not a game and its community...plz log off! actually better delete ur account!
---
Legion would be more appropriate.
---
They already are not including survivors and maps on half the new chapters for the year, so they might as well get rid of two chapters anyway and fix the problems.
---
That works, but the chances of that happening are slim to none
---
Y(Oinks) hands down best pun
---
No. Many people that play this game are stupid. Just look at the comments of people that think being in the broken state all game is how you "counter" plague
---
I disagree, but whatever floats your boat, I guess. 
---
&gt;her phasing noise is simply a warning for survivors
---
That's literally my entire point. That *is* part of her drawback, since it alerts survivors to her presence while phasing. Removing that warning is OP.
---
Not for that reason but sometimes I wish I could take back hooking someone. Usually it‚Äôs when there‚Äôs two survivors left, and I realize that the other survivor has done nothing but hide all game, and refuses to help the person they are left with. It‚Äôs usually a Claud who found hatch and is just camping it. I frequently let the last survivor go and it always sucks when I realize I chose the wrong person to let live.
---
I did too.
---
*from being shot in the fucking neck*
---
At least the killer still gets to play the game. A Survivior who gets tunneled and camped just flat out doesn't get to
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna pretend I didn‚Äôt see that‚Äù
---
You‚Äôd be suprised
---
Yea you'll see, give it a month and it'll be all good :)
---
If they left the last 3 gens near each other, it‚Äôs their own fault. You‚Äôre good.
---
i love lag switching survivors when they stand on a hill waiting for me to come xd
---
No it wasn‚Äôt.
---
"How do I survive?"
---
"Don't get hit."
---
K.
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm so glad people enjoyed it as much as I do
---
Thank you! Had a lot of fun making it, especially the graduation cap on Dwight
---
Its a meme bruh chiiiiiiillllllllll
---
May I ask what rank this is? What you said, I noticed the habits of those survivors that do that around 15-20. I was on PC( been had it on PC, but  rather play on Xbox) to play cause Xbox DBD server was down, I‚Äôm rank 20, and for the past 2 hours I was playing, it happened frequently, like nobody helped or anything. And just sat at the hatch, so I definitely know the pain. It‚Äôs barely playable, teammates like that are selfish.
---
I get stuck on this pallet EVERY SINGLE TIME I get hit by it. I‚Äôve already sent two many tickets about it. I‚Äôve been able to get out of it once. Last time it happened I messaged the Auevivors and told them ‚Äúwelp I‚Äôm stuck...lol Gg‚Äù I guess they felt bad, and the Survivors were trying to help me, so one vaulted the pallet a few times to try and push me out, it pushed me far enough to be able to get a break pallet prompt. I let them farm as a thanks. :)
---
I feel the same was a survivor I wish there was a perk where when I leave the exit gates I can come back in and teabag the killer some more.
---
How old do we have to be
---
Nah you're good. If I get hooked next to an exit door when all gens are done, that's on *me*. 
---
If the killer has NOED, sometimes I'll just sacrifice myself to save my teammates the trouble of saving me.
---
Is the leather one confirmed to be Hoffman?
---
Thank you! Had a lot of fun making it, especially the graduation cap on Dwight (thanks to a help of a friend)
---
yeah or animals running around
---
??? Literally no one is talking about Ghostface getting a nerf
---
I do that allllll the time. There are so many times I‚Äôll leave a person slugged or out right pick them back up myself to go find someone else because of some really crazy hits that shouldn‚Äôt have landed.
---
Well they're technically not wrong.
---
On topic I don't really play Huntress but if you have good access to perks running long-distance tracking perks like BBQ and Whispers can be really good. Sloppy Butcher is also nice on Huntress since it's relatively easy to deal damage to Survivors but sometimes you'll have to let Survivors go when the loop is too good or you run out of hatchets.
---
As for hitting hatchets aim for when a Survivor is locked into an animation, namely dropping a pallet or vaulting. The Survivor can't juke during this time which will make hitting them easier.
---
Thanks for the advice. Wish I had BBQ on my wraith for that
---
Sweet a free kill
---
Your games working?
---
[Here's a list of side-effects](https://imgur.com/a/ypinntd) to know if you are affected.
---
Everyone is going to tell you Meyers in this subreddit. Just FYI.
---
Me and the boys seeing the 20th recreation of this meme for Dead by Daylight characters.
---
How do you submit to the contest, I'm currently working on a WW1 style plague and want to submit it
---
Something can‚Äôt be confirmed and teased if it‚Äôs fanmade.
---
The Test Subject is a combination of the outfit Amanda wore in Saw 1 and Saw 3.
---
Rip I actually feel stupid for forgetting that
---
Yep just tried a few mins ago
---
Who the actual fuck is trolling and DCing during the Bloodhunt? And I thought the cucks bringing Brand New Parts to hard gen rush were assholes.
---
You uninstall orrr
---
As much as people hate it, Camping is a viable strategy in DbD, especially with certain killers like the Hag for example.  
---
 I see your point. Camping is not always deliberately done as perks will change gameplay. A survivor may have a perk that shows them the 3 closest generators and they may choose to leave them till last so the can keep an eye on the gate
---
Nope just happened when I turned it back on
---
He‚Äôs broken he needs one
---
Just saying, it‚Äôs pretty much proper etiquette to hide Gamer tags of periods. Even if they are a jack ass.
---
I‚Äôd pay for Shaggy Dwight in a heartbeat
---
Ypu reset your console?
---
Why does everyone look weird accept trapper lol
---
And I'm pretty sure a lot of people would be happy with you leaving dcing is toxic and if you find it fun why the hell are you even playing then you aren't actually playing the game you are just quitting when the game is being played
---
You know connections aren't static right and can change after the match starts
---
Definitely for the licensed cosmetics. Not sure about the rest.
---
Those are some nice goalposts you moved friend. Do this often?
---
I dont  care about age. But like I said we have a dark sense of humor and depending on which one of us it is we are kinda messed up on our own thing. I just dont want someone that gonna report us every 30 seconds. I should probably have a new recruit watch an Anthony Jeselnik special or Jim Norton comedy special and see if that's their thing first lol
---
I mean he probably will since you can activate his 1 shot during a Chase which will most likely mean he will get his stalk decay back but besides that I don't see him getting nerfed a whole lot.
---
I haven't tried Ghostface yet but the fact that he can teabag back makes him godtier to me.
---
I turned it off an hour ago and then dropped a deuce and showered, turned it back.on and it was fine
---
I‚Äôm 12 if that doesn‚Äôt matter and I love dark humor
---
I got it now. There was a small bug.
---
I got it now thanks
---
Had you not dawdled you would've made it for sure.
---
When are dedicated servers dropping again? When they first announced they said June 2019.
---
Also how about fixing issues such as if you're running at a window holding sprint it shouldn't have the option to slow vault. That and pallet stuns. Either the survivor gets hit and they cant throw the pallet or the killer is stunned and dont get the hit.
---
You can‚Äôt mix the jacket with the pants, head, and weapon. There‚Äôs only three parts of her outfit; Head, Body, and Weapon. Hate to burst your bubble.
---
Yeah dc'ing is fine, they should just tag frequent dcer's with some kind of symbol so people know they're shitbags.
---
In some cases it‚Äôs a viable strategy. In others, the killer is desperate not to get deranked
---
Your linked article directly states it's being made by NextGames. 
---
&gt;Looking to capitalize on the mainstream success of *Stranger Things*, Netflix **recently announced a new partnership with Next Games** to develop a brand new *Stranger Things* video game.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;‚ÄúOur core focus will be to deliver on Stranger Things‚Äô rich and  intense themes like friendship and supernatural adventure, and translate  these into snack-sized entertainment on your mobile device,‚Äù **Next Games  CEO Teemu Huuhtanen** said in a press release.
---
Behaviour has nothing to do with the upcoming mobile Stranger Thing game or season 3 game.
---
The response tweet by MCote, the lead of DbD and one of the main people responsible for licensing, is an obvious tease.
---
Fix gens, perform 2-3 hook rescues and try your best to at least pip every game so you can get out of those ranks.
---
I hate pallets...
---
Understandable. We all find out about this at some point early on.
---
Anyone else has spongebob movie flashbacks?
---
Give them their own queue. Nobody will play the game in it and games may last like 1-2 minutes.
---
Sounds fun
---
I can confirm this
---
I agree with this. As someone who just started half a year ago grinding up perk tiers just to be able to stand a fighting chance is not fun. And I'd argue the huge grind is what makes many new players nope out of the game.
---
It's on the internet so it must be true.
---
Well, they are gonna start punishing it, so see ya
---
Bloody party streamers are like my bad luck charm. I never use them anymore :(
---
I love the downvoting ur getting bc ur absolutely right. That's why Nurse is so good bc she can just throw herself at Surviviors to keep applying pressure across the entire map. If other killers understood that there'd be less camping and tunnelling going on
---
At least, they didn‚Äôt rage quit at the last minute and it stopped you from earning an achievement
---
I‚Äôm gonna assume those two are the Bigfoot of This game.
---
I'm gonna look at your profile and if all your posts are about buffs for survivors, your opinion is false.
---
What he doesn‚Äôt post is the 4th person who said ‚Äúgg ez get good you camper‚Äù
---
For sure!
---
I mean ok, maybe I implied that they should be playing a bit fairer considering the circumstances but Jesus, this is exactly what‚Äôs wrong with this community.
---
Nice build! Prove thyself and autodidact are just beautiful perks together.
---
Oh Got It I‚Äôll Do That Next Time
---
Agree
---
Scratch marks, sounds and notifications are all kinds janky rn
---
Add some creaky tree noises and it' be really spooky
---
You are really something else lol. Ever thought about being a professional IT consultant because you seem to know very much about networks. 
---
Get off reddit.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
I was wondering why its been so slow these past few days
---
You don't need more BP is they just made the BW bigger and put more perks per BW, also letting you take 2 perks instead of 1 at level 50+ or something.
---
How the fuck have you been playing for a week and already have all these teachables
---
That is so awesome.
---
In my opinion it‚Äôs good manners to tell people you‚Äôre looking to farm, gives them the chance to find a new lobby if they don‚Äôt want to and if they do they can slap on their offerings and farming perks.
---
That Little Bump Of Him Hitting The Door Costed Her Life
---
The reason it takes so much longer to find a match as a killer is because there are far more killers playing since they receive a higher average amount of BP per game
---
This would actually be dope af in-game
---
Thought this was garlic up close
---
Praise from Caesar üò≠, thank you!

Tbh I‚Äôm scared for console frame rate if rain gets added on some of the maps.

Boom.
---
Thanks!
---
 Forgot about that. I was saving them, didnt know whether to get the pigs outfits or not. Now i know!@
---
Th anks!
---
That's part of the risk of playing as solo survivor.
---
Getting slammed in the face by pallets all the time will do that to you
---
It's still been burning my moris recently.
---
Xbox has blood hunt are you dumb
---
I really hope they don't revert any of the buffs on the live patch.
---
A guy told me hes rank 1 even after reset. Also he said hes a navy seal that did three tours....are you saying he could lie to me about that?
---
where's the DC on their first down
---
Truth.
---
What's the alternative for survivors?
---
I lost two BPS in a row tonight from killers disconnecting instantly. That sucked.
---
Myers. Imo he's the the funnest to play. Has a better stalking ability than GF and has a great late game capabilities.
---
I personally dislike The PLAG. But I don't really have a reason to DC against her
---
Throw axe. Win big.
---
That's a nice find nice to know where you can get one if you are ever gonna do a cosplay
---
If I ever do cosplay you bet your ass I‚Äôm gonna spam the shit out of that flashlight
---
Hahaha definitely if you run into someone cosplaying one of the killers
---
F
---
Actually this has been happening the past few days. I would like to say it‚Äôs related to gamepass since Gamepass made it free
---
When I saw the T-Bag I legit didn‚Äôt think of T-Baging I thought of the British and I‚Äôm like, Wait British people are usually the rude ones? 
---
I love when things don‚Äôt click immediately.
---
To be fair - without the speed increase from the hit she 100% wouldnt have made it. That hit at least gave her a chance
---
So are you telling me to snuggle up to Michael Myers and pet him?
---
I don't think it matters on the survivor side, they're just skins once you've got the teachables you don't ever have to play that survivor again. Personally I have P3 Dwight with all survivor perks, when a new one drops I level them and then him.
---
As for killers I think it's a preference thing it's well believed that Nurse, Billy and Myers are the most popular and normally the easiest way to rank 1 but I do it with Hag and if you hit up YouTube you'll see people using even the " weakest" killers at rank 1 so as for making killers viable? That's not really a thing imo. You just need practice patience and experience to learn how to mind game and best approach each map. 
---
I don't know the best way to ease the grind is (other than BBQ and WGLFE) but then I don't think it's broken either.  Don't worry about getting everything and being the best of the best just enjoy it, remember it's just a game and Ruin isn't as important as the YouTubers make out.
---
I would like the ability to swap universal add-ons between characters. Even if it cost a little bit.
---
Like dumping ALL my lery's memorial offerings from all my killers into Myers haha.
---
Fucking FACTS. and tbh IDC about downvotes. Ik all the ppl doing it are campers/tunnelers themselves and would like nothing more to make me mad
---
No u
---
Why does everyone call pif GF
---
Misstype but boy 400k would be some improvement xD
---
&gt;It's not like it 100% locks it from happening
---
So a perk is only good if it's infallible?
---
Yes.
---
you have to draw the game before you can play it
---
did you spawn as killer or survivor?
---
Did you just admit to lag switching?
---
reverse search comes up with Cannon links
---
This is beyond SCIENCE MY LADS
---
That doesn't make sense, Billy can activate his one shot during chase, except people can cancel his one shot. You can turn off billy's chainsaw by looking at it :p
---
TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AND THE DEVS REFUSE TO TOUCH NOED OR EVEN ADD A TOTEM COUNTER
---
This happened to me lol I dont know why I was playing survivor with a friend and I had to dashboard
---
hes just the better player am i right ?!?
---
Just got the game two days ago, I always let at least one person leave
---
They call Pig Pig. GF, or Ghost Face, is the Ghost Faced Killer from Scream.
---
Right. I don't think perk tier changes is right since it would only take about 67 levels to have all perks. This game is supposed to be a grind, this would just help get the perks faster, but not have everything too quickly and still grind for items.
---
I would keep WGLF until the 2x bloodpoints event ends. Maybe replace Urban Evasion with borrowed time or an exhaustion perk(maybe Sprint burst or Dead Hard) for now. 
---
After the event ends bring back Evasion, and replace WGLF with the two suggested above.
---
You greatly understand low skilled survivor mains. They don't want strong killers, period. And any killer who even seems strong, even if it's against low rank survivors that they are doing most of their damage, will get asked to be nerfed.
---
And BHVR has a history of nerfing killers from their PTB version. I think it's a real threat, and Tru3 is right to get out in front of this and tell BHVR not to make another stupid mistake with a killer.
---
Stranger Things is doing a crossover with Fortnite.  They know who to side with when it comes to making $$
---
This video is amazing.  Crazy cats get me every time.
---
He is a stealth killer and Billy isn't a stealth killer. you can see where I'm going. I don't think a stealth killer should have his stealth ability activate while in a chase that's what the 45 second exposed effect is for.
---
Love your name
---
No one has ever said that it‚Äôs toxic?
---
Hell yea brother cheers from iraq
---
Who wouldn‚Äôt side with Fortnite it only makes sense from a business perspective.
---
I did this when I was Freddy, it was funny watching the survivor's be a little paranoid after the gate opened
---
I don't think reduced cost would be a good thing. 
---
Getting rid of perk tiers is alright.
---
i did not expect to see gabbie hanna on this subreddit let me tell you
---
I don't understand how running meta perks is salty.
---
Except for MOM. Fuck that shit.
---
I knew there was something going on with scratch marks...
---
...Feng?
---
GASP I commented on that post. Whack.
---
survivor
---
You are better off saving them because it only stacks on another 100 percent. You can use them to make normal games double bp which usually works better than trying for the triple bp
---
This happened to me as survivor after a match I was in got DC'd by the host, only mine was on title screen
---
confusing stuff
---
Oh I'm a idiot
---
r/bonehurtingjuice
---
I got kicked out of a game and lost 10 levels of progress :(
---
Yea exactly, it's nice thou that we still get some famous stuff on DbD like Ash and Ghostface, and of course the other killers they have snagged up. Stranger Things is cool, but the classic horror we get is better.
---
lol
---
Dwight. Someone do it to 'ya fella'?
---
That kinda scares me. I was like that when I was 12 but the way xbox is it could end badly
---
Yes, absolutely, I've been on Reddit
---
BIGGER BOOT
---
How could it end badly
---
The classic horror wouldn‚Äôt suit Fortnite anyways. Stranger Things suits Fortnite more then it does Dbd as well. While it would be nice I just don‚Äôt see how it would fit. Maybe a survivor that would be cool but it would have to be Nancy whom I like. 
---
Killer? I mean unless dbd finally goes out of there bounds they won‚Äôt do a non humanoid type Character. 
---
Also I love Classic Horror &lt;3
---
What was the buff?
---
What am absolute bitch.
---
Man I would wish they put legions masks in watch dogs 3 but wont happen

---
Haha good joke, because it‚Äôs perfectly ok for his ability to see you for 4 seconds and then proceed to expose you for 45 seconds. While now he has to be in the CENTER of your screen to break him out of stalk, while you could be face to face with him and it won‚Äôt break him out. And my opinion is false? You‚Äôre just ignorant to the facts they made him way to strong
---
Yup
---
So youre telling us that legion detained you, detained?
---
Someone watched monto, lmao.
---
I would also like to add that the way he even got me in the first place was by body blocking me in a corner with a generator and repeatedly stabbing me.
---
tfw watch dogs got a playable old lady but dbd doesn't. get on that shit bhvr
---
Will never understand how Ghostface is not okay yet Hillbilly with an instadown chainsaw with massive map pressure is okay.
---
Use your eyes bigboi
---
ever thought about minding ur own business and giving ur garbage advice when asked?....u racist pig!! complaining about asians! lol
---
u get off reddit!!!
---
Well fuck me and my cheapskate ass.
---
the only tip I can think of is throwing hatchets when a survivor is unhooking someone, vaulting, or waiting for them to drop a pallet so you can yeet one of those little buggers at them.
---
I had the same problem this past week and finally got it somewhat taken care of today. I put in a ticket and they suggested they can wipe all my progress (all characters are lvl 1 and loss of perks) since there isn't a fix for it right now and I didn't want to miss out on the 2x bloodpoints. 
---
They haven't done it yet but they will also be refunding me all of the bloodpoints I've spent so far in the game. I figured I will use all of this to get me back to where I was before the reset. At least I can play the game now and get more bloodpoints for later though. I just hate being back to lvl 1 on all the characters.
---
Ok, day two of playing him. Here are some thoughts:
---
He's better than I gave him credit for. I didn't give too much credence to how well I did yesterday because it was rank reset and I was going up against people who weren't the best and in the past to me it always seemed like even poor killers did well until after survivors adjusted to their weaknesses and then it was game over as far as them being viable. So I projected that he wouldn't be that good at the red ranks where I reside (and really the only ranks that the game should be balanced around IMO) since there were some glaring weaknesses that no doubt better skilled players would exploit when he goes live. 
---
As I've climbed the ranks last night and today, I'm still doing well and thus far his weaknesses haven't prevented me from 3k-ing. I would *like* to take that as a good sign that there is promise for a new viable killer I can add to the very short list of Nurse, Spirit, Billy, Hag, Myers, Huntress (who in that order are the best killers in the game to me), but I've been burned before and I don't trust BHVR.
---
I won't know for sure if this will prove true until he's released live and I go up against the best of the best survivors. So I'll stop saying what I think he is for the red ranks in the PTB since I don't know for sure with how infrequent the PTB matches and with rank reset going on. Instead i'll just judge it when it goes live in 4 days. 
---
I will say this though, if.. BIG if.. he proves to be viable in the red ranks then I would give kudos to BVHR for finally doing something right by a killer for the first time since the Spirit was buffed a few weeks after her initial release. That was six months ago so my confidence in them breaking that streak isn't more than an ant's hair.
---
But we shall see in 4 days. There is also still a chance that he'll be tweaked to be even worse in the live version if they listen to low skilled survivor mains who want any and every killer nerfed, and even if they kept him as is now he may still prove to ultimately not be good enough in the red ranks with his weaknesses of being taken out of stealth with hooked/downed survivors which I still maintain will be VERY detrimental to him with SFWs especially on the live version.
---
Time will tell.
---
Play on Xbox
---
this would make OoO way op
---
The server even on PS4 is pretty flaky right now.
---
The shards, you get by leveling up the player profile, but you cannot buy licensed killers, or survivors with it.
---
So Billy is cj?
---
That‚Äôs hilarious, nicely done.
---
Are we r/melee now?
---
B O Y P I L E
---
So just cosmetics?
---
If only I could get into a game, players are leaving left and right for me
---
Only his exposed time needs to change.
---
He‚Äôs not but he‚Äôs more acceptable then someone that can literally just look at you and kill you
---
Thanks (:
---
I definitely don't believe he shouldn't have it I just believe with certain add ons he currently has he can be absolutely annoying in chases and I definitely believe he can be countered. I just believe he should have decay when in a Chase so it doesn't just mean every single Ghostface will try to stalk you and 1 shot you. I  feel Ghostface in general is a very odd killer because alot of people is saying he is OP but also alot of people  are saying he is bad which to an extent he is OP and very bad also depending on map. if he talk about just the ability in general it is a little too strong in some aspects like getting it off during a Chase or not having it decay at all but he can also be countered just by being looped and looked at. I just feel a little iffy on Ghostface as I think he is Bad and Great at the same time but I'll wait until launch to fully understand what he truly is.
---
I am in pain. I suffer every day, with horrible console FPS. As I curse each time the frame rate drops, I gaze to my left and see a pretty good PC, runs anything at 60FPS. I know, if I could just switch over, my suffering would end. But then I remember I'd have to grind from the start. At this point I break down and cry myself to sleep knowing I will never know true happiness.
---
No how long he stalks need to, it takes Myers a good amount of time to get someone to exposed and he earns that one minute of exposed, where as Ghostface can literally look at you for 4 seconds and earn the same amount of exposed time as Myers? How is that balanced? Ghostface doesn‚Äôt earn that exposed status so why does he deserve to get it?
---
Separate map offerings into a separate bloodweb, and make it a seperate offering to the current offering slot so you can always use one.
---
I wonder what old lady will be, survivor or killer?
---
Yes
---
balanced landing ready too
---
I mean gameplay loop of half of them is M1 killer.
---
I wouldn't be seen dead wearing the Bond perk icon...
---
*DC*
---
Not everyone is on PC
---
Well it goes to 400% is the thing, because the bloodhunt doubles it after all the calculations are done.. so a 200% game becomes 400% so on and so forth.
---
Trapper looks more unnerving in this picture than in the actual game.
---
Survivor/killer
---
4 second?
---
I disagree kinda Because he may needs the stalk decay back but slower so he can't just stalk you in a Chase then instadown you or just keep your stalk high appear out of no where and instadown also. I just feel with some of the Add ons  he has allowing him to pull a instadown out of his ass in a Chase is kinda too strong but besides that I believe he is a little weak. these are all my options though and he can be completely different when he releases we just have to wait and see.
---
Also, keep in mind that unlike Ghostface, you pretty much have full freedom as to when you want to pop your Tier III and expose the survivor as Myers. Do it when they're in the open and close to you, so they don't even have the time to get to a window.
---
Just stopped by to say, LOVE IT.  Good job
---
i like playing this map more than the game on doctor because of how most of the pallets are shockable
---
**and the vaults,,,,,, aaauUgghhgGhhh** i nut
---
Iirc, it only doubles the base amount and each bloody streamers adds an additional 100 percent. That's what I read last double bp anyhow. Check it out next time you can, if you get 20k and your BP gain is 60k I'm correct, if it's 80k then you are.
---
Ok thanks
---
You've done it now...oink squad shall be blessing your comment section any minute now
---
Waste of time, quicker for everyone to just kill them
---
Because you're supposed to let killers kill you or else you hurt their feelings
---
"Laughs in nurse"
---
Survivors have to center him on their screen to count as 'spotting' him. There's now a .3 second buffer to start spotting him, and the full time to spot him is increased from 1 second to 1.5 seconds. These changes combined are to stop Survivors from being able to essentially just blindly 'spot' him by spinning their cameras around without any idea of where he is.
---
The indicator that ghost face sees on his screen as someone is spotting him now appears for the entire duration, not just when he's been fully spotted. And now when he is fully spotted, ghost face gets a 'killer instinct' indicator (the red glyph symbol like legion sees in frenzy) showing him where the survivor that spotted him is. This gives ghost face a chance to actually quickly move and hide before his power breaks, and gives him a stronger possibility of going after a survivor that spots him unexpectedly.
---
The global noise he made when entering stealth has been removed, and his red stain now vanishes in stealth even while standing (before was just crouching). and his crouch speed was bumped up slightly. And his ambient noises while in stealth have been reduced from 16m to 8m. This makes his stealth way more sneaky and unexpected.
---
Last but not least, progress he makes on stalking any individual survivor no longer decays while he's not stalking them. For example if he stalks a survivor half way and then is spotted and the survivor runs away, they will indefinitely be half stalked until either ghost face hits or downs them or he finishes stalking them. This gives ghost face a strong 'edging' capability similar to Myers getting 99% to tier 3.
---
All together, it's a powerful combination of buffs that cover almost every complaint that was initially voiced about him (aside from his perks being subpar)

---_I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically._

Yea, he's very weird for sure. We will see how people feel in a couple weeks :)
---
Killers have the right to use any means necessary to down a survivor. If you get 4k you are not shitty. Doesnt matter how you got it.
---
Camping and tunneling aren't toxic, its called trying to kill
---
They need to make it character related. I can grind bp with dr. and just prestige Billy. They should make difficult challenges for special cosmetics. Not legacy though. Those people earned them.
---
Dead by checkers
---
Great point, stranger things is more fortnite. I too love classic horror &lt;3
---
Mhm without being 'spotted' and broken from his power. At least survivors can break him out of his power, can't do that to Myers.
---
ive had higher 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
don't ask
---
They're dangerous but very clear. Expecting either side to not do either is expecting them to make the game needlessly harder for themselves.
---
He just got nerfed
---
The joke is the word play
---
I'm afraid, but I'm asking üòÇ
---
How i saied its only a idea
---
Clever ;)
---
Its really not that funny
---
It's all in how you decide to play her. If you'd like to meme, she's a meme for sure. If you wanna be competitive, learn her ambush really well and good perk compositions and you can definitely be a threat.
---
How do you as a killer prevent looping, im just curious because it is really annoying. I know there is that EnDuRiNg SpIrIt FuRy build but i dont have a build for that
---
Huntress for sure
---
Better than most other subs
---
I think they put her in a bad spot because she is both slower but also basically has a larger terror radius due to her hum so survivors can get a head start. I wish they'd rework her many debuffs.
---
Almost every time I've seen this brought up, everyone definitively says that you're wrong.  bloodhunts are just the equivalent of an extra party streamer
---
Last one could wear me like a sock puppet...
---
They just all paired so well together, and thank you
---
Thank you! I appreciate it
---
I‚Äôm glad it came out well :)
---
ik im just making it better cuz come on you tell me is the hag or docter hard to play?
---
I really have a hard time understanding how people think it‚Äôs better than pre nerf DS. You can run MoM and not have it activate for several games in a row. DS activated every single game that you were downed in. Not even comparable to me.
---
how so?
---
I laughed way to hard at in the DICK.
---
I thought about that but I very rarely, and I mean VERY rarely see people use these perks together, on  Ps4 anyways. SS doesn't really help when it is run by itself tho since it takes two dead survivors to completely protect you from a perk like BBQ&amp;C. You also get the token AFTER the person is dead which I don't like. Then again I can see why you think it's OP, maybe the numbers can be reduced to 6/8/10 meters perhaps?
---
So at tier three, after 4 hooks you are fully safe from BBQ&amp;C. Which I find fair (I play both survivor and killer equally btw).
---
Because we want fucking points too lol
---
Doctor is just free bp, thats why i main him, and i dont know shit about hag. So yeah
---
Typical killer main wants free kills handed to them. Zzz
---
I just loaded into a game on PS4, I had to load into my own game for a few minutes and then it cancelled it saying the lobby was cancelled, please load another. Any idea what that's about?
---
Zoinks
---
I feel like the in the dick was aimed at my unfunny high school sense of humor....
---
To be fair, killers bully me a lot and I get sabotaged by my own lag, so I'm often sitting in the low 10s. Red rank scares me and I'm sure its a totally different experience there, at least rank 10-15 tends to be a lot of people not too competitive or just having fun. I'm perfectly ok with not ranking past that.
---
I gotta say him going into tier 2 and getting that red stain right after you spotted him was poetic
---
I would say the trapper, bc I think he's the most original of the non licensed killers. Crotus Penn asylum or the farm for the map.
---
Back out BACK OUT!
---
Someone else said the same thing and I already said my peace on the matter
---
I wish they would change it to take skill because it gets really boring being looped for 30 seconds to a minute and then being looped around another pallet spot
---
TBH I wanna see more Huntress backstory and the survivors are gonna be David,Jake,Nea and Adam the map Anywhere in the red forest
---
Yeah I feel bad for you Australians. I watch an Aussie Streamer so I understand what it‚Äôs like.
---
Toxic assholes: Fucking report us PSN won't do shit you cunt I hope you die.
---
You: Okay.
---
PSN: *Bans toxic assholes.*
---
Toxic assholes: *Surprised Pikachu face.*
---
This doesn't work at all against good killers. They will always take the pallet hit. You mind game at the wrong time and you're probably gonna get downed.
---
Here is a full guide from OhTofu. https://youtu.be/05UwPu-MMSc
---
There isn't a quick fix, the game is that poorly optimized, and it gets worse per update.
---
Mad grit: is meh. 3/10 
---
Iron Maiden: help counter survivors who hide in  lockers to hide from bbq 7/10 
---
Discordance : is a fantastic tracking perk 9/10
---
9-15 is usually the chill zone.
---
Yeah its hell. :( I recently went to Japan and was so happy to see DbD as intended... 20ms lobbies. Come back home and my average is 750 lol...
---
Lol, 500 is the auric price, the shards value for the characters is 9000, it would take about, 270 games to get.
---
Welcome to the 21 century, where or you pay for unlocks, or grind your ass for it.
---
Good luck, you will need it, it's a fucking hell out there. This game by my standards is not that scummy on the monetization.
---
Wish all games were that wholesome. Also, happy cake day buddy!
---
Sometimes I'll do it as a "HEY FOLLOW ME" type thing if they're close to an injured survivor and I know they've seen me
---
The fix is coming its the new battlepass like other games. You can earn shit free and its meh, or you can pay to look good.
---
Ouch man. /hug
---
I don't blame you for waiting for reset. Chill zone is best zone.
---
Or?
---
Excuse me while I sit in the corner of the map with Claudette. I M M E R S E D
---
Omg that chibi doctor is so cute
---
When he charges his chainsaw he doesn't become as fast as a turtle. Very simple and straightforward
---
Who even says looping is toxic?
---
I dont mind a challenge every now and then. Hell, I don't even need to 4k. I just want to chill and play the game with other chill pple. Red ranks are just full of people who try wayyyy too hard. Which is fine, I understand some people are competetive. I just wish I can stay at rank 10 but not derank just to do so.
---
well if I play with you expect insidious bubba
---
It could be sprint burst, balanced landing, or even the dedicated muscle memory to turn corners tighter than you are as a killer.
---
I personally vote for vagina Jake.
---
Best cougar award goes to...
---
Repost
---
yes, he go fast.
---
Roblox in DBD, fortnight and cosmetics.
---
This is the best thing I‚Äôve seen on this sub no doubt
---
You‚Äôve forgot to put SWF Squadettes and their purple flashlight in there.
---
I mean tho u can just play another character and spec the blood points you get into the character until they‚Äôre playable.
---
Captain Cutler's ghost?
---
Myers
---
Who the fuck thought of exposed? It could‚Äôve been so many other things. Vulnerable. Depleted. Single hit.
---
As an extra tip, burn your Jigsaw pieces to get sent to The Game map. It makes it much easier to patrol generators.
---
&gt; If two survivors do it at each other, it's "Hello"
---
They may also want you to heal them, so make sure you pay attention to whether they're injured or healthy.
---
Quick question. Is that with the hair update?
---
Spirit and michael
---
If the killer is good enough they‚Äôll shake their screen back and forth really fast so you can‚Äôt blind them and they can still see and kill you
---
Deer head on trapper
---
this was from today but i dont believe console has that update yet so i dont believe so.
---
Same
---
Up to you. PC is less toxic btw and a keyboard and mouse can be nice.
---
Great personality lol
---
Third time‚Äôs the charm. What a wholesome Wraith.
---
Ohhhh. I didn't notice. I thought you were playing the PTB. Damn, I was thinking that the hair was moving pretty well with the hair update. D:
---
That looks fire bro
---
Right I so happy and thanks for watching
---
And then they say you're tunneling.
---
&gt; I really wish they'd add as soon you set foot into the exit and no one is hooked, you have 5 seconds to leave or the Entity snatches you.
---
Well, I play solo, and sometimes I'll stay inside the exit gate (hiding behind the pillars, NOT teabagging) and wait to make sure all my teammates get out. When you're playing with randoms, people don't always go to the same gate, so they might end up getting hooked *after* one gate is already open because they were trying to get the other gate and the Killer was over there with them. This would suck for people who actually wait for a reason besides teabagging.
---
You lose points for camping lol
---
This happened to me too. I think mine was triggered by a mori. I haven‚Äôt played much this week so I probably won‚Äôt be able to help
---
You just have to put them in deep wounds then down them the normal way, it‚Äôs different now but still works
---
Thx i fucking love it
---
Stalk
---
No but it's not like Deja Vu even directly does anything to help prevent 3 gen strats
---
You can also gain the achievement on any killer if someone is using borrowed time.
---
Ok thank you so much. I just kept hitting over and over again the last player. Damn he must felt bad about me prolonging the game.
---
All the Time or before chase. Well I can figure that out
---
Yeah, this big brain time
---
I dont really use moris but have a ton so sometimes i'll bring one just to mess with the survivors and never use it. Gotta keep em guessing ;)
---
Yea they now only activate if there are still generators to be repaired. So if the exit gates are powered the RBT won‚Äôt activate.
---
I'd love a show set in the entity's realm, showing off survivors between trials and having to repeatedly die
---
Have some sort of shenanigans where they think they can beat the system
---
I'd be happy with any sort of show though, killer backstories would be amazing too
---
You can 99 and pop near then, also 99 injured survivors, if he heal you just pop on him.
---
Damn, alright thanks though
---
Why is BlackMetal Jeff here..
---
Other side of the coin:
---
Camping is not toxic, it's called trying to murder someone.
---
Play where you have friends. Sure PC has better frame rates. Personally i won't switch from PS4 because i have so many maxed out P3 survivors and killers that would be 2000 hours of work wasted
---
Can u dm me his twitch name I‚Äôm intrigued
---
Hell yea. Was p1 lvl 30 on console and switched from ps4 to PC not too long ago (am around lvl 50 rn) and I don't regret it at all. Leveling up all of my characters wasn't too bad honestly, it feels pretty refreshing not having meta perks for once. The only thing that saddened me was that I had to buy all of the cosmetics all over again but if it supports bhvr then it's not too bad.
---
Oh mY gOd ThEsE sUrViVoRs ArE sO sTuPiD, bEcAuSe AlL tHeY dO iS tEaBaG, fLaShLiGhT sPaM, dC, gEn RuSh AnD dRoP pAlLeTs
---
[This fucking retard just admitted to lag switching players just trying to have fun.](https://youtu.be/5RyOZ9HcnJ4)
---
Haha you have to stalk my profile for insults, you are so pathetic.
---
So should I just wait until they fix it
---
Is it because of the transition to k/m or cause you can't play in general? Cause for survivor side I use controller and for killer I use k/m.
---
Then it will be paradise, being a survivor there is almost no difference between using keyboard and mouse or joystick, but being a killer it is much easier to have total control of you character by using keyboard and mouse
---
She vomits in you and can put you into broken. 
---
To counter her don‚Äôt cleanse, cleansing gives you healed but her a better power.
---
Her vomit turns red and it damages people it‚Äôs pretty easy to hit people with the red vomit so don‚Äôt cleanse. I vomited over a loop once and got someone.
---
Step 1. Don‚Äôt cleanse learn to play the game injured 
---
Step2. Repeat Step 1.
---
I always make time to play a few games everyday
---
Dont get hit by her vomit.
---
What happens is when you get hit your infection meter goes up and you need to cure yourself quickly.
---
When full you'll get the broken status effect until you cure yourself at a fountain.
---
However if you cure yourself Plauge will get to use the fountains to get corruption purge allowing her to damage you with her vomit attack like how huntress's axes. damage you.
---
Here‚Äôs hoping he entity takes me too
---
No. I've played on PS4 to Xbox One and now to PC.
---
Haven‚Äôt been moried yet, so I‚Äôm not sure about that one. It‚Äôs been going on for quite a while, like months wise it seems to me.
---
Thank
---
Lol
---
I always expect to see NOED on Bubba now, it's super common. Tbf his chainsaw is basically the opposite of an instadown given how worthless it is at actually hitting survivors.
---
As a general tip, perks cant focus on one particular killer. Only add ons can do that. So perk one is cool, but would be better suited for an add on set than a perk.
---
Everything else is cool and humorous though
---
You only need Ruin on Billy and Nurse if you‚Äôre still learning them. After that, it‚Äôs just overkill.
---
I think the Nurse and Doctors would have been a scary, original killers.
---
Maybe have David, Jake, Kate, and Feng as the main survivors.
---
Lmao
---
( cries in facecamp )
---
You are a better player then us all then, we all play, but dear god, we don't keep coming back for punishment.
---
Except it shows exactly which three gens are closest together (IIRC), incentivizing the user to complete one of them, thereby preventing a three gen strat.
---
Nintendo switch version might have to wait twice as long üòÇ
---
It takes 1,5 sec to break him, 99 will take 0.1 to activate
---
It SHOULD be:
---
Dead Hard: the sting of finals and large due dates coming up forces you to push extra hard and sprint through the last of the work; pulling all nighters, downing energy drinks. 
---
This Isn‚Äôt Happening: a looming sense of dread pours over you as both your final assignments are due, and creeping existential dread set in, reminding you that you‚Äôre about to graduate and you don‚Äôt know what the fuck you‚Äôre doing.
---
Left Behind: you proceed, defeated as you watch others complete their exams and graduate; but your university screwed you over and didn‚Äôt offer the course you needed to graduate, so you await another semester. 
---
Wake Up!: because did we mention that the course was 8 AM Calc III?
---
Yeah I noticed too XD
---
Did you know?
---
Killers need to be faster than survivors to counter pallets and windows!
---
110 killers struggle in loops hard
---
Usually one of those gets repaired early anyways. One person alone can't prevent a 3 gen strat
---
If it was a passing glance he'd be weak like he was when the PTB started. The dev's just can't win with you people.
---
yeah bubba needs noed
---
Or just remove bs addons/offerings
---
I had a game like that earlier where a group just basically harassed me on PS4 because near the end my internet wasn‚Äôt that great and I couldn‚Äôt control it but I still killed 2 people.
---
The game looked so good back then.. I miss it
---
It was so creepy and dark ughhhhuhhhhhh so gooooodddd
---
Don't let it get to you. The thought of another strong killer ruffles the collective jimmies of the survivor kids. Once the ritalin kicks in they'll stop screeching.
---
Usually the Killer mains who hate entitled Killers have some experience as a Survivor, which is how the divergence started.
---
Honestly I think it‚Äôs a neat concept with neat powers and perks but if it wasn‚Äôt the entity. The entity is forcing people to kill for it and that would just take away so much about the entity for me. Maybe name it entity‚Äôs favorite or something Idk.
---
Don‚Äôt be an asshole, he‚Äôs not a bad killer but at this point his ability‚Äôs are broken. His exposed timer needs to be decreased and his time to stalk increased that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying
---
Insta down killers don‚Äôt and idk if you know this but Ghostface is one of those killers
---
I don't think saying a couple hundred of hours to unlock all teachables isn't so bad is objectively wrong or projecting my opinion. (not to mention the fact that I noted it was my opinion a few times and called it an unpopular one at that.)
---
Getting every perk on a char just a grind, no doubt, but i think is a nice to have more than a requirement to be competitive.
---
Not yet. 
---
It gets fixed on the 18th when GF's Chapter goes live, so use all of the ones you have.
---
Against object of obsession position yourself where you can stalk him without him breaking you, loop him but deactivate your power to get back the terror radius so he can't see you, and mindgame him .
---
I remember a concept of a killer called The Shard. It was similar to this. No idea why I remember it. It was like 10 months ago. I like the idea.
---
Yeah but if you hold onto that 99 a survivor might be able to break you before you get right up close for a one shot like you would for Myers.
---
I‚Äôve done that too with her in the map lmfao. Same outcome. They get themselves in that situation and rage because of it.
---
I know this post is a little old but I've been experiencing the same thing. I have noticed for awhile that I don't see any sparks after I kick a gen and I don't get the damage generator points. 
---
It's irritating reading the responses you've gotten as if you don't know how to damage a generator. You literally just have to hold a button for a few seconds lol. 
---
I thought this was just a visual bug but I started a game as Pig using surveillance and the gens I kicked stayed red. None of them ever turned white. So I know that none of my killers are currently able to damage gens. 
---
I tried deleting the game and reinstalling but that didn't fix it. I also played under my brothers account on the same console and cound'nt damage gens. I submitted a support ticket but haven't heard back yet. I'm on ps4. I've tried searching to see if anybody else has experienced this and I saw post on the dbd forum but nobody ever responded to him.
---
You need better perks.
---
Use Alert or Spine Chill for detection perk instead of Dark Sense. 
---
Get yourself one of the exhaustion perks like Dead Hard or Balanced Landing, it'll help you to put some distance between you and the killer.
---
Take out Calm Spirit and get yourself either end game perk like Adrenaline or hiding perks like Urban Evasion or Quick and Quiet. You don't want to be in a chase forever. You want to lose the killer and you can only do this if you stop running at some point during the chase.
---
With the right detection perk, you can find out if a killer is close or far away before opening a gate.
---
If someone else already open the gate, it may not be a good idea to waste time opening another one when you can sneak out via the opened door.
---
Duration or bust. If you're running spirit fury take iridescent button for easy pallet breaks.
---
All of the other add-ons are noob traps. The rework changes made them pointless.
---
Entity's spawn might work but it needs to be something with entity like powers
---
Myers being in tier 3 alone gives him massive map pressure. Exposed is always an intimidating status effect so survivors will be more cautious and move more slowly as to not be seen. Tier 3 lasts at least 60 second which can feel like forever, and unlike haunted grounds there's no bar to watch slowly deplete. You don't know if he will have infinite tier 3 or normal tier 3, etc. Against Ghost Face he will likely have only 1 person exposed. And he's chasing them. Zero pressure on anyone else... yeah he can drop the chase and go for someone else but what's the point? The moment the first guy sees the second survivor is exposed they'll just go back to a gen = no map pressure from Ghost Face.
---
Long story short, Myers has map pressure in tier 1 and 3. You either don't know where he is or he has an increased lunge range with instant downing potential. He's a threat through and through. Ghost Face has to meticulously approach survivors carefully and try to expose them which might not even work. If he does pull it off, it still provides zero map pressure. His only real advantage then becomes no red stain in a chase which is good for mind games. That is, until their camera is on you long enough end ends even that. Then you're just an M1 killer. Don't get me started on the creative playstyles Myers has with his addons. Ghost Face's addons do nothing to spice up his gameplay in meaningful ways.
---
Fam I have around 200 hours over 3 months because of my part time job and studies, plus my health is a bit fcked.
---
I just wanna play the game to have fun with decent perks but I only have the time to play on weekends
---
I legit only have huntress and doctor as 40 and Bubba to 35 and all my surviors are poo except feng is leveled up.
---
The grind is a big yikes for me
---
Then Deja Vu will show the next three closest gens, repeating the process. And nobody said anything about one person preventing a three gen strat, either.
---
That would be cool, with a swamp map.
---
Got her she's for free now
---
Thanks idk about the shard though ive never heard of it lol
---
Found the new player
---
They can, especially when you‚Äôre a slow boi.
---
Don‚Äôt know if you noticed, but it‚Äôs real easy to loop a Huntress without her hatchets, or a hag with no traps.
---
Insta down doesn‚Äôt do anything if you can‚Äôt hit them.
---
Bond is funny tho like you can be doing a gen and you see 2 people on another gen and then immediately spread out like ‚Äúyup. There‚Äôs he is‚Äù
---
&gt; you see 2 people 
---
In Soviet Russia, people see 2 **you**!
---
^(this post was made by a highly intelligent bot using the advanced yakov-smirnoff algorithm... okay, thats not a real algorithm. learn more on my profile.)
---
it makes me anxiety
---
Same here on the spectating bit. I‚Äôve put in two tickets to customer support. First one they responded saying they are working a fix then after the patch it was still happening so I put in another ticket, but haven‚Äôt heard back on that one.
---
he went in and missed his DS, what a legend
---
Ikr. Jake should just stick to hook sabo
---
Isai boys
---
it wouldn't have worked if there wasnt someone else there to take the aggro
---
I remember in one of my classes a friend and I had gotten stuck on a math problem. So we emailed the professor asking for help...she emailed back saying "have you tried solving the problem?" -_-
---
He didn‚Äôt DC though
---
Because people who are toxic usually always run them
---
Yeah I‚Äôm stupid. I thought you could just get them whenever lol.
---
The progress of the stalk only reset if you hit him, sometimes is worth wait the cooldown and insta him, than hitting him like a M1 Killer.
---
Borrowed time over dark sense, it's just SO mixh better than it
---
Duration addons make it really powerful for mobility and pressure.
---
I disagree.
---
Camping isn't toxic it's trying to kill you
---
. .
---
4 seconds after the hook?
---
I'm starting to detect BS.
---
My only defense besides pallets is mindgames, bloodlust takes those away. 
---
You are very much still 50/50. If you where to let's says make gens last longer, then although games with organized survivors would be more balanced, games without them would be much worse. There needs to be a way to bring this gap closer, such as a way to stop gen rushing without hurting less organized teams.
---
I hate double bloodpoints because I always get a bunch of fucking asshole killers bringing in ebony Moris and camping and tunneling me when my whole team brought bps. Fucking obnoxious bullshit
---
Thank you. Yeah everything else looks like shit to be honest
---
Do they stack?
---
If only lol. Its abit of a grind. I suggest going for Nea's balanced landing or Feng's Lithe over sprint burst. But thats your call.
---
use ivory with dying light to make the daily more fun
---
Jesus dude I played the most toxic fucking Squadettes the other day as Freddy. All 3 (to be fair one was a Nea) had flashlights.
---
They tasted the pain of my NOED when they wouldn't fucking leave and kept trying to heal the most toxic one. I hooked her first and Blood Warden did the rest. Two D/Cs and one sacrifice. The decent Jake lived. 
---
Fuck man what complete assholes.
---
So glad I'm seeing that sub more mentioned more often, got real tired of the "hurr durr you said you like penis so you can't like vajayjay r/SuDdEnLyGaY" comments
---
I believe so
---
Ok then you tell how is he better.
---
Balanced landing IS a lifesaver. But at least now I have WGLF teachable.
---
Easy af.
---
on ps4 at least, if I miss something on the bloodweb and it doesn't go how I like, I close the game and restart, goes back the start of the level and I can try again
---
The fucking wraith is cracking me up lmao
---
Sweet. Keep at it.
---
r/holup
---
As the other guy said, they are teachables, every survivor has their own. Every killer has their own. You can unlock them from the Shrine Of Secrets in the store in game, with Shards you get from leveling up your profile. It resets every 7 days from tuesday (I think)... this weekend is actually a good time to try to unlock them for whatever survivors/killers you have, double bloodpoints!!!! Once the teachables are unlocked (you can check by looking at the character that owns that teachable in their information profile, it has check marks next to the ones you have unlocked) they should eventually show up in every other survivors bloodweb!
---
Why Bubba though? He‚Äôs the worst Killer in the game.
---
That too, but I'm saying that every other weapon for the Spirit is a sword of some sort and I just feel like a bat isn't in the right theme. And isn't the sword she uses the one she was killed with? It wouldn't make sense for her to use a bat especially considering her mori. I'm the mori, she impales the victim and you can hear slicing noises.
---
Even though they nerfed it, manna grass braid and oak haft are a really good common addon combo that will help relieve some of the punishment for missing axe throws and will go a long way to helping you practice leading your targets. Tracking perks like the nurse's "nurse's calling" also help a lot in being able to keep pressure on your target and possibly surprise them with a hatchet to the face.
---
Thank you!
---
If a game needs grind to be interesting then... Come on
---
This grind turns a lot of new players off and it's also gets boring after a while
---
I like the idea for a different, new killer. Maybe with a harpoon gun that can reel survivors in. Regardless the art is well done.
---
I was literally just playing double blood points on xbox...
---
I personally don't think she is weak though I understand why a lot of people see her as week. The bear traps only slow the game down and they are a very limited supply. Also they only activate after a gen is started so most more experienced players will just go around raising gens but not popping them till no one has one on. 
---
She also doesn't really have much late game pressure. Part of introducing the End Game Collapse was removing the ability of her traps to trigger if you left the trial. I agree that BHVR had to do it but that also made people think she was weaker. 
---
Again I don't think she is weak though I think her power is easily countered the higher in the ranks you go. 
---
I think she could use some quality of life improvements. For example create a worktable that would allow the pig to collect her traps after she expended them and go to it to repair them and refill her traps. That or maybe allow her to once per game start the timer on all traps on survivors.
---
Correct.
---
Come on, that's not how most people genuinely feel. As a killer main, the typical frustration that I experience, and it is the same one that I think many others feel, is caused by how quickly the game can run away from you without you being able to do anything about it. 
---
Take this as a typical example: You're playing leatherface. You go for a patrol on the far side of the map where most people start off. You find a generator half finished, and catch someone running away. You begin a chase, you manage to land a blow after a few loops. At this point, you can choose to continue pursuit in hopes of a hook, or you can return to the generator to check to see if anyone has returned. Now, regardless of which choice you make here, whether you pursue or go back, 2-3 generators will not be either finished or extremely close to finished. It's incredibly demoralizing to have no one hooked, and have 2 generators remaining while doing nothing "wrong". You start off on your back foot and remain that way until you cull the herd and start ACTUALLY being able to "hunt"
---
Myers is incredibly fun. The guy who said definitely him is absolutely right. Pig just isn't my favorite. 
---
I'm def a big fan of Fred, too. The rework is coming!
---
You can quit whenever you want though lol and yes that is a part of the game..you literally grind for bloodpoints to invest in each individual character whether it‚Äôs killer or survivor. If we want to upgrade you can still play as any survivor or killer to accumulate points. So why complain if it‚Äôs the same recipe that shouldn‚Äôt be changed. Grind and upgrade or don‚Äôt play.
---
Sucking up a hit with MoM and then icing on the cake stab them after they gunnel further. Gives other survivors SO MUCH TIME.
---
I farmed as killer for a good 2 hours
---
So do your two eyeballs
---
She's good though.   She isn't S tier, but that is purely due to her not having hard map mobility which is a requirement for S tier killers.  Her power changes what loops are and are not safe vs her compared to many other killers.  She is the ONLY killer who can apply dying state damage pressure completely across the map.   Nothing like finding out the Huntress has BBQ than eating a hatchet from cross map after she hooks someone.
---
She is one of the few killers who is fully functional addonless.
---
Are you secretly a trump loving boomer? If not don't worry at least there is one community out there that you will fit in to.
---
I mean when are you going to find more then one survivor working on a gen? That what makes his power useless.
---
Also, just throwing the hatchet AT the window you know they are going for can be enough to get you a hit.  Because they either dodge the hatchet, and give you the time to catch up to M1 them, or don't, and eat the hatchet hit.
---
That's only 3.6 hours a day...
---
Have you even tried it yet. It could save you from chases and posible hits. It has saved my ass a lot and even rank 1 people use it and it work out for them.
---
Learning how to path your runs and make larger loops from multiple smaller loops? Neither is a bad strat tho
---
What does u/SpunkMasterPepe think of this?
---
I just finished slasher. Honestly really liked it and thought about those killers being in dbd and how cool that could be.
---
This happened to me recently too. I started running medium instead of ultra Idk what's going on
---
*chuckles* i'm in danger
---
Because they aren't actually worried about the bloodpoint economy, they just want a longer grind for inflated retention stats. Considering shards could help you get some cosmetics that an impulse buyer might get auric cells for I don't see them going for that either, sadly.
---
&gt; you get some cosmetics 
---
In Soviet Russia, some cosmetics get **you**!
---
it does allow you to play in ultrawide but instead of increasing your FOV horizontally to fill the extra screen space, it reduces your FOV vertically to the point where it's pretty much unplayable.
---
WAGA SHUCHUU NI ARI
---
Like.  I forgot. Matches don‚Äôt light underwater!!
---
That part of the old show has stuck with me since I was 3.
---
wraith is faster with the right addons
---
what does bhvr mean
---
I feel like that‚Äôs the definition of an OP killer.   One that literally brings you to them.
---
no neck wraith
---
Have you seen any of saminations DBD parodys
---
If so then you would know that Nea is the entity
---
Me and the boys part 2
---
Sucks that people downvoted you, they probably thought you meant he sucked at the game.
---
The name a reference to the black cat comic?
---
Ps4. Have had 2 games in past 2 days where I started with Killer. The first one hit me right as I was allowed to move. Was in Legion level and wraith's level.
---
Oh my god that phrsse below
---
Ok...fuck you too pal.
---
Next time
---
Nice. Would‚Äôve been spicy if she was Rancor, but the disconnect is satisfying too.
---
Staring at you all stiff, you say üëÄ
---
i would die for this cat
---
He never once said that
---
Ive Actually Been Working On Getting BBQ Teachable On My Leatherfaces Bloodweb So That Should Up My Killer Game Real Soon.
---
Billy!
---
Yeah i know. I just want to know about Michael right now.
---
But muh NOED
---
I wonder if it's the same guy who messaged me a couple weeks ago saying Hillbilly takes "zero" skill.
---
&gt;I know this is two days old but I just watched True play a game where he was stalking a Claudette and both were in the open, soon as he got the warning sound, he crouched and was just in some grass. He couldn't see her anymore and the warning music stopped. Then he uncrouched and the spotting warning immediately started, etc.   
---
&gt;Admittedly this was from a somewhat decent distance and may not work up close but it seems grass \*can\* stop the stalking?
---
Killer is much harder to do well as. Neither side is op, even if one side is better
---
I feel you man, i feel you
---
I heard that you also have to get a merciless victory, so it is actually really hars to do.
---
Less toxic is debatable - PC is the only one with post-game chat which enables easy toxicity.
---
Why I love play monitor and abuse Myers
---
The mentality that meta perks are salty or toxic needs to stop. It‚Äôs okay to point out that a perk is broken (like current state MoM), but people playing effectively are not toxic for doing that
---
As far as I know, you don't have to hit 32k BP. Just get a double pip and 4K.
---
No
---
Wtf is this post?
---
Some killers are straight up cunts and only care about earning blood points for themselves ... only had a few lobbies with a decent harvest
---
I've had this problem since the plauge patch too, what fixed it for me was using a vpn. I haven't disconnected since I've been using it. Hope that helps c:
---
Plz increase bloodpoint capacity. Im sick of getting to 1 mil and being forced to burn it on characters I don't use just to be able to collect more BP
---
I think they are referring to matches cancelled, which somehow still manages to consume 50% of offerings.
---
I‚Äôve recently got my leatherface up to level 40 in expectation of the DBP,   How do I get all 4 stacks of BBQ and still manage to farm without all the survs being scared and hiding for the rest of the game?   I usually just wait for the last Gen and circle around the 3 remaining in hopes to get someone.  But with DBP I‚Äôm also running distressing and thrill of the hunt. I spend pretty much all my time trying to get people away from thrill.  They should realise that that‚Äôs the only Hex and I‚Äôm only using it for the added 10% of bloodpoints.   Even if that‚Äôs he last totem on the map. That totem is mine and you‚Äôre not having it üòÇ
---
The red stain was on her when she vaulted, Killer didn't throw any hatchets, and everyone escaped. Definitely a farner
---
You have to be 32 meters away from the hook for MYC to proc.
---
There‚Äôs a bug?
---
I just finished survivors.  And finished leatherface for that BBQ    Now it‚Äôs time to go down the list of killers before I prestige more of my survs.
---
Thats exactly how it.works. if you havent seen it yet, that's on you. Fuck off
---
Yes but once you play the game long enough you already have all the perks.  So it becomes.  What do you want.  The bloodpoints. Or the cosmetics?   People would rather the cosmetics rather than having to put actual money into the game.
---
Smartasses get downvoted. We always see to that.
---
Trying to keep everyone off of gens is a bit more important. But if they have 5 left fuck it lol
---
Yes, Sealed Envelopes aren't just a personal bloodpoint modifier and instead grant every Survivor in the game a 25% boost to bloodpoints earned.
---
Thanks
---
Trapper, hag, nurse
---
NOED
---
What's your rank
---
Ahhh right I thought the progress went away if a survivor spots you for that 1.5 duration thing
---
Accept for Hag. Mint Rag+MYC makes NOED look like De'ja Vu
---
[deleted]
---
19
---
The point in struggling is to stop the killer from being able to hook you in more advantageous spots. I don't think a perk like this is a good idea because it's really hard to balance it between being too weak and almost never getting wiggle offs, or being too consistent and strong.
---
He‚Äôs saying that when someone gets unhooked he runs back to the hook and then the exposed guy usually runs at him in order to take a hit for the unhooked guy. Their grammar is a mess, but that‚Äôs what they were trying to convey.
---
Being a killer main isn‚Äôt easy (especially on console), but I get through it :) I love this game and I always want to support it
---
"Pathetic" but he leaves out the part where he is 99.9% dependent on SWF to break 10k BP.
---
Salty survivor alert!!!
---
Plague is going to be your hardest by far.
---
I think it‚Äôs on the 18th
---
Oh ok I mean killer is amazing at that rank but it's honostley probably just me being bad
---
Hhhhhhhhhhh all I said was it‚Äôd be cool
---
just give us 2 random perks for every 3 games played, to a character of our choosing
---
Clearly not enough. Ever heard of r/woooosh
---
I've been doing both at once, rn doing laurie and wraith, wraith is the last killer until ghost face and Quentin is the last survivor I have left, then I prestige my zappy boi.
---
Lol.
---
Do a short video clip of "farming", report the killer to bhvr. Who can tell the difference ?
---
Some people are Ducks, I wont risk it personally. Already happened to me.
---
But thanks for the downvotes I guess.
---
As it stands I feel as though killers aren't interested in putting a survivor on the most strategic hook but which ever one seems the closest and most reasonable during the match. I do agree that it would be hard to balance the perk but I believe that if BHVR puts attention to this they can find a balance
---
I haven't played since Spirit because my heart could not handle it. Not like "Oh, I am getting to excited or angry",  I literally had my heart racing through some of the chases because I would get so close to catching them and suddenly I hear "BANG THUD" from a pallet and panic.
---
When I first used Boil Over I thought this is what it would do
---
It's 115% speed and 32m TR now, it was a 110% before, forcing him to use a power that has no counterplay. Nerfed? No, just reworked to be a fun player instead of an annoying version of Doctor and Plague
---
Wait, this isn't Google!
---
Silly qBitZzZ
---
What is it in people trying to tell me their rank? I do not care. Rank meand absolutely *nothing* in this game.
---
And yes, i used it when i was a noob 2 years ago. Then i grew up and realized it was a waste of a perk slot because there are much better things to run
---
And I replied to someone who said it was being made by BHVR...
---
Just ignore this sub. Its a bunch of toxic 300 hour monkeys who think they knoe what's best for the game
---
Uninstall
---
Understood
---
Lockers have hidden auras for a while. They were somewhat recently changed to also impose blindness on survivors in lockers
---
Depends. The occasional t-bag is fine. Those people who t-bag after EVERY pallet? RIP AND TEAR. UTIL IT IS DONE.
---
Hey Kevin happy cake day üç∞!
---
Yeah lockers hide auras except for certain cases like Freddy‚Äôs dream world and Legion‚Äôs dash attack. 
---
Another good trick is to put a genny between you and the killer so he can‚Äôt see thru the genny auraüëç
---
I‚Äôm talking about this event ... if someone offers bloody party streamers why would you be selfish and earn bloodpoints for yourself if someone else has given up their offering just for you to insta 4K them
---
Eh it's kinda ass but at least lockers actually do something now
---
Damn why so freaking hostile üòß
---
Age- \*\*\*T E E N\*\*\*
---
Oh damn I didnt even know it was my cakeday it could've flown over my head üòÇ
---
well as a killer main, whenever i bring bps and survivors dc i dont get that many bp's cause of it, so this is just a problem with the dc's atm
---
Me and my friend and a random brought bps. You know what I got? A tunnelling legion that used his ivory on me I'm so mad.
---
amazing! congrats!
---
Looping is a "valid strategy" same as tunneling and camping.
---
So you could agree with all of them or neither of them. Otherwise you are a toxic hypocrite yourself.

That one though? Yeah, he had an ebony.
---
*Laughs in Nurse*
---
It's just the reddit community. That's how it always is, especially for Video Game. The sweaty losers here who are die hards of a game find carbon copies of themselves on here (like I said, this is on every video game sub) and band together to shit on the minority. 
---
Even though I've only played killer 20 or so games, its pretty easy to realize how overpowered the killers are. Some are truly shitty like the Doctor, while others you just need to pass first grade to learn to kill all 4 survivors within 6-8 minutes.
---
D was just meant to mean debt but that works
---
Yes sir!!!! Definitely salty and I wasn't even the killer
---
Seeing as hatch standoffs were the bane of dbd i like this better. I also run wake up so i dont run into these issues.
---
I want wildlife in the game.  Will confuse survivors thinking it could Amanda or wraith in the grass.  And can confuse killers thinking it‚Äôs a Blendadette in the grass.
---
I still have not personally experienced that new mechanic yet, but what if you ran to him and let him hit you assuming no NOED? Wouldn‚Äôt timer slow or stop?
---
Do a gen or 2, unhook/heal a couple teammates and get chased for a little while. Ez pips
---
Yall some handsome chaps
---
I honestly don't know why that other guy said uninstall. Do not listen to his complete nonsense. Ghostface (with his new buffs/changes) is extremely powerful now without any addons necessary, but a good perk for stalking would be corrupt intervention because it gives you time to find and stalk survivors before they get gens done :)
---
Okay thanks I‚Äôm going level up my other survivors. I‚Äôll make sure to post with some better perks
---
Looks sweet but if I ran it I‚Äôd die hella quick I‚Äôm nothing without my Dead Hard lmao
---
i've asked before or after Clown.
---
Great question, the timer never stops. However it does slow only if a survivor is in the dying state or hooked.
---
The timer at the top will change to grey indicating it has slowed, however I was already injured and ran the killer for a majority of the timer before this clip took place... just my luck!ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Then before clown.

I see the most random shit get downvoted on this sub. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be an opinion. Someone asked a question, got an answer, and said ‚Äúthanks‚Äù and that was downvoted. So.. don‚Äôt take it personally.

Heathers reference?
---
Yea I'll use ruin and bbq only because if not survivors will rush gens but I'm not going full on try hard but then I never do I want to get as much BP as possible but I dont want survivors to not get any. Went up against a basement trapper in the farm variant map with the barn he proxied the barn and said sorry about the build I just got bored but he could've afforded to leave the barn and find people we got less then 5k BP each not fun at all
---
your comments speak otherwise.
---
Well yeah, killers get three free hook events with a DC. When this happens, you have to start thinking like a sole survivor.
---
*hugs* *nuzzles you* OwO What's this? ///O-O///
---
Were there any upright pallets there?
---
What the fuck is that thumbnail. I don't even want to watch it after looking at that shit
---
Everyone's saying Shugoki but I'm over here thinking Hitokiri.
---
Don‚Äôt ask for exclusives. Why would you want them to make content and let only 20% of their playerbase have fun with it?
---
Thank you :) there's some amazing ones, have you seen the creepy wraith one? By u/TheWidowerSwordsman
---
it'd also incentivize opening chests and loot builds.
---
you just said July. Spirit came out in autumn!
---
I've got a quick story in this regard.  
---
Had a guy who palleted me all the time, teabags on every single one. Goes to do it a 3rd time, you know, for his youtube salt montage video. Just a shame I run Spirit Fury. Not even his teammates came to save him, they thanked me for putting the egomaniac fuckstain on notice. I opened the gate and let the rest of em out.
---
Hit them with the nod when you down them, give them a smack on the hook. Maybe tunnel if they really deserve it.
---
BaBY KiLLAh OnlY WAnT EZ 4K huuur duur
---
As survivor I've stopped farming with killers. They tend to use it to lure survivors out and get them all on death hooks before getting his 4k... That toxicity breeds contempt among the community...
---
So when an RPG gets a big dlc I should get more xp for doing the same things as before? I‚Äôm a little confused by the reasoning can someone explain.
---
Accidentally clicked the wrong button and sent before I finished the title
---
Also my friend is the one who made the clip for clarification she flipped it for me since I was just in awe and the mad laddery that just occurred
---
I remember know, it was still red when spirit came out but i began red laye july early August just before dbd came out for free with ps plus. IT WAS AFTER CLOWN.  I was in purple then though.
---
yes, exactly. you got to red ranks when emblem system was changed to make it much easier to rank up.
---
He is a lower tier myers and michael is one of the most balanced. Myers can stalk one person and has the ability to down multiple survs. GF can only stalk one person at a time. He is for sure good where he is at.
---
By just playing the game, ignoring all possible ways to troll me. And winning or losing, i always stay friendly despite they throw at me, even if i am frustrated or annoyed. 
---
And if i'm fed up with the toxicity, i stop playing and go play something else.
---
Let the toxic flow through you.  Play a bunch of doctor.  Run ruin and green electrode.  Don't let ruin get broken.  If possible shock them all to tier 2 madness, then face a wall and spam shock your totem while you watch Netflix.  Dont chase them,  dont hit them, just ignore them.
---
Cant see them tbag.  Not going to chase them on loops.  All their meta perks are useless.  Have fun m1'ing for your 9k blood points survivors.
---
Spine chill would‚Äôve gotten you out of there. It‚Äôs a straight up upgrade of premonition; it does everything premonition does but better.
---
Best advice : be lucky with maps or use map offering.
---
Huntress relies tremendously on map design
---
There's so many good skins in this contest and this is no exception.
---
Yep. Also literally removes the sound effects from it so you can yeet into a locker at point blank to make the killer extra shook, or get some head on plays.
---
holy hell that's creepy, people on here are way talented
---
Getting camped because you looped the killer feels better than escaping to me. I looped a Spirit through her entire haunted grounds and lost her. She downed and hooked me later in the match and just stood in front of the hook shaking her head. It felt great üòä
---
just dont miss 4Head
---
thanks.  that was my whole reason i would buy it on steam.  ill stick to console for now.  saved me a couple of bucks.
---
Have you tried the tutorials? I believe the killer one shows you how to lunge.  
---
The tutorials are very lacking in information about the game, however.
---
This clip was a couple days ago and after some non-stop grinding I'm now rank 11 and if I tried that shit where I am now I would instantly get downed in a moment
---
Awesome stickwork bro. Nice evasive maneuvers :) Happy you got to live after getting the Kobe!
---
I played a few matches tonight with Deliverance on and I really like it. As long as you don't get hosed right away by being the first to bump into the killer, a pocketed Kobe comes in super handy. Used it a couple times in endgame. One poor Wraith who wasn't that good had to go through the Kobe, miss a swing in the gate, think he had me when I let him hit me, get DS'd and watch me leave. I almost felt bad for the guy.
---
Just a thought, should you decide to purchase Adam in the future or find Deliverance in the Shrine. Lots of fun!
---
Happened to me, I verified my game files through steam and it fixed the issue. Don‚Äôt know if that information is helpful or works for you, though. 
---
Good luck.
---
Bloodhunts are the worst. I get the sweatiest killers and the most tunnelers.
---
I'm a survivor main and I think they were being whiny entitled little punks. It was all "You can't expect one person to cleanse 5 TOTEMS on their own!!!!1!"
---
I even told them they can just circle back around to dull totems during endgame but they didn't like that.
---
I don't get it. Shit's not that bad.
---
Devour hope is great for the speed boost and one shots imo.
---
Reminds me of the Scooby Doo movie
---
Only if you went for the injured person each time. It secures kills but ruins the game for the one being tunneled...
---
If you didnt tunnel and went for the idiot setting off the traps then good for you and keep up the entitys work!
---
KATE NEEDS BABY'S OUTFIT FROM DEVIL'S REJECTS!!!!! PLZ! AND JEFF MUST BE OTIS!!! PLEASE OMG OMG OMG THE THOUGHT OF IT TOTALLY AROUSES ME I'M HOLDING SHIFT IT'S NOT CAPS
---
send me ur steam profile. hope u do
---
The issue with your previous post seems to be that you made many unfounded assertions and your suggestions for killer balance was ridiculous. For instance you referred to the Hag as one of the fastest killers in the game despite her being only 110% speed compared to the standard killer speed of 115%. 
---
You suggested that the Spirit needed to have a 5 second stun immediately after phasing which would completely negate any ground she would have been able to cover and would make her power a detriment to use.
---
I don‚Äôt know what else you said because you deleted the post and I can only read what other people had to say about your points, but overall the replies didn‚Äôt seem overly toxic they were definitely questioning your reasoning and you got pretty defensive at times.
---
If bbq is only on bubba then just play normally you can get 2 hooks on most if not all of them and hopefully you can see survivors working on a gen far away dont forget to kick gems too since they'll finish it anyway, once a person has been hooked twice make a mental note using the bottom left icons for the survivors and at the end just hit pallets and such if you want to get stunned and break them. I do this with wraith (good thing he can ring his bell to signify farming) I'm at rank 12 and I dont want to rank up at the moment because of DBP so at these ranks it's easier to get points and also give survivors theirs.
---
god these films. OP, did you know they make third part?
---
I actually just recently made the switch (beginning of the year till now) I can tell you there‚Äôs ALOT that‚Äôs different! 
---
1.) Killers are more playable! I live in a relatively rural area (don‚Äôt know if that has anything to do with it) but my connection on Xbox is USUALLY bad so Nurse and Huntress is really hard due to constant frame rate drops‚ÄîNurse especially because alot of survivors get mini dead hards due to it. 
---
2.) I feel it‚Äôs ALOT less toxic I had to turn off messaging on Xbox just because in higher ranks survive with friends was so common so I‚Äôd constantly get hate, in my experience on PC I get it less and feel that when it does happen something usually gets done about it. 
---
3.) The regrind sucks I truly feel that because I bought every character before Spirit and starting back off on PC without some of those character really sucked‚Äîbut it‚Äôs kinda really like playing in a totally new environment so I didn‚Äôt really let it bog me down too much, I figured that I was gonna okay the game a lot anyway now is at least be able to enjoy it with new visuals, frame rates...And Bill, I guess. 
---
Either way I hope you have fun!
---
u will gonna waste ur petty add ons to get insta downs...im sure u can barely aim. try minecraft :)
---
I support this
---
Yes, more doctor fan art! Amazing work, I love it!
---
I didn‚Äôt know how to drop a killer until  a few months later lol
---
Huntress keep chopping like that she‚Äôs gonna be instadowning survivors without perks.
---
Wtf don‚Äôt use huntresses lullaby
---
I shouldn't have ever read these comments.
---
I get 50k for a match that lasts 30 min. Thats 100k per hours so that's only 8 hours to get 800k?
---
Someone call the wambulance
---
Well you are so right. If you want to comment there and give your opinion about something, you really have to balance your words unless you don't want to prepare yourself for a shit storm of downvote and toxic comments. I really thing the problem is that there are too much players who play only a side of this game and they just want to win win win and win. Every time they lose they start complaining about the thing that made him lose his recent games. Some people are just frustrated and toxic and they come on Reddit only to downvote and write salty comments on everything that is against the side they main. Personally I play both and I found a lot of toxicity coming from each part. Killers that camp, break their neck every time they down you, spam Mori animation for 5 min, tunnel and say ez in end game, and also survivors who t-bag, spam flashlight, run around and do nothing for an entire game even if you play fairly. Some people have just to chill and enjoy a game.
---
And who said cartoons aren't educational?
---
Overcharge (after damaging a gen, the next survivor who tries to repair it is faced with a difficult skillcheck)
---
Unnerving Presence (increases number of skill checks while survivors are within your in terror radius, also reduces the skill check success zone - stacks with overcharge to make overcharge skill checks even more difficult)
---
Distressing (increases terror radius, therefore combined with unnerving presence naturally increases the number of skill checks survivors face)
---
Hex: Huntress Lullaby (increases penalty for failed skill checks - combined with the above perks can make this see a lot of use, also it encourages players to spend time away from gens to look for the hex)
---
New survivor: DAVID HASSELHOFF

---
It hurts when the killer lies and kills you
---
Gameplay wise emblems make no sense sometimes (the devout emblem should always be iridescent in a 4k, but instead requires 9 hooks overall and a 4k). Lorewise, it makes sense as the entity feeds off hope and naturally, a killer who can insta down will give the survivors less hope and basically give the entity less to feed off of. (Not trying to justify it btw, just sayin)
---
It's every hit.
---
well yeah... this is war not love, everything goes
---
Symptoms include glowing bright red, hearing chainsaws and teleports wherever you go, and feeling a sense of impending doom
---
Often confused with rank1itis
---
That basically sums up the majority of killers I've had so far this event...
---
Its even worse on Plague or Trapper. Right now i think Piggy is best for all emblems...
---
Because he literally got downed on top of the hook. I wouldn't have been able to get into a position where I can blind the Killer without him just looking at a wall or beating me to the hook
---
This is exactly what I mean. People complain that Billy and Nurse dominate the meta but they also prevent killers from being released in a powerful state. If we want to have a varied meta, we need to not be afraid to have new killers be powerful from the very beginning.
---
For me it has a 100% chance to make all survivors go for the unhook and make me hit the wrong guy.
---
like survivors need yet another counter to everything. You have a counter. Destroy the totems.
---
Don't worry, we all feel like this. (and also, the Windows are not bugged, they are just visually bugged...)
---
he looks fine af in the red suit imo
---
lol in the lower ranks it's actually adorable I created a new account rank 20 as killer is actually makes me laugh
---
Yeah man i play on PS4 mostly but got the Xbox one while the servers were down for PS4 and yeah it was low ranks, there‚Äôs a lot of selfish survivors
---
I play both killer and surv, and tbh if you are good at surv against anyone other than nurse, you usually win. If you play your killer good, and remember to kick gens, you also usually do good.
---
Queue times for killer are really long right now... Guess it's time to go back to playing surv!
---
That's nothing. I got Mori'd less than 1 minute into a round by an iri head huntress. I'm instadowned, hooked, immediately unhooked by a David, m1'd by the huntress, Mori'd. 4 BPS were burned.
---
A suggestion would be don‚Äôt post it on this subreddit if you do decide to make another one.
---
Why make a post just to start some arguments about 2 "toxic" like behaviours? We don't need the community being split even more now.
---
this says alot about society
---
If he‚Äôs suggesting hitting him even tho he dropped the pallet I‚Äôve done this many times and I‚Äôve been called out once for lag switch
---
But, does No One Escape Debt? Hahaha, best of wishes mate
---
I mean I don‚Äôt know who does it but you are really hindering yourself and your gameplay. I would just learn and get better with a mouse, it definitely is better then a controller.
---
Ghost Face is out in the 18th, the bloodhunt is going on now.
---
Damn that sucks :(
---
He actually made a second account and commented that blurred out comment himself, just so he could make this meme and get advice this way.
---
Big Brain Reddit Main
---
LMAO the music makes it so much better, anybody know where it‚Äôs from?
---
If anyone is browsing the comments looking for advice:
---
Barbecue and Chili is a good perk on any killer, but on open maps, you could actually get a cross map shot with this perk
---
Iron Maiden is good on huntress because it drastically reduces your reload time
---
Not sure if there are any other perks that work particularly well on Huntress
---
I just read your comments because I was curious. You deleted the post, but other users paraphrased you. It‚Äôs pretty obvious based on what they said that you came off as trolling or don‚Äôt know what you are talking about.
---
Since you seem genuinely concerned, I guess I‚Äôll give you my 2 cents. Once you invest a certain amount of time in this game, pretty much certain ‚Äúopinions‚Äù become facts. Because we‚Äôve played this game enough to know this. Then someone, usually a new player, comes in going on about, ‚Äúblah blah blah‚Äù, when it‚Äôs quite literally wrong, you‚Äôre gonna get called on it. So when you say things like, ‚Äúclown doesn‚Äôt need his bottles‚Äù, people are gonna think you are trolling.
---
thank you this is great
---
Took me about 15 minutes to find a game as killer.  It's kinda silly, tbh.
---
Watch the whole thing or it‚Äôs not worth
---
Wait Dead Hard is toxic?
---
I've been having major connection issues on the Xbox version all day as well. The games are never really that laggy but out of nowhere I'll end up being disconnected.
---
Legend says he would chuck, he would, as much as he could, and chuck as much wood as a woodchuck would if a woodchuck could chuck wood
---
It should work this way for both sides
---
I don't get it
---
I bet you had that ready
---
Events like these really bring out the dick head survivors who unhook farm right near killers.
---
Or you can play Plague and have instadowns without wait.
---
I feel like this sub is full of salty survivors. Every time people speak about killer, killer perks or tryhard Survivor build (MoM, Adrenaline, DS and purple flashlight) you get downvotes. 
---
This doesn‚Äôt help discussions about the game and meta, if anything it just makes me want to use NOED even more so they at least have something real to cry about on Reddit for once.
---
Very unlikely. BHVR didn't change their roadmap because they wanted, they changed (this time) because they had to. 
---
Ash and Ghost Face being individual "chapters" happened because the opportunity to get the license for both characters appeared and BHVR took it. Obviously they couldn't release both in the same chapter. 
---
Unless something similar happens, we should be back on track. 
---
[2019 Roadmap](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D77W0S2WsAEkudU.jpg:large)
---
Dbd players are already toxic enough, we don't need a proximity voice chat
---
You should use them now :)
---
10 hrs later and nobody answered your plea. It's one of u/ZombieHuggerr meme templates. You'll have to search for it within his profile.
---
Also Resilience, if you're injured (saved me a couple times)
---
That's why many suggested to just remove tiers. Same amount of items and three times the perks you can get.
---
What's an Esp Ape???
---
I don't get it???????
---
Lore wise he went missing after the hallowed blight event
---
Oh wow I completely forgot this! That totally makes sense as to why the entries stopped, but I figured that wasn‚Äôt really a timeline for when the survivors got in pulled in. Thanks for informing me of that!
---
Every lobby I get in either has a leather face or a sweaty doc main
---
How much Huntress could a Huntress Huntress, if a Huntress could Huntress Huntress?
---
Old lighting was great. Old fog effects were great. New lighting is shit. Have to play on low because high has too much bloom and chromatics. Running behind a rock and just crouching in between trees could make you disappear for a second and juke the killer....or get stuck and take a saw from Billy. Good times.
---
If the game ever ends, he might be the last killer introduced
---
Chili add-ons work, but they just make no noticeable difference.  
---
I believe Ghostface will be available for shards(not sure, though).
---
That's awesome!
---
the fun thing is most killer's just loop themselves, it's really impossible to loop a killer that actually knows what hes doing...
---
To be fair, Ruin makes sure games don't end in 5 minutes.
---
Somebody
---
Generally licenced killers are real-world cash only (they have to pay the licence fees after all).
---
no. he's a licensed killer
---
Someone doesn't have friends...
---
The only difference is instead of tunneling Killer could go for the other person instead.
---
Survivor dont have a really viable second option.
---
RIP that pallet
---
I doubt it.
---
BHVR have always said they'd jump on any opportunity to get licensed characters. As such, I think Chapter 12 ended up getting split in 3 parts:
---
1. Survivor - Ash
---
2. Killer - Ghostface
---
3. Map - Reworked Badham.
---
Because one of the main reasons why they wanted to change the endgame was to stop hatch standoffs. If the killer can still grab midjump, nothing would have changed.
---
I think you're confused. Rank 20s are the only people who hide from BBQ and Chilli.
---
Some people have been pretty thick for me too. I've been messaging people in the pre game lobby to let them know I want to farm. Most have been good but some people just don't understand. Made some friends tho and had a good time with the survivors
---
True...
---
Again the chance of a survivor getting off hook is slim.
---
I personally don't go to close the hatch unless. I'm really in the mood for some extra bonus points.
---
While camping is a problem there are many people who go off and calling instance like this camping. Honestly it just makes them seem incredibly ignorant and entitled.
---
Once again the survivor did a really good job to escape however the killer in this clip didn't camp whether they camped in the match is a different story but at least in the clip shown there was no camping.
---
Hell if you consider this camping then looking in an injured survivors direction is tunneling.
---
Hes C tier at best. I played about 40 matches against him and rarely did 2 people die and it was uncommon for even 1 person to get triple hooked. 
---
I played about 15 games as him and you basically have to play like Myers where you build stalk on people then expose them when your close for the insta down. He also has pig crouch sneak mechanics but that was situational. His addons are mostly useless aside from the peaking ones that build stalk faster. 
---
He is very map dependent. Big open areas suck for him hes best in small close quarters like hospital, the game, macmillian.
---
Shit survivors or course say hes really powerful but he could still use some tuning if he hopes to see the light of consistent high ranks. He definitely a fun stealth killer for memes but I like ms piggie more.
---
Also, some people say hes a better Myers. In some situations yes he can be but Myers is far more consistent and in my opinion can still snowball harder.
---
that's a weekly "buff/cosmetics Freddy" picture post
---
Alright, thanks.
---
Wow you‚Äôre such a toxic asshole, it‚Äôs the fact that whenever a new killer comes it needs to be overpowered for killer mains to accept them.
---
Nope he needs 2 nerfs his stalk time and exposed time simple as that
---
Scott is probably the best huntress main at his peak practice, sadly with queues and the grind he's more variety as of late.
---
how? BBQ&amp;Chili is literally a perk to encourage not camping and its his perk
---
EZ my dude play 24/7
---
Haven't played in a while, what makes killers functional or not with add-ons?
---
"eeeewww this stuff stinks.. But I am tRiPpInG balls"
---
There aren't  any infintes anymore, only one i can think of is haddenfield with bl
---
The 360 was wholesome ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Had a killer DC at the very end as we all ran for the exit. I'm still a bit pissed. Fucking killer couldn't wait 10 more seconds.
---
Check the post history, this is a bot. It responded less than five seconds after I posted my comment. Downvotes and report.
---
Well he is a original character. Just the mask is licensed
---
I haven't don't this much yet, just 5 times, but worked every single time:
---
Be trapper.
---
Set up 3-4 traps in one location, not on the edge of the map. Hills are best.
---
Walk around your traps, stepping in each. They will probably do 2-3 gens until they realize what's going on, at least one will get curious and come to you. They usually start with just disarming, but will learn eventually that it's safe to get into trap. Then whole team joins and you can easily communicate that you want them to drop pallet on you, hook them, etc.
---
Why is iron maiden so good? Does the synergy with opening lockers anyway work that well?
---
Depends. How many hours have you spent, how much dlc did you buy, do you play survivor or killer.
---
If looping is toxic then using powers is too.
---
Idc if the killer kills me at the end of the game if that killer is nice enough to not tunnel someone and give us enough chances to earn bloodpoints, it‚Äôs a way of saying thank you ... but when a killer tunnels survivors even though someone offered bloody party streamers for everyone, that‚Äôs my issue
---
Happy oink noise
---
Haven‚Äôt seen it tried anywhere but I‚Äôm sure you still die. The little speed boost would have helped me exit though!
---
They should just add lines and emoji like in IdentityV such as "The killer is near me" or "I'm going to save you".
---
It's hell T.T
---
And he‚Äôs got improvements

Okay. Assuming I play Legion. I use perks that let me keep gens unfinished as long as I want it, but even then it's hard to run between some gens. The only thing I have to do is to keep 3 gens close to me and patrol them. That way the game lasts as long as I want to, but I also heard people don't like it.
---
Whispers and nurse's calling are great on huntress because people will try to hide very early thanks to your 40m humming,and whispers will somewhat counter that+a very good tracking perk at cutting off time at finding people.Nurse's calling's radius is bigger than your TR range,so you can do some sniping when people don't expect.
---
I have a sheet of transparency paper I stick to my monitor.
---
In the centre is a big crosshair I've drawn with a sharpie.
---
Essential for sniping imo.

I wish people would stop farming me without bt, they dont even care if its lf

May also be minor radiation poisoning

Just dont get hit 4head
---
Thx for reminding me.
---
Okay so first of all, that's a dumb comment. Firstly, can't be in multiple places at once? Are you stupid that's like saying she has counterplay because she doesn't have the ability to drag everybody on the map on top of her, of course she can't be fucking everywhere, nobody can you idiot. You also say "wastes time", okay so where's the waste of time when she grabs somebody off of the totem, or when just doesn't initiate chases because she's playing the OP build and doesn't rely on chasing? Not knowing which is which, what does that even mean? Think before you speak because the first counterplay makes 0 logical sense, the second counterplay is counterplay that she needs to initate and thirdly "which is which" isn't exactly counterplay let alone an argument.
---
I‚Äôd wait for ghostface
---
Prayerbeads are shit but 4 blink nurse is fine mkay
---
Ive seen too much hentai to know where this is going
---
"4 blink nurse is annoying", read you idiot. 4 blink nurse is not okay but the way I see it, atleast I can play hidden against somebody where I know is rather than a cunt just popping up, grabbing me and then from thereon out, I bascially can't do shit. I know it's hard but I'm sure you might learn to read someday sweetie :D
---
I just wish there was a thank you gesture. I give people thumbs up, but does that even do anything? For instance, I was hooked and a newb and this guy unhooked me AND made sure I made it safely to the exit.  Another guy distracted the enemy so I could get the exit open. I‚Äôd like them to know I appreciate them.
---
Pointing is confusing. I‚Äôve had people point at a gen so I helped them work on it, fine. Another time someone kept pointing and I had no idea what they wanted. I went in that direction and that‚Äôs where the killer was. 
---
I feel like to make this more evenly matched for solo players (compared to swf), more motions are needed to work together successfully, but I don‚Äôt want voice chat. I‚Äôd mute it if possible and quit playing if not possible.
---
I do like it when swf groups care about the solo player. I‚Äôd had some all try to sabotage hooks or distract the killer allowing me to wiggle away. I tried to return the favor by unhooking (as long as it was safe) and healing plus I did two gens solo and a third with one of them.
---
Its the sheer fact that michael has the potential to down multiple people and his power cant be canceled out by people. Survs can easily cancel out GF power
---
Haha serves them right tbh :)

Hate it when they stand there and don‚Äôt close it &lt;3
---
I‚Äôll second Plague Doctor. I love that look!
---
I mostly play the Wraith, though I'm thinking of changing it up soon for some variety. I got DBD like, two days ago maybe, absolutely love it, both ends of the gameplay are fun. Survivor and killer.
---
I think you're both in the wrong for this one, he just acted immaturely about the situation.
---
Camping is gay, but I get for the killer getting your shit cleansed is also gay.
---
Hag gets countered by a flashlight if you don't play smart, and doc can have a really hard time shutting anyone who is even decent at looping because they have to slow down to use their power, which is supposed to help them against loopers.
---
What makes you think they're easy to play?
---
Platform: PS4
---
Type of bug: Duplication exploit
---
Description: I lost connection to host, but it said the killer DC'd and everyone escaped. My friend said I was DC'd and my item was left behind. I checked my inventory and I still had it, and he had a duplicate item. My internet connection was fine throughout the whole trial.
---
Yeah I just got a friend into it about the same time. Wraith is alright, he's a little bit easy to play against, but a good one to learn the fundamentals on.
---
I just got facecamped on my first hook. ü§°
---
The point of the perk is that you get a buff when you are "Left behind". Not "Somewhat Left behind"
---
Because it is a hat? If you are that bummed out by not having a hat then maybe take a break
---
Another victim of noobmaster69
---
Nice
---
I insulted you because you're an idiot and didn't read the post prior to commenting because you are clearly a killer main. "Git gud and stfu" not exactly counterplay but what did expect from such a obvious dickhead, you can't loop 4 blink nurse? Maybe take your own advice and "Git gud", I never claimed u could loop nurse, what I said was you can play stealthy but you don't read because ur an illiterate ape and looping spirit isnt as easy as looping other killers because if he is good she can mindgame. Wanna try again you dumb fuck?
---
Is immerse when you blend with the environment
---
Couldn't come soon enough
---
Yo, who shit in your oreo cereal? Why so mad?
---
Well my guess is in Bob, is it: Whoever wrecked you?
---
It‚Äôs a completely useless perk now that end game collapse is a thing you can‚Äôt work on gens anymore... I get the name is ‚Äúleft behind‚Äù and not ‚Äúsomewhat left behind‚Äù but why have a perk that‚Äôs outdated and complete and utterly useless why would you work on a gen when you‚Äôre the only survivor left and the hatch has spawned.. and the killer is looking for it to close it.. you see what I‚Äôm saying?
---
i go ham. I need these points, I kill with no mercyü§°
---
Halloween Doctor, it's looks so cool
---
Your a salty little bitch aren‚Äôt you lol
---
Yeah it is useless, not every perk has to be viable.
---
good job but try playing killer, with some pudding I get around 100k to 120k points a game
---
I'm mad because the comment was dumb and I've played against it 3 times
---
Okay I get that but I mean the perk LITERALLY has no use anymore it‚Äôs not possible to use at all.. it has literally no function in the game anymore
---
Gandalf? Is that an insult?
---
yeah me too
---
Noobmaster69?
---
Fair enough. Any recommendations? I've heard the Nurse is good, dunno why. Gotta check her out.
---
I only have access to the first five though, is there a way to get more without paying real money?
---
The clown
---
Im with you on this, just, why.
---
That's called a chainsaw.
---
I literally had the same thing happen earlier tonight. Bp aside, does this seem to happen really frequently to you guys as well? Or do I have hideous luck?
---
Idk but after a 10 minute wait to make a lobby I waited 10-20 minutes just to get 4 damn survivors and never got a full lobby and gave up
---
üëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèª
---
Alright, thanks a lot. I'm thinking I might try Hillbilly soon, and perhaps get the Pig when possible.
---
I love tier 2 memes
---
What I'm asking is what did they change?
---
Normally I'm right into staging and a match within 30s.
---
Now it sits on seqrchinf for ages...
---
You cannot complain, survivors control the match in every aspect. If you are bothered with something, play the survivor meta like every1 else. Its boring, but you‚Äôll realise Soon enough thats its easy and you will never complain again.
---
If you want to lock content away from people for no reason at all, then maybe you should take a break
---
That‚Äôs either a bug or a hack
---
It turns a bad game into a good game that's for sure.
---
Plebeians. As a freddy main this posesz no challenge what do ever
---
I guess they can make it so you do everything quicker, like opening gates.
---
I second this notion
---
Hhhhhhhhhhhh* *pallet breaks*
---
They have to pay the guy who owns the mask.
---
Don't get found, 5head /s
---
Ash was a paragraph, not a Chapter. Same as Bill and Leatherface. Outside the usual 3-month chapter.
---
Except the idea behind the act is equivalent. You aren't insulted because there's piss on your pants, you're insulted because someone decided to piss on you
---
I wish I could do this after facing a sweaty 4-man swf all with flashlights

The Plague buff: Getting fully sick now disconnects the survivor instantly
---
I left about 3 months ago, my firends like a year befor that.
---
Mint Rag Hag: ‚ÄúNow you listen here you little shit‚Äù
---
I think I'm gonna stick with the normal headpiece and do the T-shirt/cargo pants body
---
Oh shit yeah I forgot about Mint Rag Hag, fucking op as shit on her
---
The fuck were those 360s XD
---
Yes mettle of man breaks the fear if getting downed
---
Dead hard does a similar thing, but it's counterable by beeing pacient and it needs manual activation, also the killer isn't losing much by missing a swing
---
Mettle of man is automatic, doesn't need the player to do anything exept get hit 3 times, the killer still needs to go through the cleaning weapon animation and DOESN'T CAUSE EXHAUSTION (biggest problem) and the only counter i know is not using mouse 1 at the obsecion, even tho, back in the day, to use decisive without beeing the obsetion, you had to wiggle to 35%, mettle of man does not need some kind of progress which the obsetion can use instantly
---
I 100% agree with everything you said above.
---
I'll even go as far to say that the players who run these all chase evasion builds are pussies and are probably too afraid to change their meta.
---
And I'm a survivor main.
---
It really do üÖ±Ô∏è like that tho...
---
My ruin got cleansed within 30 seconds at least 5 times last night.
---
That's how I'll feel on the inside, but I'll look like Ghost Face on the outside
---
Yeah, you can loop a Spirit if she's trash, LOL.
---
I dont see mettle of man?
---
Got nerfed hard recently, her base power doesnt have to offer much. You can perform decent, but not without the right Perks/Addons.
---
No, I brought an ebony and had 0 after being kicked to the menu.
---
If she's the kind of person to aggressively defend totems just tap one when she's chasing someone and leave. She has no way of knowing if you stayed on or not. If you have a map with grass and look carefully you can see it moving and at least not get grabbed. Also, anyone who thinks a killer is better than a nurse, and a 4 blink one at that, is... interesting.
---
Step 1: Allow P3 Bloodwebs to generate 3 perks and the player selects two before the Entity begins consuming. 
---
Step 2: All Single Category Offerings are changes to Post Game vs In Game. 
---
Step 3: QOL buff the BP gains for survivors mainly. It‚Äôs very telling how clogged Killer Queue gets during Double BP cause you get tons of people who don‚Äôt play killer but just spam Doc/Legion but still only Make It Out with a little more BP than an average game unless they‚Äôre trying to fully farm out.
---
What happened?
---
Its the same on xbox üòÇ even when you message them and they reply positive, they either wanna run around the map the whole time or they disperse as soon as you make your first hook. Rank reset was or rather the event timing was poor. A lot of people in yellow/green ranks dont know how to farm effectively plus they are scared of dying/being farmed by the killer so they run after someone has been hooked... like okay then.
---
Either duration or cooldown. These are the addons youre looking for.
---
No insidious?
---
Q&amp;Q counters that perk
---
What?
---
10/10
---
Salty survivor said playing Clown with add-ons was gay then realised the killer was Monto. The video is 'Pogo's basement part 5'. Skip to the end of the video, you'll find the chat. Pretty funny.
---
they even fall through ceilings
---
Then they go to get you in second phase. I don't even wanna play no more.
---
Not to mention anyone who doesn't bust their ass for rank will settle around 10 somewhere with the new system. Or at least in matching range with a 10.
---
Forgot to mention that this started happening way before rank reset.
---
You picked the wrong meme format fool
---
He‚Äôs pretty fun tbh. Buying him for discordance alone is worth.
---
Survivors (and killers for that matter) do NOT have to farm just because the other side wants them to. This rant is stupid. Thanks:)
---
Worst place in the world
---
Not everyone wants to farm though, because it gets really boring really fast (and some players use it as a bait). If you notice that your survivors don't react accordingly to your signals to farm, *please* just play the game in a normal way.
---
Myers is a stealth killer with an instant down and he can activate hia ability during a chase, so you say that he is also broken ? Plus, Myers doesn't have a 30 seconds cooldown on his power.
---
The comment wasn't dumb, you're just ignorant and pissed off
---
If your a killer who wants to farm just message people in the lobby that way anyone who doesn't want to can leave.
---
He is hard countered by detection perks and SWF teams, you can still loop him and gen rush him, that's your answer.
---
But where is the lightborn perk? I only see unrelenting and deerstalker
---
I don't see Lightborn in his perks, was it built in?
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
He's still underwhelming, lol
---
It was a joke. You didn't have to write a thesis lol
---
That'd change absolutely nothing.
---
If it functioned how Adren does, you still need to be injured to use it, meaning you just BL/DH between it being charged and the downing hit, then MoM pierces and refreshes exhaustion. There's also then nothing to stop adren going off.
---
Where are they playing? NA?
---
Its just a smart tactic. Survivors know killers want that closing hatch BP and to start the endgame so they sit by a door instead. It is still risky as hell, hard to pull off and takes time and usually a killer will walk up behind as your trying to open the gate.
---
Sorry that closing the hatch doesn't give you a free win? I don't know what the complaint is.
---
I get bored with builds and change them up all the time, I can't see how these little dullards still enjoy just running all the same perks all the time, and ALL they do is add hits. Way to be interesting in the slightest guys.
---
People are reading way too much into this imo
---
I really wish there was a split second where the sound cue doesn‚Äôt kill you but it‚Äôs still pretty awesome
---
Eh, camping gets you gen rushed tho
---
If you're familiar with TF2 people, you probably know the term "main class". Basically it's the class you play the best. In TF2 there are 9 classes and all of them are pretty unique, so normally you have one favourite class you excel at, and one-two more you are good at and the rest are "average" or worse.
---
I am a gay male and I approve this message.
---
Ruin, Distressing, BBQ n Chili, Sloppy Butcher / Discordance
---
Honestly wraith and myers are the best designed killers in the game, they'r the only ones that can actually jumpscare you.
---
SWF is strong and can severely turn the game on its head but proximity voice comms would be hundred times worse. You would turn the game into Friday 13th with annoying kids spewing nonsense, when you had a toxic t-bagger they can now chat shit in game and speaking as a solo player who played both games I know the annoying chatter would turn me off DBD as it did with F13. If you removed SWF you would lose a good portion of people who play the game or people would play it less to play other games they can with friends, meaning knock on effects like longer queue times.   
---
This is not a good solution.
---
Sadly it‚Äôll never happen, as the owner of this creature is a kiddie fiddler.
---
Lol ya I don‚Äôt play 2x bp as survivor or killer. Toxic dads and cheap killers are all that pop up. Maybe if there was a better reason but bp is pointless in the long run
---
Every perk *should* be viable though. There is no reason why there should be perks that have no reason for you to ever want to pick them up in the game. Perk like Left Behind and Monstrous Shrine should not be in this game as they currently are.
---
Pig=upvote
---
Maybe it‚Äôs because killers want a good, fun, killer and not Freddy? Ghostie isn‚Äôt even top tier right now, probably A or B tier.
---
The hag traps get me as well sometimes!

How do you have that many hours and only 3 maxed out?
---
&gt;Sorry that closing the hatch doesn't give you a free win? I don't know what the complaint is.
---
If survivors didn't get all 5 gens, killer already "won". I think you meant doesn't give you a free 4k.
---
Exactly
---
I would personally love to have the nurses power, she‚Äôs also my main, teleportation seems awesome
---
Sometimes, you know all the words in a sentence but your brain can not parse them in a way that is intelligible. That is what is happening for me right now, my brain is refusing to make sense of this outside of the horrified screaming of being hooked.
---
This
---
The word "toxic" is WAY overused in gaming.  Emote after a super close win? Toxic.  Do whatever you need to do to win the match?  Toxic.  Use a flashlight or toolbox? Toxic.  Sprint Burst? Toxic.  Franklin's? Toxic. It's annoying.
---
I love how survivors have "lets farm" names and then they play normally untill you start wining then we farm.
---
It's both sides friend.
---
u liar, if you would be kind you wouldnt pressure her untill thhhe very last second so she could open gates earlier
---
That bothers you that much?
---
Not everyone likes to farm.
---
But it‚Äôs double bloodpoints
---
Pleb.
---
I get double bloodpoints by playing normally as well.
---
People getting facecamped don‚Äôt lol
---
Facecamping isnt really playing normally in my book lol
---
Nope. Noed, devhope and blood hound. Plus he was moving.
---
This is a meme about facecamping
---
Bro, i'd shit my pants if that happened
---
It's not always smart though.  Yeah you can tunnel one person into the ground but with decent teammates you will only kill that 1 person.  People would rather settle for 1 kill instead of pressuring the map.  The #1 way to win the trial in this game is map/gen pressure. I'd rather have exit gates powered with 4 survivors alive and all on death hook versus 1 dead and 2 hooked once but that's just my play style.
---
I love doing this and I love when it works. Incredibly satisfying as a Spirit Main!
---
Cocky, because of balanced landing.
---
Late reply but thenk you!
---
Well, it shouldn't be too hard actually, it's just the coding that makes the frame rate drop
---
I get that this isn't funny but that seems like an extremely high amount of downvotes for an ultimately harmless comment
---
How is gg "toxic"? What a baby
---
Entity was having none of that.
---
Woah, that‚Äôs the least funny thing I‚Äôve seen all day
---
Lmao, what you don't enjoy the hunting event mask trapper just constantly hitting you on the hook (big ol' /s)
---
I know what you mean but I mean when you are coming up on the person who is getting unkooked while you are there you down the unkooked person first then go for the other person
---
I'm the type of person that gets bored easily with something so I loved when they brought new killers out almost one after the other as quickly as they did. I hope that trend continues, but at the same time, I prefer quality over quantity so as long as they don't pop them out so fast that every killer or survivor they release is just some cheap, slightly different, slightly lazy copy of the others. I heard the latest killer TBR (to be released) ghostface, isn't going to be a very deep character and he seems lazily created. Legion was a bit of a disappointment because his ability is very underwhelming. For those who don't know the legion, his ability adds a timer to a survivor when he hits them with frenzy and if the timer reaches 0 the survivor is automatically put into the dying state, however the timer doesn't start until the survivor gets far enough away from you, basically you have to stop chasing them, and then even if it does start, it is too easy for them to heal before the timer reaches 0. The only thing I can think to do is to frenzy hot them, walk the other way until the timer starts, and then go find them again before they heal and Chase them until either you down them or until their timer runs out.

Please to anyone viewing this have an opened mind, the real reason I posted my needless oppinon here was to share awareness that we've already gone through this whole song and dance before and need not to repeat history, be patient before overreacting cause it'll cause lots of problems to spiral in this already disheveled community. Also please take the time to read our rebuttals before downvoting it'd be appreciated as to see if we can have a neutral argument about Ghostface rather than trying to defuse the argument by downvoting anyone you disagree with which gets us nowhere in the end.
---
Thanks again!
---
Fun fact: chopping wood gives a guy more testosterone than masterbating or working out.
---
Lag is your best friend, until its not
---
That's another thing why do they still get hatch even though they still have 4 gens? I haven't played in months started again last weekend.
---
She wants to dance with you :)
---
Step 3 no.  Killers gain more bp for a few reasons.  To encourage people to play killer more.  Red rank killer is not fun, just stressful from when the game starts till when it's over.  Survivors can get free items from chests, they can 99 percent an item and escape.  You also have 4 offerings per map as opposed to 1 from the killer.  The bloodpoints are designed around this.  Making survivors webs smalled by a few nodes each web would be a more practical solution.
---
True. Can confirm got 6 adepts this way
---
- You're*.
---
- Not everyone is on console. PC doesn't have this option.

I‚Äôm pretty sure monto made a couple videos on michael and wraith, with speed addons. I think it‚Äôs vault master wraith/myers

I'm gonna assume you just forgot how the leggings look but good drawing nonetheless

Im not shit talking mate calm down ive just never seen it, i cant even 360 on pc, go through my comments and find a single toxic comment on any sub.

Every time I go out to trim my hedges I become Billy. So I got that going for me

Trapper, so people won't come into my room without me knowing.

Why don‚Äôt you just lock the door?

I already stalk people...
---
Spoopy

if power along with the cool downs then either spirit, hag or wraith. probably spirit.
---
Why ask a question and worry about the response
---
When you unlock the teachables you can prestige your david and then you probably could get them
---
I don't have a lock and bear traps are 10 times cooler.
---
I came for the comments.
---
Removed - Offtopic
---
How do you get that far into the game without knowing how the RBT works?
---
U got a point there m8
---
I feel like the wraith has the best power. I‚Äôd do nurse to teleport but I don‚Äôt want to hurt for a few seconds after each jump
---
ive been playing survivor bc i know the killer wait times will suck. i really want to switch though bc i have bbq on most of my main killers and alot of BPS
---
What I find interesting is that the only downside of the perk is so easy to work around. I've only seen a handful of survivors that run the perk every have their auras revealed when they use MoM. I would cool if they changed the parameters for the aura part of the perk to try and balance it
---
Is it just me or does this guy look CG? The movement of the swinging of the axes in his hands just make his movements look unnatural lol
---
Agree 100%
---
DS is nowhere near OP lmao
---
Didnt the creator touch kids innappropriately?
---
"Shitpost" seems like a very humble flair for this Piece of Art ¬∞\_¬∞

i absolutly adore this &lt;3 :) if only he was shirtless... :D

Doctor's, probably. The wraith's one is cool.
---
Aww buddy, damn.
---
You want a hug? &gt;:
---
just dc 4Head
---
I main hag and sometimes when a trap is set off I teleport and just automatically hit whatever is in front of me. If it's the person who just got unhooked, I'll leave them and find the other person.
---
Sigh, The Price of Freedom is Steep.
---
As i wrote in the disclaimer, we just like the art not the artist, it is to bad...
---
Yeah..
---
Yeup
---
Well he cant cone to the game then
---
The Plague that would be awesome
---
Looks like those goalposts just jumped a mile away. Let's bite this in the bud before a third survivor main pops out of the woodwork.
---
Does the OP mention facecamp? No.
---
Does the OP mention camping, which could be seen as a broad term? Yes.
---
Did I refer to events that could possibly take place in the event of facecamping, where you do nothing but stare and sit at a hook, hitting a hooked survivor every few seconds in an attempt to show ' Pro Strats ' and be toxic? No. Why? Because a facecamper wouldn't take the time to notice two survivors, unless they both ran directly behind the hook, not applicable to the statement mentioned by myself.
---
Do I give a scenario where a killer notices two survivors lurking a distance from the hook, while scanning the area and being observant? A scenario of which, it is best for the killer to waste those three survivors time while the fourth is working on a generator while ruin is active? Yes. 
---
Do I at any point allude to face camping taking place, which is the act of standing in front of a hooked survivor, stabbing them every few seconds while still hooked, and doing nothing but in a mocking and toxic way? No.
---
You can bring the goalposts back now.
---
Ikr, i had a pig game earlier where the gate was opened so i downed some survs and put bear traps on to see if they would fall for it or not and had a Megan running around trying to get her RBT off despite it not being triggered
---
Mmmmm... Maybe we can find a way for this request üòè, ahah. Thanks a lot, really : I'm very happy you like it so much!! :) &lt;3
---
idk why ppl say this do they not understand that would destroy the game
---
Wow. I actually gave you merit as maybe being a logical guy with a resonable complaint, but I see you're just a salty trash survivor who can't stand getting beat. Here's a tip to help your problem: make a new account and stay in Rank 20 where you belong.
---
Be a real bro. Get all the boys out the exit door, then go be greedy and get the hatch once theyve all left
---
Except you are going to get kills without tunneling in the majority of games, especially if you are rank 8-20. Therefore the choices aren't win or lose, but win with tunneling or win without tunneling.
---
No reason at all... Other than to celebrate launching on a new platform. It's a hat. No one cares. (Correction no one _should_ care.)
---
if they nerf ghostface in any way i swear to god i will be SEVERELY disappointed in the devs
---
Imagine writing a paragraph in response to a yes or no question lmao
---
At least on PS4 I‚Äôve only ever encounted Jake Parks using IW. And I‚Äôm devotion 6
---
That is why its a fan chapter like i wrote in the videos disclaimer, its our take on how we thought he would be if he was in the game.
---
I love to play Mint Rag Hag, it's so damn fun, especially with MYC lol.
---
Gotta pull that lever with more s p e e d
---
Yup, nothing but mega and Claudette‚Äôs with purple perks. Meanwhile I‚Äôve had the game 2 1/2 days and am getting facestomped. I was doing ok 2 days ago :/
---
today i had 148k game
---
People are calling ghostface op? Last I heard about a week ago people were calling him trash, and he still doesn‚Äôt seem to be a great killer. As long as you‚Äôre alert and break line of sight often in chases like you would with a Myers then he‚Äôs fine
---
I don't remember this ever being a thing
---
When I try to do the legs how the actually go, it ends up looking like trash lol
---
As a killer, a good Dead Hard is one of the moves I respect the most.
---
Not if you are a hillbilly.
---
Ya the ones I can't mind game are really boring to play around. I don't mind getting outplayed if they read me on a few but when the only option is to run circles till it's dropped on my head is boring af. It's why I'm running spirit fury now lol
---
And hillbilly.
---
Did you get them all?
---
Nice job, keeping your cool is major key
---
Well that was my 5th time in a row getting no kills and a ton of toxic crap. I‚Äôm out, maybe I‚Äôll play again in a few weeks but I doubt it.
---
Something is definitely different.  As killer I actually search for game now before starting a lobby,  as survivor it was taking awhile till the event started and then I seemed to get into games within like 30-45 seconds
---
You fool, you fell for the classic blunder!
---
Yea I just searched for like 20 mins a killer and I just got into a game now
---
Nope, just did it for fun. Half the people died to time anyway. Got like 12k bp I think
---
Elaborate ? What‚Äôs the issue ?
---
Tysm!!!
---
Me too :) I now exclusively use Kindred and Open Handed to expose any campers to my team. I actually got good use of it last night.
---
Ok, I'll accept it.
---
r/Iamverysmart
---
Who still uses leader?
---
*salt shaker*
---
In 20 games as killer you don't even get to a slightly good rank, it's obvious that a team with good survivor is rare cause your rank is low as fuck. Just keep playing killer, try to get to rank 1 and then we will talk again. I play both sides of this game and I have more than 1000 hours and I can told you that untill rank 10 you feel so overpowered but when you start playing at red ranks you are gonna get bullied and your are going to lose so much games if you don't use strong builds and if you are not good with the killer you are playing.
---
eh noed is easily countered though, by breaking totems
---
I thought that if the RBT is put on after the gens are repaired and/or exit gates opened, they could run out with it on? I know before the end game collapse, they couldn't run out. But I honestly haven't play as pig or against pig with RBT on after the gens are done.
---
LMAO this is funny as fuck
---
I went up to the styptic, then went down, took the letter, entity ate We'll Make it, then went for SB and that was taken after I took the clamps. I'm not massively bothered that it took both Perks, moreso the fact that it went straight from one to another.
---
Looping is toxic,trying to survive is letting the killer kill you so you respawn at the campfire so you survive
---
No problem.
---
If u get pulled out of a locker u can die without getting hit üòÇ
---
You can't really, you just need to find the hatch first... or after the other 3 survivors die you can wait at a gate and wait for the killer to close the hatch.
---
The entity stole a perk for boys
---
I think that's what he's saying, that some people don't realize that
---
When the game is **about to** become an 1v1, go sit at the exit gate switch and let the killer look for hatch. As soon as he closes it, you try to open the door. 
---
This is your best shot, unless the killer is Billy in a map where he can chainsaw endlessly.
---
The entity goes for the most valuable items first, ie, perks, you sealed off its path from one perk meaning that it would restart at the next most valuable item, ie, the other perk. The game also not so subtly lets you know when the entity is about to take a perk with a sound cue and the swirling black splotch popping up near wherever its going to go first. This aint the game's fault, you just werent paying attention
---
First match and I got a facecamping, tunneling wraith. What a fun time
---
&gt;The only thing you need to fix is your idiotic bloodweb choices.
---
Best reply, hahaha.
---
He could've easily gone for SB and then the Styptic just fine.
---
Elaborate please.
---
I've been having the opposite with swf that go all toolboxs '3'
---
It only explodes at gates if it‚Äôs active, which yours was
---
:(
---
Ignoring prestige, it's a bit more than 67 levels to get all the perks, especially since many of the early levels do not include perks in their webs. Not only that,  it would take killers at least 171 levels and survivors at least 195 levels to get all perks to level 3 (assuming all webs included a perk). Also either 40 levels or 6000 shards to unlock a character's unique teachable perks
---
I mean technically I'm already a Trapper, I just gotta go find my traps.
---
No, DCing means you won
---
**** Elkjop
---
If the rbt was placed after exit gates powered, it won‚Äôt pop your head. If placed before the last gen and is timing down, you‚Äôre held hostage.
---
Also learned the hard way, but now I know. Beep = bad
---
&gt;be me
---
&gt;Myers
---
&gt;find 3 Survivors working on a gen
---
&gt;stalk
---
&gt;no one notices me
---
&gt;o boi T3 here I come
---
&gt;*Tier 3 noises*
---
&gt;down all three
---
&gt;one of them DCs on the ground, other two suicide first hook
---
&gt;last person gets the hatch
---
&gt;5 gens done
---
&gt;3 kills
---
&gt;DbD be like "safety pip"
---
Died in the game, I have
---
Yell the n word, I must
---
Legion is still kinda bonkers for emblems. You "end" chases (get first hit) really fast which contributes to a really good emblem. If you have good perks as Legion you're basically guarenteed a pip with them.
---
Every hit will provide points to Chaser and Malicious.
---
&gt;rarted
---
"Best" doesn't mean "only thing I can do."
---
I may be the best soup chef in the land but I know how to fry a fucking egg.
---
What does MM mean?
---
Wraith, being invisible and scaring the shit out of people by ringing a bell sounds amazing
---
I'm in NA but they appear around.
---
Classic Gemini you are
---
Jokes on you lol
---
I was Killer lol. Yeah the Feng got a really clean stun on me but I still somehow hit them and I was like "**Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh?**"
---
I tried swinging in the air and spinning around and not chasing and hitting the lever not sure what else I could've done to have made it obvious
---
I will bet you 1000 to 1 and placing a Black Cheque or chip. He will need surgery on both shoulders in the next 2-4 years after repeated use of doing this.
---
Wow! A grip for a flashlight! Good job
---
Lol, youve never played spirit have you...
---
its actually a lot of fun if you manage to get 4 or 5 tokens. Besides ruin just gets boring since when I play survivor I see it almost every game
---
Lmfao
---
Actually it even hides Freddie's aura reading. I've played as Freddy and was using the strat of letting them run away so I can see their aura and this MF had to have gotten in a locker before I could get far enough away because his aura never showed and later on I seen their aura creeping out of the locker
---
That's just how the bloodweb works, it's not a bug or unintended. You could have gone for We'll Make it first, then the Entity would have gone up the Sprint Burst node and you would have had enough time to take the insta heal.
---
Run Whispers if it bothers you.
---
Hmmmmmm
---
He‚Äôs lying. They always showed the perks.
---
I just recently started playing, but if my team isnt getting generators, and theres only 2 of us left, I'll go hunt for the hatch. I had 3 straight hatch escapes yesterday
---
Ahhh. It's too bad there's not some actual monetary incentive, since BHVR makes a lot off of that stuff I imagine.
---
oh god oh fuck
---
You clearly don't know how it is in brazil
---
Michael Myers
---
üòØ
---
I just got a match after 15 minutes of waiting survivor ps4
---
Very good paint editing btw
---
Why ask why people don‚Äôt like him then proceed to dickride when people say why lol
---
Played 18 games last night, here are the numbers.
---
7 = Face camped from the start of match (me or teammate)
---
4 = Proxycamped within range of Kindred showing killer the hole time
---
13 = Tunneled off Hook (Me or Teammate) 
---
1 = Dr. Who Raged quit as we were walking out the exit gates, because he was a trash player and couldn‚Äôt do a proper camp with 4 random solos that stomped his ass with good team work and no coms!
---
I just started playing like, Wednesday. Had multiple DC'S from salty killers yesterday, once dc'd and messaged me calling me a camping p*ssy because I got out through the hatch (party chat with friends, killer picked up last teammate who was insta dead on hook and he spotted it) also had killers dc because they couldn't catch me, got looped, or because they didnt know no mither let's a survivor get back up.
---
Laughs in Huntress
---
Literally when i get games like that more than once in half an hour I normally just switch to killer or I just don‚Äôt play because that shits so boring
---
I don't mind it for a couple matches, but it gets boring real fast.
---
I stopped playing becuase the que time
---
for both are ridiculous
---
Borger time
---
#SO FUNNY IM DYING
---
Same.  I seem to find more keys than anything else.
---
I can't talk, i dc vs freddy all the time... weak or not, hes no fun to go against.. always up for a long drawn out game, and 99% of all freddy players tunnel because they have to.  Did you at least do some farming with the random? :D
---
I get my bloodweb to the point where I can take a perk at a single notice, then when the entity shows sighs of wanting to take the desired perk, I go for it immediately.
---
[Hi there](https://imgur.com/a/fx4xols)
---
Hmm not sure.  I did a killer game with lvl 1 bbq (2 stacks, so.... +50%), and 2 party streamers... my 30k became 120k.  Gogo maths!
---
Me
---
Why would I go for SB? There are better exhaustion Perks.
---
If you use Vanity mirror and Judith Tombstone you'll get a abysmally slow movement speed(Slower than the survivors) and thus you're now Burger King Myers.
---
Judging how my friends are really good at climbing and vaulting shit while i'm kinda mediocre, I can relate.
---
I'll play normally until the other side expresses farming interest
---
Let's be honest, most of the susie fans would be damn happy if she wore fishnets.
---
He‚Äôs still underpowered üòÇ
---
Nice! It just feels so fitting for Dwight to be the main survivor
---
Me too! I‚Äôm on PS4. If you also play PS4 and ever wanna play SWF or KYF, let me know. üòå
---
OH HELLO
---
That makes sense, he‚Äôs super into Kpop so I‚Äôm happy people like his too!
---
Lol funny, the thing about new killers is they really need time to settle before people start freaking out. Give it some time, learn how to counter him. Im saying this as a survivor main
---
Myers is better than him. I‚Äôd put him right under Myers on the tier list.
---
I‚Äôm just using all my padded jaws rn
---
Nice! What's your PS4 name? I'll add you right now.
---
Well I got all 4 of them. And then I read ‚Äúonly perks‚Äù and was like ‚Äúdoes that mean just perks‚Äù and then I read something about how Merciless Victory can not be achieved without going the extra mile
---
What did it cost?
---
petycache. I should be on in a little while, was planning on farming some points for my baby ghostface.
---
Vampires don't have to be Japanese honestly they are mostly European
---
Exhaustion perks are great and I used to run Sprint Burst, but then I found myself relying on it too much and focusing more on the cooldown meter rather than other things
---
For me it's either clowns with noed or salty Billies, because you didn't let them down you with chainsaw.
---
Only one way to find out haha, and thank you so much, you too
---
You can say that but without swf we would not have the game as big as it is today and prob would not have so many license killers. Them removing it would be the biggest mistake they could do that the game would not recover from
---
Gotta get the timing down, dont start until the survivor is at the killers shoulder but before the killer can move. The killer always does this thing where he kinda has to change how he is holding the survivor before putting him on his shoulder, start the blind right when he does this. (Hope this makes sense, i camt think of how to word it)
---
Ok, just sent you a friend request, it's Sun btw.
---
I like to run borrowed time and kindred, rather than crutch perks. I‚Äôm not the best survivor, so I‚Äôd rather help the team
---
This is stupid because it will tell the entire game you have an ebony Mori. The disconnects at the start of the game would be insane
---
Always in lockers
---
I think hes ok, not more. He just seems better because survivor have not figured him out yet. Kinda like Plague, when survivors know what to do they are both mid tier. So i agree pls dont nerf anything, give it a bit time...
---
If Hatch is closed.
---
Go to a door and wait a bit till the killer goes away. Go the first time for like 20% so there is no light yet. Go back to hiding and when the killer is going away for the second time go fully on it and hope for the best
---
Same on PC tbh
---
Get a Merciless Killer with her 3 unique perks? It's the same for every killer and survivor. Nothing specific or bullshit about it. Gt Merciless Killer with any killers 3 unique perks, escape with an survivors 3 unique perks.
---
Thank you!! I‚Äôm glad people get it and enjoy it just as much as I do
---
That still doesn't excuse the fact that SWF on voice comms destroys the game's balance and design.
---
r/unexpectedsunny
---
BBQ and Chilli doesn't encourage camping, it just shws survivors auras for 4 seconds, if you are far away it encourages him to leave him to go to your location.
---
Thanks! I love DBD and I wanted to show it
---
A new species of orangutans
---
My man Jonathan Reid needs to be in the game.
---
eh, he'll get nerfed anyway after players buy the Ghostface DLC
---
Oh sweet blood, it sings to me
---
Woah, that's the least kind comment I've seen all day
---
Also to note, even if you understand the timing sometimes you will still fail bc it will be a hair to early or late. Also there will be plenty of times when you just cant get the right angle or make it in time to save.
---
Man why don't I play Survivor anymore? It's a goddamn mystery [who fucking knows?!](/intensifies)
---
Behavior please ban this fucking **filth** it's ruining your game. I'm so **fucking SICK** of **every FUCKING match** being ruined by **FUCKING DCERS** who think the Killer playing the game normally is somehow a fate worse than death. It's not fun for anyone for one (yet alone multiple!) Survivor(s) to quit the game because "oh no the meanie Killer did a thing I didn't like waaaan my entitlement!"
---
If a player DCs or suicides within the first 5 minutes of the match they should be fucking banned from matchmaking for being a cunt, or at least sent into a "I'm a little crybaby who can't play the game" low priority queue.
---
I brought a crappy toolbox and a Sealed Envelope because I expected Franklin's Demise so I'm not too salty about losing my offerings but I'm still fucking pissed at the goddamn filth ruining this game.
---
Lol until you get face camping killers or P3 gods who should of ranked up by now, but purposely stay st low ranks to get easy games.
---
Bloodhunt events in a nutshell
---
When the killer pick him up when I should aim my flashlight
---
Man i have the feeling that i am more waitin than playing

---
Heated gamer moment, huh
---
True toxicity is surviving from the killer or trying to kill survivors
---
Now he just needs those perks reworked. But the devs don't need to rush in that department, they compensated very much so with reworking GF's power, one miracle at a time.
---
Pre-balance Freddie be like: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm the trash man, I throw trash all over the ring and eat the garbage‚Äô
---
It's double bp can't blme them. You can just do gens or die on hook, or if it comes to it dc.
---
So you have to get the right timing down and get in the right position to blind
---
I'm seeing some big brain Micheals with NOED, makes me laugh. Terribly horrifying
---
I just play
---
Right before or as they're about to start moving, it's all about timing and it takes some practice to get it down.
---
try being slightly higherr ranked and going through the reset... I've played a dozen games this morning and it's just camping killers or rage quitting survivors
---
you got what you deserved for disrespecting Amanda like that
---
Shit post doesn't make your post immune to criticism!
---
Yeah, usually killer queues take a maximum of one minute for me before the first survivor is matched. Now the search is crazy long
---
Wait, what's happening to Feng here? I'm sorry for the noobish question, I haven't played the game personally in like a year and only kinda follow it sometimes. I've tried looking it up and haven't found anything.
---
Everyone don't care they are secretly babies who want everything handed to them but can't handle challenges so complain and make everyone stressed out.
---
your criticism falls flat when it‚Äôs a joke? It‚Äôs not a serious statement?
---
Yeah can't really blame them for that, but 7 GAMES IN A ROW ;-;
---
Ps4 user here, seems like the match times wre taking longer than usual.  Anyone else experiencing this?
---
The people who complain about this just want 4 survivors to escape every game.
---
I appreciate wholesome killers like this. Too many times have I played killer and been like ‚Äúwtf HOW did that hit.‚Äù I‚Äôm gonna start doing this now too.
---
^This
---
Honestly wish I'd get a killer that farmed, or at the LEAST wouldn't go full tryhard then dc as the last gen completes.
---
Are you saying a bad joke doesn't exist?
---
*Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, your cool (baby Dwight) *and fuck you I'm done*
---
bad jokes do exist, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad to joke about the shitty elements of a video game. stop being so defensive and antagonistic, fam. Es just a gaem.
---
use kindred with 4 open handeds
---
Never mind I described (two times) a situation in which I enjoy having the perk on my build...
---
Why you have to be mad? It‚Äôs just game
---
This correcting grammar move is a petty bitch move for absolutely no reason other than to make themselves look like an asshole. We ALL know the correct usage, but typos exist and sometimes no one gives a fuck to edit a comment just to change the spelling of the word of which we know the intended meaning.
---
Lol i kinda explained the window you have in the first comment. So no its not broken. I do it all the time. Just start the blind when they reposition before outtijg the surv on their shoulder
---
I quote my friend: "Fuck off we can't have no fun cause y'all are a bunch of shit eaters"
---
Good point
---
i was watching a friend .. but that is what i figured
---
i was asleep in bed watching my friend. and i was like, i gotta get up and clip this lol. his reactions are priceless!
---
The n-word is NOED
---
I did exactly that. I used all 3 of the hags perks and got 4 sacrifices and did not get the achievement
---
If you BM its toxic, but if you don't then your just trying to survive.
---
My friend just logged in and somehow lost all progress he has made in the game after 240 hours and 18.5 mil cumulative bp earned. Hes only being offered 1mil bp in compensation. Hes going to uninstall the game and i might too if this is all the support behavior can offer. Genuinely mad rn.
---
Except they have changed the requirement for killers. 
---
It used to be you only need to get a 4K, now it‚Äôs changed where you must double pip.
---
Survivors don‚Äôt have to pip at all. They can hide the entire game and let everyone else do all the work. So yeah it‚Äôs kind of BS.
---
Oh shit, really? That was you? Gg bro.
---
If they didn't play just right, that could've been a 2k or 3k for you. But with coordination and communication we were just able to get everybody out safely.
---
Yeah. It is.
---
I HIGHLY recommend watching Usyliss video about flashlights, I got the timing down because of that video
---
beep = bad, ez enough to remember. thank you!
---
Thank you sir
---
Mint Rag gives you manual teleportation. Manual teleportation means that you don't need survivors to trip your traps to go to them. Ergo, even if they crouch their way to the hook to avoid the trap, you can teleport back for the instadown anyway.
---
Which means you basically cannot avoid being instant downed after every rescue. If you want to recycle survivors off the hook as efficiently as possible, there you go, it's broken as fuck. It's fine though, since Mint Rag is a extremely uncommon in the wild due to its rarity.
---
I know that feeling of running dumpster diver, finding a key and being like ‚ÄúFellas, I found a key. Now the random just has to die and we win!‚Äù
---
4 sacrifices isn't necessarily a Merciless kill. You lost points from camping.
---
I'll never understand why I'm rank 4-5 before rank reset and then it throws me all the way back to 13....8-10 I could get but 13? Jesus it takes forever to fucking rank up because dumb ass team-mates keep farming each other instead of doing tactical unhooks and depriving anyone else of altruism. Holy shit. Side note: Bing Bong sound effects are perfect. XD
---
I will try to watch some video on how to flashlight save
---
Yeah but then I wouldn't have anything to complain about, that's not how the game works.
---
I thought that was common sense
---
I will check out his channel
---
GF?
---
https://youtu.be/pshlJLOeX7k
---
Yeah, i was referencing if we removed tiers of perks and just had one perk tier overall. I didn't know how many perks there were and I thought 67 perks sounded close to being accurate.
---
How was I camping
---
I'll usually be in red ranks, even at rank 10 and closer to rank 1 I'll be teamed up with rank 15 players that literally don't save, don't do gens, hide in a locker all game to emerge when everyone is dead to look for a hatch.
---
I do the ‚Äúcome here‚Äù emote to the back of their head so it looks like I‚Äôm slapping them in annoyance.
---
Why? Where i should post then?
---
A small price to pay.
---
Because let's face it most people who play this game are toxic assholes. Not all but some.
---
Lmaoo
---
Oh, Sorry.
---
Lucky, all I‚Äôve been getting are tryhards who tunnel me straight off the hook
---
Nothing they can do about that without destroying the game. So there is no point saying remove swf
---
GhostFace
---
No, my point is that people sometimes hate him because he sometimes whines,but like, everyone whinned on this game
---
... That still doesn't excuse the fact that SWF on voice comms destroys the game's balance and design.
---
And dick killers that bring moris and dc if they see that survivors using bp offerings.
---
We're all dicks on this blessed day.
---
I HATE THIS  
---
EVERY GODDAMN MATCH
---
Thank you for the video link
---
I‚Äôm responding about this post and not what you said
---
Okay, didn‚Äôt see the flair, fair enough. But can you explain how you think the core concept is flawed?
---
Ah. Shit. Im dumb
---
I thought gf was a perk
---
He should be added as a survivor, and that could be his line when he joins in.
---
Slow matchmaking for killer anyone?
---
Apparently not to OP
---
or when the opposite happens and they cleanse haunted grounds while you're in a chase
---
i try not to be such a tryhard as killer during the bloodhunt 
---
i played one wraith game for a daily and let survivors stun me easily, get some flashlight saves or left them slugged so they could get picked up again, while i got back to checking gens. i let the remaining nea open a gate to leave too but she stayed and gave herself to the entity.
---
Ok so I'm not gonna take up for survivors complaining about him being op but I will say this, where was this attitude when killers complained about Decisive and MoM? The same thing could be said about those. Please don't think that I think Ghostface is OP because I haven't played against him yet considering I'm on PS4 but still my point stands
---
Not calling him op, I've just noticed that the reveal mechanic isn't very responsive.
---
I've seen survivors staring straight at him to break his power, and it either didn't work till 4/5 seconds after or he just got exposed on them and downed them before they could break it.
---
I feel it needs some adjustments/fixes. Either make it more responsive or make the exposed charge meter tick down after a while if he doesn't pop it on the survivor.
---
And then when a character hits level 50 and still doesn't have the right perks...
---
Are yall really that unaware of what happens during dbl blood points? Everyone is trying to play killer you get more points as killer. So theres more killers queuing up compared to survivors queuing up...
---
Oh do us all a huge favor stop bringing ebony moris during the event. Its really stupid, the point is to get more points not to end the game quick.. camping and tunneling are super frowned upon during the event also.. let everyone get points...
---
Being invisible sounds really cool, plus if you don‚Äôt want to see anybody one day, all you‚Äôd have to do is stay still.
---
That sounds pretty sweet but seeing as you can also unlock Cosmetics with Shards I just don‚Äôt see it happening :/
---
Damn! I haven‚Äôt had a streamer on any of my webs in weeks! Wish I could get three, I would pass the BBQ-chili up for those!
---
Stay at green ranks, red and purple ranks are a shit hole of tryhard killers and baby survivors urban evasioning around the perimeter of the map for the whole game. I'm at rank 10 and I'm actually having fun for the first time in a while.
---
Naw, she's obviously not paying any attention because I have no trouble hearing gen repair sounds and I play on a TV no headphones. Must've had tunnel vision on the lockers.
---
Sounds like a you problem
---
Idk, I feel like his stealth is much better.
---
Doesn't need to use Monitor &amp; Abuse/Dead rabbit to have good stealth, he has no terror radius in his power by default, doesn't start the game super slow, can turn off his red stain in chase, has an easier time getting a stalk off on a survivor. I'd say he's better.
---
I wish they show it was an ebony mori from the get go.. so I can close app.. ebony moris take the fun out of the game and I'd rather move on to a match where the killer is being a try hard..
---
This one was too painful RIP THE BOYS
---
&gt;Sounds like a you problem
---
How so? Farming is boring on its on and even worse when people don't know how. 
---
How is it my problem when people don't want to play boring matches?
---
I'm afraid of something happening and i already see streamers do, people seem to stalk until they are one tap away and activate Night shroud when they are behind that survivor to immediately down them .
---
i think that shouldn't happen but idk maybe people will not do it i know for certain that i won't. at least if not every GF i face does
---
I tried it once and couldn't figure out how it worked. I just seemed to teleport around randomly? I tried facing the one I wanted but that didn't seem to work either.
---
I will answer his one...
---
Do you see any Dragons Flying around?
---
It will happen
---
Because you dont like it and people are farming? How is that an everyone else problem?
---
Just git gud, it was easily dodge able...
---
Could be a jiang shi, but I guess those are more like zombies.
---
I can‚Äôt seem to find any lobbies at the moment period...
---
He does it very frequently
---
i like using trapper just to trap those pesky doors and pretty much win if it comes down to they needing to open a door
---
Bulk buy them and then resell to the cosplayers here
---
People are just salty but you technically don‚Äôt need to cleanse if you‚Äôre good at chases and winning them but many people don‚Äôt cleanse so they can‚Äôt get hit with her vomit ability because if it becomes corrupt you will take damage when she vomits on you. I‚Äôm pretty sure most people don‚Äôt cleanse as to 1 not alert her of your presence and 2 not let her get an advantage on people.
---
Make instaheals require being hooked twice and then we'll talk.
---
it's not about that . I've already got into an argument with someone .
---
they want the center of your screen to be on his face . but that isn't how people play, people usually have what they look at higher than center because this game is a 3rd person view game which makes looking in the center like looking directly at the back of your character
---
I manage to find them within 3-5 minutes on PC
---
Yeah. I just logged in and I can‚Äôt find a match.
---
This is why I can‚Äôt wait for dedicated servers, so they can deal with the people who constantly quit
---
The trap will turn from red to white, that's how you know you're locked onto the right one. Also you can still teleport normally with Mint Rag, just with unlimited range.
---
If someone pops a trap, you will still go to that trap when you hit the button. If you face an armed trap in the distance and it turns white, you will go to it when you hit the button.
---
Ghostface because i've always wanted to be able to crouch
---
They introduced a new feature called endgame collapse. Once the exit gate is opened or the hatch is closed, a timer starts counting down. The hatch was already closed in this clip, so the collapse started. Once the timer runs out any remaining survivors die.
---
It would be scary and fun if Michael kept jumping on you but most of them just camp with that 0 tr :/
---
Only T1 Michael (sometimes Wraith or a mentally unstable Billy) would burn this map offering so if the killer burnt it just turn up your volume, pay attention to Michael's breathing and stay close to the outer wall.
---
Well first of all, a child probably posted that salty message on your steam profile because only children take this game that seriously.  
---
  
---
To answer your question, from what I know it's best to not use the fountain because otherwise it allows Plague to use the corrupt purge, which is like a damn gun in this game. It's so long distance and really hard to counter. Lol. When I play, I try to avoid cleansing (for this reason) and just try to get gens done as quickly as possible so we can all get the hell out. That being said, I was at rank 8 before the recent reset and there were plenty of rank 6, 7, and 8 players using the fountains to cleanse so it all just comes down to play style. It's no big deal either way, man - enjoy the game. :)
---
I‚Äôve gotten 4Ks so easily because of this perk as the pig and boy do I love it at times. Not all the time but a lot of times *boy* does it come in handy
---
Then they won that particular chase. 
---
You can interrupt the jump animation if they're in the very beginnings of the jump by closing hatch because it takes precedence. If they're already half way through then you can't grab them. 
---
It's effectively stopped most hatch standoffs (for the most part....people are still dicks sometimes) and keeping the grab would've been counterproductive to what they were fixing. 
---
I personally like the way they've changed hatch as both killer and survivor. It works a lot better than before.
---
Wow
---
you are baby you can‚Äôt be bully
---
Probably not enough survivors online, happens to me on PS4 during the morning hours before generally 2 pm
---
Honestly I think they should just change the bloodweb blood point rates rather then alter the data sets already set up in matchmaking, and we all know how long matchmaking already takes. Essentially if I'm playing during the BH it's not even predictable, just obvious, I'm running BBQ&amp;C or like 90% of killers under r10 will be until 2-3. So that's distortion and an immediate advantage, in the 2x bp event. Even if you don't run it a merciless game with doctor would yield you ~40-50k with no offering. I agree^with^you. We definitely need more offerings too, honestly I feel like the Dev's aren't focusing on the life blood of their game which is getting blood points to level up, a little more consistency in gaining levels **would be nice considering if you get all wins every time you play you shouldn't only gain roughly 10 levels for your killer bc you average 40-50k in a normal game.** Why isn't survivor pudding better than party streamers and like wise for escape cake? You want to help the enemy? Ha. Feels like I'm wasting my time ironically, yet some how I consider myself good. Funny.
---
Lord Chloroform. Cool coat, cooler name.
---
Yeah this is why i stopped using ds cuz i felt i had to do this to make use of it
---
Did the same thing to me on PS4. The wraith hit me AS he was uncloaking. I‚Äôd assumed it was a bug because he did it multiple times so I just got out of the game.
---
&gt;Because you dont like it and people are farming? How is that an everyone else problem?
---
Read again, please. I don't mind if people are farming, as long as they don't force me to and if the killer comes for me, I will play normally by looping. If survivors try to help him out, they are working with the killer and thats reportable. God helps them if the killer kills me while they unhook me in front of him.
---
Just use spine chill lol
---
Loop the billy lol
---
*Gotcha bitch*
---
Completely off topic, but wouldn't it be hilarious if Dead meat did a kill count on this?
---
Dude scratch marks are fucked, I so often find myself going the wrong way because the scratch marks led that way only for them to stop and me to get angry.
---
As a survivor main I 100% agree gen completion time needs to be increased. Any competent survivor squad will have multiple gens done by the time you get your first hook
---
In my experience, most vampires are from Louisiana.
---
&gt;You read again. You are pissy people are farming and youll report them.
---
Guess you can't read, then. Unfortunate.
---
Just quit. Find a game more your pace. And come back after reset. Don't waste everyone else's time and pips because you only want to face sub Rank 12 survivors.
---
I agree gens should be harder to rush. High rank is all about playing the meta and right now the meta is to take NOED as killer to counter the gen rush... and as survivor it's to use exhaustion perks and MoM. One is an attempt to counter the other, the meta should be disrupted via changes in balance to both sides. It's a game pacing problem at the core.
---
As for camping itself... You gain bonus bloodpoints if things are done while you're in a chase. If you're hooked, you're no longer a distraction unless the killer chooses to make you one themselves, which is no action of yours, and thus no bonus points should be awarded. Dying on the first hook probably does suck, but unless it's for literally facecamping then it's not bad behavior.. read on.
---
I typically softcamp, depending on the situation and nearby gens. There are tactical benefits to being *nearby* if there's nearby gens or what have you - but there's no real benefit to being RIGHT ON TOP OF THEM.  You can deny a couple gens, make going for the unhook a risk for survivors if you patrol the 2 closest gens, for example. This is **fine** and tactically wise, especially if you, say, hook them next to a generator - you basically deny them one generator and a survivor for the duration.
---
Standing on them guarantees a kill, but the rest of the time the survivors are *completely unopposed*. This is **stupid**. Killers get a penalty for this as it is, and even if they don't, the penalty is that they'll usually only get one kill out of it. It's far more effective to chase down others or try to bait people into going for unhooks than to just.. stand there.
---
It‚Äôs nearly 5pm in England still no lobbies on PS4
---
Nah, in my experience it‚Äôs more ‚ÄúHow does that not hit?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWtf that pallet shouldn‚Äôt have stunned me‚Äù
---
Obviously most of those are supposed to happen and I‚Äôm just a salty bastard
---
You could try restarting your game and switching your role to see if you get a game
---
That font is hideous.

All the non-movie characters can be obtained by paying with the game currency, which is obtained for free only while you play

Unfortunately I have and no games for killer or survivor. Do you think it‚Äôs the servers or?
---
Girlfriend üôè
---
Not being antagonistic or defensive, your post itself was defensive, i am just here pointing out the obvious that the tag 'shitpost' is not a magical shield that makes you free and protected from criticism.
---
im guessing you and other dickheads downvoted me go fucking hang yourselves
---
It's a bit better than most games. Most games just put you back with the same skill rating or rank. Then those players bitch about being stuck in the wrong tier.
---
You can't do that in this game lol. After rank reset we all mix and you can tell when you're playing with higher killer/survivor. It removes any illusions that im better than a certain rank. And its only for a few days. I usually learn the most in this time
---
Killers have to wait 5ish minutes to even create a lobby. That's not because it's double blood points and more people are playing killer, it's because they changed matchmaking again. However, trying to queue up as a solo survivor in rank 11 takes even longer for me, so where are all these killers?
---
Could definitely be PS4 or DBD but I haven‚Äôt gotten on today especially because for me it‚Äôs only 11:54 am
---
Excuse me
---
true, true, but it is very obviously facetious, so go off I guess
---
Looks freaking amazing!
---
I‚Äôll try again later  I guess
---
This has been happening for the past week now, it can take up to ten minutes to even find a lobby as killer.
---
I've made a point to get rancor unlocked on all my killers just for these dumb dailies.  Then even if it takes a few games, at least I didnt waste any offerings for it.
---
A good solution would be to halve the price of everything but them. That way it's easier to progress, but they are still as expensive in an absolute sense, and twice as expensive in a relative sense, so you gotta really want to play an Ebony Mori game for it to be worth it.
---
actually the reveal meter doesn't reset . I've noticed that because some GF tried to do it to me . you can notice the reveal music continues until its done and he's revealed
---
"toxic" = you started up the game.
---
Just farm 4Head
---
I don‚Äôt think there is any solution to slow the progression of gens or facecamping without a complete overhaul of the game. Gens and face camping are quite literally a core part of this game. Mess with gens and killers become OP, mess with camping or tunneling and survivors have a whole new dynamic to work a killer over.
---
Honestly, they‚Äôd be better off adding a whole new game mode and experimenting on that rather than messing with the OG DBD.
---
Very very long queue times. Coupled with mixing Bloodhunt &amp; Rank Reset on the same week, and returning after a few weeks of being too busy to play = Having a really bad time today, lol
---

I use a wired 360 pad for survivor and m&amp;k for killer. This is the 3rd pad I've been through, dbd has proven that the shoulder buttons are cheap as shit and are always the first to stop working. My only problem is having to point the camera at a specific spot at a pallet to heal and not accidentally throw the pallet, but otherwise it's good for me.
---
That is why I always run Franklins
---
I agree, the rank reset really shouldn't put red ranks all the way down to green/yellow ranks.
---
It‚Äôs pride weekend here on the west coast, not having crossplay also doesn‚Äôt help those numbers for active users depending on platform.  Survivor Q‚Äôs on ps4 have been 5 minutes or less for me all morning and I‚Äôve been working grave, just killer lobbies have been slow since event
---
Well, first of all, the idea behind this was partly because a conversation I was having with a survivor in an aftergame chat, he was telling me the legion is the least scary killer, that he looks like just some junkie trying to mug you. My brother agreed to that. That mixed with the whole "I don't know why legion is here" and my liking for those impish creatures gave me this idea.
---
The face is supposed to be a mix of the 4 masks, the shape is kinda skull like and it has this thing (is beard  the correct word for reptile like skin?) on the chin to represent Joey's mask, the grin and eyes from Frank/Julie's and a scar to represent Susie. Altough I kinda like how it looks without it, also had ideas to make it like his head was cracking open and light coming out of it, any opinion on this?
---
The weapons: my first choice is it's claw. but if that is not possible, maybe a dagger made of bone, about the color I am also not sure, it might be just bone color, or with blood on it, or a dark glowing red.
---
Or it can be a screwdriver, to be more gremlin like.
---
About name, I also don't have anything in mind. Maybe Gremlin legion or Imp Legion.
---
description: If you look deeper, you can see what the entity saw on them...
---
Bone dagger: Made from the leg bone of a King (David King that's it).
---
Screwdriver: Let's sabotage those survivors' organs!
---
Claw: This makes it more personal.
---
Body: A dark reptile like skinned fiend.
---
Head: Now we are one!
---
Lery's = DC
---
I guess you don‚Äôt get it because That‚Äôs what his power is intended to do hit multiple survivors but Guess what? They are never together!
---
what a waste of streamers
---
*goes to space because this is an old patch
---
Driving me nuts, my trapper is my BP farmer since I have bbq and chili at 3 and then all my other perks at 3 also while I P3 everyone else and it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt take advantage of this event because of these times lol
---
I was playing last night against a Legion and he was chasing down a Nea. I got in the way to let the Nea escape only to find out the Legion had NOED. In the post game he said "I had no intention of using NOED This game, but the guy was tbagging at the gate, so he deserved it" Never once did I crouch/tbag... I think some killers just assume survivors are tbagging without strategy.
---
Who‚Äôs teachable is prove thyself
---
Double Tryhard Weekend.
---
Devs said no more exclusives
---
Why does your game look so crisp? I play on ultra and yours looks better
---
I would counter that trapper is one of the only killers who makes me play much different as a survivor. Not knowing where the traps are can be stressful.
---
So you usually do good ... if you‚Äôre good? Lol
---
This was before the event so no.
---
We‚Äôll Make It, We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever, Probe Thyself, and Plunderer‚Äôs
---
its not worth running that addon anymore anyway the green one only increases mend time SLIGHTLY
---
Dank overload imminent. Evacuate all Pepe's immediately.
---
Dwight's
---
People who get cartoons mixed up with hentai.  But I suppose that is also educational.
---
I guess I didn‚Äôt double pip then.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not reading that
---
Mm that sucks, I use wglf when killer lobbies are no go like that. If you can dedicate some serious time you can definitely get some serious BP grinding over these events with the perks you could potentially farm 100k+ a match but I‚Äôm averaging 80k or less atm
---
Thanks for sharing :) at least I know I‚Äôm not alone lol
---
That‚Äôs strange then. My last match last night I walked out of the place with 120K for a 10 min game. Probably less than that.    You just gotta know what you‚Äôre doing.
---
Thanks for letting me know!
---
Ah that sucks I was looking for ways to slow down the game just a little bit for this bloodhunt. I guess Ruin and high pressure will have to do haha xD
---
I‚Äôm running Bond, We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever, Prove Thyself, and then playing around with Small Game and Plunderer‚Äôs.
---
Not sprint burst, but dead hard. My ideal perk build is Borrowed time, Adrenaline, Dead hard, and then something else like DS. Dead hard, DS and adrenaline are all to save yourself, and BT to save someone else. Dead hard can make you run loops better, adrenaline can make you heal a healstate instantly. DS can save you from Tunnelers. You do a gen at 44 seconds with 2 people and 80 seconds with 1 person. Prove thyself basically only makes up for that little difference. I could definitely see a purpose to your build, I just always like having dead hard...
---
Is the title a reference from naruto?
---
The quote sounds oddly familiar
---
I would think that she would wreck her tendons first doing that
---
Usually it is. If they switch window, and then vault it again, it will say it is blocked, but it isn't.

I haven‚Äôt got David‚Äôs or Dwight teachables what do I do
---
Yeah
---
That makes sense, I‚Äôll have to try incorporating dead hard in my build sometime, thanks for the tip
---
You still get BPs lol
---
In my defense the killer was face camping the other last survivor
---
It could work, there is a lot of variety as to how they could implement it.
---
Bite a survivor to spread the curse, if they don't bite another survivor they will wither away and fall into the dying state. Biting an afflicted survivor removes the curse entirely while biting a non afflicted only spreads it.
---
Or the vampire has to feed, if they don't feed for a long time they go into an insatiable hunger, gaining movement speed or lunge range.
---
Its so much potential and doesn't have to be the typical bread and butter were used to with vampires
---
&gt;mentally unstable Billy
---
Can confirm, an mentally unstable
---
You forget the main reason why people play: fun
---
wait, so who is the one that can hide and appear quickly? to reveal or to stalk ? I'm confused
---
Yeah, now that he works people are saying he's op, such an Indecisive community we're in.
---
r/meirl
---
You think so ? I  failed to mention their would be a some sort of give away. Like he would have the locker slightly opened and his mask would peak out.
---
It‚Äôs so fucking boring to farm
---
I usually play a bit of both. As killer, I play Freddy or Huntress, and they are both really fun killers! (also, Freddy in rank 5, is not as bad as people say it is.) I am excited for the rework!
---
I'm not just gonna go to you to kill me, if i pick up the hint then we'll farm
---
Well getting salt is part of being a cheap killer. I always tell my freinds, you don‚Äôt want the messages, don‚Äôt camp or tunnel
---
Ghostface is slightly weak on PTB: SHIT KILLER WORSE THAN FREDDY OMEGALUL
---
Ghostface is buffed slightly: OMG BHVR SO KILLER SIDED IMPOSSIBLE KILLER TOO OP
---
Switch out plunderers for for BT,if kiler is camping it's good and if ya need to got the safe hook rescue
---
Lol no getting salt messages is a result of mentally ill people who can‚Äôt control their rage issues tbh. I just lmao every time I get one. Let‚Äôs the salt pour in baby üßÇüßÇüßÇ
---
Yep. You use to set down a trap do they either save the hooked survivor and trap them self‚Äôs, or it flip flops. If you disarmed the trap, most often trapper would b-line towards the hook.
---
Well, rank reset is usually a shit show....and double blood points are usually a shit show.
---
I have a problem that I'm not completely sure if it can be solved here, but I want to ask anyway.
---
Everytime after a match ends, the game freezes the moment I hit the "Leave" button. 
---
In other words, the game works perfectly in every aspect, except that I cannot return to the lobby after a match ends.
---
I need to close the game with the task manager and re-open it.
---
Does anyone know what may be causing this?
---
Any information helps.
---
Me: I brought Bloody Party Streamers so the Survivors should stick around for a full match, right?
---
Survivors DCing on first down: Observe.
---
Careful where you hide on the hills in Yamoaka.
---
Some of them have corners that you can fall into and get trapped.
---
Ah yes - double BP.  Where killers go to tryhard.  This game is broken as fuck.  Consider balancing the game toward survivors that are new - you might find that more people CONTINUE to play the game and ultimately purchase more DLCs and cosmetics.
---
Hey if you enjoy the countless messages then good on you, I just prefer to make the game entertaining and not have to clear out my messages every week
---
Wraith, I‚Äôm not 100% invisible so people can‚Äôt walk into me but I can still scare somebody **A DING DING DIIIING!**.   
---
Or Nurse, I know if would hurt every time I blink, but I wouldn‚Äôt do it often
---
bring them up to level 40. once you've done that the perk can appear in your bloodweb.
---
Sounds like he's perfect then
---
Taking forever to find a match on PS4
---
I'm glad to see "civil" disputes over Ghostface in the comments. Everyone take into consideration that Michael exists... Have a good time discussing about the Killer!
---
Freddy‚Äôs is going to be exciting, but I‚Äôm 100% a huntress main. Only reason she‚Äôs not prestige 3 is because I‚Äôm working to get all the perks
---
I don‚Äôt play cheaply though, so I‚Äôm not sure why ur trying to place the blame on me. I bounce from survivor to survivor and usually make sure I hook everyone before sacrificing anyone. Some people just can‚Äôt mentally handle getting dominated. Not sure how that‚Äôs my fault.
---
Don‚Äôt suggest survivor perk buffs or the killer mains might scream
---
He‚Äôs fine the way he currently is. I believe survivors just haven‚Äôt figured out how to properly look at him in order to cancel his stealth yet. Once they do that I‚Äôm sure some will stop bitching hopefully !
---
They said they were rolling out dedicated servers this summer, maybe that's it?
---
Hopefully or he‚Äôs worse than Freddy
---
Isn‚Äôt like 20% of his body supposed to be visible and in the center of your screen in order to cancel his stalk?
---
love it.. my favourite skin so far!!
---
Literally i constantly get farmed and shit after rank reset it‚Äôs so annoying
---
Little does he know blocking does not prevent you from matchmaking together in this game.
---
Survivors have to master keeping an eye on him whilst covering themselves, which means yes it's a game of peek-a-boo which is originally the intention of the devs. That's why it's so frustrating to see people complain that they get stalked and they can't reveal Ghostface. It's like keeping your eye on Michael around corners to make yourself impervious to being stalked with the addition of trying to "stalk" back. Which IMO is really well thought out and fun once you know where the dead zones are.
---
Yeah but if we could also give that killer fast movement speed for good map control - I think that would be the best.
---
Lmao people think he‚Äôs overpowered? Obviously they haven‚Äôt played the PTB lmao
---
Do you mean it'll have the entity spikes but not actually block it?
---
You could've told me this was in game, and I wouldve believed you
---
N word
---
Never happend btw just wanted to make the meme
---
Myers can do that and if they‚Äôre grouped together you basically get a free 4K, yet nobody finds him OP. At least with ghostface the exposed effect doesn‚Äôt go on every single survivor after only stalking the one
---
I can‚Äôt play either side on PS4 right now. Survivor gives me an internet error message after 5-10 minutes of searching and throws me back to the menu screen and as Killer it never loads me into a lobby, even after 10+ minutes, wtf.
---
Are survivors now complaining about him being OP? Jesus wept, this community.
---
Legion proved that survivors DCing and complaining will make new good killers a thing of the past sadly.
---
Yeah, they are saying he shouldn‚Äôt be able to stalk during chase
---
Probably never honestly. This is Behaviors main source of income and notoriety, besides death garden but it just got rereleased so only time will tell. 
---
Another point is they basically are king of the multiplayer horror online market with basically no competition. 
---
They own every major movie killer besides Jason and it will only get better throughout the years.
---
I‚Äôm sure this game will be here for a very long time and since the devs do original content the content will never stop. 
---
They also mentioned for this coming year they are in it for the long haul so the game will only get better but that takes time. 
---
They would be fools to stop adding content.
---
Yeah, sadly friend, but make posts, don‚Äôt give up, post posts about this
---
Same. It won‚Äôt find me a lobby as Survivor and as Killer it won‚Äôt even load me into my own lobby, like at all.
---
I use mouse for back-revs and Q&amp;E for anything else.
---
Same here
---
IIRC, I think they said they want to keep supporting the game for at *least* 5 more years. Of course that all depends on if players keep supporting the game. They can‚Äôt keep adding more content if players aren‚Äôt actively playing and purchasing the cosmetics and characters.
---
me too, and probably 60&amp; of the comunity
---
Hahahahah thanks!
---
Your tone and word usage (mentally dominated) signify that your the type of person prone to outbursts of anger and cheap tactics despite what you say. In the end this is a game and for your image of win to be ‚Äúmentally dominating‚Äù shows that you don‚Äôt handle losing well either
---
Unfortunately less than 3% of the killer playerbase plays like this.
---
That's why there's the peek-a-boo tactic both Survivors and Ghostface should take into account when playing, as long as the Survivors are hidden well from view and so is Ghostface it'll usually result in either a stalemate, Ghostface getting a better position, or the Survivor making a misplay and getting punished. I've been putting in the time in the PTB and people playing right now are starting to see counterable plays that work on revealing him. It's like the devs said, a version of hide and seek. I've played as both Ghostface and Survivor and can say for myself he's fun to play against and play as.
---
It's not like Doctor's particularly good at getting bloodpoints; almost any other killer can get as many bloodpoints and in much less time than he can.  
---
Just get a killer you're good at and use BBQ.
---
Practicing for her Mori
---
But would also make it completely uncountareble
---
Lol ye I was using a gag build that blocked people from dropping pallets
---
I always upvote these but there is far too many posts on here and they are kinda annoying now tbh. 
---
If anything they should be on the official forums. 
---
I am actually more survivor main recently and the killers have got it really difficult. 
---
We need more top tier killers to help the game evolve and bring more skill into the game
---
Not sure I believe your right though. From what I‚Äôve seen a lot of survivors try to do it on the run and fail giving him free stalk. Once they get a feel for it these notions of him being op will be put to rest. 
---
The only thing I could see the devs doing is lowering the amount of time you stay exposed from 45 to like 35 or something.
---
I would prefer they not but you never know.
---
Lol bro you need to go grab a juice box and take a nap. Why are you getting worked up over a meme post and trying to dissect my personality from it?? Lmao chill bruh.
---
how would a freaking ancient baseball bat come out of her hand? And we already have this kimono in the game.. but the mask is sick.. would love that to happen at one point :)
---
Complaining about new players not knowing things in game. That's a galaxy brain comment right there. But a few points;
---
-You don't need to cleanse the second you get a little sick, wait until broken status at the very least
---
-If you do need to cleanse, don't do it near gens being worked on, use fountains as far away as possible.
---
-If you are sick and she's chasing you, she turns into an m1 killer and you can just keep looping her provided you don't mess up.
---
I think posting it in the [LFG sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/dbdLFG/) will be better.
---
r/inclusiveor
---
Hey it is what it is, sounds like I got a little to close and struck a nerve though lmao
---
The thing is with Legion he was generally unfun to play against because he broke all the rules of the chase. 
---
With ghost face theirs actually counter play and perks that make his power useless or incredibly hard to use. 
---
SWF will Generally destroy GF if they are on coms running anti stalk perks.
---
I believe he‚Äôs fine people just  need to be aware of their surroundings and work together.
---
When MoM doesn‚Äôt protect against pig traps
---
What do you mean what?
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt need nerf
---
Rule 2 unrelated content
---
What about the pigs nerf? Or the Freddy nerfs? Yes he's finally getting fixed and deservedly so. 
---
There has been many killer nerfs over the last 12 months. Yes there has been lots of survivor nerfs too but if you got the skill you can still have fun in the game. Are you a survivor main? Also do you play as killer at all? Just interested in how your making your opinion that's all.
---
Relatable meme
---
I mean who reposting cosmetics? I like never see, notice, or acknowledge if it does happen.
---
Fun fact: it‚Äôs also happening on PC. I‚Äôll have to wait in the killer lobby for 10 mins or so before it ‚Äúfinds a match‚Äù
---
I can‚Äôt find any games for either roles, what bs BhVR pull your shit together god, so sick of this bs trash Canadian company....
---
I hate user created stuff usually but that‚Äôs pretty dope.
---
Farming is boring as shit dude, why wouldn't I use the event for encouragement to play the game and actually find enjoyable experiences instead?
---
Yeah I hated legion but mostly cause I don‚Äôt even like to play as him, he was annoying too but he wasn‚Äôt top tier
---
Damn, same for me! PS4 too, do you know why?
---
Exactly but yet I graduate their will be survivors mains who don‚Äôt want to put in the work to be vigilant and complain he is OP.
---
GF is high mid tier which is good
---
or you get moried in 3 games in a row haha
---
It‚Äôs just a reminder for people, since I see cosmetics posted daily. People tend to repost stuff they see from other platforms and don‚Äôt credit or ask which sucks for artists. It‚Äôs happened to me plenty of times.
---
Heheheh awesome!!
---
Most definitely
---
Yep seen my first plague today after months of nothing. Nothing but tunneling off hook.
---
I just want to get off WGLF to earn lots of blood points. Only issue is I can't count how many times someone has given up on the hook when I am about to rescue them, denying me my points.
---
\*enters locker\*  what do you mean, scared and unproductive?
---
We need more high tier killers ! 
---
I also think plague could be there if they would add on a harsher punishment for not cleansing.
---
W O K E
---
Show me a repost...
---
Awesome - you realize they just signed you up for 3 frozen loading screens, right?  And if you get into the game, the killer is going to be tryhard AF.
---
Seriously. I was hoping to farm but every killer wants to just play normal or tunnel/camp lol. Like, whatever, play how you want but... Farming! :(
---
Get ready for the downvotes. This sub hates anything slightly positive for survivors.
---
And why shouldnt we had fun instead? I don't care about bp, I'd just want to play
---
Not everything is a lag switch.
---
1.5 seconds, you are doing something wrong or that was maybe a bug, chill, for god's sake
---
What repost? I literally just said this is a friendly reminder so people don‚Äôt repost.
---
Ugh
---
Yeah I watched this go down several times with streamers.  Don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôd fix it aside from putting a crosshair in the center of your screen after a second of seeing him.
---
But that would take away from his stealthiness
---
Every game though.He can just stay at a loop crouch up and down and not be able to get him out of his power.
---
Lol prime example on the top of the reddit page is someone saying it seems impossible to snap GF out of his power!
---
&gt; ‚ÄúHow does that not hit?‚Äù
---
because 50% of your other hits shouldn't have hit actually
---
1. Make Hex: Ruin a game objective and remove it as a perk (I'm sick on having to use it on every killer)
---
2. Make gens go faster if more people are working on it (instead of the other way around -&gt; punish solo survivors doing a gen ) - This would make more perks viable, more addons viable like the spawn addons (starting all survivors together or separated) and this would make survivors use different perks like bond to find teammates.
---
3. Make gens go faster for every dead survivor (face camping will double punish you 1. losing time and 2. faster gens after a secured kill)
---
4. Add more pallets or new mechanics favoring survivors to balance the changes above
---
You either have easily forgotten, or weren't around for, the days when being rank 1 would earn the prestigious rank 15 at reset.
---
Monitor and Abuse works with Infectious Fright and it's a powerful combo for Myers. For anyone else, not too much.
---
I think there are addons that affect how close you have to be to him too
---
you can crouch too at the other side of the loop I guess
---

You fool, you fell victim to one of the classic blunders!*
---
S^Susie
---
bro I still hate how amanda died in saw she was such a good character
---
Yeah i‚Äôd just force close the app if I see a secret offering during double BP.
---
Is rank 0 the highest? Or is it rank 1?
---
Takes a while.
---
- The Hag
---
yeah i was gonna say, maybe only if they make a DBD2
---
Infinite loops. That person earned it.
---
the title could have been way better
---
Let‚Äôs be honest most of the Susie fans would be damn happy if she wore *nothing*
---
Yeah there has been a lot of other issues that I've not mentioned. I'm not saying the changes were right or wrong I just gave you more examples of nerfs to killers. 
---
I play more as survivor now and have done for a while but that's because of waiting times on PS4. 
---
I will be honest I can't remember off the top of my head the changes to killers as time has gone on as I only started playing just as the pig was released. I am aware there are lots of people who have played longer than I have and have seen more changes throughout the game changing ect. 
---
The end game collapse is very easy to counter Aswell as you can just wait for the killer to close the hatch and you can wait by a gate. 
---
There is a counter to every perk and styles of game play. 
---
As for losing pallets damn right that was a good move as it took no skill and 1 player could keep the killer busy for the whole game while gens got done. 
---
MOM does need nerfing and the perk itself is actually cool but team it up with dead hard and adrenaline and you can get so get out of jail free cards it's insane.
---
The buffs for devour hope, ruin and NOED. I really don't like to be honest but they are all easy countered too.
---
You lose every offering that you use
---
I beat mothafuckas with other mothafuckas
---
If that's the case, then they should at least wait until after the double bp event. Kind of sucks when you can't make the most of it because matchmaking is screwed :/
---
You always lose the offering, it is used at the beginning of the match :)
---
ps4 matchmaking is killing me as survivor and killer, ive been waiting 10-15 minutes on average to even be loaded into a lobby at this point. :/
---
Yet again I see PSN having issues, them guys need to get there shit together. Funny how Xbox has issues and for the last few days PSN has had issues. TY for the link... Hackers? Solar Flares? Unicorns? Not Getting Carl The Survivor?
---
Whether you die or live youll lose the offering but not whatever item you brought in
---
&gt;Consider balancing the game toward survivors that are new
---
This is how we get a killer thrown into the dumpster for about 2 years.
---
[A tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsz8dVXTsmQ)
---
If you play him properly yeah he really is. I was just using it as a example that survivors are controlling in what direction the game goes in
---
I think you forgot "against" somewhere in your sentence.
---
I had a game against the spirit that did the exact same thing. Hit me once, then again, then downed me. No noise, totally invisible, no music, nothing.
---
He was my first good killer idea back when game started.  He should leap on people (counts as injury) and start stabbing them with a timer where you need an ally to pull him off you or get grounded.
---
More fun is slamming that fucker closed
---
If the match starts, then you always lose the offering
---
End game collapse is basically a free 4k for the killer if they close hatch.  It is not "easily countered".  EGC is incredibly lopsided for killer dude come on.  Unless the doors are miles apart which they usually aren't they will interrupt you before you finish that handle.  Don't downplay the edge EGC gave killers.
---
I feel your pain. I'm in the same boat.
---
Also nice to see a survivor wait for me to be 32 meters away so the perk can even activate üò≠
---
Now I don't think Ghostface is perfectly fine as is as he can pop his ability off in a Chase and sure you might say oh Hillbilly and Myers can 1 shot But Ghostface is intended to be a stealth killer and meant to use his ability not in the chase but out of it and that's what the 45 second exposed effect is for because you stalk and get into to get exposed then get in a Chase, not just keep your stalk high walk up on you stalk you for a milisecond then down your ass. I just feel besides that he is fine but people can't just ignore the bullshit he can do right now as a stealth killer and this is coming from a killer main not a survivor player. If you feel I'm wrong then please go ahead and share your opinion.
---
yeah had 3 games today over 120k
---
Survivors got progressively worse since the game's release though.
---
Killers right now are now at their strongest they ever have been. Not saying it is a bad thing though. I just don't see "survivors" controlling in which direction the game goes.
---
You might just be on crack to say spirits low tier
---
Wish this would happen but never will with a company like BhVR
---
It should be tweaked a little but he does NOT deserve a nerf
---
What
---
it's fine if you just want to play the game. I think they mean that some killers deliberately get extra toxic, just because they want to ruin the enjoyment of the survivors at a time they were extra excited to play due to the event.   
---
Like it's fine to kill surivors, but it's kinda shitty to facecamp and that kinda stuff.
---
What makes nurse number 1 I haven‚Äôt played this game in awhile and I never played her seriously
---
Prayer beads and whatever add on that makes ever you faster in phase or quicker getting into phase. Perks surveillance, ruin, sloppy butcher and nurses calling. Sloppy can be changed to barbeque and chilli, make your choice, thantaphobia, haunted grounds, monitor and abuse, spirit fury and whatever the hell you feel like hahah
---
It looks like you‚Äôre supposed to use him like Michael while sneaking around like pig to position yourself,
---
I dont get what's with everyones obsession with a doll...its like does height and speed not play a roll anymore
---
I don‚Äôt know man, I‚Äôve burned a total of 8 bloody party streamers so far, survivors burnt some as well. ATLEAST 2 PEOPLE DC WHEN THE STREAMERS ARE BURNT. It‚Äôs a feelsbadman ;-; can‚Äôt even get the maximum outta them
---
__Lol ye I was using a gag build that blocked people from dropping pallets__
---
Still not OP, he‚Äôs like if pig and Myers has a baby.
---
Not to mention you never said he was op
---
Watched it before. Still can‚Äôt seem to get the stun.
---
Video unavailable
---
Or it is just broken and not working right.
---
Everyday we stray further from good content on this subreddit.
---
Untrue, you can always know when you're revealing him by the sound
---
Survivors got worse when I started playing survivor. I suck big time. Haha.
---
Survivors can boycot games with no issues at all if they don't like a killer then they can just DC they lose a pip and then start again.  It's why I can't wait for dedicated servers. Killers can't avoid invisible Claudette's as the whole game gets stopped. It's one of the reasons I think getting to rank 1 should be rewarded and that will stop DCing in general and let the developers decide what happens in the game.
---
[I don't know](https://imgur.com/a/GKg76OE)
---
that's strange
---
Ghostface best waifu owo
---
We didn't even get the new killer in Playstation and people wanna nerf already
---
Honestly, some people are upset about this but I think this is absolutely hilarious. I hope someone does this to the Teletubbies in 20 years but tells nobody that it's a horror movie lmao.
---
No, because she doesn't go through pallets or windows and she's blind when using her power, so she's easy to juke.
---
Because they at least get to move on to a new game and don‚Äôt have to babysit a killer having a tantrum.
---
2x BP weekends always kinda bring out the worst in people.
---
He‚Äôs far from m1, I guess I shouldn‚Äôt take it to seriously from someone called itsmeclaudette
---
Traps don't work when she puts it after the gens are powered. If there's still 1 gen then you gotta take it off.
---
Prayer Beads is objectively an overpowered add-on.
---
I know haha but against a baby spirit its unneeded
---
This man just told him to get a juice box LMAO I'm done
---
yeah
---
Lol if they're Nurse, Spirit or Billy the distance doesn't even matter.  The old system was insanely survivor sided for hatch standoff now it just flipped the other way.  I don't know that they can balance it.  But yeah I'd support opposite door spawns.  Would give them a chance against the other killers at least.
---
Doing a gen and blinking is a standard thing in this game. How would you bring Chuky in? He is a small doll, he can't hit us, there fore he can't kill us. There is no way he works without being bigger thus not Chucky or everyone being smaller thus not Chucky.
---
You don't know about that gag build
---
Jesus Christ the killer persecution complex in this chat. Legion was changed because he was exploit ridden to fuck. Survivor dc against him because of five minutes gens and moon walking where bs. I haven‚Äôt played the new ghost face and I‚Äôm not making a comment on that.
---
Ideally that'd be the case, but as it is the buffer comes before every instance of the meter being filled.
---
LMAO
---
The mending aspect was created to slow the game down, that's why they added it for other things too like borrowed time
---
I don‚Äôt really mind the ping, unless it‚Äôs really bad, so it‚Äôs normally 100ms or more. I‚Äôll try it on lower ping I guess.
---
The zone/hitbox for the reveal is too tight, if you saw the clip I've posted the Feng was staring at him directly while he was stalking her, and she wasn't revealing him at all.
---
Legion was a pain in the ass, but ghostface doesn‚Äôt need nerf, he‚Äôs fine
---
Yo that new wraith buff has maybe him high tier
---
Ash is listed as a chapter, just like Ghostface.
---
Unless you're facing Franklin's Demise.
---
This meme. I do not think it means what you think it means.
---
I swear to hell and back, they increase the spawnrate of BPS in bloodwebs for these events.
---
It was gona continue you could have 1 killer and 10 survivors.
---
The survivors compete to see who can teabag the most
---
i'd recommend verifying the game files, have you tried that already?
---
Ngl that's a bad argument against him "He can't hit us". What's stopping him from having the ability to jump at us? What's stopping him from just slashing at out legs to down us? Maybe like the legion he can have multiple slashes.
---
Ah. Riiiiight. 
---
Someone said you‚Äôre probably pretty low rank and I think I believe it. Spirit is a powerhouse. 
---
I‚Äôm really curious as to how you got nurse #1 as well if you‚Äôre low rank. I assume you took that advice from other players.
---
Are you on ps4? I‚Äôve been having the same issue. There just aren‚Äôt a lot of people playing survivor ig so games are hard to come by
---
Yeah it has flipped completely. But at the same time survivors can now get out the hatch without doing a single generator and that's just messed up haha. 
---
We went miles off topic with this one though. 
---
Do you think ghostface is ok as he is right now? I've not played as him as I'm on PS4 So I can only go from opinions or streamers.
---
Except in this peek-a-boo interaction only one side benefits.
---
If you read the dev. messages I've posted in my other message, you'll see that there is a short buffer before the reveal meter starts filling up. 
---
GF can use that buffer to prevent the meter from filling up. At the same time, the stalk meter doesn't have a buffer, so in this peek a boo interaction one side gets the stalk off while the other side isn't able to reveal GF.
---
Waited 35 minutes on PS4, then gave up.
---
All the pissed spirits mains lol
---
If the choice is between downing someone in one hit or two, why wouldn‚Äôt you take the weaker target?  Especially if you know they don‚Äôt have a second chance perk. Picking appropriate targets is a skill killers have to learn.
---
Personally, I think ghostface is fine the way he is but the issue is, survivors will be looking DIRECTLY AT HIM for the entire stall duration and it won‚Äôt knock him out of it. I‚Äôve watched people do it in KYF matches and it‚Äôs honestly ridiculous that they fixed the issue of him not being able to use the power and made it so people can‚Äôt knock him out of the power. If they fix that and find a middle ground, I don‚Äôt really think anything should change. I‚Äôd honestly put ghostface below Myers
---
Farming is boring. I'm fine with earning my bloodpoints by playing a real match.
---
You could also get a very fast vault from going at any angle. Pallets were also everywhere, and there was 2 windows at the jungles. Bloodlust wasn‚Äôt a thing also.
---
I wasn‚Äôt implying I was pro-Chucky. I was just bringing you a reminder that if they were to bring him to the game, they‚Äôd definitely find a way for him to do all the things the current roster of Killers do. 
---
The Entity does as he pleases.
---
Your completely right
---
Love the attention to detail! Such a good job :D
---
I heard they only got the rights to the mask. You know it not even the killer from the movies, it some original killer
---
Not sure if it belongs here, but on pc way back when I first started playing, the game would give you tips during the loading screen including which killer you were about to face. So you always knew which killer you'd be going against. I just bought the game on Xbox so I could play it when I'm too tired to go to my office and the Xbox tells you tips against the killer you're about to face. It completely ruins the surprise factor/jump scare and you always know what to expect. It's a lame feature and it would be great if that could get removed from Xbox the way it was removed from pc.
---
Everyone is playing killer to farm blood points. Survivor solo quest is quite a bit faster right atm
---
l2p
---
The bloodhunt started yesterday and it seems like most people looking to farm are playing killers so wait times have gone up a ton. I waited close to 30 minutes earlier for a match. Sometimes it‚Äôs quicker but it‚Äôs definitely not consistent.
---
Really? Damn. Was really hoping it would be Billy or Mickey
---
The matchup is already fair tho
---
Crybaby survivors don't want challenges they want ducking easy bullyable weak killers - __-... They still gonna and the devs are gonna NERF him again or how they say "adjust"...
---
Yes please! I was sold on the faces alone but dear god that weapon just makes it too solid!
---
camper
---
I swear if the devs buckle under the pressure of survivors complaining about ghost face I‚Äôm officially going to say Deathgarden is better. This happened with Plague and now she is mediocre. Plague was so close to being a good killer and I swear the devs better wait a week after release before considering any changes.
---
This shit is so bad haha
---
I am saying until the devs reach that point people must stop suggesting this on a daily basis.
---
It takes 3 seconds to reveal him
---
Tbf some people have tried to advocate for making billy a 110% killer so I‚Äôm pretty sure those type of people just want to make it so all killers are weak.
---
DBD is currently the 16th most played game on steam with around 33k playing. Normally its around 20k but we got the event so longer wait times.
---
Yes and that whole time a sound is playing
---
Lol I just worked out a full vampire killer power with addons yesterday
---
Yeah it sucks man, Ghost face could be up there in Low A tier or high B tier but will stay there for a week before going to c or d
---
You've clearly never gone against a Doctor on Gideon Meat Plant.
---
A Jungle Gym that has walls made of pallets
---
Getting farmed off hook by another teammate with no control over it = incompetence. 
---
Ummm okay. I always punish the rescuer but you do you. I have over 700+ hours in this game and have received ZERO hate messages.
---
imagine watching monto
---
I want him to be up where Myers is and he isn‚Äôt OP like come on I‚Äôve been waiting since spirit for a good killer
---
Yeah, chaser feels like the hardest category to fill...
---
Yeah the reveal mechanism is the only issue I have with him. If it worked as intended I‚Äôd probably put him below Myers, but that‚Äôs probably because my play style as killer in general doesn‚Äôt really blend well with his ability and how it works. Definitely gonna play the fuck out of his regardless though üòÇ
---
You got me there, I‚Äôm always seeing those posts about Chucky as well.
---
Yes I do play on ps4. That might be why thank you!
---
Do as your wish, I never blame killers for coming after me once unhooked but, my Mettle of Man (until the 18th) and Decisive Strike have two cents to say to that.
---
A letter to killers: Don't complain if more people start using DS and ask devs to nerf it even further, you have the option to go for the unhooker.
---
Ps4 - Yesterday late afternoon/early I found matches as the killer pretty quick. So far today I've waiting for 5-10m,a few times, and nothing. I switched to survivor and found a match within a minute.
---
I would give BHVR almost any amount of money for this.
---
Bear Jesus &gt; Shirtless Myers
---
BHVR pls
---
I very much agree, I Think they found a good balance that makes him effective but not broken.
---
Stories that never happened cuz (a) noone cleanses Dulls and (b) every kille has Noed
---
Downvote me to hell
---
I know right. Lol #notmyghostface
---
I feel the same way if they nerf to many aspects of his kit or nerf him at all he‚Äôll drop down to a low tier killer which I don‚Äôt think he deserves.
---
Should've M1'd more. It is counter productive but, its the only way to get Iridescent Chaser. 
---
You can even mentally count it. As soon as you hit the threshold, finish off the survivors.
---
Distressing, overcharge, huntresses, overwhelming, game map offering is the bad one
---
If you do wanna use M+O, do it with calm add one, sneak up on survs in punishment mode, switch to treatment mode in chases.
---
IKR,please don‚Äôt nerf
---
I think hes fine where he is. Even if hes strong so what? We need more strong kilelrs that can survive high ranks that just not billy and nurse.
---
For the record i dont think that, he has no map pressure, game slow down, chase potetional, or anything else.
---
He shouldn't be able to do the same thing Myers does?
---
Why?
---
He still moves slower. Ghostface is perfecty fine your just bad. He has NO way to end a chase faster. He has 0 map pressure or moblity. He has no game slow down. He has no way to acuallty hit you after you expose someone. 
---
And what if hes strong? Why aren't killers allowed to have strong killers that arent nurse and billy over and over?
---
We all know it‚Äôs gonna happen. They‚Äôve shown a severe S&amp;M relationship with the toxic portion of the survivor fan base, and BHVR is the masochist.
---
Oof, that -1% proximity to hooked survivor was literally the differnece
---
Exactly. Why would I not advance my win condition because your team made a bad play?
---
Survivors, do you stop doing generators when you see the Killer get pallet stunned or miss because someone faked a vault? No, you don't. And why would you? Generators are your win condition, so you take every advantage you can to complete them.
---
bloodpoints yo
---
I thought vampires came from space
---
S: Freddy and Doc  
---
A: Bing bong  
---
B: Ya boi trapper  
---
E: veryone else  
---
F: Uck Pig
---
I wish I wouldn't get farmed by other survivors. Got unhooked several times even though the killer was basically right beside me. Without Borrowed Time. 
---
Why you do this? WGLF doesn't even activate if I immediately get knocked down again.

---
You literally just proved his post right with this response.
---
I know its difficult to reveal him, but there's nothing stopping Billy's saw or Spirit's phasing. Be grateful survivors have any power to stop it at all.
---
I dont get the complaints about the isntadown. Billy, LF, Myers and even Plague all have way easier to use, more often, isntadowns and get more to their powers then Ghost has. 
---
Ghost has no mobilty, pressure, slowdown or chase. Plague has  PEMENET for the entire game instadown yet shes weak and i dont see people bitching about that. 
---
And hes a stealth killer? So is Myers. Should myers lose his 99% progress bar too?
---
I think it‚Äôs because a cell phone would likely malfunction more due to no internet. But that wouldn‚Äôt affect photos.
---
I know right ?
---
I love this build. I bet the other Survivor was like wtf is going on.
---
I‚Äôm too lazy to write so I‚Äôll just Sunday I agree with that entire comment
---
*A stranger suddenly enters your voicechat*
---
**Boi.**
---
If it makes you feel any better this Killer doesn't tunnel, camp, or BM but if I spot your friend running to your rescue I AM returning to hit whoever it closest to me.
---
Ouch, the triple trap face camp
---
And why is that bad? Why cant we have a strong killer? Why is Billy and LF ok to have easier and more powerful insta downs? Why can plague have a perment instadown for the entire game and be consdered on the weaker end?
---
That was the whole point of the post :(
---
The primary difference though is their abilities in loops. A tier 3 Myers can end a loop significantly faster than any other killer in the game (besides nurse) due to his insane lunge distance, speed, and vaulting. Not to mention this applies to every single survivor, meaning you do not have to instigate any delay the second you spot a survivor.
---
I agree
---
replace monitor with overcharge and ur good
---
It's to much complicated, since the base of the game is the loops and mind games, it would be a fucking stupid AI or a fucking stupid AI with hacks to compensate the stupidity. Also BHVR is not a really a master in programming, and every single game of th em is with pretty simple ( but functional testing IA for the type of the game) or multiplayer.
---
Thank you! :)
---
Maybe stop camping and you'll see how easy it is to avoid people complaining.
---
Especially with distressing. After like, 3 shocks, you‚Äôve got half your deviousness points
---
Not really waiting in a locker you have to wait for a surv to come. It wastes the killers time
---
I figured, but some of the other comments were trying to give you pointers on how to get more chaser points so I decided to draw more attention the the sliver that kept you from adept
---
I know, like 5 a day minimum. I much rather have people ask for more realistic killers or balancing suggestion.
---
Deserved
---
I like to play normally most of the time. I only farm if the other four players agree to it.
---
i use all of his skins but i love his red suit the most
---
It is if the only thing you use it for is blinding at pallets and clicking it endlessly at the killer when they decide to ignore you.
---
Only if we can get that annoying cliche ice cream truck music instead of a terror radius. :P 
---
I don‚Äôt play Doc so wouldn‚Äôt buy but I can see exactly what you‚Äôre saying and I really dig it.
---
No, because Huntress throw hatchets over pallets and windows and she also can hit you from afar, while Spirit is easy to juke because her power makes sounds without Prayer Beads.
---
Prayer Beads should be in Spirit's base kit, because she's very weak without them.
---
I know right! When that build works it is amazing!
---
There seems to be an issue or glitch with your ranking system for the past few months. Are you guys lazy back there? It seems only when I played with SWF I can get to red ranks easily. Otherwise, I‚Äôm stuck at rank 5 or 4. The payout still sucks. I‚Äôm going to keep posting until I give up. üòù
---
When yo girl still screaming after you did it.
---
why the fuck would you make a killer who has no guaranteed catch up potential in a chase 110% movement speed
---
Damn, those look amazing! great job! :D
---
You‚Äôve got it backwards. Running those perks isn‚Äôt salty. Salty/toxic players are more likely to run them, though.
---
We know
---
They technically do, but BPS don't give more than they do outside event.
---
a 20kBP game will give you + 100% (20k) for event and + 100% (20k) for a total 60kBP if you use BPS, NOT 80k like some people seem to believe.
---
Today i had problems playing killer,i couldn't create any room,but i could play survivor.When i try to play killer ot just says searching for a game.
---
I am playing on PS4
---
He‚Äôs fine the way he is.
---
Spirit: *teleports behind you*
---
Survivor: Nani the fuck
---
But since woodchucks can't chuck wood, what would a wood chuck do instead of chucking wood?
---
Nurse, Myers and Huntress: Pathetic.
---
How the hell is it that streamers get lobbies no issue but can‚Äôt even get one for one daily ?
---
Self Care + BK + We'll Make It = what's injured
---
I go up to pallets making sure survivors can hear or see and hit it a bunch, this usually works esp if I nod too
---
Because these type of people get bodied and complain instead of learning how to counter who and what they‚Äôre going against.
---
Wanna upvote but dint wanna waste the 69 upvotes
---
The devs are currently testing the new matchmaking system which is slated to be fully implemented upon the release of dedicated servers. The system involves creating the lobby after 4 survivors have been found to replicate how it would work with dedicated servers, so while there is a wait, just be patient and you will find a match shortly.
---
He‚Äôs perfectly fine with the changes they just made
---
It never feels consistent either. It says that you get awarded for short chases, but when I down the survivors after a twenty second chase I get bronze medal at the end of the match, but when I get looped for a few minutes during each chase I get an iridescent medal at the end of the match?
---
May have been me... XD
---
upvote this comment, keep the 69
---
I've actually never seen mad grit used in a productive way; this is great!
---
Honestly consider dc'ing every time that I get that map as Michael.
---
Nah he‚Äôs fine
---
This is what happens when survivor mains play killer
---
I doubt you ever play survivor.All I have to do as Ghostface is stalk them and they cannot snap me out of it.I chase people and they cannot snap me out of it.Maybe I am bad but every survivor is?
---
Adobe after effects.
---
yeah i too had games where the chase ende in like 5-10 seconds, didnt really feel awarded for it after the match tho
---
ok
---
Same feeling getting outplayed by a MoM survivor
---
I do play survivor. And he stalks you and exposes you then what? He gets looped, window juked, and locker juked for 45 seconds until it runs out. 
---
One hits dont do anything if you cant acaullty catch survivors. Why do you think Plague is so bad?
---
Then the survivors run iron will and then what?
---
Sorry but  we don't do "üòÇ" here, go back to instagram
---
I just Jumpscare people and leave lmao
---
# Surprise motherfucker !!!
---
As opposed to the other killers, Ghostface can sneak up on you and down you without you having been able to do much of anything against it.
---
But like I said, I do not mind these things that much in themselves. Indeed he should have a strong ability. It's simply that, for one thing, the change undermines the innate counter, which just seems like an oversight. And then I just don't find it very engaging an ability, and therefore don't care much for it. I'm not saying he should be nerfed, at all.
---
Wait... What was his buff?
---
Can she phase through pallets or through walls? Nope she can‚Äôt
---
Thank you so much &lt;3
---
Getting looped makes me want to kill people irl
---
Because the Japanese hopping vampires are more interesting than a Dracula copy.
---
This is why I stopped playing on console entirely. It was kinda nice to switch off and play it when friends came over, but it's not even worth it when you sit in queue so long. Considering I was already going from my 2300$ PC setup to a console, add in the fact that I could play 3 PC matches in the time console takes to play 1 and the final nail in the coffin was pounded in
---
If Ghostface manges to complety sneak up on you to down you while your exposed you got caught out. He still has to walk up to someone, and if they are exposed you wont be standing there. Not to mention he has the cloak sounds if hes too close. 
---
If anything, maybe its a b it too hard to break him out of the power. But survivors could just not be used to doing it yet.
---
To think nurse isn‚Äôt 1# is just plain stupid
---
To think spirit is anything other than top 3 is just plain stupid.
---
Besides the fact he's 3-feet tall and can't carry a survivor...
---
Let this die already
---
It works pretty well against Survive with Friends since people are usually REALLY altruistic :)
---
Making it exhaustion based doesn‚Äôt fix it. It still punishes killers (bad, M1 dependent killers) for doing what they are supposed to, injuring and killing survivors. The means to access the endurance buff need to be changed. Whether or not ‚Äúprotection hits‚Äù is a good means to access it, we may say as the devs have hinted at. 
---
And you lumped escapes in with delays, very different things. Escapes means the killer has lost you, relays mean the chase is still on. Even in an idea game, use adrenaline, dead hard, DS, and MoM aren‚Äôt all going to perfectly sync up for one survivor when they need it the most. It‚Äôs a fantasy for a survivor to get all their perks to work well in a game. 
---
DS isn‚Äôt really al that useful anymore, it‚Äôs kinda an ace up the sleeve at this point. Being mindful of someone who is off a hook will mean you almost never encounter it. Not to mention that virtually every killer benefits from enduring if you REALLY feel the need to be able to eat DS hits.
---
I‚Äôll be playing all weekend if I can help it and I‚Äôm usually a solo but if SWF queues get to a good point, I‚Äôm game. I think I‚Äôm Rank 11 with reset.
---
PSN: Wicked-Hardcorg
---
130 with legion is fairly easy and you don‚Äôt even need to kill everyone!
---
Dedicated servers means no more killer DC right?
---
You have to accept the EULA when you first launch the game, but there used to be a bug where it came up for players even with thousands of hours. When you 'Accept' the EULA you'd lose all your progress.
---
Restarting the game would not remove the EULA message and you had to accept it to play the game. Many players also lost legacy cosmetics because of this along with their hours and hours of progress.
---
The crouching perk is one of the very first the game had lol it's not new...
---
How is lampkin bad?
---
Exacalty. Its why Nurse, Billy, Huntress and Hag are consdered top tier because they can pretty much ignore loops or end them super fast. 
---
Ghostface has none of them.
---
That‚Äôs a lie,   You just did it.   I don‚Äôt hail from that land.
---
It is true that the game becomes much easier for survivors when playing with friends, and likewise, ranking up. This isn't an issue of the ranking system but an issue of game balance, one that's pretty difficult to solve. When you say "payout", are you referring to blood point gain when playing survivor? If so, there are reasons for the lower bp gain, such as how survivors can find items in the match and even keep them, whereas killers lose their add-ons 100% of the time.
---
I personally don't consider the game a win unless I escape, unless I'm with a team and the other 3 escape. 
---
I agree that survivors shouldn't be able to drag a killer out the entire game, but every down needs to be fair. 
---
You can't really counter NOED before the killer gets his 1st hit often enough to say it's truly counterable.
---
Maybe he does a "Drag n' YEET"
---
He basically has most of the positives of EW1 and EW3 Myers combined minus the increased lunge of EW3 with hardly any of the negatives. He doesn't move that slow while in stealth, still has basic lunge, he can't run out of stalk on survivors like Myers can, and he can easily hide his TR throughout the whole match very easily. I don't want any of that nerfed like I said, but something should change about the counterplay.
---
Looking at him takes too long to do and gives him enough time to stalk you like halfway before you pop him out of it, combine that with how the stalk never deteriorates and he can basically only ever have to insta down all survivors if he plays smart.
---
Sleeping, and still watching. That's some skill.
---
Screenshot of Admiral Bahroo scream for credit (if you couldn‚Äôt tell)
---
Like the on from The Ice Cream Man? If so then yes.
---
Thanks. that helps morale
---
My dude have you hear of our lord P I G? She can just dash around a corner at light speed if the survivor keeps looping, same with legion as long as you don‚Äôt have to rely on scratches for the chase.
---
Survivors hear me, if you tea-bag, it‚Äôs fucking prison rules time. All bets are off.
---
That's their testing code name for, darkness among us
---
You can catch survivors though.Its your fault you get window and locker juked not the killer himself.45 seconds is a lot of time.Plague is actually mid tier.
---
maybe perhaps looking at him also reduces the stalk he has on you? At a slower rate sure so he always has the advantage. It could be a sort of push n pull dynamic and will reward the survivor for getting the drop on him, idk just throwing out an idea.
---
The "sneaking up" bit is more about being able to 99% the stalk meter, in which case he doesn't need to get right on top of you, just close enough for a hit.
---
I have barely played with/against the updated Ghostface myself, so I'm definitely withholding judgment on any specifics, it's just that in concept these things seem a little odd.
---
Nerfing Nurse and Billy would result in a much more unhealthy game.
---
All hex perks are trash, especially Ruin.
---
People who complain the most about camping would still die constantly if nobody camped.
---
I think she‚Äôs strong to but I truthfully don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs the best killer in game she‚Äôs close but not the best in game
---
I wouldn't have even thought of that, how cool! Great job :)
---
Even Furtive Chase can be useful in specific circumstances. It'll allow you to have perfect stealth on Myers, even when in chases, as an example.
---
Oooo I like that idea
---
it's happened in the past as soon as I put "new player" my thread gets ignored and I don't get any friend requests
---
Maybe make a web for add-ons that change over time and gets better with level and prestige adds more slots,then for perks you can put bloodpoints and on levelup you get to choose a perk from between a few (based on need+power+level)
---
I love huntress, such an interesting character too, all she wants is a daughter
---
Thank you haha. I didn‚Äôt know that and thought it was VERY racist...
---
How dare they?
---
He'd be a survivor tho
---
He feels too much remorse to be a killer
---
imagine meg being the main survivor
---
But Michael, pig and freddy all have shards
---
Like others said, it‚Äôs pretty messed up. We all started as ‚Äúnoobs.‚Äù Yes, it can be frustrating at times to have potato teammates when you really want to win a particularly intense game but in the end, I‚Äôm happy we are getting more players and I really do think the community overall is quite positive. 
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and would be happen to show you the ropes of you were on PS as well. SWF queue times are just rotten right now.
---
I do think watching some videos will help a lot as well. I don‚Äôt mean that in a ‚Äúbrushing you off‚Äù kinda way, it‚Äôs just sometimes easier to see how experienced players handle different situations when you‚Äôre not in that stressful intense environment yourself. HybridPanda is one of the more entertaining guys out there and he‚Äôs a real peach. Real good guy and occasionally make doofy mistakes (we all do it, even the DBD veterans) but he‚Äôs quick to reflect on them to his audience. (:
---
Swap Monitor with Distressing, Overwhelming with Unnerving, and Whispers for Overcharge. Stack Calm add ons and burn a Game offering.
---
I mean eventually they will have to, the heat death of the universe is an inevitability which can not be circumvented.
---
They don't
---
if they keep adding trash maps im gonna keep DCing 
---
ez
---
Psn ac__31
---
Do you have any with the red background too?
---
High quality holy shit that‚Äôs good
---
This is exactly why I'm pretty much coerced into playing killer to level my survivors and it bothers the shit out of me. You will NEVER see this many points as a survivor, ever.
---
Now some survivor mains just call themselves toxic when doing basic actions. like legit my friend was working on a gen while i was being chased and said  ‚Äúwe are so toxic‚Äù unironically
---
This is great, until you remember everyone is still disconnecting mid game
---
Most I ever got was 162,971 with the Spirit
---
Honestly? Just use backrevs for a while until you get the hang of the charge times and the hitbox on cancelling the dash. Everything else comes naturally once you have that down.
---
spooky! üíú
---
Damn people here are really good artists. Its a shame they cant put out all the skins you guys make
---
Yeah yeah, I know everyone just wants the Spirit video. But that's the next one, so calm down already.
---
As always, I appreciate constructive criticism on anything and everything in the video.
---
This game in a nutshell
---
Well i thought that horribly wrong
---
This game will be getting content for a long time, and probably a "sequel" for a rework on the framework for new possibilities
---
PC or console? I feel like you could get people to help out on here.
---
Oh cool! Thanks for letting me know.
---
Big difference between the killer being OP when functioning correctly, and concerns about the reveal mechanic not working.
---
Bloodhunts have always been filled with camping, tunneling, and people killing themselves on first hook. It's never fun
---
Spirit is the best killer ever!
---
Wrong, a killer that's power makes no sense, is pathetically boring and you can't even immerse yourself playing as him. He's a buffed Myers, you just stand there stalk and GG and you boost their exposed meter even when their exposed, and you can't even break him out.
---
Yeah hop into a closet before you get hit to keep your item if you are going against franklins
---
They might change that. Unfortunately new players can't look behind them while running.
---
NOED is the equivalent of how mettle of man was
---
&gt; technically do
---
Ahhh.  Technically correct.  The best kind of correct.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs not him, it‚Äôs them not looking behind them. But at the same time some people look behind them and it doesn‚Äôt deactivate it so?
---
I think that would destroy the perk.... it's one of the few perks I like to use and it only activates every few games since I don't play SWF I usually get sacrificed before it activates or go against killers who can instadown.  I don't think the perk needs to be nerfed but it is frustrating against SWF teams that all run it and can communicate with each other. Maybe apply the nerf only to games with SWF teams. Calling out killer locations, letting each other know where you are, where totems and items are located...it's a completely different game than a bunch of solo survivors trying to guess what everyone is doing
---
Sadly true for both sides.  Lol at Killer bringing a Party Streamer then wanting to tubnel &amp; camp everyone... Survivors bringing in Toolboxes to Rush Gens faster aye aye...
---
I came to comment that that this is me as the killer I‚Äôm pretty sure and yeah I got the game like a week ago.
---
Again, why is it bad he can 99% someone excalty?
---
Thank you very much for the advice!
---
I thought Jeff‚Äôs arm was just Laurie with a thicc ass
---
You cant. In a chase, ghostface has 0 tools to get past loops, catch up with survivors. He still eats pallets, still gets stunned.
---
And again, Ghostface cant.
---
Yea but you do realize there aren't always closets nearby? :D
---
She‚Äôs second best behind Nurse because of how hard it is to loop her.

Very old news u get them by killing the 4 basic survivors 25 times each

I love you 2 Rob-kun\~XOXO

Current Rule Set No.2 part of her base kid, all addons reworked exept from like the good 20% and increased Oink speed(crouch). Do that and Pig can move up like 4 places and be the 4th best killer. Just give my goddess some love BHVR.
---
it sucks because I'm on Xbox and there's barely anyone on my platform most play on PS4 and PC, Having nobody to play with sucks
---
I am confused
---
But interested 
---
Meg seems to be enjoying her position beneath Myers.
---
ACTIVATED
---
If this is on Xbox there‚Äôs a high likelihood this is me,
---
Meg sure seems happy to have her boob flattened into a pancake.
---
I get games no problem. Dude it‚Äôs your Nat type. You‚Äôre the host. If people see bad ping they won‚Äôt join. If you get the 3 person glitch leave and start a new lobby. I instantly get lobbies as killer and in a game within a minute of that. Use a wired connection make sure your Nat type is on open. It‚Äôs not the games fault. Yes it is because they use the killer as host rather than dedicated servers but your internet is not their problem.
---
Is this a troll post? You already can close the hatch.
---
We aren‚Äôt trying to make a second Myers.
---
But .. you already can close the hatch during EGC...
---
Shitpost or have you not played in the last month? In case you have not, the killer has been able to close the hatch a little over a month now.
---
I‚Äôm just explaining how we could improve his design
---
*smirks in small game*
---
Xbox but I tried in the past and got no help the LFG reddit and discord are toxic and trash
---
I don‚Äôt think so. That‚Äôs how I say hello to other survivors that spawn next to me and one survivor got mad I did it and messaged me so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Yea the lack of a catch up mechanic does suck
---
Ghostfaces power is supposed to be used when he‚Äôs not seen.
---
I‚Äôm explaining how he could fit this design better
---
We aren‚Äôt making a second Myers
---
to be fair, devs were going with realism. You don't need acceleration to hop over a window like that. You DO need acceleration to throw yourself over a pallet as fast as survivors do. And traps can technically be put all over each other. I don't think they predicted that the game would get popular and they would have to start balancing around game play instead of realism.
---
Naw man, masochist can take the pain and hate, BHVR is more of a chuck desperate to please the toxic side of the community.
---
The game is not entirely sided with the killer or Survivor. It is perfectly balanced in different rights and everyone should stop complaining about it.
---
And? Myers is supposed to be the same is he not?
---
Camera, but it has to be centered on him for the duration. If they break LoS for too long, such as to check their path forward, the progress will reset. There's also a start-up time that has to be completed before he'll even start being broken out.
---
Exaclty. There is a reaosn only 4 killers are viable at like rank 1.
---
i wish people would blind me at pallets instead of running away
---
Lol he got banned. I do like the idea of a vampire killer though.
---
*increased oink speed* I love it
---
I will be sending this on Ps4. I thank you
---
Realistically that would make sense
---
They can feel free to separate the "good player" rating and the "fun game" rating. Rank is attempting to do, and failing at, both right now.
---
I give it a couple months before they nerf him for the baby survivors. I can almost see the piles of salt now.
---
Eh, I message ppl on PS4 and clearly state my intentions as killer and they still act like autistic tryhards most of the time.
---
Not really sure how to make ppl understand we ALL win if we work together. Ppl are just too selfish.
---
That would be extremely hype. would Vigo be a survivor then?
---
Don‚Äôt forget that you could only unhook from the front as well so facecamping was super easy to do
---
I literally said leave if there‚Äôs 3 people for longer than 2 minutes... it‚Äôs not my fault or the games fault you‚Äôre dumb enough to sit there for hours ü§îüôÉ
---
Good job! I legit think it's one of the best killer cosmetics, right behind ghostfaces devil outfit.
---
I got the Plague Adept yesterday, two of them were only hooked twice.
---
they are waiting for dedicated servers to punish dc
---
Was I killer or survivor?
---
At the end of the day it's 1v4. You do whatever you have to to kill them all. There's nothing saying you have to play by these fairyland rules. If your team mate makes a mistake so be it. Let them cry those salty tears.
---
He should have been behind the injured person so the killer would have no choice but to hit him. 
---
This was an awful save attempt.
---
"non-gameplay scenarios that Myers does" it's called strategy, the killer stalked you for a good time without you noticing, if you failed to notice him it's your fault ( or of your teammates in myers case) so instead of losing 10 seconds of his power to just get to you, and lose more being looped, he used his brain to get the most of his power, you can still see him coming for you in tier 2, you still can loop him. If he sneaked to you and popped ew3 it's your fault.
---
I'm aware.
---
My best is just a lil shy of 120k
---
Farming isn‚Äôt fun for players who actually want to play the game so that‚Äôs why most people don‚Äôt want to do it. It wastes time and takes forever. I understand you just want bloodpoints but honestly you‚Äôd probably get more faster by just playing the games through so you get more games
---
Bloodhunts bring out the Bloodcu-
---
If you‚Äôre actually good at playing Killer just go easy on them. 2 hook everyone then start smacking them and letting them get away. That way it‚Äôs not as monotonous as straight up farming and you still get to play the game.
---
Honestly? Iron maiden is generally pretty bad, mostly because survivors generally don't use lockers once you're past about rank 13 or so. However, survivor breathing gets louder when they're in lockers, and if they were wounded, you'll see a puddle of blood in front of the doors. If you want to make double-sure you'll hear them, Stridor is situationally useful, since it makes all survivor breathing and vocals louder. Can occasionally be useful for blind tracking.
---
Fucking meg mains
---
I lose my items/add ons when I dc
---
Iron maiden is kind of good on huntress and doctor. Maybe high mobility killers for people who counter bbq but that‚Äôs to stressed. I would!‚Äôt suggest you using iron maiden on legion. You should use enduring+spirit fury+hex:ruin+ bbq chilli.
---
Send away my friend
---
Yeah not sure why people are down voting you lol
---
I've been waiting up to 15 minutes just to start a lobby on Xbox :')
---
Trolling.
---
Lmfao actually it is the games fault and you must be pretty dumb if you think that helps at all. You spend like 5 minutes waiting in queue to even get a lobby so obviously you should give up on the lobby after 2 minutes and then wait in another 5 minute queue to make a new lobby? And if you weren't illiterate you'd have read my post that i did this THREE TIMES and got the lobby bug each time where only 3 people would join and never a 4th player. So who is dumb now? Idiot read before you comment and insult people.
---
Not only when I am killer but when I am Claudette as well
---
Usually if the killer intends on taking you to the hatch then they‚Äôll know before they knock you down. Best way to communicate that is don‚Äôt wiggle while on shoulder
---
Oh man, that's wicked. I genuinely wish they had kept these offerings in so that we could get proper, atmospheric games. Everything is just so bright now, and it makes it so hard to properly surprise someone if they're paying attention.
---
Yep, waited about 15 minutes to start lobby, got survivors the 3 dc's in the first 2 minutes haha
---
Didn‚Äôt you post this 11 days ago
---
Gg ez baby survivor
---
Hit the bertical ... on the top right and hit "Community Info"
---
No. Isnt myers supposed to be a stealth killer is my point. Why should GF not be the same as Myers?
---
Isn‚Äôt wiggling more total points for both of us though?

I find Billy incredibly fun to play and play against, yes, and base-Nurse to extents.
---
I feel the best thing to do would be to hit the person that got unhooked and leave him on the ground, then go after the person that unhooked the other survivor. That eay, youre not punishing the poor lad that was unhooked, instead you cause the impatient person recieve an unsafe hook rescue, which makes him lose points.
---
r/iamveryrandom
---
Ahahahahahha you must be fun at parties, maybe you have a shadow ban because you are definitely a toxic player. And it does fix it I rarely get the 3 person glitch and when I do I leave and requeue and I find a lobby straight away and survivors join instantly. You‚Äôre just stupid if you complain about this but still sit in the lobby even tho it‚Äôs bugged üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ stop playing if you don‚Äôt enjoy it ya fucking idiot no one cares about your issue because its already widely known and you bitching about it won‚Äôt change that so sit in your bugged lobby all you want or find something more enjoyable and productive
---
I did I went back to survivor no issues there. I love this game I just hate how it‚Äôs still broken and shitty after being out for like three years now.

Me: \*reads list\*

The title has a typo and the dude is just making fun out of it.
---
these events are pretty rare. I think the minority that dont like the BPs can get over a few farming games...
---
But ghostface isn‚Äôt weak
---
The majoriy of the comminty.
---
Why EVERYTIME U KILLERS CRY U GET BUFFED THERES A REASON THERES NOBODY PLAYING ANYMORE WHO WATS TO PLAY U NERF SPRINT BURST BECAUSE WE WERE FASTER FOR 3 SECONDS U NERFED BORROW TIME WHICH PUNISHED TUNNELING AND FACE. CAMPING MEANWHILE KILLERS GET PERKS BBQ AND CHILLI ... NURSES CALLING ...HEX RUIN.FIRE UP. ..I FORGGET NAME OF LAST ONE BUT ITS WHEN U CAN KNOW WHRE SURVIVORS ARE IF THEY ARE DOUBLE TEAMIN GEN... THERES SO MUCH MORE YOU KILLERS GET THAT WHY WOULD ANY SURVIVORS PLAY OH DONT FORGET YOU TOOK AWAY DECISIVE STRIKE
---
My killer matches were almost instant up until the bloodhunt started yesterday. 
---
EU PS4 killer just hangs on finding a match without even putting me into a lobby alone. 
---
I guess a lot of people are playing killer for the extra bloodpoints as my survivor games are twice as fast now. 
---
Before bloodhunt survivor was a 10-20 minute wait for a lobby sometimes.
---
At least you‚Äôre getting practice hitting your ruin skill checks. 
---
Pretty soon you won‚Äôt care if the killer has ruin
---
Still. Nurse has very little counterplay compared to every other killer. What about Instadown Huntress? Billy with a insta saw.
---
Carrying a downed survivor and hitting a gen with them on your back is the clearest message. Letting people go as Legion is kinda how a lot of people play legion (getting everyone into mend)
---
Especially after EGC
---
Do you mean the Ultra Rare background for the Perks? I don't have any variations of those atm.
---
Yeah I'm having this hella annoying problem too and ik for a fact it's not my NAT type or my ping is bad because I have never had this problem in the past and have played so many games normally before with no lag, I literally sit on the searching for matching thing for a solid 5 min before even being put into a lobby to THEN wait for survivors to join. It's really irritating.
---
Very true, I feel like I can hit great checks kind of consistently but when I see the red bar I‚Äôm like OH GOD
---
Damn this community is making a lot of great skins.
---
It's 2x BP weekend and that's free points
---
*OINK*
---
Camping is not toxic , it called securing a kill
---
She‚Äôs licensed so I‚Äôd say probably not
---
Oink train incoming.
---
i mean spirit is s / a tier sooo
---
Read the post title
---
Either oinkers or the Myers. I'm one of both
---
Most certainly OINK.
---
*Survivor mains who got Freddy nerfed before release hated that.*
---
Entity: BISH YOU THOUGHT!!!
---
Pig's might tunnel. Myers might always have tier 3 when he sees me. But we are the best mains there are.
---
No. They dont see the circle until they become exposed. Decetion is just camara based.
---
aw someone's having a little tantrum üò¢üò¢üò¢
---
That's kind of shitty
---
there's 4 of you and 1 of me so no
---
I use BBQ, Nurses, Enduring, and distressing (only for the BP event) I ussually run M&amp;A
---
Interesting read.  Any ideas yourself on how to balance the game so that the top ranks aren‚Äôt reliant on 2 mobility killers?
---
How is his power not interactive it litrely is only stopped by looking at him.  Thats pretty interactive
---
I was being nice.
---
Same thing that happened to Freddy... it's like repeating history all over again
---
By the same merit, a fully charged Billy can end a loop as fast as Myers.
---
Myers is not always in tier 3 and some Myers take all match to get to tier 3.
---
Ghostface's loop power is Pig's. You *cannot* tell what a Spirit is doing.
---
I main Pig but what are you talking about ? if you mean small loops that you can finish with any other killer then yes she can finish it faster but that's it
---
* You‚Äôre
---
Its what I've found to work best for me. Only problem is if the survivors arent SWF they mightnt all get the message.
---
Dude how is it tantrum if its facts and if your killer main your tantrums happen first cuz yall were trash and couldnt kill survivors so yh
---
Bad bait is bad.
---
There's nothing in his kit that makes him OP.
---
Oh God oh man
---
Oh God oh man OH GOD OH MAN OH GOD OH MAN OH GOD OH MAN OH GOD OH MAN
---
I've only been playing dead by daylight since the end of April but alright
---
So unlocking a survivor/killer automatically puts their perks in all bloodwebs? That would help cut down the grind to 30/35/40 for characters you‚Äôre not interested in, at least.
---
For survivors it isn‚Äôt as big of a deal. They‚Äôre just cosmetics and I‚Äôm ok with playing whatever character I get luckier with on the bloodweb. Killers is where this really matters because they have unique abilities.
---
11 survivor was a 6 before the reset
---
Those who don't learn from their mistakes are doomed to repeat them.
---
Wat
---
The Entity got them before they could finish whinging. :(
---
Really sorry to hear your problem. 
---
The community has some amazing people in it but unfortunately there are a big number of arseholes that just want to ruin the experience for everyone else. 
---
Trust me you‚Äôre not missing out by not playing with those people. 
---
Keep trying and you will find people who have the same mindset as you, don‚Äôt be disheartened!
---
In the meantime solo survivor isn‚Äôt bad and you will quickly rank up. 
---
Once you get out of lower ranks solo survivors get a lot more reliable and you will have an easier time finding people to team up with. 
---
You could also try and find other players in a similar situation to yourself; team up and learn together :)
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure DbD was added to Xbox gamepass recently or very soon, so you should be able to find other newer players to party up with &lt;3
---
Depends, he‚Äôs a vampire and kills to feed his thirst. I killed quite a lot people in my PlayThrough though they weren‚Äôt necessarily good people or healthy.
---
The LF that camped me didn't accept my friend request :(
---
You'll need to purchase her from the store as a cosmetic.
---
That is probably the only counter-claim I agree with, I can see how it's cheap and if they change anything it should be that but only that, also I'm aware of the Breaking of his power is difficult for some but I and many others are finding ways that I believe were the intended ways of knocking him out. Will leave you info when this method is more fleshed out.
---
U also run faster than all of us combined youve got perks that prevent co op so yh
---
No killers at high ranks use Noed, you use a perk that helps you kill them before the gates are powered instead.
---
__Bad bait is bad.__
---
Lol you said Fire Up!  This has to be bait
---
Lol this guy üòÇ!
---
Nah man screw the people who don't play the game and just hide the whole time. It could be any character that a player picks that can just do nothing the whole game.
---
Nice.üëå
---
Great, goes along perfectly with [this Mettle Of Man icon!](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b9ffqa/suggestion_update_the_mettle_of_man_icon_to_this/?st=jwxyzc7c&amp;sh=dfa5c070)
---
Am I the only one who thinks that Freddy is decent how he is right now. He isn't the strongest but it is easy to get 4ks still.
---
NOED on scratched mirror michael isn‚Äôt too bad, but why the hell people would run it on normal is just weird to me
---
Maybe not all clowns a bit thicc for the lockers
---
Now this, this is big brain thinking right here.
---
Seriously that could be a great inclusion.
---
That is the definition of a stereotypical Claudette main
---
But then he goes behind something for a second and peeks out again, resetting your "spot timer" and progressing the non-decaying stalk meter, meaning that looking at him is nothing but a minor inconvenience to him, in that scenario.
---
I had actually posted a rework suggestion before they announced the PTB changes, and in my version looking at him would simply stop the stalk, but not break him out of his ability. That way it would actually be interactive, and crucially, be so in chases, as well. I know he can kind of stalk mid-chase now, but mostly again by cheesing detection. My version would be about actual interaction.
---
Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, and an Exhaustion Perk or 2. You can try to get the perks if you want but those are the best ones to get imo.
---
I mean, he kind of is an m1 killer
---
It‚Äôs actually a tantrum because you think killers are to strong when they aren‚Äôt only nurse is but she can‚Äôt be touched without nerfing her into the ground and this is coming from someone who plays both killer and survivor
---
Wrong perk
---
500 cells for the outfit or is it 400?
---
Eh as a a old Claudette main who's starting to Branch out I've done the gennies and ran the killer. I still feel like it comes down to the player overall.
---
We got ourselves a 1000 iq armchair psychologist over here
---
i mean i can only say i found it hard to reveal him. Dont mean he needs fixing though. Rather have a scary killer than a weak one
---
Really? Not like anyone's running that perk anyways.
---
Boys we stopped racism
---
Yeah that's not how it works, you obviously don't play killer, because you know that you always get hate message no matter how you play
---
No you‚Äôre not.  
---
OP is upvoted for recommending Gen times be increased by 50%.  I recommend increasing gen time, and balancing the mobility killers and get down votes.
---
I see them doing something with his detection. Seeing how it‚Äôs harder for survivors to get him out his power now. With newer players it‚Äôs not GF problem if they don‚Äôt look behind them to get him out of his power. But I do see them doing something about how much or what the survivors need to look at while in a chase to get him out of his power. Legion is not a good example because he was riddled with other things that just was fun for the survivors. After his rework a good legion can destroy you. And I feel the same with this. I haven‚Äôt played with gf and I‚Äôm super excited to when he comes out. But he is a stealth killer. It‚Äôs in his nature. Stop being so fucking salty because you suck at a stealth game....git gud.
---
Very awesome! Do you have hatchets? Do you hum when you wear this cosplay?
---
The trick to get survivors in this situation (but with only 1 trap) was for someone to start the disarm trap animation whilst the other survivor unhooked! Although you couldn't really do anything if the killer was hard camping.
---
I'd die laughing playing against that, he wouldn't even have to chase me, I'd laugh so hard I wouldn't be able to control the keyboard
---
Yea the survivor needs to hide and not just sit there. Of course killers are gonna have the advantage if you stand there staring back at them.
---
I‚Äôm all fine with tweaks as long as it doesn‚Äôt hurt his performance
---
Endgame doesn't complete all the generators so no. It does activate perks that say once the exit gates are powered though.
---
Nope
---
Well, you can just buff the bad killers.. Killers that don't have mobility should have stronger powers.
---
I use it, it helps you get closer, and when it‚Äôs active it expands your killer instinct, it helps him in every way
---
As it stands now you can be running in a straight line looking back the entire time and can't get him out of stalk.
---
Its busted rn
---
Gotchu
---
I haven‚Äôt been playing the game as much and I did forget that there was a rank reset. During a Double BP event on the weekend of Father‚Äôs Day.
---
Guess I‚Äôll die.
---
Ruin is so easy to work through though.
---
NIED
---
outplayed.
---
The killer main streamers and YouTuber's are calling it OP. Its probably a little broken
---
A stereotype does not necessarily apply to all Claudette mains, i. Do not doubt that you‚Äôre not one of those
---
Yes but she was in plain sight, people behind cover can usually break him out before he truly knows where they're at. And I've had this happen to me a multitude amount of times today where either I playing as Ghostface or Playing against him where if I (survivor) hid behind a wall and Ghostface kept leaning over to try and stalk me he couldn't and I'd break him out whilst vice versa when playing him it's pretty easy to be revealed in higher ranks I've noticed. The dead zone to revealing him is just a tad wonky but once you find it (it's near the top of the survivors head) and for better reference it's near the right shoulder or slightly above depending on which survivor you're playing as and since I play Ash it's near his right ear. The best reference is think whenever you use a flashlight where you aim towards and where the flashlight lands. With that in mind stare directly at the center mass of GF and it should be a lot easier to reveal the spooky specter.
---
That's the entire point of the public test build. To figure out balance and bugs
---
Say that again and I'll make this STBFL useless.
---
I guess. If its really a problem, why not just increase the buffer timer to reset the decetion timer? So it lasts much longer without resetting making it easier to take him out of it? 
---
Heck, maybe you could even make the person who revealed ghostface reset progress on the stalk?
---
thank you! I was running Discordance, Noed, Sloppy butcher and ruin.
---
might take down noed and see, most of the times since i only play in low ranks since im casual (15 and worse) the game never actualy goes to the point where they get all the gens.
---
Borrowed Time (Bill), Decisive (Laurie), Balanced Landing (Nea), Iron Will (Jake)
---
The killer wants points too. You guys clearly didn't let her get much.
---
You get more points for staying in chase and hitting people than you do for sacrifices.
---
If you think that the camping or tunneling are the only reasons for salt messages as a killer then you must not play a lot of killer or either you lucky and don‚Äôt go against survivors with the brain of a 5 year-old
---
You're only at like 70%, so those last 2 gens both popped within 30 seconds of you getting hooked.
---
Maybe when he's inside of it the locker door can be ajar'd even though he doesn't stalk. His belly would make sure that it can never close fully.
---
Or me lol I just purchased his DLC and he‚Äôs super fun to play
---
That‚Äôs the point. Don‚Äôt make him into a leather face or Freddy. Don‚Äôt nerf him to the ground and so he just isn‚Äôt a viable killer as some of the other ones.
---
The only person I watch who‚Äôs called it OP was No0b3 and I took it as sarcasm. Farmer John didn‚Äôt really seem to think he was OP either despite a few things he said that i don‚Äôt think were meant to be taken seriously, and Ohm was sorta just,, Ohm. (I feel most people who watch him know what I mean by that üòÇ)
---
Don‚Äôt really watch anybody else who plays DBD though so I mean if others are saying it it‚Äôs no wonder I haven‚Äôt picked up on anybody thinking that
---
Yeah it does seem op to be able to grab survivors so easily, especially on lery's where there are gens that have only one place the survivor can do the gen.
---
Honestly whats up with that, I just played with 3 face campers in a row
---
Hag, cause you never see anyone complain about her. And shes the cutest of everyone
---
Probably British
---
Fucking lmao
---
Didn‚Äôt they release an exclusive cosmetic for pc like a month after they said that though?
---
I think the killer instinct bubble on the one who spots you is a bit much, but other than that I think he's good
---
We don't balance a game around bad players, that results in poor game balance.
---
And yeah, its 2k around all ranks but nearer to the top ranks ppl will often be playing the top tier killers, which is why they should buff the weaker ones.
---
Not that ik of
---
I‚Äôve done some shady things to secure a kill before (tunneling mostly) and it‚Äôs always the worst when they‚Äôre nice about it
---
All the maps are free for everyone to play on. You don‚Äôt have to buy the map. And the killer you can also buy separately.
---
[also him](https://imgur.com/a/RxjzQ8g)
---
Haha good one
---
Maps are free, anyone can play on the game map, owning the dlc doesn't do anything regarding the map
---
Yeah, BP is what I am referring too. I have played two months as a survivor non stop and always have taken in an item and haven‚Äôt taken one out. When I run out, I just use BP to get more. It‚Äôs way more fun to play as a killer and knowing you are dominating. It just gets boring after a while. Surviving just has something that keeps me coming back. Maybe the pleasure to teabag ü§£üòÇ and hide.
---
Rip I tried playing with 2 new people last night and we got  doctor and pig needless to say I raged
---
The wraith had a bell /s
---
But he wasn‚Äôt god like, he was called god like since there was no heartbeat, and the meta back then was hiding instead of b-lining to a loop. So since he had no heartbeat, he would sneak up on people doing generators. Billy was consider to be the worst, which is actually opposite now. And trapper was meh at the time
---
I agree, the devs better not nerf him he is good as he is currently
---
Maybe I‚Äôm thinking of the death garden mask for meg?
---
Its all fun and games until the Franklins Demise comes out
---
In that case, I‚Äôve never come across it. Is it really that rare to get to play on that map, or do I just have bad luck?
---
yeah i traded it for M&amp;A now ty
---
Ah ya those that is a little weird since you can get it anytime by buying death garden and once it comes out on console we will prob get them as well
---
If you got to red ranks as a killer, you wouldn't be dominating and having nearly as much fun. I have 900 hours in the game, and if you never take items out as a survivor, I think you're not doing a very good job being a survivor.
---
I do not know if you get a discount when you buy the full DLC, in case someone who knows about it says no... You could buy she with auric cells, probably that's cheaper. By the way, I do not know if I understood what you said about the maps, but you do not have to buy any DLC to play on certain maps, all maps are always unlocked
---
u/title2imagebot
---
It‚Äôs totally randomized. There‚Äôs really no way to get a better chance aside from getting a jigsaw piece offering.
---
Aight, thank you. I‚Äôve just never gotten the chance to play on it then I suppose.
---
I dont know why but I equipped slippery meat when I downloaded the game and I'm so used to its extra attempts I feel naked without it even though it's pretty trash.
---
Why do I feel like this font is familiar
---
Can't tell but i stg its the Fortnite font
---
The tea bagging David makes the clip for me! üòÇ
---
Survivors and Killers,,majority are dunces/douchebags..the longer a match goes...with everyone getting hooked and whatbot.....means EVERYONE gets a ton of,points.  But nah, Survivors try really hard to push gens super fast and Killers wanting to camp and tunnel... Most of my Matches do alright, but the ones that don't are aggravating
---
Like let me queue up for farming players...its a 3 day event that is not consistent of when we get one...and people want to tryhard/sweat it
---
Alright, sorry for being unclear, either way you answered my question, thank you.
---
I haven't played as or against the new GF, does he get a longer lunge as well? Because EW3 Myers has an insanely distant lunge and Vault speed.
---
Yes, you can
---
Who knew! A stealth killer in a stealth game....
---
Interesting but I don't know if they should mess with Myers. He's already pretty good.
---
How do I do it though? I‚Äôm on console.
---
Only when the Endgame didn't started
---
Alright, guess I‚Äôll just have to keep playing then. Thanks for the info.
---
You‚Äôre high. 
---
I know this is your opinion, but your opinion isn‚Äôt very good. At least you got Nurse &amp; Billy right!
---
Billy already has a built in instadown, he doesn‚Äôt really
---
You can only open an exit gate when all gens are done and before survivors do it themselves.

---
Noob3's video literally demonstrates how busted it works now. Monto is also saying its busted.
---
If you've seen the gameplay then you would know its busted as it stands.
---
No he does not need any buffs
---
If you remove the stalking cap off Myers then one single dipshit on your team could give him tier 3 multiple times. Gonna take a hard pass on that.
---
&gt;Oh and also, it is broken but not OP.
---
Brokeness can cause something to be op. Say if a survivor's health is broken by not being able to take damage would also be OP.
---
Actually, A
---
I was gonna say
---
What do you mean week it wasn't ever funny
---
Not urban + sprint burst
---
We balance the game around all ability levels.  This isn‚Äôt an esport.  The game isn‚Äôt going to remain relevant if you balance around a handful of elite players.  
---
I‚Äôd like to find a solution to the red rank 2K average that is reliant on the mobility killers without unbalancing it for the majority of players.
---
Adrenelene, Balanced Landing, Mettle Of Man, Self Care.
---
Didn't you hear? Leatherface is the killer with the highest percentage of 4Ks in Rank 1, alongside Plague, Legion, and Freddy.
---
Too dumb,,too selfish, too tryhard and to egotistical.  Lot of this community feel they're proving something when playing this game.... As Ive said over and over...its a 3 day x2 BP event...knock it off with tryharding..we ALL win the grind game fer fuck's sake....if you cant handle/ do that...just play something else, because you're not winning anyone over with teabagging pallets and racing 3 Gens down at the beginning of the game...
---
Also seems people stopped using Party Streamers already....
---
It‚Äôs not supposed to be like this is the thing. The issue is the reveal not working, not his power itself. They just need to fix the reveal mechanics
---
Gonna try this after the other 2 lol
---
Lmao what? Sacrificing is kind of the point for the killer otherwise it wouldn‚Äôt be apart of the game or it wouldn‚Äôt have an emblem. Killers want to win too and sacrificing is how we do that, the same way escaping is how survivors win. Killers don‚Äôt win if everyone escapes..
---
Is it not fun when you succeed in escaping a killer who‚Äôs actually trying to sacrifice you? I want survivors/killers to outplay me not just hand over a win every game.
---
Also okay, so ranking up isn‚Äôt a good reason to sacrifice survivors? Well then I‚Äôm just doing it for the BP,  just trying to make as much as I can. That‚Äôs the point of the game, right?
---
Agreed
---
He does not gain any stat boost. Only makes one target exposed
---
Adrenaline, Dead hard, Balanced Landing, DS, Borrowed time (if you‚Äôre on pc)
---
nEa iSn'T A kIlLeR, sHe'S tHe EnTiTy
---
He showed how busted the reveal shit is. That doesn‚Äôt make ghostface himself OP. All they have to do is fix the reveal mechanics and change nothing else and he‚Äôd be fine.
---
If I‚Äôm chasing you and multiple gems pop, it‚Äôs on.
---
If you sand bag your teammates, it‚Äôs on.
---
If you stun me and point/teabag, it‚Äôs on.
---
If you just generally piss me off, it‚Äôs on.
---
The thing is that you shouldn‚Äôt be attempting escape anyways
---
You can open them as long as the end game hasn't already started. If survivors opened a gate, you wont be able to open the other one.
---
It‚Äôs like R1 or R2 I think
---
Could be worse, I did 3 gens, looped the killer for last 2 gens, unhooked and body blocked for my team and got one hooked because the rest of my team was already by the gate just waiting. The killer was a camping Bing Bing boy but still, rank reset and bloodhunt are terrible.
---
K, and?
---
Its still broken into being over powered.
---
‚ÄúNobody‚Äôs playing anymore‚Äù ü§£
---
Yeah, for me so far it's been three sweaty/salty Billies, one big brain Myers with NOED, and then a Huntress with Iridescent Head who could only land them on an immersed Dwight who crouched still.
---
I know right I'm just dumb if the killer is hovering and my teammates have gone to Neverland I just go for it. Terrible patience but it's how i like to play games.
---
Thanks :)
---
Yeah, it's basically worthless unless the whole team stacks Luck. 3 more attempts with 4% chance of success each is not worth using a perk slot on. Only very few perks are consistently worse than that.
---
On the other hand, now we have a good "self-unhook" variant in Adam's Deliverance, so those unwilling to trust their teammates always have a way.
---
Just make noed two hex kappa
---
I wish these posts existed about the overreaction of his state before his fixes and tweaks instead of all the shitty suggestions posted on this sub
---
&gt;He showed how busted the reveal shit is. That doesn‚Äôt make ghostface himself OP.
---
And having an infinite health bug wouldn't be op either by that logic.
---
&gt;It‚Äôs not the killer that‚Äôs OP but the mechanics not working as intended that makes him SEEM OP.
---
Yea he's broken into being overpowered. Nothing I've said contradicts this.
---
What, no gold? How incredibly selfish of you.
---
Does spine chill not help against prayer-beads spirit?
---
Yeah I'm levelling up my claudette and when I got her to level 41 I'll go back to david and replace slippery meat with self-care.
---
I agree with you but no need to be a dick to OP about it
---
It's the cycle I got put in the negatives for pointing out last week, killer comes out and everyone loses there shit about how week they are, BHVR buffs them and then everyone loses there shit about how OP they are.
---
Shame on BHVR for caving so quickly instead of letting killers get more acclimated to him.
---
You can apply this to a loop with low cover. Both of you can pop out and look at each other, but because of the buffer only GF is getting something out of it, because you are not making any progress on the reveal meter.
---
lol thats what i said
---
&gt;He does not gain any stat boost. Only makes one target exposed
---
He is able to lunge further and vault faster...
---
This is likely to go the way of legion as well, and they will end up totally changing his power over the summer. Or maybe more like Freddy and they will give him a new power, we can‚Äôt be sure yet
---
Yea. But not everyone has it on
---
I finally got a good group of 4 - they all walked out with 65k+ and I walked out with 85k, and that was with only 75% BBQ and 25% all categories.
---
Haddenfield Balcony - Home. At least it was before I fucked everything up.
---
&gt;Yes but she was in plain sight
---
You ignore that she was staring at him and it didn't even start to reveal him? I get that she gets exposed there, that's obvious, but she didn't even start revealing him while he could see her and she could see him.
---
&gt; it's pretty easy to be revealed in higher ranks I've noticed
---
There are no ranks on the ptb, I don't know what are you refering to here.
---
&gt;but because of the buffer only GF is getting something out of it
---
Yea, different killers require you to act differently.
---
Imagine looping a nurse teleporting, versus a hag trapping, or a leather face. What do you get out of looping meters around low cover.
---
Adapt or die.
---
an infinite health bug isn‚Äôt OP. It‚Äôs BROKEN. 
---
Overpowered things, to me, have always been things that are working AS INTENDED, but are too powerful and give somebody an advantage because of how powerful it is. 
---
BROKEN things are things that aren‚Äôt working as intended and give somebody else the advantage because of it not working as intended. 
---
Or at least, that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve always looked at it. Maybe we look at those two terms differently and that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre at a disagreement but right now I still stand as Ghostface not being overpowered, but rather the reveal mechanics being broken.
---
I‚Äôm usually the one in the bottom left...and I‚Äôm not even good at looping. I‚Äôm just the fucking patzy
---
It's only easy if the survivors are idiots or overly altruistic. Being able to close the hatch definitely helped him though. Freddie is a noob stomper but at the high ranks he is useless
---
&gt;but if you can stay in plain view and just jump in and out of cover
---
That's an oxymoron. 
---
&gt;If you leave the loop you get exposed, if you stay then you can't reveal him anyway
---
Not try to loop him around low cover to begin with? Kinda like how you don't stand around when the nurse is blinking, or the plague, or how you don't run through tall grass when playing against a trapper.
---
Different killers require different solutions.
---
110% killer?
---
Quick question.
---
The survivor furthest to the right in the survivor status icons is surrounded by something in their icon.  What does that actuallly mean?  I've seen it a few times and was curious. 
---
Thanks.
---
Where‚Äôs the ebony
---
I‚Äôm not shit at looping. Maybe stop being a toxic piece of shit? You just want another 1 hit killer due to your lack of actually keeping up a chase
---
Toxic? How is that guy toxic?
---
There‚Äôs going to be a 2 week Anniversary event which starts the same day. I‚Äôm pretty sure the event will have BP bonuses too.
---
Whats with all the salty comments? I thought this was a pretty funny, straight forward memeüòÖ
---
Tbagging doesnt directly affect you,only pisses you off, tunneling and camping directly fucks up your match
---
Movement speed.
---
It means they are the killer‚Äôs obsession and as long as they‚Äôre alive the killer gets a buff and when they are killed the survivors get a buff. The killer basically needs to prioritise keeping them alive till last
---
Every other killer is using franklins. And I use a looter build. Kms.
---
Played against a clown for the first time ever last night.  Dude totally wrecked us, I don't think we even got a single gen running.
---
Who the fuck do you think you are? Why do shitty killers like you need even more in your favor? Oh that‚Äôs right because you can‚Äôt do a fucking thing without an insta down weapon
---
You realize the killer was nowhere near? He was chasing someone else at the time and it was Myers so he had no Terror radius and I couldn't have known he was coming back to tunnel. A person decided to randomly turn around and run directly at the Killer. Otherwise I would have taken the hit or gone for the flashlight save if he wouldn't have ran back to the hook and died on top of it. The dude disconnected anyway since he was on death hook. All three other survivors escaped
---
This is me.
---
If you say so killer main you just need more insta down killers you guys are so terrible
---
155k w Doctor, there were streamers, Pudding, and my BBQ stacks.
---
Borrowed time also encourages unhooking people right in front of the killer. The killer was not there at the time. He turned around and ran back to the hook after we were already out of the area. I didn't Farm him because the killer was not in sight and there was no heartbeat at the time of unhooking
---
This isn‚Äôt accurate... there should be 1 BPS (your own), 2 Escape Cakes, 1 Thick Mist offering and an Ebony Mori.
---
Very welcome
---
Really nice counter arguement. Bet you hate Billy too. Bet you think the game is killer sided when its not.
---
Infinite on Myers? Talk to someone on the survivor team, get double red t3 off before the first gen, Ez game. Would be too broken.
---
A or b? That‚Äôs still great whenever survivors get a c tier perk you guys want it nerfed because it makes it to hard for you guys to kill anyone
---
The dude missed his DS and rage quit. All three other survivors including myself escaped
---
I mean... Exploiting pseudo infinites with shitload of windows - TOXIC
---
No. I just want another good killer that isnt mid to low tier who can acuallty compete in high ranks with Nurse or Billy. 
---
Clearly your the bad one.
---
It‚Äôs blatantly one sided
---
Yeah I'm know. But some noobies don't hear and stay on the gen. However when i try to grab them, it just don't. It hits them or spirit does the grab animation but stop at the start of it.
---
Weird
---
I mean we also have the shrine which will give alot of bloodpoints if you buy a perk that you already have so technically you could max him out without playing a match but I mean either way it isn't that bad.
---
An hour later.
---
Killer: ‚Äútime to camp‚Äù
---
Dude, you really need to learn how this game works, and how every perk and power works
---
It would of been amazing to have him during the event, you could prestige 3 him in a day, and it would of made people more inclined to purchase him
---
That‚Äôs not we‚Äôre afraid of, we‚Äôre afraid of not having a good killer
---
In england they would lift the little finger !
---
That long straight arrow is a representation of how hard my dick gets when I see 5 streamers.
---
Neither can I!!!
---
I swear on the Entity if this is a pun...
---
Not a fan, but i see him wen im bored
---
Also it's literally illegal
---
Lol I got my first sloppy butcher recently as well. I also still have yet to get distressing on doctor.
---
Yea. To survivors. Everyone knows the game is, and was, surivivor sided. You arent very good at the game are you?
---
Mmmm... ass flavor

Depending on how old this is you could still save them. If you were in an animation the traps would wait until after
---
&gt;Not try to loop him around low cover to begin with?
---
Good luck with that if that's the only thing you have to work with, macmilian/autohaven/redforest/spirit's map/asylum all have a lot of low cover loops. You either work with them or go out in the open.
---
Perk 1: WRYYYYY

Perk 2: Reject Your Humanity

Perk 3: Hinjaku hinjaku

Situational awareness level: 0
---
If it's a pun I'm calling the police
---
Yeah, now is the chance to get it, maybe I try for plague, but I don't want to start to play as ghostface on rank 1
---
This is why we can‚Äôt have nice things üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
*You'll never take me alive*
---
I got 180,000 blood points in a single match as huntress (without bbq sadly) because 4 people in the lobby used bloody party streamers
---
I don't think you really understand how underwhelming an instadown killer is. Its not like he can ahem... go through walls or sprint to you, his map pressure can be good by the looks of it ( sorry, I'm on console so I can't verify map pressure).
---
You insulted me first. Nor have you given any counter arugments.
---
WILL TOO
---
Tell that to the doctor who body blocked me and shocked me until escape timer ran out
---
Honestly, I‚Äôm of the mindset that any and all Killers could have NoED unless I have proof otherwise (if I find a Thrill totem that just makes me more anxious to clean them all) And as such if I see a totem, I‚Äôll clean it
---
Thanks I know it‚Äôs annoying to answer obvious answers
---
He's kind lower in the tier list, but a good learning tool, because he forces you to learn how to chase people with nothing but your m1
---
Yeah...people go extra tryhard/douchebag on these events...
---
Literally people want his ability fixed before release, its confirmed busted and isn't what the devs intended. Anyone who disagrees and want bugged powers in the game are childish
---
Fake news, Survivors using BPS are a myth!
---
You know, even if survivors can't unstealth him, he's still not very strong, you're right
---
Putting hilarious in the title doesnt automatically make the video funny
---
Enjoy your dislikes
---
Releasing this event at the same time as rank reset was a horrific idea. The game is completely fucked right now.
---
Have some green tea xD
---
Pig: heh, I'm gonna crouch and totally mind game this survivor at this loop
---
Survivor: oh the pig is crouching, I'm literally just going to run away from the loop to win
---
That wasn't stated in the patchnotes. He now has to be centered in your screen (his mask specifically), and you have to keep him there for about 0.3 seconds before the reveal actually starts. I'm sure if you do that you'll break him out without facing him.
---
If you want a game where all the killers are basically the same with mostly the same maps Friday the 13th still has dozens of players
---
don't forget killers that tunnel and camp because they are dicks only to ruin the match for everyone and don't give a shit about bloodhunt
---
I know Myers is licensed Killer, but once the devs see this I'm sure they'll understand what they have to do.
---
I do understand how OVERWHELMING insta downing someone is. And AHEM they can sprint to you ergo hillbilly so try again
---
Of course i do lol but all of the conditions are a chance. killer having franklins= chance. Bringing white ward when the killer has franklins = chance, etc. Im just saying theres another option if it comes down to that.
---
I have I have my points way earlier you shot in first with the insults try again kid
---
Vampire could drink survivors blood and it buffs them while debuffing that specific survivor? Idk
---
Yea exactly like that!
---
Hopefully
---
I never once said anything in that spirit, but alright.
---
I just think there shouldn't be a buffer before you actually start progressing the reveal meter. He should be able to repeatedly pop back into your line of sight and not get punished for it.
---
My go-to build is Adrenaline, Balanced Landing, Borrowed Time, and Mettle of Man.
---
Nah dude, you‚Äôre all good. It‚Äôs not annoying for me at all.
---
Yes but I expect survivors will be thinking this--v

It‚Äôs funny how all of a sudden you don‚Äôt remember your ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just bad at this game‚Äù comment the moment you get called out. I have given many counter arguments you just refuse to accept anyone else‚Äôs input on anything. All that needs to be adjusted is 2 simple things that won‚Äôt change his ability much at all but enough
---
... I'm getting mixed vibes here, because you're technically listing reasons saying that he **is** overpowered, in the context that he combines the strengths of two killers. Yet in the comment below you say the exact opposite...
---
shit
---
What exactly is bugged
---
I had 230k with Spirit. 4 man SWF brought 4 Party Streamers!
---
I'm sorry but it's impossible, especially at low ranks. Low rank survivors are too scared and paranoid to consider for a moment that you're not going to kill them. You can spend the whole game swinging at the air and they'll still bolt out the gate with a ggwp before leaving the lobby.
---
I already have 1 million blood points on the first day, and it wasn't for 24 hours. What are you on about?
---
Make sure you're up real close and tap the mouse button instead of holding it so you don't lunge.
---
Yeah they really gutted Sabo.  Which is bizarre because they then tried to buff it somewhat and then add some other perks like Jeff's to encourage Sabo-esque builds.  
---
I think the better alternative would've been to set a hard cap on how many traps/hooks can be broken.  Because even if you sabo a few hooks there's so many on the map to where a Killer can usually get to another one without worry.
---
"killers complaining about killers being under performing/ hard role don't get as much hate"
---
Really? I don't know about this sub but in THE OFFICIAL forum, which I suggest to never sign up for how horrible it is (mostly for the harmful and useless moderators) people get shit on for anything.
---
I've seen people saying bs like "killers don't need strong perks, they can kill survivors can't. They have already an extra perk"... Just saying
---
It's sad that's how this community works, by sides and not by improving the game. In battlefield community if something was broken we all complained about. On mobas, the same, hell I see that even in for Honor which can be pretty toxic too but they all want to improve the game
---
Here I see mostly braindead people who pick a side, play ONLY that side and throw shit without knowing what they are talking about. I've not played as long as many others but unlike these "veterans" I love this game and looked at - how the game was at the release, read the whole patch note history several times for discussions and curiosity and looking up how to improve this game
---
Sadly even who plays since the game launched has a giant bias and know less than me who started playing last summer, almost 1 year. Killers has problems but also survivors. Damn the vault changes were unnecessary, was a lazy change for a poor map design so they won't bother rework maps. A real rework, not just closing a window
---
So I disagree with "X takes more shit than Y" since both sides takes shit. Especially by msgs or post chat (depending on which platform) and only a few actually bother to interact on Reddit or communities, and from that percentage many don't bother to look it up but just brag about what THEY don't like pointing out the "other side"
---
These guys never played a real competitive game, a fighting game for example, where anything can be seen op if you are new but there you learn, here people wanna keep doing the same shit and win Everytime. The game has problems, yeah, but when people cry about BBQ , Noed, Borrowed or DS now that's reworked, just make me laugh
---
I swear I have a 99% chance to get hooked first each game. Either the killer always comes to my gen first and i get chased, or for once another survivor is found first, but then they run their ass straight in my direction without knowing where I am, and for some reason the killer chooses to chase me instead.
---
It *was* your camera before, but it made him laughably weak so removing that was part of the patch notes. It goes by where your model is looking, not your camera. If your character is facing the wrong way around it wont count.
---
That is true I‚Äôm really hoping for something we can grind for
---
Wrong.
---
NI!
---
Good luck tunneling with borrowed time and decisive strike
---
At least you can  play
---
I can't find a match
---
Survivor or killer
---
Ps4 sucks
---
Some spirits too, I see some spirits anyways
---
That is insane!
---
I‚Äôm talking about bloody party streamers.  Not bloodpoints.
---
If they nerf him, I'll be severely disappointed in them and the toxic players alike. I'm sure I won't be alone. Let's just hope he stays as is. If he does, he'll be one of the most fun Killers to play against imo.
---
Well you're just playing wrong then
---
It IS inevitable, but judging by how the direction of the game is going, I think we won't have to worry about that for a LONG time. I would say they would stop adding killers when they either run out of perk ideas or killer power ideas, and judging how the community is always giving survivor and killer ideas with perks, I would say we are good in that department.
---
Against after you play a camping Leatherface
---
My level 40 Jake is the first character I got to 40 for teachables.  
---
I dread any time I get a daily ritual with him because his perks are so outdated.  He'll probably be one of the first ones I prestige once I finish up leveling Ash/Jane.
---
Make your choice just makes the unhooker hide in a locker leaving the unhooked guy injured, groaning in pain, and with blood trails for the killer to find him with
---
That‚Äôs what I support, fix issues, not nerf the guy.
---
Unhooking yourself when you‚Äôre the last survivor is useless. What kind of a killer would leave you when you can attempt. 
---
How would you fix ruin? Many low ranks run NOED instead of ruin as far as I‚Äôve noticed.
---
I thought I was the only one. 10 minutes waiting for killer game. Hm ok ill try survivor. 10 minute waiting, joins a lobby, host disconects. Back to killer. Like, wtf
---
Should there only be 3 of the boys?
---
Well friend, I play Xbox, and would gladly play with you üòÅ
---
That's an incredibly niche situation though tbh, also it doesn't help that with mint rag, the traps aren't highlighted when you point at them, so you don't actually know which one you'll end up at sometimes
---
Potato survivors. Classic
---
When they will give something by achieving high ranks you'll see survivors actually try ( I hope)
---
I just take my 1 pip and peace out, in a way or in the other
---
Wow. That was very lucky.
---
I only use franklins when I see a flashlight or more than 2 toolboxes
---
It doesn't turn white though
---
And sometimes normal hag if you trap the hook escape routes right
---
Trying using the ‚Äúlooking for groups‚Äù for dead by daylight. You‚Äôll find a lot of people willing to play. Most of them are rank 20-15
---
Yeah but... why would you? Why give up an easy kill right in front of you to go after someone you see off in the distance when you can just kill the person in front of you and slow the survivors progress. When killers tell survs to stop looping, and when survs tell killers to stop tunneling, they are literally saying ‚Äúmake the game harder for yourself so I have a better chance of winning‚Äù
---
Untrue... I play ps4 and any given day I get matches super quick as both survivor and killer...
---
With every new perk added to the game, the grind becomes that much worse, it's getting bad dude. New players are totally screwed
---
I loved it! Do you have any web or social account where you share your drawings? I would totally love to see more of your art!

---
Yeah as someone who plays both I hate getting tunneled, I‚Äôll still do it and I still won‚Äôt be pissed when people do it to me. It just makes sense to go after the weaker target first, just like a gank fight in other games, taking the weak ones out make the strong ones far easier
---
Feels good to know I'm not alone
---
I heard they are thinking about phasing out perk tiers, when you unlock a perk you don't have to buy it 3 times you just have the tier 3 version of it basically, that seems like a great way to fix the grind without letting everyone get ultra rare add-ons every game
---
Don‚Äôt use it cus there‚Äôs other perks that I prioritize
---
I feel you there xD
---
I can't hit 50k+ without WGLF and Prove Thyself and some offering.
---
I'm just a poow wittle wedditow with no cash, but maybe I can make it up to you in some othew way. owO
---
Not a fan but you made an entire topic just to defend him lol
---
Killer earns more BP so people are spamming out killer, meaning too many lobbies for not enough survivors. Usually it is the opposite with survivor having longer queues.
---
This is hilarious lol thanks for making me laugh
---
But that person said there's no counter to it, true there is no way to alter your playstyle to counter it but there is a perk that should give you enough time to at least not get grabbed of gen.
---
It seems that asking for gold was a real... Boner on my part.
---
Reeeeeeeepost
---
I'm not gonna be able to play til tomorrow man...
---
If you use bbq it just becomes overpowered
---
Me and my teammates got camped by Leatherface 10 minutes ago
---
That poor god pallet.
---
the survivors would be the killers and the killers would be the survivors :D
---
With the rate of growth this game has, and the fact it's still going so strong, I wouldn't be surprised if it lasts like League of Legends or Warframe. Nothing's gonna stop this game until a really strong competitor shows, which is pretty unlikely at this point since it's a unique genre that BHVR has 3 years of experience with now. No one else has enough experience with this kind of game to make a strong competitor, even Last Year has been in development hell for the *last year*
---
How tf is that racist lmao
---
nice play!
---
Please stop
---
Bet
---
Only a bad Myers or someone intentionally not stalking to only get Tier 3 once in a game.
---
 Huh? What was that noise?
---
Whose footprints are these?
---
Maybe if you got good at the game and didn‚Äôt suck. It‚Äôs extremely easy to win as both killer and survivor. People like you complain too much. Your name is probably Joe.
---
MoM+DS+Adrenaline+self care
---
Like bro this isnt rank 1 its rank 20.
---
I haven't played in months and saw I was sitting at rank 20 and decided to try a new killer with 0 perks. Worst idea ever
---
If the killer can‚Äôt have his ability completely and instantly negated before he can even use it by survivors just rotating their camera he is OP
---
Because legion is a character that his whole power is running at people?...
---
Whoever kills the survivor wins you can smack other killers to stun them and make them drop the survivor
---
I like your tears, noed noob
---
Isn't legion garbage after the nerf though?
---
Glad you find it funny haha
---
Glad you find it funny &lt;3
---
Am I missing something? Please tell me this is /s
---
Then you should play immersed 24/7, when you hear the heartbeat hide in the locker and always hide no matter what.
---
&gt;the way the devs intended for it to be when the game first came out.
---
Like the tutorial who shows how to camp or the insidious perk?
---
Jeez I don't wanna defend camping since it's a dumb tactic if bad executed but your argument is silly. Nobody plays "normally" or "how devs intended to" starting from the survivors!
---
&gt;Camping, tunneling and slugging is just stuff that the players came up with and the devs just say it's a damn strategy just so the killers won't leave the game
---
Like looping? Like infinites? Dude really, what are you talking about?
---
Those are a strategy, not as an excuse but because they fucking are. Their obj is catch you, if means to hit the guy who just got unhooked to A deny the safe hook and B save 1m for the next stage, I will. Especially when they do it in front of me.
---
By your logic as I said previously you should play normally too. Playing immersed, not gen rushing (since for you tunneling even if it's efficient it's not a strategy then you shouldn't be efficient as well) but instead hide right after you hear the terror radius
---
It's just dumb. Your argument has no fundamentals, just entitlement since there are even perks DESIGNED for camping even if as the game is, it's a suicide and just wanting to lose the game (potatoes aside)
---
Compare my Reddit name to the clip and then refer to the comment above where I mentioned my friend clipped this for me
---
Yeah, I saw, thanks for clearing it up.
---
Iron Will is indeed an awesome perk. But we can't deny that killer is a lil dumb... how he didn't see the blood pool lol
---
And why do they need to be changed? Hes not op. Should you change every instadown?
---
He doesn't feel strong, like i tag someone then im like 'okay what do i do now' but i dont mind him myself, plus that game i managed to keep them on 3 gens left for about 10 minutes by patrolling around
---
What‚Äôs your strategy most games? And I can‚Äôt see your perks to well. But I‚Äôm trying to get better and am currently struggling
---
Works every time for me
---
It should be pretty obvious that they're not getting many hits if they aren't getting downs and hooks. Either way 3 hooking someone is around 2k points alone. If they're only chasing people and not really getting downs, that is a slow 8k points. Chasing is only 1 of 4 categories of points. Nobody wants only 8k points, especially this weekend. 
---
Another way to phrase my comment is that she has zero kills, definite depip, the exits are open, do you want her to just leave so you can get a free escape?
---
Don't derank. You're just one of the many problems this game has if you do
---
Get sloppy butcher and thanatophobia and just injury people as much as you can basically
---
Need another noob friend to play with? Just lemmino, I'll add you and we can get shat on together
---
I get people with it all the time tho, I‚Äôm pretty new to the game so maybe I‚Äôm just playing against bad players,
---
I love it when a survivor thinks they can loop me using a pallet. Spirit+pallet-looper = HA tricked ya
---
no he just pointed out how stupid he sounds
---
‚ÄúSomething that is balanced in the eyes of a novice is truly beyond broken in the hands of an expert‚Äù -Tsun Su in The Art Of War, probably.
---
I thought the hatch opens period when only 1 person is left?
---
I use it to close gaps and catch people on the wrong side of a pallet
---
üôÑ
---
excellent move a shitpost done right
---
It was the rank reset and they were all 17 or above, for about 5 games it was 4k pretty simply.
---
Um no. Thats wrong. Its camara. They just made it way harder to do as you have to foucs it on him.
---
Your incorrect. Its still camara, just made it have to be way harder to reveal him using it.
---
 
---
# Don't Take From My Pile...
---
Say what? Are they out of their minds?
---
The only change i want to see to myers is let him switch between tier 1 and 2.
---
So yesterday I tried playing dbd and it popped up the save error 302 is there a fix for this
---
My perks were discordance, overcharge, hex ruin and monitor and abuse, i only ran monitor because i didnt have a good fourth perk.
---
but when i play legion instead of trying to go for kills straight up ill slowly tag everyone and damage gens as much as i can, discordance allows me to know whats been done quickly, overcharge has made people blow the gen up multiple times. I just try play the long game and pick one off when i feel confident i can hook them and i see a survivor going for a loop constantly i accept the loss and go away because i know they are trying to stall me
---
"What's a pallet?" -Samination Nurse
---
Smol billy ded
---
Legion is better then before the rework in my opion.
---
&gt;I thought the hatch opens period when only 1 person is left?
---
Yes but you said "theres only 2 of us left, I'll go hunt for the hatch".
---
Thought you meant searching for hatch before the other guy was dead.
---
No it‚Äôs way to fast that he can get you exposed is my whole reasoning, and how long you are exposed is unearned in my opinion
---
It takes Myers a while to get his 60 second exposed where as it takes Gf 4 seconds for his 45
---
If the design isn‚Äôt fun change the design it‚Äôs a game not a movie
---
lmfao - thats just pathetic &gt;.&lt;
---
‚ÄúHope you get your masks‚Äù
---
my record is 120k with friendly bubba
---
I got 100k and over with doc and got 550k in 5 games
---
R u on pc?
---
Ok? And what are the chances that the killer wasn‚Äôt 20% visible?
---
Post this to r/dogelore
---
Anytime I face a Hag i almost have a heartattack when she pops up out of no where
---
He‚Äôs just as fast as the fastest killers in game, if you‚Äôre getting looped that bad it‚Äôs your fault. If you get looped for 45 seconds even though you have a 15% speed advantage
---
the reveal mechanism should work as intended
---
First of all, the devs didn't intend for players to hide all the time, so that in itself is wrong. Survivors are meant to be doing gens and being a team, not hiding all the time. Hiding when the killer is around yes but not all the time.
---
What tutorial? I never had a tutorial on mine, only type of tutorial I had was the images and hints on loading screens.
---
Looping and infinites are totally different, if a survivor didn't try to loop or infinite all they would be able to do is waste pallets and run in a straight line, it totally different than camping and tunneling, WAY DIFFERENT. So I don't see the point in comparing the two, one hurts the player as one is good for the player. And doing that to someone who just got unhooked is dumb, yes it's their job to catch u but if ur smart ur gonna hit the unhooker and down/hook him so u have one healing, one hooked and one going for a save, that's 3 ppl off gens. Plus hitting the person who just got hooked is very unfair, it's not their fault they got farmed, ur just being a dick at that point.
---
Playing immersed and playing dumb is different, hiding all the time is pure idiocy and that's NOT normal gameplay for survivors, if it was then what are unhooks and being altruistic? Ur not making sense here, I mean yes like I said previously u should hide or be sneaky when the killer is around but not ALL the time like u are saying.
---
How does my argument have no fundamentals? If everyone, killer or not, that agrees with me says camping and tunneling is dumb and only harms the victims and the killer themselves? And there's only ONE perk that's designed for camping, so obviously it's not something that should be done ALL THE TIME. Like, I understand camping a hook at end game or protecting a hook when survivors are swarming it but not face camping.
---
Anyway, nobody commenting on this post is really swing the issue that I posted about. So if ur gonna comment then talk about THAT
---
The abundance of perks has made the grind extremely difficult. It's made worse by the fact that only a select few are actually good and you need to level them up 3 times. We needes a rework a long time ago.
---
XD
---
None we have plenty of gameplay footage, literally everyone who's played against him, and the developers saying its broken.
---
0 chance.
---
Ok. That‚Äôs reasonable. Trust but verify, ya know?
---
It is.
---
Well, it's easy to get thanked and commended when you don't destroy a team and everyone gets fat stacks of bloodpoints.
---
See what they say when you straight fuck em up with a 4k and everyone makes less than 5-7k.
---
The Hater-Aid will flow then, my friend.  ;)
---
Why? I don't know how he works.
---
That would actually be a pretty neat concept.
---
Nobody complains about c tier perks.
---
All you guys want are weakass killers that can‚Äôt do shit.
---
‚ÄúiT‚Äôs A tIeR aND tHaTS tOo GoOd‚Äù
---
Lol. Surivivors ARE supposed to loop killers no matter how fast they are. Thats the point of pallets and windows and lockers. Speed doesnt make a differnce.
---
Haha the fcking bell got me
---
All 3 get hatch escape. 9k BP. All depip.
---
Words only have power if you give them that power. No word was actually said for all you know i was talking bout NOED as the top comment said. I think you need to think things through before you comment
---
***oink***
---
either you haven't played the PTB or you're just lying . just look all around and you'll see that hiding while someone just spotted you you can just appear again and they won't be able to reveal you . check out Noob3 latest video or go on a stream and you'll see.
---
Just has more tools.
---
When I play killer, I usually let the last person escape and when i get my ass kicked as the killer, I moon walk at the exit gates and move my head up and down.
---
Stop screaming nerfs when you don't understand how he works yet.
---
Christian Version
---
I doubt that, but we'll see
---
Has happened to me but whit HillBilly
---
I want to*
---
But if that‚Äôs the issue, yeah, im all for patches and fixes. No nerfs
---
Im loving these watercolors!!
---
Be a very disappointing event if all we got was a balloon on the gen lol but ya we will see
---
Yah
---
Never thought to try overcharge. I just unlocked ruin‚Äôs teachable and I‚Äôll try this. Thank you!
---
Jackass
---
Rewards good players without  nertfing him too hard
---
I agree but I‚Äôm a little slow on just now hearing that his ability is slightly bugged so they need to fix that and NOT nerf him
---
Sneaky, sneaky.
---
S++++++
---
Haha that's a good point
---
IM GONNA SAY THE N WORD
---
He gave up because you unhooked him and ran off, stopping him from running away from the killer. 
---
You were full health and could easily have taken a protection hit for him and the killer would have either chased you or if he was really trying to tunnel you could have blocked him like you did to Jake. 
---
If he was on death hook even more reason to run behind him between the killer. 
---
I don‚Äôt condone rage quitting but I can understand how he would be upset at the situation you put him in. 
---
What do you expect the killer to do in this situation?
---
Ignore the unhook notification, especially if he‚Äôs that close to it?
---
Ignore and try and run past the injured survivor to get to you?
---
When you unhook a survivor let them run away first and follow them to make sure they get away safely. 
---
If you want them to go a certain way you can point before you unhook them. 
---
It only takes a second and you say you didn‚Äôt think the killer was near anyway. 
---
What does it hurt to be sure and stay behind to protect them just in case?
---
Otherwise you just lose points and end up blaming the killer.
---
Killers will spend 10 mins chasing me while my teammates finish 5 gens, cleanse hex totems and open exit gates :)
---
You wouldn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs the joke. And also it would be the aura reading if it were bannable.
---
I did. My point and fact i was tryin to make is that Ghostface littrely has nothing else to help him. He cant make use of the exposed effect like most of the other killers who have a instadown. He gets no speical chase bouns, no map pressure or molibty, no way to slow the game donw.
---
??? Where did you hear this? Only your camera has to focus on him but it has to be nearly centered and held for like 2 seconds.
---
Good one
---
But slippery meat is cool :(
---
If they just lowered the cost of everything by 2k id be ok.
---
Ok.
---
A few days ago, I bought the game on Xbox so I could play in my room when I'm too tired to play on pc in the office. My first game in rank 20 as hillbilly, I get a 4k in swamp and I instantly receive a message: "reported."
---
I asked for what and he said it was for cheating. I explained to him that I'd been playing for years on pc and just got this account for Xbox. He replies something along the lines of, "This might be my first game, but I know a cheater when I spot a cheater. Reported!!"
---
B b ut... _up the ante_
---
Stealth pallet update, pun intended ;P
---
They're still funny. :)
---
I use Slippery Meat and Up the ante on Ace... is it bad?
---
It only works if you're already injured... if you had adrenaline you were fully healed it wont proc... only injured it will work for tier 3 Myers if you are already injured.
---
You are being toxic again.
---
Thank you
---
Isn't it illegal to call people bad if your grammar is bad?
---
I agree, this game feels even more grindy than an MMO RPG. Not everyone has 500hrs to get all the teachables.
---
r/dogelore disagrees
---
Alright yea that makes sense cuz I was fully healed
---
They‚Äôve already stated when the dedicated servers are out it will help a lot and they will be able to further optimize things. 60FPS consoles will be coming. Dedicated servers come out this month.
---
I wouldn't really say that was a nerf if he now had control over that.
---
Don‚Äôt run randomly. Have a plan and don‚Äôt camp pallets. Look back at the killer and as you look for possible loops or a place to lose the killer.
---
 [https://www.whenisthenextsteamsale.com/](https://www.whenisthenextsteamsale.com/)  Whenever I've seen big sales on steam, DBD and most of its DLC's were on sale
---
‚ÄúSurely the survivor mains exaggerate how badly they‚Äôre camped and tunneled, it can‚Äôt be THAT bad!‚Äù -Me before getting camped for literally 7 games in a row in the first minute.
---
I love rank 13
---
I agree, this game feels even more grindy than an MMO RPG. Not everyone has 500hrs to get all the teachables. They need to untie BP from your score.
---
Fookin coldwin
---
"to much avail"... 
---
I do not think it means what you think it means.
---
U wot. I‚Äôm not new go away &gt;:(
---
Run randomly. Never have a plan and camp pallets. Don't look back at the killer as you look for possible hooks or a place to have tea with the killer.
---
Good old days
---
I like the way that this guy is a mod
---
Like 25% of all killer mains on this sub are in this psycho cult of pig mains who haven't seen any of the Saw movies but pretend they do because they've watched the kill counts, think Amanda is the hottest fictional character, beat the shit out of the dead horse that is her pallet stun and "Oink", and will upvote anything that has to do with her with no exceptions.
---
Imagine running ruin at rank 16
---
-360s suck at higher rank
---
-Killers will almost always double back at loops so use that gain space in a chase
---
But Dbd isnt killer sided lol..
---
I don‚Äôt think he is overpowered but he is definitely not bad. I have not played him or played against him but I have seen footage and my prediction is he is going to be B tier
---
No.
---
Bro it's just a joke about how someone looks. You're literally giving the n-word the power you don't want it to have
---
Something wrong with running ruin at a certain rank?
---
Ah, so it will go on sale in the summer :) ty !
---
the link? weird it works for me
---
does the link not work?
---
how is using ruin sweaty?
---
Pig and saw? Take my upvote pls
---
He can oneshot so not really
---
He can be revealed though
---
He's a viable Killer from what ive seen so he isnt average killer
---
Why are so toxic to everyone?
---
lol okay, im not sweaty, just because i run one perk, i run it because its a good perk, if i lose it 30 seconds into the game idc i just get on with it. Also thanks 2 kills is better than no kills
---
Though sometimes his direct counter doesn't work. Plenty of videos where survivors are looking directly at GF in the open and it takes around 3-5 seconds to uncloak him.
---
Generally speaking most people won't cleanse against Plague, but this strategy can *completely* fuck your team over if the killer's running Black Incense.
---
He doesnt need any changes, you scared of a strong killer like Nurse and Spirit making it into the game?
---
This made me laugh out loud, I really enjoy this format lmao.
---
Lemme just copy this meme format and save it for when the next killer gets released for easy karma.
---
its quite handy in my opinion :)
---
Everyone pretty much wants this and has told/screamed/yelled at the Devs for a change to both Bloodpoints we earn normally and for how the Bloodwebs are...and they pretty much ignore it...my guess is a "we know better" mindset or that without a harsher grind...people wouldn't play as much....Id play far more if I knew I wouldn't have damn games where I end up,with hardly any points
---
oh god not the oink
---
You just want it to be easier to play against him thats why you want tweaks, we finally get a decent killer and then Devs will nerf him because of pussy survivors like you complaining before he's even come out officially
---
Sounds reasonable to me. To be honest I dont see why it doesnt decay slowly (similar to doctors madness) as it is...
---
It wouldve been super OP otherwise.
---
Oh sorry I won't post about it because obviously the devs are paying attention and doing something about it. Right?
---
I've got a weird issue where the mouse cursor tries to exit the side of the screen even though the game is fullscreen. I've got a [video](https://youtu.be/M1QhkTkbOqQ) of this happening. Whenever the mouse is visible, left and right click actions do not register. I'd really appreciate any help on this issue, thanks :)
---
Swap as well. I hate it on everything. I actually enjoy the game/lerys (which apparently a lot of people dislike) but I absolutely hate the swamp.
---
See this https://youtu.be/pshlJLOeX7k
---
It's a static image
---
No I play killer a lot so I want better tier killers, not ones that completely remove the balance
---
Literally happened to me but the guy sent me a voice message cause I found him in a locker with rancor
---
It makes it far better...but only if people are bringing in offerings and not steamroll games...hope those tryharding Survivors appreciate the Streamers I've been bringing in... That's one issue too is that Survivors and most Killers are rushing matches.
---
One thing is thatwe NEED a mechanic to trash add-ons &amp; offerings for Bloodpoint refund...there's a lot of trash on Bloodwebs
---
Yeah after they turned it into an anti-tunnel perk Killers really have no room to get upset or salty over it.
---
I dont get why people have a problem with it? Billy, LF, Myers, Plague all have instadown in chases.
---
Keep an eye out over the next few days. Likely to go on sale with the anniversary on the 18th of this month.
---
And where exactly does it state that?
---
Fucking... HOW DO YOU CHEAT ON AN XBOX?! It is nigh impossible to hack one of these things to get cheats onto it because it goes online for this shit and Aghh... I feel my braincells killing themselves one by one in the most painful way possible!
---
Also if you slug for any reason, lol

you hold m2

---
It's not how bad Myers is, it's how good the survivors are.
---
Same here, especially when there are two gens on one of the docks. You can get lost pretty easily but idk I just never liked the map and I absolutely hate it as a killer.
---
Aside from the element of surprise, NOED is not overpowered. 
---
Fans of Pig don't have any personality. (oink this, oink that)
---
More of the killer roster could be buffed or reworked. 
---
The toxicity in this game is definitely mostly survivors' fault. This is evident by the rabid amount of people who spam: "Sounds like you just want survivors to give you free kills or run in a straight line for easy kills" whenever someone complains about survivors. 
---
This is a response to a question about UNPOPULAR opinions so I can state how I feel even if most people don't like it but that won't stop the flood of responses like "entitled killer main" to come through despite my playing both sides equally.
---
I can agree with these changes if you give him immunity to detection perks while in Night Shroud, it's ridiculous that he can't do nothing against SWF teams with Object of Obsession.
---
&gt;i run it because its a good perk
---
My bad. You're not sweaty, just bad.
---
I used to play on PS4 back until October, I can confirm que times are waaaay shorter on PC
---
u/thatkidARGO not bad man, proud of you
---
That makes no sense in the context. Pretty sure its supposed to work that way.
---
Maybe a Maniac Cop skin? We already have the protagonist of the flick
---
Then dc.
---
I want that Bunny one sooooo badly
---
I feel betrayed by Clown mains.
---
Maybe if I played killer at all.  Unlike you I actually enjoy learning joy to play against new killers and not cry about how OP they are before they‚Äôre even released.  But hey some people suck at the game and that‚Äôs fine if you‚Äôre one of them.
---
No. Don't support this trash.
---
this person could be on console it's pretty fucking hard to use flashlights with a controller
---
Is this the new map that came with the Plague or an even newer one? I‚Äôve never seen it before but then again I quit last Christmas.
---
1 because Billy ,LFs, Myers can be countered by getting them to bump into objects or hide and not allow Myers to get his stalk and for Plague well she isn't technically meant to 1 shot because people are supposed to cleanse but I mean shit happens. 2. He is a stealth killer meant to stalk out of chases then get into chases, that's what the 45 second exposed is for and I'm pretty sure the devs didn't intend for this to happen plus you kinda can't counter it because you need him centered in the camera and in a Chase that will become near impossible.
---
Honestly, the username alone deserves an upvote.
---
You used to be able to cancel the trap while hooked, the saving person would unhook you and their foot would be in the trap, and the person on hook would look down and hold the interact button. When you finished the unhook animation you‚Äôd instantly get put in the spring trap animation and it would prevent the savior from getting trapped. Made trapper pretty garbage tier
---
Ghostface does not ‚Äúcompletely remove balance‚Äù
---
This game is the complete worst for it, either survivors doing gens, looping, flashlights and pallets the same goes for killers camping,tunneling etc
---
Always see how the killer role impacts survivors negatively but they never ever address the rampant issues survivors constantly cause killers.
---
Sure, just because you don't like a perk im bad, have a good day
---
I can get that. I definitely have matches as killer where I just have to straight up ignore a survivor because they're just beyond my skill and can loop the entire game if I chase them.
---
Oh I know but if someone insults you, you should act nice and ask why they are mad and try to understand what they are feeling that's what I do and Ive actually managed them to realize that they are acting kinda douchey and made friends from it.
---
sorry i forgot the T " Can't discover him "
---
I love how your toxic ass keeps throwing insults when you don‚Äôt even know how I play, and clearly since you admitted you don‚Äôt play both sides you don‚Äôt have any room to speak on killers
---
Neither is not making a post, who cares my dude?
---
Sorry to see that those pussies downvoted you out of insecurity. This build makes it unfun to play killer and takes skill out of the equation. Killers HAVE to hit you, which means there is no counter to MoM except getting someone in less than 3 hits and camping them.
---
If it doesn't say it stacks, it doesn't stack
---
At least extend the damn event for a whole week..esp,the long queue times and for Xbox users, missing out on hours of it because of an issue...
---
Paid dlc maps
---
You think there's no issue with the ridiculous grind?
---
Some people can‚Äôt they just get angry and camp whoever they catch
---
you scuffed that meme hard mate
---
um i think so dont quote me on that tho ily uwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwu ;-;
---
Ok first, You can counter Ghostface the same way as Myers by hiding and not letting him stalk. Two: He will be shit if he has to chase for 45 seconds with no tools to help him in a chase what so ever. 
---
And i dont get why people complain, Plague can make someone broken the entire game with no counterplay yet shes not op now is she.
---
i did try once and i got more suicide trolling, will try more though! thank you
---
it's plagues map
---
Yes there is when you're new or returning to the game and realize you have to spend a ridiculous amount of time to unlock all the teachables to perks you want, and then leveling whoever to get the perks on them. It's too much of a grind.
---
I didn't say i don't like it. You're just a noob for using it. Keep yourself safe bud
---
To the people in the comments who will inevitably be saying 'lol calm spirit is trash anyway' you're missing the point. Saying it's bad is irrelevant to the fact it's broken, and refusing to call attention to it is just dumb.
---
If you had 10 games in 3 days of people telling you to kill your self, how on Earth are you playing? Are you just face camping people?
---
After 500 hours, I‚Äôve only had a handful of people tell me to kill my self.
---
Love how nice this community is. Of course you still get the occasional salt, but generally you will have nice people in your games. Wholesome post 10/10.
---
Depends, are you camping hooked Survivors?  Are you tunneling down people unhooked and ignore others?  Because that's a fast way to earn the ire of many players
---
It says afflictions of the same type don't stack but does that refur to the extra terror effect or the effect it adds to madness?
---
*Flashes back to me starting out as a newbie killer* yeah that makes sense.
---
&gt;ither survivors doing gens, looping, flashlights and pallets the same goes for killers camping,tunneling 
---
aren't these all things you are supposed to do in the game to one degree or another?
---
i'm sorry i'm super new at this

---
You do, because you decided to make an entire thread on it and then reply to my comment. You care.
---
That's true, but the experience of a new player playing Trapper, especially after rank reset, is usually just the constant noise of traps being disarmed in the distance and gens going off while you walk around the map looking for traps.
---
I play killer a lot and camping or tunneling are things I will never do
---
You realize killers can't change their perks or add-ons after seeing offerings?
---
It is but legit some people find it toxic, I don‚Äôt understand it
---
Thanks for making my day pal. "Grind" as if this game has any grind anymore
---
 good survivors adapt. The garbage ones complain. Constantly. That's all.
---
Ah! Yea. I think how its meant to work is that there is a buffer where it wont reset so that shouldnt work as well. But its intended right now by the patch notes.
---
Like who? I have not been toxic to anyone. I am just stating things how they are
---
Had this happen to me as well when I was playing hag, only killer I‚Äôve had this happen to me on. It was so confusing ha
---
The terror radius stacks, the pallets don‚Äôt.
---
The afflictions don‚Äôt stack but the other parts do. So the Terror Radius from Calm, etc will stack. Also, assume things stack if it doesn‚Äôt say whether it stacks or not.
---
If it doesn‚Äôt say it doesn‚Äôt stack, it stacks.
---
I knew I made a good choice stopping my Plague bloodweb at untouched 40
---
Um, yeah it does. Go troll somewhere else please.
---
Totems first thing always. 
---
You need to gather intel to figure out who the killer is and what their play style is like. 
---
Killers patrol gens. 
---
Cleans a totem near a gen. Free bloodpoints + you get info on the killer so you can adapt your strategy better. 
---
Additionally, when the killer finishes checking out the nearby gens, they‚Äôll leave and check the other side of the map. Optimal time to start gens. 
---
Cleans totems, save lives.
---
K so its really hard to understand. You have to move your pupils to the right side of your screen and read the sidebar.
---
&gt; Depends, are you camping hooked Survivors?
---
well im playing leatherface and i thought that was the whole  point of his "ability" (swinging the chainsaw around doing multiple hits) , did i got it wrong?
---
Too easy.
---
I've long kicked those habits. Even without DS the games feel way to short if I just tunnel down one survivor or camp someone. I've started letting weaker survivors get away from chases if I see another survivor I haven't hooked yet or see a gen that needs to be kicked. It just makes the games feel better.
---
Not garbage really but some changes still feel bad/garbage like slower vaulting and missing FF attacks exhausting you and ending Feral Frenzy (instead of it depleting your meter a bit further).  But outside of high ranks, Legion is fine...which is why people do have an issue with where they stand on tier
---
F for Amanda
---
I don‚Äôt play killer anymore (6 months) since moving because I have shit ping now and it wouldn‚Äôt be fair for others.  You demanding nerfs on a killer that hasn‚Äôt been released yet says all anyone needs to know about your play style .
---
Ok?
---
It'll stop noed since there needs to be an unlit totem to become lit. It won't spawn a new teton, so if all are broke, then no noed.
---
I don't. But shit players will always be shit players
---
Killer is not challenging...
---
Azarov's Resting Place on Autowreckers is one of my least favorite on survivor. Often have games there where all the gens on one side of the map will get finished and leave the last few piled on top of one another. D:
---
Well, that's fatalistic
---
Take it off then. Run something that's at least decent
---
The current Rule Set No.2 should in my honest opinion be part of the Pig's base power. There's no reason survivors should be able to see the boxes right off the bat *unless* the traps are activated.  
---
It's a pretty harsh handicap to *not* be playing with the Rule Set No.2.  
---
Not to mention that it makes no sense lore-wise. Jigsaw's games were always about putting you on a time limit, realising the danger you're in only *after* the timer has begun.
---
k
---
fuck my mom and all that im very used to it, i played wow since it came out and a string of fps and moba. The killing myself thing really surprised me though...
---
Maybe, but we literally have had this buffed version for like a day that‚Äôs not enough time to tell so I‚Äôd hold back on the underpowered spiel
---
I had a myers send me a clip when I did this to them this morning.
---
Chill dude, no one cares about your experience in a video game lol. 
---
The game is still grindy, we get you're a grizzled vet, but no one cares.
---
Cuz it's not actually too good, they would be a salty (fill in the blank) because they're complaining about something they shouldn't be.
---
During this bloodpoint weekend I‚Äôve 100% used bbq insidious monstrous shrine and iron grasp to absolutely demolish games
---
Don't worry, it's on game pass ATM so probably a lot of new people including a younger crowd.
---
Why are you playing killer if you know you have shit internet? That's a shitty thing to do
---
you can still groan if you're injured, Iron Will makes your groans completely silent
---
Survivor mains: MoM isn't toxic!! STFU baby killers who hate this perk.
---
Also Survivor mains: This image. 
---
Me: Something doesn't add up here.
---
Really? Oh man do I wish I had some of my Xbox 360 voice messages that I got back in the day lol. I had grown adults sending voice messages to me -screaming- at me to kill myself and rot in a ditch when I was like 15.
---
See if you blatantly play killer full well knowing you have bad internet. You should get some sort of punishment. Because it literally makes the game unplayable for survivors
---
The game def doesn't explain any of the nuances of how games play out at all.  Not trashing ya, its fine to not know!  Part of being in the community is to help each other (or should).  My advice is since you play Leatherface, make use of BBQ. 
---
Once you hook someone look around, if you see other Survivor's auras (they're red and not hard to miss)  then go after them instead of sitting at the hook. If you don't, look around the area for a quick sweep/glance then if you spot nobody, go towards the nearest Gen (or Gen you know ppl were working on). Survivors tend to hide behind gens or in lockers when they know its a Leatherface or suspect you have BBQ on,other killers. Allows all,of you points and an attempt to actually  play the game. Sure Survivors may never appreciate it or say thanks, but it does go a long way.  Just my opinion but playing Killer is like being a parent and the Survivors are kids.
---
I hade a decent amount of people message me about my spirit scarring the shit out of them when she pops up on‚Äôem.
---
Like when I said I was rank 8 and you reply ‚ÄúThanks for telling me your rank and proving that you are new‚Äù
---
&gt; I am sorry you have to experience anger like this
---
thank you, honestly i had my fair share of battle with depression so maybe it gets to me more than it should.
---
&gt; my own theory on how it got so bad is is that Alot of people from the player base only know of this game from a couple of Streamers, and those streamers weren't the nice kind either.
---
that does make sense,it's an interesting social aspect of it.
---
Truthfully I think the most toxic games I've ever played were Halo 3 ranked and Modern Warfare 2
---
Why NSFW?
---
funny you say that i used to play competitive cod4 and casual mw2-3 and never had anything close to this.
---
But it's not grindy. Use your streamers, use shit like wglf and youll be fine. There's a reason the game isn't perma 2x bp, because that would make it too easy. They want you to play during the events
---
Feng's smile is so cringe btw.
---
Swamp and Yamaoka, also Lerys
---
Can we get a re roll on ghostface, just call it a mulligan and add PINHEAD Damnit lol been waiting for his ass, ghostface is a normal guy in a mask, I didn‚Äôt like him when he was the legion
---
Oh yeah. I don't care about your rank. Nobody does
---
&gt;Just my opinion but playing Killer is like being a parent and the Survivors are kids.
---
well thank you i will definetly do that! so far im letting some survivors go so i go down in rank since the more high i go the more toxic it gets but maybe its just a placebo effect
---
Yeah but that is not some external force of nature, we as survivors 3-gen ourselves lmao
---
The shrine is unreliable. It only refreshes once a week and it might not even have what you want. I suppose you could buy dupes for bp but some people may want to save their iridescents for cosmetics. Idk why you're so opposed to getting bloodpoints easier.
---
Oh dude MW2 was the worst for me lol. Granted I would talk a looooot of smack to intentionally rile people up because I was a teenager that thought trolling was just the funniest shit ever, but I got sooo many of those types of messages. I didnt even talk shit in Halo 3, I just played at like rank 45 in Swat and people took that shit so incredibly seriously, if they lost and down ranked it was like you killed their pet.
---
Yeah, I get that. But killers solely receive the 110% movement speed if they have quick catch up abilities, anti looping tactics, or ranged attacks. Huntress is 110 because she can throw hatches. Hag is 110 because she can essentially instantly teleport over to a survivor when it‚Äôs triggered. Spirit has 110 because she can phase directly over to survivors with little predictability to her actions. Nurse has 90 because of the fact she can instantly warp to your position and get a hit.
---
Billy on the other hand, while he can quickly cruise to generators and apply a healthy map pressure, he still needs to **catch** you. He can‚Äôt just war over to you, or phase over. His chainsaw is risky in the chase because if you bump into something you‚Äôve completely fucked yourself over.
---
He has the movement speed he does because there are situations where your chainsaw is entirely unusable in a situation, requiring you to essentially m1. And m1‚Äôing at 110% movement speed is a twisted torture no person should endure
---
A lot of it is also a self-perpetuating cycle I feel. As more people play toxic, the other side starts playing toxic because they just want a fucking win. I say this from both the survivor and killer perspective.
---
sacrificing is part of 1 category, but hits and hooks are also part of that category. You could sacrifice all 4 survivors but only have hooked them all 1 time and do shit because you‚Äôre not satisfying the other aspects of the category.
---
Lol. This happens to me too often.
---
shit that's rough, are you from na,emea or asia? im from emea and now i see people from all over the world so maybe i was used to a different type of shittalking?
---
