So by ‚Äúsweaty‚Äù you mean.. playing the game?
---
---
---
Nothing wrong with the lore.
---
"The killer didn't let me escape, what a sweaty fucker!!"
---

---
People like you should get permanently banned. Entitled beyond belief.
---
thanks, I assumed they went on a seperate list
---
Cool art
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Pretty nice actually! I'm almost P2 myself and I won't stop until I get the full pack and the build I like.
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
PS. Love the censor. That's so groovy.
---
Congratulations, you played yourself.
---
Once a teachable id unlocked it should save forever
---
Thank you! B-)
---
are you a man of ace in the hole shrine and plunderer's instinct too?
---
because holy shit i have gotten a boatload of hatch escapes with this perk combo, it's so much fun
---
I agree, being able to bring stuff to the match that counters your opponent is unfun and should be removed. Nothing should have any counterplay. The fact that exhaust addons have a chance to be completely useless waste of an addon slot isn't enough; survivors everywhere are temporarily losing get out of jail free cards!
---
And then that one totem you didn't get was NOED and the killer says, "Lol clean totems noobs."
---
When Lunar event ended, my Kate had an empty slot (and I was with an offering equipped before)
---
The biggest power of the killer is the brain actually, because you have to know how to use your power, survivors have to run, just. Killers can't only M1, survivors can run straight lines
---
Not sure why I zoomed in to read this. I knew he was an idiot.
---
If it doesn't say Licensed chapter, they are original killers.
---
Self care.
---
Oof I hope to never have to survive with you. You are really actually mad about people just playing the game?
---
I can‚Äôt tell if this is bait, and I really hope it is 
---
Hmmm agree to disagree, it feels written like 14 year-old girl Slenderman fanfic, some of it really gives me second hand embarrassment. I don't think it's a creative issue, mostly a writing/syntax one. 
---
Where the fuck is my girl Kate?
---
Please stop attacking me 
---
                  Sincerely, big brain Meg main 
---
then maybe they should go play another game if they're going to pout and throw a fit they got downed and hooked and the killer doesn't play by some rules they decide to make up on how they think killers should play. 
---
If you're that much of a fucking baby you're just going to kill yourself on hook rather then punish the killer for camping allowing your team to escape.. then maybe don't play a fucking Team obj PVP game you selfish cunt. 
---
It‚Äôs hard to remember when your triggered and just wanna get the fk out of that hell hole. I‚Äôve forgotten many times. 
---
Good one
---
I saved a meg yesterday and who ever was playing ran across the map just to be healed. The killer was no where near the hook.
---
Taking a hit doesn't necessarily mean you're losing a chase though.. 
---
Scarlett was robbed
---
hey look on the bright side, at least they're not gonna nerf noed, ruin, rancor, devour hope, nurse, billy, any instadown, or literally any other killer perk that's strong :D too bad survivors cant say the same
---
Gen tapping takes longer than people who can actually power through ruin (and so many killers run it that there are tons of survivors who are capable of just hitting skillchecks.) Learn to cut off loops or run perks like SF that get rid of them, or otherwise don't complain about survivors using their one defense against killers lol. NTM if someone's "just trolling" by running around loops, they aren't on gens. I'll give you that people who sit at the gate to teabag are shitheads though.
---
Also looping and bodyblocks are not exploits, learn to look down or stop being afraid of getting free hits on people.
---
I'm a terrible killer, but I've hooked high rank SWF players before (it only took like 3 damn gens tho)
---
That's what I thought, just wasn't sure if it treated shrine perks differently. never know with their weird code
---
Wait to stick with the bait through the comments mate.
---
You can't alienate them too much at this point, they're BHVR's largest player demo and a serious money-maker for them, making them weaker or letting killers opt out would kill the game. 
---
@Joe Rogan
---
Even at rank 1 on PS4, nurse is one of the easier to deal with killers.
---
i mean, he could have gone for ace after the unhook if he wanted his stack... but he chose to go straight for me because i was injured. 
---
Honest question: do killers not realize how advantaged they are in 2v1 situations? 
---
"let's penalize people for having friends"
---
He‚Äôs honestly too hilarious to take seriously xD
---
Let me block killers with mori
---
Then make Jordan Peele for a purple cosmetic
---
That's second date signage! 
---
I was unaware that this was a meta communication method. Good to know!
---
They do, it's called consequence-free disconnects.

You almost never find garbage if you're running plunderers.

OP is a bit entitled but let's not hide behind The Power of Friendship, we all know it's the voice boosts that's frustrating and not having friends. 
---
Looping is as well
---
JRE
---
Not bad. Although at first glance, the B in Hillbilly looks more like a D.
---
Imo the game wouldn't survive without SWF. Ive played solo as well and many people have a tendancy to be more selfish when solo queing, plus I get very bored when I'm playing by myself (which is partly why I barely play killer)
---
*Way. And the post history says otherwise.
---
As a TOXIC Nea main i gotta say that only the urban evasion Nea‚Äôs blow up gens. We TOXIC players dont get the chance to do gens and when we do we ofc hit all the greats ;D
---
I mean you have me at any "BP bonus" at this point, i'd happily get blinded half the game if i get more bloodpoints that way (as someone who only got two characters to 50 so far).
---
Yeah they either need to buff the solo queue to SWF levels somehow(and killers accordingly), give players more BP, or make it a bit harder to downpip against them, maybe by treating the emblem system as a tier below what you're playing at. So if you're in purple ranks and playing against an SWF, pipping would consider you in green ranks. That might be controversial, but it would turn these extra frustrating matches into risk-free ones when you know you don't have to "try hard" to win or to not downpip. 
---
No ones gonna talk about that spirit... 
---
love the artwork, great job :) 
---
Proposed buff for him I thought of a few days ago.
---
Trapper starts with 5 traps, 5 others sit around the map as they do now.
---
Increased trap hitbox size, to prevent a SLIGHTLY offset trap from being worthless.
---
Trapper no longer triggers his own traps, seriously, why the hell does he trigger them? So fucking stupid.
---
Rework his bag add-ons to to compensate for the increased carried trap count.
---
A trapped survivor shouldn't be able to wiggle free. It makes traps across the map worthless as by the time you get to them, the survivor has already gotten out of the trap and has mostly likely sprint bursted away.
---
Rework honing stone since survivors can no long wiggle free.
---
These changes I think would bring trapper from dog shit to great in my opinion.
---
My guess its to farm, killer will get points for hitting survivors and survivors can heal each other but it could be just to derank.
---
Umm no dude that shit was funny!  He got out of it.  Downed me. Long story short I got hatch ..... later nerd
---
Plus there‚Äôs a very large range of definitions people have for camping and when/if they feel it‚Äôs allowed. For some camping is simply being within heartbeat range, and is never allowed, even if the exit gates are opened or you see their buddies running over. 
---
now id love to see the designs on those. Do you have examples of what theyd look like? dm them to me
---
Except the P3 or Rank 1-5 Nurses....oh god you might as well lay down and take the ass beating. üò≠üíî
---
I played a match on the carnival map earlier and two people legit just stood on this rock where you can‚Äôt hit them from the ground. I had to waste time finding a slop I could go up and wiggling back and forth to even be able to hit them.
---
I still don‚Äôt understand people getting upset at gen rushing. Finishing the generators is literally your obective.
---
it would really help if we could see other survivors loadouts
---
Holy crap I just realized something, If you kill the obsession and someone uses DS on you, they become the obsession right? *wink wink* *WINK WINK*
---
aka ‚Äúno one escaped mori‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs gonna be billy galore as if it wasn‚Äôt already. So many killers are just made even worse by this bullshit perk. 
---
Frank,this mixtape is fire
---
Mulan memes seem to be cropping up recently. This makes me very happy
---
I've seen people try and be slick and not heal up, after the fact or "99%" or whatever and eat a bowl of shit for it. It all boils down to the skill level of the survivors you're facing. You can get dicked on by a SWF group with literally no perks. It's an extra hit in a chase, bro.. I play killer, too.. It's really not that serious. It's manageable, and comparing an extra hit to a 5 second stun lock is kinda bullshit.. Just saying.. 
---
There‚Äôs something wrong with liking when a game is more than just a lobby, loading screens, and killing field? Excuse us for liking immersion and story telling. Nearly all games have at least a tiny bit. Effort was put into it, show some respect? Game would be a lot more boring with ZERO lore. 
---
Yes, and it does work exactly like that. Rancor is possible to stack kills with now, as rare as it is, it's definitely possible.
---
Did they send me freddies,when I asked, for plagues?
---
Part of me really wants to see someone get rescued off hook into hit immunity during unhooking, into borrowed time, into MoM, into adrenaline, into instaheal, into flashlight save and escape.
---
Dude, I really miss these hidden billy boy riots.

They were the finest content around here for a while

Funny enough, Freddy can‚Äôt even camp since you have to be put in sleep first anyway
---
It's a shitpost, buddy.

Very true. But honestly in the moment, the emotions outweigh the bps. 
---
The only downside is now instead of sugar all you have is salt.
---
This entire sub summed up in a few seconds 
---
I mean, he can still camp, it just will not be nearly as effective
---
On the bright side, camping lets you put two survivors to sleep, which technically is what you want anyway. 
---
Trash hacker/s
---
Yeah I just mean in the sense that camping killers typically want to stop the hooked survivor from getting off in the first place. Barring Insidious basement builds, which won‚Äôt work on Freddy anyway
---
I'd say he's probably referring to Spies. It can seem like cheating until you realize you found the 1 guys that actually uses it.
---
That's sounds bloody awful 
---
Original post? I've got 2 cents to contribute
---
&gt;then maybe they should go play another game if they're going to pout and throw a fit they got downed and hooked
---
This makes much more sense for players who get downed for the first or second time then decide to pull the plug while in the killers arms, but your exaggerated example makes no sense for a survivor who gets hooked then camped for the entirety of the match.
---
&gt;the killer doesn't play by some rules they decide to make up on how they think killers should play.
---
Who the hell said anything about imaginary rules or guidelines for how Killers should play? A Survivor simply killing themselves on the hook because they don't want to spend minutes upon minutes staring at their surroundings or the Killer's body *does not mean that they are making up anything regarding how the Killer should be playing the game.*  That's akin to saying that someone leaving an area because of their discontentment with whatever is going on is telling the person causing that discontentment how they really should behave.
---
\&gt;If you're that much of a fucking selfish baby you're just going to kill yourself on hook rather then punish the killer for camping allowing your team to escape...
---
I am **SO** sorry that I don't want to sit there staring at my character dangling from a meat hook while everyone else gets to wander the map, repair generators, destroy totems, loot, and assist each other because the Killer is keeping me here for the rest of the match until I am sacrificed.
---
The fact that you even went out of your way to insult me in a calm discussion over not wanting to sacrifice my time and enjoyment of the game to help the rest of you survive and get as many points and items as possible tells me that you are such a materialistic and conceited piece of shit, with his head so far up his own ass, that has no ability whatsoever to empathize with another person to understand how they may feel being removed from the game after being downed once by a Killer without any sort offering or perk for killing. What's worse is that you equated a camped survivor depleting their time on the hook to "pouting and throwing a fit because they got downed and hooked" as if we're pulling the plug like those people who leave before they are even scooped up or hooked.
---
&gt;...then maybe don't play a fucking Team obj PVP game.
---
Funny thing is that this is the only "Team obj PVP game" that allows a Killer to effectively remove one player from the entire match by just standing where they can be placed and rendered immobile because of the mechanics of this competitive, but I'll play whatever the hell I want, and if you are ironically this selfish and egotistical of a person, you should consider sticking to single-player games where the world is your oyster and other human beings won't cause you to throw a fit on Reddit because they don't want to sacrifice their fun for your sake.
---
the only thing is I think rod sterling would just end up competing with the entity for dimensional control 
---
The only time I've ever stabbed a survivor is because they have to move at that exact moment I get a skill check while I have make your choice. So I'm just like eff this I'm not going down cause you dumb. 
---
On a similar note, Insidious is crazy good as a gimmick on him. Put someone to sleep while they're near the hook, go Insidious on the hook, and watch as the sleeping survivor comes straight to you/the hook. Free hit or even grab if you're sneaky. 
---
And if they run away instead of unhooking, then you know and can act accordingly.
---
It really does.
---
Please don't be disheartened by the disconnects. The bugs are sometimes worse that you might expect. Twice, as soon I was hooked I was automatically disconnected from the game. I have no idea why, and I hate that it made look like a salty asshole. The only thing you can do is keep trying when people get disconnected. Don't give up the match because of them, work on your chase game. 
---
A well known fact. Can be used to grief teammates but can also sometimes be the best choice as sometimes you just gotta pop that generator ASAP
---
Similarly, anything a fully sick survivor interacts with becomes infected. 
---
The Survivors were never in even playing field. Their models, voices and textures already made them better or worse for different tactics. Male characters aren't really punished, since being seen, thus being chased, is something that a lot of people would prefer since it's easier to taunt the Killer that way.
---
A Tapp, for example, is much more useful for stealth than a Meg is, which can in turn be somewhat stealthy but still act like a bait for the Killer. Survivors were never the same and I think that takes a huge part on the decision of not having them to also act mechanically different (bonus base perks) as Killers do.
---
&gt; t's an extra hit in a chase, bro.. I play killer, too.. It's really not that serious
---
But it is. DS was a minor problem if it was hit in a dead zone because it wasted a few seconds, same as this. But if you land a hit that should down them and there‚Äôs pallets/windows it extends the chase and waste more of the killers time for literally zero reason. The only condition that has to be met for this perk to activate is for the killer to do what he‚Äôs supposed to do and hit the survivors. It‚Äôs a punishment for playing the game. 
---
In a 1v1 scenario it‚Äôs not that big of a deal, it‚Äôs strong but not game breakingly bad. Put this on 2, 3, or 4 survivors and it just racks up the time they have to spend away from gens and in a chase. And I‚Äôm someone who plays 70-80% survivor and hasn‚Äôt even played killer since this perks release and can say it‚Äôs bullshit. This perk just straight up nerfs already weak killers when if anything it should do the opposite. 
---
Yeah i think it's both, basically afk deranking and bp farming, they just macro their m1
---
It‚Äôs an open comment section and opinion, pal. 
---
I've only been playing since December, did people DC a lot during that event? 
---
They already did hide them better.  There is nowhere on the map that exists where people won't learn the spawns after a few games,  most players have hundreds of matches on most maps.  There is literally nowhere to hide them better than they are now.
---
all tall killers are same height (except billy and clown)
---
all average killers are same height (except hag)
---
all male survivors are same height
---
all female survivors are same height
---
these images are just rescaled

Just have to swap Adren and MoM in the order, since MoM won't activate from the deep wound state

---
I'm but Quentin looks weird in this comic. 
---
Yes, trapper is one of the most fun killers and right now he's the most killer I play because he's just soo fun. But my god he's weak and needs a huge buff asap
---
Not a joke about inserting dominance? ü§î
---
This would be horrible. It would shake the meta for sure but survivors would almost never get to the exit gates. Not to mention the m1 simulator... just no. 
---
[Btw](https://i.imgur.com/N2rzz6A.png)
---
I agree with this statement.  Most of the lore is painful to read.
---
What is this glitch? How are there 4 killers together 
---
If you let survivor block Legion, Omegablink-Nurse, Insta-Saw Billy or Prayer Beads Spirit, then we can do that. 
---
Agreed, what if they reworked it to some kind of anti-camping perk.  Like being more than so 32M or 40M away gives some kind of benefit like decreased hook time.  IDK seems kinda weak, but an interesting idea.  Or maybe like the killer receives 5%/7.5%/10% faster movement speed while a survivor is on the hook and they are more than 32M away or something like that.
---
His profile picture I think I went against him and his friends with legion and let‚Äôs just say something similar happened to me.
---
Quentin is nowhere to be seen in this comic!
---
Hide a lot. People need to think of Legion as a good Nurse. You can't run from a good Nurse and you certainty can't run from a semi-competant Legion. You need to play slower and much more sneakily to survive against them. 
---
This does not apply to bad Legion players that somehow get looped for more than 45 seconds at a time. 
---
Someone not being straight doesn't mean they're being sexualized. He's wearing a cosmetic from the game so... blame the game!
---
In his lore, there's nowhere where it specifies he's straight so we have freedom to choose what we want to.
---
Yea, if they don't have it by then this game will die.  Not saying they need it day 1 the servers go live, but if they don't fix that and the que time within the 1st month, this game is gonna fall apart (it's already starting to)
---

---
The lore in a video game or anything in general makes the game (or anything) much more interesting ~~(depending on how well executed and detailed on the lore, but some lore still makes the game/movie/book/etc interesting in some way or other)~~
---
New Rework = Can't be looped anymore if you get stuck in a pallet. 
---

---
Those numbers are way too wild. The bonus % perks and skill checks are alright currently, and 2 minute 40 for a single gen is utterly ridiculous.
---
If something like this was implemented everyone would run gen perks just so the games don't last 40 minutes each.
---
Some other things worth thinking about are that a killer could just facecamp every survivor they catch and almost guarantee a 3k, or that about by the time you hit the late game, there would be no pallets left on the whole map.
---
If anything should be changed, it should just be a small extension to gen times, not something crazy like doubling it.

---
This post brought to u by the leatherface gang 
---
The comparison is made because it punishes the killer for playing how they are supposed to. And it‚Äôs not necessarily a game changer on its own like I said. Even if one person pairs it with dead hard and an insta heal and 99s their heal (which will become a common sight once enough people get around to getting ash and leveling him up) makes it a big problem, especially at high ranks since not everybody and their mother is going to get to red ranks now. It‚Äôs a build that I‚Äôve already moved to using because I know I can use it to give everyone time to do gens because I can waste so much of the killers time. 
---
&gt; And again, there are plenty of killer perks that reward you for nothing
---
And some of those are bullshit too. But killers are playing a 1v4 in a game where they are already pressed for time and can get away with perks like that since the impact won‚Äôt be felt as heavily. Outside of NOED I can‚Äôt think of a perk off the top of my head that will punish survivors for doing their job which would be the gens. This game may not be as heavily sided towards survivors like it used to be (and in general is generally pretty balanced imo) but the game is still really in the survivors hands against killers that aren‚Äôt top tier. And now they get a perk that helps them control the game even more against killers that aren‚Äôt top tier just to make the disparity between them that much worse. 
---
fukin entitled baby killers. i'd gladly get swf of 2, 3, 4, hell even 4 rank 1 tournament people. i just want to play a game, please. it doesn't let me. any swfs that want to do kyf plz hmu, please, i beg you, i need to kill.

They just wanted that totem. It's bad, but their perseverance is respectable.
---
It's smart in certain situations. I usually don't camp, however, I had a game yesterday were a survivor was pissed that I camped them at the end of the game when the gens are done. Some survivors act like you're supposed to take them off the hook and let them skip to the exit lmao.

that, fukin that. i only cleanse if i'm dead on hook or after gens are done.

Man this was satisfying to watch. I‚Äôm a solo survivor main, just started playing killer, and have exclusively gone up against teams like this in my first matches. I know I just need to git gud but it‚Äôs very discouraging. 
---
trapper not having to run around the map to pick up his traps isn't a "small QOL update" but I agree he needs it. no sense in hag having 10 debatably stronger traps that she can set at any time and trapper having to go and pick his up
---
I've played nurse on console and been decent, but it's definitely miles harder than it should be due to what the others said, the frame rates and lack of fine control when using the joystick make it incredibly hard to be accurate. The lack of optimization means you also have to be better at predicting survivors than on pc as you're working with data slightly further back.
---
Lol
---
Oh my god yes! That would be awesome! We could have Henry bemis as the survivor!
---
Aw thank you! I appreciate ya ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
The entity converted him. 
---
That's dumb. Both d/c'ing based off the killer, and d/c'ing based off the perks. You should get banned for dropping the game and ruining it for the other 4 players ESPECIALLY the survivors that had to wait a long ass time just to get into the game.
---
It's a frustrating feeling when map generation fucks you hard enough that it basically comes down to luck whether you can get the ball rolling in time. It's especially frustrating when you decide to queue as a fun killer with no map control and get a map roll that you *know* would be way more manageable as nurse/billy/spirit.
---
I don't blame survivors for gen rushing, though; as you said, it's their objective. I blame BHVR for the design leading up to it. The game isn't nearly as disgustingly survivor favored as it was on release, but there's still some serious jank.
---
(that said, I do totally blame survivors that REE in postgame when they die to noed, as though they don't have totem cleansing as counterplay)
---
This has happened to me a couple times, though as a killer instead of a survivor. In my defense, I only hooked them for the points, kept moving away and giving the others time to unhook them, and half the time they just kill themselves. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
---
I guess I never thought that ALL of them would wait around just for the post-game chat; I'd think they'd just quit out and try to look for a new lobby right away. Never played against people *that* petty. 
---
I agree with the idea of the true rank. Last season I got to rank 2 as a new player, which didn't make sense to me coming from other competitive games. This season it's more difficult so I have to improve. :) It was definitely too easy before.
---
I find it so funny when the killer turns around to look into the camera at the end of the game lol
---
hmm nah I don't think it'd work that way. I kinda think Rod might end up a survivor because of the kind of guy he was

Another Killer here. I'm used to people simply NOT rescuing Survivors at all when I'm trying to convince everyone to farm. I give them space, I go to the other side of the map, they still won't rescue the poor thing. Survivors, amirite.
---
The Entity is just trolling at this point.
---
David is taller than Dwight?
---
Someone edit a survivor pic with pethetic like that simspons meme one
---
 The Knife addons are supposed to make the mend take longer by a determinated amount of time. But right now it is glitched, and is adding that amount for each hit.
---
For example, you are using Filthy Blade and hit a survivor once, it will take the x amount that Nasty Blade increases + mend time. Normal.  
---
But if you hit the survivor twice, it will take double the Filthy Blade time + mend time.  
---
After 20 hits, for example, it takes 20x Filthy Blade time + mend time. No matter if the survivor has mended inbetween those hits.  
---
I'm not sure about the exact amount that Filthy Blade increases, but presuming it is 5 seconds, 5 hits would increase the mend time by 25 seconds.
---
If you could please not use it for a while, please don't. The devs must fix this asap because it makes playing against Legion with the addon impossible.
---
&gt;No points for you.
---
Lol that's not how it works unless you d/c at the beginning of the game. And it's almost guaranteed that you're gonna be the one waiting for a new match far longer than survivors are. 
---
Dcing still gives survivors points üòÇüòÇ dumbass. 
---
All you do is lose points and also lmao, you guys have noed, mori's etc. 
---
The legion is uncounterable, the plague is uncounterable, youre either always 1 hit or you get practically instadowned by corrupt purge. 
---
Killer mains are such whiney baby pussies. 
---
I play both, woo you gotta hit someone 1 extra time. Oh my god the world is ending! A chase is dragged on for an extra whole 2 seconds. Oh my god the game is ruined
---
Welcome to the DBD community. Take my hand, I shall be your guide ‚úã 
---
I‚Äôm moist
---
Always gotta make everyone seem gay :/ 
---
Perhaps the way to lower *yourself* out of tier four would be to go through a Twisted Door. Doing so would require you to find the right one, and it's worth mentioning that the Killer always knows which two doors are correct- and perhaps if Tier 4 is reached, he can wait on the other side. But if the Survivors call his bluff, he'll just be wasting his time. 
---
As for Revival, how about this- the hooked Survivor is unaffected. However, the unhooked suffers from **Broken** permanently until the next time someone is hooked, including themselves. Also, if the unhooker is healthy, Broken won't take effect until they're hit once. They're not *exposed.* 
---
And yes, the idea is for Survivors- especially newer players, to not have any clue what is happening. Imagine looking at your HUD and suddenly there are 4 generators left- but you were at 3 thirty seconds ago. And then you're told someone is hooked, then moried- but 20 seconds later, they *revert* back to healthy. In reality, you're now at 2 generators, and no one was *ever* hooked. It's like Doctor on steroids. 
---
Hex: Pethetic   when?
---
With some killers you just will not pip without ruin at red ranks with the new system. 
---
This is why I feel like killers shouldn‚Äôt have collision for occasions like this.
---
I commend you cause I definitely do agree with you that it‚Äôs interesting. I‚Äôve been trying to relearn nurse after about six months of not playing her
---
Always a Meg.
---
Yeah I'm going to be honest, its shit like this that makes me wonder why people mostly complain about toxic survivors... yet more often than not i deal with toxic killers than toxic survivors... and the few toxic survs i deal with all body block and troll their own team

I mean we knew Feng Mice is the shortest but at least she's cute, her squeaky voice aside. 
---
Imagine being fugly like Dweeb and also being the shortest guy too.
---
The plague is uncounterable? 
---
Since when? For you playing ‚Äúboth‚Äù, you‚Äôre incredibly low ranked if you think the plague can‚Äôt be countered. 
---
Oh dear lord 
---
i used it against Freddy and played Freddy against MoM. nothing op. 
---
Not much point DCing if you're about to die
---
Legion is the best killer, which is why he has a 90% 4k rate!  
---
  
---
Oh wait no, he's at best mid tier.
---
You forgot DH.
---
f in the chat, pals
---
Ive been a rank 1 survivor and a rank 5 killer, easy bloodpoints. 
---
The plague, if you give her power, the whole team is screwed an if you dont cleanse, you might aswell have no mither. Plague needs no skill whatsoever. 
---
Trust me, we Trapper mains are *always* hungry for guests at our Basement parties, and we throw the best ones. We threw 'em right before Leatherface ever came along. 
---
Yes
---
Guess that shows rank really doesn‚Äôt matter. 
---
‚ÄúIf you give her power.‚Äù Like momentum? Or like corrupt purge? 
---
i hope they'll also do that hatchets, chainsaws, corrupt purge count cause to be fair MoM is very useless against Huntress, Billy and Plague and these killers are strong enough to take the extra hit. especially Huntress and Plague. 
---
the fact that Pig's charge doesn't count is weird since post-phase and post-uncloak hits count and they are deviousness too. 
---
Head on not working
---
How does a meme build break the game
---
Ikr lmao. Survivors just troll eachother and fuck eachother over. 
---
Ive been in so many games where ive done 3gens or 4 by myself an get hooked once an they tbag me and leave me lmao
---
I also just now found out that there is a BP limit, it maxes out at 32k per match apparently.
---
I would definitely like some sort of exclusively indoor map like the Game. That's a unique concept but I'd honestly also like it to be both indoors and a healthy dose of wide open *and* with many chokepoints depending on the floor. 
---
Unless you die before you find a box
---
haha i played a game as nurse for the first time and only got one hook , sadly no pip :(
---
Sneaky piggy!
---
The puke charge time is fine lmao, you dont even need to charge it fully to use it and it shoots far and you can rarely ever dodge it. 
---
And the whole team is screwed because then everyone is easily downed and with the regular purge its fine cause you still get 1 shot if you dont cleanse and chances are, she will puke on you enough to get the 1 hit an then just down you. 
---
The instaheal on cleanse doesnt matter when she can take the corrupt purge and down you in 5 seconds or less lol 
---
Press the big black pad in the middle if your controls are inverted 
---
Jeez
---
Didn‚Äôt read what I said. Puke charge time is different from puke timer. 
---
If you get hit within 5 seconds of her getting corrupt purge you‚Äôre probably bad at the game. 
---
Which is unfortunate because you can tell they have a passion for this. It's just in all the wrong places. The game is so unstable to the core that whenever a bug or problem occurs it really cuts deep. And then we have to wait 6 months for a game breaking bug or such alike to be handled. I'm still upset with Legion and it's unacceptable he's just been left untouched despite how clearly absurdly broken he is.
---
It's less precision (at least with the current dumpster truck hitboxes) and more about framerate making it so that if you blink and turn you are single digits until the Claudette runs into the cornfield.
---
Also ps4
---
Her timer is fine aswell. 
---
And thats most randoms, they get downed so fast. 
---
Then if she finds you with corrupt purge, its over lol 
---
*Legion intensifies*
---
i just hate not being on red ranks. rank 9 atm and it's disgusting. people don't play properly, killers either too good for my teammates or facecamp/tunnel me the whole game so obviously i don't pip. rare people of same experience and all of them i know from red ranks cause they also got cucked by new system and also just float around rank 9-6. i'm a solo unimmersed survivor, i like helping my teammates, tanking hits, breaking chases and hiding, totem hunting. i'm not the best in chase but i know how to unhook safely and 99% of time i run BT. i know how to do gens properly to not get stuck with 3 gens up close. but my teammates of non-red ranks constantly cucking me. i never complained being on rank 1. please, i just wanna go back to my efficient killers and teammates who can be in chase for over 30 seconds and not dc on hook before first gen pops D: 
---
More salt than the Dead Sea!
---
Only 2? Shit, these bastards are a regular occurance lol. I don't know how people have fun camping. üòÇ
---
This crossover kills me 
---
I love to run Spies From the Shadows now because as a Killer with a more smaller terror radius that shit is deadly. No one expects it.
---
I kinda want to see that as well, but I would not wish that evil on anyone 
---
What's with all the heart locket memes?
---
Oh! Would you mind explaining what you mean so I can improve?
---
With her hitboxes, if you‚Äôre around a loop, you beat the plague. 
---
She is still loopable. 
---
Love the amazing art style! Hate that we're missing it in game.
---
That‚Äôs not camping, they are bodyblocking the staircase and holding the game hostage lmao
---
Those aren‚Äôt fair perks. Those aren‚Äôt fair at all.
---
Xbox one? 
---
Pathetic
---
No I play PS4
---
Ah. Was gonna say.. I've met him. He's a downright savage.. LoL.. 
---
Smol Feng
---
You are 9 hours late
---
go afk directly behind them for your evader emblem so you don't depip. this doesn't just hurt killer rank.
---
me and a couple of friends got 4 people banned cause they were camping, sooo..doubt? i don't think so. :)
---
Luckily I was farming with the last survivor while all of this went down. Had I been trying to play seriously with them constantly spamming ‚Äùpethetic‚Äù, it would‚Äôve been another story.
---
That was my thought exactly.
---
Yea this perk is more of an average perk considering all the counters it has and considering it can only be used once per match, it‚Äôs definitely not OP.
---
Lmao that google search fekin killed me ü§£ I got blocked by a wraith once too but he was a good sport about it so we just laughed it off ü§£
---
If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, what was your experience?
---
And my dad actually worked with McCote when they were developing DBD!
---
^proof ^needed ^because ^nobody ^will ^believe ^you
---
Sure. 
---
And for each survivor who DC‚Äôs, the killer gets a stackable 10 minute base ban. Because he most likely played like a camping, slugging, tunneling dirt bag. 
---
People DC from games that are made unfun by cheap and easy killer play styles that are over rewarded in terms of bloodpoints. They choose not to play by those rules. 
---
Get over it. 
---
Seems more like 4% chance to free from the hook not be away from the killer
---
Ugh, what a bummer.  Thank you for letting me know though!

I think it's fine. But that might draw some questions from people about why he wouldn't use it on the *Killer.* But Kate has a costume where she's got a pair of hatchets, and nobody complained then. 
---
&gt;Free escape = ds
---
Old DS, yes. New DS, not really.
---
&gt;Free hook escape = deliverance 
---
Its not free. They need to get a safe unhook before their first hook and they are broken for 60 seconds at the least after they deliverance. 
---
&gt;Free hit immunity = mettle of man
---
Its not ‚Äúfree‚Äù. You need to get hit by a basic M1 3 times.
---
&gt;Prewiggle meter by recovering = new perk (can't remember name)
---
You need to get slugged to only get half the progress of your meter. Awful perk.
---
Am I the only one who thinks Nea‚Äôs cute? ‚òπÔ∏è
---
I think it's cute too! :)
---
this is why the killers in the game are a joke, cause of op perks and not being able to see someone downed lol
---
what do you mean? cause i mean a chainsaw hit count as a hit on MoM and only if you're injured you don't go down by chainsaw when MoM is active. i find it very annoying that already strong killer doesn't get a counter with a pretty strong perk but this strong perk influencing less strong killers. that's just really unfair like BBQ on Billy. if you're slugged on the other side of a map and there's a hatch and your buddy is dying on the hook, Billy can get to you faster than any other killer(but maybe Omega Blink Nurse) and 8/10 times you're cucked from a hatch. no other killer will get there in time unless the guy dc in dying animation. 
---
Yeah maybe 130,145,and 160 seconds
---
No twisty the clown? With his bowling pins? 
---
this fanart gave me aids
---
The fact that allowing an extra hit is such a huge problem for killers that they actually have to switch is sad. I've already played matches with m1 killers with at least 3 survivors running MoM. Want to know what happened? Like 2 people even got to use it because the other two were either never chased or weren't hit enough for it to activate. 
---
Audio Bug on PC.
---
Playing against the Plague. She had one perk - Infectious Fright and no addons.
---
Her terror radius would spontaneously go off at deafening volume.
---
At least one other survivor playing in the match had this also.
---
I think it‚Äôs pretty dark because it‚Äôs a reference to when he tried to commit soup of side
---
Now show us how you drink it
---
You can keep calling it a bluff, but you are sitting here defending camping, I mean you are no better than the literal lag-switcher trash that is playing DBD, so check yourself for a second.
---
And we didn't "exploited the system" we report people being toxic, camping (which is part of toxicity) and various of other VALID reasons just like anyone else would, maybe you should ask the devs who are banning these salty kids.
---
I can't tell you how many messages we get from the people that DOES get banned and how much they want to throw the hack-card at us, lol, it's quite sad to see.
---
Anyways, I'm not here to change your opinion, you can keep calling me a bluff and be delusional, and I'm not here to prove that I'm right to anyone. :) cya xo
---
What can I say? I prefer them fit. /shallow
---
It's fine. It'll get nerfed into the ground 
---
No you didn‚Äôt lol. Devs have even said that you can‚Äôt get banned for camping 
---
Legion=dc,a lot of name calling,and typical toxic entitled survivor treatment 
---
How you gonna put Jeff like three columns above Dwight that is just disrespectful. 
---
Tbh i just expected you to edit the "just fuck my shit up, fam" eyes in, didn't know his model even had eyes though
---
Don't think so. 
---
I've had that happen with a queued up chainsaw bubba. Until dead harded past him and left my nea there to meet her maker.. see ya nerds.
---
I like you
---
Same thing happened to me on PC, albeit as Huntress. 3 guys DCd on their first downs and the last guy (the toxic one) acted like hot shit because what would've been the winning hit didn't register for some weird reason. He kept going onto my Steam profile and made himself look "pethetic". Got tired of it and just blocked him and purged his comments, pitied him more than anything, lol. Don't know why he was so set off. Was a weird mix of self-righteousness and being pissed at me for killing his friends.
---
this gave me aids in 5 different spots on my ass
---
Feels bad about Claudette
---
As much as I love nea, she looks like the hags cousin 
---
Change things? It's like a weaker version of DC. Killers are just exaggerating because any perk that's even slightly good they attempt to get nerfed. 
---
*notices how Wraith was replaced* Look at how they massacred my boy...
---
Yah I get games every now and then on PS4 like this, look for the pole where the lights would be! The other day my HUD wouldn‚Äôt come up after loading In, the camera did a weird pan as we came into the game. got stuck with the Name of the map on my screen the hole game, it was the school map, can‚Äôt remember the damn name of it right now! But anyways I had to gen tap and heal tap because I couldn‚Äôt see the skill checks. The one by one my teammates met the 3rd hook, I was on my 2nd hook and I managed to finish the last gen and escape thru the gate and the other guy got the hatch. Can‚Äôt believe I made it out alive! 
---
Perfect list, but I'd move Jane up for that THICCness and claudette down 
---
Dwight is too much man for you to handle. 
---
I've met a couple of really good nurses on console but I think they had xim
---
Lol yah like that will ever happen BHVR is full of shit and are not handing out console bans! Maybe when we get dedicated servers it might happen but till then they are all bark and no bite! I did the prestige glitch on my work account with a few survivors and no ban! 
---
Highly doubt youre lgbt lol
---
(From the samanation videos) CAMPER!!! Lol 
---
People dc for being the first one downed or if you're lucky, they're the obsession and will wait until their second down to dc. Your weak mental doesn't excuse you making the round shitty for everyone else, grow up.
---
Hot topic just had a huge sale 
---
Thanks 
---
If she has more than 2 blinks, she's not a solid nurse 
---
Whoa whoa whoa, I'm a killer main and I'm perfectly fine with mettle. Granted yes, it's annoying but there are plenty of annoying killer perks as well.
---
Not to mention killer mains hold no more weight on what devs do than survivor mains do, this isnt a democracy here.
---
Jeff is actually attractive even with his beer belly.
---
I believe it makes a loud noise indicator only if you sprint away from the chest, if you stop searching slowly it still makes the shutting sound effect but doesn't make the indicator.
---
wtf are you doing in that chase if you have to hit them over 4 times, even with MoM. The only instance of that happening is if they somehow have like 3+ different perks go off on them at the perfect time with maybe an insta heal thrown in there, at that point you misplayed as killer somewhere down the line for that to happen.
---
also why just Nurse/Huntress? There's 7 killers (not counting Nurse since she's bugged) who can harm you with their power, i.e. not give you stacks at all and 2 killers who have forms of skipping health states with their power. Another thing is MoM is an obsession perk so Rancor is another option to the other exposed perks I mentioned.
---
literally how is the perk broken outside of because it works in some situations? You're acting like all of a sudden you'll have to hit all 4 survivors like 5 times in every single chase because there's just one more perk that helps them in a chase when there were already others that are either less situational, more reliable, and multiple use at times.

They can do whatever they want since it isn't tangible property. It doesn't follow the same laws as say for example something you buy at a store. Sure the company can use a recall notice and you don't have to return it. They can't make you. But digital property is rented property. You own the right to use it but you don't own it. It isn't tangible and they can remove, replace, alter and change as they see fit without your permission. These are things you actually agreed to in their new terms of service.

**Platform:** PC
---
**Type of Bug:** Ingame
---
**Description:** When having the requirements for mettle of man achieved, but after being broken by plague's power, mettle of man will be used despite not getting hit or injured. 
---
**Screenshot / Video:** N/A
---
**Steps to reproduce:** In my specific case I was infected but not broken, hooked with mettle of man equipped, then unhooked with adrenaline so I had full hp, but mettle of man was used when I became broken due to running. The plague hit me and I was downed.
---
**Expected result:** Mettle of man is used when hit by a killer's basic attack
---
**Actual result:**  Mettle of man was used without being hit by the killer
---
**Reproduction rate:** Probably 100%
---
**System Specs (PC only):** N/A
---
Try circling the entire goddamn map, cleansing every last FUCKING DULL, and then spending a good 5 minutes looking for the lit totem afterwards before finding it literally behind a wall behind the gens you spawned next to
---
Played a game vs a farming Legion as David a while ago and I remember noticing just how tiny Legion (Frank, specifically) was compared to David in both height and build. Made me feel like David could just beat Frank's ass in a straight fight.
---
Basically you need to input the rushed exit while the killer is in range of the locker's swinging doors, your character will jump out with their arms covering their face and the killer will be stunned even if they go a large distance away. If you jump out without covering your face that means you either jumped out too early or too late.
---
Same. I got yelled at by my friends because once I did that all day and we only seemed to get Myers games. They said I cursed the game and we'd have to uninstall.
---
Lol that‚Äôs funny
---
And thats why you set profile to friends only =P
---
Real fun is Mint Rag hag with that setup.   They keep going for it, you keep getting the warning to jump em (Full time it takes to cleans a totem is long enough for Mint Rag to fully come off CD even if you had used it the instant they started the cleanse), you keep getting free grabs.  They have to attack 3 totems at once to break one of them unless they have someone running a flashlight.
---
Meg should be top tier. 
---
Ive alreadynheard it but i love this song. 
---
a survivor perk is good, so we need to change it.
---
I understand the wraith if he's doing it to stop Borrowed Time (because if you go for a basement save right fucking there he's gonna know you have it) or is in the process of uncloaking, but not if he's just standing there. 
---
No one thinks that or says that. The issue is that the development team refuses to add new objectives. Giving the survivors 2 options run or gen. Hence the game is broken and pointless since instead they add shit tons of OP things for survivors to make them way to good at running and getting gens.
---
Yeah, it's kind of ridiculous that it's on M1 powers; killers who only have M1 literally have no counter to this perk other than avoiding their obsession (hmm, just like the old DS.....) and hoping to God that none of the other three have it. That's ridiculous. 
---
that's fine but literally any person who doesn't want to get the cooldown will kill the game in task manager. that will only take few more clicks. or plug out/turn off wifi. ya feel me? that's not a solution. 
---
however it is a solution for de-ranking, so maybe a good idea but it won't fix the problem op and everyone else is talking about. 
---
His mask is loosely based of the Jack The Ripper creepypasta, it's not even intentional.
---
That's a lot of talking, come to think of it. 
---
Oh lawd, he comin. 
---
Right, well at least I know the animation difference now. Thanks, hopefully I can get it to work more often now. 
---
what are you talking about. What things have been added that makes survivors ‚Äútoo good‚Äù at running or doing generators.
---
I'm A rank 1 killer and a rank 5 survivor so get your facts straight
---
Practice makes perfect.
---
Pretty pathetic that you make a thread on reddit just to flex. Trust me not a single person here thinks you are good.
---
Love doing that so much. I either stare at it creepily, ringing the bell or nod to signal that I'm laughing my ass off. There are all sorts of things to do with the camera while a Survivor is being sacrificed it's hilarious. 
---
I don't see how they wouldn't be able to tell that you quit and went to a menu or quit because you truly disconnected internet wise. 
---
**Type of Bug:** In-game
---
**Description:** Spies from the Shadows does not work, at least not for Nurse. The timer will activate but there will be no visual indicator.
---
**Steps to reproduce:** To my knowledge just run Spies from the Shadows on Nurse. Can link the rest of my perks if steps prove ineffective.
---
**Expected result:** Visual notification from perk
---
**Actual result:** No visual notification
---
**Reproduction rate:** Should be 100%
---
**Specs:** N/A
---
Yes it does a Mace is what they used bud
---
Shaman Waluigi
---
Cool story bro.
---
I'm pretty sure the best cure for that is if everyone agreed to get the adept trophy for new survs first and only count it once you've actually used every perk in the match at least once, just to get a feel for how it's all supposed to work together. 
---
uuuh... because any person who doesn't want to get a cooldown will just manually unplug/turn off internet or kill the game in task manager. newsflash, pal, most people, i tell you hwat, do that to not lose their items and pips just about now.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Sorry for late reply, if that's what you would like, sure I can do gold. Reply and let me know :)
---
i really don't care enough to do that, fam. that shit is whack and whole world is going crazy as if it matters what people have between their legs. 
---
It counters tier 3.
---
This is how I can tell you literally never play killer. 
---
I was trying to farm points to get perks to have a memey no-blink Nurse to get my 1000th kill for the achievement, thought it'd be fun. At some point in that people just decided to not save each other when I was only 2 hooking and I lost the achievement to it so I 4kd them instead.
---
No need to distinguish - if your game actually crashes or you disconnect - by the time you get it all up and running again or reset your internet, its probably been at least 5 minutes so the wait isnt awful. If you are just dodging the game - 10 minutes can drag on. Overwatch doesnt discriminate - DBD doesnt have to either.

I actually have and it's easy. As I've said before, just swing through every pallet and you're guaranteed a hit almost every time. Really not hard playing killer right now. Especially when you have perks and killers that can easily stop loops. Bamboozle, enduring, brutal strength, clown, spirit, trap, hag, nurse.... 
---
idk what you mean i tryhard on nurse every once in a while on xbox one and i cant put some pc nurse mains to shame
---
It's great when you get hard tunnelled then the killer just decides to farm, like why be a dick like that? Especially when you're waiting on swf members.
---
Honestly whenever I'm just trying to have a chill game and hook a couple of times, if the other survivors leave them to die on hook, it instantly becomes a '0% chill yall let someone die when they weren't being camped and I'll kill all of you because of it now' game. 
---
Ever faced a swf group all armed with Brand New Parts? Thats a genrush. Put as a person who plays both equally I really find it harder to be a survivor but Im ok with that because its always 4v1. Team work makes the dream work. Im gonna put myself on the hook for that one. 
---
omg me
---
We'll ignore the logic of a short back rub fully healing someone from multiple stab/slash wounds.
---
God I love this glitch. I hope they never fix it. These games are simultaneously hilarious and scary lol. 
---
Well, that's a hot take.
---
Disconnecting as a form of protest, even about legitimate gripes, will mostly punish you as Killer, and is a really solid way to start eating your limited temp bans.
---
I guess it's not as bad as losing 2 of my teammates in the first minute because someone plays Legion, but you should probably sort yourself out and try to start a petition instead.
---
‚Äúpass the hook‚Äù
---
Yea, I‚Äôve seen many new killers complaining about being called a camper after they were camping without realizing what camping is.
---
Look, when you hook a survivor you‚Äôre supposed to go look for the others in order to gain momentum, if they‚Äôre all around the hook then it‚Äôs their problem, but if they‚Äôre not then you have no excuse to stay there.
---
also, you use noed so that just ensures me that you are indeed a camper.
---
And hitting a survivor off the hook is considered tunneling, you‚Äôre fucking billy you can instakill the unhooker, wtf are you doing? Complaining about ds and shit, god
---
Claudette squadette. Activate camouflage.
---
Your first sentence answered your own question
---
Myers displaying his dominance as usual.
---
Theres something worse then this. Farming with a killer then having him turn on you at then end and hooks you. Especially freddy bc hes a straight up dick to play against. I hope they never buff him. 
---
Only of they changed in this pach, which I highly doubt. In doubt, I recomend you to test in kill your friends. As a killer, never ever have I recieved a visual notification on chests
---
I haven't tested the perk out yet, nor do I have the means to at the moment. I've heard about it being buggy with certain killers and I just wanted to be sure :/
---
Now you PC players see what we have to deal with on ps4? Fuckin hell
---
Mettle of Man will only prevent a player from dying if they‚Äôre injured so as long as you expose and hit them at full health, Mettle of Man won‚Äôt kick in. 
---
Alright, I just wanted to be sure that I was understanding the perk correctly. Thank you!
---
Its like this forever. I got plenty of notifications from chests as killer. I recoomend you to test it in KYF, since I am 100% sure you get a notification.
---
I used to have a similar problem until I started using deliverance. I‚Äôd recommend deliverance + decisive so you can get yourself off the hook during the end game and make a break for it. If deliverance + dead hard isn‚Äôt enough, you still have decisive to get a little bit more distance
---
The perk isn‚Äôt necessarily buggy it‚Äôs just that the game considers things like ambush attacks and blink attacks to not be a basic attack, but rather an ability. With Myers, his tier three doesn‚Äôt change your weapon it just makes everyone exposed
---
If you buy with auric cells you don‚Äôt get a few shitty recolors but that‚Äôs about it. 
---
I would crap my pants 
---
More scary than Myers 
---
Yeah dogs are pretty cute 
---
Did they raise the price?
---
I say Myers fits both, he disappears and releases like nuts and Laurie didn't know he was there until toobpatemmm just like in game
---
Still my fav trailer,  simple and straight to the point 
---
That explains why the perk activated after a p3 Billy whapped my ass with his mallet then landed a window hit with his chainsaw. Dude was pissed.
---
Not what I said. But sure.
---
Nurse doesn't need to "rebound" from anything.
---
If you're even a decent nurse the game will ALWAYS be in your favor unless you make a million mistakes (in which case you weren't a decent nurse to begin with). 
---
It‚Äôs just the one shitty recollection actually 
---
I think people tend to forget that it‚Äôs only charging it up that‚Äôs effected by basic attacks only. Reason why in some cases, it‚Äôs better to just stay injured.
---
Oh wow so you don‚Äôt get a shirt+pants?
---
Survivors objective is to do generators. Your job is to stop them from doing that and sacrifice them. If you‚Äôre getting gen rushed, someone isn‚Äôt doing their job.
---
As a ps4 player, agreed
---
I mean another time you stab them could be as killer
---
It says in japanese by her something which means singing softly/humming :)
---
Dude is a jackass. Don't bother. 
---
I think they are talking about the other reindeered color
---
Dude noice, didu know the song she sings is about a wolf eating kids who sleep too close to the edge of their beds or something like that? 
---
Thanks. I‚Äôll try this combo. 
---
I did not, that is very cool!
---
https://youtu.be/8f8WYvAo-RA
---
Dont sleep in places ur not supposed to or too clos to the edge or he'll bite you
---
Yeah, Pumpkinhead is a pretty cool movie.
---
I would probably buy the dlc if it got released.
---
Thing is, designing a viable power would be a little tricky I'd imagine. Pumpkinhead just sort of appeared and killed people lol.
---
If you look deeper, the asshole will show himself.
---
Laurie is the most attractive female.
---
Jeff is the most attractive male.
---
So your list is wrong. 
---
I just grab Ash‚Äôs from gens with tier 1 mike. 
---
Are you really that upset at me for calling you out that you go search through my old comments to throw insults? 
---
Damn that wraith buff is pretty op
---
Oh I‚Äôm sure many will care if what you propose happens I for one think it should stay while ‚Äúrealism‚Äù is tricky a term in games it‚Äôs the entity‚Äôs realm it does what it wants in there so realism doesn‚Äôt exist there. Besides it‚Äôs not adrenaline that‚Äôs the problem it‚Äôs Freddy hence why a rework is needed.
---
I mean Myers killed right away in the movies 
---
(Unless it was Laurie) 
---
But the entity tells em what to do 
---
I used to save Xbox Live messages from Dark Souls 1 and 2, salty guys complaining about my invasions/build, saved them as trophies to show dominance.
---
This is an excellent example and you should be proud OP.
---
Look up vigo and Benedict baker on the dbd wiki, then come back
---
pethetic 
---
So that‚Äôs why she looks cut in half when crouched... 
---
They already added him? Who do you think the Doctor _really_ is?
---
Agreed, but there are a lot of small quality-of-life "why is this a thing?" changes that could be done to make the current edition of Freddy more tolerable.
---
On both sides. Like why can't I see Freddy's aura with Alert and other aura reading perks?
---
Or just don‚Äôt play Freddy ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
How about we just punish the people who use the quit option. I doubt everyone will turn off their internet to avoid it. Some will but it will cut down some.  
---
Leopard geckos are so darn cute 
---
Sheesh.
---
holy shit i thought i'm the only one.
---
well, i tried out different playstyles. with Shadow Adam i escape 7/10 times(3 being dead mid-game). he has BT(cause i always have it unless playing Ash), Iron Will, Self Care(i didn't run it before fucked up pipping, now i have to rely on myself more), Urban Immersion. bought that brown coat in store. he's really hard to find so if the gates are powered, no killer will find me unless i want them to. 
---
no other playstyle worked :D tried to be a jockey, they catch me endgame, tried to play like i normally do, they catch me endgame. just immersing endgame helped. no running, no opened spaces, just you, bushes, dark corners. watch the gates, see if someone opens or how killer checks those. very situational but you gotta be patient all the time or they will catch you.

---
I edited for clarity
---
Why would I not play my main
---
Ruin and BBQ are on **every** killers loadout as well, how about we nerf those as well? Or is it only survivor perks we're interested in nerfing? 
---
there's also task manager. 
---
it might cut down few but as i said, it won't fix the problem and this will be happening anyway. there is no point in cooldown
---
You do you my friend, sorry for being an ass 
---
The you start the chase again by dropping the pallet
---
The issue with Freddy is that the strengths of his power are not useful at high ranks while the weaknesses of his power are a major hinderance. Truth be told in the grand scheme of things Freddy is "balanced" but the spread of utility on his power is massively out of whack.
---
If you play r/Hearthstone the best analogy I can make is that Freddy is a [Magma Rager.](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Rager) For those of you who don't play Hearthstone Magma Rager is a "balanced" card in the sense that it has the average total stats for a card of its mana cost: 3 mana 6 total stats. The issue is that the spread of power for Freddy is massively out of line. He has 5 attack (his strengths at tracking and other such things) but only 1 health (his chasing ability.) Attack is important but if your minions die instantly they're completely worthless. Similarly tracking is great for Freddy but if you can't actually down a Survivor it's worthless.
---
im just really mad about killers giving the last guy hatch
---
I hate seeing the bad teammates get hatch just because they survived longest, but I'd much rather that then never get a free hatch again lol.
---
Removed for salty after game chat 
---
It‚Äôs a niche/meme build, but it‚Äôs fun when it works!
---
He somehow reminds me of slenderman when t-posing
---
you'r the biggest lump of cancer my fucking god
---
Kars, Wamuu and Esidici pop out and start posing*
---
No it‚Äôs because if you buy the dlc you will get the killer as well
---
Yikes
---
deliverance + DS, an amazing combo, I recommend running these perks 'cause they saved my ass so many times in the end game. i usually run Q&amp;Q/DWM + Lithe with those 2 perks to make enough distance between me and the killer without telling them my exact location.
---
There is a point maybe not for pc but for console. People don't dc like that on console. The point is it will cut down on it happening because dumb people wont unplug the internet. 
---
I mean they could add yhe mechanic back that closed it.
---
Is that all you got? Why arent you using bbq and chilli. It took me one day to get 1 million bp for ash with bbq
---
"I'm Freddy, what did you expect?" ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Lol get over yourself dude, accept the free points 
---
It makes sense but balance wise yeah it shouldnt happen
---
Honestly I have no problems 4 manning with freddy and see people playing him at rank 1 with 4 mans. I think he is a little weak but your suggestions are a bit much. I'd prefer a rework to the power overall. Could be more interesting and interactive.
---
i find that quite a lot of killers do this. as much as people complain about toxicity, i think we actually have a nice playerbase. you only notice the bad ones because they make themselves known.
---
Sounds like a normal day of Dead by daylight.
---
Why? Honestly??
---
That guys a nerd bubbas a chad pick
---
Just because of this i will start doing it more
---
&gt;waiting 20 minutes for a match
---
....I mean you might, survivor queues are fine. 
---
I agree the perk is kinda screwy against the weaker killers
---
Dude the sandbagging in this game is unreal
---
I understand if killer was farming but if it's because someone survived longer i hate it
---
Survivor main rant copy-pasted from a real Reddit comment. (Will not link do not want to start witch hunts.)
---
100% guarentee though? Damn that's quite the guarentee poggers. I also got a 100% guarentee that Survivors would quit if they dared touch the precious Decisive Strike or Sprint Burst because Survivors are so weak and need all the help they can get against the overpowered Killers.

What the fuck have you brought upon this cursed land
---
Better than red rank killers all the time :(
---
No, the killer was just bad. If anything it's easier to play killer nowadays than it is to play survivor.
---
owo that's a big list. I honestly have a lot to say about a lot of these perks and I think there is a lot of interesting talk to be had. But I did make a list of [my thoughts on all the perks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qi7NNJoxkmfc8xx1qhf3WxVHptrJL6ZvTYGwQh_Ddwg/edit?usp=sharing) awhile ago when I was really bored one night. This document is rather old (doesn't have Jane's perks, yet alone Ash's) but it is a good point-form of a lot of my thoughts on various Survivor perks.
---
No i dont think so unless you had a key. But it would power the doors once closed. So it was a trade off.
---
Too bad, he's getting buffed whether you like it or not
---
Stop spamming this shit
---
Promoting yourself again...use like twitter or something
---
Why? Does it hurt you or make you feel bad? Does it make you mad? What am I doing so bad that you get triggered?   I don‚Äôt get it lol. 
---
Steam.exe
---
Lol you sound like such a douche man.  I give people the hatch regularly.  It's us being nice basically when we feel like it and going I fucked you and the others up but screw it, you can have some bloodpoints too.  Just know that you were beaten.  I'll also give it by default to any game where they load in with less than 4 people.  Only a potato killer couldn't manage to destroy a 3 man or less load in.  They never had a chance at getting all the gens done.  If it bothers you so much don't accept the hatch.  Most survivors are grateful for these hatch donations.
---
It was good until they deceide to remove all crows from the game 
---
Here we see a wild Myers displaying his dominance over the immersed Claudette, in an attempt to court her.
---
Because you've been spamming your self promoting bullshit and everyones sick of it lmao
---
There's a lot to take in here
---
&gt;[Quickly interrupting the Search interaction will result in the Chest slamming shut, which will generate a noise notification for the Killer.](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Chests)
---
From the DBD wiki page. "noise notification" being the same notification as a popped gen or quick vault
---
That‚Äôs scarier than any of the other killers we have 
---
That's actually scarier than he actually walking holy shit.
---
Ultimate dominance 
---
Everyone or just you?  And even so..  so what? Why can‚Äôt I promote myself? What‚Äôs the harm in that?   
---
Why be negative?  I don‚Äôt really feel like being upset thank you. 
---
Yep gets old
---
Making fun or not, it's fucked up and disturbing. Mission accomplished for the killer. 
---
Might be in minority here, but a human killer with some fucked up mask is scarier than anything supernatural.
---
I play a lot of Freddy too and don't tunnel and do just fine with him.  We don't all play like babykillers with him so please don't use that as an excuse dude.  
---
I just like that the blood effects look good for the most part
---
It definitely feels right
---
Huh. Claudette feels taller. Also, where is Miss Piggy? 
---
So yeah, basically we agree. You even mention in your list that Adreneline is completely bloated, and it's in the "Massive Tweaking" tier. So either nerf it, or buff all the crap perks so it's an even playing field. There's no reason for 5 perks to be legendary, while 30 others are idiot tests.
---
Like, if you use No Mither, you must be brain-damaged. 
---
wow this is epic! truely amazing.

---
its a bug, mom is supposed to work on all killers equaly if your injured, some attacks are coaded difrently to M1s (wraith ambush/nurse blink lunge/hatchets are all not effected by MoM)
---
and spirit has 110%ms, and has to deal with the weapon CD + her CD and the survivor gaining a free SB when it happens
---
I simply pointed out the hypocrisy in demanding survivor perks get nerfed while not saying anything about killer perks 
---
I said that in terms of Survivors, there's no reason for 4 perks to be godly, while all the others are trash. *Obviously* the same applies for Killers. Why would I need to spell that out when the entire topic of OP is Adrenaline?
---
Yes, Spies from the Shadows needs a buff. Happy now?

Upvoting just for the American Werewolf in London pic lol
---
Lol what a salty little pussy.  Toughen up buttercup.  The perk just means you got to hit them 1 more time.  You can still kill them.  Ragequitting like a petulent child because a game didn't go your way has no place in this community.  Go play Hello Kitty Island Adventure or something, it may be more your speed.  I'm a killer main and I'm telling you that you're a disgrace to the community pulling this shit.
---
This is close to a r/perfectloops 
---
they mentioned on the official discord that its ment to effect all killers equaly if the survivor is injured, so its a bug
---
I know I'm a tad late on this, but I have to leave this comment here to come back in case I need a good laugh. You're cute. 
---
I'm a killer main and I think your a toxic little bitch for ragequitting like this.  Put your man pants on and just hit them again.  
---
Aren't Geckos capable of regrowing limbs? Or is that just the tail?
---
ReSpEcT tHe fOuR pErCeNt
---
Boil Over is so gosh dang useless that it replaced Prove Thyself as the Worst Survivor perk in existence. I wish there was something like it giving us Skill Checks every 2 seconds to cause the Killer to sway to side more with every skill check. 
---
Whenever I play killer around rank 5, always 3 or more survivors will have self care, two or more survivors will have adrenaline, usually at least one survivor will have urban evasion and all survivors will have some sort of exhaustion perk with the most popular being dead hard and balanced landing.
---
It only counters t3 if they're injured 
---
But then Franklin's Demise should work on chainsaw attacks, for lore reasons.
---
I've heard rumours of point oFFerings causing this issue. No idea if it's true though but with BHVR I honestly wouldn't be surprised.
---
You sound like the type to throw back Christmas presents back into the face of your parents cause you got something that wasn't on your Christmas list.
---
It could be worse. You could be the Killer who downed me right in front of a hook and then completely forgot about me, so I crawled away around the next corner, recovered, and someone helped me up.
---
Heh. Rancor
---
Personally, I would agree with getting Leatherface in that he's a nice, simple killer with a insta-down making him easy to use &amp; he works with many perk builds. 
---
His perks are excellent, especially BBQ if you are just starting out the game to level up all your characters significantly faster.
---
Claudette has 2 other interesting perks called empathy &amp; botany Knowledge. They are both really good perks so I would suggest maybe leveling her up instead of outright buying self-care. 
---
You could save up the shards to buy another killer with them. Each non-licensed killer costs 9k shards &amp; they come with 3 teachable perks. 
---
You could also wait until next week when the shrine resets. Not many of the shrines perks are particularly interesting aside from Rancor.
---
Rancor is a perk from the spirit that allows you to see the location of every survivor after a gen is complete &amp; allows you to 1 hit down &amp; immediately kill the obsession once the exit gates are powered. Good tracking perk with an added bonus of executing the obsession without needing a mori.
---
Bless you my friend
---
On PC I‚Äôve notice a bug where the terror radius‚Äôs for some killers, legion and Hillbilly (maybe others),  are very small without the help of perks or add-ons.
---
It does this so you play killer more. 
---
When did they add the THING
---
Freddy isnt weak he is unique. Run add ons that decrease skill checks in the dream world. They stack. Also the add ons that give you a speed boost are good just about everything else is useless except maybe shorter transsition times but it doesnt help because freddy can keep up with a sprinting survivor easily. So if anything i would like to see a buff on his add ons that don't do much to help. I think that would make him tremendously better because i mean some killers have op add ons and freddy isn't one of them. 
---
You have to ask permission to do that or just being polite?
---
Joe Rogan memes leaking into DBD, what an interesting time.

---
Well the survivor escaped and the killer ran past him several times, so the killer is definitly worse.
---
Some killers give the hatch because they decimate the group and feel bad. Who are you to tell them what to do. You are just ungrateful. 
---
Who hurt you?
---
Camping is generally an issue of situation and honestly requires thought from both sides to justify if it's really toxic in the giving situation.
---
There has been times where 1 survivor gets hooked and other survivors make it blatantly obvious they're going for the save with any number of reasons to know it's obvious.
---
However there are also many times where it's like someone gets downed in 20 seconds then hard camped until dead while just being gen rushed.
---
surely that outways taking extra time to even be able to hit survivors and being unable to defend from hook rushing and healing squads
---
No worries, you'll only have to wait until MoM appears in the shrine, which'll probably take atleast a year...
---
Pretty good but I'd move Meg up one.
---
I know right. Makes me wish we had a werewolf killer.
---
Oh and happy cake day!
---
I think I'm the only friendly Legion in this regard. If people DC just because I'm Legion, the one/two who stay get fat BP.
---
What kinds of fucked up stuff could he do? I always figured that because survivors can disarm his traps, he can‚Äôt really do anything too game breaking with them. 
---
What
---
I wish there's that one clip again where it showed killer's perspective in 3rd person. they just break the model's arm just so you have FPS which is funny in  3rd person
---
I was JUST on that comment section, did not think that comment would inspire another post though XD.
---
ok
---
I agree for BBQ, but whe you get those special paranoid killers that fail to see all survivor auras with BBQ (they don't even consider some survivors now actually hide in lockers or use Distortion) and then spend half of your sacrifice time searching near hooks is soul crushing.
---
Do you people seriously not understand that these groups are out to have fun with the killer instead of holding down lmb for 5 minutes? Believe me, playing this game with friends gets much more fun when you ignore the terrible core  gameplay loop and just make it a game of "how long can we last". 
---
I mean the wiki says all is know is that he is no longer a survivor. Who said he wasn't a killer at some point? I'd imagine since the entity yanks all kinds of people to be killer including ones who aren't evil they would grow tired of it and retaliate. In the journal description for the hallowed blight it said after the lab was found vigo wasn't there. A monster came there though, what if that creature was vigo. Who's to say that he didnt get all of those jars of salty lips from mori's? Maybe he grew tired of killing but feared to displease the entity so he went and created the escape hatch so in a way he could help survivors. I imagine he would have gotten caught after he experimented for so long. Its just my theory and i like so if anyone knows something that can disprove it im all ears.
---
I used to do that but ever since they fucked up ranks I cant afford to do so even with an amazing game
---
When mettle of man is activated, It will COUNTER ANY ATTACK IF INJURED 
---
Crazzzzzy
---
We already have a clown killer tho
---
Had the killer dark intervention
---
I did this yesterday, lots or teabagging and pointing, that guy got camped to death,  tit for tat 
---
The choices of killer for each example are so fitting, too.

Bnps are a joke now what?

It‚Äôs done on purpose to try and make you branch out and try new things,

Are you one of the 300 ping killers the game keeps connecting me to? I swear matchmaking refuses to actually match people in the same region.
---
lol no, you can walk right on up that rock.
---
My friend and I were the only ones to spawn in and I showed our killer how to climb up it
---
It's just as strong as say t3 myers? Bubbas chainsaw? Billys chainsaw? Huntresses hatchet add on? Noed? Devour hope? Rancor? Any of the mori offerings? Myers tuft of hair? What about bear traps that stop you from walking out of exit gates? This is a joke dude. What do we have that does anything useful? MoM. Self healing and sprint burst? What else is good ds got nerfed? I use MoM and it never stops a good killer. Decisive never stopped a good killer you can get like a extra 10 feet with it. Its super useful if you are near a exit gate and thats it. We have to deal with tunneling and face campers all day so i think its more than fair. This boils down to bad killers whining about perks that help a survivor escape but if you werent struggling in the first place it wouldnt matter. Just play better man. 
---
that's a bought account.
---
You‚Äôre an idiot. There are cases where people disconnect or get a game breaking glitch. No one wants to play that.
---
Why have I never heard of this perk?!
---
I usually do it if I'm getting tunneled or camped constantly.
---
No idea why people start doing it at the start of the game though, maybe they had a few good games against some terrible killers and now suddenly they feel like they can teabag without any consequences. They'll find out the hard way though.
---
How do you know?
---
I love it when the killer wants to farm after he chases me for a good amount of time ( 3 gens or more) and then realizes he already lost the game and then wants to farm. Pathetic
---
Love it!
---
I am relucant as survivor as I had killers who acted friendly to just get to me easier. And I always fall for this trap... 
---
Good those arent the way they were 
---
Extra time is a weakness I agree, however you can mindgame the transition, using the flashes of invisibility to switch directions. Unless its at the endgame, getting people unhooked in your face isnt a problem, more stall/tracking.
---
Breaking chases depends entirely on if the killer can track you. You jabe no comtrol over that really. What survivors control is beimg that one step ahead so essentially if you run a chase long enough you need to just stop and get hooked. 
---
Don't forget his scream when he gets stunned, too damn funny.

Lvl up Meg for Adrenaline and (I hate this playstyle as both survivor and killer but I have to admit it's better for newer players) sprint burst. Then get Urban evasion from Nea, UE and SB work very well together when learning the game. Claudette is a good person to level as well because she has empathy, which shows you where injured players are, botany knowledge, an all around decent and underrated healing perk and finally Self care like you were talking about. Lvling a character to 30 should take around 400-550k BPs, 35 around 600-750k and 40 around 800k-1m BPs. Bbq has only ever been on the shrine once and as they add new perks there's less and less of a chance it'll show up so definitely just worth spending the $5 on it but LF is a fairly low tier Killer
---
Have you even played the game, survivors can't just run in a straight line. They have to do some looping. But my point is, that every survivor is insanely strong compared to killers. Only a few killers actually even have a chance at winning if the survivors have more than 15 IQ.
---
BIlly is cool to play against as ong as youdon't have terrible teamates who don't genrush but waste pallets 
---
He is already too much comparable to hag so I don't see why it is a problem.
---
Yea that‚Äôs what I assumed as well, it‚Äôs just confidence. They were a 3-man swf but I don‚Äôt mind swf, it‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt understand why you (not you) have to be toxic you feel me?
---
PS4
---
In-game
---
I‚Äôve noticed that other survivors are unable to heal me when I‚Äôm injured. At first I thought it was just them messing with me but it‚Äôs been happening a lot more with different games and different players. They would stand next to me and move around (my guess is that they‚Äôre trying to reposition themselves to heal) but not actually heal. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure if anyone else has this issue.
---
A fine example of a toxic killer here
---
What people don't realize is that it can also be a free first hit. Like I understand that he is not high tier and sometimes it's more rng but still he is not as bad as people say.
---
&gt;  sit the fuck down snowflake
---
Oh the irony. 
---
Heavily agree.
---
"And I would have gotten away with it, too! If it wasn't for those *Metal*-ing kids"
---
He's not weak but he's not in a good spot. If you 99 % charge his chainsaw and let go, you have to start charging all over again. Also for some reason he's slowed down when he charges his chainsaw. My last annoyance with him is that when he does his chainsaw flurry, the last hit cant connect. I love leatherface, but I wish they'd fix these things. 
---
Sometimes I lose track of hooks after a few drinks.
---
Yes. 
---
DS was changed, didn't you get the memo?
---
Honestly dude this is great like damn bro good job 
---
- I guess if I had to throw some shit at it it‚Äôd be that it looks really 2D but you‚Äôre drawing on paper so :/ what do you expect
---
Once I got a game without HUD and without skillchecks
---
Idc that I have to pay for killers, I care that half the perks are behind pay wall. Shrine of secrets need a rework.
---
If you're willing to forgive Meg's constant hurr face then surely you can forgive Dwight's constantly looking like he's pissing himself.
---
Plague doesn't counter MoM, Myers needs EW3 and I hope you are joking about the trapper, you won't get more than maybe 1 trap a game against rank 1 survivors.
---
Just stop, please, everybody knows after this short amount of time how huge this perk is. It will change the SWF meta forever and even casuals and lowrankers are picking up on how to use the perk efficiently. 
---
Don't let this turn into another instance of survivors desperatly clinging on to an absolutely broken perk, its better to rip the bandaid of before people get used to it only for the devs to gut MoM.
---
well the good news is that over time they'll get more experience. Right?
---
RIGHT?
---
No? Ah fuck...
---
Do you mind if I use the Huntress for my profile picture? She's SO CUTE! NO THEY'RE ALL CUTE!
---
It is extremely scary in a sabo squad tho
---
So more shading?
---
I was gonna add a background but I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôd add for a background? It would definitely help it feel less 3D.
---
But thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è! I have shown people irl but no one knows the game enough to give me a context based opinion! It means a lot :D
---
Just be happy you were not the one called out : D
---
I think you should post this on an art sub since your question is so specific, this sub is centered around a videogame
---
I understand, but I was gonna do both, because it‚Äôs important that it is accurate/has the background knowledge of the video game ^^ but I totally understand! I‚Äôll delete it ! 
---
Ugh, survivor mains! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Tbh you got a point but I am too used to SC and I feel better using it.
---
what i love as killer (had several games like this) one person is hooked, 2 dc and i'm like "oh well, might aswell let the other two off, game is done anyway" and the last one no matter what i try doesn't get off the other survivor.... 
---
several times i have literally dropped the other survivor in front of the hook where his mate was hanging just for him/her to get the fuck away from me and his dangling mate.
---
like survivor 1=hook
---
survivor 2 =down, i drop survivor 2 in front of survivor 1, survivor 2 runs away, i catch up and drop him in front of his buddy again, he runs away again, repeat 2x more times till the first survivor is dead
---
I've been getting killer dailys for like a week now, its annoying
---
Right, well if you really must make it a choice between Bond and Alert, I say Bond.  
---
It's one of the strongest perks in the game, the amount of situational awareness it grants you is irreplaceable.
---
I don‚Äôt actually mind this because often the bp gained from the farm is pretty close to escaping a normal match anyways, especially if they let me stack tokens of WGLF.
---
Maybe post this in an art sub with the renders of the Default Plague so they have the context to help you
---
Groovy

soooooo you want an even more OP Michael Myers?

---
Amazing xD
---
It stayed on the Claudette the whole game o.O
---
Watching it in the distance while repairing a gen is more horrifying, because you‚Äôre delaying the inevitable with the mori.
---
Why didn't they make it to where it would only stay closed for x amount of time and had a Cool down  (longer than x amount of time) before it could be closed again? The killer would either feel forced to camp it (no diff than current issue) giving survivor time to do gens, or the killer would feel the need to rush to kill the last survivor (hatch is closed for a bit, window of opportunity there) potentially giving the survivor the hatch. 
---
There's really no way to balance it imo, but that would at least give the killer a bit of a feeling of security to not camp it 24/7. 
---

---
What the fuck is happening
---
When I was struggling on the hook, I had the camera turned to look at David‚Äôs face and then I saw the Myers coming back towards me. 
---
When my depleted, he got up to me, nodded a few times before swinging his knife once. It was funny because all I could keep thinking was Myers yelling, ‚ÄúHold on asshole, I‚Äôm coming!‚Äù
---
Back in the day you couldn't use the Blood web while searching. Reason: "when you find a game in the middle of purchasing something, you might not get it or lose BP for nothing."
---
I think they fixed it now -or just don't care-, but when it's about real money and bank account transfers and other stuff like that ... idk, it seems really risky.
---
How often are you buying skins and characters? Every hour? ... or once a week? ... Probably the ladder. Just do it when not searching. It doesn't take long. Adding this feature would take 5 to 20 hours of work for almost no benefits.
---
Also: yes it takes a while to get a full lobby. Lifehack: read stuff, watch videos, do whatever. Time flies by so fast with some distraction.

This comment quite literally made me smile thank you so much!!!!!!‚ô•Ô∏è
---
I‚Äôm lack toast in taller ant though... v.v
---
As someone who loses people easily, thank you for your service.
---
I‚Äôve given up hope that they will ever re-work him, I would be happy if he just caused people to slowly fall to sleep in his terror radius, and be able to interact with survivors if they are performing an action sleeping or not, he can grab awake survivors in lockers so why not gens. 
---
I love how her followers are all grabbing at her, begging her to save them from there plague. 
---
Thank you!!!! I was inspired by the drawing of her lore that the official dead by daylight team posted! It was so moving! 
---
Huntress's year of the big costume 
---
This would certainly be convenient, but I wouldn't end up using it as intended lmao  
---
I'd make my meta presets, and then never actually use them, because I'd always stick to my "experimental" presets and just constantly change things around on those preset.  
---
How do I know I'd do this? I do it in Team Fortress 2.  
---
I also do the same thing on Call of Duty, only a little differently. I make meta classes, and then get too busy using my one experimental class.  
---
I don't know why I'm like this.
---
There's a bug that causes survivors to render improperly so I have recorded the one match where I encountered this bug.
---
The music in the background is supposedly the Texas Chainsaw Massacre theme, but the comment section of the video is undecided about that fact.
---
This sub reddit is for anything to do with the game, not just gameplay, loads of people have posted art in the past, your fine leave it for people to enjoy. 
---
I was gonna post the finished piece later! I‚Äôll dm you with a link if you want ^^

Rather where gonna live forever should show you the killers aura after an unhook or make no mither gift double blood points who ever is using it.

What, is your killer queues longer because people are fed up with playing survivor?
---
Calling me out? Lol. You add nothing to the conversations and clearly have no idea on how this game works.
---
Old comment? When? If so then it is coincidence but unsurprising seeing as all you do is argue with people.

Complaining about ‚Äúadding nothing to the conversation‚Äù and writing your comment, the absolute irony.

I hope your condition improves.

This is some serious „Äå*BITES ZA DUSTO*„Äçaction.

Honestly, rank should be a bit easier to get and have a reward everytime you progress a Colour. But only once per season can you get that reward. (I don't know if they're actually called seasons on dbd, but every rank reset would be the end of the season in my book)

Biggest jumpscare in gaming lol
---
Nice, I share the same feelings as you regarding the matter. By the way, your killer is a perv and I liked it
---
But if you did it "just like everyone else would" I think ALOT more bans would be happening.
---
I'm a big fan of the map, just a pain in the ass to try and see any auras.. üòÇ 
---
lol he's just misunderstood. nah, you're right, he's a pervo
---
No, that‚Äôs bullshit. After roaming around a map trying to find anyone only to see someone, chase them, have them window hop, throw pallets at me, shine a fucking flashlight in my face endlessly, all while I‚Äôm trying to time my special just right to even hit them once. Then after all that if i still get you and hook you,  you just expect me to turn around and not look while your team mates pull you off and heal you back to full health so I can start all over again at square one?!
---
The entire point of being a survivor is not getting caught. If you got caught you lost. The only thing that makes the game a miserable experience is salty survivors mad that they died. People who bitch about ‚Äúcamping‚Äù in DBD were the kids who‚Äôd throw a tantrum if they were it playing tag. ‚ÄúNu uh cause like I‚Äôve got a force field so I‚Äôm not it!!‚Äù 
---
Your use of past tense on something that hasn't been suggested much less inacted disturbs me.
---
Haha yeah I know. I didn't really explain it well. Sorry about that!
---
Shut the fuck up bitch 
---
You're thinking of an ideal world where nobody disconnects. We do not have that, in fact we couldn't be fucking further from that.
---
Let me ask you...
---
Player A goes into a game, starts doing good, Players B,C,D and E all disconnects because "reasons". Either they're pissed that they're losing, they don't like the killer, they don't like the perks etc
---
This becomes a pattern that happens over and over and over and over again.
---
There is seemingly no punishment for this behavior.
---
Player A goes into a new game, starts losing or comes across perks/killers/items he doesn't like. What is he going to do? why should he keep playing when everybody else disconnects on him?
---
Disconnecting is an epidemic and right now there is no good reason not to do it, ESPECIALLY when every other fucker out there is going to do it to you.
---
Bruh, no body is saying dont play strategically and when it's necessary to stay close proximity to hooked survivors but if you cant chase and knock repeatedly with all the advantages of being a killer the  you're just a camper and making the game boring for everybody. Camping first hooked all the way to death is a bitch move and if you think it's fair play then you a bitch too. Nuff said.
---
People are saying the regular green is bad.
---
And yet months on and it isn't fixed...
---
Not my problem how hard it is. As a consumer I want a product that works correctly. 
---
Perhaps they're changing matchmaking for the free weekend?
---
This sub:

Non stop complaining about camping.

Got this too. I wanted to get me dailies before the day started. :(
---
I picked up Clown recently and I plan on spending a lot of time learning him. I know he may be boring but it's hard to be depressed and in agony like usual when playing Clown, it sounds like he's having such a fun time, laughing all the time. Same reason why I mained Doc for a while, both are just a really good time.
---
I agree. You load up into a game, a survivor quits as soon as the match starts, 5 gens for 3 people. Bullshit for sure
---
If you end up having your progress reset too many times in a short amount of time they will not refund your points after a certain amount and instead swap to technical help. Hopefully this doesn't happen again for you, but it's something to keep in mind if it ends up happening again and if it's close to the first time it's happened. 
---
This is apparently a very common issue - hence the loss of progress getting its own category in the dropdown - but there's no real fix for it other than 'keep an eye out' on the auto save icon that appears before and after matches and when you're flipping through menus like the bloodweb. If it stops appearing, quit the game and restart as soon as you are able so that you don't end up losing whatever you gain from the rest of your gaming session for the day.
---
I'm not sure what the technical advice is for consoles, but if you're on Steam they suggest after you notice you've lost your progress, verifying cache + making sure the cloud service is on to help prevent against future losses. 
---
omg I love this!! The shadowy hands and her fully lit figure are such a cool touch!
---
Come on buddy we need you!
---
He doesn't really stand out against the other killers and he isn't the most iconic version of a killer clown. He didn't have to be Pennywise or Twisty(AHS) but all he is a fat man in clown paint. I feel like his clownish aspects could be further exaggerated.
---
I'm a survivor main so a killer has to be extraordinary for me to buy them and he falls short. I could buy a licensed killer or any other of the original killers over him.
---
I do like his bottles but those just cause lag on the PS4 so that's probably why he doesn't get a lot of play on console.
---
I can't connect either. Just says 'checking platform services' over and over.
---
For me, its just because the game rewards you so much for hooking. I get significantly less points if I go for slugs typically, so I just don't bother
---
But what if I repost it..?
---
Same here... cant connect.
---
The Huntress's Hatchet, The Plague's Corrupt Purge, all things that causes exposed, The Pig's ambush attack, The Hillbilly and Cannibal's Chainsaw attacks, The Legion's Feral Frenzy attacks all counter MoM.  8/15 killers pretty much counter MoM just by using their 2nd ability.  Honestly I'm a survivor main and the amount of times MoM procs for me is probably like once every 10 matches.  Not really worth it IMO.  Also everyone running NOED doesn't help either.  The perk looks good on paper but in practice it doesn't really come to use every single game.
---
same here ...

It would be against my wishes, stealing my art, and being disrespectful?

Real response: WGLF should have an actual effect tied to it as well, BBQ is in a fine spot.
---
I mean camping isn't the way the Entity would want the game to be played. It wants a show, so camping is unforgivable.
---
Honestly I think survivors complain about it and Killers try to defend it and that's why it seems like it's so double standard-ish. 
---
Have we all forgotten about shirtless David? 
---
What about breakdown's effect then?

Agreed

Oh it isn‚Äôt that bad, look at the chart! He even left your mouth intact so you could constantly tell him where you are.
---
Is it up?
---
Yeah never called it OP and never said DS was nerfed quickly, try to learn how to read mate, you have way to shitty reading abilities to be talking down to anyone, I'm surprised you could even rewrite the name.
---
I think it‚Äôs because clown is in a good place right now, he‚Äôs not overpowered, he doesn‚Äôt suck, he‚Äôs fun to play against, and he‚Äôs fun to play as. 
---
I‚Äôm guessing you main Ace, Meg, Ash, and Adam right? Cause I know for sure that Meg and Adam wouldn‚Äôt be violent. Maybe Ace but that‚Äôs a long shot tbh. He seems so calm but maybe stressed from his debt. Ash... Well yeah you right.
---
I hope there's a dedi in my area. It's late night and I can't even find a game under 500
---
My friend always shouts at killers when their chasing him and he lags to ‚Äúget their dicks out of their modems‚Äù 
---
Agreed. Too many people seem to think, "how dare they have fun, I have to put a stop to this." I want to be able to enjoy the game and I try my best to do so towards others and be respectful, be it against killer or survivor, but I guess people have fun in their own ways. Glad to hear there's a killer who takes notes of these things though, I'm sure many do, but I seem to always get the shortest straw in my games. It's just painful when you know you never did anything wrong in the first place. 
---
reddit killers lol, "i face camped him cuz he t bagged me pepega"
---
So you think I have to let them be saved? What's the point of the hooks then? Why don't they just teleport across the map every time they are downed? If I have time to get from one corner to the other, Claudette 2 has enough time to go save Claudette 1.
---
He seems happy about it
---
I'm proud to main 2/3 men who would stick their arms in the vending machine.
---
I can see Quentin asking for help, though. But I guess he does have a lot of initiative when push comes to shove. 
---
I main Ash and that's it.
---
It's a meme. Don't take it so seriously.
---
Protip if you don‚Äôt want to be called a camper don‚Äôt camp
---
autism
---
I'd rather keep SC I just wanna know if I should take Bond instead of Alert.
---
what a fucking baby lmao
---
I know but like my meme tier lists *have* to be accurate.
---
I feel like his perks ought to be linked to something in the show like if he gets picked up he'll give another survivor who's hooked the ability to automatically get picked up.
---
I‚Äôd say bond then
---
Is that Nea's face behind the Trapper mask?
---
The issue when people post these questions is they think the survivors side is different or they think theyre further away which theyre not. So in your head you're clear across the map but in reality theres still heart beat around the survivor.
---
This is called proxy camping. Its checking nearby gens without starting chase or anything else to ensure you can be close enough to the hooked person to quickly down them again.
---
The characters don't really have fully fleshed out characters, so it's personal preference. Also, it's a vending machine. Most calm people would get frustrated by them, including Meg, who is described as having "misspent energy", and Adam, who had to fight off bullies in his youth, and is described as having "grit".
---
I'm pretty sure my *subjective* meme tier list is fine as it is.
---
Dear god...
---
Represent!
---
Eh? Doctor? Of all the killers it's Doctor?

---
Why nobody cares? Because he's not exactly special, or all that good.  
---
His map pressure is lacking, and a good survivor can keep him distracted for a very long time.  
---
He's a worse Huntress, with his only upside being slightly better at dealing with loops.
---
That was just line work to show decaying skin but ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
---
Ashy Gnashy 
---
Thanks mate
---
umm there is a legion a plague jane romeo a jesus character and a ash character and also even more bugs
---
Wait who are you in this situation? If you're the killer why'd you just call yourself the killer?
---
If youre constantly checking on the hook, youre proxy camping.
---
&gt;So you think I have to let them be saved? 
---
If you want the most potential points, pretty much yea.
---
Decisive strike was rework was a big one (for me atleast) 
---
Dude when I heard a nurse on console last time I was literally shocked to hear it

As a Myers player, I chuckle every time in the post game chat when people think I‚Äôm hacking when MoM only works while in the injured state
---
Thanks!
---
umm ye ik i got the game (paid) and that happened go to setting and change that then
---
Saving this for research...
---
Probably important things are: Decisive Strike got nerfed and only works after being hooked, the killer "Legion" is hated by a lot of people because of how his ability works and the new killer "Plague" pukes on people and is pretty strong. Also, the newest survivor released a couple days ago has a controversial perk in "Mettle of Man", because it may be too powerful, ranking up has been made harder recently and Behaviour are working on changing the matchmaking system and have been turning the new one off and on every now and again in the past few weeks. So you might find matches with mixed ranks.

Ok not everyone likes bp i guess

I think the chances of 4 solo survivors queueing together is pretty rare but there‚Äôs a pre game chat for pc. Console? Invite them to a chat..?
---
Because he hurt Ashy Slashy, that is unforgivable.
---
what level is this? 40?
---
I run Overcharge, too, yeah. On more than one occasion I've had so many notifications on screen I had no idea what to go for.
---
She's had a rough few thousands years.
---
Alone? Nothing. With some addons you can see the killer or survivors. You can just use the other two keys to open the hatch.
---
They‚Äôre offering you free bloodpoints at the small cost of playing a game with a different character... they just want you to play variety man, calm down 
---
*plays anyways because you have waited too long*
---
they did a great job on shadows often as killer i get spooked by my own
---
Ah the stupid wiggle glitch. 
---
It‚Äôs so nice to see Bunny get her Carrot
---
I don't get the adrenaline hate. If you had a rough game and you see 3 adrenalines pop it's very discouraging, but the survivor had to play a 3 perk game just to heal and go fast a bit. You misplayed horribly and got punished.
---
And old DS by itself wasn't a problem imo. It's when you got hit for your third time was it enraging. I usually run Enduring anyways so it wasn't horrible just annoying
---
What is M1? Still never knew what those tiers were. 
---
I have hot coffee in my sinuses now, thanks. 
---
An M1 killer just means they rely on basic attacks to deal damage
---
Or scratch marks...
---
Mouse 1, so left mouse click / basic attack.
---
Whatd you cover up in top left corner?
---
They will never know our struggle to play survivor on PS4.  Routine 20 plus minute queues for any amount of swf.  Willing to say that's cool I'll just solo queue?  Bam 12 minute soloqueues fuck you go play killer if you want to play this game on this system lol.  On the rarest of occasions can you play survivor with any amount of speedy queues.  Yesterday was one of those days for a few shining hours in the sun, and it was glorious.  Today I'll most likely be banished back to the Shadow Zone of no survivor queues though.

---
The mouth would be numb from screaming too much.
---
Well the best gen jockey perks available are;
---
Jane;
---
Poised - Demise of the Unfaithful
---
- Hides your scratch marks for 10 seconds after a generator is completed. 
---
- Can be great for you if you combine it with sprint burst to disappear as soon as a gen is complete.
---
- If you are running away then having a gen be completed will allow you to make it harder for the killer to track you.
---
Detective Tapp
---
Stake out - The SAW DLC
---
- While in the killers terror radius &amp; not in a chase, the perk charges for 15 seconds to give you a single token. The maximum amount of tokens is 4. 
---
- Everytime you hit a good skill check, a token is used to turn that good into a great skill check. If you hit a great skill check then a tokens is not consumed.
---
- Amazing for using against Hex: Ruin or having an 8% progress boost with all tokens while working on a gen. 
---
Detectives Hunch - The SAW DLC
---
- When you complete a generator, everything within a 64 meter radius including totems, other generators &amp; chests are highlighted for 5 seconds. If you have a map they become visible when you use the map. 
---
- This perk is great for quickly switching to another gen or if you are building a mental map for totem placements case the killer has NOED. Brings an excuse for a map.
---
Feng Min
---
Technician - Sparks of Maddness
---
- When you are working on a gen, you reduce the sound you make of working on it by 8 meters. 
---
- If you fail a skill check the chances of the generator exploding, revealing your location is reduced by 50%. 
---
- The lack of explosion does not stop gen regression. I'm like 70% sure on that.
---
- Not a very good perk unless your practicing hitting great skill checks. The reduction on noise when working on a gen is not significant &amp; usually, killers will check on a gen if they hear its made good progression to kick the gen.
---
Alert - Sparks of Maddness
---
- Whenever the killer performs a break action on a pallet or gen, their aura is highlighted.
---
- Gives you a good idea of where the killer is patrolling &amp; allows you to see where not to run to if a killer is approaching you.
---
Overall the best perks that would complement your objective focussed playstyle would be The SAW DLC for both detectives hunch &amp; stake-out. It encourages you to be more risky though while working on a gen by staying within the killers terror radius &amp; is weak to killers with a small terror radius.
---
Poised is another good option if you want to play it more stealthy. Combine with adrenaline &amp; sprint burst it can allow you to finish gens before the killer can ever see you unless you run into them.
---
I'd recommend the SAW chapter. Detective Tapp's perks Stake out and Detective's hunch make good work getting objective done faster and showing auras of important objects when a gen is completed. The Pig is also a really good killer, but you gotta work to make her work

---
yea‚Ä¶ a bunch of sociopath devs made of salt.
---
I would suggest Feng for lithe and alert - helps out in chase and not bumping on killer/reading what‚Äôs going on respectivly. Jane‚Äôs poised sounds like a perk for you - not having scratchmark after you do gens so you can skiddadle out. If you have problem with ruin skillchecks you could grab Tapp (only one that isn‚Äôt available with IS)for stake out so you don‚Äôt have to worry about hitting great that much. Jeff‚Äôs distortion is a solid perk if you try to scout if killer have nc/bbq but i‚Äôm not sure if you expect to stay ninja. 
---
I hit Devotion 2 on PS4 before I bit the bullet and swapped to PC. Honestly, no regrets on it.
---
because the basement is often in there and you need a fighting chance to get out of it
---
You are my hero
---
I swear that burning bps will always get you some annoying matches. 
---
Didn't knew they reverted flashlight blind effect
---
Easy since there is a pallet a window as well as a length making in the perfect loop for anyone who‚Äôs good enough so I try and destroy that pallet early
---
Omg reddit killers LOL haha
---
Even though I play survivor more, you‚Äôre boring.
---
I hear you. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying when the whole team gets it, it‚Äôs EZPZ
---
You came to the wrong neighborhood Claudette
---
There are no lyrics, I looked description found nothing, Looked in the comments didn't find shit
---
Old Decisive was on a whole other level when compared to Adred. If I have to be completely honest I think Adredaline is fundamentally "balanced" it's just very oppressive and unfun to play against.
---
Go ahead :)
---
That's fair! I wasn't really sure where to put Adam, because while he's an intelligent man, he seems the type to progressively get more pissed off that the machine won't work, and would be too proud to ask for help until he needs it, but "ask for help" definitely fits Adam.
---
As for Jane, I don't know, she likes to help people, which takes patience.
---
That's a thing you can do?!
---
Yeah OP seems to me he still on a stage where is not familiar with famous loops like this house is very strong, but the path he is taking is very awkward hes running without a plan , at least thats what it seems to me , you wanna take the left go down and up using both stairways that link to the underground part where you have a pallet to work with as well
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Survivors are worried that they're giving themselves away, meanwhile I just got 8 simultaneous notifications on screen and have no idea which one to go for.
---
give Frank chicken mask to fit his College outfit
---
Oh god
---
sweet mother of god these comments are amazing to wake up to üòÇüòÇ
---
Really? üòÇ I've been shit talked by my survivor teammates before. They're way more rude than killers honestly.
---
I second. Fuck off with this gay shit.
---
Level up Claudette next, all of her perks are usefull.
---
For your Dwight grab bound (so you can find people to heal you) provethyself (since you already actively looking for other players) if you play on console - borrowed time so you can unhook in heartbeat, if not we‚Äôll make it can be useful for getting heal points just after unhook. Unbreakable seems like good pick too, not sure how often you get to be slugged on lower ranks thou.
---
It honestly works good with SWF but with randoms who start cleansing your just an easy one hit 
---
I certainly hope not üòÇ
---
But, it's not fun? For anyone except the griefer? If someone dislikes the game enough to do that, I don't know what to say. BHVR may have had problems with their game but I'm not blaming them for what players choose to do with their time. If they don't want to cooperate remotely as a team they should probably be playing killer, or a different game. 
---
I like the idea! Appreciate you fleshing it out a bit more 
---
Neither is the m1. But of course the killer wants you to cleanse as much as possible right?
---
I'm glad to hear it. Wish I came across more you guys on PS4. ):
---
Suffering from success. That's Doc mains for you.

Ring a ding ding my man
---
I base killers success on this
---
Safety pip? Good game
---
Extra pip? Great game
---
Double pip? Phenomenal game.
---
40-50k blood points is also amazing.
---
When I get that with whichever killer I play it feels good. 
---
Also the more post chat hate I get the better. I season my puddings with that extra salt. Don't fall prey to the survivors telling or calling you names. They're mad because they didn't have their perfect world where they could never get hooked and could teabag at the gate for endless hours. 
---
You don‚Äôt atleast not on console. A lot of times I don‚Äôt get any blood points I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a bug or what but it really sucks 
---
Wow this new lighting on autoheaven wreckers is insane
---
Disagree. Yes, Corrupt Purge is strong, but giving the Plague Haunted Ground all match isn‚Äôt really better. Her lunge feels shorter than many killers, but she‚Äôs still fast. 
---
This only applies to the green version of the key.  Both the Purple and Pink can be used to open the hatch early.
---
Because billy doesn‚Äôt need NOED because he‚Äôs an insta down killer
---
or better yet, minimalize your game so killer's gonna be stuck in that one game until he's back. Damn, look on his face would be awesome
---
Tyler is what the dbd community needs.  His anger is OUR anger. 
---
‚ÄúYou fool!  This isn‚Äôt even my worst add-on!‚Äù- Amanda ‚ÄòAmanda‚Äôs Secret‚Äô Young
---
(Also the Facemask is pretty garbage, but that has more to do with the fact that blindness is a shitty status effect.  As far as blindness add-ons go it‚Äôs actually one of the better ones.)
---
Use Ace's perk Ace in the hole and Plunderer's instinct you'll be able to give a use to that key sometime, but it's in no way better than a torch or a medikit 
---
Glad he got the mori, even more glad you got to witness it!
---
I think it's not a bug for Pig because Ambush is a part of her power, and not a basic attack.
---
Buy as much time as you possibly can so your team can hopefully genrush the born 3 month premature babykiller.  If you just kill yourself the randoms will probably just assume you were being a douche anyways and won't pick up that it was an Insidious killer anyways.  Ideally they have enough time to finish the final gens and open a door and get in position to teabag the trashcan at the edge of the exit gates.  The last part is vital against a killer of this amazing skill level. 
---
Clowns are extremely generic though, they already did a great job with making Our Boy kind of unique (not even a real clown, just sneaking into a carnie to fuck people up, uses poison gas), no need to clog the game with more
---
And also hes muff
---
Everything about him tends to be annoying.  Screams.  Iridescent.  The hostage build.  3-gen strat.  Tier 3 can't use items.
---
It was so glorious
---
And to top it all off this Bill was like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not how you play the game anyway‚Äù LMAO.
---
Yeah I‚Äôd also think about replacing sprint burst with different exhaustion. 
---
My opinion on Adrenaline has remained constant: on a baseline level it's "balanced" but rather on the strong side if it pops in the middle of a chase. The main issue however is that it's extremely oppressive and can feel quite unfun to play against. I think the design is bloated and after the Exhaustion nerfs simply having a Sprint Burst when the gates are open is more than enough value out of a perk. It needs to either be a free Sprint Burst or a free instaheal, not both. I'd prefer the former because the latter just feels unfun: instaheals in general aren't fun mechanics.
---
NOED is also a perk that's "balanced" because it only happens in the late game and you can cleanse totems to avoid it but it's fundamentally unfun and offers very little counterplay if you don't see it coming. Two things that would help NOED a lot is an in-game totem counter as well as more lategame perks to incentivize cleansing totems.
---
Ruin is not overpowered and you're bad if you think it is. The problem with Ruin is that it's mandatory because gens are done too fast, and something needs to be done about it.
---
BBQ was never overpowered but the problem with the perk is that it does too much for one perk slot. There's no reason not to run one of the best tracking perks that also doubles as a Bloodpoint farming perk. I don't want the Bloodpoint gains nerfed obviously (I think in general we could serve to gain more BP overall) but I think there needs to be a stronger "gameplay first" alternative to BBQ. Not saying they should just add a version of BBQ that reveals auras for twice as long but doesn't give Bloodpoints: we need an alternative tracking perk that's at least on-par with BBQ. The closest we have to that is Whispers which is useable but still relatively weak, and I think we could stand to buff Whispers to a degree tbh.
---
I do agree that there are no perks that I can truly point to and say "this is overpowered, this is uncounterable, this shouldnt be in the game" akin to old Decisive Strike. There are definetly perks like Adred/Ruin/BBQ that I can point to and say "this is overly oppressive and that's unhealthy for the game" but in the grand scheme of things they're fine. They only reason people view these perks as "overpowered" is because they're the best in their class and the other options are terrible. Like what other tracking perk is there to compare with BBQ?  
---
I do honestly think that complaints about Ruin will stop as more Killers get Corrupt Intervention and start using it.
---
Lol salty because he didn‚Äôt get the hatch
---
Was a buddy and I all of last night
---
Zubatlel or Marth
---
I cannot think of a worse way to say it than this. You need to see the other side, that‚Äôs why there r so many fights about this. You‚Äôre literally only thinking about being a killer because you‚Äôre a killer main, you need to think about both. If you can‚Äôt get them without camping then maybe you just aren‚Äôt a very good killer. 
---
Loops, Flashlighfs, Pallets, Walmart
---
Killers don't get as many major nerfs because there aren't as many fundamental flaws with Killer as there are with Survivor. :^)
---
This isn't just "salty Killer main" talking a lot of mechanic for Survivor (pallet vaccumes, unlimited Exhaustion perks, Decisive Strike) were just flat out overpowered and had no place in the game.
---
Probably being matched more with other parts of the world due to timezones
---
i'm saying even if it wasnt blocked he would've hit you
---
I mean, I couldn't mori anyone by that point. First hooks all around.
---
Y'all ain't getting to the real shit, micheal's waist is * S n a t c h e d for the gods *
---
There's legit something really unsettling about it
---
I have to go through maybe three or four lobbies with ping around 300 before I get a lobby with &gt;100 ping.
---
I think the opposite. Being unhooked and healed to full is fine as it allows for late-game saves to be done more easily. (And truthfully I think a weak version of Borrowed Time should be integrated onto hooks on-base.) Having an instaheal and a Sprint Burst in the middle of a chase however is extremely oppressive and makes the Killer feel very bad.
---
I feel like 90% of the upvotes were because of how Mettle of Man still spells out mom. I know I did 
---
They said people would quit if they nerfed Exhaustion, and they said the same about Decisive. We've nerfed both and I still see Survivors.
---
I felt the effects of chili too, they are pretty noticeable by the end of chainsaw run
---
I've played a lot of Wraith recently and I can confirm that his 'Surprise' attacks do give Survivors MoM stacks and trigger MoM.
---
If MoM is *supposed* to activate and gain stacks against Huntress Hatchets and Plague's Corrupt Purge they really need to change the terminology in the perk, which specifies 'basic attacks' just like Dark Devotion and Infectious Fright, but apparently doesn't use 'basic attack' in the same sense that those perks do.
---
MoM hurts her, but it will hurt the other less-mobile Killers more; she isn't becoming trash (if MoM really will be fixed to trigger against Hatchets) every Killer except Hillbilly is weakened by the introduction of it. 
---
She'll still be one of the strongest Killers, it'll just be that every Killer is weaker now.
---
Perhaps I‚Äôll give it a shot again. I used to run kindred all the time as I thought it was a good perk to have so if one person saw a survivor headed to the hook it would keep them on a generator. But despite having it equipped I generally still saw everyone run for the hook saw still. So I stopped using it as it wasn‚Äôt helping as much as other perks I ran. But I don‚Äôt run into the campers too often so will see. I‚Äôve grown attached to the perks I currently use so tough to replace anything now.
---
Yes that makes sense. I was leaning towards just hanging on the hook as it seemed like the better option overall. But maybe thought this specific situation called for a different action and was curious what others thought.
---
I have yet to figure out how to survive when he revs his chainsaw behind me. 
---
I‚Äôd say get feng and Jeff. Aftercare is a god tier solo survivor perk that I highly recommend.  And distortion can tell you what perks the killers are running if you‚Äôre paying attention (lose a stack when you pop a gen? Bitter murmur,  when someone is hooked? BBQ, when being healed? Nurses calling, etc) Technician and alert are great for feng and not to mention lithe for a decent exhaustion perk. 
---
Oh yeah killer on that one I'm just like where are the gens!?
---
So what xD
---
Can you explain to me what do you mean by burning BPS? I am new.
---
when Ash punches the glass he is gonna get that snack because he has metal gauntlet, unless he is using Ashy Slashy at the time
---
A SPLIT SECOND??? i was initiating the vault from 0:11 and he hit me 0:14/0:15 . i might not be good in math but something isn‚Äôt adding up. ü§® just admit that dead by daylight is the best game ever üòçüòç and go
---
I feel like dejavu is good for newer people to learn to not to group gens, but idk kev
---
wym? i cant even queue up on PC because the button is bugged since patch 
---
Yeah I haven‚Äôt played in a month because of it :/
---
The face is a little weird but other than that it looks great! Really like the background: made a really nice shadowy asthetic.
---
its pretty normal,  you'll get used to it. the thing you have to start to keep in mind is your surroundings beforehand, when walking up to a gen see what pallets you can go to and loop in case you get on a chase. thats why you should really be mindful of pallet management , its very important to keep the pallets up on areas that gens didnt pop yet, easier said than done ofc, but   pallet management is halfway to victory imo
---
yep, total shitshow. whole sub says red ranks are sweaty but it's not true. survivors and killers of red ranks mostly just efficient, they don't sweat anything out. of course some do but that's definitely not a majority. mostly red rank games are pretty chill and fun, especially afterwards. especially when cocky survivors say gg or apologize in case they crossed the line with bming. i've rarely seen this behavior from yellow-green-purple ranks, they get cocky while not even good at the game and then proceed to insult killers in chat. and not so good killers get angry when outplayed. and these are very rare occasions on red ranks. whatever they say it's a status thing too. if you're red every season, you mostly meet same people. especially if you play both sides it is definitely not in your interest to be a cunt. 
---
you can even see it on my steam wall. everything before the Plague chapter and fucked pipping/matchmaking are 90% +rep from people i killed and maybe a bit of salt if i cucked someone as survivor cause i have Stockholm syndrome and if killer is being respectful, plays fair and all, i try to slightly sabotage the entire team so killer could get better points. 
---
but yeah, before cucked pipping, i had good comments, people would compliment on my playstyle, builds(cause i don't run crutch/clutch perks apart from BBQ) or even lack of builds cause i often play completely naked(no add-ons/no perks). 
---
now they just accuse me in camping and tunneling when i didn't do such things. like when i used to be on green-purple ranks they'd call me out on stupid shit like wall hacking. nothing of this kind happens when i play against experienced red rank players no matter how the match goes. 
---
I had a 8k times three and last category was 7900 points and only had 32k gained with a 75% extra add on how are you able to get that high BS amount?

Never mind. Steam is down according to [https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210](https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210) which was in the DbD forum
---
same here
---
Thank you!!!!! I appreciate it ^^ 
---
Feng would definitely punch/kick the glass tho
---
I actually think that striking the side of the glass/the front and to the side of the the machine is the optimal way to get a vending machine to release a stuck snack, even if it a lot of people wouldn't do it because it was more violent. Shaking the machine is dangerous and unnecessary. The survivors who shake it might just be direct and solution focused.
---
You have a scrub mentality. You don‚Äôt like a specific perk with an easy counter, so you come to Reddit to whine about it.
---
No one cares. Get good.
---
I'll give you that Adrenaline hits Freddy harder than most killers but that's due to possible issues with his kit design.  But simply being asleep isn't enough to remove the health state from Adrenaline proc.  Deep Wounds will drop you if you don't mend it which is why Adrenaline won't heal you past that.  But being asleep is just an inconvenience.  A non-lethal inconvenience.  It sucks that Frederick gets the short end of the stick with this perk but I think changing it to only wake is a bit too harsh given the nature of the sleep debuff.  I main a lot of Freddy too so I completely get why this sucks but objectively I just can't go that hard in the other direction on the perk.
---
Shirtless Clown?
---
Also where's Nea and Claudette teabagging in the background?
---
Uhm... usually I like placing one on the inside corner. It gets results about 50% of the time, though. 
---
The whole idea behind Trapper's basement is to get one person in there, then hover around the basement, trapping thoroughly around the outside while waiting for saves. Then you knock both of them down and you've got two of them down there. 
---
You're much better off setting traps in locations that will make for easy grabs as they attempt to evacuate. Adjacent vaults and the like are gonna be your best bet. That helps a lot for snowballing into a Basement party and is well worth the effort. 
---
Do exposed hits still give progression towards MoM though? Like if the person needs 1 more hit before it becomes active and I hit them with make your choice. Will they have MoM active after the unhook?
---
Use Shazam to find the song. 
---
Addendum: DbD is like a box of chocolates where a vast majority of the chocolates are indeed literal pieces of chocolate covered shit.
---
Adrenaline is powerful yes. But op? No. It has requirements. Must finish 5 gens. Must stay alive. You get no use for it for the whole game. You deserve a reward for living the whole game 
---
Unbreakable is a strong perk by itself anyways.  
---
Against any killer that knows how to slug, it could be a game changer.
---
Is that Ash's buckle up perk in the center of the survivor perks on the bottom right? How is it useless? Seems to be good at preventing slugging, it's done some work for me due to being stealthy generally.
---
I see plenty of plague and spirits. Especially day 1 and 2 release plague is all i saw. Spirit is a very picked killer. Even more than nurse
---
Same dude, it is a pain 
---
If thats really the reason you havent played then dont come back. What a stupid reason. I see legion maybe 1/20 games
---
Whenever I try loading the game on PC, it gets stuck on the "Checking Platform Services" screen on won't load into the game. Some of my friends also have this issue, some don't.

I love this! It's very nice. I hope no one reposts but we have a lot of karma whores on Reddit so we shall see. But I wish you luck lol
---
what's to say you'll get a skillcheck with SC? I may have worded to make it sound like you get constant skillchecks but it just doubles the chance
---
This isnt really related to DBD... Kinda against the rules.
---
No one gets points if the killer force closes the application.
---
Idk chief
---
I have the same leopard gecko :)
---
You‚Äôre white ranks then. Nobody in the low ranks leaves you on hook. You lose points like badly. I need like 3 perfect emblems to get a pip. Altruism is the easiest one to max. Just go unhook people and stop being salty
---
I tried it and it doesn't help much. You can just wait a minute and go heal your teammate. Also those 6 seconds are useless because the killer will probably see you when you run to heal.
---
There are more useful perks like Empathy.
---
So, if Nurse became easy to play while keeping all her strength, would she be as hated as Legion?
---
The Devs slowly killing there game off, let‚Äôs sell them stuff but not fix it! 
---
, I like that nurse can blink through pallets and vaults, but the penalty after and lack of visibility during make it so hard to track. I hate getting rituals for her. 
---
dimma dab on 'em
---
Can confirm
---
Did this just happen? I was in a game where huntress slugged all 4 people in like 2 minutes cuz everyone was overly altruistic 
---
These killers that leave are bitches. 
---
Is there a point you're trying to make? Start with that. 
---
Agreed, I leave instantly when I see a legion
---
This made me laugh, have my upvote!
---
I played killer once on xbox with a regular controller.never tried again. Its literal aids to play killer on a controller
---
Yeah this is kind of annoying :(
---
\^ Legion main, right here!
---
It's been pretty bad tbh, I really enjoy the game and can't leave it even though it can be annoying waiting 5+ minutes for a lobby. You get used to it after awhile. I'd still say it's worth it
---
If the game would be more balanced towards killers and survivors wouldnt be such toxic mfers you would get matches much faster because more ppl would play as killers

---
Dont listen to most of the reviews, a huge amount of this community is calling this game garbage but yet they are playing it for thousands of hours.
---
I‚Äôm not that great at it either but it‚Äôs usually just keep running around corners so he can‚Äôt hit ya and if he‚Äôs far enough away just look behind ya and turn real fast. Noed on Billy is like the biggest overkill tho, even I‚Äôve never seen it b/c it‚Äôs just that dumb
---
Didn‚Äôt work for me. Prior posts regarding this have been in regards to servers being down. I‚Äôm NA so probably our region having problems.
---
Lol is that the carrot from Cuphead 
---
 [https://steamstat.us/](https://steamstat.us/) 
---
I've been out of the DBD loop for a while, so I thought this was a Male priest killer or something. I better go Google who this is
---
Hah you didn‚Äôt censor out your perk wheel! Consider your account mine.
---
The context of the pic makes it directly relate to dbd though.  I got it immediately and thought it was funny.  How is this different than the hundreds of memes posted here with captions that make it relate to the game?
---
They're different than me. But I have loop stpppi g killers, so I'd chase after the first person I see to keep them from the group. 
---
Additional context - I unhooked 2 people and completed 3 gens 
---
You mean from a lore standpoint. From a logical standpoint its logical because its a squared structure with two exits, a window and a pallet. Of course its the easiest place to loop.
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature. https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Tinkerer
---
What a out the other ones? M2 and M3?
---
Pipping
---
Oh ok. 
---
definitely ignorance
---
I'm on console.
---
You can‚Äôt tell me what to do 
---
Yeah this game is worth $10. Defiantly not worth $20 so if you know people who will play with you it‚Äôs worth it.
---
Imagine if you had the challenge to level up evil within 4 times and this happens üò©
---
I agree with everyone else in this thread, but just remember no matter what you try to do, some players will unhook you regardless in order to complete a rescue ritual, get bp using WGLF or simply troll/meme.
---
It‚Äôs shitty, but happens all the time - *especially on free days/double bp events*
---
&amp;&amp; i‚Äôm literally saying this ‚Äúthing that happens‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt because it‚Äôs not fair, but you were too busy thinking i was just ‚Äúsalting around‚Äù to realize that but GO AWFFF SIS ü•∂ü§£
---
T1 just has waaay too many memeable moments.  dbd needs more t1 memes.
---
That's good of you, it's great to have teammates like that. The guy in the game I was upset about did the exact to me, expected me to heal him even though he was repeatedly leading killer to me. I should have not but I try my best to help, it's a fault of mine.
---
I have unintentionally led killers to people, but that's because I don't usually have any perks that lets me know teammates are nearby outside of Aftercare. If I see them nearby I will go another way, or crawl like you said. If someone does it to you all game purposefully though, that's when I draw the line. 
---
I've heard of legit pc streamers using controller for survivor and mouse and keyboard for killer though.  I've played plenty of PC games in the past but the analog stick just feels so perfect for looping and jukes and such.  
---
It's not out yet mate. I'm going to get it though
---
If you repost I‚Äôll play legion and die. Don‚Äôt repost and save a life
---
Me too
---
Yeah and it's especially doable with spirit. She's pretty top tier and gets hits a lot during a match. 
---
Pipping as survivor on the other hand is pretty difficult now. 
---
I'm really glad to hear that, good on that Spirit for knowing what's up. Killers don't have to give us anything, but it's nice when they recognise there's blatant bullying going on.
---
Interesting i didn‚Äôt understand thats his perk, thats very helpful to know thankyou
---
That's the thing about situational perks though, they're only best in their situations, but when they are in their situation, they kick butt. 
---
Lol I wish but the models don't come separate sadly 
---
The black areas were blinking in and out of existence and when everyone readied up, the loading screen maintained them. For a brief moment after the match started the game world blink white repeatedly till it stabilized, I was genuinely worried.
---
A normal legion honestly isn't that bad, they're annoying but not to the point where I'd consider disconnecting against them. Yes they can jump over pallets and easily get a hit on you, but if they're committing to chasing you and have to start a frenzy again then your timer's only down by a quarter AND they get stunned in the process. They'll spend quite a bit of time just chasing one guy if they have to rely on frenzy, and if they don't commit to one guy and try to stab everyone in one frenzy then they'll be using up a lot of time to still only commit to going after one survivor after all of that stabbing.
---
A good legion with cold dirt and frank's mixtape on the other hand is absolutely horrible with zero counterplay and I could understand a DC. Same goes for the ones abusing the nasty blade addon strat and the moonwalking strat. 
---
Honestly though if people are DC'ing the very moment they find out its legion then they're dicks and are throwing the game away for the rest of their team. It's such a childish attitude to have.
---
They are both pretty good but I find Spirit way more fun to play. Wooshing around feels good as all hell and with Whispers, you can run a real tight loop checking gens. The Plague is okay, but you‚Äôll look like Khloe Kardashian stomping around and there‚Äôs virtually no sneaking as her so if that‚Äôs your thing, try Spirit first.
---
Yep, do that. Just do not expect to see results every game, otherwise it wouldn't be situational.
---
For me it is a combination of if I had fun and how many kills I got. Got merciless but survivors were insanely toxic? A win in the game's eyes, but not mine.
---
Dont cry about things that arent real like a bitch.

Sometimes I tea bag at a survivor on a hook or squat and nod my head up and down or click my flashlight at them as a joke or a greeting (and of course I get them off the hook safely and before they struggle), and then, a surprisingly large amount of the time, they get upset about it and sandbag me. Like, I wouldn‚Äôt have ran all the way across the map to save you if I wanted you to die and not have a good time playing lol I also didn‚Äôt do anything to these people beforehand, I was just saying hello and they get so upset lol 
---
FACT!
---
Stop looking at the Killer :\^)
---
You‚Äôre being downvoted for being an anti-fun little hall monitor. 
---
As much as I hate this, I respect it lol
---
Well, color me lucky then. 
---
It was implemented, but when they fucked up the matchmaking they rolled it back. 
---
LMAO. How am I antifun? Im stating a fact.
---
Sorry but no! I would also never take commands from someone whose username has a slur in it.
---
STEAM IT UP!!! GET IN THERE
---
Fuck em'. If we all flooded this subreddit with the nasty messages we got post-game nobody would ever get to see the high-quality memes this community posts. /s
---
(You can click the trash icon and replace it with another daily.)
---
When I play Legion, I usually just get my BBQ stack and let people go.
---
The speed and accuracy that a M+K has? Have you seen games with people trying to use controllers vs M+K? It's a literal slaughter. Hugging corners for tight loops is like 25% of chases. What about circling a pallet and the killer is changing direction constantly? What about going around corners and you need to see behind you which direction the killer is going and adjust accordingly? Constantly changing your direction and moving the camera? Every game I watch that also has a console version it literally looks like potato easy mode with controllers and slowed down. I would love to see you try this at high ranks vs M+K with a controller.
---
Huh, that's odd. I guess sometimes actions are hard to interpret. I once had someone spam unhook on me all the way through my second stage until there was a second left to save me, now that I was annoyed about. If you unhooked me safely and didn't wait forever, I wouldn't react like that.
---
People get so worked up in this game, I think. It's okay to have a little fun, I just don't like it when teammates make the game unplayable for the others. 
---
It just comes off as that. You‚Äôre dying on a very very small hill in an obscure gaming sub. We all know the rules, there‚Äôs entire billy memes around it. Linking the rule is the most teachers pet move you can do. Just let the meme be and if you‚Äôre worried about rules being broken...well we have mods for that.
---
Looks like they fixed hatch standoffs 
---
PS4 Cant heal glitch. Happened to me personally and then a claud and I just gave her my med kit so she could heal
---
At 990 hours i still play this shitshow we call dbd
---
We live in a society.
---
That's the point: they can be useful in 1 game out of 10. And because of this, no one will ever use them because there are perks that can help in the whole game and in every game. Situational perks that are worth running are Q&amp;Q for example, but a slugging perk is too much situational to use it everytime.
---
I don't like playing Legion, but I don't mind playing against them anymore. Most of the time I can easily loose them when they go into their frenzy. I don't really find them that challenging or annoying.
---
Back when sabotage was meta because it gave like 1,000 points and worked pretty fast you would end up with just the basement hooks being left. You were largely screwed as a killer if you didn't have Iron Grasp and/or Agitation.
---
It took me until level 35 to get iron grasp 1 as the trapper. It was a frustrating time. We also still had a lot of infinite loops.
---
This is not correct.  Dead hard negates your 1-shot down, and if everyone is infected anyway, then the infection doesn't matter.
---
Like Ash would ever ask for help.
---
i honestly wouldn't mind the trapper being as strong as the hag. he's one of my favorite killers to play against and him being strong would be nowhere near as annoying as others who are strong
---
Playing enough, and playing killer will get you there too.
---
As a player that plays both sides, fuck survivors. They usually do well against me, or suck ass while on my team.
---
Stop fucking farming me, jerks!
---
Best response you can get right here. Got my upvote. 
---
The new pallet buff seems a bit much
---
I‚Äôd rather DC then play a farming match, I queue up to play the game, not to farm for points.
---
I only play legion for the bps, otherwise I find him to be quite weak, and if I play against a legion with no mixtape, I don‚Äôt suffer as much as people would have you believe.
---
I'm on PS4 and I experience all of those problems.
---
One of the most common gripes I‚Äôve seen regarding Legion is that they‚Äôre a ‚Äúbrain dead‚Äù killer. So I‚Äôm curious as to how the generally well liked Nurse‚Äôs reputation would change if she was easier to use. The Legion has a similar role to Nurse with their ability to bypass pallets, but are widely hated because of how easy it is to do with them, while the Nurse is well loved because it takes more skill to use her. I‚Äôm not looking for a flame war, just an actual discussion on these matters.
---
When are we getting a Payday x DBD crossover with the cloaked as the killer
---
Nurse takes a lot of practice. I suck with her
---
Weird

Tyler is the best. He's an idiot, but a loveable one.

I've watched [TrU3Ta1ent](https://www.twitch.tv/tru3ta1ent) since 2 years ago and tune in his stream from time to time, but even he gets tilted when he wants to play and gets placed in lobbies of 300+ ping or dosent find a game at all when playing killer, he's also such a positive guy and very nice to watch, but in these past 2 days he seemed down, and kinda bummed about it, i'll rethink about buying the game, maybe i'll give it a try later on in the future, thx for the helpful comment though
---
 
---
Have you even read the lore
---
There is some truth to it. There are issues with people D/Cing and not all 4 people loading into the lobby.
---
The rank system isn't ruined. It is just more difficult and lot of people dislike that. 
---
I personally didn't have much issue with the matchmaking personally at around rank 5. 
---
I also never hear about people losing their points. It used to be a problem over a year back or so but I had never an issue with it.
---
I rarely face high ping killers but you can avoid that lobby if the ping is too high for you. I guess it depends on your region as well. In central EU I have no issues finding low ping players.
---
As I said above. The lobby issues are true and matchmaking can be wonky but the devs are testing a new system currently since they will implement dedicated servers this summer.
---
Overall I would say the devs listen quite well to player feedback and moved the game in the right direction since launch. They do take their time for some stuff though but they do well imo.

yea there's a perk when a gen is 85% your terror radius goes away for 8 seconds. Tinkerer 
---
My take is that I try to find a ledge to drop them off of. If they don‚Äôt have balanced landing I can get them back down easily.
---
That is the joke. üëçüèª
---
Is Sabo'ing broken? Sabo'd two hooks in a match and didn't see a scoring event for either.
---
Ahh.
---
4 BBQ stacks and a ruthless killer. That's all I want.
---
Or like your bitch ass mom
---
Okay makes more sense now 
---
For real.  as a Killer, I can't see ANY auras.  I can Barely see where the Generators are.  I DC when I get this map
---
Yeah, i think i'll just wait and see what happens in the future and buy it then, rather then buying it now and maybe hating it or something, it's a really nice game so maybe they fix the big issues by then

---
Mettle of Man. Ash‚Äôs strongest perk.
---
Might not have played for a while. Sometimes after a chapter I don‚Äôt like I won‚Äôt play for a couple months or so and get low rank from multiple resets.
---
Yup i'll be patient and wait till the dedicated servers, and give it a shot then, thx for the help
---
I'd play that game.  Games with Mars levels of connections are funny AF
---
"Nurse and Legion are on the same level for difficulty of escaping"
---
Except no. Nurse is built to go through barriers, and without blinking has an incredibly low base speed. She *relies* on blinking in order to catch *you*. When done well, you can outplay a good Nurse, and she doesn't disrupt *everyone* all at once.   
---
Legion is built not only to shit all over barriers, but to cause as much damage to a large number of people as possible, and ensure multiple people aren't able to do anything but stand still and make noise while they patch themselves up, when he's just gonna come back and down you anyway. Legion also has an unaddressed exploit with his moonwalking. Then when NOT in Frenzy he still has a much higher base speed than nurse. 
---
Your chances of surviving a Legion are LESS than that of surviving a nurse of the same skill level. 
---
If a person disconnects at the place where the hatch will spawn, the hatch glitches and it doesn‚Äôt show up so you can‚Äôt jump in.
---
*I see what you did there*
---
Nope. This is a whole lot of over exaggeration. The game has been saving data to their servers for a while now and I've had no issues with data loss, I play pretty much every day, and I play casual (no "toxic builds", bm'ing, or getting angry over getting caught or camped). High ping lobbies happen, it's a 50/50 chance imo, plus they're working on their matchmaking system as well as working on dedicated severs that should be coming in the summer.
---
They've written up the absolute worst scenario for everything which is never the case.
---
The game's largest issue is it's bugs, the weird hit boxes, and the salty community. Really it's a good game, far from perfect but not even close to being the worst.
---
I usually judge how easy they were to chase
---
If they were good at jungling and looping i'll take them to somewhere that i dont think they could get far or hide after getting free.
---
If they were bad i justkeep going to the nearest hook anyways.
---
Don't know what's going on in that first thread, but this is a rare and unfortunate bug. I've had it happen to me once as well on the magic schoolbus. 
---
In hindsight, you may still have gotten hit, but it would have been a very close call. 
---
So they did it on purpose then. What the fuck 
---
IMO I feel like toxicity it's a problem in every game today.
---
Came here to say that, damn gg 
---
Maybe get it when it is on a sale. It is good value foe the money you spend imo.
---
Isn't there currently a free weekend going on? Not sure. You could try the game out if that is the case.
---
That's what I do but I prefer winning that playing useless perks
---
Gotcha the ol master PC race superiority complex.  There are some extremely skilled killers on our side too man.  We're not all scrubs just because we play on console lol.  
---
I still play him somewhat regularly, but his weakness is the same as all the other killers outside the top tier, map pressure. Fat boi cant get around. It takes a set amount of time to go from obe end of the map to the other. 
---
That said yestersay I played a game with Pinkys Finger and got 3 dc's, so that was a fun waste of an escape cake. 
---
Do you have a watermark or something that I can attempt to edit onto it?  I would love to give you credit for it, but some places don't have a spot to write credit.
---
I think there is a lot of misunderstanding here.  
---
You're almost never getting away from a God Nurse. You're also never getting away from a God Legion (lol). Legion just takes a *lot* less skill and effort to utilize his full potential. These are chase killers. Hiding is your best option. 
---
The game is pretty clunky, which isnt an issue in itself, but it's pretty obvious that the programming, at least the initial programming of the game, is spaghetti code and they have to keep fighting it, that's why they try to fix things, but many things never really get fixed or it just bugs other things out. They really try to fix things, don't let salty commentors tell you otherwise, but it will probably never be bug free. 
---
That guy also wants to de-rank, which just tells me that he wants easy matches to begin with.
---
"Beware new players, you will be bullied by high rank" - No, that's a lie. This game is highly competitive for many people, and you will be bullied by some jerks, yes, but i've never seen high rank players being proud of winning against newbies. If anything they just play like high ranks play and then feel bad for being against newcomers. 
---
The game is not in its best state right now, i will not deny that, but it's also not ridiculously unplayable as this guy states. 
---
If you're planning to play it solo i would wait until the game is in a better state overall, as now it's really just a mess and that could end up hurting you as a newcomer. But if you plan to play with friends, honestly, i don't see a problem with that. I still have a lot of fun playing it with my buddies.
---
Since i've played a lot of games and still am, toxicity it's not really an issue for me, but still i think i'll wait till later on when they announce the new dedicated server and give it a try then, i'll try and play it this weekend since it's free, i'll see how i like it and make my decision then, thx for the input :)
---
Without add ons, Legion is still ridiculous, even a "normal legion".  
---
EZ strat.  
---
Hit one person, it reveals all those nearby, hit the one nearby once, which guarantees they have to spend time mending and doing nothing else, and commit to EZ downing the last person you hit. Everyone else didn't get to do shit because they have to spend time mending, then healing afterwards. So other survivors gotta waste a shit ton of time doing nothing while you down that one person. But the time you get them on a hook, they've only just healing up (maybe) and have done no gen work in the process. It's tedious, boring, and unrewarding. 
---
Or have it disable of they remain still for too long, similar to the survivor AFK crows.
---
yeah, i was thinking of trying the game this weekend and see if it's a yes or a no for me
---
To each their own. I have lots more fun playing with unique setups and reaping the rare rewards they bring.
---
Out of curiosity, are you the one downvoting my responses? If so, why?
---
I see a lot of people saying the game is good, and what i posted above it's half true or exaggeration like you said, i guess i'll have to try it myself and see how i feel about it, since it's free weekend anyway, thx for the help :)
---
Not when the killer has a ping of 0 
---
So did daddy never love you?
---
Because I can see why and I don't love you either so go tell it to someone who cares you little wannabe tough guy.
---
It can happen if a player hasn't played dbd in a long time &amp; have let months of rank reset stack up against the person. It can also be an alt account that's just been left for rank reset to effect.
---
&gt; Hiding is your best option.
---
You DO know that Legion can see uninjured people once he stabs someone in Frenzy, right?
---
There's no misunderstanding, you're just making shit up, going on about god-tier which I'm pretty sure most of the player base doesn't play at, which is why I said "of the same skill level".
---
&gt; Legion just takes a lot less skill and effort to utilize his full potential.
---
This only justifies my point. He's slow skill with an extremely high reward. He's like Brigitte from Overwatch. EZ game because skill isn't required. 
---
But if there is a 90% chance that I'll get another killer ritual that doesn't really matter.
---
Good one there kid.
---
Probably playing a killer daily or doesnt play killer often. 
---
None of the perks are tier 3. Flowchart billys are annoying but do you expect him use bad perks over meta ones? 
---
My bad, I'll make sure for next time. 
---
fuck you mean 
---
 I never have
---
Oh it‚Äôs okay at least I gave a request a try but still keep doing your great work
---
If you're not having fun, you need a break. Take a week off. Maybe even a month off.  
---
And, having read your other comments, a good way of dealing with toxicity is turning the in-game chat off. It's helped me a ton as I basically cannot encounter shitstains saying the things shitstains say.  
---
Some people will still play a little scummy, but that's a part of the game I can accept and move on with.
---
But sometimes it goes that way and I‚Äôm more than willing to have a relax game with making extra points, they only happen once in awhile and we haven‚Äôt had any Double blood point events since Christmas, so the extra points are nice. 
---
What if Plaid Flannel was made base kit so all nurses could see where they would end up teleporting to. It wouldn‚Äôt change her strength but make her much easier to use.
---
Nah, I just play Legion to be an asshole. If I dont get at LEAST one DC a game, I add another scar to my wrist. 
---
Are we also going to ignore all the meta perks the survivors have too? 
---
He went a little overkill but it‚Äôs clear these weren‚Äôt survivors using random perks either
---
I don't think it's the perks on their own being nerfed that would cause people to leave. It would probably be the constant spotlighting of survivors perks being nerfed. People predicted adrenaline would be next in line. I see people suggesting nerfing instaheals (while not touching moris), keys, mettle, and even balanced landing. It's like people are never satisfied. At some point, it may get tiring for a lot of people.

I don‚Äôt rely reply to the toxicity, I just feel bad for the ones that get it super rough. And you‚Äôre right, I really do need a break, but dbd is so damn addictiveüò¨
---
They would be, if their M1 was a one hit down. 
---
I'd rather not lose a pip because killer wanted to be nice to the last guy just as I'd rather not someone pip because I gave them a hatch for free. I only take it when I play in a 4man because they also hate it when someone gets hatch for free. I was fine with before the rank system changed and now I hate it both as killer and survivor
---
lmfao you say that like they actually DO something when you report. üòÇ
---
I feel like I‚Äôm being attacked by the small ‚Äúim sorry‚Äù
---
When you‚Äôre below rank 10 and still can blink properly, what do you call that? Can‚Äôt be ‚Äúnoobiness‚Äù at that point. 
---
Nice assumption. You're wrong, but nice try. Go be stupid somewhere else.
---
4K..., But weak Af 
---
Yeah, I agree. Having watched both his streams and videos, he's the definition of an ill-mannered player, constantly insulting his opponents, and sometimes even teammates.  
---
The amount of times I have heard the phrase "Survive With Friends, by the way."  
---
It's as if he holds everyone he plays both with and against to an absolutely insane standard and then blames them for not meeting said standard.
---
Hey, both of these memes has my main doing all of the above
---
I feel like that would be too hard to predict to do it on purpose. Unless it was like the preschool basement or Thompson  house porch. Unless people have better knowledge of hatch spawning rules than I do.
---
Motherfucker pulled up some shit from 2011 lmao.
---
Shirtless huntress. DONT CALL FBI
---
You keep dabbing while I play video games lol
---
I tryhard so I'd rather not pip because killer gives hatch for free or depip because killer wants to be nice to the last survivor no matter if they did nothing all game or not
---
-Sorta
---
-that's not the only way but it works as well
---
-my lobbies are fine. Just leave if you have high ping.
---
-Game crashes on load screens so a lot of games are 3 man. This is true.
---
-Never had an issue but I hear other people have.
---
-100% True.
---
-Pretty much
---
-Audio is weird in every new patch for whatever reason. 
---
-This isn't true at all. Once you get to rank 16 then You get screwed over.
---
-I think they listen to the playerbase a little too much but the dev team really need to sort their priorities out. 
---
*calls the FBI*
---
My thought is that the found the hatch after it spawned and dc'd into of it while it was still locked. The odds of this happening coincidentally are pretty high

I never said NOED was balanced, though 3% movement speed is nowhere near 150% movement speed.
---
Kudos to that killer for giving those bullies what they deserve.
---
I recommend trying out a more chill game, and *maybe* uninstalling DBD until you feel you've had a long enough break. You know, if you really feel like you can't stay away.  
---
Minecraft, Stardew Valley, games like that. Something you can play mostly idle-minded, literally just to pass the time.  
---
After enough time has passed, I can almost guarantee you'll feel refreshed when you get back into it.
---
YOU TALKIN' SHIT ABOUT MY BOY BEAST OF PREY?
---
YOU WANNA TUSTLE?
---
This happened to me the other day. I believe it is a bug caused by the plagues perk to block generators in the beginning of the match.
---
I've never lost a nurse as often as in corn. Corn vision makes every killer hate themselves
---
joke...
---
Yeah, and that's a fair point. I just think as it stands right now, it's not necessarily OP,  just a very loaded perk. The way it interacts with Freddy is also a huge middle finger to him, but that seems to be a theme with the poor, wrinkly man.
---
There should be a way to make killers not want to hatch camp anyways
---
Thanks‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Jeez, fine. 
---
But I suppose that circles around to the whole less effort required thing. 
---
But whatever, I'll let you have this, I don't really care to argue about this further. 
---
He can be either weak or annoying. 
---
because kenneth is canonically the entity's favorite, so he's just chilling, enjoying a long and lazy staycation.
---
"Play the game right"
---
The adrenaline speedboost has a much shorter duration whereas noed has the potential to last the rest of the match.
---
The thing is though, despite the nature of Noed, I wouldn't want it be nerfed. It really only needs a counter to make it fair for solo survivors. I think nerfing perks just because of how it makes the other side "feel" is just simply juvenile. 
---
 I was fine with it before ranking system changed. I'd just rather not lose a pip when killer gives last guy hatch or someone gets a pip when I give them hatch

---
That‚Äôs cool 
---
To be fair, you should save the pallets until you actually need them. It's always a bummer when you get to the last gen and find that whole side of the map has none because somebody got too excited.
---
Unlike jet fuel
---
This is if only 2 gens are done or the ones who died did everything while the one who got hatch was trash which is what usually happens when I get against a killer who gives hatch
---
But it makes the blind last longer, so its far from useless
---
Literally

---
So if they die instead of getting hatch do you still lose a pip?
---
I get where the shade comes from. There's some survivors that just throw down pallets without thinking (or looking behind them) and they'll do that every time they get in a chase and go down pretty quickly, screwing their team over in the process.
---
But this guy was just playing poorly. Really poorly. Maybe my teammates were throwing down pallets left and right (probably the Nea, my friend saved her at the end and was bodyblocking for her but she went nowhere with it), but I was routing as best as I could. Even made sure to save the gas station pallet at some point because I knew I was going to get hit anyway.
---
People's perception of the game's crazy sometimes.
---
It would eat your distortion tokens very quickly though.
---
What in the fuck is this? Can you give context? Why are there 2 fucking killers??
---
This bug started when the Plague came out. 
---
If the last guy gets hatch usually only 2 gens were done so you usually don't have enough time to get a pip. If the last guy doesn't get hatch you usually have enough time to get a pip long as you aren't getting tunneled
---
You get them by sacrificing 25 of a certain survivor. (I'm pretty sure it's 25) 
---
?
---
You're right. I'm "trolling" about people trying hard....
---
You definitely had to go through a different class path in high school didnt you?
---
I wish I would knew that
---
I joined the game and noticed we are only 3 then I saw the Billy and ran away after I saw the huntress and got downed from them
---
Yeah darn those premo and spine chill 1 and we'll make it 1. Meta survivors. I cant even. /s
---
I hate seeing it and when I play killer, I make sure they die. Those type of people make solo queue hell. Oddly enough, they never seem to realize why they are jerks for doing what they do.
---
&gt; No problem, but do yourself a favour - Don‚Äôt watch tru3. 
---
That looks like telling him not watch Tru3 if you ask me
---
That‚Äôs impossible how are these 2 killers
---
just remember it's always 10 struggling grunts from the survivors before they wiggle out, helps me time it every time
---
Try harder perhaps? 
---
Gotta risk it for the biscuit. Freddy really isn‚Äôt OP, sure he‚Äôs annoying to play against, but he can‚Äôt hurt you if you‚Äôre awake. Just try to stay immersed around the Freddy so he can‚Äôt sleep you. 
---
I was basing it on the fact you have less than 20 minutes on your account and 1 karma... plus the subject matter of your post.. Now I‚Äôm a little worried you‚Äôre actually being serious.
---
How about you get over legion?
---
Oh ok so if 2 gens are done and last guy gets hatch you depip and if they die you depip. The outcome is still the same to you so you aren‚Äôt affected either way. That‚Äôs what I was asking but I get it now.
---
if you want the smartface skin, you need to sacrifice Claudette 25 times, if you want leaderface skin, you need to sacrifice Dwight 25 times etc
---
Y tho
---
huh weird, thanks! :)
---
Happy cake day!
---
You're acting as if it's very consistent to stab multiple people in a frenzy, but if the survivors don't bunch up right next to each other then you're going to be spending alot of time running to a different part of the map to stab the next guy (who knows he can be seen as you've just stabbed a guy nearby and might not even reach before your frenzy ends) all while not being able to see any scratch marks. Even if they only stab two people and then chase one, the other two survivors are doing gens and will be able to tell that one guy's being chased because his mend timer isn't ticking down.
---
Sure if you have to mend (which is about 15 seconds) and then use self care to heal then you're probably gonna take a whole minute and I agree, that's boring, but then why bother healing yourself if you know its so easy for legion to wound you again? You're not at much of a disadvantage as if the killer frenzies then you're not being hindered by it in terms of health and are just in deep wound, and if they don't frenzy then they are just a normal killer who you can use pallets on or whatever as you please.
---
Point is they become much less effective if you space out as a group, which makes it much harder for them to chain hits together in one frenzy, and if they have to use frenzy multiple times to get hits in chases, it's nowhere near an EZ down if they don't have frank's mixtape and the survivor is competent.
---
finally a balanced match
---
Pretty much
---
That looks fan fucking tastic
---
When two survivors disconnect with five gens left to do, I'm going to fucking slaughter you. That's not fun for me, nor is it fun for the people left behind by their salty ass teammates. Let's be real here. All this game is, is farming for points. Nobody is impressed by looping, nobody cares how pro you are. All anyone with half a brain cares about is blood points. Sorry for trying to be a decent human being and make sure the survivors get *something* when some bitch ass kid pulls their ethernet cable.
---
Not unless everyone who bought them get a refund I didn't pay just to have my killer main be taken
---
nope, it's past it's prime a dying already
---
This game is full of little shits. I bring a green mori as often as possible just to cut their cancerous asses out of my game. 
---
When the last guy doesn't get hatch for free  I don't usually depip

Go play KYF if you have problems
---
REEEEEEEEEEE IT ISNT RELATED TO THE GAME REEEEEEEEEEE
---
Actually, I just got it a few hours ago, which completes my set of adept survivor achievements. It‚Äôs honestly one of the worst sets of perks after d strike got changed. I got it by just accepting that the killer will know where I am. I just stared at the killer almost always and played normally. Just make sure you have a good maps with many loops.
---
I wonder if you have the same opinion regarding OchiDO.
---
Why didnt you just circle noed? Its obviously why you're here.
---
I don't even understand what point you're trying to make
---
I don‚Äôt really know all the accusations against him but isn‚Äôt he like a pedophile?
---
Idk why but I wish there could be a game mode with more than one killer and a few more survivors. 9 Survivors and 3 killers. And instead of fixing just 5 generators the survivors have to fix all 7. I like the the multi killer idea cause some killers could really work well together. I feel like a lot of them could go well with pig. 
---
lol

Not any more, most of the cosmetics require premium currency.  Any cosmetic that isn't a recolor of the originals requires premium currency too
---
Yeah it was always a weird glitch for sure. When it was around, you would usually see a killer join as in the video but the game would usually just crash out (hence the surprise when he actually loads in). It could be because you are seeing it from a survivors‚Äôs POV but most likely it‚Äôs just completely different from the original in terms of how it‚Äôs caused but ends up with the same result.
---
Tenacity and Flip-Flop should be one perk. When used right Unbreakable can make for some amazing plays.
---
Nothing proven about the paedophile part, but he is an infamously toxic player who has started numerous witch-hunts, rallying his prepubescent fans to mass report other players and Twitch streamers.  
---
When talking about toxicity in DBD, he is the extreme.
---
It's always
---
1 - Shirt
---
2 - Pants
---
3 - Head
---
Just follow the scratch marks? I never look for the survivor. I only yet to look when I can either hear th footsteps or the scratch marks are very new. 
---
I would like to know that too. At the beginning I thought it might make me loose health faster but I payed attention and nothing happens.
---
Ash's head and torso are the same cosmetic, his hamd taking a spot of it's own
---
I wish I were skilled enough to add confused Vincent. Still amazing üëç

It's almost as if a 1 killer vs 4 survivor game has more survivors than killers
---
Ash is different. His shirt and head are the same cosmetic.
---
We're in terrible

Something's come along and it's bust our bubble

*Yeah yeah*
---
Mmhmm, idk I‚Äôve never watch tru3 or ochido but if people are watching ochi and decide to go along with him to mass report people they‚Äôre just blind followers without a brain for themselves
---
Nothing brother.
---
Just because you are bad and can't win doesn't mean the killers are tryharding. They are just playing the game.
---
That's both sides TBH. Killers also do it when a survivor does a rant post about a killers perk or power. It's just the way this sub Reddit is. Actually that's the way all social media communities like this are. But anyway my point is it's not just survivors. It's survivors and killers alike, then again u might not notice since there's twice as many survivor mains or more than killer mains. Just scroll through posts u will see wut I'm talking about.
---
Prestige-wise, do you know which comes first?

My like 2nd post on reddit so yeah
---
I seriously say that survivors should have killer collision for two seconds and after that they can just go right though. Solves everything. 
---
So you admit you told him not to watch him?
---
So I'm not crazy?! I thought it was just me.......
---
Happy cake day, bud &lt;3
---
That‚Äôs why you gotta torture survivor mains before sacrificing them to the entity
---
Typical "killer main brain", blaming survivors when killers have ridiculous OP abilities.
---
"Just don't bunch up" and "Just don't heal yourself". 
---
Oh yeah, because I "just wanna make a shit ton of noise so I'm super easy to find."
---
Spaced out? You know you can use frenzy to get across the map super fast, right? Oh yeah, great idea you have there. Don't heal yourself, then when he finds you he can instant down you.
---
*slow clap*

I sadly do not, sorry
---
Then i bet it's shirt and head first, pants and then hand.
---
No, and I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre trying so hard to get my attention
---
Why is clown so short lol
---
Others will call you weak, but i salute you for being kind to the last survivor. God speed to you!
---
Well that explains a lot. Lol
---
Why can‚Äôt you play killer and set an example
---
If you are bad and new at the game you feel like the Killer is strong when in reality it's really balanced.
---
He's kind of in the background, based on the original meme. My angles didn't really do that fact justice 
---
You mean hoping he never finds you? I have found out it's situational. it turns out killers have eyes.
---
What a crybaby
---
Oh man imagine him and Greek doing swf.  This needs to happen!
---
This guy just answered OP‚Äôs question right here ^
---
Usually I do however I want to play more WITH my friends not against them
---
Lol "balanced"
---
Only rework i want is lower the sleep timer,  freddy shouldnt show feet tracks, and he should have faster movement when in dream world. Since he is a dream demon.
---
Cry me a river. You have an entire map designed to help you hide, escape and slow me down. You‚Äôve got flashlights you can spam endlessly that blind me. You got a hatch that gives you a damn free out if you‚Äôre the last survivor. You have team mates to help you. If you get caught, that‚Äôs on you. 
---
Don‚Äôt give me this ‚Äúbut muh side‚Äù shit. I don‚Äôt play killer to care about your feelings. The devs already said it‚Äôs perfectly fine, so you literally have no argument other then you being mad about getting killed. Why in the hell wouldnt i play to my advantage? There‚Äôs no good reason for me to walk off and pretend I don‚Äôt see your team helping you off the hook. 
---
You got caught. You got killed. That‚Äôs the game. Get over it. 
---
someone needs to start a petition
---
Yes until Friday I almost never played surv
---
I assumed he was sitting down, just like in the scene in Wreckit Ralph
---
Didn't even really notice it, but you're right. Every time we manage to get a green ping lobby around tvat time they always dodge. Weird. 
---
Point is, the problem isn't whether or not people follow in the footsteps of a toxic person, it's whether or not the toxic person gets enough support to sustain themselves and continue to be toxic.  
---
Not everyone will do as they do, but by having enough people watch and support them, they can and will spread their toxicity to other people.
---
I was about rank 18-19 at the start of the trial but remember I‚Äôm playing with friends who are rank 20

Where my Leatherface mains at? So proud to have all of them :')

Fun fact. Leather face is the only killer in the game that can wear Blackface ._.

---
Are you really gonna sit there and say being able to vomit on generators is fair? Or being able to vomit that quickly? I'm not saying the game is broken, but it definitely isn't balanced. 
---
Thankfully I won't have to deal with Donald because I'm not american üòÑ

---
Not with that attitude there isn't.
---
All the pallets have already been thrown down
---
I don't get it, even if you didn't have noed, you are already so close to the end, just go grab a drink let them leave and only lose 1 pip instead of 2.....
---
You can‚Äôt control how people choose to entertain themselves, it‚Äôs on twitch or whatever site he streams on to censor him if he‚Äôs breaking their rules, it‚Äôs up to bhvr to ban him (which they have) and those that false report
---
Do you play killer or survivor? I play both and it's easier to notice all the issues on the survivor side, especially the matchmaking/lobby issues. As survivor I have to wait 15 minutes to get a game, and then I get a d/ced from host message, or the ping is so bad that I'm rubberbanding everywhere. The audio is also insanely whacky, especially with Ash's character lines and the chase music blocks out all the other sounds for me.
---
Ehhh.
---
damn
---
Actually add killer nea to the image xD
---
That‚Äôs a great idea!! 
---
eh I really hope we never get a fnaf killer honestly lol
---
You and i both lol
---
I typically run a Bbq, ruin, overcharge, distressing build. Double calm addons and unnerving presence when I finally unlock it rather than overcharge
---
I thought it was going to be a myers. Sad face...

Holy fuck, so many people salty in this thread over something that is completely optional! It's just bonus BP, take it or leave it. 
---
It wouldn't be too bad, just hope the cringey part of the fandom wouldn't come over. 
---
Is he legitimately stupid or does he do shit like this for fun?
---
The only tryhards in this game are the ones that are so desperate for the 4K that they use every scummy tactic imaginable. The game needs to be fun for both sides. 
---
I once had a myers standing right behind me and I didn‚Äôt even see him, he downed me and I jumped outta my chair. We both had a good laugh about it and that really reminded me of how fun it is to play against killers/survivors that play for fun and not just to win.
---
What you‚Äôre saying is just killers doing their job.
---
Some people say its an act, but im convinced he actually shitfaced insane.
---
&gt;Hate to be the bearer of bad news but dedicated servers won‚Äôt fix anything, survivors and killers will both have connection issues and you won‚Äôt be able to blame it on the other side
---
It will fix lag spikes mid match that are caused by the killer's poor connection or simply because someone at his house started overloading their internet. It will also bring a lot of quality of life improvements such as not having to re-invite friends when playing SWF and it will open many doors for different game modes or custom games. 
---
Ah yes. I watched the doctor prance around the other day while I was hooked. 10/10. 
---
When someone is just starting, bodyblocking the hook by just sitting there is one of the most frustrating things that can happen. Sure, they can hit you and down you if you stay around, but given the time loss of a swing, a lot of new players are hesitant to do so. Bodyblocking during the walk-up feels way more fair, and less like an exploit, even though it's not really the most efficient way to do it.
---
So yeah, not necessarily rude, just not what you want to do if you'd like to see the community grow.
---
You can see the water mark you fucking dipshit!!
---
Oh I  thought you had some survivor experience by the way you said campers are getting more frequent...
---
Anywho , I doubt it has anything to do with the free whatever... Rank 20-15 gonna camp no matter what
---
Youre not wrong. Make post about NOED being fine and your Karma will hit zero.
---
I know you can. It's my watermark. Dumbass.
---
Sparten...
---
I should‚Äôve said everything rather than anything, dedicated servers a basically just a massive QoL change that can‚Äôt come soon enough
---
Maybe next time. First time was Amanda, now Bing Bong Boy...next should be Myers I guess :)
---
You use your name
---
What? 
---
I litterally dropped my controller on lerys and a myers popped out of no where.

---
Yeah true.The maps are too short.I think that if we really did do multi-killer the maps would have to be bigger.But it‚Äôs still a good idea the devs should consider 
---
I've noticed a change in killers this past week: there have been more Billy's, LF's, Myers, Nurses, Legions, Huntresses and a few Trappers. Its obvious MoM centered builds are to blame since those killers can counter it whereas the other M1 based killers can't. As far as Thicc boi goes, I Can't say much about prior to this past week, but now he's lumped in with the other primary M1 killers who get wrecked by MoM builds, and I haven't encountered a single Clown since its introduction.

I'm not saying this is the only reason of course, because many have pointed out that as great as Clown is for anti-looping, he doesn't maintain good map pressure and its really easy to gen rush him. An expert Clown player can work past this by downing and hooking players quickly enough to change the survivor teams focus from gens to rescues and healing, but there aren't that many who've taken the time to become experts with him, so most matches against Clown end with more escapes than kills. With that being stated, factor in the introduction of MoM and the new "multi 2nd chance builds" it enables, and Clowns effectiveness is practically rendered moot. 
---
I for one am actually happy about the introduction of MoM, because now I'm getting really good with Nurse and Legion, whereas before when I played killer I mained Doctor, but am having significantly more difficult matches with him since MoM became meta overnight. I'm usually up for a challenge, but out of frustration, I now have a new challenge: learning killers I don't normally play. 
---
Originally I played Legion for the first week they came out, but because of all the backlash and DC'ing, I had given up on playing them at all. However, since they counter MoM builds, I've picked up on playing Legion again, and have been having a blast with them while watching survivor teams screw themselves over with petty DC's. That's right survivors... The MoM Meta made me play Legion again... so technically this is your fault.
---
I wish I had the video footage to show but sadly I dont
---
Or, you could go fuck yourself, and stop giving your opinion where it's not wanted.
---
Play Freddy at the higher ranks and check back in. He can be bullied extremely hard by good survivors.
---
You could‚Äôve done the PS4 replay
---
This was my exact build while doing the wiggle achievement 
---
Batshit insane!
---
If I have a MOMENT of doubt I can't get them to the hook I want. I take them to nearest one.
---
If it's the first survivor you can pretend to be friendly and then get them.
---
Its a terrible aura perk, one of the worst ones in the game. 
---
True :/
---
I‚Äôve seen a few clips of this and it has happened for me once
---
Why not under? üòè
---
Wait a second I just realized you are three people, but you need 5 gens. How?
---
Thank you....
---
Okily dokily
---
I think that they should buff Blindness to be extremely disorienting along with its current effect. Not quite to the point of the Afterpiece Tonic's effect, but still something seriously adverse. 
---
The problem is I never play killer and the few times I do, I have absolutely no useful perks or offerings so I basically suck and it‚Äôs humiliating - and the survivors will let me know. I hate that all the daily‚Äôs are for killers. At least one should be for survivors 
---
Moon walk. Good luck getting them to let you get close enough to tango though.
---
Can you imagine though? Like... killers aren't trying to work together, they need most kills. So Hilly-Billy chainsaws you and picks you up, but WHAM, Huntress sinks a hatchet into his back and you hop free.
---
Very cool, keep it up 
---
Ffs
---
Oh, that was a really old bug back in the day. Fun to see again :D
---
If you really want that sort of effect, run Third Seal. 
---
I think exhaustion is much better on the RBT. It is actually quite strong because they can't use those perks while affected by it. It's not quite the power of Clown's exhaustion add ons but it's okay. 
---
You will get good one day
---
Yeah, you wouldn't be able to fake that one easily, at least not on PS4.
---
I'll write this here so idk,
---
So I joined a normal play as survivor group and the searching for match time was hella long then I saw 4 survivors and all was pretty much normal then we loaded into the game and saw that we are 3 people and we all went to a gen, when we saw the Billy I ran away and after a while I see the huntress coming to me and after that I got downed hooked and I got a dc bc my PS4 is poop rn
---
Also [here's an example of a two killer match.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NDLSfr49co)
---
Dcing before the killer founds you is not "pulling the cable" also!
---
True, and the theorizes aren't that bad
---

---

---
Got scared by the Ninja Wraith. Love it. 
---
Not sure if a lesbian or...
---
I'm a dude lol 
---
Hell yes, two killers vs 6 survivors would be perfect
---
I agree this is why Myers should never go into tier 3 because its too OP. And chainsaw dude needs to run speed limiter or else hes a sweaty tryhard loser
---
I feel as if the issue is how devs made a whole lot of nerfs to slugging like changes to max recovery and such, yet keep adding more and more perks that also counter that playstyle.
---
 Slugging is still very strong, but very situational, which makes the perks to counter it also situational.
---
Amazing, what are your power? 
---
You seem to love to exaggerate a lot. 
---
I only suggested the not healing thing since you complained about it taking forever to mend and heal only for you to be hurt again so quickly by their frenzy anyway. He wouldn't insta down you either if you're competent, it's not like if you're wounded it's an instant game over, especially in Legion's case where they have to rely on their frenzy to win chases.
---
I've played legion and frenzy isn't super fast at all, you'll have no problem hitting people close to you but people on the edge of your terror radius you have to be pretty lucky. Keep in mind the survivors are going to be running away from you the moment they realise you can see them in frenzy. This is why if you bunch up all of you are gonna be mending whereas if you stay apart and work on individual gens then at most he can probably stab two of you.
---
Also I'm by no means a killer main, I main survivor and I'm not biast here, I'm just offering my opinion. Legion's power isn't OP if it isn't buffed to high hell with the mixtape and the strats. It doesn't warrant dc'ing in the slightest
---
We need more of this in the community
---
Yes you can. When you stun or drop a pallet. Start healing and you can probably fail a skill check quickly buying you a load of extra time.
---
i'd much rather not play at all instead of playing vs a killer that is roleplaying nurse.
---
It used to happen sometimes back in the day
---
As long as I jump scare some survivors with M&amp;A Myers, it‚Äôs a perfect game for me.

I'm with you, OP. A lot of players are predictable about when they'll time their saves, and that's not my fault. I walk away for about 15 seconds or so, turn around, and they usually are unhooking right when I turn the last corner. It's not your fault that a bunch of players act exactly the same way, and you've AdApTeD to that. People are always going on about how everyone else should learn to adapt, up until they actually do.
---
Me. Meg. killer. hag. Gg
---
I like you already. However see back in a days the animation of vault went after pressing spacebar immediately. They fixed it but so it wont vacum but the vault option range stayed the same but it triggers when you are right in front of the window and by this time he managed to bb you
---
***STOP RESISTING***
---
Oh you mean the blades?
---
ohh i think i get it, it‚Äôs kinda unfair though considering he was in cool down from the frenzy mode and technically i probably could‚Äôve fast vaulted over if it had just worked üò≠ but just good ol dbd for you. it b like dat sometimes 
---
The point is he dont lose collision with you while he is in fatigue
---
I‚Äôm just annoyed that survivors honestly don‚Äôt have good perk selection. Killers have amazing perks. Their aura reading perks are phenomenal, perks to help with chase, perks to slow gens down, end game perks. 
---
At this point it‚Äôs not fair killers get a lot of cool and intriguing builds while survivors are stuck with mediocre situational perks. 
---
Seriously for these perks to be kinda decent you have to stack them and then hope the killer isn‚Äôt by a hook or leaves you on the floor. 
---
Yeah its 25 
---
You don't lose points, you forfeit whatever you would have earned in the match you bitched out from. De-ranking isn't a punishment lol 
---
Oh, so he's a little pussy in addition to being a dumbass too.

Around the 13th of every month I believe, maybe 14th

May as well teabag the survivors body since you're there. Makes for an entertaining Mori 
---
Yea, iron grasp use to be one of the best perks, i used it in almost every game as there was basically no point of trying to struggle free, i believe at first it was like 50% and then it was 36% and now its 12%. it sucks that they completely ruined it but atleast sabotage isnt permanent anymore.
---
No no. Thats okay. I understand I am student as well.
---
I will crush survivor skull like sparrow's egg, between my thighs
---
A whopping 100% of this post is just a bunch of numbers being thrown into the air!
---
They still get xp and bp. 
---
You‚Äôre mostly hurting yourself rather than the killer. Survivor wait times tend to be longer than a killers and on top of that your only going down further in rank. 
---
If anything I laugh when I see a survivor quit, I don‚Äôt think killers really mind unless they want an achievement. By quitting you only show the killer you‚Äôre salty instead of just dying so it tends to make them happy that they pushed you to that edge. 
---
Just like when a survivor gets a thrill they made a killer dc, the killers are pleased when they make a survivor dc. It also does them a favor of having a man down which leads to easier kills. 
---
Yah the devs have been really pushy on killer daily‚Äôs! Wish it would be more balanced out but we all know they push more killer daily‚Äôs to fill those rooms, if anything make them 90k and more people would gladly do them. But like anything they make this game a grind fest and no damn double blood point event forever now! Just had spring break with new survivor and nothing! 
---
This isn‚Äôt the hag dummy!
---

That‚Äôs also another possibility, I don‚Äôt think they would care enough to be affected negatively.

hm, or maybe something like instead of sparkling matter its like a little space void (like the intro with the spiral and doors and stuff in it but it fits in his hand,)
---
I have been noticing the reverse but i almost only play killer. More people dc before the hook/third these last few days than i recall.  Dbd had a sale on ps4 and is f2p on xbx for now. I feel like this is why we have had a surge of these people on consoles.
---
Made it to rank 6 three times as Killer (I usually don't run meta perks on good killers, so I stagnate a lot.) with a 360 controller, and I'm a red ranks survivor towards the end of each month as well.
---
That said, M+K is objectively better for both in ease of turning and overall accuracy, but feels more annoying to me for crouched movement / movement in general. Can't pull sick YouTuber 360's with a controller, though.
---
Some people honestly do better overall with controller, even having gave it a month to make the switch to M+K myself being one. Comfort is most important, so that you don't have to think about physically controlling your character.
---
I once lead the last person to the hatch after hooking all hid friends... and i had one of those yellow moris... He was so close...
---
He got fucked, and i laughed
---
Never too late to start. 
---
Just depends on how much you can take. You‚Äôll be starting at the bottom of bottom ranks. It‚Äôs horrible down there. 
---
It's honestly probably the new ranking system. People just dont give a shit anymore. So they arent afraid to depip and just quit.

What does Plague have to do with Blindness? 
---
Rn i'm saving up for Wraith and Feng Min, plus I rarely play Legion.
---
But as a killer, you want the survivors to do that ( I love chasing pallet happy people). If OP was actually using every single pallet as the killer suggested, then there is no excuse as to why he didn't catch him. Just sounds salty that he got looped
---
Yep, just had two in a row do it. First one did it as soon as someone go their hex ruin. The second did it because we did a generator.
---
That's like finding a shiny Pokemon! I wanna be in a game with two killers... That sounds hilarious.
---
Sorry to hear about your medical problems, man.
---
Fuck drunk drivers.
---
Its because if you are going to put the time into a killer you might aswell just play huntress since she rewards you more when you get better as her than clown does. Clown is too simple.
---
As I understand it, it has something to do with the increases stacking multiple times after being stabbed instead of just once or twice for the addons themselves.
---
ill quit against toxic players sometimes 
---
last night i played against a claudette who pallet looped which was fine. but she teabagged everytime she did which is not fine but a dick thing to do. so i chose to camp her once i finally hooked her so she wouldnt survive. i let the others do the gens while she laid on the hook dying. 
---
i had killed another player earlier and didnt camp. i only camp against people who act like that claudette. 
---
anyway ash tried to pull her off right in front of me so i grabbed him off and dropped him but in the time it took to do all that jane unhooked claudette and took  a hit for her giving her the chance she needed to gain distance and make it unlikely id catch her before she escaped. 
---
so i pushed the ps button and closed application knowing it would make them not gain any points and would depip. 
---
it wasnt fair to the other two unfortunately but the claudette didnt deserve points!
---
at least thats how i choose to justify my behavior 
---
If he timed a switch well, or knows how to traffic tamper at the right time he could have had it so it already loaded the data for the 4 people but as soon as it loaded kicked the players. Really crazy and I‚Äôm not sure you could even have that sorta thing timed that well.. but I guess it‚Äôs ‚Äúpossible‚Äù. He could have also just been lying and tried taking credit for having a bad connection. Fucked up though regardless üëé
---
I do play both, but haven‚Äôt played any of these killers yet. Idm really lol, but idk how to play these guys yet. 
---

Im geussing your one of the Fortnite bad minecraft good kids
---
Suck my dick I don't care about you, your 'sympathy', or downvotes lmao. Downvote that.
---
Unpopular opinion: playing against Doc is more frustrating than legion.
---
It's still the best addon to use to blind a killer at pallets, its nearly a free escape if you use it properly.
---
And IDC about its rarity, I have like +100 stored in my inventory
---
I mean why fortnite, its just uuh cringe
---
uhhhhh........
---
Ok but imagine the possibilities with killer tag teams
---
Trapper and Myers so Myers can stalk off a trapped survivor
---
Freddy and Wraith so no one know where anyone is
---
Pig and Legion, the real survivors
---
Lol what a salty bitch
---
Oh yeah. Im sure if you got a killer you are used to you could farm up a hefty amount with bbq. I can get between 60-80k per match so its really only about 12 matches to get a million. 
---
-15 karma in 2 hours. Ouch.
---
He would rage so much
---
I need it
---
There's also no reason for it to not have two eFFects.
---
Usually when I do that I shake my head a few times then just put my camera to the ground in shame and walk around a bit. If we are farming I legit feel bad when I fuck up :(
---
Saw that and immediately went from "Hey, that looks pretty cool" to "OC- DO NOT STEAL!"
---
Generic how? The two I mentioned are pretty unique. If twisty is generic then the clown we already have is generic too. I just dont know.

I'm buying him.

I like how you have to point out that you said reddit username as if we weren't on reddit

Have you never played as or against Legion?

I agree.

it amazes me how people get triggered by this add on when Michael has one that lets him stare at you for 5 minutes then get an instakill
---
Jane is the snack.
---
I don‚Äôt just think, I know rank doesn‚Äôt matter in this game. Just ask anyone who has over 1k hours what they think of rank in DBD.
---
I'm a fan of spinning in circles myself
---
Ok i think rank matters but to each their own i suppose. 
---
Fair point. 
---
Playing against Myers with Tombstone Piece = Fun because you have a challenging chase
---
Playing against Legion with Franks Mixtape = Crap because he get's you if he wants you, no matter what
---
How many hours do you have in DBD?
---
No offense, but are you forgetting that there are 4 survivors and 1 killer? Killer perks have to be inherently stronger because there are, well, four times as many survivors. 
---
okay so I didnt read the post, only the TL;DR, but why should a perkless killer be viable vs full-perked survivors, provided both are of equal skill?
---
I agree add-onless should be viable, because itemless survivors are very viable as well, and add-ons are nowhere near consistent enough, but perks are a consistent boost. A good killer will shit on  bad survivors even without perks, but there is no objective reasoning for a perkless killer to beat perked out survivors if there isn't a massive skill disparity. 
---
So I think each power should be tuned to function properly without add-ons like Billy, Spirit, Huntress, Nurse and Hag. But perks arent the same thing, and complaining about losiing when youre perkless is ludicrious. 
---
Listen I didn‚Äôt come here to be made fun of. I‚Äôm just playing it‚Äôs a play on of my name
---
2k...
---
Yep, both. Got womped a couple times.  Got out a couple times. I've done ok with legion the two times I played as them. I've only been playing for about a month. Why shouldn't a killer play legion?
---
Okay.
---
What‚Äòs winning and what isn‚Äòt? Is it pipping? Is it getting 4 kills? 
---
To me, it‚Äòs getting a bunch of points so 4 stacks of BBQ is my win. 
---
I don‚Äôt care if I get slaughtered right away, I never DC 
---
12
---
Interesting......very interesting 
---
ye its like mac n cheese i get it. i was laughing bc it's funny not to make fun
---
Oh my god yes, it would be chaos.
---
Lol. 
---
He didn't body block your window. The Entity blocked you.  It's a nerf they did for survivors to balance the game. Because survivors would endlessly loop windows and walls, vaulting so the killer could literally not catch them.
---
When you play along with a joke its2 called "Yes, and"ing, you forgot the And part of the joke.
---
Survivors DC at a far higher rate than killers
---
Meh... yeah its just selfish behavior at that rank if he was 15-20 id say its just out if fear.
---
A nice QOL idea, indeed. I'd like this. 
---
I get it now 
---
I agree Killers need to be stronger, but I don't think giving them better perks than Survivors is the way to do that. Survivors should get more interesting, stronger perks, but maps should be balanced more in the Killer's favor. Then no one is bored.
---
Because people don‚Äôt like that he can vault pallets and how he has some op add ons like franks mix tape and the blades
---
Yeah man. I care about rank. Ive played with people better than me and ive played with potatoes. I feel rank matters im more inclined to trust the abilitys of a rank 4 and below than a rank 10 and above.
---
He is arguably the most broken, unfun thing BHVR has ever put into the game. Even killer mains are disgusted at Legion‚Äôs existence in the game. Hell just scroll up or down a few posts and you will see someone making fun of Legion or demanding he gets removed from the game.
---
Only makes sense that way
---
Whichever one has Feng Min in, she has a gen skill that has a chance to ignore skill checks.
---
Doesn't mean you shouldn't play as them though. They're in the game
---
thathappened
---
No.
---
The game has kind of an obscure learning curve, but if you have someone experienced teach you, or learn from a streamer for example, your biggest obstacle will be perks, and itdoes not take long at all if you know how to properly grind everything in order and know how to level up efficiently. 
---
For your early matcxhes youll be Rank 20-15, which is almost exclusively newer players. 
---
I'm upvoting you just so you don't get hive mind downvoted by the people who wanted you to give them mercy.
---
What a dickhead. He could've saved you and farmed gens and then gotten hatch after you left if he wanted it that bad.
---
So do Margaritas 
---
All of that is true.
---
But it's also super fun and addicting.
---
r/woooosh
---
(also just a recommendation but if you want some recommendation for a good streamer who you can learn from I suggest ZubatLEL, he plays both sides and is really good at the game + can give good advice) 
---
Shortly and Simply there are four survivors and one killer, any "bad" killers (those who cant deal with loops) need meta perks to deal with a perkless survivior. As in; a survivor doesn't need perks to loop, but a killer needs perks to counter it, and there are four survivors who will work on generators.
---
Except almost all the perks are way too situational to work in builds so even if you did make an entire build around a certain style then you would be lucky for your perks to even get used.
---
I honestly prefer sugar for those but I don‚Äôt knock anyone going for salt.
---
Or you know, just a bug.
---
Yeah but what about these hits tru palets or vaults who are SOMETIMES fucked up and what about the hitboxes what about the hatchets? I think that there is not enough complaints about that here and when someone says something about that he gets downvoted in oblivion.
---
I spam my attack to make it look like I'm waving them goodbye
---
Downvotes n gives a stupid reply instead of actually saying how it's cringe. Looks like I'm right. 
---
Then you don't play the full spectrum of the game IMO  
---
Often I see gen rush survivors. 1 dead 3 go out with 9-13k points. 
---
No attempt to save their mate, bait the killer, etc 
---
Meaning no points in these categories. Yes you get these sweet 5k points for the escape. 
---
But I die happily after a long game with 25k points instead of pressing m1 for god damn 5mins straight.
---
Again: only my opinion. 
---
Same thing with spirit Fury myers and Nurse. Except they can actually hurt you. Legion with his strongest add on needs three hits. Weak compared to a good Hillbilly.
---
It's a broken perk. Even when I rush exit and meet all the requirements, it still fails 9/10 times, even when the killer is in front of the locker.
---
The reason why 4 Head is better than flashlights is cuz you just gotta press space when the animation ends. Even if they have agitation, they‚Äôre fucked
---
[Apply directly to fore head](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsz8dVXTsmQ) 
---
Hitboxes are complained about constantly and need to be fixed. A lot of people have complained about lunge hitboxes being very broken right now.
---
And hits through pallets and windows should be fixed. More-so windows since they're far more buggy I find. I think lunging through a pallet and potentially getting a hit should award risky play but it doesn't feel fun when you vault a window and get hit like 5 meters away from it.
---
Boil over is used with slugging perks anyway. It would be useful if the aura reading is in the whole map and the slugging speed is 12% faster (1.9 seconds are not much but still more useful).
---
Sole survivor has zero effect until everyone is dead? I thought the range was just shorter.
---
I did that one a while ago, too. ;D
---
Just tried it out and yep it‚Äôs definitely bugged. Crazy mend times 
---
We'll Make It is one of the best default perks. I'd replace Dark Sense with it once you get it from the bloodweb. Kindred and Unbreakable are fine, though if you're not getting slugged often, I'd replace that with something else too. Maybe with Bond since that's a Dwight perk.
---
I had one this morning.
---
Other than that maybe once a month or so
---
The Emblems are the point of the game, they decide whether you pip or not. That *is* viability. If they weren't then whats the point of this post. .\_.

(If it wasn't a Cypress Mori) she should've downed him and spammed mori until he had 1% left on his bleedout timer. What a fucking cunt leaves their allies for dead when the Killer is being friendly. That's like having someone buy you ice cream so you punch their dog in the face.
---
Probably the best Huntress cosplay I've seen on here, great job. 
---
I really want to make an improved version of this meme, in large part just to complain about how garbage certain mechanics are in this game.
---
If I have you as a Teammate and you DC, then you are basically trash to me. Even if he is tunneling. The time he needs for that is important for doing gens. By DCing early you do nothing but fucking other Survivors up.
---
No it does but it is still a perk preying on your dead teammates, and it would be better to have a perk to help keep them alive.
---
Imagine: Unbreakable, Tenacity, Flip Flop, and self care and the killer decides to slug
---
so youre saying Billy is unviable? Because that's literally what  the emblems tell you. 
---
You judge viability based on the ability to 4k relative to the map-consistency and survivor-skill.
---
Nurse is the most viable because all of her bad maps  are a result of bugged spots, and she completely ignores survivor skill.
---
Spirit is very viable because she mostly ignores survivor skill and has no real bad  maps. 
---
Billy is viable because he has atool against soime loops and has only a few really bad maps, and can easily shit on average survivors. 
---
Freddy is trash because he's countered by 2 perks, an item, has a shitload of bad maps, and an overall awful power. 
---
According to the emblems Freddy is stronger than Billy because he gets chaser easier and with a Class Photo he can get a lot of Gatekeeper. 
---
Not on console
---
To BM
---
Ok well obviously we're two people with different opinions, as every story has two sides so do opinions. You can do you and I'll end this here. Enjoy your day :D 
---
Killers can be strong without making survivors boring. No offense though if you didn‚Äôt know that! 
---
You can loop legion.
---
BHVR just released a new game mode: sandbox 
---
/s
---
ü§ó I appreciate you as a person
---
What does this post even mean? 
---
Too much because you mori‚Äôd him?
---
Self heal, sprint burst, adrenaline. Yeah typical brown ranks sure. And people complain about bbq and ruin. Like wtf
---
You‚Äôve got issues.
---
How so?
---
you too  uwu 
---
In Identity V theres a 8v2 mode. 7 cyphers (gens) that take longer to complete, survivors have 3 health and everyone get points by doing what they do and can upgrade themselves with it. Also adds an additionnal timer to the rocket chair(hook) of 45 seconds where the survivor cannot be saved. Tons of fun
---
Just make it its own game mode, 3 survivors get triple BP for everything they do, kills also do but are now competing with another killer. More tension, less camping, when nobody wins everybody wins!
---
I‚Äôve always felt the same way. Other killers have really strong add ons that down you just as fast or faster and they get way less hate. Tbh i rarely play against franks/cold dirt legions and most don‚Äôt tunnel one survivor unless no one else is around for them to hit
---
It looks like you missed the actual skill check, slightly to the left. 
---
Hag is such a well-designed killer. /s
---
(‚óè¬¥œâÔΩÄ‚óè)
---
just two much in general he was the only decent player on the map and he did a bang up job at keeping me at bay haha, it was mainly a thought, the stabbing in the chest should have been enough did she have to get so angry with him after XD it was ment to be a jokey post sorry if i didn't make it clear enough 
---
Huntress doesn‚Äôt ignore pallets. 
---
Billy can be looped. 
---
Thanks for the clarification, sole survivor is a perk I‚Äôm not super familiar with. You are probably right that it would be better to take something else. I also didn‚Äôt even think about just 99% healing, that‚Äôs brilliant. 
---
*Insert plastic straw* now you can drink straight from the source!!
---
To be fair it might be hard to see through that big pig head
---
Did you at least pip?
---
That man had a family.
---
That would be so awesome. You're running through the meat section, and all the meat has been butchered sloppily and is putrid. You run through the pet section, and all the litter is spilled, creating a slip trap for both killers and survivors.
---
I don‚Äôt play survivor that much but I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve faced all the killers except the clown. Dunno why 
---
I think BHVR should know that there‚Äôs a fine line between ‚Äòadjusting it to make it not too powerful, but still be useful‚Äô and ‚Äòobliterating it‚Äô. 
---
Hey
---
Shake
---
That

Ass for me

Re: Plague opening:
---
If Plague doesn't have options for loops in your eyes, you don't know how to handle loops. You only really have to get them once as her, as looping around half the loops in each map opens them to being broken.
---
Your best bet is short-wall loops, and knowing when to not eat / break the pallet and instead force them to play it. (In general, not Jungle Gyms, yes to L walls with bloodlust, no to long building loops, yes to anything you could perform a lunge around.)
---
Plague is actually in a really good spot, as a 115% killer that can safely break survivors.
---
Re: Killers should be viable without perks in the mix:
---
Every killer is quantifiably viable against a team of 4 survivors who are also without perks.
---
Dang. Sorry dude
---
Depends how you define fun and fair.
---
To me dbd is not just a online multiplayer game but also a survival horror.   So for me I think the game should be tilted in favor of the killer.  And only via group teamwork can survivors stand a chance.  Yes I acknowledge that's difficult especially in a multiplayer scenario where your don't necessarily know your partner's...  But isn't that reasonable given the theme of the game itself?
---
I have always said and will continue to maintain that the only real problem dead by daylight has is toxic survivors.  Extremely skilled Loopers armed with flashlights literally going out of their way to get found by the killer just delete them for days. Then sticking around in game long after the gates are powered simply because they're not afraid of the killer and want to make their life miserable.  There really isn't that equivalent for the killers.  And given the nature of the game itself, there needs to be some sort of logical fear of the killer. Right now that fear doesn't exist. So makes it very difficult for the killer to have fun. But excruciatingly  easy for a survivor.
---
Why not? We should buff them and killer. I feel weak no matter who i play. 
---
4 Legions, the entire gang stabs you 50 times and you spend 20 minutes mending each time.
---
Okay Billy can be looped. Billy can also insta down. Legion can't do that. He may be annoying, but also pretty weak.
---
That happened to my friend last night but on console. How strange.
---
.  &lt;--- on
---
The same way every other killer tunnels.  They just have to wait 7 seconds later to do it lol.
---
Yea
---
It's a mindlessly easy way to play the game that any rank 20 first day can perform.  It takes zero skill.  It's not a matter of effectiveness, it's simply a sad way to have to crutch out your kills.
---
Judging by what it is, most likely a new nurse addon. Ultra rare maybe?
---
Same man. I don‚Äôt understand all the nea hate.
---
Implying Minecraft could ever be considered bad?
---
I run Nurses Calling. I saw another Nea healing herself, so I dropped this dude to go thwack the Nea and put a RBT on her head. HOW ARE YOU MAD THAT IM PLAYING THE GAME?! 
---
And the Meg was on the hook. What, was I supposed to camp her??
---
Mother and son go on a hunting trip
---
Interesting if this is legitimate as it'd be a relatively recent find. 
---
Clown is without a doubt the rarest for me too but i'm really suprised you are saying the same about Pig and Spirit. I only hover at rank 8-10 as Survivor but Pig and Spirit is super common atleast for me.
---
**DELETED**; I deleted this because of the negative feedback. I obviously don't know enough about the game or playing to make valid points. Sorry.
---
Same dude
---
I play on pc rank 8 and today I played against around 6 or 7 clowns. Lol.
---
To be fair ping highly depends on where youre living. Im in Israel so I never get less than 150-200 if the killer doesnt live there too. But it doesnt have any major impact on gameplay until 300+
---
&gt;I hardly play against Legions x.x
---
I think I know..  ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
That's fair.
---
Okay, I hope this helps:
---
Most loops are about one tile. This refers to how the game spawns them in. (Squares positioned along the map building the play area.)
---
- If it's long enough that they can run a circle around it 3 times then throw the pallet, it's considered safe. Cars on Autohaven are the best example. You run those without being fancy, and usually the quickest way to end them is to break the pallet after.
---
- Then you have unsafe loops. These are short (as in length, not height) walls with a long wall or building attached. For the ones with a long wall attached, go straight at them like a safe loop and they'll usually throw the pallet. If they don't throw it and try to play it with the short wall, or if it's attached to a building, you can run back and forth around the short wall and make them throw the pallet, vault, and lunge into them.
---
- There's also incredibly unsafe loops like a pallet between two rocks. You can safely mindgame these once by making them throw the pallet while rounding the rock. This gives you lunge range on both sides, and you can force them to play it. If they don't throw it, just eat the pallet and skip breaking it, to continue chasing if they leave, or if they decide to stay you can lunge them.
---
- There's also Jungle Gyms. Most common type of these are T-Wall, L-Wall Jungle Gyms. These have two windows, so you basically want to run them opposite of the windows to deny fast vaults, and force them to stay on the L-Wall. From there, they'll get paranoid about bloodlust and run sometimes scoring you a hit if they're not near another loop, or stay and eat a lunge from you.
---
- Pseudos are multiple tile loops, usually involving multiple windows and / or a building. If you don't have time to safely bloodlust them, or run Bamboozle, just leave and go for survivors on gens.  Yes, they can't progress the match while on those, but you also can't get them for a long while, so you don't want to fall for that.
---
Other than that, always chase survivors and eat pallets if they throw super early or seem bad at keeping track of you. They're weak links.
---
As far as you saying pipping should be totally viable perkless, I disagree unless survivors are as well. I think killers like the Pig getting very low points in Deviousness, even when riding their power all match, is a huge problem, especially.where an average Legion is pretty much guaranteed to pip. 
---
That's as far as I would agree on it, but the ranking system is definitely janky as it stands.

Use that 4% chance of unhooking yourself. 
---
By your post and comments it seems like you‚Äôre more mad than he was...
---
I was thinking it‚Äôs a survivor item that gets rid of exhaustion. 
---
But that wouldn‚Äôt make sense for balance purposes and rarities. 
---
What is up with all the Survivors complaining so hard about "Tryhard" killers today. I bet in reality you are just such a shitty survivor that can't even loop or get away from the killer properly and instantly goes down and dies. Threatening to DC is so damn pathetic and should have consequences. You ruin a whole match for your team just because you are a salty bitch.
---
I just played a game as killer against a rank 8 swf, I'm a rank 14. The only thing that gave me the slightest chance was blood warden and noed and even then they all escaped with borrowed time. That sure was a lot of fun for me. 
---
Ia! Ia! Cthulhu Ftaghn!
---
NEA IS A KILLER
---
I have just now realized how much cooler Freddy's claw look without Prestige. 
---
I agree that the survivors have to fight for points, but hear me out. If a survivor escapes and depips then they either gen rushed (which should be avoided anyway), or did nothing and got carried. If a killer 4k‚Äôs and depips then they most likely either facecamped or stomped hard, but wait, even lore wise killers are supposed to play with their food. Meaning that you can get more emblems by doing so (also everything that I said matters less in red ranks, as the requirements are way too high)
---
I will break you my friend do not fuck me.
---
This sub will downvotes both sides of a arguement. Its senseless sometimes. Besides that i think tossing pallets left and right when gens arent popping isnt cool but if your keeping him busy for good team members its legit. 
---
I'm a wraith main :(
---
No but survivors quitting ruins the whole match for 3 other players. It's just as bad as when killers DC.
---
Uhhhhh every killer has some skill required to play them effectively...
---
Trapper requires you to have good trap placement, Wraith when and when not to cloak, Hillbilly when and how to chainsaw without bumping into him etc.
---
I concede that some killers are easier than others (Hillbilly and Leatherface) but to suggest killers like Hag and Spirit have no skill cap is disingenuous.
---
nah, Deliverance is fine the way it is. it's a high risk, high reward perk after all.
---
The problem is that I play to win and want more variety in builds that are consistently good. Situational builds are just not reliable enough to do that.
---
S A U C E
---
Lol we literally mentioned that when we saw how this pic came out :p
---
We really don't need every Survivor having 7 attempts to run from the killer...
---
As a 80/20 surv/killer player, I generally ignore killer dailies unless they're for killers I actually like to play (Trapper, Spirit) but the most annoying is when it gives me something like "Kill a survivor by your hand as Legion" or something where it's a killer I have at level 1 and have no intention of leveling up or ever playing as, let alone level up enough to get a mori for. It is what it is though, I just trash them or ignore them.
---
you would enjoy a raging guy and a racist? 
---
Looks like you went down at the end since 1 gen still needed to be done and she was mid lunge right when you cut the video short. I need to see the full video for your story to be believable.
---
It eliminates the Nurse‚Äôs ability to blink. 
---
Nah, I have no idea but I‚Äôm super intrigued now as well. 
---
Ok where should i send the whole video
---
That's what people that are bad usually say, or people who cant aim and rely on lag a lot.
---
And if you look closely you can see that i dodged it.
---
I‚Äôm not going to get into an argument with you over this. Have a nice day :)
---
Now, do not take this the wrong way, but if you spend a good amount if time using off-meta and underappreciated perks, even if they aren't used in a good chunk of your games, you'll start developing strategies and playstyles that'll let you play just as well without them. 
---
I haven't used Self Care for anything other than an occasional meme build in years, I survive just as well. I also rarely use exhaustion perks and pip a good portion of the time, though less frequently since the rank update. I just gotta adapt my playstyle a bit more to be more altruistic as that is where I usually lack. 
---
There is a big difference between the two. There is still a way to counter tombstone Myers and even for the killer, it's not easy pulling it off. You can loop Myers, keep him busy or even outplay him. That's why these add-ons are not considered OP.
---
Against a Legion, there is NOTHING you can do. You just have to accept the fact that you're going to get hit. You can't outplay his power, you can't loop him, dodge his hits or remotely counter his power. He needs to use his power one more time after the intial use to down and you just have to accept that.
---
A successful end for me is if I get lots of blood points and have a fun game where the survivors also have some fun too.
---
Literally nothing about my post indicates I was mad lol I just have NO idea why the dude messaged me. Like, what was his logic? And did he think I owed him an explanation lol
---
I thought it spawns after two gens and just doesn't open 
---
Clown is my fourth favorite killer, and I play him with some regularity, but frankly I think the problem is that he‚Äôs kind of a basic bitch.  His power really only does one thing, there aren‚Äôt a lot of ways you can be innovative or creative while playing clown.  He has no real map pressure, he has no real mind games, he has no real perk combos, his area denial is pretty pathetic compared to other area denial characters, all Clown really does is shorten loops by 1 rotation and/or force survivors onto a different loop.  And I‚Äôm not saying that that isn‚Äôt a strong ability, in a game so heavily focused around looping having the ability to saw off 25% of each chase is nothing to laugh at, it‚Äôs just not that interesting though.  He‚Äôs just a roided up M1 bitchboi, and I feel like a lot of people play him a few times due to how highly he gets placed on most tier lists (always upper B or lower A) then get bored and switch to a more complex killer.  Which is a shame, because I think Clown is one of the most aesthetically well designed killers with some of the best written and deepest lore, so it‚Äôs a shame the character it‚Äôs attached to is so mechanically bland.
---
I see whats happening here. 
---
If you teabag at a killer- yes, it‚Äôs a bm; to another survivor it‚Äôs a friendly greeting of camaraderie
---
Ummmmm lmao...
---
This is great, your lighting is fantastic!  
---
And like the others said, it's just the cutest thing ever &lt;3  
---
I done stuff like this. If i notice team mates not doing anything i try to punish them appropriately. 
---
Depends. But for the most part yeah. Nothing should work for the other killer too. Like if one killer had noed or bbq, only that killer can see the aura or use noed.
---
Agreed. I am in a queue as we speak (solo) and have been here for 13 minutes now. And I‚Äôm only rank 8. 
---
Are we console DBDers masochists as well? It‚Äôs terrible but I can‚Äôt bring myself to quit for good.
---
I really wish there were ‚Äúsurge rewards‚Äù or something. I mean, when Uber drivers are scarce in an area, they pay them more to fix it. Now if 80% of queued players were survivor and 20% were killers all the time, we‚Äôd be fine. But it‚Äôd be nice if, say, only 50% were playing survivor and causing increased wait times, they could offer a 1.5x bloodpoint bonus to anyone willing to play survivor until it leveled back out. Same thing when new killers release and everyone wants to play them, etc, etc. Incentivize your playerbase, BHVR. 
---
This is me. I want it but im not trying to have all mmy dlc kocked and have to purchase it twice. Borderlands does cloud saves between the same consoles family we should just do that to any system with dbd. 
---
I play on ps4. I know how the killers on it play. Specifically those types of killers. They face camp and tunnel until you're down and they've all been using unrelenting with stbfl recently because stupid noobs seem to think the machine gun build is still a real thing and they don't respect pallets. They hit you through them even when you get the stun. A missed hit doesn't mean much, a pallet within a second lunge distance doesn't mean anything. 
---
Honestly, I wanna see this epic escape you made while your teammate was doing nothing with 1 gen left and no key while he was waiting for you to die so he could have hatch. I mean, look how close to you and the hatch he was when you were looking around. He had 0 intentions of doing anything except wait for you to die.
---
Prayer beads spirit and insta huntress lol.
---
The entity's cult is Sam's club
---
Idk. Both of these people seemed like assholes. 
---
"Freddy's reach OP, plz nurf!" comments incoming.
---
You should clearly be working at BHVR as their new design leader. Your ideas are amazing and i bet within 1 month this game would be dead if you were working on the game!
---
My friend has been DCing from like 70% of the games we've played together. I've only had this issue once, though. He's on west coast, I'm on east coast.
---
I thought it was. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Dodge this game
---
Devs dont care and will just sell you fixes to problems as perks
---
Revert the pallet amount? To what?
---
Changing two perks into one means you have to come up with more perks. 
---
You‚Äôd be fucking queue times up by removing SWF of 4. 
---
The buff you want LF to have is probably too ridiculous and unrealistic. 
---
As someone very critical of the design team, you‚Äôre not much better yourself. Stop crying. The game is at its most balanced point in the years it‚Äôs been out. 
---
Maybe you wont. 
---
Toxic. 
---
I've never had much problems with bugs on console but it seems to me they're starting to get really bad. Had a meg float to the ceiling when she started working on a gen with me in a game earlier and dead hard keeps literally sticking me into walls if I dead hard into one by accident.
---
The first one sounds like Legion haha *and myself* 
---
*gasp* dbd x cuphead confirmed?!!!! 
---
Played huntress the other day to do a daily and even with bloodhound I could hardly even see fresh scratches/blood. It was not a fun match.
---
Stuff like that yes. I mostly just meant perks. Maybe make the other killers items blue and yours red. Add more totem spawns aswell. 
---
Might even be worth having 2-3 mins in lobby to figure out builds and have a way to see the other persons build.
---
For more balance, make some perks limited. Like only 1 killer can use noed or only 3-4 survivors can use adrenaline or whatever. You get what im saying lol. Itd be a really fun mode.
---
Her grunts from getting hit are pretty funny too lol
---
It's in the itemaddons folder in steam files, who knows if it's unused though.
---
God I wish there was a season 4 :'(
---
Downing someone with a chainsaw on your first sprint of the match is one of the most satisfying feelings in the game
---
People doing dailies? People trying out Nurse? I haven't played many matches as her and while I can control blinks somewhat well, I can't for the life of me blink through objects. The timing is awful and certain props you can't even go through.
---
Yeah definitely, The devs might fuck it up though but I‚Äôd still play it.
---
"Or the Trapper and Hag."
---
**Small Game notification never shuts up**
---
Some of them would make good killers ü§î
---
In general, Killer needs more practice to get into, since you have to have good game sense and stay aggressive and on people, but is definitely easier at Rank 10-20.
---
 Survivor usually gets easier around Rank 10-1, since your team can power through the gens (and sometimes even ignore Hex: Ruin) and manage healing and unhooks well, giving the killer less time to build momentum and get all 3 hooks on everyone.
---
It is definitely unused as of now. There are a few other dummy perk icons in the folders there from basically the release of the game. 
---
Time will tell
---
What's with the level 58?
---
The Neet
---
‚ÄúLoneliness is his friend‚Äù

Great for late game

GG and enjoy! Keep practising and you'll see improvements. There's a lot of streams and YT videos to help you but for the time I would say to just enjoy the feeling for that after some time its gonna fade. Lol didn't mean to sound depressing. Anyway, gg
