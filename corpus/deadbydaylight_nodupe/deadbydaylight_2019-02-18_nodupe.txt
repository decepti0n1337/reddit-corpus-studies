I haven't intentionally but one time I spawned in with a Kate and the killer (Pig) in the barn. We all run out and I crouch behind some hay bales with a palette. I can see Amanda's head ever so slightly over the bale and get ready to slam the palette as I can see her red stain (she's searching from my POV, so I assume she's looking for me)... only... it wasn't Amanda, it was a Kate and ol Piggy was RIGHT BEHIND HER. 
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I obviously didn't see the Kate turn around the hay but I slammed the palette trapping the Kate behind the palette and between the Pig. Kate got knocked, and the three of us kinda just... looked at each other for what seemed a really long time.  The Kate DC'd as I was trying to unhook them and Amanda was near by, which eventually lead to me being hooked so I guess I got what I deserved 
---
Honestly still queue dodge that Kate if I see them in the lobby, out of sheer embarrassment &gt;.&gt;
---
It's BBQ and Ruin in almost every game, with chase oriented killers it will be enduring and spirit fury, maybe bamboozle. 
---
Spirit main here is offended
---
Smells like sorcery. Also can they make firecrackers items you can find normally and give them some addons.
---
I think people are talking about the fact that it's just stressful the whole time and not fun to be destroyed by a good swf 
---
LOVELY!!
---
More upvotes than any of your posts
---
I love the idea of the killers coming back home after a match and just talking to eachother lol
---
And as always phenomenal art! Look forward to the entity’s speech or whatever it’ll be 
---
A camping post but yet insidious is exactly a camping perk.  Hmmmm
---
Lead the killer to a Nea that was camping the hatch while i was trying to find a gen to work on.
---
And clown, cannibal, hillbilly, pig
---
Aww, I would've not ran if I had known. You shanked me tho.
---
Going with this theory the survivor could be a queen/princess or king/prince
---
Dude, same. I still manage to enjoy it, but yeah, I can get looped like a dog. I just don't bother anymore. It's a waste of time. I'll find someone else and hit them.
---
teabagging and slashing people on the hooks is honestly just a dick thing to do so when they go down people view it as karma 
---
By sucking as badly as I do.
---
Have you tried playing a more simple game that doesn't require you to adapt your playstyle?  Maybe something like creative mode minecraft where you can just do what you want with no consequence?
---
Thank you! Probably even the killers need a rest after a match. Specially after met EVIL and TOXIC survivors. 
---
Keep in mind they could mean oldest killer in terms of when they got into the realm and with time being, as they have said themselves, convoluted it could seriously just be a killer from the future or something. Really digging the lore killer idea though. Also medieval looking killer would not fit too well into the game aesthetically.
---
Remember when they were actually worthwhile, Pepperidge Farm remembers. 
---
Please reply to this comment so I can give you an upvote again
---
I'm not bitching about swf. It isn't fun to have multiple gens pop during a chase, which can easily happen if the survivors focus on literally their sole objective.
---
Playing killer is moderate stress the entire time, and it's not so fun by the end of the day
---
Thicc
---
Jesus, that's terrifying. 
---
I will
---
Have you seen Quentin’s face 
---
What the fuck have you introduced me too?
---
Yes 
---
I never said anything about "winning" or "losing". The console port of this game is terribly optimized and that's a fact. There is a reason they have been talking about fixing it forever. If you don't see that you're either delusional or you got extremely lucky. 
---
Once carried a survivor to the exit because their other three teammates were all asshats. Killed the dude pointing to their location first and the other two were flashlight/tea bagging me every pallet. People who play nice deserve to escape when their teammates are shit
---
Long long man.
---
I didn't realize Jeff's career in the metal industry, as I thought he just did album art and stuff. :p I don't know if that puts him above Meg but all things being considered he's probably better at actually fighting than old Bill.
---
As for fighting with the Killers I edited my original post to mention the various tiers of strength I view the Killers at. Amanda and Legion are basically regular dudes with knives so any semi-experienced fighter would likely be able to hold them off and at least disarm them. For Pig it would be hard to disarm her since the blade is attached to her outfit, but Legion are a bunch of shithead teenagers with hunting knives and it would be super easy to twist one of their arms and wrestle the knife out of their hands.
---
Most of the supernaturally enhanced Killers with the exception of Hag and Hillbilly are not *physically* enhanced so for the sake of a fight they're be similar to Legion and Pig. A lot of the Killers in the "supernatural" tier do also have more weapon experience which would help but ignoring element of surprise on either end they'd be about the same as the regular Killers.
---
As for the Killers with larger builds (Doctor, Wraith, and Clown) it would no doubt be hard to fight them off but it would be possible for the more physically capable fighters. I think they're all honestly wild cards since it's really hard to determine both Wraith and Doctor's physical strength (Doctor swings a giant dildo around and does the same damage as an axe to the back of the skull so...) and while Clown is a very wide boii who'd have a lot of weight to physically overpower a foe he also has a drinking problem and I believe his lore mentions a drug problem as well. He coughs like he's dying of lung cancer so he's probably not very physically fit, especially with his stomach flab.
---
But the top 4 Killers are hulking monstrosities of human beings with insane strength. Trapper (we can honestly just compare him to Jason), Huntress, Leatherface, and Michael Myers are all in peak physical condition (if we assume that Mikey is 1978 Mikey and is 21 years old, as opposed to 2018 remake Mikey who's like 80 lol) with incredibly powerful weapons (I made another post determining how deadly every Killer's weapon would be and Huntress and Trapper were among the top ranks, with Leatherface and Michael having very deadly weapons as well) that would all easily be able to fight off an average-sized human long enough for them to stick a sharp thing in a vital bit.
---
Of course none of the Killers (except Michael who's immortal for reasons) would be able to survive a gunshot but in hand-to-hand combat Huntress would uppercut the shit out of David King before performing a Fatalimori on his ass.
---
I don't condone the use of lag switching or anything but at the same time I can understand the killer getting ticked off at you just not leaving.
---
P E B B L E T I M E
---
This post is awesome, and while I would dispute some of it, the entertainment and thought put into this post definitely make it worth more than a measly 6 karma. I respect you and your efforts here, thank you for the fun read and thought provocation 
---
That’s absolutely nonsense. I can say so with certainty because I’ve done so myself. It’s easier with some killers than others, but definitely doable with any. 
---
It sounds like your problem is that you let survivors control the game. If you get looped by someone the whole game you are playing bad. Not because you couldn’t catch them, but because you wasted time chasing them. Try this; pick the 3 gens closest together at the start of the match and make them your top priority. If you are in a chase and it isn’t ending quickly just let them go. Patrol all the gens, but really only worry about the 3 you chose from the start. Never waste time camping a hooked survivor (unless the doors are opened) and keep survivors busy as possible. 
---
"How does this dude who keeps hopping in lockers keep finding us?"
---
"I don't know, but he at least helps us finish gens faster."
---
Idk, but seems to me if the person getting facecamped would “take one for the team” I guess you’d say then the killer is really just opening up plenty of time for the other survivors to get stuff done. So it’s their downfall, really. 
---
How is that a bad thing though? Wglf should be like it 
---
The only situation I can reasonably consider it being okay is when the gates are open and the Killer knows the rest of the survivors are just ready to go for the save. There's no reason to initiate another chase with a healthy survivor if it guarantees losing the kill and securing their escape.
---
Heck no, I never dc. Gimme bloodpoints lol- also I play 50-50 survivor and killer, so I know how to act on both sides
---
I play both survivor and killer, but mostly survivor. However, as far as just face camping for no reason then yes, it's never ok, but if you hook someone and turn around and there is someone right there next to you, and they are waiting for you to leave snd you chase them but they dont lead you away then you hve no choice. Also, if the whole squad rushes instantly trying to get the hook the  you should definitely stay. And get your hits and downs in. The survivors should try and lead the killer away from the hook and the killer should leave in that case. 
---
It makes sense at the end of the game, when all the Gens are done.
---
To me it depends. If it’s well deserved, like if someone was an asshole survivor the entire match I don’t think there’s anything wrong with facecamping 
---
Hm, not gonna lie, that's a good point. They should leave BBQ as is, and buff WGLF so it has an extra effect besides just the blood point increase.
---
God forbid someone else doesn’t have fun so the other side can win
---
Yesterday I got hard tunneled for five games in a row. 
---
Since playing this game, I have NEVER KNOWN PEACE
---
Depends on the router, mine can support 4 Hardwired connections. I can't imagine how many devices you would personally need hardwired that you could always just swap the cord connection from console to PC if that is the issue.
---
Please explain what's would make a person an "asshole survivor."
---
This happened to me but with a hag, I finished the last gen and watched her place traps around the exit gates. I knew she had would have NOED so I crouched around the map without urban, she also had mint rag which made my heart race while crouching around the map, haha. I did manage to escape, but man it was intense 
---
Yeah it’s pretty ridiculous to do it the whole time because they lose out on a lot.
---
I wouldn’t buy him, but Jeff tho! Jeff has really good perks
---
You bring up a fair point
---
No it’s not? If you have to resort to face camping you’re trash plain and simple 
---
He would only get one shot that has a reload cooldown. Maybe the hags movement speed
---
No it doesn’t 
---
I don't think so. I think the "peripherals" that it mentions just refers to the fact that the pro controller is supported and the gamecube controller won't be.
---
Well, I would much rather be playing a Wraith with silent bell and fast action speed, A Bloody Coil/Trapper bag Trapper or a tricked out Doctor rather than a dress Freddy.
---
lmao something here seriously struck a nerve with you to be this personally offended
---
It can’t ever be reasonable, due to the fact that it’s a survivors GOAL to get the others off the hook 
---
It's RNG. They mentioned it on the Dev stream way back.
---
No you should never camp the survivor on hook, people that run this logic are the reason why people disconnect, you could spend 25 minutes trying to find a match when a troll face camps you the moment it starts and you’re only in game for 3 minutes but that’s ok?
---
Bro refer me to ur friend my birthday is April 16
---
I feel that it should be a school map and not like badham preschool. I think this fully inside map would be a nice change because most of our maps are outside.
---
Thank you
---
*Kill 1 survivor by your hand with [killer you despise playing and only have at level 1]*
---
fucking [STOP.](/intensifies) 
---
Yes
---
That’s the same reason I’d rather use SB. It works better than DH and I dont have to worry about it not working 
---
Thanks man, it means a lot. I like to watch the streamers, but I just can't figure it out... yet. I won't give up. Thanks!
---
OP: wah killers wah wah wah
---
You: killers who bitch about SWF are children
---
If you can't see the irony then there's no helping you
---
Yeah, 5 minutes. This a quick game. A gen a minute, and if they are actually good survivors then you can be looped for about 40 seconds - 1 minute. Plus 3 survivors will most likely be on gens if one is looping for that long. Games can go by really quickly.
---
I'm just saying that killer is just moderately stressful the entire time due to games going by fast and a lot of other factors. It's not even a matter of getting good, it's just that the more times you play killer in a row
---
That still just makes him a better huntress... The differences are too small.
---
Btw huntress and hag shares the same movement speed
---
I don't want to pip without getting good though, you know?
---
Lmao true 
---
Well no, devs said that all the survivors should be people you could see in like a cafe. The biggest jump would be Kate, a celebrity. I wouldn’t see a princess in a tavern. Maybe a peasant, Knight, or bailiff or some other political person. I still don’t think it would be medieval though, you got 1500 knights or 1000 mail armor. It just doesn’t fit.
---
The irony is that fact you had to point it out, people like you are literally the reason why this community is toxic 
---
Yeah... I want to blame the console and frames, but it's mostly me. My best was 9 or 10.
---
Maybe have him....or rather it, switch forms every other panel? Maybe have him change to a monstrous from when he gets angry and stuff like that.
---
When was I personally offended? I want an answer but nobody can give me one but you’re salty troll ass feels the need to put your unnecessary input in
---
Sounds like an excuse to tbag him. Also you could if figured it out without being toxic. Glad you got hooked.
---
It's one of the few ways to win with shit killers at high ranks. I really wish they would do something about the match time so I don't have to run it every game.
---
Same with BBQ, just make the bloodpoint gain baseline so I can dumpster that perk, goddamn.
---
That's what I do, but it's a waste of time to chase. It's better to down people instantly, then patrol gens. 
---
They're trying to criticize SWF for having optimal game knowledge outside what's actually in the game. Comms allow the players in it to know when and where they should be doing something.
---
Which gens are safe to do and almost done, where the killer is being distracted, etc.
---
The game is built to have perks that serve this function but comms allow the players to subvert that
---
You don’t have to. Just level him up enough to get his teachable perks. 
---
A college campus would be cool from scream 2. Just keep all the buildings around a courtyard. Minimal outside time.
---
At end game it is smart. But in your case the clown was just a bad killer
---
The 360 before hooking Adam was very good
---
I’m not disagreeing with you about it being stressful but you saying that games go to fast isn’t right, how long do you want one match to go? 
---
Myers. Different play to most other killers and most variety of add-ons.
---
Plus yanking someone off a gen early in the match is one of the best feelings ever.
---
How long do you want the matches to go? 5-15 minutes is a decent match what do you want 30 minutes to an hour?
---
I mean that was *kind of* your fault for not cleansing totems, but then again doing gems is pretty much the only other option.  There really wasn't much to could do there.  That's too bad
---
Face camping sucks for sure and tunneling of course but they are all tactics that killers use sometimes in games.  Is it right? No.  But you punish them by gen rushing and ending the game fast.  They de pip and you pip and probably out gain them on bps.  A killer is not going to advance very far with that play style.  Only time I see camping ok is if I was constantly tea bagged and flash-lighted over and over by a swf.  At that point the game is over anyways because a swf team is more toxic than a killer could ever be and it’s either camp or dc.  I main survivor btw do not biased towards killers.
---
And how's that working out for you?
---
Then ban comma from happening? But do that and you will either lose your player base or they will go and use discord to chat.
---
As if the glorious sky spider would waste his time with a human form.
---
Great artwork tho!
---
Flashlights would be useless then. You would have to completely change rarities among other things to include firecrackers.
---
&gt; The irony is that fact you had to point it out
---
what are you even trying to say? lmfao the irony is that I pointed out the irony? wut
---
I'm just saying that it's not very long. It's why Ruin is necessary against experience survivors
---
And no 5 minutes is not a decent match length are you fucking serious lmfao
---
I feel you.  Getting good will come with time.  Outside of becoming a master looper there are tricks you can use that do not involve perks.  I don’t consider myself great but getting to the red ranks usually isn’t too difficult but I prefer the matches in higher ranks because less toxicity and sweaties.
---
Yeah it does.
---
&gt; When was I personally offended?
---
The way you responded to literally every comment in here bigmad
---
&gt; but nobody can give me one
---
haha just because your entitled ass doesn't like it doesn't mean you didn't get an answer
---
Thanks for the laugh. Great meme :) 
---
Honestly, Leatherface is super underrated.  Once you fully understand how his chainsaw power works, you can 4k with him regularly with the right add-ons.  The hardest thing about his about his power is learning how to make super tight turns without crashing, and knowing when you're close enough to use it.
---
My personal favorite add-ons are The Beast's Mark, and any other add-on that decreases charge time moderately (preferably Carburetor tuning guide).  Not only does this allow you to use your power from further away, but you can catch Survivors trying to loop you off guard.  Survivors tend to underestimate Leatherface, and his ability to catch up to them with his power.  So much so that they will forego dropping the pallet to continue looping.  With the Beast's Mark, your top speed will increase so much that they won't be able to finish the loop before you catch them, that is, if you can make tight enough turns.
---
Strongest survivor is easily David followed by Bill.
---
David is an asshole who starts fights in his backstory, and is obviously a jock. Bill would win if he was younger, i mean the old bastard (nearly) survived a zombie apocalypse and only went down to save his buddies.
---
Tapp is probably in third.  
---
Right, you're like starting to understand the issue here. They can't ban comms, for numerous reasons, and yet the game isn't balanced around them at all. That's an issue
---
Thx it took years to perfect 👌 
---
Did...did you even read my comment? 
---
The more points i get now the more fun I can have later. Consider it a "fun investment".
---
Is that mads mikillsen?
---
idk anything about this, could you elaborate please?
---
Give me more salt, I main Legion
---
How long of a match do you want dumbass? Ruin isn’t necessary if you’re good at this game 
---
imagine legion w/ offspring... ugh...
---
Devotion is a poorly thought out idea, really misses the mark creatively.

It's a Killer's GOAL to kill any Survivors they can before they escape. Why would they abandon the only objective they have once the generators are complete?
---
How so? Because you were trash the whole game and couldn’t get a kill so that’s a good reason to ruin someone’s game who beat your ass the whole match? 
---
The Entity...[**Is hot!**](/intensifies)
---
When have I said I’m entitled? You must be offended to have to comment on everything I say you salty scumbag 😂😂
---
Bruh I still have to play him. And the way your meant to play him doesn't even work. It worked in 2016, but now he can't sabo efficiently with his 0erk, killers can easily find you with perks, and  then he's a male character, making him larger and easier to find. Its torture.
---
If they want their fellow survivor to die so much i oblige them. Makes things easier in the long run.
---
Stop making up rules. Everyone plays how they want to jfc
---
Because I'm not gonna be dumb enough to walk away from a person I hooked when all gens are done. Especially after time has passed after the gens were done. What do you think this is cater to survivors r us?
---
I didn’t but it’s not a fair point, because you got beat the whole match it’s ok for you to literally run NOED and down someone at the end and camp them? Really? How is that perfectly ok?
---
If all you've played or seen the game played on is the xbox you wouldn't notice it as much. I've dropped a few hundred hours across the 3 platforms and the xbox version is by far the worst (the ps4 version is not much better though). The optimization shows everywhere though, in dropping pallets, vaulting windows, skill checks, and even walking. The game needs fixing on every platform and has needed it for awhile. 
---
This is amazing 
---
Fair point but why do survivors lose points towards their goals but killers can face camp and get bonuses for it?
---
Bruh does Michael just stand around and look creepily at the other killers? Waiting for the next match th ate be fuckin hilarious, everytime you see him he doesn't say shit or do shit, just waits for the next hunt. This comic is really well done, I'd buy it, but I know you legally can't sell copyrighted characters
---
Who made up rules? 
---
How's about no and deal with it.
---
I'm about to get wooooooshed, aren't I?
---
Absolutely. You will be called a tunneler when they are just shit at hiding and get found again, and a camper because they decided to lead you back to the hook. Its why I completely ignore complaints and just kill people.
---
butthurt baby hahahaha
---
Oh I don't know, maybe you for saying that we should leave hooked person when gates are opened? 
---
Always happens when you bring a bloodponit offering 😂
---
Apparently you think it’s cater to killers, there is no fair way for a survivor to save the other off the hook when you camp it gaining points and causing the survivors points and a chance at an iridescent, you don’t lose points for camping you gain them, survivors lose them even when it’s fully out of their control 
---
You don’t need ruin. If you play smart you can make the game last very long. 
---
That’s not a rule you fucking dumbass that’s my opinion. You camp that killer and close every other survivor and iridescent because Of that they lose points where as you gain them from Standing still
---
Dont you like em iddy biddy tiddys.
---
Leatherface and Trapper.
---
Leatherface demands respect, you can't bully him without getting a chainsaw enema, and it's a joy dicking on survivors who think he is bad.
---
Trapper because I have mastered the art of "trap in the middle of nowhere".
---
Camping and tunneling is rampant on console versions of the game. It really sucks. To the point that i own the game on PC and am about to drop 2000 on a PC that will run it.
---
Again, stop chasing someone if they are obviously just trying to burn time. If you play with the focus on just catching survivors faster than they can do gens then no wonder you are stressed. Try being more strategic with the gens you guard and it really won’t be stressful.
---
Coming from you? Hahah nice try troll 😂😂
---
You don't gain points you fucking idiot. You lose them for camping. :/
---
I mean doctor is pretty *S W O L E*, coming from a doctor main.  And if you did take cosmetics into account for the killers as well, the killers with hallowed blight outfits (maybe except for wraith since, well he's a tree) would be much stronger due to the blight serum stuff
---
I'm a simple man. I see a Dweard with pink pants and I preemptively bring a Mori. 
---
No you don’t? Are you stupid? You get points when the entity is summoned and the survivor is sacrificed, the only way you would lose points is because you didn’t try to go get other kills that’s all on you not the games fault
---
Play with other survivors and use the BP you gain on him?
---
You're losing points for being close to the fucking hooked person that's literally a thing in the Chaser emblem "proximity to the hooked survivor". I'm not going to continue talking to you, you're obviously an entitled survivor main. 
---
Same
---
Nah. Everything you do is shitty to a toxic survivor. Decent ones understand you sometimes gotta do what you gotta do.
---
Wow that’s funny 
---
This statement I agree with
---
Important things to remember about Detective David Tapp: he's not far off from Overbeck.
---
He's an older man. Not graying, but definitely not exactly in peak physical performance. He loses a fight against a random hospital orderly, and one of his biggest failures is getting slashed in the throat by a cancerous old guy in glorified bath robes.
---
Speaking of that second "fight," *he has a giant slash on his throat.* Given his raspy voice and how he clearly gasps for breath during his admittedly very small fight with Zep, he's definitely got some issues with his breathing. He's older and he's injured.
---
I'd put maybe Jeff above him. Not Overbeck though (he may be old but he's not that old.)
---
D A R N
---
I play both actually so get your facts straight dumbass, you don’t lose anything, you’re just a self entitled killer main. Who can’t accept a loss in game or on reddit. You think you need to win at everything in life, sorry buddy not everything comes with a participation award 🤙🤙
---
I guess that could work.
---
Tunneling is a stupid meme. Chasing the person who will take one less hit to down is just called "being good at math".
---
And a lot of times when i get called a "tunneler", its just because the survivor was shit and got their ass caught again.
---
Also you are damn right playing killer isn't fun. You try it at rank 1 sometime.
---
maybe, but i'm not really liking the idea of two masked killers with knives in a row.
---
it used to be because she was weak
---
but now its because he is too strong in chases 
---
see using her power he can hit you and put you in deep wound status. fall back for a second and then just follow your scratch marks when looking down so as not to retrigger the chase but still be on your tail
---
so you cant stop to mend and you cant avoid getting downed by deep wound meaning he is a killer that is really good at tunneling which makes her annoying to play against 
---
kind of like how leatherface is great at camping people, legion is great at tunneling
---
 I actually got a killer grasp rescue in the winter event feelsgoodman
---
It's funny when people DC against me when I am not using Prayer Beads but they think I am. When someone is on a gen, I barely get them inside my terror radius so they don't hear the wooshing. People who don't listen for the very faint heartbeat get yoinked off gens lol. I got 29 Beads and I can replicate their effect. While very strong, I prefer move and charge addons.
---
Better yet, play killer with BBQ and just throw your BP at Jake.
---
Thanks that must be why I got so many dcs.
---
I'm not saying they go too fast I'm saying they can go by really quickly and it hurts to see so many gens popped in such a short time. Not complaining about that, only saying it can be stressful
---
I can see this having a frogman outfit for this killer. That would really fit him.
---
His own fault! 
---
I like to inflict deep wound and then hit them with a regular hit and since i have thanatophobia and sloppy butcher they are reluctant to heal but have to and it takes soooo long for them to heal
---
this happened to me with the huntress the only difference is i got aways thanks to urban evasion so she couldnt down me with her NOED 
---
so she was stuck trying to defend the hatch and both exits gates which she couldnt do reliably so i was able to escape through one of the gates
---
Maybe just put it like a skin for Legion?
---
I didn't say they should be doing anything else. I'm saying that's how it goes and that it's stressful when that happens
---
I know but I still feel bad for leaving him...
---
Could be a mummy. The survivor could be an archaeologist guy. 
---
So your saying 16 meters isn’t close? Really? So you could sit out in the open 16 meters away and not lose anything. That’s still camping especially when the killer can close that ground in literally seconds. Get some facts before you talk 
---
If you are good at being stealthy then premonition, dead-hard/sprint-burst (Sprint-burst can really help when it comes to multiple survivors running away at the same time. First outta there means you probably won’t be the one chased.) urban evasion, and self-care.  You can go with another stealth based perk instead of self-care for a pure stealth build, but I always use it. As for what item to bring definitely a med-kit if you don’t have self-care but a key or broken key with the addos that allow you to see the killer is also a huge advantage.
---
You got anyplace I can go to should this continue? 
---
As long as you make sure that last one doesn’t get done the rest don’t matter. Setting up so the last 3 gens are easy to patrol makes it so that it doesn’t matter how fast the rest get done.
---
I've played for about 85 hours and I've yet to come by a cheater. Now to not jinx myself I must ask all cheaters to please don't bully me... 
---
* When the Gates are open
---
* When you see three people slinking around the hook like alley cats
---
* When its a Dweard
---
* When its a sandbagger
---
* When I fucking feel like it
---
Personally, I always have urban evasion, premonition, decisive strike, and alert. 
---
Anything for a daily ritual I guess .
---
Very interesting design for the entity. It looks pretty dope.
---
I use to do this when I first started playing, but that was only because I got SCARED out of my mind.
---
NOED on nurse, kek
---
Like?
---
They also don't want people getting too many ultra rare add ons
---
Good answer. 
---
Also like the uses of male and female pronouns. :D &lt;3
---
Nothing, they're doing a pretty good so far. 
---
Man you're a terrible troll.
---
I play both killer and survivor, but I prefer killer because getting a 4k is so satisfying. I am, as some would say, an immersed survivor, so I don't know how to mind game or loop, but that doesn't mean I won't try. Also, I have no one to play with, so I can't practice or get help from anyone in direct contact (PS4 btw). I will not give up though, and I can't wait for summer for dedicated servers.
---
How are u even still sane ;_;
---
Survivors: Um... Whatcha Got There?
---
Killer: A Streamer...
---
I guess so
---
"with the right addons" is a crucial addendum. Imo he's one of the most addon dependent killers in the game, they adjust his capacity immensely.
---
Thanks man. Practice makes perfect. Thanks for being kind about my rant aswell.
---
I don't know :') 
---
if the exit gates are open and you down someone its ok to camp because at that point you just gotta make sure you secure your kill. 
---
and if you catch a shirtless david its ok to face camp because its so nice to look at
---
Borrowed Time, most swf groups run at least one literally for this reason.
---
This infuriates me so much as both killer and survivor. You use up all of your good items/add-ons and offerings to just load into games like this. If this game is supposedly balanced around 2k/two survivors escaping, why does games like this even start? No one should be able at the very least, derank and lose items. Devs, please fix your shit. 
---
If you are healing outside out a deep wound mend then survivors are playing against legion wrong
---
The entire point of the perks for survivor is rewards for not rushing the game and making your choice. Do you want your sprint, do you want your key. And all stealth that takes away the killers terror radius. The perks for killer are meant to be powerful as my  goal is to give power to a  killer that would suffer from people using comms in a game meant to make you feel isolated. Fear is unlimited range, Alpha is meant to punish rushing and would be a hex that would only light once the first tier is reached. Off spring also slows the game and will punish rushes. My goal would be to give power back to killers and prevent releases such as legion. This killer would bring a new meta and fun gameplay. I forgot to add in when he is transformed he can punch other survivors to injure but has to punch three times to down. I get what you're saying but the game is currently nurse and Billy meta with the occasional spirit. These perks give power to killers and force survivors to work together. Remember when they make killers they focus on fun not power and that's a key problem in their design.
---
So bamboozle is bugged to not work, and normal windows are bugged to do what bamboozle is supposed to do. Glorious.
---
I’m not trying to troll like you clearly are, you’re just ignorant to someone else’s opinions. Their is always 2 sides to a topic but in your case there can’t be more then 1. Due to your ignorance to others 
---
He could use it with how bad he is. Imo
---
Then why did you post this?
---
What if he’s on the hook? Then what? Since everyone has answers for everything 
---
Nice sarcasm killer what’s your issue now? 
---
You come off as the very embodiment of entitlement when you demand a free escape at end game when there is literally no other objective to defend at that point.  If there's an open exit gate what else do you want from killer?  Camping with gens up means they're the pussy....but crying about being camped when the game is actually over makes you the pussy.
---
Because they are both sexy daddys
---
Spends time finding someone and gets looped 1-2 times on the first guy. "I shouldn't be chasing him, better find someone else". Spends more time finding someone else, only to get looped again. Then multiple gens pop with no hooks, very few pallets used, and the Killer is now in a nearly unwinnable spot. 
---
The people that give the advice of "just find someone else" likely hardly ever play Killer if at all. It doesn't work against anyone. If the Killer doesn't make progress in kills or gets additional pressure from hooks early game, then the entire game snowballs against him when facing any Survivor team attempting to try.
---
Basic math. Killers can only chase 1 guy, leaving up to 3 others to do gens and end the game. If the Killer can't use that 1 chased Survivor to apply pressure on others ASAP, by hooking him mostly, then the Killer just isn't going to stop anyone. 
---
If that hooked survivor had a way to STOP the unhook from happening, that'd be one thing. Most of the time, you're not fucking the asshole, you're fucking the guy who was already on the hook. They lose barely anything for unsafe unhook. You can choose how you play,  we can't choose how the other survivors play.
---
Bloodeh Funneh lol
---
Camping killer can insta-grab the rescuing survivor before they even finish the unhook. 
---
I never said I wanted a free escape? Show me where I said that. What I stated was camping is trashy make the game competitive as a killer you can easily make a come back against the other survivors at the end of a match. Most killers are too salty and butt hurt at the end to attempt it so they camp that one survivor. 
---
Dude I think you just successfully personified the entity and I have to say that’s a pretty amazing thing 
---
THERE ARE NO BOUNDS FOR BILLY! N O B O U N D S!
---
DS is good too. I just always mess up the skill-check otherwise I’d use it more lol. And I actually have not used alert but it sounds awesome now that I’ve read about it.
---
I think I was the killer? Trapper on PS4?
---
It’s good for keeping tabs on the killer and knowing which direction not to go in.
---
I'm ignorant but this is coming from the person that says camping when all gens are done is bad. Get that bullshit outta here. Why dont you do a poll just to show how wrong you are on that subject then come back to me.
---
It seems to me from your statement you want a free kill at the end of the game by camping him. Make it challenging as the survivors to try to get that save make it interesting earn yourself the post match GG and respect from the other players 
---
Wanna know a funny thing to? Even tho OP agreed with camping when all gens are done is fine. So you can shut that bullshit up
---
That’s why I hope they fix his rare addons and give him an ultra rare one. The rare addons could be viable if fixed because he’d zoom zoom a lot faster. And an ultra rare addon, whatever it may be, is needed.
---
This is honestly the funniest thing I've seen on reddit
---
That
---
s unfortunate
---
Clever girl!...also very devious.
---
I think you’re overestimating how many people use noed
---
Pretty sure Wraith and Spirit would both hate being forced to slaughter endlessly, judging by their backstory. Arguably Nurse as well, though who knows what she thinks anymore
---
part
---
Why don’t you grow the fuck up and Accept others opinions, your clearly a child.  Camping is bad plain and simple, earn yourself the GG at the end of the match make the match a challenge for the survivors to save that guy put pressure on them, earn the respect of the other players don’t be a scummy player and camp because you’re mad you got out played the whole match
---
Removed for patty thread please post /r/dbdLFG/
---
Probably because if you hide from the killer when you hear heartbeat and don't run in the open everywhere, you're less likely to be hooked. Also you don't have to run around the killer if he doesn't find you. It's just playing tactically imo and not really a selfish playstyle if you are still going for saves if people get caught
---
Wanna know a funny thing to? You’re an ignorant piece of shit who can’t accept anyone else’s opinions over yours
---
Do people actually consider nodding toxic?  Whenever I see a killer do it, I just laugh because most of the time, the people I'm playing against act like emotionless drones in game...so it's funny to actually see someone acknowledge *something*. 
---
This happened to me at the exact place earlier today 
---
you can use a flashlight for like five blinds
---
"Oh-no he's hot" 
---
Honestly it is almost necessary unless you play nurse. Even then a few mistakes can cause you get to rekt by gens
---
noice ! 
---
Only thing EAC is good for is telling me I have and untrusted dll file and making me unable to play any game that uses EAC even though I've reinstalled my entire OS to try and fix this BS
---
You can't be wrong about an opinion. So, yes, you're ignorant.
---
Yeah that specific window on that map is bugged. Went into kyf and tried multiple times. Sometimes it let me through but still gave the animation as if I didn’t jump through. 
---
Agreed 
---
In my experience good sportsmanship has usually been met with the same, but definitely had a few times where people thought exactly that. Aside from times where a game was so exciting/neck and neck or someone pulls a save or something genuinely worth some praise I’ve had a few times where I thanked someone for simply being being a good sport for not quitting when the rest of their team has. Rare, but always a bit nice when things like that happen instead of the usual barrage of salt
---
Wow take the L that’s all you’ve got gg bro take the L
---
Just how bigoted are you? I agree with the fact that you are blatantly disrespecting someone's opinion by calling their stance on a specific topic wrong. 
---
I would Source Film Maker and BTW I think it's the same person making these great posts
---
You should have left 
---
True
---
DS is for weak players who need a second chance after losing a chase
---
I personally don't think anything is toxic in this game. I equate it more to BMing or gloating which is something both killers and survivors do.
---
Damn you get downvoted for the joke. I hate the dbd community they are suck cry babies
---
The typical DS user when they miss their skill check*

Except they'd be slamming their hands on both buttons at the same time

The Entity is super scary for one reason, everything that is not animate in his realm, or at least not a humanoid or animal, such as rocks, pallets, trees...
---
Those ARE the entity.
---
Oh neat. Good day.
---
Oh neat. Good day
---
I totally agree.  I feel like if they simply increased his top speed when using the chainsaw, his viability without add-ons would increase dramatically.
---
Jesus fuck, I didn't think it'd be THAT bad
---
There's a fucking EAR on that purse, goddamn
---
I’m a killer main,would you still recommend him?
---
Don't feel bad, his fault for not leaving 
---
Bigoted enough to know when camping is bad and when it isnt.
---
Next question.
---
If you’re a killer guy than yes. Because he does have some decent perks. Although I don’t prefer to play him 
---
I wish they would do something like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, where there are "Clone" characters (i.e. Daisy and Dark Samus). Maybe instead of a new killer, they just make "The Actor" (Ghostface) a reskin cosmetic of Legion.
---
I was more freaked when I say the chairs with faces on them. Who would want to sit on that?
---
Keep answering 😂😂
---
Your username has me deceased 💀
---
Which is an opinion. What if I say you're wrong? 
---
That’s why I torture survivors 
---
If head nodding is toxic then I'm a nuclear waste dump. I love to nod and spin my head pretty much every game it's so much fun
---
Oh I just checked their profile it is just one person! Thanks
---
Its licensed though so i feel like they would make a character outta it
---
Pallet Looping and Tunneling
---
Because I say I do something when I want to doesn't mean I'm salty.
---
I’m surprised the hag is still your wife after the shitty attitude you have, it’s probably because you doesn’t even speak a language and just makes noises, probably has no clue what your saying. Definitely the only person who can stand you.
---
Face camping is almost always just a bad strategy. The only times it makes sense to do are when the survivors all take the bait instead of using that time to finish all the gens. 
---
How does it not? So if I just start a match and say oh you’re the trapper my squad doesn’t wanna play you and we all disconnect that doesn’t make us salty then right?
---
That's fine, I don't like playing against SWF anyways.
---
And you have to get caught to get camped. If you don't want to "lose your match" then acquire skill.
---
I swear they deserved it your Honour!!
---
And every p3 nurse was once a level 10 who thought people with 4 perks leveled up were gods
---
Nothing personnel, kid.
---
I wouldn't say best since it's complete RNG. 
---
Wow now comms is cheating? And you do know the killer is 15% faster than any survivor right? And way to attack me directly you definitely are a salty killer. It’s not your fault your bad and can’t beat an SWF it’s all good I mean acquire skill right? 
---
jesus fucking Christ this comment section

The Shape

Beautiful.

No I only play on pc
---
Bill is ranked where he is because to my understanding his badassness and military training basically cancel out his old age, which is why (in the Left 4 Dead games) he can operate as well as his other younger allies. Resonably he'd be able to fight someone off but would still be feeling the effects of old age on his body.
---
If I was using *real* real life logic then Bill would probably be below Quentin, but if Dead by Daylight was *really* realistic then Bill would have a heart attack after sprinting 10 feet.
---
But Bill Overbeck is awesome and would definetly go down fighting if given the chance.
---
I wouldn’t think Bill to have a heart attack after sprinting 10 feet, but I think the constant running would hit him hard
---
Hypocrisy at its finest too.
---
&gt;©
---
beast marks makes him stupidly fun to play
---
Then you're automatically wrong.
---
Next question. 
---
Ever stared at a fly? They technically don't have *a* eye per socket..
---
I dont know why I'm talking about you. Or why I'm still talking to you. Wrong opinions go in the corner.
---
Doing gens
---
Nope, means you're an idiot to think camping when all gens are done is bad. That's what I'm getting out of all of this.
---
personal\*
---
Addons are meant to be used. Its either you use them now, later, or never so what would it hurt to use them now 
---
Or that. But I like bloodpoints.
---
To be fair, they said both Survivor and Killers  
---
legion is slow and easily looped when not using frenzy so him chasing them isnt a major threat. but with frenzy he is guaranteed a hit but if he tries to chase afterwards normally she is gonna struggle. 
---
so healing against legion is the wrong thing to do since he can injure people to quickly so healing is a waste of time and she cant handle the end game well at all so the best counter to legion is to get the gens done as quickly as possible 
---
It would OP and abused. They nerfed from %200 for a reason. You already walk out of a match with 40k if you play well. 
---
yeah i always find it weird when people just refer to legion as he since there are 4 of them and 2 are girls. i did think maybe id balance things out for awhile and always refer to legion as she since i only ever use the susie skin
---
but i figured naw ill just swap out he and her each time
---
You're hilarious. I'm the idiot because I may (or may not) have a different opinion? Go back to preschool, buddy. 
---
Now you’re trying to discriminate me and telling me I belong in a corner. You’re definitely a bigot. I can’t believe people like you actually exist and think you mean something to society

Leatherface for bbq and spirit for rancor and spirit fury 
---
It sure is in dbd.
---
Because in dbd the game is not balanced around communication, or it would be in the game proper. Comms gives you a free Kindred, Bond, Empathy, lets you track the killer whenever he is in a chase, lets you call out the locations of traps, totems, gens, etc., lets you co-ordinate your build (Taking the RNG out of d-strike), lets you co-ordinate a save/bodyblock and lets you keep items if you die.
---
If you do not think it gives you a huge advantage to play with comms you are blind or lying to yourself.
---
If you overly protect 3 gens, or 4 if lucky enough. Then you neglect to hunt/kill people while giving pure freedom to work the rest of the entire map. And once the Survivors finish or 99% the remaining gens, you STILL have to try and kill up to 4 people and anyone not being chased is going to be working on your gens for free. Without having done much to clear their resources of pallets, perks, or items. And even if you manage to down someone within your small area (not likely without oneshots thanks to multiple Survivor speed perks and them getting a speed boost on hit). If you try and kill them in that area, you wont have any hooks to use. Forcing you to leave that area one way or another. Either by needing to chase someone over the map to down/hook/kill them or running out of hooks. Either way NO Killer can just setup camp without it costing them. The game itself is built to prevent this.
---
The less gens you have to protect, the more important it is you remove Survivors ASAP. The 3 gen strat only works for a few Killers. Those with a oneshot for the most part or maybe Doctor. Even with those you have to run Hangman's Trick or be using a Mori in order to keep in that small area without using up hooks. And if you haven't been removing Survivors, you are fighting a losing battle as you can't protect your gens and chase someone at the same time.
---
I can't tell you how much you have to depend on map RNG to even try a 3 gen strat and how much control you as Killer do NOT have. It can seem like you have control, but that only happens when Survivors make enough mistakes to allow you to have what control they give you.
---
This the #1 problem for Killers. They can only do 1 thing and/or be in 1 part of the map at any time. Anything they are not focusing on or anywhere they are not is free game for Survivors. I don't know what it is like on console (assuming you are on Xbox from your name), but on PC Killers can't waste a second or make any mistakes without it biting them in the ass.
---
Iv been playing DbD off/on since it launched, 3 years ago. And have been watching its gameplay across multiple sources nearly every single day as well. I am also a pure Killer main, one who suffered EVERYTHING this game as given us and cut my teeth on it all.
---
It might work for you, but it just isn't good enough to work more often than not. 
---
WATCH OUT, RKO OUTTA NOWHERE!
---
Survivors do also come with different perks but are otherwise just re-skins. As for what killers to get that depends on who sounds fun to you. Leatherface himself may not be great but he does have some nice perks (BBQ and chili, Franklin’s demise.)
---
Bringing items as a survivor apparently is, as evidenced by the fact that 9/10 killers dodge when I bring something.
---
The entity looks absolutely awesome. I feel like the Entity would take a form we can relate too, as it’s real form is probably really freaky even for the killers to handle. I love this comic. Please keep them coming if you can, really good stuff.
---
Rofl Lvl 35 and you got BBQ unlocked right away.
---
You forget to mention how easy and efficient they are. I can get any variant of the firecracker for 3k. They require minimal skill and can be used regardless of the killer’s position. Flashlights could be used more often in a match but firecrackers would be better in every way. 
---
You mean once you get someone in the basement and realize how altruistic people are above rank 10..... its a guaranteed 4k
---
Lol wut
---
Which, in my opinion, is exactly why they’re single-use. I still think they won’t outdo flashlights even if they’re made to be normal items
---
Its not your fault. But if i see a SWF I assume they are cheaters and I play accordingly because i have no way of telling otherwise. It's like if you know someone has cheats but he says "don't bully me I'm not using them".
---
You're right. So dreamy.
---
Seems like PC players dc far more than console players.  I rarely see DC on console when up against legion
---
If would be good if you wouldn't lose the auras after getting hooked. Right now there are just way better options with bond and empathy imo.
---
This Is Beyond Science
---
.
---
I love how nobody can actually hold a nice debate they instantly have to go to directly insulting someone
---
They really don't seem that frequent.
---
I've played 300 ish and I've encountered only 2 I knew without a single doubt were cheaters.
---
One had all perks activated, including 5 hexes. Another was obviously speed hacking/lag switching
---
dc when downed
---
dc when hooked
---
dc when they miss decisive strike
---
etc. etc. etc.
---
Because we are SWF doesn’t make us cheaters, literally it makes no difference. If you’re good at your job as a killer it makes no difference. It’d be like me saying I see someone play as the legion/mike/spirit that makes them all cheaters 
---
Wait what in the hell am I looking at
---
Hag for Ruin! 
---
If they were a normal item they would have addons, which means longer stun times and probably more charges. Firecrackers are better than flashlights. Saving the same person more than once shouldn’t be done. Why save someone who is going to die no matter what? You should only be saved once anyway. Firecrackers have no counter. With flashlights you can look at a wall or look up. Firecrackers can also be used effectively after the initial pick up animation too. The upside to flashlights would be that I could use them more often (theoretically) and I can brag to my friends that I can blind without firecrackers.

Now, I'm not condoning lag switching or justifying it under these circumstances, but the hypocrisy and double standards need to stop. Yes, it's an absolute scummy thing to lag switch as your method of killing someone; however, I feel no sympathy for OP getting punished for not leaving. Still hope the prick gets banned for lag switching; any player, survivor or killer, should get banned for doing shady shit like that.
---
So quick question. Is the doctor killing the survivor by hand rather than the hook in some sort of rebellion act to piss off the entity? This is also a way he somewhat saves the survivors from the entity maybe? 
---
Because "even death isn't an escape" means that if you die on hook the entity keeps you.
---
I don’t know what you’re going on and on about, but I just commented to disagree with your point about firecrackers making flashlights useless
---
BRING IT BACK DEVS!
---
Well I just commented to you back up my point. Isn’t that a conversation? 
---
if you use Discord with SWF, yes, you are a cheater using a third party application. Voice chat is not how this game was balanced. There is no way to argue around this.

I played on Xbox, Playstation and PC and i would N E V E R try to play killer on console again, it's impossible.
---
Epic

I had a killer not be able to down me for like 2 minutes the other day. Then finally did and face camped me sitting there hitting me. I had 2 teammates come and pull me off. Only goes to chase after me. I end up running him around for all 5 gens then he finally downs me again. Proceeds to face camp hitting me. A teammate fake pulls me off and gets hit then another grabs me with borrowed time and I get hit. The team ends up cutting the killer off. I made it into the gates and dead harded through the exit right as the killer DCs. Like I dont get this mentality. I never teabag because it seems stupid and I didnt BM. I just didnt go down as quick as they would like so they face camp then gets outplayed by the team and DCs. That level of childish temper tantrum blows my mind.

What are you even talking about? If you took 30 seconds to look into it you'd see that it's automatically tracked, so reporting does absolutely nothing except clog up the system which is why they specifically requested multiple times in their weekly stream to not report it. 
---
But why use common sense right? No doubt you do other equally silly things like reporting someone body blocking because the "option" is there. 
---
2019 bro, no reason to be this obtuse. 
---
I use Ruin, BBQ, Brutal Strength, and Spies from the Shadows. Getting rid of pallets is just a little bit faster, and I often have a hard time tracking people so Spies is awesome.

The Killer's Perspective

---
Yea I mained nurse and i didn't feel the need for it. Then I wanted to try the trapper because i like the idea of trying to kinda guess where they are going to run or force a chase into a trap spot. But my god I couldn't do anything past rank like 7 or 8 without ruin.
---
Yes - Survivor's perspective [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ars2ja/so\_you\_thought\_you\_could\_loop/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ars2ja/so_you_thought_you_could_loop/)
---
Op could just make the entity genderbend evehr episode. Look like a different person/creature
---
Constant t-bagging. Cool, you got that pallet stun and that killer shack loop! Wanted to do a butt dance for me so why shouldn't I make sure they can show that off to the entity? 
---
Next time stand in the basement and wait till birds appear on one then you know for sure and can’t get jukes (although I’m sure this is a rare occurrence lol). 
---
I had a Bill take the game hostage by hiding in a random locker earlier too. He’d been hiding nearly half the match though in a locker near the hatch waiting for the last two to die. Was so satisfying killing him. 
---
Naval training is basicaly botany knowlege but a bit tweeked
---
I have two videos of exactly that happening to me with billyboi
---
My general rule is no offerings or items for anyone under green bar 
---
Yes it’s satisfying but no, playing is not fun. Not when they gen rush you because when you hook someone they know to only send one person while the other two work on the gens. You are always only ever taking one person out of the equation. SWF goes against the concept of the game. 
---
i was playing wraith on auto haven records and I had a concert where the survivors threw firecrackers for special effects. i’ve achieved all my dreams and more!
---
You still didn't read their comment there, bud!
---
He got picked up right before the bleed out timer ended. So the next time he got downed. Pop instant dead
---
Damn some of these comments 😂😂 letting a killer hit you at the exit point is something a ton of survivors do. Whether it’s to give him free bloodpoints or to test the waters for NOED.  No excuse to lag switch though.
---
Anyone with tv in their name is the first to die. 
---
Yup. You are a cheater. And you know as well as I do you will never get banned for it, because BHVR doesn't understand their game.
---
He removes all the skill involved in a chase while also being bad. He's poorly designed 
---
They have two decent perks imo, discordance and iron maiden. If you really like Doctor then you will LOVE iron maiden. Jeff is nice for distortion. 
---
I only like to play Legion because a good 45% of survs will automatically DC when they see who it is and that will always be funny to me. Or if I've had a lot of bad matches in a row, they're usually easy to get a kill or two with.
---
There’s a reason why there isn’t a command wheel. 
---
Santa clown
---
Not a fan of self care anymore. I find it takes way too long, and wastes everyone's time and opportunity for altruism. But I'll consider running prove thyself with aftercare, so I can find a buddy in solo queue games. Thanks for the advice.
---
Am I missing something?  Trying to figure out if he had noed?  I thought the notification popped up when the gates were powered, is that not the case?
---
Clown with Santa outfit
---
Omg jump scare
---
Extra traps or darker traps are my favorites
---
Still works... That is from today.
---
I can't believe they added trimping to Dead By Daylight
---
(https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/arsy4g/watch_out_watch_out_as_requested/)[As per your request]
---
Buffs more than nerfs, almost always. BBQ doesn't need any changes regardless. 
---
Yeah, I mean the game is more balanced, but it's still unbalanced. If the survs do gens efficiently, you're just gonna get slaughtered, no getting around it.
---
That said, the coordination required to beat a killer that badly has increased, so I do think I run into significantly fewer outright unbeatable teams, which is nice. *Certainly* it's better balanced than it was in the months after the game came out. Golly, infinite loops? Self-care mid-chase? Exhaustion cools down while running? No wiggle required for everyone to use DS? Insta-blinds? Way more pallets? Yeah, it's nowhere near as bad as it was.
---
As far as perks go, those are fine, maybe try spirit fury instead of bamboozle since windows, while still problematic, aren't as game-breaking since they nerfed the large, forced loops in most main buildings. Though I don't think Clown is all that great, his ability is really boring and repetitive. Very low skill ceiling. I would try your hand at the Spirit, for my money she's the most well-designed killer in DBD and very fun to play as and against.
---
Shirtless Myers.. oh wait
---
I actually like being the first one chased by the killer. Believe me. Even i was like you. But when I get chased, I at least know for aure that no pallets were wasted 
---
I usually dont (i also dont have it ;( ) but i main pig so i dont need it that much
---
Have they implemented the LoS spawning changes to the totems yet? I thought that was still only a planned feature?
---
I meant more that it was fun when I didn't mess up and slid outside directly in front of a survivor.
---
^^^;-;
---
I wanna say they did, not completely sure. Though if they haven’t they need to hurry up because this is ridiculous.
---
How? Dodge every lobby i see?
---
BHVR gonna BHVR :/
---
Freddy buff when?
---
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/teleports-behind-you-nothing-personal-kid
---
lmao so true 🤣
---
That's because 1 survivor isn't doing the same amount as 1 killer in a game. They **shouldn't** get the same amount of blood points at all. 
---
People who make posts and comments that 1 survivor needs to be able to make excessive amounts of BP because killers do it are misunderstanding the roles. 
---
Killers make more BP because they expend more BP, they DO more.  Meanwhile survivors have little to do being split among 4 different people, survivors want to be tossed more BP for the simple act of doing a generator as if it was warranted. 
---
Ultimately I don't know what people are bothered by, either they want more BP in total ruining the BP economy or they are pissed killers get more BP with them. The former is a misunderstanding of the point of BP and the latter is just being ridiculous. 
---
I cant help but imagine that 'man' sitting in the 'chair' is entirely just a piece of the entity, like the light on the head of an angler fish, and it's real 'body' is ofcourse the entire room 
---
You deserved that for being a coward. 
---
Freddy is as good or better than Pig, Wraith, and Trapper. People utilize him in the worst possible manner (sleep one person and chase) then say "wow he sucks". 
---
From what I've heard, the entity is meant to be based on deadlights(?) which is the creature that takes the form of pennywise in IT(?). I like this spin on it though, and the way the doctor is done. Can't wait to read more of these. 
---
I might be completely wrong about this by the way, I've pretty much just had this paraphrased to me. 
---
Cool art, just not sure about the entity's depiction. The devs said multiple times that the entity doesn't have a defined "form" or "body," which is why the entity will never take the form of a killer, either. The answer for this from the devs is just "The entity is not that simple." 
---
That's the only gripe though, other than Herman's devices disappearing in one or two panels, mostly the eye ones, and his ability to, I'm pretty sure the entity put those on him to torture him and force him to comply. Not all of the killers obeyed willingly, like the Wraith and the Trapper, who are both burnt, torn, and skewered. 
---
I've wanted more story from DBD for such a long time, I would love to see more of this! 
---
There are a couple reasons i main pig she isnt top tier so i you cant say oh i lost because nurse, i think its funny being able to tbag a survivor, nothing is funnier and more satisfing then the trap going off
---
That’s what I was disagreeing with dude. That what the first comment (that’s now deleted) said and I was saying that he was wrong. You have everything mixed up guy.
---
U guys are crybabies SWF isn't going anywhere people wouldn't play the game is SWF got changed in a way that it made ques longer. Most SWF groups are really bad the communication is just trolling and gen rushing doesn't exist cmon. What a shitty post. If ur looking for support that's pathetic. 
---
If the game was shit then ill let them escape unless they had decisive... fuck decisive
---
NOED 
---
Links hunty LINKS :3333
---
Peyton Royce and Billie Kae
---
Well that makes me feel slightly better. I knew the belt, gloves, and skull were real as I had seen them before, but the furniture was new and really fucked up.
---
Billy hit that ramp hard and just kept on going...
---
"Finally, some good fucking wood" 
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Change playstyle from stealth to aggressive. Hiding doesn't quite work against the Doctor, so don't.
---
You can’t just ur am evade to avoid him. He may not be the best but you ain’t hiding from Herman.
---
Since when did one side care about the other sides feelings? 
---
Darker traps and the one where they open at random every 30 seconds. 
---
An easy buff for him is for all those random traps on the map that start untriggered, just make them armed when the game starts.
---
nope, only get the notification once someone gets hit for the first time 
---
Lol
---
Happened to me once. Solo'ed 4 gens. 2 others were messing around with the pig before they died. I was at the exit gate, I just needed that one extra second to open it but got pulled off the lever and hooked nearby. Jesus came and opened the gate but couldn't save me from my sins because the pig chased him off to the exit gate. 😔
---
I had a feeling this was the case. Its a terrible feeling, getting run over by a good group of survs, but I guess its what i sign up for when playing killer
---
I've checked out the spirit and she seems pretty nutty. Will give her a go!
---
Thank you very much for your reply.
---
So, bm'ing is smart all of a sudden? Wow
---
Shit I’m the same, nothing worse than being like 3rd chased and not knowing which pallets got used. I just hope to hell they get a few gens done, can’t count the amount of times WITHOUT ruin I’ve done atleast a three gen run and only one pops.
---
Sloppu Butcher ain't worth it
---
it is actually
---
&gt; Killers make more BP because they expend more BP
---
This right here. This especially hurts if you play a killer(s) that has a pretty heavy reliance on addons to be competitive (looking at you Freddy). Could you imagine the outrage if survivors' items were consumed at the end of a game, even if they didn't use it all and survived? Or, if they kept the item and lost the addon(s)?
---
To at least some extent, this would cause players to use their items and addons a little more judiciously, though I'm not sure how great of an idea it would be overall.
---
Is that when Freddy was released? If so, yes I agree
---
I would say it’s one of the rarer perks to pop up, though I have seen it unlike something like BBQ &amp; Chili.
---
You're making me blush...
---
Whats that build tho?
---
But yeah i love hitting through windows.
---
Been doing that alot, so many people dc if you play Legion. I just let them farm mend and altruism so everyone gets some BP at the end.
---
His power- Slim Shady. He can manipulate shadows to slow down survivors. His mori is eating them with moms spaghetti. 
---
Definitely. :( I can’t buy the dlc, so I’m trying to seek out perks.
---
Doesnt it make the most aense though?
---
If it gets to this point then the survivor who is still alive clearly ain't too good and relies on stealth too much and also relies on their team to win them the game for them.
---
Only if we get Cindy from Scary Movies (:
---
This is BS. 
---
95% of the time the killer is proximity camping/circling the hook like a shark even when there's no one around, making the right time to unhook close to impossible. They just want to tunnel the unhooked person as soon as they are unhooked. 
---
That's actually really good. 
---
I call bullshit on them, do a speed test on my phone and Screenshot it, send them it, and then ask for theirs. They never reply, and I block them to avoid that game again.
---
I mean it’s better than 3 megs trying to save you from the hook when Michael has noed (had this happen)
---
Toxic for what?
---
Who still use DH on David? Most people use BL or Lithe these days. 
---
You are joking right?😂
---
Hey chief, this is adding up, because this is it. 
---
Keep up the good work. 
---

Your version of the Entity can actually step on me 
---
I hope to fucking GOD this is a shitpost. If not, prepare your ass. 
---
Why do I see so many michaels use noeds and why do so many peoples use Michael anyways after the rank reset ? I had 5 michaels in a row 
---
I do this like every week not at the exit gates although that's a good idea. Never been banned although 90% of people brag about they were recording me. Not trying to brag about being a dick, I'm just saying this guy won't get banned
---
They don't ban lol
---
Thank you for the feedback! 
---
What happens if you leave while he's lagswitching and the game loads you on the hook after escaping?
---
You would be surprised how many people do it. If you get around to playing a lot of killer you'll see it plenty. Enjoy your solitude and your personal strength as a solo player. You are the tiger. 
---
It says 01-04 you've made four of these I wanna read them all this is really nice
---
Why does this have a spoiler tag
---
Yeah far enough.  then it's your team's fault for dying without cleansing totems/s
---
I mean I got matched couple times with rank 2 when I was about rank 16 so... 
---
I thought it would be cool to have a map on the set of Stab
---
Oh god, I can read all the comments with *his* voice.
---
Tbh i ended having the same survivor three times in a row and if i saw them first i would shake my head and tea bag as best i could (i play pig) and I'd just walk away i didn't want to be a dick
---
I think my comment was fairly clear about that, those stereotypes are pretty harmless.  I honestly don't think OP meant to be offensive, but the DBD-related material doesn't even make sense (physically picking up BP, a suing mechanism, and killers healing survivors, really?) so this basically boils down to "teehee Jews".  So my sentiment, which I thought was pretty clear, is come on...you can de better than that.
---
Had a game with 4 man Claudette’s and gent mins let the last one escape because she didn’t have flashlight or wasn’t tbagging unlike she’s friends...
---
Now that's ICONIC! 
---
We don't talk about Quentin here :&lt;
---
Different story if you use it dick over a camping killer or something thats fine whatever also i play pig so it lessens how much i hate it but like the problem is the killer is punished for outplaying the survivor
---
You can go into the settings and choose lengths. I know on the pro you can record for 30 minutes, not sure if it's the same on other consoles.
---
That could double for Michael Myers as well. 
---
Idk seems like people dc more often when the killer is doing the thing where they stalk you without entering chase so you can’t mend or escape. Otherwise I don’t really care. I’d rather play against a legion than a doc or Freddy.
---
To be fair John did have an element of surprise.
---
Tapp main btw Danny Glover waifu uwu
---
Why Claudette has a different scream from this video? 🤔
---
Because the devs are really bad at this game so they made a killer that takes no brainpower or skill to use.
---
[Here's an example of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R98e-Y4Lu8w).
---
Also instablind flashlights got nerfed because of this.

IT'S NOT LEWD YOU LIL PERV GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF THE GUTTER
---
He’s not broken, just inherently unfun to play against since he can essentially bully one survivor or drag the game out to 30+ minutes with constant stabbing.  A good team can obliterate a legion because he doesn’t have THAT great of map pressure but idiot survivors have the “gotta heal” mentality against legion so they give him free time to do whatever he wants.
---
This is why I don't dick around at the exit gate unless some has been downed or hooked. Had it happed twice today. 
---
both bring me much joy... K
---
Yeah you have to still move some but some are in such random places that it helps because they would never expect them in some places!
---
I never said it was bannned. It's not like something is toxic only if it is banned.
---
Interesting! I have a lot to learn, either way. I wish there was some pip rate data so I could see just how the killers were doing at each rank.
---
Enduring goes well with it.  Fast recovery from stuns and hit animations make you relentless in chases.  Could always make a full build out of it and throw on spirit fury too 
---
Just a perk imo.  The only ones that are gross are Franklin's and dying light.
---
Brand new part went from instant completing a gen to requiring skill checks to compete a gen to only completing 25% of a gen.
---
The actual rocket-propelled-chainsaw launcher
---
 Dr. Bright uses.
---
Ohh you mean the movie lmao, now I remember the scene 
---
I also shouldn’t have to go against killers that I can’t counterplay. Getting Legion once or twice isn’t bad, but getting them all day is annoying. Same with Spirit and Nurse. It’s unfun because they honestly have very little counterplay. Not to mention Frank’s Mixtape is busted right now and I DC immediately when I see it and if the Legion tunnels me instead of maximizing the survivors he mangles.
---
When I play legion I also make it a point not to tunnel one guy constantly and put my power to use because I know how shitty it feels to have a Legion run after your ass and stab you 4 times instead of putting pressure on the gens. 
---
I’m a survivor main.
---
Toxic killer behavior-
---
Tunneling
---
Face camping from the start of the match
---
DCing right before the survivors win the match because you’re salty it didn’t go your way
---
Toxic survivor behavior-
---
DCing instantly when hit, downed, or hooked by the killer
---
Purposefully hitting other survivors with pallets or purposefully missing skill checks in order to draw the killer over to where the rest of us are
---
Farming fellow survivors on the hook
---
T bagging
---
Standing in a locker most of the match
---
Survivors have more possibilities for being toxic cause they can be an ass to the killer AND their fellow survivors, whereas killers can only be dicks to survivors.
---
Due to how gens fast, killers get 13k anyways if not a top tier viable one. 
---
Thank you. We are punishing ourselves just cause we feel bad you had shitty teammates, and it’s always felt under appreciated, until now. So thanks. 
---
I've never been given the option to, maybe I'm wrong then but the point still stands without that particular aspect of it. How am I supposed to find another survivor in a large map and have enough time for them to wake me up before Freddy finds me? I mean if he doesn't tunnel me when he puts me to sleep.
---
Useless is not the word I would use. How is putting survivors to sleep and seeing their aura useless? In my opinion it's op but I do agree that he needs a rework.
---
That’s short-sighted. If all the “gg ez” people get all the bad killers/survivors to leave, there will only be good ones. And even they will get tired of swf flashlight decisive squadettes. It’s the fastest way to shove this whole game down the drain. 
---
Not saying you think that way but damn does it puzzle me
---
billy goes sicko mode
---
I don’t much care for Self Care. The fact that it needs Botany to be “normal” is two perks I’m dedicating just to heal myself and having a teammate do it will always be faster. 
---
Yes Auto does rely on skillchecks but that’s the nature of this game. I’ve healed people from downed to full with 1 skillcheck and gotten three in a row off of a tag team heal. When it works, it’s an amazing asset to have. Plus getting tokens just feels good to get sometimes, you know? 
---
I think he's just implying that it's a dick move, and most people would at least feel some sense of shame for (essentially) cheating.  
---
Hell, I main Killer, and I know matches can get you heated, but lag switching is low my dude. Real low.
---
But you won
---
How do you ever pull this off?
---
Interesting. So I take it you value Spies over M&amp;A? Its a bit different since Myer's already has a low terror radius on tier 1 so I usually find people. 
---
I really don't see Dead Hard as this OP impossible survivor perk all this being said, play survivor and killer pretty equally as well. self-care, adrenaline, and DS give me more grief than dead hard ever has, it just requires some mind gaming is all. 
---
I mean, if you wanted to check for NOED you can always stay still at the very end of the exit without moving, that way any hit will get you to the escaping end game screen
---
Ya, sure, you wanted to wave at the trapper to make you hit him, I get it, but I'm just sayin'
---
How can I safe this locally?
---
We don’t even need to change WGLF. Just buff point gains for side objectives. Make cleansing totems, searching chests, healing others worth more. Also make the completion of a killer specific act worth more. Wake Up, Snapping Out Of It, Mending and Searching Jigsaw Boxes give next to jack shit for BP. 
---
1) BBQ &amp; Enduring are great. I personally dont like ruin (I hate all hex perks as it too unreliable. Will it last 4 seconds or 4 minutes? Nobody knows!). I like thanatophobia and sloppy - esp with the longer heal times. If you want to play with claurophobia and distressing to be really evil? Or nurses? Its really up to you though!
---
2) The game is currently a bit more killer sided at the moment (if you take what the devs say about 2 kills being the goal) but this is the most balanced its been in a while tbh...
---
Why are you such a loser? 
---
Your lag switching to cheat in a game. That's at the very least a pathetic person. 
---
*_hmmmm*_
---
Play on xbox but switched to Ps4 because Xbox doesn't interest me anymore, was doing the lunar event and the amount of people dc-ing was ridiculous.  Had someone DC in the middle of getting chased by the killer. People immediately start struggling after getting hooked once while I'm running to save them and dies. Throws pallete in front of me while I'm getting chased by the killer. The killer never saw them they were just sitting in the cabin saw that I was running for my life, threw it down and got me killed. 
---
I don't play this game that much anymore even though my sisters always ask, just tired of annoying, salty, useless survivors who do nothing but totems, hooks, loot and watch me get chased instead of doing gens, but God forbid they touch a gen, maggots can't even do that right,  you only need 2 fingers to do gens stop using your buttcheeks!
---
I have see one like this before but this better.
---
I think it’s because most huntress’ throw the hatchet and miss extending the chase even more.  I’ve never played as her, but plenty against and if they aren’t surgical with that thing, he odds of me escaping are pretty good. 
---
Kates are horrible at this
---
I rarely go against a Nurse (I'm on ps4) and love seeing people use and try to learn her, so whenever I verse her and she doesn't get any kills, I always try and give her a free kill, but they're always nice enough to take me to the gate and not get the kill.
---
Honestly, I started not running Ruin a lot more just because I was tired of starting the game near it and having Survivors rush into it or having to go check to see if someone was already on it, find out they were and we’re already done cleansing it. It can be powerful, but it also can spawn right next to a generator so I’m learning not to rely on it so much. 
---
What I have comes to terms with in my games is that the first two generators going off aren’t a concern. I’ve got two minutes roughly, to assess the rest of the game. Because players tend to spawn nearby each other a lot, if I chase one guy, most of the time the remaining survivors are on two gens and it’s on the same side so they just 3 gen themselves. 
---
Also this is why I’m loving Legion so much. I don’t need Ruin to slow gen speed, my constant chase and stab playstyle keeps people off gens, keeps them injured with Sloppy Butcher and I can also get people to DC cause they think I’m gonna Franks Mix Tunnel them when in reality I’m running Filthy Blade and Stolen Mural Sketch. 
---
Do you actually feel accomplished using a lag switch to win? I mean you didnt earn any of that yourself. How is that even fun? 
---
A Legion let me win after all 3 other teammates disconnected. :)
---
She doesn't. Respect pallets as little as possible with Huntress, because high rank survivors expect you to wind up a hatchet when you reach one. Otherwise you're giving them another lap around the loop. 
---
This happens in high wall loops or the pallets over at MacMillan. Other than those you will have chances to hit survivors with hatchets without having to loop around pallets to reach them
---
Tell us on our profiles. 
---
"Stop using your buttcheeks" 😂😂😂
---
100% agree with everything you said.
---
I think one of the devs even said that they wished they had that, but I'm guessing that got shut down by the other devs.
---
It slows healing down a lot, it is definitely worth it, especially paired with Nurses Calling.
---
Hag can fuck people up if you know how to use her
---
It's worse than that, it drives the non-toxic players away and leaves more toxic players to continue to egg each other on.
---
What a beautiful treasure. 
---
I mean, Legion by themselves isn't really broken at all aesthetically designed but not designed around the DbD gameplay. You can honestly just tell that testing on this killer was not very thorough.  Because Legion is only considered OP or broken because of how the killer is augmented by perks that aren't their own and their own add-ons.  
---
People's chief complaints are tunneling, breaking chase to follow blood (bloodhound), and franks mixtape.  
---
Tunneling is firstly and most importantly not against any rules it just sucks to be tunneled we've all been there, but that's not this killers fault it's the person playing them, you can tunnel on any killer even other ones who ignore mechanics like the nurse.  Legion's power doesn't even incentivize tunneling without the use of Frank's, it's supposed to meant to track and keep all survivors injured as much as possible while cleaning up with regular chases, tunneling with the legions power honestly makes the chase take longer at base level. 
---
Franks should be legions ultra rare (pink/red) addon honestly it's power feels appropriate for that level of addon and changes the legions power level enough to warrant the rarity. At it's current rarity level they are just too common in webs and this is coming from a P3 Legion player. Franks makes the game easy especially with easy to get perks like sloppy or bloodhound. 
---
The issue on breaking chase and following blood is an issue with the game itself and chase detection that legion takes advantage of more than any other killer because  the mend mechanic means the victim has to stop eventually and fix themselves. 
---
I think a good balancer for this would be just make Frenzy injure survivors on first hit and only have a mend timer if they're hit a second time or while injured. It still incentivizes healing against legion since you wouldn't have to deal with mend in the healthy state.  Also if we could fix mending not to fuck up vision of the survivor with the darkened screen would be SO nice on maps that are already really dark like the Game and the Freddy Map you're essentially blinded in parts of the map. 
---
Even as a legion player I would like more counterplay options in the game --in general-- not just against legion.  I hope the devs introduce a new mechanic that can be done besides looping pallet to pallet because I get so bored going in circles I often just leave chases and wander elsewhere. 
---
I've been playing DBD since it was free on Ps Plus, quickly became a killer main. Have only facecamped once in my time playing (I try to stay at green ranks but have gotten to rank 1 two times) I facecamped because 4 man swf group with 4 decisives, urban evasion, the works. Good flashlights and tbagging every opportunity. End of match they added me to a message group and did nothing but spam Duuuuuud and baby killer at me. I love this game, but I really hate this game.
---
No, we're just useless trash boys who can't even win a 1v2
---
But I like Bubba :\
---
It doesn't matter if you think it's not fun, I don't have to validate myself to some asshole on Reddit :)

Not even mind gaming really. Just wait half a second and they'll dead hard. The only thing that saves them is dead harding to a pallet/window which is really good, but other than that I can't believe how so many killers get so mad at DH
---
So many killers are going to have bad days when dedicated servers eventually come out.
---
You're missing a bit of intelligence
---
I hate playing against Legion. He’s the worst to go against, in my opinion. Legion and the Doc both. I don’t rage. But when I play against Legion I usually die less than 10 minutes into the game. I don’t think it’s the character. I just think every Legion I go against is a cancerous human 
---
I'll admit, I was a little confused when you asked what Leatherface was from, but yeah, it's an easy to forget scene, though it is the first time I'd ever seen someone thrown on a meathook.
---
It's a different team working between switch port and network stuff
---
I don't use it on Billy. 
---
*misses a hit* “Nair leh”
---
&gt;communication is just trolling
---
That's an excuse and you know it. You could be a group of bumbling idiots but even so much as a "he's chasing me" is a pretty big advantage. It really does alter the gameplay.
---
Yeah because as this game grows, the license holders will ask for more and more money. It's probably a small blessing that they got Mikey as early on as they did. Either that or John Carpenter did them a solid. Or they figured that they'd make back what they paid out in revenue and growth. This is all speculation of course. 
---
Saw this before, seems to be a bug that keeps appearing 
---
I've always imagined the entity to be female. Don't know why.
---
fix legion before adding another char
---
Ok
---
Now to be fair it really really sucks when you have a shit game and just cant get downs for whatever reason theyre constantly taunting and then you finally down that one fuck who is actually good at the game grab em... and dc then they all tbag you at the exit
---
So i unistalled
---
*Sad drunken gibberish*
---
Troll or Loser!? xD
---
Believe me, high rank gameplay isn't that great either.
---
I've been/visited Rank 1 at least once during the last 4 seasons so far, and it has pretty much ruined the game for me.
---
The higher the rank, the sweatier the gameplay will be. This meaning that high ranks (Rank 1 especially) is about 50% Godlike Spirits and Nurses. Facecamping starts being pretty common too, at least on PC in the EU region. Basically, the gameplay is much more difficult and you encounter a lot of campers and S Tier killers.
---
How has it ruined the game for me? Well. At this point, getting to rank 1 has become an addiction and it's making the gameplay sweaty and frustrating rather than being fun. The worst part is that when you finally reach Rank 1, deranking to 10-13 is pretty much impossible too because you'll want to maintain that rank.
---
At this point, I recommend not aiming for rank 1 if you get easily obsessed from high ranks. Stay at 10-20. You'll get much more joy out of it.
---
TL;DR: Rank 1 is shite and I'm addicted so I can't quit.
---
Fookin  Laser sights 
---
Cindy? Why Cindy? 
---
Wait how did he do that?
---
*DESTROYED* with *FACTS* and *LOGIC*
---
Michael and NOED are a duo. As well as camping. 
---
Meat packing is the worst map in the game, I do t blame them. It's small and has very little places to hide. Most people would rather just take the hit and leave for a better map. 
---
You start falling from the upper window and time the lunge right. It's simple Fred.
---
“There’s no way that’s really a thin- of fucking course.”
---
Omg u can’t hit your decisive against doc. So sad. Can we get this comment to 25 likes?
---
Leave next time.
---
It could be because once they go straight they get a hatchet in the ass
---
Imagine unironically downvoting art this great
---
I expect nothing less from such a toxic community
---
then later same meme but reverse the roles and change the switch port to releasing dedicated servers
---
Don't worry, it's okay. As long as you're aware of how it feels now and won't repeat it, it's fine. Play both sides so you know how it feels and don't succumb to the "us vs them" mentality. A large majority of the community have that mentality because they specifically play survivor only or killer only so they don't know how it feels to be in the receiving end of a survivor flickering flashlights and tbagging the killer, or a killer just hitting and nodding at the survivor on the hook for no reason. 
---
It does but they don’t care 
---
I like Hag
---
If you go to the end game a lot, I suggest rancor. Ignore the obsession, get your stacks then at the end of the game insta down your obsession and mori him. 
---
Doc is barely mid-tier lol
---
You was going to die there anyways without the lag but it sucks I guess
---
Pig, shes not top tier, i generally do decent with her, slows the game with ruin, i can fuck people with decisive, i can tbag survivors, pigs are gud
---
nothing is better then using the shroud and getting disconnects.
---
Lm
---
This is amazing, holy crap. I love this art style! Also that's what Gangs cosmetic should have looked like instead of dirt and being ripped 
---
Holy shit! I gotta try this. I always get looped here. lol
---
True. I just changed my privacy settings to stop the messages. They’re fucking ridiculous
---
Man if you are triggered by Urban Evasion just imagine how their actually efficent teammates feel. I love UE gamers in my game, they never get shit done so plenty of time to win. 
---
Thank you!
---
He's a terrible killer
---
There is nothing to talk about he sees you during chase and that's it he doesn't havy any other thing to help him and waking up is easy
---
Probably the Entity could be a male and a female whatever. 
---
Oh I plan to. I know I suck right now but I'll keep practicing. 
---
true facts right here.
---
Killer's role is way more intense and work heavy, while losing all add-ons 100% of the time. 
---
Decisive strike has appeared in the shrine 7 times and last appeared in the shrine on September 24, 2018. 
---
Just fucking play them and get over it honestly. 
---
Alrightt, as a Jew this isn’t offensive, but only perk 3 made me laugh, the rest are meh.
---
First of: I know it is the minority of the streamers who behave like I will explain below, most streamers I met where pretty chill and you can have a good talk with them in the endgamechat.
---
But sometimes if you play well (or if you are just lucky) against a streamer, they will accuse you of stream sniping or ghosting and such shit. It is honestly mind blowing, like yeah, I definitly used your stream to find you, the fact that you are running nonstop the whole game or the fact that I have BBQ has nothing to do with the way I found you. Also: If I would ever start to stream the game and put the tv in my steamname... How the hell could I blame someone for looking at a stream I advertised for them?
---
Your entity reminds me of Hoenheim from FMAB. The father of the 7 Deadly Sins, not the brothers' father lol
---
"Child Rape exists, thus I'm not an asshole"
---
I expected no other kind of mental gymnastics from a cheater.
---
Hopefully you'll grow up one day, for your own sake.
---
As an added FYI, Barbecue &amp; Chili has only appeared in the shrine once, back on October 30, 2017. 
---
&gt; Calling other people babies for getting frustrated iver cheating
---
Says the guy who just a month ago was whining abiut Killers "Playing like assholes" during an event. 
---
The lack of self-awareness is incredible.
---
I think stepping away and taking in some fresh air is the first step. Maybe watch some tutorial videos on how to play killer and also play some survivor as this will give you perspective on the either side that will make chases easier.   
---
Really dude, just take a break. I don't know if you suffer from depression or some form of mental illness, but I am telling you from personal experience that it's best to step away for a bit. 
---
Yeah. I’m hoping one day the devs can work something out with the reporting system but I know they’re trying their hardest in the long run. 
---
But you’re right. My bf hates when I get angry because he knows it affects me and it makes him feel awkward when I’m pissed. 
---
I’ll look at it in the perspective of “maybe they’re just upset or looking for someone to mess with so just don’t be that person”. Hopefully that’ll work if I pursue that long enough. 
---
Thanks for your helpful response! 
---
Nah that shits lazy, I mean like loops and shit not camping
---
Respect
---
"I am a rank 1 killer every season who is just not even that good at the game"
---
Did you ever consider this might be because you don't actually deserve to be at rank 1 based on ability and you need to improve your skills by taking some of these harder games?
---
I think that's because killers can directly victimize the person they're mad at. The killer equivalent of the angry message is tunneling and facecamping the person they're mad at.
---
1. No.
---
2. It's still a low tier shitty meme. 
---
honestly i've delt with more toxic survivors than killers, even when i play survivor
---
&gt; (and based on Killer proximity to the hook rather than Terror Radius, because Insidious exists). 
---
This would definitly be a step in the right direction but it should also consider if there are other survivors nearby. Because if one survivor is looping the killer infront of the hook I am hanging on, then it is the fault of my teammate that the killer won't leave me.
---
Mori is the cherry on top
---
Did you not read what I wrote?

Welcome to the game, where that's part of the risk of going into solo queue.

That fixes nothing about how SWF is completely broken. OP has a point.
---
Yeah I read what you wrote. 
---
The burden shouldn’t be on one player? I’m not saying that it isn’t risky to play solo. 
---
Maybe perfectly was a stretch but playing the game as well as one can possibly do is what I pretty much meant. 
---
I don’t understand where the slight bitterness comes from. 
---
You ok man? 
---
I want fair games, even if that means I lose some, and that happens often enough in fair lobbies. However cheaters (read: SWF) are just not fun to play against. Sharing information cross-map in a game that has **chosen** to not add voice comms to the game is just as bad as wallhacking in shooters. The only difference is how you gather the information you're not supposed to have. Either by the means of other players or by the means of an application. Rank really does not matter to me, I'd gladly drop back to rank 20 and climb back up to rank 1 with ease, as long as SWF would be gone.
---
Ur playing this game 100% for fun and nothing else. There are no benefits for being high rank,   no rewards, the only thing u can sorta grind for are levels for shards to get cosmetics. Just find a group of cool people blast some music and play the game
---
Reposted?
---
Yeah that sounds like a good idea. I’ll try that. I didn’t actually think about music to help. Usually I play music as killer because it feels less sound reliant. 
---
Thank you for your advice! 
---
If one smash player in a lobby can kill everyone's connection from shitty WiFi, I'm scared of a game with more environment being ported to the switch.
---
It seems he expects to be dead...by daylight.
---
God dammit Sheogorath, not again.
---
Tbh DS is the only survivor perk that annoys me. All those others are fairly well balanced. 
---
Yea no problem! Also remember its perfectly natural to get annoyed. Like if i get tunnelled or noed or pallet looped hard as killer or some shit, yea il sigh or whatever but il just go next and forget it like i wont lose sleep over it.
---
My girl Brenda did not carry all 4 movies to be disrespected like this. 
---
Idk why people care so much about SWF. Win some lose some, just go on to the next game. I enjoy challenging games anyways so if I get stomped so be it. The sooner you stop giving a fuck about how many kills you get, the more fun you'll have. 
---
Its not bcs of the bad ping, its lagswitch set for 1 or 2 sec
---
Lmao that movie was bad but good at the same time. 
---
Depends imo. If you're 3 gens in and the guy is about to be sacrificed (last hook) and he DCs then I'll just continue playing like normal.
---
Same thing if they DC at the start of the match. Unless its under 3 people then I feel like its still completely doable since a gen is knocked off the counter.
---
In any other scenario, fuck it. Lets farm a bit so everyone's comes out with something!
---
same tbh.
---
I'll let people farm w/ a DC if I've hooked everyone twice but usually people just give up on first hook 🤷🤷
---
The Entity is giving me chills (Why is he so god damn hot)!!! Very well done. Always a pleasure to see your art &lt;3
---
Thank you my friend! I’m so glad you liked my art :D
---
Difference was hillbilly was there from the start and long before they even had licensed killers planned probably. Now they're at a point where if they wanted a license killer, they would have gotten them by now and not have made a discount version of them if getting the real version was possible.
---
y i k e s  what a jebait
---
Can't speak for others, but the reason I let people go as killer is usually the same. I came for a challenge, I don't want an easy win. I feel disapointed if I'm not given enough survivors, someone's trolling their teammates by unhooking them in front of me repeatedly, or a survivor walks up and tries to make friends. Imma let people go in that case cause it's no fun anymore to try and catch people.
---
He was a bellend
---
People still think tunneling is bm 
---
It's literally the most effective way to play killer.  Always go after the injured one who has been hooked before since the goal is to turn the 4v1 into a 3v1 asap.  Otherwise gens keep being completed at a faster rate.  Survivors complaining about killers tunneling is like killers complaining about survivors gen rushing.  It's their objective.  It makes sense to get it done as fast as possible.
---
For more nsfw fan Content! 
---
Freddy IS broken, but he's not op if that makes sense. He's horrendous game design; and therefore broken. However, he still gets looped harder than anyone else and is therefore garbage. 
---
It's pretty silly that the devs and overall community are trying to move away from the pallet looping meta, and yet there is a killer where pallet looping is the only answer because there is no escape from them otherwise. Killers should not have infinite wall hacking abilities in a game that tries to encourage breaking chases and stealth. If a Freddy puts you to sleep, you are *technically* doomed unless he gives up on you as it is impossible to escape the dream world without a skill check, and skill checks cannot be acquired with Freddy on your ass. Players should never be placed in "no hope" situations by something as simple as a killers base power  
---
Iron Will, Quick and Quiet, Calm Spirit, Lightweight, Dance With Me, Object of Obsession, Sole Survivor, Alert, Dark Sense, and Distortion are all perks that do *NOTHING* against Freddy simply for the way he's designed. You could run these fun, non-meta perks and risk wasting the slots against Freddy, or you could simply use generic looping perks like Decisive, Adrenaline etc. for guaranteed usage. Yay Freddy!
---
Tl;dr Freddy is bottom tier but still horrible game design that encourages a meta that the devs hate. He is also extremely boring to play against 
---
I usually play survivor but I just unlocked Myers finally so I’ve been having some fun playing killer . First 1 dc during my Mori, second dc immediately after. Last 2 gave up on the hook first time. RIP
---
It's not that it's "not for everyone". It's that SWF on voice comms actively goes against the design of the game. Saying what essentially amounts to "get over it" just continues to allow the design of the game get undermined.
---
I agree most occasions killer wins since again the amount of skill required on the part of survs has increased, but I still think if both sides play very optimally the killer loses in most cases. Just too hard to counter gens finishing in 3-4 minutes
---
Using a troll perk like Insidious is more likely to lead to them dc'ing on you running that mori.
---
You really expect me to think these clowns have the money for a lawsuit? Rofl
---
But death...is not an escape.
---
I exclusively play killer because I suck at survivor
---
Found the Trump supporter lol touchy :,) 
---
Oh let me tell you, love, maining the killer in this game is brutal. You need to be constantly focused on literally everything. Survivors need to learn how to react to killers behaviour but it’s killers initiative to try to outsmart them. But then you get times where you meet some people with the power of invisibility. You search all gens, nothing started, you spend 5 minutes searching for any sign of life just to get 3 gems pop simultaneously while you’re sitting there like “but I’ve just been there???”. So it’s tons of work. But once you get the grip and you learn how to handle things, it’s really satisfying! Especially after you catch that one annoying egg who had been looping and teabagging you for eternity. 
---
Try different killers and first and foremost, enjoy yourself. Happy hunting 💙 x
---
Nah this music is actually decent, everything with Frank including his music taste is bad 
---
Oof sorry orange bad man dun gotcha. 
---
Love butthurt politics. 
---
Can't the shape use it to stalk? And nope, I've seen otherwise, although it's not the majority.
---
*gets popcorn*
---
I WAS NOT READY
---
Not every SWF is toxic. 
---
Have you seen the loading times?
---
Camping and tunneling isn't a main goal of killer's plays as you are trying to tell with this rhetoric. So no, doing gens isn't toxic
---
Ahah used to play with someone who would even D/C during KYF. Haven't played much with him since, felt like an insult, and we now have a great fun bunch, usually laughing at our own mistakes and having general fun. 
---
Usually, I switch to either a small game on the phone while watching some youtube, or just grab the switch and play some tales of vesperia. Whatever suits you, but find the "line". When you realize you start crossing it, just drop the game and it will be alright :)
---
Brenda = claudette
---
Cant blame anyone moris aren't fun nor are they balanced (killer who rarely uses moris)
---
I heard that the reason the Trapper has all the hooks and things in his body is cause the Entity tortured him into compliance. Could be wrong tho
---
In case you aren’t paying attention both Ochido and trump share predator behavior, completely relatable, and they probably are both going to get fucked by the legal system within the same time frame if a investigation is opened for Ochido.
---
Sorry you’re so tryhard 
---
With my Last Legion guy the second i downed someone with my Legion Moonwalk 3 of em insta dc :D 
---
Exactly. I mean how can they be legally binding when little kids everyday agree to these EULA’s for Fortnite and Apex legends just by clicking a mouse button.
---
I mean dodging cross map chainsaws is not hard, and if you get caught by one you probably weren't really hiding (yet?). Billy with chainsaw can only come from the open areas from far away.
---
That's why I play legion because he ends chases quickly 
---
I wonder if they are actually going to waste money on this useless lawsuit...
---
dc when game booted up
---
Well it’s easier to not get mad as killer imo because you’re more in control and you can just write survivors off. 
---
The survivor depends on both your teammates and the killer. 
---
I play swf and it’s a lot nicer because communication really helps. Plus you can interact with your teammates more. 
---
I’ll try just accept that sometimes you get gross teammates and you get ones you just wanna give money for being amazing. 
---
Thanks for your comment tho! 
---
And then proceeds to beat the other survivors with then newly collected spine
---
nice art
---
Best thing is getting a hit over the fences in Haddonfield.
---
I had to stop because people kept complaining I was farming.
---
If you are gonna report me for being nice I'm gonna stop. Sorry for the nice survivors I have cut down in cold blood.
---
Shes an M1 killer though, she is OP i know but in the hands of pros. Shes still an M1 killer, it makes sense.
---
A lot of players want an easy game and just die/dc if they are facing someone good, particularity at lower ranks.
---
On the other hand if the killer is using broken addons I dont blame people to be honest, who wants to play aginst Omegablink, prayer beads, mixtape, irehead or infinite tier 3
---
Thanks!
---
If only DbD had gibs, sadly it does not.
---
Yeah, funny thing is I didn’t even really get a chance to use it this game. I was trying to get everyone hooked once first before I set up some insidious moris. They def dc because of the Mori 
---
One can only hope!
---
I had a daily ritual as Leatherface, my first time playing as him, I went after this Nea and she got away. Disconnected, chased after Meg who just been standing there and she disconnected.
---
I ended up letting Claudette and Feng go; they allowed me to chainsaw and hook them a couple times. It was all good in the end.
---
Id just ignore people who defend NOED, its just a never ending argument. They will defend that free kill for bad players perk to the grave
---
I had a game last night where three survivors dc'd for unknown reasons and I tried to get the last survivor to do one more gen to get hatch but they wouldn't.. they just wanted to die I guess 
---
Yes you can use it to stalk. It’s pretty nice in tier 2 once your terror radius has been enlarged. I don’t usually run the perk though, just decided to try to go after some kills with it . 
---
He couldn't beat you using skill so he summoned his Stand "King Krimson!" 
---
Oh no
---
Bans aren't real in this game. A friend of mine is playing with very obvious item hacks and speed hacks for over a year now on a second acc just to see how long he can get away with it. He still plays today 
---
He clicked "I agree" on the ToS, dat ass is grass.
---
O I am laffin.
---
I prestiged him to lvl 2 just yesterday :(
---
She was hinted in the files for a long while, yeah. 
---
&gt; You are basically saying that you don't care at all about shitty times some of them would have.
---
Implying survivors have EVER... EVER ever cared about the killer's fun.  That's just something that doesn't happen.  Killers are expected to let survivors go when someone on their team doesn't connect.  Killers are expected to play in a sub optimal way so that survivors can have fun.  Killers are expected to give survivors a chance to live at EVERY opportunity so that they can just turn around and teabag/emote at the exit gate because you weren't playing in the 100% optimal way.  Stay next to hook too long?  NOED?  Ebony Mori?  Be prepared to get flamed in post-game chat for not going out of your way to pander to the survivor's vapid idea of what's fair.  
---
You know what happens when I try out funky builds and have mercy on survivors and try to spread my attention between everyone equally?  1 or 2 will escape and they'll just teabag me at the exit and "gg ez" in postgame.  You know how I can insure this happens even less?  Playing in the 100% optimal way.  If survivors were more gracious about winning and concerned themselves with what killers find fun, then maybe I wouldn't feel the intense desire to destroy them every round.  But they don't, and so I do.
---
They can try all they want but the only thing that will really come of it is wasted money on their end. More so when when he has, himself, admitted that he deserved the ban when he begged for the unban on Cotes stream.
---
Wth bro I'm getting ads in my notifications now and I didn't even finish the download because of the fishiness of the website.
---
Just killed a 4man swf group and they keep crying on my profile because I used a mori, which I did for a daily
---
They are just weird, sometimes they are in front of me and I don't get blinded and sometimes they are crazy far away and I get a full blind, it's very inconsistent
---
I still can't believe this is real due to how utterly stupid it is.
---
I've watched enough Chinese Cartoons to know where this is going.
---
No,no I don't
---
Might be your rank. I play in rank 1 both killer and survivor and I see far more DCs after rank reset in higher ranks but in lower ranks it's not as much
---
This is what happens when you only play one side the majority of the time. 
---
I mean, I mostly care about winning too as a killer, it's not like I'm a humanitarian or something in online competitive games or something. But I know how it feels when you were tunneled to death, and also if feels much more interesting to play without it.
---
No one cares dude. It's DBD subreddit not your dumb political echo chamber.
---
Where's the scam alert bot?
---
Don't buy from these stores.
---
&gt; EULA which is a binding contract technically
---
situationally. The EULA is only binding as far, if at all, it is compliant with local law. Law &gt; EULA always. But as far as ingame bans go, im sure there is absolutely no law whatsoever preventing Behaviour from denying their online service to anyone they see fit.
---
This. I always feel this way especially playing killer. 
---
Mostly because you won't be really able to tunnel unhooked person every time without it. Some people claim that they only tunnel without camping, but I still decided to address both
---
But there is no title. 
---
Wraith yeah, but I'd prefer drawing Freddy to the others tbh.
---
Why would you want to give someone a chance to be saved when it'd most likely mean they escape because all the Gens have been done? You're there to kill.
---
I kinda understand the situation cause had the same sorta one earlier but I was the Killer and DC,  (i was playing wraith aswell) but in my case i think i may have stumbled into a 3-man SWF cause it was only a certain 3 survivors together while the 4th went off and did their own thing, and one of the 3 main survivors had a flashlight I'm not sure about the other two but everytime I'd go after one the other two would swarm me you know body block in shit (i know thise are viable tactics but when it happens alot it gets frustrating) plus the one with a flashlight would flash me when ever i would pick up her friends and the pick up animation wouldn't end in time for me to look away to not get blinded so I'd end up dropping the survivor and a bunch of other crap they were doing, plus i was in a bad mood from the shit survivor games i had earlier all boiled up inside and i rage quited, so maybe the killer you were againt was in similar situation as me so he DC'd or he could just be toxic
---
((Didn't mean to make it this long, i kinda had to vent))
---
Maybe things will improve once you reach lvl10?
---
Lmao just don't play the game. 
---
Noed = you deserve it
---
For killer now anyway lmaooo
---
Legion basically is ghostface
---
You realise by using this that some surviviors just suck so bad at the video game
---
You mean NOED smh
---
Wriath? Is that a new killer? /s
---
weekend claudette
---
Because killers need a lot of bloodpoints just to play. Without addons most killers are downright trash and as killers don't get useful addons every bloodweb. And since survivors have alternative ways of obtaining items such as chests it seemes to balance out.
---
If you think in that way then  better stop playing as a killer because it is not your thing.
---
As a killer you must face that because, if you did not notice, they are A TEAM. What means that they will comunicate. Damn, there is a code based in signs/movements for them to comunicate without even having a skype/discord/whatever talking communication.  
---
They can tell eachother where you are or where you put a trap without speaking, or even tell if you are coming back to a hooked survivor because of his movements in the hook. 
---
Bold of you to assume this doesn’t happen in purple and red ranks. 
---
Literally the last reference I expected to see on this board, ouft.
---
First one I agree with, but the second one, 1 gen knocked off is just NOT enough. Survivors are STILL at a massive, massive disadvantage.
---
Not only is it nowhere near an equal trade just with a numbers game, but people VASTLY underestimate how one less survivor effects things.
---
For one, when someone's being chased, that's a third of the survivors being distracted, as opposed to a quarter, but it's worse if someone gets hooked.

When someone is hooked in a fair game, the killer USUALLY takes up an extra 2 people's time - one to save, and one being chased/having to hide. That leaves another on gens, if you're being efficient. Even if you're being inefficient (two go to the hook), immediately after the unhook, you still save time by having multiple people healing OR one of the rescuers going on a gen sooner.
---
In a 3v1, once someone is hooked, everyone's time gets taken up, or the hooked person loses a hook state if someone wants to pop a gen (usually because they're desperate), and by the time you're finished, the other survivor could be back on the hook. In a 4v1, survivors generally have the luxury of being able to finish a gen they're working in, but in a 3v1, every hook pulls the survivors to a complete standstill.
---
And imagine if he wins his lawsuit and the devs at dead by daylight have to implement all his improvements/fixes? Crazy.
---
How about don't DC?  Like I said, it sucks to be camped, but sometimes that's what you're dealt with.  Although you're being fucked over, you are severely screwing your whole team over by DCing.  The killer benefits from the DC and continues his shitty ways. 
---
This mentality of "Fuck it, I'm DCing" has become a massive plague to the game and shouldn't ever be an option unless you're absolutely stuck.  It's a selfish act that fucks over everyone.  It shouldn't be encouraged or condoned. 
---
I said I gave up on playing sub-optimally because survivors would always just taunt at the end. It doesn't matter if one or two in a game don't the fact if even one Survivor is toxic it's not worth my time or energy or patience to play in a way that is fun for all of them. If you want to stop killers from being assholes to you guys first stop all of the asshole survivors from being little bitches. Don't give Killers a reason to be toxic and they won't be. Ball is entirely in your Court. It doesn't matter if 50% of survivors aren't toxic. I have to treat them all as if they were to avoid the worst possible scenario of toxic survivors winning.
---
You didn’t give the killer a terror radius value. The whole punch thing seems thrown in. You didn’t flesh that out just said it takes 3 punches but does that mean the 1st injures the 2nd does deep wounds and the 3rd depletes the meter or something? Sounds to me like how legions frenzy takes 3 hits to down someone if you have franks mixtape. If the killers attacking a survivor why wouldn’t they transform back to their normal form and down them in the regular 2? The killers power and Panic just punish people who play solo survivor and don’t communicate: SWF just talk to each other and sort everything out really easily but solo survivors don’t have that option. The killer perks here are way too powerful: fear doesn’t have any variety in ranks 1 2 3 given and you say unlimited range which just stops an injured survivor from doing anything productive no matter where they are; Alpha just rushes sacrifices way too much and offspring is just Spies from the Shadows+1 in that it has unlimited range and injures survivors. Especially on offspring it’s ridiculous cause the trappers entire power is to damage survivors a health state using the map and environment but this is just universal and requires no setup, not to mention that if a survivor bumps into a crow on the floor of Lery’s, passes by one in a chase etc. they shoot themselves in the foot.  Offspring even applies deep wounds, sort of acting like the bear trap that catches a survivor and makes them spend time getting free. This perk alone at any rank is far better than the trappers power, which doesn’t apply deep wounds, and spies from the shadows. I agree with the above, that curiosity is awkward, hardly increasing your speed and needing a lengthy and unreliable buildup. TASTBT is just way better than things like premonition and Object of Obsession and doesn’t even have a range. Atychiphobia at least isn’t anything crazy but it’s still really weird when paired with curiosity. Lastly, I like it when games and characters are designed to be fun over anything else.
---
That Alpha Predator is something I would always have on. 
---
At rank 1 killer, 2 to 3 gens are done (ignoring ruin) in the first 3 minutes, usually by then you get your first hook. So you're telling me I get to instantly kill a survivor 3 minutes in vs a good swf team.  Yes please. Overpowered.
---
Even as a hex it means that I can chose to remove ruin for it so they dont look for the hex.  Even better every game they look for all the tottems afraid the killer has Alpha. So OP.
---
I think it's mainly because of the vicious circle. These survivors suffer against camping and tunneling killers. Get fed up. Conclude that all killers are toxic like the noon fucks who camped/tunneled. Proceed to be toxic to all the survivors. 
---
Same goes for killers. Come across survivors tea bagging. Conclude that every survivor is toxic. Proceeds to be toxic towards survivor.
---
Super immersed teammates that literally only urban around and hide not touching a single gen triggers me so hard.  I get it if you're new to the game but this is rank 1 for christ sake.  
---
After watching a useless David all game do literally  nothing while also moronically body blocking me into the killer for a down earlier I got sick of my friend and I carrying him all game.  So I chose to take care of that.
---
I opened my door handle to 99%.  I saw Useless David self caring across map.  I ran to him and motioned for him to follow me which he did instead of self caring to full.  I brought him to my door but blocked the 99% handle.  I waited for killer to come before running away and watching him get downed.  I finished the door after he got hooked.  Killer surprisingly left across map and didn't camp final kill.  I hung out at hook spamming him for about 25 seconds before killer came to stop me from "saving" him then I simply ran out.  I can only take so many games of running a killer for 3 minutes while you don't touch a single gen before I snap.
---
Yeah, I'm not mad I found it really funny I was not expecting that lol. I don't normally see Nurse with NOED. She was pretty decent too.
---
Playing solo is difficult when it comes to totems you never know when all 5 are cleansed ):
---
Fun is just a subjective word. For me, it's not fun if I get camped or tunneled. Same way, it s not fun for me to get teabagged. 
---
Will it be the same for everyone? No.
---
Indeed. It’s pretty Gouda. 
---
Most SWF weakness is the inability to leave anyone behind in the match and their extreme over altruism. 
---
Find the weak looper or get an early down and patrol them and whatever gens are near them.  9/10 someone comes for the save while they still hear your heartbeat. 
---
That’s how people beat my SWF, we go down trying to save each other.  Sometimes we make it out and sometimes we all die together in the basement. 
---
That’s how I beat a lot of SWF when I’m playing killer.  You notice the saves are super coordinated? Like as soon as your turn your back or walk far enough away, boom save?  People bodyblocking coming out of no where.  You need to adjust your style of play somewhat, to them the person on the hook  is almost more important than gens. 
---
The problem is the lag-switch. It's a solid plan when you're at the exit, safe to get the killer to hit you to find out if they have NOED.
---
Infinite tier 3 isnt that bullshit tbh unless you have braindead teammates (which most of the time you have so fuck my point) 
---
Fuck the daily? You don't have to be toxic just because the game fucking asks you to do that, do you?
---
Really though. It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation for Killers, pretty much all the time. I switched from full survivor to mostly killer about 3 months ago wanting to be that "Nice Killer", and I've pretty much had all the niceness beaten out of me by the survivors.
---
I just don't even care about DCs anymore, and I'm so sick of farming. I just hook, get the game over with quickly and move on.
---
This is Fucking amazing
---
Good thing to do with After Care is running Self Care. You heal yourself up to 99% and then let a team mate you find heal you. You will get the perk activation. And if the Killer shows up before that, you just finish self-healing.
---
My God this subreddit is awesome 
---
HAVE AT 'HEM LAAAAADS
---
r/2meirl4meirl
---
😂😂
---
I heard that you can block the hatch by standing in a certain position ?
---
One of the hills in that map has a slight rocky slope you can slide on. It can act as a ramp.
---
&gt;Self care is like ruin for killers; Necessary (except for top tier killers)
---
Self care is a great way to waste time, especially since the recent slow healing changes. Nothing worse than knowing a teammate has done nothing all game cos they spend minutes at a time doing shit all.
---
Ruin is a turd of a perk that lasts like 20 seconds at most in high ranks. You're better off playing the rest of the match with a 4th perk than pretending that's significant just because everyone keeps parroting that it's "necessary" "needed" or "required" to play killer.
---
It really is tbh
---
I used to really hate dead hard because it was annoying how many survivors would get at least 1 free extra hit per game. Then I realised literally every survivor in red ranks runs it and just assume everyone does, and have had so much less issues because they all blow their load before I swing now.
---
Also there's legitimately nothing more fun than getting shittalked by survivors for using common tier Huntress add ons for exhausted because they can't use dead hard all game.
---
Once again I come to love your comic. You have amazing talent! I've read your comments. I love the idea of the killers being victims too. I like that you wont to show their tragic tale. It deserves a good interpretation and yours is great.
---
Little fangirl moment, Herman being low-key hot without the headgear gives me conflicting emotions as an original Nea main(i am maxing all survivors i have so far so not much Nea only any more) lol. I appreciate how you drew him. 
---
The Entity being a man is cool. Maybe if you want have him a different form with each interaction. Maybe even changing form mid panel? Only an idea, whatever you do is awesome. 
---
Keep up the great work and if your willing please keep up posted here. 
---
(X)
---
I finally played a killer match this past weekend. Been avoiding it because I know how difficult it can be. I got one kill, nearly got a second, but downed her literally at the exit, so she was able to crawl out quickly. I'm content with that for a first time.  
---
Playing killer is not easy, kudos to those who are mains.
---
The Spirit's fury toward her Father(?) consumed her when she died. So I'm not so sure her Killer form would be against continuous killing. If she had kept more of her personality I could see her not wanting to.
---
Yes, I'd protect that locker with my life aswell. 
---
Springfield and Ormond?!?! 
---
....no
---
The Entity slowly tortures It's Killers until they do It's bidding.
---
Honestly I don’t blame them legion is the shittiest killer to go against by far
---
Freddy is oP HHHHHHHH
---
If you hold shift and always gravitate around high walls, and get good at turning the camera to look at killer while running an unbroken line, you improve tenfold
---
Long tall walls and watching the killer's "red light"- these are your friends. You know those "fog" offerings? It's actually way more useful to good players to have as little of that as possible so y'all can see the killer's red light easily.
---
Low graphics = easier to see everything.
---
again; long tall walls if you're panicky, keep sprinting till you catch the killer's location (even via their red light)
---
I can't tell you the amount of times I see survivors starting off being hit trying to hide behind small debris with nothing to work with nearby.
---
There are a bunch of other tricks related to pallet conservation. A simple one would be if you are like 30% sure you're going to get hit at a pallet, run *straight* through it without dropping it. That speed boost you get from being hit sends you launching really far, and preserving pallets is a BIG deal, especially if you got good players in your lobby who know how to get the most out of them. (You can run some killers near indefinetly with some nasty RNG setups)
---
as a killer I'd often let presumably bad survivors run to shack pallet to try and stop me with it, only to hit them through it anyway and break it easy.
---
Dafuq I dont wait another day just to play after survivors made up rules. 
---
When you are so penny pinching that you dont use mori screenshot from offering burning screen but isntead you use screenshot of mori from loadout
---
Open your web-browser cache directory, arrange files by date and pick the one created at the time you were watching the video. It is 440 Kb, so you can easily find it. Add ".mp4" to the end of it's name and you're done.
---
Rank 1 players do this too so don’t worry about growing out of it. 
---
Thank you so much! I’m so happy you liked my art. Yes, definitely the Entity gonna change his form later. Also I’m the Doctor main and he’s my favorite killer in DBD :)
---
maybe make him fun to play against, and i won’t dc
---
Im actualy just commenting here so I can easily read it later on my home wihout having to scroll down for 30 minutes straight but I predict its a good comic
---
Then stay toxic and receive toxic messages. 
---
Killers that do not want to face a team. XD
---
He is too old for Freddy now
---
Lagswitching isn't hacking 
---
Michael life
---
What the fuck?? Legion requires pretty much no skill so his ability is pretty much 2D. Meanwhile Trapper, Wraith, Doc and Freddy all have much more that an experience player can use to their advantage.
---
Why should a Killer let everyone leave if there's a DC? A DC happens almost every game that's a lot of survivors you're gonna let go for free. You're not really playing the game at that point you're just farming. 
---
I am not a top tier killer but I play surv enough to know looping, etc. sometimes they get good and pull one over but I actually elongate my killer matches so we all earn more BP. most of my killers are lvl 1 so I only use the perk I think is most useful to me but I don't tunnel, camp, etc. If I see a two surv I go after the one I haven't got before (etc) sometimes I leave them slugged to not kill them right away. I also will not chase to hit mostly done gennies instead and then continue chase (scratch marks, blood, and noise do so much for tracking). There have been a few matches where I legit got owned but most of the time I just farm with them and let a few escape. I've done nurse, huntress, legion (my main), wraith I've done most non dlc ones those were my favorite right now it's insanely easy to play most of those and get a few k and minimum hooks. I don't see the point in getting 4k if I get that many bp usually I average 25k+ when I do get 4k I tend to get around 30K or more jsut from destroying pallets, gens, chase, etc.
---
I think you used the wrong tag. The one you are looking for is shitpost. 
---
3 traps by default? 8 traps max? 2 Traps by default I can understand or at least the ability to rearm traps because if you aren't using any bags, it will be annoying to rearm traps when you are carrying one already. If they make your suggestion happen (which will never), trappers will always use Iridescent Stone + Bloody Coil or Iridescent Stone + Honing Stone.
---
After Iridescent Stone, the fact that trapper needs to prep the map is one of his weakness. Once most of the map is trapped, there is little survivors can do to hold him in a chase.
---
About the automatic trapping. Not every trapper traps right under the pallet. At rank 1 most survivors know how to loop so trapping the loop is usually a good idea. 
---
There is a Hispanic Latino Survivor... Ace... Ace is from Argentina
---
Yeah it would be easier to find them but unless they are purposefully looking for them it won’t matter too much, as it is only meant to catch them in a chase
---
Correct 
---
Oh I am perfectly fine with that. I mean its your oppinion after all. I am completely fine with camping period. Its just the stupidest thing you csn do as a killer because good survivors will just genrush you. Tunneling is shitty, I think, but again: your oppinion. And I wouldnt use mori accept for toxic swf groups or because of a daily. And the legion thing: On mori/ds/all the other things there are usually 2 parties: killer mains and survivor mains +people who main both like me. But both killers and survivors usually say legion shouldnt be in the game. However you can of cause play as legion. I am not here to judge anyone for that. I and many more just think that the design of their power and the way bhvr advertised legion is just horseshit
---
You get the scape points if the killer dc's
---
It’s more fun when you see both player’s POV. It makes it look more cool 😃
---
Yeah, guess the difference is Monto isn’t a total sack of shit, lol
---
Any time!
---
Yeah, but people often look for traps during a trapper match. 
---
God you people are boring.
---
Those are some of the cleanest 360's I've ever seen AND on console!!!
---
Bloody Bravo.
---
Hag has all 10 traps on her at the start and gets them back automatically how is making trapper always have the ability to hold more than one trap a problem? And what is wrong with having the ability to use 2 add ons without being heavily hindered every other killer can do it.
---
I’ll admit automatic trapping is novel but just being able to would be helpful for people who want to trap pallets or windows and are new to playing him
---
They have got to be obsessed with this game if they’re this desperate to get unbanned and it’s really sad. 
---
I suppose they likely would but even so having the ability for people who aren’t good at trapping to be able to do it easier and quicker doesn’t hurt
---
"In terms of strenght", not skill. Doctor is above Legion imo in terms of skill. 
---
I had a teammate dc in almost every match last night. Not kill themselves, just disconnect as soon as the killer hit them or picked them up the first time. And I played for close to three hours. I think I had two matches without a rage quitter.
---
I let them scape too, unless they do pallet-blinding. In this case, they are totally dead.
---
What does a DS squad look like?
---
If you do the same thing for 6 blinks, you’re being predictable. Unless you run in an open area with no walls, nothing to break line of sight and nowhere to vault windows/pallets, Nurse chases are all mindgames. While other killers rely on you making mistakes (being out in the open, vaulting a window/pallet too close to the killer, being moonwalked at a T-wall, etc) the Nurse relies on reading and predicting you. I’ve beaten high level Nurses this way. 
---
It’s not a direct counter, absolutely not. If the Nurse just wins the mindgames against you there’s nothing you can do. But these are ways to beat Nurses
---
Ive been forced into playing freddy recently because even with ruin the gens are being done too fast.
---
*wink*
---
Well we don’t do it just because we’re nice...
---
If anyone fails to load into the match when I'm Killer I tend to outright DC unless people burned stuff like escape cakes or Streamers.
---
3v1's aren't fun for either side.
---
What’s worse is there’s a good amount of Leatherface on the front page.... of all killers..... why?
---
Honestly and this might be “toxic” as a survivor, I stopped getting mad at the game when I started trying to make each game I got into (as a survivor) the worst game for the killer that they have ever played. I’m not talking about saying anything toxic in the endgame chat, I mean pallet looping, flashlight blinding and saving, hook breaking kinda toxic. I honestly can’t get mad now because I know when I get camped or tunneled lol I deserve it. 
---
What survivors don’t get is that Ruin gets played so much (along with NOED) because generator rushing is so common.
---
All of them are better in terms of skill. Also, legion isn't that strong to begin with unlike Wraith who has great map pressure for example 
---
Until you get to post-chat and you’re informed that you’re “ruining the game, REEEEE!”
---
Someone's going to make a comment asking for the context sooner or later, so here you go:

---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/apsu5o/we_know_who_the_new_killer_is/
---
Do you mean Rank 1 Neas?
---
Absolutely. Doctor is one of the worst killers in the game, if we don't factor in Addons he is worse then Wraith. His tracking is terribly overrated, past the initial scream you will maybe find people a handful of times. Really the only good thing about his power is sometimes you can zap someone to interrupt an action at a critical point, but still the only follow up you got is to hit them.
---
He is either the third or second worst.

Nobody says they should or have to. Some killers just do it, and some survivors are just happy because of it. It's that simple.
---
This honestly works a surprising amount of time on PC because people have their sensitivity so high that their like zooming their view around 
---
* Trapper takes RNG and set up time
---
* Wraith has nothing to help him chase, really his power only helps him get close before beginning a chase
---
* Doc has nothing really *that* good except an interrupt which is meh at best.
---
* Freddy is the hottest of garbage, his power gets in the way and the trade off for it is lame and can't help you chase.
---
Best thread in a while. So many destroyed players in the comments.
---
Actually this situation is better than when somebody DC right away after missing DS. At least in the first scenario one gen is done already.
---
Do you honestly believe them? I have stopped doing so a long time ago, remember how hook spawns have a set distance between them ( 20 meters or something, not too big but not too small) but i have seen hooks that legit must be a lot closer, especially on the upper floor of the game.
---
I know I just think it's something no killer should consider doing. Just end the game so everyone can move on faster instead of wasting so much time farming. 
---
No. Legion at least can run people down pretty good and slow the game down with Deep Wounds.
---
If you think Wraith has map pressure I don't think you know what that means.
---
Sometimes if someone DCs (mid-game) I let the last guy escape.
---
True, if I don't get some aggressive crouches and head-nods I might stab someone on their way out
---
I'd rather get shit for doing the "mean" thing than get shit for doing the "nice" thing. So I might as well get the game over with.
---
I usually play normal until the 3rd hook. Then I dribble them so they can decide if they wanna farm or not
---
 &gt;the "screw you all" attitude can be considered toxic.
---
Anyone remember Grimmmz?
---
He was a killer main, and his catch phrase was "I don't give a fuck about anyone else's fun, your enjoyment is not my problem". He would face camp people and "farm salt", specifically trying to ruin someone's day so much that they would rage in the post game chat, and if they didn't rage, he and his viewers would be disappointed that there's a chance that the "bullied" person didn't hate their experience in that game.
---
Within a month of Grimmmz quitting, the killer community became way less toxic, as they no longer had one of the most popular killer mains in the game encouraging that "screw you all" attitude.
---
Many killer mains think that the entirety of toxicity in the DBD community starts and ends at the post game chat when that isn't the case. 
---
At least you do that cause most Killers just like to force survivors into farming. And keep in mind not all the survivors in the group want to farm if you see them on a gen leave them be. 
---
Either way, toxic is toxic. Doesnt matter how many people are being toxic, if you're toxic then youre toxic
---
To me it's more about the game having shitty rules and rebelling against those as 14 y.o. right? I hate all this "screw them all because one of them is a bastard" mentality
---
I don't remember if it's Mathieu or McLean who said that, but they said, if they made the Trapper now, he would definetly have way more default traps as now.
---
Trapper is bad mostly because he spends most of his early game trapping the map. Putting 0 pressure on the survivor, then it's a gamble, making them useless if no one loops in the area or if someone saw him putting the traps down. Giving him more default traps at start would help him for sure.
---
Lets be honest though. A match starting out as a 3v1 is a situation that shouldn't be happening.
---
Welcome to the club 
---
I have the opposite 
---
But... I thought leaving survivor to be on the gen is exactly what considered by "farming"
---
A Wraith as well. Good job 
---
He can preform well, in fact i think he is the killer that can most easily do better then he should (besides leatherface, who has a hidden AoE ability that lowers the I.Q. of every survivor on the map) because his addons can fuck with people and for some reason he is so demoralizing to survivors they often either give up or play on autopilot.
---
That's definitely a part of it for me too. I'm a killer goddammit! If i wan't to play a game where the point is to let others have fun it would be DnD and not DbD.
---
The Entity adjust the power of the killers to give hope to the survivors. In the first Alien vs Predator, the Predators don't have any gun, they looked for them, so it's easy to imagine them with only a spear, or the tail of an Alien as a weapon. 
---
K
---
You know it's frustrating when you expect to go against pro loopers with that perk and suddenly you keep getting early droppers left and right.
---
FACTS don’t care about your FEELINGS.
---
I mean, some hispanics are white complexioned.
---
But no, Jake has always read Asian to me, though his last name pushed me in the direction of "Korean." If that's really the case though, I'm not sure why Feng Min follows naming conventions but Jake Park doesnt.
---
Nah I just play as normal. Gets the game done faster and then everyone can get into a proper game. Not into farming/handing out free wins.
---
I expected some kind of a lag switch. I'm not disappointed and glad that I was wrong.
---
It might be the right moment to start using Urban Evasion and just drop the bravado when you're not doing well in a chase.
---
Just t-bag them and then look at the killer, if they nod then you cab live :D
---
Claudette looking like a bootleg barbie doll made in a Chinese factory. Also Bee killer petition when?
---
CHAPTER XI: Of Birds And Bees.
---
I ignore a lot of the rules other people make. "just don't be a dick" is pretty much how I play.
---
Both are the same kind of crutch endgame perks, if you think about it.
---
Okay, I felt that lmao. Was playing a game and a rank 4 Nea got downed by a Billy with his chainsaw and she INSTANTLY DC’d. I fucking couldn’t, it was too damn good but also annoying. 
---
I like Legion because it's easy to rack up the BP on them. As I've seen stated before me, they don't take a whole lot of skill and even though you would think they have anti-loop mechanics they can still get looped to hell and back by a half way decent survivor. 
---
I do think it's useful that when you use frenzy on one survivor you immediately get a clue to any nearby survivors, especially if you quickly down someone. It's not game changing, though. Mostly their abilities just make the game take longer but since mending is the easiest thing in the game next to opening a chest and cleansing a totem (no skill checks just m1) it's really not even all that useful. Plus another survivor can just mend for them which baffles me but doesn't seem to make it any faster, at least.
---
Legion has the best mori of the entire game IMO. Also a good portion of survivors will immediately DC when they realize it is a Legion so that's hilarious!
---
What would you want the power to be then? I just dont see them doing a good adaption that would do them justice.
---
I really like Leatherface. He's fun to play. And he has a cute voice.
---
&gt; aol.com
---
And also I still can't see this being real. I think they're taking the piss just to keep people talking.
---
So what happened between losing a gen and the end game chat?
---
I'll be in the minority saying that the devs who invented dying light have never seen a vagina.
---
The game just shouldn't happen if someone DC's really early. Just give the other survivors and the Killer a decent chunk of BP.
---
you really think a toxic survivor isn't gonna tell you to kill yourself without a swf team with them? swf got nothing to do with it
---
Default Ace.
---
Rogi Trapper.
---
This is the right answer.
---
Yep, unfortunately I don’t have them but I’ll definitely try it again when I do :)
---
Fair enough! The shirt and shorts are like, a carbon copy of the game so you deserve credit for that!
---
you’re making the match horrible for them too, but i don’t see you shittalking yourself
---
Yeah but what happens when he *does* find people? They run to safety and start a chase. He has mobility but he has nothing to actually *pressure* survivors, there is nothing to really fear from a Wraith. If he doesn't commit to his chases he can't get a hook and if he does he is gonna waste time because he has no tricks to help run people down.
---
I know this is a day old, but one of the differences between NOED and DS that I see, is that it’s mainly just “bad” killers who use NOED. I mean, more often then not if the killer is good then they’ll be running a different perk that will help them not get to the endgame in the first place or just a flex perk because they rarely ever get to the endgame with or without a helpful perk.

You say NOED is universal, but I’d argue there’s a pretty good difference between bad and good players who use it, it’s just that usually the good players don’t use it because they don’t often get the chance or don’t run it. DS on the other hand is a perk that you’d want to take either way, not going down is much more rare of a occurrence than not getting all the gens powered.
---
Most of the time, if a bad killer uses NOED then he might get one guy, maybe 2 if his teammates play recklessly trying to save him, but I could but play omegablink nurse with bitter murmur and NOED, afk until all gens are done, and still have a good chance at getting a 4K if I slug.
---
Did I explain that weird?
---
100% true 
---
because its op
---
Why don’t they just do a 30minute leavers penalty for DC’ing? And if they do it after that an hour cooldown ect for serial DC’ers.
---
right. im a rare breed of non-toxic survivor who defends killer mains when the other survuvors are being toxic in post game.
---
i always say gg wp regardless of game outcome
---
when i play killer and the survivors are teabagging and etc i don't get annoyed because i couldn't care less if they have an ego to stroke. I'll just hook them and continue on with the game. if i get destroyed by swf i say "you guys did awesome gj" because being polite &gt; being salty
---
I was playing Myers one time and I just picked up a survivor when someone to my left points a flashlight in my face and someone else throws a firecracker to my right.
---
I got the blind screen effect for a few seconds but I didn't drop the survivor. I don't really know what happened but none of the survivors commented on it and I forgot to ask them what happened. Oh well.
---
getting grabbed off a gen and hooked 3 times isn’t “interesting”. learn to mindgame and chase properly, that makes it interesting.
---
Still never watched him so I don't know lol
---
Are you newer to the game? When I was first starting  Doctor had just came out and I could barely last five minutes against him! Once I learned more, though, I realized he's a pretty terrible killer. You can still loop and vault even with the shocks, once you get better at skill checks the moving around isn't a problem, and as for screaming... move away from that area or pay attention to the madness meter and get in a locker. That or run calm spirit!
---
They already changed the description, it used to be a higher speed boost
---
It doesn't solve the issue, but it does reduce how easy it is. Right now because killer is host, if the killer does anything it fucks up all four connections. By making a dedicated server it's harder to get lag to fall in your favor.
---
using a mori isn't toxic, periodt. 
---
yes let me just mindgame the spirit that gives no indication of when they’re coming, where they’re coming from, where they’re going. good one.
---
Bill cosby and kids
---
I’m rank 2 on killer and I don’t agree, I’ll encounter the usual swf and I’ll be lucky to kill 1 of them but usually I can get a 3 or 4K just like in the early ranks
---
Okay. 
---
Too bad that's not a straw man, that's a wicker man, and you're Nicholas Cage.

Thanks &lt;3
---
This. Local wireless for DbD would be so cool.
---
that's exactly what i do. unfortunately they often dc because they think im gonna kill them lol
---
 Getting a 4k with the wraith is hard, but I pull it off pretty consistently :)
---
To be honest, it's annoying when this happens. You wait for 10-15 mins to get I to a game and then you realize that it's not a serious game

---
I'm a hard fan of Predators, so I don't really know much about their powers, I watched the movies, but didn't do in depth with them.
---
The Predator could build up his power over the course of the game, kinda like the first Alien vs Predator. You start with nothing or a simple spear that gives you extra range, then you can acquire the mask, giving you some aura reading ability. Maybe some trap nets to slow down the survivors or block them for an instant. 
---
I don't know, honestly I see a lot of potential with a killer using all kind of gadgets to help him in the game. I'd love a killer that has different small powers to help him, instead of one power. For example, I would love the Clown if he could switch to different bottles to apply different status depending on the situation. 
---
Thanks for all the help guys!
---
Entity: „I don‘t think so trololol“
---
Welcome, OP. As you can see, no one here has anything interest at all in a balance discussion. All of your points has are ignored and you just get called a baby.
---
And everyone is just lying so much. I play SWF a lot, because as a killer main I’m entitled to it after having to deal with game subverting practices all the time. And the people saying that they don’t use comms to do shit like track the killer or relay information on others surivors after death or tell the others where the totem is are fucking liars.
---
SWF will never go away. We can only hope that devs will balance around it in the future. But then survivors will scream and cry about how unfair it is that killers got buffed just like they do when any mechanics issue is fixed 
---
I think that's about the time I joined as well started on ps4 and now recently moved to pc so I'm starting over lol but I love the grind meg is my fav so I'm doing her teachables first 
---
I mean, its nice and all, but it doesn't work on smart survivors and whats the most it gives you? A hit. Still gotta run through all the pallets.
---
Well then sorry but you're delusional and there's no point in arguing with you since I clearly you haven't played any of them much
---
same. also as survivor i've had too many games where i get downed by noed on my way to the gate and died. it's part of the game, it sucks but it's idiotic to have different behaviour over a..... perk. i'm rank 1 killer every month, i get rid of ds as soon as i can. i just eat it and move on , and take it out of the way forever. it's not that hard. it's not like hes going very far... just wastes like 30 seconds if he's any good at chases. 30 seconds to get rid of ds forever? worth it. i rather that than having someone using it late game and exit. the amount of people affraid of ds is too damn high, you would be surprised how much more you'd accomplish if you start behaving the same way to a ds user than you would a regular player. dribbling takes way too much time, say you hook him twice, the amount of time wasting in dribbling could easily be 1 gen done if 2 people are working it.   
---
Holy shit, some of you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
I play exclusively killer. I have been rank 1 for 2 years. Trapper is my main and I play the others extensively. I only tell it like I see.
---
The hit boxes are definitely outrageous I got hit by a hatchet that landed nowhere near me total bs
---
I just wish they counted the DC's as kills towards achievements/trophies... I would had it by now, but people just DC when they get found first or when you get them near the exit gate. It's my last trophy towards the platinum but I'm just burned out a little of this game :/
---
It might be due to lower levels and me being new but all the Wraiths I've faced have got me except one, which I got very lucky at hatch. Still major kudos. 
---
Can we ban Ochido from real life?
---
&gt; SEE THE INVISIBLE
---
So Claudette?
---
Thats why i use pig cause even you do use ds you still shouldnt do gens
---
Theyve buffed killer/ nerfed survivor quite a lot over the last year. Along with the last three killers being pretty unfun to play against
---
Most of the issues are bugs/latency though, with luck they will eventually fix them, no one wants pallet vacumns back but being hit through everything isnt good either
---
 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
Well yeah but I typically say kill yourself to the person on the hook who cant hear me so I can get hatch. If the killer could hook themselves(which should so be an option) id think it to them to lol. 
---
Omfg... i dont defend it, i hate people who quit the game cause they want easy wins, play the game no matter who the killer or what addons they use, there is always a chance of winning
---
Hmm, I don't experience that much at all on console unless the ping is awful beforehand. Seems to have improved a lot since the last patch for me. 
---
Its just a hard line making it thrilling to play or too OP. Since we already have aura perks. Then it's hard too because being able to choose bottles for different stuff for the clown is too much since survivors dont have means to a secondary option to combat that. So they have to balance this around both sides and I dont think they would be able to make a fun way to play as predator.
---
One things I would mention thinking of Arnold S battling the predator. I would really like it if there was a secondary thing where survivors could set traps for killers too. That would make it interesting and drag out the game longer. Like in a jungle gym you could set up a trap that stuns the killer for a 2 seconds or something. It would break up the monotony.
---
I'm having more fun than I used to, personally. There are a lot more off-meta builds and perks that have given the game much greater variety for me.
---
I'm not a game dev and I'm just speculating but resetting your rank might have unintended consequences of covering up the cause of the bug so they're probably leaving your account the way it is until their team of bug fixers can dive into the code. I've never heard of this problem, and they might not have either. Your might well be unique and your problem definitely seems to be worth a deep dive into the issue in case there's a bug that negatively impacts their ability to roll out changes on mass to player accounts in other areas besides just rank.
---
My first game of ever playing Nurse was a 1v3 and I was trying so hard but I didn't even get one hook ): My blinks were horrible lol
---
Not in game though. Maybe in end game chat but mostly survivors are bad people.
---
Yeah I like to main Legion and it sucks because at least 1 will d/c if not more. I used to let them farm too so we all get bloodpoints but I just want to end the match asap it takes too and it's just straight boring. Worst part is I know I'm not a toxic killer I main surv so I don't do the things I hate seeing, like tunneling, camping, I even slug a surv to elongate the game and allow someone to pick them up so they get some more BP and don't have to sit out most of the game. I still get a ton of BP and a fun match I hope it is fun for them too since it wasn't over right away even if it's two people I just hooked sometimes I just walk away or same guy I caught on a genny I won't it's no fun to be constantly found. I just get tired of it though so I don't let anyone escape anymore all the time on a legion d/c so they just fuck over their teammates more when they had a chance. I don't run bbq and chili or ruin I don't have them anyway (well I bought ruin but idc for totems).
---
im trying to make any sense of this, why is he checking exit gates on the beggining of the match? was the ruin there? even if it is, incredibly stupid to go straight to the ruin location as a first killer move, thats how ruin totems get cleaned in a heart beat. 'oh the killer went to check the door? ruins there.' 
---
An interesting proposition. Just how much do you love me?
---
For example; I was recently playing Billy the [Wonderboy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACiA1TX0tvA) when I noticed the match taking an abnormally long amount of time to load. When at last I was deposited on my hunting grounds? Three disconnects.
---
I almost immediately found the survivor. We nodded at each other, and I went sprinting off to practice my chainsaw tree dodging while he worked on generators. 
---
In the end, we apologized to each other and understood the other's plight. For the rest of that evening, we became Survive-With-Friend pals, and saved each other throughout another six games. Do you love me that much?
---
Aww billy jumped over the car wall in auto haven landing behind a survivor healing.
---
Servant Class Berserker.
---
It *is* a joke.
---
The twelve year olds on this sub just don't have the ability to detect jokes yet.
---
Exception of scream 3 of course
---
That's just bbq though or the range of other aura perks. I dont see them implementing this in a way that would do the franchise justice. At that rate just make a new independent killer that has aura reading no need for them to pay royalties.
---
The gen has a good amount of progress on it, so the leatherface probably concluded that somebody was hiding close by.
---
If your definition of "asshole" is trying hard to win, then sure
---
For a 14” monitor yeah you can make a good estimate, but you dont understand how many trees I’ve clipped because I play on a 46” and I’m just half an inch to the left or right.

---
I love stuntman Billy clips. They always impress me.
---
Big*
---
You need to press the crouch button SUPER hard, or otherwise it's useless.
---
Same reason I am the god of gens. Over my year of playing dbd I have perfected holding down that M1. 
---
They've balanced the game. It wasn't just random ass buffs/nerfs. They have legitimate game play reasons attached.
---
The healing thing? Because Self Care was too meta and the game was too fast.
---
Vault speeds were changed because survivors shouldn't be able to always get a fast vault no matter what. It made mind gaming at L T Walls pointless. And the momentum was changed so that survivors keep it after fast vaulting
---
etc
---
Lmao git güd salmon you weren’t hiding obvs. Are you telling me you’ve never magically been found despite all odds? I was on the far edge of a Macmillan map behind a brick wall in Feng’s darkest outfit motionless. It was truly one of my most unfortunate moments in this game.

Ever since devs buffed survivors so that they maintain their momentum after a fast vault window hits have been happening much, much less. It's very noticeable 
---
Because those Games are cherrypicked
---
Makes sense considering as killer it's really easy to counter 360's for me. It probably is worth it to try for a last resort though :/
---
Yup
---
**UwU Mr Entity-chan**
---
Whats UE?
---
&gt; These changes removed a lot of the challenge of playing killer that I loved.

A lot of those things are not actual challenges tho they were just plain fucking broken and goddam insane

Also there is still at least one infinite still

I always message killers with a lil heart after the game when they do this.

Yup, I got lucky for my 4 mori achievement since I hadn't played for a long time and it was rank 20...

Nothing youve said disagrees with what i said 
---
Oh christ no, I just found it a weird coincidence
---
Personally I go for yoinks after stealth and if I don’t get it I’ll just m1 and continue the chase. Typically I’ll end up with 3-4k deviousness points with a 3k, so unless you constantly ambush idk how you get that many points.
---
Urban evasion
---
equally funny cheese joke right here give me likes so i can validate myself thanks
---
Knockout, Barbeque, Franklin's
---
I have my Leatherface at level 42 (skipped Franklin's the first time to grab a different perk. Also leveled him once during an event since I needed to play him for a daily) and basically never touch him. Franklin's is totally worth but Leatherbilly as a Killer is awful and needs a rework.
---
Survivors will always be considered overpowered as long as there is a chance they'll be able survive the trial. That's the general consensus of the killer community. 
---
Solo survivor is absolutely not fun or engaging anymore. SWF hasn't changed, it's still more fun and you actually have a chance of escaping the trial. 
---
But the common echo chamber complaints abouts killer ("stress", looping, every perk, teabagging, totems, having to try, etc) will all drown out any concerns from the survivor side. To have fun, I recommend SWF, or just playing a match or two a night and moving on to a different game.
---
Of course some window and pallet hits should absolutely hit but there’s also just as many times they technically shouldn’t.
---
I was saying using a flashlight now is incredibly hard because you have to them them perfectly with a 2 second charge to zero it in on pick ups. With hag and spirit it’s a bit more difficult because their heads aren’t extactly registered where their heads should be, window or pallet blinding them is quite difficult too.
---
Frame rate deaths in corn must mean you’re on a lower end rig, probably why you miss so much if you have frame rate issues too
---
Personally I go for yoinks after stealth and if I don’t get it I’ll just m1 and continue the chase. Typically I’ll end up with 3-4k deviousness points with a 3k. 
---
What you need is Discordance and surveillance
---
Run it with overcharge and brutal strength 
---
I’ve tried this set up with the trapper and man you get so much map control when you use it right 
---
That's a skin for jeff tho now jeff can be 2 characters too! ^^^jk
---
Good on ya for not being a vindictive asshole from any angle. It feels surprisingly rare in this game.
---
Just by you logging on and participating in games, some power is taken away from toxicity and I think thats pretty cool.
---
All killers are good, but this one is the beest.
---
I constantly ambush. I use it on short loops or to confuse people around L walls. It can also force people to use DH
---
From a killer main, some of the easiest escapes as a survivor is dashing until you can line of sight a killer, and then playing around it. I dont know how many chases i have dropped because a survivor used a tree to escape me. Especially when its adam francis and that damn rock lol.
---
My Bubba is level 35 too. Got Franklin’s from the Shrine ages ago, so I never needed to go higher. 
---
BBQ and Chili: Best tracking perk in the game - double Bloodpoints for doing what you'd do every game
---
We're Gonna Live Forever: Does nothing in game - double Bloodpoints for going out of your way to purposefully take damage and unhook people
---
WGLF really needs at least *some* sort of secondary effect. Moving faster when near allies would be kinda neato.
---
Okay. I'm just bothered because people will inherently treat buffs/nerfs as a bias by devs or something negative being done to either side. The game is the most balanced it's ever been right now
---
But from your comment:
---
&gt; Along with the last three killers being pretty unfun to play against
---
Spirit is not unfun to play against and Clown is like the definition of neutral 
---
Thanks I hate it
---
&gt; Of course some window and pallet hits should absolutely hit but there’s also just as many times they technically shouldn’t.
---
Just as many? No. The majority of window hits are fine. Again, this is a latency issue when it happens. Hit boxes are seriously fine. I really don't understand why people don't get that difference 
---
&gt; I was saying using a flashlight now is incredibly hard because you have to them them perfectly with a 2 second charge to zero it in on pick ups, to late or to early it does nothing. With hag and spirit it’s a bit more difficult because their heads aren’t extactly registered where their heads should be, window or pallet blinding them is quite difficult too.
---
Oh please. This is just whining that blinds aren't served up on a silver platter
---
&gt; Frame rate deaths in corn must mean you’re on a lower end rig, probably why you miss so much if you have frame rate issues too
---
Considering this is one of the most common complaints from killers and high profile streamers who do this for a living have mentioned it being an issue, I'm going to say it's pretty universally an actual issue
---
Leatherface is better than trapper, Freddy, and bingbongboy.   
---
you're pathetic because you cheat, are you daft?
---
Equipping Franklin's and bopping someone with a instaheal health kit is a top feel
---
Spirit is literally the guessing game killer. I dont find it fun just relying on luck to avoid her if shes good. 
---
This is ignoring the ridiculous prayer beads add on and zooming away zooming back to tunnel method you see 90% of spirits run
---
Clown is meh to me but like doctor hes annoying to go against cause of how much he distorts your vision.
---
Regardless the last "fun" killer that actually shook up the game for survivors was huntress. Everything else has added a gimic, been more of the same or killers that ignore core gane mechanics
---
I play both sides and fully agree. As I already said, my eyes are super bad and what you said works 9/10 times against me (unless they are injured, contrary to my eyeseight my hearing is actually pretty good)
---
In my opinion, things are only really toxic when your specifically doing it to make someone have a worse experience.
---
So while a mori could be used in a somewhat toxic way (I.e tunnel one player, hard face camp them, slug them until their 2 seconds from bleed out while staring at them, then green mori right at the end), I don't think it's necessarily toxic for them to just equip an offering to do a daily or win more efficiently. In the same way, I don't think BNPs and stuff like that on killer side is toxic.
---
Wonderful
---
That’s not how you should play pig though. If you’re chasing someone with a trap on their head you aren’t using her power correctly. Survivors with traps on their heads are 90% of the time not going to be doing gens, which means you’re putting pressure on the gens and its slowing down the game.  The only time you should chase a survivor with a trap on their head is when there are no better options (like when the gates are open). 
---
And the buff you suggested (while lore fitting) is way to strong.  It massively increases the lethality of the traps which isn’t the point of them. 
---
Because a killers first person perspective is their biggest weakness compared to a survivors’ 3rd person perspective. It’s why they get a perk to widen their field of view.
---
(Several people are typing)
---
(TydeTyme would like to know your location)
---
I generally think pretty highly of leatherface compared to most people, but he really suffers when you go against top flight survivors as he can't apply much map pressure and has basically zero anti-looping tools. Of course, that's true for every killer in the game besides nurse and to a lesser extent Billy and premium add-ons spirit. 
---
Except one you can literally negate in 50 seconds split between 4 individuals and the other can extend chases by minutes and be taken by 4 people... sounds the same to me.
---
“I WANT DEDICATED SERVERS” “okay they’ll be out this year” “good.....BUT I WANT IT NOW”
---
&gt; Survivors will always be considered overpowered as long as there is a chance they'll be able survive the trial. That's the general consensus of the killer community. 
---
Yeah because survivors never whine about anything amirite. I almost never see survivors blame their own incompetence for losing. It's always someone else's fault
---
&gt; Solo survivor is absolutely not fun or engaging anymore. SWF hasn't changed, it's still more fun and you actually have a chance of escaping the trial. 
---
I mostly play solo and I get out more than I die. Just get better. That's the advice killers who don't like SWF always get.
---
&gt; But the common echo chamber complaints about killer ("stress", looping, every perk, teabagging, totems, having to try, etc)
---
Let's not act like totems are not a legit complaint. Come on. And it's just true that killer is more stressful. If you don't like that pressure then you probably should play survivor instead. But it's just a fact.
---
And survivor complaints are the ones drowning everything else out. ffs it caused Freddy to get a totally unneeded nerf 
---
Just beecause
---
Use they?  For they are many. 
---
A beautiful woman cosplaying a beautiful character, well done!
---
And HERE lies the problem with this game. Most players don't start out toxic, they *become* toxic after people are mean to them too many times and they get fed up. I hear the same defense on both sides of the fence and the reality is the only way to combat it is to be nice in spite of it all. To shame the toxic people for ruining a game for everyone else. 
---
Personally I LOVE having a good time with the killer. An exciting chase is super fun. Of course I want to escape at the end but my personal goal is that at least one person escapes. 
---
But I get that it all can wear down on you. I had another survivor body block me the other day so that they could escape. I had to stop playing and go play some minecraft for awhile to cool off.
---
Reaches rank 10: “kys ez baby killer” 
---
Okay, so I guess you're personal preferences are universal, eh? Most people think Spirit is fun to play against
---
&gt;  I dont find it fun just relying on luck to avoid her if shes good.
---
Someone is good at the game? Well this is just not right.
---
&gt; Clown is meh to me but like doctor hes annoying to go against cause of how much he distorts your vision.
---
Literally two of the weakest killers in the game. And battling against madness is fun. It's so weird how whenever a killer wants to talk about SWF people flock in to be like "you have to just embrace the challenge!" but this never applies to survivor whining.
---
And then you call the killer a camper for defending the hook against your 3 altruistic friends with flashlights.... sound s about right
---
This. It is a bit jarring to look around first person when you are slightly larger than the survivors. Unless they are just obvious one can be on top of say a Claudette and never know. 
---
“Secret” my ass. They really need to make those hook offerings secret so there’s something slightly worth using other than a mori.
---
I know some Survivors don't like to be let go, but considering how 90% of the games played are real ones where everyone is trying,  the occasional farm/friendly game just breaks up the monotony for me. As long as it's not a killer who demands we farm every pallet and totem. 
---
Also, word to friendly killers: it makes me socially uncomfortable when you stare at me while I finish gens. If you don't mind it would be nice if you looked away or went on a small walk.
---
idk that it's the *most* easily countered perk, sure, if you're actually close to a locker....
---
OP, how do you feel about Farm tiles being see through? That's a huge issue for killers that isn't attached to latency like almost everything in your complaint.
---
Actually it was funny
---
Hmmm idea forming 
---
That’s a pretty common place to hide for survivors that are less good at chasing. I always check that exact spot op was in if that gen is being done and 6/10 someone is there.
---
&gt;Also looking back, it looks like you said Spirit breaks game mechanics?
---
I meant Legion in that statement. Really though spirits problem is lack of real counter apart from run iron will or get lucky. I dont think shes broken or anything just not very fun
---
&gt;You're probably whining that they happened to find you as you were searching boxes. That's not tunneling
---
I mean I dont really whine about anything anymore, there are plenty of dumb tunneling pigs out there which waste there whole ability though
---
&gt;Have you seen the way survivors here are? Someone made a post about SWF yesterday where he made actual points and almost every comment was just "lol ur a baby"
---
&gt;fucking please. Double standards everywhere
---
&gt;And all of your complaints are petulant whining because you don't like that the game is designed to be optimal fun for originalzumbie
---
 ha what Thanks for the laugh anyway you seem really angry over this for whatever reason. I dont know what the people in that other thread said, im not them. Im not sure where im whining but okay
---
&gt;lol ur ignoring this so hard
---
Ignoring what? Im talking about fun not a challenge, swf is such a massive point anyway. What specifically? Comms? Perks? I dont mind swf because they generally are stupidly altruistic, one of them is generally an idiot with a flashlight trying to do a montage and one is the gen monkey getting carried every game. I honestly play killer 90% of the time because i find survivor boring and way to reliant on dumb random teamates. Thats just me though I know plenty of people love survivor.
---
Well, in Jake's backstory, it talks about his brother going to Yale (in Connecticut, US, for people who aren't from the US,) and about how he had no interest in "Fortune 500" companies (which is a ranking of the 500 largest US corporations,) which implies he was from the USA.
---
Feng Min's bio mentions her playing frequently at internet cafes, and being part of a "one-child family," which implies to me that she's Chinese (as does the family name "Feng.")

So there's nothing that explicitly says, "Yes, Min is Chinese while Jake is Asian-American," but it makes sense to me that Jake would follow American naming traditions &amp; Min would follow Chinese naming traditions.
---
The last line.
---
With the state for the internet these days, I try not to assume gender of players, I would usually use the gender for the in game character, but even so I would probably get some white Knight yelling at me in the comments
---
urban evasion, one of the worst perks in game
---
Rank 1 on PS4. 
---
You can't charge around longer loops, so don't bother, but you can easily mind game short loops. Something I like doing is is crouching at T-L walls to confuse them, then charging at them. Not every charge I do is necessary, but it can really shorten certain loops. 
---
Try going one way then quickly switching directions. It catches a lot of people off guard since you can turn faster than them.

Fate series fans rise!

You’re just bad. Doctor is easy as fuck
---
I just realized DBD cosplays are probably the easiest to get right! Halloween here I come
---
Why is this top page? I have seen and have done this so many times. This exact thing has been top page before and I know it
---
You repair slower with someone else
---
Definite lag switch
---
Interesting strategy... Come to this thread just to be toxic... sad
---
Could use some boots but other than that it's pretty good. :)
---
That's suppose to be feng and the spirit? Honestly coulda been anyone else. It's still a great drawing it's just looks nothing like them. 
---
A little suspect that the op, person who said "source op?" And then the guy commenting the link all have accounts less than 10days old,  and all post to r/aww for easy karma.
---
Definitely a scam or similar
---
Man this is just full truth. The one thing I take issue with is
---
&gt; Also the hatch exists, which punishes a killer for doing good.
---
I think the last player should have a way to escape. It just would not be possible without the hatch.
---
What is wrong with the hatch is the key. It's not okay for multiple people to be able to escape at once without gens being completed and it's hilarious how survivors who always scream about nurse and legion and doctor and game play mechanics just have no issue with it. gee I wonder why
---
I just realized DBD cosplays are the easiest to get right! brb buying a nosejob and bulking up a bit more to play David
---
This one streamer I played with the other day might have been one of the worst players ever. Both times he was unhooked, he'd stay at the hook to heal using his Self-Care, which takes ages, and the Nurse would just teleport over there and down him again.  
---
Just before he could get his last hook he rage-quit, and I was just in shock at how awful he was. For all I know he could have been purposely deranking, but people who do that are also absolutely terrible players, so it's not like there's a difference or that it matters.  
---
I got the hatch though, so gg.
---
but i thought the whole point of repairing a gen with someone is that it goes faster than doing it alone
---
I’m not the one complaining about not being able to use decisive strike...
---
That's how it's supposed to work. You do gens at 100% speed. If someone joins you on a gen, you both do 90% repair speed, for a total of 180% repair speed with two survivors 
---
Always when you repair at the same time with another survivor your individual repair speed is lower, the devs have only made it visible recently, but always (or almost always) this has been in the game
---
Woah never seen this before
---
You seem to have misspelled best 
---
I found myself in this exact same spot hiding from a Bubba except he was standing in that snow. Either he was blind as a bat or Claudette truly is invisible.
---
understandable xD sadly
---
Queen Kate, Meg could NEVER 
---
It varies between survivors, but I usually mean non invasive fun. Stuff like nodding when corner trapped by Billy, knowing you've been caught and goofing off, things like that. Definitely not throwing the match for a meme.
---
What's the p51 that bombs that tiger tank a few seconds later in this meme 
---
Yep. A Legion last night
---
WHAT!?   
---
And here I've been wishing I could rotate my character for this whole time...  
---
FML.   
---
Thank you xXWraithXx4
---
That potential is worth more than a perk with certain benefits that doesn't directly slow down the game
---
Honestly, i only use it for extra blood points now. Or on a killer no one would expect would have it.
---
I'm not aggressive at all. I'm at work calm as can be actually. You're just projecting your own insecurities onto my words
---
The blue clothing helped you blend in.
---
And people say cosmetics have no effect on gameplay.
---
Once had a claudette hiding in the corner of a jungle gym, she popped a gen right beside so I knew she was there, I almost thought she left but I did end up seeing her, I got her on the hook, before she DC'd after I nodded but my BBQ  showed another claudette hiding just far enough away for me to see her, she DC'd claimed I was hacking, told her to look at my perks (this is pre hidden killer perks) and she told me that "BBQ chili is just a crutch perk!" she had adrenaline, self care, DS(she wasn't the obsession), and Deliverance, but it was clearly I who was using crutch perks, BBQ, Deerstalker, Brutal Strength, &amp; Overcharge. 
---
Nature deserves my pen's work
---
F
---
99% of cases where I am accused of tunneling is because I'm running back to the hook just in time to see someone who is full health unhook someone and they run in opposite directions leaving me to choose to either chase the uninjured guy or the injured guy.  Considering how much effort it takes your average non-nurse killer to make a survivor injured in the first place, the choice is clear.  Take care of the injured one before he heals up and you have to hit him twice to get him back on the hook.
---
:D
---
Oh please. That wasn't hostile. It was dismissive
---
Except innately killers can't, not have ever been, considered overpowered. At least from my own experience on this subreddit. Perhaps your reddit shows different threads than mine does every day, and I'd be willing to change my generalizations should they prove to be false.
---
ill try my best, man
---
the Feng ended up staying behind during our quick escape for some reason and got caught, unfortunately 
---
Lol mkay dude. I just find him OP. Opinion. No need for toxicity
---
I wouldn't worry about it, he's just a violent duckling
---
Wait it’s a lag switch?
---
Same can be said for lots of perks or addons in the game....Looking at Dying Light and Make Your Choice(makes you come back to the hook).  
---
Thank you for replying and not yelling lol. I anticipated yelling after posting that.
---
Yeah I see what you mean. I think killers are in a way better spot then where they were when I first opened this game and 8-10 mins per game should be enough. It would get annoying after 10 mins. I think there are some super powerful add ons for killers too, but typically ppl dont always run those. Like the first time I 4kd in a few mins with insta hatchets. I was like 'oooh I feel bad for these people' and quit running it. That's what I found so fun about killer though was outplaying survivors perks. Like baiting a dead hard or nurses calling beats self care for sure. DS has always been talked about on here but I always just ate it as quick as I could in the game so it was gone.
---
I disagree with hatch though. I typically give the person who played best the hatch. Then at the end of the game it creates makes it a time crunch. I enjoyed the stress of having to outplay people. I think a lot of people dont enjoy that part. I think that's why I enjoyed killer more back on the day.
---
Thank you for your reply though. I appreciate seeing your opinions on it.
---
I got called a cheater for playing Freddy with one of his red add ons that show survivor auras when you put one into dream state. Saw the second to last survivor get into a locker and hooked him.
---
Man, you guys can only imagine what salt I got in my PMs from him. He was so convinced I cheated because “you had no idea which locker I was in! Reported faggot hack0r”
---
It was only once I sent him a screenshot of my add on that the messages stopped coming in.
---
Just something for people to complain about, like most things in the game.  There is literally someone out there to complain about every single thing in the game
---
I like the stress of it and I think a lot of people hate that. I loved the adrenaline back and forth of the chases and downs. I loved it being fast paced. It made 4ks so much more rewarding.
---
Which infinite are you referring to?
---
Must P R O T E C C.
---
Is that a bandana shirt?
---
ITS SO CUUUuuUUUUUTE
---
Bee-st killer
---
I play on Xbox, so my default attitude is non-shit-talkative.  I just solo smash as survivor, and take my winnings to the next game.
---
Here we see a Feng in its native environment. 
---
Fuck this shit
---
When this happens to me I spend the first 60 seconds in a locker 
---
You need to reset your awareness and speed, slow things down a bit and chillin' in a locker helps do that
---
Trust me, take a second and do nothing in that locker and try walking around instead of sprinting everywhere until someone else is getting chased or you see th ekiller leave the gen you're near.
---
First thing he's gonna do is check all gens til he find a guy, just wait til that happens or until he find your gen empty
---
Yep! with some strings so I can wrap it as a top
---
RNG?
---
You wear the EXACT same clothes as me. This is freaky.
---
That’s pretty good! Good job, I’d never think of something like that.
---
I just had 2 people crawl-race up the basement stairs, and I let the winner get the hatch.
---
What's the new surv perk?
---
Dead Hard is pretty manageable. 90% of players that use it can't help but constantly look behind them, giving away that they're about to use it. And once they use it once you can play around it, it's highly latency-dependent, etc. For all the times you feel it "robs" you as a killer, trust me I've been robbed plenty of times as a survivor as I lie dying on the ground somehow exhausted without DH going off. It's very satisfying to use it correctly as a survivor and I feel it's too much of a skill and reaction-based perk to nerf.
---
Self Care is a boon to a lot of killers if they're fucking off to a corner and constantly avoiding their team/gens. Use Sloppy Butcher/mangled add-ons if you want to really punish anyone for running it.
---
good to know, thank you!
---
My friend who is new to DBD pointed out to me the other day that there is almost no gore entirely, which was a weird realization 
---
Bitter Murmur 
---
Looks like a cookie
---
I know how to mind game with the ambush, its one of the reasons I play Pig.  My problem is that survivors know I’m going to, so they just run to a different loop making ambush mind games difficult as the survivors don’t stay at one loop long enough to do so.  
---
The only reason I’m not higher rank is that my pc can’t handle most of the maps.  At ~10 fps survivors are extremely difficult to hit.  I probably would’ve hit rank 1 last month had the event been at the beginning of it.  
---
The next killer!
---
I'm not even a console player. How do y'all even bear that shit? 
---
It's when you intentionally force yourself to lag in order to gain an advantage. Usually results in teleporting, unrealistic range on attack, etc.
---
 (https://youtu.be/NfYDNcWqFqU)[example I recorded]
---
definitely looks better than her in game 
---
Do you have a Twitter or deviant account? 
---
Lockers now hide auras. So you can just hop in a locker once you see someone get picked up and then wait till 5 seconds after the hook and you’re golden. 
---
I uhhhhhhhhhhhh i have a deviantart i never use but i guess I could start posting on it more often
---
You gotta learn to play around the bad frames, swinging when you’re closer so a survivor, not taking too many risks when looking as survivor. If you don’t play extra safe, frames, lag, and hit boxes will get you.
---
My friend and I have talked about how camping right next to the hook should make the progress bar completely stop until the killer gets a certain distance away. Like it should speed up the farther away he is. So that it would tell killers like, “hey this guy isn’t gonna die unless you leave...”
---
Basically this. Some killers just have no chance in cornfields unless you’re wearing blinkers.
---
I dont remember the name but it hides your aura when any killer perk of showing auras activate
---
Murder, that's called murder
---
Yes you can, It's illegal though so don't get caught
---
The game is killer sided for non swf at all but the highest ranks
---
Well, they hack at the Survivors with a knife and then find you, so you are more or less correct. 
---
This sounds dumb typing it now, but I play Michael and never use as I just have EW 3... I just try to use perks that slow down the game like dying light and ruin.
---
This is true. Just pointing out that 99.9% of the time you wont be completely covered and you can be seen. 
---
I have too many problems with this take. The Doctor is fucked up in the head, he isn't as serious and calm as he looks here. I'm almost certain the Nurse can't speak. The Entity certainly doesn't look like a man, why would it? It can exist without form and still be allmighty.
---
The killers are twisted souls born of evil and forged by violence, to the point that they enter the fog and obey the entity like trained hounds. They 100% don't go back home and talk about their day at work like roomies. 
---
Sorry to be THAT guy, I don't mean to disrespect your art, but I can't keep from speaking up when I see poorly written fanfic or lore re-imagining that a 12 year old who watched too much anime would do. It's a nono for me.
---
More proof NO MITHER is best perk
---
they should just give hex totems overcharge or BNP style Skill Checks and i think that would be a good enough balance or make all hex totems take as long as TOTH totems do...i dunno but obviously they can't find a good balance on totem locations
---
I'd love new killers to bring him up and he just slowly turns his head to give them a long, chilly stare.
---
It wouldn't be that strong, but he should get bloodlust. Vanity Mirror should also be buffed. There's no reason Myers has to have a cool strategy/playstyle that is so heavily hindered. 
---
Who camps as Freddy? Freddy is by far the worst camper in the game, literally can’t touch them for 7 seconds. Freddy’s I see tunnel, but certain not much camping.
---
I do agree with you on the DCs and complaining.
---
However, I actuqlly like playing against any killer. I just go in with different expectations on how well I want to do and how nervous I'll end up (ranging from, I dunno... doctor (I guess) to scratched mirror Myers). If I can pull out a few big moves against an overwhelming killer, that's plenty.
---
i agree
---
Our love for the game is too strong, so we keep trucking. 
---
Blocks are actually his worst addons.
---
Ugh this would make me so mad. Fuck this perk.
---
No scratch marks when running up stairs
---
me and my friend use diversion for end game, as soon as the gates are powered i will wait in between where the gates are and if my friend hears killer coming i throw rock at other gate and it lets him finish opening his gate :)
---
well getting the survivors in the dream world is key and keeping them there.  Dont really need to camp for that, but a lot of killers can camp, but hey whatever floats their boat.  Freddy is pretty good in chases, that short height of his has a advantage that few take advantage of
---
i read something on this subreddit about how order of addons matter so if you had the charge addon equipped before the styptic agent it would half the charges of the med kit + addon ,, but if you had the styptic agent first it would half the base charges and then add on 8 . not sure if its correct 
---
i do not do this if someone is at the gate i would throw rock at, but this technique has earned us both a victory numerous times when it was just me and him as the last two survivors trying to get a gate open
---
Tbh, Myers should have a speed buff with those add-ons. No speed lowered with vanity mirror and boosted speed for scratched mirror. This would make it viable in any map, not just memorial institute.
---
Legion without using the Bloodhound, Frank's or Tunneling is pretty weak if the survivors do Gens.
---
"Wow that sounds generic."
---
Legion can't pressure when everyone splits up. That ruins spreading deep wounds. Legion then has to chase people down and when you do it without Frank's you have the run up cancel frenzy to M1 option or the munch longer stab them 4 times in Frenzy wasting more time.
---
I love nea, so cute 
---
How did you do this?
---
go for range extenders and action slow down addons, those are the best as Freddy default range is kind of lack luster.
---
How are they even expecting to win that lawsuit ?
---
Like usual BBQ and Chili as well as Hex: Ruin are good.
---
Other good perks are:
---
-Monitor &amp; Abuse, since his terror radius (not his lullaby) is actually pretty small and your aura reading for sleeping survivors is tied to the terror radius.
---
-Discordance, since his power is best used on multiple people at once.
---
-Endgame perks like Bloodwarden, No one escapes death and Remember Me to be able to threaten people when the gates are open even when they are not already asleep.
---
I mean you could probably try on Mount Ormond
---
I'm a weirdo so I often avoid blocks. I tend to be a video game hoarder who doesn't use add-ons much so this contributes to it. 
---
But playing without blocks or pill bottle lets you learn the exact timing of the dream transition which can lead to some very fun mindgames. Although this is more an advanced Freddy thing other people are already covering builds so I'll drop this here for some food for thought: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rTtr7pUe-Q
---
You'd be surprised how many people fall for transition mindgames even at high ranks.
---
Don’t repost pls
---
He have to be hiding near the gen for it to work tho. Unless it's a last gen
---
This is just normal lag, if switching is used all things willl freeze, actions impossible, could be a switch but probs just some bad lag
---
Anon must be a nurse main
---
&gt; and that he was just playing a meme build where he didn’t tier up at all just to flex on how good of a killer he was lol.
---
I actually do this. I don't generally care for Michael as a killer so I don't spend BP on him but I love jump scare Michael so I'll do that on occasion. Those games don't go so great a lot
---
Just browsing through old comments and saw this one and wanted to respond. Yes it is, end of story. Have a good day..  if you want.
---
I hate how hard the achievement is. And too many people dc if you try at a high rank.
---
Side effect of how it is coded to interact maybe? I mean, I get it for healing, but the rest is a little odd
---
they'd be pissed to find dead by daylight, you know, that shitty survival game that i heard some people talking about?
---
how DARE you insult my boy!
---
Luckily, on Xbox, I've turned off the ability to receive messages from anyone that's not on my Friends List. All they can do is scream in silence, lol.
---
Pretty much. You could also use the term artificial skill.
---
T H I C C
---
Yes, this game about forced murder or survival is surprisingly tame.
---
 How do they do stuff like this when it’s obvious the devs are lazy morons and it’s gonna fun like shit, not like anyway really cares about this laggy ass broken game other then the core following it has, devs made sure of that
---
Had this happen, but also had an unused deliverence. So shoutout the trying to get the unhooking yourself achievement and running that perk for once in my life lol
---
#oh god oh fuck
---
According to the game, Freddy can see your bald head through your hair in the Dream World
---
I love streaming this game cause I'm hilariously bad at it.  I rage, I lose my cool and swear (ya'll seen my FUCKING BITCH clip),  people come in and make fun of me.
---
It's glorious.  
---
&gt;
---
Except innately killers can't, nor have ever been, considered overpowered or even strong. 
---
This is just as much of a tautology as the first post I responded to. People definitely consider some killers strong or overpowered. Am I just misreading this because I haven't had morning coffee yet? Bit confused here.
---
&gt;Perhaps your reddit shows different threads than mine does every day, and I'd be willing to change my generalizations should they prove to be false.
---
This whole thread is about how the game has supposedly been consistently updated to purposefully favor killers, even though it's a byproduct of bad hitboxes/programming in this case as opposed to a balance decision to buff killers. And I tend to see more of these dramatics than whatever threads you say you look at daily. I appreciate the jab though, it's entirely possible we do look at different threads since I don't look at all of them!
---
Regardless your first statement about the "general consensus of the killer community" is pretty inaccurate, melodramatic and derogatory for no real reason. Most players don't want an easy 4k spoonfed to them the same way most players don't want to just do gens and leave with no interaction. Certainly not enough to claim it's the community's consensus on the issue.
---
Even though I normally sit around rank 1, I usually dislike playing at rank reset just because everyone gets real sweaty. I usually wait around a week and then start playing again, plus I get the added bonus of playing with actual rank 10s
---
Are you a new player? Doctor is a Killer that gives most new Survivors a difficult time, but as you get better, you’ll realize that he is a mid tier Killer at best. He’s really easy to loop because he doesn’t really have anything to catch you. His shock stun does not work at all pallet and vault locations. Crouching slows the Madness gain by I think 50% and lockers prevent you from screaming. I think you can still gain Madness while in them, but you will not tier up. 
---
Also I would like to add that other maps I play on are completely fine. Also I got Ormond Resort 3 times in a row last night! SO ANNOYING
---
I got camped by one when I flashlight saved someone when I was not sleeping lol

---
Even the doctor looked it like thinking what the fuck 
---
^^^
---
You're not the only one who's blind haha i manage to lose a survivor when i hit them and they go on a different direction
---
If they really wanted to meme they would've at least gave me hints like tea bagging constantly and not even trying to loop but nope all they did was loop me for a few seconds and ate the chain
---
This is the context btw:

---
I'm a relatively new killer player, only been playing for about a week. I think out of the dozen or so times I've been DS'd they might have gotten away maybe 1-2 times. Sure it's annoying but I find it much more fair to both players to just let them stab you, run away and then you catch them. Maybe I'm just sadistic and enjoy the chase to catch them, cause I mean they never really get far. At least not in ranks 8-14 or so.
---
Same with NOED, it's an easily countered perk. Destroy all the totems and you have nothing to worry about any more. I get that they're crutch perks but it's not like they're OP enough to guarantee the killer gets a 4k or the survivor survives the whole game. Unlike camping there is no way for the hooked survivor to fight back and survive. At least with DS and NOED the survivor has a chance, with camping the chance is zero.
---
I am a survivor main and basically consider it a free win when against Letherfae aka Bubba aka Hugh Hugh
---
AHAHAHAHA
---
The picture would have been even more hilarious if it was reversed. First he looks at the bloodweb, then at the player, going "...fuck"
---
Prob because they did not care and even wanted to die a lot of ppl do that. The points even prove that honestly 
---
Just an FYI but Tar bottle is actually bugged, it doesn't do anything.
---
I dare you to play Smash online and see how Nintendo fans have been keeping themselves busy
---
While I totally understand the absolute hatred of someone Urban Evading the whole game, that perk is one of THE best perks for playing stealthy and great to have when you choose not to abuse it. If it had to have a debuff it would probably be better to make it so you can only use it in the killers terror radius since that’s the only reason you’d really need to be stealthy.
---
Ha so true
---
BHVR: We put the "pass" in "optimization pass"
---
This has been posted before I think
---
Rancor doesn't reveal auras, it reveals locations. The difference is locations are just a notification with a survivor outline on top showing where the survivor was at the exact moment the perk activated, rather than a silhouette that shows exactly where the survivor is for a few seconds. 
---
Sloppiest 360’s I’ve ever seen so I think it’s simply cause you’re a Claudette in the corn

So like, I'm a killer main, and I don't camp. But you wanted a debate and I do want to say that while it is certainly unfun, it is a strategy that is part of the game. 
---
Here's what survivors can do about it:
---
1) Don't immediately hang around to save someone right when they get hooked. Saving someone 59 seconds after they have been hooked is the same as saving them 1 second after being hooked, so use that time to complete generators and be sure they aren't being camped.
---
2) If a hooked survivor is being camped, rush down gens as fast as possible. Give up on this survivor. It sucks, but the only way we are going to stop people from camping is by teaching them that it is a terrible and easily punishable strategy. They already lose BP for hanging out near hooked survivors, if you can ensure that the game is over before they  hook anyone else, they are going to start realizing how bad of an idea camping is.
---
The reason I hesitate to call it toxic, is that there are in-game methods of easily punishing it. Tea-bagging at exit gates, flaming in the post game chat, these are toxic. It's just being negative towards others for the sake of it. Camping as a killer has direct in-game rewards, albeit with a bp downside if done poorly, and so it is definitely a strategy. It's just a really bad and easily punishable one. It is, however, on the survivors to punish it.
---
haha yea, though i still get mean messages from killers sometimes but i still just say gg. i mean i don't entirely blame them, i can see why it's frustrating but i'd rather them be rude to the toxic survivors and not label me as toxic just for being in the same game as them hahaha
---
Doesn't need a full 115% during charge up, just make it 100, so you're not actively losing distance that you have to make back up with the shitty acceleration mechanic.
---
TBH, he's far from the worst killer in the game, and he can get 4k's pretty reliably if played well. But as he is right now, he just doesn't do anything to make him unique.
---
Whenever I go to do this its usually a private profile though. Shame, because I wanted to spread the love!
---
No, you're not. In fact you're acting like an immature brat
---
On the menu the killer will have low ping but when everyone has readied up it goes to 500 proving the killer is gonna lag switch and most people just cba with that shit
---
good idea, toxic survivors insult even when they win lol. they'll say "gg camping piece of shit got rekt" or something along those lines, i see it a lot. what i WILL say is that both sides definitwly have bad eggs, and as mentiones you only see more complaints about toxic survivors because the ratio is 1:4
---
No, they are nerfs. You killer mains seem to forget that

How much time did it take?

All of my memes are shamefully low effort so about a couple minutes

It’s a purple add-on. I want it to be worth being a purple add-on

windows, bruh.
---
Wait... I don't do that... Why insulting Claudette? Playing Claudette doesn't mean you're toxic...
---
He has superpowers.
---
He has a crush.
---
He has a strange Japanese name.
---
**perfect**
---
They used to be different shades of red between gens and survivors. But now to the same.
---
You could mindgame with a locker, but now it just hides the aura.
---
Well in that case it’s fair game and I don’t blame you lol. 
---
Funnily, that's how I made two friends almost two years ago. Guys legit thought I was cheating, but we all laughed about it post game when I explained. Dude had my back a couple of times down the line. 
---
They've since moved on from Steam though. 
---
Yeah I run dead hard, selfcare, iron will, and balanced landing (or adrenawin) and endlessly loop killers. Having iron will let's me juke them just enough to put some distance before the chase starts up again.
---
Unless it's a good huntress. 
---
Then I just die. 
---
400iq 
---
I think the “bump” animation should be swapped between bubba and billy. It just doesn’t make sense- bubba,s power is worse, but is punished far more for running into an object?
---
Look at how many others agreed though
---
This is the internet, giant tentacle things holding a female = LEWD
---
I’d rather the devs not use a mental illness as a power.
---
people who only ue around not doing shit almost never happens. it doesn't require dev action
---
But then we wouldn't have the gem that is Susie
---
NO I'M MAKING WILD ACCUSATIONS OF YOU AND HAVING MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS YOU LIL PERV
---
It's partially because if you wait a week, most people who usually play the game are back where they belong and, in my opinion, partially this like mind game where people see a lower rank and just assume they're worse when in reality they're the same skill level as someone higher rank. 
---
I can’t use dead hard effectively. I fuck it up every time. Same for decisive strike. I can hit 8 great skill checks in a row on a gen but always miss dis 
---
I decided to try the Basement Bubba. Did Noed just to give them an extra goose when they got all the gens. If Noed was still going when someone got to the basement I restricted myself to the chainsaw. Post game comments about genuine scares made my weekend.
---
As a devout lover of Miyazaki, I’m enraptured. A set of Ghibli skins would be beautiful and worth all my money! Thanks for the idea OP.
---
Wait I dont think I have unless it was the clip with the hag who caught that teabagger
---
I AM EVERYWHERE, ALL THE TIME
---
You talk about a double standard, but then apply a double standard yourself by saying what this survivor did was wrong. There is no reason they are required to exit the game. If the killer wants them to leave, they hit them. If not, the survivor can stay as long as they want. It DOES matter even if they aren't SWF, because knowing if noed is active or not is very important information to the other survivors. What is your logic? You don't know the other people in the game, so fuck them? Why do you (and everyone else on this subreddit) get so triggered over someone spamming the Ctrl key? Who gives a shit?
---
Unless in a swf everyone will check up on the hooked player to figure out if killer is camping, thus gen rushing is harder
---
&gt;Coming from the guy that revealed the prestige exploit, you sound like a salty survivor main.
---
What does this have to do with anything? Anyone that disagrees with you is salty? 
---
Also does your retard brain realize the glitch worked on killer too? Lol so stupid if you to try to use that as some kind of point.
---
&gt;Giving Myers bloodlust at tier 1 only with scratched mirror is beneficial. He could never keep up gwith getting looped because he wouldn’t have bloodlust. He could be endlessly, because 5% higher speed won’t change much.
---
Sounds like you just suck at killer. Scratched mirror isn't for chasing thru loops it's for surprise attacks.
---
 I bet you vault windows as nurse if you're this retarded
---
ZOMBIE HUGGER? ZOMBIE RECRUITER MORE LIKE
---
Claudettes don’t have spines tho
---
Just relied on noed noob killer using crutch perks /s
---
Duh
---
They actually claimed it would be out like a month ago last year. They said January 2019 like literally 
---
Exactly, otherwise I'd run out of zombies to hug
---
Freddy buff
---
Definitely not anymore 
---
Erm where did you hear January? Thought it was well known they said summer 2019
---
DUUUDE WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR DEFAULT DWIGHT FLAIR? It's like you went in to camoflauge 
---
But it’s not “using a mental illness as a power”. It’s more akin to what Overwatch did, and I’m saying the form switch would fit well with the multiple personalities, like each personality has a different power and different strengths and weaknesses. One could be like T3 Michael or one could be a super fast guy. 
---
YOU EVEN PUT ENTIDADDY IN THE TITLE
---
JESUS
---
It’s on Twitter it is known now that its summer but that wasn’t the original plan
---
IT WAS FOR IRONIC COMEDY I WASN'T BEING SERIOUS
---
Isn’t that console getting an update or something? Lol
---
How'd I rely on NOED when it didnt come close to end game?
---
A killer with multiple phases of his power (similar to MM, but more expanded upon) would be great but not using MPD. It would just be wrong :/
---
AhA the truth comes out
---
/s means sarcastic
---
“I’m not calling you a cheater but I wanna abuse that exploit you use too”
---
So he’s not calling you a cheater if you don’t like the word, but he thinks you’re a cheater and wants to cheat too
---
That's pretty much how I get all my 4k's as bubba.  for some reason I hook someone in the basement as bubba and walk away for 10 seconds and someone goes for the unhook.
---
Like what are you two thinking I'm gonna come back revving it up ready to add a second dummy to the basement.  Then usually the person who got unhooked DC's after I down them both.
---
For whatever reason a basement hook just attracts survivors to go so much harder for the saves and it's so god damn obvious too, I just have to walk away to bait in the survivor then turn around again.  Like if ya'll would just give it some time before the save and wait it out you would get so much more done.
---
Survivors are the ones who decide where the chase happens. A survivor with a brain usually makes sure to not be in the open
---
Survivors who use DS just make me tunnel and camp them all game. Which I’m fine with 
---
There are fewer pallets, and jungle gyms have been nerfed by the vault speed change. Both of these things were important to keep Killers from wanting to tear their eyeballs out, because the game's been survivor-centric since the day it came out, up until this year. I think what you're covering is mostly just latency issues. Try to dodge out of lobbies with 200+ ping.
---
this is actually a new feature where you can merge two killers' abilities
---
this is just an example of Pig+Nurse
---
&gt;Does it really? 2/3 times there are no pallets or survivors are just running in a straight line or easy to mindgame or anything. 
---
Play killer in rank 1.  This is not the case at all.
---
It lets you play killers you don't own. No perks or add ons 
---
Let's not act like he couldn't see her, he probably just mistaked feng as part of the map and rushed off somewhere else.
---
/r/subredditsimulator vibes here
---
I got ya. 
---
So you want Franks Mixtape 2.0? Not every high tier addon needs to be as good as iri heads lol
---
In a game where you have a deformed woman eat people alive, and a man who stomps and breaks people necks and then cutting their fingers off to taste them, multiple personality is where we cross the line? Lmao
---
Hm, ok. After reading the explanation in the google document, i do agree on you variety list. BUT in my opinion, a addon, that just gives improvement in speed should not count in regards of variety, as it changes nothing about the playstyle of a killer. A lot of variety is given, too, on how these addons can be combined.  
---
With that, i wouldnt put the Trapper that high, nor the Nurse that low. Depending on addons, you can play the Nurse completely different, with variing counts of dashes and sight. The Shape, too, can be everlasting horror, slow, but all-knowing, instant-murderer and a lot more. The Trapper always will be putting traps, and the best thing he can do is increasing the chance of catching survivors.
---
Pantless race car dingleberry dangler Billy &gt; Shirtless clown &gt; shirtless bee &gt; shirtless Myers&gt; shirtless david 
---
Or back outside the map... either way you wouldn’t be stuck
---
Even solely adding bloodlust doesn’t break the game.
---
Xbox
---
I only use it to farm BP on doc
---
4K
---
Wait how did they Nerf BBQ+C
---
Oh its definitely harder. No disputing that. My point is that it's still possible for people to survive whereas 2 or a single person isn't possible at all.
---
I've won plenty of 3v1 matches against decent killers. You do have to play differently than you would with 4 people. It all depends if your team knows how to adapt and if you're up against a good killer. As always.
---
Thank you for the info! I’m on console so I highly doubted a lag switch.
---
All tiddies are welcome I just think she also has some gud cleavage 👁👅👁
---
&gt; what this survivor did was wrong
---
No, I didn't. What I said, and do try to keep up now, is I feel no sympathy for what happened to him. He sat at the exit gate, he bm'd, he got punished. Yes, he got punished only due to getting lagswitched, but that doesn't make me feel bad for him when he had every opportunity to leave. You people really do have issues with this reading stuff...
---
&gt; It DOES matter even if they aren't SWF
---
Again, you missed the point. Leaving the game to see if the killer has NOED is irrelevant if you're not playing SWF. You really are bad at this...
---
&gt; Why do you...get so triggered over someone spamming the Ctrl key?
---
So we see that not only is your reading ability less than shit-tier, but so too are your assumptions. I don't particularly care about someone teabagging, though it seems to indicate poor sportsmanship more often than not. I presume then that you must also be fine with nodding and power spamming over a slugged body? Does it also apply to smacking a hooked survivor?
---
Actually, save it, I don't really care for your answers. You've demonstrated in one short paragraph that you have issues with projection and reading comprehension, so your dialogue doesn't interest me any.
---
that erik estavillo guy threatened not queen
---
You can hide your aura in lockers, gen auras and survivor auras are literally the same color so you can hide in them, and distortion exists.
---
Maybe you can, he just sucks too hard apparently 
---
If you have a router you can plug your Ethernet cable into ur gaming device and use WiFi for other devices at the same time. No reason to have to choose. 
---
He is only good cuz of his add ons. Base legion is meh
---
Unless you're playing on Pallethaven, then no, but survivors always have enough time to get to a loop in a chase thanks to exhaustion perks.
---
Cat ears
---
Trapper is probably the easiest to get the feel for killer. He’s fast and you don’t have to worry about using any fancy powers. And the traps are a good way to practice mind games. 
---
DLC killer wise, id get the spirit. You can use iridescent shards to buy her, without wasting money. Buts that more because she’s my favorite lol. 
---
All I see is "Play Huntress, virgin"
---
Lol this perk that gives a survivor a free escape after being outplayed perfectly fine, this perk that gives killers unearned mindless instadowns for playing like shit and losing the objectives perfectly fine, but that perk that makes an item drop oh no......you are so in the freaking minority on this one hahaha.
---
I’ve got 150-200 mbps usually. Is that enough for good ping once dedicated servers hit?
---
didnt even know there was a claudette
---
&gt; If you think it takes SWF to make use of that knowledge you haven't hit the tip of the salt iceberg
---
As I already said to someone else, my comment was referring to leaving the game as a way to discover whether or not NOED was using. Due to the change, leaving to see perks is irrelevant because you can't communicate it.
---
&gt; Further survivors have reasons to stick around
---
Depending on the state of the game, sure. You can venture out to cleanse the NOED that will undoubtedly get a temper tantrum thrown over. You can go for hook saves against a killer that may be face camping to secure at least one/an additional kill due to the game being over. Even distracting at the exit gate is a thing, but the main takeaway from all of these things is that if you happen to get caught and killed, you have only yourself to blame due to the fact you had every opportunity to escape and made the conscious decision to leave the exit gate.
---
&gt; there are no perks that reward a killer for camping
---
Of course there aren't, but there is gameplay that "rewards" it. My point, which apparently is getting missed repeatedly, is that if a killer wasting his time staring at you by the exit is you wasting his time and protecting your team, then so it must be if you're being face camped; this isn't sufficient for survivors in most cases though because one means you die. Conversely, if a killer isn't "giving you a reason to leave" by staring at you by the gate, so it must be that your survivor teammates crowding the hook instead of doing gens isn't "giving the killer a reason to leave".
---
&gt; Your saltabout that is unfounded
---
I swear this is becoming a self-evident thing that buttmad survivors have tremendous issues with reading, though you have an absolutely *stellar* ability to cherrypick certain phrases with your blinders on and completely fabricate a position that you can attack with all your outrage. You guys are pathetic.
---
Huh, that’s right, where does his chainsaw go when
---
He picks up survivors 
---
I have like 600 hours on it on PC and its not terrible. My cousin told me to get it for for the xbone so I did. I still have the first model of it since I don't like getting rid of things, holy crap is it awkward and stuttery. I even begin to imagine how it controls when running from a failed Rex tame
---
The fact that these morons are buying into this shit when this thread is as old as the post it references is hilarious.
---
Franklin's is fucking gross.
---
How did that even happen? The killer didn't even get a single hit in on you guys? Or did they disconnect out of frustration?
---
I've never seen such a massive disparity, except for when higher ranked survivors bring low ranks along with them into matches.
---
Yes they are cute, but I am not a furry, I would rather hunt them down.
---
My favorite was a hard camping nurse who said I held the game hostage because I walked around the whole map to find the hatch and it took about 5 minutes. Learn what is bannable/how the game works people.
---
And what exactly did Overwatch do? I for one got no idea.
---
Basically achievements is the only reason I play videogames at all.
---
Oh boy, 2010 again! I can fuck my life up once more! 
---
Oof
---
bruh really
---
&gt; I don't really give a shit if a killer stares at my downed body or smacks me on the hook
---
Good for you, but this is not a commonly held belief, thus the double standard.
---
&gt; but half of your responses reference how it's bad manners
---
We'll look past the gross exaggeration happening and I'll address the part about the bad manners. I'm a competitor, and one of the core tenets I adopted a long time ago was being a good sport, win or lose. Play the game and leave it on the proverbial field. Now, this doesn't make me opposed to banter or head games, but some people take it over the line. Of course this line is subjective, there's no denying it, but that doesn't change that I feel no sympathy for someone that tries to showboat or gloat and then loses.
---
&gt; EVEN IF YOU ARE SOLO
---
You really can't read can you?
---
&gt; Leaving the match won't tell you if they have NOED or not
---
&gt;Of course it won't, not after the change, and it's irrelevant anyway if you're not playing SWF
---
Leaving the match to see the killer's perk is irrelevant if you're not playing SWF because you can't communicate the information to the others. *That's what my entire statement was*. I'm beginning to think you're intentionally skewing every single thing I say.
---
Just for fun I went back this morning and looked at the messages he sent me. I decided to check out his game clips. He has a whole collection of himself DCing from matches because he gets downed by killer. Most of the time for no reason other than his own fault or really bad lag. I’m sure he assumed those laggy matches were “hackers” too 
---
Even IT had a pennywise form so having a humanoid figure works
---
One of the characters, Symmetra, is autistic. It works with her story because she is being manipulated by the company she works for to do evil things when she wants to help people, which is what her kit is based on, helping her team. 
---
Freddy looks so terrified.
---
One time I played doc with the illusionary pallet add on and the survivors thought I was hacking. :P
---
[Template for other people with smart opinions](https://i.imgur.com/tgzZZTz.png)
---
The....opposite is true. Survivors and generators used to be the same shade of red for the aura, and now survivors are a lighter red/pink.
---
You can still hide behind the generator when another survivor is hooked if you put the generator between you and the hook. Staying on the generator makes your aura obvious.
---
definitely would be an exploit, so don't try it in a real lobby.
---
Can’t forget about the buff guy who wants to learn mind control and shocks people. Or the floating nurse who strangled patients, or the girl with the mind of a child that kills and eats people and abducts little girls. 
---
I think it's a case of flavour-Bubba is a psychopathic manchild, and like a child, he throws fits when something doesn't go well for him. Of course, it makes no sense from a gameplay standpoint...unless he gets made into an anti-looper role-then it'd make sense, as it'd necessitate fine control around loops.
---
I haven't played in 3 months, came back recently, first game at rank 20 some dude complained killers are op. Then while being chased by the killer, hid in a locker, got found and dced right away. 
---
If survivors spawned together it's easy to find them because they are usually on the gen farthest from you.
---
Leatherface just needs better addons. They were very lazy in that regard and just gave him Hillbilly’s, and a lot of Hillbilly’s addons don’t even make sense for Bubba. 
---
New rule: If you have DS you can’t complain about the killers build 
---
Gee, I wonder how many serial killers and deformed cannibals exist in real life compared to people with mental illness?
---
Woosh is over used, so I'll just say it.
---
You missed the joke.
---
*Her*: "Babe come over"  
---
*Billy*: "Can't, in a chase rn"  
---
*Her*: "My parents aren't home"  
---
*chainsaw revving noise*
---
Your Ad hominum ad nauseum is quite interesting to watch. 
---
1) there is context you "cherry-pick" and ignore. The killer had remained stationary a disturbing amount of time. The tea bagging was the only way a survivor could safely interact while checking. Flash light blinding would have been the other way, but claudette didn't have one.
---
2) Exit gate stand offs are not equivalent at all to hook camping a survivor. In one instance a player is actively being held hostage and frozen in a state they can't play from. In the other it is two players standing off. Both players are guilty of creating that game state. Had you said hatch standoff that would be another matter entirely and I would agree, but you chose a nonsequeter for your comparison.
---
Mori should be a perk instead of an addon, maybe letting you kill a survivor once they've been hooked two times/struggle phase. Maybe add some minor bonus on top of it. This way we could see more mori animations without the intrinsic salt that comes from them. I know devs want the game to be about this idiotic entity but fuck that, I'd take the mori animation over the stupid hook one any day.
---
Why do people want bloody party streamers to be secret? Shouldn’t there be an incentive for all players to not DC for double points? I feel like this includes the killer since it doesn’t specify survivors solely, but if you DC when party is used you’re just hurting yourself.
---
Hag: \*severing David's jugular with her bare teeth and ripping out his liver\*
---
Survivor: \*plops balls on David's face twice\*
---
Hag: How rude! \*eats David's vital organ\*
---
by any means did i try to compare. but with that beeing sad im pretty sure all kinds of discrimination are bad
---
I don't see how he is worst Billy, that implies they tried to do something similar to Billy and failed, him having a chainsaw is not that. Also he needs a straight up rework to add things to his power, maybe a secondary part like they did with Pig. He feels so incomplete and the fact BBQ is not hitting the shrine (i wonder why that is devs) is the only reason someone will ever buy him.
---
reminder that myers and freddy got fucked by this locker buff, I can never see a survivor hiding in a locker and pretend to walk past until im right in front of the locker and sllowwlllyyy turn towards the locker using scratched mirror myers ever again big sad :(((
---
Oh sorry, I just realized that this was "don't punish killer, reward survivor". I actually thought it was "punish killer and reward the survivor". Thats why I thought that other survivors should matter in that case. But you are right: If the killer won't leave an area around the hook, then you should get more bloodpoints, regardless if another survivor is near you or not.
---
Why do that when we can watch an interesting killer and not an incomplete mess?
---
"there would be no counterplay" are you rarted mate, bloodlust doesnt make someone unloopable, breaking pallets breaks bloodlust
---
My point being is that this game has worse things than mental disorders. Comics, TV shows, Movies, etc. have all kinds of people with mental disorders be the main villan, but a lot don't have an issue with it.
---
Why would it be a problem in DBD, a game with Gore involved.
---
wouldnt scratched mirror just be a straight upgrade from vanity mirror then?
---
Make vanity mirror rare than very rare at that point.
---
well most people find the Doctor extremely annoying to play against, so not surprised by all the DC at all.
---
MY fun is making YOUR fun less FUN  
---
Cover me with some salt
---
well rank 20s and rank 1s hide entirely differently, so it would be inaccurate to say it requires no skill, I mean its like playing a stealth game against a real person, you cant just be rarted and get away with it
---
Bitter murmur reveals auras, exposed means they would go down with 1 hit 
---
I ran away from the killer
---
If you vault after being hit and they're still on the ledge, you can launch the killer back. How far varies, only tried it twice.
---
One time, the killer went to far they hit a tree, the other the killer just got nudged.
---
I used to main the Huntress but I recently bought the Spirit and am loving her so I think she will be my main for awhile. I like that she can be genuinely scary when played well; killers like that are my favorite.
---
Rancor reveals all locations, though. Bitter murmur just gives the location of those within a certain radius of the finished gen. 
---
EW NO
---
Urban Evasion is not the problem, selfish team mates are. I've had team mates who didn't do gens, didn't try to rescue, standing near a locker or slowly walking around the map waiting for everyone else to do the work so they can escape. They didn't have UE either. On the other end, I've had help from team mates who did run UE, sneaking in to get saves, doing gens in the middle of the map etc.
---
I was actually really relieved when I heard that legion was multiple people. I feel like them going the other route would have been pretty predictable (especially for the horror genre, which looooves to use split personalities but almost never in a thought provoking or interesting manner). I never would have thought the Legion was actually going to be multiple people. I was pretty excited when that was revealed, and then pretty quickly disappointed when I saw that them being multiple people had no impact on their gameplay whatsoever. I still think the idea of them being more than one person is great, but I wish you could actually see that in their implementation as opposed to it just being cosmetics :/ 
---
Bitter murmur, back in the day it did nothing until the exit gates were powered and you saw all auras for 5 seconds lol.
---
If you NEED self care to play this game, youre not good. Go watch all the top streamers and tell me how many run self care.
---
no its not correct, and I wasnt baiting anyone, I dont think anyone could be offended by that 
---
I had the same exact idea, and with like, stockings and various other girl clothes, yes, the greatest survivor to ever be added to the game
---
Doctor in the lower ranks is pretty annoying to go up against. Before legion, doctor was the most hated other than Freddy of course 
---
hell yeah
---
Do lockers hide auras yet?
---
NOED is fine tho. If anything, they just need to remove the speed buff. 1-shot ability is hard enough to deal with, killers don't need bonus speed + bloodlust. 
---
&gt;If you NEED self care to play this game, youre not good. Go watch all the top streamers and tell me how many run self care.

All the ones that don't play swf.
---
When no one will come to rescue you if you finally get downed it kinda is a death sentence.
---
Freddy's lunge, plus the hit box issue, I'd be surprised if it missed. LOL!
---
Prove me wrong.
---
I'm waiting.
---
You do you mate.
---
Xbox is supposed to run worse than PS4. I know they have lots of issues PS4 doesn’t get. Ark is such a good game just ruined by optimisation. I’d love to play it on pc with the mods they have, especially s+ I love building shit and s+ looks so good.
---
Why is that man all shaved except for his armpits? It is a bonerkiller.
---
Thanks, the system I describe is based on the writings on the Mori Offerings.
---
100% agreed.  They are mirrors of each other.  Safety nets that both would have to be addressed together if one was ever modified in the game.  
---
Definitely not an ebony mori. That’d be a bit much. Also yea, devour soap is a thing
---
I don't have UE but I crouch walk to get to gens. I try to do at least one gen if not more. I don't run due to not wanting scratch marks. 
---
Because I got a 4k with wraith.
---
They were a SWF with two of them being on red ranks, mind you i was a rank 13 at the time i don't even know how i pulled it off. 
---
With this kind of quality it will be hard to get over 10... I mean 30 FPS.
---
To be fair though there would be a revolt.  There are a bunch of "killer mains" that couldn't envision a game where they didn't have noed crutch to fall back on when they give up the gens.
---
And there are probably an equal amount of baby survivors that couldn't imagine not running their get out of jail free card.  
---
Basically the weaker players in the community would cause a massive shitstorm.
---
I’m not sure if this is considered crossplay,but can I transfer my account from the ps4 to the switch
---
As is said in my post it could be nerfed. So removing speed is a nerf.
---
If you changed Adrenaline and D-Strike but also changed NOED I would be more than happy with the results. But we all know what would happen if the devs did that. 
---
They would probably break the game by doing so.
---
she’d been chasing me for a minute so she felt ZERO pity 😂
---
Dude run whatever you want. As long as you're not hiding in a corner and you're helping teammates/doing gens you are fine. This person is just upset. Everyone can have their own playstyle. The people I have seen post stuff like this are the Dwight's that dc right when they get downed for the first time.
---
I hate when survivors get pissed when you wait at the hatch. There are literally two other doors
---
The hardest choices require the strongest minds.
---
its literally correct, you're correcting him for using the right pronoun and telling him to use the wrong one, "they" has always been and always will be the proper pronoun to use for anonymous people. unless you mean the character bubba, hes a he, but the character isn't the one who sees, its the player, so technically, "they" is right. get nae naed on.
---
what a gift this is
---
Wait, maybe I am missing what you are saying. I'm not talking about leaving the game to see the killers perks. Maybe you don't know that if the killer has noed, the survivors don't know until he hits the first person. That's the entire point of standing there at the exit baiting a hit. So the noed debuff pops up on all the other survivors screens. You literally need to not exit the game in order for that information to be revealed. Holy shit, we solved your problem! Now you can understand why he was standing there at the gate!
---
fucking new line cinema entertainment 
---
When you're deciding whether to type **darn** or not. 
---
Your attempts at responses are getting worse and worse. You've intentionally misrepresented my position and talked around the very obvious statements I've made.
---
You're just reinforcing why conversations like this are pointless because buttmad survivor mains will do whatever it takes to repaint your statements into a negative so that they may attack it with their outrage.
---
This discussion is over.
---
Dude just run Scratched Mirror/Boyfriend’s Note with PYYF, Sloppy Monitor and Abuse and Iron Maiden. Fucking ezpz. 
---
Leather face seems to be one of the worst killers about not noticing survivors hiding in places like that. Idk if it's the killer or the people that play him though lol
---
Optimizing the game won’t earn them more money, so it is at the absolute bottom of their priority list. Maybe if you children who play on Xbox or PlayStation can make a memetition like they did for the Spongebob super bowl thing? (Which will be completely ignored)
---
You respect the killer too much. Just because hes Legion doesn't mean he has Discordance, and even if he does, who cares? Do the gen. Make him come to you and pressure you off it. Make him leave the hook area. Its not rocket science. 
---
You are my new friend 
---
would you do it if you could get alot of money though
---
Doctor is a zero skill needed killer. No fun at all. If your gonna keep playing him then get used to dc’s. 
---
thats splitting hairs.  In this case it would be obvious that he talks about The Killer (he) or Leatherface (he)
---
Lol wow you take this game so seriously people tend to play this game for fun 
---
It's hard to tell these days, Reddit just gives condescending answers when you give your opinion on something. My bad I guess.
---
Oh, no, *everyone* takes a hit if they cheap out!  
---
[This is what happen if you cheap out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/abzb51/are_13rd_of_useast_servers_of_bad_quality/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)  
---
Well, one example.  
---
There is more to servers than their location, a poor server can cause packet loss, for example.
---
Look for TheToxicNea
---
Wraith. Got used to him before even the nurse came out, he's still my favorite. He just looks really cool.
---
Kk thanks
---
Mooink! 
---
How did they found your Facebook ? Do you have a public steam profile with a link to your facebook in it ???
---
Do u want, nea art I commission 
---
hooked one in basement go up. 2 jump behind me, I go down. 1 is body blocking stairs, they all run up to me. (one thing to keep in mind is I am Bubba.) So down they all go. I go up to look and its a ace wanting to loop me around the pallet. I let him as they are going no where. Was called trash camper, a failed streamer and so on into homophobia.
---
Tbh i'd complain if they didn't regularly push out content.
---
Believe it or not people would leave if content stopped and they focused on QoL.
---
A new dlc brings hype and is marketable. "We fixed bugs" isn't exactly trailer hype worthy.
---
The nurse tunneled hooked then tunneled 1 meg for the entire game while the 2nd meg body blocked so the 1st meg wouldnt get downed again. For some reason the nurse never hit the 2nd meg and Nea and I finished all 5 gens and powered the gates before the nurse just pulled the plug and DC.
---
One of the craziest and most one sided games Ive ever been apart of
---
well, no, hes talking about the player, because the player is behind the controls, in charge of spotting him, not bubba
---
the fact that you have to sacrifice an entire perk slot because of the nerf and you cant actually get them while they're INSIDE the locker
---
Maybe. How much and do you do playmats? 
---
Honestly, if they made incentives or rewards for ranking up or staying a certain rank without depipping it'd be awesome!
---
well thats just rood
---
all dwights seem to act similar lmao
---
Nono, like, do u want to see art I commissioned 
---
I put my real name in the slot for it. I used to not play any public multiplayer, and had it there so people I knew could find me. I neglected to remove it when I picked up public multiplayer. It has been removed now, of course, but that's too little too late.
---
preach sister!!!
---
I dont think he left you alone he just lost you
---
I know this is a shitpost but like... I wouldn’t mind tenacity also reducing noises by like 25%
---
As someone who plays scratched mirror Michael almost exclusively, he’s fine the way he is. It’s almost impossible to not get a 4K especially if you go to Memorial Institute or The Game. The only time you have to worry is when you have survivors with amazing game awareness and scratched mirror awareness, and even then, they tend to underestimate perma-tier 1 Michael and be ultra-altruistic, which almost always leads to their downfall.
---
Also, Vanity Mirror is useless.
---
Not much has happened really...New killers...New store with cosmetics...Some perks were changed and pallets were nerfed in number/no vacuum. 
---
Same old DbD overall.
---
Likewise, I hate when Wraith's think they're sneaking up on me. No, love, I can hear your giant, galumphing footsteps coming up behind me every time. You ain't sneaky.
---
Had this happen earlier. Got into a lobby as Nea and hit ready. Set my controller down to go get my siblings their breakfast amd when I came back the game loaded me in amd I was playing Level 1 David...
---
It's not the only time it's happened either but this was the first time it seriously screwed me over.
---
Oh, lol, sure! 
---
r/iamverybadass
---
Add me on discord Marble#3616
---
Thank you man! 
---
Didn't know it was possible with chainsaw, good to know.
---
Really? From what happened to me someone got a save every game. I saved someone every other game with the crackers. The timing isn’t any where as hard as flashlights. You can force a killer to move out of the way just by standing near a hook. 
---
I had this happen to me. I had just prestiges my Kate to P2... I had 2 perks on her (we’ll make it and Dance with me both tier 1) and my controller bumped my leg or something and I didn’t even notice before the countdown happened and bam... coldwind farms against a Billy. I was so surprised and panicked when I saw who I was playing! 
---
It was such a weird match, too. I was in a SWF with 2 others. I was the last alive and the Billy let me do the last gen and took me to the hatch. 
---
Your welcome :)
---
&gt; until the bad killer mechanic (bloodlust)
---
lmao
---
If someone dcs and I have rankor i kill everyone except the obsession and make it so I want to farm with them, until the exit gate is opened and I Mori them HAHAHAHAHA
---
Played The Game as Scratched Mirror Myers, and had a player DC as she wasn't going to play with a "camping, hacking POS" (I short formed it here) and started a group chat (PS4 for the win) with all the other Survivors as if to call me out on it. 
---
Told them it's not camping if I leave a hook and walk right to the locker he's hiding inside in the washroom, but he was having none of it.
---
None of the other Survivors had an issue with how I played though *shrug*.
---
True, but autodidact won't speed up self healing speeds while botany will.
---
I've been wondering why it's so easy for killers to hit me while I try to drop pallets or vaulting a window.  Did they increase the hit boxes?
---
Lol the things people think of. The salt is real
---
Looking at their profile, seems they do it a lot 🤔
---
Found the PC Master Race guy
---
Dang Dude, if i was this killer i woulda fuck the shitty life of this boy.
---
Unless he wants to ddos he can't do shit with the IP anyway
---
Lol, he got banned in the middle of the match. 
---
Indeed, takes about 30 seconds for distortion to be useless against Freddy. About the time it takes for a skill check to appear for me as going against Freddy is the only time I don't get skill checks.
---
In my entire experience with this game playing both sides, I have 1 match where the killer was distinctively an asshole and would mori spam and lock me on the ground and pick me up, trying to force me to get off in a corner so he could walk up and hit me again and basically spent a good 20-30 minutes trying to force me to DC.  Really after like 5 minutes I just alt tabbed and started doing other stuff occasionally checking back if it was over yet.  Don't even know why either I wasn't even doing anything BM against the killer.
---
However for games as killer it's always 1 in 3 or 1 in 2 lobbies have toxic survivors who are absolute dickheads in post game chat.  Like shit, I try to be helpful if someone mentions that they are bad or wondering how I did something and I try to explain and help em improve but for many games there's just so much toxicity and accusations.  I'm sorry you lost after going down into the basement against a bubba, considering how many times you guys swarm around after I hook someone and go for saves I'm being accused of camping despite blatantly chasing off people who are hiding 10 feet away from hooks for an extended period of time trying to get someone to sneak in the unhook.  Or if you unhook someone literally right in front of me I'm likely going to smack that person you just unhooked so I can put them right back on.
---
It's really god damn draining and why I take so many breaks from the game, I absolute loathe playing killer purely because of dealing with survivors.  Even dealing with the stupid gameplay at higher ranks, it's the community I hate most.
---
You wanna start a petition?
---
Better start working on that tattoo sleeve!
---
thats weird
---
Legion certainly goes in the right direction. With survivors bleeding out it's a great time sink where you can be active and they need to heal instead of doing gens, similar to Pigs trap.
---
Frankly, if we had more mechanics like this, Ruin wouldn't be mandatory. Gens are done way too quickly with 2 half way competent survivors, not to mention actual good ones. So every second someone needs to spend otherwise while you hunt for more is great.
---
Personally I only use Frank's mixtape against flashlight SWF, because I feel it's too strong in random games and takes fun away.
---
I run Sloppy Butcher, Surveillance, Monitor and Abuse and Discordance.
---
Sloppy is both another time sink and a tracking tool during frenzy in one perk. Surveillance and Discordance are for spotting survivors quickly and keep up some control without running across the entire map. Monitor and Abuse allows to get closer before everyone hides from the heartbeat and potentially spot survivors and initiate a chase, while also increasing the aura reveal status of frenzy hits. Underrated Legion perk imo. 
---
Overall I think they're a great and fun killer and while you can do some stupidly strong AddOn setup, it's hard to find killers who can't. Trapper and Fred are the ones that come to mind. And we all can agree that it's masochistic to play them in single digit ranks. I think people just complain for its own sake.
---
Alexa, play Through the fire and the flames on a Banjo
---
It’s a generic message sometimes, or could just be that they had cheats (very unlikely). Sometimes my computer LED lights counts as a cheat, which shuts down my computer and gives all survivors this notification (which makes no sense)
---
WhAt Do yOu MeAn bY nErFiNg NoED?!?!
---
-BEhaviour
---
I mean, they do have that option, KWF
---
Absolutely. I’m rank 9 killer right now. Sometimes you get games where you get a 4k with one generator turned on. Some games you go against a SWF of multicolored Dwights who destroy your Ruin in the first 30 seconds of the game and get 3 generators done instantly with Brand New Part while red Dwight uses every pallet in the map to keep you busy. It’s a mixed bag of what you’ll get. Sometimes you get stomped, sometimes you do the stomping.
---
At that rank, you might run into a person who can loop and juke with the best of them, but most people lead you on a decent chase but aren’t uncatchable. It’s a good place to be.
---
&gt; Lol, you literally don't understand the reason he was standing at the exit.
---
I've already addressed him standing at the exit multiple times. If you could muster enough brain power to see it, my main statement was how I felt no sympathy for what happened because he sat teabagging at the exit gate instead of leaving.
---
Have a good one bud.
---
Yah I’ve had people come out and say I was cheating/using hacks because I kept finding them all game then I tell them that Daddy Myers was running scratched Mirror and I can see survivors from 32meters away. The apologize a few moments later once they go and read on it, I’ve gotten good with scratched mirror and allot of the time to mess with survivors now because I’m use to the slow walk, I won’t tier up until the last gen lol
---
The comment was edited, it previously said that Bitter Murmur only revealed the auras of whoever was on the gen when it finished.
---
Okay but that’s what the Mid season patch is
---
Wow thanks for the info, port looks really promising so far from what I've seen 
---
Survivors never just run in a straight line and always have enough pallets available, so I dont know where you're getting your experience
---
The trick to stoping most loops is to just eat the pallet. A small stun delay is way better than being looped way longer in the same spot
---
Agreed, I hate it. At least make it to where if you’re readied up you can’t change characters. 
---
Neither takes skill, both take eyes and a brain. 
---
Help me find high quality models and I can make some high quality work. ;)
---
I think it would be cool if 2/3/4 hatches spawned and every minute or every 30 seconds one would close and another woupd open 
---
Are you surprised tho
---
Same stuff, more toxic
---
The Switch actually has some impressive specs, considering its a light tablet (the customized nvidia Tegra is about as powerful as the final revision of the 360/PS3, except the switch has more and faster RAM)
---
Of course, every other patch on PC my 1070ti can't seem to run this game at a solid 60 frames until I go back to low settings so its going to come down to whether BHVR hires new and competent programmers.
---
I'm in the same boat... Not playing since about Clown...
---
In this one case, the tea bag was the only safe way to check on the killer. He waited until they had not moved a pixel for some time, tried various gestures and went to the teabag. I wouldn't consider that BM that's obviously checking on the killer at that point.
---
What you do if they released new survivor perks that 1. Told you constantly the killers location and last activity.   2. Notified you if the killer started chasing another suvivor. 3. Automatically notified you of hex and chest locations. 4. Gave you permanent aura reading on all your teammates.  5. Gave you the ability to ping teammates to rescue you from the hook or return to generators.   Bonus what if those 5 perks took up zero perk spots and you still got to have a full load out of perks.   
---
Would that be balanced? 
---
Say your opinion and stop being a dick about it.
---
Yeah I got you, just never use your real name 🤷‍♂️ can’t really do anything because it’s public. Free speech n all that. Soo block em n bite the bullet. I stopped play DBD because of the sour ass players. Had one guy messaging me like gothic self hate stuff, taking a life and how feels,  and he ran a blog about self hate. Too much weirdos.
---
That's her concept art, genius.
---
Uh how? She looks great
---
Right I have no issues with noed.... it’s fine I guess but it happens once per survivor just force it out.
---
Adrenaline is the noed equivalent, but my bigger issues is with exhaustion perks since they give survivors zoom zoom and that’s what most loopable killers have issues with. Slow af Freddy ain’t catching a sprinting/balanced/lithe survivor who knows how to walk in circles.
---
Ya ik lol. It’s a joke about how people are complaining about the graphics even though it’s just a switch.
---
Can we all just agree that Rotten Fields is the worst map in the game? Especially if you’re a Myers.
---
Leave while you can
---
I’ve seen this exact same meme uniquely made at least 4 times now
---
Big changes would be no longer getting fast vaults from any angle, you now have to run about straight at it for 2? meters to get a fast vault.
---
Healing takes longer and when downed you can recover to 95%. Those are biggest i can think of.
---
And a killer being toxic ruins the match for 4 survivors.
---
Yeah she was fairly decent, I was just trying to bait the hit so I could take the hatch. I thought the NOED was a funny surprise.
---
Off topic but im a new player. Is there any way to get freddy without buying him with real money ?
---
keep crying moron
---
PSA to survivors:  if you're gonna loop the killer and you feel you're not that good at it, please do not spend elongated time looping near the basement.  If a killer shack has a basement, I don't care how tempting it is to loop them there, try to avoid it as if you get downed, then the killer will take you to the basement and that makes life difficult for other team mates to save you.
---
Distortion perk uses tokens to block the killers aura reading
---
enduring is a good perk to counter decisive strike or pallet stuns 
---
On god I’d be totally fine if the revoked the exhaustion nerf so long as they revoke the tinkerer nerf, because honestly those two things were maybe a little busted but nonetheless fun and each side had their own little thing.
---
In b4 morse code with the croutch button
---
Hmm...even then I still can’t justify the reason for locking online play to subscribers only. “Free” games, sure, that’s all nice and good. But I draw the line at paying to play online. For $60 yearly, that’s probably going all to them. I doubt the servers you play on are supported by those subscriptions. 
---
Incoming afaik
---
the killer’s hitbox
---
From rank 1 as you said. You could blame me playing on PS4, but Monto, No0b3, Zubat and ScottJund all have lots of potato survivors on high ranks on PC as well
---
&gt; always have enough pallets available
---
Thats one of the main perks of playing without tunneling - you break a lot of pallets pretty early. Especially if you do mindgames as any killer should
---
But if you are not believing the videos of those streamers I named above, let's call a little experiment. Name me any killer, I'll record 3 games in a row playing that one without tunneling - and we'll see how it would look. I'm not pro by any means and also playing with &lt;30 fps, so it should do. 
---
Meanwhile I'll try to get to rank 1 ASAP so those videos won't be too long overdue
---
Then you can sit on the hook in the corner and ponder if you're having fun yet :)
---
Well statistically there are more survivor mains than killer mains. There are also many more ways for a survivor to be toxic twords the killer. Theres really not a good way for a killer to be toxic beyond intentional over slugging or face camping. Personally I only use these methods on toxic survivors who deserve the punishment. 
---
You pay for my game and I will play it the way you want until then do your gens and shut up. 
---
Spacebillies never die - they just go missing in action
---
and disliked with my 5 alts and thats it goodbye
---
Probably enduring or nurses calling. If you have the clown then bamboozle is pretty good too
---
Pick a killer you like and level them up enough to have tier 3 of every perk you want on them, including tier 3 bbq and ruin. 
---
It’s much more likely that people were just annoyed that you tried to start an argument in the comment section of a shitpost for no reason. A NOED/DS rant comes up like every other day, you couldn’t’ve saved it? Plus the presentation was horrible, you come off as super aggressive and give off the vibe that you won’t listen to what anyone has to say, so it’s easier to just downvote you and move on.
---
Suuuuper cute style. Love that Ace
---
Shelter woods 
---
A player intentionally sand bagged me at pallets and farmed me on the hook twice. The killer refused to hit me after the second time being pulled off the hook in front of him. I caught the player looping shack and just as he was coming around the corner I ran out to block him. 
---
The killer and I watched him die on hook, most satisfying game I’ve had and the coolest killer ever.
---
My suggestion:
---
*Put her speed to 110%.
---
*Make that blinks consumes a power gauge (similar to spirit), so if missed a lot of blinks you need to wait for recharge the power gauge to blink again. 
---
He was annoying in the beginning but then you just kept on going
---
Are you kidding? #RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY SALAD???
---
Hopefully I don’t get downvoted to hell... but I mean, come on. 
---
Long story short. Immersive Claudette waited for her team mat to die so she could grab the hatch. That bugs me. 
---
I made the other only survivor a gen to spot her out. I hooked her for the 3rd time and let my Rancor obsession live. 
---
That was the result. 
---
They do, Sony and Microsoft have their own servers compared to Steam afaik. Though I don't know how much it actually changes for the us, consumers
---
I'd assume that the real justification for paid online subscription is simple: Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo/etc. just want more money. Gaming devices from Sony are unreasonably pricey after all (at least in my country).
---
Though I don't really know much about the whole topic to have any sort of an expert opinion
---
Interesting. I believe I have found [the video](https://youtu.be/w1W61coCges). This is pretty useful to know.
---
I think moris shouldn’t be in the bloodwebs but rather obtained throughout the match like call of duty perks, let’s say something like this:
---
7 hooks - You get a green mori 
---
10 hooks - you get a red mori
---
If there’s only one survivor remaining you get the yellow mori.
---
Yes, it appears that is indeed the case. I found [a video](https://youtu.be/w1W61coCges) talking about it. Cheers for the input!
---
You will never get a reply to this
---
Tinkerer wasn't nerfed, it was changed so every killer gets a use out of it
---
Dude we should team up. 100% unstoppable
---
One-time I was on the swamp map and accidentally passed by the hatch (it was all the way in the corner and I didn't go quite far enough to hear the sound). I then wandered the rest of the map, maybe for 5 or 6 minutes. I thought I'd been everywhere so I was like "wtf, I'll just go get killed". So, I was searching for the killer... found him but he didn't see me. I was then following him and LOST him. Things were getting absurd (I didn't vault anything yet because I wasn't near a window or pallet)
---
Then, I was near the killer shack and decided "what the heck, I'll go search the chest while I'm here.". Searched it and got a firecracker. Sooo, I went up, set it off, and he came to me.
---
I stood there and let him down me. And then....he carried me to the opposite side of the map (it was a long way) and set me down on the hatch.
---
I will never forget it.
---
I really love your comics ! Is there a way to follow you ?
---
It's only broken when the survivors can communicate where the hatch is and that they have the key. 
---
There in lies another issue. ;)
---
yes
---
Lmao
---
Looka pretty good
---
I think you meant very furry
---
It's funny that you commented this because I was literally about to make an edit saying "*maybe* it wouldn't be broken if comms weren't common"
---
Even then 30 seconds is too long to be open
---
Even if there was pip rate data that would not be where you’d wanna look. It’s way too easy to pip for either side but especially killer. Apart from that the balance is better but it’s still pretty much the same way it was when you left in the sense that you play a high tier killer and do good (if you’re good) or you play a mid/low tier killer and you gotta hope for okay/bad survivors unless you’re ready to sweat your arse off. 
---
You don’t get good survivors as often because it’s a little bit more balanced but if you do get survs that know how to loop or swf you’re still in for one hell of a ride.
---
Hell no. I want him to magically summon a car falling from the sky and grind a survivor into it
---
I just try to view it from both sides. For both sides, DC's suck. Try to make it suck less by giving the survivors more of a chance. Personally, I try to do so in fun, self started ways, such as not using lunges or only using my chainsaw (as Billy, for LF that's prettt standard.) I may start slugging more, or pretending I don't see people who are in bad positions. It adds so much more fun to the game for both sides imo.
---
Close one.
---
Every person that plays survivor is aware that there is toxicity on both sides. 
---
People that play exclusively killer though will never come across a toxic killer and think they don't exist 
---
For what
---
Poor little guy.
---
30 seconds ain't shit worth time, honestly. 
---
It is super easy to faceoff with a person who wants to take the hatch if someone else is still alive, you only need to wait 30 seconds before it closes again. 
---
If they happen to be the last survivor, then you're just stuck at a regular hatch standoff, and at that point, I just swing for my 300 points and end the match. 
---
There we go. I knew ripping the head off a survivor didnt have enough *spectacle* to it
---
Thank you all for the input. It’s very much appreciated even more excited to try him with some of these set ups 
---
No, I suppose not. In my personal experience, I get semi-competent teammates consistently, so I rarely have to worry about NOED 
---
Have to worry a lot about Haunted Grounds tho
---
Thanks, finally someone who actually has more than 2 brain cells.
---
Nurse's Calling, Overcharge, and BBQ&amp;Chili are what I went for first. I now have every killer at level 50, except two of them are P1 L50.
---
No idea how he missed that last swing... Probably anticipating another big spin 
---
By that logic, I imagine you believe toolboxes with speed bonus addons are unfair?
---
It's an ultra rare item. You are also guaranteed a hit, a down, or even a grab if someone is desperate. If those 30 seconds (that would probably be spent chasing otherwise) are going to make or break your game, I'd say that comes down to effective planning from the survivors' side (again, probably tied to mic comms)
---
There's an easy solution, just remove the hatch. There's zero reason to give a pity escape to the last survivor.
---
Good when played correctly. Trash when not.
---
I play on pc. My connection is good enough that I doubt that all 4 dc’ed because it was in fact a rolling dc rather than all four at once
---
I literally played against a leatherfaces with 850 hours in game or something like that  
---
He was P3  
---
When he downed anyone that game he just facecamped them with their chainsaw on all the time  
---
He had an open steam profile  
---
He had 200 pages of comments on it  
---
All of it were survivor salt giving him minus reps, calling him toxic, etc  
---
But he didnt care  
---
He just kept camping  
---
This is the person I worship  
---
10/10
---
Ebonies, keys, and instaheals are very very powerful. What makes them balanced is the fact that you won't be seeing them in very game. 
---
Nurse's Calling (Nurse) and Overcharge (Doctor) were both incredibly useful when I started. Not only are they useful in game, but the healing auras and skill check fails will teach you how survivors play. Like the places they like to go to heal and how soon after leaving a gen they will get back on it. Very useful for teaching you some basic tactics.
---
What? Being able to get an exhaustion perk multiple times in a chase was busted.
---
This, to everyone else. 
---
Since the god damn hook changes even I hate the game as a killer because I swear to god I’ll down someone and there will be no hooks for miles around on the bottom floor, and trying to get upstairs and make it to a hook in time is painful and sometimes impossible depending on where I’ve downed them
---
You got the karma tho

---
Imagine if that cunt actually showed up to someone's house and taunting them like "Baby Killer", and then someone walks out with a gun, "This isn't the game, son, I'm not limited to a shitty bonesaw."
---
literally me sometimes i can’t sleep knowing the shrine is resetting or i’ll be really restless 
---
No, because it required skill to last 80 seconds in a chase. (because running made exhaustion recover slower)
---
This is why I don't bother with hatch standoffs. If we're both there I'll wait a little and then I'll jump. If you grab me, you grab me. I'm not going to hang around for half an hour just to get 7k. What a waste of time.
---
I wouldn't waste time capping any killers until you've unlocked all the perks you want. Itll cost way more BP in the long run. My biggest regret was levelling my doctor to 50 before unlocking BBQ🤦🏻‍♂️.  OP, spend some time getting a load of killers to 35, get the teachables before you get carried away with one killer 
---
So you’re a duck about my post
---
Some of your choices don’t make sense. Some of the killers don’t match the tier you put them in. 
---
We decided to just add more shit to the pile.
---
Welcome to the family Switch.
---
And why's that? If they are on the hatch already then just do generators, if you're chased to the hatch then you were already caught and this system would punish you for that.
---
Tried so hard, and got so far. 
---
In the end, it didn't even matter. 
---
This is my guess as well. 
---
SWF, thanks to comms, get free aura perks and provide map wide surveillance and data to others in the Squad. Solos can never reach their potential. Hence the common stereotype of solo teammates being potatoes. It's not that they suck it's that they have no idea what other survivors and the killer are doing as they would if they were in a SWF squad. 
---
The devs won't remove SWF because that would kill the game so the only solution is to buff solos and killers accordingly to meet their level. 
---
"Skill" Yeah, because looping is so hard. /s 
---
I'm glad exhaustion got nerfed.
---
That stuff was kind of obnoxious to go against, but the change was needed so it wasn't a useless perk to get on the bloodweb for some people. It's really not that bad of a perk, midtier mostly.
---
I think you're just unlucky then.
---
I do this if I'm dominating the game. At some point its like dunking on kids.
---
I mean I can see the frustration but it would lead to unwinnable situations where a survivor would be forced to kill themselves.
---
Shouldnt legion be orange? Also im not 100% but wasnt spirt forced too
---
The generic "survivor requires no skill" excuse. When it clearly does going against competent killers. 
---
You forgot to put nea in.
---
I played a daily for nurse to kill one survivor yesterday and ran this build. Dying light, bbq, pop goes the weasel, and devour hope. 
---
I brought an ivory mori and went straight to find the obsession.  I blink to the farthest gen from me and find 3 survivors.  David runs straight at me and I notice the entitys spiderlegs dancing. Its 30 seconds in and I already have the obsession. I down him and hook him.   Blink to the gen they were working on and regress it to 0.  He  gets saved as the first gen is done on the other side of the map.  I blink back to find him getting healed and down him again.  (The degenerate move) and instantly mori him.  DL kicks in and then I proceed to nurse around the map until I get 5 stacks of DH.  The map is the new ski lodge and the survivors cant find my totem.  At this point the second gen pops.  I hook each remaining survovior up until death hook and mori 2 of them when they would have been on death hook.
---
I'm voting this was my most degenerate strategy so far. 
---
That’s impressive! So you’re saying practice makes perfect, I guess :)
---
&gt; I imagine you believe toolboxes with speed bonus addons are unfair?
---
Toolboxes with speed add-ons assist in getting the gates powered. Keys totally subvert the primary objective of survivors. That's different.
---
&gt; It's an ultra rare item.
---
Relevance?
---
&gt; You are also guaranteed a hit, a down, or even a grab if someone is desperate.
---
hits/downs (there is no difference between these two things in this scenario because the survivor(s) escape whether or not they are healthy or injured upon the hit) are kibble points. who cares?
---
any survivor who has gone up more than a few ranks knows not to try and jump into the hatch if the killer is at it as well
---
&gt; If those 30 seconds (that would probably be spent chasing otherwise) are going to make or break your game, I'd say that comes down to effective planning from the survivors' side (again, probably tied to mic comms)
---
It would be spent chasing a survivor as the remaining one just goes over to the hatch to jump out without deserving it
---
And it does not take effective planning to do 4 gens. Please.
---
Even in your extremely biased scenario two survivors got an escape by subverting the objective
---
So you try to be a dick because I didn’t know this
---
Playing as Doctor with any "Restraint" add on is pretty much guaranteeing this.
---
Now, theoretically, the survivors should eventually notice that the fake doctors last longer than a second and make the connection that the killer can see them and so shouls collide with the illusion to break it ASAP.
---
What it turns into instead is that they ignore them, leave behind a trail of what are essentially huge yellow arrows pointing me to where they are, and I either flush them out with the static field or just straight up find them.
---
Bonus point for when I notice a fake doctor pops up in the same area 2 or 3 times, and when I get closer they stop spawning completely. Check all the lockers in that tile = "FUCKING HACKER, YOU HAD NO REASON TO CHECK THAT LOCKER"
---
The Spirit only wanted revenge on her father, the entity forced her into killing others.
---
Feels dirty though
---
Looping really isn't that hard though, lmao. And I won't be distracted from your original argument. Exhaustion should have been nerfed and it's a good thing that it was.
---
But it's still good.
---
cry moron
---
How is someone trying to discuss the strength of a killer being a "troll". Just because someone doesn't agree with popular opinion doesn't make them a troll. It makes them a person who wants to have you know, a discussion. Did you even read what the post said?
---
cry.
---
he probably felt treated unfair for being the only one killed.
---
Which is understandable, but not reportable.
---
Tbh I do something similar in those games and just DC or go AFK is I See its only a 3v1
---
Farming as a killer i belive means sombody who hooks 1 person and camps them for the points of killing them. And they try to do it to all players.
---
Thank you so much! &lt;3
---
&gt; I tried for months to get my step sister into the game, yet try as hard as she could she kept dying, over and over and over. She couldn't get better, the skill ceiling was too high and she didn't have any fun.
---
This is one individual's experience. I have a friend who had the exact opposite experience. 
---
&gt; It's becoming easier and easier to play killer, and harder and harder to play survivor.
---
Blatantly untrue, and you're still failing to provide any examples. I've asked like 3 times now
---
&gt; However, if things keep up, we'll never get more new Survivors, which is detrimental to the long term health of this game
---
This is just mind boggling that you think this. People playing killer has been dropping off. This is why survivor lobbies are so long
---
just wait  until we get Servers, should stop stuff like that 
---
Was gunna say if she at least put boots on then maybe a cosplay.. But not really. 
---
Both scenarios are a loss for killers. 4k is the win a 3k is like taking 2nd place in a contest and some little shit sneaking into the first place spot for free
---
*If* the killer knows how to mind game, *if* ypu actually fall for them. It goes both ways. Having exhaustion recover when you ran was too strong.
---
nvm I read it wrong
---
I see so many posts about hatch standoffs across all social media platforms. I have had one standoff that lasted 20-30sec. How do so many people get into them? I don't get it, nor do I understand people who participate in it on either side. I'm sure, now that ive posted this, that every game I play tonight will be a standoff
---
Many thanks to yall, ill be working on my doctor next per your advice.
---
I think the same thing, but hey, if I actually wanted to NONE would have escaped. Most of the time when a similar situation happens the survivors are usually grateful, but not this time. 
---
So... camping = farming?
---
I think that it should be something else, but I honestly have no idea.
---
Teaser should be out tomorrow 
---
I like the idea of earning a mori through the game, like, maybe 4 hooks earns a Cypress, 6 an Ivory, and 8 and Ebony
---
ye, I can unterstand if they arent greatful tbh, cause im at a point where BP arent that important to me (except Killer add ons) and I feel like I lost if the Killer decided to let me go, even if I know I didnt deserve it
---
Wow, i didn't expect that. Thank you!! I'll think about that.
---
Get the main perks you want them upgrade your main killer to P3 then unlock the other perks. That way you can get the perks you want quicker
---
Need more dirt
---
Thought the nurse was also forced by the entity and that’s why she gently rubs your face. Like ik nurse went nuts but I don’t think she wanted to kill the survivors 
---
I have a question: my internet isn't the greatest, and I've been accused of lag-switching many times, even thought they either didn't look at the ping in the lobby (I think it happened twice: people were accusing me and when I asked the lobby's ping, someone else said that it was really high) or it actually was a lag spike.   
---
However, there have been times where I've questioned if someone was using it. Is there a way I can tell apart if it's just bad connection/distance from the killer's location or if it's actually lag switching? 
---
i mean to be fair if they all dc'd why would they be in post game chat   
---
idk this doesn't seem like smile sunday material 
---
Uh... so first its legion now its doctor what next spirit and nurse? You forget survivors hold down one button and occasionally hit a new one and occasionally hold down the run button right? 
---
True, I did consider that. Though when I read her bio it said that blood and revenge was promised and she willingly agreed to that. Hence I put her in “Kills out of revenge and anger”.
---
sure he didnt just check your steam profile, a lot of kids have tried threatening me like this and i debunk their ass every time lmao
---
"incoming", I think
---
If the killer is smart he can turn mind gaming into a 50/50 guessing game just by hiding his red light if you don’t have visual on them. Also in quite a few cases now by the time you see their red light they’ll have enough time to hit you in a vault or pallet drop that is part of the loop
---
You have to be a really damn good survivor to continually infinite a killer and a mediocre killer to catch even an above average survivor player on a couple loops
---
Saying there’s no skill to it is the dumbest thing I’ve heard
---
Anything could happen. I also believe the PTB will be next week seeing as this week we have a Dwight outfit on the way.
---
Idk the words people use in this game confuse too i got the game for christmas lol
---
Can’t argue with that I guess 🤷‍♀️ 
---
I played as Bubba, caught two working on a gen and chainsawed them both, then hooked them, all in the first minute of the game. THEN noticed it was 2 to 1. I felt lime such a dick. They didn't even DC. Just died. 
---
Legion is 100% Orange and Spirit was pretty much Forced as well, as a vengeful Spirit should be at peace after its revenge, which the entity stops her from
---
Not trying to be mean, but why Thrill of the Hunt? Personally, slightly delaying Ruin's cleansing doesn't really do much and it's better to get an edge during the chase, like using enduring. 
---
If you're chasing someone for 80 seconds, you might
---
Be Tunnelling
---
Unaware that you should break off of someone if you can't catch them for that long
---
Be chasing the last survivor
---
Basically, if you're chasing someone for almost what one generator is worth (or 3 if all of the other survivors are working on seperate gens) it's entirely on you and they deserve that little boost for keeping you occupied for THAT long.
---
But there isn't lmao.
---
Yeah legion is a hard one. Frank does have a desire to kill, though the others are driven purely by Frank. So yeah you could put them in another category. If I would get more specific I’d say Frank kills out of pleasure and the others out of fear for Frank.
---
U get bloodpoints for kills so some people farm that by camping it for 100% kill just for points
---
And when you ask them about the ping in the lobby they get mad! I just can't
---
That's not accurate at all. Farming is when everyone just earns points with each other without the killer actually trying to kill people. Camping in no way equals farming. This person is wrong.
---
Regardless of what the killer is doing. The survivor shouldn't be able to loop the killer for that long with exhaustion perks popping every so often. It's a good thing it got changed. 
---
Ace is an "aging 50s movies star" (IE he looks around 50 and is probably older)

---
Nobody (with half a brain) ever said that ebony mori's are fair. And they shouldn't be. The obsession the community has with "fairness" in an asymmetrical versus game full of RNG is hilarious to me.
---
Good post though.
---
Dead By Daylight...That's your reason. 
---
EAC Bugged killer lobbies is a thing, it doesn't mean he was cheating.  
---
whenever you see a lobby stuck at 3 people, it's usually because someone left randomly, but for a while it was because this error message would pop up at random and bug lobbies. 
---
What do you mean regardless of what the killer is doing? The killer is choosing to follow them, the killer is making the bad decision to keep following them. It's not a good thing, it artificially lowered the survivor skill ceiling. It was unnecessary, bad map design is the only reason that survivors could possibly run the killer for that long, apart from the killer's own skill level.
---
I'd fucking buy 20 if they added a Spirited Away skin for Wraith.
---
People would call me a weeb but I don't fucking care.
---
A Blink limit isn't such a bad idea.
---
Let people enjoy stuff
---
Devour Hope exists. Too bad it gets cleansed because totem spots are still directly up survivors asses half the time.
---
Its an addiction
---
Can you jog my memory because I don't remember this thread LOL.
---
No it only works while you are in the injured state
---
I mean exactly that. It goes both ways. The killer shouldn't be chasing that long, but neither should the survivor be able to loop for that long. It's a great thing, because it denies survivors that ability and makes it a little more balanced. That's the last I'm going to say to this thread, I'm tired of repeating myself.
---
I freaking wish but nope, you just grunt and groan telling the killer exactly where you are. I’ve had tenacity pull a couple awesome saves but reducing the sounds would basically make it meta
---
McDonalds.
---
so basically you're offering no solution and are telling people to throw games, lmao ok, does not apply to people trying to actually win so...
---
I think the funny part is you think people on this sub will disagree with the point you are making.
---
Thanks. A bloody Quentin would know XP
---
While speed is good about the spirit, remember that the loadout doesn't have prayer beads. A smart survivor would either hear the wooshing or tap the Thrill to make an alert and bait the killer. If you're in a chase while the totem is being cleansed, you won't be able to save it anyway. Unless you have 2 hex perks aside from it, it's really not worth it. Especially if both are found at the same time, it becomes a 50/50 shot of whether Ruin dies or not. 
---
No one thinks swf is fair or balanced on this sub.  *At best* people are willing to say they want to play with their friends because duh.
---
I have 243 Emergency med-kits. They are my babies :D
---
just put your controller down gently lol
---
That's fine cause most of the gaming industry is screwing PC anyway XD
---
Rarity is relevant. I do not care to continue arguing as our ideas of what a rare item should do differ greatly. 
---
I bared it for as long as I could. The lack of players at lower ranks was the final straw for me. I didn't mind the 30fps or the low res graphics as long as I could play. Once that became an issue, I bought on PC and won't be playing on this gen of consoles anymore. 
---
Boring ass video. 
---
Will always do this if I can but please don't throw a fit and I have to use the maze tile your gen is in.
---
Key is the only time the hatch ISN’T bullshit.
---
also actually buff it to apply to hooks, not the """Buff""" they did to apply to hook where you can still see where they get hooked
---
no
---
also these are really good ideas
---
Like legion?
---
Are u from tumblr
---
That’s your decision- you shouldn’t do that. If you’re going to use voice comms in a game designed to be played without them, don’t act like you’re less of a scumbag for saying you give mercy kills.
---
Interestingly one could argue for Amanda to be in all three of the middle tiers. She did doubt that people would change through John's tests, therefore rigging some tests in the movies. I would interprete that as gaining pleasure out of killing (but also for what she believes to be the greater "good"). This can also be interpreted as killing out of anger (for these "bad" people), and she also very much fits the description of killing out of insanity. I guess placing her in the middle is alright though, as her twisted sense of morality isn't quite the same as what doc is doing.
---
focusing on protecting gens is somehow degenerate? isn't that the killers objective? if the survivors 3 gen themselves whats a killer to do?
---
Trapper should be orange, he was a tyrant
---
"Everytime your obsession is hit you gain x/x/x on your lunge" "when you hit your obsession you lose x/x on your lunge" what???
---
That's just IMO. I just believe that hatch standoffs are just too small a problem to make a major change to gameplay.
---
how generic
---
Oink.
