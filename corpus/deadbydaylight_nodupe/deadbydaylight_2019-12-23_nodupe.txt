Yeah we’ve all been there. Chat was nice!
---
Yeah I don't think they would add anything that would do with that level of grind anymore as going from 1 to 50 in the new system was the same as going from 1 to 10 in the old blood web so basically try and hit rank 50 on 5 survivors and that's how long people had to grind for it lol
---
If it's too hard just bring bloody streamers and try be friends with the survivors to get them on hook.

When legion in frenzy is running towards already injured me
---
Also, he should not run into corners like how he did in the first clip
---
I agree. BBQ is mainly used for it's BP bonus and you are forced to take it because of that and not it's actual power. It steals room for other interesting perks
---

Now you're speaking my language

---
Could be difficult to balance so he should only be able to use it once a game. And the expolsion radius should be &lt;3km
---
True. But. And I realize this is a big but. You could have likely gotten him out of it.
---
Says a guy who delivers food via phone app.
---
I’m a bit scared about dedicated servers because I’ve seen a lot of bad things about it. However lag switching is a major issue on PS4, so at least that won’t be a thing anymore. 
---
DC penalty cant come soon enough. Literally the only time I depip usually is when my team mates DC immediately because they don’t like the killer or the map.
---
No.
---
I realize I shouldn’t take these so seriously but it was likely a pip loss. Which can be disheartening sometimes. Especially when you get to a new rank and then immediately lose it after. But, it can be gained back which is probably where everyone else’s head is at.
---
What would that be i wonder
---
Ye
---
This looks amazing! Though her elbow looks a little funny, ngl
---
I talk to people in that game the same way id want others to talk to me, it usually helps since everyone is salty all the time
---
not really. pretty common actually. in fact, the only person who would potentially be reportable would be your teammate, but if they tried to help you and got denied by the killer, that’s not reportable either. 
---
the ranking system is rough, but if it makes you feel better that killer will probably run into a super-toxic four man swf running OoO and 4 DSes to avenge you next game
---
When life gives you lemons... you don’t just toss the lemons into the trash
---
*sips lemonade*
---
But in all seriousness, me and my one SWF probably would’ve tried to help him, but as you can see there wasn’t much time to do so. Not like he was doing anything toxic to deserve such a brutal glitch
---
Every Aura reading perk is great on huntress.
---
IAE, BBQ, BM, NC etc.
---
Lmao! I never understood the salt when the crybabies start spewing nonsense like this. Like yeah I've had bad games, yeah I've been tunneled or face camped. Yes it's not fun and sucks but you know what? Queue up and move the fck on. I swear I feel like idiots get their egos inflated bullying low rank/newer killers that when they do die or get paired with a decent/good killer, they get sticks up their asses and the death threats cancer etc. spews.
---
Yes, I lost all of the cosmetics from those two events, even the ones given out for free.
---
At this point I just play the game for fun, I ignore my fellow gamers hate and made up rules, when you do that you’ll have a much better time.
---
I really need to check out your videos for trapper tips.
---
if you are trying to kill 4 survivors, DCs count as killing, so if you can get a 4 DC it also counts
---
I agree with this. Just my brother and I as a duo destroy hags like this. One of us sets off traps that we know about while others are in chase. If we take agro we swap. Her traps are deadly but easy to get rid of. Unless its rusty shackles hag, then shit got real.
---
Absolutely.
---
Next Halloween they are 100% getting matching Hallowed Blight outfits.
---
That sounds actually pretty fun.
---
well if your standing on the other side of the windows, you can still be hit
---
No trust me lol I know a lag switch vs bad internet. I had a wraith the other day, game was fine, no lagging at all until he was in a chase with someone. Then the whole lobby lagged and the person went down. Same thing happened to me when he chased me. 
---
Also had a legion chasing me, everyone lags and suddenly I’m right next to him. He also lag switched when people were on struggle hook so they stop struggling because of the lag. 
---
Normal game lag because of bad killer internet is instant, you load in, move around and instantly you see it’s lagging. These games weren’t like that, they were great until the killer was in a crucial stage like a chase or hook etc. Could be coincidence but I’m sceptical.
---
Why?
---
Killer does his job...better wish death and cancer on the player! :P
---
I’ve been playing really shitty the last few weeks after not playing much for a couple months and have literally been boosted to rank 6 from 10 by the horrible matchmaking throwing me up against brown ranks who’ve probably played less hours totals than I have in binge sessions, I get that sometimes maybe they need to have unbalanced games to keep queue times down but surely not as much as they have recently.
---
Yeah like every killer /s
---
Maybe. Is there any math on this? It doesn’t seem to up the skill checks enough to negate the extra speed of the toolbox. I’ve been able to complete a Ruin Gen before with only two skill checks before.
---
Time for the horrible grind.
---
Good thing buying that battle pass early on helps.
---
Edit: “/s”
---
This comment was clearly a joke.
---
Someone violently squatting would also come across as rude to me in real life tbh
---
I haven’t seen any comment here that tackles the thought process of why somebody might actually think that survivors gen rush. I think I have an idea though. The whole gen rushing thing is similar to the old tryharding thing. The killer may want a somewhat chill game but then ruin pops in 30 seconds and 2 gens are completed shortly after. They may feel that even though gen rushing is the optimal strategy, it shouldn’t be done because the game is somewhat casual. This applies to killers to in some situations.
---
For example; if a killer sees somebody unhook a survivor, and knows the DS/BT isn’t in play, the optimal thing would to be go for the guy who just got unhooked. The survivor is already injured, getting one person out of the game quickly lowers the survivors’ human resource a lot, etc. Even though it’s the optimal thing to do in that situation; the killer may go for other guy because he understands getting tunneled by the killer is no fun for the other side. Similar to how getting genrushed to oblivion isn’t fun for the killer. 
---
There is one really big difference between the 2 situations though. The killer has 2 choices (tunnel or chase the other guy) that end up giving a somewhat fun and interactive experience. For a survivor who isn’t being chased, there is nothing for them to do besides gens and todems. Which is the biggest flaw behind the genrushing thought process.
---
I’ve noticed this because I’ve seen people say it so much now lol.
---
He was. And he found that if you are chasing a survivor, hitting them with one bottle before swinging and hitting them does absolutely nothing.
---
Oh I understand that. I’m saying I’ve Rank 17 _killers_ with all the maxed perks. Perhaps they just deranked on purpose.
---
I’ve been killing the others and it’s not popped?
---
Do I need all 4 to DC?
---
I’ll ask pre game see of I can find a 4 man that will all dc once the game starts if that’s the case.
---
Getting sick of these kids
---
I do have a nasty habit of headed for the edge, so this is for sure something I can work on thanks!
---
If they get rid of Master challenges I might buy another rift pass
---
You can learn to grow out of being shit talked, and if not, just mute endgame chat. People who criticize you for doing what you're supposed to be doing are just a lower life form than you. They treat you like dirt basically  because they are literally lower than dirt.
---
its not just on the killer side bud.
---
The reason why you are "forced" to run meta perks is bc its a 1v4. Honestly most of the time you just need to run decent perks. 
---
Low tier killers need buff obi, but you can still do really well with them. i main wraith and do perfectly fine in red ranks. 
---
sure i get toxic people, but i am on multiple killer "black list" and i have had many killers harass me, BM me, and just be a general dick head just bc i have beat them in the past.
---
Just recently i had an IRI head huntress come to my stream and spam racial slurs bc i escaped through hatch after all my teamates left.
---
Just got it today and it's been awesome so far.....also the fact it's half off and same with most the dlcs right now in the ps store, it'd be a great time to hop in.
---
Even the Joker doesn’t mess with the IRS.
---
Just don't take it that seriously. This is not a competitive game, or at least it shouldn't be with the number of balance issues, deceptively high amount of RNG factors, and essentially no ELO system.
---
I always thought the tradition for thanking a killer for gg was to leave an item at the exit gate?
---
I just dont take it seriously and play my best. I do pretty well that way
---
His recent videos are all tips on "I"m all ears" so... you have a lot you can learn watching him without even touching the trapper.
---
And then there was the meme strat of overcharge Freddy, where you could regress an entire gen by just kicking it, putting someone to sleep, having them blow it up, and repeat.
---
I thought he’d for sure seen you when he came back to the window.
---
Plays fortnite. Blames kids for ruining his games. 
---
Lol
---
Can I have it?
---
Why did you not save him ;(
---
Nono. Thats not a baby rank 17 killer. That is someone who has just not played in a bit, That build is way 2 perfect to be a rank 17. 
---
They even have discordance one.
---
In my experience a couple of months ago they were the best they’ve ever been on PS4. Could find games almost instantly.
---
And here we’ve found one of the toxic kids who D/C. Congratulations
---
I think the biggest comment people have been mentioning is my habit of heading toward the edge so I will for sure work on that.
---
Cool. Point’em our and I’ll make sure to do nothing.
---
Why does that help?
---
the DC counts as killing a survivor, so if 2 DC and you mori 2 it should work
---
It doesn’t help
---
mmmm whatcha saaaay
---
u/teddbjoern

Turn off messages and not take the game seriously. I'm here to have fun, not rank up and get all sweaty.
---
Only Blendettes burn those
---
I bought it day 1. :p
---
God forbid someone innocently come onto the SubReddit and post a picture without knowing who/where/when it was created and whether or not it was a Repost.
---
I know people hate seeing recycled content, but not everyone posting here surfs the Sub-Reddit obsessively 24/7. Some people just find a funny image online and share it just because. Downvoting everything he’s posting just because he didn’t know that is just childish as hell. He’s got 400 Upvotes so obviously people found it funny and weren’t bothered by the fact that somebody used this image before.
---
I hate the hive mind of this Sub sometimes. I can’t imagine sitting on Reddit and scrolling through this Sub consistently enough to be able to pinpoint and filter out anything you deem as a ‘repost’. Maybe take a break from Reddit for a while if you’re that upset.
---
Yo this is a pretty good build too! It’s my opinion that any “unstoppable” perk is really good on trapper, like brutal strength or agitation. And sloppy helps you to gain back some of that precious trap setting time.
---
Omg, my heart can’t take this kinda pain!!!!
---
Yeah it does feel like that with legion, even worse if he has sloppy butcher. He used to have two add ons that increased the mend timer and they stacked... so you’d be mending for like 5 minutes lmao!
---
Tell him playong ruin and BBQ Is equally toxic. like hitting the saved Survivor when you are near a potentiali unsafe hook and you can clearly go for the saviour.
---
Dwight wouldn’t tax evade, he’s too good 🥺
---
I can't believe people still complain about perk that IS necessary to even have a chance to win the game as a killer.
---
What rank are you, and did you play both sides?
---
Also was this right after rank reset.
---
Playtime is a major factor cuz I got to tier 70 before I completed the 3rd tome
---
Shaking my head
---
You'd be surprised how often i get these
---
Thats fucked up lmao
---
Outplayed git gud
---
Killer queues are usually pretty short in my experience. People don’t like getting bullied and prefer to take it easy playing survivor. That’s why it takes longer for survivor games. And why would you want someone to practice being a baby toxic? This is supposed to be a survival HORROR game, Not a bully simulator. People tend to forget that, devs included.
---
Non ruin greats surprisingly don’t give a massive speed boost despite how the bar looks when you hit a great. They give a 2% bonus which ends up only shaving off the total gen time by about 1.6 seconds per great. It seems like 6 or 7ish skill checks is what you will probably get on a non ruin gen. More than 10 is rare, so the survivor will save a little more than 10 seconds if they hit all greats. I was actually kind of surprised that the bonus is only 2% lol.
---
I made a comment, I'm not doing the downvoting. I'm sorry if I offended you, but I was just stating that it probably wasn't because it was an Xbox meme.
---
You can only get like half the Rift through challenges. Other half is grind.
---
Killer can kill me, I cant kill him. Goes without saying tbh.
---
This sounds weird but I get into character. I pretend I am that particular killer. I probably sound like a physcopath but trust me I'm not 100% physcopath
---
Technically nobody “owes” you anything. If people decide to cooperate with you and allow you to do whatever Rift/Trial/Daily you need to, you should just consider that lucky. 
---
People are just trying to play the game and might not care about your free Bloodpoints/Rift Fragments at the time. Getting mad or frustrated at them for not doing what you told them to isn’t helping anyone. Just play the game and wait for the next one.
---
Overall, your jukes look good. A tip in case you weren't using it already, holding the joystick in the opposite direction you're moving will make you spin faster. What I did notice though, is that it seems that you've used shack pallet when there are 5 generators left. Under no circumstances, do this.
---
&gt; slow the game down
---
...just a little bit.
---
i'm so used to doing it as thanks i sometimes do it to a killer and end up hastily apologising in the chat
---
when i'm killing, if it's just one bounce i'll generally assume it's friendly, but context also helps a lot. i think it's fairly easy to tell if someone's talkin shit or being a pal in most situations
---
W8 nvm one dc and one death shack pallet being used was k
---
Thx captain obvious that would be the collision I mentioned
---
4% is still better than 1%
---
Seriously though more often than not ruin gets Destroyed within 1 minute of the match that is flat out BS and sometimes the spawn points ends up being broken and unfair for survivors.
---
I love being able to catch up to survivors while carrying another. Unfortunately this build kinda sucks on maps I can't get a good 3-gen going. Last night I played against 3 back to back 3man SWF (I checked their profiles) and got farm, farm, stranger things.
---
Unfortunately for the last guys I was pretty pissed off by then and had an ebony+2 purple add-ons. And the big room in the middle had 2 gens with only 3 exits. 
---
I feel like trapper could be far more consistent if he could hold 1 extra trap as a baseline, and perhaps if the yellow dye add-on darkened it a tiny bit more.
---
You could have saved him with disarming the trap at the right moment
---
So people can’t have fun together on the game because it makes you unhappy ? 😂
---
100% stolen.
---
Whys that?
---
Yes, and then when they slowdown for a second you start the heal and they break the heal a few times after you've started it.
---
What does PWYF mean?
---
You can run in a certain direction and when BBQ finishes do 180° and run in that direction.
---
You say that, but dedicated servers are ridiculous. It brought back several old bugs and hitboxes are all over the place . I've never seen so many bull hits. On top of that dc penalty is kind of a nightmare. It wont stop the users who want to dc from doing so and when your game crashes or you get dced by accident, it punishes you for. It's bad enough to the point where if my game crashes, I just fuck off and play something else because i'm not waiting that time.
---
imagine
---
[Laughs in Stakeout]
---
Hmm... Neat but that's from an artist on instagram, aviary.art if I remember correctly... And it's fairly recent too, so someone made a shirt out of it for themselves and then immediately donated it? That makes no sense lmao
---
You can disarm the glitched trap
---
Considering how fucked up the match making is and who low rank players can easily go around high rank players doing that right now isnt the best idea
---
Omg I had a Meg do this earlier. Unhooked her, she RAN across the map, I followed her for a good minute and a half, just running... I start healing her and she keeps breaking the heal, several times. I gave up and went to do something else and she had the AUDACITY to follow me and teabag for a heal... I TRIED HOE YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE! Begone.
---
I think about the BP I'm getting. Slap on NOED if it gets too rough.
---
Obviously Dedication Servers have their problems, but so does P2P and I'd rather takes the ladders problems.
---
Play With Your Food.
---
Michael's level 35 teachable perk.
---
Whenever you lose chase with your obsession gain a stack, up to 3 stacks, to increase your movement speed by 3/4/5% each.
---
You lose a stack every time you perform an offensive action.
---
Anyone who believes this isn't a Clown main, they ARE the Clown.
---
Yesterday I had a feng that kept breaking the heal and then she did the crouched come here emote and broke it again, I dropped the medkit on the ground and said irl "Fuck this shit, heal yourself, I'm doing a fucking gen."
---
I'll often pop the gen from hitting the check too early when trying to do the check. Sometimes I'll go for safety, sometimes I'll do speed, depends on my loadout and the killer
---
No idea, I would like to know the answer to this as well, I love heard there’s a way for you to quit and keep your items.
---
Ice. Cold.
---
I wanna know what’s going through their minds. Just let me heal you it only takes a few seconds and you’ll be much better off just STOP PRESSING BUTTONS.
---
Losing my mind
---
Will someone please tell me why urban evasion is such a hated perk by killer mains!!  I use it and i may get downvoted for it but i am just curious to what has traumatized you so badly that you hate on it
---
*runs to edge of map immediately*
---
I turn off my console to avoid punishment and I only do that when bad internet keeps me from doing anything (AKA taking 5 seconds to start fixing gens after I press the button). That specific method can never be determined as my own dc because it could be a blackout. Most don’t have the patience to go through setting it up again either
---
Trapper was shook.
---
For some people their controller might be fucked, they have to click the sprint button at least to break it.
---
When you dont use rechargeable battery packs in 2019
---
Is putting “via phone app” supposed to make it sound like something a poor person would do. I’m pretty sure I need my own car, my own insurance, steady enough pay to put gas and keep up with car repairs if anything were to happen. Funny you have to look through a profile just to find an insult from something you started. Nice try. You’ll get em next time.
---
Cringe
---
I once got 69420 bp
---
Why would a Killer ever use a gun? That's literally just throwing balance in the trash. Yes, the Huntress exists, but using hatchets effectively takes actual effort.
---
 You  can also do this on Haddonfield
---
There’s literally nothing we can do , I get it can be frustrating but all they are trying to do is play the game like you and me .
---
God I just can’t do gems when ruin is up. It fucking crippled me. Not that’s it’s op or anything I just suck at it even though I’m decent rank
---
I get that, but why not just use another perk until you get a bit higher up? I find 5 gen games are harder to double Pip as people give up.
---
Very nice, you captured the style well!
---
O_o
---
Over-staturation at its finest. Where have you been there’s been like hundreds of ppl complaining about this already. I hate being that guy but this post really is just pointless we all already know it’s a problem that dbd’s been slacking on.
---
Most likely not.
---
Well that sucks. Would make the UI look so much nicer too.
---
My point is being able to see ranks, the unbalance part is just a plus
---
All items are in the shop forever. Event items, such as those for Moonrise or the Hallowed series, are avaliable for auric cells rather than the event-specific currency.
---
Tome 4 has some pretty major hints.
---
Exactly, literally just want that Claudette head and then I’m done with it.
---
Ok? You made the choice to save, he made the choice to leave. We all need to stop coaching eachother on how to play forreal.
---
I love the hive mind of Reddit downvoting to disagree. Why is it your job to be nice when a bug happens? Shit I see hitboxes beyond broken and not many people leave them on the ground. They just keep playing.
---
I mean, it’s console. The only way I avoid getting 360’d is by having my sensitivity at 100% and spinning with both my camera and movement analog sticks in one direction
---
Even then it’s 50/50 because of the frame drop
---
I do get how they could go in to a game thinking ‘fuck it I’m just leaving if I get the chance’ after many many bad games but then if their team really go out of their way to save them and are really altruistic then how could they not change their mind and at least try to help? 😔
---
that would be dope asf, they made tomie skins on Identity V
---
Yes
---
Some of the terminology in DBD is confusing, in this case, "powered" means the gates are ready to be opened. But you need to interact with the exit gate for x amount of seconds to open it.
---
OMG!!!😱😱😱
---
In a way? Dude, this is Internet and you're making things up in your head and proceed to get offended. He never said we or us or anything implying more than himself.
---
The experience did evolve but it still gave some jump scares and still had an overall dread feel. I see what you are saying though
---
I was in a chase with someone and I tried to go through that spotting hopping to cut them off... and i got stuck in hoch extended the chase.
---
Yeah this was the case. Plus the guy has like over 2k hours. Like really?
---
Hey the icon link stopped working again. I would love to download it so is there any way you could post another?
---
loose weight fatass
---
Ehhhh, close. Mostly Pig and Ghost-face with a little Demodoggo
---
That's a shitty attitude tho. He made a choice to leave when he could have saved. If he had no chance then fine but this was bullshit. Also if everybody had the attitude of leaving team mates survivor games would become hell
---
I’d fucking leave at that point
---
well for one, its much harder to time a good 360 with M &amp; K since you actually have to quickly press WASD or WDSA with a swift mouse movment.
---
All you do on console is move 2 sticks.
---
Right but they can leave through hatch. So closing the hatch gives them an advantage. 2 exits 1 guard. Leaving the hatch also gives them the advantage, they can just leave.
---
So what’s the right choice. How do you possibly guard both spots when you don’t have any gameplay elements to interact with since everything accelerated to end game by closing the hatch.
---
I love running quick and quiet + dance with me. I'm assuming that makes the combo useless when it's not on CD?
---
My thoughts exactly. I see so many people commenting about not caring about the “survivor rulebook” (primarily just no tunneling or camping). I’m not responding to most of them because I didn’t even have time to try anything (he left so quickly) and it’s not like I caused it or am obligated to do so. I probably would’ve helped him because I play killer too and that’d be annoying, but there is quite a double standard here lol
---
.....he wanted to leave dude. Its ok.
---
I know, that's why I tagged them so they could see it.
---
if you close the hatch, they cant open it back up without a key. watching the gates is easier because of how long it takes to open the doors, plus you can hear and see how close they are to being opened because of the lights and sound the doors play
---
I think he means jason no stun. So a walking tank
---
That I understand, but how are you supposed to play this scenario. If I close the hatch they win, if I leave it open, they can win unless I sit there and do nothing but camp the hatch. 
---
What’s the intended gameplay.
---
We all love you otz
---
Jeeeez. Anyone whose played for more than a week knows surviving isn’t the be all and end all anyway.
---
r/TILI
---
That's just a blendette.
---
Story of this challenge sadly....
---
I am playing for fun... I just played my first game. I don’t understand a word you just said. I don’t know BBQ? or any of those perks. I was playing the bunny mask lady, idk if she can have nurses calling.
---
Yellow mori-Lets you kill the last remaining survivor
---
Green mori-Kill one survivor who has been already hooked once
---
Red mori-Kill all survivors who have been hooked once
---
Okay but imagine the ruins of Kurozu-chō as a map
---
It’s your own fault for expecting a Bill to not be useless. They have that reputation for a reason.
---
This is the type of guy tho that will call out team mates if they don't save him but will bail at the first chance he gets. he's just a coward
---
The Sacrafice trailer shows The Spitter and Jockey so I'm going with they did face the L4D2 infected!
---
Yeah kinda true. Though i was expecting a bit more from a player with 2k+ hours
---
I keep a hit list of assholes to face camp. When someone on that list appears in my lobby, it feels so good. The post-game salt is even better.
---
Don't wanna get facecamped? Don't be an asshole, it really is that simple.
---
Reuploaded because I made the text timing better.

I didn't want to lose these amazing [comments](https://ibb.co/v42vRcH) though

Bikini Plague 😉
---
Idk why I try to rationalize with people who take this game so seriously lol. Have a good night dude, don't let it bother ya so much.
---
Does xbox have any controller that does require batteries or a wire all the time?

---
C O C K Y  S U R V I V O R S
---
Which they did immediately after I closed hatch. I B lined to the gate I thought they’d be at, no hesitation, and it was already open. The survivor was just teabagging waiting for me to get there and left when i got close enough. 
---
I not only found the hatch, I went to the appropriate gate, and I had 0 gameplay options to win the game. How are you supposed to play that scenario?
---
Finally the hatch update we need
---
Game has always been a pay2win scumbag cashgrab. BHVR does it because it works.
---
It's not only survivors who are toxic. The thing is there are 4 survivors per game but only 1 killer so the odds of finding a toxic surv are higher.
---
Bill is probably the only boomer con lmao
---
the flair did say rant. what were you expecting? me to come to realise his playstyle is okay? yes he can choose how he plays but if you play with the attitude he does nobody is gonna save anyone anymore.
---
And we hate having to run it.
---
I want to bad
---
you used to not be able to close the hatch and it was a standoff, its possible but its more beneficial in my opinion to close it.
---
i read you were playing huntress (rabbit mask and hums), who has the axes you can throw. what ive seen people who play her will find a spot in between the gates and watch them both (if possible). when you see someone on the exit gate lever, throw your hatchet or grab them off if you can get close enough to them. if you cant stand in between and see both the doors, youll need to walk back and forth and just watch. your ears are your best friend, listen for the beep and watch the red light on the exit gate, that tells you how close it is to being open. once all three are lit, its very close and the survivor can get out after a second or two more. if you need, see about getting the freddy (the nightmare) perk "remember me," each time you hit the obsession the door gains time it takes to open. im sure you can do it with some practice, dont get discouraged!
---
Where have you heard a killer main ever complaint about UE? I actually encourage the use of it. It's better than having survivors flick their flashlights at you then run through their 20 pallets.
---
Claudette as survivor for no particular reason, I just started leveling her up and kept playing as her.
---
For killer is Myers and Wraith, i love stealth killers, myers os not as stealthy as Mr bing bong but it's still a lot of fun
---
Who else reads trapper's dialogue in *that voice*?
---
Yeah I know, that’s why I’d didn’t include them in my post
---
This new killer buff is lookin great! 😎👍
---
Every killer is a loop able killer okay I’mma act like I didn’t read that.
---
Quentin and Detective Tapp, I usually don’t see either of them often but when I do I try to stick close by and help when they need it haha.
---
If you're unlucky like me and get like 10 skillchecks in a row you'd gen tap too
---
Its just from the 1xp per sec you get for playing (up to 540 per game) and the 300 xp you get from the first game on each side per day (which basically gives you 1 free game of xp per day if you play both). Every 800 xp gives a shard, 10 shards per rift level.
---
I use BBQ (for the 2x points) but never the others. I like Stridor a lot as most games at Red have IW users. MYC or Haunted is great, also STBFL :)
---
He forgot it in the upside down
---
Adam Francis, I love his perks and his brown trench coat is the stealthiest cosmetic in the game
---
Ah yes I hit all the greats and... I'm out of stake out tokens oh god oh fuck
---
Available at Walgreen's
---
Could have disarmed it, it isn't hard, but they didn't really have time, since they did the totem first.
---
That match where Oni brought Nemesis then respected pallets. 🤣🤣🤣
---
Oh wow you're right I legit remembered it as the last generator :/
---
&gt;Kurozu-chō
---
The town from Uzumaki? One straight line to the center? :P
---
That's adorable
---
or maybe BHVR should either delete ranks and just match people up with how well they do and skip the whole rank idea and make actual skill-based matchmaking if they want this game to be competitive OR fix the current one. 
---
I get the idea but at this point BHVR needs to get up or get off
---
Survivor: Dwight
---
I like his look and cosmetic. He’s not too visible while also not being P3 Blendette levels of “I am the bush.” And he makes less noise than most other survivors as well.
---
Killer: Plague
---
I like the gen protection style that Plague brings with her power. Survivors needing to make the choice to either [work on gen to stop the regression but get sick while doing so] or [stay off the gen for 35 seconds for the infection to pass, but let the generator regress that whole time].
---
o....oh
---
take my rocket toboggan award you intellectual.
---
Yes for tome lvl 4 lol
---
Wait what? This image was MADE and posted to this subreddit less than 2 months ago. You're telling me someone saw it, printed the design, and then donated it to goodwill already? That sounds fishy.
---
LOL Feelsbadman
---
Ruin is the bane of my existence
---
It’s a shame to have to run kindred when you could use the slot for something else, but I think that’s the best bet to stop this from happening.
---
I keep losing most of my ghostface games but I’m having more fun playing him than matches where I usually win
---
the betrayal hurts every time
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
I main Trapper for killer and Meg for survivor bc 1. I am trash and trash play meg this is a fact and 2. I like Otz and I like winning by mostly luck
---
Huntress' Mori animation is also amazing and these hatches with devour on is scary for me.
---
No
---
Photo credits to u/WIFIWONDER
---
Something similar happened with me once with a 2-man and a farming killer, except I had Bond+Open Handed.  I figured out what they were doing pretty quickly, and even helped to wrangle the last solo into the hatch area.
---
I made a post about me being overly happy for escaping hook at 4% by a face camping wraith and it got hated bc I was toxic for saying "get fucked" bc well he got fucked and I tbagged bc fuck him
---
brutal😂
---
OMG I LOVE IT
---
I did that for someone yesterday as Trapper. I'm trying to help people get Left For Dead achievement, alas, too many camp the hatch so its hard to help. Its nice when they understand what you're trying to do. 😎
---
Next killer confirmed to be Irwin R. Schyster
---
Gotta make sure Bing Bong Boi is safe he could get hurt

I'm loving my Dwelf #SaveElfDweet
---
I love everything about Hag but I can't win a single game as her every time I give it a shot. Trap based killers are just not my style. I want to be good at Hag but I just can't even though I like her.
---
I wonder if something similar happened when Legion was brought in.
---
Legion sees other killers always getting looped and they say something akin to Why not just jump over the pallets?
---
Has to be someone's fetish.
---
Very well done, Mate. Be proud.
---
I love that. I've even trained my dog now to 'boop the snoot'. He'll touch your nose with his 😍
---
EIRRI has done a tooooon more DBD stuff, ill translate more as time goes on
---
Im guessing rank 18ish?
---
Now i'm imagining wraith acting like a cat trying to fit in boxes and stuff
---
I think you fail to see my point. You cannot disable a trap if she is chasing you or she catches up. If she puts traps in smart locations you won't find them until you are running from her.
---
Its like saying nurse isn't S tier because you can juke her.
---
I have just read about people complaining about it through various posts...i was even in a party once with someone who said he mori'd people who use UE
---
The only issue is see with him not being able to do that is that it could created broken 1 sided scenarios. He definitely should get a temporary immunity to the traps though.
---
I find your username highly relevant to your comment.
---
Silence virgin
---
It looked like he didn't even run into it at the beginning though. It seemed to teleport or something when he tried to walk around it. I don't know how this glitch works or anything though so could just be d-sync
---
Enjoy all the problems of p2p with an additional latency handicap
---
Oh boo-fucking-hoo.
---
Why did I not expect this shit. What the fuck
---
They said they aren't bothering with running events again as they can't sell them.
---
Still half of level 4 left and been done with the rift for 2 weeks
---
Yea no, literally no one says they dont want an event effecting game play.
---
i can't tell if its funnier imagining the fourth panel where the entity just deletes the blockage and they just go "Oh" because thats what the trapdoor does to everything above it when it spawns in. Traps and bodys just get deleted from the game.
---
It’s really hard to tell at this point anymore. Is it just the game shit connections? Or is it a lag switcher? Could be either one at this point. And sadly a lot of the time, it IS a lagswitcher.
---
isnt there a punishment to DCs?
---
Don't lie, you love it, you know you do
---
Just started around 10 days ago... only at lv26... This seems impossible for me maybe, unless I go ham on this game the next 16 days

I only bought the pass after I made it to tier 64, because it had the cool David King shirt.
---
You're fine other than chasing the person who got unhooked and then hooking them and repeating that until they're dead, but it doesn't matter, you play how you want to.
---
Psychopath (I’m so sorry I could help it lol 😂)
---
I'm pretty sure it's going to be implemented soon if it hasn't already
---
Yeah, they have a shit ton of custom prints there. My fiance got a slightly off-center "me and the boys" shirt within 2 weeks of the meme blowing up.
---
Or you could hit your greats. Or find the totem. Or stop working for 2-3 seconds after a good skill check because it stops the progression anyway. It honestly just makes you better at hitting skill checks. Just work through the ruin
---
Thank /u/Aurarus for that, he was the champ who outlined everything.
---
I had never seen it before until today, weird stuff.
---
No rank 4
---
As I commented earlier, there is an unusually massive amount of very modern shirts there.
---
Suck a dick
---
Not sure what that guy was going on about but what i think is going on is you think if you don’t get the 4k then you lose which is not the case. The title of winning and losing in this game is interpreted by the player. Neither exists so players make there own assumptions. The way i see it is if i got a good amount of blood points then that was a good game, even if i got sacrificed. If you really think not getting a 4k is a loss then by all means slug the last 2 for the 4k. Just be prepared for some hate mail.
---
As for getting these perks this guy was talking about, those perks are considered “teachable perk” so killer specific. To get them you have to level those killers up to 40 then they’ll show up in other blood webs. 
---
P.s this game is a huge grind to get that perfect build that works for you so just be prepared.
---
Well I don't find Billy or Freddy any fun, though I enjoy Nurse from time to time but definitely not my favorite. Doc is the one I like the most and I have fun on, same as Spirit (Spirit doesn't have much map pressure, she's a god in chase though). I don't want to be forced to play a group of killers to not get destroyed by any semi competent player
---
U can probably send me a vid of u winning with out perks as pig in rank 1. If u don’t have one u can always just play a game cuz it’s so easy to u.
---
Yikes.
---
Noel and Void
---
Everyone complaining about the 4 gens and i'm here struggling with the 4 pallet stuns in 1 game.
---
strategy wise, your good by hitting the injured just off the hook survivor, its just that he sure is having alot of fun lmao.
---
There definitely is of some sort. This Goodwill has a **LOT** of custom shirts. It seems like a group of people order custom shirts then dump off the miss prints to Goodwill.
---
If a survivor DCs during loading no-one gets anything but kicked. If a killer DCs during loading it errors out. If killer DCs during a match you get the bp bonus. Thats how it seems to be for me on PS4.
---
whoever keeps drawing these please continue
---
I have never played Trapper. Is it that easy to forget where traps were placed? The Hag has hers highlughted.
---
C:
---
Finally...😳
---
Still have more skin than you eczema bitch. Nice well thought out arguments to the points I made, I really enjoyed the part where you didn't address which part of my argument was made out to seem like I was overreacting. You have a fitting username considering how brainless you are. Maybe once you grow up past 12 you can look at donating your body to science. I'm sure it would be very intriguing to see how someone could be so god damn stupid. I'm here trying to make a point that people are toxic in this game; many would argue that's an objective truth. this has nothing to do with how sensitive I am, I usually don't even get that mad in this game even though my post may make it seem that way. Maybe if your formative years weren't so shit and you actually learned common sense, you would see that. Fuck you I'm gay.
---
This is the best shit I've ever seen
---
Yes, somewhat. Trapper, when close, had this no-so-intuitive, stupid feature of not having his traps highlighted for him when within a certain distance of them. It’s especially tedious, when like this, you have darkened traps and 3 tightly grouped in one place.
---
[this](https://youtu.be/GshKzNREMQg)  voice?
---
Fuck the doctor.
---
The greats arent the problem, they are a 2s boost on 80 seconds (solo). The problem is that finding/downing a survivor takes around 60-80 seconds. So if everyone is working on different gens, in a single chase 60% of a survivor objective is done while the killer's is at 8%. If they're working on the same gen it takes 33.33 seconds. So while a killer doesn't even have the time to do a single chase, a gen is done, and by the end, two are done and almost 3. This is ridiculous. The reason killers need Ruin isnt because great skill checks are so strong but because the objectives themselves are too quick and we need ruin to force them to hit a great or the gen regresses 5 seconds and cant get worked on for 2-3 seconds
---
😂
---
tax evasion is a bit more... Ace?
---
There's been 2 posts I can think of that had AI legions that had scouting around and one was about an ability to teleport to lockers
---
Thought they said no events until they fix their bugs?
---
The glitch was patched out a week or two ago. It basically means when your stuck in a trap as Trapper, the trap’s “grace period”, where you have time to move out the way before it becomes lethal again, shrinks to zero. The same glitch also meant that whenever you placed a trap, you couldn’t walk over it without becoming trapped. Cue infinite trap loop.
---
how are EITHER OF YOU that unlucky?
---
When? 2025?
---
ggez
---
PC players when they unplug their mouse mid chase
---
Playstation players when their batteries die mid chase
---
Dont gotta be only xbox amigo
---
Yeah, now that I'm on the "hook 5 people with Agitation in basement in one game" and "sacrifice 4 people in basement in one game" part of the tome...? 
---
Devs, you've done a fine job of making me never want to spend any more money on this game ever again. Not on battle passes, not on characters, not on costumes, nothing. These challenges are absolute horseshit, especially with the community that would rather DC and kill themselves on hook before letting killer get a 4k or anything related to it. An absolute waste of my time.  I won't be spending money on the next battlepass, because if this is how it is going to be every time...? You can forget it. I'm done with your shit. You expect people to get 4k in a specific part of the map in a game where you can immediately DC and not play like an absolute scumlord. Fuck you. You're getting no more of my money. I'm done with you.
---
I have seen it so many times and I always love it
---
Sometimes I wonder if people have brains
---
Depending on the map and totem placement ruin can last 5 seconds or the entire game (if you land on Hawkins it’s never going away). And ruin is a meta perk not because it’s good but because it’s a necessity and that’s something that shouldn’t be true for any perk
---
Crop 100
---
Sucks it should be within 3
---
Listen at the end of the day you are the killer, you should be someone their scared of you shouldn’t be scared of them. There’s nothing wrong with going for a survivor that was just unhooked besides the fact that decisive and borrowed could screw u in higher ranks, the guy that unhooked him should body block as well in which then both are injured and you can go for whoever. Always proxy gens when they are close together that’s completely the survivors fault for 3 genning themselves in the same spot. Lastly survivors and killers are salty there always gonna say some shit after the game if they don’t do good as long as you don’t completely face camp you really aren’t doing anything wrong.
---
Well,the person who stole it would know they stole it.
---
I literally cant even play a game right now. Error, connection lost, disconnect from host, etc. The list goes on. But it's extremely frustrating.
---
At that point the best thing you can do is farm
---
most of them arent they're just trying to be dickheads
---
Nice
---
Dude 😂 git gud
---
God I'd love to
---
Woah
---
No the only breaking she needs is unbreakable. This has been a public service announcement.
---
After reading all this I seriously doubt you are rank 4
---
He's joking, lol
---
I find the attention to detail cool, like how Billy is there because trapper is borrowing his hammer
---
Take my upvote also amazing drawing great job
---
Played my first game in Switch and it glorious! We all escaped and had a good time. (Yes graphics are awful, but oh whale!)

Thank you! I did a couple of sketches of her screaming and lunging but I guess I wasn’t really feeling it. In the end I liked how she looked with the more peaceful, kinda sad expression. I wanted it to have a more vaguely haunting kinda feel rather than straight up horrifying I guess.
---
Yea that was really nice! Of course the adrenaline scares the shit of every last player no doubt
---
Not to mention Doctor hitting Bloodlust 3 means the chase went on for too long so...that means the doctor isn't doing too hot. Lol
---
I did some maths, and considering that ruin 3 result in a 5% progress loss per "good" skill check, it's 4 seconds lost (80*5/100). Add to this the time needed to be able to actually progress after the missed skill check (I don't have the number but it's 3 seconds minimum), you gave a 7 second penalty per skill check. Considering that you have 8% chances of triggering a skill check, we have at least 125 seconds lost in average, which leads to at least 125 seconds. I think I were pretty close with my 140 experimental number.

Keep in mind there was no messages prior to this, he just sent this after his team got decimated.
---
Nah im just tired of the bullshit that we deny both sides have strong shit. I don't know why I would be salty over a meme? Also I knew you were gonna say that without even arguing about anything. Man is reddit fun, complaining about anything except whatever you use because it can't be broken if you use it, right?
---
This must be what heaven looks like.
---
That sucks man, I have a 3 man swf and we usually do a pretty good job about saving the rando because we can communicate who is free to do the rescue.  
---
The one time we left someone to die on hook was someone who was being toxic to us (teabagging at us while we were on hook) and we gladly returned the favor as they died while we were at exit gate.
---
For real, that seriously took me 2 days of hard grinding using bond and prove thyself.  Near impossible without swf
---
Nah, that'd be Anna
---
He only started lagging at the very end anyway lmfao. And also he was the only one lagging, the others were fine, i know cause the 3 man SWF said gg
---
I only use Sony Vegas. I wonder if I could do it on that. Thanks.
---
Okay I thought you were adding it to the monitor &amp; abuse thing cuz that’s what op is talking about.
---
Try a killer who’s strong with basement like LF or Trapper.  Used AG, IG, mad grit, and ruin and easily got it on my first try.
---
What do you mean for certain situations?
---
That and I forgot to mention that I'm in purple ranks so the killers are much harder to deal with
---
I always try to be nice to the 4th guy because me and my 3 man (when we do play) always have good communication. Sometimes we will even sacrifice our selves so they can escape and all I want is a simple un-hook. Maybe that's to much to ask lol.
---
$10 says he found it on this sub
---
I try to message them as quick as I can to let them know but more often than not they already tbagged hatch &amp; left. At that point the tbag was more to themself coz they missed out. 😞
---
Ash &amp; Freddy/Pig 
---
I'd like to play a large variety of survivors and killers but the thing preventing me from doing that is its not really worth it when i have perks and cosmetics on these characters, and the ones I'd want to play like Leatherface and Doctor are bad- or at least not good enough to bother when all survivors run optimal builds
---
Super useful info. Thanks friend. I just wanted an alternative to slugging cause that just doesn’t seem fun for survivors and I want points but not if friends can’t have fun.
---
I've always done this. Especially when you are fixing the gen with another survivor and you don't want to be shunned for missing the skill check at 99%
---
i really wanna play plague though i played her once today and it was so fun
---
The PC players have more to do while they are waiting to be put into a match.
---
Well, could add a 
---
Tier 6:
---
Using Shadowborne and Monitor &amp; Abuse for the most FoV possible even though they don't stack
---
I started getting bored but then I got plague and she’s so much fun
---
Haha...about that
---
It depends on the random honestly.  If they tried hard or if they’re a baby survivor we will do everything in our power to make sure they live.  If they were toxic or not helpful at all, they on their own.  But in general we try to be helpful bc we all know how awful solo queue can be.
---
Give my one millon bp I still will dodge every swf
---
Im not disagreeing with you dude... im saying because hag has built in mechanics that hard counter her ability she cant be S tier. Which is what this thread is about.
---
This.
---
wait tomie-- chill cHILL
---
yes, it's @leguinstarr
---
nurses, sloppy, monitor, stbfl 
---
Get them injured and stack up STBFL, force them to heal, sneak up on the heals with nurses and monitor - since you have a short radius you can get onto them and with STBFL you can pressure both the healer and healee. Sloppy buys time for you to find them and slows down the game. 
---
This setup is nutty bc all the perks synergize super well and let you snowball to a win at ~2 gens left consistently
---
I mean if they sent in a video the moderators will see that she actually was found because she afk'd and she will be the one up on the block for making specious reports.
---
His fault for not dodging the lobby when seeing red ping
---
No, he is still licensed also I am getting Deja vu about this post
---
&gt;Sucks it should be within 3
---
Queue times would be even longer and people would spam threads complaining just like others complain about matchmaking.
---
&gt;What do you mean for certain situations?
---
They vaguely explained in their last dev stream.
---
I don't think they can, the Junji Ito collection got a collab with IdentityV and I'm sure getting the rights for more would be *headsplitting.* ^(haha, get it? cuz the manga? imsofunnylmao)
---
The artist's signature is on the top right(below "dead by daylight" of the design, so it's not like the person is stealing the credit fortunately. It's likely that they really liked the design and either didn't want to pay as much to get it from an official seller (which is fucked up), or the artist doesn't have any shirts for sale so they order a custom one.
---
Those "play as" offerings suck, the very LEAST they should do is give the three base perks to work with. Otherwise, it's almost committing yourself to lose a game.
---
Tunnelling a person who is clearly being farmed is pretty toxic behavior, yeah.
---
Oh they definitely have their creativity. Not a fan of the game but they have a style that attracts.
---
Since the game is more survivor sided, they don't feel the constant need to complain, and when they do, it is such a stupid waste of time that it's either never seen or downvoted to oblivion by salty killers or just NORMAL survivors who understand that there is nothing to complain about. I know that the game isn't perfect, but i feel it's fairly well balanced right now, and it should be moving towards the better. But instead of polishing the game, they keep pushing for more. More killer, more mechanics, more maps and game interaction, all causing more bugs. They need to slow down and fix the bugs, sort out matchmaking, and the PLAYERS are responsible for dropping the Gang war of killers vs survivors. The worse this game gets, the more it will fester, and get even worse. If people play toxic because "playing to win isn't fun, i just live to see people DC" (actually had someone say this) then new players will never show up, and then the game gets worse, worse matchmaking, longer queues, same players every match. I feel like the game is on a tipping point, and i really like it, and hope it does well. There is no other game like it, and i think it's really cool. People just need to suck it up and play normal, for fun, instead of acting like it's to the death every game.
---
You probabaly just played Left4dead. Be a Bill main too hahah. Hag is an upper tiered killer not the best but very solid. Just run ruin and youll do good (:
---
No the killers will dodge the swf anyways its not about the reward is about fun
---
I gotta say, I hate huntresses, but I hate bullies much more. Great job
---
Fair point I guess just sucks
---
Oh yea definitely, always depends on how the survivor acts and plays.
---
Oh no. I always found math easy but word problems make me want to die. This brought back bad memories, I’m sorry.
---
Tiktok itself just makes things cringe lol. U gud
---
Why did you take advantage of him? Help them out by disabling the trap. Continuing to play as if he isn't bugged is poor etiquette. 👎
---
Monitor and abuse, infectious, ruin/corrupt and I really like STBFL but I'd go with brutal strength instead to fuck pallets over
---
You can still get those???
---
Have you tried walking towards the other end of the map where notifications won't trigger and tab out while the 2 minutes timer runs down? Or simply tab out and mute your game. 
---
I understand that the problem here is people refusing to leave for no reason whatsoever but complaining about them when the solution has been added (EGC) is equally pathetic IMO.
---
actually, there is a reasonable sense, its called billy chainsaw
---
If youre getting killed more than surviving and "not having fun" you need to get better at the game instead of going on a rant and give the survivors a huge advantage...oh im sorry YOU a huge advantage, cuz apparently you want everything for you. You say the game is 80/20 on the killer side, theres 1 killer and 4 suvivors in a game. And whether or not you survive a game depends on either how YOU play or how the killer plays. Nothing needs to be buffed on the survivor side, you only seem to want it to benefit YOU.  Either get better at the game or play something else, plain and simple
---
Yea. I was trying to get back playing the game and had some bloodpoints to levelup.
---
I got 2 for the nightmare, and since I don't own the character I really wanted to play as it. Sadly.. they didn't worked :(
---
Huntress, billy, wraith, and read the name.
---
They're disabled, they don't work anymore and are now useless
---
*Ben Shapiro voice*
---
Let’s say, hypothetically, that you were a survivor and I was a killer. I had downed you. Now, if I had downed you, that means you played bad. That you made a mistake. Now, since you’re downed, I am entitled to hit you as much as I want, am I not? And if I’m entitled to hit you, why then, can I not hit you while you are on the ground without the use of a ‘memento mori’? Just to play devils advocate for a momen-

HoW dArE yOu NoT iNdUlGe My PoWeR tRiPpInG fAnTaSy?!11!
---
I don’t know, I’m in red ranks and did this in like 2-3 matches, and I was about 10 feet from completing all 5 gens. Empathy helps a lot. If you start with someone immediately crank the first gen next to you and then go hunting. Pay attention to where people are getting hit. They were likely working on a gen so you can run over there and clean it up.
---
Remember, all you need to do is FINISH the gen, so you should never be starting an unworked gen by yourself unless you’re near endgame and everyone else is preoccupied.
---
Ooof. Thanks for the heads up...
---
I just wanna say that I stick to my convictions; my primary reason for being there was to get the totem, so I decided I was getting the damn totem!

Np man, same thing happened to me lol. No idea why it hasnt been said anywhere though. If you look it up you should find it though

That spirit is awesome!
---
He's really just Mike "The Electric Fence" Pence.  He's got the coolest Mori too
---
Dwight, Kight, they made a joke
---
Imagine playing on the gay console. Checkmate, Xbox.
---
Can’t decide if this is real or not
---
Are you drunk?
---
was it you that commented on that halloween 2 hospital chase edit with "you call this a shitpost but all i see is actual shit"
---
Understandable you can't risk letting a pepperoni pizza go to waste.
---
This happens at all ranks. Sadly 80% of the community is toxic losers who get off by trolling or being rude.
---
Makes them feel special.
---
All I can advise is, either leave them to act like tards and ignore them or leave and block them.
---
Hope you get better games and nicer people soon
---
The mere thought of having even just 1 extra killer patrolling seems incredibly broken, let alone 4 in total. That seems far too strong, especially on maps like suffocation pit and the one auto haven map (I believe its azarovs resting place) where it's evenly split.
---
Chill. I was just pointing out the facts
---
No one thinks it is a fun or interactive perk, but it is a necessary perk if you want to have a longer game. Gens complete really quickly and a good team of survivors can burn through a game without ruin.
---
The thing about this is its difficult for me because I play on console so that's not a thing
---
Because Moris and noed are legitimate problems. Mainly noed because it’s so easy to get and killers that don’t deserve a single kill secure one because they get an easy down. I don’t hate moris that much but ebony is ridiculous especially when killers tunnel just to force the death. The only rediculous thing on survivor side is keys. And even that isn’t as rediculous as killer shit because you need to be able to find the hatch and get it to spawn. Having it doesn’t really guarantee anything especially if it’s solo que. swf could be a problem but I don’t play swf I’m a solo survivor

#**[Subreddit Update - Rule 8: Oversaturated Content Addition - Tier Lists](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dr1zmk/subreddit_update_rule_8_oversaturated_content/)**
---
I’m killing myself 😭🔫
---
Doesnt matter, they're rank 17. Shouldn't happen. They would just get 4ks every match and pip every game because you can't depip pre rank 15
---
Or in my case, playing while listening to music louder than the game.
---
This happened to me. Three people disconnected, so I farmed my Trapper rift challenge with the last guy and let him go off to do the 5 generators before escaping. I had the add on to hold 2 traps at once and was screwing around stepping in them because I was bored. I placed two traps kind of close to each other, stood in one and then I proceeded to get stuck in that animation for 10+ minutes.
---
It definitively reduces my life span by a minute each day I play :D
---
i mean, i tend to be a little upset when people say rude stuff but that might just be me
---
or maybe people should stop caring about ranks, pips and depis, and you will play happier and better, to be honest, ranks does not prove anything i have been all ranks in mutliple seasons, and the best rank to play is purple-green, lowest queu times very popoulated and fill with both good and bad people... red ranks are 80% reparators 20% good players , shit ton of queu time and no fun at all, enjoy the game and we will have a better enviroment in both sides
---
1) you wouldn’t be far away enough for that to cause notification spam which is what the post is about 
---
2) no one with a brain does that because it just gets you grabbed
---
Wat o.O
---
DBD is not competitive, is saltytive
---
My favorite is when i have BT or We'll make it, and some other rando in my team who has neither of the 2 will just rush the hook to get the unhook for them sweet sweet altruism points, denying it for me, AND then not even bodyblock for the guy who just got unhooked...
---
that was hook slide showing it's full ass at you lol
---
Ebony moris are awful I agree. NOED though? Its haunted grounds with more speed and a way to turn it off before it has a chance to activate. I don't use NOED much because I don't even reach the endgame most of the time but it's still a fine perk. Its just as fine as adrenaline I'd say. If one gets nerfed the other should too
---
Kinda does though. Imagine if you set off the traps even when crouched. Her hook game would be near impossible. That would be S tier. I always think of tier lists when its the best vs the best. A full SWF thats the best vs the best player of hag; The hag would probably come out 2nd best. She has the same problem trapper has, if a swf team sees you place a trap its as good as pointless. 
---
Rusty Shackles Hag though.. thats more closer to 'S Tier'.
---
Good stuff man. A video meme. Not a low-effort, reused meme like 90% of the sub. 
---
I approve, hope you come up with more ideas to share 🙂👍
---
Everybody gangster until the fricking shape comes to the exit
---
&gt;i mean, i tend to be a little upset when people say rude stuff but that might just be me
---
Have you tried disabling chat?
---
Poor Wraith. Welp, at least he won't fall down anymore.
---
I love it so much! He sounds so pure and innocent and WE MUST PROTECT TRAPPER!!
---
Insidious..  ghostface? What the fuck was he doing lmao
---
Miss Pig and Sexy Ass Kate
---
Had a similar situation with a facecamping Doctor during EGC. Three of us left, one on hook, Doc pulled me off as I went for the hooksave (didn’t realize they could do that at full health). Second person pulls them off and they both run for the exit gate. I managed to 4% myself off the hook and start running. He downs me, makes me crawl all the way to the exit gate, picks me up right before I escape, and I DS him and run out. Felt so good because the guy was playing like such a dick.
---
Yes, I think you shouldn't have pipped that game and here's why:
---
The game categories exist for a reason, and that is to test your ability. 
---
Unbroken and Evader tests your ability to evade and lose the killer, Altruism tests your judgment of when to unhook and heal your teammates and Lightbringer is just how well you manage your time by doing objectives. 
---
If by some unnatural reason you NEVER see the killer, this means that you have aaaaall the time in the world to do objectives. That's SHOULD be two iridescent emblems, one in objectives and one in survival. You always get altruism and evader in silver by default, so that's your 12 points necessary to pip right there. 
---
If you get chased, like in your case, you may lose some points in objectives and survival *(in case of being hooked)*, but you compensate by getting gold or iridescent on evader, depending on how good you are. 
---
So, yeah. Simply put you just weren't good enough. Otherwise, you would have got a gold or higher in Evader or Unbroken, for example.
---
Everyone is disgusted at first, but soon they all surrender to the futanari Huntress and all the quality Trapper art.
---
IIRC if you miss more than like 3 times gen tapping is actually faster.
---
Imagine honestly thinking there's a noticeable difference between Xbox and PS4 other than the different shapes of the controllers. Checkmate, like almost everyone.
---
Trying not to be knock out of his Nightshroud by the person on the hook, I assumed. You can't stop Insidious as a Survivor.
---
I’m done
---
I’m at my spot at a cliff
---
i dont know, i dont think this is even close to reality......
---
that girl ran away tooo slow
---
I knew you would be here. Love the art!
---
Once I played a game on Gideon Meat plant, so the totems were a bit harder to find. The opponent was able to get all five stacks on Huntress Lullaby. Ironically, it was much easier to hit skill checks with no sound, than with delayed sound.
---
i find that i only truly won if i get hate mail
---
Isn't this already a thing? I swear it's an option in the menu.
---
Thanks😁Yes I’m everywhere for the doctor🔥
---
There are a few others in the about section in this subreddit :)
---
I think it is a stupid challenge, but not impossible. The wording of the challenge makes it sound like you need to do 4 gens, but you only need to be around when they are completed. If you run bond and go against a sub par killer the challenge is easier than you would reckon, but overall it isn't an enjoyable way to play the game sadly.
---
Can I have your dad mine is still getting a pack of cigarettes
---
You can only get them if you don't own the DLC with the character.
---
it was at that moment, when everyone realized....
---
On xbox I am and with hag and sometimes other killers. I have turned off captures in the past and I think it helped a bit but that was on xbox
---
if the merit we are going on is 4 man SWF, then there are no good killers.
---
Her hook game is already nigh impossible if she knows what shes doing.
---
I’ve wanted a Bikini Jane for so long
---
its literally to avoid getting grabbed. Its betting on the killer having his chainsaw almost ready, so you hop out, then hop back in hoping they will miss.
---
Except for nurse and somewhat spirit. Thats why they are S tier. Tier lists should always be the best vs the best or any one who pulls a 4k with clown/legion can boast they are S tier.
---
I personally find Deliverance to be way better. Because with Kindred, you still have to rely on your teammates. With Deliverance, you can just farm the first hook and if you are good enough/not tunnelled all game, then you can come in clutch when you get a late game first hook and no one comes to save you OR the killer camps you and you want to yeet off anyways. Especially if you run DS (and both at tier 3 have a cooldown of 60 seconds which is great because you are Broken anyways)
---
Fair point. Maybe the patrols are dumber AI? Easy to stealth. Or perhaps you need to command a person to a particular generator to scout it.
---
I just call my internet provider and cancel momentarily
---
"Crafty" would be super OP. It would have the same issue old tinkerer did.
---
"puppet master" could be interesting i think it could be balanced if it gave a notification like screaming when the survivors get close to tell everyone that the killer has that perk. Also it shouldnt work while the obi is on the ground or hook
---
Currently slugging is the only way to make sure. I feel it's too much of a hassle unless I am in a pretty vindictive mood. ^^
---
Just so you know this is the only repost that I’ve ever done in this community. Everything else is my content. Literally what harm is this doing? I don’t understand.
---
Here's the thing; not only is Otz extremely good at the game, but he's super wholesome and not toxic. He's just a nice guy with a lot of game knowledge, and that makes him an appealing person to watch- at least for me!   
---
I hope you give him a chance. He's really great. :)
---
I mean a flashlight is a flashlight. I dont perspnally think a purple flashlight is any more toxic than a yellow flashlight. For that matter, the flashlight is only as toxic as the way you use it. Blinding a killer when they are animation locked or carrying a survivor is by no means toxic, its just how you use the flashlight. Spamming the button and flashing it at the killer just to get their attention is a little toxic, but to be fair, sometimes you need to get the killers attention to keep them away from someone else, so who's to say really.
---
Not really. Nurse is easy as hell to juke nowadays and often gets fucked by dedicated servers.
---
Spirit gets fucked on certain maps, and now that survivors can walk through her, she is way easier to juke.
---
You need to have the perk on you to get it done. You do not need to be injured to make it count (it helps though, because it increases size of skill checks)
---
I understand why people dislike Claudette now. I just bought The Doctor and in my first game I went up against a 4 man swf team, three of which were Claudettes with super bloody shirts, and we were on the new Oni map so I couldn't see them at all. By the time I got across the map to a generator they had already finished it. They all had flashlights and 360'd around me and clicked their flashlights at me repeatedly. By the time I caught one person and hooked them, two more generators were done. After the game I said "gg wp, sorry for being bad I'm a baby doctor" and they said nothing and left.  
---
Rude and unnecessary bullying of someone with no perks or addons. Unable to see the survivors because of the dark map and dark clothing and skin.
---
Just equipped
---
Trapper and Myers have been my go-to for years (and i finally got Ruin on Myers so hooray.), But im really digging Ghostface and Demogorgon too. I play every killer though except Legion, Spirit and Nurse.
---
Ace.
---
Report them to PSN, it can actually get them suspended.
---
The big argument thread ruined any potential of being funny the meme had. The only good thing about this post now, is the format.
---
the ranks
---
Well then that's that. You don't agree with me. I say hag is the second best killer in the game, easy S tier, you don't.
---
Today I had a butt-clenching time with a bear trap. While I was on the hook, a gen got done, so the timer would start when I was unhooked. It took me every single box search to get it off, and the timer was very close to zero.
---
Flair checks out.
---
Camping is a strategy too. Its to annoy you and to waste your time.
---
Entitled survivors will stay entitled
---
It's funny because these people are treating the downvote button like some kind of punishment, when it's really just supposed to be a tool to decide what is and isn't relevant. They're so gungho about hating on reposts when they don't even understand how to use reddit themselves.
---
Edit: Oh no please don't downvote me too guys! :( I'll never do it again I promise!
---
Sir I posted this a literal second ago, camping is just a strategy, don't get it twisted
---
Just from the screenshot, you’re running a weak pig build
---
Bikini hag: *pounces on you* UwU sempai bill~ *notices your liver* OwO someones happy :3
---
It’s all fun and games till EAC slaps a ban for using character/item icons and BeHavior won’t help you
---
“Tunneling” doesn’t take the fun out of the game. Survivors are just entitled
---
Well i checked them out, and they seem to just be selling basic color clothes. The image itself might have come from elsewhere. You mentioned this Goodwill has lots of modern stuff, so it wouldn't hurt to ask around.
---
Killer main I see. Nice to meet you. I wonder which parent didn't give you enough love.
---
Also, I never mentioned camping at all in this post, camping is annoying, same as what I'm talking about in the post; but they are both ultimately strategies.
---
I've thought of this too : the 4 legions, 16 survivors, four farm maps combined. One can wish. I'm afraid though that if there are multiple game modes, the community will get divided into people that main a certain game mode.
---
i finally got Jeff :)
---
There are essentially no red rank killers on PS4. There’s hardly even any purple rank ones. That’s why this happens.
---
But PS4 is also just in a serious state of decay right now and it feels like devs have abandoned it entirely
---
Good luck.
---
You fail to see the humor in my post, which is understandable.
---
I would  just engage these people in polite conversation (back when I was on PSN) about why they were mad, let them dig themselves a  massive hole with racial slurs and then report the whole conversation.
---
Happy cake day
---
'Tis the season
---
It’s unfortunate :(
---
Ohshit I'm sorry, you can never know in this sub..
---
Really? i love this build every perk feels super useful, what’s wrong with it?
---
Its fine, I know the feeling.
---
Thank you!! Sorry for such a dumb question. I just wasn't sure.
---
I have to say, I cringed harder reading your comments than anything else here.
---
&gt;And it's fairly recent too, so someone made a shirt out of it for themselves and then immediately donated it? That makes no sense lmao
---
someone may have died
---
car accident, gotten shot, cancer, maybe a serial killer
---
yep
---
You have my condolences 🙏
---
Reverse bear traps dude...
---
Whatever one was busy coddling you would be my guess survivor main.
---
Ghost face is the most like myers, and he is very fun to play with.I bought ghost face before even playing as killer whem i first started so im a softie for him.
---
&gt;the ranks
---
What about them? I don't see anything special.
---
why is she embarrassed? peeing in the pool as she talks?
---
Well you’re using spies, Whispers and BBQ. 3 tracking perks. If you are trying to get better it’s best leaving BBQ behind, it’s only good for BP as majority of decent players avoid bbq. Spies from shadows is useless tbh, Whispers is decent especially on pig.    A tip for pig, run Whispers and monitor and abuse. Using this you can walk around the map until Whispers activates then you crouch, monitor and abuse reduces your radius out of chase so survivors won’t hear you coming at all.   STBFL is good but it’s situational and all. Best using more guaranteed effective perks.
---
Give me a break, the 2 best perks in the entire game are DS and Borrowed Time, which are anti-tunnel. Also want to mention that you will find more tunnelers at lower ranks, so
---
Maybe they knew you had a shit game and were trying to help you get bloodpoints by showing where some points were to be had.
---
Nope. Love playing both. So I know camping and tunneling are god awful for survivors and make me hate the game just as I hate teabagging dickhead survivors. But it's so amusing as most people who share opinion on here are one or the other and both think the other is entitled and too powerful. It amuses me.
---
If a killers good you legit don’t have the time to cleanse/look for every totem and maybe if you didn’t play just one side you would know that. It’s literally a free down because most of the time survivors don’t even know you have it until it pops and if you’re halfway decent you’ll be in a chase when the final gen is done anyway. But I’m done with this
---
Today i can painstakingly say, I did it. I did them all. 100% 1,2,3, and fucking 4. Do I feel accomplished? No... Have the thoughts of why do I do this anymore popped up continuously? Yes. Did it bring me to that sweet tier 70 nectar? Fuck no still got 10 tiers to go! Wooooooo
---
I seriously think it’s gonna die on PS4 if they don’t do something soon. I’ve played since console launch and I’ve never seen it this bad.  
---
I had the fucking basement bug happen to me a couple days ago 
---
Yesterday I had the no skill check bug
---
They had fixed fast vault momentum a while back, but it’s bullshit again and I’m getting hit after continuing my momentum and the killer swing after the vault animation 
---
They also managed to fucking destroy hit registry for Huntress and Oni and frame rate is awful right now and auto-aim has always been a joke but it just doesn’t make a lick of sense now
---
Queues for survivor take an eternity and matchmaking is garbage 
---
The game has unknown errors and crashes constantly 
---
Auras barely work on Ormond again. I could never see my Nemesis activate
---
Because low rank survivors end up having DS, Adrenaline, Balanced Landing, Borrowed Time
---
It makes sense, Freddy actually [loves pizza](https://media.giphy.com/media/fyhdU4ADvbLva/giphy.gif)
---
Ghostface is better but I'm a pretty big fan of both. Pig is really fun and is good at slowing the game down.
---
Yeah it’s bad. Probably going to have to switch to pc when I get my pc back soon. Hopefully my experience is better there
---
&gt;!cool!&lt;
---
If you want to go full meta then get rid of self care and put on ds, it’ll also allow you to become used to running around injured without being afraid of a chase. Or at least that’s how I play especially with adrenaline, I’ll just stay injured for the last 3 gens or heal if absolutely necessary. But if you want to play for fun then I’d recommend quick and quiet, head-on, ds, and inner strength or borrowed time if playing with friends
---
I actually almost only play survivor. I was just telling someone why earlier. How funny.
---
Tunneling doesn’t take away the fun because being chased is the most exciting part of survivor gameplay.
---
It should just be a perk and not a hex. It gains a token for each gen completed. The fact that its weak as hell and a hex is where the shitty-ness is problematic.
---
Rank 20 dweets are so innocent and pure.
---
The killer isn’t a fucking idiot. They’re just going to de-rev the saw and instaswitch to grab
---
You are drunk
---
I do play a bit of survivor and if the killer is good, you won't reach the endgame anyway, right? And they most likely wont have NOED since they don't need it. I play solo and I've never found a single game with NOED where its complete bullshit and I'm usually the one hit. Same for camping. Is it fun for me? No, but my team has the time to do gens while he's camping me
---
It is but maybe he wants it faster lol
---
I love you both lmao
---
aka "Just play Wraith, Freddy or Billy, if you want to win"
---
I envy you.  I’m no where near finished so I may just wave the white flag on this lol
---
Myers.
---
What's his gameplay like? And what does he do?
---
He's referencing a meme, not making an argument
---
Prepare your anus.
---
My solution to this: Add rank rewards at the end of the season to discourage losing rank on purpose. THEN give different rank categories different gen speeds. Maybe at red ranks gens take twice as long to finish.
---
You dare defy the struggles of killer mains!?
---
Nah but in all seriousness not all of us killer mains are douches. People just like to complain about an imperfect game. There’s BS on both sides and the best we can do is role with it.
---
For real though, the answer is no. BHVR changed it a while back
---
He stalks.Its like myers tier 3 but he uses it on one person an infinite amount of times.It would help to watch a video on him before making any judgements.
---
I'm gonna trust your answer, my friend : ]
---
I mean, not that being that toxic is acceptable, but ‘job’ of killers and survivors could be defined in different ways. The simplest is just 1) Escape/Kills, then theres 2) Badges for rankups, or 3) Bloodpoints, and there are plenty of things you can justify with definition 1 that completely ignore definitions 2 or 3.
---
My girlfriend loves watching me play her and laughs as I vomit on everything.
---
Can you point out any difference between him and pig?
---
I remember during the lobby chat, I asked my teammates if anyone was doing the "The last place you look" challenge and didn't get a response and I was the only one that brought a Shiny coin for the match and I wanted to get it on the first go. 
---
During the match I saw someone at the distance searching through chests for some reason. At the end I only got 3 chests (if I'm remembering correctly) and apparently the person that was searching chests was going for the "Plundering King" challenge but didn't mention any of it, I told her she should have mentioned it and then her friend started to make fun of my name and tried to insult me and make me mad because I screwed their friend (a friend that didn't bother to say that they were going for the challenge in the first place).
---
I'm sometimes confused on why people are like that to both themselves and teammates.
---
Skill checks have always been a struggle but I’ve been practicing on Ruin Skill Checks because I believe they’re about roughly the same size if not smaller than the DS skill check. I only have Self-Care on because back in low ranks(brown-green), I never could rely on people to heal so I quickly got Self-Care after leveling Meg. It’s hard to rely on people while playing by yourself, you feel like you gotta do everything yourself.
---
It doesn't work. I will ignore you until you fall in to my trap. 
---
Now I'm wasting your time. You should be doing gens.
---
Pretty good job so far
---
Don't be envious, at this point I'm a prime candidate to get indoctrinated by the entity as my mind is lost and my rage against certain survivors is large
---
What I’m saying is in a rank system where the numbers don’t always matter as rank Doesnt generally equal skill, high rank new players are toast against killers who tunnel. But besides that even at low ranks, tunneling itself is easily a kill. Unlike YouTube titles say, most people can’t run a killer for five gens to get the hatch...
---
Me using my 4 stakeout stacks
---
The speedboost and insta down makes it bullshit. Mainly when it secures them their only kill. And if a killers good doesn’t mean they win every game.
---
they fixed to leave you behind :-( good game nice save
---
So it is a PS4 issue? If this is the case, happy to switch to PC.
---
Goshtface is stealthier, and his stalk power lets him instadown.Pig has better perks imo but ghostface is alot more stealthier then pig
---
Damn son! Very nice! It’s so satisfying when you get to throw up at big ol’ “FUCK YOU” to a face-camping killer. Especially a killer that feels the need to constantly hit you while hooked
---
In my experience Spies from Shadows is really good, but maybe it gets worse at higher ranks. What would you recommend instead of BBQ?
---
Yeah true
---
Do you play with different settings? It’s just so smooth and crystal clear imagery
---
Well matchmaking isn’t solely a console issue but it’s just way worse on console then pc because there are fewer players overall. All the other things that were mentioned seem to be mainly a ps4 issue
---
I don’t think you realize fandoms disconnecting takes a toll on the survivor team aswel...
---
I finally got this one when the killer killed everyone except me after we had only completed a single generator. He let me do the last four by myself.
---
Getting great skills checks on my own &lt; Perk: Stake Out
---
pig
---
Lol I feel like this is everyone after the archive event.
---
I will do my best:
---
First of all your build could be better. Not sure what perks you have to run with but for this sort of build you would want:
---
Whispers, BBQ, Monitor and abuse and then ruin for gens. The way you are playing atm is you see whispers light up and you never enter stealth which gives them time to get away. But with the build I suggested whispers tells you that they are 32 metres away and monitor and abuse gives you a 24m terror radius, that means that if you crouch as whispers turns on then you will be able to sneak up on them.
---
Also you're not using whispers correctly, whispers turned off and you checked a locker which was a waste of time. As whispers turned on you also checked right in front of you at one pint but when whispers turns on and you are moving forward then they are 32 metres away in front of you either to the left, right or straight on.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Edit: will keep udpdating this.
---
I've watched all of match 1 now and you did really well in the situation you were in, good awareness of survivor trying to hide in a locker during bbq and of the potential pallet save. From the fist game the biggest issue was how bad the survivors you were facing were. It's hard to critique your gameplay when they made it so easy for you. So based off the first game I would say just keep playing and post more gameplay as you rank up.
---
Onto game 2.
---
A single kill wont make them pip. Though running them around the whole game and doing gens will. He's still losing here. If you don't leave and the killer got NOED (they're most likely camping them) and you die to it its your fault being overaltruistic. If a killer is good I agree it doesn't mean they will win every game but a good killer will not use NOED since its useless for most of the game and would rather have a slowdown perk (ruin, corrupt), tracking (bbq, nurses), chase (brutal, enduring, spirit fury) and something misc (usually another slowdown perk or sloppy/infectious) instead of a perk that MIGHT activate once every 10 games.
---
I guess ghostface it is, then. I kinda like how he's able to crawl around instead of being 7 feet tall and being spotted (aka myers). Besides, i like his stab animation better.
---
I can verify, you have to be friends with everyone. 
---
I ran into this survivor twice over a couple months. Our last game made us both laugh even though I still killed her. We ended u becoming friends. We have played as survivors since and her 2 other friends wants me to pay killer against them. We couldn't get the lobby to work until I friended the other one
---
Thanks for the help guys. I think im gonna stick to ghostface for this one
---
Omg look at him pulling him out xD I've always wondered imagine if they put a killer in with an offering that allows them to spawn a fake/trap hatch along with the real one D:
---
"Pretty good job so far."
---
That was incredible.Pardon me for what I'm about to say but that Hag deserves every t-bag and flashlight click out there
---
That definitely wasn't the case. I can tell when survivors give me free hits and hooks and this wasn't happening. They just wanted to be rude and get my attention. The only reason I nailed the Claud is cuz she strayed  just a little too far from the others and panicked.
---
The thing is though, in an average match, the ones that aren’t good at looping are always the the ones that are teabagging, flashlight-ing and following the killer on purpose. It’d be a good strategy if the players doing this were actually good but most of the time they’re mediocre and just like to piss off the killer.
---
That is honestly a good idea, like some sort of win/loss ratio?
---
What does that even mean
---
Ghostface comes with an insta down and his power has a cooldown.
---
Pig can use her dash to counter loops, and she comes with her own slowdown mechanic via RBT.  She cannot be broken out of her stealth, but she's slower in it.
---
I'd personally go with pig. Her dash is fun and her slowdown makes ruin less required.
---
Steve be zoomin. #carried
---
Wow this killer is a dick - like saw and noticed the game was having issues but continued to kill...interesting
---
Oof... he’s got one perk with steve... I don’t wanna break the news to you but..
---
Survivor main. Not even good at the game. I disagree with pretty much everything you said.  Ruin is needed.
---
Honestly, I'm gonna assume you're the jerk here. I'm pretty sure your next message says "its just a game bro" and his message, "dime out your teammate," sounds like you told his location to the killer or something. His message is a bit petty, but you don't really strike me as all that innocent either.
---
Ye ye
---
Ahh. So to see if its worth it at all vs just chasing them down?
---
Its just gonna say Nea.
---
You are correct, but sometimes some survivors (like me) like to take some agro and annoy the killer. It doesn't matter if I go down, what matters is I did what I intended which was take the agro. But, then again, some survivors are just potatos.
---
Also it depends how many skill checks you ultimately get. Sometimes I will get over half way through with 0 skill checks
---
BBQ is fine, it's good for bp and for pig it helps her keep an eye on who is going to which trap and helps you predict their movement. They are less likely to hide from it when they have a ticking bomb on their head.
---
Spies from the shadows it very pointless though. You already have whispers, spies is just gonna be constantly popping up with information you don't need. I'd 100% swap it out.
---
The guy above is 100% right about whispers and monitor and abuse. STBFL is also decent but it means you need to hit your obsession with you crouch attack to avoid losing stacks. 
---
You also definitely need something extra for gen control especially as you progress in ranks
---
This sounded like a super villain monologue halfway-
---
&gt;I understand that, but it’s hard to do this when the rank system we have isn’t very helpful, and quite frankly your rank doesn’t always equal your skill level
---
I struggle to see how the rank system will interfere in your practicing to become better. You don't need 3 rank 1 teammates to practice that 1v1 chase against the killer.
---
I read it in the voice of my physics teacher, who is infamous for making dad jokes
---
Then you didn't read my comment very well. I literally said Ruin is fine and should stay in the game, with no changes. I even specifically separated it from the wall of text so people could read it more easily.
---
Idk how long it takes to heal with self care, maybe like a minute? I have no idea but within a minute, you could’ve done more than half a gen and while being injured it’ll allow you to know when to run away as well as be aware of what’s around you so you know where to run to. To me, I just found it useful to not rely on self care but it’s going to be a pain at first but as time goes on you’ll get the hang of it and ask yourself “why did I even use self care”
---
how many of these are you planning on doing? As someone whose played both Left for Dead and DBD this is really cool. You're art style is so appealing
---
Why does Bing Bong look like a fucking snacc in this comic
---
Yea it is but I think it could be a little faster!
---
Yep, and unless you throw more than two of them the progress is minimal
---
When noed is in people typically just leave because why give them kills he didn’t earn. Just sucks when your the one killed by it
---
One, if I run into an iri head huntress, chances are she isn't doing the challenge. 
---
Two. If she is playing iri head huntress she doesn't deserve that challenge, bc it's not a challenge at that point.
---
Three, "don't be a dick" like brining iri heads isn't being a dick.
---
Congratulations.
---
I didn't say it was difficult. I said you still have to learn how to do it and learn the right timing. There's no need for all this aggression lol.
---
Also TIL "easier" means "hard"
---
Clown who runs the exhaustion add one, brings mori an proxy camps hooks. I’ve had some see me on my way to someone and then just go back to the hook instead of chasing. It’s so annoying
---
I like the idea that the killers (while brutal) still want this to be a fair fight, as, if there was no chance for the survivors, that would take the fun out of it (although, Trapper seems to be obliviously helpful), but I’m fond of the idea that the killers don’t want the survivors getting hurt by anyone/thing but them
---
All I want is for the struggle mechanice to change a bit. mashing a button is not cool when you're tired, just give us a series of skill checks and if you fail you lose lots of time but if you succeed its a easy scoring event.
---
Yeah Freddy splinters haven't worked for a while. I think the other splinters still work though which is weird...
---
Very similar to Myers, but he specializes in singling out survivors to mark instead of all of them
---
&gt;So here's the suggestion, wouldn't it be cool if we got a rank per character? 
---
No, it wouldn't. 
---
Playing killer is nothing but a general understanding of how to deal with looping and map control. Map awareness, pallet placements, possible direction that survivors might be or come from, how to end chases quickly. 
---
All of this is knowledge that you will acquire by playing your main killer character but this knowledge won't be gone when you decide to try a new killer at rank 20. This will cause you to stomp new survivors trying to play the game because you have way more game knowledge than them. 
---
You gave Nurse as a fair example that a lot of people would struggle to use even at rank 20. Nurse has a unique power with a huge downside but the rest of the killer roster is nothing but walk and press M1 with your power available to make this task even easier.
---
Well yeah, but unless you're *really* good at looping, all you actually did was save the killer some time looking for someone to chase. 
---
Also if someone does this to me multiple times instead of doing gens I just chase someone else and let them waste their own time.
---
Jeez you commentators are as salty as the messaging person and you all make me glad i hardly ever play that game anymore, you're all little shits. It really is just a damn game. Unless dude had bond chances are he had no idea he was running at his teammate til it was too late. God, you guys are as toxic as teabaggers and flashlight clickers.
---
Amanda is so skinny in the movies yet the entity still likes to fat shame...smh
---
Jesus, I forgot Claudette had Hair physics
---
None of that changes the fact that DC is still a bitch move. Seriously just kill yourself instead loser.
---
How can you if you're not friends which correct me if I'm wrong, you can't message the killer without knowing who they are and they make friends much less likely to be queued up. Only vice versa, so... Just saying, not very likely.
---
Best way to hit ds skill checks is to practice with ds ;) lol even now at red ranks I still miss my ds skill checks so don’t feel ashamed of it
---
Yeah, I would have used to think they weren't that bad but since facing red rank survivors most of the time now they really were lol.
---
I could see some of your perks inbetween games but not all of them. Just have 2 questions for you to help me help you:
---
1. What are all the perks you have atm?
---
2. Are you only interested in perks for pig or do you want to play other killers too?
---
Edit: I've watched game 2 now also and pretty much the same case as the first. These survivors didn't challenge you ( the Yui was a bit better than the rest though) and so it's hard to critique it. I'm also not really a big pig player so hard for me to give specific tips but I believe there is a guy called Scorpio ( or something similar) who is a pig main so could watch him. Otz is also pretty decent with pig and what I do know I have learnt from him
---
We all have to start somewhere...
---
&gt;It should just be a perk and not a hex. It gains a token for each gen completed. The fact that its weak as hell and a hex is where the shitty-ness is problematic.
---
Yeah... no. Lullaby isn't that great but is not shit either. New players already have enough trouble hitting skill checks as they are, making lullaby default would turn it a meta perk in lower ranks. 
---
Not to mention Doctor is also a thing and even though you can hit normal skill checks without sound, trying to guess where in the screen the QTE will appear would be impossible.
---
You are as toxic as the rest of this awful community and you make me glad i hardly play. Assuming you're even close to right, damn dude it's genuinely just a game.
---
Im not on the hook
---
Nah, I think I'm right. I think you're the OP.
---
your hitbox is bigger while you heal or do gens
---
Good idea but sounds very situational if a survivor knows the killer they will most likely avoid windows and closets meaning they will be only useful on the first chase
---
Pretty easily, actually. You could literally just message the killer during, assuming this is on a console, which I'm fairly certain it is. Secondly, so what if you don't have bond? Are you saying survivors NEVER see each other for the duration of a match, ever? If that's how your matches go, something is very wrong.
---
I never said it was strong
---
Well then, I think I'm right that you're stupid. I'd tell OP to weigh in but what point is there in trying to change stupidity?
---
Are the tomes and their rewards permanent? (not including rift fragments of course)
---
As in, if I have easier challenges and want to progress the rift as much as I can, would it be better to complete earlier challenges as opposed to level 4 challenges? I'm just wondering if the tome rewards are going to be gone after.
---
That’s a fair point
---
Survivor's hitboxes while doing a gen are the same when they are standing so if the huntress is good, she can be able of hitting you
---
w-what? as someone who basically mains huntress i can say thats kinda bullshit, i get it should change when youre in a different position but not just get bigger, like there is literally no way that ever should've hit, bruh
---
1. [Perks for The Pig](https://imgur.com/a/Qy0uFeG) the other page is only Sloppy Butcher
---
2. I play Myers and the Huntress a lot too and sometimes the Hag
---
Yeah I’ve also learned a lot from Otz, i’ll check out that Scorpio guy
---
? if youre trying to say im wrong, i am not. if you mean bullshit like should not happen, youre correct. it shouldn't but it does and id be willing to bet its intentional
---
&gt;The fact that I am a rank 18 going against not a single brown rank, which could destroy a first time players fun and turn them away from the game
---
Still waiting for your reply. People that complain about matchmaking never answer if they rather not play at all.
---
Because during a chase are you really focused on exactly where your teammates are and are they really going to stay in one spot doing one thing until they get caught? Doesn't matter if you have *seen* them, will you actually remember and find them on purpose while being chases and evading/juking a killer? And I highly doubt that, unless you're talking about looking at recent players, the lobby doesn't and never has shown the killer to survivors (at least since i've played)
---
Nah, I think you're the stupid one, bro. OP hasn't replied, yet you have, hardcore defending him rn. Kind of odd. 
---
Two. OP apparently doesn't know how to crop, because I can pretty much make out his second message. This gives me the immediate impression that OP isn't the brightest bulb in the box, and, as you've responded to my original comment with VERY weak arguments, I can see you're not very bright either. This, alongside the fact that you're very much into defending the OP, leads me to believe that you are ARE the OP.
---
You mean the Bikinigorgon right?
---
TBF, Ghostface is still a rough killer for new players.
---
I learned this one from Umbra, your hitbox doesn’t change when you preform actions like gens, so you can abuse it with huntress your get a free hit.
---
I know it's been awhile since you posted this but ai saw there wasn'r an answer, and sadly, no.
---
Weirdly, NEA main (Level 40).I find her perks super useful and helpful. Don’t fully understand the NEA meme/hate.
---
As for Killer, which I rarely play, I enjoy Doc. Also not SUPER Meta
---
Shouldn't this be on r/dbdgonewild
---
It might just be the ranks but what the hell is this legion even doing?
---
I never wiggle, and I only get the hatch about 15% of the time. I mean, that's better than zero, but the odds of getting hatch are still pretty low. More often, the killer will actually take me to the hatch, and either hook me in front of it or close it then hook me.
---
they should make a portal/trap killer hybrid that sets traps that teleport survivors to a different trap set nearby
---
later baby 😘 don't come back, please.
---
This post is not supposed to villainize killers. It's just supposed to show how pathetic some people are. Could have been a survivor aswell.
---
Ace because Ace and because he is one of the quietest survivors, and Wraith and Myers because i like stealthy killers
---
What if the that same killer used lockers to teleport while the traps are something else altogether?
---
I'm not sure there's really a point to run his build with having at least T1 Sloppy. Since otherwise the slowdown from just Thana is not really impressive and it's the combination of thana and sloppy that makes the build really work.
---
Wasn’t really complaining just mocking killers that rely on it to get kills
---
Added Huntress
---
You missed the point. He's saying he would have easily completed the challenge by now if people didn't DC. A good loadout doesn't help if one salty butthole DC's just to spite you.
---
Your first games as killer and survivor will reward you with bonus XP. Doesn't help with BP, but it helps with the Rift progress, and earning Iridescent Shards.
---
Yessss
---
The samination one?
---
Seeing an h3 meme out in the wild warms my cold heart.
---
Oh this goes against about 50 rules in the survivors rulebook for killers
---
The doctor is literally worse than clown at this point. Either you’re salty, bad or both.
---
Nah dude I saw your ridiculous comment thread where you complained a ton and called it bullshit.
---
I mean it was just a joke but it usually works for me, and I always give the hatch to the last survivor if he doesn’t wiggle
---
What a caveat, "if you're not great with them". So what you're saying is that it's a must-have if you're bad lol.
---
I don't get it
---
Clown to legion: COUGHAGAAAAUGH GHA HAHGH SNIIIIFFF COUGH
---
so...using them what they're made for? hello?
---
Survivor: Jane, because she’s thicc af
---
Killer: Freddy, even before his rework.
---
After like 6 months I've finally gotten the hang of basic looping and making plays, and I feel pretty content. I'm not in this game to rank up, just to hang around in green ranks and enjoy myself. I used to get frustrated with myself for sucking complete ass at this game and dying all the time, but now I generally feel confident about running the Killer. I still struggle vs Killers like Spirit but that's alright for now. I'm trying to learn how to spin and get consistent flashlight saves next lmao.
---
Also a minor thing is that I have a bigger survivor pool to play now.  I used to *only* play Ash, and he's still my #1, but now I rotate between him, Nancy, Steve, Jake, and sometimes others. At the end of the day they're basically just skins, but I like the variety.
---
Yea it’s bullshit when a bad killer gets kills with it.
---
So it’s kinda bullshit.
---
i feel a locker based power wouldn't work well because the areas that have lockers tend to have a good amount clustered together so youd have difficulty pinpointing the right one to teleport to, and then there's also the problem of there's a lot of dead areas with few to no lockers to be found
---
I'm a rank 15 killer on PC, I played 6 killer games today, and in 4 of them I played against whole teams of rank 7 to 10s and got bullied.
---
What the fuck?
---
Gotta make you mad so you focus on them, they're doing what they planned on doing ig
---
They don't deserve the challenge? Fucking lol, that's the stupidest shit I ever heard. Iri heads aren't a free win. They're unfair, but I've beaten iri heads multiple times because I'm not a bitch who DC's immediately when a game doesn't go my way.
---
Poor legion getting bullied like always.
---
What am I missing here, just looks like NOED
---
No one said that it was supposed to villainize killers tho?
---
Well too unfortunately to make for bad matchmaking times the game will match you against players up to 6 ranks higher then you. Going against rank 10s will happen but yeah you should not have matched with rank sevens. It’s ridiculous sometimes
---
Just use whichever one you’re most comfortable with. Keyboard and mouse gives you more control over specific movements and actions if that’s all you’re interested in.
---
Dead By Daylight has the funniest glitches. I whacked a Survivor working on a generator when I was Myers once and the next thing I knew we were both stuck inside the gen and all we could do was spin around while the others just pointed at us.
---
Borrowed time is a thing because some killers like to camp the hook for a kill. Noed is basically a perk based around losing the game and securing a kill you never deserved.
---
I gave level 70 and am a third of a way through tome 4. I'm not rushing those challenges though, I'm trying to win my games.
---
Love the hair! One of my fav spirit drawings
---
I imagined a Hank Hill voice
---
This game's description in the store should be like:
---
Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer (4vs1) horror game where four players take on the role of the savage Survivors, and the other player plays as the Killer, trying to escape the Survivors and avoid being stunned, blinded and t-bagged
---
Survivors play in third-person and have the advantage of better situational awareness. The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their tears..
---
The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easy, especially when the environment is Mt. Ormond every time you play.
---
This question is a meme but people seem to not get it anymore
---
This has been done God knows how many times though
---
I got to rank 2 playing her perkless and addonless. I assure you I know my shit
---
Yeah id prefer it tbh, kinda tired of rank 1s bringing in rank 15-20 friends into lobbies
---
Other times, you'll be lucky to go longer than a couple of seconds without skill checks
---
is this funny?
---
Don’t know what to tell you, he obviously just had the better gaming chair
---
I see some stupid behaviour at red ranks but not like this. This happens a lot as well and usually when I check post game they are 10 ranks or so lower than me. Yes I am gonna see some dumb stuff at red ranks but the whole reason I stay at red ranks is for good team mates, this completely contradicts that.
---
Yeah and I should have the option to dodge that lobby instead of waiting to go into a game I'm gonna get frustrated by and not have fun. I'd take longer quality over quantity any day.
---
I have a group I play with but it's not possible for us to be on at all the same times all the time. Also the whole point of a ranking system is that you don't roll the dice and you are teamed up with people of a similar skill level..
---
Idk if Insane is the right word, you get this one survivor in every game and it's insanely easy to do, spin in a circle then around him in a circle so it's pretty average but good job.
---
I don't understand.  Whats the point of playing if it isnt scary?  The game fucking sucks without horror.
---
I see one possibility as to what gen rush could be: all survivors ignoring hooked players and doing gens. Otherwise, gen rush is not a thing. Dbd is about doing gens.
---
I sense a Japanese here........ eh, must've been the wind \*vaults window\*
---
The biggest thing about chases is gaining distance. The killer will try to cut you off, your job is to block him from doing so. This gives you enough time to make your way to a window or a pallet.
---
My favorite way of doing this is going thorough a window or dropping a pallet, and then running in a direction that the killer can’t immediately go to. For example, you vault through a window of an L shaped wall. You can either go left where the killer can meet you on the other side, or go the right where there’s a wall in the way.  This creates distance because the killer has to go around the wall or take the time to vault through it. Your mistake in the video was running shack the direction of the window, which is where the trapper cut you off. 
---
Once you’ve gotten used to this, I’d recommend faking the direction you go. For a few seconds, the killer will be going in the opposite direction of you. Don’t do this all of the time because the killer will catch on, but in a pinch it can work. 
---
My other tip would be to be aware of the pallets and windows around you. Once you’ve gained the distance, it can be for nothing if you have nothing to work with. 
---
I also noticed your dead hard. Be careful when you use your dead hard. The most efficient way of using a dead hard is to gain the distance needed to make it through a window or pallet you normally wouldn’t, try to avoid using it when he’s about to swing. If you’re not running to a pallet or window and you use dead hard, the killer will quickly make up the distance and just smack you down anyway.
---
Imagine having to get to level 50 when 1 level feels like 8 in 1 year.
---
r/okbuddydaylight
---
Welp.. at least they weren’t intentionally sabotaging you
---
Sloppy really makes the build, I'd probably try something else while you don't have it. I don't play GF though so I can't recommend anything.
---
Just get t1 sloppy and it's the same build
---
Yikes, now that’s a tilter
---
I'm pretty sure the trophy is to mori all 4 so yes a DC counts as a kill but it does not count as a mori
---
After 800 hours, I can finally hit every ruin skill checks...
---
If the weather is over 25 degrees Celsius
---
And after I have woken up for 5 hours when my brain is at its peak functionality
---
Yeah you get the idea
---
Traps are so stupidly broken right now.
---
then they run directly into the killer and complain about tunneling in the postgame chat
---
I didn’t, but if you prefer to just bitch instead of be proactive, by all means go ahead
---
I think the game still registers you as standing, so if you see a huntress winding up, get ready to crouch! That should be able to waste her time and keep you safe :)
---
It’s frustrating and yea if the killer can’t get a single kill without noed they aren’t very good. And I’m red ranks and not everyone runs prove thyself and toolboxes quit exaggerating. 
---
Was just stating it’s annoying to die because a killer chose to play a single perk
---
lol the original image is mine
---
He was also purposefully stepping in his own traps because he knew that's what was causing it
---
It’s just frustrating to die because killer chose to play a single perk. And I’m red ranks and not everyone runs fool boxes and prove thyself so quit exaggerating
---
Pretty good comment so far.   
---
But seriously, you are spot on. I use "gen rush" as a shorthand for "effectively working gens" and it's less of an accusation and more of a statement that the survivors are being efficient.   
---
Ultimately, there isn't much Killers can do in-game to be "toxic" that actually progresses the game in their favor, outside of 3 gens as you mentioned; other than maybe a mori, but that leads to a safety pip unless you multi hook first. 
---
Where as survivors can make the killer feel bullied when they are all on comms and very coordinated. For them being "toxic" is very much playing towards an escape/win. 
---
The way I look at the game, considering that I play both roles at red ranks, is that winning is whether or not I pip. If you only gauge your wins by escaping or getting 4Ks/3Ks then you are going to bitter for each role respectively. But if you just play the game, practice your craft and try to go for pips, most people feel much better at the end of the day. /rant
---
Yeah agreed. When I played with my rank 15 friend when I was rank 5 I tried to help him out as much as possible as well but it wasn't fun for him either when the killer is still rank 8 or so.
---
We got some salt i see. Tell me, what happened?
---
r/dbdgonegay wants your location
---
This made me laugh I feel ashamed
---
Clearly boosted
---
Were gonna live forever us just posing koichi.
---
having the mentality is always going to be a trick from the killer and getting free hatch sometimes its actually refreshing, because i dont struggle if im the last one, and not because i want free hatch but because its pointless, if you dont know where the hatch is you are just delaying the unevitable... also when killer close the hatch i just stay still until im killed, got bored of the mindgames with the doors , i have escape decent amount of times 1v1 hatch close to try it anymore.... i just go the the fridge and get something to drink while he finishes me, oof
---
Uhhh when did say everyone did it? Didn't exaggerate anything, just made the point that EGC =/= Bad Killer.
---
I always hear it in (this)[https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ] voice
---
Just wanted to mention it before this gets into another 100 comment long discussion about who is more toxic.
---
It’s not bullying to use intended game mechanics to survive and help your teammates survive. No one has any idea what rank other players are until after the game. Also no one has any idea how the killer is gonna behave when they get that down. Camping and tunnelling are always a possibility (also not bullying despite them being extremely shitty) so why would you not do everything in your power to deny them that?
---
Correct, failing a hex skill check is only 4 seconds. 
---
So if you get 6 skill checks and failed, you would have been faster tapping.
---
Tbh I only tap if there is another person on a gen with me and there is ruin. One person? Work thru. Two? Tap. 
---
Two people it is totally possible to get more than 6 failed checks in 80 seconds
---
Gore-geous
---
Rank 9 can go against survivors rank 15 to 3 with no problem according to matchmaking rules. Anything outside of this range is just matchmaking widening even more because of queue times.
---
Cool, so atm I would run:
---
Whispers for information, BBQ and chilli for info on where survivors are trying to take their reverse bear traps off and to predict their route and also for the blood points to get more perks faster, sloppy butcher so that they are A) gonna spend more time healing and thus slow gen progress down and allow you to sneak up on them with whispers whilst healing or B) stay injured and do gens which makes your crouch attack a lot more dangerous. For the final perk you really need something tro try and help with gens but you don't really have anything worth using so I would probably just try and get more lethality instead; make your choice, noed or hell even franklins to make them drop that toolbox that would help them gen rush or that medkit they are gonna need more vs sloppy butcher.
---
Ah yeah I should have noticed because you have their teachables :D
---
Well definitely get monitor and abuse because it is decent on all three of them;
---
On Myers it reduced his ew2 terror radius from 16 to 8 metres and on huntress even though she has the lullaby a lot of survivors just ignore it because it's not directional and they aren't going to leave a gen every time she is within 40 metres of them. So monitor and abuse can help you sneak up and get a good hatchet shot on out of position survivors. The increased FOV also helps your throws a bit.
---
I would make sure you get ruin and the bonus of levelling hag is that she has devour hope too. If you really don't want to then I would say corrupt intervention is pretty good on Myers and huntress. I would also highly reccomend pop as well. 
---
Atm these would be my builds for the 3 you mentioned:
---
Myers; Ruin or corrupt, discordance, infectious fright and monitor and abuse or you could do spirit fury and enduring
---
Huntress: Discordance, nurse's calling, Ruin or corrupt and BBQ and chilli
---
So hopefully that helps a bit.
---
It really is annoying, for me it shows me grabbing them from the window and then they just run off.
---
If they actually said this and it isn't people putting words in their mouth again, that's honestly one of the worst statements I've ever heard.
---
I call him chicken legs... lovingly.
---
would be relatable if the game didn’t reset my rank each time I close the game
---
Lol a group did that once and made fun of me for dying, too funny.
---
Its an issue with the ranking system itself. The issue goes both ways. I dont play much due to my lack of time and often stop for a long time due to this and the disgusting perk grind with the retarded bloodweb driving me away (whats the Point of having all those killers when i cant even enjoy them? Either i dont play them or i play them with trash perks. Hooray for having my first rank 3 perk on Demo! Its monstrous shrine, not even joking. Dont even start with playing survivor. The thought of all the grind i still have for Killers, all that again? Makes me want to vomit) i have to restart at r20 often (not that it makes much difference, my highest rank so far was 12) and the amount of survivors i run into running only metaperks all Level 3 is unreal. What are people whos steam profile shows them at over 1000 hours doing at these ranks?
---
This is the idea that the dev's have, people are arguing alot about it on twitter, but they don't suggest your rank goes down 5-7 ranks instead they will make the ranks different for every single killer
---
Dang tiny killers would be scarier than the stalkers lol
---
of course ur name is weeb waifu
---
I can't believe people actually care, as  long as the point of the message gets across.
---
u can see my camera tilt down cause i was scared and rank 20
---
You're only rank 20 and already calling a killer OP. Ok?
---
How tf is same going to carry someone?
---
Huntress mains rise up
---
I did not know I needed that in my life and now I do thanks!
---
Any advice on ghostface? He’s hard to play and quite frankly, a piece of shit right now. Survivors usually get tens done before I do anything, finding them is hard, and they somehow spot me no matter what, even at angles where I can’t stalk. Help pls
---
i got it when i was brand new to the game about a year ago. was against a doctor and the other three survivors dcd. he let me do the needed gens and leave 😂
---
Wat about my gey?
---
I got lucky as a trapper on bedham.  Basement spawned in school.  1st down got hooked in basement.  2nd trapped on stairs going for save.  3rd was slugged in the school going for save 4th got trapped at entrance to school.  No one had unbreakable or dc’d.  
---
But yeah it had nothing to do with skill at all.  Just try your best.
---
Come on man, the game is about serial killers, not genocists.
---
Crazy. I literally did this exact same thing, and use those cosmetics. Small world
---
It's big
---
Thank you
---
Ah screw it, make danny devito a killer.
---
. Ps4 is constant fast games in red rank for me. Am a red rank killer. The one thing I’d say is sometimes the game gets choppy but I play at 3-4am hence the time of this comment US east time. And played roughly 10 ish matches tonight and didn’t recognize familiar names , lowest survivor I seen today was a 7 but rest wer 3 and up consistently. I am a 2 btw
---
Survivors will DC to deny it. Wait until they add DC husks.
---
Joe
---
Just start practicing hitting great skill check. if you can consistently hit great skill checks, it's better than gen tapping. I rarely ever gen tap but i only do it when i need to finish a gen at 95% and the killer is nearby.
---
Looks fucking awesome!
---
Had that happend two times in one game on gen grabs. Dedicated servers were a mistake.
---
I think Hags are memeing when they put them all together, I always burst into laughter and then die, when she does that. No clue why I find it so funny though.
---
It happened to me as well. I started playing October 2017 lol. Crazy how that's still a thing. Maybe writing a ticket helps.
---
She could've made it if she sticked next to the wall... poor Meg!
---
I prefer Mr Envy's songs
---
I’m in serious need of help right now , cuz with the time I have to spend hunting survivors, then attempting to stalk, only for them to get away, and then having them cancel my stalk, and repeat, the instadown is no longer is worth shit given I could have smacked them twice then hooked them. How do I play this bitch?
---
Dwight with a kite
---
I think you're mistaken
---
Anything on tik tok is cringe
---
I've been getting smashed by rank 2 swfs all day.
---
I made a basement hag build for that but was putting points into my doctor as he’s getting reworked.
---
I haven’t noticed the time running out and got into the match as doc
---
Bbq, distressing, devour (destroyed at 0 stacks), Nurses Calling. No addons, red ranks.
---
Clown map with the basement in the middle. I’m like “fuck. A good map...”
---
But then I thought it might work!
---
I have met many bugs this match, many more than it’s normal. For example, 2/4 basement hooks broke and I couldn’t hook people on them. It bouced me off and canceled the hooking animation
---
I had 3 basement kills, closed the hatch and the last person knowing what I’m doing, ran to the corner of the map over and over again just to fuck with me. Like gdi you’re dead anyway, stop being a dick
---
I eventually got her to the basement, she wiggled off and entered the locker. She tried to head on me, i got the grab animation which got canceled by her entering the locker, then i opened the locker which got canceled by her head-oning me (good fucking job BHVR, dedicated servers working great)
---
With like 10 seconds left on the EGC timer, I managed to get her on the basement hook
---
Challenge done with a wrong build
---
Tl;dr: get a good map
---
That's sounds like a game I need to watch
---
I like it. I already went with the myc bbq build tho. Snowballing through survivors is so satisfying. And it works so well.
---
I love that you said go get some tea. I’ll always hear “go make a sandwich” but tea?  Adorable.
---
If you want you can check how the build works its my latest build
---
Like medium vaults
---
Maybe blood hound if you have that? Nothing will compare to it except the actual build but at least blood kinda gives benefit to wounding everyone.
---
I usually just do one gen when ruin is active to show the killer that we don't care about ruin!.... and then i still spend the next ten minutes looking for it.
---
I've commented sone stuff below, but basically, survs can stare at him before you stalk or even see them. So while i try to stalk them and 1 shot kill, they repair the gens and cancel out my power. Its literally worse than running around using basic attacks. Pls help
---
Yeah, it’s not a bad perk! I just don’t go back to hook often, because I hope I’m already in another chase by the time they get unhooked. 
---
You like nurses on spirit? I’ve used it plenty of times but it was never that helpful for me. I’m always in phase and they always hear me coming, or they’re in the corner of the map healing and I won’t waste my time doing that.
---
&gt;And if you're a lower rank survivor who's got buddies in higher ranks and you decide to play sfw with them to boost yourself, Please find people to play in your own rank.
---
This is not how it works anymore. Just saying.
---
Its for when myc activates so i can find unhooker and unhooked fast.
---
Someone was actually trying to trash talk me and they talked like a pirate, so I just said "go walk the plank, lad"
---
Nope, Myer's tier 3 doesn't go away either and I'm pretty sure Plague doesn't lose her corruption either.
---
On it's own no it's not. With sloppy or dying light (on certain killers) then yes. With ruin it is ok but once ruins gone then no.
---
Who?
---
Just read your post. Yeah I’ve been playing for a long time, I know the drill lol. MYC is good on Hag but I still would prefer monitor on her and STBFL, ruin bbq. I’m just not a nurses player, I can’t bring myself to keep it on longer than a match or two
---
Fat Joe
---
First you really want a map with a nice center basement that you can easily get to. Lery's imo has one of the best center basement spawns.
---
Second, you really only need to have survivors die on hook, so it might be best to hook a few people outside of the basement on their first or second hooks to keep survivors from just avoiding the basement area altogether.
---
Personally I did it with Freddy without any perks to help put people in the basement like Agitation or Iron Grasp. I just had a good map with a center basement and put people on their death hooks in the basement after forcing them to run closer to the center.
---
Matchmaking is ass right now, and yet games are still taking forever to get into as survivor on console. I’m a rank 4 survivor and I’ll get a green rank killer, not sure what’s up?  But honestly, I wish they would match us based on hours played because rank truly means nothing in this game.
---
I think match making is kinda broken atm. I've faced a few green rank 10 or 11 killers as a rank 2/3 survivor the other night and the rest of my team is either red rank or like rank 5.
---
Hag got what she deserverd , glad you made it
---
How tf did the original perk get released anyway. The devs must have made it specifically for ghostface and didn’t think of it being a teachable.
---
Even if they're going up against Killers closer to the rank of the lower ranked survivors, it's still boosting tf out of the lower ranked survivors.
---
Well, all of us have opinions. What should i put on my spirit instead of nurses? Maybe change the build a bit.
---
you mean the ancestor's voice from Darkest Dungeon?
---
&gt;Even if they're going up against Killers closer to the rank of the lower ranked survivors, it's still boosting tf out of the lower ranked survivors.
---
So people can't play with their friends no matter what?
---
A killer who uses the mirrors could be interesting. Like in one phase/mode they're almost invisible and you can only see their reflection, etc.
---
On console she is hard to lose but you can just run her around in the open for the whole game  so shes basically the wirst killer in the game
---
Literally the only thing stopping me from buying killer skins is the fact I won’t get to enjoy them as the killer
---
It’s your lucky day. Some details might not be right (I wrote that from my memory) but I was streaming it. I’ll try to find the replay
---
Evan is my boy. I understand Evan. He’s just trying to do what’s best.
---
If you have surge and surveillance there is a glitch where all gens stay white if they were regressed by surge. Could try this with pop?
---
Do you think it will get fixed any time soon?
---
I’m confused, why is billy always in posts like this?
---
Always know its a bad killer if they complain about flashlight saves lmao. Fake pick up the survivor then you got a easy hit. If someone flashlights at pallets its an advantage to the killer due to the survivor not running away.
---
When she looks up and you after being on ur pp
---
I hope not but probably at some point lol. Otz uses it on his strongest freddy build
---
Balance Update: Reverse Bear Traps will now only activate when completing the *first* generator. We feel like this will make playing against The Pig more fun experience for survivors.
---
Holy shit.  Did you miss an /s after this foolery?
---
How are you going to tell me matchmaking is not ass? At least for survivor on PS4.  As a red rank survivor; I shouldn’t be getting paired with greens and browns, that’s not fair to the killers. 
---
I complained about matchmaking and queue times, yes. In the same sentence. Yes.  Why not? Queue times for survivor are long as fuck just to be paired with the wrong rank players.  
---
“I’ll try to dumb it down for you maybe you’ll understand”  Yet WE’RE THE IGNORANT ONES IN THIS COMMUNITY??  You just replied to me so mad that it’s embarrassing that I’m even replying back to you.  I promise I won’t be losing sleep over this, but I know for a fact you’ll project your ignorance and bullshit on others and dwell on shit for days. 
---
“Why devs can’t fix shit” ok sure let me post on reddit to talk about how GREAT matchmaking is. That’ll sure get the ball rolling! 
---
If you’re so fucking awesome, why don’t you go work for the devs? 
---
It’s not a bug. Rank 20s-16 gets paired with each other because we can’t derail past 16 unless we don’t play for months. 
---
If I’m a rank 4 survivor and my friend is a 20, he’s still getting a red rank killer. 
---
I’ve been saying it should be based around hours played or something like that. Because theirs plenty of players who are rank 15s who have played over 300+ hours and rank 1s who’ve only played 100 or less. It’s too easy to rank up and it doesn’t help anyone. 
---
Don’t EVER reply back being an asshole to someone because you have your little girl panties in a twist. Please take a break from the game and this subbredit if you’re gonna be this type of person. It’s not cute
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/524002173?t=11659s
---
Again, sorry for details I got wrong. Now that I think about it, devour might’ve had a stack and the locker thing happened somewhere else
---
Clown would accidentally RKO the pallet trying to vault it
---
It didnt die
---
Yes exactly! That’s why I always propose hours played! 
---
Also; did you see what that person replied to me said? Talk about psycho lmao
---
Dedicated hacking is what we are going with here.
---
I basically only play demodoggo. Something about playing as a monster is WAY more fun than playing as anything else. I did used to play wraith though before flowerman came out.
---
They cant even fix the normal gamemode and you would like to have other modes 😂 Those Devs sucks ass cant even fix a bug in years...pathetic
---
You know how easy it is to tell if a killer is picking someone and how is someone bad if they complain. Only bad survivors complain about spirit, nurse and camping just don’t go down
---
Now I want to see Clown charging at everything and everyone with his belly like a Rugby player.
---
not to mention, its hard to control in which one u will teleport after....specially if they r looking the same direction.
---
It's hard to rank up, when 3 of your teammates die in first 4 minutes, on super small map and without swf
---
A wild sentence if you dont know the context
---
Someone here watches Pewdiepie
---
What’s wrong with it?
---
yes, happend to me 5 times
---
I remember times, when you could into match as both sides, stretching from rank 20 to rank 9
---
Dude no I hate to tell you this but since you’re new don’t try to please the survivors.
---
How do you get a score of 6?
---
In less than 2 minutes
---
BBQ is incredible on Billy, especially on maps he can saw across well. You can chase down people across the entire map incredible fast. Basically just adds to his already stupidly good map pressure, plus double BP.
---
I can't not hear samination when I read this.
---
Just because the survivor is injured doesn’t mean they are going to go for the flashlight save if they have iron will which is a perk that is commonly used unless I’m running stridor then I can find them however that takes up a perk slot and perks like light born will only work a few times before survivors realize that it’s pointless using a flashlight. 
---
Secondly your point about nurse not having counter play isn’t valid at all as a goos survivor will know to fake running towards the nurse to put her into fatigue giving the survivor extra distance. And spirit can be countered with iron will, spine chill and maybe even light weight it’s also possible to use scratch marks to mind game her to make her think she is following you any good survivor should know this
---
Oh, Yeah that’s weird as fuck
---
AFK, and maybe some points in Bold category
---
&gt; It’s not a bug. Rank 20s-16 gets paired with each other because we can’t derail past 16 unless we don’t play for months. If I’m a rank 4 survivor and my friend is a 20, he’s still getting a red rank killer.
---
&gt; 
---
Devs literally just said this specific case for matchmaking is bugged and they are going to work on it after holidays. This is how misinformed you are about DBDs matchmaking yet feel knowledgeable enough to complain about it.
---
Yeah, sorry I couldn't be "nicer", I am just so sick of ignorant people complaining about matchmaking and I could only politely reply so much. I tried, people continue to embrace ignorance.
---
how exactly is “scientifically” proven? if u wanna talk about statistics, then10% give hatch...rest are sweaty for the 4k
---
It's understandable. Cosmetic items are very poorly implemented imo, like there could've been different models for hatchets, chainsaws, different particle effects for Doctor's shock, Clown's potion, maybe a blaze trail after a chainsaw sprint.. gore and blood flowing everywhere when Bubba mauls players etc. Different kill animations.. different hums for Huntress.
---
Instead you get a different type of t-shirt, jeans, a hat for a character played only in first person.. maybe you can enjoy looking at a new weapon.. and of course my personal favorite hook charms. I really enjoy, hanging around my hooks and watch the dangling charms sitting there..
---
And lastly the pricing. Pay 10$ for a cosmetic, you wont even see or experience, unless you are not playing. A DLC with playable characters and actual content and the base game are 80% of the time cheaper than any of the cosmetic items added.
---
Console killers KEKW
---
Definitely should be a new skin for Spirit.
---
&gt;...no that's not what I'm saying. If you've got friends in your rank play with them. If you've got higher ranks friends, get yourself into those ranks then play with them, otherwise you're boosted.
---
So what you are saying is, I can't play with my friends until they go  from rank 20 to whatever my rank is?
---
i really like how noed has lego heads
---
Franklins is also a good alternative for flashlights. Im sorry crying about flashlights and saying they're hard to counter and then saying that nurse and spirit have easy counterplay is ridiculous. A good nurse can easily counter your first point and spirit requires multiple perks to be countered as you say. Im not saying spirit and nurse are op, im just saying that flashlights are more counterable than them.
---
Even if you get hit twice and get down you still get more than 500 BP, 6 is just wtf
---
&gt; Let me say; before you message me some lengthy ass message again that I probably won’t read. You play on PC. Two different survivor worlds from us PS4 players. So you don’t have FACTS you have crappy opinions without realizing that we aren’t going to have the same issues you have vice versus.
---
There aren't that much differences between platforms when it comes to general way of how the game works. The main difference between PC and consoles currently is dedicated servers. 
---
All this information is free for everyone, all you have to do is watch dev streams or at least read devs notes more regularly. They explain everything there but people don't watch it and then complain about stuffs they tirelessly explain there. 
---
I would gather evidence to shove up your face but just can't be bothered to do that work now because in a few minutes another thread will probably be created again. So no, this isn't just "crappy opinions".
---
Yeah... Some people just don't understand anything I swear. Whatever is all I have to say
---
He left poor guy and those traps are now where near each other
---
Some people think camping is holding the game hostage. Some people aren't very bright.
---
Plague does lose her corruption, it was added after she was released. Initially it didn’t but after like a month or so they changed to where it does.
---
Again?
---
Reflective textures (mirrors) are generally very high quality and would increase loading times significantly as dynamic lighting and reflective effects would need more building time.
---
I dont think camping is holding the game hostage but it is fucking annoying as fucking fuck.
---
Ah, then I stand corrected there, but I stand by my point.
---
Alot of people are complaining to me after every match lmao. I honestly dont know what they want either.
---
&gt;Alot of people are complaining to me after every match lmao. I honestly dont know what they want either.

She continues to be just as boring to play against but the nerf happened.
---
Is it bannable?

---
You know you’ve had a bad night of dbd when you see this and instantly think it’s probably you
---
Wait? Like few days ago or what? I dont really know what was changed. Or are you talking about the collision thingy.
---
BHVR you can literally make infinite money c’mon
---
Bikini Freddy or I stop playing this game
---
I did that for the last one after getting 3 stuns on a clown. The gates were open, so I went to the killer shack and started vaulting the window. Then when I heard the terror radius I stood at the pallet and waited for him to hit me. I still managed to escape. But this was after dozens of matches.
---
We can't get all 4 of them like that, so use Windows of Opportunity to see where the pallets are and wait for a match where you can get 2 stuns normally, them you do that.
---
I would actually be scared if that chased after me
---
The trap was right next to the stone in the beginning and the Trapper walked around it with quite a distance, but then he somehow got trapped and the trap right next to the stone disappeared. Its not his fault
---
He tries to, but he's shy, so he tries it while cloaked.
---
I defend bleeding out survivors that run away from hook for a guaranteed break. There's literally nothing they can do at that point but leave them, Though they have to try at least once before confirming a bleedout. This happened to me once, 2 Players tried to hide against my whisper enabled doc but when it failed they ran into the furthest fucking corner and waited, I downed her in confusion but when I tried to hook her there was no fucking way. After she broke free she ran right back to that spot so i walked over, Downed her and walked away. The last guy ended up running there as well but i think one was actually destroyed since I hooked him
---
Probably the same people who were bringing survivors into the basement during that glitch because they had a challenge or it was an easy hook.
---
They always tweak and experiment with MM, usually without notifying users. As a Rank 1 killer, I get quite upset when I'm matched with a SWF and his Rank 16 buddies that get utterly slaughtered: it's boring and a waste of my time/add-ons
---
Pull your head out of your ass man. There's a higher majority of players who have explained matchmaking. I know about the 6 above 6below thing and it heavily needs to be reworked. Rank 11 killers should not be going up against rank 3 or higher survivors. That's it.
---
All hail Our Lord and Savior Meg Thomas!
---
maybe it’s one of the player’s friend?
---
talia mar and then all her friends and boyfriend, they aren’t like the best but they are still pretty good
---
so I just watched it and the survs deserved it lol switching the character to ones with toolboxes before the game starts and not being able to finish the gen with 4 brand new parts and also going down so fast. This is a brand new level of noobness. being toxic, salty and being lame in this game is a fun combination. Its a wonder that they didnt dc lol
---
Welcome to the DBD community. Try to enjoy your stay if you can
---
ohmwrecker, he posts some really good full gameplays of both the killer and survivors
---
Personally i tell everyone to stay on gens and let me die lol basement bubba is scary, Though i will never leave without trying to save a random who waits through idle and taps while no one tries to save him. He clearly understands the situation and will not die on my watch, Unfortunately it's a soul for a soul and i kill myself on the hook if the situation looks bad for their odds
---
it can be ruin
---
Its actually pretty hard to get a wraith stun, cause it takes a more than 'just pointing the flashlight' at the wraith.
---
Keyboard is best but if you play better with a controller you do you :)
---
Check for hatch lol bad killer lol
---
Dude survivors are like 8 year olds with a microphone
---
Yeah that would've completed the ultimate garbageness. Do you think he was baiting? I couldnt tell.
---
Maybe you shouldn't have replied in the first play then? Matchmaking needs reworking either way.
---
[Dead by Daylight | Live Q&amp;A](https://youtu.be/vde613ZMd88?t=3522)
---
Either what Horvath said or SWF in your lobby.
---
But Remember me isnt contraproducent? I mean, you want them to open the doors fast
---
*he's hackingguUUUUHh*
---
It's not holding the game hostage, because the game will eventually end. In 4 minutes that is.
---
They tweak matchmaking very regularly. I'm pretty jealous you get Ranks 1s, as a Rank 1 killer it's very uncommon for me to get the same rank survivors. I love the challenge of a really good survivor.
---
Karma_Cookie just read your r/entitledparents, You seem like a very cool mom, me personally when i queue i got like 2k hours and when they ask for age and I say 14 they just leave, I know how it feels and i hope you find someone to queue with :)
---
You can open a gate yourself to have bloodwarden ready while they waste time on the other.
---
Is it 3 or 4. I forgot.
---
I just said it;)
---
What a shame, it was so odd how he was so far away and then i just got downed lol. hope he can get a better connection soon for his sake.
---
xD
---
shh shh shh xD
---
Don't forget the time challenges give a lot of BP too.
---
I mean who wouldn't surrender to futanari
---
Damn. I didnt even know it was that long after a year playing. Ty.
---
It's always the last one when I play survivor and always the first one when I play Piggy
---
Yes it is ridiculous though. Spending 4 minutes in a video game not able to do anything.
---
Joe Mama
---
Basically this. Especially with vaults. You just have to time things earlier in most cases.
---
True that's why I do feel for them sometimes but like, there would be no way to get to a hook so why try.
---
I leave them to die if I realise because I don't want to reward the killer otherwise they'll keep doing it. I would love to sacrifice myself but even a borrowed time play is risky. If I had a scyptic agent with borrowed time then I would make a play fo sho
---
And then you find out they cleansed all your totems, they 99 the gates to avoid blood warden and the obsession powers the gates
---
why is this so cute
---
Darn.
---
Clown isn't that awful, especially with exhaustion add-ons. He can be bullied hard though and lacks mobility. I can't play him though for more than a match because his laugh is so annoying xD
---
For entertainment i'd say monto and farmer john.
---
For learning i'd recommend not otzdarva and tru3talent for killer side, and ussylis for survivir side.
---
Special mention to umbra if you want to see a good huntress.
---
Small correction: your terror radius is bigger in chase, not back to normal. Synergises very well with infectious fright.
---
If they open the gate more slowly it gives you more time to set up the hook. But everyone 99s the gates anyway most of the time
---
Its either Demi found harry potters invisible cape or its leaked footage of Demi's new ability
---
You should report him for big abuse, he knew what caused it and kept using it
---
It's what happens to most of my plans at red ranks lol.
---
I AM SAYING THAT WHENEVER I USE A YELLOW MORI, EVERY SURVIVOR TYPICALLY GOES UNHOOKED THE ENTIRE MATCH, AND WHEN THREE SURVIVORS ESCAPE, THE LAST SURVIVOR ESCAPES AS WELL.
---
Yesterday I was playing against a Nurse who was super cool with me and the other survivor(the other two died) we healed, I stunned her, making gens while she destroyed them, by the end I could just escape and get more bloodpoints but instead I just pointed to the hook, she killed me and received even more bloodpoints, that's what you receive for being a good survivor
---
I did it on the first try. Wtf is your problem, guys? Noone is foing gens anyway.
---
Spirit in junji ito style... I LOVE IT!
---
And im sliding over pallets when I shoot!
---
So we would need the game to be absolutely optimized before that? That sucks. =\\
---
I'm rank 4 Surv, usually playing 2man swf either with my purple rank friend or other red rank friend, and we get matched against rank 16 killers. It's dumb
---
*fixes gens faster* BITCH IM BOBBY W THE TOOLS
---
I mean. I can believe that it was your intention. But no way I believe that you blocked it well enough to take the hit xD
---
Or the asylum
---
lol had that too, fuck this community lol there are so many toxic kids in this game
---
Thank you, the fact that someone's been through the hell I've been through to get this shit done is relieving.
---
I don't want to risk being a toxic dick and hook, camp and make the game toxic for a survivor just for a challenge, even if it gives a good amount of bp. Its just not fun for anyone
---
If they did a Trick or Treat chapter it would be similar to the shape
---
I love this game
---
Put on Spinechill and Premonition and you don’t even need it lmao
---
Yeeeeah. I turn my messages off when playing dbd on ps4 now. You get hatemail if you win or lose.
---
Freddy is amazing ngl
---
welcome to cesspool, enjoy your stay.
---
I'm so hyped for this one. I'm such a big fan of Tom Cruise.
---
The only way you guys would ever get this is if the devs figured out how to monetize it.
---
Yeah happend to me alot lately \^\^
---
Yeah there is. Gen tapping is a cheap exploit by people unwilling to learn to hit great skill checks. Abs no, I'm not a killer main
---
Borrowed Time + Decisive’d right into the open exit gate, with a little teabag thrown in .
---
all you had to do was hold the sprint button.
---
For some reason ghostfaces and wraiths tend to be really nice in my experience. If someone DC’s a lot of ghostfaces I’ve met will either let us farm around or give us a little headstart to even the odds.
---
https://imgur.com/N6qU5H7
---
Just name it appropriately and it should work!
---
Man that hurts all the time, I'm sorry you had to go through that. 
---
I had a match where I was in the middle of hooking a survivor early in the game and he disconnected. And since he was with his friends they all dced right after... Rip my 30 minute wait time 
---
Survivors need to realize that we're people, not sand castles to kick over
---
Its not easy to jus "push through" 
---
Sometimes we cant do that with 2 ppl on hooks 40 second into the game.
---
I got mass downvoted because of saying this...
---
People get so emotionally invested in this game. Who gives a fuck if someone presses their crouch button, honestly :D 
---
In any case if you're one of the sensible people playing this game the survivor is just wasting their time making your job as a killer easier.
---
Why did you remove the best part? The end game comments
---
i am cornholio! i need tp for my bunghole
---
tbh... gg is annoying af too.just click continue and stfu. Lmao.
---
1 year and half to hit r1? Lmao
---
Stop posting this shit btw, i don't give 2 fucks about my own rank, let alone other people's.
---
Well considering the flair says “rant”, I’d assume salty but I forgot people on this subreddit are idiots consumed with calling people bad for hating a specific killer 🤣🤣🤣
---
You can get splinters even if you have the killer i assure you xD, i can count how many times i got glass splinter(pig), even tho i have her on 40 lvl
---
I play spirit when I play killer so sometimes I phase just to look back at my husk and see how fly she looks
---
I honestly would've tried to disarm it after I broke the totem.  What's dumb is he wasn't even close to running into the trap.  It just randomly suctioned over to him.
---
I've seen something equally dumb where two traps were placed on top of each other so every time you'd get stuck in one after reopening it, you'd get trapped by the other.  I think it was intentional tho.  This is really weird.
---
Why everyone on this subreddit is incapable of accepting someone else’s opinion and would rather shit on someone than have a discussion? Right
---
It should only really work on the survivor/s your chasing
---
sadly those people are in all games.
---
in a lot of sports it's custom to say good game after a match. 
---
Basically sportsmanship.
---
Listen here : I can hit great skill checks because I have been playong for a long time. But consider the new players out there. If you don't care then let us just do the maths for the sake of doing them.
---
DBD isn't a sport. Lmaoooo..well actually..the survivors might think it is cuz all they do is run and jump
---
Haha, at least you get hits on console! Here on PC we just miss unless we spam attack button! Thanks to dedicated servers.
---
Ussylis, pain reliever, and not otzdarva
---
Bruh.  Wtf.  I had that happen in kyf where my friend was stuck in the pallet as Billy.  He was able to injure people from one side so he was able to grab and injured person like you said to get him out.
---
So what do you want Trapper do? DC?
---
Tapping is only slightly faster if you get like 5 or 6 skill checks and do them all normally, 0 greats. There was a post with someone testing that out a while ago.
---
If you don‘t get a great skill check though: STOP working on the gen until the ruin effect is over that stops the progress as you can still get skill checks during that time.
---
He's probably in the upside down
---
Good perks aren't toxic
---
Those lego noed skulls ❤️
---
Fuck I'd just let him hook me
---
You're example wasn't farming
---
*laughs in Ghostface while violently t-bagging*
---
I didn't mean to dissuade you. She's powerful on good hands. Keep up the good work and ram on.
---
Ez report.  Enjoy ban.
---
The snot? Eww
---
Make sure you report them. On PS4 harassment always gets some sort of punishment
---
Spirit = The witch       Legion = Hunter   
---
Those are geeat ideas too
---
I came back to the game after being gone to study abroad, was r20 on both roles and always got put into games with all sorts of ranks, still waited 15-20 minutes for those lobbies. 
---
There seems to be no one around on r20-15
---
Flashlight saves are a part of the game dude get over it. Yeah it's annoying but so is mori and NOED, but they're a part of the game too. It's not toxic get over yourself
---
Even without the healing, you couldn‘t get out
---
where do you get the information that the majority is complaining? do you have solid numbers that compares amount sold vs people who are complaining? or are you just assuming numbers based on your own experiences and projecting them? keep in mind that the vocal minority will always look waaaay bigger then it actually is vs the majority who isnt complaining. If you have links to solid proof id happily take a look at them!
---
I feel like tiny killers need something besides hooks.
---
Are you still bitching over a shitpost I made?
---
If you get 3 ruin skill checks during a gen and you don’t hit a great on any of them you’ve spent more time then you would tapping to +20  would have taken you
---
EENOUGH!! WITH THESE MOTHERFUCKING GANGS ON THIS MOTHERFUCKING SUBREDDITS!
---
This is my favorite way to play Hag, I call it the Overkill Jumpscare approach! I legit put my traps in random places around the map and play normally until the gates are opened (if they are opened) and once the gates get power I go FULL HAM.
---
I pick one gate, doesn’t matter which one, and I go ALL. IN. Every trap I have goes in and around that mofo, I’m saying you can’t take a step without getting my attention and scaring yourself silly. Then I go and camp the other gate until the end of the game (usually ending with survivors escaping but having fun with my jump scares) yay
---
I need more of this
---
Of course, that's the idea.
---
Otzdarva and noob3. Otz is super good at explaining what he’s doing as killer and noob is good at running the killer as a survivor and I watch him to be a better survivor and his plays are just funny.
---
Also its not distance anymore. Its time now.
---
Snoots sometimes have snots, it's a completely natural part of having a snoot. Don't snot-shame us!! ;-;
---
Well yea that's only 3 /s
---
Matchmaking is broken indeed. I'm a ps4 player aswell, rank 12 survivor in a game with only rank 19-20 survivors against a rank  20 killer. Ez win but not so much fun tho
---
Wouldn‘t booo the snot though. What‘s next, boop the poop?
---
What if you 
---
Wanted to have killers and survivors face each other in trials to the death where survivors can only escape through the exit gates 
---
But Benedict Baker said 
---
"nah fam I'm creating a hatch and yeeting out of here"
---
Such a hero
---
They are playing more than one killer
---
A bug in the system? In Dead by Daylight? Oooh nooo!
---
Yeah they really have no idea what to do against him. I climbed from like 17 to rank 10 using ghost face and half the time people would get me out of shroud and then hide. They don’t even realise I literally get wall hacks on them for taking me out of shroud
---
IMAGINE USING URBAN EVASION WHEN YOU CAN USE EVASION
---
This post was made by the Yui Kimura gang
---
What does bs mean?
---
Nah the killers just wanna kill or else the entity gives them the belt.
---
Well you see the first hit really should have hit, so don‘t be mad, you would have been down even earlier
---
No, you're bitching about a game mechanic, don't cry get better at the game.
---
Remember when being in the Dream World slowed down gates too ? The OG Freddy
---
why not make a "ranked" and a "casual" que instead, i dont wanna take the game that serious
---
This is an honest question. What is it that makes it take that long. And what do you think is complicated. I can't draw myself, so I'm afraid I can't appriciate how hard this may be, it look damn good though. Good luck
---
I’m sorry I’m not allowed to get annoyed by flashlights. Seriously dude it’s called an opinion
---
You know shadowborn gives more view right?
---
Encouraging people to not even get better is why we have the players in red ranks that we do...
---
A lot of killers already dodge, this would make it even worse.
---
Using monitor and abuse on scratched mirror Myers 🧠💥💥
---
Lolll I love Ohm
---
I had a Jane stun me and then nod to signal she needed the challenge. I nodded back and held w into 3 more stuns for her and we continued the match like normal, was great.
---
Also had a leatherface swing at a window next to the exit gate, so i slow vaulted it to give him his last grab.
---
When killers are clearly trying for the 5 basement hooks in 1 match i sometimes won't wiggle (depends on the killer tho)
---
Basically, we as a community can help each other out and get these challenges done quick and easy! I've been helped with many of my challenges when i was grinding them, it was awesome.
---
Buff tru3
---
Thank you! I love how you told me their qualities. That’s nice! I love watching people juke the killer. Ohmwrecker is the funniest so far for how he does it. That I’ve seen!
---
Jesus that's painful
---
Ebony Mori would be fine if you could only mori survivors on their dead hook. I don't have any idea how to change keys
---
Buffed
---
I’ve come in on one or two of his streams on Twitch and ended up leaving. Usually the first 20-30 min are just him talking and I ended up leaving to watch someone play. I didn’t realize he actually played until later on. Thought he was just a talk channel.
---
“With my ultimate power, I will destroy all the stream snipers!”
---
Show em who’s the boss then. I support your PS4 average skilled killer stand against the red ranks.
---
Survivors do need to finish all gens to all escape you know
---
Because its more or less a pecentage and time related. Not to mentolion hit boxes aren't skin tight. They're boxes
---
In the game I played it was a two man swf and they let one guy die so they could get the hatch. Didn't even come to get him from the hook. The two escaped with a key and then left their random team mate behind who I could have easily killed. It's unfair to the killer and to the survivors left behind or who they don't bother to save because they have a easy way out.
---
P2P has only a littlr lag at max and dedicated servers have so much problems that make the game unplayable
---
Ok
---
Yeah I agree, it would help killers save time AND it would help counter borrowed time and DS invulnerability. Keeping it as an ultra rare and changing it to that would be good or perhaps 2 hooks but as an ultra rare still
---
When did you start playing?  The Spirit was just reworked a week or so ago, when the Oni was released.
---
Big brain steve main
---
2 years on ps4
---
5 months on pc. 
---
Started maining spirit maybe after oni or little before? Im pretty positive before. What changed? Please tell me
---
Still baffles me that one is 25k bloodpoints and the other is 60k. Every challenge should be 60k imo, just gimme bloodpoints :(
---
this should probably be NSFW
---
That’s what I’m implying with my response to your comment.
---
You slowly get boldness for being in the killers terror radius, assuming they were AFK they werent sprinting so they never entered a chase according to the game. so they got 6 points from the "bold" score event in the boldness category. a pretty small amount of bp to get from this score event, so likely a stealth killer
---
Are you talking about the no collision thingy? Beacuse thats not even a big nerf. Any decent spirit will see almost no difference
---
My Wraith build: Spirit Fury, Enduring, Bamboozle or Brutal Strength and BBQ. 
---
I have fun with chases and rarely they last too long. Survivors don't have to go through a depressing match of stacked slow down perks. Everyone has fun.
---
The thing here is chasing mechanic in DbD is wonky (and for good reasons, I imagine it's a really hard to check if you're still chasing survivor or not for every possible scenario). That's what caused issues with vanilla Legion for example.
---
I'd suggest for cooldown timer to work against specific survivor. If somebody else triggers I'm All Ears while cooldown is active - it bypasses the timer, perk works and timer resets. So somebody yolo mad vaulting would actually screw their teammate instead of screwing the killer.
---
Not to brag or anything, but two people were hooked with noed and I found the totem and got one of them out.
---
That sounds great but knowing the spaghetti code DBD runs on, I guarantee that would break things more than it would improve the perk
---
Do a flip.
---
I have a sneaking suspicion I would get destroyed if I attempted that build. But curiosity means I will, cheers
---
Is this loss? /s
---
And as other guys already told, that's the true issue with this perk. It's hard to make it truly good in these existing conditions, sadly.
---
Stop
---
I'd rather have that than 2 flashlight saves in one game...
---
I always thought this meme was dumb but to each their own
---
While that was satisfying to watch and I agree you handled that perfectly, I’m guessing the hag was a rank 20 baby as well and didn’t know any better. Most ranks 20 killers tend to camp a lot.
---
But either way nice escape Steve.
---
It works on all skillchecks
---
It's aesthetically pleasing, but overall kind of a useless thing to do unless you have the bodyblock addon.
---
Haha nice.
---
I like watching GarukuBluemoon and Puppers. They both play both sides.
---
Insidious?
---
Put them down
---
What if you have a rank rainbow in the lobby?
---
We all enjoy different things, I like winning as killer and to me that is a 3k. A 2k would be fine but with this wraith build I doubt I would even get a 1k, I'm just not that good with wraith yet
---
I'm screaming on purpose
---
I dont think any mori should work on anyone that isnt on final hook. Makes no sense why I should be able hook you one out three times and kill you straight up. What is a survivor supposed to do against that?
---
a bug? since when?
---
I would say go with Ghostface, both are good killers but he is a lot more fun to play as than the Pig imo
---
It is equally scientifically better that your food tastes better when your heels are together.
---
H...how did he talk like a pirate? Kinda curious.
---
I guess destroying expirience of people who may just picked up the game is not that important. Gotta get that break in its not like they knew about the problem for at least a week before the break.
---
OP says he couldn’t hook them either
---
The time to learn how to hit great skill checks is when the consequence of missing them is less gen progress, not gen regression.
---
Buff Tru3
---
I hope they change how challenges work in the next tome. Not only some of them are stupid and/or not unique, you need to activate first. While doing one such as heal others or repair gens or killing obsession etc. you may actually complete another one such trap people or escape with certain perk or whatever, but it doesn’t count. We should be able to complete multiple without activating any challenge of course. Challenges should be the way of levelling up your rift faster thing only. I am not even talking completing challenges are the only way to unlock lore, which shouldn’t be the case. Imagine you have to escape with Claudette twice, just to unlock piece of lore smh.
---
Oh come on, how often are killers toxic in post game as opposed to survivors? Let him have this.
---
It actually gains a token for each hook. Also (at its max) it regresses the gen by 6% (plus the base if i’m not mistaken). It’s honestly pretty strong and 5 stacks is easy to get and some newer players can struggle with it. I think it needs a slight buff but it’s an an okay spot right now.
---
Well first off, don't double back when killer vaults window for no reason, that would've been real bad if you didn't have dead hard to cover that mistake.
---
Yeah buddy, no one even attacked you. You were the one who misunderstood a developer, complained about it and acted like it was the end of the world.
---
So fun fact: I didn't have my glasses on when I first read this and I thought it said "We're in the England now, bitch!"
---
Yeah I got that, but you’re spelling it wrong... it’s kite
---
No it would literally be useless. You save almost no time on it. It would just be getting less bp for a fancy animation.
---
I agree that mori’s need to be reworked somehow but this would just make it not worth it.
---
I know how it works I was saying make it not a hex and change how you get tokens from hooks to gens so its not too crazy.
---
This is pure perfection. Anyway i can download that skin? :D
---
Oh it 100% is, thats why i hate it so much. If it gets cleansed immediately  the games pretty much over for killers at that point unless survivors  do f all
---
Mhmm and expect more cupcake :)
---
Does the window tech still works when u can go through a killer? Didn‘T use it for a while coz someone told me it’s not working anymore
---
2/10, not enough Mettle of Man Borrowed Time machos riding in on a white horse to dunk on tunneling
---
Oh, my bad. But, like I said, I think it’s in a good place right now.
---
Me, slowly approaches while crouching: *boop!*
---
This is so wholesome and I love it!
---
I wouldn't say it's widely hated by killers, but the biggest complaint is with the playstyle UE entails.  If you get a game with four stealthy survivors that manage to disappear the second they hear your heartbeat you're just kinda left wandering around what feels like an empty map as generators pop every once in awhile.  It's boring, frustrating, and embarrassing at the same time.

Thanks man, I try my damndest but sometimes its too hard :(
---
Where will you be when period strikes?
---
Am I the only only one that if wraith actually spoke he would have just like a normal voice just kinda calm not really creepy?
---
What is this? I find a match in seconds with no problems, why do some people have issues with this?
---
its literally just changing the icons. there is always a potential to be banned when using any mods unless the devs say otherwise, but realistically as long as it doesn't effect actual gameplay, its not likely to happen
---
The survivor could have body blocked enough for her to crawl out.
---
I cannot believe people are going to these lengths. Just don't get heated over a game of DBD, it's fairly simple.
---
Imagine never getting hit by them except for the rare endgame event I described...
---
As much as I want to play with music without sound this game is just impossible.
---
No one cares about the however many extra points at exit gates. I also said that you can get the killers attention with only one vault, in that case its not toxic. Prolonging happens on both sides(its mostly a killer move) and the exp you get for game length is minuscule. And last but not least in a perfect world no games would allow teabagging, just because its in more then one thing doesnt mean its ok.  And if you are seriously trying to say "just get over it" then you are part of the problem.
---
Thats why you bring rancor instead of NOED, can't be cleansed and allows you to negate the obsession downside of remember me. 15~ second mori aint shit compared to a 40 second door open
---
If only Agitation stacked from multiple carried survs
---
If they aren't making his shock consistent then his will still be shit
---
I'm actually not sure my friend. I play on Xbox because it's what I started playing the game on and I dont care to re farm up blood points for killers on PC. The one time I was close to making the switch I joined this subreddit and I see PC killers and survivors complain about long matchmaking times. I get into a match in 30 seconds 90% of the time and at most 5 minutes, killer or survivor.
---
The lengths of writing something down after each game? Yeah man I broke my back doing this.
---
This is why I'm only doing the survivor side of lvl 4 of the 1st tome.
---
Never really understood why you would killers cutesy names like Piggy, Demodoggo, Bing Bong boy etc. I mean they are mindless killing machines that obey a lovecraftian god that feeds on torture, and revel at brutality and sadism. There isn't much room for cuteness in there.
---
I cant imagine that. Its not true. You never have cocky survivors unhook while you're walking away? You never have someone with DS still active come make a super cocky play right in your face and them hop in a locker cuz he knows hes untouchable? 
---
I dont believe that for a second. Also, end game is not a rare thing. It happens in tons of matches and BT and DS are both quite nasty at endgame especially DS.
---
But yeah keep spreading the fiction that 2 of the strongest survivor perks in the game apparently don't work against "good" killers
---
Tier 999: Use monitor and abuse on Pig with whispers for maximum stealth.
---
When you go extra cruel against a weaker team because you need all iridescent emblems you can get to finish a challenge earlier.
---
This is why I made it so only friends can message me on PS4, you hate to see it but its necessary if you want to play killer.
---
Sure, but did you ever boop a snoot?
---
My doesn't even know how old I am
---
the bug on the system called why dont know what to do
---
What you do is you stay Tier 1 and just walk around yoinking them off the gens before they even see you. Tables the turn, and be the sneaky boy for once.
---
I was playing clown and was demolishing the survivors, feng killed herself on first hook and i killed a 2nd guy i felt really bad because i saw they were newer and I let steve and another feng farm and escape to give them a pip and bloodpoints, felt nice knowing i made their day, i remember when i was new and loved when killers let them go!
---
Another spongebob meme.
---
You aren’t doing a gen when you’re teabagging and clicking away. By all means follow me around idc.
---
It broke my heart no one actually helped the poor guy.
---
The hero we need but don’t deserve.
---
New ultra rare offering: trapped door
---
Hatch can no longer be used as a means of escape as long as it is sealed. Will immediately start end game collapse when criteria meets (ex: solo survivor) Requires the use of crowbar to break bindings and can be found in chest. Will always spawn ONE crowbar and will always spawn in ONE chest per trial. Dull/Skeleton Keys will search chest 25% faster and guarantees crowbar. Crowbar can be channeled to reveal trapped hatch within 25 meters. Takes 4 seconds to pry seal off. Crowbar will always break when prying seal or exiting gates. Prying seal DOES NOT mean it will open. It will only destroy the barrier.
---
*boop* aight imma head out
---
Ludwig Ahgren next survivor?
---
Wouldn’t you like to know....
---
Or my controller just dying mid chase. Not fun lol
---
Is there any idea when this might be implemented on console ??
---
It’s a big problem with DBD. There’s so many perks that are extremely high power level but also dozens of perks that are just extremely bad or useless. There needs to be an update that reworks, buffs and nerfs basically all perks in order to bring them all in line
---
Is it bad that I didn't get the insinuation and was just thinking of the knights who say Ni for a few minutes?
---
Do you hear me complaining? :/
---
I just love getting hate mail, even if it's to trashtalk me after I lost it makes me feel like I've won
---
idk if is "strong" but i like windstorm addons and pwyf cause fast af, and then pretty generic bbq, ruin, sloppy
---
Am I the only one that actually hates playing as her. I can't stand the way she looks. It actually bugs me.
---
I feel like that's just highlighting how the game (in certain places) is designed badly and individual players pay for it.
---
Of course the Survivor is going to crawl away from the hooks, so they can increase their wiggle times long enough for them to break free. They're doing what they should do.
---
And of course the Killer knows this and so they just won't pick them up/eat the DS because they don't want to "lose". A bit petty, but they're the ones in control.
---
optimal
---
Yes, thats the joke
---
So why do people give free hits at exit gates? For satisfaction? Or for some BP. 
---
&gt; I also said that you can get the killers attention with only one vault        
---
What if thats not enough to get attention, you have to try everything to get attention to help your team so you're going out of your way to be a hindrance to make the killer want to go for you instead of a perhaps easier target.  
---
Also by your logic if I be horrible in chat just once a match, then its not toxic. As you're saying a presumed "toxic" trait once is fine, but more than once is not okay.
---
The exp you get isnt that small, you get 18 exp for on iridiscent emblem, you also get 1exp per second of trial, so you get a lot more exp just being in the trial then doing its activities. So stalling isnt bad. Plus why give killers free kills when they slug and cant find you.  Also killers arent forced to hook you, they can stall for whatever reason they want, let you bleed out thats fine. Wastes both of our time. Still basic game play.
---
Teabagging in a game is perhaps preference on however you feel about it, but you cant deny the fact that its a cocky gesture. It can be frustrating seeing a little twat shake his booty, but then getting that kill is much more satisfying. I dont think thats toxic in my opinion, but we all have very different definitions of what toxicity actually is and whats acceptable. For example I think you are being quite toxic towards me, saying that I'm a part of the problem when I've just stated my opinion on what I think is acceptable. I'm just trying to see it through your eyes, do you feel that teabagging for example is more than a cocky gesture and is just all out negative and trying to put you down and belittle you?
---
Hex ruin: 
---
A Hex that afffects Survivor's skills at repairing generators. For each dull and Hex totem remaining on the map gain a token. All survivors affected by Ruin which reduces their repairing speed by 10% for each token. 
---
The Hex effect persists as long as the related Hex totem is standing. 
---
The related Hex totem appears as Dull totem.
---
NoeD:
---
A Hex Rooting its power on hope. You are animated by the power of your hex totem when survivors are on the verge of escaping. Once the exit gates are powered, if the related Hex totem is still standing, it gets automatically destroyed and its power grants you the following bonuses until the end of a trial:
---
Survivors suffer from exposed status effect
---
Your movement speed is increased by 8%.
---
(So if survivors fail to cleanse the related totem before finishing the generators, the noed activates and there is no way for survivors to get rid of its effect). 
---
Thrill of the Hunt: 
---
A hex rooting its power on hope. The false hope of survivors feels you with excitement and strengthens your totems. For each Dull and Hex totem remaining on the map gain a token.
---
Gain 10% more bloodpoints for actions in Hunter and Sacrifice category for each token.
---
Difficulty of any skillchecks is increased by 15% for each token.
---
Gain notification when somebody has completed 50% of cleansing progress.
---
Huntress\`s Lullaby:
---
The hex no longer reveals himself until it has gained at least 1 token. 
---
Third seal:
---
Survivors gain its effect from any damage from the killer (Bear Traps, Hatchets, Shred, Chainsaw etc)
---
Survivors are also affected by oblivious.
---
Cleansing changes:
---
Cleansing duration increased to 20 seconds.
---
Survivors face skillchecks during cleansing.
---
Survivors can carefully cleanse the totem by holding M1 or break it by holding M2 for 3 seconds. 
---
If survivor break a totem, he is affected by its curse until the end of a trial (Exposed for Noed, Exposed&amp;Killable for Devour Hope, Difficult skillchecks for TotH, Slow repair for Ruin, No sound notification + extra penalty for Lullaby, Exposed for 60 seconds for Haunted and Blindless&amp;Oblivious for Third seal).
---
dude, if it were default survivors would maybe start to learn how to play around it, which would make it 100x easier to play against anyway. 
---
it’d be hard on baby survivors though, so bhvr probably won’t
---
Against a camping leatherface, there are no unhooks to be done. We'd rather not give him another kill. By the time he was done camping we were already opening the gates.
---
freddy is a great choice, then i think pig and spirit are mandatory if u want killers, for survivors i think adam and jane got the must fun perks
---
Ooo me to
---
I would boop that
---
The Wraith looks so cool here. Not sure what it is though
---
Tyde is calling the police right now
---
Netflix series would be great even if it's the Generic killers and survivors.
---
As a Doctor main, I'm actually really excited for his rework. What was probably his biggest weakness was changing between punishment and treatment modes mid chases, and with this change it will no longer be an issue.
---
I have to agree that increasing the madness of survivors by just walking around was a bit too easy and boring, so the new blast charge fixes that. *(and it will increase one whole madness tier every time it hits someone!!)*
---
So overall I think his changes are for the better
---
Everyone has been nice so that cool
---
Its because of twats like these that some killers sweat for the 4k.
---
Not all but ones that WOULD allow the hatch feel a bit of pressure not to. Which means a survivor is more likely to spend a few minutes on the ground as the killer hunts for the last which is dull for everyone.
---
Toxicity has a ripple effect
---
I feel like this takes away the risk-reward power of hexs
---
Yeah potentially although I use the bone clapper and windstorm. I do use the purple windstorm sometimes but I prefer using the yellow or green because I have them available pretty much every game. I'll probably try the add on at some point and replace sloppy with pgtw cheers
---
I think after 2nd hook would be a good alternative.
---
yea
---
That's the creepy snoot
---
you can still
---
That would work if  the killer was notified it was being opened because otherwise you may never think to look or even find it and perhaps if they couldn't opened it whilst slugged
---
i got it at first try as i was really lucky, but i believe trapper is the best choice, i used agitation, bbq, ruin, whispers and trapper bag, just a normal build, hook someone in the basement and trap, if they play it poorly is easy to get, but as i said i was just lucky
---
bc it’s like a surprise party
---
glad to now know this exists, thank ya
---
Let me see if I got your idea correctly...
---
Ruin makes ALL survivors repair 10% slower for each totem, which basically makes it 50%, and they must break totems randomly in order to find it *(because you just decided to make it look like a dull)*
---
You DO realize that other perks like Thanatophobia or Dying Light that forces you to DO stuff before getting the slow speed repair don't even go as HALF the range you are proposing, right? 
---
Yeah, no foking chance my dude.
---
Yeah I pretty much agree tbh completely honest but for the people who don't a compromise like I suggested would be fine imo
---
I did switch from PS4 to PC this week, and I'm having more fun with DBD.
---
It's it weird that I play survivor with a controller and killer with K+M?
---
I like doing generators with a controller, and I like playing with the controller more, but on 1st person, K+M works best for me.
---
i like bbq, ruin, hg, myc/rancor/noed depending on the mood
---
If you think that's rough try being a brown rank killer and getting unbreakable, adrenaline, BT, DS, and instaheal shoved up your ass. There is even less warning or indication that these things are coming.
---
Meanwhile the perfectly safe jungle gym with a pallet up is just chillin over there.
---
Make them understand!! Lol
---
And you just perfectly encapsulated why killers get angry and stop playing.
---
3 survivors coordinating and body blocking hooks, or hiding under hooker survivors where it’s nearly impossible to hit Them is “using intended game mechanics” but if a killer tunnels the weakest player then he’s tunneling and being shitty. Do you not see how unfair or one sided that thinking is?
---
If a team of survivors uses every tactic available to them, and the killer never tunnels or camps, it’s almost guaranteed that the survivors will win. 
---
Also, I highly doubt it’s intended for survivors to be nearly invincible by crouching under a hooked survivor. When done right, it’s a guaranteed unhook. Survivors use every unintended trick in the book to win but do nothing but complain if a killer does the same.
---
Thana&amp;Dying are not under survivors' control. 
---
Numbers can be changed, but yes, break all totems or suffer speed debuff.
---
The balance on these is terrible. 50% for Ruin? 8% NoEd speed? No.
---
They haven't released the full set of changes yet. Madness as a whole may be getting changed, wr don't know.
---
Did you see his stream when chat said "do wraith, bad perks only" but he managed to actually use every perk of unrelenting, toth, hangman's, and predator?
---
Low key its good its means u dont have a toxic mentality :)
---
[link to Episode ](https://youtu.be/_oNyVWGHzUw)
---
HG? Sorry cant recall what that is. And yes i also think myc is very good.
---
Was trying to give last guy hatch but 
---
nurse wasn't playing that
---
After Dedicated Servers, I'm convinced grabs are nigh-impossible unless on accident.
---
Does ruin help you in red/purple ranks
---
just have fun, dont let toxic people get to u, and avoid fallin in "im survivor main" or "im killer main" thing, u can sure enjoy both sides, in fact is like gettin two games for the price of one so, just that hope u came to stay
---
Thing is he’s/she’s not exactly wrong
---
I'm a red rank P3 Nurse main dude. It took me months to master her on console but I don't regret it at all when a survivor starts tbagging since no one plays Nurse and 5 secs later they're down.
---
is haunted grounds
---
Legion is an original character so you can buy it with in game currency, but you'd have to either pay for that much or have played a lot to grind out the shards
---
Or the survivors can waste the entire game looking for it. Mix that with your TOTH idea and you have the recipe for a really boring and laborious game. Doing a gen at 50% speed? That's 3 minutes for a solo gen.
---
Iridescent Warhead -
---
Once per match you have the option to completely fucking annihilate all survivors in the match. Will also kill you on impact.
---
I didn't even knpw this was a thing...I am new to be fair
---
Play the tutorials for sure. You can do custom matches with friends whenever you like, that can help you learn how different perks work &amp; you can go 1 on 1. You'll earn no bloodpoints though. Be killer a couple times because seeing it from that perspective will help you see how killers perceive you, ie: scratch marks, loop mistakes, hiding places... valuable knowledge. Ots a steep learning curve so don't expect to be pro for a while. Its steep, but fun! Bond (Dwight) is a great starter perk.
---
u should specify in the post that u need a build for red ranks, in purple works great, is more for baiting them into cleansing hg, or get u 1 or 2 minutes in early without a gen being done
---
I will try better next time I thought it was kinda funny my apologies
---
seconded. bugged matchmaking aside, I play on xbox and have always gotten the impression that “imbalanced” matches were the result of attempts to reduce queue times. I don’t imagine PS4 would be *that* different from every other platform; if it is, maybe it’s because it has one of the smallest player bases, so it gets longer queue times and more imbalanced games as a result. (I’m only assuming that PS4 has fewer players because DBD is included in xbox gamepass and ofc PC would have the largest player base by default.)
---
Hope you find someone too
---
Its, not ots. Woops!
---
I can't play with music I already scream enough as it is
---
how is this clip any helpful to this subreddit? his connection to the server probably is trash...he shouldn’t stream and play...lemme guess...he complained AGAIN!
---
Do it and I’ll give you the latest fashion in headwear
---
grind tome challenges, play a lot u just need 16 more tiers so u are really close
---
Well, they changed hook mechanics now &amp; if the rescuer has BT, you dhould be able to get a clean getaway.
---
10/10 would boop that snoop
---
&gt; Killers with high map pressure like Billy.
---
Yeah and just be done with the rest of the killers. Might as well delete them. /s
---
Yes! I always have on someone streaming while I'm playing.
---
This is a very great meme. But we are on reddit so it will not get much love :(
---
Not trying to argue here I thought this clip was funny. Also most of his streams that he plays are all normal games.
---
BiG bRaIn TiMe
---
There’s a “polite” way to play to avoid making the game too miserable for any one survivor. 
---
Hook camping and tunneling are impolite for a killer in most circumstances; taking advantage of a killer clearly trying not to camp/tunnel by farming unhooks is equally impolite for survivors. 
---
Patrolling generators is not impolite in any circumstances (except one specific situation with the doctor, which is actually reportable but also not something you’re going to do accidentally). Leaving the last three gens close together is a misplay on the survivors’ part. There’s a survivor perk designed to help prevent it called Deja Vu. 
---
In short, you did nothing wrong. The only iffy thing might be tunneling the unhooked survivor; sometimes that survivor is a solo queue player getting farmed for points by their teammates, and is probably more angry about being unhooked right in front of the killer than the killer is. That said, it’s not the killer’s fault, it’s the unhooking survivor’s, and most survivors who actually know the game will realize that. 
---
It’s not your job to try and guess which survivors are or aren’t on a team, so don’t feel obligated to change your playstyle. As a solo queue survivor myself, I don’t get too bothered if I get tunneled/camped/whatever. It happens, it’s a perfectly valid playstyle according to in-game mechanics, and if I didn’t want to deal with it I should’ve played better in the first place. It’s not fun, but that’s kind of just how games work. Expecting a multiplayer game to be fun all the time is just stupid.
---
Had a GG EZ today after the guy who sent it got hooked twice and still escape, like, ok. I played along and acted sad to keep their power trip going.
---
He used words like "yur," I couldn't let it slide
---
I'm 50/50 if the teammate has been super helpful not others (not just me) I'll unhook and we both live/I die for them.  If they haven't I let them hang.  Does that make me a bad person?
---
In what way? You literally get nothing for it then xD Just a fancy animation and less bp.
---
And not you don’t waste less time because you still have to watch through the whole animation.
---
So all in all why would you ever mori someone after the 2nd hook when you can just hook them a 3rd time and be done with them as well?
---
Nah, that’s probably some blendette simultaneously urban evasioning in a corner and shitting her pants so much it leave a trail because she heard her heart beat once.
---
Pls Devs Nerf Pig. She can Kill Survivors which makes me feel oppressed when playing Survivor. I am really sad when I play agnst her.
---
The hook mechanics are different. Really.
---
Now my game just hangs up instead of showing me NAT error, so I have to use CAD to close the game and restart.
---
that christmas overlay is intense lmao
---
You seem to mistake the Dead By Daylight Devs for the Overwatch Devs. The OW Devs at least give reasoning for their balancing decisions while the balancing team at BHVR is just doing random shit
---
It's been done more with pictures being used as templates.
---
I got it off on the very first box once. Felt great. It also never happened again.
---
Spirit and Oni are both very good and very fun but you have to be willing to sink lots of time into then to learn how to play them properly.  Clown is fun and very very good at low ranks by bordering on completely useless at high ranks. (Also r/CoolClownCongregation)
---
Smart.
---
You act like your parents don’t pay for your car, insurance and give you gas money lol.
---
When I first downloaded it for switch was like 10pm.  Already in bed wife asleep so made sure volume was all the way off.  
---
Makes doing gens dark souls level without the audio right before.
---
Tome 3 was way harder for me, fuck those endgame challenges
---
Hey you need to let them 360 you continuously didn’t you read the killer handbook that was written by survivors???
---
A Leigon killer helped a Claudette and myself farm BP after two survivors DC'D. It took me a minute to figure it out but we went around and got all the generators, totems, broke all the pallets and got both the doors. I play PS4 and messaged both players thank you and they said Merry Christmas. Motherfucking Christmas Spirit!
---
Congrats. I just wish they would let you get them when you do them, like trophies/achievements. I'm garbage with flashlights and by dumb luck I got the flashlight save while I was going for the 4 blinds challenge on my last flashlight.
---
I used to do this when I started on PC after PS4, before the green ranks... that was so chill...
---
When you have 5 stacks of Devour Hope and Spirit Fury Enduring is ready.
---
seconded; PainReliever’s videos are fantastic. 
---
also, maybe run windows of opportunity if you find yourself getting lost in jungle gym tiles with high walls; I used it when first learning to get more familiar with the map, and to get more chances for longer chases in general. (Without it, I had a lot of trouble learning the layouts of different jungle gyms and how to tell them apart or guess where the pallet/window would spawn.)
---
You could probably stand to work on your pathing a bit, too, but it’s kind of hard to tell from this clip alone.
---
I wouldn't run BBQ on Hag since she doesn't have the mobility to take advantage and you want to be more territorial. When I used to play her a lot I ran Ruin, STBFL, Monitor and Nurses.
---
Her terror radius is already 24 meters. Monitor brings that down to 16 meters (if I'm recalling my numbers correctly.) And running Monitor with it really allows you to sneak up on Survivors healing.
---
I honestly don’t even know what to say for this one.
---
One of my weird opinions about this game is that great skill checks are actually easier to hit during levels 1 and 2 of Lullaby.
---
"The survivors won't be happy"
---
The only time they are happy is when the 4 of them survive, t-bag and say gg ez baby killer.
---
Otherwise they complain all the time. My friends are all surv mains so i know what im talking about
---
I also play it while listening to music and I didn’t knew that that was such a respectable act
---
Can bhvr please fix the grabbing animation this has been going on ever since the Plague chapter
---
shh shh... dont say anything...
---
Personally I'd like to see a new mandatory objective after all the generators are done so that the whole game isn't just "hold down M1" for survivors
---
this reads like a Donald Trump tweet
---
\&gt;post a clip from Otzdarva
---
This sub: "wow bravo he's such a sweet heart I love him!"
---
\&gt;post a clip from Tru3talent
---
This sub: "REEEE WHY POST A CLIP FROM HIM HE IS SHIT! TRU3 = BAD!"
---
Probably the same people that will jump in a locker to prevent you from getting the tombstone Myers achievement even though they can't possibly escape anyway. Seriously had people do that and let the entity sacrifice them rather than risk me getting the achievement.
---
The problem with this is that Rancor and blood warden have opposing goals. With Rancor you want to down and mori the obsession and with blood warden you want down and hook someone. It is highly unlikely you would get to make use of both perks. A team on comms will just block you from getting the obession and without noed they can. A team without comms is just gonna leave when you mori the obsession. 
---
I also never said that you open the gates yourself. I said that the survivors are gonna 99 the gates if you have someone downed and ready to hook. If you don't  or you down the obession and then mori them then they are just gonna leave lmao
---
bruh im subbed to Brawl Stars so this meme got me scratching my head for a second
---
Lmao
---
I think I left my toxic side behind now but thank you I also plan on playing with friends mostly
---
You're not getting a flashlight for Christmas.
---
There's a tutorial? I'm gonna have to look for it
---
I know it’s an issue, but I didn’t know it’s still an issue after two grabs. Meaning, I’ve seen it happen and it fixes itself the 2nd time usually. This is like WTF kinda moment lol
---
He seems like a pretty good killer, I don't think he needs any buffs.
---
Poor fredfredburger
---
He was on the inside and the mori made him go through the wall
---
☝️filthy Reddit killer main right here
---
Those changes are not balanced at all.  Where in the he'll did you even get those ideas
---
Freddy, because easy TP. Pig, because you can read information about people running to remove their information, however you wanna use that information.
---
I mean, if they are following you around for the flashlight save, they aren't on a gen.
---
[actual wat](https://i.imgur.com/sZvQ5mg.png)
---
Yeah. Honestly at this point I would be excited much more for global perks overhaul and additions to already existing mechanics and stuff than for new killers/survivors. I still didn't play much Plague/Demogorgon simply because I have other killers to play. This is the first time I will consider if buying a new chapter is a good idea, because I'm simply fed of new content when old is the one that needs attention much more.
---
Why? I just want to give you some safety headgear.
---
I agree. Usually if someone unhooks someone in front of your face then they have borrowed time and if not then the person being unhooked might have DS. It's just when the person being unhooked then does a gen in front of your face because they the endurance effect and DS &gt;:I
---
I haven't finished it. It's longer than Artamène ou le Grand Cyrus (longest book ever written)
---
If there are 4 survivors working on a gen and one of them has prove thyself then the repair speed bonus from the perk is 30%.
---
It is said that "Survivors can only be affected by one Prove Thyself effect at a time" but the person with PT doesnt get the bonus so if there are 4 survs and 2 of them have PT then is the bonus 40%?
---
Wow! Incredible Job!
---
Sadly I think this will only get worse as players try and finish the rift and their challenges. I felt horrible the other day while going for the flashlight blinds. Had a wraith that kept breaking pallets right after I dropped them even on loops he didn't need to but I was happy to get three I needed. I could tell by the end of the game he was just defeated. I was going to message him after and thank him for the challenge help but he had messages block to only friends or someone. 
---
I'm trying to not take toxic behavior too personally as of late as i know most players are in the same situation as me and using this vacation/holiday time to get challenges done. Even if I hate the insidious bubba builds I saw yesterday.
---
What would you define as “your” skill level?  
---
People make mistakes all the time and this might come as a surprise, so do you.  
---
You only remember the bad players and never the good ones.
---
You could get banned for doing that so im not touching that shit lol
---
damn, sick mindgames
---
Otz be like:
---
“Out of my Way STBFL! I have a new Love!”
---
Some people you give some time they progress after a while. Especially when a new killer is introduced.
---
Yes, the survivors who do that often struggle with the concept of cause and effect. I had a 4 man sabo the only hook in the area just before I slugged them all as Myers, and all 4 crawled to a corner. They lost their minds when I let all 4 bleed out in the corner.
---
I talk to my friends in discord while playing. I can't play spirit very well due to that but I get lonely lmao.
---
Thought for a moment this was aimed at me cause I did this same shit the other day.
---
We had an easy Bubba game. Bubba played friendly, then chainsawed two people at once, and after that somebody tried to save those two.
---
Lesson learned: don't trust friendly Bubbas.
---
This game isn’t perfect, but it definitely has comedic moments lol
---
I also think teabagging and flashlight click spam etc is shitty, I play both sides and things survivors do also annoys me. I phrased it poorly, but I meant that both are not nice but both are intended game mechanics. BHVR has said they’re not doing anything about camping/tunnelling and whether I like it or not it’s also part of the game if people choose to do it. I see body blocking as survivors letting me slug for free. Just drop the person and chase/down them too. I will say killer is definitely the role I take less seriously, but I do empathise with killer mains and realise how frustrating it is sometimes especially vs a team of good survivors.
---
So the rift closes in 15ish days, what does that mean? Does all progress get reset? I'm on the third chapter and can't for the life of me get a save after the doors open. Then after that impossibility, it's the flashlight blinds. So is finishing just something that's out of my reach?
---
But do you think that’s the case for every killer? What about... well, yeah, I guess most of them aren’t what you’d call sophisticated, but I still like the idea lol
---
If they 99 the gates by the time you get the obsession, you already fucked up.
---
You should already be on the obsession by the time theres 1 gen left and be dead by hooking them or mori when the gen pops, allowing for the remember me to kick in. Sure you can just do this without rancor but its way easier if they haven't been hooked yet.
---
Your plan is basically going to the obsession when rancor is activated, he should already be dead when the exit gates popped or ready to be killed. You shouldn't hook the obsession when its popped becuase the gates take 40 sec to open, and thats only half the mori time. The exit gates should never be open/99'd by the time you get to the obsession.
---
It's based on the loud noise action (hence the ears) so yes Quick and Quiet does counter I'm all ears.
---
Amazing
---
how is your comment any helpful to this subreddit? your opinion is probably trash... you shouldn't shit talk over a simple funny clip...lemme guess...you did it ANYWAY
---
Imagine playing Minecraft and this starts running towards you
---
That would mean you can only miss one skill check if you want to be faster. I believe it was 23 seconds slower, you could miss 3 skill checks and you're slightly faster than gen tapping. Gen tapping is faster if you miss 4 skill checks.
---
Do you think that weekly shrine perks limited with 4 perk, maybe you can simply increase that to 5 or 6? Because usually there will be shit perks so we don't but any perk from shrine.
---
Imagine not being able to slow them down so much that they could not reach the end game.
---
This post has been made by the OG Freddy
---
Try to watch some better known youtubers/twitch streamers as well, you can learn quite a bit from them. Pain Reliever and Otz are both really good people to learn from, their yt channels are super informative.
---
Survivor side I always listen to background music but killer side now that's another story especially with how sounds are always broken
---
Maybe I’ll do it
---
Of course it saves time and is more convenient , there have been many situations where I haven't been able to make it to a hook due to the hook being too far away and/or body blocking team mates. Or I have downed the survivor and can't pick them up because of  DS which in the endgame could allow them to crawl out the exit gates (does happen sometimes). Overall it would just be considerably easier than 3 hooking everyone.
---
Perhaps you could make it so that they are one shot also after their second hook.
---
I think the fire from the barrel saved ur life lol
---
I'm not using insidious. This dumb bitch stayed in the basement. I went after the one who unhooked, the other never came out. I went back, she got caught, when I picked her up, she DC'd. Called me a "basement camping bot".  Didn't camp the basement, didn't tunnel. It was a 3 gen situation, why was I going to leave the gens? Oh well, I'll get it eventually, but goodness, a majority of these red ranks are whiny pricks.
---
People who know how to play the game. I know people make mistakes, I make mistakes. There's a difference between making mistakes and doing nothing. Of course I only remember the bad ones. I'm at red ranks and should be expecting decent teammates every game. That unfortunately isn't the case anymore. 
---
If you were in red ranks and the decent players were the majority and obviously the bad players were the minority, wouldn't you remember the bad players the most? I mean, you're in red ranks. The land of decent players.
---
Ruin, Noed, blood warden. Try hard on those fuckos
---
Lol. As much as I have my opinions I think it should be a change that everyone can agree to.
---
The only way I could see it happening would be something like the entire movie is one trial and at the time survivors don't know "Death is not an escape". Someone escapes then they get put into another trial soon after they escape or something.
---
Wich killers should I buy, based on good perks they have? 
---
Also, how maps work? When I buy a killers pack, I get a map, but since I can't choose it, how does it work? Does it choose a random one that the killer has?
---
Boople snoot
---
Embrace autism and pick up 3 gen basement Hag.
---
Honestly I think Sally has no idea what's going on. Save Sally and Philip!
---
I think killing off 1 or 2 early would be good and then noed and blood warden would be strong in the endgame
---
Gets a one k
---
Yeah, people frustrating things just to fuck over other people. When I was doing it the last survivor kept running to the other side of the map so I wouldn't be able to get them there...but I eventually did. Just gotta keep at it.
---
unfortunately I did watch that movie lol. But I don't know, they can change a lot in the movie like they did for FNAF (they made a movie related to FNAF game and it was so different from the game)
---
What the heck. In short you didn't read and create a troll comment?
---
Original poster on r/wtf was (I think) wj7_02. No idea where it came from before this lol.
---
The buff we might want but definitely need
---
I think this is all a very flawed plan and here's why:
---
First of all remember me requires you to be hitting the obsession throughout the game to slow down the opening of the exit gates whereas rancor encourages you to ignore the obsession until the end. If you are going to spend the entire game focusing on the obsession and then hook them - why bother with rancor?
---
Secondly even if you down the obsession, you can only mori them once all the generators have been done and in which case whilst you are killing your obsession the other three survivors ( who are most likely going to be alive because you have endgame perks and have spent the entire game focusing on the obsession) are going to power the generators and that extra 16 seconds is gonna be pointless because it's mostly going to be covered by the time you mori the obsession. Then after you mori the obsession you will have go and find and hook another survivor which isn't going to happen because they will have just left. If instead you choose to hook your obsession then what is the point of rancor..?
---
I can see rancor being useful for locating survivors at the end but not for the obsession mori element as much. In which case  Rancor, noed, blood warden and remember me could work. Honestly I would just ditch remember me entirely and use another perk to help you kill off 1 person during the game so you only have three to worry about at the end.
---
There are a ton of youtube videos with tutorials on the game but don't feel like you have to stick to what they say. Since this is a PVP game a lot of your success in the game will be situational and sometimes rely on dumb luck to win. I'd recommend NoTofu, TydeTime, or HybridPanda for some good instructional videos. NoTofu does a lot of gameplay review which is great for learning from other's mistakes. Tyde while he has mostly moved away from the game still has a ton of instructional videos that explain the technical aspects of the game really well. Panda just announced he is taking a break but his Shrinewatch series explains the perks and shows them in action and what they pair with. 
---
My personal tips and tricks for new players are these:
---
Find who you like to play. Don't worry about who is strongest or the best. 
---
Do the tutorial  for both side, free blood points and teaches the basic controls for both sides 
---
Play both sides. Playing both sides makes you a better player. I am terrible with Spirit but playing her has helped me learn how to counter her more.
---
If you can afford the DLC I would suggest starting with Feng or Nancy both are the best starting survivors. Both have base perks that make the game a bit easier to learn/start with. (again though find who you like and bulds you like) If you don't want the DLC then I would suggest Claudette or Dwight to start with 
---
For killer try them all and find who you like the best. I would recommend trying wraith and using blood hound. Helps you track survivors who are injured and teaches you the mind games survivors like to play.
---
This manga based? Had to read from right to left.
---
I just have one question, do you have an idea of how to propose this fix? Because if you yourself don’t know one single fix for this problem, should you expect that the devs have a half decent fix that will please everyone
---
Yeah that'd work too
---
I don’t know about anyone else but I had a swf group all as pizza boy Dwight.
---
Is this a motherfucking brawlstars reference?!?
---
Is that the music or the Killer’s terror radius. 
---
Better yet the music your listening to is the Killer’s terror radius. Twice the radius
---
I feel that..i just use it mainly to get out of a chase because i am not very good at looping
---
Honestly, I have no idea. They've put themselves in this predicament where they either have to remove SWF or choose one of these two systems.
---
who the hell is Otzdarva...also..i didnt say he is shit, i just said this clip had no value whatsoever...and that he (assuming he did bcoz he is famous doin so) complained as usual! now, go seek somewhere ur imaginary drama sis!
---
Yes but it's effect is very minimal and doesn't prevent this and it is in limited supply. Not having to take them to the hook at all in the first place is far better. 
---
I'm talking about exchanging a completely broken offering for one that is more balanced and still useful to the killer. 
---
If you rework how they function then it ceases to be a mori. The only way to keep it as a mori is to nerf it's lethality but keep it as something that is lethal
---
As killer main... Just dont.
---
OSHA would be proud
---
Lol blind
---
Oh.. Ok thanks.
---
Is it called 'slugging' because you are swinging your weapon at all of them (slug as in 'strike') or because you are leaving them on the floor (and forcing them to crawl around like slugs)?
---
So, I don't need to rush to get the BP from those challenges?
---
Finishing a gen as the last one alive, what an absolute madlad.
---
booger!
---
The second one (leaving on the ground and forcing to crawl around like "slugs")
---
Come on guys lol let's be a bit easy on matchmaking it could be swf too
---
 I forgot about that gun! :o
---
Not gonna lie, they had us at the first half
---
I think as long as you run Spine Chill, you don’t have to worry about the killer’s terror radius. But skill checks...
---
now that scares me.
---
The entity has take over as killer now
---
These are the moments in we play for
---
Looks like he mori-ed all the others too, lucky escape!
---
His melee has range, steves invincible during/after being unhooked for a short time, he hit you trough steve because I of it.
---
That was very educational, thank you! I always thought if Silent Hill 2 could do it, why not? It's trickier than it looks.
---
Maybe they play on a different version of the game and just got whatever one you're on, or yeah they just want to play with their buda
---
I love it when people use D-Strike and Deliverance together
---
iframes then the second dash hit ur hitbox....Oni OP!!!
---
If they made it so maybe once you get towards a certain rank it's on by default I wouldn't mind that.
---
It's also similar to how Bubba's chainsaw has multiple strikes. That's more what happened here

Yep, it can hit multiple people at once. OP just picked the worst possible time to unhook if he was looking to live too
---
that was absolutely hilarious
---
But see that’s the thing. If anyone should know how to fix the game, it’s the devs. But if the devs don’t know how to fix it, it really shows how out of touch they are.

Insidious bubba
---
Anyone have a link to what these look like in-store?
---
Yeah its all cosmetic, you can buy anything from the rift after it closes from the shop according to BHVR anyways, not sure how soon after though
---
The sloppy butcher one. the one relevant to this post lol

I'll get you screenshots but imma be making transparent images of them soon

That’s what I do, no problem. I’m here to share a laugh not ruin people’s day lol
---
Yeah they are bs and I think that as a killer they make you sloppy because you get used to them and find it harder without them. 
---
I think devour hope is a good example yeah. Perhaps them just completely removing ebony moris would be good. I personally think ivory moris are in a  good spot but should be a rarer offering. You still have to the hook the survivor to get the mori but you can only mori one. It does seem a bit unfair to that one survivor though.
---
Imagine that you are in a situation where you hook a guy for the second time and then you see him doing a gen in your face. You either have to slug him for 60 seconds by which time he will have been revived by his team or you can eat the DS and he will waste more of your time. With the ebony mori change I suggested you could just mori him right there and be done with it.
---
The main issue I have is regarding the end game and I've had it where I have downed them at the exit gate and then tried to hook them but their team has all body blocked and I couldn't make it to the hook. Happens way too often and I can't slug because they just crawl out. Of course I should have just won sooner but I feel like the ebony mori could really make a difference in the endgame
---
I seen a bunch of weird things after dedicated servers. Things like hits register on a different survivor than the one being hit.
---
I once played against an ghostface who instadowned my friend from across the map after he hit me.
---
Shit doesn’t work
---
We just need more Hex perks like Haunted Ground that encourage a Hex Build entirely. 
---
Right now how it basically works is you run 4-n perk(s) and n very powerful temporary perk(s). Usually 3 and 1.
---
The problem with a lot of hexes are they either never even start (Devour Hope) or they're *so* powerful they get focused as quickly as possible (Ruin)
---
What did it do? I feel like I remember it but I can't
---
*i do*
---
All 4
---
How did you manage it?
---
Well, I find it extremely racist that Tom Cruise is blackfacing to pose as the new survivor
---
It's not. It's a glitch. The Trapper can normally walk off a trap after stepping in it.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/43561/trapper-is-still-garbage/
---
&gt; Neither is there any reward for ranking up. I know that is a widely discussed topic but it's something we would all like to have.
---
No, "we all" would not like this.
---
If you think its toxic now, imagine what depths of hell this game would decend to when they make pipping and ranking actually be incentivized.
---
Dear fucking god...
---
same thing here. can't play but that Nea skin is MINE
---
This comment scares me
---
How did you do this without making it italic?
---
Dedicated servers are the worst thing that has ever happened to dbd.
---
Why are console players so ass at decision making
---
Trapper is still the only Killer in the game who can directly "harm" himself with his own power. It's such an archaic bit of game design and honestly I don't think Trapper would be any more powerful if they removed the ability to trap yourself.
---
I'd consider it more of a Quality of Life change than a buff.
---
If you died first I bet he tunneled and camped so hard
---
I swear. I almost died for one, all three decided to leave me for dead?!

Slap on some meta perks and get a build named after you lol.

I tried playing with music in a few killer matches to get me pumped up while playing Legion. It worked! But after words I only got two kills and one of em was a low rank. Then I talked to the players after and there was a few clips of me just walking past loud nearly done gens in Lerrys because I couldn't hear shit lol.
---
:D
---
Yeah. Fucking liberal
---
Make it a double :3
---
This isn't your fault, matchmaking should make sure to stock one into every game
---
&gt;!The first one flat out states that the survivor is a female detective.
---
The second revalation describes a female killer that actively tries to build relationships with men so she can kill them, basically a black widow. She also has a weird obsession with feeding them to pigs.!&lt;
---
Ah ERB... A man of culture I see
---
In my last pig game it was the first one. Except the killer was patrolling that area so I only got halfway through and had to bail and try other boxes. Tried it again when I only had two options and it was the right one!

I have an odd obsession with stake out so I can usually do them really well even when I keep missing checks.
---
the scores don't indicate that *at all*
---
Well it kind of already is on PC with the achievements but I do see your point.

Team players make the game!
---
I did that for a while, just ensure that the music is much more quiet than the ingame music.

Where did I say it did? I never talked about level.

Lmfao nobody on all of reddit believes this my dude. Show some proof or fuck off with your blatant lies.

If you 4k easily without trying on perkless pig at rank 1 you ought to be one of the top streamers for dbd, since you are clearly the best player to have ever played the game.

Oh no wait you're a lying trolling piece of shit lol get the fuck outa here you little crybaby hate machine

I didn't wanna go down to some BS, so I booked it

When does NOED proc? I’ve seen it happen when someone starts opening the exit gates, when they’re actually open, and even after they open.

Shoot, there joke flew right over my head.

It has been so long since we needed someone like you XD

I had money for just one,rip ;-;

Just got back to this game after a month and I’m already disappointed! I’m seeing all these new cosmetics and none for my Adam WTF!?
---
blendette mains rise up
---
Lol imagine crying about the nurse nerf when shes still the strongest killer in the game
---
Ok, so why are maps like the laboratory so rare, and it's way more likely to get the 3 default maps? The corn field, the scrapyard and that other one I forgot the name.
---
Indoor maps are really rare to occur, and I was thinking that is because the killer didn't have them, most of the time.
---
Fake? It's right there
---
Not sure if xbox is on dedicated servers yet. I’ve seen vids on pc of horrible things happening consistently though. There’s always going to be latency issues I guess.

My last exam is on Thursday. After that I'll play the hell out of this game.

To be clear, 4 great skill checks. If you get 4 good skill checks, gen tapping is faster.
---
Trapper: Wraith, survivors are never happy, will never be happy and will die angry.

Don't you have to put multiple traps in very close proximity to do this?

Big Christmas wish asking for all killer perks. Lol.
---
This is an amazing idea.
---
Maybe it could work as a series similar to Until Dawn/Man of Medan.
---
I will be honest, I would shit my pants if this guy came running at me straight out of the cornfield.
---
I would definitely not pay to see that 😐
---
Well,  I'm playing both sides.  And on killer I'm never using hexes. 
---
You want arguments?  Sure
---
#1 50% speed reduction just becasue of 1 perk,  that is invisable to survivors is just ridiculous.  Yiu have to run around doing totems,  which aren't a main objective
---
#2 Huntress Lullaby is the only change that was actually good,  as it was already in game
---
#3 TotH is a hex guardian perk and it's just stupid to make another skill check perk "just because" and changing a fundamental kit of BASIC perk. We have lullaby for skillchecks
---
I'm in complete agreeance with you here.
---
F
---
Bond: let's myers see all survivors within 36 meters
---
Borrowed time: Allows Myers to safely hook survivors by tanking one DS
---

---
Update: this actually happened to me while I was playing a trapper game later yesterday (instant karma!). I had trapped a gen with a trap on both sides that people could work on it. I can back and it was touched, so I figured instead of looking for the ultra-immersed survivors, I would see how the hell they managed to work on the gen instead of getting trapped. Anyways I managed to get past the trap and damage the gen, but after the damage animation it moved me into my own trap and kept me in that same loops. Some survivor came and started tbagging and pointing at me and working on the gen like two feet away from me. I kept lunging before it trapped me again and inched towards her. She kept working on the gen, and I eventually got close enough to grab her, which allowed me to escape the glitch, thankfully!
---
Sometimes there a things that we dont say out loud in the spur of the moment, this is one of them.
---
I played a game last night where a Claudette was chased by a P3 Doctor for so long I thought they might have been farming.
---
Turns out she was just really good, and the Doctor was nice enough to ignore all the skill checks I fucked up.
---
I try everyday and she always brutally murders me after denying the snoot boop
---
Just dropped
---
Neat
---
Ugh she is so DOPE.
---
You know how many fucking times I have to pick up traps in door ways cause a survivor dead harded over it?! Poor trapper. Also thin spots like along the houses in haddonfield
---
*bong bong bongs bashfully*
---
Yes and both new outfits can be earned with shards so happy !
---
Facts !
---
You could switch to a different killer to see the item and then go back to Oni.
---
Also you didn't draw a map and a question mark for it :c
---
personally I found Freddy with his Blood Puddles Agitation (obviously), Iron Grip, Ruin and Insidious to be quite good.
---
Just put some traps at the bottom of the basement stair that way they want to hurry when they trigger it and don't look for you behind a corner I pulled 2 survivors of the hook rescue with that trick the last guy was smarter but iron grip provided enough time for me to get him into the basement to hook him.
---
No shit? Nice! Can't afford auric cells.
---
I'm the guy who gets found by the killer first and lead him straight to my teammates
---
A Nurse wiped the floor with me and my randos on PS4  the other night. I don't think she was crazy good, but just actually competent and fucked us up. Lol. 
---
Like, I wasn't taking her seriously at all because I thought she kept getting "lucky". But she was "lucky" the whole game so I'm going to say she was just skilled, lol.
---
You got me here.
---
Oh shut the fuck up. Matchmaking was fucked. He was green rank, we had one red, one brown, and 2 purple
---
My bro said this to another survivor that was on his team. Dude tried saying that he wasn't pulling his weight, despite the fact that the guy didn't even do anything.
---
im upgrading doc now for m&amp;a so i'll take that so i can save my bp for something else.
---
i'll take enduring or that discordance perk.   still dont have that one and i refuse to buy legion.
---
Except Pig, her animation is lightning fast for some reason.
---
Forever freddy doesnt exist anymore though...
---
Im sorry man, but in my opinion Adam is the most forgettable survivor in the game. But if you like playing him suit yourself :)
---
Looks like Oni likes what hes seeing.
---
holy shit
---
Ghosty Boi is best boi
---
:(
---
If you are planning on purchasing for viability then Demogorgon would probably be your best bet. 
---
Demogorgon has some really cool features in his power that provide both map mobility and a powerful lunge which can be used to zone survivors from pallets or windows. Strong killer with a high mechanical skill cap. The only issue with Demogorgon is that his perks are pretty poor quality meaning if you plan on playing another killer then the perks you gain from Demo will probably not see much use on the other killers.
---
Ghostface is pretty good as its purely around stealth. Very good if you want to be sneaky and 2/3 of his perks are decent. The only reason I choose to not recommend him over the demogorgon is because he lacks map mobility and one of the freely available killers - Wraith - is very similar to him in playstyle with stealth gameplay.
---
Pig is an alright killer. She is pretty average in terms of killers with few differential qualities. Her power helps slow the game down which is always helpful but its not really reliable. Her crouch can allow for stealth but its more or less a worse variation of Ghostfaces power. 
---
She has 2 perks that are pretty decent and 1 perk that is relatively poor.
---
I actually like the silent teleport idea a lot. I agree that his best are just the yellow and brown ones and it would be great to have better options
---
Otzdarva and Hybrid Panda are my top picks.
---
I also watch other less known streamers like TheCheshireKat and Azralynn.
---
I only got this thanks to my SWF group. And even then it was a challenge.
---
"Boop the snoot if you wanna live."
---
For killers:
---
- The Cannibal (aka Leatherface aka Bubba) has the perk BBQ and Chilli. Good for new people starting out since it gives you more bloodpoints and still a very meta perk that helps you decide what you're gonna do next. If you don't see people with this perk, then that means they are within 40 metres of where you are and you should check the area around you. His other perks are okay, but not the greatest, it's mostly BBQ you wanna take. Bubba himself is also relatively easy to play.
---
- The Hag has 2 good perks and a third that's sort of okay. Hex: Ruin is probably the most used perk by killers nowadays, allowing you to slow down games enough to not have the survivors rush generators before you can down a guy. Devour Hope is also a nice perk especially on any killer that can leave the hooked survivor quickly to down someone else. The third seal is alright and has its uses, but it's mostly used to compliment other perks and I haven't really seen it much on its own. The Hag herself is a killer with a high skill floor, but high skill ceiling and rewards good play very well. She also synergises with her own perks very well, so you don't really need other killers' perks unlocked to begin playing her, though they do help.
---
- The Shape (aka Michael Myers) has some very nice perks too, but they require a little bit more thought than something like Ruin or BBQ. Save The Best For Last helps you recover your control after a successful attack faster, instead of having your killer stare at their weapon like they're in a shitty romance novel. This is good for killers like Hag who would like to recover ASAP to use her ability to teleport and keep up the pressure, or someone like Huntress even who could attack and recover fast enough to down the survivor with a hatchet. Play With Your Food is a great perk for killers who have trouble catching up to survivors, like Bubba, especially as it can offset any movement slowdowns while he uses the chainsaw. It also pairs really well with the Oni's perk called Nemesis, since Nemesis gives you a new obsession when you get pallet-stunned and PWYF gives you more movespeed when you lose chase with your obsession, essentially meaning you can chase whoever you like, force a stun and then benefit from it anyway. Dying Light is a nice perk that could help slow down the game as you gain traction, but it's not as great as slowing down the game as things such as Ruin or Pop Goes The Weasel. I don't see it in play as much, but it's alright in fun builds.
---
I'm going to have some notable mentions for killers with perks that are nice, but are less generic and sort of only work for certain playstyles/killers:
---
-The Pig for Surveillance and Make Your Choice
---
-The Oni for Nemesis (Works well with PWYF)
---
-The Doctor for Monitor and Abuse (which works well with The Plague's Infectious Fright if you intend to get this)
---
-The Clown for Pop Goes The Weasel
---
TLDR: Get The Cannibal for BBQ and Chilli and The Hag for Hex:Ruin if you want decent perks. Everything else after that sort of relies on the killer, your playstyle and/or the perks you already have.
---
Hey, I just noticed that too!
---
*Cries in Trapper's Mori*
---
No0b tree
---
Other people have suggested IT as a killer and having this mechanic. IT would infect or create his own lockers and would step in/out of them in a creepy peek-a-boo style scare.
---
I just played Oni on Badham Preschool and didnt even intend to go for it, I just wanted to do a daily. But at one points I downed someone in the cellar of the school and the basement was right next to me so I hooked the surv there. And from that point I always tryharded to get them into the basement when I downed someone. And yeah it worked out.  
---
Its funny because I gave up on the challenge and got lucky right on the next game. I didnt even have Agitation or Iron Grip on my build.
---
My appologies I didn't mean to imply you were running an insidious bubba or being toxic. I was just saying saying I was seeing a ton of it the last couple days and assume it is because people are desperate to finish the challenges that they are pulling out toxic behavior/builds. I got called toxic and told I was "Banned for life" by a player because I didn't let them finish their challenge.
---
Where is Apyr?
---
I love him so much. 
---
His style is cool. Hair physics are beautiful. Nice backstory. Decent perks, I wish Distortion had more tokens but I’m happy. The only downside is that Im probably going to have to run Iron Will.
---
Adding some rarity to perks and items could be good, but that perk cost is a bit too much, imagine getting it in bloodweb on low levels when you just start playing.
---
I like calm perk because it counter camping and punishing killer for being near hook. Wasting his time.
---
After last breath is somehow not okay, you cant manage when survivor dies, so its 2 token is awful, also this perk is not usable almost whole game. To addition it profits from letting survivors die, which brokes concept of teamwork.
---
Hit and hide could be okay but that time is way too long, when you get sprintburst and manage to stun then run or be lucky with adrenaline it gets you way too much advantage.
---
Last thing you will do again blocks for too long also it block everything and gets killer at last one free hit it could even more. Its like hook every 80sec, you just need to get palled stuned.
---
Instant regret is not okay too because its not having range on vision, like survivor is running throught pallet to gen and boom, killer saw him. It gives too much information. And blocking pallets on start of chase, hell man thats strong, you dont have to care about Safe/unsafe pallet, just go throught. 8sec Are still a lot in dbd. And range of blocked pallets, ok, but it still gives you easy free hit and with no cooldown you can just cloak and uncloak as wraith to reset it.
---
I can say that I have been mass downvoted for this meme alone-
---
its pretty normal to 99 gates, for getting a late save without egc puttin pressure on u or just to make the trial last longer and get some extra xp
---
Sorry I'm dumb, please help:

Hopefully with the recent changes that are now supposed to punish people that DC, this kind of behavior will be nipped in the bud. I agree though, the majority of matches are ruined by the ludicrous amount of people that act this way

ok, sort of !
---
Are you really complaining about gen tapping?
---
They need to revisit the moris of a few killers. Like Trapper needs a trap used in some way, maybe tosses it down and then  slams your head into it? Huntress should be survivor scurrying away only to get an axe tossed in their back.
---
The n word
---
Yea that would benefit the experience a lot. But I also see problems with this approach. For example the lesser challenges would be to easy to complete this way, so you would be finished too fast.
---
Ouch ! You really got me there 👌

By far the coolest weapon in the game.

Isn't Karma just the gamerscore of Reddit?

Does it actually do anything?

---
vommy mommy mains rise
---
I've had the same issue. I don't play killer super often anymore, but I'd like to get my challenges done.
---
sound is absolutely crucial while playing dbd, both as killer and survivor. as much as I'd love to play while listening to music, that'd just hinder gameplay
---
I just stand there and wait for gens. I open the gate to force them out. I don't play that shitty map.
---
Imagine crying about gen tapping💀
---
That perk is so situational that its unplayable. And i think killers want some emotes as survivors, not just nonmeta perks oř funny perks.
---
I can understand that. It doesnt feel good to be forced to play a lot of games (if you are unlucky) with a certain killer or perk or a certain objective that you dont like to play as/ play with/ do.
---
Reminds me of hellraiser pinning human parts to the spinning wooden block.  Definitely unnerving.
---
I really doubt it will, its gonna be pretty frustrating getting hit with penalties when the game freezes etc.,
---
Very much clear.
---
imagine using an exploit that adds 20 seconds to normal gen speed
---
What? It afflicted survivors, not the Wraith
---
Try playing hag and just trap the basement engough to always have a teleport spot and to force them to stay on the stairs a little longer. Run thanat, ruin, pop and any other perks
---
I loaded into the game, saw this, was immediately freaked out and couldn’t decide if it was gross enough to go back to the default Katana or freakishly cool that I should stick with it. I stuck with it. I ain’t wasting my money.
---
Gen Tapping is honestly just hilarious to me.  Imagine giving up on improving at a core game mechanic and figuring out the laziest least efficient way to repair the gen instead.  It's almost impressive their level of commitment to not improving at this game.  
---
BHVR won't do anything by the way.  It's just a really inefficient way for bad players to repair a gen but totally game legal.  It's kind of like facecamping.  That's the least efficient way of getting kills and a terrible strategy used by bad players that can't be bothered to improve at the game but again technically a strategy nonetheless.
---
I don't always follow the rule of "snoot boop=life."
---
That is even worse.
---
Yeah cause I got the short end of the stick with shit match making and a green killer using purple add ons lmao. If it makes you feel any better I was the last to die and only got caught cause my meter filled up quickly cause we were in Hawkins
---
Hey but at least he has a no hat cosmetic.
---
That's my point, adding a fifth slot even just for hexes defeats the point.
---
Face camping screws someone else over. Gen tapping just screws yourself over with extra time to finish the gen.
---
Ah, so everything was at fault except you? Noted.
---
Yea hopefully it's been implemented in a smart way (most of the community seems to be in the dark about how it actually works so far), but it will at least stop people dcing back to back to back
---
Exactly! I got unlucky
---
No need to apologise, I didn't take it that way. Just letting you know I don't use it. People throw this "toxic" word out A LOT. So much so it's lost its true meaning. More times than not, people use it just for the sake of using it. It's like "oh the killer hit me before I vaulted a window, he's being toxic". It means nothing to me
---
Im not having issues executing the 4 down there. Im having issues with them dcing to fuck me over.
---
FYI for those stating im "crying". Its flair'd as Shitpost/Meme not Discussion my dudes. Gen tapping by definition is an exploit but i dont care about it as killer or survivor
---
To be fair, shadowborn keeps the increased field of view during a chase while monitor and abuse still keeps the decreased terror radius. Using both definitely isn't optimal or efficient, but its a total waste of 2 slots.
---
I'm not a good Killer by any means, but if someone unhooks a player right in front of me I typically ignore the person that just got unhooked and go after the unhooker, to give the other player a chance. Or, I will hit the injured survivor and leave them slugged so they have another opportunity to get up. Even if that means I don't get any kills in the end, it doesn't really bother me.  I'm a survivor main and it sucks if someone unhooks you next to the killer and doesn't try to bodyblock....you just don't have any control over that and it's a shitty feeling.  But everyone else is right, it's not your fault that they are doing safe unhooks in your face and leaving their teammate to die. It sucks for the person that is targeted but your goal IS to kill them.
---
Well since you have teammates as survivor you're inherently hurting your teammates too by not doing the gens as quick
---
Shows why he had to use a Mori lol
---
She does get punished with fatigue..?
---
You can get plenty of viewing time while waiting for lobbies!
---
I'm sorry you feel that way man, but why doesn't the dev open up the code and put in a conditional to fix it then? I hit probably 3/5 of the hex skill checks, but that doesn't mean my teammates aren't on the same Gen putting it back over and over. That's when I start tapping, and if they don't I just leave the Gen.
---
I hope your mind was changed op lol. Sorry if some people were rude about it, but tapping definitely more harmful to the person doing it than helpful
---
Now I'm morbidly curious
---
Lmao i just went to the survivor side of things and figured id do the chests, immediately get sandbagged by a david. He fast vaults through stuff next to me. Then dcs when the killer shows up. Lmao im done for the day.
---
Where is totem hunter?
---
I've done it to at least 9 different pigs, all of which just down me on the spot. However not even joking, all of them have yet to put a trap on me. They do it to everyone else but not me during the entire match. I'll take it.
---
Imagine cutting down trees for entertainment 
---
-the plant  gang
---
And if things go especially haywire, a soul for multiple souls.
---
Thats so sad..
---
Ok this is my new rule now, when I block a survivor from accessing a Jigsaw box or block them so the trap pops, I will give them a chance if they boop the snoot (I bought the Jigsaw dlc 3 days ago and I was able to deny access to the Jigsaw box twice and it felt good)
---
Lol the 8 Survivor names

Nah you're actively hurting each one of your teamates by not being capable of pulling your fair share of work into the objectives.  Literally anyone reading this that gen taps don't do it to yourself.  Just repair normally man.  It's the only way these people will ever improve and Ruin is in almost every game when you rank up.  Even if you miss like every other one and hit the good instead of the great for regression you'll still work through it faster.  You don't have to be a great skill check machine though they do become pretty easy over time.  I play on PS4 btw so I don't want to even hear the tired "but console skillchecks are too laggy to hit".
---
3 gens popping after a single hook is straight up unfun to play against
---
In my eyes, gen rushing is when a 4-man swf decides to all use purple toolboxes with gen speed addons as well as perks that increase gen speed with the sole intention of trying to do the gens as fast as possible, aka “gen rush”. I’ve done this with friends a couple of times and it can be really fun, but as you would expect, annoying for the killer. What your teammates did in this video wasn’t gen rushing in the slightest. They were all working on separate gens and probably started working on them at the beginning of the game, which is why they all popped around the same time. The way I see it, it’s impossible for a solo-survivor team to gen rush because it isn’t coordinated or intentional, just unlucky for the killer.

Idk what add ons he had but we were on Hawkins so it was hard to get away from his radius cause he had an add on that increased it by 25% I believe? Don’t quote me on that I just glanced over them real quick and then he had an another one that increased madness so it was hard to avoid it. I managed to be the last survivor standing but I also got matched with a brown rank and two purple ranks which has nothing to do with anything, any rank can be good but this specific team didn’t seem like they knew what they were doing so it sucked
---
ive avoided so many deaths against ghostface bc hes so loud with his cape and stompsa
---
It *is* fair. How is not?
---
What do *you* think it should be.
---
&gt; I don't see why you have to be negative about this.
---
Says the person complaining without offering a solution
---
Wonder why.
---
It only takes 3 gens completed to get the final 2 survivors out.  This is the much more common use of keys and it's pretty absurd that it works this way.  At red ranks 3 gens completed is an assumption.
---
Honestly I encounter way more toxic killers than survivors. Depends how everyone is playing.  If a killer is being a butthole, my team and I will be a butthole. Likewise when I'm killer the survs hardly ever have anything bad to say. I'm just not a asshole
---
DISGOSTANG!!
---
This isn't a game issue; this is a your own mental health issue. This is not a normal response to challenges you don't like at all

---
Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
Yes please. I don't care about wait times, I should not be playing with a rank 15
---
Is that the offering for Ormond?
---
Bad wording on my part, what im trying to imply is that other examples of battlepass challenges in other games are a lot less time consuming and give more progress towards it. I know everyone hates on fortnite but their battle pass is actually one of the best and I wish other games would learn from it.
---
I get it battle passes are supposed to be grindy. But I really think they could tone it down a bit.
---
The best solution would be to add some kind of other objective to gens to give killers a bit more time. Make survivors have to collect parts, flip a switch, physically power the gen up once the repair is complete, etc. Ive seen a lot of suggestions as to what exactly it could be but something like this would buy killers time without making gens even more boring.
---
Or we could swap it! This is how the killer looks when he's about to hook you in the basement but you're able to DC when he's about to hook you. Especially when he's playing the clown. /s
---
Yeah, they need to slow down gens altogether, so killers don't have to use ruin. It would make it more enjoyable for both sides
---
Mostly Pallet related ones and teleporting killers. Its also much easier to get stuck inside pallets now as both killer and survivor. 
---
Also these kinds of hits are everywhere

Thx!
---

---
I play with music, but I turn it so low that literally nothing has to be happening for me to hear it
---
its a mixture of both you mong. i was excited for them, got in too deep, it started to ruin me. obviously im not the only person who has felt this pain and thats why i gave up on doing them. im back to playing the game to have fun
---
I think all they have to do is allow you to do 2 survivor challenges at once and 2 killer challenges at once
---
my friend/roommate and I, who share an account (he plays only killer, I, solo survivor) attempted to grind through the rifts and it was so unfun. definitely almost ruined the game for me tbh, even tho i like the *idea* of the archives. went back to playing much more casually and for no specific achievement other than to have a good time, and it’s helped a lot.
---
did I want to finish the tomes and unlock all the cool stuff — definitely. but it’s not worth losing the love I have already for the game just for some cool cosmetics or some lore i can find online eventually. we now have way more fun hopping on for an hour or two a night, a couple matches each. we win some games, we get destroyed in others, but we’re having a much better time playing the game the way we want to play it.
---
we do still play the game often with a challenge activated on the off-chance that a match results in us achieving it, but we don’t put any focus into the challenge. we just play. 
---
just my two cents 🤷‍♂️
---
Um... gg is supposed to show good sportsmanship, it's okay if you don't say it but I can't find one logical reason for it to annoy you
---
That honestly would be good I agree
---
I literally ran in a circle for 3 gens while they were trying to chase me. No way a purple rank killer has that bad of corn blindness.
---
If you mostly play survivors it shouldnt be bad but i have heard occasionally it swaps. Just know that solo queue is a pit of despair with pockets of fun waiting at random.
---
I straight up think you need to just stop playing video games entirely for awhile because this is not normal 
---
&gt; obviously im not the only person who has felt this pain
---
yeah and they have issues, too.
---
Well that explains a lot...
---
Gotta boop the snoot if you wanna scoot.
---
Red ranks are by far the saltiest assholes in the game.  I've had them do the same to me, or purposefully run to the opposite corner to be slugged.    
---
I just tanked my rank and then slaughtered some unfortunate lowbies who had more integrity to not DC.
---
knocking people for having mental health issues is a great way to live your life. i bet you're real fuckin fun at parties man!
---
Okay? They must have had that severe of corn blindness, then. It's just a literal fact that the bug only affected survivors. People played Wraith with the intention of exploiting it
---
Nobody was injured or hooked when I went to check out both gates. I did wait around for a bit to check if they'd come but they didn't, which I guess understandable now if they wanted more points. If someone needed saving I definitely wouldn't have tried opening the gate 
---
My only defense is that I saw the killer coming my way, which prompted me to open the gate as I didn't want to die (it would be my death hook) I honestly never encountered a 99 gate before, so it was a total surprise on my part.. They didn't believe me though and just kept swearing at me and calling me the asshole for killing them all
---
The looter dance is so good
---
Trapper: Do you wanna go for a ride? Or *do you wanna go for a ride?
---
Feng: **Yes

I'm not "knocking" anyone. I'm literally saying you all need to take care of yourselves because this is abnormal
---
3000 IQ right here
---
I want Vigil to get a buff so bad
---
Hey wait a minute this looks suspicious
---
Now as you can read from my flair I love Trapper, but I think that making so he doesn't step in his own traps could be a little unfair for the survivors, now let me list what changes I would want: 
---
1) You are able to see your traps aura everytime at any distance through walls, this might not be a serious issue but it's more of a quality of life change since so mahy times I couldn't see where my traps that maybe had the darkening addon were, so I couldn't pick them or i trapped myself in them
---
2) Make the yellow darkening addon useful, it's currently useless since it doesn't change how hard it is to locate the trap
---
3) The base Trapper kit starts with 1 trap in his hand and can carry up to 2
---
4) With the base Trapper kit disarming traps is slower, idk just add the Strong Coil Spring to the default kit so disarming a trap isn't faster then arming one
---
5) A trap that is getting disarmed by a survivor but isn't, won't trap the Trapper, what I'm trying to say is that you can stop cheeky survivors who try to disarm your traps but you can't do anything without first trapping yourself
---
6) A trap that is being disarmed by another survivor won't make it useless if another survivor steps on it, this happens so many times with swf, a survivor is looping trapped loop and the other survivor just comes by and disarms the trap in a matter of seconds where you don't even have tume to react and this also causes the Trapper to step in his own trap sometimes because the trap behind the window was being disarmed when the survivor was vaulting but the disarm animation got interrupted when the Trapper vaulted
---
Nicely put.
---
The best is when they you 180 them, they swing and their model glitches to face backward and hit you
---
Burger King Myers = Euphoria
---
When the current Rift ends, everything in it (costumes, Auric Cells, charms) will be locked away for a certain period of time - that content will eventually appear in the store.
---
The Tome itself will no longer award Fragments, but as far as we know the Bloodpoints will still be awarded.
---
If you've done all the easier challenges in IV then it's probably worth your while looking at any you skipped in I-III. You should probably sit down and work out how many Tiers you have left, and how many games+challenges you're going to need to do in order to finish the Rift.
---
Why are people downvoting this. The Trapper knowingly exploited a glitch to get everyone. Maybe the first person was an accident, but he fully knew what he was doing the second time, then ran across the map to get the last guy. He very obviously was abusing a bug to win the game. He had 2 people on his shoulder that weren't hooked  or downed, so they couldn't even be saved. This is complete bug abuse and cheating, so why is everyone against someone calling him out for it?
---
It would be funny if that was part of his power : comes out like a weasel and smacks and *poof* it goes back
---
Спасибо друг
---
Like everyone else said, you are fine except for rehooking the one that was just unhooked. Usually when im playing killer and that happens in front of me, I'll slug the one downed so the unhooker can't get the bloodpoints, and then go after the one that unhooked them.
---
Can I pick the gen rusher?
---
Nah, they do nothing but gens, and noed spawns right near last gen or in front of a gate.
---
*boop*
---
He could have with the second person, but he knowingly replicated the bug, and it gives him a huge advantage, and at the end he picked up 3 survivors at once.
---
I see you found some straws and built a man.
---
It's referencing a LolTyler1 meme:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvMbROMGlPE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvMbROMGlPE)
---
And suddenly im a doctor main
---
Oh hot
---
I *love* the impossibly small gaps survivor can fit beside a trap next to a wall/door as well.   Feels like survivors need to step on the exact pixel of the middle of the trap for it to get them.
---
It procs when the gates are powered, but the notification only appears when a survivor gets hit.
---
Real talk, Ormond needs consistent map spawn rules. You either get a super strong survivor map with maze tile into jungle gym into shack into like 3 rocket pallets and the god window upstairs in the center, or you get none of that and a bunch of 4-lanes.
---
is this cropped porn?

pig and ghostface players are some of the more wholesome killers

Honestly learning how to play without "crutch"perks is better in the idea of training with ankle weights, but what isn't good as far as learning is only playing within that group. If you're having fun that's dope so keep doing your thing! However, if you want to actively get better I'd suggest also watching videos/ streams to see what good players do on either side. That's where you learn the best tactics

Kate and Meg for me. I'm not sure why I picked them, but they are my go to everytime. Sometimes David or Feng. For Killers im either Spirit or Plague

6 years from now we will be seeing the story of how you be came a killer and posted on a reddit forum
---
Look at all the virtue signaling
---
Well, when my only Killer leveled is Trapper, I almost have to use all I have. 
---
I really need to get some teachables.
---
This subreddit is 80% killer mains. Dudes that play the game alone and treat survivors like NPCs. Any competent killer player is 4king right now more than ever, and yet when they face 1/10 teams with coordination they baby rage and circlejerk.
---
The dev is shit at his own game and has balanced around SWF, so that's why if you solo q survivor at medium - high ranks its near impossible to win. You also aren't allowed to say anything bad about any killer or their power level because then that would imply that people aren't the leet gamers they think they are.
---
Now I know who is making me have Chipotle diarrhea each time I play against a hag!
---
IT SAYS: DWIGHT'S INTERESTING WAY OF TRYING TO ESCAPE THE PIG. CLIMB THE TREE!
---
In which map? Lery's?
---
This is the first time I'm seeing this image, and I have several questions.
---
Mind fucking blown, couldn’t have said it any better myself
---
&gt; The pass isn't meant to be maxed casually if you just do the entire archive, you need to actually have alot of gametime to do it.
---
Not according to the devs.  Only 1 hour of game time needed a day to max it according to them.   They should take the person who said that and send them the way of Old Yeller.
---
 It's just a game at the end of the day, so people shouldn't *have* to be gods at it to enjoy it. That's an awfully elitist attitude to have for a game like DBD.
---
wow....this is fucking genius...how big is your dick?
---
i have no clue i mightve been tripping but i couldve sworn i was pointing at my feng in a mirror in one of the indoor ones
---
Do you ever use stereo headphones/Stridor? I use listening a lot in general and it helps me in dark maps. Surveillance is somewhat helpful as well, especially if you can stealth back to a generator as GF/Pig
---
then u were right, if u play solo secure ur escape always, i dont have a problem with swf but they wont help u if are a solo.
---
 However iirc u can also see the progress bar of the gate without opening it to make sure, or as u said guide for the lights on the gate, just in case u dont want to open a gate that has been 99d before.
---
LOL
---
I might be anecdotal evidence of why you're seeing Ghostface a bunch right now. Sales like the current one are always pretty tempting because he is a few bucks cheaper than most of the other DLC, especially for killer mains who don't really care too much about unlocking a survivor.
---
He is actually quite a lot of fun to play. I wouldn't say it is a great killer, but even when three or four people escape I find that I'm not depiping.
---
what about a killer that can hide in lockers? LEL
---
You just lost all upvotes you gained with this post lmao
---
How does crossplay works? Can I play with my PS4 friend?
---
Gens are supposed to get completed in the video game dead by daylight
---
Again it's guaranteed slower repairs than simply working through it.  It's a shoddy substitute for learning to play the game.
---
If the killer ever camps their Ruin totem they're fools.  You just sit on the gens and bang them out while they mindlessly stare at their lit Bones not realizing gens can be completed whether that's up still or not.
---
By gen tapping you're actively avoiding improving at a core mechanic in the game at the detriment to your team.  We all start out as potatoes initially but some of us stay starchy forever and gen tapping is a great road to that.
---
They didn't look back for me :(
---
I was only repaying the favor
---
That would be a huge nerf for Hag mains ..
---
It is not, especialy when its the last survivor that has nowhere to run and just stays in the locker for the eternity, its not fun to anybody, not logical and doesnt give you almost any points/emblems etc
---
Why are you being downvoted? Weren't Freddy's slow down add ons nerfed?
---
I almost always let the last remaining survivor have the gate if I shut the hatch before they get to it. And while they're pulling the lever, I crouch right up to them hoping for a snoot boop 😫 but never get one.
---
I will take the downvotes gladly for this
---
Did you see my flashlight skills? Garbage XD
---
Agreed :3
---
nah, let us get the killer with shards so everyone can buy him
---
because we get out played a lot lmao gotta bandage those wounds somehow.
---
...deal with it and just grab them out and hook them. christ
---
For me, some perks (like Small Game) helped me learn faster than I would have otherwise. I learned that totems tend to be over here every time I get one of those pings. However, if you _keep_ on using those perks after they've served their purposes, then you're hindering yourself.
---
Crutches aren't a bad thing if you're just getting on your feet, but eventually you should put them aside. Small Game to learn totems and trap locations. Windows of Opportunity if you're working on a pallet slam challenge. Spies so that you learn to listen to birds. Self Care if you're not usually able to find somebody to heal you.
---
Use the crutches - that's what they're there for. But then put them aside.
---
Have a nice day.
---
we should murder the devs because someone was wrong gamers rise up!
---
If you're on ps4 level up feng to get two of the perks I mentioned as ps4 got spark of madness for free
---
And thats exactly why its basically the same as dc-ing. They are going to die anyway, but they just feel the urge to make the game worse for the killer
---
Not really supporting ops view but I got almost blinded from someone not even in my FOV while looking face blank at a rock. Flash light mechanics could use some attention.

It’s not that it’s a bad idea, what I mean is that, that can be extremely broken with some builds to the point where it won’t be fun to play against.
---
Sometimes you just gotta take things at face value.
---
It's a true wonder how you can speak so much with the devs cock that far down your throat.
---
Survivors never care about if you pipped or not, their insults are usually personal
---
It’s hitler spending quality time with Kirby what more could you ask
---
Added Nea - Reckless Boarder, Oni - Ice-Cold Legacy &amp; Yui - Snow Motocross
---
I see you tried something and failed.
---
Being sneaky is kind of contingent on the killer *letting you be sneaky*. If they're running Barbecue &amp; Chilli, Bitter Murmur, Surveillance, or Whispers then it's going to be hard for you to avoid their eye.
---
Your best bet is to spend the time to learn loops, so that you can lose the killer or at least buy your team some time. Good info [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqpGXoLSDNEUrBfACKnAhVA/search?query=loop). There's also a lot of general guides in our main thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d5elu7/guides_resources_for_new_players/).
---
-4% (on the per survivor one which was decreased from 3 to a 2%) and -5%, pretty big nerf yeah. I don't think it's viable anymore, but I haven't seen anyone play with or against it.
---
That makes sense, I thought it would show immediately but I guess it’s like Ruin where you don’t know you’re cursed until someone gets a skill check.
---
Cosplay is currently only for Windows store and steam.

If I'm thanking the killer for something, i crouch twice and at the end of the second crouch I stay down to let them know im playing nice.
---
HOW. DO YOU EVEN! I GO TO ARC THE KILLER WITH WAY MORE ROOM THAN THAT EVEN AND STILL GET TAPPED SLIGHTLY BY THE FART THEY RELEASED UPON MY PASSING! 
---
Sorry but I had to get that out cause fuck
---
That's why we should test them beforehand!
---
That is fucked! I need it.

No because your all fucking liars who hook camp after that so stop with the bs post!!

It's an eternal issue with trap Killers being way too good in the basement. The way I see it they can either buff Trapper or nerf Hag and Demogorgon.
---
~~Honestly I'd prefer for them to add more ways in / out of the basement.~~

Like it matters right now, bhvr once again fucked up the footstep and also downed survivors sounds. I have no idea how they do that from patch to patch
---
Otz recently made a video where he mentions exactly what you said. "Trapper is a territorial Killer, and maybe I don't want to walk across the map to get a trap."
---
He was discussing with Twitch chat if Trapper should get his traps from lockers.
---
\\\*boop\\\*
---
When the survivor is really good and is juking me most of the time I'm impressed and I know it's a good player, better than me as survivor for sure. 
---
But sadly these players are rare, so many survivors have to, after every little successful juke, teabagg like some fucking morons because they think one successful pallet drop means they're god tier players. I meet so many of these morons in the purple ranks it's not even funny anymore.
---
Didn't they say demos mori doesn't have decapitation because the game will get banned in china? Then they put THIS into the game?

I'd love to see your calculations.   The numbers I've seen and ran come out to closer to 4 when you factor in average wait time in lobbies.
---
You can spin your killer in the lobby screen can't you, or did they remove that?
---
has to build his ego somehow :/
---
Basically when the Wraith gets an uncloak hit he applies a limited time version of Sloppy Butcher. Using it with the perk would cause the visual effect on the survivor (blood spewing from their model) to last forever which would drop frame rates for most survivors and be really annoying to see your character gushing like a fountain until you got healed.

I had a game against a Ghostface where after a long chase he'd cornered me in the Grim Pantry, I was injured and had nowhere to go and he stood looking at me. I decided to t-bag slowly twice to try and garner some mercy, the same style of t-bag you'd use to thank a team mate for a heal. He nodded and t-bagged back. We t-bagged together for about a minute before he wandered off to catch someone else.
---
Those chests ain't gonna search themselves
---
This is absolutely beautiful ❤️
---
Thank you!
---
in my experience it always has insane tiles because the entire map is essentially connected. You'd have killer shack connected to a pallet loop, connected to an L wall T wall connected to a long wall etc. it's just a really frustrating map to play in. It's also kinda hard to see auras and scratch marks in it. The map is insanely large so saving teammates or patrolling gens can be a nuisance and don't get me started on the times where the middle is absolutely bullshit
---
How is she a loser? The guy could just wiggle.
---
Who... MADE this though...?
---
I recommend the basic perks, Stuff like Borrowed time, Lithe, Prove thyself, Kindred, ect.
---
If you need any more help, you can send me a PM with your discord tag and i can explain anything you want pretty quickly
---
I found that as a ghostface, making it a priority to sit outside one of the windows to work best, when they start working on gens you can usually get grabs without them knowing the wiser because they're usually looking at the stairs. Sure a few gens will pop if they don't dart for it first, but the slow methodical approach to being an immersed spookface is werth.

Didnt you just repost this  [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eegymy/archives\_interrupt\_and\_grab\_a\_survivor\_the\_game/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eegymy/archives_interrupt_and_grab_a_survivor_the_game/)

Certified original meme. Never once posted since Jane was released into the game.
---
They're so cute. I love them.
---
...killers do get punished for that
---
There is literally a perk for killers that only works when they are standing still. Wouldnt make sense. The devs of the game have said themselves that camping the hook is a legitimate strategy and while it may not be fun for 1 survivor,  the other survivors can completely play around this. And there is no penalty for staying in one AREA but instead for just not moving. You can stay on a gen for 1 minute without moving and you wouldnt get any crows. It's only when you go afk
---
Kill them when u hooked them twice it worked for me
---
I did it awhile back near archive start and didn't factor in wait time since my wait times are less then 5 minutes at any time of the day.
---
I did it like 15 minutes a match and 600 XP a match, you needed 1 level a day to complete it. Archives when i calculated it based on only tier 1 released it was 35 total tiers from archives, so you need 35 total level ups to complete it
---
800 gives you a token, so 8000 is a complete level up
---
8000 x 35= 280000, minus 600x70 =238000  for FGTOTD bonus on both sides.
---
So 238000 / 600 XP per game, which is what i usually get rounded to the nearest 100 for variance = 396.66, rounded to 397 games for gameplay purposes.
---
397/4 for 15 minutes per game, so 4 games in an hour is 99.25 hours played to complete the pass, while simultaneously doing the challenges in this time period. Round it up to 140 to add another 40 hours of wait time and bullshit challenges like the 4 hook or 4 gen one if you want.
---
Thats 2 hours a day, starting day 1. My math may be off cause this was just offhand so please point anything out if you want.
---
Killers do lose points in an emblem category for staying within 16 meters of the hooked survivor if there are no other survivors within 16 meters.  
---
It definitely sucks but don't play into their game.  Be popping gens while they are camping and leave them at low ranks as you climb.  
---
Now when I get facecamped I know I had a good chase and feel pretty good about it actually.
---
plus ghostface and pig share a quality most killers don't have crouching to communicate their intentions to survivors
---
Read what I wrote. Staying in a locker to let the entity take them isn't a survival tactic. It's just choosing to die in a way that denies someone an achievement.
---
You start by making eye contact with Pig and showing your intent by pointing at her while standing or crouching. If the Pig proceeds to crouch and oink, your attempt was successful. You may then come next to her and closely point at her snoot.
---
The outcome of this interaction varies. More often, you'll either have your life spared or receive a stylish reverse bear trap as a token of her appreciation. But some Pigs have a very sensitive snoot and will be upset by your touch.
---
As a pig main, the last survivor booping the snoot is the determining factor as to whether or not they get the hatch.
---
It's not really necessary, since the only time killers go afk is when they camp or just miss when the match starts. It just sucks that Kindred doesn't show insidious camping killers anynore, but that's really the only time it would be a problem, unless they stay in range when they go insidious. Their aura would just disappear as soon as they go into oblivious.

Killers do get penalized, it's called losing the game if they ignore the other 90% of the map
---
To be honest I really didn't find them hard. Tome 3 was difficult before the changes (or rather, grindy), but Tome 4 felt very easy. I think the only one that took me more than one try was the Dark Sense one.
---
I was thinking more like an American Horror Story/Haunting of Hill House anthology tv series.

Bubba has a mild screen shake, and I think wraith  bops up and down a little bit too

Unless they decide to play regularly then you are in a lot of trouble

Looper, and my other 3 friends are inmersed and looters at the same time
---
Boop
---
This post looks like an excuse to brag
---
It being anyone else
---
I try to be the looper, but get distracted by chests find a toolbox and go “I can rush a gen!!” Get immersed then end up on the floor. Get hooked, get unhooked, provided I’m not getting face camped, then get healed and try to loop. Only to then wind up back in the floor after 20 seconds....
---
Because I used negative language towards the killer and people downvoted before watching the video because you see the next comment getting up votes and it says the same thing as mine just in a nicer tone
---
^see!
---
I don't know how close you are to 70 but I'm similarly getting burnt out on the game. But luckily as long as I play a killer game + survivor game each day I can get there and ignore the rest of the challenges.
---
I know there is a 2x BP coming up, if it falls before the rift ends that might be the time to push some extra EXP grinding and if a challenge finishes during those games then its a bonus
---
Nope, different match, different killer, different outcome
---
Only similarity is we were probably doing the same challenge.
---
Oh ok I'll do that sometime
---
why? pig is a pretty shit killer. her power doesn't slow games down all that much. survivors usually just power through gens anyway and the dude with the hat always gets it off 1st or 2nd try so he's in no real danger of dying to it and ghostface is all about mindgames. if you die to a ghostface he just blatantly outplayed you
---
The guy who made the screenshot is playing ghostface, while his friend is playing demogorgon. So yeah...

Yes, it’s originally Japanese

---

No thanks, if killers can't be nice and do stuff for survivors such as focus farmers instead of tunneling then no point being nice back.
---
Isn’t football more a boomer thing? You don’t even make any sense
---
yeah don't try to boop the snoot while their are still 4 people alive. pig needs her pip too
---
Dude... you’re being so dramatic. I just proposed an idea. If it’s wrong it’s wrong. People are going to bitch about anything and everything regardless- so don’t knock me down for saying 1 little thing jfc
---
This is done during the game right?
---
Dwight unless you like messing around with hooks and unhooking shenanigans because that's what Steve is more or less good for.
---
The hair is weird
---
No, going into people's post histories to try and find dirt is a boomer thing
---
Exactly, the subreddit is filled with upset killer mains who think they are always the victims no matter what.
---
I even literally had a killer call me toxic because I vaulted a window TWICE in a chase.
---
I'm new, what is this?
---
Yep, and Demogorgon is a thwompy stompy boy. Different Killers have different movement styles that you can feel
---
The coloring process is what takes very long, the lines have to be clean in order to color it and you have to mix the colors until it looks like what you want it to. The left hand (right from our view) for example took about half an hour to get the form correct and one more hour to color it (arm not included). And the hand was besides the shape (because hands are a pain to draw) the part that took by far the least amount of time. I'm new to coloring so I'm not sure if it usually takes this long for others aswell though. And thank you!
---
Even Speedwagon is afraid!
---
That seems nice... Hold up
---
Was that killer even available in 2016? I remember the starting 3 being Trapper, Wraith, and Hillbilly
---
I wonder if u won that game tho lmao

The time that happened to me was when the surv DCed.

I'm hoping to get a drawing tablet for Christmas. I'll probably be more willing to draw if all the tools are already at my disposal. Markers and all that can be really expensive, which is one of the things that discourages me from putting time into drawing.
---
Aw thank you!! And yeah coloring surely is difficult, I'll probably stick to black&amp;white / uncolored drawings. Affords way less time and nerves lol
---
If they were just naturally longer it would just take longer. 
---
Ruin causes some survivors to fail the skillchecks, giving info, every single skillchecks is also a regression of 5%. 
---
Longer gens wouldn't be as bad as ruin. But it would make ruin much stronger.
---
doesnt matter if its basement. Take any loop and place a trap at the pallet or just around the corner on the edge. Survivors now need to take the long way around or drop pallet and vault, while trapper could cut the curner or walk right through the trapped pallet. It would be insanely strong
---
...Right. So it's quite a bit more likely that it's the fact they've never had any form of damage in the game from Day 1 rather than just not having it in China.
---
Thank you! And to be fair, he doesn't look as massive and tall ingame as the trailers showed... Kinda disappointed me tbh, I thought we're getting one special unit of a killer
---
Yeah, best killlers on ps4 are by far spirit and billy imo. Ghostface is actually really good aswell.
---
It's just a meme. There's plenty of examples here: https://www.reddit.com/r/oinkers_

Angry, I see. Well I'm sorry you prolly play a shit survivor and aggravate the Killer to the point of making the game unfun.
---
I would Freddy has Ghostface beat. And beats Billy in terms of consistency because Billy can still get shut down by loops. Billy has higher killing potential though. Love me some Billy.
---
Provides an instant increase in swag
---
New player here, is there some kind of guide or anything out there to help me with chases as a survivor? I feel like I can't loop the killer more than one time without getting murdered.
---
You're wait times are suspiciously low, but that is the fun nature of the shitty matchmaking system.  My friends and I are seeing double to triple your wait time easily for most games.  We were also factoring in fucking off with the Tier 4 challenges, because the leaked ones were nearly ALL bullshit, not just a couple.  
---
You can sort of help/cheat matchmaking on killer side by staying around 10-8, as it gives you an extremely high range of survivors to play against.  You do mostly get red rank teams, but if your goal is grinding xp for rift, then it helps.   SWF matchmaking time sucks balls though, and we just end up playing another game until we actually get a lobby.
---
Even with just double the amount of time I would consider too much for a casual playing though for 2 hours a day, since most people are unable to play EVERY single day.  7 day week, and 14+ hours between 3-4 sessions is all available game time devoted to a SINGLE game.  Far from casual.

---
Yikes imma be so fit lol
---
Her face though
---
I mean Idk what people expected. Swf got changed so only the highest ranked survivor’s rank is used for matchmaking, so high ranks have Long survivor queues cause now you have 2 mans/ 3 mans/ 4 mans queuing up. I’m guess there is a bug cause low low rank killers shouldn’t be getting reds at all, but low rank survivors who still think this is a horror game are getting steamrolled.
---
I personally have long queues (I know why) but I haven’t faced any killer outside the 6 rank rule
---
I don't think any battlepass is intended to be casual man. I solo queue and thats likely why my queues are so fast, can take any lobby rather then one that requires many open slots. 
---
If anybody can complete the pass by hopping on and playing like two games a day every few days then the pass would be worthless, you literally paid 1000 cells for endless passes, and thats not good business lmao
---
I still haven’t figured out how to turn them in lobby :(
---
Otz has incredible game sense, so he probably knows the odds he's being watched when he places a trap. Even if a Survivor can't see it, if they see you place it they can disarm it.
---
Tying the first Rift to Trapper challenges really opened my eyes to how badly he needs some QoL buffs. More than any trap Killer, he pretty much eats shit if not given time to setup at the start.
---
Try looking up survivor plays on YouTube, there are some that walk you through each kind of loop and how to play them.
---
You can only do it in custom game, not ranked matches.
---
what the fuckity fuck fucky fuck?
---
We need to know. For scientific purposes.
---
I'm new to dbd can someone explain pls. Is make your choice a survivor perk?
---
He sounds like he’s in middle school regurgitating edgy Instagram comments.
---
Lol how did you even spot him up there. I'd never even look there
---
Ignoring afk scenarios, it's annoying if a survivor is still because it can only halt game progression by perpetuating the ability to hide. If a killer is still, they either are choosing to use a stealth ability, waiting for a make your choice proc.
---
In afk scenarios, the game can't tell between the two scenarios, so it allows a killer to be stealthy but denies a survivor from willingly stalling others.
---
Spirit... just play spirit
---
Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, Thanatophobia, Nurse's Calling. Not the build itself but the fact that you run into it like every other match these days.

I'm in red ranks too, and I simply hate it because most killers I encounter here are hardcore tunnelers and campers. Purple ranks are great, red ranks, not so much. It's almost impossible to rank down, too. I keep getting a safety pip and the wait times are simply too long for me to just give up at the beginning of the match

I have been focusing most on playing the survivor challenges, and, while the killer is, of course, supposed to kill us all, I've had a killer straight up DC when he got a 3k and I was escaping with Spine Chill without being hooked. I just barely crossed the escape line, though, so luckily it still counted. Other than that there's been a *lot* of camping and tunneling killers. It's just not very fun.
---
... She's... Seven feet tall, right?
---
Holy shit, yes.
---
While I agree with you, I can also see why they made it this way: they want you to spend ad much  money on their game as possible. Making it so hard to get shards might make someone so frustrated that they'll just say 'fuck it' and buy some auric cells.

---
Definitely looper but a bit too greedy at times which gets me killed. Suppose I should improve that part :D
---
Depends on the system you're playing on, I've been told lobbies for consoles are significantly longer than PC. But the matchmaking system is supposed to be based on rank. So if you've come back from a long break, you're probably rank 20-17 right? That means you're being matched to newer players or people like yourself who've come back after long hiatus, so the number of people in that ranking is smaller than say the large group that plays the game (average rank 14-9 imo but I could be off by a few). Just stick with it through the first long lobbies to bump your rank up to have quicker matchmaking times.

Oh that's probably because it will take too long for details that don't matter, also they're gonna have to make body marks for each unique weapon, since a chainsaw won't leave the same mark as a knife
---
I only meant well 😭
---
Idk why you would want to nerf Demogorgon. He doesn't really have that strong basement game. Sure it's got potential but with the travel time needed between portals and the recovery between actually doing it, he can't really lock it down THAT well, albeit better than most killers still.
---
The basement was just an example, my point was just showing that Trapper being unable to trigger his traps would definitely be a noticeable buff. His traps are already one of the strongest tools for making a loop unusable. While I'm all for the annoying bugs he's been experiencing lately getting patched out, I don't think it's a good idea to make him immune to his own traps.
---
Remember, thats a very. Very small minority

Oxymoron.

I cried enough for both of us, don’t worry 😢
---
I just got to 57 last night. What I suggest is get a 4 man swf (if you don't know or can't get enough to make that happen, go to the dbd discord and join the lfg parts) and do all the survivor missions to get to epilogues first. When you're done with every single survivor one, go to killer. If a killer one seems to hard, just farm.
---
Definitely gotta repost there lmao
---
I was joking but ok
---
Can confirm, the camera flick is a big part of being able to catch survivors which is why you make a trade off when using rusty shackles
---
Not wrong.
---
My hopes and prayers weren’t enough lmao
---
It would be the best, it's just if BHVR wants us to pick those let us at least pick it from some kind of boxes so there would be no need to sprint marathons to get some.
---
(but also I think having all traps on you from the beginning means guaranteed quick death zones which would be kinda evil)
---
I was too but he got done hooking earlier and no BW. Plenty of time for the memes lol
---
Thank you, I am indeed not wrong.

Hopefully they'll think the next set of archives through. *One can only hope.*
---
Is the killer’s Terror Radius a circle or sphere? I.e. on The Game, will I hear the TR if the killer is on the floor below me?
---
Also what is Insidious Bubba? Was this a popular build that became meme or did people use it because it was easy for this killer to chainsaw like 2-3 people in a small space such as the basement?
---
;)
---
Saying "still pipped" against the ones who want to be toxic in the post game chat.
---
How was I wrong? They had their 2 day D/C test. Never claimed it was going to be implemented permanently from the start.
---
 
---
It's moments like these that make me think you're just a lazy troll who says nonsense things to get a rise out of people. Especially since it seems your go-to response is saying "Ad-Hominem, I win" or some variation. 
---
Like , if you're genuinely trying to start discussions in good faith, most of your ideas and posts are just awful.
---
Why is getting a 4k sweaty? You lost, and the killer gets to decide what they do with you. If they give you hatch, is that not sweaty? bc you dont deserve it if it was given to you.
---
Actually they don’t. I live in a completely different state bud lol
---
This happened to me earlier when I had kindred and they could all see no one was coming for me :D
---
Where did I say "I win?"
---
Nice attempt at a stranger though.
---
If you win a game, stop playing for like 20 minutes, then hop back on and repeat until you stop playing with bad killers. You might get tunneled if you have TTV in your name or YT though.
---
Thats just your shitternet.
---
Wise words! Yes, don't forget to be gentle.
---
Decisive Strike is perk that helps a bit with getting tunneled. Other than that it's just bad luck. Only way to avoid it is to play really selfishly, like not going for unhooks, hiding a lot, etc. Don't really recommend doing that though.
---
And my friends? Despite it only happening for a time period last night?
---
Are you telling me you didn't experience it during the same time period?
---
i do this especially when i play ghostface. When someome D/Cs, people kill themselves on hook, or im just winning really hard (2 sacrifices and 4 gens, etc.) i like to help my surivors do gens and let them out. its fun to do it as ghostface. Its no fun winning a super unfair game. i want my children to be happy :)
---
Slides over cars while he shoots, if you get hit you get sent to prison for 7 years like bobby but you can lower the sentence
---
i am convinced the big ol' don don is venting his anger over being put in a peach on the dbd subreddit
---
Tunneling is not an "easy 4k"
---
Use Ds, Killer tunnels you, Get into a locker. 
---
The killer either grabs you, wasting time in chase again, or waste time standing in front of the locker. If 3 other people are doing gens, they should all be around half way done by the time you get caught. and thats a loss for the killer.
---
I suggest slow vaulting out of the locker right before your DS ends to bait the killer to grab you, it works a lot actually.
---
And as pig you can spam ambush to let out lil' piggy growls.
---
Actually makes the game more scary
---
Piggy please
---
Ohh do you mean Im all ears his perk, I use it on Legion. I thought you meant a full tailored build with addons for ghostface
---
It's always the guy with the flashlight that as soon. As you hook them they dc.
---
I’m a legion main and tbh I just do it for the mad points in my deviousness and survivors don’t seem to really care but yeah I’d see how it’s super annoying but once I max out that category I’m done w all the fuck shit and am gonna go for hooks. Legion is easily my favorite killer to farm as and imo the easiest.
---
It’s a sphere. 
---
Insidious bubba refers to bubba using the perk insidious, which removes his terror radius when standing still, usually in the basement. It’s being  talked about more because of the basement challenges in the rift
---
I feel that I'm so bad with it. I should just run with the speed burst and save the pallet but I panic every time..
---
It wasn't like I mounted this huge effort to prove its validity or not, I took a few minutes to see if I could source the study they're talking about.  Probably should have "read the room" better but here we are.
---
I have played against so many hilarious, wholesome ghostfaces. Yesterday I noticed the ghostface we were going against wasn't hooking anyone and was letting people wiggle free and be healed, so I started doing a gen in front of him. Two other survivors joined me, and then the ghostface came up crouched and stood on the remaining side of the gen like he was repairing it too. It made me laugh.
---
it's fine, we can all be a little lost sometimes :)
---
On PS4? Killer sided. On PC? Survivor sided
---
Depends on your playing style. For me definitely lithe. I like to be able to run whenever I want without having to save my sprint burst
---
Yup that’s it no I have yet to even play ghost face because he just doesn’t feel like my killer; plus all I ever seen is him while playing surv so I like to switch it up and not abuse him even if he is good.
---
Poor guy looks like he wants to hide. Probably confused why everyone is taking his picture that day
---
I love calling killers by their names, its really funny to me

If you need a more visual example on how powerful swf is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/db67n9/tbag_exit_gate/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) is my favorite way to explain.
---
I still laugh about their Trump vs Hilary battle. I'm no fan of either of them, but my god did they make Trump a mustache twirling villain in that. Didn't help that Abe slapped Trump twice and told him to sit down and shut up when she won.
---
They tried to defend it by saying "Abe wouldn't have hit a woman", but I don't believe Abe wore aluminum foil in his teeth or flew around on a giant eagle, either.
---
I dunno, like I said I'm not a fan of either trump or hilary, but if they can't keep their own bias out of the battle, they probably shouldn't do current elections.
---
Right. It's not because "china". 
---
You went from "Didn't they say" to "I made that up". There's never been any model damage in the game. Demogorgon doesn't decapitate because there isn't any model damage.
---
Another note, it looks like the merchants split skill is hanging on his belt as well, the lower jaw of one of the sides even has physics.
---
No I mean on PS4 99% of all Survivors are dumber then a bag of rocks. You basically are on your own
---
Yeah those are the players I hate since they don’t get anything done
---
I get that part, but why specifically Bubba? Why not insidious Hillbilly or insidious Trapper? Is is because of his power or people just noticed it was him specifically
---
Wh. What how
---
I'm just a curious person, so I wanted to find the source of the study being used in the article.  I couldn't find one in the handful of minutes I took to look for it and moved on.  This is probably one of those moments that was likely best kept to myself.
---
Aren't there ranks though?
---
My pasta is dry...
---
What’s with this “booping” the “snoot” of this character? It is so cringe. I hate seeing this on every other post
---
You even brought small game, how’d you fuck it up that bad
---
You set two traps kinda close to each other and step into one of them, the other one goes under you for some reason and since he resets the traps he steps in he gets caught in the other while resetting the first and it's an endless cycle unless you get lucky and can swing out of it or a survivor comes and helps
---
It smells your perks
---
Wait, is there in-game music other than the chase music? Is that what you're referring to?
---
True.
---
bruh.....
---
Feels bad, it’s agonising whenever that happens to me
---
Yeah but either you get put in with people who are way lower rank or you have what seems like people just being absolutely stupid
---
Whem was the last time you played?
---
His power is the best for camping because it can down multiple survivors instantly, which no other killer power can do. If a bubba stays revved in front of a hooked survivor, it’s essentially impossible to save them, way more so than other killers
---
hang on. 
---
"Survivor and killer is super laggy. killer is unplayable on pc *RN*"
---
"Despite it only happening for for a time period last night"
---
Somthing is not adding up.
---
I really love being able to plug headphones into PS4 controllers
---
Interesting! I've always farmed with Doctor and have looked for a reason to drag Legion off the bench. Doc is annoying for survivors, but doesn't feel that great to _play_ sometimes.
---
Wasn't paying attention. Just wanted my 2nd escape of the week. Sadly it didn't happen
---
Clown
---
Seeing this makes me happy you got out :) had a game just like this but I was Nancy and I barely escaped!thats awesome I do blame teammates aswell for not helpin you I'd be the same and just leave lol
---
Sloppy, Franklin's, anything that causes a status really, hell even Freddy putting you to sleep causes you to lose frames, and usually end up with me running into something. Though on the flip side it also happens to me whenever I get bloodlust as killer, which ALWAYS seems to be right when I go for a hit, and then I miss due to frames dropping and the survivor blips out of existance. Honestly my biggest complaint about the console version
---
Christmas is in two days, dude.
---
Kinda early, don't you think?
---
Either you're a troll or just unperceptive.
---
My comment first was made 15 hours ago. Idk what time zone you're in, but it was evening for me.
---
Why not just have spotify on in the background? And lower the in game volume a bit? I mean, that’s what I do on PS4 anyway.
---
“Monstrous shrine? The only thing monstrous here is your choice in perks!” 
---
“Mindbreaker?! You’re breaking MY mind by even considering taking that!” 
---
“Zanshin Tactics? Those *tactics* won’t be enough to secure you even one sacrifice!”
---
Pretty!
---
Lithe if you are looking for a easy great perk.
---
But SB is simply the best exhaust perk in the game BY FAR. 
---
you have to baby sit SB a shit ton, and learn a lot of strats to use it to its full potential. but if you do, its unmatched in strength
---
He wanted yall to slug race and you started early, not surprised he threw you on a hook.
---
this is to good
---
An hour ago
---
Yep, you only wont get splinters anymore after you own all the licensed killers that have splinters.
---
Lol this is me before I realized the sound is VERY important on killer/survivor.
---
It's a bug that he probably thought was a freak accident. He was likely trying to get it to stop not expecting it to happen again. It isnt his fault the game decided they all needed to be carried indefinitely.
---
I don’t play killers I don’t like to go against; that’s kinda my only #1 rule I follow always in this game because I don’t like to be hypocritical especially about that. I don’t play Spirit, Doctor, Ghostface and billy because I think it would honestly just be too easy to win.
---
 Just my opinion and ideology on it but I really wish these killers were more balanced so I’d feel like I’m actually winning when I play as them and not like it was just given to me cause they’re op. Spirit I have yet to see or play as since her nerf so maybe I’ll try her out for a bit.
---
He's the killer.
---
Camping is a strategy, it can bait survivors into going for the saves thus leading to their demise.
---
When I tested the DC bans they went up to six hours before I stopped.
---
did you stun the killer with the pallet in a chase &gt; if yes then it counts.
---
It likely just didn't update my guy or you counted wrong.
---
Dead hard
---
Looter while hiding in a closet because of head on
---
Same I do that while playing killer lol.
---
I've had many deaths learning killer sign language lol. You do something they dont like and theyll kill you, you follow what they're gesturing for and you live
---
Sorry, but what is swf
---
They have and it’s very possible for a ban to occur
---
Happens for killer as well, you can get a 4k with no gens done and still depip
---
Solo survivor &lt; Killer = hybrid solo/SWF lobby &lt; 4 man SWF
---
Obviously there are variables as to the quality of players, who the killer is, is there a mori, etc...so this is just an in general thing.
---
Have you come back after a long time not playing?
---
definitely didn't count wrong. i've been hearing about this happening to other people as well.
---
as for "didn't update" what does this mean? that it just didn't work? if that's the case that means that it's completely bugged
---
Can someone explain this matchmaking please? [https://imgur.com/RzXTc6n](https://imgur.com/RzXTc6n) 
---
Yes, this was a solo queue.
---
Well the gen was almost done as the last guy got moried and he thought he would have been dead  anyways but the demo was blind as fuck so yeah :D
---
^this
---
Wish it didnt take 5min to open playstation menu so I could check if anyone was working on something like this.
---
My life is the proof of this.
---
It's a good way to farm bloodpoints though..
---
I'll definitely look into those, thank you for taking the time to reply :)
---
I don’t know about rancor, but you’ll still light up when legion is in feral frenzy
---
Lies ! Deception !
---
It’s not “completely” bugged but almost all of the challenges have moments were they don’t recognize you got it done and it didn’t count. Try it again I’m sure it’ll work but yeah that’s pretty frustrating I have yet to do that one yet and if it bugs out on be when I do I’ll be pretty cheesed too.
---
Could use some sauce.
---
For Feral Frenzy, yes. I get many grabs on people who try to locker tech me. 
---
Rancor is location reveal so lockers block that.
---
SCP 173
---
Neat, can you do a version for us killer mains?
---
Lots of people do it in this game. I play for fun, not wins and playing in higher ranks isn't fun anymore. Highest rank I made it to was rank 8, going up against red rank survivers and I wasn't having any fun. There's no reason to be rude to someone because you don't agree with. Everyone plays games different because they have different preferences.
---
Should have just dropped him if he knew he wouldn't make it.
---
I always BOOP the snoot but pig always kills me :/
---
Never made it to red rank as a killer. I play for fun, not wins and playing against red rank survivor isn't fun so I don't try and go any higher than that.
---
Oh, that makes sense since I don't have Freddy :/ oh well
---
Yeah I'm really lucky that I got good ears because I'm blind as fuck and hearing the survivors breathe saved my blind ass so many times
---
What a beautiful cosmetic
---
It's built very similar to Fractured Cowshed. Safety everywhere, all connected in a perfect square

I'm immersed (and the only one who seems to know how to act appropriately)
---
I can’t tell you how many swings I’ve missed due to getting bloodlust right as I swing and my frames drop to 2 FPS
---
Man, my eyes tear right now. Dont torture me, man.
---
Licensed music would be nice, like strike a deal with Spotify so killers can pick their own terror radius music. Imagine Hillbilly sprinting by to "Cotton-eye Joe".
---
The killer gets a sound notification every time you sprint while vaulting or sprint while getting into a locker, it's not linked to a perk. People like to abuse it as either a distraction or to make fun of the killer for not getting kills. Booty dancing is less of an issue, some killers think it's funny and some don't. I'd try to avoid vault spamming tho. It doesn't really add anything other than annoying noises to the game, at least on the killers side.
---
I’m in a DBD Facebook group where a guy tried to start a thread for sharing your playlists during the game. The entire thread was just people roasting him.
---
YEEEEESSSSSSSS
---
I really want the Hoffman RBT as a skin ngl
---
Please go be a cool, adult man somewhere else
---
The spawns are garbage, but at least Demo can blend a bit with the snow.
---
The cherry on top of that was the Meg that ran past holding a flashlight while Myers was picking her up.
---
Nope, just gonna keep running.
---
I’m the totem cleanser.
---
That's also why I mentioned if you've got higher rank friends, try to get closer to their rank before really jumping into sfw with them, I don't doubt it wasn't fun for you and the killer was probably really confused by the time everyone got to the scoreboard.
---
ace doing that stupid dance is my favorite thing ive seen this decade unironically and i want more
---
a full rework? legion needs it the most. but just a straight buff with no to minimal changes would go to leatherface

This is why I don’t play lol. I love trapper but when I get stuck in a loop while the 4 man is gen rushing I’m not having a good time

Honorable mention to Paulie and Monto.

Did you actually read the post? Their problem is the fact that the game often desyncs when trying to perform a grab
---
Weird they haven't taken advantage of turning her rbt into a death mask from II &amp; III or a bucket helmet from jigsaw (maybe they don't have the rights to change the bear trap)
---
Impossible Skillcheck Doc as you mentioned. But with a Jigsaw Piece.
---
His stalk is broken in the mechanical sense. Every since dedicated servers it will sometimes regress while you are stalking, activate too early, and just simply not stalk people.
---
Ghostface has similar issues.
---
Coming right up I’ll reply with the link when I make it
---
I'm guessing this was low rank due to the camping Hag and your teammates all just dipping straight for the exit 😂😂😂
---
spine chill op
---
It's impossible. I've given up on it. Every time they either run to the corner of the map or DC.
---
luckily i have! mainly lots of rest to make up for the lack of sleep during finals lmao! 
---
i hope you have been doing some self-care as well! you deserve it! ♡
---
Actually no, it can happen with just 1 trap. When he resets it for his animation, he is still standing on it, and he doesn't get the temporary immunity like he used to, so it just keeps trapping him every time he resets it.
---
Wish I could remember totem spots, but I can't even remember where the last gen or exit gate was that I saw like 5 seconds ago xD
---
But they adjusted it, right? Compared to the previous leaks? So tome 3 is now harder?
---
Is there Crossplay between PS and Switch?
---
I did it with hag on meat factory, hag is really good with it just because she can leave basement but still have it guarded with traps.
---
That’s because on her screen he wasn’t behind her. To her he just magically appeared out of nowhere and did an instant grab, probably didn’t even think anything about it because that happens constantly vs ghostface. That stealthy fucker.
---
Night Trap - 
---
Killer = Auger
---
Survivor = Kelly
---
Map = the House
---
The original creator of this series actually does make it seems like there is a casual life between survivor and killers outside trials. Some include making a Starbucks in the fog where everyone can chill together, it's hilarious. Others include killers destroying lockers and Feng telling the trapper, who then fixes it and scolds the killers that did it. Interactions between Michael and Laurie is the best. Check OPs comment history for the source. It's only in Japanese but you can still get enjoyment out of inferring what's happening through the drawings.
---
Adding something to point A:
---
Its ultimately a reflex of bad game design. Your objective is to kill, period. You should never change your playstyle because of a bad decision of devs (of not allowing the hooked surv to refuse the save).
---
Just kill him.
---
🎵Night trap watch out behind you night trap!🎵
---
Time to only use tier 2 diliverence
---
cow leg is cool but it takes up a third of your screen and the flies are distracting
---
He's a shit tier killer now. His power is worse than just M1ing at loops.
---
LMAO
---
But... It's... It's not that simple dude. What the people made on the internet is only useful as a concept. With the way the distance based audio works for terror radius the tracks would have to be made in a specific way. 
---
They've given demo and oni their own chase music so it's reasonable to assume this is a new trend they will be sticking with. People keep whining about giving killers their own chase music when that's what theyve been doing so far.
---
Oh I’m not saying the killer is a dick for downing again I’m saying the survivor is a dick for doing an unsafe hook.  Yes though it would be nice if the devs added a feature to refuse unhook.
---
I've been saying this for ages.
---
Fix the emblem and bloodpoint system which forces you to compete with your teammates for the limited points in any given match instead of working with your teammates to escape. Maxing out on objectives early discourages you from continuing working on generators even if your team needs you to because you already have iridescent Lightbringer and won't get any more bloodpoints (unless you count the 5k for escaping); I'd rather work on altruism, totems, or chases in this case. Imagine running the killer for 5 gens and only safety pipping.
---
Either raise the bar for red ranks, or create at least 3 more ranks. Like black, gold, and iridescent ranks.
---
Add rewards for rank to discourage depipping, and that will also give you a purpose for resetting ranks every month (which is currently used as a bandaid for the terrible ranking system).
---
If no rewards are given, rank is just used as MMR. MMR/rank should then be hidden so people will focus more on playing the game for fun instead of complaining about pips/rank. And in this case, the hidden MMR should not be capped like the current rank 1 is. Adjustments should be made to the matchmaking algorithm to speed up queue times, and resetting MMR every month is not necessary.
---
*surprised pikachu* 😦
---
Each and every time I get camped by a ghost face.
---
No fun zone!!!
---
From what I saw in the past 2 weeks I encountered some farmers, but they always farmed with everyone so maybe it's only your region thing
---
Seems as tho you're just really unlucky. The recent addition of the Tomes may have killers acting a little wacky and starting to farm, but this should not be an ongoing problem.
---
When the killer gets close the terror radius music gets slowly more intense. The fan made tracks were created to imitate that however for the game there are likely separate tracks of increasingly intense music which get layered on top of each other. You couldn't just stick the music the people made and stick it in the files because they're made differently.
---
Yeah I know I was talking specifically about sabotage
---
Legion's power sucks more ass than people at a gay beach party
---
I'll be honest, the best way of handling it is to down the unhooked survivor, and then go after the person that unhooked. Make them trade hooks and pull extra people off gens to try and pick up downed survivors.
---
taking a hit at the exit might have been enough.
---
He’s beyond underpowered. His only power is making the game take longer and that’s not even an advantage because eventually games take so long that I don’t even wanna be in the match anymore. I like his design and the idea that you can play as all 4 members but power wise, he needs another rework
---
Again, ask those people if they want to provide samples of specified format? They already made the music of that quality out of sheer enthusiasm so at least they're definitely capable of composing it further so it could click in place
---
There's variables but its very easy to win as survivor if all the survivors are competent and there's no ruin. Maybe guaranteed if you're competent and in a SWF. Sometimes as killer you have to just rely on the survivors sucking to get kills
---
certain oppressive killers like a good Spirit or Nurse, Stealth killers with a nurse's calling/sloppy butcher/thanataphobia/ruin build, killers with overpowered addons, moris etc. can be unbeatable but again it's all dependent on different variables
---
I do this 80% of the time just have one ear bud out so I can still here a little

For pure entertainment and fun, Noob3, FarmerJohn. For skillful gameplay, ScottJund, Tru3talent, Not Otzdarva. For both, ZubatLEL. This is my opinion no bully plz
---
Are you low rank? Almost no one camps in red and purple ranks in my experience.
---
If you’re not having fun, feel free to leave.
---
weird flex but ok
---
Complaining about a high tier perk at low rank when the unlocking of perks happens due to BP spending, which is leveling.sure I’m rank 18 after coming back to the game and playing maybe three matches per month this last year, doesn’t change that I have multiple level 50 killers with great perks from all of them.
---
Clown hands down. His power is underwhelming and needs to be reworked or buffed or something. His pick rate is incredibly low, and when you do play against him you either bully him into submission or he has Redhead's Pinky Finger and he bullies you. 
---
After Clown I think they should look at Plague. The idea behind her power is interesting, but in practice or at least the way it's implemented it isn't very engaging. Either survivors don't cleanse and are forever coughing and one shot, or they do cleanse and give Plague a ridiculously powerful projectile attack. Either way it's not very fun for the survivors, and if they don't cleanse it causes the game to be way less fun for the killer. Plague's power needs to be reworked so it's less frustrating to play against.
---
Besides that I think everyone else is in a pretty good spot right now. Pig's add-ons could be reworked to be more useful or gameplay altering, and whoever still doesn't have standardized add-ons (2 pink, 4 purple, 5 green, 5 yellow, 4 brown) should get their add-ons looked at too. I know Oni still needs tweaking. He's still pathetic on console, and I know the latest patch nerfed him significantly on PC. I'm sure little tweaks or buffs/nerfs could be applied to everyone, but besides what I already said not much else comes to mind that glaringly needs adjustment.
---
I did it with bubba, Monstrous Shrine, Iron Grasp  Agitation and Mad Grit.
---
 Locate basement and guard the 3 gens close to it and good luck
---
How do you know that?
---
Wraith, I think it's the one that looks like a stage performer since I have it and remember seeing a beating heart the one time I played Wraith
---
Gl finding another survivor on a farm or mothers dwelling xD
---
Toxic
---
Le fuc?
---
Its Always fun time in basement when u go against bubba
---
Lol not really a flex but more on how a two main SWF could really screw over the rest of the team
---
I have issues finding them on The Game and Hawkins Lab, but the others are all usually in one of three spots haha.
---
This is genius lol. I'd want to hunt people to Britney Spears music.
---
Low effort ultra repost, with a side of /r/fellowkids in the title
---
Or just impliment it for both. The game is likely never going to be balanced, the Devs proved that by making ranking as a survivor super easy so rank 1 is filled with potatoes to balance out the good players so just do it and who cares. It's not like the game would change, it's information killers should already have. I wouldn't use it because I like the ambience of dbd, but I also wouldn't care if im going against someone 'abusing' it either since chases are so damn simple. It's the same with colourblind mode as well, people already abuse windows colour filters to see bloodtrails and blendettes, who cares at this point it's not really an advantage. Well, except against blendettes.
---
The bottom part is attack on titan but i have no idea what the top is. I wanna know too lol
---
Cheers.
---
1. Because I own and have played him.
---
2. Because the majority of the community agrees that Legion is underpowered as fuck.
---
3. Logic.
---
Bruh moment
---
Dive off straight into my mori
---
Iron Grasp, Agitation. I finally got it. I didn't hook most of them in the basement until their last hook. I knew I had a chance when I had 2 down with 3 gens left. One prick kept running across the map so it took me way longer than it should have. Last time I tried bringing him, I knew I wasn't going to make it, so I dropped it and picked up the slugged Feng, she was right on top of the hatch in the killer shack where the basement was. I just picked her up, hooked her, went back up to close the hatch. Saw the last prick through the wood, knocked him down, picked him up, hooked him, hit him on the hook twice and closed the hatch. That guy earned himself a lifetime supply of Mori's.
---
What does the new prayer beads do? I don't understand the way the new rework works
---
lol you just stole this from the sub and posted it again
---
Impossible
---

---
Indeed
---
Updating this everyday maximum
---
Pig, Clown, Legion, Leatherface are the 4 that i find the least reliable and most frustrating to play as
---
His traps can be disarmed which would be the equivalent of those things you mentioned, but they can also be sabotaged so he can't go back and reset them for a while
---
serious lol. better then whispers. especially as a stealth killer like GF
---
Hellraiser - Pinhead 
---
Make other Cenobites flash and appear like the current doctors madness level increase.  
---
Attacks with telekinetic chains with hooks.
---
Puzzle box music as he draws near.
---
Mori has multiple chains ripping victim apart.
---
I mean yeah, you're right actually. In the end they all kill and have to play by the entity's rules whether they like it or not, but they're not all just about killing. Doc for example doesn't want to kill, just to, er, experiment on his subjects. The Spirit doesn't want to kill innocent teenagers, only her dad. Bubba just obeys, but he most likely isn't exactly killing for the joy of it.
---
Literally my reaction ngl. Someone times his deadhard perfectly and outplays me hard with it? ''HOLY SHIT NICE DEADHARD MAN''
---
Just give him immunity to his traps already. I never understood why does the Trapper gets trapped by his own traps. The only killer in the game whose power can actively hurt him for no apparent reason.
---
Imagine it saying exposed right after you unhook your teammate, and then they get hit a minute later.
---
New legion buff? High ground!
---
God I fucking hope so. Just let me be free.
---
If the 20 is squaded up, then it is.
---
Yes on both. The only things lockers block are true aura reading abilities, like bbq or bittur murmur. Legions ability is unique, and rancor doesnt show auras-it just uses a location bubble, similar to a scream notification(something which also is not blocked by lockers btw)
---
How do you do this thing where it appears where the image was posted in Reddit? I've been seeing it more and more lately.
---
Yui gets a new set a month after release meanwhile Adam had to wait 3 months for his first set. u/BaeTier
---
Who you callin Pinhead?
---
boop!!!
---
He should just start with them all. If Pig can, why can’t he?
---
In early game, having 3 gens blocked is pretty good though, and depending on the can force survivors towards you, rather than you going to them.
---
Just bind it to middle mouse scroll down and spin the wheel.
---
I'd say it does
---
No but I want to try that now.
---
Then politely asks you to step into one of those iron door traps
---
Why live if you're not getting swole at same time?
---
Very much depends on your console, location, and role. For example, killer queues on PS4 are extremely short compared to survivor queues.
---
&gt; *Good info [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqpGXoLSDNEUrBfACKnAhVA/search?query=loop). There's also a lot of general guides in our main thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d5elu7/guides_resources_for_new_players/).*

It's not going to die if you play and talk about it, that's for sure. Just move on, the game is gonna kill itself

BHVR is possibly the most incompetent developer company to grace this plane of existence

Why does BHVR patch things the community likes in a couple of weeks but then it takes YEARS to patch actual issues in the game
---
Holy shit,I just thought billy was there to make the original 3.
---
You can turn that off
---
Or horrible lag.
---
did he use custom icons ore some of that things? sweetfx/reshade?
---
That's cute. So random players you don't know are supposed to trust your opinion based on "Good, bad, meh, Terrible"?
---
None of that matters to what I’m saying though. I under what you’re saying, it’s just irrelevant to what my point is.
---
It’s incredibly difficult for new players to have a modicum of fun against Rank 18 killers that have all tier 3 very rare perks.
---
I walk slow but still have depression
---
True. But balance-wise Pig needs conditions to set those. Not that I'm exactly arguing against it mind you

Fair enough. The point that Trapper is a territorial killer to me is still reason enough to give him all his traps. Or at least make them spawn closer.
---
The heart belongs to the nurse due to the hole in her chest
---
New player? Go for Lithe
---
Sounds like someone wanted to keep your attention. Keep an eye out for obvious bait.
---
Hags that love to guard their hexes like losing ruin is life or death. One time I got to the ruin before the hag could place a trap at the beginning of a game and they DCed immediately after.
---
Definitely
---
So the sweaty nerds who play optimally wont lose any weight...
---
I see Obi Wan has taught Susie well
---
I'm not sure I like how that sounds. What do you think of each survivor perk?
---
you could do all of these while in game and still 4 man escape
---
Problem is I need a way to keep track of this shit during game, I can’t just drop it and do the workout mid game yknow
---
Because her power is basically a one hit down anyways. I think the only correct time to cleanse is end game when she doesn't really have the time to go get her power.
---
I don't use either but I prefer lithe because I sprint to much out of chase
---
This is new, never seen this type of post before. It's not oversaturation content in the slightest.
---
Spinning the killer still works for me on Xbox
---
there are no confirmed bans for custom icons yet and I don't think they'd be the issue
---
You, sir, are a true hero.
---
This is fake. Impossible to have more than 1 on a bloodweb. I rarely see one in general nowadays
---
That’s actually really creepy, what the fuck. We need more stuff like this in DBD
---
not patched, still can do it only in custom
---
ormond? try oni's map. its literally impossible for me to keep a chase cuz the entire map is tall grass and i can't see shit cuz i play on a laptop so my monitor is small
---
He does not as far as I know.
---
Now the killer drops them so it actually makes it worse for the team
---
Like u/SomeoneJustLied said. But also, if someone cleanses at a bad time; meaning when there is still more then 1 gen left to be done, or if you let the last few gens be close to each other, then it makes it easy for the killer to patrol that area with a ranged ability that damages you from far distances. Making it extremely easy for her to win if she knows what shes doing. Its easily the most OP ability that any killer has, but she only gets it very late game, or if some idiot screws the team early. Thus making it pretty balanced in my opinion.
---
I agree but at least we get the opportunity to get the non licensed killers and perks
---
Calm Spirit, Iron Will, Lightweight, Quick n Quiet.
---
DC = 30 seconds Chair
---
I got it, fwiw.
---
In that case its definitely justified
---
Dude I've been doing this for like a month and it doesn't help at all. It's also really annoying because I only play killer. Any tips?
---
Epic watermark
---
 If you just tap, you'll never get better at skill checks so you can actually go full gens hitting greats.
---
!remindme 48 hours
---
This is a really neat idea. Need something for the opening load screen though, because that takes forever and would really add up.
---
Okay Bc he messaged me after saying that I was a noob tunneled. Like it’s his fault for bagging. If he would’ve been not toxic like normal people he probably would’ve gotten away with the other three
---
Also guys that new sword is brutal
---
BOOP DA SNOOT
---
i got two once and it was a genuine "gasp, hands on face" moment
---
Oh, alright
---
i am probably the most anti d/c person ever. like imo d/cing is the most toxic thing someone can do in game, but i will just d/c the moment i see its that map. I'm not gonna play a game when i already know its gonna be a 4 man escape with maybe 2 hooks
---
What does farm a team mate and killer gets 4K mean? I play this game everyday but I’m not as quaint on the lingo ‘round here.

Don’t you mean jumping jacks for the hooked
---
Idk what these normies in the comments are talking about. I haven’t seen this meme til now
---
Farming a teammate = saving them off hook/off the ground and they immediately go down again
---
4K = 4 kills
---
Ahh okay thanks
---
I wish I could tell you how many times my ankles have been brankled by a trap when I was literally a meter from it
---
Yeah I don’t know why I got downvoted. When I’ve got someone on the hook and another Survivor has done this move and is just crouching behind them what else should I do, walk away? 
---
I physically cannot hit them without it aiming onto the hooked Survivor enabling them to get a free unhook.
---
I hate you
---
*The Final Gen Pings* Me: why is there boss music?
---
I don’t think these are unpopular but more of people just being assholes in the endgame lobby cause they lost or died
---
I’ve always wondered how it would be if Trapper’s traps were armed from the beginning of the match. Would that be overly powerful?
---
Distortion can tell you if it's Black Incense with certainty.
---
i think she is cute, but the people who play her suck dick
---
Tier 1 Micheal gang rise up.
---
My go to stealth build is:
---
Iron Will keeps you quiet when injured and will make you really hard to find.
---
Spine Chill to give an earlier warning when the killer is headed your direction and to counter small terror radius/stealth.
---
Quick and Quiet gives you more options for hiding and moving quicker.
---
Urban Evasion can make you almost invisible if you learn how to use it. Any small object becomes a perfect hiding place and the additional speed means you can moving out of the killers sight while they're trying to check the area.
---
You can try other things for personal preference, the only perk I would say is an absolute must is Iron Will.
---
Fuck ghostface and his bullshit wonky reveal mechanic. Never once has a GF exposed me in a fair manner lmao - GF mains are soyboys

What do you mean by that? The last one was pretty nice imo.

Not unpopular, some survivors are just really noisy salt piles.
---
i dont like her voice, she needs to be kate'd.
---
Because you have loop potential. When you cleanse she can just down you way faster and multiple people at once. As a rule of thing you should only cleanse when the game is just going so bad it can’t hurt you but help.
---
what? she's extremely popular
---
When they escape it's even worse because they got a sense of overconfidence carrying them
---
&gt;hey look... someone complaining about not healing. Because being broken the entire game is better than someone having to stop going for gens and chasing people entirely to get a temporary ability... 
---
Hey look, someone complaining about not breaking line of sight from myers. Because getting off the gen is better than someone slowing down to a snails pace and loosing all gen pressure to get a temporary ability...
---
Thanks bro.
---
She's a cool design and I like her style, but her perks are ass.
---
Like, word, but I should have gotten it 6 times now, and 1 always DC's after going down
---
How is getting trapped and having another player have a game breaking bug smart?
---
I heard the servers can be worse
---
Gotta upvote a meme from a buddy!

are you sure you're perceiving what's happening correctly? I can only think of a couple times I suspected this in all my time playing

Pray to the entity basically. It's stupidly difficult.

One is a bug and the other is a gameplay decision.

HI JOHN
---
I like the charecter a lot just got her p3 this week and been trying to get all the perks on her she’s pretty much my new survivor main
---
Oh no I don’t camp. That’s boring. It’s just if I caught someone saving him. I purely went for him

Okay buy if you say the N word if youre raging your probably a piece of shit

Y'all just mad cause Ormond is the closest thing to a nerf they could give to Claudette

Same
---
I get a lot of usage out of By Any Means. But there are few red rank or even purple rank killers on PS4 so I play with a lot of green and yellows who never break pallets
---
Your username... it concerns me.
---
Oh shit sorry,
---
Just briefly saw both post and jumped to conclusions
---
r/StabbyGang
---
The only times they weren’t complaining were when Steve showed up, the divorce scene, and the Hookers meeting. Rewatch it and count how much they complain about at least one thing in each scene.
---
She's one of my favored survivors alongside Ace/Jane
---
Looter is literally me also when not doing challenges, teammates appreciate my efforts in getting out

Cool idea, does the Crow Storm act similar to Doctor in treatment mode?I don't really get it.
---
His secondary power is a bit like the doctor, yeah. He can drop a crow that is visually different than the other crows in that it has red feathers rather than black ones. Furthermore, walking or running past this crow will make reveal the survivor's aura to the Scarecrow for a few seconds. However, crouch-walking past it won't alert it. 
---
For his primary power though, the main thing the Scarecrow can do is blind and interrupt survivors during chases, or out of them too. He unleashes a straight line of flying crows in front of him, similar to how the plague vomits. Any survivor caught in this line of fire will find it hard to see due to all the crows swarming them. Additionally, when in the line of flying crows, they won't be able to use any items such as flashlights and medkits, or even do anything at all besides run and drop pallets. 
---
Does that make more sense?
---
Yeah. There's too much seasoning on some of those survivors.
---
Hey I've been playing for years and some days I feel that bad.,😁
---
Demo has 5 fps on consoles bruh.
---
They were mostly solid but I was very dissapointed in your Self Care grade.  Good?  Come on "Meh" would be being generous in regards to Self Care that perks trash at this point in the games meta.  Waste of time.

Megalovania for when an edgy teen is tryna stab your gullet
---
I find that "Take Me On" is pretty inspiring. "Rip and Tear" from Doom 2018 will really get your blood pumping. Also, the Oni's theme is just freaking badass (not his terror radius, which is also okay, but his menu theme). "We can dance" is also a good one, so is "American Boy." 
---
Not that I would listen to songs while you're playing, tho.
---
Im not sure if it was a depip or a safe pip now that I remember, but I think it happened to some users
---
Penny wise = killer   Eddie = survivor and killers power should be like doctors but with fear since penny likes to make them scared before eating them

We all remember how much the basement was used in the basement bug.
---
Personally i never have a problem dealing with Oni as survivor. I also have found that as killer i get stomped on often while playing as him. Its really hard to aim his attacks on controller.
---
Imagine actually saying that.
---
Giant asterix if the fucker's camping. Camping seems to be making a comeback, at least on PS4.
---
Yeah I'm 99% sure that if you 4k you're guaranteed a safety pip. It's impossible to depip with a 4k, except if survivors dc.
---
Yeah I don't react well to losses sometimes. Even though it's rare for me to escape, still haven't gotten used to dying so much
---
A lot of these are like that. A bunch of eye catching headlines people tag their friends in on Facebook.

Lol, read someone else's comment and then accidentally replied to you. Soory.

I’m glad you asked because I also didn’t get the joke. I thought it was another anime reference that went over my head.

You need more upvotes for this.
---
What skin is this?
---
That has nothing to do with this.
---
Thank you for the tip 😊
---
I can’t help but think the face being on that end would only create drag/resistance when swinging, gotta put it on the sidddee
---
I want whatever you people are sipping because BHVR is far from the most incompetent developer company.
---
That makes sense
---
The new one for Oni that came out today, you’ll see it on his tab, especially since he doesn’t have many skins of that rarity anyway.
---
Legit I started doing push ups during loading screens in October. 
---
I can see small results. 
---
Two weeks ago I switched it to while in queue. 
---
I’m exhausted and dread DBD now.
---
Especially when they click a flashlight as you begin to walk off
---
I'm not saying that I exclusively tap or that it's the best strategy. Dbd is a game full of imbalance and toxicity and considering I run Inner Strength I'm often on the Hex: Ruin hunt asap.
---
That said, not everyone cares about expediting improvement in a casual game. I get purple and red rank teammates that have absolute garbage movement and camera control because 99% of the time they hide at the first sign of terror radius, and I end up having to loop the killer for half the match.
---
What I'm getting at is there are different approaches and styles to the game, and from my experience people can somehow get to red ranks even though they are fundamentally trash at the game. I get that tapping can be considered an exploit, but that's not my problem when the low iq devs can literally open the code and add a conditional to detect and prevent it. God forbid they add another conditional where you don't get hit on half of your pallet stuns. The game is poorly optimized with hit boxes and netcode and I'm not trying to red herring off of your original point here. I have consumed a lot of DBD content to try to improve, but the fact of the matter is that most people aren't taking the game seriously enough to give a fuck about hitting all great skill checks.
---
i just run spine chill and accept my fate if that doesnt help me. this game is so fun when youre hyped up on music.
---
Still hate it
---
People be downvoting you, but Darth Vader is totally a slasher villain. Don’t know how well he would actually fit, but I would love a mod or something that let’s you play as Vader
---
What is that line from I forgot.
---
Yeah but what's I called as I'm not on my.computer atm to check
---
This 100 times.  Can’t begin to count the games as killer where 3 survivors will have green connection and 1 will have red, they don’t leave and blame my internet when everyone else is connecting just fine.
---
Imagine saying this.
---

You already know it’s time for the gay joke. 🏳️‍🌈
---
Run Decisive Strike every game until you're at least purple rank I'd say.  Potato ranks tunnel their balls off because they don't know any better yet.  Iron Will is nice too because even if they try to tunnel you they might not even be able to find you to do it since you're silent.
---
Imagine working hard to get a perk to work and actually being rewarded with the kills instead of pussy  babies dcing.
---
Play with your food stacks is just the stages of depression
---
Okay sure luck was heavily involved with Steves escape but you can congratulate him on his escape regardless of luck (he did his best with what he had).
---
But my comment was focusing more on the hags play style and not what Steve should have done. She face camped because she was most likely a new killer and didn’t know what else to do.
---
BHVR needs to get on this. The game is unplayable without this playing as Adrenaline activates
---
Doing this since weeks. No I didn't gain  muscles at all. Stupid work out!
---
Sincerely, a Trapper

If my teammates actually know how to find gens. I’m more than happy to be the looper. If my teammates are running around like headless chickens and don’t have a single gen in the first 5 mins, I end up immersed.

Pretty much eh. When she picked up Steve she just started chasing the other survivors 😆
---
Definitely a new killer. Kinda find it adorable 😆
---
You tellin me that this entire time I’ve been the bravest of them all
---
this format is so awesome for scrolling down
---
He is very fun but if you are a red rank killer you will not do good most games. However there is a high chance even if they do all 5 gens you can get a few kills with slugging
---
One thousandth upvote, very proud
---
There aren’t enough red rank killers around. Red rank survivors wait for so long, they take any killer they are in range of
---
You get harder matches but you also get much quicker queues

i had one guy accuse me of lag switching and that my internet is trash and he was the only one lagging all over the place. lol!

I know how you feel, i remember the first time i got iron maiden tier 3 as well /s
---
First question, being bothered by balanced landing as killer is stupid given recent nerf, ds on the other hand, is basically a forcefield that lasts for 1 minute and lets you do bold plays infront of the killer without punishment so killers are bound to be bothered by it
---
And secondly ruin is the best slowdown perk in the game plain and simple no other perk gets people off gens or slow their progres the way ruin does, but some killers get more use out of it than others, good Billys Nurses dont need ruin at all, otz video of strong builds without ruin is a great example of how killers can play without it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqmhg\_XXjwM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqmhg_XXjwM), bottom line is, the better the player you are the less you have to rely on ruin to apply pressure

Nothing special. Some people literally message every match asking to farm.

Make sure you quote the same thing to killer players.

Lol. Hag can set an infinite amount of traps at any time with a click of a button. Trapper has to collect then carefully set each trap.

Yeah that's fair, but all I'm saying is tapping does not prob de improvement. So what if most of the player base is trash, at least you can try to get better.
