What do you mean? What's the wrong spots
---
---
---
Didn't get the "kill yourself" message but I certainly got the "you didn't save me. delete your game fucker" message in my very first game. I was honestly too terrified of the heartbeat in the game to even know what was going on, let alone understand I had responsibilities to other players.
---
The traps only detonate if someone walks nearby without crouching, so the counter is to notice the traps and slowly approach, followed by slowing crouching away until you've left their aoe. This makes the Nea perk Urban Evasion(crouch at full walk speed) extremely useful if you happen to be running it.

Hello lovely folks who want to help DbD science! The chest statistics experiment is going strong! I recently spent 3 hours with friends on KYF and all I got was this ~~lousy t-shirt~~ 220 screenshots, which together with the ones I collected last week and the ones some of you have sent me, means I now have almost 300 non-Plunderer's screenshots and about 200 Plunderer's screenshots. There is thus a deficit of the latter category at the moment. May I persuade you folks to help me with collecting more screenshots using Plunderer's (and, if possible, Ace In The Hole)? (Hey, it's much easier than the other option! 😄) Once both are over 300 the collection phase can be over.

Thanks again for your great help so far!

Thanks, man.

Sometimes I want to but I never do, I'm a slut for blood points
---
I would rather not go against pc nurses thank you.
---
"the icon of halloween" is a trademarked slogan for the ghostface mask, not an actual description. Just like how no one actually loves mcdonalds, despite their "i'm loving it" slogan.
---
Only problem with it is it’s a crutch perk. Killers that NEED wall hacks to find survivors are bad. Survivors that don’t know you can hide behind the gen you’re working on or hide in a locker to counter it are bad. Yet it’s still run on literally every killer for the effect, not just for the bp. 
---
I guess my bigger problem is I hate seeing the same perks every game. 
---
I excuse hex ruin because gens are completed way too fast. It’s a problematic perk because nerfing gens makes the perk op and nerfing the perk makes gens way too easy. They should just remove the perk and make gens harder to complete in general.
---
Possibly have multiple survivors come in; one to distract. If you think it's hopeless, you can also go for the arm wave to let others know she's around. Then they can do gens.
---
No, those two nodes are just replaced by other stuff.
---
She was proxy camping, when I got off the hook she came back and downed me again. I could have ran her for longer if I put down pallet, so it’s kinda my fault. 
---
I’m going to run urban evasion just in case I come against a hag. Thanks for the suggestion!
---
[It’s been like this for too long](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9tgzyh/ghostface_waiting_to_be_put_in_the_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;utm_term=control_2)
---
there's a pretty clear line between playing the game and abusing the game
---
no human is obligated to be nice to any other human at any time in life, but it's a fucking lot better when we are
---
this doesn't mean you have to give up playing the game how you want to or having fun
---
I don't condone survivors being toxic or overusing game-changing tactics either
---
my original comment was intended to apply to both killers and survivors, except the part where I specifically mention killers
---
Nonchalant leaning cup included?
---
I like "run like hell"
---
"Peel out" is really strong. I feel like That would be the best exhaustion perk in the game.
---
"Wheelie" is cool, but it feels like a better version of that one Quentin perk.
---
I think his power will stay the same, but he’s going to get the ability to enter the real world once he builds up enough meter, so he will be able to hit people without putting them to sleep.
---
I think the only counter to a campy killer is for your team to rush gens and leave. You'll die but the killer only gets a 1k and barely any points. Might prevent them from doing it again as they'll see it wasn't worth it.
---
This also goes for this entire community.  Nobody who plays this game knows how to take a loss.
---
Yes. [If it can hold on for this long](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9tgzyh/ghostface_waiting_to_be_put_in_the_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;utm_term=control_2) I think it will be fine.
---
I don't think you should ask ME about it, I thought about some reasons but i'm not a dev. So I'm not the proper guy to answer you, I'm sorry :(
---
That would work if they didn’t just spam fuck you
---
She had Ruin and they couldn’t find it. I told them to just go through generator. But they insisted on finding the ruin. So by the time they found it, one tried to get me while I had a second left. She teleported and downed him.
---
Yeah, that's what makes it funneh
---
True. I didn't really think of Quentin's perk. If Peel Out was actually in the game I'd despise it since it'd make pallet looping even safer. Run Like Hell is one perk I think is realistic that it could be in the game since it directly counters tunneling.
---
I love this glitch, I’ve only had it happen to me once
---
omg
---
Pepehands
---
Possibly have multiple survivors come in; one to distract. Crouch around traps and they wont go off. If you think it's hopeless, you can also go for the arm wave to let others know she's around. Then they can do gens.
---
Edit: Crouching won't work if Hag runs Scarred Hand, but then she can't teleport.
---
5 gens left, with ruin and SWF team who hate doing gens with ruin. 
---
When I get another team I’ll tell them to do just that, thanks for the suggestion.
---
Reverse order.
---
My favorite is how if a killer DCs, even at the very end of the match, none of the survivors get their blood points. It literally wastes the 15-20 minutes you spent in the match when it's like you never even played it. Shit is so stupid
---
OoO is so funny you just make eye contact with killer and sit on their gens as they hide in the basement watching you
---
I heard, but I never saw where. Though, that means the PTB isn't too far behind.
---
AHAHAHHAAH no. I try sometimes, to get those faces..and then never again.
---
He's not even a real doctor, and I don't hear you complaining about that.
---
It's just strange to me is all, how certain playstyles are considered toxic because they're effective
---
Best way to change him without giving a chance of making him worse
---
2G1C
---
*laughs in oink*
---
why not? i thought it was easier to 360 with a controller
---
Well yeah, they paid for a license. The hype needs to be strong.
---
I know. It's just VERY much likely to killers to face solo survivors with some duos and ocasionally trios with the solo guy, and rarely a full squad. And like I said before, I don't mind it, ppl Just wanna play with their friends.
---
oof
---
Also the xbox version is getting more players because of Game Pass. Hopefully since they are bringing Game Pass to PC we may see more PC players as well
---
aha yes funny meme
---
Freddy's original design was meant to include the trenchcoat from New Nightmare, so I'm pretty confident that they're one in the same
---
Besides, they're not really that different. Freddy showed up in Dylan's dreams before he possessed him, and the movie is still considered canon (despite completely changing how Freddy's powers worked and apparently bringing Nancy back from the dead)
---
Implying that No0b3 actually plays efficiently...
---
On a related note: What else was in that community form thingy again? Seeing as how the battle pass seems to have been in the plans all along, so very well could all the other stuff in there.
---
whats michael’ stun noise??
---
the game was bopped from the start
---
Sony and Microsoft are working [together!](https://twitter.com/pcgamer/status/1130176308061855744) So I think we should be fine
---
(Redhead pinkie intensifies)
---
If you go into store, next to it there is a tab labeled 'Shrine' and in there you can buy this perks if you have enough red stone (can't recall the name of the currency)
---
I noticed that's getting to be a common play. Hook and camp. Pretty annoying.
---
BBQ a crutch perk? haven't seen anything more stupid than that before. What's so "crutch" about it? Should we start calling Wake Up! a crutch perk because it shows you where the gates are? Since when does "crutch" just mean effective? 
---
Most of the time BBQ aura reading doesn't even activate. most people run BBQ for points and SOMETIMES for aura reading (for example, on Nurse or Billy)
---
Bubba has an aoe chainsaw. Is it not obvious who the winner is?
---
Oink.
---
I usually rock Ruin, BBQ, Nurses and then for the final perk I vary between Sloppy Butcher, Devour hope if I wanna play risky or if I see more than two items I’ll just take in Franklins
---
I think he’s literally just called ‘The Creeper’
---
I think it would be cool to get Amanda Ripley from the alien franchise as a stand-alone survivor. She’s badass and I fucking hate the xenos + BHVR said making a non humanoid killer is really expensive
---
Ughhh... still people thinks this is funny???!! This is the cringies meme ever
---
dig
---
Long Shift is pretty much outmatched by Bond (besides the range). Otherwise, these perks are pretty interesting.
---
An efficient survivor makes the killer dc :)
---
That was Nea?!!!
---
Make it Happen!!!!!
---
I wonder what ghostfaces perks are gonna be
---
Is this won?
---
I mean you're gonna get shitty players regardless of terror radius being there or not. Plus with insidious and dark devotion theres really not much to stop it. Apart from points being taken away for camping.
---
You get the camelots and... the cage!
---
Giving survivors the ability to vault is a bad idea because shitty players will abuse it to infinite the killer: on haddonfield.
---
Fuuuuuck I've been trolling myself all day waiting for people to start making posts here about the stream thinking wtf why is no one talking about it didn't it start hours ago?? Dammit I've been thinking all day that today is Friday
---
Nurse on any console is challenging lol
---
I wouldn't hold my breath tbh. 
---
Considering they invited content creators which is something 90% of the community doesn't care about (the subject itself, not the people invited), it probably will go down like this:
---
10 minutes talking about ghostface.
---
10 minutes talking about the roadmap (this is a stretch, I doubt it will last more than 5). 
---
10 minutes talking about freddy rework.
---
30+ minutes talking about stuff involving the streamers, BHVR's accomplishment this past year, how they are grateful to work at the company and bla bla bla.
---
Barely anyone camps with any of those characters outside of rank 20
---
It would be a bloody battle. With the wraith and freddy sitting there a watching
---
Keep in mind the killers field of view. First person vs third person, very limited compared to survivor. Urban comes in handy a lot of the time due to this. The quicker movement speed allows you to move around small obstacles just taller than your survivor, avoiding being seen. A lot of the time survivors give themselves away when they THINK they've been spotted, but if they stayed crouched and moving out of  killer fov they'd be fine. It's great if the killer is just running from gen to gen, to lose killers in chases, avoid chases, so on.
---
If we ignore reanimating and supernatural strength and various other powers, then whoever is not hanged up on first.
---
Small price to pay for playing with friends really.
---
One of the funniest things to do is run a lery's offering with Red Paint Brush, either Pill Bottle or Z-block, and Monitor and Abuse.
---
Freddy has NO terror radius outside of a chase and if you use Z-block too, he only has a 3-second sleep transition. It's one of the most pulse-pounding, scariest builds to go against because people just think "Oh it's Freddy no big deal" and they're asleep before they expect it, and you can do stuff like jumpscare them around corners and grab them off gens. I like to run it with Haunted Grounds and Rancor for extra fear among the survivors.
---
Yep. But alas, I don't work well with keyboards. So console is my go to
---
I don’t get this argument and why people even remotely believe this is some sort of effective counter to her. Not cleansing just makes her like a permanent tier 3 Myers. Cleansing hurts her way more than not cleansing.
---
Dwight the cutie scootie boi
---
Huntress.
---
I just can't afford a pc, I don't have 5k sitting around
---
It’s 8 18 pm est now.
---
I just can't afford a pc
---
please be double blood points please be double blood points
---
If you don't take that second though..
---
I feel
---
Yeah she probably would be good

Repost
---
2 bubbas? No BillyHilly?
---
Lies. I had a rank 6 pig crouch camping the basement last night.
---
Can we have carl be the new survivor with a mall map? Now THAT would indeed be epic.
---
Freddy. Just wait until there's one killer left and they're weakened, then put them to sleep for an easy kill.
---
You can't really escape in that situation.  Unless you have a key for opening the hatch. I hate this new system tbh
---
Can a movie about a movie series be canon in that series???
---
oh well that sucks its whatever though
---
Yeeeeeeah but the killer would always find you cause of the lingering smoke that always follows shorty around. I’d play the fuck outta him too though. His character was dope af. Lol
---
This is the exact same energy as "I'm toxic because its fun" Screw you dude. Don't admit it like an idiot.
---
If it's Billy or nurse your only option is to accept death
---
You could hold the gate for 4 seconds so the first bulb doesn't light up and you can open it in 16 after the killer leaves, but that only works against other killers
---
I always say "thanks for the easy blood points :)" to people like this, it really pisses them off and I get a good laugh as well.
---
this might have given me a better chance ty for the tip :)
---
God I feel this on a spiritual level.
---
And if the killer have the perk whisper, you are really screwed trying to sneak open a gate.
---
What karma? You don't have any to begin with?
---
I meant the events of the movie. It retconned a few things established in the previous ones
---
Early one for us!
---
Freddy.  All he has to do is just sleep the last killer when they're weakened for an easy kill.
---
When stunned that could be cool although I'd go for the slept guy I was already chasing anyway. Would at least mean Freddy has SOMETHING to gain from eating pallets like I do when playing him.
---
Unless you got evidence, not a lot of people care.
---
Ya, the coat was meant to be in one of designs but wasn't used, he was also meant to be more serious instead of being comedic. 
---
The thing is, Wes Craven made it clear this is not the same Freddy. He even made the original Freddy show up in the movie to let everyone know it's a different character than the Freddy we know. The end of the movie showed that too.
---
You could open it enough to light the first bulb then run for the other gate and hope he wastes time looking for you at the first
---
[removed]
---
Don't take it too seriously. It is just a game after all, and if I am going to deal with people who are acting like idiots, then I am going to treat them as such.
---
Lol. That would be rough as a survivor. One of my favorite videos is Monto’s jump scare Myers at Lery’s  Or his impossible skillcheck Doctor at Gideon. That Lery’s one would give me jump scares like crazy. And the Doctor one would just be awful lol.
---
Camping is such a garbage and trash strategy that  its funny when it doesn't work and the killer gets no kills. I can bet you're one of those people who uses it to genuinely play the game?
---
Yeah ever time I watch his stream hes salty and drunk
---
damn thats true
---
Too much karma, tis the problem.
---
Imagine being both trash in game and trash at being smart IRL.
---
this mightve given me a better chance if i could hide my scratch marks well enough during the sprint it might have worked, ill remember it ty :)
---
Platform: PC

Type of bug: Menu

Description: The last survivor in a lobby can't be found. In other words, these glitched lobbies are always missing one survivor so the game can't start. As killer, I have to make a new lobby for a potential fix.
---
You should not try to open the gate, you should just wait for the hillbilly to get tired of going between gates.
---
[Here ya go.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/8fce43/camping_in_dead_by_daylight/)
---
I remember that shit, both disarming traps mid chase and having them disarmed on me mid chase.
---
Forget that!!!
---
Shirtless Myers should be movie franchise separate from regular Myers.
---
At least an entire trilogy!!  Of shirtless campy horror-tainment!
---
i play mostly killer, can confirm
---
Kind of is a chore to play the same game every single day for like 2 years.
---
The hero we need...
---
If we can get the Boss as a killer then hell yes.
---
As an individual who also plays Quentin quite frequently, same level as Nea and David, I agree.
---
But I mean like a seriously fat person... like has trouble standing up type of fat. Not a little chubby.
---
It's possible.
---
Yeah its just kind of sad to see
---
I liked that video so damn fast after he said that.
---
Most egomaniacs are like that tbh.
---
There is nothing more OP then Billy with BBQ &amp; C, Ruin, Discordance and Tinkerer.
---
Change my mind
---
Something to the effect of "Thank you X for the Y months, you get (to keep) the cap and emotes, welcome to the Tru3munity"
---
Youll get messages off people after game.
---
Theyll tell you to uninstall, bitch about unhookings. The higher the rank the more annoying it gets. Be prepared for the most annoying experience in your lifetime. Get ready to be face camped by a nodding billy or be tunneled by a wraith where you feel like you insulted his mother for how many times you get downed. Get prepared for long ass wait times. The rewards for levelling characters up are bloody default cosmetics. Get prepared for being told youre playing the game wrong for playing it right. Expect to the expected. Expect the dumbest shit to work.
---
Ive had the game for a year and I'm addicted. A rank is just to flex with no proof.
---
You'll see.
---
I mean he got pallet slapped and flashlighted that's not...lifechanging as a killer? It is funny tho.
---
I think the devs have stated that they don’t want to do a mimic/ survivor imitation killer
---
I’m intrigued man! Are there any good starter tutorials on youtube?
---
This is actually not bad, but dont you think that peel up is wayy too good?
---
What about day 5 though?
---
I reccommend bricky if youre looking for killer tutorials. For survivor idk i tend to watch no0b3 for laughs but survivor perks are usually down to preference.
---
With all the Gru memes, we just need him in the next DLC at this point.
---
Id bring it every game tbh.
---
Yeah. I didn't really think about it in the moment.  I just thought it was similar to something like lithe.
---
Not Dbd related but this immediately came to my mind.  
---
[BEHOLD!!](https://youtu.be/-77cUxba-aA?t=2715)
---
I’m a noob what are the spikes at the exit?
---
thats a big rip ;p
---
Hey Pot, I would like to say take a good look in the mirror before you call Kettle black. Toxic is by varying definition. I am taking it as "Camping" in this context. If you want to say that you are on your high ass horse and you would never do anything that just manages to work despite being completely stupid, then go right ahead. My self respect is perfectly fine, I just am willing to admit this simple fact of life: It doesn't matter what you say, does not matter what you do. Results are the only modicum of success. If you aim to help everyone live a better life, it does not matter if you have to break a few eggs to feed them. 
---
It isn't the fact that I like being toxic, it is the fact that people look at me and say scream and cry like an infant, shrieking at displeasure. Just because people cannot accept tactics, does not mean it is not effective. By your logic, Snipers are toxic, a Turret is toxic, any class that builds is toxic, hiding in a locker is toxic. I am sitting there, waiting for people like you to realize: It doesn't matter how "Toxic" I was, you just managed to do something that got me better results. So Pot, realize that you are just a player who believes that the competitive game should have "standards" outside of Anti-Cheat. I am the player who goes for results, you are the "Moral" one. Play Insidious LF, it is a blast, because it is simple and you can turn off your brain.
---
Just because a survivor brings in a flashlight does not always mean they are gonna be toxic.
---
teabagging and clicking is toxic, flashlight saves are not.
---
it's not that hard to understand.
---
I made another one, this one will help with totems being destroyed right away as well as making the survivors focus a specific totem before the others. There are some obvious easy counters for this but that’s what Hex totems are, OP but counterable.
---
Killer—Hex: Shrouded Miss judgment: A Hex that shrouds evil from the wandering eye. All hex totems are disguised as dull totems. If a Shrouded Hex totem is cleansed show all survivors auras for 3/4/5* seconds. When a dull totem is cleansed show the one survivors aura for 3/4/5* seconds. Shrouded Miss Judgment cycles through all dull totems every 30 seconds disguising as a Hex totem. If Shrouded Miss Judgment is cleansed
---
-Unshroud all Shrouded Hex totems
---
-Summon 1 Hex totem perk back into the trial if Shrouded Miss Judgment was hiding in it
---
-Summon 1 Dull totem back Disguised as a Hex Totem
---
-Reveal all totem auras for 5/4/3* seconds
---
If this is the first totem to be cleansed, all hex and dull totems are shrouded as invisible and cannot be cleansed for 90 seconds.
---
Hex: Shrouded MissJudgment cannot summon itself back, Shrouded Hex Totems still give normal bloodpoints like they would unshrouded. Small game and auras are not shown while a totem is rendered invisible for the 90 seconds.
---

It's just a visual for killers telling them that they can't pass that point.

Yeah I'm sad we didn't get Sydney :/ sounded like the legal stuff regarding the Scream license was a little screwy though so I guess I understand.

I'd really love to see how many hatch escapes we have now vs how many we did pre-endgame. I'd bet it dropped by at least one order of magnitude.

Still mad that they haven't released this store as a map :(

“Common offering” _pls_
---
It'll look like that for survivors if blood warden is active.
---
Ah good ol' T1 myers at rank 20.
---
He can't be a survivor. He FUCKING DIED!!
---
This is why dead by daylight sucks survivors are too strong. Please devs remove self-care, MoM, pallets, flashlights, and DS.
---
Everything this guy says is true. I really wish Gun would make an unlicensed spiritual sequel to F13. Unfortunately, with Horror Inc stringing them along (“We’re absolutely interested in continuing the game in some form once mean old Mr. Miller accepts whatever pittance we’re willing to offer him”) and Illfonic working on the Predator game (a PS4 exclusive so double fuck me, I guess) my hopes are at an all time low. 😞
---
Honestly I don't even want new characters right now. I am excited for ghost because his mechanics look really fun, but they need to add more maps and put more focus into bugs. They could make maps a purchasable thing like cosmetics, if a survivor has it there's a chance for that match to be sent, yada yada. We get new killers all the time but most of the time we just get remakes of existing maps. It's started feeling lazy tbh. With ghost I'd rather have no map than a remade map. I'm happy he's coming
---
I love all of the Scream movies and never once have I heard Ghostface referred to as  "The ICON of Halloween"®
---
Are you suggesting that you can buy it from YouTube directly?
---
Also why would they purchase this particular killer as trending and not another?
---
If you could reliably purchase trending then a lot more Coke and Pepsi adds would be there.
---
Farmer John is where it’s at
---
You know every survivor except for nea died in the physical world and was then taken into the entity's realm right?
---
And while you're at it, remove NOED, ruin, bbq, and Franklin's xD
---
God damn it. I got the game free in the summer on os4 and it was there and my dumbass thought it was trash. I came back to the game and it had been in the shrine the week before. I'll never win. I just want it for bloodpoints.
---
Nah man he's just a survivor that thought manning the till on the new map would help him blend in.
---
To be fair... He really faces sh@t survivors...
---
Basic math seems a little op ngl
---
What made me stop watching him was that he always speaks like he knows everything, even on topics he's clearly not well versed in.
---
Then again, people always have their opinions about the human body, health and how diseases work.
---
Its litterally in every announcement
---
I break all the time. That is what makes me angry. Let me get this guy so he doesn't quit the game because of this toxic face camping.
---
I seriously don't understand camping. I play trapper mostly and I usually hook someone, place a trap at a window or pallet or tall grass nearby, and I leave to find another player and stop gen completion. I don't care if they unhook the guy because they might get caught in the trap, and if they don't next hook is second hook and then after that they die.
---
Why camp for so long doing nothing if you can kill survivors by hooking 3 times?
---
Mechanically that could make him a little bit stronger, though not by much (he'd still be extremely vulnerable to looping, pallets, windows, and all the things he has problems with already), but it would just be inconsistent with the movies. The real world is where he's at his weakest, especially in FvJ and the remake. And keep in mind the remake version is the one we have.
---
*an efficient swf makes the killer dc
---
Will come eventually i'm sure.
---
10.  The killer shack basement looks like a torture chamber for the killer, but really it’s not.
---
 It’s a cry corner for the survivors to hide in when the game gets to hard. It’s also a safe area that survivors can bond and heal together in situations when the killer is ‘sooo OP and they can’t even — right now’.
---
You know many lobbies are just solo queue lobbies. If people save others, it isn't cause they are swf. Cone on you are giving us killers a bad name.
---
That's why I laugh when killer mains just regurgitate "just do generators". You cannot do them fast enough as a group of solo survivors due to the fact the other three survivors will tend to go check on why that hooked guy hasn't been saved yet, thus preventing all the generators to be effectively done. That's why solo survivor is a garbage experience compared to SWF. As an SWF, yes you can punish that play style due to voice communication. Solo survivors? Most of the time you cannot unless you get a group of selfish survivors who already do not tend to unhook people.
---
ah makes sence
---
he is getting a rework soon so i’d wait a few days
---
It always feels weird being in the same lobby as these losers.
---
Okay.
---
F i feel bad lmao
---
Gale swallows
---
Where was all this love for chubby boys when i was in high school XD
---
I mean, did you win?
---
To remark a little on #2, when I say killers with easy first hits, I primarily mean Legion. This isn't to say you should never heal against Them, but since Their frenzy hit can't down you, healing isn't as useful as it is against other M1 killers like Freddy or Hag.
---
I tried to make this one as color blind friendly as my last couple of guides were certainly not. Hopefully this version works for everyone, and if not I'll post a text-only version as I did with my last few guides.
---
Amanda (The Pig) died so
---
The entity doesn't care about death lmao
---
Im not a red rank, just here saying happy cake day!
---
Mom nerf is valid
---
Props. I play mostly killer and boi I get salty when I'm swarmed by t bags and flashlights. I won't usually face camp the dickheads but they are definitely not getting away. I'm tunneling distance lol.
---
You were that guy that looped me on haddonfield fences for days. HOW. DARE. YOU.
---
I got it before
---
From what I've seen, it has only been in the shrine twice. I'm sure it will appear again, but not anytime soon. The devs know that one of the main reasons that people buy bubba is for BBQ. 
---
I guess that getting BBQ depends on how much you love the game. I just think that paying $5 just to grind for one perk is not worth it for me.
---
Well written and informative. Take my upvote
---
Lol bruh shush I was at work
---
Considering there is a literal Toyota ad that is 2 weeks old and has less than 400k views currently at #18 in trending and I have seen top out at 14. Yes I am saying companies can buy their videos into trending.

Wait really?? I heard theres a possiblity of getting banned when you do that

Its really not. If youre used to voice chat in any pvp game youre more than ready for dbd.
---
It works even with max kindred.
---
Random teammates are smart. :/
---
Yeah ok dude.
---
You can literally google dbd lore instead of making dumb threads and waiting for an answer
---
I personally just consider Ash and Ghost Face to be their own chapter with the map possibly being what they are hyping up to be a massive map rework. Sure it sucks they arent selling it as one whole chapter but it would be weird to have a chapter that contained two separate licensed
---
The spirit is a fucking walking corpse. The entity could not give fewer shits about people being dead.
---
Really really. It’s totally fine to do those since they don’t slyer game play. If it does get banned you just contact Easy Anti Cheat and they’ll remove the ban
---
Kate didn't die though.
---
Yeah definitely not. I'll be grinding for a perk that I'll use to grind. By that time I won't need it.
---
I love all your posts that help new players, they're very helpful and made in a very nice way. Too bad they can't be pinned, somehow.
---
I partially agree, he gets visibly frustrated sometimes (completely understandable) but tries to hide it to keep it a positive stream. It kinda bothers me a little, like it's okay to get some steam out sometimes, but other than that I really enjoy his stream, gameplay and his chat aswell.

So much for an anniversary event when they're skimping out on us
---
We dont give a shit about him
---
Why do people make such a big deal out of this stuff ? Lmao
---
What does the baby killer taunt mean? I’m assuming it isn’t related to Vietnam
---
I initially disliked Monto since he felt so mean spirited ... But damned if that boy didn't grow on me. He's actually really good at the game and his builds are hilarious.
---
GIVE US CARL.
---
who cares if you use noed i use it all the time as a opportunity to get more bloodpoints but i usually kill all the survivors before they even get the gens done
---
DAT JUICY
---
Acts like he's gonna use mic. Doesn't realise there is no mic. Cringe.
---
Good strategy when survivors body block and flash light. Bad if they work gens while you camp. I think it all comes down to survivor communication.
---
I usually don't get mad at the game unless there's a good reason to be, you're totally right though
---
Hahahahahahha!
---
knife doesn't even have a texture kek
---
Yeah I got all of them
---
It means “noob killer”
---
As in, bad killer
---
We want the home depot map as well devs. Thank you!
---
Same dude, the only reason I’m using it is because i just prestige’s my legion and that’s the first good perk I got
---
Then why is the guy claiming that you have no skill? You won.
---
Address them instead of blocking? Blocking just make him seem more guilty tbh
---
Didn’t they say in a dev stream sometime ago that when killers pass through realms they can catch glimpses of each other in the fog?
---
prob paid youtube to be in trending page, this happens alot and it's been shown on many vids so doesn't mean much there is a video on trending with 700k views but its been up for 3 days
---
And thats why u never should be greedy🤷🏻‍♂️😂
---
Don't care about the ghostface killer at all - no cell phone related perks or attack. #fail
---
Quick question we're did it leed to irl
---
The pig head is a power limiter, if you take it off you'll go even faster than Billy
---
I like you Billy! I can't stand Bubba Ballerina
---
They're fixing that by widening the basement a bit! Idk if it's implemented or not yet  (sounds like it isnt) but the only place that will be an issue is one of the coal tower maps because of the door frame at the top of the basement. I remember seeing a video about it
---
Ifif you’ve played this game a lot then you’ll know that people will say your trash even if you’ve gotten a 4K. That goes with any game
---
So does apologizing for being a pedophile. I feel like saying "sorry for my actions" in an incredibly insincere way is a bigger admission of guilt than denying a crime you never committed. But that may be because you're 16, his target demographic both on YouTube and his sex life.
---
Game is already a balance nightmare. No way 2v8 would be my better,  probbly just worse
---
Did Michael try to moonwalk to mindgame a knee-high piece of debris?
---
You dont admit to things you've never done simply to shut people up unless you did them and you're throwing a hail mary.
---
He's not wrong...
---
Would rather have Dwight the cop from the movies or Sidney
---
Tons of killers camp at all ranks now. It is insane.
---
This is so good
---
The problem is that in the end, no one wants shit points for just gen jockeying and leaving without altruism, plus they might want a sexy save, etc. Its not fun for anyone to just sit and do one single task in dbd.
---
THIS. I love the trailer and elsewhere the textures look great... except on that damn knife.
---
I need No Refunds as a perk ASAP
---
&gt;still not fulfilling their duties  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I want to tell everyone that this game isnt hide and seek, its freeze tag
---
Survivors have no duties other than to, well, *survive*. What everyone thinks is the best path to accomplish that goal is different for everyone, not just what you want them to think. 
---
Also, this game is both hide and seek and freeze tag. In fact, hide and seek is one half of the killer's entire game.
---
When did I say that people save other people only if they’re swf?
---
Are you trying to say he doesn’t?
---
He makes videos as a 20 something to impress high schoolers and gives away gift cards using other people's footage.
---
If I play solo. I run Kindred, decisive, dead hard and adrenaline. In SWF I run decisive, dead hard, adrenaline and deliverance
---
I’m actually not, I recognize when it’s a good strategy.  It’s only good against people you know who will go for the save no matter what, and that’s try hard swf.
---
Jason tbh
---
If you play any team game solo just expect the worse. Chances are you will get the worst.
---
Dbd is fun and all but is by far the most toxic fanbase I have played with, right up there with LoL
---
Well you see, Dwight is actually top material because he only hides in a locker to activate head on. The closest thing to actually fighting the killer. So actually, Dwight is an alpha.
---
I was playing against a pig at purple rank. I was running towards the side in the begging and she completely scared the shit out of me. When she downed me she tea bagged for no reason and camped me until i was dead, baiting other survivors.
---
He was actually having some legit fun with MK11, he seemed way more natural and less arrogant because it was new ground so to speak. When he lost rounds he would actually talk about things he needed to improve on, and he would get excited with good reads, etc. I think dbd may not be too healthy for his mindset maybe.
---
When she blinks move towards her then move away when she blinks
---
Realistically, hell no the time isnt worth it, a skilled player can win two maybe three games in that time 
---
But some people are stubborn, example, hatch stand offs pre collapse
---
wow they made bbq and chilly worse now
---
That would be a great idea, I think he would be leaning relatively towards the believing no collusion side due to his immense fortune and his hard work ethic on the Macmillan estate
---
It's not possible
---
And people ask why my profile is private and only friends can message me. This is why.
---
not after they worked on the perk but besides the point how did you get "Laurie" next to your name
---
its not a bug, not a feature
---
yeah and sometimes it saves you if there is a toxic survivor
---
That’s not my plan friend
---
Does most of his videos around rank reset
---
It has always been a certain distance away. It was never within a distance close to the hook
---

---
Even so, the basement doesn’t extend so far from the barn.
---
*hag with make your choice
---
Honestly, sometimes you get really annoying players to go against. The scaring part sounds like a great part of the build, the being camped and taunted though, baiting survivors unfairly just seems unfun and unsportsmanlike.   
---
I've played a few games where the trapper would just stare at the players they caught all game til they died, then tunnelled the next survivor.  
---
Likewise, I've got against some others who are jumpy scares but always chasing and fun.
---
Just throw a fat 25% while thana gets less than that after injuring 4 survivors
---
^
---
Trapper is meant to be Jason btw
---
still waiting for Freddy’s basement.
---
They reduced the stacks you can get per tier, thus reducing the cap per tier. Tier 1 bbq allows 2 stacks, tier 2 allows 3 stacks, and tier 3 allows 4 stacks. Each stack/token is a 25% bonus. This means Tier 1 gives you a max 50% bonus,  tier 2 gives you max 75% and Tier 3 gives you max 100%
---
Pretty sure Myers, Huntress, or Trapper if they're just swinging.
---
I literally don't understand these comments at all
---
1.) Like yeah, the performance isn't going to be amazing but it's still dbd. The performance on console isn't amazing, but people stay play it, instead of pc. It's a great game.
---
2.) What's wrong with a battle pass? It cost money yeah, but cosmetics already do anyways. It can also provide secondary objectives too to also obtain those cosmetics. All payed users should be receiving it for free permanently, I hope.
---
ok i got it thanks!
---
What exactly are you saying? That borrowed time should be a default part of a survivor’s kit?
---
BT already only affects the hooked person. I don’t quite understand what else you want it to do.
---
Kinda ruins borrowed time.
---
More clarification pls. The unhooked survivor isn't put into the dying state if they're unhooked, so they do have a chance. 
---
What kind of chance do you mean?
---
Scratched mirror plus tombstone
---
No powers though, just swinging punches and stuff
---
The meme is different somehow...I don't like it.
---
Yes that’s exactly what I’m saying. Being farmed isn’t exactly fair and the survivor who was hooked has no control over whether or not if another survivor decides to unhook them in front of the killer
---
just realized i spelt myers wrong. my bad guys
---
I use that some exact outfit combo on my Claudette lol
---
Carl The Cashier now PLEASE BHVR
---
to be honest, even without campingm the genrush game has been strong lately
---
Are there really switch players who are waiting for this.  The game seems way out of Nintendo's niche.
---
Nazis
---
Plot twist: it's actually a fake hunting knife and Ghostface still stabbed it up anyway.
---
Super low effort. Seems appropo for the sub.
---
Wait I was thinking of the other currency 
---
I got them mixed up
---
I don’t get why people do quit when dying, just let it happen and keep your bloodpoints lmao
---
yes true I've killed people in like 30 minute games and they DC it's like you racked up atleast like 60k
---
Hmm, your No Refunds perk seems scarily similar to the idea u/key_boy7 had 3 hours before your post
---
gonna wait a while
---
Survivors would have to blink eventually.  A new mechanic to balance that.
---
Gotta love console DBD
---
everyone is a potato
---
Remove the comments...
---
actually, hell, just remove survivors altogether. let them free. let the killers wander the fog and make it into whatever they want. end the entity's reign of torment.
---
god the devs must be pulling they're hair out
---
What a cutie!!!!
---
Or keep them...as a trophy of sorts!
---
What a hero &lt;3
---
Yeah on pc she’s a nightmare
---
He probably means "efficiently" as "not running all the perks in a 4-man SWF to do the gens in two minutes and escape".
---
Which is boring and ridiculous and not fun to watch or play for a reason.
---
Just Edit your flair and you can make a custom one.
---
Don’t let him stalk, that means hiding before getting found or breaking LoS every second. It takes forever to build it up, sit at a corrupted gen until the perk is done and bam waste of perk slot. In a SWF just ring around the Rosie hiding at corrupted will keep him on patrol mode wasting his perk.
---
He was betting on doing the most damage as possible with this build and buying time for him Incase he had issues with stalking.
---
Yeah, idk. I wasnt 100% sure, as it happened to me too when the killer was afk but a chase started, but I wasn't sure. I guess I'll edit my comment. Thx :)
---
The best part about this is that Clown WALKS faster than Meg running.
---
You're not wrong
---
This is always a good idea unless they have Mettle.
---
Oh nice lmao
---
Yes I've always wanted a perk that grants you a Sports Flashlight just like Pharmacy does. #FreeCarl
---
Yeah I’m sure he could play “efficiently” and escape majority of the time but it’s not what people want to watch
---
*megalovania plays in the background*
---
Don't forget the songs be plays when he gets hooked "I'm coming home coming home tell the world I'm coming home"
---
Maybe hag????? Decoy wise.
---
Where is the lagswitch in this clip? Also, you know that if you have bad ping it causes issues too, right? I always try to dodge survivors with red ping because they almost always accuse you of lag switching.
---
Yes
---
You can click the profile pic and check.
---
Plus once you do that you can click the stream link on the profile and check the voc.
---
The game has immensely favored survivors up until about a year ago, now it's becoming more balanced
---
That's why survivor whining is at an all time high, y'all are just getting a taste of the frustration killers have been going through all this time
---
And you better like the damn video. Or clowns gonna take you to the basement and shove popsicles up your butthole
---
That's not a lagswitch.
---
So he wins by default, since noone can touch him.
---
So did Bill and Tapp
---
heres the orginal comic in color: https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts-begins/1950/11/01

He has a cell phone related mori... does that count?
---
The Thing, a mimic killer, could absolutely work. If they were to do The Thing, the best way of implementing it would be to have it mimic recently hit players, meaning its pallet stun noises and such would be a horrifyingly distorted version of that survivor's pain sound. They would also most likely be encouraged to create a different model for each survivor, but with the head split into massive jaws and at least one arm turned into a tentacle or something to swing with. This would be very, very cool, but it would take a long time to develop. I don't mind waiting for DLC, and I think the lackluster reception from recent chapters speaks to BHVR pushing them out too fast to try and stick with a roadmap, rather than simply releasing them when they're good and ready. If they were to do The Thing, they would have to streamline the disguise system to work automatically, probably disguising you as whoever you hit last (would make for a cool attack cooldown animation). They would also probably give it the ability to use those tendrils it has in the movies during chases to ensnare survivors or trap windows or pallets, while slowing itself to a crawl and becoming a fleshy mass writhing on the floor. This would add a nice chase ability and some risk/reward aspects to the killer. Ultimately, his disguise feature would make survivors weary of each other, especially if they made him able to emote and crouch like survivors can.
---
If they’re out of the terror radius they get the whooshing sound, you need to be in the terror radius to be silent. There’s also no add ons that make phasing quieter, only the prayer beads that remove the sound completely.
---
Thanks a bunch!
---
thats why i always play with a friend or 2. Wanna camp ? Too bad, we are not taking the bait.
---
I just think behavior got tired of killers complaining that they didn’t get a 4K and they were getting tea bagged at the gate so they made end game but killers still get teabagged and that’s what makes me happy

Tru3 is really obnoxious with how he thinks he knows everything about the game hes playing.
---
Yeah I know that feeling, *cries in 3 dead, 5 gens to go, nurse body blocking hatch with NOED &amp; cyprus mori.*
---
For some reason in the last kindred leatherface basement camp game I had, everyone did gens, we just got none done and all I can think is RNGesus+Ruin=No progress for you or they were 99ing. :/
---
I once went against Tyde in Last Year (lol I know) and he played killer like such a piece of shit, not surprised he's a bitch on stream too. I've seen Noob play a lot of solo games too though, I wouldnt say he only does swf, but then again he has a toxic series on YouTube so..lol
---
Thank you.
---
This bug happens with Unbreakable too if they finish the recovery as you are picking them up.
---
It's quite confusing at times.
---
Oh yeah, once she’s got a trap on someones head she can just kinda follow and get hits if they try the boxes. 
---
Don’t really know how this hypothetical game would work though, because to put a trap on them, you have to down them. If you’ve done that then you can hook them. Who unhooks them? Questions that we’ll never know the answers to i guess xD
---
You literally just gotta follow the sound of a chugging generator. They aren't gonna get far if they aren't doing gens.
---
yea and being toxic a lot more , and im 99% sure its just a "to keep appearances" GG
---
sounds like something i'd do for fun
---
this would be perfect worm with drugs freddy
---
He's talking like, we need a Paul Blart kinda fat. With the Segway and everything.
---
It is from an alcohol meme that guy made
---
Get the gens done as fast as possible. Do everything in your power to not be stalked at nearly any cost. Lockers can prevent instadown and they either waste time on you coming out or are forced to pull you out. Any loop that lets you break line of sight is great with his lowered movement speed. Most Michaels I play who do this never get to tier 3 or only get there after the gates open. If you get a good Michael you might just need to grit your teeth, take the loss, and move on.
---
Thing is, we already have a lot of setting we can change in the gameusersettings.ini file in our datas. Just no ingame option like turning v-sync off/on which is possible by simply editing the file. Same goes for the FPS cap at 60 which can be changed there.  
---
DbD has the options to give us advanced settings ingame, just doesnt do.
---
Michael still gonna be my main 😈
---
Nah, Shirtless Carl!
---
The girl on the left kinda looks like someone edited a face on her head.
---
If the killer closes the hatch. Can a key reopen it? Does anyone know?
---
He was just mentioning he only says it if the match was in his favor. Not that he said it at all.
---
Jesus christ no. hiding, pallets, being a productive member of a team etc. If you have to resort to infinites to survive then you probably don't actually think while playing this game.
---
Ooooof. It looks like you moved to the side. Did you teleport or did you move yourself? To me it looks like the game (lag) moved you and then you couldn't do anything.  I would say that's a lag switch.
---
Yes, it can
---
Or minimize endgamechat by the arrow next to where you type at. It wont show anymore unless you click on it again, idk if its just one playsession but its a good way to deal with the problem here without beeing unable to see the scoreboard.
---
Probably because they're default options in the unreal engine that weren't included for aesthetic reasons. Game devs really like a 60 fps, V-sync setup because then it's less likely you'll see glitches or ugliness, and that's what they test on. If you don't notice any difference while playing, fair enough. if you do, a quick google changes that.
---
Increase totem cleanse speed and/or have it show totem auras
---
While I'm fully on board with a totem counter, that's something that should be baselined into the game instead of being thrown into a perk.
---
give us the bathing suit, you cowards
---
i want nea and legion's artwork as a wallpaper
---
Really good Trappers and their placements are the bane of my existence in this game. I applaud you.
---
I’m kinda secretly hoping the switch port flops because we all know it’s gonna be shit
---
Playing with headphones probably helped my game more than anything else.
---
Is it bad to ask? Objectively, no. 
---
Is it heavily frowned upon? Yes.
---
Regardless of how others feel, do whatever thing you want to do. Just be prepared for any reaction.
---
I had a lot of problems finding survivors when I first started. Aside from paying more attention to how I played survivor, I found that certain perks really helped me out. Hopefully some of the stuff below will help you.
---
A good starter tracking perk is Whispers. You want to get Tier 3 of the perk, otherwise you'll still have troubles locating people because the area is still quite large. Whispers will give you a good idea where survivors are, but even better, it will tell you where they aren't, so you don't waste your time in that area. Note that Whispers triggers on hooked survivors, so it won't be as helpful if people are hanging around the hook.
---
There are some good perks to help you track when survivors are on gens. Discordance (a Legion teachable) will tell you when two or more survivors are working on the same gen. Surveillance (Pig teachable) will tell you when survivors start working on a gen you've kicked. Bitter Murmur will show you the auras or survivors after they finished working on a gen. Rancor (Spirit) does something similar, but also gives you the ability to kill your obsession when the gens are done.
---
Once you start getting hits and hooks, you want to look in to A Nurse's Calling (Nurse teachable), and BBQ and Chili (Leatherface/Cannibal teachable). Nurse's will let you see survivors healing near your location. Again, you want tier 3 of the perk, otherwise you have to be pretty close to see them. BBQ will show you survivors' locations for 5 seconds after you hook someone, as long as they are a certain distance from you. These perks are super powerful for tracking survivors, and have become staples in my loadout (and many other players'). Infectious Fright (Plague perk) will help you find survivors close to a survivor that you downed.
---
There are tracking perks that make things like scratch marks (Bloodhound, Predator) and survivor noises more noticeable (Stridor). I would tend to stay away from those, because they may make you think that a survivor is closer than they actually are. You can definitely experiment with those though.
---
By no means is this a complete list of perks you can use to track people.
---
You might also benefit from using a perk which lowers your terror radius. Monitor and Abuse (Doctor) will shrink your radius until you are in a chase. Tinkerer will remove your radius when you approach a gen that's almost finished.
---
This stuff is definitely not going to work for everyone, but hopefully you'll find a good combination of stuff that works for you.
---
??? u ok
---
i don't watch tru3 daily or anything but i like him and in the beginning i couldn't stand his stream for a minute but lately i enjoy his streams alot. U guys could be all right and i have never noticed but for me everytime tru3 says something about survs when he plays killer ( i don't like to watch someone play surv its just plain booring for me) , i can understand him to the fullest. I never found him arrogant or anything (at least that i noticed) for me it sounds more like he shouts out his Opinion (recently there was a guy that said : "Everyone has to be like tru3 and tru3's always right" in which he replied something like : "first of people twist my words i never said that and second im here to discuss about everything" . I like tru3 and don't find him toxic or anything (at least not that i notice but at the same i don't watch him that much , maybe once a day when i eat or something). For me he just says what he thinks (e.g. "They got my ruin pretty fast could be a fast round might not get many here" ) What he does is : "This isn't a save Loop X" (X as in the surv he's chasing) which might sound arrogant or something to someone but not for me :/ ?  Would be kind if someone can answer with a timestamp of an example.
---
I have gotten 5 stacks with Autodidact plenty of times...
---
I bought headphones a couple months after I started playing. It's a completely different experience.
---
Not necessarily. If the Meyers instantly downed him from full healthy to dying, it wouldn't trigger Mettle but the hit would count towards the number of hits. Then healing to injured when dropped would allow Mettle to activate on the next hit, even in Tier 3, allowing the player to quickly run away. If Dead Hard was also taken, odds are good that the player would escape.

The Crapper
---
As a noob3 fan I in no way feel he’s having fun
---
That is terrible.  Did you report it?  It is very frustrating to deal with.  Cheating to win a game is so pitiful.
---
I'd say were doing pretty good so far
---
Survivor: *”-and I’ve got a restraining order so you can’t come within 500 meters.”*
---
Killer: *IM SHITTING IN YOUR CHIMNEY*
---
That's not lag switch. I've seen much longer videos showing lag switch, and it looks different. This is what a poor client internet connection looks like.
---
Literally just had a killer toy with me until the timer ran out. There's a lot of things killers do that's way worse than tbagging at the exit gate
---
Lmao No problem. Just saw my opportunity. I guess some people didn't like it though :p
---
but its already implemented in the game and u can do it in many ways? ESC--&gt; Quit/leave , Alt+f4 , remove network cable , remove ac from router , Shut down PC , Shut down PC and throw it out of the window , Shut down PC and throw it out of the window follwed up by urself and last but not least : Be nice , i love to play Friendly killer from time to time xd
---
Give Ash his chainsaw and boomstick and he wins easily
---
At least it’s not as bad as Billy on the game
---
Their reaction is so cringe
---
Ah okay. Usually I have to opposite problem where I'll have a 15 minute queue
---
Don't erase it. The sub is a lot less toxic than the game community and we love to see new people grow!
---
It's a hard game to learn, and you're already doing amazingly for 1 week of play
---
It's the players of a character, not the character.
---
The name alongside the comment checks out
---
Reeeeee
---
Insta downs, camping, tunnelling someone until they die. If you have to used NOED to win then you probably don't actually think while playing this game
---
Survivors.
---
Mcote.
---
Nurse
---
The full wiggle into hook vacuum happens what? Every 200 games?
---
Dewey
---
Dwight *actually* says:My personal perk Bond will allow you to see where the other survivors are, making it earlier to lure the killer towards them so they'll leave me alone and I can get my Bloodpoints from inside the locker!
---
That sucks, man. Sometimes people are so toxic they can never get over the butthurt.
---
I've been reading these tier lists all wrong!
---
Don’t ask for follows on Reddit. Twitter is a good place for promoting your stream. It’s mostly frowned upon here. The best way to grow is through networking on twitch though. Find other smaller streamers you enjoy, be supportive of them, be in their chat, make friends ect.
---
I've been watching true, haven't seen many monto, would I enjoy his stuff as well
---
the thing about the question is you can't just say "killer" because theyre not equals at all
---
Where have you seen him already modeled?
---
For the sake of game balance though, you can't give survivors 6 new perks and give killers 3.
---
*frowns*
---
Yep, i also apologized right after i finished the game but it was useless.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Seriously the fact that these girls were reacting to a Kpop music video makes me roll my eyes to the back of my head.￼
---
Yes, as long as you own the game.
---
GODDAMMIT I saw the previous comment and though for a second 2g1c was an actual K-pop group so I looked up on YouTube "2g1c" girl crying.
---
Its never bad to ask, but people always complain about "self-promotion". Personally i think you gotta do what you have to to get yourself out there, as long as youre not doing it excessively. If streaming is what you want to do often, i think you gotta do whatever to get your name out there, especially with alot of other people doing the same thing on whatever it is your playing.
---
What’s the point of the addons then?
---
What’s not fun about her? 
---
I can apply your method of explanation to every killer. You do X action and then hit them.
---
You have 3 holes and only 1 counts for being a virgin.
---
So I get off my fucking dick!!
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
If you don't let them bother you then you can keep them as proof of people that you bothered enough to take their time to leave a comment on your profile, some of them make great trophies.
---
I'm pretty sure they can't comment if you block them.
---
True is like straight forward just good. Monto is good/comedy. Puppers/Ohmwrecker is more comedy. I love mixing it up between these four.
---
Ill try
---
Whoops, didnt see it
---
I am Fleece Johnson. GIMMIE DAT BOOTY.
---
And when does the logic of "well dcing is justifiable if they're not having fun" stop?  Is it justified to DC against a killer they don't like?  What about if they get downed quickly?  
---
  
---
There are still 3 other people that you're inconveniencing at best, or often ruining the game of.  I can absolutely blame someone for screwing over their teammates
---
I agree with you guys.  I enjoy his streams.  No single person plays this game and never gets a little upset. Most of the stuff he complains about is legit, and you have to think it’s basically his job to play the game, he is going to deal with the bullshit aspects of it much more frequently than a casual player would.
---
Genuine question here. What makes you say that I was bullying the killer?
---
I think skill checks should do this regardless. 
---
Could make generators more interesting.
---
I agree,  I feel like most of his claims have some merit.  going up against a SWF literally does feel different than a solo game.  In some cases I have went up against 4 solo good survivors but that is rare I think.
---
Bubba's smiling down on you &lt;3
---
Monto’s F13 stuff is also good. 
---
My favorite stuff is when the councilors roleplay along with him. 
---
“NO PLEASE I’M POOPING.”
---
Survivors at low ranks, killer at higher ranks and about equal around rank 8.
---
I turn the video off as soon as I hear that "woo woo woo" or whatever the fuck lmao
---
Maybe that's a strong word, but it looks like you're 4 stacked with a Rank 20 and a Yellow, which made you match with a killer that is obviously way below your skill. Not sure if that's the case or intentional but doing that shit on purpose is insanely unfair to the killer.
---
It's hard to appreciate when someone "outskills" a noob when they're in purple ranks.
---
Si
---
Wait until the rework. No point in learning him 🤷
---
Not to be mean but I don’t think you comprehended what I said. I don’t trash Dailies I might as well get them done- I just don’t don’t enjoy her out of anyone
---
OP, do you get offended? I keep my messages on because some of the shit people say is hilarious!
---
you can close  a hatch?
---
Sounds like the Tyler1 of the DbD community
---
das me
---
Good perk synergy for doctor.
---
Well, I wasn't aware of this ship.
---
Please do go on
---
I feel this. I'll stand up for most Killers in chat unless they BMed unprovoked.

Lol what character, Scorpion?
---
Should’ve changed 1% to “slightly increases chances”

When you use a pallet, it knocks down a pallet from the shelf in another isle, setting up a new pallet in the next isle.

Oh shit he can tell by your playstyle that you make minimum wage?  
---
MOOOOOOM!
---
Could just be one of those killers. 
---
Only killer I can say I genuinely don’t enjoy playing is spirit.
---
Just get in a locker.
---
Started playing with Spirit for he first time today. Got love mail twice. It’s in the air!
---
How this comment doesn’t have more upvotes I’ll never know....
---
I became friends with a twitch streamer. Inside that insane asylum for the Doctor and played as Michael. He was on a generator next to a doorway and I came through it immediately, causing him to freak. Then we did a Scooby doo chase scene shit
---
I think you mean survs at high ranks and killers at low ranks
---
AUTODICKDICK
---
This inspired me to unprivatize my profile just so that I can report these people on PSN.
---
This is solid, I hope DbD enforces some kind of tutorial one day that teaches people these lessons.
---
Literally any time I've seen him he was tilted lol
---
Yeah, that way I don't have to reveal the actual amount and everyone can just guess.
---
Dude, developers will reveal today the rework they made for Freddy, so no point in learning Freddy in his current state.
---
bold comment
---
Not to be a kind of party pooper but this will be strong for about a month or so or however quick people learn the speed of the marker, and then it'll actually make gens go slightly faster due to the ability to hit Great Skills Checks quicker and honestly won't be as powerful as we'd want.
---
“I’m straight up not having a good time right now”
---
but that's gonna be like a month from now
---
Yeah that's cool, there's just a lot of scum that deliberately cue up with one low-ranked so they can bully new players, gives all streamers a bad name.
---
I’ll take Check Out please.
---
Is there a version of this meme with the huntress and a Dwight in the locker instead of hatchets? I feel like that should already exist somewhere.
---
Honestly DS was balanced really well.  I have hopes for them balancing MoM well.  Just how long will it be though..
---
1 of 3 perks being borderline OP, amazing. Meanwhile, If you actually want to count killer vs survivor perks in respective chapters.
---
Jane gave us...what? Solidarity, Head on and Poised, all pretty mediocre perks with the the arguable best being Poised.
---
Plague gave us Corrupt Intervention, which is a pretty good perk to tag with Ruin, Dark Devotion is just okay, and Infectious Fright is really strong on Nurse right now and overall a great time management perk.
---
But yeah, sure. We are just gonna get more Mettle of Mans.
---
It's super good outside of SWFs where it isn't quite as crucial (but still able to be plenty useful if only for noticing where exactly your team is).   Even just the 20M radius rank 1 does wonders for increasing your knowledge of events around you in the more clustered maps.
---
I'll work on a gen in a killer's terror radius if I see he is actively chasing someone, or perhaps realize to shift around to stay hidden/avoid grabs but still keep gen work going the moment he moves past, rather than bolting like a Dwight the first time he ever noticed a Myer's watching him.
---
iS iT iN yEt?¿
---
I don't mind panda, but his presentation is a bit much for me. I have to watch his stuff in doses
---
Yeah the devs already confirmed that it'll be June 18th.

&gt;It's more of the fact that the area and victim are so well created  
---
It's a hardware store and a dude in a cashier uniform, it was a fun trailer but we don't gotta act like they meticulously crafted an elaborate set and character design
---
Spirit is the most enjoyable killer imo. Just cruising with her invisible super speed always getting the drop on and scaring survivors.
---
Hell yea mori me! i dont understand why other streamers complain about that, if you have a ttv tag you better expect people to want to show off that fancy mori
---
And ? Tell me a single reason to learn him now, when in future he will be completely different from now.
---
Just wait for the rework.
---
The main thing that would throw survivors off is that the speed is constantly fluctuating as survivors are healed/injured, forcing them to adapt. Combined with other skill check perks, I feel it would at least be more useful than the current negligible maximum 16% action speed penalty.
---
Her feel on console is awful, I never feel the speedboost you’re supposed to feel after coming out of phase. 
---
I don’t enjoy having to turn my headset up to hear every little crunch of grass and the occasional moan. Especially since the moans can be at awful times.
---
I run that but with enduring instead of tinkerer. Thoughts to improve my load out?
---
Lmao that's not even related to the same thing. That's a perk, not a broken mechanic.
---
Double Jake, Laurdette, Queff, and Jeg...
---
I meant numerically low, but yea that.
---
It’s  good to understand how his dream transition works. You fade in and out during it. Can really bamboozle survivors of played right. YouTube videos on that. Other than that he’s a M1 killer. Get some good perks, I run ruin, Huntress lullaby, save the best, and monitor. Don’t chase one guy loop to loop.
---
Still, it's kinda budget Lullaby, or more so Lullaby 0.5. I agree that Thanatophobia needs a buff though and this one will fuck noob survivors 100%, experienced ones will get a handle of it.
---
It looked like the licensed killers were in the mobile leaks, so it seems possible.
---
 Youre pretty cringe yourself, blindly attacking this dude for not knowing shit about the game.
---
How would the icons in the bottom left be affected? Would it be delayed or change on unhook? Even then, if it passes 50%, then the killer wouldn’t get “entity summoned” scoring even though the icon says he would after getting unhooked. It is just messy with a lot of ways to get seen through
---
You need the wakazashi saya. The sounds make it fun tbh
---
 Also how tf is his attitude toxic? Sounds like he wanted a Mic to defend himself, not call others shit and the like.
---
Think of Phasing as a distance closing technique and use it to bounce between generators and points of interest. When you can predict a survivors next move but are a good distance from them close the gap by phasing. Don’t stop patrolling gens.
---
Did you just have a mori or is there a perk im not seeing?
---
-total noob
---
Thanks in advance.
---
Wazzup: when a survivor enters your terror radius, they yell “wazzup”, revealing their aura  for  10/15/20 seconds
---
Liver alone: when you successfully sacrifice or kill a survivor, all items in chests are temporarily replaced with a liver for 30/60/90 seconds
---
I’m feeling a little woozy: Downed survivor’s bleed out timer progresses 10/20/30 percent faster
---
Yep 0 WGLF stacks and dying on hook.
---
I don’t think you’re allowed to advertise your channel
---
I was honestly really looking forward to getting Sydney Prescott. I assumed we would since we got Laurie. Oh well this will have to do. Thanks for taking the time to make this
---
Agreed. It ain't funny, it is just ear bleeding annoying.
---
Depends on your other survivors. Feed him evil within you lose. Rush gens and if you think he has spirit fury do not go for pallet stuns.
---
Something that I have found is that just standing there to fake phasing works a lot. It’s also really fucking funny when someone gets close
---
That’s what I think it means, you start off with that many unlocked and the rest DLC. I don’t think it means total in the game but I guess we will see. It would be very odd if it was that behind.
---
Killer main here, nothing that survivor did was toxic. 
---
Billy got outplayed, he revved chainsaw when he shouldn't have.
---
There were plenty of opportunities for him to get hits.
---
I wouldn't be upset, that loss is on the killer, the survivor played well. That's just how competitive games work.
---
The saves are now on their servers ... why can’t we use an account system and switch between devices ? Especially with a mobile version coming we have to have separate saves on each device ? That’s dumb!
---
They should be used to losing
---
That’s 200 IQ
---
Spirit: Im the killer
---
Nea: Well yes, but actually no..
---
This needs more attention,have an upvote
---
Oof SB and BL
---
FFFFFFFFFF they probably were switching perks till the very last second in lobby and got stuck, were they playing like newbies?
---
but its fun
---
Either I have had entirely too much alcohol, or not even remotely enough. 
---
This shit is trippy.
---
Walked in and out of a locker 50 times while they had Iron Maiden and I still had to wait until end game collapse to die. Feels great
---
If you trash a daily it’s just re rolls...
---
I JUST had a Claudette do this, they were cooperating as if in voice comms (even though two generators were on one side of the map and one on the other, they all fixated on one in the shack), but she fell for the most basic mindgames.
---
Threw down pallet, didn't stun, click-click-click flashlight. I fake going around it, but there's no barrier. She vaults back into my arms anyway.
---
Chasing her to the exit gate with NOED up, Spirit walking. She throws down a pallet and is on the exit gate side of it, but didn't figure I'd go around, just standing there and not even running. She dies.
---
I only safety pipped admittedly, and it is annoying when facing instant-blind flashlights (or nearly so) because of pick-up animation lock, but I still got three of the slippery bastards. :P
---
Really if there is one thing that strikes me as "toxic" about flashlights besides spam-flashing them, it's that unavoidable blinds is a toxic frustrating experience, no matter whether you're using them in a toxic way. Getting blinded because I had to break a pallet or I had to vault a window or I had to pick up a survivor is 100% frustrating when it occurs in the animation lock.
---
Why are you shouting at me?
---
19th for the other side of the world
---
It's all good, i just thought it was interesting the people reflected the characters they were playing
---
some people do it some dont, same with VAC, I will mori someone and throw a game if they have VAC because fuck them,
---
As a hag main, best advice I have is have your team bring flashlights if you can, its always worth bringing one.
---
In the same way that a toolbox can considerably hinder a trapper, a flashlight can considerably hinder a hag.
---
Crouching helps but not if you run as soon as you are rescued. Its a good idea to have the rescuer run so the traps move in their direction rather than yours. That way you direct the chase towards the savoir rather than the saved.
---
Depending on the timing, you can actually walk through the traps and if you time it just right you'll end up behind her when she does teleport, giving you a bit of a head start.  Always do gens in a pattern where she cant lock down a small area. As others have suggested, doing gens fast should help against any hard-campers.
---
r/copypasta
---
Nothing I can think of off hand. What would you say are your main problems? Chases, finding survs, stopping gens ect

---
Haha each to their own , but i dont use the long hair because its easy to spot while looping rocks on certain maps .
---
If everything is unbalanced, maybe that makes everything balanced?
---
2 killers should be able to kill a few survivors if they work together, ending a lot of chases.
---
The game would honestly play out a lot more like a battle royal, where the loudest survivors get caught first and most stealth ones would mostly do a few gens. It has potential as an idea.
---
The only way to make 2v8 balanced though would be to remove some perks.
---
Imo, if you're going to tell people they don't have to watch the gens, in the same tip, I think you should also remind them that there is an audio cue for when a skillcheck is about to happen. If you aren't paying attention and you're too focused/busy looking out for the killer, there's a chance you might miss it or realise too late that a skill check is about to come up.
---
I'm guilty of doing this every so often, I'll have a suspicion the killer is nearby and be too busy watching out for them, and boom - gen explosion. Never a good thing to miss a skillcheck.
---
I’m a killer main so no idea what that is Chief
---
Also shoutout my 1st devotion I just got that game
---
Never thot about that. DBD PAY TO WIN?!?!? (Joking)
---
Oh an add on. That explains it. Thank you i was pretty confused.
---
What is VAC?
---
Really sucks when an immersed player comes and unhooks someone. You go back to the hook and the Blendette has disappeared, so the only person you find was the person you just hooked. If you want to play efficiently, you gotta learn to take chases for the team. Amusing as a killer when you find one of these immersed toads and they last for all of 4 seconds on the strongest tiles.
---
Wear headphones if possible. It makes life a lot easier when tracking injured survivors while phasing (and in general). 
---
Less experienced survivors also like to wait at/near pallets, so you can sometimes catch them off-guard by phasing to it and swinging immediately.
---
wrong, i want ghostface, fuck the cashier right off, give me ghostface.
---
Tip #5: It's better to finish a generator with a toolbox than to use the toolbox as quickly as possible.
---
Don't use the toolbox until a generator is about 50 percent done.  a 99 percent done generator can become a 0 percent generator if a killer kicks the gen and guards it.  It's better to work a generator without a toolbox and use the toolbox to guarantee completion of the generator.  Also it's better to use a toolbox on the last generator that needs to be completed rather than the first.
---
Disconnect
---
that wouldn't be that much of an achievment
---
The brand new part is a one time use add on and once it’s gone that toolbox now only has 1 add on. Why waste a rarer toolbox that would benefit from multiple add ons. Same goes for the Medkits and insta heals.
---
Perhaps you don’t understand what I’m saying. As I stated previously above; Killer has found me and downed me. Hatch is closed. Exit gates aren’t open. There’s no way I can make it out of this situation. Not even 1%. Give me some means of forfeit that gives the killer their 4K or whatever and saves me time not having to sit in agony to please some guys rage, so I get my bloodpoints too. What good reason is there to not have this feature?
---
YOU GUYS ARE POTATOES!
---
I hope that coming out of dream world will be just an added feature to him tho. Would be disapointing if they scrapped whole "pull in dream" mechanic.
---
Who would win
---
An athletic teen
---
Or a dad bod?
---
In the past a brand new part used to eat the toolbox when you used it, so people probably got used to using them with the worst toolboxes. Also, brand new part does the exact same effect no matter the toolbox, so there's no reason to use it on a better toolbox.
---
Imagine this killer with the pigs stealth ability? Outa no where sneaks up in ya with a chainsaw
---
Fake Love - BTS
---
Fucking Koreaboos ruin everything that’s good
---
I really want either The Thing from ‘The Thing’ or Pennywise from ‘IT’ in the game, idk what Pennywises name would be since it needs a “The” in it though. Maybe “The Fear” or “The Feeder” But both can shape shift so hopefully we get a killer like that eventually.
---
He's like Doctor, "Share The Pain" and try to sleep everyone as much as possible. Monitor and Abuse is super good because smaller terror radius means better aura reading.

Poor Leatherface. I love the original Texas Chainsaw and he and Pig were two of the main reasons I bought DBD in the first place only for Bubba to be completely outclassed by Billy. At least he’s fun and decent in MKX

Unless you 99 your heal, giving it literally no downside.

VAC stands for Valve Anti-Cheat. It’s what valve used in their games as well as whatever other devs decided to adopt it into their game. You’ll occasionally see people with (_ Vac Bans on Record) followed by (___ days since last ban) on their profile in bright red. 
---
Basically, they cheated in multiplayer games and got caught.
---
Which cosmetic do you think i should get for spirit?
---
Oh fuck those people.
---
Isn't that kind of what Jeff is? He has got quite the belly on him.
---
now this is how you use dying light kids.
---
One? Which one? R3? But two r15 is ok?
---
I’d get him just for monitor and abuse. His power allows him to end chases fairly fast so that’s a pro.
---
Just keep trying. You need to get used to the distance of the blinks and how long you need to charge to go a certain distance, and the only way to do that is to practice. Make sure you don't look down when you're blinking because that will drastically shorten your distance. Also, it doesn't hurt to practice while you are patrolling gens. Pick a spot in the distance and try to get as close to it as possible. You'll get used to the timing eventually and then it's just learning how to predict survivors.
---
Very questionable perks ngl...
---
Wait the Noed? Or you meam the players?
---
incorrect. Tapp would be doing gens.
---
The “fair” argument is tired. It’s a mechanic in the game. There are perks to get around annoyances on both sides. I will never understand why survivors expect killers to hit them and leave them alone, or hook them and forget about them or not try to do whatever in their power within the game to win.
---
Dont listen to them, go ahead and learn how to play him now and learn again next month, you enjoy him so you'll definitely enjoy it even after the rework.
---
What rank were they?
---
Gonna buy dat huntress body pillow
---
I gotta ask, are you being serious or is this sarcasm?
---
He was rank 10, she was 13 or 14
---
Probably just a shitty killer and when he saw his friend in the lobby he decided he wanted an easy game. Feelsbadman.
---
Honestly, I'd totally buy her over this ghostface coming out lolol
---
this is weirdly accurate
---
There was a bug or a lag spike in a game where bugs and lag spikes are very common
---
Yep, must be a lag switch
---
This fits the format perfectly
---
Which school outfit do you prefer? Should i buy the auric cells one?
---
Could tell this was console JUST from the lag
---
Well I'm a leatherface main and I never camped...
---
Am I playing him wrong?
---
I can actually agree with "Help me!" tho if it stacks with WGLF or if it would be one of those perks that can not be available at the same time.
---
I'm torn between laughing and running. It's clever. Dark, but clever.
---
Most of the time both door controls are in view in a certain angle making them impossible to open anyway because they'll see you opening it, even if their distance is somewhat far apart, that's a death wish, in this scenario, if one door is trapped off then they only have to watch a single door in order to have a guarenteed victory. When teammates are useless, you expect me to complete 5 gens alone? Killer already technically has an advantage at finding the hatch anyway because they don't need to hide and they move faster to cover more ground, and opening the gate while he's trapping the other would be a valid way to counter it, implying youre sitting at the gate furthest from him when be closes hatch, otherwise, you'll either get caught trying to open the gate or he will trap the one youre at, not giving you time to even get to the other and he can watch that one from afar. Heavily based on rng.
---
Yikes, don’t even remind me

I think that's why he was laughing, it's so easy to party chat on a console

People who use white text on nearly white backgrounds... REEEEEE.

I like your idea tbh. Is waiting 2-4 minutes that big of a deal? No but would it be nice to have this feature when I don’t want to wait? I get it, killers suffered in the past from hatch standoffs and holding the game hostage and all that stuff. But don’t fight that with the same things. Killers want to see the egc kill, that’s fine just let me give up and show that same kill animation when I do. Literally not a single downside to your idea.
---
Not having a function in the game does not mean its forbidden. That's like saying mods are forbidden in sandbox games just because the mods arent included. The gamemode is based around surviving with friends. You wouldn't open up that menu just to play with some people and not talk. Might as well just play solo, theres no reason to otherwise. That's the whole point of SWF
---
a lot of perks overall need balanced/buffed/changed
---
Yeah he seems very... dry these days? It’s like the same complaints over and over again and I mean every once in a while he would comment on a good play the survivor makes or make a good play himself, but other than that I feel like his stream got kinda boring now. Is it just me?
---
I mean, I could do it. The template of this has white space inside of the locker, so you could just shop Dwight in there.
---
Damn another Ochido meme for easy Karma who would have thought of it. I was afraid it wouldnt come this week since it is friday already.
---
Game runs like shit on the platforms it is on yet development is being used on more ports and more things to sell. Its kind of a joke how they keep releasing more paid dlc when the game is in such a poor state.
---
Sorta! But not as cool as The *Prank Call* perk : Killer can make a prank call to a random survivor. This triggers a ringtone sound and alerts the killer to their location. The survivor must stop whatever they are working on to temporarily silence their phones.  etc etc
---
What's wrong with it? Yes, it can be annoying, but IMO it's a nice sign to make a short break.
---
there is a reason you have -7 downvotes. because of how stupid that idea is. It would be utterly impossible to get a license for a killer if it could be retracted at a later date.
---
Swf is a category? Even if the game prevented party chat on console, people would use other ways to communicate. It’s not cheating to speak to people while you play. It seems like such an unnecessary thing to bitch about at this point in the game. Swf isn’t going anywhere, and using coms isn’t cheating.
---
I can tell
---
He's good. I used to main him for 600 hours. Great at stalling the game out and would farm points like crazy.
---
"Guess I'll die....."
---
In the long run, I think it’s easier to play against the plague when you deny her the usage of her power.
---
if u couldnt communicate with ur friends while playing a game what is even the point. Also if u have ever been in the dbd discord the are literally voice channels for swf lmao.
---
For this exact reason I also love HybridPanda
---
We already knew the date and yours is wrong anyway it's the 18th
---
I wanna buy spirit specifically for haunted grounds seems like a great perk
---
Isnt the point of playing SWF is to communicate with your friends in the first place? Even if it "wasnt allowed" the devs cant really tell their player base that they can absolutely NOT communicate with fellow survivors at all during gameplay.  But i guess we've been cheating this whole time.. 😒
---
TAKE MY MONEY
---
I volunteer Jabba the Hutt as a gues character that's a survivor with one of his perks being the ability to enslave one female survivor on your team and another perk is makin the killer fall in a random rancor Pitt
---
I'm like the shittiest player and this still happens
---
*procedes to screenshot the post match chart and proudly makes a reddit post about it*
---
Then just kill yourself on the hook
---
I’ve only had this worked once. Rescue a guy get him to follow me do gen. Finish gen someone is hooked rescue them do gens. Survivor four pops a gen gets chased. My posse finishes two. 
---
End game: everyone but me hooked I go around rescuing and healing
---
We all escape. 
---
Wish I recorded it
---
If it's a Trapper in the basement, you can assume there's atleast 2 armed traps nearby.
---
Same here, i was supposed to be r12 but it didnt change. Sometimes the game wont save and disconnect and id lose all the bp i obtained in the last match.
---
&gt; The closest thing to actually fighting the killer.
---
I think you're forgetting about the pebble
---
I agree and this is why I want Dead by Daylight 2.
---
The game need massive upgrades to performance and graphics and the game play is simplistic almost to the point of hurting the game. This game already randomizes the map so it shouldn't be a surprise why I want there to be multiple possible escape objectives the game randomly selects for the survivors and a larger variety of killer win conditions and interactions.
---
This is the one thing F13 has DBD beat in (other than graphics).
---
I guess so, i mean we are getting the killer Ghostface soon so it is still getting content.
---
But then again, hooks are so close to each other, you usually don't get the wiggle bar that far. So when you do but the hook vacuum fucks up your grasp escape, it *is* kinda frustrating
---
Ive been reading and i find it hilarious that youre complaining about swf communicating with each other and saying that its "cheating". If thats the case then most players that play with friends on this game have been "cheating" for a long time now. Even if it is considered "cheating", do you really think the devs are gonna try and stop people from communicating with each other? I doubt it.
---
You should watch the VOD of his Doki Doki stream, it's a goldmine
---
Holy fuck, thank you so much for linking this again. I didn't check when the livestream would start in my timezone and just clicked the link to see it starts in less than 20 minutes. You just made my day a lot better :D
---
And aww, I missed the comment from the person that was apparently trying to flame me :(
---
Killers that are skilled can easily sweep a SWF team of 4.
---
Its because the hook animation begins while the bar gets full. So technically the hook was first.
---
I appreciate the fact that you’re the only person to read/answer the post. The fact that devs are that desperate for players that they’d screw over 1/5 of a potential player base is an indicator that I probably shouldn’t support them.
---
PainReliever too, maybe? I like his videos a lot
---
Guy who's so toxic he's been banned multiple times by the devs for abusing bugs to troll killers and telling his fans to be toxic too.
---
He's also allegedly asked for nudes from underaged fans, but again, that's only allegedly afaik.
---
His videos are just clips his fans send in mixed with a few of his own, mostly of either bugs or survivors bullying killers.
---
Borderlands is a much better grind than this game tbh.
---
*laughs in possible blood warden play*
---
I literally showed how it’s cheating in the OP. Your only reasoning for how it’s not cheating is how it’s paradoxically so common, which is a circular failure by the devs, that it must not be cheating.
---
Now that I 100% agree with
---
Just open the exit gates. If you fail, then just die. A suicide button is pointless just because there's a few assholes who would like to slug you for fun.
---
I believe you but I would like to know the details of what's going on with this one.
---
adept killer achievements can eat my ass why can't they be easy as survivor
---
Honestly the devs might have already noticed people liking the setting and Carl so they might add it in later as either in a free chapter or paid dlc
---
What do you mean "need"? He looks like Ace and we already have Ace.
---
post
---
I don’t disagree, but why the killers have to try hard?  Why are SWF given an unfair advantage over 4 player solo players and killers alike?
---
Can you link me his apology?
---
Do you have those screenshots?
---
You don't see the issue with this? Billy has absolutely no downside and the downside that ur telling us is basically applicable to every other killer in the game but unlike billy they don't punish you with an instadown if there's no more pallets.   
---
Killers like Legion, Freddy, Clown etc all would need to have ridiculous powers to come even close to billy's level.   
---
If you wanted to bring the other M1 killers close to Billy's level you'd need to give them instadowns that are more easy to get than his chainsaw, clown's finger would need to be baseline and even then he'd probably still be weaker than instasaw billy just due to sheer missing map-pressure. On the other hand such changes would absolutely mess up lower skilled survivor and kill the game.   
---
We need this game to have less of a skillgap, not more. This is why we need more pallets but the pallets need to be unloopable, this is why windows need to be blocked earlier and ridiculous loops need to be nerfed to shreds.   
---
If you bother to play with casual survivors they basically face an empty field of missing pallets until they realize they're supposed to EXPLOIT the killer acceleration on loops and run to braindead near infinite loops.
---
The claudettes with the darkest outfits they can wear and with purple flashlights, and the usual perk loadout.
---
You make a pretty valid point. Killers are tired of super hard matches and survivors want to play with their friends. That's the big issue. A lot of people say it's fair and that the percentage for 4 man swf is actually low but even a two man can tear you up. I run into a couple of groups everytime I play killer. People that play swf a lot wont admit that they play better with friends than solo. So who knows if we should allow it or not in ranked matches. Most people here have a biased opinion so I'm trying to be as unbiased as I can about it.
---
Thanks man :D
---
More like girls crying of survivor wasting pallets.
---
Yeah. We were unable to get past him.
---
German is not a race..?
---
Killer: "Toxic survivors teabagging me whole match" 
---
Survivors:
---
"Hi"
---
"Heal me please"
---
"Wait I'll heal you"
---
"Sorry for missing skill check"
---
"Thanks"
---
Now that's toxic
---
This is genuinely fucking funny and I hope this gets more upvotes
---
The hatch literally cannot spawn on the top floor of The Game map, BTW
---
I know this might sound weird, but the best thing to do is slug them (unless downed right next to a hook)
---
Yes, they can get back up, but it still takes a decent amount of time. They have already wasted a lot of time sabotaging hooks. Dead Hard is typically their only method of escape and being 1-hit downs makes chases naturally shorter than usual.
---
He's different... farms BP like a boss and he's  (for me) pretty stress free killer. It's easy to find people and if they aren't smart with pallets, he's effective. 
---
I just really like to play as him... can't stand playing against him.
---
As I said, the games map design and weak killers need to be looked at first, before we go nerfing strong killers, if the strongest killer red ranks have is, say, Michael myers level, I doubt that'll go down well in the community in the games current state
---
 Also I'm curious, why do you think Billy needs a nerf, but not spirit, she's argued as a top tier killer, and I personally struggle to face a good spirit over a good Billy.
---
Best Plague counter is to not cleanse and loop and gen rush. She become strong just with Corrupt Purge, without it she is just a M1 killer. Now, this strategy is hard to do in solo, it all depends if your teammates also don't want to cleanse, if your teammates cleanse, your better cleanse too, so you can tank 2 hits of Corrupt Purge, instead of 1.
---
But if you have teammates who don't cleanse, you better not cleansing too, so you don't screw them over.
---
wait a second
---
And she's a great killer also.
---
Friday was so fun before the lawsuit such a damn shame it was getting to become a great game
---
"but I needed those 5 seconds to do other things, like playing Wraith!"
---
Nah but it's legit pretty annoying
---
This is so true I think we have all been in a painful game where there are like three gens left all near each other and you can’t finish one even if a survivor gets hooked. I learned that method from experience VERY quickly after I realized I was just making it harder for everyone by not spacing my gens lol
---
Doc should be in annoying AF or fun police tbh, I love him but holy hell is he oppressive to survivors if he is good
---
Regardless the basement is the other way.
---
The simplest answer is devs don't see voice chatting as cheating. Since they make the rules of their game, they decide what is fair. In not making voice chat a bannable cheating offense they are consciously deciding that voice chat is not unfair in their game.
---
I told I won't like that video... But it's a Monto's video, so I did :[
---
I had a game where I couldn't mori my obsession with rancor, most likely a bug tho
---
thank you! I had no idea lol
---
It's been pretty obvious the devs have been balancing for SWFs, though. Playing solo is nigh impossible nowadays.

&gt; Clown isn't high tier 
---
Uh... who said he is?
---
As a really new player (got the game last week during free weekend) I found that looking away from generator makes all the confusing gen sounds much less distracting. The higher is the progress, the more it sounds like terror, at least to my noob ears, and I am way less stressed if I hear less of it and don't fuck up skill checks (I mostly only fuck up when I feel pressure). So I try to assume position that will make me look away from generator and at the same time look at possible direction of killer.
---
How legit is my observation? Is it just noob problem to confuse some sounds for something else?
---
Dude im sick of toxic killers, but we ha e to just try and deal with it
---
Didnt some Russian dude copyright the SCP Foundation?
---
Cool

lets just add a disabled survivor while we're at it for representation

Wake up! (From my dream) :(
---
Potatoes grow in any rank
---
You contradict yourself unfortunately; they aren’t desperate for players, yet they pander to group play at the detriment of solo players. They balanced the game for no voice communication, which stands today, yet encourage players to gain an advantage unfairly.
---
I’m fine with SWF.  I’m fine with voice chat in games.  I’m not fine with cheating being encouraged by the developers.
---
Just don't feed him
---
Oh dear.
---
The No Mames shirt has me dead 😭😭
---
Pig op
---
Rip :(
---
The game isn't balanced around high ranks.
---
How did they nerf it? I haven’t used one in ages
---
buckle up
---
Help me, WGLF, Plunderer's instinct and Ace in the Hole - the ultimate farming build.
---
It's 7 years iirc.
---
It COULD be a crutch for a bad killer, that doesn't mean that it IS a crutch in 90% of cases. If you split the BP gain and the aura reading, people would take the bloodpoint perk every time.
---
It's a convenient effect on a perk that doubles the value of most matches, that doesn't mean that someone using it is reliant on the secondary effect.
---
Tbh though it might go pretty good in tandem with it...that and run like hell would prolly honestly synergize with no mither in a rather good way since you basically get iron will without iron will
---
I thought the patch was that it can't be done in like the middle of the stairs or some shit
---
Nah next modes just gonna be ash killing the killers
---
what tiny rez is this?
---
This is the good kind of cringe.
---
"We're happy to announce the Phantasm chapter! No new killer nor survivor will be included in this chapter, but we put gravestones on the Crotus Prenn tileset."
---
Majority of killers even didn't care about Legion, except Legion mains.

Rank 1 killer running NOED Spirit and admitting to deranking.  Super weak dude.

Tru3"not so"Ta1ent"ed".

Because Texas Chainsaw Massacre is fucking awesome.
---
You seem intoxicated, considering you’re referring to typos that aren’t present as well as arguing for and against the same thing in the same sentence.
---
True Ta1ent is good aswell
---
Not really contradicting, because they added something that was heavily requested isn't so much as being desperate. It was dumb of them to design the game around that way to be honest.
---
I wouldn't call it cheating, and I wouldn't say "Cheating is encourage" by the developers. Can word it how ever you want by saying its unfair, but almost any PvP-ish game feels unfair when going against a organized group lol.
---
Main issue here I think is, alot of older perks were designed around the older philosophy on how the game should be played. I dont think any of the newer perks are balanced around with that old thinking in mind. Though I could be wrong and be forgetting about perks. But seems they have just drifted away from that and haven't really touched on the old perks at all.
---
All though you speak the truth you shall be banished for reasons i will come up with later

[Peanits referred to him as Carl the Cashier in the reddit thread for the trailer](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/buf0ul/dead_by_daylight_ghost_face_trailer/epc79vb/).
---
His chainsaw shouldn't be able to go through a Gen in my opinion. 
---
Lots of hit box issues in this game - similar with all the hatchets going through everything.
---
You see the survivors I get? When I play survivor, right, my teammates just crouch around and get killed, but when I play killuh, I always get these amazing CO-ORDINATED SWF bully teams. It's so fookin' annoying.
---
Completely agree. I tried to get Clown after the change but I suck as Clown so that won't happen.
---
Rin initially still needs 2 hits on you. she can't get a lucky snipe. only lucky pull off the gen/totem but on red ranks that happens WAAAAY less than anywhere else. plus it's completely broken these days, it will hit survivors instead of pulling off. to that also sounds are fucked and scratch marks. you can easily counter her phasing with mindgames and prediction. as a Rin-second-main, i find her not hard AND fun to play against. would prefer to face her any day over Billy or Nurse or Hitboxtress. looping is fukin boring, i honestly don't understand how people still enjoy it. 
---
she's not overpowered too. her phasing has limits, her base speed is 110, she can't see blood or you while using ability. which Billy still can do at the same time having 115 speed and unlimited charge of speed. he's less maneuverable, true, but it doesn't matter cause of his insane chainsaw hitbox. Nurse also has weird lunge there.  don't get me started on hatchets. 
---
Rin is perfectly balanced. you just need more than simple looping to counter her. 
---
\&gt; As I said, the games map design and weak killers need to be looked at first, before we go nerfing strong killers, if the strongest killer red ranks have is, say, Michael myers level, I doubt that'll go down well in the community in the games current state 
---
op specifically said devs won't put any killer on Nurse/Billy level. they both are mistakes and need serious changes. 
---
the only good example of buff is Hag at this point. BUT do not forget facing a team of good players with at least one flashlight is a gamechanger, man. no clicky clicky will save a team from Billy or Nurse. so see? they can't just afford making all killers real strong. cause then shitstorm from survivor mains' side and they are the majority. nerfing Nurse or Billy will make a shitstorm from smol pp killer mains who like the ez win. so op here is completely right, bit pathetic from dev's side to not smooth out good old Sally and Max.
---
playing Rin is much harder than Billy. even when you learn to be a god with her, which i did before they fucked sounds :c, facing good players who realize you can't see them phasing and can't go through walls will crash you. and you have no inbuilt instadown or ability to travel whole map in few seconds.
---
Quick get the melting stick
---
Dying light &amp; Slippery Meat
---
He is low-mid tier. His anti loop power is a joke against good survivors and his range is also a joke without add-ons.
---
No, nerfing these two is a terrible idea. What should happen is the other killers need to be buffed to their level. 
---
If you can’t escape billy you’re playing wrong. Adapt your play style based on the killer, don’t ask for the game to be adapted to you.
---
If they’re balancing for SWF, then why don’t allow they me to save perk spots that can just be revealed over voice chat, wasting the slot?  Also, somehow, why aren’t they magically prevented from being told exactly where I am/where I’ve put traps down if I’m in sight?
---
I’m almost certain if they allowed filtering of SWF, the rarity of the two groups would entirely switch.
---
Well Identity V has a blind survivor so...
---
For Killers, bad manners are (for some people) face camping, hitting survivors on the hook, placing themselves in your camera and nodding while you die, body blocking in the basement, bringing you to the hatch or exit gate to mori you, now they drop you and wait the entire EGC timer so the entity can stab you.
---
For survivors, bad manners are T-bagging, flashlight clicking, animation locking other survivors in lockers, body blocking other survivors in a corner, pointing and t bagging at someone on the hook, etc etc.
---
The list goes on, people are just shitty lol
---
I will wait patiently.

---
Im not intoxicated, i see you corrected yourself, good job! And how am i arguing for AND against the same thing, my point is communicating over voice chat isnt cheating, period. Get over yourself. Communication doesnt lead to wins, gameplay does, you can talk all you want with teammates, but if your gameplay is bad all that communication or "cheating" in your sense is for nothing? So why do you keep complaining about the same thing? Just because you have a problem with voice communication doesnt mean the devs are gonna bring the ban hammer and ban more than half of their player base for "cheating using outside communications"
---
Okay, hate to toot my horn, but I may be the only guy so far who's noticed that it says "Lery's Memorial Institution" in the first panel.
---
he can be looped just like any other killer who either needs to work for instadown(Michael) or has no instadown whatsoever(Trapper, Freddy, Wraith..etc)? COOL! as if he doesn't rev his saw same speed as survivors run so not every loop is a damn counter. as if he doesn't get Bloodlust there. as if he can't break a pallet with that rev faster than normal break. as if he can't travel from one side to another faster than Nurse or Spirit completely removing ability to escape his BBQ snipe if you were unlucky to be around fukin nothing. 
---
windows will force something? fukin come at me, bro! i've been downed by instasaw Billies through windows cause of their weird fukin lunge when i was at least 1.5 meters away from it after vaulting.  and myself doing Adept Billy and few times his stupid dailies the chainsaw is god damn easy. i only play on red ranks. i played Billy less than 3 hours in total. even i, a forever m1 Freddy main, can handle that ugly mofo ez and it is the reason i don't play him. he gives way to easy results and i like double pip and game that lasts over 5 minutes, ok? to master Freddy i spent 300 hours. i literally sense his glimpsing, i know how to apply pressure. i needed a week for Rin. two weeks for proper trapping as Trapper and also around a week with Hag after rework. Billy takes no time to learn. only extra rare REALLY fukin good loopers fucked my games with him. everything else was ez. and i didn't even use ruin.
---
I'll just stick to watching people with insidious legion if there's no carl, same thing baicscaly,
---
WAZZAAA
---
I guess it's just personal preference. I hate facing spirit, I find her just to be incrediblly unfun for me, as it feels like I'm just tossing a coin to see if I  survive or not. Billy I can counterplay if I'm good enough, but if billy is better, he can outplay me. Again, nurse does need changes down the road, I agree, but Billy doesn't need touching.
---
How would you nerf him anyway? If you make him 110%, he can zoom around the map, sure, but then at pallets or gyms he's completely fucked, if you nerf the power of his chainsaw somehow, such as making it apply deep wound or some shit, their is literally no point in using it then. Hillbilly should be the standard of killer power, and my opinion won't change on that.
---
On top of that, it won't spawn anywhere without solid ground beneath it (except killer shack with the basement in it). So things like top floor houses in lampkin arent eligible for a spawn either.
---
Never group up, play as stealthy as you can, and if she’s chasing you try to break LoS and run beyond loops once LoS is broken instead of running in the loop; the Nurse will win standard loops 99% of the time.
---
What a cringy video
---
I don't understand what gen rushing is, like sabotaging is temporary and the only time it's worth going for totems is if there is hex so is there ever something else to do besides looping and doing gens
---
....you really think there will be any number of people upset by this video?
---
i don't ask for more than rev speed change and limitations on chainsaw sprint.
---
If there was an option to filter SWF, Behaviour would be shooting themselves in the foot. 
---
I don't understand what you are trying to say in the first half of your comment, though.
---
"Are we the baddies?"
---
I know that feel. I usually ask them to stop, complimenting the killer and making it clear i'm not with them. Even worse, when I'm in a SWF and my "friends" start doing this, i'll turn against them and sometimes even unfriend.
---
Unless the killer was really toxic ofc.
---
I’m not going to argue with an illiterate.  You’ve already proven you hasva failure in reading comprehension on multiple counts.

good on ya dude this game is fun as hell also can make you want to shoot yourself but yeah

No it isn’t

Im scared and confused :(

BHVR is going easy on Dwight to hopefully get him out of a locker for the promise of BPs
---
i'm trying to analyze if everything you wrote is a joke or not
---
&gt;Also if you're facing a hillbilly and he seems to be zooming right to you, why aren't you hiding in lockers when he picks people up? Lockers are incredibly effective for countering BBQ
---
cause not every time you're around any lockers? as i said, no other killer can abuse this aura reading as good as Billy. well, they can't abuse it at all. it only pinpoints the location for them, not gives direct fukin target. 
---
&gt;Why should hillbilly be even slower when charging his chainsaw? Leatherface is shit because he slows down to a crawl with his chainsaw and can't really use it like hillbilly.
---
cause... balance? why Rin can't initially see blood and has to use pink add-on for it? she's not going through walls, can't vault windows, can't break pallets with m2. ya know. B A L A N C E
---
Fuck it, I’m hype

I got this glitch too!
---
Never underestimate pussy killers.

Seeing as how boil over exists, vacuums are probably here to stay
---
The steps to the basement move away from the wall towards the center of the map. The basement is entirely under the cowshed and doesn't go past it's border. It's not my fault you don't know the map.
---
No they don’t?
---
Nah check my gamertag out for proof Mr Perfect Game
---
What? All I see is Level 20
---
But good PC killers don’t get spun on, whereas good console killers are still vulnerable to one.
---
And legion mains only cared because it was basically a free win before if you were even semi competent with them (or at the very least a pip even now I got a double pip with 3 kill legion)
---
Because he brutally outshines every other killer in every way possible and we cannot in general nerf survivors while nurse/hillbilly are untouched.
---
Awww now trying for insults? Danng i sense a bit of saltiness. I guess since youre "done" have fun whining to everyone else over something youve got no control over. 👍👍😁
---
lmao 
---
"gg ez Vietnam soldier git gud at killing infants"
---
Yeah, pretty much.
---
It’s not possible on a large majority of maps now but this one and also The Thompson House basement can still be blocked as the entrance is too small.
---
Or crouched in the hook vicinity, watching you die instead of doing gens.
---
Looks like he's standing in the door way not the stairs.
---
Its a shame that if they removed collision hitboxes while you could be able to play the game without assholes ruining it, key parts like body block would no longer exist
---
Wtf is this
---
Noed can be removed before it can be activated, With Hext spawns you're lucky to get a single down before it gets found and destroyed. It's not unbalanced Survivors are just too lazy to put in a few extra minutes of work and prevent it.
---
This killer player is stupid.
---
1) 100% extra BP, in a build that allows only 2 tier ups, no or almost no hooks, short chases and little to no hits? You get 10 to max 18k bloodpoints. So much wasted potential, you could get 22 to 30k in other builds.
---
2) that plague gen perk plus ruin? Bad combo. Not doing gens for a minute gives them time to seagch for ruin.
---
3) play with your food is almost a must pick for these addons.
---
Dude, you should've played killer in that time and then come back and tell me how you liked to have absolutely no chances to catch survivors, no matter how good you are.
---
Oh you bet your ass I'll butt dance against campers.
---
I was trying to get my two teammates to leave through the hatch with me (one guy died, 1 gen left) by t-bagging and using the follow me/come here emote. They both ignored me so I decided fuck 'um, then I watched them die in spectator mode.
---
I don't think eating soap will help you at all
---
And yet deals like that are made all the time. Weird. Regardless of how stupid the idea is, that's actually the reality some times. It's not like I came up with the idea, so stop thinking of it as an attack on you.
---
No, I said you can keep whinging if you want. It's all right up there, if you can read.
---
aww they're in love
---
Quit this forced gay crap. Is there any evidence that both Dwight and David even have homosexual tendencies? Why isnt there any Kate/Meg ships then, or ect. Always gotta be two dudes. Call me a homophobe, but I dislike forced ships of any kind whether it be fm, mm, or ff. If neither are showing signs of homosexual tendencies, then its forcing a reality that wont happen. If they are, I apologize, and continue with the shipping.
---
The fuck are you talking about? Freddy and clown are literally m1 killers that have powers that "barely do anything", Billy is an actual non m1 killer that has a power that can actually change the game. Honestly man go fuck yourself with the pc elitist bullshit as well, console players have just as much right to a good game as pc players
---
He DC's when he's about to lose, so he never loses /s
---
Freddy is LITERALLY the weakest killer in the game.
---
Save It For Marriage So You Don't Go To Hell #TrueFact
---
The downvote was completely unnecessary.  So was the unwarranted sarcasm.  All I wanted to do was make a suggestion, because I thought it would be a neat improvement.
---
What a SJW champ.
---
Took me a while to figure it out too, but then it hit me, making cringey content is what I was BORN to do.
---
Devour Hope
---
I needed this after getting my 3rd Lery's in 5 games earlier today. I struggle enough hitting chainsaws as Billy when not on that god awful map.
---
Nurse with range add-ons and Spirit with Prayer Beads HEAVILY disagree with you. 
---
But seriously man, all of those perks have counters, so I don't see why you call that build OP. 
---
Maybe Tinkerer doesn't have a counter, but you only need to pay attention to not get surprised by the 0 terror radius.
---
Icon would still change instantly on unhook as the perk only talks about the notification.
---
People stopped using it because you don't get more tokens, so if you're against a killer running an aura build or a freddy then your fucked because it gets used up 2 minutes into the game.
---
Someone seems a bit heated, normally i would take this moment to add more fuel to fire as i believe getting heated over a game or argument is kinda childish but i won't as i will admit that i poorly worded my last statment.
---
I should have said something along the lines of "some of the most poorly mechanical designed killers"
---
Dont get me wrong, i love the theme of freddy all the way, but what he essesintly is, is an M1 killer with extra steps and more counters only for a passive ability that slows down survivors.
---
As for consoles, i believe that they could be close in containing most of dead by daylights playerbase consider that the game now exist on three diffrent console platforms. And thus, for that reason should be cared for almost as much as Pc
---
I used to watch him nearly everyday, but after reading some comments on here, I realised how arrogant and how full of himself he actually is, how he cannot take a loss, and how he says his opinion like it’s a fact, I started watching other dbd streamers who are less serious and I feel much better when watching bc he takes the game way too seriously, like he does give some good advice/tips though
---
&gt; there’s a reason so many people run it.
---
Yeah, for the double bp every match. The game is a grind, if you think more people run BBQ for the shitty aura reading than they do for the incredible bonus BP then idk what to say to you.
---
Bahahahahah - this is too real
---
Give us Carl
---
Let me correct you, don't you DARE to forget that our Lord and Saviour, Ash Williams is here
---
Soooo goooood yesss
---
absolutely not, survivors need a reason to fear dc's if you play like an asshole or have shitty lag that a killer doesnt want to play with, thats on you, not to mention, killers hardly get shit if a survivor dc's so why should you care, if youre worried about points you clearly havent played enough
---
I'm not your "bud", and what I do in my personal time has nothing to do with you.  Trying to give "life advice" to someone you neither know nor care about is just backhanded insults.
---
I understand just fine.  It's not about understanding or not, it's that you don't seem to realize this behavior is unacceptable, nor is it warranted.
---
,mmmm... Yum
---

Jesus Christ bro give it a rest. I wasn’t actually saying that you need to have sex more, it’s an internet joke when some seems really tense and high strung. You need to chill out man and learn how to take a joke. You called me the SWJ but you’re the snowflake.
---
Did the same thing with Amanda's Letter, it feels so good.
---
I just saw 74k people playing at the same time from steam statistics about 3 days ago
---
Cheating is punishable. Are devs punishing people for using comms? No.
---
Yes please!
---
We can see your edits...
---
Didn't mean to imply that you tunnel, a lot of people tend to do this though
---
Ps: dead hard isnt op, and is actually a pretty bad perk
---
We're prous to announce the freddy rework, here are his following patch notes
---
Dream transition increased by 2 seconds
---
Surviors can now wake them selves up
---
You look extra spooky to awake survivors
---
If they are farming each other fine, but the whole point is to apply pressure to the whole map so unless youve seen them doing this there isnt much point to camp.
---
Aww so your friends give you money? Thats sweet of them
---
If the devs consider it cheating, why haven't they fixed it then? Or maybe because no one considers it cheating?
---
Erm.... Hangmans trick.
---
The amount of times I've told myself I have 8 IQ after making an obvious mistake because of Monto's influence is too much to count.
---
Probably but oh well its no longer a free escape the horror. I didnt mind hatch but this change makes it a lot better and at least means the survivor has to earn there hatch escape
---
Why would you ruin such a beautiful game by playing on shitty consoles? This makes no sense
---
You can reflect on how much time you have invested onto the game and consider going outside before purchasing ghostface and doing it all over again
---
there are two types of people in this world
---
:( I like it though
---
More power to you my friend
---
why do you guys think adrenaline is so good? it only helps for the last 20 or so secs of the match. I'd rather pick a perk that I can use (more often) the entire game..
---
I see it on nearly every survivor nowadays
---
Bye.
---
*I felt a great disturbance in the Entity's realm, as if millions of killer mains suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened.*
---
Carl new survivor?
---
dARN
---
&gt; Or every hook increases Blood web rarity for 1 hour
---
What? Would you get a bloodwebs of ultra-rares only after 12 hooks game?
---
&gt; Perhaps every hook reduces pallets by 1 2 4 and 6
---
So by the time I get my 4th BBQ stack there are no pallets on the map. Not OP at all...
---
Y I K E S
---
I mean it's great that you have never practiced, but a decent nurse with no addons is still the strongest killer. Also if you did have 5 blinks, you would find even with no skill you can't not hit a survivor.
---
Why do that when mom is gonna be reworked soon?
---
If you're getting that many hate messages every time you play you must be playing in a pretty scummy way. Have you played as survivor to experience how disheartening it is to be slugged the whole game or camped &amp; tunnelled? When I play killer I've never had anything but nice messages. I don't find it fun to 'Sweat for the 4k' as people say, I play for points. I go into every match hoping to get 12 hooks, never camp or tunnel people. Everyone has a fun game &amp; gets lots of points.
---
Tokyo Drifitng wheel chair survivor when?
---
Thanks for the advice bro. It's nice to see a bit of advice even though half of the people on this sub thinking I'm trolling.
---
I've had that response several times but never ended up on the subreddit. Sad times
---
PLEASE LOOK UP
---
So having a SWF filter for killers, so half the playerbase wouldn't be able to almost ever in a game would be a good move. Okay. Werk.
---
It is, there is a small button to the right of chat.
---
If you hit that, you won't see chat anymore untill you enable it again
---
That happens sometimes. From what I’ve seen, the survivor and killer working together do it for more bloodpoints. Basically an unfair way of farming. It’s a shame really
---
Thanks bro. That's actually really helpful for when I hit rank 15+. You can go down instantly in this game or am I reading that wrong?
---
Those are some really good perk ideas!!!  
---
(though I'd leave out the last bit for No Refunds, 100% guaranteed flashlight multiple times is a bit much)
---
Are they gonna punish more than half their player base for using party chats/discord chats? No. They knew about party chat systems when they released the game on xbox and Playstation.
---
Does it work for multiple games though ? I was thinking more of a global option. Then if it is, why do people complain ? XD just block it and play your game peacefully, while slashing all the SWF around
---
Tbh I thought you were trolling, it was only when I seen you put in the comments about level 20 and then I was like ahhhh yeah I know why you’re so good at the game and you only just got it

---
Rob zombie doesnt own the rights to his micheal. The studio does. They had a 3rd script and they kicked rob out and before production with new people it was cancelled. Other than that the lf remake skin would probably be super easy to obtain. They reboot Tcm once every few years.
---
Because it is the safest pallet to loop in the game, the killer has to break it or they will literally never catch you.
---
Free, no
---
But with the amount of dlc it should be less than £30 which is what i originally bought it for, 2 years back
---
Then again, Myers in evil within 1 is immune to ALL detection perks, making it useless against a peekaboo Myers
---
The only time id ever do this is if that survivor was a major dickhead the whole match, otherwise I agree. Its just a waste of time.
---
Get a PS2.
---
Get the first two Shadow Hearts games. 
---
Play through them. 
---
You will become a god at skill checks in general.
---
It's basically just learning how to hit the button slightly before the needle actually hits where you want it to land. For now, try aiming for the areas with good skill checks, and keep your camera focused on darker areas where possible, makes it easier to see the white outline of where you have to hit. 
---
Rage Quits are pretty common, unfortunately, the community is full of people who simply don't give a shit and cannot handle...well, a great deal of things. Getting hit, getting found, getting hooked, getting downed...
---
Dcs are common until you learn the game more expect it and just ignore any salty messages.
---
I'm hoping I can stay "good" at the game tbh and learn more so when I hit that skill gap, it won't be as hard to play.
---
As I said in my first comment
---
Camping ≠ patrolling
---
No idea why you're talking about facecamping
---
I wish I could see that player's reaction, I'm sure pants were shat.
---
Plunderer's Instinct
---
This happens so much, I swear. Just let me tell the killer that they played well you salty jerks. &gt;:( I love telling killers my Pov of a chase that was fun, and when they spooked me, but people do this and the killer leaves before we can share. It's not fun!
---
How exactly can you be certain it’s haunted grounds though...?
---
He’s been like that since the game came out. He just can’t accept that he’s really bad.
---
Say if your other totems are broken, or you only have haunted grounds in a build
---
&gt; I used to only watch him here and there but after watching his longer form videos or some of his more recent videos he sounds REALLY arrogant a lot of the time.
---
I watched a bunch of DBD youtubers, him included, for quite some time now, and while he always had that "its a toxic swf" attitude, and used to have one of those classic killer only attitudes towards survivors with his complaints towards chat, at least he used to be somewhat cheerful and seemed motivated. 
---
His new vids just seem bad in comparison. Hes rather arrogant now, even to his own chat, his favourite complaint nowadays seem to be something along the line of "Look at this high level of play from the survivors i have to play against, and then look at the survivors i have to play with! Why cant i have survivors like this in my team!" The worst was when he kept himself in the 10 ranks. Listening to him wonder why "that huntress uses shit perks, and not even all are level 3, and  why that single trash addon?" Probably because, as i can testify myself, you can get to rank 10 with almost no time played, i have 3 teachables unlocked and am rank 10. He went sealclubbing there for a while and wondered why everyone was playing bad/with bad addons perks. Dude has 5000+ hours. At least hes back to purple.
---
I guess he simply doesnt enjoy the game anymore after 5000 fucking hours, and thats no surprise. Doesnt change that his videos are now of much poorer quality.
---
Oh shit I’m dumb I thought this was from the perspective of another survivor
---
One could say the same thing about this overdone and unoriginal post format.
---
*legion dabs*
---
Just constantly moans about the game and how it's broke for him. Ahah
---
Eurobeat intensifies
---
The man with a sexy voice
---
This was neither educational, nor civil.  It would appear you are looking in the mirror and preaching at yourself.
---
You accuse me of replying immediately.  Maybe I was just not done browsing, this session, and there was a glaring notification that yet another troll was trying to take their pound of flesh.
---
I have less karma because I have better things to do than to try watching my points like the stock market.
---
You haven't "made repeated attempts to cool off the conversation".  All you've done is try to drop walls of text to justify your unnecessary behavior.
---
All I want for Christmas is my Rob Zombie Michael skin
---
Old Man Myers - deffo, but I would kill to have a Halloween '18 Laurie skin too. New pieces for Survivor Quentin - my current project/favourite - would be lovely as well.
---
He's just not fun to watch. Constant  complaining with no entertainment
---
Not bad for the beginning, the logo turned out pretty well! I would recommend making the black darker and more consistent tho, makes a nicer contrast. Also if you like working with white, consider getting drawing paper with a different color, like besch. That way the white areas can make awesome highlights! Of course you need a white pencil aswell\^\^
---
Nurse sure. Billy is fine
---
I don't understand why Pig crouching walks at 94% speed, even slower than Nurse! What's the point other than mindgames at pallets? You can't chase crouched, you can't ambush gens because they can easily see and hear you. They should make her faster like nurse and reworl her add-ons to affect both traps and ambush at the same time (like Billy and Doctor add-ons)
---
i dont know 🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳
---
Woof
---
I just got Legion and I like him. But he is still to weak sadly. But I will still play him to level him up so I get his perks. And he can be fun. I play him with nurses calling so I hit everyone I see in frenzy and just wait for them to heal themself and hit them down
---
Not surprised you have no friends, tbh.
---
U just seem salty probably cause u got bullied by a swf, aura seeing perks only help u so much, if u have perks like spirits fury and bamboozle swf team comms cant counter that
---
How many fucking times will this get posted
---
We need him as a survivor. Period
---
Damn
---
Dedicated servers are coming. It will help o lot.
---
Game is the most balanced that before. At purple ranks, you can meet all killers. Idk how it is at red ranks, but i hope that Nurse/Hillbilly meta was changed.
---
Current biggest problems are DCs, but with dedicated servers it will be ok.
---
I think that game is fine. As solo survivor it is pretty hard, there are average 3-4 kills per match.
---
It's less glitch, but not perfect. 
---
Laggy is not about the game, it's about players' connection, so can't comment. 
---
And interest is a subjective thing, so only you can tell. We have more killers, more maps (although not enough), more cosmetics, but the gameplay is the same. If you were bored then, you will probably be bored now.
---
One word. Hitboxes 🙃
---
That’s really good to hear about the balancing. Was kind of frustrating seeing the same killers over and over haha. 
---
Can’t wait for the dedicated servers, do you know if there’s a rough date for that?
---
Thanks.
---
[that's why no one uses it](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/928/2YVQMEWUS0KN.jpg)
---
&gt; It will help o lot.
---
Nope, not a lot.
---
I see. I think I’ll give it a go again and hopefully it’ll spark the interest I had before. Thankyou for the reply.
---
Idk with the legion is mostly just the basic male version and that is not really that difficult to do compared to say a huntress cosplay. Hell been survivor cosplay could be considered harder because well legion has a mask so you really don’t need to look like him at all in that regard
---
Jake goes from a whiny baby to a stealth boi with this perk
---
Rule one of not being stupid, when the timer hits 30% you leave if someone goes down.
---
For future reference, Freddys thumb doesnt have a knife.
---
to this day I am still angry I cant make honk sounds with the clown...
---
Thanks!
---
Yes me neither. I mean im on Reddit.
---
I’ve played about 10 hours of killer in almost 550 hours so...
---
Camping and then wasting pallets.
---
That stops being fun pretty soon. 
---
When you are not getting your BBQ stacks, thus lower bloodpoints for you.
---
Or when you bring rare addons or offerings and lose them bwcause people DC.
---
Or when you just want to play a single game with a killer you enjoy, like legion or bubba, put people DC as soon as they notice you are not trash.
---
They see him sliding
---
I used to watch him cause I stupidly thought I may learn something from him. Instead all I learned was he's actually quite toxic to the game, the community and to an extent his wife. Like he's honestly a POS.
---
I just looked at it again and ya it seems it was removed wtf. Guessing that was not suppose to be shown lol
---
I know he's awful too his wife aswell! He really is toxic to the game not a good example to killers at all!
---
Well im still stuck at rank 13, the rank changes to 12 for a few minutes then it goes back to 13. I was supposed to be in rank 12 like 5 matches ago.
---
If you have a friend playing this game, you can start a Kill Your Friends game with them and try to complete a gen without anyone interrupting you. Get it to around 90%, tell your friend to kick it and then go for another one. You’ll git gut rather quickly.
---
Remember to try to land skillchecks as close to the beginning as possible for those greats. Once you find yourself reliably landing skillchecks, restart the game and ask your friend to take ruin with him.
---
Your friend will sadly just watch you doing stuff, so I’d suggest him to do something else and just come back to kick your gen every once in a while
---
You can literally stop noed from even prompting. You cant stop mom from activating
---
To add to this, when the killer is hook camping and teammates don't do gens. I can't stand seeing auras of teammates just standing or hiding when I'm slowly being sacrificed. Do something with that time!
---
"Reanimate you as a zombie" sounds great...doesn't work.
---
Power: worse Clown?
---
It Was Always You: Squadettes would love to see more killers using this perk
---
&gt; When you choose a Hex Totem, 6 others are marked
---
There're 5 totems total on the map. And how'd you "choose" a totem?
---
what is the source for the second picture
---
I don't think there'll be one since they are going to officially show Ghostface and they'll let us have a look at the Freddy Rework. Just use double BP perks :)
---
We need it for the Hag because Karens almost all are hags!
---
Yes also that, if me or someone is beeing camped. If you don't have borrowed time there's nothing you can do, at least make his or her death count
---
I often shut the hatch... BUT let them open the door if they weren’t a toxic pos.
---
Bricky is the man
---
Well, for all intents and purposes, it was indeed a rework, but calling it a nerf isn't *wrong*.
---
Healing against Legion, and cleansing against the plauge,
---
Something shitty as always.
---
I remember I watched my first reaction. Was a game trailer or something, think kh3. Girls started to break down crying while the other struggle to not tear up....it had so many likes to idk how
---
Survivor might know it’s one too. If you had a skillcheck, was hit already and see two hex totems being up
---
they aren't real dude chill your stroke
---
The gates and hatch are a different story. Gates definitely.
---
That's not the same as an in-game model. You'd be correct to say they have a design or concept of him, though.
---
He's an unstoppable force.
---
I've read every post in that thread, there isn't any of the information I was looking for which I find far more important than the text you linked and quoted. I'm already aware that a company can create and change their own terminology and seems to have done so here. I'm curious why, and what exactly does the change mean for us consumers because it has created some confusion.
---
BHVR actually created the "Paragraph" term as well and used it first during the developer streams for Bill when he launched and again with Leatherface. I can't seem to find any archives of the developer streams that far back anymore on twitch or YouTube, but I believe it was even said, I believe by Dave, that Paragraphs were meant to be smaller pieces of content than a full Chapter - implying a full chapter included a character for both sides and a map. Now that seems to have changed &amp; it's creating a bit of confusion.
---
What? I made a joking remark because you escalated for no reason, and then you go off on me. You started insulting people first, and then have the nerve to call others uncivil. Dude, take a chill pill and take a walk, you are way too riled up.
---
why isnt it the same? a model for him is created and rigged, as shown by the trailer. Why can’t they just import the asset into the game? Maybe theyd need to do some minor retexturing, sure, but from what i see its mostly done
---
The survivor I aspire to be 😩
---
Yes.
---
how mom was the only reason to buy him besides the character model and vo lol

i throw on mori's and kill them last :) i actually scared one twict streamer cause he probably though it was a cypress then i mori him, im now friends with that streamer.
---
Thanks man
---
Yeah, only killers can see it. But watch out for the perk “blood warden”. If someone is hooked while the exit gates are opened the perk activates and if both gates are opened both will be blocked for 30 seconds. It’s a good opportunity for killers to get survivors especially if they have NOED
---
Thanks homie

Thanks again, that helps a lot :D

Though I guess I'll have to catch it at another time as VOD then, will probably be busy using the time to further test out Deathgarden now that it's currently free.
---
smh guys we could have pretended that everything in the video was fine and the poster would actually think that he is high or some shit
---
Well you already know the outcome of asking people to watch your streams so why ask?
---
since i absolutely suck at survivor i never drop it except when it's endgame. I just let the good people use it.

I tried to do this as a trapper when a full team of swf gen rushed and switched place looping me the whole game (I started playing killer on Monday btw) but they still managed to rescue each other off hook and heal. Then when I met them at the exist gate, they were t-bagging and left when I decided to place traps instead of hitting them.
---
Removeddit and ceddit are a thing, you know? When I see deleted and removed comments I usually check to see what they say.
---
Just because I *was* uninvolved, doesn't mean I have to stay so. I didn't get involved for "shit shots", I was cracking a joke.
---
I did read the comments, and thought it was funny how you flipped out for no apparent reason.
---
If you truly wanted to be left alone you would block those you thought were trolls and stop replying.
---
I’m more exited by the fact the devs said they don’t keep all the eggs in one basket that could mean they have way more stuff that we have no way of knowing
---
Oink
---
As survivor I usually only cleanse once others have started. Have also got salty messages from other survivors for cleansing...
---
As plague I'm happy with either tactic.
---
Red puke? Nice
---
Everyone broken + easier to find? Also nice
---
I don't really know enough to discuss about all that. Even then, that's entirely up to if they want to do it or not, or if it's worth their time. If they do go through it, cool! If they don't, meh, I won't lose any sleep over it. 
---
That's a whole other can of worms, though. I should head to bed. Cheers!
---
I’m sorry but since 80% of my survivor games are against bubba I can’t love him

---
So fking true ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
get in lockers, hide behind gens, get within 48 meters, use it to make the killer think you're going the opposite way you actually are, there are so many ways to avoid or use that perk to your advantage anyone that comains about it is stupid unless a huntress is using it and in that case run for fucking cover
---
No one told me both adrenaline and dead hard got a massive buff
---
When looping the pallet I see the killer moon walk or change directions even though I can clearly see you by say if I’m looping a log or something. It’s like that’s not going to help you and is just going to give me even more loops
---
I wasn't around for it. IIRC the order addons instead made the random skill check placement happen, and his shock couldn't interrupt actions like vaults and pallet drops. Fake red stain also happened randomly with an addon which made it less helpful (Compared to at the start of a chase)
---
Me as killer trying to explain rank 20 survivors I wanna farm. 
---
Context: I just switched to PC and rank 20 is unbearable. I don't want to kill them, but it's really hard to convince them to do gens :D
---
Yeah fingers cross they have some goodies and some skins to show off. Biggest hope is that the map and cashier showed in the Ghost Face trailer are going to be their own semi-chapter/paragraph.
---
its behaviors choice, but alot of people want it and it would show behavior pays attention to the community, which is something they always need
---
I think they may have been waiting for a late hook save, not sure lol
---
So you should start playing more, to see how "fun" is to play killer.
---
So, basically, you're admitting to reading deleted comments, and then you're going to also admit to stirring up shit about posts that were already deleted?  Does that about sum things up?  You dug through deleted shit so you could stir up shit.
---
&gt;Just because I *was* uninvolved, doesn't mean I have to stay so.
---
Yeah, so, uhm, don't try to sling around comments like, "I was uninvolved", then go ahead and say you're involved.  One way or another, you got involved, tried to stir up shit over stuff that was already deleted, and you're trying to continue to ride the shit show by saying you were in the right to view deleted posts and reply based on what was already deleted.  Oh, and did I mention the posts were deleted?
---
And, no, I didn't flip out for no reason.
---
And there you have it--  you think it's funny that people get harassed, and you wanted in on the shitshow.
---
Bocking doesn't work, as it only breaks the browser.  Also, I don't have to suffer in silence.  Dumbass trolls like yourself like to take their cheap shit shots and hope the other person will walk away so you can get your free and easy win and continue stroking yourself off.
---
\&gt; I took a shot at you  
---
\&gt; You should walk away and let me win
---
and a mettle of man nerf in the same update as ghostface making him useless :P
---
I mean to be fair if they have no other place to go they may as well try
---
delete the game, and re install it
---
if this continues contact xbox support
---
I oddly enough like the mist thickening idea, though it would see almost no play unless mist itself was reworked to have more effect on gameplay.
---
When the shopping mall is the new map and the cashier is the survivor xxx
---
So, this community complains about toxic behavior and then upvotes this post
---
GlenOck approves
---
Nah he got nerfed , mend bar doesn't go down when you hit them twice in frenzy that's a Nerf for me
---
I see you’ve changed as a killer
---
It buys a LOT of time in the endgame. Whoever is getting chased gets an instant sprint burst and a health state, which is a crushing blow to most killers. It counters end-game slugging. It gets you to the Exit Gates faster. If you're on the hook, you get instantly healed when taken off + sprint burst. It saves 32 seconds that would be spent healing, so you can finish the last gen.
---
It's the ultimate perk. There's very little reason to not run it. Playing killer (at a decent rank) would help you understand why it's so good
---
If you have a newbie killer that refuses to give up a chase, this isn't entirely awful.  In mid to high ranks though... Oof.
---
Are you on xbox, and a high rank?
---
And remember kids, once the Killer is camping DO GENS AND DONT STAY THERE DOING NOTHING
---
Only if you do it repeatedly.
---
I could, so I did. I thought I was pretty 400 IQ.
---
Yep. And then I put him back to dying.
---
Survivor: ian malcom
---
Killer: velociraptor
---
Map: jurassic park visitor center
---
Its so dumb it might work.
---
He was mighty far away from the exit gates and the gens had JUST popped. Plus, he already used up Mettle and didn't have Dead Hard.
---
"Nothing... just chilling... killing..."
---
Who hasn't readied up yet!? lul
---
Oh shit I never saw that
---
Why not go all the way and bind crouching to mousewheel
---
Ian Malcolm as a survivor? Fuck yeah. Jurassic Park is horror adjacent anyway.
---
Why should i as a killer be afraid of survivors disconnecting because I used a perk/addon/offering/killer they don’t like? Disconnecting for any reason besides the game being laggy (even tho you have a ping indicator in the lobby but hey let’s not bring that up) automatically makes you more of an asshole than whatever the killer was doing. 
---
“survivors dont get shit if a survivor dc's so why should you get anything, “
---
Nobody here is saying that survivor shouldn’t also get something but this is a discussion about getting a stack for bbq not a discussion about survivors not getting anything from other survivors that DC. 
---
“ if youre worried about points you clearly havent played enough”
---
I’ve been playing since November 2016 and I’m still worry about the points because I still haven’t gotten every character to p3 50 and ghostface is right around the corner.
---
Chasing as Hag.
---
It's a Nerf I have played him a lot since the Nerf he is pretty much useless unless the survivors are trash.
---
If everyone just knew Morse Code, flashlights would be the best item.
---
What addons does it have
---
No one asked tho
---
You have 666 upvotes , I'm gonna downvote this to 665 so that anyone else can have the pleasure to upvote it to 666 again
---
Usually this tends to happen when more than 3 man swf groups queue, the queue usually takes much longer and pulls from all available killers instead.
---
Hmm, possibly lack of people around your rank or they fucked with the match making again. I’m rank 2 at the moment and had a couple random games with a rank 8 and 13 killer, rest were 3-5
---
You're welcome! Keep at it, if you're having fun then there is quite some potential :)
---
I always find it weird when people are proud about tunneling someone. The same as I don't understand what's so special about looping a low rank killer for the whole game.
---
I thought i was the only one who noticed
---
PS4. rank 3 killer I think?? And rank 9 survivor. Only really go on it lately if my mates are online
---
What am I meant to be noticing ?
---
I am not going to say it, is such an old joke, just ignore it......fine
---
I think the devs make a pretty good job so fa
---
This does put a smile on my face :)
---
Ohh. I’m on Xbox and like a rank 9 killer and a rank 3 survivor. I also only go on if my friends want to play.
---
I take at most 10 minutes to find a match. Then when I find one the killer disconnects.
---
he is more like Samwell Tarly from GoT than Chicken Man
---
*clicking noises intensify*
---
Honestly the easiest way to understand and get to know all the perks and things is to watch some helpful streamers, or even better is to watch Monto on YouTube, he does though all perks for different builds and explain what does what and how to use them
---
I saw this post about people being less evolved by saying: “hApPy cAkE dAy” but...
---
Happy cake day.
---
What they need is one universal account system so we can share our console / pc save games instead of doing the grind all over again and again
---
How i found your mother
---
Could be but when groups swf it’s usually against killers around the lowest players rank. 8 to 13 is a bit of a stretch so I assume lack of players or they fucked with matchmaking again
---
What time is the stream?
---
To me it feels a bit more detailed and provides more information, especially if the video is supposed to be a guide to something
---
Ok thank you . But I do prefer learning a game first hand though. But I will have a look
---
Legion was in no way a free win, he was on the bottom of the tier list. He was just annoying to play against, since you had no counterplay at all. And also, you cant be semi competent with a killer who had no learning curve at all, cause the power has 0 complexity. It was a Buff overall, since he has 115% speed now.
---
This was quite satisfying to watch.  This was the equivalent of bank robbers reaching the end of the heist, just to have someone sneeze, making noise and ending it all.
---
cause you only used franks mixtape?
---
Nobody gets the license killer included in the game. Everybody has to buy them.
---
Lol
---
Guess why people use it a lot? Because it's not a bad perk. Out of all the exhaustion perks it's the most useful, although hardest to use. Just because you don't use it effectively doesn't make it bad either.
---
All 4 of your scenarios should have the same outcome. Use dead hard at the correct time to reach the pallet if you would get hit otherwise. If the killer is to close behind you you either didn't loop correctly or were caught in a bad spot, no perk can save you then (cept MoM, but that thing gets nerfed anyway, and has some setup to save you once in a deadzone). If the killer is too far away but will close the distance before you can reach the pallet, use it anyway to close the gap. It's not rocket science.
---
Now if you think DH is bad you should present a better choice, i'm not gonna go through each perk in the game and compare ot to dead hard.
---
Right? Salty tears will wash away all the shit they talk. Not all, just the toxic ones that want to dictate how you play and act like "you'd get more BP chasing us down" should dictate how you play.
---
Sometimes its fun to be a creeper.
---
3 PM EST.
---
No God no
---
Oh god no, I used stun addons like cold dirt, on console my  friend had an account there, I purchased legion on my main pc account like a week ago
---
Thats a very rapey vibe mister, i like it
---
There will be a lot more clicky clicky surviors haha
---
Now this is the synopsis I’ve been looking for.
---
Monitor and Abuse
---
Fookin' ded ard, there was nuthin I could do, dood.
---
When people use and say Enduring + Spirit Fury is a good combo for Spirit. If you use that on her, you might as well use Bamboozle on Nurse.
---
The increased bleed out frequency would be really good for slug builds
---
hello I have a question, is dead by daylight still playable if you have PSN?  as in is it still free to play as long as you have psn?
---
The game breaks and you get weapons in the chest
---
I was drunk, ok? It happens.
---
Everyone: i want a key
---
You gotta DC after getting downed so that he don't get the points for the hook.
---
Is the knife coming out of her arm?
---
Ye I can't standmost dbd streamers. Him and tru3 are prob the worst at it though.
---
Could have sworn the trailer did show it at one point :/ ik I saw 18th of June at one point
---
Why not both?
---
Hex: Ruin
---
You know who else is a fog whisperer? Jendenese who used to promote deranking solely to bully new killers

And this is why I love Rancor so much.
---
It doesn't ;-;
---
i had to resize the original piggy art to make it fit
---
but in the original the blade is longer and you can see a bit of the hidden blade sheath

---
If you have a presteiged character every time you play that character you get a 5/10/15 percent bloodpoint bonus?
---
...I will glow for 3 seconds and run away.
---
That's all up to you. You make the rules if you're killer. I usually choose to let the last guy escape if he gives me his item but that's just me.
---
Or a teammate runs them over intentionally...
---
Source: I do this... sometimes.
---
PS: I miss friendly fire in F13. Not because I was one of those trolls that would go into a game with 3 other friends then run around together murdering other counsellors. But because it led to some incredibly memorable moments.
---
F13 was the only game where three people can repair a boat to escape in, then realize that it can only seat two people. Then your teammate who has been watching your back with a gun... well suddenly you don't feel as safe anymore.
---
It also led to really wholesome moments where that random teammate you thought was totally going to shoot you in the back tells you to leave then goes to head off jason so you can escape.
---
Friendly fire also meant counsellors had a way to deal with griefers and glitchers.
---
Hex: the erect seal
---
Sauce plz
---
Alright, I'll give you that one.
---
No don’t do it there’s so much to live for.
---
Don't get me wrong, I love Claudette and main her but the amount of times this shit happens is relevant to the meme
---
It'd be a shame if those textures weren't used for a map or something
---
Ok, this made me laugh
---
360 are usually only used as last resort when there are no other options, so why not give it a try?
---
Better than running in a straight line, wouldnt call this a mistake...
---
Unbreakable
---
Personally I think the game is pretty balanced at this point. Although once you get to the higher ranks you have to run meta perks or you will get bodied. Swf gives the survivors an edge especially if it's high ranks but solo is pretty balanced.
---
Thanks I was confused bcs of day playing and looking at ranks felt its just random. I had games that I ended with spirit in 2 min at the start if the game or ppl that were way more skilled and knew everything that can make 2-4min loop easly without pallets
---
15 minutes late, goddamn
---
Gotta agree, you're asking for it if you're advertising your twitch in your username.
---
Knowing you can’t use it well means you don’t suck as much as you think you do.
---
Nah he was a free win, lol
---
We all must learn Morse code without killers finding out 👀
---
Aren't killers "supposed" to break any dropped pallet?
---
Agreed
---
A fellow man of culture I see
---
In my defense,, I just loaded into a game when I was making this
---
Survivors use Mettle of man so killers switch to Billy or Nurse to not get hit by that perk.
---
Search Jane in dbdgonewild it's one of the few non XXX ones hahaah
---
I'd link it but I'm omw to work my bad
---
Why are you so irritated? Is this because you don't have any friends to play with?
---
 The devs aren't encouraging cheating, that's the most ridiculous idea ever. But if they wanted to stop it they'd have to remove the game from use entirely because everything uses some kind of voice chat/ communication. 
---
Also I'm not sure if you're aware, but they literally created and incorporated a little thing called survive with friends into the game. What use is playing with your friends if you can't chat with them? Stop being so ridiculous.
---
Because you could take a useful perk Instead of WGTLF.
---
Yeah, these pretty useless too. I kind of forgot they even exist. Insidious and territorial can be somewhat useful but they just force a killer into shitty behavior. Monstrous shrine and unrelenting are just not even worth considering.
---
My point was that just like Insidious and Territorial, Dying Light promotes shitty style of playing, in order to get it off you have to either tombstone, use one of mori offerings or just tunnel a player to death and the other two are straight up camping shit. Why not change it to something that doesnt require you to single out a player?
---
Tbh they need to buff legion alittle more they were way too harsh, he’s practically Freddy tier now..
---
I usually just alt-tab and watch a video on youtube or something, but it's definitely annoying nonetheless.
---
Pretty much what all these people are saying but dead hard is also a God send against nurse when you consider her fatigue
---
WYM? Best meme build material ever!
---
And don’t forget the ***”do it then”*** tbag when you can’t find anything to use to get away
---
This happened to me except I was using No Mither and right at the last second when I fully recovered, I was picked up and slip slided all over the place.
---
It's called a meme bro
---
I never had a problem with nurse and billy idc about nerfs just leave them the way they are.
---
How much are you paying for someone to do this job?
---
Surely you cant expect someone to work for you for free?
---
That’s literally EXACTLY what I was saying.
---
It wouldnt be another Legion cosplay
---
That’s true
---
These are some terrible designs
---
Oh well we had an useless argument then.
---
Maybe fucking wait for what you want? Game development isn't a walk in the park. Stop acting like an entitle child
---
Rescuing your teammates is always the better option, you get more bloodpoints and if you ended up on the hook later they might have returned the favour. And it is basically the point of the game
---
Ahhahahaha no worries have a good one xD
---
This, lol. I thought the ICON of Halloween was Michael Myers...from Halloween.
---
You too man :)))
---
I just know now to kneel and look up at their merciful  M1
---
Why is he awful to his wife? Or how? I barely watch him so I don’t know, but I unashamedly love gossip.
---
Get new mates.  
---
There’s a tutorial in the game.  Start there.
---
Then look at beginner tutorials online.
---
But the tutorial in game is enough to get you started.  Online tutorials are there to get you farther.
---
The rights to Ghostface (or at least the mask and name) are owned by a guy on twitter (The World of RSB), while the rights to the Scream franchise itself and its other characters are owned by the company that made Scream.
---
I'm at rank 4 and this still happens
---
I rarely have the opportunity to use a key.
---
Me: I want a commodius
---
Oh trust me. It gets harder the more you progress. But you’ll overcome it
---
Dont listen to the salty comments, make the content you want :)
---
I run bond literally just so I know where everybody is so I know if they need me to take hits or so I can coordinate something since I play solo
---
Adrenaline doesnt need a nerf its good but other exhaustion perks can help you live so many times
---
There's some pallets that you're better off just going around because the survivor can't make another loop or revault it before you catch them again. I'll go back and break it after I hook the person but no real need to break it in chase.
---
I.E the pallets at the back corners of the houses in Haddonfield, or the one at the tracks outside the Ironworks infinite loop.
---
Just disable the chat to avoid brainless comments after the rounds :)
---
If they loop you why you follow them? Just leave and go for someone else. If they spam the flashlight or tbag all the time i just ignore them for the whole match until they are the last one alive :) Sometimes they even follow me all game long :D
---
well It didn't bcs the survivors were all around good and I didn't want to tunnel even thou it feels like its the only way of actually winning sometimes
---
But its really risky tbh if you're the only one left.
---
The noed?
---
Thats the reason i like it. It gets me hyped up
---
Yes my leader, we share in the knowledge together
---
Never leave a man behind.
---
yos
---
This is Not Happening.
---
Dick Warlock Michael Myers from Halloween 2 (1981) would be awesome.  Still the best Myers imo.
---
Power glove freddy for the memes.
---
Pretty Lady Leatherface would be amazing. They could do it the same way they did the 4 original survivor faces by having to hook Kate and Jane 25 times. 
---
Evil Ash as killer would be awesome too.
---
Hey can I ask what your BP Doctor build is? Besides BBQ and chili of course! 
---
I'm also on tht bp grind haha
---
Fun is a point of view. I see a lot of survivors complaining about killer tactics not fun, but I never once saw them actually carrying to be a fun factor for the killer - then, why should he provide fun to them? You said it yourself, it's just a game with Fun as it's primal factor. Fun for you, though. Not for the opposite team. Let them choke, if they don't like your kind of fun. It's often toxic, sure. But it works as it is.
---
Legion bad. Legion mains should kill themselves. No Legion main is worth the air they breathe.
---
Give me upvotes.
---
I’m sorry that I found it on another site and didn’t dig through all of the DBD Reddit before posting it at midnight last night. I was too busy giggling to myself maniacally in the dark while drifting off to sleep, dreaming of sugar plums and fairies being chainsawed in half by Leatherface in a tutu. 
---
Now I must commit seppuku. I’ll play DBD until I get into a match with a Leatherface and just run face first into him for my sins so he can add me to his... Facebook.
---
Well i get angry real fast so i stop giving a shit about gens and go for the survivor that loops and tbags.
---
But it still really is the point of the game
---
Shoutout to everyone who brings positivity to the community &lt;3
---
PainKiller is better for learning stuff
---
honestly I just want a source on that gif
---
I used to watch him... And still do :)
---
YES - boring and overall a huge sigh when I hear the revving at the start of the match. LF I've found I can counter moderately well by running tight circles around obstacles, but man...Billies are just a chore when you load into them 4+ games in a row.
---
Killing the survivors or taking a mori for specific survivors and then proceeding to tunnel them? 
---
Ofc that was never specifically said in OP's post, but, then again, what's the point of the post if you're not aiming to kill somebody specifically?
---
That's not how the algorithm works.
---
Some times you need to just let yourself get hooked in order not to get face camped. If you notice you have been looping for too long either lose the monster or let them win the chase.
---
IMHO he's weak but not as bad as everyone says he is. He still has major issues. I'm looking forward to the rework reveal today. Just hoping they keep his playstyle similar and I don't end up coming back here saying "Look how they massacred my boy."
---
Ghostface: Origins
---
All that running is good exercise.
---
Only one gen done tho....
---
I never dc, but when there's only two survivors left, the killer downs me and leaves me to crawl to deny that other person a possible hatch because he *needs* that 4th kill I don't hesitate, bitch.
---
I believe no comment on a profile weighs anything.
---
The point is "Oh hey I downed the streamer. Welp on the hook ya go after a quick nod to say hello."
---
I actually consider new legion much more useful and strong, then before.
---
Personally I’d just be excited for the possibility of [Shirtless Goldblum.](https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2432799/jeff-goldblum-reminisces-about-that-time-he-went-shirtless-in-jurassic-park)
---
They did the same thing they did with Freddy, A Bunch of people complained and they OVER nerfed him. All they needed to do was change Franks and make it so the timer dosent decrease inside TR. That's it, but they fucked it up like always.
---
Who? /s
---
I think it was more of a confusion of terms. Was on Haddonfield and had one of theirs (3 man SWF I think) hooked in front of a gate with all gens done and the other gate opened. I stuck around about a 2 house radius because I saw them creeping and got yelled at for “hard camping/face camping”. Still only got the solo and that one in a 2k, but boy were they upset.
---
True, can't trust it to not be toxic
---
I mean he has a point ... bbq at least show auras. They should make wgtlf do something else on top of the extra blood.
---
Carl will come... it is inevitable... carl is actually the next killer, going to get revenge on Ghost Face.
---
They definitely should implement a kind of bleed-out option for survivors who are more than 50% through the Dying state. Would help against killers who deliberately try to leave survivors to bleed out to waste their time.
---
But... He said he was sorry :((((
---
UpvoteRush me plz
---
Ah, I’ve only played survivor but I’ve seen killer streams where it wasn’t there so I was confused. Maybe it was bc Blood Warden...?
---
Sidney fans are straight kicking him while he's down too
---
at one point in my meme did I claim he was high tier sir
---
So true
---
Lol why do you survivor mains want noed nerfed
---
Just do totems godamn
---
Yeah it's still a solid game tho, as long as you don't mind waiting for your energy all the time
---
Case in point: This very same developer just released a rework of their other asymmetric VS game Deathgarden with voicecomms included. Clearly they know how to do it if they want to.
---
You keep saying that because they made it so you can play with friends that automatically means it's okay to talk with them, which is a false equivalence. If the game/devs want you to be able to do something they will give you the tools to do it.
---
Yet none of them are as annoying/uncounterable as Billy.
---
(Though Doc is extremely annoying, he's not as bad as he was on Gideon, and at least you can soft counter Spirit with Spine Chill)
---
I think instead of getting a boost for each gen left undone it should be for each downed survivor
---
Great advice. Bond permanently has a place in my perks. Not only does it help in luring the killer away from others, but also can show you when a teammate is in a chase... or hiding and not doing anything to help.
---
I'm Sooo sorry you have to deal with a 1/100 match situation.
---
Give us the ability to hook from any angle and i'll happily agree with removing the hook vacuum, until then no dice.
---
I suddenly got a mental image of the poor dino trying to hook a survivor over and over only to realize its arms are too small.
---
Yeah everyone equipping a perk that’s insane against low tier M1 killers then being surprised when even more people play high tier killers sums up the entitlement of this community

HAHAHAHA FUNNT AND ORIGINALL XDD ITS A FLASHLIGHT SOO ITS DBD RELATED

So we're combining Dead Hard and Sprint Burst, basically.

Lol no, CP aint ever happening between pc and console. If Sony ever get their heads out of their ass then PS4 to XBOX might happen but even then that's a stretch.

Googoo gaga people are playing with each other and they also cant make a rule they cant enforce

I seriously doubt Dwight would remotely last a season on It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia...

Salty, rofl op is a toxic person that wants to be the next ochidoo
---
Well I mean Sony and Microsoft are working together on something right now so I guess they're not "enemies" anymore
---
I found it great.
---
I guess , but he can still mori everyone else. One hook wont ruin his game considering how fast he can dispatch of everyone else. And if everyone goes in lockers well than everyone goes on a hook. I realy do think the only real counter ( that does not just postpone the inevitable) is gen rushing him and getting out before t3
---
Well, an average match is two kills, two escapes. Win/loss conditions are kinda flexible.
---
That they make him worse or overpowered. Theres no middle ground with BHVR they've repeatedly shown that they SUCK at balancing.
---
This.
---
He just waitinf for ds and borrow time to dissapear
---
Its fine
---
They work together on a few things but cross play is not really one of them.
---
I'm pretty sure Nurse still has to deal with it, too...
---
Zombified legs.
---
Oh goodie let's jump on the Karma train.

He's not, this is just one of a few circle jerk topics that basically get you free Karma.

Just making sure he can tell  the entity your last words
---
Because who the fuck would use it, it would be a waste of time to make when leople have discord
---
I love how people like you say that but it’s not that easy. I play by myself and I’ll spend a match getting like 4 totems and waste around 7 minutes getting them along with getting a gen or two and I’ll assume my teammates got the last one. But because I had no way of knowing it turns out they didn’t because none of us can communicate so we don’t get it and a killer who only got like 2-3 hooks the entire game gets a 3K. If we had a spot on the screen that said how many totems were destroyed then I think it would be okay, but at the moment I wouldn’t say this is a legitimate strategy, as looking for every totem doubles the trial time.
---
Why would devs allow salty ass killers to think they are entitled to everything? Oh wait that’s right because you’ve been told you deserve a participation award for everything you do. It’s not cheating it’s not even close, the devs haven’t implemented it into the base game yet due to the self entitled killers like you who would
---
Rage and make salt posts like this about it.and more importantly the devs have way more to worry about then your whiney ass on reddit complaining because players want to and will play with their friends. Don’t even get me started on all of the bs that killers have over survivors at this very moment as an example the completely broken hit boxes the killers inaccurate attack cones and the horrendous lag due to the killers
---
Hosting the game.
---
thank you. all are easy counters
---
Players at high ranks think they're better than they really are so when they down can't accept it's because they played bad and disconnect.
---
No. The Ghostface DLC only comes with The Ghost killer. 
---
No map or survivor is coming with the DLC. This was confirmed by Not_Queen in the dbd forums.
---
Right let's bring up another game that plays differently... Right. Moving on.
---
&gt; You keep saying that because they made it so you can play with friends that automatically means it's okay to talk with them, which is a false equivalence. If the game/devs want you to be able to do something they will give you the tools to do it.
---
By adding SWF, you promote and urge people to work together and talk. if you are adamant against voice chat, you would not prompt people to do it. Why would a developer encourage "Cheating"? Like wow, the fucking hoops you and OP jump through. "Yah you can play with friends but you can't talk" The fuck, why play with friends then. Wowie.
---
Hell on Console (At least xbox) you can disable party chat in games. CoD use to do that all the time with their Search And Destroy playlist. But hey, guess what it's not restricted there.
---
Even if the killer dosent have blood warden the spikes will still be there signifying that only the survivors can leave and not the killer.
---
I know decisive was nerfed into the ground but it's still annoying nontheless
---
Nurse and spirit can pretty much power through it. You still feel really outplayed, but you can still win. Spirit has a really hard time against multiple MoM but nurse doesn't give a shit
---
I was really hoping Neve Campbell would be in the DLC :(
---
I take this opportunity to remind that there is a subreddit for all leaks about the game, created by me (   
---
also mentioned in two articles by eurogamer and pcgamer):  [https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/)
---
If you don't cleanse then she is a m1 killer that always has 3 stacks of devour hope right?  it seems like it would make it much easier to dodge the vomit than get 1 downed, I play plague as my second or third main, and I love running thanatophobia on her. It seems like just not cleansing might not be the play. (But Idk, I have only gotten to rank 4)
---
So this is your shtick? Your pretentious and condescending on the internet? Right on.
---
And it's a meme post, nothing has to relate to the post.
---
*mumbles* Just wait until I get all the perks I need *mumbles*
---
Their power makes scoring the first hit on survivors really easy, but becomes useless the moment they actually hit you.
---
I'm home I will add you
---
And why is it already bloody?
---
Good
---
Noed works as a genrush punishement
---
Just do totems and allways assumed your teamates didnt destroyed all of them
---
And if there is a counter on the screen noed would be useless
---
Same dude, I love running thanatophobia with her.
---
Yeah but only BP matters, depipping is good
---
You're giving them content
---
You'd think the killer would realize they're wasting their own time and letting generators get done but noooo
---
O my god
---
&gt;Having it not work on the exhausting effect removes its potential as a perk to help with an end-game chase. This would make it much more useless as it would grant you all its boosts in times where you do not necessarily need the boosts. The heal and sprint boost is best while you are in a end-game chase to allow you to escape the killer or at least create some distance. If you have it not activate under the exhausted effect you remove its synergy with other exhaustion based perks.
---
It wouldnt remove its potential in endgame chases. I dont know what you mean with "it would grant you all its boosts in times where you do not necessarily need", since it only triggers at the end.
---
That you can combine it with other exhaustion perks is exactly the issue I have with it.
---
2 piggy’s for double the fun &lt;3
---
I am no survivor main. I mostly play killer.
---
thanks! thats about been my average for killer and i was thinking maybe I’m just clueless. survivor usually ends with none or all dead tho for me.
---
Does this just happen on PC
---
Yeah... Matchmaking is fucked right now. I am a level 17, and lately I have been paired with extremely lower rank killers (lvl 8-9) and super-level survivors.
---
The hardest decisions, require the strongest wills
---
You were the one who brought up voicecomms in other games and now you're trying to make me look dumb for giving you a perfect counter-argument by example of a similar game from the same developer that allows voicecomms... thanks but I'm done talking to you. 
---
You keep harping on the same points but haven't even tried to explain why they don't add a voice option when they clearly have the means to and in your opinion think want to be used.
---
True, but it’s far easier to land a Nurse hit than extend a loop with Leatherface
---
Trapper I think still has one of the easiest workarounds. I mean, Billy probably still has it the easiest, but if you can catch someone with MoM in a trap you can put them in the Dying state without a hit.
---
I do.
---
Thats Lithe OP...you cant be serious.
---
There is no such thing as "genrush"
---
The correct apology for a missed skill check is looking straight up and crouching.
---
You find Tapp’s gun after searching every chest.
---
Message me if you want and I can add you to my ps4 list.  Unless your on pc, I’m not.
---
Lmao accurate. This is why I’m not a fan of facing him. He’s not really “frightening” to go against half the time because he’ll tag you and go chase someone else. Not as fun as being brutally tunnelled
---
I brought up if people even use them, which is different then what you brought up is that if they are able to add it or not. That's two entirely different things.
---
&gt; You keep harping on the same points but haven't even tried to explain why they don't add a voice option when they clearly have the means to and in your opinion think want to be used.
---
I guess you ignored it, it's in my first comment. Why would they add it when everyone uses Discord/Party Chat?
---
You and OP skate around people's points and refuse to answer any of them. So dont give me that "You wont explain!!"
---
Why did they add SWF if they don't want groups working together as originally intended?
---
Why isn't party chat blocked on console?
---
Why are perks designed around people communicating if they intend people to not talk?
---
Are you expected to play with your friends but not talk? Do you realize how bat shit insane that sounds?
---
But no, keep ignoring those questions and keep restating your silly "But voicomms aren't innnn!!!" Christ, you and OP are babies when it comes to this.
---
It's the real life obsession
---
-.. --- / .- / --. . -. . .-. .- - --- .-.
---
It's not that difficult, you just have to Urban Evasion your way in so that you're basically a meter away... wait, I think I mixed up my killers here
---
I can understand killers who do this though as I usually just play survivor but I was killer and came across a group of all Claudettes which kept palet looping, tree looping and butt dancing and by the last gen I was fed up so when I actually managed to down one of them I face camped, toxicity for toxicity. (Forgot to mention that they also all had dead hard, borrowed time etc so at that point i just got really fed up)
---
I rarely do killer daily's, but one of the few I've done was I needed to kill one survivor by hook..
---
I was fairly new to the game, never played killer before, they had 3 gens done before I hooked a survivor. Bet your ass I guarded him.
---
How thoughtful and caring!
---
Don't worry fellow Freddy Comrade.
---
You misspelt Carl
---
"Gg ez"
---
"You got 1 kill"
---
Wait, what are the Freddy rework details?!
---
From what I can recall, dropping someone with adrenaline triggered the stun animation. Maybe that changed.
---
Hello! It’s only free if you added the game to your library several months ago when it was one of the free games of the month. If so, you can download/play it any time you want(as long as you currently have a PSN subscription when you go to play it). If you didn’t add it to your library at that time, it will still need to be purchased. Unfortunately it isn’t free to play simply for having PS+ though. 
---
Hopefully that was the answer you were looking for
---
Don't try to justify camping, im here to have fun, if you're gonna sit infront of me while im hooked, you bet your sweetass I will tbag you
---
Me-Did you understand?
---
Survivor- Well yes,but actually no.
---
I say play how you wanna play for me I try to save and do whatever I mostly just fuck around and try to have fun
---
Congratz. While y'all have this on trending in whatever country y'all live, here in Finland there's only shit at the trending tab..
---
No rules. As long as you don’t camp, tunnel, and use NOED you probably won’t get angry people in your DMs
---
Considering how much hatch game favors the killer now, forcing them to go into hatch game instead of endlessly slugging got the 4k is perfectly fair.
---
What do you mean? There would be one counter, much like the amount of generators remaining, saying how many totems are still up. And you seem to be the unreasonable one, this isn’t really a nerf to NOED, just a buff to solo players who always plan to get totems. NOED will still punish players who are only gen jockeys. I think this is a very fair quality of life change. As a killer main, you should appreciate this, especially because it doesn’t make SWF stronger. If you still refuse to accept this it shows that it is pointless to try to talk with you as this is reasonable.
---
If you trash a daily, It will re-roll one per day. It doesn't delete it, it just replaces it. It actually shouldn't even be a trash can, it should be a re-roll icon.
---
i literally said nothing against legion mains lmao.
---
Run engineers toolbox with swivel socket and instructions and gens pop so quick
---
Not in my experience.
---
depends if the player is good.
---
Nah, Legion's better now.
---
They should have this popping up when your a new survivor instead of the the other art pics of doing gens, hitting skill checks then the gates!
---
Who's that character!?!
---
Seriously who is it I can't tell
---
Meh you are clearly a survivor main soo no point in arguing with you
---
Hatch spawns even easier for you guys and you still complain saying its killer sided rofl
---
I’ve played for roughly 600
---
Hours and if i escape and leave a teammate i get alot of messages. So you are clearly new
---
It's literally a circle jerk post? You're more than welcome to dislike or ahte the guy but you ran to reddit to make a post out of no where with the sole intention of insulting and spreading rumors.
---
I'll check him out  :)
---
Brenda would be a better choicd imo.
---
That's basically the Killer's version of holding the game hostage at the exit gates as Surv. The difference here is that the Killers can actually react to it in an equally toxic way.
---
We'd don't know
---
Billy and nurse were already the only killers used at rank 1 anyway thought, plus mom is going to be changed
---
I hope there are four people dressed as disconnect symbols that you can get a photo with.
---
I remember that someone posted something similar.. Anyway, i would bring this everytime tbh
---
Backrolls
---
thank you very much
---
wtf? How can you see their aura?? I main Myers when i play a killer but i cant do this.
---
A lot of the time, with a killer when I don't have fun with them is because I don't have very good perks/add-ons. 
---
Not much you can do about that if you don't enjoy the play style as you'd have to invest a ton of BP into it to get anything decent. 
---
That said,I have plague at 44 with some really great perk buildings and a ton of add-ons as I've only played her about 8 times. I don't really "love" her either and find her kind of similar to the clown. When I find someone, I down and hook them but getting from the hook to another survivor takes time. Games see to go a lot faster as her. She really needs ruin and other perks to slow down gen progression to be effective.
---
I have 670+ hours and don't get messages like at all, even though my Steam profile is public and everyone's allowed to comment.
---
With a totem counter survivors will allways be reminded to do totems, and if they are reminded to do them they will allways do them, making noed never appear, and making every other hex perk useless
---
If they start properly hidding totems and making a different smaller model then sure add a totem counter but not on the current state
---
As a Doctor main who now plays him not very often, I LOVE people who sat at pallets. Switch to zap mode, zap them to prevent them dropping it (2.5 second "Stun" where you can't vault or drop pallets after being shocked), then switch back as you rush through and hit them.
---
I love it. Take my upvote
---
\*If the survivor is bad
---
Time for Devour Hope or Rancor?? Don’t play it easy and bring a Mori.
---
Back in the day when regional magchmaking (whatever it was called) was a thing, this was a lot of fun. A friend of mine &amp; me would go on the same coubtry, insteas of germany we went to the middle east or north africa and met there, after a while the lobby filled with other people with somewhat good ping. We never abused it(*), we just poayed against each other while also getting Bloodpoints. Hah, the good old times :)
---
(*) we once abused it, bc a survivor was really toxic in the lobby. Insulting his teammate before a game ... Let's just say he didn't have a good time. He still survived though, we let him go.
---
Sorry OP for this bad gaming experience of yours, it's nearly impossible to pull something like that, unless you are near rank 20 or near rank 1 with much less people. Hard to "snipe" lobbies ofnyour friends.
---
Very nice, thanks for the clear title.
---
Why would I bet my ass, of all things?
---
Legion is really fun for quick chain stabs and applying pressure by having the deep wound effect
---
They also vault pallets in their power
---
Done. U on private?
---
Spawning at 4 and 5 gens with one survivor left is good for the killer too unless you enjoyed games where that last person with no hope was wasting your time crouching around the map. 
---
Hatch now comes down to who finds it first with one side being able to move faster while not having to worry about being killed if spotted. If you can't admit that hatch is more killer sided now then you're the one being biased.
---
Most survivors who “genrush” as you say won’t do totems anyway. If there is a counter they still wouldn’t do them. If they take the time to destroy every totem then good, they deserve not having to worry about NOED, as they spent a lot of time cleaning up. And with all that extra time they won’t be able to “genrush” you so the perk helped you anyway. This is a way to buff solo survivors against NOED but not SWF. When I play with my buddies we always call out when we destroy a totem. Once again, this is only to help solo players. It doesn’t buff SWF and whether survivors get every totem or not it doesn’t change much, as the killer will either get NOED or they will get the extra five minutes or so to hook people.
---
&gt;  i often play against survivors with 3x, 4x or 10x my hours so yeah, its kinda shit the matchmaking
---
Hours played are not considered in matchmaking. Only current rank.
---
Change the power to the ability to see further through the mist or make that a perk and it would work far better. Suddenly the mist is thickening and you can see fine.
---
So no head?
---
Megmillan is real
---
#Tip 4
---
If the generator is affected by Ruin and you don't hit the great [fucking let go of the fucking generator.](/intensifies) You do not gain progress while working on a generator that's sparking (that's why the bar doesn't move up and your toolbox doesn't lose charges!) but you can trigger more skill checks which can further cause the generator to lose more progress!
---
Co. Plete noob here, what was that perk?
---
I know it’s not a huge deal but for Devour Hope it’s only 24 meters for a token.  Make Your Choice is 32.
---
I dont think hours played has any bearing on match making
---
I agree. Especially when they have an Eboni Mori. Why would I crawl around forever just to have you kill them then kill me? Fuck that. I’d rather take the depip and DC to start a new game than play slug simulator then wait to die, having my teammate die in the process.
---
Not this again. Camping isn't against the rules. Yes it's annoying but the killers job is to kill people and camping is a method to do it
---
I had a game the other day where the streamer gets downed, immediately DC's then sticks around for like 15 minutes to spew salt at the killer.  They even had the gall to say they're not a streamer...
---
Like yeah ok dude, you've got a t.tv name that leads to your account, but because you ragequit you don't want to admit that you're a baby streamer lol.
---
&gt; So your a fan and this is why you are acting out and calling us "circle jerkers"
---
I'm calling you circle jerkers because thats what you are, Your entire post boils down to "I dislike him do you dislike him? let's talk about how he sucks" I don't give a shit if people dislike the guy but making posts out of the blue with the sole intention of insulting him is the literal definition of a circle jerk.
---
You claim to be the "mature" one in this debate but spread misinformation about someones relationship as fact.
---
The system may get a little pissy, which is why I prefer not to use them, but I think you should be fine
---
What do you want them to do..?
---
People who camp the hooks will just hardly get any points. Along with making the game boring for them, and unfortunately the person on the hook.
---
If survivors are still running at the hook while a killer is camping theeeen that's kind of on the survivor.
---
But they called LF a paragraph
---
&gt; Are there any developers actually playing this game?
---
Yep, they even stream
---
*Legion Undertale*
---
Tyde has been complaining for years now, you would think he would grow tire of it, but apparently not.  I thought he quit playing DBD a couple times too but maybe that was another twitch personality
---
Glad to see this bug still isn't fixed like 3 months later.
---
That's why you get the first hit and tunnel as legion. Only way to take down a decent survivor with Legion.
---
Be quite you've done it again by targeting people who dislike him. We are entitled to our opinion as freely as you are but I'm not attacking you for yours. So pipe down and come back another time when you have more to argue with me over.
---
Come on dude, got to give killers credit for mind gaming loops and zoning survivor to do medium vaults to score a hit
---
That's exactly what I am doing.
---
Even though legion wasn't nerfed and people are just bad.
---
:(
---
He looks more like Ace and Meg had a baby.
---
LMAO...perfect!
---
There are a lot of perks to stop killers from camping and also you can just rush generators.
---
The only way to play as a killer with your friends is through the “Kill Your Friends” mode to the right of “Killer.”  You won’t be able to earn any blood points or shards or anything while you play it but you’ll have everything unlocked for you to be able to experiment with if you want!
---
No? You’re letting them bleed out on the ground, needlessly extending the time of the game. Digging is fine but some people just use it as an excuse to hold the game hostage because of how big the bleed out meter is. Other people are agreeing with me in the comments. It wastes people’s time.
---
Let him out
---
I would really enjoy using a custom icons pack, but I'm scared of getting banned since I have almost all the dlcs
---
Billy is the only one who can wield a chainsaw in my heart.
---
Git gud
---
It's an error. Devs changed rituals recently to make them easier to know how much time you need, and they forgot to change the values of some of the rituals. It should be 120 seconds, not 2 seconds
---
Lol I know right? Silly Gosling it's just a joke.
---
You alright bud?
---
What? the survivor grind is far far worse, not only do you make far less BP per match on average, survivor game-play heavily revolves around item usage to increase survival rates.
---
well the roadmap says new killer and new survivor so now I am confused, unless they are bringing them out separately
---
Whats the joke?
---
If i take a pic of a pallet is that also a joke?
---
I know it's him... It's really hard not to tell. My thing is it's so monotone and it's just what everybody else is rapping about.
---
 (Well at least the one part I always here) like you can't come up with something more original? They always got to talk about  dicks, ass, and shit like that? By no means saying I could do any better but at least I know I can't.
---
BW is 1 min
---
Yeah I definitely feel you. But it basically comes down to campers gonna camp cause the devs don't give a shit lol
---
Save data is formatted differently between platforms, it's why you can't use Console save data on PC and vice versa. Nintendo switch even uses a proprietary form of their own save data i believe, making it even less likely.
---
nice one!
---
I think so yeah. People have taken pictures of pallets and such too and posted them on here.
---
Oh, I only have it to green so for me it’s 30 seconds
---
Adorable! I particularly love the updated version of Lithe.
---
Ash was called a chapter
---
I can help sometime when my internet wants to work :) also have mic
---
Let's be real now if they add Carl to the game that's a instant buy for me. And I do t even play survivors like that.
---
And for the final guy he can kill em in their sleep
---
This is awesome!
---
This sucks. These people seriously need to be banned. I had a similar video to this a few days ago where two survivors and a clown bodyblocked me and stuff. But it got removed by a Moderator even though there was proof of them exploiting this game. So this’ll probably be removed too, for “witch-hunting” even those these toxic players are admitting to exploiting and thus admitting to being a “witch”.
---
It was baraka, When he was beefy strong and safe during the beta where people didn't know too much about him.
---
&gt;How weak is your self confidence that you can't take on a challenge? I sincerely hope for you that behavior isn't your approach in real life when you are faced with a challenge or failure because then you will never improve at anything.

This is a fucking reach. It's a videogame. And everyone agrees that a God Nurse with even 2 blinks is unbeatable. A 2+ blink Nurse who is good WILL win no matter what. No point sticking around.

Oh! Seriously? Agh, can't wait to see who it is, then!

He's such a cry baby

I'm not targeting anyone, i'm calling a post a karma train because that's what it is, This sub has such a monumental hate boner for Tyde that i could make a new account and make a post titled "Hur dur Tyde Sucks Free karma pliz" and be at +100 by morning.
---
Username- robmiller2002 :): message me when
---
yes
---
You could uhh, have the killer create a real lobby and ur friends just try and search for it 2 play
---
More like Tier 50
---
What so you have in mind? 
---
A) Extra Healing Speed? 
---
B) Temporary Speedboost (a la hope?)? 
---
C) No scratch marks for both for 10 seconds? 
---
D.1) No sound effect for the killer when the unhook happens 
---
D.2) (or delaying the sound effect by 3-5 seconds?)?
---
E) Buffing the unhooked and saviour survivor by giving them an additional 20% speed boost after they get hit? (You know, that one speedboost you get when getting injured etc.)
---
F) start of game: when you get hit you have 40% more speed when getting smacked fpr 3 seconds, but for each token you collect you lose 10% of that extra speed. 
---
Etc
---
Way more possibilities
---

Another invalid point all for "karma" make a valid point then reply because you are making no sense of it at all
---
Run decisive strike and borrowed time. 
---
Camping sucks and is kinda toxic but there isn't much to do about it
---
It's like r/townofsalemgame's "shut up exe"
---
You won't get banned.
---
She's the killer we knew she were.
---
This little hoe is really coming for me.
---
The point is Mettle can make it a risk for anyone with instant down.
---
Yeah, if you are going to focus on getting those sweet blood points for unhooks, at least bring BT, give the rescued a chance yo, also that way you ensure you do get the safe unhook.
---
There's not much more the devs can do to prevent camping. They can't implement anything to stop the killer being near the hook. The killer currently loses points when they're near a hooked survivor, so they're unlikely to rank up. Unfortunately for new players, this means they're likely to come up against campers who don't rank up. All you can really do is keep playing until you rank up beyond campers. It's rare to see campers in red/purple ranks, and when you do your teammates are more likely to make better plays to counter the camping.
---
I think they did what they could. DS is now an anti-tunnel perk and it works great from what I've seen, you got Borrowed Time, killers lose points for hanging around the hook etc. What else can they do? This wouldn't be as big of a problem if every camper was punished with 1k at most and a depip which is in the hands of survivors.
---
id pay triple lol
---
I split my time pretty evenly between killer and survivor. More survivor but I’d say it’s 60/40 or 70/30 at most. Point being I understand both sides. And I think the huge difference here is that when survivors play scummy the killer still can do everything that makes the game fun. You can still get hooks and one hit downs and grab people out of lockers and chase them. Etc. You get the idea. If a killer decides to slug a survivor or camp them on the hook, that’s that. That one survivor’s experience is ruined and there’s nothing they can do about it.
---
To simplify it... Toxic killers mean that one survivor can’t even really play the game and toxic survivors mean the killer can still do everything a killer does. Which is why I can’t blame survivors for DCing to start a new match instead of playing slug simulator.
---
Carl=upvote

Is it /s or not /s?

I'm confused

Think I added u

The thing is there’s no good way to “dodge the vomit” a lot of the times.  If you’re in an open area you’re completely screwed.  Same thing if there are actually loops that she can see over and vomit over.  The vomit has a very strange hitbox anyways so dodging it anywhere besides a good high walled tile is very difficult a lot of the time.
---
You did
---
Chill, bro
---
This footage is from 2016, so yeah it only happend on PC because DBD wasn't released on consoles then.
---
Are you even reading what he wrote? Doesnt look like it.
---
Your most likely going against other players who just got the game from game pass,  give it some time to learn the mechanics before you start making juke montage videos.  DCing is kinda meta right now, but you should also take gamepass into consideration for that.  Thousands of ppl will download this game and as soon as they get hooked 1 time they will probably leave the match and uninstall the game and likely never play it again.
---
Adrenaline and MoM
---
Ya I got one too for PS4 off Amazon lol best 20$ I ever spent
---
I got flamed in end game chat for using noed. I got gen rushed (which is fine, whatever, thats the game) I had 1 survivor on hook in basement and 2 people hadnt been hooked at all. They opened the exit gate and a claudette ran and tried to get the one person out of basement. The other two escaped and i ended up getting two kills because the claudette couldnt cut her losses and leave well enough alone. The One kate in basement in second state wasn't worth the effort I would have got just the one kill but instead she got cocky, died, and then got super salty in chat. sorry bud.
---
WGLF should include ether borrowed time or we’ll make as a single perk it so it actually benefits the person being saved
---
Don’t understand why the killer farming perk has a massive gameplay benefit (and is way easier to get to 4 stacks)
---
Lol Freddy's a pizzaface?
---
This needs to be a Ace cosmetic, please bhvr? &lt;3
---
Yeah, if I chase a survivor down and a gen has been done, I don't bother chasing any longer and go apply some more pressure elsewhere
---
He's asking for the screenshots the other guy mentioned showing Ochido asking, I don't see why everyone's downvoting, he didn't ask for the nudes.

Half of the people who play this game want to kill themselves. ^^^^Myself ^^^^included.

If all you do is promote you content on this sub please find another sub to post this. If you want fans work hard don’t just spam this subreddit with your videos because the majority of the people here don’t care.
---
When you are getting slugged so the killer can get the last guy but you drop yourself in front of them through a hole in the floor at Lery's and look like too good of a snacc so the killer gives in and moris you.
---
thanks
---
thank you for your advice
---
Wow...these are nice!
---
Keep your movements upredictable and try to break line of site using walls. When you are in the open and the nurse is chasing, a trick that works most of the time (against lower ranked nurses) is to change directions and move towards her when she blinks causing her to blink past you. Other than that play stealthy and use dead hard (wastes one blink).
---
\&gt;This sub: Hate ochido, I hope people stopped paying attention to him, he is toxic and sucks
---
\&gt;This sub also: Can't keep going for a week without a bunch of post talking about him and his shit.
---
Maybe start acting like the shitstain does not exist guys, even when you make comments about him all you doing is making people that didnt even knew about him to look for his videos, and some of them might even like them. I hope you can live with that in your consciense.
---
I know some of the lines were originally on the image but it looks funnier when you ignore that fact and randomly parts like "edd", "y?","mmu","'s fa" are highlighted

Thank you for the hideous Quentin doodle it’s wonderful

Wasn't this already posted a week or so ago?

---
Emblem changes to punish campers, perks to promote non-camping gameplay, perks to help against campers... Yeah, they don't give a shit.
---
Why does Link look like Dwight?
---
Death is not an escape
---
He's not really that special. Nothing we haven't seen before...not quite pig, not quite mickle, but close enough to sleep.
---
But we don't have a thicc walmart cashier yet. They gave us Jane and now we can't stop. We want'em like we want our milkshakes.
---
This + a pirouette emoticon.
---
plz Bhvr!
---
Developers really like dragging any killer that isn't Billy or Nurse through the mud. Even Spirit has been subjected to nerfs in the past, but never Billy or Nurse (I understand that release Nurse was gamebreaking, but we'll let that one slide.)
---
Billy at least needs some kind of nerf. Whenever I play someone like Wraith or Pig, I just feel like I'm playing killer with extra steps. Simply playing Billy removes the need to do half of the things other killers need to do in order to complete their objective. 
---
Chainsaw just removes so much complexity from the game, being able to instadown, break pallets and close ridiculous distances in a short amount of time. Why play any other killer besides Nurse or Spirit, seriously?
---
*Tiger Roar*
---
It really isn't a hardware problem. The Switch can handle games like Doom, Skyrim, BOTW, Final Fantasy, Bayonetta, Diablo 3, etc. All of those games are more graphically and physic intense than Dead By Daylight but yet run with ease on the Switch.
---
There is zero excuse why DBD runs terribly on a PS4/Xbox One, let alone the Switch. That is purely a software problem.
---
I was honestly more exited about the supermarket map.

*"Cleaning in hall 4, I need cleaning in hall 4, there is some maniac hooking people in hall 4!"*
---
Id main Carl
---
I don't really like it because it's already annoying that people off themselves on their first hook because they are impatient, which royally screws their team over than if they had just hung there the whole time.
---
Safest loop in the game to the point the killer can do nothing if you drop it. Usually means you get away scott free.
---
Best to save it for a deathhook or in endgame
---
Same. As a killer i find the hatch completely killer sided. If i down the second last survivor and he is on his death hook i will hook him. One, because it’s fair and two, because the hunt becomes actually fun. A race against time rather than a long, boring, drawn out waiting game.
---
ohh nice
---
Dwight is sort of like early cricket. Just a born victim
---
Got a stroke reading these perks.
---
See you in court.
---
Billy doesn't need a nerf. Other killers should be balanced around billy as he offers the greatest balance of mind games and outplay to both sides
---
Tru3 thinks Hitboxes are fine because it benefits him. Puppers is more reliable because he has a more non-biased approach. I won't believe a camper like Tru3, I stopped watching him, following him when I saw him camp 1 survivor with 1 gen done.
---
I would do C and E, but only for the proteccted survivor. Protecctor gets their stack.
---
God I love mirror so much, fuck. FUCK, its so good.
---
Bless you op
---
Looks awesome!
---
Have you guys also noticed that Legion disappeared lately in the game...
---
I believe a year ago Monto told No0b3 to stop with the toxicity and the bullying because the community shouldn't be like that. After that, No0b3 changed for the better.
---
Yeah, me too
---
This is also my philosophy. I'll get myself killed sometimes so my teammates can live too, because I just find it fun being more heroic.
---
A few weeks ago I went against a hag who was for sure going to kill a Meg on my team. Meg was one hit from downed but luckily I had bond and sprinted back to her from the exit gate and got in between them to take a hit. Unfortunately I ended up going on the hook and getting camped but Meg got out.
---
A few days later I was playing against an insane Billy. It was just me and one other left and the gate was open. I went to try and save them but Billy caught me and downed me. Instead of carrying me to the hook he carried me to the exit gate. The Billy was the Meg I had previously sacrificied myself for a few days earlier and remembered my name :'D
---
Moral of the story is that if you play around the same ranks all the time you'll develop a bit of a reputation. There's a few players who's names I recognise I'd never go back for, but if I know you've been a good teammate it's always fun to try and save.
---
That carl is top tier by itself
---
I only see Puppers frustrated when he gets a bullshit hitbox hit. I understand the frustration.
---
but they put a different survivor idk, I guess we have to wait :(
---
nope but this sub does. it's cancer.
---
Bloodwarden. Freddy's teachable perk.
---
It'll never happen. 
---
BHVR have said Ghostface won't get a Survivor or Map and I doubt they'll release any free content in the future given that we already have two DLC chapters that are 100% free.
---
You're free to hope, but I don't think we'll see Carl again. :'(
---
According to this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/comments/bnukl6/not_mine_an_email_response_from_eac_regarding/) you should be fine; I've been running custom perk icons for awhile now and have been totally fine as well.
---
Had does not have a perk that puts a ton of hexes on the map, each of her teachable perks only add one my dude.

125% movement speed survivors.
---
Christ in heaven can we get 5 99% gens in the chat?
---
I think his emotes are the best on Twitch. :ZUBmilk
---
God can suck my dick.
---
Lmao same, I got a 4k cuz a SWF didn't want to leave their friend behind while my NOED was active. They hadn't even opened the gates yet. So I just let the last one bleed out lmao
---
you honestly seem like a killer main from that response. and when is a debate arguing he gave his side how about you give your side instead of just insulting someone because they disagree with you
---
That's actually pretty solid
---
If at 75% progression, I'd be down.
---
RIP killer idea :(
---
Plague fits the bill too, just make sure everyone is broken before hitting them. Blood puke works good too.
---
Legion gets a free hit at the start of every chase and after that has to play like any other killer, which isnt a bad thing. Its like every survivor has no mither and Legion basically has to hit them once. I say the update wasnt a nerf at all + they increased his movementspeed to 115%, which is the biggest buff a killer could get. Change my mind
---
No comments on your profile means you haven't pissed off anyone to the point he felt the need to comment. It's something.
---
Merge WGLF with NOLB. It's the only change we need.
---
It’s much closer to Benny Hill than anything else tbh.
---
That's a good point, but if you're not in the open could you not just wait for her to charge it and run away from the loop perpendicular to whatever is between you and her? The vomit only reaches so far.
---
I should mention that while I play both rolls I am a better killer than survivor, and haven't gotten to play against the plague yet so all my BS is coming from the killer side and what worked against me/what I amagine working against me.
---
I forgot about that, the play who you verse thing was an interesting concept.
---
Then he started criticizing everyone he versed, "why would he use this" "this is a trash build!" or "he had this good of a build and we still escaped!" etc.
---
god forbid 4 letters drove you to make a reddit post about words people say to you when you got tbe overall win

JuSt DoN't GeT hOoKeD
---
Answered your own question. The community is toxic as fuck. I thank God for end game before the gates would be open for 5 minutes with survivors flash lighting body blocking and tea bagging until their hearts content... Then after three left you had that one jerk hiding for another 5 minutes then waiting at hatch so you can watch him tea bag and drop into hatch
---
Kind of no reason to now with the safe hook changes to WGLF
---
Huntress' problem is that she keeps getting fucked by bad. Every single map after clown dlc has been terrible for her. 
---
I actually think she should be given 115% at this point, with reworking her add-ons ofc. I used to be really against the idea, but then I realised it really doesn't give her any more chase power in maps she is already good in, but would give her a buff for all the maps where she is miserable, be it too many safe structures or too large of a map. It would just remove the dev's need to always balance the maps so she isn't trash in them
---
Only if they're slugging in a situation where they won't be able to immediately kill the last guy.
---
If you down one and slug to immediately chase the other, you have a decent amount of time to kill them before their buddy offs themselves.
---
If you're just leaving them on the ground to bleed and be bait, yeah that strat is nerfed. Good.
---
So im not saying this to be edgy or different, but I haven't faced an ACTUAL camper in a very, very long time. I'm talking about a killer who just sits and stares at me.
---
When I play killer, I will sometimes find the person who just got off the hook first and be accused of camping.
---
So does this sub face killers who are playing the game and you just get unlucky? Or are there a gang of face campers I just simply never run into?
---
I can relate
---
No but thanks
---
No Laurie? :(
---
That's even more laughable than the other guy.
---
I hear ya, I just recently started playing again after a close to 3 month break player other games.  I went from rank 1 to like 14 I think.  I faced people with decent skills below rank 10 as I climbed back up.
---
He's been playing since 2016. Those years were true bullshit with actual infinites and very op perks like sprintburst that reset while running like every 30ish seconds possibly 20. It doesn't come from nowhere, but the game has gotten better. I'm just thinking he doesn't want a return to that state of balance.
---
He completely skips a crucial component in the game's mechanics, that being able to down survivors from the healthy state. Other Killers need to go through preparations or use ultra rare addons in order to meet this requirement. Myers needs to stalk, NOED/Rancor activates at the end of the match, etc. And even the add ons have significant disadvantages, like Iridescent Hatchets limiting your supplied hatchets, or needing to land a direct hit with Clown's bottle.
---
Not only does Billy have this in his core kit, he can make it even stronger and it gives him the highest mobility out of all Killers. And there's no drawback! He's still a 115% speed Killer with a normal lunge distance! What drawbacks does he have compared to other Killers, if any?
---
If you want all Killers to be balanced in the same way that Billy is, then you want every Killer to be able to one shot Survivors, is that correct?
---
Not always toxic players. I understand it too. It's that the killer is immature and emotional that a survivor got the better of them for so long, and "I'm going to make an example of them." It's petty, and idiotic. 
---
It's an admission that the killer lost, and so they're going to do everything in their power to ruin it for the other person. If the player was being toxic, go ahead.  If the player legit gave you a good run, that's half the fun! Catch and release those.
---
Nah nah nah that was the wrong move. It dont matter the situation, the bloodpoints the items  nothing, this game is 4v1. 4 v 1. 4 people vs 1 person. Survivors vs killer. You join a game as  a survivor, then you leave with your fellow survivors. In my mind you sure as hell dont win if you run away. Fuck the killer not your team.
---
Yea I learned about pain reliver through Demi. Demi does some pretty good shenanigans.
---
I just, I will, I am gonna save this for later.
---
No.
---
But at the same time a majority of time the speed boost from adrenaline can be completely useless and leave you exhausted before you go open the exit gate, or before that killer with NOED finds you.
---
It's a gamble, and it's in a good place the way it is.
---
Thanks i hate it
---
I can't believe more people have not figured out that lockers are legions worst nightmare. I just position myself were i know there will be a locker when he is about to lunge and jump in. Legions are still incredibly M1 happy so even high rank legions fall for it multiple times.
---
People have hated legion since his first day of release.
---
Nice drawing tho
---
It sucks when survivors rage quit/dc as killer.  Huge potential loss of chase/hook blood points. the match will end up lopsided.  if you kill the remaining survivors too fast you may depip rank or not pip at all.
---
yes. It's true.
---
More skins! More cosmetics! More fodder for the Store! More more more!
---
Anything that gives my salty teammates a way to off themselves is a bad idea.
---
That was horrible
---
Nice man, punish that tunneling piggo.
---
Hag, huntress and spirit are very close to billy's level if not higher or interchangeable yet billy is the only one of those that has a built in oneshot but also the only one that can be looped. my proposition would be more along the lines of: if the the killer can be looped, they should have a mean of one-shotting.
---
The only thing that should be changed about billy is his add-ons. His base kit is good
---
I like it. I’d Be more than happy to read the rest.
---
there are pallet you need to keep for the lategame, such as the so called god pallets (in the basement) and those near the exit gates if possible.
---
Anyway early game you'd better to not drop any safe pallet just to avoid your first hit.
---
I made a post asking for Carl with the exact same No Refunds Perk. You sir are a man of taste. You deffo get my upvote.
---
Ash when you compliment him for his altruism
---
I once was in a chase for the entire match with a really bad wraith, all 5 gens were done, then the hitboxes betrayed me and i got facecamped and no one even tried to save me :(...
---
Devil's Advocate here (and pretty poor killer TBH) in a chase you can get tunnel vision and kinda forget about the rest of the game. I am glad that gens getting completed are obvious AF because often they help break me away, though many times I've not heard gens pop while I chase.
---
There is already a perk for that. Also WGLF doesn't need a buff, what they need to do is buff survivors point gain. WGLF was only meant to be a bonus, while BBQ was meant to be an anti camping perk. WGLF was also nerfed about 1,5 years ago, before that iit stacked up to 200% bonus BP (50% per stack). And BBQ was also buffed, it didn't give 100% bonus BP before.
---
TL;DR: Don't buff WLGF, make survivor point gain better.
---
Darn
---
You do you, but I'm not going to toilet my BP just because I got mad. I don't care about the other survivor, if he gets out, great, if not, that's fine too. Either way I didn't ragequit and no one is forfeiting their BP.
---
It would help. Like when you unhook someone you and the one you unhook can see where the killers at to run the other direction or heal right there if theyre over on the other side of the map. Anythings better than it giving you 3 perks to use in the match just for some extra bp
---
You forgot getting tunneled for the rest of the game.
---
Literally every boy I went to school with had a scream mask at halloween with the blood stuff in it
---
Pretty much Ace
---
That's a myth, I 360 dudes all the time. What is actually hard is 360ing the same killer multiple times a game. Once they know your strat they can counter it and aim better, but you can always get a cheeky hit or miss off on a PC player at least once if you're good.
---
Exactly because once you coby off the hook and they see you have deliverance you gonna get tunneled!
---
I'm not ragequitting, I'm just giving someone else a shot at escaping. I'm just trying to be kind
---
The correct response to the apology is a crouch and nod
---
Triple BP for 3 days for 3rd anniversary would be too nice....
---
Thats a pretty dumb pig
---
Meanwhile,  I am here praying for the day they add The Tall Man from Phantasm to the game.  Him and his orbs of death would be awesome.
---
lmao the best part is when they accuse you of stream sniping.
---
Ghostface
---
*killer mains* naw man you good.
---
For me,  it's about how exciting that game was up to that point. If it was boring, I might do it just to make something happen. It also depends on their name so...
---
I think 99% of the time the killer is right next to WGLF users. They don't care about safe unhooks. They just want them stacks.
---
My DMs are open friend.
---
Oh ok thank you so much I appreciate it!
---
Uhh the girl is cute but She doesnt really look like feng
---
Legions isn't bad, but come on, the slow vaults and longer cooldown were deffo a nerf. You know it.
---
It makes sense for BBQ to do that though because it's a killer perk and those are almost always stronger than the survivor perks to account for the survivors getting 16 perks to their team to the killer's four.
---
It'd be pretty rough to give up a perk slot as killer for just more blood points.
---
Don't do my man Carl like that.

Music is too loud and too much in your face. There are next to no edits at all. Some clips aren't even funny. Some clips are way too long.
---
Cow Tree pallet (the wall with a tree with a butchered cow pinned to it) is another God Pallet, if that's what you mean by Meat wall. 
---
There are other god pallets that are map specific, but only not all maps have them, and and you'd have to learn the loop for each one.
---
Fuck the lockers I'm hiding in that
---
Nice dude!
---
For me it depends on the teammate and if I brought a big balls item.
---
He isnt talking about that type of pass, the xbox version of ps plus is giving away DBD, he is saying if the base game is enough because he dont have money to buy the dlcs.
---
He probably murdered someone else in the shop with it.
---
Yeah but this way your chair might crack
---
I haven't participated in that much Legion gameplay, but it seems kind of a mix? On one hand, the old Legion was almost guaranteed the down, it just took a little while to secure it. On the other hand, new Legion may not be guaranteed a down as confidently due to the Frenzy changes, but can get one faster from the 115. Like a bit of a trade off?  
---
I think I kinda simplified it, but it's what I've noticed from the handful of games I've played as or against.
---
Even in PTB days there was plenty of hate though.
---
Nonetheless: This piece is amazing :D
---
Gabriel Dropout
---
This man saved the USA from an alien invasion
---
Their peak strength is lower, since franks+cold dirt isnt the same. Otherwise its a buff; get a free hit, then play like a normal killer
---
I main pig so why the hell do i never get these as dailys?
---
ah yes the dbd killer that lasted two weeks bhvr should take lessons from them
---
R/perkbydaylight I believe is the subreddit about doing it
---
Legion is bad though. It's hard to pip when survivors insta dc for seeing you
---
This pleases me.
---
If you know how to play survivor you might be able to predict where a survivor will go based on your experience as one. This is very subjective, I myself just played killer to get better at it.
---
Im only leaving in that case if NOED is active, then I turn into a little bitch going straight for the exit.
---
There's also some planning involved too. You break pallets in the area with unfinished gens, chase the guy away (or hook them), and harvest the area afterwards. You can lead survivors for empty areas too in chases.
---
Basically Harvest Moon, you clear the area from debris and after a while you ripe your crops. And give gifts to the Harvest Godess.
---
Oh no... was that a sabo toolbox used on a GEN?
---
Insidious next to the basement chest. Big spooky!
---
Last night was playing against a Plague. Someone destroyed Haunted Grounds while I was being chased, and I ended up on the hook until almost the end of the second hook state.
---
Jump to end game, she has NOED - hooks one, slugs another. I go 99 the gate, and start looking for NOED. Can't find it, so I assume it's in the corner of the map where she's hanging out (also where my teammates are). I manage to get both the heal and the unhook before she catches me.
---
Unfortunately no one made it out, but I don't regret not opening the gate and leaving.
---
It helps for sure.
---
Quick question, are you playing the game with stereo headphones?  Survivors make a lot of noise when they're injured by the killer and directional audio queues are extremely important for tracking them when you lose line of sight.
---
Wallhack perks don’t need incentives to be run. It’d be great if every time someone healed in your terror radius you gained bp from nurses calling but it’s unnecessary. Enduring doesn’t need more incentive. People will run this shit already, so why reward the perks that are already easy picks. 
---
BP bonuses belong on things like the add-ons padded jaws or speed limiter. If you’re good enough that you can play with a handicap and STILL do well, then fuck yeah you deserve a ton of blood points. Otherwise it’s the equivalent of adrenaline or balanced landing having a bp bonus and saying “oh yeah well I’d run it anyway even without the effect”. Sure you would. I’ll believe it when I see every killer running beast of prey because “the effect doesn’t matter, people only run it for the bp”.
---
Geistras sky pack
---
I honestly can't even get mad when a nurse kills me on console
---
use the come here gesture right next to the idiot you want to slap.
---
bonus points if you slap them on the ass while they're opening the exit gate.
---
But hes a pedophile...
---
could help you and also give you a better mindset overall about the state of the game and understanding problems from both side
---
It's a game without a casual mode, so you're allowed to practice during ranked matches, even if it'll reduce your chances of winning. 
---
If you don't want to do that though, then you can run the killer shack loop as long as possible for practice, then tank the hit instead of dropping pallet, and move on. It'll remove bloodlust and give you a speed boost to reach another safe non-god pallet to loop. Then you can practice looping and dropping other pallets. Once you know you can occupy the killer for several seconds on the Shack, then another 2 minutes on other pallets, you can feel free to use the god pallet, since that should be 3 or 4 gens done.
---
As long as you:
---
1: never camp god pallets
---
2: never drop god pallet without looping
---
3: never get hit through pallet (look behind you. If they can hit you without lunging, don't drop.)
---
Then any god pallet you use is better than half of god pallets. That said, unless you're injured and have already been hooked, saving a god pallet to loop again later is probably worth getting injured over.
---
Sounds like a porn title
---
It's a mod for the game
---
My life at dbd and gmm crossroad lol! Didn't expect this!
---
what is the 2020 road map?
---
1. What perks would you recommend that synergies with plague? 2. Nurse is the only one who can't be looped to an extent, so the plague becomes a slower T3 myers with tracking (injured crys)
---
Same, I run both, with leader and balanced landing. Good mix of bp farming and easy win perks. Survivors don’t need much to get ahead.
---
No. It was to make legion less broken and to have them play as intended. Legion is better then they were
---
You’re an immature brat.  Your petty arguments serve no purpose and I see no point in squabbling with you considering you downvote everything.
---
Its changing some files in the folder and adding pictures in the folder. Some consider it moding some dont.
---
@Oicmorez yea no shit I had to edit off of my phone I’m not using a computer smartass and the clips arnt supposed to be funny not every single fucking dbd compilation has to be funny dumbass
---
Fuckin rights boys!
---
there are those with the big gay. you are the opposite. you are the big good.
---
Yeah sometimes you just gotta accept a 4k isn't gonna happen and move on. 3 is plenty great. 
---
Besides, based on how many points the killer had and the escaped survivor they still did pretty well for themselves. 
---
4k is kinda luckier than ever now with the new hatch mechanics. I had a match last night where not a single gen was completed and with only 1 survivor left I couldn't find the hatch anywhere. Finally found it and the survivor was just crouching on it. Stupid survivor didn't want to jump through until she saw me looking at her. So I closed the distance and shut it before she jumped and chased her around until the entity killed her.
---
Teammate gets hit by killer and proceeds to still press space afterward instead of using the extra speed to gain distance. It's almost always the shack pallet guhhhh.  
---
And, yeah, the DC after being found first. Shame
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Billy isn’t uncountetable tho? Unless he’s using insta-saw, he’s pretty fair in terms of gameplay. He can be looped, but has ways to try and bait or shorten them. He has strong snowball and down potential, but since he can be looped, it’s not as bullshit as a slugging nurse who can finish you off no matter where you run to.
---
I'm relatively new, but what's the benefit of 99%-ing the gate rather than just opening it before going for the save?
---
That is exactly what modifying something is Lololol
---
I play killer to know the killer and play the survivor to know what the kiler might do

I'll take immature brat, that's fine, at least I know how to play the game. I get it honey, you're feeling insecure because you can't play well and you're getting defensive. Don't worry about it.

As I said, some people do more advanced modding then copy pasting. But you do you. Stay salty my friend.

I'm not salty, the guy asked how it's done, I told him it's a mod, someone told me it isn't and now you're chiming in to tell me people don't always consider it a mod?

Lololol a mod is a modification to a game.  It is literally that.

Tier 4 Micheal wants to know your location

It was a quick and precise wheeze

My friend.
---
It doesnt make them useless, you can still catch up to people and either bodyblock them or force them another direction, but yeah, cant actually down them in Feral Freny which sucks
---
Sorry to be that guy but... Carl &gt; ghostface.
---
You think it’s bad now, back a few weeks ago there was literally nothing a killer could do about the hatch except wait for the survivor to find it. At least you can close it now. Now you know to keep an eye out for the hatch spawn next time.
---
Lol what the
---
I suspect folks in here haven’t played against an efficient legion. You can easily injure 3-4 players before the first gen. Usually a few hooks if Ruin stays up. He’s not awful. I enjoy both sides of play now.
---
I think it's a nerf. I'm glad that they fixed the glaring issues like moonwalking but for some reason, they also made legion slower, vault pallets slower and have a much longer fatigue. Legion felt really nice because of how fast they felt but now they feel really sluggish.
---
I find it a buff. Even ppl I play with who play killer a lot said legion sucked but after the change they love it. The biggest change I see with him is you can’t do any cheap tactic with him and you have to use his power just to slow the game down and because his speed increase it sorta does force survivors to either heal or deal with being a 1 hit down all the time and you can combine that with sloppy to slow fully healing and also thanatophobia to really slow gen speed. To use this killer now is all about knowing how to use his power to really slow the game down
---
Borrowed time main here. Take me, not my friends. More fun.
---
LEERRROOOOY
---
I love that Ashy Slashy is also screaming
---
I love how this argument is used to justify trash players in dbd for both survivors/killers. “Someone ruined the game for me, and you just so happened to be the person I’m gonna take my anger out on”. People need to not take this game so seriously lol

End game collapse would leave you with limited time left to escape. 99% means tap and go when ready.

I try my best not to tunnel an obsession with dying light on, ik its unfun to deal with haha

What's the point of this post, did monto make an oopsie?
---
sauce?
---
I think your response is a little OTT mate. I don't want to dance. I don't want a million emotes added. I simply want to bitch slap other survivors. That is all. I'm sure it would not kill the game.
---
Chill with the doom and gloom. Go have an ice cream or something and think some happy thoughts.
---
Re: Friday 13th. I think a few dance emotes were the least of its problems personally.
---
I guess I don't understand the comment?
---
Change it to 200% and only reward safe unhooks... or 25% for unhook and an additional 25% safe reward.
---
&gt; Coby
---
Awesome :)
---
Original?
---
You're a patch or two behind.
---
Are the bloodpoints earned in-game or like BBQ and WGLF?
---
I was going to guess colour blind setting. I use to turn colour blind settings on in COD so that my hud mini map colours were pink and yellow and not red and white or whatever it was
---
BBQ and WGLF.
---
The amount of XP gained is based on game duration but there is a cap-ish.
---
If you play a 10 minutes game it will reward you with 600xp. If you play a 20 minutes game it will reward you almost the same amount (these aren't the exact numbers, just a rough example). 
---
Playing survivor is faster because you don't waste as much time playing close to the cap. You play for 5 minutes, die and jump in the next match. 
---
Playing killer on the other hand, you are stuck in that match until it is over either by killing all survivors or having them escape, which isn't always in your full control (if you have 2 survivors just hiding, for example).
---
They changed that with the latest update, the endgame collapse.
---
Hatch always opens for the last survivor but now the killer can kick it closed which opens up the exit gates.  If you do kick it closed it activates both NOED and Adrenaline.
---
Are you asking for the original template or if the post is original?
---
Original template
---
Okay. Thank you
---
You spawned in, that is a classic blunder. Some survivors don't like that.

---
That'll make WGLF even more useless.  
---
If it were me, I'd just increase WGLF max bp gain and maybe give some other perks in-game buffs.
---
I dont blame them for doing it, But they cant complain at people mori'ing tunnelling or the worst one: "Streamsniping" them when their username show them as a "sellout" (Also for the record, 90% of the "twitch streamers" i go up against aren't even live)
---
Can't really blame the surviving guy for the bad manners though, you only netted 16k blood points which means you probably camped, tunneled or one or two hook killed some of them.
---
A survivor beat your blood point score by 4k Lolololol
---
but the endgame is 2 or 3 mins tops, why would you try to save time there when other perks are much better at saving time the over the other 10 mins..  id rather save 30% of 10 mins then 75% of 2 mins is what I'm trying to say. and that endgame heal is countered by noed anyway, dead hard/mom is much more useful versus noed
---
No0b3 himself literally says he 3 gens himself all the time and never pays attention to gen position. He messes up on stream a few times and is definitely not as consistent as some other streamers.
---
I think the wife thing is just trigger stuff to get free karma.
---
Ya know what your right, gotta give hugs not stabs.
---
P3-claudettes:”the fuck is that??”
---
You've gotta learn to see the game in the survivors' eyes; would you have liked it if some random person just went and stabbed you?
---
Very active at least I find games as survivor very very fast. Killer it depends time of day
---
Quentin Face rework confirmed?
---
I'd pay real money to bring this in my games
---
This is the problem I have with the game:
---
\-I run the killer for 5 gens, so what did I REALLY do: I bought everyone so much time that 5 gens were done and I did not go down. So in MY opinion that should be red evader, gold gens, gold altruisme and gold survival.
---
\-I down all survivors in 30seconds with tier3 Myers: What did I acctually do, I ended the game in 1minute time and I won every chase. So in MY opinion that should be red gatekeeper, silver hooking, red chaser and gold devious.
---
The games ranking system does not account for good players, it punishes bad people and pleases normal people, good players are treated worse than bad players.
---
I'm still trying to catch up to a survivor just running around a rock because bloodlust won't trigger, let alone taking my chances the other three might run to pallets *and* drop them before time.
---
:/
---
Pretty killer sided these days. Nerfing survivors has shown that you always have at least 2 team mates that clearly shouldnt be at the same rank as you. Every solo game i play is like a 3 or 4k no matter the killer. Playing killer is easy if you use a good killer. I wish i could say "if i use a top tier surv i always get to win!" i guess as long as killers have low tier killers theres an excuse to have an "op" tier? Playing spirit is pretty much an automatic win for me.  If the game could actually match equally skilled survivors together then id say the game is pretty balanced. It amazes (or does it?) me killers still complain after theyve gotten every nerf they ever asked for back in the day.
---
I get a full lobby almost immediately on both sides
---
I'm super excited!
---
I'm wondering if any addons will get changed. I'm not sure how drastic the power change will be, but will my favourite addons the Pill Bottle and Class Photo still work?
---
normally i would point out that teabagging at the exit gates is incredibly toxic and then point out that makes you a bad person
---
but since he tunneled that claudette and ignored you injured right in front of him when he could have downed you to solely focus on claudette to ruin her fun im going to say it was justified in this case
---
Literally just spent like 10 minutes making this but okay.
---
If you're going to claim repost link the original then.
---
*Edit - I dug around and found [this.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bv7pyq/invisible_noises/) Completely not a repost since it's my own joke and I spent time to recolor the characters but okay.
---
Nope.
---
Sweet I'm currently 17
---
fair enough. although i don't believe behavior would stop with simple emotes once they had people paying for them. 
---
for the record, i never really felt my comment was full of gloom and doom, but i respect that you feel that way. 
---
as far as Friday 13th is concerned, you're not entirely wrong, but even with the bugs and glitches it was still a fun experience. but people really went overboard with the emotes.
---
anyway, cheers!
---
i didn't camp or tunnel, they literally ran around like 3 hooks and only really ran away when there were two left, found the non rank 4 hooked him for the third time and then the rank 4 genned and jumped. I can be upset because a RANK 4 was playing against a RANK 13 and if i did outscore him then i wouldn't have been mad because of the fact that hey i had a chance, this just shows how little of a chance I actually had this game.
---
Also I would like to point out that in two games, one before that and one after that I double pipped and 4 Iri'ed.

I mean, you’re not wrong. I’m just glad we’re getting a bunch of cool representation.
---
We just need Jeff Goldblum.
---
I mean I think Legion in is current state is fine.
---
He's a first hit killer who can spread the pain and stall survivors by forcing them to mend.
---
He has tracking, stall, and first hit potential.
---
Your Idea appears to just be worse first hit potential, and stall, without tracking.
---
It is not the reason why people run meta killers at top ranks but it did increase the number even at lower ranks.
---
This would be nice, Being slugged with no options of escape is one of the most boring and annoying stats imo.
---
If at least 4 gens and half, maybe all 5 gens, are not done by the time he gets to tier three in that addon your team is doing something wrong.

Wglf does not work for farming now tho, does not grant points without secure save
---
She's a good killer and all 3 of her perks are good, spirit fury especially is a required perk on any M1 killer.
---
Story of my life.
---
When she blinks simply run at her, or run off to the side of her blink.
---
I believe the actual values are the same(3 minutes) and only the text changes.
---
&gt;That's for Killer's Chaser emblem, Survivors get more points the longer a chase lasts.
---
Your points caps at 60s, then you need to completely evade the killer in order to start a new chase.
---
HYPE
---
Cashier carl is ghostface im calling it
---
Bahahah😂💀 Imagine both of them in the game. I would buy them with every outfit they'll sell.
---
I guess you can't protect from stream sniping but bring in a mori just for a twitch person is a real dick move. Yea sure a lot of them are toxic but, like, just don't do it.
---
Its a nerf. Its fair since legion was insane before. They had above average map pressure with FF and could use it without any risk due to it not needing to be fully recharged; for this same reason it was easier to inflict deepwounds. Legion could also down in a reasonable amount of time with no counterplay except lucky pallet stuns or ocasional jukeing to buy a few seconds. Typicaly before the update legion could down a survivor in around 40 seconds.
---
After the update it takes tremendously longer to gain FF and the power itself is slower makeing map traversal with it unviable and due to the extended stun it provides no zoneing potential. In addition due to this it makes chaining deepwounds very difficult and almost near imposible against good survivors that are spread out. Legions ability in chase has also been gutted tremendously due to the charge metre changes and his inability to damage the deep wounds bar.
---
Was it a necesary change? Yes. was it overboard? Yes. Is legion a good killer now? no.
---
Hatch is always open now? The videos I watched did not mention that. Just how to trigger end game.
---
The killer has separation anxiety. It is either stay on the hook or watch them break all the palates because they're upset.
---
Why on earth are people taking 40 seconds to self care against legions with sloppy butcher then? It’s so easy for him to get his frenzy hit, it makes self caring pointless. Plus when he hits you, he can see nearby teammates, and apply pressure to them, knowing you’ll just be mending and self caring for the next minute, since you’ve been so obsessed with being full health every other time he’s found you
---
Those 2 minutes are your survival though. I get what you're saying, number wise, which is the same reason I always used Botany Knowledge over Well Make It. When Self Caring, especially when mangled, it's more of a time saver than Well Make It. But.. Well Make It can heal a survivor before the killer even gets a chance to return to hook (if they do return to hook).
---
While the numbers make sense, you need to remember the opportunity cost. Maybe at the lower ranks it's not worth it, since getting to endgame is hard enough. I can tell you as a consistent monthly Rank 1 Survivor &amp; Killer, it's one of, if not the, strongest perk in the game. Again, I really recommend playing killer. I started off as a killer main and hated Adrenaline more than DS.
---
Doctor and Hag were the only ones who weren't _done did dirty_ with on their _reworks_.

tbh same. I don't even know which of them I would main, probably both playing for an unhealthy amount of hours. And now that we have Ash with some voicelines how cool would it be for Cindy and Brenda having some as well!
---
he said,   "THAT'S WHY YOU GET THE FIRST HIT AND TUNNEL AS LEGION. ONLY WAY TO TAKE DOWN A DECENT SURVIVOR WITH LEGION.
---
1. Thanks for the suggestions, but can you explain how they synergise with plague? I don't see it. 
---
2. I love spirit, I would consider her my main, so yeah, and I forgot about hag... You're right about them.
---
I have to remind myself that their stated goal with killers is "fun", not viability...as if those two are different things to killer mains.

Platform: PC 
---
Type of Bug: Gameplay/Visual 
---
Description: If a survivor has adrenaline or unbreakable and a killer attempts to pick them up when either pops, the survivor will instead slide away in the dying state animation and then return back to the normal injured running animation after a few seconds. 
---
Steps to Reproduce: with unbreakable, have the killer pick up the survivor as soon as the recovery progress bar hits 100%; with adrenaline have the killer pick up the survivor in a similar fashion (i.e.
---
As soon as the the last generator pops) 
---
Expected result: the survivor will be picked up by the killer and their perk will be put on hold until they are no longer disabled 
---
Actual result: killers attempting to pick up a survivor will instead see the survivor zooming away in the dying state animation and then returning to the normal injured running animation 
---
Chance of Occurring: about 3-4% 
---
Specs: External 500gb SSD, GeForce 1060 Graphics Card
---
Literally. I feel like I’ve done my job if I save someone and they get out even if I die.
---
The Wraith rework was honestly fine imo. He went from low tier to mid tier
---
He had to be stopped and learn a lesson.
---
Idk is it?
---
He can just drop immediately and mori anyway..
---
It's probably a completely reworked power tbh. Putting a cooldown on his original power would make him a tunneling killer, which is worse.
---
Sadly, sounds survivors make are bugged and not directional right now, sometimes the sounds they make can't be heard by the killer, devs are working on the fix so lets hope they get the fix for the next update.
---
Yup
---
I'd imagine XB has something like the PS4 Sharefactory you can use to make some pretty cool looking edits. You have some alright footage but some good editing would make any video much more watchable. 
---
Also not being a dick helps

What is this 4K every1 talks about?
---
I won't kick but I'm not helping him up
---
he can drop
---
I dislike when he uses a meme build I use because people go from "wow cool build, thanks for sharing" to "Oh a Monto fanboy" D,:
---
It seems to be.
---
For the record this template was made by u/ZombieHuggerr, which is why I'm not labeling *this* as an OC.
---
I'm a huge fan of current Freddy .. any chance they refund all my bloodpoints after they rework him? I have P3
---
I was wondering why people done that... I just walked up and grabbed them out haha.
---
Imma need the sauce beloe
---
You cant always relay on loops though. Sometimes there might not be pallets, windows will get locked out, and circles wont last forever. You can loop for awhile but a killer will always catch up to you. 
---
And yea, I am rank 15, I'm not a pro player i play casually, but i understand how the  game works.
---
Can’t Mori downed people with the tombstone, only injured or healthy survivors. If he forces you off his shoulder you can run to a pallet or hop back into the locker again.
---
It's rare for me to go against a smart legion, I don't think I have been grabbed out of a locker by one yet, I mean hell the basment tec works best on legions as well
---
That still depends who the worlds best killer is playing with. Doesn’t matter how good they are, if they’re not playing one of the top chase killers, they aren’t going to beat the 4 best survivors on crotus penn or haddonfield. Many parts of this game are way too unbalanced towards one side or the other too the point where it doesn’t matter how good they are.
---
Oh yeah im sure about it, if they are 6m away from you, the sound they make (footsteps, breathing) is no longer precise, and they grunts of pain are not directional aswell
---
Lol, why’re you so mad? I gave my reasons as to why this isn’t that original and you’re throwing a fit.
---
My friend
---
only works if they fix all gens
---
My point is theres some op killers that they wont nerf, so I dont get why they gotta nerf survivors op perk.
---
I didn't play legion in the scummy way people did before the rework, Maybe that's why I'm not so basic attack happy.  I'm still trying to get my head around his rework.  I mostly just apply pressure and then lunge through pallets most the time haha.
---
Good to know. Lol
---
4 kills.
---
It's obvious they were reacting to the toxic flashlight. I do the same thing.
---
seriously, its pretty absurd that you can hit someone and do no harm at all, except to yourself. they could have just decreased the mend bar reduction.
---
*sarcasm* you mean I’m not supposed to lead the killer to my friends on a generator??????

they stream mainly on their official youtube channel

but as they might was to pull as many people as possible i can see how they might go live on their twitch also

How long from now?

I keep my prayer beads + yakuyoke ONLY for these kinds of scenarios
---
Why do people like Carl so much?
---
Just curious, I'm legitimately clueless. I'd love to know what the charm is.
---
I was just throwing something out. I don’t agree with op as another perk would make my personal build far better(running bl, self care, and no mither instead of adren and sb) due to the injured requirement.
---
Obligatory r/beetlejuicing
---
I think it starts at 3:00 eastern time
---
True, true, Some people dont really care about that though, But it is a good point
---
I wonder if we will get new faces, if it’s true that licensed killers are getting cosmetics?
---
I think it just depends honestly. Same here but on PS4. Will get fast games, and then nothing after a while.
---
Tombstone Myers can't mori someone who is in dying status.
---
If you look at his older DBD stuff he seems much happier and looks like he's actually having fun. I think playing this game so much has had quite a heavy impact on his attitude and made him quite cynical.
---
I was just giving examples to why it shouldn't be implemented.  
---
Imagine a survivor build consisting of Deliverance, MoM, Adren, DS and DH/BL; if all the survivors ran that, would that be fun for anyone?
---
3PM EDT(around an hour and a half)
---
Tbh I'd use both perks other than help me
---
He stalked her through the window while sitting on a tree with binoculars?
---
What? The killer gets a 'death' credit if a survivor bleeds out.
---
😂 I’ve done this a lot but only if it’s with a killer I’m new to
---
Doesnt count towards rank
---
Legion is already tied for last though
---
Pig can get really easy grabs with her addon
---
It was
---
Legion is better than before wtf
---
You're forgetting the part that makes it better, too.  
---
Wraith needs to uncloak in order to do anything; the survivors know where he is while uncloaking, but Pig doesn't need to notify the survivors every time.
---
They made his add ons better, took away his built in bloodhound perk while cloaked and gave him the speed boost coming out of cloak (that was the old windstorm add on set).
---
I play both and idk why but leatherface is just more fun to play as. It maybe because its leatherface and hes my favorite slasher besides Ghostface. Soon even bubba will be forgotten for ghostface
---
Oh it was because I was putting spaces in their name :(
---
Bing Bong was made a hell of a lot more viable with his rework.
---
Trapper still sucks, but he sucks a lot less than he used to.
---
Wraith can do the same with his Coxcombed Clapper - an ultra rare add-on.
---
Honestly the new way some people play legion is so gross and boring.
---
then why did you make your first comment? and what if i had just posted the ranks? like what would you have said then. Like to me it was the fact that there was a rank 4 in my lobby. Like thats the only reason i posted it, the comment yes was a little salty, but i played the game good and did good chases, and thats what your commenting on based on the points.
---
Becasue the devs refuse to give Pig some love. Me and atleast 20 other people have all suggested things like: Addon reworks, crouch buffs, trap buffs, memes and more. Some people stay stupid stuff like make Tampered timer permanant, but some of us have some perfect ideas that would her better while keeping her the Pig. The devs however buffed her once in the almost 1.5 years she has been out and it was quickly followed by a bigger nerf. Atleast she will be getting some skins.
---
Yea... but pig is just a better killer ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I'd say let WGLF act like Borrowed Time for the unhooker.
---
I was all with you until you said small game. But yeah, in general, I do agree that some of the perks need to be looked at for a rework.
---
Wraith does it better aswell, with his addon you hear nothing, with Pig you lose 75% of your second power and they can still hear and she you better.
---
But she then loses 75% of her other power.
---
I think Wraith with his best add-ons(Windstorm + Swift Hunt) is better than Pig with her best.  
---
If we don't consider add-ons, I agree.
---
I'm not saying it's a bad perk, I'm saying killer specific boons shouldn't exist. Even a BP gain when clearing totems could be a replacement.
---
Yea true
---
you do realize camping is one of the worst things a killer can do,  
---
it takes 2 minutes for a survivor to completely die on hook.  
---
if all three survivors work on 3 different gens, they can get 3 gens done by the time the survivor dies and still have 40 seconds to do other gens
---
this doesn't account for the time before the survivor got hooked.
---
Camping gives you no BP, it lets the survivors do gens, uncontested and you get no emblem points for it.  
---
Killers can camp and yeah its annoying, but they will lose the game
---
Which is why I was saying Wraith's is better; probably should've made it clearer, though.
---
Yeah it really wouldn’t. All i have to say though is imagine dead hard but worse.
---
Does he oink tho?
---
1. Wraith was first stealth based killer, the addon for him was back when aura reads were much less common.
---
2. the Wraith addon had a stronger varient that doubled the effective range, his addon rework changed the effect for the stronger version while leaving the old one alone.
---
3. Pig has two abilities while Wraith has one, it makes sense that an addon that bolsters one of her abilities would be less common.
---
Big advantage for Pig on any killer, tbh.
---
Your score says otherwise about you playing the game well and having good chases.
---
I understand your frustration about playing against a rank 4 but that has little to nothing to do with your bloodpoint total at the end of the match.
---
It better, or Better yet a Scooby Doo DLC would actually blow my mind. Imagine how much more popular this game would be.
---
He had a pig video up recently where he spent way too much time chasing a survivor at the start (which hurt him quite badly, he lost 2 gens because he had no pressure) then started complaining the gens are going too fast. Like dude stop wasting time in this one area and go put some pressure on the other survivors.
---
Change that yakuyoke to the add-on that makes the duration considerably longer king
---
Good to know we are on the same page, I just hate how it took the devs longer thab a year to buff the Pig only to then wait 2months and take something away again. Is it really so hard to give my goddess some love?
---
I feel like you need to tunnel which I hate doing... I feel like the whole timer doesn't go down just makes him a shit killer.  May as well take it off him.
---
~~Man trying to get some~~
---
I have actual fantasies about this with the OG monster the Black Knight being the killer, That alone would be a epic killer idea.
---
Ok thanks man.
---
I told people when I made my tierlist her oinks got her to S tier. WHO IS LAUHING NOW?!
---
That's what I was thinking!
---
I wish Pig would be more viable, too; she's really fun to play.
---
Those people are gate keeping elitist incels tbh
---
It literally freezes lol
---
Nobodys talking about trappybois new ability of forceing the abandonment of loops.

I can empathise with his mindset since I'm kinda the same, once I start playing a new game I don't expect to win and will look at things I need to improve on, but once I start getting better arrogance and excuses begin to flow. I think it's just a pride thing he has, he knows he's a good player and hates losing, so he comes up with excuses to make himself look better.
---
noob question, does increasing duration also increase the time to recharge? I tried to google it but couldnt find the answer
---
Naw but it allows you to yank people off from longer distances
---
Uh... lithe
---
why
---
.....bugged? Do explain?
---
I thought this was pre-order exclusive?
---
haha remember me is a God like perk once the hatch gets closed
---
KWF? No way a normal player wouldn't just take a swipe at Dwight.
---
To clarify I’m not complaining that wraith has the add on. I love my bing bong boy (he’s prestige 1 now) and imo it’s one of his weaker purple addons. I just don’t understand what motivated the discussion to make pigs iridescent is so incredibly bad by comparison.
---
Crossplay is one of them. So far there are only 3 crossplay games. The new call of duty announced it will be crossplay so it's entirely possible.
---
Shirtless Ian... Take my fucking money !
---
People that complain about camping just use it as a an excuse for their shit playing.

Carl is my spirit animal

His videos are super helpful for both Killer and Survivor. Plus he has such a chill attitude
---
We had a hardcore tunneling legion with a ebony mori, it was just so boring
---
You don't lure kids in by being sexy, now do you?
---
Don't play too stealthy. Killer is just another one like you ;)

The person unhooked should see the aura for 4 seconds and that’s it. You get the points, they get a heads up if the killer is headed back towards the hook.
---
I did! All paper mache and thick foam for the ears. [Here's a little slideshow of some of the process](https://imgur.com/a/XiJabxW)
---
Yeah that's what I'm saying.  Did it come across as otherwise?
---
Oh wait I’m dumb I misread I thought you said hag got done dirty
---
Yeah bro, you should just get a free 2nd chance, I feel so bad for u
---
I feel like they should of nerfed the mix tape not him...
---
But still, the game is $10. Meanwhile, I had to pay $40 when they first did the promotion. They're not even exclusive anymore at that point.
---
It’s always the megs and neas.
---
can we just get a carl and sidney dlc?
---
👍
---
I even get mad when I play survivor and I see a teammate being toxic during and after game. Especially when the killer doesnt deserve it and went out of their way to he fair while being t-bagged
---
&gt; You can't completely evade, then you get none. You have to be close to them to get anything.
---
&gt; 
---
Evading the killer after a chase without getting hit = winning that chase. If the chase lasts over 60s, by evading you earn those points and the next chase will reward you entirely new points.
---
A definite nerf. And kind of a shotgun nerf too. What I mean by that is that if you played Legion properly, and didn't just cheese the mechanics or hyper tunnel someone, they were an alright killer. But there were the people abusing some cheese strats, which definitely had to go. As a result, tjey also nerfed Legion for us eho played them the right way. Again, moonwalkimg and hyper tunneling really needed to go, I just don't think they adequately compensated us normal players and were too focused on punishing the cheesers.
---
Didn’t they already change it to safe unhooks only?
---
If it helps your team  its helping you. More directly, folks would heal and unhook you faster, no?
---
I legitimately finally had to re-evaluate my life and figure out "I need to change the activate ability key for dead hard from 'e' to a mouse key". It actually helped a ton since one of my issues was having to use a finger geared for movement to dead hard mid chase. Now I can just maintain direction and aim just fine. Well...mostly xD
---
Not gonna lie, if buying it on Steam got me the masks on PS4 DBD I'd totally buy it right now :/
---
Poor state? It's the best it's ever been and the devs are aggressively developing and patching the game.
---
Thank you all. You've helped a lot
---
I have the same set of quests in my arsenal right now haha
---
My favorite is when you completely thrash their team but they find hatch and act like they wouldn't be dead in a second if they weren't lucky as shit
---
That's a good idea. The killer can be a velociraptor or t-rex 😁
---
Ill take that over the nurse and huntress ones i get. Literally level 5 on both characters and i cant hit their abilities to save my life
---
when will the devs give us what we really want? #JusticeforCarl
---
He’s a golden god!
---
Does the pallet stun with enduring override frenzy cooldown or is it a double stun, because even a pallet stun without enduring is faster than frenzy cooldown.
---
49 min
---
Well if we want to use your example: it alerts the killer to your location, pulling them towards you, and letting your other teammates do gens safely. Rewarding overall progress.

I think it’s mostly a beer belly than actual full on chub

Wasn’t this meme *just* posted? Also don’t ruin a wholesome meme, let it stay wholesome.

Could that killer tunnel any longer. Literally a dwight right there ripe for a smack and the killer does not even care lol

---
what are you even talking about?
---
Both
---
nice, thanks
---
No I really struggle to catch up. It's often a boulder or something similar and it's like the survivor has a smaller collision box so they can run a tighter circuit. It gets worse, probably impossible if I'm playing a slower killer like Huntress.
---
And that's not even getting into the suffocation pit loop which is too large for entity blocking to trigger or bamboozle to stay up until the next loop.
---
Though maybe I'm just bad because it's near impossible for me to catch up to a survivor in the two T walls with two windows until they run away from it because not only do they get five lightyears of warning space, if I try to mindgame as Pag, they freely run away whilst I can't see them. :(
---
Technically it’s not exactly the same, but yeah, it is incredibly similar and a low effort change.

Yeah it was a very prominent thing for traders, but now people just do it for memes or to show anger/appreciation.
---
If she just hit you the first time and continued tunneling then she wouldn't have had to deal with you later. XD
---
Very nice ! Playing nurse is very difficult, i prefer to play legion
---
“Normies”

I used to main nurse so I usually do okay (it's still frustrating knowing how good I used to be and missing a lot heh) 
---
But yeah I can't hit those hathets to save my life. I always throw that daily away
---
Watching tyde call hag d tier while having no traps down
---
While it may be funny to hear people get angry, the game would just become more toxic

They’re planning something...

Do you have a link to the stream on twitch?

I wanted to be Ghostface for Halloween so bad as a kid and I had no idea who he or the Scream franchise were haha

Yeah it's similar, I didn't know about this one though. Goes to show how this community can be incredibly toxic sometimes.

Its A O K

Cause we dont understand the reason you posted

Why not both

Oh damn, I always thought that perk was garbage. Will try it out, thanks!

You haven’t played for a year, do you know about the new killers

Give Borrowed Time literally zero counterplay? No thanks.

I only want it so I can hear them when I do a Myers gen grab. Or InstaFreddy.
---
Rising Storm 2 has prox chat for everyone, always funny to hear "I KILL YOU GI!" or "Welcome to the rice fields motherfucker" during a napalm strike.
---
"Good" memes are pretty few and far between around here, though.
---
I’m aware of the girl with the samurai sword (I stopped playing just before that was released). I also heard about the Legion which I thought looked like a dope design, but all I’ve heard about is that they’re trash lol. And I’ve seen snippets of the Plague (I think it’s called that, the one that pukes?) but I’m not aware of much about her. Not aware of any of the new survivors since Kate though
---
level up meg, her teachables are pretty good.
---
Can we get the Babadook as a killer at some point?
---
It comes down to knowing see I’m talking about that super altruistic team that always unhooks when you leave. So next hook you know they are there. Also there’s a term I like to call proximity camping but in this case it’s more of checking around a bit then leaving. 
---
Just because you don’t see the altruistic team doesn’t mean they aren’t there. 
---
Alright so I’m a trapper doing a daily in the game with 2 people left. I’m going after the god looper I finally get them down I walked away and they got instarescued. I found the god looper again so I chased them again ran into BT, DH and Decisive strike. But within that 5 minute chase again I saw the Kate a few times, but if I gave up on the god looper I may have to loop a good Kate so might as well try and get the god looper down. Also no gens where being done and 1 or 2 gens should’ve been done which also corrects my thinking that Kate’s here for the insta hook. 
---
Once I get her down I hook her and my bbq goes off but I don’t see Kate yes I know you can hide in lockers but I seriously doubt that. So knowing Kate I stayed around for a little bit to see what happens, low and behold here comes crouched Kate. 
---
End of story I won and predicted right.
---
Borrowed time isn’t a teachable fam
---
Do you know their powers
---
The new survivors are
---
Adam Francis 
---
Jeff Johansen 
---
Jane Romero
---
No mither should give survival points
---
I have absolutely no clue of the powers of the Legion or the plague. Nor do I have a clue about the survivors perks. Are they any good?
---
It is on pc, its Bill's teachable.
---
Ayyy join in on the cult fam we love Amanda here, she's really fun to play
---
It is on PC
---
When I play killer I always go after the weaker players first. So if someone is looking for more than like 45 seconds, I will abandon them and look for a player that cant loop as well.
---
Sad oink
---
Oh I’m a console player my bad. 
---
I always run BT so yeah I would recommend going for it
---
You complained about his manners for having the audacity to do a generator a little bit before jumping into the hatch, so I looked at your win screen again.
---
I would be salty too if I wanted to play with my friends and I faced off with a tunnel boi legion.  Did you even hook the rank 4 guy?  Did you chase him and immediately break off to go back to the hook?  I guess I don't understand how your score could be so low with a 3k, even when I have a bad killer round and only get two survivors I usually break 20k.
---
All I want is for him to keep his free wallhacks and for his power to still slow the game down.
---
A lot of Freddy mains are scared he's just gonna have a shitty chase power and nothing else.  Become yet another Clown/Legion
---
And he takes the form of whichever killer each survivor has lost the most games to
---
I see, very nice! You did a good job on it.
---
Legion: 
---
Feral frenzy: The Legion has a Frenzy power gauge that builds up over time. The power, Feral Frenzy, can be activated by tapping the Power button. While active, the power gauge drains rapidly and the power ends when the gauge is empty, triggering an extended recovery cool-down (3 seconds).
---
When activating Feral Frenzy, The Legion enters a deadly rage. While the power is active:
---
The Legion sprints faster than base movement speed.
---
The Legion can vault Pallets, but cannot break them.
---
Survivors' Scratch Marks and Blood Pools are hidden from The Legion's view.
---
Missing an attack ends Feral Frenzy.
---
While Feral Frenzy is active, hitting a Survivor who is not currently afflicted with the Deep Wound Status Effect:
---
Applies the Deep Wound IconStatusEffects deepWound.png Status Effect.
---
Injures the Survivor, if they are not already injured.
---
Refills The Legion's entire power gauge.
---
Triggers "Killer Instinct", revealing the location of all Survivors who do not have the Deep Wound Status Effect applied and are within The Legion's Terror Radius.
---
While Feral Frenzy is active, hitting a Survivor is currently afflicted with the Deep Wound Status Effect or missing an attack:
---
Depletes The Legion's entire power gauge and ends the power immediately.
---
NOTE: Hitting a Survivor with a basic attack while Feral Frenzy is not active will deplete the power gauge by half of its maximum.
---
Plague: vile purge: Hold down the Power Button to charge Vile Purge. Releasing the button unleashes a stream of infectious bile.
---
A Survivor hit by the stream becomes infected. A Survivor accumulates an amount of infection by being hit by the stream, running, or performing interactions. Environmental objects also become infected for a short duration when hit by the stream.
---
If the Survivor's infection indicator is completely filled, they are forced to vomit, and continue to do so at random intervals; they become injured, if they are not already, and gain the Broken IconStatusEffects broken.png Status Effect; and they pass on their infection to other Survivors, as well as environmental objects that they interact with.
---
Infected Survivors can remove all infection by interacting with a Pool of Devotion. This blocks it from further use by other Survivors. If the Survivor is injured, they become healthy. If all Pools of Devotion are corrupted at the same time, all Pools of Devotion revert to their clean state and The Plague automatically gains Corrupt Purge.
---
The Plague may consume the corruption at a Pool of Devotion that has previously been used by a Survivor. This removes the corruption from the Pool and transforms Vile Purge into Corrupt Purge. Corrupt Purge instantly damages any Survivors hit by the stream, but does not apply infection. This effect only lasts for a short duration.
---
There’s a couple good new survivor perks

Just wait till you see Jigsaw himself. Dude’s an absolute gilf.

Downvoters!!! I shall get you with my trappy snap snaps

[https://www.twitch.tv/deadbydaylight](https://www.twitch.tv/deadbydaylight)
---
Billy is perfect where he is.  Other killers should aim to be where he is if anything.
---
First of all you need to press Enter twice to make a new line on Old Reddit. Yeah Reddit is weird like that.
---
Anyways to awnser your questions:
---
* "Teachable Perks" are the Survivors' character specific perks. They are unlocked at level 1 on your character by default.  
---
In order to get them for other characters you have to buy them on the Bloodweb (Blood tree.) They will appear at levels 30, 35, and 40 respectively based on the order they appear on the character's Info page. (Example: Dwights perks appear in the order of Bond, Prove Thyself, and Leader. You unlock Bond at level 30, Prove Thyself at 35, and Leader at 40.)  
---
The other way to unlock teachable perks is through the Shrine of Secrets, which can be accessed through the store page. It uses the in-game currency of Iridescent Shards (the little red and blue triagles - not the red triangles those are Bloodpoints) and is a way to unlock Teachable perks without grinding or buying DLC characters. I recommend only using the Shrine to get teachables for characters you don't own but it's entirely up to you what you buy. Your money after all. :)
---
* Yes I was born for this! Okay so awhile ago I made a [Guide on what DLC to buy](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1547234731) based on tier list rankings for all the perks and the Killers. It's a little outdated ("last updated on December 25th, 2018" lol I need to get off my lazy ass for once) but I still think it's pretty accurate.  
---
If you want my quick recommendations for DLC to buy here's my choices:  
---
**Buy:** Spark of Madness (Doctor + Feng Min; very good beginner characters with good perks), SAW™ (Pig + David Tapp; another set of good beginner characters and while some of their perks are weak they also have some really good perks), Shattered Bloodline (Spirit + Adam Francis; mainly a Killer DLC but the Survivor has some good perks too)  
---
**Buy if Killer main:** The HALLOWEEN® Chapter (May as well buy Laurie too since the DLC isn't that much cheaper if you only buy Mikey. Michael Myers is very fun and very strong but Laurie kinda sucks), LEATHERFACE™ (essentially mandatory if you want to play Killer), The Hag (buy her seperately Ace's perks are bad but her perks are very good and she's a very strong Killer), The Clown (Kate's perks are weak but Clown has Bamboozle which is incredibly strong)  
---
**Buy if Survivor main:** Jeff Johansen (He has very good perks for solo play)  
---
**Consider if interested:** Darkness Among Us (While I suggest Jeff, Legion is a very strange Killer and can be hard to learn. He also requires a lot of perks to be useful and is not a good choice for new players despite his deceptively simple design), Ash Williams (buy him if you like the character, not for his perks since two of them are bad and one of them is going to be nerfed soon)  
---
**Avoid:** A Nightmare On Elm Street™ (Freddy is weak, Quentin is weak; do not buy.) Demise of the Faithful (I'm ashamed to say this as a Jane main but the newest DLC is very bad. Jane's perks are all very situational and The Plague is honestly very weak.)
---
* Pressing 1 and 2 on your keyboard (sorry if you're console IDK the controls) will make your Survivor do either a pointing action or a "come over here" action. It's a good way to communicate with people since this game lacks voice chat.
---
* Flashlights are hard to learn. I have a lot of hours in this game and still can't use them. Don't beat yourself up about it you'll learn eventually. :)
---
* Keys will open the hatch, yes. The hatch will only spawn when the amount of generators left to be done is equal to the amount of dead Survivors. In other words it'll spawn when all Survivors are alive and all gens are done, 1 Gen is left and 3 Survivors are left, or 2 Gens are left and 2 Survivors are left. If it's down to one Survivor the hatch will always spawn and open on its own.
---
Other than that some general advice:
---
* For teachable Survivor perks you made a good choice going with Claudette first. Self Care is essentially mandatory. After you get her to level 40 I'd recommend leveling up Nea Karlson, as you seem to be interested in unlocking Balanced Landing and Urban Evasion is a very strong perk as well. Other than that of the free characters Meg is a very good choice for Adrenaline as well as Sprint Burst. Dwight's perks can help for team play. Jake has access to Iron Will which is very strong but his other perks are rather weak.
---
* For Killers I think Leatherface is honestly where you should start, since his three teachable perks (particularly "Barbeque and Chili") are very strong. That being said if you don't want to pay an extra $5 for him I'd recommend Hillbilly first as all his perks are very strong and he's rather straightforward. (He can be hard to play though and I'd be lying if I said I knew how to play him.) The only other free Killer with good perks is Trapper, who has access to Brutal Strength and Agitation. Nurse has A Nurse's Calling but especially if you're on console she can be very hard to play. A lot of the good Killer perks are teachables (Hex: Ruin is from Hag, Discordance is from Legion, Spirit Fury is from Spirit, etc.) but you can honestly make due with the default Killer perks. Sloppy Butcher is a very strong choice that you have unlocked by default.
---
* Spend some time playing with the Survivor perk "Small Game" in order to learn where Totems spawn. It can be really helpful when you get into high ranks and start playing against Hex: Ruin or other powerful Hex perks.
---
* Also pro tip for generators: if it's affected by Ruin (the bar will be red) don't try too hard to hit Great checks. If you only hit a normal check let go of the generator until it stops sparking: it won't gain any progress while sparking but you can get more skill checks which will make you lose more progress.
---
* Oh and always look over your shoulder to make sure Michael Myers isn't watching you when you're repairing a gen. :)
---
its an hardware store.... duh
---
I love how survivors can just depip a killer by killing themselves on first hook, it's incredible.
---
I’ve already been a part of it thanks to the offerings letting me play. Normally don’t buy killers until I can try them somehow and see if I like them so thank god for the offerings
---
Imagine not being allowed to play with your friend because they dont play enough survivor to rank up. Haha.
---
Maybe it was a Easter egg.. Haha......... :/
---
Don't give me hope, don't you dare give me hope
---
Well they could implement ranked and not ranked mode
---
&gt; Whenever I play killer I seem to get a lot of 4 stack swf teams
---
According to devs stats killers face 4-man teams in less than 10% of games. You either very unlucky, or just overthink things.
---
Average should be 50% Survival rate. In other words two should escape and two should die.
---
Haters gonna hate. Congrats on your achievement, my dude!
---
Wow thankyou very much for this! Really appreciate it :). 
---
Are any of the new killers useable at high ranks ?
---
I rarely play killer so possibly bad luck and timing with it being half term holidays.
---
Played around 20 matches in the last two days
---
Had around 5 or 6 , 4 stacks
---
Congrats! That’s awesome
---
Legion is low tier but I main him and I do well at rank 6, I’ve played them since their launch
---
Plague is eh. She’s ok, I don’t play her she’s kinda boring
---
I dont know man...
---
You need to accept your miserable situation and just try to deal with it. Just like our pitty little survivors in the game. Do they lay down and just do suicide? No! They wait for life to catch em and hook the shit out of em. But still, they made a point.
---
Me when my rank 20 best friend playing default Dwight end up getting morried by rancor at the exit gates
---
How do you determine they're 4-mans, though?
---
Ohhhhh. I don’t have any of the dlc. Play just fine
---
plus with the pickup animation changes to smoothen it pretty much no one can make a save worth shit anymore
---
They should be unlocked automatically. Have you tried restarting the game?
---
Yeah
---
I still stand by it. What’s their number?
---
*before everyone hated him.* Impossible, perhaps the archives are incomplete.
---
The way they play and the fact they all join at once.
---
Happened to me also. End game collapse has so many bugs. Timer not slowing down when injured, time being normal when injured, game not ending afyer egc and forcing you to sc, etc.
---
If you run around a lot the effect will stay on people for another 15 seconds or so, fyi.
---
The picture in the bottom right has a pallet set up like they do in the game. Plus, what kind of hardware store has pallets just lying around, conveniently like DbD does?
---
But his way of playing survior doesn't really conclude that he's a try hard sometimes you get potatoes who can't loop and rather do Gens quickly , if the killer is primarily focusing on you, you can't be altruistic and do Gens at the same time, he's right about the surviors side ya know.
---
I doubt ghostface really cared about him
---
But how? Didn't you hear from the sub that Nurse is really bad on console and impossible to get kills with?
---
Do you mean simply injured, or dying state, because it only slows when a survivor is in the dying state
---
&gt; fact they all join at once
---
Not a way to tell SWF anymore. The latest changes to matchmaking made initial 4 survivors join simultaneously, even if they are 4 solos.
---
Would you rather the game have 0 players? lol.
---
They'll give you other items if you preowned the game before the relaunch.
---
Dying, I edited my comment to avoid confusion.
---
What would be his power?  Force teammates to kill their baby Dweets?
---
This is far, far more superior to our Ace.
---
I'd much rather have a Sydney archetype, the final girl.
---
Gotcha, was just making sure that you weren’t mistaken on the circumstances for slowed timer, have a good one
---
Not what what I've been seeing on xbox.
---
Rare that all 4 join solo and you can tell by the way they play.
---
Knowing things they wouldn't without communications.
---
no.
---
Restarting the game/console helped me when this happened the first time I bought a dlc. Does your PS4 say that the dlc is installed (in the main menu select dbd and press down on the d-pad, select Playstation Store, select your add-ons  and press X, it should say that it's installed)?
---
Why not?
---
I play more survivor, because of friends, but I find killer more satisfying, I play a lot of spirit
---
It’s installed and I’ve restarted the game but I’ll try restarting my console  thanks
---
I'm pretty sure it was the huntress. I could be wrong.
---
Ok, if you say so
---
Load in to the hospital map
---
Found guy one, hit him with frenzy (Rank 4 dude btw) Break off because heart beat, chase down that guy hit him once.
---
Another heartbeat so i go and i follow that guy i let frenzy run out and i swipe at him, follow him for first down and hook.
---
Then I turn around and I see scratch marks right behind me and hear a survivor kind of far away, I go into the room where i see scratch marks and the survivor who I had deep wounds on was mending, I down him, put him on a hook nearby.
---
I see more scratch marks Rank 4 (With borrowed time) Goes for first dude while I'm down the hallway I chase them down the hallway back to the hooked guy, I hit borrowed time guy and then hit him again as he is finishing taking off the other person on the hook.
---
I leave him on the ground and follow the person off the hook because I just borrowed timed him didn't feel right to hook him right again. I took the person from the hook and downed him, put him back on the hook and grabbed the first one.
---
As I pick him up I see survivor #4 pop up and take second hook down. I pop first hook up there and we are off to the races again.
---
I frenzy and follow non hooked guy and I get a nice hit drop off to go chase the heartbeat and its hooked survivor. I drop frenzy and down him, hook him without really thinking about it he dies.
---
Then Survivor one is unhooked again, I'm still near that hook because we are in the hospital and they don't know how to run out of this one corner so I grab the non hooked survivor hook him and then Rank 4 heals other survivor. I chase after the rank 4 frenzy hit to get the other guy, down him (Now is the point to mention rank 4 and other guy were both Davids, i didn't really take the time to figure out which one I had hooked in the heat of the moment.) Then I see the other survivor get taken down I hook first hook and kill him.
---
Then i find the once hooked guy and hook him again he dies and then the gen thing happened. I don't really know why i didn't get as many points. My frenzies weren't super long like usual but hey I was just a little miffed at the end. Then I saw the rank 4 and I got a little blood crazy so I commented as well when I probably shouldn't have but hey now you know I didn't tunnel they just decided to play musical hooks and was I supposed to just let them?
---
1. Patrol gens. At the start of the game, pick the 3 gens that are closest to each other and circle them. If a chase takes too long, break off and go back to your gens. 
---
At low ranks, you will get at least 3 kills this way and learn how to play killer
---
2. I’m a survivor main
---
I didn’t have an even to begin with. Now I have -1 evens.
---
And if they aren't 4 stacks 
---
How are rank 10-2s ending up in my lobby when I'm rank 15 ?
---
What was your last achievement?
---
Yup. For example you throw a bottle but gas doesn't appear/the bottle explodes in your hand. Another one is: you throw a bottle, they run through the gas but it does nothing ;)
---
How about this tip for killers? Don't let survivors spam you away from patrolling the gens when you have a good grouping.
---
1. Get some experience on both sides. Play a little bit of survivor, find where you usually ending up hiding. Especially the successful hiding spots. 
---
2. Stealth of your own. It's hard to hide from something that you don't know is there. So M+A, meyers, freddy, wraith.
---
3. If all else fails, tracking perks. Spies from the Shadows is surprisingly useful for giving an indication, since a lot of players seem to ignore the crows. 
---
4. The Doctor. His base kit helps with tracking, and he has a series of addons that make him incredibly good at re-finding survivors (the ones that let you see the auras of hallucinations at tier 2).
---
Ghostface is the new survivor
---
f13 ios such a fun party game when i got 8 friends to play
---
Tbh I think rank shouldn’t exist. I feel all players should just be thrown in a general pool.
---
I play him and people dc so i stopped and play him very sparringly.
---
Good; his gas makes me nauseous.
---
Watch out here comes the trapper
---
Your killer gameplay sounds so boring.
---
I just watched a 4 minute video on reddit and I fully loved it
---
Feast for the entity. The 500 kills one
---
GlenOck can be our leader
---
One Grand Dictator of the Pig Mains
---
Easily the killer I face the least
---
It’s meant for someone that’s a beginner. That’s not how I play
---
What brings more joy is getting a 4K. Survivor main btw.
---
Everytime I play him people dc. So I dont anymore.
---
1) Learn how to moonwalk and when to do it. Learn how to play tiles correctly - [video about basic tiles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ)  
---
2) My favourite is killer, but it's hard to get matches with these incredibly long queues ; so I end up playing survivor more.
---
It’s so stupid that killers can actually be punished for being too good. I once get a 4K against some of the stupidest fucking survivors I’ve ever played against, every single one died on first hook, I didn’t even get a pip, like wtf
---
This was fucking epic
---
I wouldn't call that a "basic tip on playing killer" then
---
While I partially agree.
---
I believe it's a fair way to give new players a chance.
---
I can tell the difference between a rank ~5 and some who's ~15.
---
Just from Map knowledge to perk utility. 
---
It allows for the game to be fun for newer players.
---
While keeping the game fun for long time players.
---
It didn’t work so I don’t know what to do now
---
I think there should be a ranked or casual mode. Were casual people just play, to play. And ranked is ranked, there should some incentive to play ranked such as more blood points, or a higher blood point cap.
---
That’s not accurate at all. Many killers just falsely assume any team that plays well together is a 4 man team, it’s pretty much a crutch excuse for any loss. On console it’s less than 6% I believe that are 4 man SWF.
---
.......why not
---
The Clown has a great visual design and is probably the best killer character wise, but his ability is underwhelming both in terms of power and uniqueness.
---
They are calling the update a chapter, but ghost face is just a paragraph itself.
---
Now I want a Warden character in DbD
---
Well if they aren't 4 stacks then they doesn't excuse the fact rank 10-2s are ending up in a rank 15s lobby.
---
Splits the player base. People already complain about wait times, and that will just get worse. Also, what percentage of killers are going to want to play unranked then? My feeling is that it'd be pretty low.
---
Then someone on the survivor side has fucked up badly, or maybe even all of them. Freddy's power forces him to do nothing for a time limit before he can even hit people. Meanwhile they're free to run, continue healing, finishing a generator, etc. Before he can even intervene. I can't count how many times a Freddy has found me and a buddy at the tail end of healing, and when he sleeps us, we just finish the heal and then split up. Meanwhile, he's stuck staring at us and waiting.
---
On top of that, his perks are end game perks. Which rely on the endgame actually existing, and certain conditions to be met. 
---
Meanwhile, the Endgame collapse has forced a meta of actually fucking leaving the trial ASAP. A majority of the games that I play in with Freddy, as soon as the last generator pops, we're fucking gone. No risking bloodwarden, NOED, NOTHING. We're fucking gone.
---
Then they need a counter measure because its not fun to play against a high rank player when you are trying to learn a new killer or just trying to play the game.
---
Legion has normal speed now, it’s much easier now to get a non-FF hit than before. On old, slow Legion sure but with the newer one it is easy to get that FF hit, but the speed boost + fatigue penalty makes it worth healing against him
---
Almost all the reasons not to heal against a Legion were taken away in his rework
---
Gonna get cucked again by the Freddy rework, especially if the rework get released in the same patch as Ghostface... Just a prediction.
---
While it's usually true that if you see someone not near your rank, they are joining with someone that's closer to your rank, it doesn't always mean they are in a four-stack.
---
That’s fair. Red and grey ranks are night/day in terms of strategy and perk loadouts
---
That's a nice name for a company!
---
Thank you :D
---
Thanks, I am so glad my counting was off as I thought I had another 200 kills to go.
---
This explains so much
---
Really dumb theory, but maybe everyone's waiting for the livestream or something?
---
Yeah so if they remove ranks maybe implement some form of behind the scenes sbmm
---
Rank 13 killer lobby with Rank 4 survivor
---
So yall commenters gonna ignore the rank of the shit he went through or yall just got the reading skills of a 3 year old
---
Well DH and BT are excellent. But I wouldn’t run Self Care just bring in a medkit if you need it and get better at chases. 
---
Self care takes you off the generator for a bit which means staying in the game longer and not having stuff get done. 
---
Once you take off Selfcare replace it with Adrenaline for a helping hand. I only accept healing if I’m on my last hook. 
---
Third perk you can pickle whatever but that’s my typical build. With Aftercare because it’s a bit of a help. Also for exhaustion perks you could go with BL which is another amazing perk.
---
Immediately lost all chances of being a rational and intelligent species.
---
Ok, but that's not what I was saying.
---
The game is currently set that if you never ever let the killer see you, to the point that they don't ever bother to hang out near you, you get fuckall for evader even though the reality is you did the *best* at evader.
---
I understand how the points are awarded, I'm saying the way points are awarded is fucking garbage.
---
Congratulations! Getting this was quite the experience for me
---
It just sounds like a way to make a new player count on their 3-gen way too much.
---
You guys must be fun at parties.
---
Take a hit and waste the pallet?
---
While I agree with this.
---
It could cause issues such as longer search times fro ranked matches.
---
Why is Quentin there twice?
---
It was a surprise for me. I thought I was ages away still. Only thing now is I've been told by my friends I need to aim for dark souls 3 platinum... no rest for the wicked.
---
Maybe the rework will change the meme from “Darn” to “Yuss”
---
2- or 3-mans?
---
Or maybe they could just make this game less grind-based to get all the meta perks
---
I've only played against **one** Clown in the entire 170 hours I've been playing DbD. He's incredibly rare.
---
Again there should be a limitation on who you can stack with.
---
No doubt there will be a megathread after it's over, but if I remember, I can list the broad notes here.
---
?
---
Oh look a 14 year old from chapo.
---
Post hog, tankie.
---
Fair point maybe make it so perks are just buyable outright and the bloodweb is only for add ons and offerings
---
they should allow a dead survivor to respawn to make up for the disconnected player. and if a survivor DCs at the start of the game the game should end
---
Surprised to see Gabriel on here.
---
Trust me, it doesn't. My friend can probably 4K with any killer at any rank. HE is a true player in the game, and he laughs off at survivors like they're nothing.
---
"Aw he's trying to loop. Can't loop me." (Even when he's not Nurse he can't be looped for long)
---
"Lol the dumbass has Dead Hard. Annnnnnnnnd down he goes."
---
It's insane how well he plays. I keep telling him to do videos, but he doesn't want his techniques getting out, apparently
---
not bad
---
Thank you. That's really kind of you. :)
---
I agree that it can be frustrating, and things can always be better, but everyone has to deal with the same thing. When I've played killer games, I've ended up matched against rank 20s when I had experience and they were obviously new to the game, so it can suck for the survivor too if they happen to be on the wrong side of things.
---
McCote!!
---
No
---
As many times as the picture of Freddy on the bus will.
---
Hmmmmmmmmmm?
---
Ace is definitely bi
---
I agree. I've noticed that too and actually feel bad when I found they are rank 20.
---
But there's less they can do on that end.
---
Normies? Pleb

It also rewards bonus bp
---
So this is uh weird so far
---
The second one I've never had happen, that only happens if they're already under intoxication. The first one happens due to bad collision detection. Either way the first one is rare enough that I wouldn't consider it a huge problem.
---
The entity must be entertained. Quick wins do not please it.

If killers can get mori's why can't I?
---
As far as I know is called music and having fun...

Ok bye.

I fucking hate Twitch chat, I want to punch them all

-Killer who got DC'd on.

Hahaja

I get that.

Both and We'll Make It and Deliverance, lemme unhook that booty.

That's why I posted. A rank 13 killer vs rank 4 survivor.

Ungrateful fucks

I can neither confirm nor deny this allegation... lol yup I’m in Baltimore

all of you to assume that Jake is str8

&gt;try hards with loopers
---
So you just expect survivors to run in a straight line and let you down them?
---
&gt;ppl will just t bag and think they’re so cool
---
Just don't get offended by tea bagging, they're only doing it cause people will get butt hurt when you do 
---
&gt;Jumped in expecting to play a good horror game tailored for horror fans
---
It's not really a horror game, it has popular horror figures however it wasn't really created to be scary (except in certain instances)
---
I disagree with that immensely.  Casual pool always ends up where the trolls go to fuck with the other side, because it doesn't matter.   I end up playing ranked anyway, and not caring about rank, because I would actually face people my skill level, rather than the top tier players wanting to fuck with people for fun in the casual pool.
---
Mickle was pretty good in Hannibal
---
nobody asked k thanks
---
that pig is obviously really bad, im not sure what youre proud of
---
I mean it's clear they didn't even try, especially when it comes to the DBD logo.
---
That’s some next level end game collapses,  I hope I don’t get hit by that bug.  Hope they get it fixed ASAP too
---
They did though? You can tell? Stop being rude
---
Hold up why are they calling Ghostface a chapter? I thought it was just him.
---
Just make SWF matchmaking use the highest ranked player.   They won't be playing troll with friends when they are guaranteed to be facing red rank killers instead of trying to bully the yellow/greys.
---
Year 4 roadmap: lots of stuff so I'm going to miss some things  
---
4 killers, first one Ghostface
---
2 new maps, 2 maps getting reworked (one of them will be Badham Preschool)
---
Dedicated servers, matchmaking improvements
---
Nintendo Switch and mobile versions of the game coming
---
An Archive section of the game where you can unlock lore and other collectables.
---
Why tf isn't there a stickied thread for the live stream?
---
no clue
---
I hope we can use our PC account to play on the go
---
I approve.
---
Congrats! Now get 100% haha
---
So does this mean Chapter 14 is going to be another licensed Survivor or Killer since there isn't a new map?
---
This is actually a better idea.
---
Honestly, I’ll probably end up playing the mobile version quite a bit. Please don’t hate me.
---
May I ask how did you get your papier mache to be so smooth? :O
---
Huh I had no idea you could grief the killer like that if your team is bad. Thanks for the info
---
I was just checking for one. I’m surprised it’s not there.
---
yup. kiss goodbye to my grades man
---
Mods don't like to prepare for things
---
Nothing unusual here, just WGLF Tier 4; it grants the ability to KOBE fellow survivors onto the hook for infinite farming.
---
Who cares, it’s fun. Go be miserable elsewhere.
---
Seems cool, that library (battlepass) thing seems cool enough, at least its something new
---
Oof again same situation but this time 2 of us were alive and one hooked. We had the guts and made it out alive all three. Feels better than just running.
---
Played for a few days and don't like it? Then leave and don't look back. No one expects this game to be perfect and appealing to everyone.
---
This, I can't comment on, I don't mind SWF teams in my lobbies no matter what are their ranks
---
Thank you. That's very kind :)
---
Good question actually
---
He needs be camp
---
This is all amazing stuff. I'm really looking forward to the archives
---
Great, another platform for Ochido.
---
Pretty sure it's for the memes, but it's a good meme.
---
He fits the stereotype so much!
---
Can't wait to be a p3 nurse main on mobile
---
No u
---
yeah but this time you can make fun of him for being a fucking mobile dbd gamer
---
But Chapter 14 doesn't have a new map either, so?
---
"chapter"
---
I understand the punishment from a lore perspective but in practice it’s just dumb. Imagine playing rainbow and you just had a great game and then the game said “it wasn’t close enough, you’re getting deranked”
---
I was drinking Soda when Ghostface peeked out of the Locker man, it got me good.
---
Party Management...does this mean we can finally play games with our friends and NOT have to reinvite them after every match?!?!?!
---
DbD mobile?!
---
Was just gonna ask for some kind of megathread, hehe. 
---
So to start... I’m way psyched about expanding lore through challenges. Give me more objectives and I am a happy person.
---
RIP Identity V.
---
Im not sure what was so bad about preschool? I mean the basement house is annoying but thats present on quite a few maps, other than that its okay. Hopefully they bring the old lighting back
---
As a Freddy I really hope the don’t make him worse with the rework
---
Mad man ✊🏼
---
Are you sure you're on the same account that you purchased the chapter on? does the chapter page on psn still say it's purchased?
---
On one hand I'd love it to be Haddonfield to balance it, on the other hand I'd love it to be te Purge Temple to get it out of Red Forest and make it it's own true thing.
---
Other games that's have mobile versions seem to be doing well. I probably won't buy it myself but I have faith
---
Yes I’m on the same account
---
You wouldn’t be going back to the hook mid chase
---
That's what I'm wondering. Is a chapter one or three new items and the new map is the new version of an old one?
---
I'm curios to see how they'll work on DC's during a match. It will literally be a gamechanger I think, lets see...
---
And all of a sudden, it all makes sense.
---
I'm very excited for the map reworks. The house picture looks cool
---
Same. The one they showed was catch a survivor in a trap immediately after a vault. So it seems like they should be slightly difficult, but easy enough.
---
Hmmm. Applying new map logic to old maps when you rework them? That doesn't seem smart when all of your old maps are the best ones...lol
---
They should fix their game on *All* their other platforms before making another one.
---
I can't wait to see what the new reworked maps are gonna look like
---
haHAA i hear mobile. i hate 12 btw
---
Yeahhhh didnt think of that.. but this would let the unhooker and hooked person see but then again could just buff breakdown instead with that
---
I really hope that second map rework is Haddonfield. Also what’s the rift/Archive thing?
---
It can fuck itself with a red hot poker, along with anyone who supports that type of monetization system in a pay to play game.
---
This map rework makes me think they’re talking about survivor strong maps like Haddonfield and Coldwin.
---
Grab the rebound and put it back up
---
A lot of hype but not many new details yet...
---
Freddy rework is between ghostface chapter and the next chapter.
---
Sounds like this is gonna be a pretty vague presentation. Not a lot of substance, and while I'm fine with roadmaps I'm gonna tune out and just look at the graphic someone will make later.
---
It's mainly the T street design means you get screwed pretty damn easily out of those open gens if they aren't done first. The issue I've noticed is that Survivors that don't grab them early will die at 3, 2, and 1 gen largely because the map is semiopen and there is very little you can do to hide on some of those and for killers the indoor gens are spread so thin you can't realistically guard them, but all the outside gens are easily guarded.
---
No I don’t expect or care about winning. I’m kinda impressed when ppl can do that but it’s obvious when ppl are doing it to be toxic and taunt you while doing circles around you.... 
---
Also I knew it was multiplayer but it’s still very much horror, or at least it seems like it
---
I missed out on the start of the livestream, what is the rift/archive?
---
Why are they so heavy on moderation for this stream?
---
Chat is even disabled on the youtube livestream entirely.
---
Twitch chat is full of morons and racist fucks
---
Its tied to dedicated servers from my understanding, which is why it will come with dedicated.
---
They can do thousands things: for example: just add (as perk or as standard) that the killer gets (almost) blind if he stands too long next to hook (and he has to go away to undo this effect).
---
then you get caught the first time you get found without an exhaust perk
---
The corn on farm maps need to be reworked
---
Typical BHVR..we are going to talk/present something and then not talk about it.
---
LORE TfuHypers
---
Which makes sense. Just super psyched it might actually be happening!!!!
---
hoping we see some switch gameplay! or they at least announce which killers and survivors are in the base game!
---
Yes they can close the hatch
---
Asexual more like. He reads as someone who is so full of himself and sexually confident because nothing can get to him.
---
This has been leaked for like 2 weeks lmao
---
I hope they fix it some day
---
challenges to get BP/cosmetics/lore
---
Laurie def experimented in college
---
\- The lore challenges are extra cool.
---
\- The band is a little gratuitous, but fuck it, it's a celebration event.
---
\- The chat reminds me of why the internet is a mistake.
---
Is it a certain perk or ability? Or if they find the hatch can they lock it?
---
They should also rework the older, boring maps rather than the newer ones. Badham Preschool isn‘t thaaat bad imo...
---
Leave alone Badham Preschool, they need to rework Haddonfield and Fractured Cowshed.
---
The chat is toxic asf.
---
Agreed, it’s not all that terrible, either as killer or as survivor.
---
Lmao
---
Tier 5; If David takes a hit and goes down after 5 stacks, David gets up and fucking murders the killer. *David King Exclusive Won't Work On Other Survivors*
---
Topped off most of his perks are trash with maybe coulrophobia being good if you run say Nurse's Calling. He is a fun killer to play and fight, but you need Ruin to make him barely functional.
---
The old ones just have genetic pallet towns and t junctions
---
What money am I paying by doing challenges to unlock things? Im assuming another battlepass may be paid but its just skins
---
Whoa, calm down. I didn't know it meant that much to you.
---
And the mods are stuck spamming ENGLISH ONLY PLEASE anytime 1 person out of 100 says something that isn't English haha
---
**Rule 3** - Shaming other players.
---
* No calls to action against another player.
---
To give people new things to do, interesting for those who already unlocked a lot
---
Yes, the Killer can close the Hatch, and it starts End Game Collapse when they do.
---
Yeets the killer into a generator and the ensuing explosion kills them.
---
If they find it they can close it
---
Oh okay thanks
---
Temple of Purgation isn't that bad (only downside is that it might be a little too big). It's definitely better than Yamaoka and Ormond.
---
No perk or ability. Just that if it's open, they can close it. This powers up the exit gates though
---
I honestly just have the YouTube stream on my TV. Chats are always terrible.
---
The redhair guy and the other guy with glasses at his right (I don't know their names) are cute as fuck
---
That does seem to be the case, yeah.
---
Amazing!
---
No, any Killer can do it without requiring anything more than finding the Hatch and pressing Space.
---
I'm satisfied with this road map. There's a twinge of 'well that sucks' seeing we'll only get 2 new maps, but so long as they are fully new unique maps not set pieces put into existing maps I'll be happy with them and the 2 map reworks.
---
I'm happy for ghostface getting into the game but I do hope the other 3 chapters are original killers and include survivors.
---
I used regular newspaper with modge podge, but then I sanded that down a bit with extra fine grit sandpaper when it dried and then did a layer of kleenex tissue and modge podge. ☺
---
Does it? I swear they were still closed for me
---
With the newest update they added the end game collapse.
---
The killer can now close the hatch or even open an exit gate when the hatch is present to start the collapse.
---
The survivors are then timed to escape.
---
Coulrophobia is not bad it is meta/map dependent with more and more killers running M&amp;A it loses value. Smalls maps like Meat Plant or Preschool help the perk out a lot.
---
Obviously I don’t know the specifics of what’s going on but just try and stay strong and positive. Every new day is proof that you overcame yesterday. It takes time and effort but there is always some form of light at the end of the tunnel (the tunnel being living...). Feel free to message me.
---
Mobile is literally the only platform that basically everyone owns. 
---
Imagine being upset that a game is expanding it's playerbase to the most popular platform in the world.
---
I knew about the collapse I didn’t realise they could close the hatch though
---
No thanks honestly deathgarden looks awful
---
not saying they're correct but I believe the logic is forcing a frenzy hit in the next chase and not a real hit
---
Oh yeah that's my meme lol. As long as it's not the exact same it's cool.
---
If the animation was adjusted so the killer could hook from all sides, people would be more accepting of it, but since it’s NOT like that it looks wonky and doesn’t feel right
---
They showed a second. It looks very low quality lol
---
vavuum?
---
* Year 4 is "all about health of game".
---

---
* Friend Requeue - SWF will be able to be maintained game after game.
---
The only buff was to movement speed and even then that doesn't make them a good killer 
---
Legion before and after are still bad and overall it's q nerf personally I rather have old legion so at least they don't get dumpstered whenever they decide to play legion
---
**Hex: Devour Hope**
---
Gameplay still sucks. Pass.
---
I LOST MY SHIT LOL
---
flashlight clicking is the mating call of the P3 Claudette
---
Making me want to edit the icon so that it is now
---
Why are people getting banned for 10 minutes in the chat for writing the name ochido? lol
---
Agreed, so damn fine.
---
Could feng *BE* any more tunneled?
---
Mobile is literally the only platform that basically everyone owns.
---
Imagine thinking that everyone that complains about pallet looping wants survivors to run in a straight line/kill themselves instantly
---
Seeing Claudette as a child is amazing 😂
---
Lore?
---
Just powers the switches. You still have to open them yourself
---
Being able to slow down chases/remove options during chase is great, but it’s really not AMAZING.
---
Upvotes for visibility lol
---
With these announcements to expanding both servers and mobile/switch I hope they add an account sync so I don't have to repurchase everything to play with friends and new people.
---
If it is not in the archives, then it does not exist.
---
I'mma keep it real
---
This band trash
---
Per my response to a previous thread:
---
 
---
**TL:DR** \- "Battle pass" is a buzzword that triggers people into thinking a game is trying to scam them, because they have no clue how the real world works.
---
Displeased over free cosmetics eh? That's new.
---
Could you image Zap Rowsdower as a Survivor?
---
I would swoon.
---
I'm pretty excited for it because I get to play it with my boyfriend. We live together and only have 1 ps4 meanwhile we both have our own smartphones so it would be a cheaper way to play together.
---
I've seen flipbooks with a higher FPS.
---
Eh, the  game was already too much grind with no real payoff in the cosmetic department. So, if they don't screw it up by making it panifuly hard to grind the free stuff then i am more than ok with this.
---
ThIs gAmE iS bEcOmInG FoRtNiTe!!11!!1!!!11!!1111!
---
There’s 0 advantage for buying it.  Actually giving incentive to play the game now, but sure get upset over something that is 100% optional and gives you no advantage
---
I personally don’t like it because you have to pay for the battle pass, to unlock something you have already payed for when you bought the game
---
Yup I save em no matter the cost. Even against NOED. As long as they escape I don't mind getting sacrificed.
---
So uh why are you displeased about free cosmetics exactly?
---
People who hate on battlepass are people who dont know what a battlepass is, no surprise here.
---
Not to mention the fact that most players have bought the game and all dlc. So a game we paid for is asking for us to pay for a battlepass. It makes sense in pure free to play games...
---
People don't like being told they're too soft ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I have no problem with it. You can choose not to buy it and you'll still get rewards from it.
---
I mean Ill assume you’ve bought dlcs..... so isn’t that the same thing?
---
God watching that killer tunnel hardcore already tired me out of DBD for the day and I haven't even played yet
---
Cross play from mobile to what? PC? Do you actually believe that could ever be a thing?
---
??? You get new cosmetics tho??? what did you already pay for?
---
No new features? Archives, battle-pass, reworks, and 4 new killers?
---
Have they talked about Carl yet?
---
That makes sense.   
---
It would be extra nice if players could even just pay for individual pieces in the store, even if it's got a bit of a premium versus the pass system. Like, I'm a Feng main, and honestly don't have much interest in most other skins, but if I see a Feng skin, I love, I will give them my money if given the chance.
---
Cross Platform is needed but they don't seem to see it. Player count is falling, wait times increasing, PC has too many killers, console has too many survivors.
---
I have a friend who’s similarly extremely good at survivor, and it honestly wouldn’t surprise me if your friend and mine knew each other if he’s actually that good. My boys unironically one of the best survivors I’ve seen, and can even run players like Scott around a strong map.
---
Does it? It sounds like a lot of matches are going to be people just trying to complete whatever Archive goal they need next.
---
"New Way to Play" means "Farm Goals" in DBD instead of just making a NEW mode.
---
Chapters without maps is really weird.
---
Well, you don't have to pay. There's a free track, that's the point.
---
If they never charged for dlc or cosmetics the game would just be left at launch
---
wait, this will be b2p? if yes, they will fail miserably in Asia market
---
I was typing this out as I was watching. Archives is lore, Rift is “battle pass” but yes exciting nonetheless.
---
What did you say?
---
5 nights at Fortnite..don';t agree with you but that one was pretty good
---
Same, friend. The mods are on full nazi mode.
---
Yeah, all that &lt;message deleted&gt; for stuff that TOTALLY deserves it is so triggering we should just hang out here and circle jerk about it.
---
and youre paying more for more extra content in the game like any other cosmeticv
---
It's almost worrisome because if they bite off more than they can chew that'll suck
---
Exactly why this happens. I won't facecamp but I will tunnel a motherfucker that tilts me.
---
The toxicity is just unreal man. Watch the chat mock about the native game designer speaking a foreign language. This is just rude and not respectful from them.
---
DLCs are different. That is like a big expansion to the game. I don’t like battle passes because if you look at Fornite( the best example of a battle pass), the game is free to play, while this one is not.
---
Is Zekeo going to get a community spotlight video package?
---
Oh I didn’t see that. My bad
---
As long as the price isn’t obnoxious since it’s every 3 months I’m fine with it. Especially if the cosmetics look good
---
I mean, still purely cosmetic. I'll be back to talk after FREDDY REWORK IS DONE.
---
"Do you guys not have phones?"
---
I'm a Freddy main. And not the tunnelling Freddy main. The "being the map" Freddy kind. A perk like that would really annoy me because clearly knowing when the survivor is off the hook could impact how I control the map. If I don't catch a glimpse of the unhook at the bottom I could lose key map control because of a heal or extra gen pressure that I didn't know about.
---
It looks pretty cool. Only cosmetics, so I have no complaints.
---
I like it, I wanted a battle pass, if it's done well like Fortnite and not like APEX it will be a good addition to the progression system
---
I find it to be fine, If you don't want to buy it  you still get cosmetic items on the free track, I love that. The only like that is bothering me( and it is reaching) is I think the rank incentives should go live first. The battle pass is honestly not a problem.
---
Archive appears to be a hybrid between a questing system and a place for them to release content like concept art, short films, and cosmetics. They're adding a sort of quest system that lets you unlock things through completion of objectives, specifically things like character and game story, charms for bragging rights, etc
---
"Fuck off, no one wants a battle pass"
---
Badham is also pretty bad, especially the houses with the underground floor and pallet near the double stairs.
---
And totem placements on that map are also pretty lame.
---
&gt;they need to rework Haddonfield and Fractured Cowshed
---
I agree 100% tho (also Thompson's house)
---
Ok, but I want to be able to unlock things without paying. Kind of like the old halo games, and how you did challenges to unlock cosmetics
---
Why not? It gives you more of a reason to grind the game, and probably get £150 worth of cosmetics for £10 or £20. Also, you don't have to buy it.
---
Nah we need Brenda
---
If anyones toxic it's definitely you
---
Just don't buy the pass then damn.
---
in honor of the 3 yr. anniversary..old meme: "pretty good job so far.."
---
I mean, I work at Costco and we have hundreds and hundreds of pallets around. Almost all stacked out back, but some around.
---
Definitely wouldn’t call the amount of pallets suspicious for the location.
---
Exactly.
---
I don't see how implementing a Battle Pass is bad for the game. It's offers rewards and even more replayability.
---
I'm ok with licenced DLC's being paid since they need to pay for the licence. The other characters can just be earned trough normal gameplay. And if you're gonna pay for something, I prefer it to be permanent. But it sounds like you'll need to pay every season for this pass
---
People purchasing battle passes affects you in **ZERO** ways. 
---
"make the rest of the game industry worse for everyone"
---
Oh please. Get off your fucking high horse.
---
Thank you!
---
They explicitly said there's no pay to win element to the archive.
---
Rule 1: No ugly people allowed
---
its a live service game. they have to pay their employees to keep making this content.
---
There's not enough people to split modes up.
---
Update: I’ve fixed the problem
---
People are getting banned for asking for that Bunny Feng.
---
Because Ochido is a well known creator for being incredibly toxic, being banned many times, and just fitting the toxic dbd player stereotype.
---
Am I the only one who really does not care about ghostface even the slightest amount?
---
It's like i'm back in nazi germany
---
Those are the old dailies, I believe.
---
Anyone else hyped for 540p and less content.
---
IDK, maybe teleport or shapeshift. His perks would definitely be centered around grief, as in, for every survivor that gets injured/killed the others would get debuffs.
---
Yeah but only 2 Halloween movies actually take place on Halloween. The first one and the newest one
---
They weren't mocking her they were mocking the mods who were aggressively deleting any non-English message and saying ENGLISH ONLY or ENGLISH ONLY PLEASE
---
The mods remind me of nazi germany
---
Now if you look through the comments you will see a vast sea of egotistical little survivor shits ranting. Beware for they will call upon their hatred and moms credit cards to create a tsunami that will wipe away all the people that get mad at a game as they are imperfect and do not fit the perfection that is a self entitled survivor main.
---
I don't understand the hate for it, it just went through a massive rework and is pretty fun now. Well, at least that's what I think about it. (Not gonna lie, I got it mainly because of the DBD cosmetics although I'm having fun with it).
---
No Reich like the Third Reich.
---
Snap snap clap clap
---
Well I mean Twitch chat is full of idiots so
---
Yes I understand that. I only think there should be a free way to unlock things in the game because you already payed for it. For example, they can keep the payed battle pass, but there could be like a system(the shards for example, or a set of challenges), where you can choose to unlock one skin in the battle pass for free, without having to pay for it. That way there is still an incentive to buy the battle pass to unlock everything, but also keep players who don’t want to pay for the battle pass something to work for.
---
PS Vita is a thing
---
... Really? Welcome to the THIRD "cleanse"-type killer I guess.
---
Never said anything about splitting the playerbase. Make the modes random.
---
That's just another way of saying it but sure
---
what did he do?
---
Duh.
---
Legion was fucking garbage without op add ons. You could cheese the chase, but even that was bad. Now Legion is just always garbage. Also pipping isn't winning.
---
Nah, calling it "trolling" is giving it too much credit. If you consider saying "ggez" trolling then you have a very loose definition of it. As far as I'm concerned, something has to be clever and actually fool people to be trolling.
---
At best, saying "ggez" is just baiting, because either you really are toxic, or you're just baiting a reaction out of someone. In any case, this really has nothing to do with people being too "soft." I don't know why people seem to say this so frequently. I think people are just sick of the low-effort "trash" talk present in gaming communities these days. "ggez" is not even good "trash talk" or banter, it just makes you look like a smarmy git.
---
Pay to play
---
wow its almost like the game has dailies that does the same thing...its almost like this is in the game in a small amount and you're mad about them giving people more to do/work towards huh

Can we get this as a Dwight skin?
---
If you don't pay you still get rewards.
---
How do you which one is what?
---
Yes. Or the console versions are nice too (unless you're red rank).
---
Yea I take it back.
---
Dude the graphics look pretty much the same on all platforms, PC Included. The only difference is frame rate. They have no real graphics scaling in this game.
---
Legion gets an easy hit then gets to stun,stun himself for 4 seconds. It's pretty close to Freddy who has to wait 7 seconds (or shorter with add ons) to hit someone. And without any of the upsides of Freddy's power.
---
“Chapter”
---
Yeah someone pointed that out. So now I look like a jackass lol
---
Freddy went from one ability to 42 abilities
---
Um.......this freddy gen power.....
---
What's the battlepass specifics for people at work?
---
the battle pass doesnt effect the game play at all lmao, stop being a whiny child
---
You failed to prevent any argument but a circlejerk, they’re cosmetics, not weapons, not killers, C o s m e t i c s,  
---
Paying ten bucks to get a bunch of cosmetics doesn’t hurt anyone and helps the Devs, So funny how people get worked up over cosmetics and not companies like CDPR or rockstar treating their employees like dogshit forcing them to “Crunch Hours” among many shitty things that deserve actual outrage
---
No, it seems way out of your niche. That’s like saying doom, Skyrim, and a bunch of other shit shouldn’t be on the switch or isn’t Nintendo’s “niche.”
---
Tydetime, Monto, Noob3, few others that are great fun to watch and learn.
---
People are getting banned for asking about Bunny Feng and saying the Battle Pass sucks...
---
Dont buy it then
---
You're amazing
---
The one with tools sticking out has bonuses for sabo.
---
That just gets silly. Either way you could load into something you don't want to do. May even encourage people to D/C because they load into a mode they don't want to do.
---
Yeah I'm not annoyed about it at all, they're good ways to help the game and devs out and DBD is the only multiplayer game that's managed to hold my attention since I've been playing it, and I've gone through Apex, Fortnite, F13 etc since then. I'll probably buy it. Just poking fun at the people who said they didn't want it haha.
---
YESSSSSS MY LAD
---
Watch OhTofu’s guides for basic survival and tips
---
If you know what killer you want to use then search for guides on youtube
---
Use this site for perk knowledge: https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/
---
Exactly what I’m thinking. He has to have the most abilities out of all the killers now?
---
Damn dude I remember those pretty well! I feel like I was like 10 or something when I had that. My brothers had a skeleton one and a Jason one
---
Freddy map pressure. Move aside nurse and Billy, a 3rd top tier incoming
---
So what you’re saying is for a killer to always lurk in an area where 1 survivor was cause odds are there are multiple, and always double back to the gen 5 seconds into a chase. Also camp hard. Interestingly enough, this is whats seen as cheesy and toxic for a killer to do, but is obviously what they should do.
---
Sounds like the other killers teamed up to teach him some of their own powers
---
Omfg
---
They made literally every single aspect of their power worse. 115 movespeed is basically worthless.
---
Freddy sounds amazing so far.
---
I'm just waiting for people to claim it's OP before they even get to try it.
---
Freddy is a swiss army knife now.
---
GEN TELEPORT
---
FREDDY IS YOUR NEW GOD
---
I’m so hype for this shit :’)
---
A great improvement
---
How about the comments that just said ‘Ching Chong’ over and over again when the Asian designer was speaking?
---
Give us Bunny Feng or give us death!
---
Now someone tells me! I was just using it cause I needed to prestige and I needed to use all the items I had.
---
if you want to you can research but he was incredibly toxic, even by dbd standards: camping, tunneling, body blocking survivors to trap them, and being toxic in post game chat. He has made multiple accounts after getting banned to this day. And Irl he has been known to have sexually harassed female fans of them and pretty much being a creep.
---
Im skeptical
---
Just some notes, ppl passive falls asleep
---
Can place fake pallets in the dream world 
---
Can slow ppl
---
Can teleport to gens
---
Wtf lol
---
Community: Freddy needs a buff.
---
BHVR: Here's 100 more abilities, leave us alone.
---
And people were worried he would be worse thats funny. 
---
If his power was just gen teleporting it would be really good.
---
Palettes are cool, snares sound a little uninspired.
---
If there's an addon that removes the gen teleport notification there's going to be his own prayer beads.  Love it.
---
Bruh Freddy is gonna be strong as fuck. Teleport to fucking gens why
---
Yeah im betting that as well.
---
Haha, I'm one of those people that didn't want a battlepass initially. But those cinematics and journal entries convinced me. I'm a sucker for lore.
---
I'm excited for it.
---
It would be 2.  They said they would do either fake pallets or the snares and the gen teleport.
---
He can't disable the generators, just teleport to them. Survivors get a 5 second warning that he's coming when he does it because the Generator spits out blood.
---
Just give him 100 abilities one of them has to be good.
---
he won't be god tier but he sure as shit will be good
---
As a former doctor main I am estatic. Nothing gets the dopamine flowing like DC's popping off like generators on a Dr. Worldwide build on The Game.
---
That’s not just “commenting on battle pass”
---
Try expressing your opinion like an adult next time
---
I use: Ruin, BBQ, M&amp;A, Nurses 
---
Other great perks are: MYC, Surveillance, Discordance, Whispers, SloppyButcher...
---
Good thing they're doing something about DC's.
---
I'm a bit disappointing that they're essentially just lending him powers we've seen already, basically emulating Hag/Clown and Spirit.   
---
That being said, I reserve judgment til I try it and I remain optimistic.
---
DC wont matter when Dedicated Servers go live and you risk getting banned for doing it. BTW..when I say mode I'm not talking about Deathmatch or something that doesnt fit DBD...im talking about doing something other than repairing 5 generators and opening a door. 3 years in and that shit is fucking boring.
---
Hey - this question has been asked like 3 times this week. Here's one of the earlier topics:  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bujrk4/spirit\_mains\_advanced\_tipstricks\_to\_improve\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bujrk4/spirit_mains_advanced_tipstricks_to_improve_with/)
---
To me it sounds powerful because of the focus on Freddy rather than his counterplay, maybe his various abilities will work into augmentation add-ons like the Doctor’s pallet and illusion add-ons.
---
They did say it isnt complety finished yet so we dont know for sure if thats how its gonna be. 
---
It might have a cooldown and it only affects if you your alseep.
---
Freddy sounds fucking top tier with the rework. He basically stops genrushing and he slow people. Good thing I'm prestiging my Freddy so he'll be set once the rework comes out
---
Freddy is getting a wild history in DbD. Hella nerfed beyond belief.
---
Hella buffed beyond belief. 
---
Wild.
---
The gen tp might be his weakest power tbh. Think about it. The range is probably bad, and then you see the blood gushing out before he even teleports so any smart player can quickly gtfo
---
Cost?
---
It's enough to get reactions from people, most of whom go off the rails ranting about it. Trolling doesn't have to be good trash talk. Toxic would be flat out saying you suck. Ggez is sarcastic. Take it with a grain of salt, not a whole mountain
---
They're still trying to decide between snares, pallets, or both.
---
Hex thrill of the hunt is great paired up with another hex of your choice, either ruin or lullaby or haunted grounds or whatever you like. Her map presence is awesome, she can just zoom to the totem and yoink em off of the hex. Thanatophobia is really good too. I also recommend rancor, bloodhound, surveillance, and bbq.
---
I love the idea of cross platform, however, there is a huge disadvantage for console players against mouse and keyboard. Not dissing the console players, but there is more maneuverability and even macros available on m&amp;k that are not available on controller.
---
he doesnt know how game design works in the slightest and just wants something to complain about lol
---
I was able to open the gate while in this state but nothing else xD
---
1 down payment for a seasons worth of rewards? Sounds like a bunch of fucking bullshit to me. I’m personally a fan of crates and pseudo-gambling with in game currency. /s
---
No body can teleport to gens though.
---
no need to give this douche more attention. won't google him. thanks for explaining.
---
Aww it's a baby Wraith, so adorable! &lt;3
---
Literally. People act like this isn't an option lmao
---
You’ve never been to Cosco, Winco, Home Depot, Wilco, costals if you haven’t seen pallets lying all over the place
---
I don't care if it's pay to one, what angers me is that it is probably not a 1 time purchase
---
Yup, might be add ons, but either way, insane if he can do all. Feels like an overloaded kit haha
---
Running Discordance with Freddy will be great though.  Imagine an addon too that removes the notification.  Wew lad.
---
Honestly, I really like his rework as a survivor main, I love the alarm clock addition I don't need to alert him where I am but I also don't have to rely on players in the game when I am solo. It works for me.
---
A pedophile is someone who gets sexual arousal from *prepubescent* kids. Prepubescent is any kid who hasn’t gone through puberty yet. So yeah preying on teenagers is fucked up blah blah blah not pedophilia though.
---
Can I learn this power?
---
Survivors already DC against any killer, it really doesn't matter.

But how can they re-sell you all that shit if they let it transfer?

if you go to the Dead By Daylight merch website (just look it up) you can get a pillow with any of the killers or survivors perks on it. it only comes with one perk per pillow but you can get any perk from any survivor or killer. hope this helps!
---
The ban was justified then.
---
He went from a snore, to holy fuck uhhh can we pump the breaks.
---
Discordance always was great on Freddy.
---
Thanks all!
---
pillowphile
---
He deserves it, he's suffered for over a year and been the ass of so many memes
---
why do you say "might" ? they already confirmed it
---
Bloodlusted to death feels good man
---
I don’t get why, is he the “he who must not be named” around here
---
One of the most popular competitors of DBD is a mobile game.
---
PUBG mobile is one of the most popular methods of playing it.
---
Just because it plays better on PC/Console doesn't magically make the audience that would play mobile disappear.
---
How is looping toxic
---
Did you not just watch the dev stream?
---
They're literally killing pallet looping and with bloodlust still existing it will be impossible not to 4k every single game

You can have any killer perk!

I mean I thought the same about Rainbow 6 Siege on consoles vs PC but hey console still has an audience
---
I wrote it before they confirmed/talked about it
---
I am watching it right now and I have come to the conclusion that you're just stupid
---
What's your point? Do you get upset every time they release a new cosmetic because now they are "forcing" you to pay money to get the cosmetic? They are cosmetics my dude don't fucking spend any money and you STILL get more cosmetics than you did before.
---
*message deleted by a moderator*
---
Not all of these messages are delete worthy. These mods are even removing normal messages too. Sort of a power trip to be honest...
---
There's going to be a mobile version?
---
/u/garadon has a great live synopsis [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bvbhwc/year_3_livestream_live_now/epnoron/).
---
mobile will be b2p? if is, sorry, but this game will be fail on asia and latam market, so it seems NetEase will thanks for the free marketing for Identity V
---
As long as I can get everything without having to pay anything, It's okay to me. I can have some direction on what to do finally
---
don’t act like survivors were super weak, please
---
I wasn't commenting on those. I was replying to a comment about the English only spam. Those were racist and should have been deleted. The comment I was replying to was taking the English only spam out of context.
---
WTF. Nobody commenting on the 96k Match Blood Points? BBQ, and Survivor Pudding? Well done.
---
that is so true that it hurts
---
Evade implies more being in danger and escaping. Avoid would be more what you're talking about.
---
I see waht you're saying but I also understand what the scoring system was going for.
---
Lol the YouTube stream doesn't even have chat.
---
Remove bloodlust and Spirit Fury? Man survivor mains are on drugs today hahaha.
---
PARKOUR
---
"omg their idea that isn't even final yet and will be in the PTB before a release is so OP!"
---
Nah for real though these Freddy changes sound fantastic! I'm curious if hes keeping his aura reading or action speed reduction? Maybe I missed it, but I didn't catch them saying anything about that. 
---
I'm hyped to try out the fake pallets and gen teleporting whenever he hits PTB as well as trying to play against it.
---
10 minutes slowmode btw. Great idea
---
What you are going to see is the same thing you see during the seasonal events..people standing around trying to complete the "challenges".
---
Its also laughable to think BHVR considers more than one possibility for anything they do. How many of these streams is them saying "our players figured out how to do x".
---
&gt;killing pallet looping
---
I mean, they're actually making the distribution of loops better, so there are less powerful ones but more overall.
---
This is a killer main sub. They want us to just loop once and let them hit us.
---
Not necessarily but sometimes it is part of toxic gameplay :)
---
yes, delete a perk.... and a teachable perk at that
---
They are talking about maps right now. It looks like they will be refreshing map layouts constantly. Or something like that.
---
That's your experience, but people are different. And for some fun can turn into something really twisted, still allowed by game rules and mechanic. Can you blame them? For being heartless, maybe. But, that is another point of fun - self-serving one.
---
me_irl
---
Yeah your right, I’m just gonna stop dropping pallets cause that’s way to toxic
---
How does this make sense when you just said you bought all the DLC?
---
I’m quite hyped for this tbh
---
I bet you complain when you get blinded and a power dropped on you
---
Is this what was said on the Livestream?
---
Yes! Fuck free cosmetics! People already pay for cosmetics, so I don't see any reason to hate paid Battle passes. Doesn't affect the game in any form of way.
---
I'm not saying it's wrong to be annoyed and I also didn't post paragraphs ಠ~ಠ
---
&gt; Please read the following points carefully and be aware that subreddit moderators are fan volunteers. **No compensation is provided.**
---
Nobody is paid for being a moderator on /r/deadbydaylight.
---
I hope they keep the pallet thing as base kit. Having fake pallets that gush with blood when thrown down sounds amazing.
---
Thanks, I wasn't paying attention and missed this part. One thing you've missed, it sounded like they were swapping his terror radius and lullaby; so the lullaby is heard while asleep
---
Killers lose bloodlust when they break a pallet. There will be more pallets, which means it will be harder for killers to get bloodlust, assuming you have any skill besides running in a circle.
---
Nobody asked you to be a cunt either but here we are
---
Love it so much! Freddy mains, we shall rise!
---
This summarizes a lot of my matches not just in DBD, but in a lot of games.
---
It's not that looping is inherently toxic, it's that generally, toxic survivors always infinite loop without employing other strategies.
---
you seem to be too understand the Change.
---
Here come the crybaby survivors who whine about a killer sided game despite getting second chance perks every ten seconds
---
Don't even think about it
---
We literally were just top 5 on Steam.
---
There's enough people to play the game to add new modes. If we need to go F2P in order to facilitate that, then it needs to happen. DBD has enough payed DLC to keep the devs fed.
---
Okay, but with there being more unsafe loops around WHY does bloodlust need to continue existing?
---
It's been long overdue for it to be removed and this change is the final nail in the coffin that it's bloodlusts time to GO.
---
I came to Reddit to find out why his name was being removed. Something a out Puppers too?
---
It's so much fun because it punishes killers who are prioritizing kill efficiency over chases.  You wanna go for my injured friend?  BILL OVERBECK SAYS FUCK YOU
---
A lot of killers are really fragile x)
---
Can't wait to see them nerf him into the ground a week after
---
It really isn’t, unless you butt dance after dropping a pallet
---
If they remove long loops then better remove bloodlust.
---
Killers don't have to break unsafe pallet though. 
---
If you break unsafe pallets as killer you're just wasting your own time.
---
You mean Dr. Hag Billy
---
What do you mean? That's essentially like me buying a full price 60 game (let's say, monster Hunter world) and then then adding a battlepass that I need to pay for. When I've already paid full price for the game. It just doesn't make sense. Battlepasses just make sense for free to play games since it's their main revenue. A buy to play game with a battle pass is just trying to double dip and it doesn't seem right to me.
---
&gt;This is a killer main sub.
---
Really? I feel like a poll should be done. Judging by the general opinions I usually see upvoted, I felt like this sub is mostly survivor mains.
---
I’m a survivor main, but people are delusional if they think this game is actually killer sided.
---
You know he had to a pretty good job with them, so far.
---
We don't fully know the extent of these changes yet. Against slower killers, strong enough loops may still exist that chases waste far too much time without bloodlust
---
One. Two. Freddy's Coming for you
---
Three. Four. He will be mocked no more.
---
Five. Six. Gens won't be fixed.
---
Seven. Eight. That pallets fake.
---
Nine. Ten. Freddy's back again.
---
The devs gave you bloodlust because you can’t handle loops and yet survivors are toxic. Make it make sense.
---
Same. 
---
It sounds good right now aside from a couple things (not gonna lie, I'm very sad to see the reduced action speed go and a bit worried he'll turn into a more limited combination of Hag/Doctor/Nurse), but I'm reserving judgement until he actually comes out.
---
Imo it’s  a buff. 
---
More pallets&gt;strong loops
---
There's a ghostface in it
---
And dream snare or fake pallets are going to be addon only
---
No one knows its far away. They won't even be here the chapter after Ghost
---
If they remove infinites better remove bloodlust too.
---
Me either, now I'm curious
---
That dev who looks like Dwight is gonna Head On the guitarist at the end
---
Fuck off their talking about removing the worst cowshack loops etc in favour of more space for normal loops.
---
A killer cannot catch a survivor who abuses that shit
---
You never just have fun with something you love?
---
Excuse me I gotta go to that clock dresser because I think I'm in the dream realm rn.
---
Why would you use a macro ? For real i can't see a reason.  
---
For struggle phase i use mouse wheel .
---
Another thing to use micro for ? Spamming flashlight
---
LMFAO
---
I mean just rework it to do something entirely different
---
The true identity of Ghostface confirmed!
---
Still exploitative monetization scheme.
---
PAY for game.
---
PAY for DLC.
---
PAY for Cosmetics.
---
Now PAY for limited time window to GRIND for cosmetics.
---
PAY PAY PAY MORE IN DBD.  Gotta subsidize Deathgarden somehow.
---
Sounds fun as hell tbh
---
When Squirrel came up (an asian streamer), the entire chat started going "Ayaya!", "Hentai!", and "Waifu". Chat needs to be moderated as shit.
---
This is too good
---
IT IS TIME *teleports to generator*
---
It’s really not. The survivor mains are actually a pretty quiet voice compared to the killer mains in this sub. I’m dead serious. And a poll would do nothing as I could be a killer main and easily say I’m a survivor main to skew the results.
---
Oh boy, are you high? They literally just announced it we have no idea how this will even work out and you’re already calling for a main function of the game and a teachable perk to be removed?
---
Seriously. He's looking stunning
---
Yeah, statistically in an asymmetrical 1v4 game, neutral forums will always be more so populated by the 4 rather than the 1. For example, I'll more than likely get downvoted to hell and "muh killer sub" will receive 10x gold and get modded.
---
Yep; but they only gave a few snippets. I think they said they were going into more detail later on.
---
Good catch.
---
Yeah, fair points. Just getting across I don't agree that people are necessarily always soft or salty over ggez, and that this was just a dumb meme. I thought you were looking too far into it. :)
---
Anyway, there doesn't seem to be much else left to say, so have yourself a nice day.
---
Eh, feel free to post them whenever, though the community has eyes on some other shit right now. Liking the style though :D
---
Did they say speed reduction? I guess i must of missed it if they did?
---
so we're getting dream pallets (fake ones), dream snares (slow you down) and teleporting to gens, as well as alarm clocks.
---
\*Uses key to leave the random on hook and escape\*  
---
Lol, ez
---
Would y'all mind if I [deleted]
---
Honestly, Freddy with either Discordance or Surveillance is going to be scary.
---
Especially if there's an add-on that gives less of a warning that he's coming.
---
Ah ok
---
Dev 1: How do we buff Freddy?
---
Dev 2: Just give him a dozen abilities, at least one of them will make him competitive 
---
Dev 1: Sounds good enough to me :)
---
Twitch chat must be entertained, quick wins do not please it.
---
A bright map would be dope though
---
I just spent upwards to half an hour arguing with some stranger on Reddit on a Thursday night. So yeah, I’m pretty much the life of em
---
Bloodlust isn't a "main function" of the game.
---
It was added in 2017 (about a year or so after the games release) as a band aid fix against infinites.
---
 Infinites no longer exist and therefore bloodlust should not exist either.
---
Exactly, still the blood noti makes it weaker but yeah range is a huge factor. I’m so fucking hyped waiter way
---
Yeah I'm on-board with that too. Don't buy the pass and, if you genuinely feel passes are toxic and should be stopped, make posts about it! After all, the DBD Battle Pass could completely flop if you convinced enough people on the subreddit and other places where you can talk with them directly, that it's "bad".
---
Obviously TKSaint the above "you"s aren't aimed at you. But I have not, do not, and will not understood/understand the mindset of people acting like it's just on BHVR and like there's nothing they can do. If the Battle Pass is really a toxic/"awful" thing, then surely anyone who supports it is worthy of criticism too? After all, BHVR wouldn't keep pushing an idea that was LOSING them money, would they? What business seriously does that?
---
Yeah, if your teammates were doing their job, that means gates are nearly open (already powered?). Which means the game is basically over. Why not get your 1K at that point to go with the depip?  You played a good game, even if you didn’t escape.
---
It’s the survivors who hump a BS window or building all game and teabag in the exit like they actually did something
---
Are you talking about the live stream? watching it right now!
---
Let's copy other killers again and make him a doctor/trapper/nurse knockoff, that will be ridiculously op until they nerf him a few weeks after release. What could go wrong?
---
Did you seriously just try to repost the most upvoted post on this subreddit as your own content?
---
New survivors as killers mode confirmed
---
Isn't she just a glorified message board moderator?
---
I don't think she has any input on design and changes.
---
It's called a cloche! They're usually used to house plants. This is far from a reference to hellraiser.
---
Same mate. Latching on the littlest things to live through.
---
like what? what are the changes to looping anyway can't watch the stream
---
The fact that people think it's a killer sub is probably a tell that survivor players are more common because of the us vs them mentality that these asymmetrical games tend to have.
---
It was literally just a free weekend. That's why numbers were so high. Currently it's sitting at #22 on Steam. Not bad, but with only 20k people that's not great. It's more than sustainable but people are complaining about long wait times on PC. How do you think another mode would help that out?
---
good find
---
It has a strange place here as a plant holder don’t you think?
---
Why do your perks look so cool?
---
I wish we could buy it with shards give more uses for shards :/
---
Freddy traps seem like TA traps from DOTA but without damage, depending on how strong the slow is that's a pretty powerful ability
---
*chases the same survivor for 3 min*
---
Why are all the gens being done ???? SMH genrushers
---
I'm a little sad the slow action speed is being removed. I loved Freddy's built in stall. Maybe I'm kinda shit but I loved how I can slow the game down so I can get more time to get kills and such. 
---
Also now sabo skillchecks wake you up, + there's an alarm clock you can find which wakes you up, so no more "Endgames" by sleeping all four survivors so nobody can wake eachother up. Kinda bummed about the easier wakeups.
---
Imagine going against a baby Claudette and getting called a baby killer in chat
---
Console and pc are a lot closer than mobile lol
---
"BuT iT's JUsT pReSinG CtRL, y U sO MAd?" Seriously, I have a hard time finding swfs that I can enjoy playing with, because most people I find (especially the DBD Discord) are assholes.
---
This sounds awesome.
---
With more pallets closer together, if you don't break an 'unsafe pallet' you will have a survivor looping you between two 'unsafe' pallet spots for a long ass time. Especially with exhaustion perks, other survivors taking hits, insta heals, and of course MoM. All you're seeing is 'smaller loops' and not the big picture - More pallets, likely close to vaults, making them their own infinites if you don't break a pallet.
---
&gt; It was literally just a free weekend. 
---
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO GO FREE TO PLAY.
---
Thank you x
---
GOD that rework sounds DELICIOUS
---
Then I Kobe off the hook, EZ game
---
It’s refreshing to see a survivor main who realizes this. You’re one of the good ones.
---
Wow thanks for doing this! I can’t watch the stream rn so it’s great to hear what Freddy’s change is. This sounds great!
---
Do you know that one useless pallet in the downstairs of the plague's map? I have a feeling most new pallets will be just like that one.
---
Yeah, may as well just delete all the killers...  
---
Seriously, if you want an easy game, then just play minecraft
---
Twitch mods are so terrible
---
There may be more? I remember them asking Dark Hood for permission to share 'Perks 101: Leader' so that might still be coming
---
That switch gameplay.....#ConsoleOptimization
---
Ghostface is in at least.
---
New killer - Baby Claudette
---
She has nothing to do with the development of the game.
---
Lots of people were missing, it seems, but I missed Panda as well.   
---
Smiled as soon as I heard Ohm though. (:
---
We have been pushed down for too long! FREDDY MAINS WILL NOW MAKE YOU PAY.
---
I hope they talk about ghostface.
---
I want to see Nea as a kid , please have ghostface style scenes that would be mind blowing
---
Oh gosh, Baby Claudette will crouch around even more. IMMERSION TO THE MAX. :P
---
[Is this just a meme?](https://imgur.com/a/GA25MEp). Friend and i watching genuinely can't tell. I find it hard to believe Plague is someone's FAVOURITE killer to play against.
---
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS
---
I HAVE 41 PARTY STREAMERS THAT HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR Y E A R S
---
If they make their snares base he will be amazing. Able to shut down a loop by placeing it. Otherwise he will be mediocre at high ranks as SWF can communicate what pallets are broken and probebly trapped.
---
Then they want to say that we just run them around for minutes on end without employing other tactics...as if they don’t have the ability / objective to chase other survivors.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/comments/bkmjo2/muxs_retro_pack/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
....I will actually cry if that’s the case. That kind of shit pallet would only connect if the killer actually stood there for you politely.
---
I think someone pissed in the moderators cereal.
---
Freddy will actually have map pressure with the gen teleporting and survivor traps... Wow
---
Same, I didn’t know any of the others and I heard his voice and was happy I knew someone
---
The size of the killers foot
---
Yea I’m anxious to see whether it benefits or hurts the survivors, but it will definitely be an interesting change
---
imagine doing a 10 minute slow mode and deleting harmless comments-
---
So YOU're the Claudette crouching in the corner while I'm hooked and the killer is chasing someone else!
---
Discordance or Surveillance is now core on Freddy. Immediately know when a Survivor touches a gen, teleport to either that one or one nearby.
---
It's going to be scary.
---
wheres Monto or Noob3? 
---
Never heard of that Girl sitting there
---
Y'all actually thinking this dude is on the verge of suicide lol. Its just a post my dudes
---
Heh, the scoring system was going for keeping their pet ideas around rather than reevaluating if they should keep them in the first place.
---
Pay to get the infinite loading
---
It really depends how safe the pallets are. If the pallets are super killer sided it doesn't matter how many of them there are on the map.
---
Nice format ty OP!
---
Killer main, but play survivor on and off.
---
Wow I’m so looking foreword to more lore in this game, there’s so many questions and so few answers
---
I never even considered this, but now I want it.
---
F2P doesn't just make games magically blow up in numbers forever. A lot of people try it for a bit and then move on. This exact scenario happened to Evolve when it became F2P. It got bigger numbers than it ever had. 
---
Want to know what it's at right now?!35 people playing.
---
But hes just getting buffs
---
I don’t know about monto but isn’t Noob3 not very liked by the devs because of how he was banned twice and his fans gave the game negative views
---
Seriously have you seen the switch version? They have a lot of work to do , mobile would be hard af
---
Dooki! Pick up the phone!
---
Freddy's getting buffed?
---
How tf do you rework looping
---
lmao what
---
Until someone tells us why he brought up that girl in the first place!
---
He's better for the game's health, and he can down people a lot faster now provided you're decent at killer. I dunno how it's possible to view it as anything but a straight buff.
---
Nah, there's not 3 birds on top
---
Lmao you have no idea what you are talking about
---
Can anyone tell me what the rework is, exactly? I don’t really feel like watching the stream
---
Balanced landing? *Shrug*
---
I'm only upset about the removal of his built in stalling and being able to wake up with the alarm clock and now sabo checks waking you up.  
---
Can you explain what you don't like about the changes? I honestly don't mind the removal of his stall if it gives me more power and "control" of the dream world. The only other thing I'm upset about is the removal of his invisibility.
---
I love this comment
---
but they have already confirmed the mobile version, it will be difficult because the main version is a shit in optimization.
---
"battle pass DansGame"
---
They are removeing his dream transition mindgames and his ability to down by doing them on a survivor who has just waken up. As a freddy player this sadens me. However they are makeing him more overal a better killer with map pressure and his traps. Hopefully with his snares he will be able to shut down loops like clown however im worried they might addon it.
---
I hate playing against SWF there is no chance to get 2 kills. My hex ruin stays for 5 seconds and 2 generators pop up when im in chase with 1 survivor for 2 minutes. Unfair af.
---
nooonono, that's me bringing out the ebony mori
---
No, but you lure in babysitters
---
is this a new freddy skin? 
---
[https://imgur.com/a/UNL2Xpq](https://imgur.com/a/UNL2Xpq)
---
If I understood them correctly, action speed reduction when you're in the dream world is just straight up gone.
---
It's understandable given all the new powers they're giving him, but it was probably one of my favorite things about old Freddy. I'm just a little sad to see it go.
---
Top comment on the stream post has everything in it.
---
I suppose that is true
---
If they remove large loops (I'm ok with that) they should also remove bloodlust.
---
They explained everything in their livestream and called it „Loop Rework“
---
They have never refunded bloodpoints after a rework
---
*Twitch users
---
How does that affect you lol? Do you currently buy cosmetics? Then great this would be worth it for you as you get more for your money. Do you not buy cosmetics? Then great no one is forcing you to buy this.
---
I actually do know, there is just something about this concept that really pisses me off
---
Is it still live
---
Yeah I'm totally aware of that but overall becoming F2P is usually not a good idea. But hey, maybe if there proposed plan sucks in implementation it can be considered? As of now I don't think F2P is a good idea.
---
I think it would be great
---
not really, they're sold at many home decor stores and used as decorations.
---
Hmmm...its fair. Im juat gonna try him out myself. Im just saying the person who said she tried him out and liked him made me a little doubtful of the rework.
---
Yes you can also skip back to see the explanation of it :)
---
What is p3
---
&gt;snares made into an addon
---
##D A R N
---
So do you think there will be a killer web and a survivor web? Or will it be mixed together? I don’t want to have to do killer things just to advance to learn more about survivors.
---
They never said more pallers CLOSER. They said more pallets. Also look MoM will be gone soon, exhaisting is a one time thing unless you use your common addons as a huntress and take that away too. Insta heals are the rares - killers have their own very strong rares. And again you really havent played it seems on the other side or you just not a good killer. It seems you dont know how short loops work. A good killer won't let you loop between 2 short loops he will block you between the 2, bloodlust and hit you . It is pretty simple job. Unless there is more pallets around but then this will be pretty stupid
---
They also said that when Freddy teleports to a generator he leaves behind a husk for a little bit similar to The Spirit.
---
¿
---
Yeah right? I mean gen teleporting by itself is great. As we know, killers with mobility tend to be strong where as ones with lack of mobility tend to be weaker.
---
The other stuff is bonus haha
---
Why is McCote so gassy all the time?
---
If my man can teleport to gens than he'll join hag as being the equivalent to nurse on console.
---
All seriousness tho that would give him fucking insane map pressure.
---
Prestige 3
---
Tier 4 H:R
---
Why is everyone so extremely mad about the battle pass? I think it’s great for the game even if you have to pay 10 or 15 dollars to get the full version
---
Not in my case, I just really don't like the tought of paying for something like this. Most people will go like "then just don't buy it" but I know I'm gonna buy it anyways and even if I don't, other people will.
---
kinda looks like there'll be more, just weaker ones
---
there’ll be cribs in place of hooks
---
Holy shit, that would be so broken lol
---
It’s not letting me. can you tell me about the rework pls?
---
&gt; It's a game without a casual mode, so you're allowed to practice during ranked matches, even if it'll reduce your chances of winning.
---
Plus, people don't really care about rank anyway, so it's sort of baffling to me that the only matchmaking mode in the game is a ranked mode.
---
Wtf jake x david is like 99% official right now
---
Bottles instead of gens
---
it would make more sense as a reference to a horror classic considering it’s a horror game, if it was a decoration I would’ve expected a plant or at least something inside it.
---
Even if he’s bad, his new power sounds terrifying.  I’ll still play him.
---
Ok but I love this
---
wasn't that one of the last streams? Or are they doing that again
---
Uhh... Suicide memes and half the comments agree with wanting to kill themselves... Yikes..
---
you forgot all the "ching chang!" and flat out racist slurs. The chat is embarrassing and awful..
---
[deleted]
---
Flair checks out
---
message deleted by a moderator
---
Oh, maybe. Missed that
---
They said in the past they'll rework her addons
---
Well creating these costumes takes resources right? How would they even run as a company if they did everything for free?
---
I hope they keep the snares. Being able to creat fake pallets is cool but its bad against a good SWF teams. The ability to shut down a loop on the otherhand is apreciated with any killer.
---
Nothing ticks me off more than a survivor barely getting out and saying 'EZ'
---
Oh hell yes, I was hoping for passive sleep stages.  Fits way more with how the Nightmare on Elm Street movies went.
---
Oh boy. Whens the expected release date for the rework?
---
Not true in the slightest.
---
Unsafe pallets against a killer with a brain is absolutely worthless to even attempt to play on. And with things like spirit fury and bloodlust 4king with the new pallet changes will take absolutely no effort whatsoever.
---
Also missed HybridPanda...
---
Because they did use it in one of the former streams. And it was awesome
---
That’s what I’m saying. They screwed themselves by even showing him. Now they have to make him!
---
I'll try to explain it, but bear with me.
---
Basically, they're trying to make pallet loops less valuable individually, but more pallets around the map. So you won't be able to run one pallet loop twenty times, but there will be four more pallets around the map that you can run four times each.
---
Lol how do you add more pallets without them being closer?? If you add a pallet anywhere on the map, it will make 2 pallets closer together...that's how it works...
---
He's from the Livestream and started the conversation with the interviewer just correcting her from "Game designer" to "Level Designer"
---
I buy cosmetics and will buy the battlepass. But you know the phrase "vote with your money"? Doesn't really apply to compulsive spenders like me and it just feels like another way for them to take more money from me. I want the rewards tho, so I'm gonna get it when it comes out. And I am dissapointed in myself that I will.
---
Link?
---
Just because one person tweeted something doesn’t make it a popular opinion.
---
New Ace skin looking good
---
Holy shit it's like a bunch of racist children
---
It's not the survivors fault that you're so bad you chase someone for 5 minutes.
---
I’m neither, just pointing out that something isn’t pedophilia because it isn’t.
---
I mean, some of these people need more attention. Haven't heard of the two guests they had, but they seem nice.
---
Maybe?
---
🐷🐷🐷
---
If they're looping you for 5 minutes I think you have some issues buddy XD
---
It's beautiful
---
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
DOUBLE BLOODPOINTS JUNE 14th-18th!
---
You can watch without chat, quit crying.
---
His ability could possibly be based on the 5 stages of grief, debuffing the survivors?
---
**Moderator note:**
---
&gt; Post already created.
---
Monto yes, fuck noob tho. People like tru and tyde time are the greats of our community. (Idk if they were shown cause I missed that part)
---
No one should say this is a buff till we see him played or we play him ourselves. The devs took this long to "fix him" im skeptical of anything they do.
---
Gives 8k survival instead of 5k when escaping the match lol
---
I think i'll judge based on the cosmetics whether i want to buy the pass or not, but either way i'll be getting cosmetics for playing the game
---
Pallet density is the same so not really
---
And an in-game anniversary event from June 18th to July 2nd!
---
It's funny but 
---
1. Repost
---
2. Just because the killer's in it, doesn't mean it belongs here
---
I was expecting triple this weekend
---
Remember A LOT of this stuff is still a work in progress. So dont get attached to all of this!
---
Got a timeout for saying his name, why?
---
The Stall is there to mainly Balance out the transition time. Since Freddy can just go up and hit people now, he no longer needs a built in stall.
---
Current freddy: shit a large map, good luck with applying pressure and mindgameing survs wakeing up on the otherside of the map.
---
Future freddy: Whats a large map?
---
Teleporting to gens? Gotta get my diapers ready.
---
kidding? Tyde, with his uninformed bs and trash Tierlists?
---
And Tru is a known trash talker.
---
Can you tell me what Noobs doing wrong?
---
Pretty sure if you are trying to split hairs between attraction to physically immature and attraction to socially and emotionally immature humans you are basically defending pedophiles
---
I would wear this in a heartbeat
---
So you think they should be able to do something that would make them broken. Gotcha
---
Your Freddy might become a mini Nurse, and you complain ? LOL.
---
To be fair, bloodlust was needed back when it was introduced...
---
I thought you gonna say that. Can we stop. They will reduce the width of the loops if you didnt notice. So you get that extra space you have to run. So that extra pallet has to be like next to you, which won't happen, for things to work well
---
Anything coming this weekend now???
---
Yeah it's definitely a more skill based game then most people would assume.
---
It's not that survivors or killers are stronger. It's usually 80% player skill over anything else
---
Hex: bleach my eyes
---
I'm pretty psyched to see what these "surprises" they speak of are. (:
---
They're removing his stall.  They would have given him Spirit-level power to counteract it.  Instead he's a walking Order addon without the stall ability, and *maybe* the wretched lovechild of Trapper and Clown.
---
Oh, and the most mediocre map control ability yet.
---
Teleporting to gens is gonna be heat for scares and I’m glad there is another way to wake up. I hated how random it was trying to wake yourself up. Not a skill check in sight when I needed it most.
---
Found it: it was the mid chapter 2.7.0 ptb Q and A when they talked about the legion changes back before they were live.
---
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXtSA3YOKac
---
Oh for sure I can see the snares being more practical in use. I was just thinking about how fun the "oh shit" moment would be when you throw down a pallet only for it to explode in blood lol.
---
Ikr, why have a huge event and not mic drop something happening today? Maybe still something to come
---
&gt; Pallet density is the same
---
I don't think they said that.  They showed a "before" and "after" and there were significantly more pallets in the "after" picture.
---
I don’t think tyde was in the video.  I used to watch him, I kinda just grew off of him but I definitely need to start watching him again
---
I play both Pig and Freddy :)
---
Even then grow a pair cause it still isn’t toxic. They’re just wasting space for you to catch up.
---
I wonder what that's going to be.  Might be worth saving those Streamers for the anniversary event.
---
not great, but okay
---
If the snares are his goo traps from the movies tho... definately cooler.
---
&gt;plenty of killers don’t know how to counter good loopers
---
That's because some loops involve no mindgame. If there is no wall and the loop is safe there's no real 'counter' except bite the pallet. 
---
(If you don't count perks and some abilities)
---
Right? Players always bitch about the game progression so they give us a battle pass now they bitch about that? Dbd community is bipolar lol
---
Message deleted by moderator
---
how? are the areas around a loop smaller now
---
If they kept the stall I'd agree.  Without the stall though, it's a big oof, especially since he has to set up his shenanigans.
---
&gt; That’s like saying doom, Skyrim, and a bunch of other shit shouldn’t be on the switch  
---
Oh, is that what I said?
---
The streamers opinions im taking with a grain of salt. It maybe be just me, but have the fog whispers actually done anything to actually help the game? If they have please tell me because i've been playing for a while and havent notice them help the game at all.
---
I'm kind of bummed Cahla and Vinc3 didn't get to talk more :(
---
Of course all the maps are getting nerfed for survivors. What a surprise.
---
Nah, if he kept his stall I might agree.
---
I already buy the outfit pieces 5 dollars a pop . Why should I be forced to get the pass for a certain outfit . Watch them put bunny feng in it .
---
Yeah, in their own words they're trying to add more skill based gameplay, which means they want more pallets to be "mind-game-able".
---
Really good analysis of my argument and dissection of my points with your counterpoints.
---
Found it: it was the mid chapter 2.7.0 ptb Q and A when they talked about the legion changes back before they were live. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXtSA3YOKac
---
Monitor and Distressing do not work together at all
---
Did I say that? Nah. There’s nothing wrong with DBD coming to the switch. It’s a damn good game that’s sadly plagued by bugs.
---
I see
---
I’m not sure, as far as I know they test new things in the game and review it, they also get free auric cells to buy new killers and survivors when they’re released to review them as well
---
Someone has never played Hag then. There's a lot more mindgames and decision making when playing Hag than there ever has been for Billy
---
Ormond is such a shitstain of a map. How did they make it built so poorly AND destroy aura reading?
---
I heard them say it, I didn't see the picture tho... maybe I'm wrong
---
Survivor with a good amount of killer play.
---
Moniter isn't good on doctor try running unnerving presence
---
Nurses no longer affects snap out so it’s not that great for doc
---
ENGLISH ONLY
---
cause he evil!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I think Aerith is still in the lifestream to this day
---
But the stall only kicks in AFTER the transition. At least the way I played him I was like Doctor or Legion and went around playing "Sleep Tag" to slow the game down.
---
A killer with full ranged capability getting 115 MS? 
---
So should old Nurse come back too? With 3 blinks and not sub 100 MS?
---
We were all sad on angrypug's stream watching you that it was not a 3x BP weekend. After all it is a big event for the game. But oh well
---
Thats it though, you don't get everything for free. You do see what extras you could get if you just spend a little extra money. It's a clever way to manipulate people in to spending money and seing from the reactions on my post, it works. Most people just accept it. When you look at cosmetics in a store, most people can constrain themself. If you want a certain cosmetic, you'll most likely get it, but you don't feel obliged to get it. You can just get it any other day. Wih the battlepass, if I am not mistaken, you have a time limit. You will feel some pushing when you see your timer ticking down before the battlepass resets. "I don't really need these rewards, but if I don't pay for them now, they'll be gone" and it's this tactic that works on my like a charm and I guess thats why it makes me so angry, I don't think I'll be able to hold back and I'll just buy that pass every single fucking season
---
Before anybody asks, we don’t know what the anniversary event will consist of yet.
---
Instasaw
---
Is there a perk I should look out for in the blood web? My doctor is lvl 46
---
Nope. I've seen "Ghostface" written officially and the DbD devs are using "Ghost Face". Neither of those are "GhostFace", are they?
---
It’s spam and unproductive. Makes sense to me
---
What's your alternative strategy for DBD to be a profitable game? Free to own, free to play, can't montetize cosmetics, can't release paid DLC. What's your model?
---
get of game, get on stream
---
10 minute timeout is for everyone. Without it, chat would be unusable
---
I'm more annoyed by the fact that people can't behave in a chat.
---
Also pig knockoff for having the alarm on a nightstand that's highlighted in white. Disappointed.
---
Get a band for the livestream to announce how you will work on the game experience for the next year. Did you even listen to what they say or just enjoyed the music?
---
Even before it was being spammed they were timing people out for it though. It’s only being spammed now because they’re timing out others. Lol
---
It’s cute AF that’s why
---
we'll see, they haven't been especially clear or detailed about a lot of things
---
It’s the pallet store. Duh
---
why do you wanna say his name for
---
shove your stall up your butt.
---
He gets actual powers, might even be on Billy level
---
Apart from the fact they're doing both
---
Died before The Entity could take him, as confirmed by devs.
---
RIP Carl, gone far too soon.
---
Nah not really  ne just has a fun time
---
"Ghostface wants to take his time stalking"
---
*meanwhile 5 gens pop off*
---
I mean, they’re not saying anything worthwhile and the devs already don’t like him so if they’re just saying “noob3” constantly with no other text it will get annoying
---
Hag mains too... I-
---
Same here
---
&gt;implying that there aren't already several game breaking bugs making it unplayable ~50% of the time
---
No it is still toxic.
---
guess should have put my /s
---
He's so beautiful :(
---
See the whole thing is looking at the list if fog whispers most are toxic and a couple dont play the game enough and a small few are actual respected. No offense but im not listening to them and their biased opinions.
---
Pretty sure there both not mutually exclusive.
---
Can’t be more happy I main The Neet and the Dead detective.
---
But timewise the stall gains you the time you lose by having to wait for transition.
---
I don't know how they can do Ghostface justice. The major thing in the movies that I can recall is that there are two people working together. Otherwise he's a quicker stalker. I don't have very high expectations for him.
---
Your wot?
---
More like a walking Order addon with a Trapper/Clown hybrid and a mediocre mobility option.
---
really hoping we get anniversary rewards.
---
More killer lore yay!
---
Thats one i agree is respectable.
---
Huh? First time I’m hearing of such a thing
---
https://youtu.be/5JNlTD0I7UM
---
They mention unique rewards given out on stream.
---
Stall alone cant kill. 
---
Not gonna argue with you tho...already tried that in the past
---
The only of his perks that is bad is Coulrophobia. Pop Goes the Weasel can be fantastic and is a decent alternative to Ruin if you don't feel like dealing with totems. Bamboozle's ability to shut down windows can be just as useful as Brutal Strength or Enduring given the right map tile.
---
A few days after his release you’ll only get to One. All survivors will probably d/c after.
---
My favorite part of this game is looping the killer
---
They seem to delete messages at random.
---
I posted "message deleted by a moderator." and they actually deleted it. It's kinda absurd.
---
&gt;always lurk in an area where 1 survivor was
---
No, because as per the guide, the survivors should be attempting to split up so that they can repair gens at maximum efficiency, not bringing the killer down on their teammates. 
---
&gt;and always double back to the gen 5 seconds into a chase
---
No, you should know when you're being lured away versus when you are just being looped.
---
&gt;Also camp hard.
---
I'm not sure how you got that out of the above guide. Camping is a surefire way to minimize your kills against any kind of semi-coordinated survivor team. I'm starting to get the idea you didn't read the guide at all and are just trying to defend your particular playstyle.
---
I wait till I see opportunity then I zoom out of the shadows
---
Damn wanted it this weekend. Next week is new PoE league.
---
/s means everything he just said was sarcastic
---
I'm sorry if I'm overreacting, but Freddy was the only killer I really enjoyed consistently.  Now it feels like I have no killer I find fun, and survivor makes me want to sleep.
---
Some stuff is paid? That's no good-
---
Dave the creative director of DBD and Mathieu  Cote joked that there's no Carl the cashier because GhostFace killed him before entity consumed his soul, so that's why he's not in the game.
---
And Mathieu Cote said that they "wanted" to add him to the game, but couldn't.
---
Nonsense. If Cote wanted him in the game, he'd have been added.
---
Cosmetics for playing the game is definitely a good thing. It's just that when it comes to a battlepass, I know that I will not be able to hold myself back and buy the pack every time. Just because there is a time limit. "I can just get items in the store any other time, but if I don't get the battlepass now, all these rewards I have unlocked will go away"
---
can't we just chill out and be happy for once
---
smaller loops, more consistent on the map and also just more small loops anyway, removing fat shames and infinite window loops
---
your choice to try other Killers, or you know? wait and Test the rework before throwing a tantrum
---
Replace Monitor with a chase perk like Enduring, BS, SF. Replace Nurse's with a game slow like Ruin, Bloodwarden or Lullaby. Then you'll be set.
---
My personal favourite doc build is double calm add-ons, Monitor, BBQ, Surveilance/Discordance, Enduring. 6m terror radius when in punishment, almost 60m in treatment, combined with massive gen exposure makes easy grabs and efficient switches into treatment.
---
What is the Freddy rework details?
---
You know they won’t do that lol
---
Ah ok, im not from earth
---
When she said I can do this all day your response should’ve been “yeah yeah, I know”
---
I mean if we're going to that extent though, the lamp looks like a baseball bat. Maybe a referance to paranoia agent? I think Chucky had couches in his movies, coincidence?
---
I've tried other killers and none of them are as consistently fun.  I'll test the rework, but I have low hopes for my personal fun factor on it.
---
I think It was ironic?
---
Pick some, not all.  When you keep adding PAY mechanics to the game, you may as well change your name to EA. You get to pick some, not all.   
---
If they NEEEEEED all of those to stay profitable, then they didn't make a good product.  They just want to double/triple/quadruple dip a this point, which equates to nothing but GREED.
---
Yes we are all aware of the battlepass and have been for quite some time now.

---
4 second stalk for an exposed effect??
---
That sounds insanely OP for a full speed stealth killer
---
I sure hope so.  It really feels like he's a walking order addon though.
---
What dbd rewards?
---
That cougar on the guitar is 100% worth it.
---
Who cares lol. Don't like it, don't get it; cosmetics have always been expensive extras
---
If you dont give the unhooked guy a chance you’re not gonna get a token tho.
---
Why do they have the same name?
---
Why wouldn’t they? It’s a pointless comment with no value and is just taking up screen space and taking away visibility from real comments....
---
Welcome to prime time, bitch...
---
*killer looks at survivor* Disconnected.
---
Why is double BP weekend during Origins? 😭 Why does the universe hate me
---
I am just disappointed we may not be able to get it with shards. for me shards are worthless
---
That is most certainly going to be adjusted. 
---
But also keep in mind - if survivors detect him and look in his direction, it breaks his power.
---
Main reason is that it's limited time only. Don't play during a specific window due to life events or burn out? Bad luck pal, you've missed out forever.
---
Also battle passes are impulse buyers worst enemies as well as other psychological stuff.
---
Anybody confused they mention unique rewards during the 3rd year anniversary trailer.
---
New killer - The Producer
---
Unique power - Pretty Good Job
---
 *message deleted by a moderator*
---
8dyúYx,
---
This is lookin really good for ur boi Sharp Hand Joe
---
I remember the fortnite battlepass. Every 10 stages of the paid battlepass there is one cosmetic part of the free stage. In other words as a free battlepass User there is no reason to care about the battlepass.
---
I hope it’s better in dbd
---
I like him.
---
I've always thought the amount of pallets in the game is high. Think some other objects would be fitting to knock over.
---
No I love him
---
New perk - awkward flirtation.
---
D A R N
---
Amazing that people are using their 10 minute timeouts on this
---
Ba dum tss
---
Tier 4 stalker mode
---
We do not speak ill of our god. He's doing a pretty good job.
---
we did a pretty cool job so far
---
This is speculation, I’m not saying it’s actually what I think it is and it may or may not just be a cloche. I just think it has more place as a reference than a piece of glass with nothing on display
---
Jimmy*, isn’t it?
---
Eh I already love Freddy as is so I’m still a bit worried
---
He borderline harassed a streamer, then tried to take credit for her own success.
---
Ghostface right now looks great, looks like a high-skill, high-reward type of killer - his perks on the other hand...
---
This really feels bad.  It seems like he's a nerfed Order addon, potentially mixed with a weird hybrid of Trapper and Clown.  Gen teleport is nice though.
---
I'll have to try this rework but it honestly seems pretty meh, and the removal of his stall leaves a bad taste in my mouth as a Freddy main.
---
That's my only fear about the battlepass. I like having more objectives in the game to do. Such as well a road to unlock more stuff. But the timer of how long the season will last for this is what I fear.
---
Limited time only stuff and they're very good for manipulating people into buying and then forcing them to dedicate a lot of time and/or money into making the most out of the purchase.
---
The live chat is disgusting. There should be an age verification to watch this stream since it’s for a Mature game, and there should be an automatic “per-minute-post-limit” applies to everyone in chat.
---
Where did I say I was going to buy it?
---
Maybe I misunderstood but I got the impression the husk appeared at the generator whilst it's spurting blood before he fully materialises at it
---
You can just hide chat lol
---
I leveled Bill literally just for borrowed time.. otherwise I wouldnt have touched him lol
---
You can definitely beat swf groups.  Your claim that you can't so much as kill 2 is absurd.  It sounds like you're still learning killer if this is your mindset.  Their communication makes it tougher sure, but if you play well you can beat 4 mans.
---
We've done a pretty good job so far
---
A system that punishes you for your opponent being bad is a bad system.
---
Currently you get punished for never being found and for none of your teammates ever being hit. You can get two iris and you still might not pip up.
---
Nah bro it's a strategy to dead hard into rocks, make the killer hit the rocks and you pick up the cobblestone
---
Did you watch the stream? They showed quite a bit of stuff.
---
I am not annoyed. I an glad.
---
But we already seen them lol.
---
While it takes four seconds for him to apply a survivor just has to look at him for 1, Ghostface shouldn’t be punished by just anyone sneaking around and ruining his play. Like I said, if the Survivor he’s stalking can do it it’s fine, but I don’t think just anybody should be able to
---
Changing her long hitboxes, wherein she hits you even though her bonesaw doesn't physically touch you, would be great.
---
And no, this happens in under 60ms ping games.
---
I think that your post is full of whining.
---
The crowd was so dead. Felt so awkward. Had to be asked to clap
---
This needs to reach the top. Best moment of the stream!
---
We'll see when he's released, but they really should increase the timer to 2 seconds, as depending on how the game counts it, a survivor just wildly turning their screen around constantly and catching ghostface for half a frame COULD count as 1 second.
---
IT'S PRIME TIME BITCH

I was hoping to see a little bit of the rapgod Fungoose. But alas another day.
---
THANK YOU

God, all the fucking racism, misogyny, and fat-shaming had me seeing red. That’s just gamers I guess
---
you won't depip though so it's not a punishment...?
---
Very beautiful, would love to see more!
---
Man I do love a good killer vs survivor war with my popcorn.
---
Right?!
---
Its not that the game is full of people like that, its the thing that mostly the toxic uneducated kids and edgy teenagers are making their voices heard by spamming and by bitching a lot everywhere, the twitch chat was a prime example of that
---
And hopefully they'll start getting banned for that.
---
You're wrong about the joining together thing.  That no longer means anything.  Devs updated that months ago.  Solo players can join simultaneously now.
---
**DISGRACEFUL BEHAVIOR FROM BHVR** in the twitch chat, by censoring TOP players in DBD community, who brought in a lot of people into the game, and keep the game alive. They are: noob3, Monto, Puppers.
---
Cleaning "chat" is a BS excuse, they didn't erase emoticons, or monotonous "warning" messages copy-pasted by various twtich users (This is why eSports will never hit the general public...").
---
They say they care about DBD community, but their actions speak otherwise.
---
Fuck BHVR, fuck the mods. [They wouldn't even Puppers talk](https://i.imgur.com/MzSu6Ja.png) in twitch chat about anything.
---
How is this different from a shop selling clothes for a month and then selling different clothes? Just dont buy the preminum pass, i wont be
---
We have no clue how blood lust will work with the new pallet spawns. The games been out for three years now. Saying blood lust isnt a main function of the game because it wasnt out at launch is like saying hex perks like ruin and devour hope shouldnt be good becuase there were no totems before hag released.
---
I honestly thought the stream was great! Well worth the hype they done
---
probably, but what about Monto?
---
Not official tho, i was expenting mathieu saying "we are proud we have new costumes for a licenced character, The pig!" Or somethin...
---
You say that but early-game Mike Myers can easily stalk for much longer than that without being seen, and he doesn’t have the lean and crouch
---
Ok then. But this is still a post about the Twitch stream so no need to try and invalidate an opinion by insulting me.
---
Same type of people who thought the old pallet vacuums were 100% necessary and healthy for the game.
---
Good call.
---
We know.
---
They have been in the files for a long time.
---
No0b3 isn’t toxic lol
---
He opened the stream with “Wow!” &lt;3
---
Browsing this sub doesn't do that for you?
---
That poor band got so much hate lol
---
The gengrabs gonna be real
---
I mean, it was time consuming, but its not like there are really that many places that have 3 min infinites any more.
---
Skins!
---
Survivors who are smart and observant don’t fall as easily to Myers as some people think
---
Well it wasn’t an audience, it was all the devs, they already knew everything that was shown
---
Where in the video do they mention this?
---
Yeah but the idiocy contained here is left in New and Downvoted comments.
---
The survivors see blood and a husk of freddy during the teleporting. They will need to be potatoes for that.
---
But his whole ability is hiding. If someone sees you you basically failed at hiding which is his ability. Plus 4 seconds is pretty damn fast so it really isn't that bad of a trade off as it punished you for failing at stealth but if you don't get seen then you're rewarded greatly with a instadown for 20 whole seconds.
---
Exactly. I'll still miss the stall though. Sure I can apply more pressure post-rework but it'll require a lot of skill which I don't have.
---
that gen teleport shit is gonna be cool
---
Calm down big boy No need to play the righteous moral high ground
---
Maybe you kids should stop making Twitch chat a cesspool if you don't want it heavily moderated
---
They're just gonna make the game more frustrating for solo players.
---
They only counter to pro Nurse right now is pro swf team.
---
In solo games, at ranks 1-10 the percentage of 3-4 players escaping is likely below 40%.
---
Outplayed lol you get fucked over by doing your job
---
Hoping for this Jane outfit this upcoming week
---
Why dont they like noob3? I was so lost on this?
---
No!
---
BAB!
---
I wouldn’t see to much into it it’s just a jar now Hellpriest (pinhead) would be cool. Plus it could be for decoration or they simply like Hellraiser. 
---
But that seems too common to grab at. Now I can say I saw a video of a guy going into forums or some shit and decrypting things to be Hellraiser so that might be a possibility. But alas not much proof and hard to believe. 
---
That being said I would love to see Hellpriest and Kirsty, only them. 
---
“Your suffering will be legendary even in hell”
---
Y’all act like people can’t voice their concerns. Battle passes can be lame, because it’s forcing someone to pay right then or miss out on cosmetics, because who knows when they’ll come back. If they come back. They already have a damn shop, that’s enough. 🙄
---
This rework makes him look like he still sucks
---
Monto, is that you?
---
Just watch the stream if you wanna see matt aweeeee baby
---
O
---
I never knew
---
I mean the actual anniversary isn't until the 11th (or is it the 14th?) of June so maybe we'll get something like a double bloodpoint week or weekend or maybe cosmetics near those dates
---
One non-sequitor deserves another?
---
Legion mabey and nothing else.
---
So the game is in its third year and too celebrate it we only get a double increase.
---
Now don't get me wrong i am happy with the event i just thought if you were to do it it would be triple since its in its third year.
---
google bookmark while using chrome makes me a little sad inside, also prob want to go to paint to cut the other screen from screenshot, and while there cover up the names of people from lobby
---
Welcome to primetime, bitch!
---
No, this is true.
---
I already dislike badham a lot so I really welcome these changes. Hope they’re for the best, but it can’t really annoy me much more than it already does.
---
Four seconds is fast yes but 1 second from anyone is even faster, it should be 1 second for the person he’s stalking and I’d say at minimum 2.5 for outside observers
---
Devs confirmed Carl won't be a thing.
---
Guys, I found one. This argument is stupid and you know it. People only ever use this to justify bad behavior by saying pointing it out is somehow a bad thing. Shut up.
---
The way they present changes and adjustments to this game is the equivalent of figuring out how to build an atomic bomb. Like, its a video game..shit doesnt need months, sometimes years, of discussion. Try some stuff and see if it works. 
---
And yes..that completely meaningless corporate slide of "rework, refresh, relaunch" gave me HR seminar flashbacks. Someone at BHVR took the time to think out and make this three arrow slide to tell the idiots of the world how progress works.
---
I got my message deleted because I said "imagine if noob3 was on that couch", so make of that what you will.
---
This post is something else
---
Mindgames and tricking people that you lost them. It will work greatly on red paint brush Freddy.
---
... It's Twitch. That's like complaining there are too many clowns at a circus.
---
Twitch is full of crybabies
---
They should add both
---
Do we get DBD cosmetics if we buy it ?
---
*No.
---
Like those street pallets in Haddonfield.
---
No it's not, let the purchasers of the game decide for themselves, most of them are kids, this is how they express themselves, let them be.
---
Censoring top dbd players like noob3, monto and puppers was low, though. It only encouraged people to keep saying their names.
---
I don’t really like thrilling tremors as I’m often solo and stuck with idiots who get down in five seconds. Rip.
---
They stayed on the stream there would be no new map and survivor 
---
Not Queen had discussed a few days before the stream too
---
Yes! Sounds like an awesome rework, the teleporting ability alone is fantastic. I hope the "snare trap" visually looks like when the teenagers get caught in quicksand like nancy on the stairs
---
Dwight knew he had to do it
---
I'm not going to copy and paste my comment because it still applies.
---
There’s an exclamation mark for a reason
---
A few live streams I've seen (No I don't remember exactly when) she makes a simple mistake or does something he I guess doesn't approve of and he gets po at her for it. It's really been multiple occasions and some may see it as "jokingly mad" but even then it's not a thing to joke about.
---
I guess, if you're chasing someone and you hear a generator being worked on nearby, if you don't have a large TR you can switch targets and jump the person on the gen?  
---
Just kidding, no way you can hear a gen being worked on with the chase music blaring in its current state.
---
I think it’s more that playing as killer becomes more frustrating than fun after a while. I don’t think looping is *toxic* but a rework would be nice.
---
Absolutely nothing
---
It's not that it excuses it, it's just that it's expected on Twitch.
---
Why the fuck would you think that excuses it?
---
Are you a fucking idiot?
---
Where on earth did I say I want survivors to have "guaranteed wins" ????????????????????????
---
The game right now is literally the hardest it's ever been to survive and the easiest it's been to get kills. You're fucking delusional.
---
Spirit would like a word with you.
---
with freddy, they showed the generators bleeding before he can teleport so it'll be easy to hide? we'll see, i hope it's decent
---
[https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/add-carl-to-dead-by-daylight](https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/add-carl-to-dead-by-daylight)
---
Im pretty sure you can rewatch the stream on youtube and educate yourself.
---
It was a nice stream.  There just isn’t anything to be hyped for anymore.  All of the things they have announced for June have been pretty much known for over a week.  And any of the really exciting stuff is more than two months away now that the ptb is going to dehype the new killer again.  Events are cool but not two hour stream then stay hyped for 3 weeks of more waiting cool.   I’m satisfied with the stream.  But everything is already either too spoiled or too far off for me to care before late June.
---
well they said the numbers aren’t confirmed. 4 seconds to expose a survivor is also short as hell
---
So Ghostface's story is literally the same as the girls from Tragedy Girls? Why couldn't we have just gotten them instead? &gt;.&gt;
---
I’m just paranoid about the whole situation. To me, it looks like I’m All Ears drew inspiration from Who Are You? due to Auras of Survivors being revealed if they were to do an action that would create a noise bubble, basically.
---
The Noob3 and Puppers bans were because of spam autoban bots I think, because people were just spamming the name
---
The one mechanic that allows you to actually survive is supposed to be "toxic"? come on... you have a brain right?
---
It is harder to rework a killer than perks. Nurse can never really be balanced  since she ignores most parts of a chase.
---
i completely forgot about that
---
Yea that's what I said, I thought they could make it so his movespeed decreased over time while using his power, a d vaulting and shit would make him slow down faster
---
I’ve been saying they need to rename it Dead By Daylight: Killer Simulator.
---
What does karen have to do with this lol ?
---
And btw i meant basic advantages , if " disabled people using macro " happens to be just like normal gameplay then fine it can work, i just meant macro doesn't give enormous advantages for PC player . Therefore the only thing stopping console from coming close is specific killers and camera sensitivity
---
It's all about pressure. If you can hit 2-3 people with FF, you're good. If you see 3 people fully healed after that, you're not applying enough pressure.
---
Thanks a ton! I'll write this down and prepare to make a bloodpoints doctor build :) 
---
Much love!!
---
really? well a temporary ban usually doesnt put you on the bad side, at least not in most other games Im following
---
Take me home?
---
So a perk that lets you see what gens are being worked on when you pick up ( not hook ) and stops survivors moving to others and tapping is bad?
---
Pass what your smoking please
---
If the cosmetics of the pass aren’t exclusive and are added to the store in the future, I will 100% support the battlepass
---
Mostly I don't like the fact that they removed the stall and the seven second mindgame in exchange for what is effectively a worse Order addon.
---
It....was a joke.....the joke being that hex ruin is broken at the beginning of the match due to them spawning right in front of it.
---
as someone who never watched that movie. can you explain the difference
---
I feel the gen perk will be better on stealth killers.
---
they are adding more pallets though, and tbh in terms of pallet loops quantity&gt;quality
---
“never addressed our concerns”
---
Did you not see the massive, big, bold sign that said “NO PAY TO WIN”?
---
Too true.
---
Hell. No. I play killer when I want to accomplish something. Survivor when I just wanna relax. BECAUSE IT'S EASIER and I don't need to stress with all the micromanaging it takes to be killer. Shut up on how it's hard to survive, you want to take the two things that help killers at least keep up in chase.
---
It activates when a person is downed, not picked up. 
---
So it has harder counter play than BBQ. Also if you stop working on the generator, then the generator will be locked for 16 seconds. So it won't be 8 seconds than back to normal.
---
While I will be disappointed to see his stealth factor go, it's still an infinitely better spot then where he's at right now.
---
No. Op didn't realize that it was a joke, basically saying that ruin is destroyed right at the beginning of the match due to survivors spawning at it
---
I'll be honest I'm not knowledgeable enough to really weigh in. My motivation to play started when Friday the 13th was confirmed dead in the water.   I need to experiment more but I never play with friends so I've played it awfully safe.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
&gt;I was expecting today to be the launch of Ghostface
---
Why would you expect that when they already announced he is being released on 18th?
---
Yeah this isn't a good thing, they're just making all loops bloodlustable
---
You made it! Thank you so much!! But I think Philip is straight-he’s in a relationship with Sally now-and Evan is bi.
---
oh no they TEA BAGGED at a pallet and the toxic survivor players are being disrespectful in TWITCH CHAT
---
No 3x the ***
---
I dont know my dude, some people have some pretty spicy opinions that gain a lot of traction on this sub.
---
How is that toxic?
---
You’d be surprised how long things like that can feel. Guess I’ll just hold out hope that numbers get tweaked, even if they lowered the time someone is exposed in return for a longer amount of time to disable the power that’d be fine
---
The problem to your approach (as well as the reason you're probably getting downvoted) is that it relies very heavily on stealth. Too often do I see survivors crouching around the map with Urban Evasion, hiding in lockers and bushes as soon as the heartbeat can be heard, because they're too scared to face the killer head on and distract him so their teammates can do generators. If you're playing immersed, and not doing useful things (cleansing totems, doing gens, etc.), you're a burden to the team as a whole.
---
If you're doing gens, cool, keep doing them. If you're too scared to do so because the killer might hit you, grow a pair and learn how to loop. If you looped the killer for 4 gens, you did an excellent job, and your team will likely survive thanks to you... unless they're immersed, pretending to be a tree or something.
---
Gen Teleportation is a redeeming factor in my eyes.  Also, while thr devs did say he no longer slows the gane down, I don't recall them mentioning his wallhack at all.  So I have hope.
---
Also where clocks really needed? Like its not easy enough to wake up?
---
So it will be a normal ptb where everyone wants to play killer than a day later people mostly play jug.
---
Agreed. I think WGLF should be tied to other things instead of unhooking. Like for killers BBQ is based on their objective (hooking survivors). WGLF should also be somewhat objective based, like completing gens or cleansing totems. It would make it easier to get stacks but you wouldn't necessarily get the stacks every game depending on how well or not well you and your team do.
---
Well, I guess I set myself up for it.
---
Trust me... I know what I'm talking about. Hag is easiest of the top tiers by a large margin. Yes, there are mindgames related to her power but they work very similar regardless of the map, tile or survivor. Because billy can easily be looped, he needs to know exactly which loops he can use his chainsaw, how to use it, how to whip it around the corner, when to fake it... There is much deeper mindgames and mechanics with billy than there is with hag. The difference is that billy can be used by even the newest players to just travel the map quick and occasionally get a bodyblock chainsaw, while baby hags are usually laughably bad. However hag is far easier to master than billy
---
thanks! twitch chat has been useless in trying to find information. I wasn't able to watch because I was at work.
---
True, but it is still a 5 second teleport across the map. Scratches fade in 10 seconds so you need to gtfo fast or try to urban away.
---
They had already confirmed the date for GhostFace release days before the stream. And I wasn't even expecting double BP again until way later this year.
---
How could they be a fan club for something that isnt even in the fog yet
---
I mean, it's being publicly release in about a month and a half so it's safe to say they've been working on it a lot.
---
Sure, but as someone mentioned, if they are all unsafe pallets (too short of a loop) then there’s no point really.
---
Maybe if you acuallty watched the stream, you would know the 'battlepass' is complety free and has no money. 
---
They are nerfing big pallet loops but adding more loops. 
---
They are rewokring maps which is why we arent getting a new one.
---
We just had Ash as a new survivor.
---
I had the same problem. Try unplugging the Xbox from the outlet and waiting about 5 minutes to clear the cache. I haven’t had it happen since I’ve done that.
---
Only other macro i know of is wiggle.
---
You have people on Twitch who just like to be jerks, and tune into big streams to be dicks
---
You can't ask for new content while also being upset that they would like more money to add said content. They've been overhauling huge aspects of the game, reworking perks, killers, etc, and are adding dedicated servers, and more. All stuff that you do not get charged for. THEN they are also adding DLC, and are charging you FOR THAT. You can't purchase one part of the game and say that it makes up for everything you didn't pay for.
---
Lastly your 'impulses' not allowing you to not buy something sounds like a personal problem. You can't demand a game not  release something because you will just HAVE to buy it. That's the most ridiculous excuse I've ever heard.
---
The gen teleporting makes him look more like the movies and the traps are based on his world shaping abilities which is a core element of the sagas.
---
On the same page he can attack awaken survivors which shits on the character and the whole sagas purpose.
---
They don’t even know what they’re doing yet, none the less having tested or run the usual 3 week ptb for it. You’re just lying to yourself.
---
i think we need a rework for ace and quentin’s perks the most
---
Make the mustach bigger and it will be ingame.
---
No his rework sucks. He's got a completely new playstyle, and his new power does even do that much. He's the mutated child of Hag and Clown now and I hate it.
---
Yep. Not just that, the perk is hidden pretty well. If you are working on a gen when a person is downed, nothing changes for you so you won't know it is there.
---
I don't have any ideas for his powers but I'd love if he could carry the survivors with his hook on the way to the hook. Plus Sarah Michelle Gellar in game with Ghostface AND the Spirit aka the Grudge?! I'd die from excitement.
---
I'm thinking "If you've been in the dying state for 60 continuous seconds, you can offer yourself to the entity".
---
This would be a great idea for an April fools game mode
---
Discordance, Surveillance, Bitter Murmur and Brutal Strength is a nasty build on Freddy. The only downside is your game might take a long ass time if you really want the 4K and how good the survivors are.
---
ITS THE MID CHAPTER PARCH YOU FUCKING IMBECILE. It’s a few months off, they have time, you are a fucking idiot
---
I dont see any use for furtive chase.
---
The terror radius is reduced while in a chase...uuh, why? Whats the actual point of that? You're in a chase, so you're not exactly gonna sneak up on anyone.
---
Yeah that one is actually a lot easier than struggle since it happens mostly 2 times a match and takes less than half a minute most of the time . But yeah that's another use i see people do
---
His point is that the system is broken. The category that should be most likely to be iridescent can't because of how DBD chooses to award emblems.
---
For example, [here](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/964241843434982427/09A2C75DED1390709F80DE72E1D50710C5CF0563/) is a game I had where the killer didn't find me the entire game, and I didn't pip.
---
The only emblem I failed at has "stay hidden from the killer" in bold, as the first requirement.
---
Did we watch the same stream? What nerfs or buffs you mean?
---
Fedora man is finally truely bad.
---
I feel you're wrong about I'm all ears as survivors are pretty damn dumb most of the time and do run vaults and fast actions and plus I can't really keep tracker of people sometimes so it helps with that. Thrilling tremors seems great on teleporting killers like nurse or hillbilly (also rework freddy) it basically cuts down the search and slow the game down just a little bit.
---
Exactly. People might call stream sniping though.
---
No one wanted? Eat crow kid, plenty of people want and are excited for it.
---
It was probably super hot in there too. Poor sod 😂
---
Didn’t catch any big survivor nerfs, the loop priorities are being rebalanced but that’s all I noticed.
---
The mask existed by itself before the movie, the movie just borrowed the rights to use it from Funworld, the company that made the mask.
---
It can be bluffed though, so you run away from the gen towards the maybe fake pallet and into a Freddy, who can teleportmid chase to another gen that you're sprint bursting towards. 
---
It's going to be great mindgames all around. Everything seems counterable but he seems like a rewarding killer to get good with now (final product pending)
---
The power would probably out though
---
Also the DBD Discord mods/staff.  A bunch of power hungry people.
---
Can we get an actual solo queue for once? As killer I queue dodge the second anyone are friends with eachother on their steam list, as it makes a significant difference when the survivors can't use Discord to coordinate.
---
Let killers that want to face premades do so with a point bonus or something.
---
That was the cringiest sentence Ive ever read
---
Thank you
---
Some of you never played Halo 3 or Modern Warfare 2 at its peak and it shows
---
&gt; You say that but early-game Mike Myers can easily stalk for much longer than that without being seen, and he doesn’t have the lean and crouch
---
EW 1 Myers can also have a terror radius as low as 0 meters. Ghostface's is 32.
---
It’s June 18th.
---
He was unique and now he's kinda like a doctor addon mixed with a hag addon mixed with nurse (with the gen teleport thing) mixed with something that is like the current dream world if you squint hard enough. I'm not excited for this rework but I'll see how it plays out in ptb
---
That would be cool
---
nah. most Streamers that only Stream arent that interesting/diverse imo
---
The “First” battlepass is free
---
“FIRST”
---
I mean if someone is the last person left and they kobe off the hook, their escape was decided by destiny imo
---
That is the essence of Scream and the Ghostface alias.
---
You would be suprised how many people do it for no reason, but in this case they just disagree.
---
100% agreed. I guess my biggest issue is i thought that today was gonna kick everything off, not just announce it.
---
Sure, but what should I do instead of looping? Its the best strategy all around. It's pallet efficient and it helps your teammates in the long run.
---
Tell me what would be equally fun for the survivor and killer
---
Thrilling Tremors looks like it could be useful with NewFreddy's teleport.
---
Mindgames. It brings your Terror Radius to 8-16 Meters depending on the killer (0 for Myers Tier II), so imagine a killer right on you but their heartbeat makes it sound like they're miles away. It makes it hard to tell if the killer *really* abandoned the chase or is still very nearby.
---
I don't think it's the next meta perk, but it's got a useful quirk to it.
---
Pretty standard dbd matchmaking
---
Because he is the only one where survivors abuse the wait time. To save hooked survivors, escape, block hits, and to do gens.
---
My friend said to me . With the other killers . There monsters. But ghostface. You can talk to it .... That's just disturbing
---
Lol you’re really defensive for something you have no stake in. Believe what you want bud. Don’t want you to soil yourself with this obvious internet anger.
---
I don't mean this offensively, and I mean it in the most supportive way possible - If this is your mindset then you need to get away from gaming, and get some help.
---
But to anyone who feels that things like battle passes, season passes, etc are predatory - Yes sometimes they are. EA is an example of how NOT to do it. But realistically, games nowadays cost too much money to make, while making all profit back on a $60 price tag. This is why you get DLC at launch, and things like season passes. The alternative is to sell the game at a higher price, which would cause outrage across the community. Games are not like they were 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago. Games today are not a 'final product'. They are releasing an investment. Something that will get continued support and additional features as time goes on. This used to be exclusive to subscription based games like MMO's, and nobody had a problem with paying for those every month.
---
Do games want to find ways for players to spend money? Of course they do. They are a business, and they want to stay alive and keep people employed. It's how they go about it that determines if they are predatory. This is definitely not. 100% optional, does not affect gameplay in any way, and they are in no way changing how they release their usual content. This is a BONUS FEATURE that you can pay for, just like EVERYTHING ELSE THEY HAVE RELEASED.
---
Its gonna slow the game down for high movement killers.
---
Thanks lol. I was watching ScottJund and he said someone should make a gif of this so that's what I did. So credits to him.
---
I love it!
---
So... bbq and thrilling tremors will definitely be great together because it will completely stop survivors from getting off a gen while killer is hooking to dodge bbq aura reading. Meanwhile, Iron Maiden will becomes even more irrelevant because killers who use it to stop survivors from getting into lockers will get more use out of thrilling tremors
---
Care to explain why? In my experience battle passes have only harmed the games they were implemented in (Fortnite felt like a second job, Black Ops 4 had weapons and specialists in them, Apex was just a slog) along with the fact that they're the worst nightmare for impulse buyers.
---
To me personally there are no positives, so am I a dumbass?
---
Totally because he has a lion tattoo ;)
---
I'd love pride skins for everyone, though I'm sure that would ruffle some feathers among the monochromatic crowd.
---
I agree, should also be a discord emote
---
It's Ghost Face, the mask, not Ghostface, the character from Scream.
---
Are they gonna mention anything about the alpha survivors or white claudette?
---
But most if not all official twitch...es? twitches? usually have the mods deleting a ton of comments anyway, and half the time its just a 'monkey see monkey do' attitude (which is like half of what makes twitch chat)
---
I'm sorry man but this just sounds like a hate filled thread for the sake of hate.
---
What you saw in that twitch chat is identical to any other chat out there on twitch, toxic community or no toxic community.
---
The "battlepass" is only a good thing.
---
It is coming with new lore, more objectives to work towards, and free cosmetics.
---
You people seem to think you have to buy it to use any of it.
---
This is probably one of the best free additions to the game ever. The payed track is just there for those who want extra shit, but you can still get free cosmetics, which is amazing.
---
The devs really outdid themselves with it.
---
The band was the best part...
---
Expected Mat Walker (DBD) and Matt Walker (DMC)
---
I don't know
---
I've been a nice killer normally. Hell I mostly just pls friendly shocky doc or piggy and not attack anything XD
---
Most hag "mindgames" are reactable for the hag, while unreactable for the survivor - &gt; They are not mindgames. Also she has barely any counterplay, unless you brought a flashlight or are running a very well coordinated team that can keep track of all her traps
---
Billy is really easy to counter, you loop him like any other killer and he will never hit you with a chainsaw again, unless you fuck up. Also instadown doesn't equal easy.
---
Hag is a trapper that has map pressure and doesn't suck
---
I watched that this morning
---
Shooting him in the head seems to work in all the movies.
---
Your a fucking hot sack lunch, and a fucking idiot on top of that. It’s funny when you wanna talk about fucking soiling when it seems like you just wanna shit on everything with no reason, don’t respond, you are toxic and honestly just a fucking bore and I’m over it lmao.
---
Was there any mention of a tweak of the emblem system or change for killer adept trophies
---
Doing it isn't toxic, but some of them are OP which is just bad for gameplay.
---
\-16m is actually a pretty big deal. It makes Hag, Pig, and Freddy Tier 1 Myers level stealthy and halves Killers with a normal radius. At full strength it makes a substantial difference.
---
Imagine being me, I just got the game on last free weekend. Jesus, I swear I played free games with less grind.
---
At least you pipped
---
We would still have to wait 3 weeks though.  The anticipation of the unknown can be maintained for months, but the known... I half wish they had waited another two weeks so they could really hype us up.
---
Not really; you teleport to one gen, there are three other gens getting done. Even in the perfect 3-gen situation where he can patrol all three generators, if even two survivors are alive one is being chased and the other is on the gen. And eventually he's going to have to chase because he's going to run out of juice and not be able to teleport for however long.
---
I play both sides as well, and honestly probably slightly more survivor than killer, maybe 60% vs 40%, but the survivor mains as a whole are just so toxic that I barely want to admit that I play survivor. It’s disgusting to me how entitled survivor mains have become, and how willing they are to try and ruin a match with teabagging and other disrespectful acts.
---
At this point I think it should become a f2p game.
---
True enough, Iron Maiden is basically only semi-useful to Huntresses now, maybe Doc.
---
Now that you mention that that could be an interesting aspect to add to the game, cause like Ash has really brief voice lines in game. I wana hear what some of the killers sound like if they try to speak
---
yes gawd
---
Looping itself isn't toxic, however the longer/infinite ones are most definitely utilized the most BY toxic survivors.
---
All his perks are actual garbage.
---
I don't even understand what racism means anymore.
---
Well it's no fun being on a hook :( I think we're onto something
---
Gen teleporting is going to put him in lower top tier imo.
---
&gt; Four seconds gives 20 seconds of expose.
---
Nope. That's got to be nerfed.
---
And here I thought I was just trying not to get camped and slapped on the hook.
---
\#WeNeedSMG
---
😭😭😭😢
---
That would be cool. Like a taunt button on killer.
---
Its map pressure. Why do you think Billy is the second best killer in the game? His power sucks in a chase
---
I never understood it when killers bring up looping. There is literally no other way for survivors to escape you and you think we shouldn't do it. It makes no sense.
---
What’s the perk where you throw a rock maybe that’ll work
---
the mask always belonged to that party supplies company and the mask existed before the scream series did
---
Isn’t it 0 in stalk mode?
---
I’d trust a Bill more than a David
---
I’d replace Monitor with something like Ruin or even Discordance
---
Borrowed Time, DS, Dead Hard, not going for unsafe unhooks, taking a hit to protect the survivor that was unhooked
---
Yes some of those require someone else to make a proper play but it's a team game
---
wait if this was from 20 minutes ago how come the reply to your reply are from  48 minutes ago
---
Omg, claudette has parents, look at baby claudette!!
---
As a Freddy main, I look forward to it.
---
They aren't adding new maps to Springwood, but more substantial variations to Badham Preschool. Kinda kike the Rancid Abattoir can spawn the abattoir either in the center of the map or the top-middle.
---
I like GF's gen-block perk, but BHVR need to start adding perks to combat things Killers find annoying. E.g. a perk that makes footsteps louder when blinded.
---
Problem is Ash and GF arr ultimately getting released 2 months apart. Ash feels more like Chapter 11a, rather than half of Chapter 12.
---
The nerf Haunted Grounds and Tier III EW to then. It’s powerful sure but it’s not unstoppable, and like someone else pointed out, numbers aren’t final
---
I feel like hell be good. Through I was scared at first when they said teleport to gens. I thought he was going to be just spirit but better until they elaborated
---
The party management system sounds amazing, and it might help open the way to cross platform play too!
---
This was overall a great stream and only brought good news, the devs outdid themselves.
---
If you have a 24 meter killer, now it removes 16 so it becomes 8. Someone faults in chase and you see there aura and can mindgame better with those killers. It can be usefull and I believe it will work. Also Piggy can croutch to make it work on loops.
---
I NEED THIS SKIN RIGHT NOW
---
hell if I know, but I don't have fun if I'm running around the same circle 5 times.
---
Yeah, like it doesnt have to be full conversation, but some 1 liners or something could be cool. Maybe a bad comparison but almost like the kill quips in Apex. Imagine if the Trapper came up to you while you're in a bear trap and as he reaches to grab you just says "Got you"
---
The title does not imply that
---
Fucking Nurse and the Doctor :D
---
What'd he say?
---
From what I understood from the stream, he is invisible to people outside his terror radius when they are in the awake state. So any terror radius changing perks should affect the distance he is visible to survivors. People who are awake can ignore his dream world powers.
---
When you are asleep he is 100% visible no matter what, but his dream world powers now affect you.
---
They should give her a resource bar with a blink punish mechanic
---
Hard To Swallow Pills: Twitch chat does not represent the majority of the playerbase.
---
If those markets don't support it and instead want another type of game, I'm sure that's taken into account. 
---
"fail miserably" in those markets only applies if you're expecting to generate revenue in those markets.
---
I honestly hope they never implement a solo only killer queue, it's not healthy for the community imo.
---
Pretty nice
---
Reduces the reaction time of survivors too, since your terror radius will reach them later than before. I got it now :p
---
And there is also a reason why clown is hot trash!
---
Huntress is currently way too map dependent and i doubt the devs are willing to rework like half the maps to make them better for her. Again they can easily nerf some aspects of her but 115% would save them a whole lotta work...
---
Exactly
---
Aww you think I’m hot 💕
---
As someone  Who plays overcharge Freddy, I can't wait to teleport to a Gen. Just so I can kick it faster
---
Looping to survive is obviously not toxic... that’s just dumb. What I’m saying is that survivors who are very experienced know where the certain window spawns are that can be easily and safely looped all three times no matter what or buildings that can easily be traversed many times with balanced landing. There’s a reason the devs are reworking some maps like they said today. Because people are just mindlessly abusing those loops and it doesn’t take much skill. Those loops can’t be mind gamed at all and must be blocked by bamboozle which is a perk that is collectively deemed not fun to use by both sides.
---
While I completely agree, getting a rando as a solo queuer that does any of these things is pretty fuckin' rare sadly.
---
Does quick and quiet counter I’m all ears?
---
What's next, no more windows? It's not fair to the killer that the survivor can escape the line of sight. Damn toxic survivors
---
Its annoying playing as Legion because by the time you hit the 4th survivor the first 2 have already mended themselves and are getting healed.
---
Separate variations is still incredible. 
---
The team tries to design perks that will be good or unique. Having footsteps be louder while blinded is one of the worst perk ideas I’ve heard. It’s terrible and bottom tier. Nobody would run this perk. 
---
Appreciate what you have in the game already. Can’t have your cake and eat it too.
---
Anyone brave enough to have mained Freddy is probably ok with him as is. The only ones clamoring for a Freddy rework are people that want to play him, but don't like how he is now so haven't mained him.
---
My girl didn't fight for her life for 4 freaking movies only to end up being forgotten. I won't allow this.
---
Ranking is getting completely reworked...
---
In early-mid 2020.
---
Bloodlust was added because most pallets could be an infinite.
---
Oh my God I can't. You do you bud
---
-1 for the incredulous wall of text. 
---
Incredible that people are this sensitive over a battle pass that’s cosmetic only.
---
We gonna ignore that this very man swore
---
They showed him teleporting to gens and fading out of visibility. The other concepts arent finished yet, so they couldn't show them, but they did show gameplay of some mechanics.
---
Sorry Chief, the community has already decided shirtless Myers and Bunny Feng. This is really good though!!
---
You still have time to learn current Freddy before the rework and you can be a true freddy main
---
Don't post this on r/gatekeeper
---
Honestly it would change survivor gameplay dramatically.
---
OBVIOUSLY survivors should just run in a straight line and stop moving altogether after being hit once, it’s only fair.
---
Didn't read it? Makes sense.
---
If the survivor didn't know he was coming, that would be game-breaking. It is strong but not insane. However, there may be an add-on that removes this which could become as good as prayer beads.
---
He has a 32 I believe. 
---
His perks aren’t good.
---
Theres a cashier Carl or riot flair and I can't find it?
---
Oh, you meant a real life shop. 
---
With real life stuff there's materials and shipping to consider and also fashion trends come and go. With digital stuff once it's made, it's made. There's no reason for it to go out of stock.
---
As the others have said, the mask does not belong to the movie. Someone wanted to make a movie around the mask and the characters, places, and story they created are part of the movie and they just use the ghost face mask as an identity. So in the case of Dead by Daylight, the reached out to the ghost face people and made a similar deal where they use the ghost face identity but have created their own story of who is behind the mask.
---
I'm not bitching about anything. I'm just saying it's not as good as it sounds on paper.
---
These are the same devs that gave us OG Legion and thought people would actively try to chase down multiple survivors with it.
---
Billys power is great in chase, he can fake his chainsaw to make survivors not drop pallets and can use his chainsaw to also break them faster. Billy can also use his curve to get survivors looping if they are not prepared and to zone survivors.
---
It was when they said about the blood that made me realize it. I thought I was about to get jump scared by freddys
---
Name checks out.
---
People pay a ton just for one high quality skin so I don’t think those same people will be bothered by the price....I’m one of those people.
---
didn't you know? *Every survivor is SWF.*
---
Getting more pallets=nerf
---
Gotta love survivors
---
Is the TR 32 or 24?
---
RemindMe! 1 Month "I'll gladly call you out on that"
---
I know man, I am SOOOOO arrogant I can't believe it lol.
---
I've never even questioned what it was till now, but I always assumed it was a rugby ball.
---
Yeah. Like Apex. That game would be much better with a battle pass.
---
Here’s an idea. Bare with me, it’s crazy. 
---
After seeing how many of us were wrong about the legion rework, myself included. Maybe wait to actually play him.
---
I always forget how shitty stream chats are because I always just watch HybridPanda who has an excellent chat.
---
claudettes father was told tobe John Cena. Thats why we can’t see her.
---
with his rework we found everyone who couldn’t beat the tutorial
---
&gt; This is a killer main sub. 
---
That's why everyone is agreeing with you ...  
---
This sub isn't a killer main sub. Say something like: "MoM is balanced" and people will gift you gold, talk about "Noed being balanced because it has legit counter play" and people will downvote you into oblivion.  
---
This sub is mostly for shitpost and memes, but when it comes to sides there are way more survivors here circle-jerking than there are killers.
---
(But both sides are usually salty and crying)
---
Why wasn’t NO0B there? He’s already in Canada.
---
I agree with what you are saying, and another thing is that a battle pass doesn't really fit the game. Most other battle pass games are battle royals, it doesn't really fit an asymmetrical horror game.
---
Have you seen the politics sub reddit? All it is is drama lol
---
People face camp because they are bad or hell’a mad taking their anger out on people. It ruins the game for everyone making everyone mad. How is my statement hypocritical lol
---
we actually think about how fucking hilarious it's gonna be when we mori you for being a dick or a twitch streamer but close enough otherwise
---
You're probably one of the ones who call face camping a legit strat
---
Then instead of complaints about DCs or tunneling and camping, cheating will be rampant.
---
*RELEASE THE PIG SKINS*
---
Probably because the collective internet just thinks you have a stick up your butt. I get where you're getting at but it is just an internet meme which involved the op finding two pictures on the internet and slapped them together. They likely did the same thing I did and did a google imagine search and used the picture, the op might not even know its an actual product that someone is selling.
---
honestly just stop being poor
---
People are allowed; but to act shocked and abhorred is just attention seeking.
---
Agreed.
---
It looks cool 👌
---
Literally no killer is gonna want to face a 4man unless they're a god nurse. Terrible idea, it'll split the community.
---
... I can tell this is going to be required, so RemindMe! 3 Months "Sing the I Was Right Song."
---
It seems like it, but stay with me here.
---
What if the reduced tr in chase isn't for the survivor you're chasing...but the ones you aren't?
---
Think about it:  you start a chase and you alert anybody around that "hey, I'm about to stick my knife up somebody ass" and they tend to clear out, right?
---
Generally, when a survivor is being chased, everyone in the area can hear the tr music and tend to be more careful.  Obviously the survivor you're chasing knows you're here, but for everyone else, he's just running to help out with a gen or something, at least that's what you think until you're caught slipping by a chainsaw wielding texan with a hankering for Chili.
---
That one chase that would've cleared the area out or put people on high alert, now has 3 other people sitting pretty nonthe wiser.
---
It would probably just make the blood not appear until the last 2 seconds of the channel. Being able to show up at a generator with no warning would make it the most broken addon in the game.
---
It's likely that either one of rhe red ranks (or both) are SWF with the Rank 16.
---
Disgusting. Every damn time. I actually have missed the last 4 Double BP events in a row because I am out of town during them. I never leave town. Those were the only times, and they were freak accidents that I did. It has been over  a year since I have gotten to participate in one.
---
And I will be out of town from June 15th to June 18th.
---
We really need to get this new format to the top cause its the best. It captures  Mathieu perfectly.
---
Yeah exactly that, she follows it up with talking about other parts of the stream so it seems like she's saying we'd get exclusive items from the stream but I didn't see any.

Great, the week I’ll be on vacation without internet access. This happens every time!
---
use stealth perks while the killer is on your ass bloodlusting you? what the fuck are you talking about?
---
Ok, thank you for the reasonable reply. I'm going to use this to clarify someone for everyone else, my argument is that Microtransactions in general are bad and that it makes no difference what game it is, microtransactions are just scummy.
---
You don't like being looped around windows that are frankly silly amounts of safe?
---

Then you would know lmao
---
the most expensive dlc ever, must be paid in 2 installments
---
New meme?
---
Are you hearing yourself? Escaping line of sight is what survivors are supposed to do.
---
Do you want a perk where the killer can know where all survivors are 100% of the time? 
---
Killer is still faster and will always catch up to a survivor eventually. Escaping LOS is part of the game. That’s your fault for not being able to track a survivor
---
Something to the extent of "No one wants a fucking battlepass".
---
By the way,
---
Good job editing your comment and adding the statements after “makes sense”.  
---
Your original comment was “Didn’t read it? Makes sense”. The edit button isn’t supposed to add in an entire point after someone makes another comment.
---
That's exactly what/who ghostface is...... lmao
---
He'll be able to always hit survivors now right? So I don't think survivors being able to wake up easier will really matter much at all?
---
Name: The Ting
---
Too bad its not about the movies.
---
The one perk is on a cool down, so anyone triggering it from anywhere else on the map ruins this.
---
They weren't very clear so it was not easy to lock info. 
---
Any skillchecks? So successfull skillchecks also? I would swear I heard him say there were 2 ways to wake up, other survivors and the clock. But if you re-checked maybe I brainfarted, which is not uncommon
---
Only when his Night Shroud power is active (this is also the same power that deletes his red stain, it's not active 24/7). And even when in Night Shroud mode he still emits a sound to let the survivors know he's around as stated by the devs in the anniversary stream.
---
So nurse followed by billy and spirit are the top 3. I personally think Freddy will be right behind these. The gen teleporting by itself is massive, and allows him to pressure everywhere. The pallet tricks along with the snare are bonuses that will help prevent him from getting looped too much.
---
It’s all speculation, but when I think about a tier list and what makes a character top tier or not, Freddy is now hitting all categories for the most part
---
I have, for about 1000 hours. A man needs new stuff.
---
I was wrong about legion too. I thought he'd be more fun to go against and play but instead he's still a pain in the arse to go against and he's significantly less fun to play.
---
If 'oopsie' was in the dictionary, this would be the related pic

It's just cosmetics. Dont buy it. I think the current cosmetics are overpriced so I dont buy them. But I appreciate some people care more and they should be able to buy if they want
---
Aww fetus Claudette. I’m really excited for the Archives!
---
*Laughs in Prayer Beads*
---
If the killer comes from the pallet at killer shack, you run down the stairs from the top and crouch just near the top so the killer thinks you went all the way down, the killer jumps off the ledge of the stairs and lands at the bottom while you are still at the top, insuring a free window vault
---
It is silly, but the Survivor isn't at fault for doing it. Can't exactly expect them to give up or go to a worse loop out of the kindness of their heart. If it's in the game they're well within reason to use it. Which is why they're now being removed from the game.
---
Literally everything in Warframe is a job, and pretty much everything in the game is free. 
---
Really bad comparison.
---
Not to mention, that's why a lot of people like Warframe. You can turn your brain off and just grind for shit.
---
Legion Chara? :thinking:
---
I was in the process of making it when the reply happened, I forgot to add that point in there so I fixed my error, there's no need to get pissy because I forgot to sum up my entire post because the guy didn't fucking understand.
---
well it kind of does, indirectly
---
Now this, this is epic
---
In F2P games they are ok in my opinion, the games need to make some money, and it is a very efficient way to do so. I am however glad we know what we are getting with the battle pass, lootboxes would have been so much worse.
---
Weren't the legion taken in the 80s or something? They're definitely from the past, so they might have disappeared before Scream even came out. Also, lore wise they're more interested in being assholes, than they are in anything like movies.
---
Also also, the ghostface we're getting is a license from funword, the owners of the mask design and not the company that made the movies, which means, that our ghostface isn't related to the ghostfaces from the scream movies.
---
Real. It's on the new roadmap.
---
OINK
---
Wait, why are they reworking Badham Preschool first? I feel that map isn't that bad compared to the likes of Lampkin Lane.
---
100% disagree. 
---
The DC rate has gone down by about 40% (according to the developer who changed legion, Almo). This is a phenomenal change in terms of DC rate. 
---
He is significantly less annoying to play against to most and much better to play. No longer do you just feral frenzy forever and run after survivor. Now you have to actually make choices after you hit them.
---
The music band was dope. Can you add them in the camp fire in lobbies ? thanks you in advance
---
I am just glad you didn't say 2+2=4-1=3
---
Can't wait for the Freddy paragraph
---
Let me just get trashed on stream and call all my viewers nobodies that dont know shit, and then 5 minutes later talk about how much I value my subs
---
Did they specify date and what is tje change? Lmao that'd be 4th anniversary already
---
I’m nervous about it sure we may be getting more pallets but are these pallets very unsafe? Can the killer just bloodlust to victory? A lot of questions and not many answers
---
I'm excited about it, but I do hope I look at it and know that it's worth it.
---
You betcha, playing both at rank 3 isn’t that bad. I can usually get a 4K if I run my anti loop builds
---
I don’t disagree and picked up on this as well. 
---
That being said, if we get a little less DLC content in exchange for real work on the server side of things, I’ll accept.
---
For survivor: Don't die
---
For killer: Go stabby stabby to everyone
---
I have the same definition. But killers don't seem to get our frustration too. It sucks when they ignore everyone else to just go after you even tho they were already in a chase with someone amd they took a hit. Im not just running towards them so they go out of their chase to just to come back to me or another person they are tunneling. Like if im unhooking someone and taking a hit for them as well just go for me right? Leave the unhooked guy alone I'm much easier to get at that point. Also some killers move like 3 seconds around your hook claiming that they were not camping. If you are still visible to me when Im hooked and hell visible when there are so many objects to block my vision then you aren't not camping. If you come back three seconds after and check around the hook for ten seconds and do the same thing again for more than necessary and not even go for the people who come to check the hook until I die first hook then there is something wrong with this.
---
No. Its going to be free
---
I believe if you are fully asleep (which will now happen passively over time) he will still be able to see your aura outside of his terror radius and you will also be susceptible to running into his fake pallets and snares, which won’t happen if you are awake.
---
People are also forgetting they will probably keep hack shack and God pallet the same as a high risk high reward spot. Good pallet and window. But possibility of basement hook.
---
Still, Billy gets looped like every other killer. The main thing is how much pressure he has, which is what Freddy will get.
---
Still playing old Freddy, trying to get as much out of him before mid chapter comes out
---
This new perk ... seems like a worse Surveillance.
---
Don't go through with the battle pass. This is infinitely better in every way and I want more of this
---
Trust us. We all saw the roadmap that has been posted 40 times.
---
Not sure if this is the very first mention of it, perhaps it was discussed on a livestream somewhere but The Archive was just showcased on [year 4 diary video] (https://youtu.be/HOtNQ60QaB8).
---
Definitely my most anticipated part. Though, I do worry that it could be more of a "we have this idea" and on release it'll only trickle the lore out, as opposed to every single character getting a hefty chunk of lore and cinematics.
---
... *thanks*
---
Is it like part of the game as in free or something you pay for. I missed the stream
---
In a chase... That's so useless.  
---
If it were out of chase, it would've been a decent perk imo.
---
Everyone is toxic lol you’ll run into face campers, tunnelers, pallet looping survivors, teabagging survivors in so much more.... But if your survivor run Borrowed time and Self care. If you’re a killer get leather face and level up to get bbq and chilly and run hex ruin
---
It's bullshit, I agree, but it's unreasonable to expect people not to use it. Hence why I'm glad it's changing.
---
This. I fucking hate this. They give me a sense of false hope when they stick around the hook but instead they watch me die while they could be doing things more productive. It’s so annoying.
---
 [https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/add-carl-to-dead-by-daylight](https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/add-carl-to-dead-by-daylight)
---
Looks to be a new section of the main menu, that you'll enter like a bloodweb, choosing challenges that offer different rewards.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't Leather Face referred to as a paragraph?
---
You need all your team to not cleanse.  
---
The moment anyone cleanses, cleanse as well.
---
That sounds really good. Bout time we got something other than cosmetics tbh
---
I love not_queen so much
---
Objectively, legion and Freddy are the only killers who can’t down with their power. This is true. In most situations, he is not alone. 
---
Against decent players, you rarely/never use their power to down survivors with these killers: Wraith, Trapper in most scenarios, Pig, Billy/LF if they’re injured, Doctor, Clown in a sense, plague if they don’t cleanse. 
---
In a power form, this is why he was given a 5% move speed increase — to finish the job.
---
what a great observation
---
I would be thrilled if that were the case, but unfortunately exclusives are what sell battle passes. The limited availability makes our brains crave it and forces people to buy something they don't even want just because they don't want to "miss out".
---
As long as you can loop her then don't worry about getting infected. You shouldn't cleanse against Plague unless you're out of pallets. Keeping her from using her power just makes her a plain M1 killer which is easier to work with imo.
---
They got the license for the mask and only the mask. It's unknown why. Since they have only the mask they can't do a survivor
---
is there a reason for this? ty for the reply :)
---
Oh you'll enjoy hexy then!! Hes such a toxic funny asshole... his chat shits on him sometimes and he just laughs and argues with them.  Check him out one day and let me know what ya think... he plays more than dbd, but catch him on a dbd day. He will having you laughing your ass off.. the things that go in chat... smh hahah
---
According to the roadmap, it'll be in Ghostface's mid-chapter patch.
---
I'm still honestly fine with it, we still have our jungle gyms for now
---
To the place?
---
Not to mention, long term challenges and more lore/cutscenes.
---
... I don't know what the other half of that means, but I play rainbow six. I face toxic players on a daily, so nothing new to me.
---
They are launching a mobile game, how would they not be expecting to generate revenue in the Asian market? The largest mobile market in the world.
---
It's a surveillance that acts differently. It works when a survivor enters a dying state. All generators that are not being worked on are then blocked for 16 seconds and turn white.
---
I don’t see them as similar enough to warrant them having copied you. Theirs makes no mention of increasing aura reading range, for example, and that’s a significant effect. 
---
Also it’s just bound to happen where people are gonna make designs that are similar to other designs. Doesn’t mean they’re copied.
---
If you want to spend actual money and buy killers, buy myers, pig, and leatherface. Everyone else you can buy with shards which you get for playing the game. Leatherface has the best perk for killers which you can unlock for all killers by leveling him up.
---
ahh i didnt think about this ty ;p
---
&gt;But realistically, games nowadays cost too much money to make
---
This is a common misconception I see every once in a while. I'm not 100% sure in BHVR's case, but usually, this extra money doesn't go into the pockets of developers. The game makes enough money on it's own and all the extra's go into the pockets of executives.
---
&gt;If this is your mindset then you need to get away from gaming, and get some help.
---
I am already getting help for this, but this is something that can't just be fixed. It's an ongoing process. I've already had to step away from other games because of this problem and I'd hate to add DBD on this list.
---
&gt;Do games want to find ways for players to spend money? Of course they do. They are a business
---
Indeed, and in a business they try to find new ways to get more money
---
&gt;and they want to stay alive and keep people employed.
---
Like adressed before, the employees keep their normal fee, it's the executives that get the extra money
---
&gt;This is a BONUS FEATURE that you can pay for, just like EVERYTHING ELSE THEY HAVE RELEASED.
---
People keep saying this, but you can add these things without a predatory system. I'd rather have lootboxes because at least then people see that it is mentaly manipulating.
---
And to the rest of your comment: games might get bigger, but the budget doesn't really increase. The games get better, but so do the tools that help creating the games.
---
I hope we get silent hill and pinhead in Year 4.
---
I mean, its great that there's actually room for counterplay at loops for both sides but... bloodlust still exists and kinda removes that need to counterplay/ actually outskill the survivors so they should change/ delete that mechanic since it   can't be used for its original purpose after a few updates because infinites and very strong loops won't exist anymore
---
Dead by Daylight only have rights to use the name and mask of Ghostface. His lore is entirely different in Dbd. He is not the same killer as in any of the movies. So he’s like a half licensed killer.
---
BAM, the finger guns
---
It might seem hard at first since you dont have map knowledge or all perks but keep on playing. It gets easier and more enjoyable.
---
Don’t get frustrated. It’s a little overwhelming at first, and sometimes you might get paired up against someone who’s way better than you, but just learn from the experience and keep going. I almost gave up on the game my first week because I kept getting high ranked survivors and I couldn’t catch anyone. But now I’m a high rank myself and I’m so happy I persisted.
---
Yeah. You're right. Sorry if I've been snappy, all the battlepass talk has me worried about my future enjoyment of the game and so it's brought out a lot of negativity from me. 
---
I still love my stabby teens, I just miss my speed sometimes.
---
Chapters are "every 3 months".
---
Chapter 12 (Ghostface) is June. That means Chapter 13 is September.
---
They also said the Freddy rework is coming "in the next mid-chapter patch". Based on the graphic, archive/rift is coming in the mid-chapter patch for Chapter 13.
---
Mid-chapter patches are usually 6 weeks after a Chapter. That means archive/rift is coming in October.
---
Which is 4 months away...
---
My bad. It *is 11pm, here.
---
pinhead would be pretty dope
---
Some generators are close together so you can go to the one that is unoccupied, for example by running Discordance or Surveillance
---
I’d forgive a shirtless Kate or Amanda for butt dancing at a pallet
---
Devs being devs, they don't wanna make strong killers, so you can bet your ass
---
If I’m not wrong, I believe the changes are ONLY coming on the reworks. 
---
So every place that isn’t badham will still have some really good loops. 
---
Who knows, some of the other obstacles near the loops could punish killers for making a wrong read. And we still aren’t certain on how much they’re cutting the safest of loops by.
---
God I can’t wait. I don’t bother ever chasing in that house cause it’s such a bitch
---
Freddy buff (aka total rework but still buff)
---
Nerf: Many pallet tiles becoming much smaller.
---
Also said 'abusive' windows will be reworked, so could also be referring to jungle gyms.
---
top 10 photos taken before disaster
---
SlightlyXotic, I’m a rank 9/10 survivor and a rank 9/10 killer. I’m up for playing. Solo queue is aids lol
---
But whenever it happens, it's like God heard your prayers
---
Freddy with Discordance is gonna be nasty
---
When I saw that on stream, I knew it was going to be a meme
---
If everything in the pass is available after the season is over, I'm fine with it. My problem is that every battlepass in a game so far has had exclusive stuff that if you miss (maybe you take a break or simply are too busy) is gone forever.
---
&gt; If the Teleport is going to be useful at all, it's to be able to hop across the map after checking the generators on one side; mobility, not a surprise tool.
---
I haven't seen any of that actually thinks the teleport should be good for surprises, it's all about the mobility. 
---
And on your complaints about the dream traps, I think it's wrong to hold them up against hag and trapper, I think much more appropriate is a clown comparison. Being able to put dream traps to fuck over troublesome loops and force survivors away while in the chase like clown can do to shut down loops seems like a much better and more intended use rather than placing them all over the map well in advance like hags or trappers.
---
I think overall you are jumping into these rework details of 'how is this actually weak or bad' and it's tinting your overall view.
---
Billy, Steve, Mrs. Loomis, Mickey, Roman (Angelina in alternate ending), Jill, Charlie...and whoever the hell was in the TV series (I didn't watch it).
---
Ghostface has literally always been some random asshole in a mask. The entire plot of scream is psychos that used Horror movies as motivation for their killings. Granted, most of them WERE tied to Sydney, but the partners weren't. Just Horror fans that got off on stabby stabbin. I just consider this the 'latest' Ghostface.
---
Oh how I miss it :( I wish there was a way to play both
---
I’m hoping they are doing Badham before Haddonfield just to keep with the theme of Freddy improvements
---
It's not about guessing where you're going. It's about having half a brain to figure out that a Survivor moving at 100% speed can have only gone so far in a certain amount of time. If you lose line of sight, your search area is pretty much within 10 square meters. Mindgames are one thing, but it's physically impossible for a Survivor to travel outside of a certain area within seconds. So a Killer will logically search that area and unless they're blind they'll find the Survivor. This is why playing DbD like tag instead of hide n go seek has always been the better strategy.
---
Which one lets you get away from doc when his illusions pop up?
---
This is what tunneling is, this is the bullshit people reject that they do :( David you are an amazimg teammate for taking a hit even when you were injured, I do that too if someone is getting tunneled, but in the end they die and I survive cuz the killer ignores me.
---
Ok i will send you a friend request. Nice. I just do supper then i go on. In like 20-30 minutes max.
---
A good killer negates most of them
---
People hated it because they exaggerated how much work it actually was and have a ridiculous fear of missing out.
---
They said - multiple times - that nothing in the Nightwave was exclusive to Nightwave.
---
The community proved - multiple times - that you could obtain the maximum rank with minimal "Elite Weeklies". The non-elites were literally things like "play 3 missions" or "kill 200 enemies".
---
People hated it for literally 0 good reasons, just pure entitlement.
---
In anycase they got what they wanted and season 2 of Nightwave has less missions, a catchup system and other things to make it basically just free stuff for anyone who plays a couple hours every couple weeks.
---
A battle pass in my paid game that also has paid DLC and has been making the slowest progress possible towards fixing actual issues that the game has? Yeah fuck that. I ain't supporting this sort of business practice.
---
Are you joking? Looping is toxic now?
---
Mhm! Just like the other comment said, if your whole team doesn't cleanse then she is rendered powerless. But if someone else cleanses and you hear her drink from a pool then you should cleanse as well or just hide until her power runs out. Hope it helps!
---
a non licensed killer would be cool like for example a vampire or a werewolf with powers.
---
BaTtAle PaSs iS lIt :LaUgHiNG fAcE:
---
Sidney = Didn't have the rights to use any of the actual characters or story from the original series. Only had rights to mask and name Ghost Face.
---
Nancy = Never truly explained but its speculated that it was speculated that it was because Quentin was a character created for the movie instead of a character that was rewritten. So it was either that Quentin was the most financially viable one or they had a conflict due to Mara's likeness.
---
3-Gen Dr. Worldwide = nearly impossible for survivors.
---
The goal is to spread the "power budget" across the map. This can also help survivors because now if a strong pallet goes down they are not immediately fucked in that part of the map
---
The saying is true you can’t please everyone
---
ahhh okay ty ill remember that :D
---
Yeah I’m all for improving the server and stability.
---
He now has absolutely insane map presence, and people seem to be forgetting that you still see the auras of survivors in the dreamworld, which makes it even easier to find survivors. The pallets and snares are also a nice way to make him not suck in a chase. You may not like the change, but it's much more viable than current freddy.
---
are you on ps4?
---
He’s winston
---
I'd have loved to play as Sidney tbh but it's good we're even getting ghostface in dead by daylight.
---
Try restarting the game
---
&gt;It is coming with new lore
---
It's linked to the lore, it is not part of the lore
---
&gt;The payed track is just there for those who want extra shit
---
It's this part that people don't seem to realise what is going on. Battlepasses tend to mentally manipulate you by placint a time limit and showing you what rewards you could get if you just spend some cash. These things are a nightmare for compulsive spenders since these things are made to prey on them.
---
As a side note: It frustrates me that them adding a free path negated backlash for them. I feel like they added it so people wouldn't reviewbomb the game. And, well, looks like it worked pretty well. I think I hot like 30 comments that say "yo bro y u angry for free stuff" and "paying is optional"
---
Did you try restarting the game?
---
It's not, but some people have very fragile egos.
---
They actually do reward you for playing daily in the game right now. You get an extra 300 xp for playing your first match as each role of the day. In the long run, this adds up to bloodpoints, perks, or cosmetics in the form of iri shards.
---
I hope so, otherwise freddy will only be mid teir.
---
It's hypocritical because you are saying people that face camp take the game too seriously, aren't you also taking the game too seriously by giving a shit if someone face camps you? It's just a game after all. What I'm trying to say is that mentality of saying someone is taking something too seriously is fundamentally flawed since you could just use it for anything.
---
What are you on about man, We only get chapters every 3 Months anyway. This and the Leatherface chapter are the only chapters to not have a map and survivor. So it’s not “What happened to full chapters?”.
---
Well as the survivor, you're just trying to survive sooo yeah
---
Well at that point what would even be the point of a battlepass? Why work for it when you could just wait and buy it?
---
Okay, well Evil Within which takes remarkably longer than 4 seconds is not really the same situation.
---
Let’s talk about what the mods thought was a bannable offense. Mention Puppers, Monto, or Noob? Timed out. But they can name drop the man baby Pug and have Vincent up there?
---
I had this problem when I got Freddy restart the game and wait a bit that's how I fixed it
---
I've worked on 3 separate games and my boyfriend has been a Producer in games for the past 10 years. There's no misconceptions. 
---
You just have twisted misconceptions that everyone's out to get you because some companies have scorned you.
---
bUt FaCEcamPing iS a LeGiT sTraT
---
He will have the best map pressure and it will be impossible to split his gens!
---
You’re fine. Don’t stress about it. It’s only cosmetic and you don’t have to buy it.
---
He's getting the pressure of a toilet compared to the fire hose that Billy has.
---
Freddy Pressures the gens.
---
Billy can literally be anywhere he wants fast. 
---
If a survivor gets unhooked, Billy can rev his saw and run to it, while being able to turn to the sides, stop short, or keep going. Billy can also snipe an insta-down on his way there as well.
---
If a Survivor gets unhooked, Freddy can teleport to a gen that's close by, walk over at normal speed, and then hit the survivor once (if injured) or twice (if healthy).
---
Even if you are generous and say that Billy's Saw takes 5 seconds to rev, it takes 5 seconds to rev to **get to where you want to go**. Freddy will take 5 seconds to **get to up to seven points on the map**. With BBQ, Billy can run to where they are, while Freddy either has to teleport to the closet generator to where they are going hoping they're dumb enough to keep going the same way, or teleport to where they were and hope they don't notice that the gen is spitting blood.
---
And all of that is not even counting the fact that Billy can ignore problematic perks like Mettle of Man simply because his chainsaw doesn't grant charges and can go from Healthy -&gt; Dying.
---
You can usually tell by how they look too, if they are open they are for saboing, if they are closed (i mean the cover) then they are for gens but brown and yellow toolboxes are for both.
---
The best advice I can give you is that when you first start it's kind of grindy. You start with only one perk slot but once you hit level 15 you have all four unlocked. Don't get upset if you don't do good the first few games be patient. You'll get the hang of it! It's a really fun game once you get the hang of it. Good luck in the fog!!
---
That's an extremely specific thing
---
To avoid snares/fake pallets, I’d imagine. I’m not exactly sure, they’ll likely go into more detail at another date.
---
Well if you look at year timeline we have another chapter with no map which makes me believe another licensed solo killer . So that’s only two new survivors and maps this year
---
I took part in that
---
The time the killer spends looking for you can then be used to close the distance to a different area with pallets, of which there will be more because the pallet power budget will be more evenly spread out across the map
---
What games? Unless they are well known games, what I said doesn't hold up
---
They made clones of every character so far
---
Trapper/Hag
---
Nurse/Spirit
---
Huntress/Clown
---
Doc/Freddy
---
Billy/Bubba 
---
Etc. I don't see why these would make the other obsolete.
---
I think they said they will "change" looping in general by adding more mindgame potential to pallets and perhaps having more of them and they only used Badham as an example but im not 100% sure. Even then, bloodlust would still be overkill with the strong/infinite windows removed.
---
On the flip side Shelter Woods is a living hell to be sent to now. There are like 6 pallets and all the generators can spawn really close together.
---
Same concept still applies, you’re right in front of the killer when they can expose you, and if you’re like most Myers you build tier 2 until all you need is a tap to tier up again. It’s almost guaranteed that numbers will change, but one second is too short to disable the power
---
Yes I am.
---
My hope is that everything in the pass will either be already available or available in the store after the season is over.
---
If neither of those happen, I might end up leaving the game like I did Fortnite, Apex and Black ops.
---
Weebs HyperDansGame
---
Yes twice and the PS4 once.
---
Right but the current existing problems around survivors ease of waking up is all about how long it takes for Freddy to be able to hit them again. 
---
With the rework, survivors will be able to wake up easier.. but it'll only effect those further aspects of his power, instead of making him unable to attack. Get what I mean? Even though survivors will be able to wake up easier, there's less reward for doing so because Freddy is still an immediate threat upon chase start
---
Sounds interesting! Did they say when they were going to implement it?
---
They did talk about Nancy on a previous dev stream. They only had access to the remake obviously, but they didn’t really like remake Nancy compared to the original and thought Quentin was a more interesting character so they chose him instead.
---
WassszzzUuup
---
Restarted the game twice and the PS4 once so far.
---
I thought the same thing, I am still convinced that leatherface is bill's killer
---
They’re adding in a revamped quest system with better rewards. chill.
---
Baby claudy
---
So, Chapter 14 won't come with a new map... That must mean that it's just like this Ghostface chapter with a single killer or survivor who is licensed right? Also dedicated servers aren't planned to go live until chapter 13, which will be September, but they promised they'd go live in "Summer 2019", but as we all know, September is the first month of Fall... *Sigh*... another 3 months of putting up with the DC epidemic I guess.
---
The devs started calling it that for lore reasons. Don’t blame the community for following what they said.
---
The learning curve is steep initially and the game is a grind. That being said, it’s lots of fun and imo, only gets more fun the more the play. 
---
As a survivor, I recommend starting with Dwight (with his perk Bond especially!) or Feng to get an idea of the game. Claudette and Meg are also popular choices. Either way, take your time learning the layouts of maps, understanding the bloodweb and leveling system, and try to be a team player. More often than not, a bold approach will be more successful than an immersive one. There are many many perks in the game so play around with them, and don’t hesitate to see what your fellow players are using after matches, for inspiration. It will be overwhelming but patience will reward you if you can handle it.
---
As a killer, they are all pretty different. I recommend several games with each one to see what playstyle you enjoy. A bad game with the Trapper for example doesn’t necessarily mean he’s a bad fit for you, so experiment with several matches. Don’t be afraid to let survivors unhook their teammates. It typically means more points for you in the end and ultimately gives you the true experience of the game. When people are talking about toxic players, they are often referring to killers who play in a way that makes survivors miserable. Survivors can be toxic as well, but generally when you start, you should hopefully avoid much of that for a bit. You’ll be playing with fellow new players for some time, so just try not to take any of it too seriously as everyone’s just trying to take it all in and understand it. 
---
Welcome to the Fog! (:
---
If you play for fun keep playing who you like, leatherface is a weaker killer of billy but I enjoy playing him.
---
He has to waste time setting up those pallets/snares which may not even be that helpful in the chase. The gen teleporting is nice, but the fact that sleep is passive, and you can wake up using alarm clocks PLUS the fact that his stall is gone makes me very angry. I don't know whether he'll be more viable (I don't consider current Freddy to be low tier) but I don't like the change of playstyle.
---
I dont believe so, they just mentioned it.
---
Ok, so first off, gen teleporting sounds awesome, but 5 seconds with lots of visual warning means it basically gives survivors a full sprint burst away and whatever exhaustion they have on top of that.
---
Second, to do anything beyond being an M1 killer in a chase, I'm reliant on Dream Abilities to slow or trick survivors. Sure. BUT I have no actual way to force a survivor to sleep. It's just luck if I find a sleeping survivor, or if they fall asleep in a chase. It'd be like Plague having to wait for survivors to catch a cold rather than being able to infect them. Dream snares had better not be add ons only, as your whole power being fake pallets would be garbage, it so rarely matters with Doctor's add ons already.
---
It sounds decent to start with, but there's some big issues overall.
---
Fake pallets, being slowed...
---
Oh and literally being tracked by auras
---
#this is why eSports will never hit the general public as hard as for instance soccer. The way you kids are spamming this chat is just ruining the whole experience for a grown man. Seriously. Grow up
---
Summer which starts late june and ends in late September.
---
Wait. Does Freddy have the ability to *hit* other survivors?
---
Oh. My. God.
---
Disappointed. He's just a copy of Wraith now. Uninstalling.
---
I am psyched about this. As someone whose only real grind is left is to P3 everyone (no thanks, lol), I’m looking forward to new objectives and challenges.
---
What’s the archive and rift??
---
Single characters are still chapters? There isn't such thing as "full chapters", some just come with more content (survivor &amp; map or killer &amp; map) than others.
---
Borrowed Time and Self Care are survivor perks. Each survivor has three perks that they can "teach" to other survivors. Once unlocked at a certain level they pop up in all other survivors bloodweb. (Its exactly the same for killers btw.) I will say if you're going to play survivor solo I would suggest playing Claudette first. Her perk self care (it let's you heal yourself without an item) is a must when you first start!
---
Hmm, I'm Xbox so maybe this is a PS4 thing. I suggest calling support or something if it doesn't fix itself.
---
He does a majority of his videos between Rank 5 and 1. He does the meme builds around reset because survivors will actually play into them. Who wants to watch a video of something like Burger King Myers against a group that knows he can't catch them? Meanwhile everyone asks for the build.   
---
You can almost time his builds around how close to reset it is. Like Scratched Mirror being between the 14-18th and Russian Roulette later in the month.
---
I was going to be witty and make a rebuttal from Team B but I'm not in a goofy enough mood to make it funny. :P
---
He's not going to be a Billy or Nurse or Spirit, so.. yeah, few weeks of novelty and he's dead content.
---
I'm in your same boat. Freddy will be missed.
---
It's all fun and games until someone actually tries to fix broken shit, then all hell breaks loose.
---
Tbh they never follow that road map dead on. They said it themselves “plans change”. They didn’t do everything they promised this year but they make up for it in other ways such as Ash or Endgame Collapse. So don’t moan about it until happens or is announced again
---
More pallets need mindgame potential. 
---
Bloodlust matters on super unsafe pallets. In other situations, the killer just wastes time to eventually get you. I doubt they’ll remove all good loops in every map.
---
they are adding more pallets they are just no longer as safe as they were how is this a nerf, they are just fixing a design issue and add compensation, now you have more pallets on each map but they arent op af
---
I've gotta agree with RuneRobin, that is just normal twitch chat. 90% of deleted messages were probably just an auto mod that was deleting emote spam.
---
Well, it is at certain times. 
---
There ARE points in the match where a killer may need to camp as their optimal play.
---
PTB for Ghostface and any other updates starts on the 4th June. Ghostface and the new updates, whatever they may be, will be out on the 18th. The Anniversary Event will start on the 18th too. No word on what it will be yet.
---
Yamaoka is terrible for survivors unless you play immersed. I absolutely hate it as killer cuz survivors can just hide in bamboo and be invisible
---
A mobile version? I wonder how well that will run.
---
Also what's an archive and a rift?

---
I mean to be fair most of the time I pop in here I see Killer Mains bitching alongside Survivor Mains which just degrades into personal attacks.
---
It sucks on both sides. People suck on both sides. Either stick around and be the change you want to be or peace out; your only options are change or accept it.
---
Doubt it. Who knows how much this Battle Pass will cost. 
---
Why spend $10 on a store outfit when you can spend $10 for a battle pass with a ton of outfits? 
---
Can’t be negative like this. If cosmetics make you leave games, that’s on you.
---
I wish it came out for free like it did on PS4. Non of my friends have game pass and I can’t convince any of my friends to buy it
---
They already made multiple killers for looping, reduced the pallets on the map, added multiple perks to counter looping, bloodlust, added new lunge mechanics, and there's a red stain exploit for easy hits through pallets.
---
Her corrupt purge that she obtains from survivors cleansing is honestly her only real threat, as it can quickly chain-hit multiple people with little skill. By not cleansing excessively, she cannot use it and basically “reduced” to a M1 killer.
---
Face camping is literally the worst thing you can do nowadays. Decisive strike, kindred, borrowed time, people stacking MoM baiting hits while you camp... it just ensures an even more embarrassing defeat
---
Doc/Freddy?
---
Why are these similar?
---
According to the Year 4 Roadmap, it will be implemented during 2020 at some point.
---
I thought they don‘t change the amount of pallets, just place the safe pallets to unseres places.
---
Still not really a fan of battlepasses. But, hopefully the free track is worth doing, I don't really care for buying a pass only to not have enough time because of RL to grind for the thing I bought it for
---
I'll help you out: Try involving Hitler in some way, and add in that you play both sides so you know what you are talking about. Perhaps a comment belittling a certain race/gender/orientation to really add the cherry on top.
---
Games pass en is like $1 for 3 months i believe
---
Wait, do people really think cosmetics are pay 2 win?
---
I said "Freddy Rework HYPE" and it was instantly removed for having Caps lmao
---
I mean. Said outfit you want might've been in a previous season and completely unavailable now and you didn't realise because (like many people do with this game) you took a break 
---
The only reason I have hope is that the event items are still available to this day
---
This seems like it might be horribly broken with the gen teleport
---
Can anyone say the time where Ghostface popped out of the locker?
---
The amount of people on twitch chat chanting it was honestly disturbing .-.
---
* Generator Teleport: Freddy no longer targets survivors with his tagging ability, but generators - he can disappear and materialize beside the selected generator. From the survivors perspective, he disappears, blood start spurting from the generator, and Freddy slowly transpires from thin air beside the gen. This ability has a cooldown, and is represented by a power bar similar to Spirit and Legion.
---
Holy fucking shit. That's awesome.
---
Ah nice. Knowing them though they still won’t buy it the right bastards
---
Survivors can stay ahead of the killer with obstacles though. Bloodlust made more sense in the days when most maps had loops that could be run for absurd amounts of time.
---
You can't stalk as Ghostface if the survivors are looking at you.
---
So surviving is toxic ig
---
I'm not saying hes better then Billy. I'm saying dont underestime how good it is. We also dont know the range and cooldown of it, not to mention the other parts he gets out of it.
---
He teleports to lockers.
---
mobile leaks??
---
He ate all the Escape cakes I see
---
My only guess is the interactions of their terror radius, where Doc makes you go crazy Freddy puts you to sleep. But even that's not incredibly similar. Though I guess it could be new Freddy which I know nothing about.
---
How is GF better then either of them? He cant slow the game down or get a hit as easy as Pig, and he can only expose one person at a time unlike Myers. Not to mention mysers will always have a lower TR
---
Well played sir
---
Cussing someone out is definitely toxic. Pressing one button a couple times is not.
---
wait does struggle/wiggle actually go faster if you macro it?
---
If the rank rework turns out well I hope there can eventually be rank rewards and levels/devotion rewards.
---
Don't do this btw its toxic and holds the game hostage and isn't fun for both sides.
---
And facecamping is used by "toxic" killers. So what?
---
I must have been distracted by something
---
Well that's a twist
---
Oooo which house are you guys talking about? The 2 story one on the same street as the preschool?
---
inb4 they nerf freddy into the dirt again like they did the first time.
---
So 3 more chances for 3 more maps? Guess I can wait a while
---
I dont get this arguemnt. You already have to paid for comestimics now, and now you will get stuff FOR FREE WITHOUT PAYING mind you. 
---
So this argument is really stupid.
---
i have a good reason to believe it is haddonfield, cause its the only 2 maps in the game that utalize houses and fences in a way to an extend where they are very simmular so if you rework one you should rpb rework the other one as well
---
Two general youtube guides I would recommend are these two:
---
https://youtu.be/t8u0jRxN2kQ
---
This one details how to shorten the average chase time when faced against specific areas of the map
---
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQefm3-mUKURJqC5UFtzE64_S-OitL9DK
---
A playlist of quick run downs of most killers in dbd, you’re need to look up the missing killers elsewhere as bricky has discontinued the casefile series after his clown file. Basically each casefile is a quick summary of how the specific killer works and some of the effective strategies for that killer. It should be said that the casefiles are somewhat dated, meaning some of the advice he gives is no longer usable.
---
Oh. You mean if you miss the outfit in a season. 
---
It could happen. I agree with you on that annoyance.
---
Ghostface will be 14th June, mid-chapter will be about 6 weeks after that.
---
Absolutely agree.
---
Fingers crossed they dont become addons. The devs have a habbit of makeing things that should be base addons (*cough cough* Wraith, *cough cough* Pig).
---
Are you sure they said there'd be more pallets? I'm sure he said that the reworked map was over exaggerated.
---
If most pallets were as illustrated in the rework, it'd likely see an increase in killers simply blood lusting survivors constantly on these small loops.
---
So they announced a bunch of content for the future but told us next to nothing about next months update?
---
?????
---
I guess the ptb wait begins?
---
They're not horrible pallets if you're a half decent survivor
---
Hello fellow June third baby!
---
Your argument is that you have to spend money on a perk that you *might* need to use only on  *certain* maps is contradictory. 
---
Either you complain about you needing to buy a perk or complain that the perk only works on a small amount of maps, one or the other buddy
---
Not like this, though. This community is abnormally toxic in almost every regard.
---
I am also curious
---
Came here to say that lol
---
You are an hero
---
Probably not tbh. The little fecker couldn’t reach a hook, let alone be able to pick up Ash
---
Its not a problem lol
---
I assume this is a new pig. Considering the fact they camped and tunneled they definitely have to be new
---
tyy i will try it out next time i see her :D
---
On release, I liked it far more. But, due to the lack of updates and bugs worse than any in DBD, I went away from it.  
---
It was, at one point, pretty good. Now it's like kicking someone when they're down, I don't understand why this topic always comes back.
---
I feel like they could make it work .
---
Lol you are really just trying everything huh. Honestly it doesn't matter, but i'll humor you. PS this was in no way to 'brag' or anything of the sort - just saying that there's a lot that players don't know about when it comes to developing games and it's very frustrating.
---
I won't disclose fully for privacy reasons but one that I worked on was one of first and one of the biggest MMO's of its time (and still a very dedicated fan base due to it's IP), another was a 'Rock Band' title (won't disclose which), and another was a MOBA. 
---
No, I didn't work at some indie company that sold a free app, if that's what you're wondering. As for my bf, among others he has worked on games for both Bioware and Bethesda, if you wanna go for that super well known name-dropping shit.
---
If you'd seen and heard the stories and day to day struggles I've seen/heard about, you'd understand why these types of opinions are so incredibly frustrating.
---
No. His size already deconfirms him plus dbd isn't interested in doll killers
---
Nah, the p2w claudette outfits
---
You wot
---
Played an iridescent head huntress game for the first time in a year or something, rank 3, knocked 1 down, dc, knocked 2nd down, dc dc dc. Everyone left
---
I downpipped. I was so pissed
---
You can say that about every community if you get to pick and choose the people. 
---
I can go into a call of duty chat and see the same things being said, same with a R6 stream, OW, or any other big game. 
---
Twitch chat is literally a place where nobodies use copypasta and shitpost. People act different in twitch chat for whatever reason. Just close the chat.
---
Remove bloodlust entirely because literally only one map as of now in the entire game is getting rid of loops. 
---
Flawless logic.
---
You will get stuff for free of course like usual at the cost of a heavy grind that could take you longer then you might think. Unlocking the tiers will definitely be hard, and the free version of the pass will have a reward every 2 or 3 tiers as opposed to the premium pass.
---
I feel like since they got the mask and made their own character they could of made they own survivor as well etc .
---
No, I'm complaining about suggesting that you buy a perk *and* run it just in case you run into a bad map. The point was that it's a lot of effort to safeguard against having the occasional match ruined and it doesn't even do a good job of it.
---
It would be better to just avoid those occasional ruined matches altogether.
---
I don't mean for this to sound as aggressive as it's undoubtedly going to, but please explain to me what I'm missing as to why it's powerful.
---
Because all I'm seeing is an ability that allows him to patrol gens easier without helping him in a chase, and Patrolling is probably the easiest part of playing Killer.  With his two other stated abilities being weak, and the teleport not allowing him to patrol the map as well as Nurse or Billy, he's going to be mid-tier at best.
---
And another thing to consider is that unless they change the game to have a icon for completed gens, you get fewer and fewer teleport options as the game goes on.
---
imagine caring enough about a game to go on it's subreddit, but also shitting on people who want the game to be more enjoyable for themselves
---
honestly most of the deleted messages are deleted by bots, they delete for excessive capital letters and using big streamer names like noob or ochido. But you're right, there was a lot of it and that does say something about the masses
---
Every game is dominantly whiney fucks. The best we can hope for is that their shit attitudes cause them to quit or stay at the bottom of the ranking pool and you just see less and less as you climb.
---
yes i have the image they shown for it and all.   
---
[new changes](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/398554478414135307/584108214338060348/unknown.png)
---
as you can see before it has bigger coin bag suggesting safer loops, on the new change it shows more coinbags but smaller suggesting more unsafer loops compared to before, so you get more pallets but more unsafer loops for compensation. all the devs did was rebalance an accuring issue
---
God windows are most definitely a problem. They're being reworked for a reason.
---
its not pay 2 win its pay to get stuff in a short amount of time that you will most likely not complete unless your playing all the time .
---
Looooool case closed, folks, let's pack it up here.
---
They said “we know”
---
Hex Totems should erase all the hooks and pallets on the side of the map it spawn on and give double xp to everyone.
---
The killer being chased? What sorcery is this?
---
Not_Queen is epic
---
Shitty survivor mains sadly are the loudest group in this community.
---
Drag and drop it into Google and sort my size
---
the reddit gods have spoken
---
I wasn't just talking about Twitch. Anecdotally, this community loves attacking and insulting other people on almost any medium.
---
There powers are used to track and slow the game down (just a lil bit)
---
bamboozle my dude
---
Because we dont know how it will fully work yet
---
OP didnt say that, OP said the survivors are toxic.
---
Its still free and you already pay for comestics so whats the problem
---
Keep in mind that there will still be more changes as well. Nothing said on stream is final, just somethings they are testing and want to make those tests public.
---
HAHAHAHAH campers dont deserve bloodpoints
---
yes you did
---
&gt;Player count is falling
---
It actually hit the highest numbers ever this week. But yes cross-play should definitely be a thing, regardless. More people playing together is always good.
---
Freddy’s power is to hit people. 
---
I don’t know how doc slows down the game outside of madness 3.
---
It would be a sterotype, but I wouldn't really consider it racist.  
---
But these days you can't even be proud of your heritage without someone calling it racist, so it would best if they avoided stuff like this.  
---
Also the American flag has nothing to do with race, it's a nation.
---
Literally no one cares what you think, you don't represent the opinion of skilled players
---
If we remove bloodlust then let me break pallets with my M1 and no stun /s
---
It’s still on YouTube right? The livestream explains the Freddy rework, Ghostface and how they were going to rework map generation.
---
its a little different in dbd. theres no communication when in game so people will do shitty strats that are technically not against the rules but can ruin the game for their opponent
---
Keep your eggs in your baskets. The rework is still being tweaked. Wait until it is fully revealed before getting hyped.
---
Yeah but I just don’t see Jeff being anything towards pansexual.
---
I think ghostface is actually worse(from what we seen) then both of them because 1 you just need to glance at him for a second which then stops his stalk and 2 he can only stalk 1 person at a time. Ghost face will be a very mediorce killer and will need skill to actually make him viable from what I seen and plus Micheal has the ability to instadown multiple people and Amanda slows the game down with her traps and her dash is great for mindgames. So no they aren't being power crept out of the game IMO
---
You can go on th-&lt;Message deleted by moderator&gt;
---
You can probably watch it if you go on the twitch though
---
It's 23:45 in UK
---
Youtube had its chat disabled for the stream. It was a breeze
---
Dude if you dont want to pay then dont pay, i would gladly pay for the pass not because i want cosmetics but because i want to support the developers. You are getting free cosmetics anyways so be grateful.

Nah its not its a dbd sub, if it were killer mains only then no post about survivors would ever see the light of day, even your comment would be in the negatives if the killers here outnumbered the survivors mate...  
---
You and people like you just see balances you dont like or you see opinions and suggestions and discussions that you dont like and you piss and moan about it and when youre shut down because youre wrong you say "eh its a killer main sub" to dismiss the truth and continue doing what youre doing.
---
the archive and rifts seems to be another kind of game mode. as the devs said it expands the dbd universe. there is more stories about the survivors and killers. the new character that comes with this is “the observer” who gets the stories and memories from the entity when it took the killers and survivors. you’ll have some specific quests you’ll need to do and when completed there will be some free(and paid) cosmetics. you’ll be getting blood points, cinematics, completion charms, and some journal entries. you get to unlock some rewards and these will always be available
---
right :(
---
I did this and max size was 1024x561.

---
I resized it to 1920x1080, but it doesnt look that good... maybe someone can edit smth around them and just resize the source image to \~130%.
---
I have no idea what this means but I love it
---
Imagine all the hockey hair and denim cosmetics!
---
This is what will blow his mind too, some players are interested in a healthy balanced game and not brainwashing the devs into boosting just one side into god mode.
---
Archives really remind me of contracts from TF2 so I dont have anything to complain about
---
I respect the attempt
---
You're not wrong but it does matter a bit. Like I've been on both sides at r1 and when you have those killer games when you just want to try out interesting stuff with Trapper/Wraith etc and you run into 4 stacks full of Mettle of man/ old DS it sort of makes you prone to go back to good old Billy.
---
I'm one of the few who actually enjoy playing vs Billy as surv though, but it does get old being against the same few killers every time.
---
Possible but likely low. But eh. We thought Ghost face would have trouble getting into the game due to how much of a mess the rights are to the Scream franchise,they eventually learned they to compromised, though sadly at the cost of the character being released without a map or survivor due to not being able to obtain the rights to anything but the character mask. :( 
---
While he might have the strength to do so, he sadly doesn't have the height to actually hook a survivor.
---
But... Sacrificing won't be too complicated, since we already have the End Game sacrifice mechanic in the game. Chucky wouldn't exactly need to carry the survivors to sacrifice them, as he can just perform a sacrifice ritual like he does with the survivors on the ground. So that's one problem we can work around. 
---
Pallet and vault interactions would probably need some creative ways to play around them and tall objects would suckass. LOS camera height could probably get work around by having his power go into a third person mode, so that its like the survivors camera. 
---
But only time will tell.
---
Freddy can see auras of survivors outside of his terror radius (Tracking) and action speed is reduced when in dream world (Slowing Game)
---
Doctor making generators blow regressing progress as well as alerting the killer to the survivors location. And not to mention they literally can’t do gens at high madness levels until they snap out of it.
---
Jup, me too. Played a shitton (around 200 hours in just a month over christmas) a few years ago.  
---
Now it's just not fun anymore...
---
If you can see the person being unhooked then Dark Devotion could work. Make the other 2 survivors think you're going after the unhooker instead. You could also run Make Your Choice and get an instadown on a guaranteed obsession. Or for a memey build run Rancor and the last survivor who ends up as the obsession gets mori'd.
---
hes easy to rank up with
---
Probably is spill over from the mass trolling going on with twitch in the past week, as a sort of protest for the twitch staff and mods showing favouritism and unjustly banning streamers all the time
---
they also said they'll be more spread out so it will feel like there's more pallets
---
Well, what are some of these "strats"
---
Well buddy you are a bit late with decisive strike, but for dead hard you are very wrong its the best exhaustion perk without question you just need to learn how to use it properly.
---
we barrely know anything bhvr barely gave us any aniformation they just told us what was gonna be there but not how it worked so by these asumption we cant rate him yet
---
Lullaby in the corner
---
Where is anyone saying looping is toxic here? thats not in the negatives? Theyre saying the BM after looping is toxic mate.
---
yeah idk to much about how dbd will be able to run on mobile, can’t wait to see some gameplay on that lol, but i posted a little summary of the rift and archive on one of the comments above yours
---
I agree, but let’s be honest it’s never going to happen
---
WOOOOO LET'S GO FREDDY MAINS!
---
Your argument of “my comment would be in the negatives” actually makes no factual sense, mate. 
---
I’ve seen plenty of survivors get shit on (including myself) and verbally harassed by killer mains on this sub over the most minimalist of things. Not to mention, our comments completely downvoted and hidden because killers don’t agree with us. Sure, maybe survivors are more vocal with upvotes and downvoted, but killer mains are more combative and vocal on this sub. 
---
I’ll say it time and time again. It has nothing to do with “seeing things I don’t like.” So you can take your comment go somewhere else with it. Lmao like thanks for proving my point.
---
Legion's Deep Wounds counters MoM a bit. Extremely rare if they do drop from bleeding out though.
---
This fits the character of Freddy so well. I really want to be excited, but I'm not convinced they'll intentionally release a high B or A tier killer. I'm anticipating bad restrictions on the pallets, snares, or teleporting.
---
I considered that might be the case. I can't knock that decision. Would've been an interesting killer, though.
---
The Purge..with a team of killers and a larger group of survivors would be awesome.
---
Depends what you consider a nerf. You'll get more, evenly strong spots now. Depends if that's better or worse than less loops, but with them being stronger.
---
Rumor has it the DEVS aren’t a fan of him. I guess that’s why he’s not a Fog Whisperer or whatever.     I absolutely adore him though
---
Don't hate, appreciate.
---
I’m very intrigued by this, although out of curiosity, how would you have it work with Pharmacy? I’ve always wished Plunderer’s reduced chest noises so I’m all about it. 
---
I’m not a big flashlight user (console’s a bit tricky for me) so it’s a bit tough to sell me on that. However... what if the perk stuck to its name, and once you picked up the first flashlight you were “bound” to it, so would be trading off using a Medkit, etc later. Or maybe you can open one chest instantly, get the item you’re bound to, and it’d be some protection against Franklin’s as well. 
---
Although it’d be interesting to sort of try to be this flashlight-coordinating person who leads the team to all carry flashlights lol. 😂
---
I wouldn’t have your hopes too high. The Hellraiser franchise has been extremely messy. But like Halloween someone can get the job done right. 
---
I don’t think they should remake the first movie the first movie was amazing. What I think they should do is have great gore of course but show us more of the Cenobite world and cool Cenobites. 
---
Also have a great story and background with characters I can care for. I did like Judgment but the last 20 minutes was horrible. I believe they can make a great Hellraiser movie but they’re going to have to do better then they ever have done before. 
---
Also Gore one thing missing from Hellraiser I think is Gore. The movie should show more of it and be more explicit like the original movie was before they scraped it and made Hellraiser 1 into what it was today.
---
Hellraiser is very very dark and I hope they explore that. I’m actually thinking of picking up Hellraiser comics and learn more about the other Cenobites.
---
No I'm totally aware of that, but I would like to at least see some improvement among the community, because it has seriously gotten out of hand
---
....That is the exact point of the entire post and all the discussions mate.  
---
Theyre reworking so there IS something else for you to do.
---
Those are called sentences duuuh
---
I missed the stream what's new with my main
---
Theres a couple really solid killer builds that work super well on The Game but the thing is you have to know that youre going to The Game (or Lerry's to be fair) in order to use them. 
---
Some examples being:
---
Distressing-based gen protector builds (especially with doc/ spirit/ nurse). Especially spirit because distressing basically acts as a poor man's prayer beads on this map.
---
All seeing builds (pig with amandas letter, wraith with All Seeing addon, scratched mirror mikey, etc)
---
Totem builds in general (especially russian roullete spirit since she can actually cover all 5 totems here), since The Game actually hides totems instead of just placing them out in the open (although devour hope kinda sucks here because of the map size)
---
That's just more time for u to kill them lol. That's not holding the game hostage.
---
Why did I get downvoted? I was talking about a post that hates people saying “Happy cake day”. 🤨
---
Oh that sounds really cool! Glad they're progressing the story
---
I totaly understand the struggles of game development. I realise it's usually one of the hardest jobs out there with a lot of overtime and the likes. But when you look at the income of the executives, it's hard to imagine that the extra money from microtransactions goes to the developers
---
What do you mean so what? it means those people are assholes.
---
Guys, I'm shaking. I'm fucking shaking.
---
I never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with the Entity. That perfect, curvy shape. Those beautiful tentacles. The dozen or so child bearing hips of a literal god. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll never mate with it, pass my genes through it, and have it birth a set of perfect mini-entities.  
---
I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance to get the Entity pregnant. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear.  
---
Why would BHVR create something so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in our faces?!  
---
Honestly guys, I just fucking can't anymore. Fuck.
---
... Ahem, as I was saying, the Entity giving you the 4k was nice.
---
\^But \^the \^Entity \^is \^nicer.
---
Congrats, you provide nothing to this game
---
 “He’s still skinny”
---
Street pallets are okay at best. At least you can keep looping after its dropped fairly effectively
---
You need to start the fast vault when they are in fron of the locker and the stun takes effect when the animation finishes. I've tested out a fair bit and it takes a bit of getting use to. Does seem a bit buggy at times.
---
I'm surprised no one's talking about this. The hosts didn't mention it, but it's pretty plain on the slide.
---
Can a Dev confirm that I'm not mistaken about this, and it's saying you can 'pay' for the paid track with playtime instead of money.
---
#notallgamers
---
Lol is that still a subject. I guess yes
---
Prepare yourself
---
Nothing stated yet, but you can use iridescent shards to get it for free.
---
Oh
---
Even though I still don’t like the idea of a pass coming to dbd, it certainly is better than what everyone previously thought it was from the video clip.
---
An hour or 2 ago I saw a different PS4 player had this same issue after buying Myers. Perhaps the psn store is being wonky and slow atm?
---
Yeah but it takes 4 seconds of stalking than a full t3 which is longer.  Who’s to say what Ghost Face’s add ons will consist of.
---
You are fully right. We all play the same game and yet it always feels like the community is at each overs throat. Nothings ever going to really change that. There will always unfortunately be toxicity on both sides. Which is why as a neutral I like to pick up the popcorn and watch the show
---
And im going to state that im on team B even though im actually on team A, then im going to say why team A is weak and needs a buff.
---
I dont bitch I enjoy the game both ways
---
/u/Dhjx21 how did you fix the problem for yourself?
---
Ahem,
---
He’ll get harder to see when he’s far away, invisible even
---
Doesn’t have to PULL people into dream state, when he gets close they enter microsleep and can hit and chase them
---
Survivors will fall asleep intermittently, and while asleep can be affected by Dream Snares and False Pallets that Freddy can place
---
Also, he can charge up a generator teleport by looking at its Aura
---
Op, this has been an ongoing issue for a long time. We need solutions, not just stating an obvious prob :)
---
I often try to send something nice to killers after the game, example is “gg fam, gl in games tonight”. Just trying to be positive is all
---
Isn't that the point of the game? Like looping and being chased is all about mind games, and getting into the killers head in the hopes of making them perform worse definitely works as a strategy. I know I play worse in any game when I'm angry.
---
It's the same reason in Leauge of Legends some junglers will camp a particular lane in the off chance it will make that player rage and perform worse. Is that considered toxic?
---
I disliked it and I like to think my reasons are valid. I got by playing just a few hours a week and stopped as soon as I reached the last reward, but I and everyone I know was completely burnt out on the game by that point. I've seen nothing suggesting the rewards will come back, and fear of missing out isn't entitlement it's an instinct ingrained in our brains and is something that video game companies have really leaned into taking advantage of with things like preorder exclusives, seasonal lootboxes, time limited gachas, and obviously battle passes. I like warframe a lot, but I like to play it at my own pace.
---
Right, which is why LOS is only a way to juke for a few seconds at a time, not to end chase or combat bloodlust. Against a non-idiot Killer it should buy you maybe 2 seconds tops, especially if they're already in BL. I doubt even with a pallet increase we're looking at pallet spawns within a few seconds of each other. This strategy will only work in low ranks where the Killer is actually confused by a LOS break.
---
No, I will only sign so long as we have his workplace too.
---
Street pallets are hands down worst in the game. If killer is not potato they play the short side and looping is impossible.
---
If killers are allowed to face camp Surviviors are allowed to "hump a BS window all game"
---
Its there to punish survivors for looping on certain maps, if you play on some Coldwind farm maps if the survivors get a lucky spawn you can get some really nasty loops. Badham as well but they are reworking that.
---
Its just poor map design which has lead to bloodlust becoming a thing.
---
I totally used to enjoy watching people argue, you get some seriously funny and stupid arguments, but it has reached a point I think. I dunno it's beyond me how so many people can get so upset
---
They never wanted bloodlust though, they put it in because at the time it could be made impossible for killers to land a single M1, one day it may be gone.
---
The revealing of the Claudette with the blue jacket was so majestic
---
That logic is applied to the Ebony Mori today lol
---
You can be good at the game and still say that those pallets are bad. Can they be used? Sure. As far as any pallet setup though they are the least useful ones on any map (that I can think of).
---
&gt;Try some stuff and see if it works.
---
They are? They even showed footage of the new tiles and layouts that they're working on.
---
Bye
---
noob3
---
Love you Math &lt;3
---
That still doesn't justify the absurd number of safe pallets on that map. You can't say a map is okay because you might have one specific build that takes advantage of the strange layout.
---
Hes not going to be better then Myers. How about you dont assume and maybe wait until he comes out then we can judge easier?
---
We do know that as it currently is it takes 60 seconds to get someone asleep enough to use his power.  With how easy it seems to wake up, if they don't severely drop that timer down this will not be good, unless these traps are legit so strong they make him rival the likes of Nurse and Hag, and even then he'll be mid-tier.
---
42,86 Iri rounded up per day(Both hunter and survivor bonus exp of the day) from the EXP boost (lvl 50-100(it seemed to be pretty much the same lvl 1-50 but slightly less Iri))
---
Then don't face camp. It's a tactic that should be easy to punish and counter
---
I'm thinking it just means you have to pay money to get the bottom track but still access the items in it as you play more, which is how most battle passes work these days
---
The house with bottom floors that aren't a basement. They have two staircases, one that usually leads to a vault so you can run the killer for a really long time without putting much thought into it.
---
Is that the wiki? Because it's fan run and isn't official at all.
---
I mean when you take a bunch of introverts and put them on a camera it will always be a bit cringe. At least the stream gave us some decent info of the future of the game
---
I so relate. 
---
I only learned recently that Small Game has little legs jumping over the trap. I thought it was someone crackling their knuckles. 😂
---
Luckily earlier after running into the problem I sent a  ticket to dbd customer service which I thought hadn’t worked and I found out it did work and I received an email from behaviour to restore my licenses on my PS4 and it worked I can now play spoopy boi Myers
---
*licks finger and touches ass* 
---
sssssssssssssss...
---
A living meme
---
I'm pretty stoked, the dream pallets and gen teleports sound pretty cool
---
Sorry you are 100% correct!  This was a bit of a rant in the moment after Insaw people complain mere hours after the stream. We need solutions just like you. I totally LOVE when I can have a good post game expirence. And don't get me wrong, this IS a competitive game, and you have every right to want to win and such, but some of the stuff I see is just absurd
---
That’s not what it means. It means the “rewards” are accessible with playtime. They literally said in the stream that you would have to purchase the premium pass with cash.
---
I tbag and flashlight click for the fun of it or if the killer is bad to mind game them into thinking I'm doing it to call them trash
---
Oh I'm sure someone is going to bitch about something because they refuse to learn how to counter it. The ones who can't adapt to new characters or perks are the ones who cry nerf all the time.
---
Skeet Ulrich. 😂
---
He can hit survivors outside of dream but can be seen in a certain radius of them. There are more ways to get out of dream but he also gets mire dream based powers. He can place traps that slow survivors in dream and can create fake pallets that are invisible outside of dream but are like the fake doctor pallets in dream. He can also teleport to nearby generators with a cool down but the survivors can see blood shooting out of the gen as he does. Now survivors have a new mini clock thingy similar to the cleansing pools and RBT boxes that lets them automatically get out of dream and they can get out via sabo skill checks now too.
---
Holy shit. Hes bad ass. This is going to be fun I'll prestige him up.
---
I cant wait till I meet new players and tell them about how freddy used to be a shit tier killer. And how I mastered that
---
The one with a vault at the top of the staircase? I didn’t know it had more than one staircase?
---
I had them move it up cuz it sounded better in the meme, you're welcome 👈😎👈
---
I would rather have both. The ability to mess with someone's dream is what Freddy is good at.
---
Yeah man, it’s shitty, but my thought process behind sending something positive, it might spread a little bit, who knows.
---
I’ve had some good conversations with ppl now, and have been able to provide some good feedback to them as well :)
---
In the same vein if i play Overwatch or CS GO in comp and get shit teammates thats just shit luck and its based on my rank, i cant expect the devs to hand pick my team for me.
---
When a chapter releases with only 3 game-breaking bugs.
---
I think I’m just unsure because I still don’t know enough about it and I left the stream with more questions than answers. But let’s be honest it can’t get much worse than it is right now. Hopefully I won’t regret buying him now
---
Agreed, but I think it can only go so far. I too enjoy seeing stupid arguments, but for people to already be complaining mere HOURS after the stream, without even getting a chance to try anything I think is a bit too far. I dunno, you're right, stuff isn't gonna change
---
They aren't reworking loops entirely. They're just adding more, shorter loops to replace the super long ones.
---
[I’ve been looking forward to this...](https://youtu.be/qCd0_gk9VBI)
---
Remake Freddy idk why it autocorrected and Michael to me looks like part 6
---
This is when this game changes forever.
---
Think youre just looking for an arguement to be honest, title says the survivors are toxic, not that looping is toxic.
---
Hell yeah man :)
---
Then break the pallet
---
No it doesn't,  it's just so you can chill while it happens, especially struggle since it stays longer
---
it just happens sometimes cus there is a minimum amount of pallets on the map
---
This cracked me up almost as much as Not_Queen declaring her fingerbangs.
---
Great stream. 😂
---
You are obviously a killer main because you don't think like a survivor at all.
---
Issue resolved. 
---
Had to deactivate as primary PS4, then reactivate as primary PS4, then restore licenses.
---
Here's to hoping this looping nerf will also Indicate a GIANT buff to stealth
---
So how does survivors being in dream world help Freddy?
---
They didnt say that.
---
It seems my time is finally here...
---
I'm All Ears will be insane on Nurse.
---
actually it says some survivors are toxic, not all.
---
Yes, but back in that time there were also 3x the pallets there are now.
---
Billy loomis hopefully. Did they say when it comes out .
---
Paragraph is a fan made term, the developers called all the dlcs chapters, even ash's dlc was called a chapter. But it is still disappointing.
---
anytime in the summer
---
Buy pass with lots of cosmetics, and new objectives to maybe change up how you play for ~$10, OR buy only one outfit for the same price
---
It's a joke until it's real. Nothing wrong with being concerned when somebody flirts around with the concept.
---
"He's not going to be better than Myers"
---
"How about you don't assume" 
---
Lol, yet the very first thing you say is an assumption. How about all we *can* do is assume since we don't have any word on his add ons yet? We have no idea who will be better. Wait and see before saying anything definitive.
---
I will help spread the word
---
I also would like to know. :3
---
It's not Billy Loomis. His last name begins with a "J", sounds like one of the ones I mentioned, and his last name is Olsen. He comes out on PTB on the 4th, and out properly on the 18th
---
I heard but I’m a bad listener.
---
Also the add ons will have to be reworked. Maybe one of his Ultra rares will remove the blood?
---
They use a "currency" based system for loops. So say a loop that can be run for 20 seconds would be worth 2 points, and one that could be run for 60 seconds would be worth 60 points. There's a cap on how many "points" can be reached by loops during the map generation. All they're doing is more evenly spreading the costs out. So there'll be far fewer "60" loops and more "20" ones. 
---
tldr: More, shorter loops.
---
Ah shit I even considered mentioning restoring licenses in your thread, glad it's all working now Myers is so fun.
---
Ok /u/St4rSce4am hopefully restoring licenses works for you as well, if you aren't sure how to do that, don't worry it's not too complicated a quick Google search can show the steps (or perhaps dhjx will tell ya if ya ask)
---
Give twitch your SSN before you're allowed to talk in chat /s
---
noed? Nah. Survivors will push onto the hook, and if it's not near a hook and they're not coordinated (AKA a 4 man SWF with comms) chances are more than one are going to run in.
---
My bad. I didn’t get to watch all of the livestream sorry.
---
Ok /u/St4rScre4m hopefully restoring licenses works for you as well, if you aren't sure how to do that, don't worry it's not too complicated a quick Google search can show the steps (or perhaps dhjx will tell ya if ya ask)
---
ghost face IS random assholes in the mask.
---
Precisely
---
Well when words like Puppers, Monto, and Noob3 are banned, it tends to happen
---
Oh yeah see that omega blink.
---
I can’t wait to play him
---
Then buff stealth to make her weaker
---
He also does some adorable grooving and finger-snapping in the background of some of the band performances, like right [here](https://youtu.be/JyWcUp8RcSE?t=7301)
---
Then break those too
---
A nerf to all the loop goblins out there.
---
I’ll play SWF. If anyone else wants to add me, feel free. I mostly just play killer because I don’t know anyone who plays, but I’d like to play more survivor. My gamer tag is Unproxied.
---
Was this comment necessary
---
Mainly made it for a friend who said to me, whilst I was on a hook “I won’t let you get in struggle” while he was doing a gen and well.. I went in struggle..
---
I wouldn't even be mad. Just get away from a gen before someone gets hooked.
---
Or run Jake's perk.
---
*Breaks all the pallets finally*
---
Oh, the survivors escaped.
---
Welp, I disagree but I don't think it will do any good to argue.
---
Usually, you can gauge your progress before you buy the pass itself. So if the pass costs about as much as a skin and you’ve already progressed far enough to unlock it then you might as well buy the battle pass and collect the additional swag it offers.
---
And what is the point of your comment supposed to be?
---
Chill out dude
---
Balanced Landing? That’s all I’m gonna say hoss
---
You can.
---
And he's not wrong, you just don't get it. Hence your downvotes.
---
Face camping has like 50 counters now. There’s not much many killers can do about overly safe areas on some maps
---
Beautiful artwork!
---
Well, the title says that there are SOME super toxic survivors who loop bad or new killers on purpose, just for the fun of it. I can handle those loops but there are a lot of killers out there that can‘t. 
---
But everyone is interpretating their own meaning in it and that’s fine. It‘s about the discussion :)
---
&gt;Face camping has like 50 counters now. 
---
Can someone indulge me on what they said about a loop rework? Working during the stream :(
---
Whelp. Guess you fucked up. Apply more gen pressure next time.
---
This is why I have twitch chat closed for "event" streams in any game, rarely anything constructive to be found on them.
---
The slowmode was insane. Has to wait 10 minutes at one point to complain about slow mode.
---
What are you talking about?
---
Yes that’s exactly what support had me do
---
Simple Formula was an obvious reference to the movie, they may have wanted to avoid any sort of trouble with the license holders.
---
I don't know if they *could* have gotten in trouble for it, but they probably didn't want to leave it up to chance.
---
Lol no it wasnt
---
Wait... why?... do they have something against no0b3 and puppers? I can see why they might with no0b3, but puppers? Can someone explain this to me lol
---
This is how i feel every killer match but i push through to get better at losing.
---
I saw the vid lmao
---
What are you trying to prove here excatly?
---
#REAL SHIT?
---
did they say you can buy it with shards? cause I do not think they did
---
the matchmaking has been like that for weeks. I'm kind of a baby killer as I've been unlocking perks and stuff and I'm normally going against people 6 levels or above me.
---
Don’t we all
---
looping is toxic!!
---
I can't find them saying on stream that the paid track has to purchased with cash, just that you could chose to participate in the paid track.
---
You should read up on the top game companies to work for and why. The benefits that employees get are outstanding. Specifically one company I worked for, even when i was temp - They took us to free movies, threw parties (alcohol included), let us out early before vacations, free soda/drinks, snack machine where everything was 50 cents (including jack links beef jerky...YES), free breakfast (bagels etc) on mondays....the list goes on. The big BIG execs who didn't actually work anywhere near the actual product and only saw numbers, while they weren't the brightest when it came to the direction of the games, they trusted their employees. They threw millions of dollars at new projects all time time, even after many failed. They gave the company MORE money to host more events to improve morale at the office. They gave discounts for gym memberships after it was a request from many employees. They aren't just sitting there stealing quarters from developers pockets like some sort of Scrooge McDuck.
---
Honestly it sounds like you've heard about how one company has done things and assume that it's all of them. I assure you, it's not. There are companies that truly want to provide a fun game, and be a fun company to work for. Many companies have gotten rid of crunch for this reason (including the one I mentioned previously).

But you still have to keep in mind, that they do, in fact, need to make money. More money means more employees to hire, which means more features, more games from the studio, more opportunities to expand, etc. There are a million ways a company can get more money out of customers, and most of them are super scummy. This is not one of them. You know what you're getting, it's completely optional, and it does not give you any type of leg up in the game compared to others.
---
The look on the future mobile players when the game runs at 3fps
---
It's there because every chapter includes a survivor, that's all
---
There's no way the wiki could have known the summer chapter wasn't gonna be a full chapter :T
---
That there are more bad killers who bitch that the game is Survivior sided than good killers who bitch that the game is Survivior sided. 
---
You hear people like Tyde Thyme argue the game is Survivior sided and then you look at him not knowing how to play Billy and facecamping the few hooks he gets and wonders why Surviviors manage to escape and do gens
---
Well, the one that leaps to mind is camping.
---
It’s pretty obvious, it’s just the killer standing in front of someone he downed so that nobody can rescue them, ruining their game.
---
It’s something which isn’t against the rules, and you can’t even really blame somebody for doing it, since it can be quite effective in some situations, it’s just kind of bad sportsmanship.
---
Guess you're no longer a Proud llama?
---
What's good my dude
---
What were the changes?
---
Not necessarily. The gen teleporting is going to have a cooldown. For all we know it'll be stupidly long and you'll only get to use it 1-2 times per match since games are often only 3 minutes.
---
Yo
---
Ok
---
And yet you still post on this subreddit
---
Ghostface, hopefully!
---
Face camping is where they just sit right in front of you while you're on the hook making it almost impossible to be saved. This strat is really bad because the other 3 survivors will just finish all the gens while youre doing that but it basically guarantees you fuck over one survivor at the cost of the game. Tunneling is where you focus one guy until he dies, which is just super unfun to be that one survivor. 
---
Pallet looping is not a toxic strat and is literally the base of survivor play, its like calling barricading walls in rainbow toxic, not sure why he included it. It's where you run around objects with pallets on it to waste killers time and then throw the pallet down once he gets close. rinse and repeat.
---
Teabagging is just crouching in a way to taunt the killer, you waste time teabagging in front of them to show you that they can waste time and still get away from you
---
Yeah I hear what you are saying. But then you have people like Ardetha, Zubat etc who are extremely good killers also pointing out clear as day issues which are very real, and people just shy away from it.
---
Timestamp in stream?
---
No :(
---
Yeah, I personally don’t find toxic survivors to be THAT common in my games, but when I do see them, they’re fucking irritating.
---
Ghost face new ability to be able to hide in lockers
---
I'm not a Freddy Main. I've played him to 40 (My rule with all my Killers is to play them to 40, the only BP that doesn't come from them are whatever is left over from the last killer and dailys) because I love Fire Up and Blood Warden.
---
But on paper, the changes don't sound good. He has 7 points he can teleport to that go down as the game goes on (as gens disappear from your vision as they are completed), and he's going to have the Hag/Trapper problem of placing traps in the early stages, and he's not going to have mind-game options with his fake pallets at all (especially if they start changing it where there are more pallets on the map like they said they were going to).
---
I'm happy he's getting reworked, but there's just so much wrong with it. Gens are one thing. Going into a Locker and popping out of another locker would have been so much better.
---

Pls nerf
---
Hi. I'm a prestige 3 Level 50 Freddy main. And I'm personally hyped about the ReWork
---
I'd like it if killer/survivor interaction was focused on losing the killer entirely, or not being found at all. 
---
Being spotted by a supernaturally powered psychopath with a weapon should be a Very Bad Thing, not the setup to one of those gags where someone gets chased around a table for 20 minutes.
---
I just have the P3-50 trophy to go and then I'm done 😍
---
I would hope not. Iridescent add ons tend to be OP as shit (Iridescent head, Tuftstone Myers, etc.)
---
Thats not holding the game hostage. Youre going to die regardless. Really its hard to pinpoint a true hostage situation now that endgame affirmatively kills everyone regardless. However thats a seperate topic in itself. Being slugged is not being held hostage. Its either your teammates come save you, or you die. Its essentially a longer hook.
---
My point is you're wrong, because you don't play survivor.
---
If Nightmare got that much of an upgrade with the Infinity Gauntlet I can't help but wonder what power ups Nurse and Billy would get.
---
Wonder what upgrades Cannibal would get from it
---
Hmm I double checked and the only thing mentioned is that it can be earned with in game-time. Whether that means the pass itself or the rewards I'm not sure. I must have got confused when they said "no pay to win". It does really suck if we can't use shards.
---
Not only that, we still have no info about how strong are the snares, his addons or if we can still teleport to completed gens.  
---
That's why im still waiting for the ptb for freddy to arrive before i give my final verdict.
---
get a pc
---
I thought they said Judd Olsen.
---
Hard to say I guess.
---
This fucking sub is so fucking weird. Killing survivors (the point of the game) is toxic. Running away (the point of the game) is toxic. What isnt toxic?
---
Technically your title does not even imply that toxic survivors exist, but if they did, the picture would be their reaction
---
Let's talk about those favorites
---
There are clear issues. Generators get done way too quickly. Stealth is shit. Nurse is broken. Certain loops are too strong. Moris exist. 
---
There's a lot of shit that needs to be changed, it's not just Survivior sided shit that needs fixed.
---
That is the thing tho you shouldn't have to be forced to use bamboozle. We are already forced to use hex ruin. Survivors are not forced to use anything. Hell, you don't even need self-care bc you can bring in a medkit. telling someone to use a perk to counter loops is the exact problem the devs have in using perks as bandaids and not fixing the actual issue.
---
References dont get you in trouble.

---
Please for the love of God devs don't add to the list of add-ons you have to rework later on bc there 2 OP
---
I'm asking for DBD tips, not which platform I should play on.
---
Of course, but most people play survivor. So when killers bring up their issues people don't care.
---
Good on ya then.  
---
The post is not to mock anyone who plays freddy, is to mock those who immediatelly went on reddit / forums and scream out loud "FREDDY HAS BEEN GUTTED" without even trying him out.
---
Just finished unlocking that. To replace Dead Hard. No regrets. Now working on Adrenaline because I'm a sucker for meta builds in any game.
---
How do you know that the completed gens won’t still be highlighted for Freddy? Just wait to see what the devs have to officially say before making the assumption.
---
What are they fixing about it?
---
Very nice ad hominem you got going on here. By your logic it should be easy to attack my arguments, but instead you attack me directly
---
DANCING EMOTE FOR DWIGHT WHEN!?!?!
---
it is prob for the rewards. and ya it does suck cause for me shards are useless and it would be cool way to reward players for grinding in my opinion
---
The issue is I don't want a fuckin' battle pass system where I pay for the privelage of not unlocking stuff I pay money for because I decided to not dedicate almost every day to this game and play other games, and thus get locked out of a bunch of cosmetics entirely while also preying on the notion of "Once this battle pass is over its gone!  Buy your levels now to get what you want!".  How about just putting the fuckin' cosmetics on the store and letting me buy the ones I want and ignore the ones I don't want.  Tried and true system.  
---
It's the new way to milk fat stacks out of you, not the same level of awfulness as lootboxes but this has become the new way to have a similar effect.  Instead of seasonal lootboxes you get a seasonal battlepass, where you either play an obscene amounts of time to get everything in the season or drop an extra 50 bucks to get that 1 item you want because it's lodged way in the back, while 90% of it is absolutely useless items that not a single soul gives a remote fuck about.
---
There’s a thought for a radically different Killer: he can’t actually hurt the survivors directly but he can grant them the ability to kill each other. Make them turn on each other.
---
I don't need to attack your arguments, they're trash because you don't play survivor. If you played survivor you'd know your arguments are bad.
---
If the stream was any indication, you can stalk multiple survivors at the same time, just at their own rates. So if you're Stalking Meg for two seconds and Dwight pops out of the locker next to her, by the time you've stalked Meg for 4 seconds Dwight will be at 2 seconds.
---
Might make STBFL pretty good on him, honestly.
---
Yeah, cringey to see people having fun.
---
People who use the longer loops because they want to survive are assholes? Teabagging (because that's what is) is not toxic in itself. Teabagging and shitting on the killer in chat afterwards is.
---
Google “Waifu 2x” and give that a go.
---
Usually works for me after some tweaking.
---
Adrenaline: Gives you a free health state upon moving when exits are open, plus a sprint burst. Any perk that gives a health state for nearly a free cost is better than dh.
---
Bl: can be used in multiple situations on any map. Doesnt become useless when the killer knows you have it, because theres no way for them to prevent a surv falling unless they get the hit beforehand.
---
Those are two that instantly come to mind. I also decided to stick with exhaustion perks, to keep it in the same realm. If youre running dh, youre hurting yourself.
---
If they are trash you should be able to attack them though, it looks like more like you are upset because you can't and are now throwing a tantrum
---
Presumably his active dream powers won't affect awake survivors.
---
Decisive strike? Mettle of man? Pallet numbers? Flashlights? Endgame collapse? Killers get their way with BHVR way more than Surviviors do lmao
---
THIS. We all joke about it from time to time, but that can morph into a "more real" thought. Always just offer an ear if you can or point people in the direction of help if you can't help yourself.
---
fucking crib looping is too strong plz nerf
---
identity v has 30 total viewers on twitch right now how is it lively?
---
People are already complaining about a rework that we didn't even get to try ? This community really is wonderful.
---
Absolutely
---
The new rework seems overly complicated and shit. Freddy has traps like Hag and Trapper, can teleport kind of like Nurse, and fake pallets like the Doctor. He also has his old aura-reading (still?), but lost his built-in stall ability. Survivors can now wake up via any failed skillcheck, including sabo, and now have a guaranteed wake up with alarm clocks. That's bullshit (and doesn't remove the luck issue at all). What is the point of Freddy being a dream demon and being in the dreamworld if the dreamworld is mostly pointless now and he can hit survivors whenever he wants?
---
Get it fellow brethren
---
There is a 2nd map rework on the roadmap but they didn't mention which one, I would imagine its haddonfield. I hoped they were going to go over all the original maps and spice them up a bit with the map rework thing. Corn maps don't excite me as killer after 3k hours
---
the fact that people are saying to use a perk to fix a problem is using a bandaid to fix the actual issue. There are still god windows. Just bc something isn't an infinite doesn't mean you can't loop it more than it should be looped.
---
Dont have it in me to kill baby dweet.
---
Can’t wait for survivors to chimp out until he’s nerfed again...
---
So here’s how I take it I think Freddy will be maybe Meyers or Huntress tier.
---
Yes teleporting is cool but we need to know one thing how long does it take? Since the gens start to bleed and that gives you enough time to run away. 
---
The slowness seems great but how big is the area? And you have to go set them up or one. 
---
Microsleep fucking awesome I love that as it makes sense and it makes him viable. 
---
He can maybe do a mindgame with his power of teleporting but we don’t know how strong that is yet! 
---
Oh the pallets the doc has the same thing and it’s good but not amazing so we’ll see how well it works. But I do believe Freddy walks faster then the doc. 
---
Take all of that into account and I predict he will be more fun and easy to use. Will he be used in r1 most likely not but other ranks between 5-20 or 10-20 yeah most likely. 
---
Again this is my prediction and how I see it so I definitely could be wrong, no way of knowing till he comes out
---
What are you saying? That killer get more nerfs or survs?
---
I presume labelling it and referring to it as a “paid” option means cash. Considering that a full 3 piece cosmetic can cost 21K shards there wouldn’t be a feasible way of making it purchasable with shards whilst also maintaining the shard pricing of the cosmetics. I mean it would have to cost at least 50K+ shards which is a stupidly high amount.
---
gotta loop those customers needing something
---
Yeah but Spirit can't see them either
---
I've heard him be called Jet Olsen.
---
Freddy as it stands is among the weakest killers if not the weakest. Freddy's delay harms Freddy and gives survivors time to unhook each other. I love Freddy and playing as him and with the right build he's viable but I feel the new rework is a major improvement for our boy Freddy K. I'm gonna give it a chance
---
Stealth perks exist and some are good, it's just easier to not play stealthy. Also you get less points by playing stealthy
---
And yet they get all the survivor nerfs they ask for
---
The one thing about the fake pallets they said that's interesting is the survivors can throw them down, but they explode into blood. So it sounds like they will be locked in the animation to throw them down. Which would be huge for getting free hits.
---
Someone’s salty.
---
to me it all depends all these new pallets could be unsafe pallets for all we know
---
Some of those bits by the band were pretty hot TBH, and that female guitar player was awesome!
---
Them was the days. Ah the good memories of a dude railing my mother and being my father.
---
Christ you people are annoying.
---
okay if you can't catch a survivor at 115% movement speed....you suck, it's just that simple, when i play killer halfed assed i get 4 kills, when i try hard as a survivor i barely make it to easily get killed, the odds are stacked in the killers favor, so other killer mains.....quit your bitching god just play the game have fun and get over the fact you're gunna get looped sometimes.
---
We talk about infinite looping on purpose against clumsy/new/bad killers. When survivors don’t play the game anymore and waste everyone’s time. Not regular „looping“ :)
---
Shh it's okay. If you can't come up with arguments of your own go back to the kid's table and let the grownups talk
---
That doesn't matter. The current Mori is fucking unbalanced too. I agree with what Monto says about them. You should have to hook every Survivior at least once to Mori them
---
I mean they are reworking maps gotta give em credit. I have seen a couple of games release a character and no new map to focus on balancing pre-existing ones.
---
Theres a difference between guarding a hook looking for the one other survivor and facecamping, though
---
Uh they need to rework The Game first.
---
Removing some stupid safe loops is handicapping ? 
---
You'll have to use your brain more now ... Is it actuslly a problem for you to do it ?
---
You got really salty really quickly here. An end game perk is not situational. By that logic, NOED would be situational. BBQ would be situational.
---
There are plenty of killer perks that are situational too. And plenty more that are completely and utterly shut down as soon as there's a swf group in the lobby.
---
But as you're saying it. Imagine if you couldn't loop an entire half of one map because you didn't have balanced landing. That's what I'm talking about here. Practically endless loops using one window unless you run a certain perk. And at least you can get balanced landing without dlc or shrine.
---
I hope the surprise is that they will be matched with each other only. so the only people they play with are others who dc nonstop. really teaches a lesson. only way out is to not DC throughout games of people dcing. I've seen other games use this concept for similar problems.
---
Sounds like someone didn't cleanse all the totems.
---
You went through all these games with the same outcome and never thought once about cleansing totems?
---
Wouldn’t you rather just try it on a full release? For console players that much time is just a slap in the face, plus you won’t make any real progression on pc. Id so much rather just have everyone get access at the same time.
---
Both Meg and Kate are hot....just sayin.
---
So just get rid of looping so it's easier for killers to win. Got it.
---
Bc if killers get to do toxic shit so do Surviviors. Simple as that
---
You could literally fill a phone book with the amount of slurs you heard being screamed every game
---
True
---
I am currently in university and am planning to become a game developer after my studies. Most stories I heard started to scare me off though, your story is a breath of fresh air amd gives me some more hope. Also:
---
&gt;Honestly it sounds like you've heard about how one company has done things and assume that it's all of them.
---
You're most likely pretty right on this one. It's more like I heard about 5 companies, but I should keep in mind that this is not how it works everywhere
---

&gt;You dealed with it as we have to deal with EGC
---
Except killers have been dealing with looping a hell of a lot longer than survivors have had to deal with EGC. That is not a comparison anyone should be making.

I am not creative but I hope your idea works out. I'd really like to see that DBD card deck once its finished.
---
&gt; Teabagging (because that's what is) is not toxic in itself.
---
I swear when Ghostface comes out Killers will go around slugging everyone and just teabag until they bleed out.
---
Downvoting the question instead of answering via comment. Smh have some dignity, people.
---
Not efficient if you want to power the gates.
---
u/_Scarlxrd_ Exactly What we was talking about
---
It takes me between 5-15 minutes to find a match.
---
Then again, we barely got info about his abilities wich is why im upholding my verdict till we get our hands on him in his PTB.
---
I mean, really that's what all killers are to some degree, you have Hag who's just Nurse + Trapper, GhostFace who's just Amanda + Myers, etc etc. 
---
We're reaching the point where what a killer's kit over-all is what matters more than the individual components, its what the sum of all those parts creates is what matters.
---
👀
---
I fucking hate the toxicity in this community.
---
I still run adrenaline. But yes NOED is a perk rewarding you for playing bad. Sure other perks do it but this takes the cake because it downs you unlike other perks rewarding you for playing bad. Sure you can do totems but that’s not the point the point is the perk rewards people for playing bad. Also even taking the time to do totems is kind of laughable. A good killer can capitalize off of even more time in a match which is why I just grind through Ruin Skillchecks instead of waisting time like the other 3 survivors.
---
I’m not talking being slugged. I’m talking repeated. Reread my comments.
---
We got quite a lot of information (not everything in detail, obviously), during the stream, and I still don't like it.
---
There isn't much you can change about nurse, her base power is just broken and incredibly strong. No one should want stealth buffs, the game is usually fun because of the intensity and pressure of chases, not the people crouching in the corner of the map barely interacting with the game.
---
Just occurred to me that he doesn’t like to show his face.  Maybe that’s why?
---
The devs did they ruined Freddy.
---
That got me too LOL
---
I'm way more inclined to say Kate.
---
I wonder if the game will ever come to console
---
I love we're gonna farm forever
---
I never used NOED, but it sounds like it's really good judging by your post, so I'll be putting it on, thanks!
---
Efficient if you want to avoid NOED, what your bitching about
---
I know there will be more pallets but.... it depend how palets are set. if it's unsafe, so there's so little compensation.
---
I didn‘t say that :)
---
It's so adorable how BHVR wants to be like big daddy Ubisoft with their little yearly events and their roadmaps and map reworks and their new ranking system, and 4 chapters a year, and charms. They copied everything almost perfectly. If only they could have hired a band that didn't come straight from a retirement home it would have been too close to tell, really.
---
lot of information? then how will addons affect his power? can he teleport to completed gens? what is gonna be the teleport range? his terror radius? how strong will be the snares?
---
They said Rifts would NOT be unlimited. Tomes from the Archive would be
---
No, as an avid Scream fan, this does kind of feel like the next step past the meta-Sidmry plotline. In-universe, her story was bastardized into books and movies. It makes sense that a new Ghostface would be inspired by the actual Scream movies or something.
---
As I said, I'll deal with it, but it still a new nerf for survivors while killer keep have more advantages
---
What a loser lol
---
Because to say it's NOT Scream is to basically say "We got the Scream killer" rather than the "Icon of Halloween Costume killer."
---
There's probably a LOT of legal shit with what they can and can't mention now, because they can't relate their 'unique killer based on a halloween costume icon' with the thing that that costume is actually famous for and the reason they have it.
---
Way to entirely miss the point about the battle passes being a predatory marketing device, and completely greedy in a paid game with at least 4 paid DLC a year and a cosmetics shop already in place.
---
But no, it's just "sTuPiD pLaYeRs sAyInG iT's pAy2wIn LoL rEeEeE"
---
Devs don’t like him?  Why?  Because he says c@nt?
---
i use both with my david. Best of both worlds. Except now i only get a stack during a "safe unhook" despite them all being safe.....retarded reworks.
---
&gt; do I not want to always be crouched
---
Crouching is there for two things; ambushing people and forcing people out of loops. 
---
In order to ambush people, you should get Whispers (If a Survivor is within 48/40/32m, this perk lights up and you hear voices). When Whispers activates, crouch and go looking for them (probably next to the generator). If Whispers isn't activated, don't crouch.
---
When you find them, do one of two things; use the Ambush attack, or if you're feeling really saucy get as close as you can, uncrouch, and pull the survivor off the gen for the insta down.
---
If you find a Survivor who is at an unsafe loop, you can crouch and threaten the Ambush. This forces the survivor to drop the pallet and be on one side, making it a 50/50 on if you hit them or not. You also have the option to almost charge the Ambush, release after the roar, and stand up. It only works on certain pallets and depending on the exact situation the Survivor might be able to just run away, but it's a trick worth knowing.
---
If you crouch the entire game, not only are you moving much slower making the generators that much harder to patrol, but you're not actually invisible so Survivors can see you and avoid you.
---
&gt;  do I only have one person have a bear trap at one time?
---
I believe the general consensus when *learning* Pig is to trap the first Survivor you down, wait until they has their trap off, trap another survivor after that, and then use the other two traps after that one. This forces one survivor off of Gens constantly and can potentially trap two in the game if the timing is right and they can't get their trap off.
---
~
---
Lastly, be aware that you can pull off some sick parkour tricks with Ambush if the map allows it. I can't find the exact video, but it's possible to jump off a hill, onto junk/tires/low walls,  and even through some windows. It takes practice, but it's so nice when you get the hang of it.
---
Also Devs have shown that they are inherently bad at nerfs or buffs if they aren't direct. Totems having shit spawns was "fixed" by introducing Haunted Grounds, so their bad totem spawns might not be touched because they theoretically could make you exposed instead of directly fixing the totem spawns.
---
Ok so what about camping ? I can add "insidious camping" if you want.
---
At least it’s not COD battlepass.

sheltered woods lol I hate that map the most out of the entire game as survivor, far more than Gideon.
---
*equips ivory mori*
---
I am your leader.
---
Well let's hope we get something good for the dream demon!
---
But that’s like saying “Self-Care” is rewarding players for playing bad because you got hit. Same can be said for DS. You can be a good killer and the exit gates can get powered. The perk has counterplay and isn’t op. What more do you want
---
Hate the game map as survivor.
---
&gt;(not everything in detail, obviously)
---
Don't cherry pick stuff out of my comment.
---
It still existe for now. When each map will be revamped, you will see less (or none ?). I know it will take time to revamp each map, but  the idea is to have no loop in fine.
---
*ghostface appears*
---
Are you being serious, or is this a joke?
---
You might catch a glimpse of it
---
I would have loved to have the store as a map. (Despite the problems)
---
They're on the right track! Freddy, in the movies even the remake, is omnipotent in the Dream world and while he isn't even in the rework it's pretty close to it! I'm excited for it.
---
Thats my point. We dont know how it works yet.
---
"Tremendously sad artist spends far too many unemployed days drawing porn for themselves."
---
Ok, have fun not having internet for a few days
---
Nah, credits to you.
---
Thanks for the info I missed it
---
3 gens left. All across the map. Teleport to each one constantly. Game over, he wins
---
Sorry for that, i was in a hurry to reply and didn't read the entire comment.
---
He wont be myers for the fact that myers has a more easily used lower TR and he is able to insta down all members for much longer.
---
Change your settings so that only friends can send you messages , I play on PS4 and I used to get between 1 to 2 toxic messages after nearly every match , that kept putting me in a bad mood so I changed the settings. Hope that helps. Enjoy the game!
---
Possibly eventually, not for awhile, theyll want to ensure the game actually survives on PC before expanding to other consoles.
---
Youre talking repeated? What? I dont understand what youre trying to say.
---
NoED is situational because as you know, the only way NoED is active is if the survivors finish the last gen, which is a SITUATION that only happens if the survivors power all generators. So, if the situation doesnt arise, the perk does nothing. That's the definition of situational. Things that only work in certain situations. BBQ is not because the chances of you never hooking anyone is 0% unless you're afk or rank 20 against rank 1 squadette swf.
---
And, I already cant loop half a map, red woods. Half the maps a dead zone. And you can only hop a window 3 times, how do you endless loop 1 window?
---
Also I cant beleive you just compared getting looped at one window to a survivor having half the map entirely empty. You should try running  bamboozle if window loops are too hard, then they can only loop once instead of 3 times and you have nothing to complain about.
---
Oh wait, that's too much effort, nevermind sorry. Carry on about how windows are broken and you dont want to use the exact perk that counters survivors who know how to use window loops properly.
---
No I’m serious
---
It could be, they are changing Freddy and Badham so maybe they had to contact the license holder to approve those changes ? And also asked about cosmetics.
---
New cosmetics for every single survivor
---
Baby skins
---
Now everyone can be a *character* main, big brain
---
Actually listen to what the devs said
---
Well. Either gut nurse and make her trash or buff stealth to take her down a few pegs
---
I still don't know which one that is. The only house with two staircases other than the preschool is the one with a basement area (not killer basement, regular). The other house with two small rooms upstairs has only one staircase
---
I mean I didn’t want to we beat the killer beat up in our way but....
---
Ive never heard of killers farming hits, but regardless, while it may be unfun for the surv, that surv isnt being held hostage. They're gonna die regardless. Like being hooked farmed.
---
You have two gates + hatch if it hasn't been shut. It's not that hard mate.
---
If the killer has killed 3 people, it should be a challenge to escape.
---
EGC was made to stop games from being dragged out. 
---
Thanatobia and ruin put together is down to a player preference(devs cant do shit about that)
---
Insidious, I agree, should be removed. (Dont know why its a perk in the first place)
---
NOED, ehhhh its situational in my opinion.
---
Ruin is quite balanced in my opinion because it gets taken out fairly easier (unless is 'the game' map)
---
I also understand that survivors also have OP perks, I.E. mettle of man, DS, adrenaline etc. 
---
The devs have to look at both sides of the coin and decide priorities at the moment, with the introduction of new mechanics to the game they are focussing on major balancing issues. They decided probably due to the evaluation of metas and perk sets to focus on killers more this time. Survivors will get their turn
---
I think we've done a pretty good dance so far.
---
As an Overwatch player I am sad we don't get anything like this. 
---
I don't even play DBD but watching the livestream just gave me the impression the devs actually care
---
Add pop goes the weasel to that
---
Let’s agree to disagree.
---
So we should balance the game around people who refuse to learn how to play it?
---
Survivors are forced to bring borrowed time, and they can feel forced to bring self care coz your teammates can suck and never heal you so you waste your medkit all the time, and the killer can bring franklins. I disagree with a perk to counter loops tho I think it’s about mind games and aggressiveness. But both sides are forced to bring perks now. Rancor also forces survivors to bring more stealth perks to avoid the killer in the end. Being forced to bring hex ruin is not a thing. If you can’t stop gen rushing ruin won’t help you as people who gen rush well also know the totem spawns. And if you avoid that by camping your totem or going straight to your totem to trap it up, that’s why you get gen rushed.
---
Would if I could, born deaf
---
You’re correct.
---
Sure.
---
Anytime
---
The killer doesn’t have to be good to protect totems. Anyone can protect a simple totem also NOED comes active during endgame which you don’t want to run around everywhere searching for a totem. 
---
Yes you can do totems during the match but it takes quite a bit of time to find and do all totems and it doesn’t help you nor does it help you pip well. 
---
I play both killer and survivor and I used to run NOED back in the day. But I found how much of a problem it was even more so then the good nerf it got. I don’t think there’s much you can do against the perk then what they already have done. It’s just a little infuriating when you do good the whole game and then that perk with the speed boost just says nope. 
---
Maybe it’s the speed boost that’s the problem.
---
It's the "If I don't win I don't play" mentality with a hint of being too impatient to learn how to get better
---
Ah it's okay
---
My purpose was just to make a F.R.I.E.N.D.S reference
---
But thanks, dude 👍🏻
---
The infinity buffs.
---
I'm here just for memes and references.
---
Haven't been disappointed yet.
---
Also, yes I'm going to buy Ghostface as well. You simply can't say no to a killer who can t-bag survivors more efficiently than miss Piggy...
---
Killers should actually have to be good to kill survivors in the game not make a nerf on everything because they are not good. I have been playing against top tier killers for a while rank 5 and below and let me tell you they have no problem with loopers at all.
---
They don't set the amount of pallets for a map anymore, they set the power budget. Each pallet has a cost that drains the budget. Unsafe pallets have less value so there can be more pallets overall
---
What the fuck is wrong with people...
---
Simply pointing out the relevance of looping to toxic players. Again, looping in itself is not toxic. Nor is facecamping, despite being used by toxic killers.
---
Also I'm not sure if he said this but pallets are determined by their safety. Unsafe pallets are extremely dangerous to the survivor as they can be easily mind gamed by the killer to get easily hit. Sometimes it is better to leave these up to bait other survivors to use this same pallet.
---
Medium pallets are where the killer and survivor both have an equal footing and it's up to their skill. If the killer can mind game properly, then the killer has a free smack. If the survivor can mind game properly, then the survivor will delay the chase. This might lead to the killer being forced to break the pallet.
---
Safe pallets are a lesser form of the God pallets, as the survivor can do minimal effort and killer put in exceptional effort but the survivor (unless they absolutely fuck up) will always win. Break these as killer immediately.
---
Dont worry, when survivors RQ, they lost 2 pips... .and if a survivor stay, he gonna depip too and will be more salty than you since he lost the game in addition
---
Letting ya'll know right now, Make Your Choice is going to be a top tier perk choice on Freddy after this rework.
---
I'm extremely happy that he'll have a better, more interactive kit. But I'm also pretty bummed out that we may be losing a killer that has a high information power with aura reading. Maybe some elements of that will remain, but the ability to see auras and keep tabs on survivors was really what I loved about him. They just needed to give him an active ability to use in chases on top of what he already had and he would have also been solid. Oh well, maybe that'll be on another killer now. I really hope so at least, assuming he loses that aspect.
---
As someone who plays a lot of nurse, try to break LOS, and try to keep out of LOS. It's incredibly hard to blink to survivors that we can't see. Try running Spine chill (it's a pretty good perk imo) when it lights up for more than 1-2 seconds start crouching and looking for cover/areas to hide in. Also, if the map has a 2nd floor or you're near basement, try to get the nurse to blink down a floor since 90% it ends chases. If none of these are viable, just try to be unperdictable
---
Hook -&gt; Teleport -&gt; Break Gen. Great plan.
---
"Free" vs "paid", that's pretty self-explanatory.
---
I have read that same line on every single game's community lmao.
---
He takes his downside after the first hit if he chooses to use his power. After this rework goes through I don't doubt Legion will be the worst character.
---
Clown doesn't need a rework. His bottles need to last longer and be reloaded faster. I hate how people see Freddy reworked and are now saying all the bad killers need reworking.

The mask is what they got the liscense for, not the movies. They’re two different liscenses.
---
Thrilling Tremors will be nasty with Scratched Mirror
---
Cmon these are supposed to be funny... That's just true
---
So maybe don't put it on there until you're certain? Lmao.
---
Killer should have advantage 
---
It's a 4v1 game man and also most of the nerfs (like this one) is slight nerfs or it's fixing broken stuff(like ds)
---
No, you're right, I don't want to buy the dlc just for that perk. Guess I'll just refund the game then since shrine takes so long to reset.
---
I'm gonna stop now though. You know what they say about arguing with idiots.
---
You sounds like an excellent team mate
---
Myers is going to be better then GF, his stalking ability has more utility then GFs.
---
The fact that they are adding a battle pass disguised as a pay to unlock selection in their newly found story section is disgusting, they could of easily made an aspect where players actually feel rewarded for playing, without having to buy into the pay track for they can unlock it all, they literally announce the battle pass without saying or calling it what it is, and with the game being added to game pass it does essentially add a ftp element while all the players who've played the game for years get more clutter &amp; pay walls on items that overall can add incentives to continue to play. But yea we are screaming p2w lmao.
---
This is actually real meme material, nice
---
I’m excited for the archives tbh
---
Pay to slay
---
Jesus I thought the video was just lagging because I had bad service... but then I saw the comments and was like... oh.... 
---
    Why don't they get Panic Button to do the port?
---
For me it’s the 300+ ping Claudettes
---
It's true against any killer worth their salt though. Breaking LoS is useless because scratch marks and sound exist. Hiding is nigh ineffective due to the abundance of tracking perks that make chasing killers like Billy &amp; Nurse into living nightmares to play against. 
---
I very, very rarely lose a survivor and if I do lose one it's almost too easy to follow their scratches and find them again. 
---
Believe the man when he says loops are nevessary for survivors to survive. It's true.
---
I don't know, the survivors do get some pretty mean loops on that map. Not to mention Balanced Landing, on top of being a top tier perk, is a godsend on it as well.  
---
I'm a survivor main, and I honestly don't hate the Game. It can be a lot of fun to play on.
---
Cannibal does need one tho he's one of the weakest killers and his perks are the only thing that is useful.
---
I think he's talking about the blatant racism and homophobic slurs
---
Woah now,  I'm excited for the rework too, but you're definitely jumping the gun here.
---
Pro tip: always close that comment tab post match.
---
It's Twitch chat, that's to be expected
---
I have depression. I feel obligated to help where helps needed. If they’re joking, fine, if not, it’s better that I did what I did than not doing it.
---
Not loops in general. I didn't think I'd need to say that but there you go.
---
What I'm talking about is God window loops, endless loops. The kind of thing that can lose you a match since they can be almost impossible to deal with.
---
Waking themselves up has always been incredibly easy. It's as much of a stall as Overcharge is.
---
Freddy’s unite!
---
What the hell do you want them to do, put a year's worth of content into one update? I'm really not quite sure what you're complaining about. There will obviously be the usual balance/bug fixes that are in every patch.
---
Getting nerfed again
---
ftfy
---
If you think looping is toxic its because you're shit as killer
---
See'ya folks!
---
Ruin helps with gens being done too quick... self care helps with crappy teammates or killers who seperate you. Rancor and noed help you get free kills with zero skill. Perks are already here as a fix to a problem, enduring, brutal strength, spirit fury, legion, all there to counter pallets and end loops. Borrowed time, tenacity, unbreakable, there because killers can camp and slug. What’s that pigs one where her hooks come back? Whatever it is, it was added when sabotage was best thing ever and then they changed sabotage, correct me if it was the other way around tho coz I can’t recall. They buff certain perks so they become a counter like tinkerers to stop gens, gen rushing was something a lot of people were talking about at that time, they also changed thanatophobia. 
---
Perks are not a fix, but they are there and if you can’t do your job as a killer or survivor well then you have other options instead of changing one of the games main ways to escape or delay a killer.
---
To be fair the nature of the DC shouldn't matter as far as the killer goes. Intentional or not, the killer should not be punished.

i can explain
---
That‘s not what the title says :)
---
True that.  I identify very much with the figure on the right.
---
Though, unless they reduce the sleep timer from the 60 seconds they mention he won't be much better.
---
Just bought around 2k cells so I can grab Ghost and whatever cool cosmetic they give him.
---
I think there's also a double BP so we gotta Grind for Ghost before he release

I had one when I was 8 and I won a costume contest held by our local radio station. It had this big ass chest piece that oozed blood. The prize was a first swing at a pinata, busted the sucker open but couldn't bend over to pick up the candy lol
