Sadly enough, after being featured in some Rick and Morty episode, For the Damaged Coda became known for most people just as "Evil Morty Theme". If you google "Blonde Redhead" up, you'll see ton of evil morty themes before any other song.  
---
I love almost all of BR's songs and it's just disappointing for me that most other songs got eclipsed by good, but totally not the best, theme for some movie character. :(
---
---
---
I never watched ochido but seeing positivity in the dbd community is amazing so I’m alright with it 
---
Ignore him, Cookieh.
---

---
Don't let these "Nice guys" push you down! 
---
You're amazing :D
---
How would they know you used the glitch tho
---
So is Ghostface being a future killer impossible? Idk how they'd balance him or what his perks would be because he's a slasher and he mainly uses phones.
---
Would he be similar to the Legion?
---
Link?

---
NO FRICKS

OINK
---
This is at rank 5-1 where most people don't mind just working through it
---
first Noed, then someone claimed enduring and fucking Iron Grasp?
---
Whats next Spies from the shadows?
---
Lol what?
---
Keep it up hun!!! I hope to see you on Face Off one day, I'd be rooting for you! :)
---
Killer propaganda is real, if the subject matter was reversed it would've been downvoted to oblivion within 5 minutes.  1.3k upvotes wtf lmao 
---
Does this mean 1 person can get a gen done faster then 4 people 
---
I have this issue too
---
Especially since half the time the survivors end up being absolutely horrible, and the other half are super optimal showing that the ranks being "fair" didn't even matter. So you basically sit there waiting the time it takes for a full game for... nothing... yay
---
Sex when your parents arrive in the driveway: Adrenaline 
---
This was a problem before 2.5.0, and if you read the patch notes. They are currently working on this problem. *This is BHVR though. So that may mean absolutely nothing.*
---
This subreddit dick rides killers so hard
---
No. If you have more than 1 person on a generator, it can still be done faster than if 1 person did the gen
---
Freddy is boring as hell to play against. He isn't fun because if you're being tunneled it's a full game of running and if you're not the one being tunneled you're just doing gens and walking out the door. Most of them tunnel the same person all game letting everyone else gen rush if the person being tunneled is good at running.
---
Wait what map addon? 
---
Separate out, kite and do gens as fast as you can. The longer a game goes for Legion, the better. 
---
For a second there I thought that you had found another glitch.
---
No joke a survivor that has a perk to attack the killer would be awesome. 
---
Why don’t you make a case instead of trying to be witty?
---
Unrelenting is next
---
The one thing I hate about legion is his wipe animation... it's just so gross, his sleeves must be so crusty and sticky
---
I just want to mention something as well.
---
I assume all the things such as survivors GG as 1 example is tallied if 1 survivor says GG.
---
If that is the case, then there is a significantly better chance that survivors will have more times that they say GG, get salty, etc. Just because it's a 4:1 ratio of survivors to killers.
---
Very big brain indeed. Much skill
---
Yeah it's basically to be expected that the killer is gonna camp if you are the only one on the hook when the doors are open. It's up to a coordinated team to do something about it. Tbh even an intelligent individual can pull off a heroic save against someone who isn't Leatherface
---

---
Shit happens to me all the time, chase music blaring while I didn't even know someone was around me and I still can't find them anyways 
---
Ace and fang are getting brand new outfits 
---
I had a match as a rank 12 killer and went up against what ended up being 4 man swf that where rank 5 and up.  It was the worst match as killer I've ever had.
---
10/10 would oink!
---
Save the Best for Last is godly on any m1 killer who doesn't have an insta-down in their kit. It works especially well for m1 killers who have a power that can affect the obsession while the killer ignores them, like Doctor and Freddy.
---
You can get the hooked and savior pretty easy you just hatchet throw the hooked as soon as their off then hatchet throw into melee the savior. Shes widely considered better at basements then leatherface for this reason. But yeah when the hooks not in the basement and in the open assuming you can charge chainsaw and get in range before the unhook yeah lf can shut It down, but if a huntress is in range shell do the same thing from melee range and has a better chance to at range.
---
I'm going to go out on a limb and say he played exclusively nurse and billy
---
If you have all 4 people alive by the time the gates are powered you had plenty of time to cleanse the totems. It really isnt that hard to find them, except one or two placements on a couple maps.
---
Sounds like a true killer
---
Love that stare at the Gen like, "Well... Fuck that then." 
---
can you get banned by de ranking ?  (going in game and immediatelly dc to get -2 pips )

---
Chapters are roughly every 12 weeks.
---
Granted, Chapter 9 (Spirit) came out 14 weeks after 8 (Clown), but there were issues with the Summer Event iirc.
---
However, Chapter 10 (Legion) came out 12 weeks after 9.
---
Same
---
Oh. I get that feeling. :(
---
I'm sorry to say I've only listened to Blonde Redhead's Album 'Melody Of Certain Damaged Lemons' ('Ballad of Lemons' being my favorite song), I've heard 'For the Damaged Coda' in some Dead by Daylight related videos and thought it'd be an appropriate song for dying on the first hook.
---
That is... quite the long arm on Frank
---
TIL this was read
---
woo!
---
Pc, console, everywhere honestly. Best just to drop a gg and leave quickly or block messages from people not on your friends list.
---
Graphs 2 to 4 are subjective, especially graph 2. At what point it becomes tunneling? You can't measure that. If a survivor gets unhooked and bumps into the killer and gets downed, that's tunneling. Or if generator near the hook is almost completely done and the killer stays to defend both, the generator and hook, that's camping. But both are just smart plays from killer.
---
Not a snowflake, like she said, a normal person doesn't go around just talking about others appearances, not only is it rude but also weird.
---
It’s hard not to. But hey if they get worse and worse it just shows their true side and it says more about them than me :3
---
Bet Myers would love to stalk on them. They’ll feed him. He’s been looking pretty skinny lately. Hmmm 🤔 good idea!
---
And thank you! C:

He will eat you flexually.

Aw thank you! C: 💕 Have a oinkfull day~
---

---
'Boutta drop the hottest mixtape of 1979
---
This made me laugh out loud. Thank you. 
---
I think a solution for this would be disabling collision with the killer when survivors crouch walk while the killer isnt carrying any survivors.
---
This keeps the strategy for blocking the killer to allow a wiggle off and no one can be held hostage like that.
---
I was playing a match in which a David had seen the hatch and I had just hooked a Meg right next to it. I didn't know what to do because obviously the David was going to go for the hatch. I tried to leave and then as soon as the Meg died I went back, but the David immediately jumped into the hatch.
---
"Gain the ability to fully grant dying state to the killer."
---
Rip wraith. Surely that would be too big of a buff. Though I might be OK with letting survivors see eachothers auras, but then again you buff swf as well. Plz devs. Plz no.
---
Yes
---
At least tyler1 was (and is) funny, roachido just inserts funny haha distortion effects and ear rape to normal clips 
---

Evasion and stealth only semi work. In the chase, yeah youre boned if they can track you, but it’s about wasting the time of Legion if they try to tunnel you. 
---
 If Feral frenzy had a bonus for hitting 2+ survivors in one usage as well as had increased fatigue and recovery for hitting the same survivor we could have more incentive to use their power as intended and less abusively. 
---
Yes, totally weird to talk about appearances. Stop being a white knight.
---
It's simple, but Susie. I just really like drawing her mask and hair!

Paint Tool SAI, I find it simplest
---
So would that open up the possibility to Jason being a dbd killer or would Miller never allow that and the only hope is Cunningham tries to appeal it?
---
Google images and Tineye don't bring anything back (well Google brings this post but I can't find the artist either), so, assuming OP somehow just doesn't have a trail it's not really their fault esp. if they mention they can't find it themselves.
---
I looked it up after you mentioned it; I'm never going to be able to take being chased by her seriously ever again. Thank you, though!!
---
For every person on the gen, everyone's productivity goes down by 10%. So one person has 100x1%, so 100% efficiency, 2 people have 90x2% or 180%, 3 people have 80x3% or 240%, 4 people have 70x4% or 280%.
---
Those chunky hands freak me out. It's like some weird African disease or something. They won't even fit in the sleeve so I guess somebody must have sown that overall over Michael.
---
Hag will probably be next once I find the time!

"Some lag" "not funny any more". It's game breaking lag and it was never funny.
---
Thx
---
Yesterday I bodyblocked and killed an Ace trying to get a hit  from the killer so he could escape, but we both panicked and run straight to each other. Sorry Ace. 
---
Well with DBD's art style it would look pretty weird for survivors to just be walking through each other
---
u/WidowOneTrick read these lmao
---
Fuck your chainsaws, I have a window, barricade, and an escape route made of wood! But seriously, nice loops.
---
Bro 😂😂😂
---
This is the most lazy karma whoring post I've seen
---
I'm really surprised it isn't a thing already, like a survivor that can't heal others or is really slow repairing but can stun the killer every now and then or pest him in some other ways.
---
If a killer camps me at the end I dont care , it happens and I've watch a whole team go down cause they wanted to be extra altruistic at end game so it's best if they just get out
---
DS is annoying and all, but honestly though. I don’t think most people care about it. Just down them again if they’re in a bad spot. If they are hella good at chases, and looping then just abandon the chase to someone who is in a worse area. Also, yea. Enduring is a hella good counter to DS, and every palette. Nerfing the stun by 75%, as it turns out, effectively makes it pointless in 99% of situations. Hell the tier 1 enduring works well enough to counter it.
---
Lmao, see I always think people like that are trolling me and being toxic, I even get people who seem like they're pointing out another survivor for me, but my paranoia never allows me to trust them, so I slug them while they stand there... lol
---
Thirst
---
Edit: For example, there were 83 games played with 0K.  Of those 83 games, 50 had no talking, and the killer said GG in 35.  35+50=85. I may be adding these numbers wrong, but I'm not sure.
---

I considered doing it to get like 800 Blood Party Streamers to bring love to the people. Not gonna risk the ban for item glitches tho.
---
It doesnt matter bro reddit is the place where any negative comment at all gets downvoted by all of the sensitive pansies and white knights 
---
Hey, guys great news!  I just made it to rank 1 on survivor!
---
Its just a long neck. Nothing to be ashamed of.
---
Thirst? Mate, it's called being a decent human being.
---
Its just a long neck. Nbd.
---
 oh hey look it's the Nurse
---
Well I didn’t know that. Did I? It was not public knowledge Scott. All this thread is public knowledge and it seemed like you are not very resolved. 
---
You only accept people talking to you when it is to say “yes sir” blindly? 
---
So you want the characters to have no collision? Lmao.
---
Just don’t comment it if you know someone does not appreciate it. Not harder than that :3
---
giving my anxiety not looking back
---
See I agree with that. Legion has been fun to play and, aside from The Doctor, in terms of Bloodpoints Legion gets me more than any other character
---
This thread is also over a day old and ironically you're the one who brought it back up again. It was resolved already.
---
I know. Its fun to me tbh. Its all I do on this account x) shes been milking this cosplay for months and I just now noticed the neck. The glorious, long neck.
---
Neck harder than that.
---
*not
---
Yeah well the issue is whether he was deranking or not, the odds that he randomly disconnected are really damn slim. As you’ve seen, his name implies that he will disconnect before the match starts, turning it into a “three man” game, and he’s even burnt a Gideon meat plant offering to be a bigger troll. It’s quite obvious he purposely disconnected even if he was by chance going to get an infinite loading screen if he chose to stay. 
---
It’s not that people can’t understand simple sentences, it’s that you’re 100% wrong in saying he might have glitched out and are getting downvoted because of it.
---
just had a post today about how 80% of killers engage in no form of camping
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/akf9g2/i_played_another_1000_games_as_survivor_here_are/

despite the fact that camping is usually the most viable strategy

Shut up cracker

Ikr this post literally took less effort than it took me to downvote it

---
What marriage?
---
Oh is that what it feels like? Again not an argument. 
---
M1? Never heard of em 
---
I appreciate that reference to The Room you threw in there
---
Please leave
---
In most games you toggle this option on and off (example is Overwatch where you can leave the chat lobby or just mute certain people).
---
It should just be explained in the tutorial. Yes, your efficiency goes down by 10% for every extra Survivor, but I feel like that much could be explained instead of making it seem like a debuff applied by one of the Killer's perks (which to new players is an immense amount to keep track of).
---
As survivor I hate other survivors who do unsafehooks or dont even try... or just never seeing them do anything all game yet still get out.. saw a survivor on my team escape and only have 6k points(escape is  like 5k)... like tf were you doing.. not unhooking, not gens, not distracting the killer. Just boosted survivors who hide all game
---
As killer, really coordinated swf. Like their perks and items and everything gives each of them like 8 2nd chances. Like this one game with all neas all running vigil, lithe, dstrike and unbreakable with two flashlights and two instant heals. And they all knew how to loop. I was still new and rank 20. Lol funny thing is the streamer they went in ended up doing a swf with me weeks later and apologized for them. She gen jockied that game and said they were super toxic.
---
You’re the hero we need 
---
Can't argue facts. Upvoted.
---
Tru3 played Nurse.
---
I’ve worked hard for this cosplay. I’ve shared others here too. How’s it so wrong to share something I love with people that enjoy the same thing? In that case you can say the same thing about people that meme too. It. Is. A. Meme. 
---
PEEPEE REACTED. Am I a furry? Oh *NO*
---
For what? Neither party did anything wrong 
---
Lmao so if I have high devotion level and hours I can do glitch carefree?
---
Are the fences really small where you are at or are you a giant? Anyways awesome cosplay.
---
If you report something that’s on the list of non reportable things you can get punished for clogging up the system 
---
Typical.  Leatherface mains are so basic.  
---
it use to mean that the killer was camping you but in all honesty it doesn't mean much anymore as most people just do it since their bored on the hook
---
Honestly if you're already prestiged a ways and it's not fucking absurd numbers then you will be very low priority in terms of detection.
---
Holy fricks I never noticed how hilarious it looks! XD
---
They’re super tiny!
---
Thank you! :3
---
Kink shaming is my kink though.
---
Really stuck your neck out to tell me off. Good for you.
---
Haha, awwww, no, this is a good skin that I would totes want. Just like I want anime! 
---
Stay away. It means the killer is nearby, be it pateolling nearby gens, camping or straight up facecamping.
---
Constant = stay away
---
One to three times = get me 
---
It’d be cool if Myers had something referencing his new film- maybe he grabs them by the head, slams their head against the ground, lifts them back up and stabs them through the throat, finishing it off by causally dropping them. 
---
Is there like a depository all DBD vidmakers use for songs? Feels like I’ve heard this in dozens of different survivor videos.
---
Oh
---
After a quick google search, Wraith's invis speed is 126%. 
---
If it's a group of Claudettes you take your best killer and a good radiation suit due to toxicity levels being way too high for any human being
---
I mean, when we really take a look at it, distortion could counter two perks at the same time. It isn't that OP but please tell me how I could make them better and less OP. and the first perk is only for the obsession
---
Claudette beating Kate in a smash or pass makes me want to question if humanity is worthy of free will. 
---
Maybe, but it could ruin the game too. 
---
I'll Do It Myself: Sometimes you have to take matters into your own hands. Every time a survivor stops an action within 2 seconds of failing a skill check, increase your speed for that action by 50/75/100%

*"That's it I can't fucking take it anymore"*
---
I courtesy tap the unhooked person getting farmed by teammates and go punish the teacher for unhooking too so or unsafely. If they're still bleeding out when I have the other person they can blame their team. Granted I've never played above rank 10
---
No Bröther, together we are ströng. No heals, only pure muscle. We bleed and we rise strönger
---
“Because thats Nea’s job Bill”
---
I've had this happen before as well. It said the killer dc'd gave me the 5k points of surviving. My swf said I dc'd and kept playing. 
---
It turns out I was the dying light and I dc'd not 30 seconds into the game. It seems pretty fishy to me.
---
i know, they really are 😂
---
Sure let the toxic streamer who abuses game breaking bugs and ban evades keep making videos because games don't already suffer from treating streamers like gods 
---
There’s is no meaning anymore 
---
Tfw Jeff isn't S. Someone doesn't like bearded men here. 
---
Play however you want but imo this whole situation was just a waste of time for everyone involved. 
---
In case you aren't joking: there's an add on for the map that lets you press space while channelling the map that sets a big ass beam of light down on your location that other survivors can see.
---
Useful for when you found the totem but end up in a chase with the killer or for marking an almost done gen or where you are while injured etc, but I mostly just see people memeing with them by setting markers down constantly as they run or walk around.
---
Excuse me? Timezones are a thing and everyone was talking about this before me that doesn’t mean it was over. Im allowed to voice my opinion. Don’t be snippy with me when you know what you were trying to do and now that someone challenged what your intentions were and you had no reply to that.
---
Own up to your intentions Scott, don’t deflect your true intent. Ok? 
---
Like I said, lets hope this campaign of hate to Tru3 and his community stops. I will be very happy with this as it is all I would expect, for the best of the community. 
---
Underrated comment
---
Let me guess. He'll make me scream? Haha
---
Had a game earlier where all of the other survivors DC'd instantly then the killer DC'd... Fun game!
---
nice projection. have a good night
---
Save the best for last is for attacks that you hit and unrelenting is for attacks that you miss.
---
Um what since when? Leatherface is by far a better defensive killer hands down, if the lf is playing scummy there is no chance for an unhook to go through and  when it comes to the basement there is no chance huntress is better, when lf can ensure no one makes it to the stairs hands down lf can play defense better than huntress, its like the only thing he can hold over other killers dont take it away from him please (;-;)
---
lol, thats no projection, check this sub and you will notice
---
Can you let me know if they took the prestige’s away tomorrow when your ban lifts?
---
He'll give you the shocker if you know what I mean ;p
---
While I think ochidos videos are stupid. I think this video was pretty on par with an ochido video. Its 16 mins of complaining about ochido. All of this could have been completed in one text post. 
---
I mean yeah you may get them downed but that a few minutes more on a gen for the rescuer whereas it could've been a few minutes getting chased and the other would be looking for jigsaw boxes 
---
you mean survivors.
---
But nice projection. Good Night
---
I'm actually curious how OP recorded himself. Like if a bad game happened and they were salty, do they count it or would they just always be silent.
---
Also yeah the point of survivors leaving when they die is pretty important, but at the same time I doubt it would outdo the ratio of players especially considering how at least in my experience, SWF groups tend to stick around till the end of a match OR at least until they all die. 
---
Tunneling is looking at a survivor after they've been hooked, according to survivors.
---
Absolutely anti-fun for killers and more than likely break balance significantly. 
---
Agreed, just because spirit has the potential for mind games doesn’t mean they require skill in any form. With spirit all you need is general map knowledge and a set of ears. And you will 4K close to every game after a little bit of practice. You can’t out-mind game a killer you cannot see, you can get lucky, sure. But since you cannot see them at all your outplay is more in the hands of the spirit and how good they are 
---
Right?! XD
---
Sorry about that lol
---
It has nothing to do with terror radius though. The timer is based on whether or not you're in a chase.
---
&gt;Absolutely anti-fun
---
&gt;break balance
---
Eh Nurse exists. I'm sure we'll be ok
---
oh okay, I genuinely didn't know. 
---
Oh, sorry, my eyes read but didn’t really forward to the rest of my consciousness that there were other parts! 
---
I had a camping Michael on me. I got saved and an exit gate open. The person messaged me to tell me to leave so they didn't sacrifice themselves for nothing. Fortunately he was proxy camping too far away and we all got away. He was pretty trash even though I was lagging. 
---
You get off iron grasp all the time righ?
---
But this is so clearly a dickish thing to do, burning an offering for a universally hated map and leaving on purpose just to ruin everyone else’s fun. And despite all that, you still think ‘Duh, circlejerk lol’ is fucking stupid. Yeah, this game has a lot of bullshit to offer. You’re right. Players who ruin the fun of others is one example of it.
---
I don't want to talk to people. especially not people who are likely 15 - 20.
---
&gt; DS is annoying and all, but honestly though. I don’t think most people care about it. 
---
It's pretty obvious that you've yet to play Rank 1. If you did, you'd know that the perk is in use ever 2nd or 3rd match on average. And the perk is a game changer. 
---
no, but sometimes I do and sometimes I dont, you know? like its supposed to be
---
No. It's the correct opinion
---
Thanks, I said the same thing yesterday and got downvoted. I even looked in to the “evidence” people posted and none of the actual girls that complained about him were even underage. Dude is annoying and definitely doesn’t treat his female fans well but the “pedo” stuff recently is just a mob mentality echo chamber. 
---
&gt;Old facecamp prevents the unhook entirely
---
&gt;this waits out the timer without allowing the survivors to get close
---
Same shit. It prevents the unhook entirely because you can't even get to the hook in the first place. You're bodyblocking to completely prevent *any* unhook attempt. There's no difference.
---
Perkwise I suggest replacing whispers with spies, and lullaby with ruin.
---
Can confirm, had mine uncapped and got stuck. Capped it and can use basement as intended now.
---
I think the default is 7 seconds, but it can be shortened by a couple seconds with add ons 
---
I get the idea that its not really smart idea to go out your way to chase the unhooked guy. But when you actually can see the guy get unhooked it just makes more sense to down the already wounded survivor instead of spending +2x amount of time chasing the unharmed one let alone walk across the map to try to kick that gen that's going to finish before you get there. There's so much to gain from putting the guy back on hook. A kill early is huge gain for the killer.
---
If you call earrape and overused, outdated memes hilarious.
---
What's wrong with her nose? Did she get punched or something?
---
Just hit him with the bottle...
---
*picks up the scattered remains of the totem while knelt down and shedding a tear*
---
If you play as killer: Don't play during evenings or weekends if you want to avoid 4 man SWF. Aim for morning games.
---
If you play as survivor: Find friends.
---
1 individual has already been banned for doing the glitch. He glitches 3 prestige 3 killers and got a 3 day ban. Curious to know tomorrow if they reset all his characters or if he gets to keep everything even the cheated P3’s.
---
Hating someone? Can you read what I said? I literally said I think it‘s weird that he has so many hours (like 4000+) and yet he isn‘t even close to having every perk unlocked on every character, let alone p3-ing them. He doesn‘t even have all survivor teachables unlocked. I just don‘t know how that‘s possible considering I have 2500 hours and got p3 with all perks on every character.
---
Stalkception
---
Why is ochido a pedo
---
It’s nothing too much, however it’s great for stealth play or playing Pig. Combine her P3 clothes with super dark mist and survivors will definitely think your another survivor. Again, nothing too significant but it’s fun to mess around with. 
---
Because legion is bs and no one likes to face him or her 
---
I was so excited about the unhook + adrenaline too, would’ve been an awesome clip.
---
I'm not the best killer but c'mon guys chasing the same survivor around unless they're dead on hook, or the game is just about the end is always a silly idea.
---
That is not a she.
---
I was so excited lol, the unhook and adrenaline had me hyped.
---
Demi!

But legions really easy to face just most survs are garbage

Tydetime, Monto,  no0b3, puppers, the king, demi, hybridpanda,

I agree with you here with the exception of three points. I don't believe Distortion works on The Legion, Feral Frenzy doesn't give you an aura so Distortion doesn't hide you from it.  Stealth can work on him if you're running a build designed to be powerful against him... And he can't track... That just isn't good enough counter play in my opinion. 
---
And yes, don't get me wrong, a good survivor can still take him for one hell of a ride, but that relies on good pallet spawns (And the survivors ability to stun and waste the Legions Frenzy charge) and a pretty "Slow" Legion player. He will still just eventually "Win" if he's persistent. Don't get me wrong, a lot of other killers are like that, but at least I have a say in the matter and a chance to bait them out, with Legion, we only have one of two responses; Slam a pallet or keep running. Either way you'll get hit.
---
Its debatable but the tech huntress has is super strong in basement. Ive put 40 reps on both and am leaning towards huntress just because or the strength she has at range and while they're down there and you're at stairs they have like no options. Are you pc or console? 
---
Oh that reminded me of my friend's yt video with the emoji
---
It’s not that legion is difficult to go against, most people just don’t wanna spend the whole game mending/healing 
---
Oh my...
---
What platform do you play it on?
---
People hate Legion. It sucks, I feel you. I get d/cs all the time as Legion--but I also get d/cs all the time as every killer so.
---
I mean don't get caught most legions don't have a brain so I mean
---
Lol true
---
What an absolute mad lad
---
Thanks for the response but I'm not sure if you are aware that you posted it 3 times 
---
&gt;6 years

&gt;1 year
---
It took him 5 years to rise after his great fall. What is this, Dragon Ball?
---
As I said in another comment, Nurse still does have mind game potential, it's just up to The Nurse's skill more than the survivors (Which is a very good thing as, against good survivors, a killer can be ran around for ages, a good Nurse changes this.) With The Legion, there is no skill involved in either side.
---
Survivors can't really do anything to counter Legion which makes games boring - also deep wounds is annoying
---
BBQ&amp;Chilli (Leatherface), Hex:Ruin (Hag), Nurse's Calling (Nurse), and Discordance (Legion) are the best Killer perks in the game in my opinion, and work on all Killers. Spirit Fury (Spirit), Enduring (Hillbilly) Bamboozle (Clown) and Brutal Strength (Trapper) are all amazing for countering pallet and window loops, especially Spirit Fury and Enduring together. Monitor&amp;Abuse (Doctor) makes you significantly harder for Survivors to detect. Sloppy Butcher (Universal) can slow down the game a lot and pairs well with Nurse's Calling.
---
I'd take going against the Nurse over most killers currently any day. She might screw over people looping but she isn't immune to stealth or mindgames. 
---
Giving survivors power to just attack/stun killers would be abused so god damn heavily it'd kill the fucking killer role. 
---
He has been caught using his streamer "fame" to contact underage girls, lure them to play with him privately and then try to get nudes from them and harass them. There's a lot of info, just search. 
---
It's so true 
---
Me too bb sucks ass 
---
There have been a lot of suggestions for increased lunge range. I think the values are a bit too strong but if it was something like 10%/15%/20% it could be balanced. Pretty useful on Mirror Myers and generally good otherwise.
---
It doesn't matter? People shouldn't treat people like this over a video game.
---
Report them. &amp; report them to PSN or whatever this is on.
---
I have a dream
---
I’ve been pointing it out to killers.  Once in the end game chat another survivor said something like quit bitching!  You lost just get better!  even though it had nothing to do with my death and I completely carried them.  Ugh this game.
---
You are honestly insane. Devotion Level 6 is Player Level 600-699. Just get over your mistake, small brain. Blocked you now. Have a great life kid.
---
Depends on play style most important bbq the BP is too valuable to pass up
---
If everyone is jumping off a cliff do you?
---
It's mostly cause she blocks using MLGA so she can avoid "sweaties"
---
YEE
---
while I agree with the totems, the whole point of at least some of the gameplay is either lack of communication or miscommunication between the hooked survivor, other survs and yourself. It would be boring for me, and make saving way too easy.
---
Fog interferes with myers stalk, seriously messes up freddys vision, and helps hide hag and trappers traps.  
---
Depip squad hoooooooooooooooooooo
---
If gates are open then patrolling the area is good in my books, otherwise I'm far away from the hook.
---
Got into a match against a Killer who wasn't *great* but wasn't that good either. They could down people but would often lose Survivors in a chase.
---
Someone was on their second hook and I stealthed around the Killer before sprinting to save them. When I got close to them they just suicided on the hook and I was like "lol okay guess I'll do this gen."
---
The other two Survivors and I escaped. I commented on the Survivor suiciding in front of me and the Killer said "I just had a daily lol" "didn't actually expect to kill anyone."
---
The suicider was Rank 12 and the Killer was Rank 2. (Other Survivors were Rank 2 and I was Rank 8 [been busy with life but I have been Rank 1 before]) I guess that explains it?
---
Keep supporting a pedo then, I sure don't care what you do, you were the one asking
---
I really like his funny moments does any other YouTubed do them?
---
How about fucking no Battle royal is not needed in every game and it also makes no sence in a 4v1 game where the survivors are to escape and the killer is to kill. Forcing a BR mode will make me uninstall the game and lose respect for the devs 
---
That’s why I run whispers
---
I love this because of how true it can be
---
that's the system I use personally.
---
Hulk Hogan would like to know your location
---
1. Sarcasm is a thing and you should probably learn it. 
---
2. People get very upset over camping because you are LITERALLY saying, "Hey you aren't playing for the rest of this game"
---
Papa jake is good one
---
As has already been said, one is for hit and one is for missed, so the more stacks I got on Save the best for Last the quicker I was with hit attacks, and unrelenting just made it 30% quicker if I missed.
---
In all honestly, I've only had fun games against The Spirit. I've played her at both high and low ranks and both have been just as fun. I seemed to be able to get away with what I thought to be mind games... Guess it's been different with you.

STFU, you don't know shit. It's all speculation stop treating rumors as facts scum
---
No its one of the only two reliable ways to actually blind someone.
---
I feel like it’s not terrible itself but it promotes a terrible mentality of “I’ll sit over here healing for an hour instead of doing a gen”
---
This is why i think its bad! I sometimes run resilience so im actually useful until someone heals me
---
I agree, but the problem is it’s hard to make a game like this balanced since both sides have such different objectives. 
---
There’s also the fact that people who play only on one side will always get suspicious of the other side and go “hey grrr that shouldn’t be a thing” or “what that’s total bull crap, nerf him like one of your French girls!” 
---
And of course there’s the childish noed vs ds arguments that keep popping up. 
---

Aye chill man
---
The cute little bird and then that message right next to each other got me
---
It depends on how recently Mcote got laid
---
Lmao I wish i could give this comment gold
---
I think it sides with the killer when people first start playing. Once you get into the green ranks, it's pretty even. Once you get to the top ranks, in my opinion it shifts slightly to the killer's favor. 
---
What feelings? I am pretty calm about all this. And I "educate" myself every day. I saw enough information, even so enough is never enough in some cases, to judge those victims. As I said, I admit there are may be a lot legal proofs of their claims. But it is a solid fact, there are a lot false victims, who just use their status to hurt people. Why do you see the need to tell me to learn more? Maybe it is you who needs to extend his own picture?
---
I don't think so. That's a smart thing to do. It's the only time in a chase where you can blind them and buy yourself some more time.
---
“It is a solid fact, there are a lot of false victims”
---
Give me sources and an exact number or stop bullshitting.
---
Yes online petitions totally work this way /s
---
Killer's gg about 40% of the time no matter what, so by "people" you mean survivors lol. 
---
Awesome cosplay! I’m thinking of being David for a party,
---
Thanks for the info, fellow binger bonger
---
Oh my god the knowledge is too much for my feeble mind to comprehend...!

Lol, society is Fucked. Guilty until proven innocent
---
Awesome! I hope you post so we can see! Hope you have lots of fun at the party :D
---
Resilience is dope.
---
So is Hope.
---
We can call the deputy and judge in his state. They should be reasonable once we explain the situation. I think we can get him at least 20 years.
---
I’m glad you’re having fun! I almost have 3K hours into the game and it’s still fun for me! So if you have any questions, feel free to ask! 
---
can killer see the beam?
---
Thank you back :) here’s hoping I don’t end up looking like Dwight x3
---
Slug.
---
Slugging is so powerful and can turn the game around completely. You're losing time picking and hooking people, if you have game sense or even perks that help you with tracking you're better off slugging.
---
Tru3 just has this "nice guy" policy of slugging and thinks it's toxic, however it's the best way to apply pressure without the use of perks. And if it's toxic to slug why do we have perks like Deerstalker &amp; Knockout that actually encourages you to slug?
---
Watch any game that Zubat plays where he starts losing gens, he will slug.
---
[Here's a game where he does it perkless on Trapper.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM4iI8iuF5g)
---
&gt;But that's just one game!
---
Yeah, this is one game to give an example. Look through his YouTube on how often he slugs to keep his pressure, I can almost guarantee if Tru3 started slugging more he would have more success. 
---
&gt; I think Zubat would have also struggled to 2k there 
---
Just watch the VOD of his perkless rank 20-1 challenge, the skill difference is just immense.
---
Another example? Zubat never uses Ruin on Billy or Nurse and considers insta-saw and range add-ons for Nurse overpowered and bad for the game. You will see Tru3 use these add-ons constantly and say it's still hard to win against "optimal" survivors.
---
Yes. its ok to like tyde but i wouldn’t recommend him. Search his tier list video where he puts hag on the D tier when he had like 2 traps set. People where telling him how to play her and you can guess how it went
---
I only saw a couple from when he started and he was purposely ranking up slowly to avoid long queques after rank reset. Just another reason I think as to why he took longer than Zubat.
---
No.
---
It's actually fascinating because he's the perfect example of a streamer you're allowed to hate on here, the official forums and the steam forums. 
---
Not going to defend him or anything, but almost any other streamer is given some level of protection against being called out, especially here under rule 1 and/or 3. Even though they're public figures that record their actions for public viewing, the mods don't like people discussing said behavior.
---
But Ochido? Apparently he's fair game.
---
no0b3, zubat, panda, puppers.
---
Americans trying to shoehorn politics into everything is the most saddest thing I’ve ever seen and has just brutally murdered everything good about the internet.  Like holy shit its a discussion about a video game and now because he said yikes you randomly start REEEEEEEing about politically correct SOYBOYS AND NPCS!! when it has no relation to anything. I cant even take either of you seriously (especially you though OP) because midway through you decided to have a shit flinging contest on who can be more obnoxious.
---
*cAmandar
---
Ur probably right but i mainly go to his channel for the patch notes and event info
---
No it’s ace
---
honestly noed vs. ds is the weirdest comparison, ever.
---
Maybe Noed and adrenaline could be compared, but even that....
---
I agree with your Points tho
---
Question: Did disconnects count any and all DCs or only post-load in, where it's almost guaranteed salt and not an unintentional DC?
---
Fact: killers can win games with no perks or add ons
---
fact: this game isnt as difficult to perform well in as you make it seem
---
fact: plenty of great killers have no problems dealing with DS despite it being a strong perk
---
It's what you should expect from the pc survivors 
---
Ugh.
---
anyone who isn't listed in this thread
---
But then again, EVEN if I am wrong and I can be wrong, I do not deny that, i haven't seen facts or any real proofs of Ochi being a pedo. Now, don't tell me i AM wrong. It's better to cut the conversation there. You have a point. Maybe i need to educate myself. And maybe i will. But i remain skeptical.
---
Sad, but true
---
nose is just like that. u should see the bad guy that looks like ferb from phineas and ferb
---
Took so long to rise since he was probably in a legal battle with the Trashman over legal distinction
---
That’s my thought. And in my experience the ones that chase someone already trapped are in the minority so idk. It was funny though that all that time got wasted on me so everyone else got out. 
---
I’m a PS4 main, also have PC, but I’ve played him in the past, poor sport wont lie. Can’t exactly “cheer” he’s gone but I’ve seen his performance as a streamer and he’s not a very likeable guy
---
There's a F2P mobile game(also ported on PC) called Identity V that Behaviour has also helped developed that plays similar to DBD, but with a unique twist on how Survivors interact with the Hunter due to all of them having unique traits(some decode slower, but have great kiting tools, some decode faster, but have a handicap like being blind where your vision is severely limited, etc).
---
Some can "attack" the Hunter with several items like a Rugby player able to tackle a Hunter into dropping a Survivor with a Football &amp; Pilot with a Flare Gun that stuns the Hunter for a brief moment from a distance, usually for rescues.
---
I always thought a tackle perk that forces the Killer to drop a Survivor at the cost of injuring yourself would be pretty cool, kind of like the Rugby player from Identity V(they don't injure themselves on a tackle, but it's a really risky move in that game since using the Football tires you &amp; leaves you vulnerable for a few seconds, even on a hit). Would probably have a timer like Diversion with the same conditions required or something like that.
---
Until then, it's Pallets, Flashlights, Fireworks, &amp; Decisive Strike in the meantime.
---
STFU
---
I mean that’s fine. It’s reasonable to wait until there’s definitive proof he’s harassed an underaged girl (I haven’t seen that there -isn’t- but either way). But dude is clearly a sleazy guy either way, and your rhetoric is used by others in a way that makes it difficult for actual survivors to come forward (because no one will believe them) and that’s why I took such umbrage with it
---
This is an exaggeration
---
I still get brown items even though I have plunderers tier 3
---
Wow guys. Maybe the killer from the *POPULAR HORROR FILM* should be added
---
Nice. It's honestly a perk I've never run. Thank you.
---
It’s not perfect, for sure. And I’ll also get some yellow. 
---
But the chances of getting a purple/pink key and map is excellent. Like 9/10. And on top of that, the toolboxes are usually purple. 
---
I don't believe for a even a millisecond that BHVR will actually start implementing bans on console unless it's against people cheating the system. They haven't cared about actual hacks, glitches, and exploits they only care about people outsmarting them.

Even so I admitted in the first post I consider this guy is shit? He just doesn't bother me. Not him or his fans. I meet a lot of toxic survivors and killers, but they doesn't bother me.
---
Noice
---
I don't have spirit ;-;
---
You don't have to enable vsync just change the frame limit to 60. 
---
Ps tonsoffail. You’re a horrible mod and a moron. Mute me for not doing anything wrong. I did t even cuss. I asked a question. 
---
9,000 shards!
---
What’s the glitch 
---
I put him low but tbh I havnt even played him, i went from leather at rank 12ish then picked up nurse and huntress and now I'm at rank 5 so if I try to pick up a new hero I'm going to get stomped until I de rank and I cant be bothered right now I'm loving huntress to much. It's funny after we talked about huntress I played a match where I triple basement hooked off them trying to save one person then found the last guy outside while they were dying lol.
---
I don't think the question is phrased correctly, due to how many variables affect the outcome of a match. Some of those being; killer/survivor perks, skill level, SWF, etc.
---
KONNO DIO DA
---
I have 6,000. But I also want clown. My struggle is real.
---
What’s the question. For all I know you could’ve said some racist shit.
---
Iv had a lot of lobbies today where everyone was prestige 3 so if anything alot of people are gonna get perm ban of just a temporary ban 
---
Was Survivor sided but the killers main were crying out, so now it swaying on the fence.
---
what was your question
---
Yeah, bill was always more of a m16 kinda guy.
---
Shame on him
---
Borrowed time has been bugged lately and sometimes chooses not to work
---
Spirit is the most fun killer in the game to play in my opinion. Phase Walking is kind of similar to the Nurse's Blink, but you can continue chasing immediately after without a cool down. The chess games in your Phase Walk are amazing.
---
I meant to choose a different topic. I clicked the wrong thing. My fault 
---
I appreciate the reply dude, sincerely.
---
I watched the last 7 or so games of Zubat's VOD and he didn't really face fast survivors, so he must have decided it wasn't necessary. I didn't realize how much he slugged to do the challenge.
---
&gt; Just watch the VOD of his perkless rank 20-1 challenge, the skill difference is just immense.
---
At the end of the VOD Zubat makes plenty of mistakes too. He said he hadn't played much on Ormond and it showed in one of those last games, yet the survivors he was facing were not doing gens. I do see your point though that tru3 never thinks about when it's a good time to slug in his daily play, so when he was doing this challenge he didn't seem to take many (any?) opportunities to do it. I also grant you that tru3's blinks are marginally less accurate and he doesn't know as many patrol routes and lookout spots as Zubat does.
---
By all that I mean to say I think we'll have to agree to disagree that that's an "immense" skill difference. Can we agree on noticeable?
---
This much wasn't really necessary though lol: "You will see Tru3 use these add-ons constantly and say it's still hard to win against "optimal" survivors." That's just a hyperbolic pot shot. He doesn't use them constantly, has said something along the lines of "these addons are so strong and not necessary" when using them before, and it is still difficult to win against survivors that play properly. Otherwise, one wouldn't need to shave seconds off their game by slugging, right?
---
I asked why he died his hair and beard purple. I’m far from racist. I didn’t mean to choose question. I meant to choose a different topic. That was my fault 
---
I'll take that into consideration. Or maybe just try and buy both. Idk
---
Have fun , my best advice is to try not to to get to competitive or care about rank much , play the game for fun , there are some bugs but it’s still a great game :)
---
Huh ok 
---
didnt even notice that lmao
---
i meant what was your question in pugs chat?
---
You utilize a recent addition to the character selection menu in order to claim perks, items, or prestige repeatedly. You need bloodpoints to do it, but you can do it as many times as you want.
---
I wouldn't recommend trying it because bans, but if you really want to I can't stop you for looking it up on this subreddit or online.
---
Great stats, I love them - but do you really do them by hand? I mean dbd hasnt have any API
---
Run faster?
---
Borrowed Gun really made me laugh!
---
Lmao
---
So I'm pretty new to the game. Why is hiding in lockers a bad thing? 
---
Deranking, no. DCing, yes. Game auto tracks DCs and auto bans for excessive DCs.
---
I swear it's usually quicker than that. Have you been spending it? I would just wait a little more 
---
Oh you know as soon as you put the 2nd to lastone on the hook hes going to commit sedoku and you slig him on a hill so he dcs depriving you of adept myers for thr 5th time that day......im not salty you are
---
Seems to be a short 2 day ban, as it has been confirmed by a brave soul posting pics of him getting the ban reason message  and duration.
---
Those were Legacy items, only available in 2016. Not part of the Hallowed Blight.
---
Just slap in any common generic killer complaint, I  doubt it'll even reach 100 upvotes much less 1k. 
---
Rush? They've been working on this for, like, a year.
---
Lol I relate on a spiritual level.
---
“Get the glue”
---
“We’re out of glue”
---
“YOU, you used all of the glue on purpose”
---
Those aren’t Hallowed Blight cosmetics, those are what we call Legacy Prestige cosmetics. Prestiging used to be a lot grindier, so once they changed the system in 1.3.0, anybody who had already prestiged their characters got these new exclusive cosmetics.
---
Unfortunately, if you don’t already have them, there’s no way to get them now.
---
*makes generic post about killers* “Why did I only get 7 upvotes?!” You literally answered your own question.
---
I know right, watching Ochido makes you lose brain cells.
---
This is kinda common but as a general rule pizza dwights, pigs, and (most) aces are generally meme lords who are nice in endgame chat
---
Low-key kinda concerned about OP
---
I'm glad to see these GG stats. I very rarely see post game chat beside casual banter and GGs, but people act like every post game chat is a toxic wasteland. This whole time I thought I was crazy lol
---
Okay.
---
As it is I don’t think of Ochido when I see a bunch of Claudette’s, I just don’t like them because they’re so dang dark. That crap is annoying man especially on coldwind
---
I never asked a question lol what? 
---
You wanna use DS they're going to tunnel and camp, it's a two way street. And there's nothing wrong with the penalty, don't farm or sandbag and it won't be an issue.
---
Well I guess your bet? I dunno what to call it.
---
Ruin, Enduring and Spirit Fury are absolutely necessary in my opinion. The 4th can be anything of your choice. I personally run Nurse's Calling, but use whatever works for you
---
Of survivors actually play smart and stick to gens you will lose. Doesn't matter which killer you pick. Even nurse can get 3 gens popped on her before she finds somebody
---
Honestly I click RE non-stop now before the game begins to see who I will be cursed to play. I have no problem with this for now.
---
Really though, Shirtless David is the most smashable. 
---
Was watching Friday's stream, when he first had the dyed hair, and MANY people were asking about the dying of his hair and none were banned for asking that. Chances are, you said/did something else that caused you to get banned.
---
Make a relatable meme format.
---
I didn’t get banned. I got temp muted. For saying that I wasn’t a pleb and told the guy to F off. I typed it just like that. I didn’t type the full word. 
---
It's not really a bad thing, but it's more of a last resort.
---
There's different scenarios so I'll list some.
---
Maybe you just started the game and you're repairing a gen, and the killer comes nearby. Hiding in a locker is a bad idea because he knows you're there, and once he can't find you he may check a locker. Automatically getting you hooked, when you could've hid behind a rock or something which could've started a chase
---
Another scenario is when you're in a chase. Sometimes hiding in a locker while hopeless in a loop may save your life. Take the shack for an example. Let's say you're not going to reach the window is time and so you decide to enter a locker. It's not always about hiding, but the guessing. The killer will have to guess the locker you're in, and if he picks the wrong one you can easily leave the locker quickly and run away, perhaps for more loops. Sometimes they're used to by more time, don't just sit in a locker while the killer is nearby. When you feel like the killer may check the locker, leave before he gets there.
---
Probably the last scenario is bbq. Hiding in lockers blocks killers from reading auras. Maybe you don't want the killer going towards you because you're doing a gen or something. Just hide in a locker. However, sometimes if the killer can not find auras he'll assume they're nearby or won't bother to hunt. Sometimes you just got to take the heat for your friends.
---
Wish you luck in the realm.
---
Of fucking course it's an underrated comment. You replied to it minutes after its posted... 
---
Level 1-46 gets you 9100 shards. That's all I know not sure about time played.
---
This is 100% why I loathe going against Pigs. Give me Legion over Pig. I'll be far less salty.   
---
If you're going to stick a bear trap on someone and then tunnel them, there is absolutely no reason for the bear trap. Just kill me and get it over with.
---
Not a lag related bug.
---
vsync automatically caps it at 60, and playing at 60 without vsync will just create tearing. 
---
"I'll prove you wrong...wait no it's a lost cause"

That this isn't how it happened at all. Want some quotes?

you: "Does the carpet match the drapes? Lmao. Why purple?"
---
someone else: "That question is getting old"
---
You directly replying to the person above: "F off. I didn’t know. Get a life"
---
You then continued to argue with people in chat and after multiple warnings by the mods and others to stop arguing with people in chat and to be more civil, you were muted.
---
Why are you lying about this? Is this attention seeking behavior? It almost looks like you intentionally provoked a mute just so you could come here and rant about him. Seems odd.
---
It is

---
frustrating for me is when my friends know they have a mori and the killer lets them unhook me just to then Mori me
---
Almost every DBD streamer has done it.

Marth88 did it with almost every killer in the game, just look at his ironman series.
---
Marth's in a wierd spot in this community, i can't recall him ever doing anything wrong but theres a big portion here who seem to hate him.
---
I didn’t argue! I defended my self. I made a joke while asking about purple and someone said I was a pleb and talked crap. Why did you leave stuff out? Why are you lying?

Is your in-game fps uncapped?
---
&gt; much better nurses
---
I don't think Nurse skill gap is that big. Zubat (or Marth at his peak) hits most of his blinks and can track survivors very well, how can a Nurse be that much better than them? I mean, they can be a bit more consistent due to how much hours they've spent on Nurse alone.
---
&gt;  I would shit my pants if I fought him.
---
It's funny you say that, but going against either that guy or Zubat, you would be helpless against them both.
---
you should feel shame. 
---
No it happened 3 times before I got stuck in the basement for 3 mins because of the new glitch........
---
Check out No0b3... You'll like him more than that cheapshit OHHH OHHH OHHH MY GODDDD OH MYYY FUCKING GODDDDD ear rapes... 
---
Just because I didn't quote your entire chat history doesn't mean I'm leaving stuff out. Your title says you were muted for asking a question, you were clearly NOT muted for asking a question. You're being intentionally misleading to make yourself look better. 
---
I'd say taking a picture with a phone instead of using the platforms screen-shot function alone makes you bad,
---
So you asked why I lied and left out things that were said to mean I a negative manor and wonder why I defended myself? You trolling me or are you just dumb?

"Point quietly... and carry a BIG GUN!"
---
-- Teddy Roosevelt if he was in this game
---
&gt;has said something along the lines of "these addons are so strong and not necessary" when using them before
---
When Tru3 was doing his "No Hex: Ruin" challenge he only used things I would consider overpowered add-ons to compromise for the lack of that perk, so that argument falls to the ground.
---
And again like Scott said in another context of this thread, it doesn't matter how many examples one will provide to a Tru3 fan because they will always just drop the argument "well, Zubat didn't face good survivors".
---
I don't blame Tru3 for not wanting to look bad, who does? The problem (at least to me) is when you're trying so hard to not make yourself look bad, you actually do end up making yourself look bad.
---
And yeah, obviously Zubat makes mistakes too. Everyone does, nobody is perfect. I just prefer how Zubat can calmly call out how he misplayed something where as Tru3 99% of the time will just go on a rant about how strong survivor is.
---
I donno. Not rly fan of that spesific skin. Would love og nea
---
me cuube
---
And I'm well aware that this will get downvoted into oblivion but I don't care I need to vent
---
No, it can give you more space from the killer. If you spam click the flashlight though, you're just being a dick, and should expect a face camp.
---
Had this happen with Billy's chainsaw achievement 
---
I was right I got downvoted for no discernible reason
---
Then you hug him and he shanks you in the back
---
Ok, bye.
---
Also, it's kind of delusional to expect a dev team such as this one to come out with a patch that's "absolutely perfect" without stating what your standards are.
---
They're reworking him, it'll be done by 2030.
---
Wait, wait, wait, wtf is reality stone??
---
Does the screen tearing not hurt your eyes? It's terrible for me if I play with vsync off. 
---
Get Whispers.
---
Iron will is very good against her. I do agree though spirit takes 0 skill to play, she’s very easy, her power is so easy to use it’s almost as simple as frenzy. And her prayer bead add ons are the frankly one of the most op add on in the game, amazing effect, no downside. I’m actually shocked they let that go into the game. 
---
Just yesterday I had some one do this and then message me “why tunnel bro”
---
Like they got unhooked took off across an open field and basically ran up and head butted my machete full sprint and then blamed me for it. 
---
A dev team "such as this one"? My standards aren't that high, I just want reasonable balance decisions and for every patch to not fuck up existing mechanics. I already mentioned that in my post. Surely you've realized that the game is in an even shittier state than it was already after the latest patch? Have you seen the videos on this subreddit of people being unable to leave the basement no matter what they do? Have you noticed that the hitboxes are still consistently getting worse? Have you noticed that for every good balance change we get, we get another bad balance change and another bug that makes the game worse?
---
Good choice, I usually get them pretty quickly. Just wait a little more 
---
Did you count survivor disconnects prior to entering the game? Like infinite loading? Because I encounter that more then temate dcs by far.
---
I’d watch YouTube videos of people playing her, you can gain a lot of knowledge that way. Ardethat has a 40 video to playlist on YouTube just playing nurse and he’s really good with her. 
---
Maybe it's because survivors say more stupid shit than killers. 
---
Are you surprised?
---
There is no tearing on my screen lol. My monitor is 144hz I shouldn't have screen tearing since my monitor can handle it. I have freesync enabled tho. 
---
Survivors are already OP 🤕
---
You farm shards faster as killer 500-600 xp per game vs 300 ish if you die or 500 if you make it out. 
---
Yeah that's why. Without freesync or g-sync it would look terrible.
---
I didn't realize Legion was so toxic by default, I might have to set down my Nurse for a while and pick him/her up!

---
You also can't remap wiggling, which means we still destroy our sticks trying to escape the killers grasp.
---
I only counted disconnects that seemed intentional. They usually happened after getting downed by the killer and sometimes just being noticed by the killer in the first minute.
---
Remove any type of communication with teammates. No chat, no voice chat. 
---
Being alone is scary enough
---
Just to go above and beyond, play Friday the 13th to get even both of both sides, *Insert whatever meme format here*
---
I always level a killer to 40 for teachable perks then play that killer while lvling another...Legion is my next one so if people D/C I’m just going to report them and move on. It’s not fair to the survivors who want a challenge and I never mind playing against him/her when I’m a survivor. Granted I kind of just play for fun and hover in the midranks.
---
I'm not doing this for attention, fuckwad. I'm doing it because the game sucks, and it's getting worse. I don't want to hate this game, I want to love it, and the devs are off eating glue instead of doing anything to promote the health of the game. 
---
By hand, really. I like keeping count.
---
Of course it takes a lot of time with games that last over ten minutes and me having to sit through it all everytime to mark down things, but I listened to music,drank coffee and enjoyed the jukes :D
---
That's nowhere near as stupid as, "you literally need to throw the game or you're toxic." And plenty of memes about NOED get hundreds of upvotes. Don't know what you're smoking. 
---
There's a million things we could go into, but like everyone else said, practice is the gonna be the game changer here. There's no getting around that, but I can give one or two small tips.
---
  
---
Know what type of player you're facing. Some just zigzag left and right. Some do some more advanced sht. If you're playing against the former, you should have no trouble hitting them. Sometimes you have to give up throwing against the latter if you want to win the current game, or just chase them to windows and pallets where hits are easy. Though long-term it's worth it to throw away a few games just to get practice throwing hatchets at those players and missing.
---
 Realize that even if you don't throw your hatchets, the threat of them wins you many battles instantly. If there's only one exit, such as a window or door, winding up your hatchet and walking forward is all you need to do to secure a hit. Most survivors will run around in circles expecting you to throw and miss. Walk forward. Corner 'em. Smack em as they try to dodge a hatchet that'll never come.  
---
For what? His issuance toxic stuff 
---
Was playing Killer recently and saw I had two people left alive, one of which I hadn't seen all game. Now I was playing Freddy so I just assumed that person was really stealthy or I was just blind. But I noticed I found the open hatch and it was staying open for more than 30 sec. 
---
So I found the other survivor and dropped them on the hatch and as soon as they jumped the game ended and it still showed both me and that survivor that the one I didn't find was in game. I guess they DC'd and the game never registered it. 
---
This patch has been weird 
---
David: heh, nerd! 
---
Making entire posts about it just to complain and complain to us about how the game isn't perfect and iM gOnNa LeAvE sInCe bHvR iSnT dOiNg wHaT i WaNt iT tO does indeed = whining
---
nah fam its just a game get over it :P 
---
People treat others like this in every aspect of life. Video games are more used by schoolies who haven't learnt to calm down. 
---
I have disabled accepting messages from non-friends. Helped a lot as every overwatch session I have had such reactions.
---
Didn't say jack shit about not having enough resources. By quoting that exact part of your reply, I was implying I said "a dev team such as this one" because it's in an even shittier state than it was already after the last patch. I *did*, in fact, clarify. 
---
Assuming redditors have sex:
---
There is no point, it is just your incoherent temper tantrum.
---
I don't want the game to be perfect, you absolute fucking buffoon. I just want it to not suck, but the shitty developer apologists are over here trying to get me to shut up. BHVR is a massive company that likely has hundreds of thousands of dollars in its possession. They don't need you defending them from the critic meanies that hurt their feelings. 
---
Yeah it is. Slasherins just put up the new Jeff skins too :D
---
Sometimes suicides helped. Very rarely, though.
---
For example when someone loops killer for three minutes and then DCs. We all got gens done and the kilelr didnt get to find more players with BBQ.
---
But 99% of the time, it doesnt help.
---
Cheap ass.
---
How was it/ Why did you think it was Survivor sided?
---
No, it's not. You're just only seeing what you want to see. 
---
Seems shady to me.
---
Nah I think I'll just play Last Year:The Nightmare if it ever comes out on PS4 which it proably won't.
---
I can agree with that, especially since red rank Huntress and Nurse mains are just.....existing
---
I had a really laggy game once and somehow got glitched into a locker...I could move around like I wasn’t in a locker but of course...stuck in a locker lol Had to disconnect.

---
game doesn't just start slow, it goes slow. you will be eventually hit because of Killer's Instinct. if you didn't notice most loops are around important gens. if someone is being chased they will lead Legion to you. you can run but you can't hide. lockers don't work, nothing works. and people complain not of how to survive but how to behave in chase cause there is but a very weak counterplay that at best saves you 10 seconds and doesn't actually let you win the chase.
---
Distortion absolutely doesn't work with Killer's Instinct.
---
running Lithe+Q&amp;Q+Dance With Me is never going to counter a damn killer that doesn't see your scratch marks.
---
cheesus, fam, you're absolutely incompetent. what are these advices?? you seem to not understand how the killer works yet you say these things counter them in any way. 
---
Laurie looks like sakura  from Naruto
---
It’s a very in-depth game, but I assume you mean the basics, so I’ll explain them. In a match, there are typically 4 survivors and 1 killer. The killer has to try and kill the survivors and the survivors have to complete 5 generators and escape. Please let me know if you didn’t understand any of that or you would like me to go more in-depth. Good luck and have fun!
---
Their system can now detect the number of disconnects someone has. If they DC too much they will be automatically temp banned.
---
I LITERALLY copypasted that dude's comment
---
jesus, that’s bold. it’s bubba’s basement! 
---
I was up against a leather face with 1 friend and he downed him now I know leather faces have a rep for camping hook but this man camped a downed survivor even though he had bbq and chili wasn't until my friend died that he hooked the other survivor and then camped her in basement I dont understand this at all 
---
grabbin an smg 
---
Thanks that was really helpful. Tragic that Spirit was affected. She’s who I play when I wanna win. 
---
This could be super simplfied 
---
The devs should legally buy Bundy so he can be in the game.
---
Play Claudette with dark outfit for uh
---
Reasons
---
And profit from ez stealth
---
Yeah pretty much the reason why I don't run adrenaline often.
---
But that's what they are best at!
---
Compared to most responses I've seen to this question yours is exactly what I believed in, but do you not find the gameplay terrible with all these game breaking bugs we've had for so long and that they keep adding?
---
Then go away because I get angry at this game all the time, but it doesn't make me say omg I have this game and I'm going to quit and anyone on Reddit who disagrees with me is wrong! LMAO wtf is your deal. It's a video game, go play something else while the rest of us play the game 
---
why?
---
This gave me just as much anxiety as if it was me in this situation and I'm suing u for emotional distress lmao
---
Rank 6, but alrighty. 
---
Just get better at the game and stop whining.
---
I find Monto especially nice since he always explains the perks and addons before the game, and this helps me a lot since I’m fairly new
---
r/noonecares
---
&gt; I mean, let's keep this serious man. I said he doesn't use them constantly, you said he did during his no ruin challenge, which means not constantly, which means I was right. 
---
I was being serious, Tru3 constantly uses strong add-ons. Or we can at least say it's a 9/10 times.
---
When he was playing "normally" without a challenge he faced a 3 blink Nurse and called him tryhard. Yet he proceeded to play Nurse the very next match with omegablink arguing he was "better" even though it's equally bullshit if not worse.
---
Not gonna bother replying to the essay part about Scott, so I'm leaving that out. Please TL;DR that stuff in the future.
---
&gt; I don't see what you mean. Using OP addons makes him look bad? If so, disagree. If not, please explain. 
---
I am not talking perks/add-ons. I am talking about how he argues how unbalanced the game is to cover up his own misplay.
---
&gt; You don't really think that lol. Again, you can just say you don't like that he complains about how strong survivor is. That's cool. 
---
That's right I don't like that he complains about something that has been proven to be false by so many other people, he just seems to think his word is final in every debate ever. You can see that in the recent disconnect/de-rank debate on Twitter.
---
And with that being said, I really can't keep throwing the ball back and forth like this. If you wish to continue this debate I'd prefer hitting me up in private because having my Reddit inbox spammed with a thread that gets older by the day is obnoxious.
---
Well I’m talking about good Leather face players that don’t need to camp
---
We both know that's what you'll do.
---
Why else would anyone want to main Leatherface.
---
And no, there are no streamers on YouTube or twitch dumb enough to main Leatherface.
---
No one really cares I think 
---
Nah I think best stun noise by far is wraith 
---
I’ve been playing playing Leatherface this whole day and haven’t camped unless I know there’s someone near hook
---
He meant the DS
---
why is she kawaii
---
Yea I've watched it. Found it quite interesting tbh. Just wished it wasn't 4 episodes lol
---
You see, some people like to have fun while playing video games...
---
Yes, because there are a ton of other asymmetrical multiplayer horror games with the same base mechanics and beloved licensed characters. Why didn't I think of picking up one of the other games like that? 
---
*insert "play civilization" joke here* 
---
Lol
---
I guess this is Dbd's new rival now. 
---
It must just be a PS4 thing because Xbox is just fine but we did get an 8 gigabyte patch when 2.5.0 dropped
---
aaaAhaha
---
Ah
---
Dat's Hot
---
And you think by acting like an asshat in the internet the next patch will fix everything
---
Considering you have completely missed the point of this post, you either want to see this or you're just really bad at spotting the point of arguments. 
---
Just noticed who you are and I can only give it back 
---
I was very obviously being hyperbolic, shush
---
Quit moving the goalpost, my dude
---
Any idea if somebody's done this with ace's add-on perk? I wanna see how well it works before leveling ace
---
I play on eu but it was that long ago I can't really remember who the other survivor was or what the Spirit was wearing, I think it was her normal set up but I could be wrong. Although I do play as Claudette more than other survivors
---
Doesn't seem like it happens very often, but there was a free weekend just this past weekend on PC.
---
OchiDooDoo
---
There is no other moral or "lesson" of this post, It is you ranting about different aspects of the game, if there is another deeper point then please explain, I would love to hear about it :P
---
No, it really couldn't
---
Okeeeeeey
---
The deeper point is that BHVR is utterly incompetent, as I have stated multiple times in the comments as well as in the fucking title
---
I have not.....yet! But should give it a try. My Claudette has everyone’s perk and in tier 3. I can let ya know. 
---
Why should I respect your "goalpost" I don't give a crap what your intentions were/are. You invalidated your credibility by throwing a tantrum about the state of the game without offering anything constructive.
---
Yee
---
He's not. How the fuck did he become a mod 'Ps4_and_ipad_lover' That's the name of a 10 year old. He doesn't even use capital letters, it's really unprofessional. Does this sub have quality control? Oh, not to mention he removes posts that don't even break the rules.
---
no one really likes Nurse, you know? she's been with us for more than two years so people kind of accepted that she's here.
---
but Nurse not only requires skill and time to learn, she also requires a mad level of prediction. if you choose wrong side behind obstacles - you lost the chase if survivor is not brain-dead. just like you need to be completely brain-dead to lose chase as Legion unless survivors run Iron Will+No Mither. 
---
you need to be invested in game fully as Nurse. constant control. or you lost. there's no place for chill game like Trapper or Spirit. or even Billy. very stressful. 
---
people never really bitched if Pig, Clown, Spirit(they only bitched of Beads), so, you know.... your argument is weak. Spirit is perfectly balanced and fun to play as and against. Clown just about the same but bit weaker. Piggy can do wonders and she damn cute to play as and against. 
---
I mean Doctor might be unfun for some but playing on red ranks, unless you know perfectly all your range and timing and from where to stop the loop, you'll lose. and if Doctor you face is not smart, he'll lose. if he is smart, props to him cause it's not the easiest killer to master and he actually requires brain to play against skilled players. not track, chase. yes, tracking is easy but I'll be damned if he's unloopable. cause he very much is. 
---
Oof
---
You forgot atleast one of your posts being on the front page fucking all the time.
---
That would be awesome, I'd appreciate it if you would. Thanks!
---
I did. Somewhere in the comments, I suggested putting a delay on the next chapter and rerouting all resources to fixing the biggest underlying issues of the game for the sake of creating a game that is healthier in the long term
---
That's it? I get the point completely, and even I have given my fair shair of defense to BHVR so I am not exactly getting what you mean by me not understanding any of it. And please calm down.
---
No. No more money should go to that whackjob
---
Gotcha, good to know, thanks for letting me know!
---
*checks flair* they like feng more than they like legion.
---
you're right, it's an insult to all trash
---
Yeah, dude had a serious mental illness. Can we please not connect a real life serial killer who killed and raped 30+ women to dbd? Because that's really uncool.
---
Lol get over yourself.
---
fam, I also play Spirit a lot, she's my go-to killer for when I don't mind facing swf but I'll slap on some meta shit like ruin and Beads cause I don't want to get bullied. and playing against Spirits is hella fukin fun, really. unless they tunnel like cunts by going back to the hook and chasing the unhooked person when like no gens are done. but that's not killer's design problem, that's dickhead players. cause Spirit has enough power potential to not be a cunt. 
---
but yeah, listening goes both sides. you can hear footsteps and that's where it's easy to pinpoint her location. so many times I'd just stop on Game hearing some weird footsteps and Spirit leaving the phase 5 meter away from me and never seeing or hearing me. that shit is awesome. only people who don't pay enough attention in game are getting bothered with Spirit imo.
---
How frail are you seriously. You must have grown up being coddled and the bad things in the world having been hidden from you.
---
Spin them in circles, not side to side.
---
Disgusting noise behind the bushes intensifies.
---
Somebody hasn’t seen New Nightmare 
---
Wow.... didn't know people don't know what's a joke.
---
The hag and huntress in the same tier as billy. Yucky yucky yucky. 
---
Everytime i lag even a little i get called a lagswitcher its so dumb lol. If you really think its lagswitching then send a video recording of it taking place, im doubtful it will do anything though they arent going to ban when its possibly just lag
---
To be fair, you do type like a Neanderthal. 
---
It’s not a bad thing, just not very good most of the time. But oh boy I love running quick and quiet and jumping into a locker while in a chase and lose the killer. Doesn’t always work but when it does it makes me feel good. 
---
One of the bigger flaws
---
Survive With Friends
---
Just play Quentin if you want to play as a goblin
---
Dont see many rank 1 players with surveillance, is this after the patch?
---
LOL what is that video? "Give him another chance after being banned multiple times and perma banned and evading ban." "He brings in new players every year" while this may be true the new players he brings in are toxic survivors who make this community toxic. And insults killers. No. OchiDO got banned. That is that. He doesnt deserve another chance. He had too many already.
---
it wasnt just lag, i dont know if you have seen puppers or tru3 when they go against lagswtichers but i was at a pallet and he started randomly walking into a box for a while and then i went down, he was a ways away from me and my connection was fine and his was fine in the lobby, it was for sure lagswitch lol. 
---
Thanks bro
---
Its an achievement its not supposed to be easy
---
I’ve been using plunderers and ace in the hole for months now, and the answer is it’s great. So many great items with great addons. 
---
You're welcome! 
---
Yeah. You can tell because they changed the looks of the perks/addons/offerings spots.
---
Video evidence is pretty much the only good way to get things taken care of. If you go back to the "Hot Posts" section of r/deadbydaylight, you can find a thread about the banning procedures. 
---
I know it a crazy concept but no one cares you got banned from a twitch chat. Streamers can ban who they want
---
Thank you. ☺️
---
No problem! 
---
Dude he's fucking dead, of course it was a joke.
---
It's not lacking tact at all. It's a logical comparison to be made from words spoken by Ted. Must have hit a nerve to illicit such a response from you. I am going to break it to you right now. There are terrible things and people all over this world get used to it and don't acknowledge they don't exist. If you can't acknowledge the worst then you will never be prepared when the time comes to act against it. Sorry Dorothy but life isn't all unicorns and rainbows. Especially when we play a game where we simulate mutilating and killing fictional people over and over again. Get off your high horse.
---
I actually agree with that. If I manage to snatch someone away from the gate and they're open, I absolutely will cut my losses. I hate face camping otherwise, when it's necessary, it's necessary. 
---
Besides, my traps can only do it for me so much. 
---
Well I play ps4 and the patch notes said they fixed it. I completed one the other day!
---
I don't like angrypug at all. From the first time i watched him to now. But what you asked and said seems to be both inappropriate and rude. Telling someone to "F off" is still rude saying the f word or not. A lot of things you say dont help your case. You get mad someone calls you a "pleb" but you call them that. Calling him a fake streamer with no content. That doesnt help either. 
---
NOED -&gt; Adrenaline
---
DS -&gt; Ruin
---
Why are most of the hot characters at the bottom....I don’t like your tastes lol
---
I was super sad about the leader nerf. I main Dwight and now I just feel like more of a laughing stock. But hey we still have prove thyself! Lol
---
Let people celebrate
---
*Audible Agreement*
---
I’ve killed hundreds of zombies, maybe thousands. But that *points to clown* that scares me.
---
uhm, what? 
---
what's a good Huntress without a bad connection, amirite? 
---
the hitboxes on both Billy and her are god damn broken. the tiniest lag and you dead. that's really frustrating. the worst thing is when you juke a Billy and get sucked in his chainsaw anyway. or when you are literally behind a solid corner but still getting a hatchet in your head. like, fuck that, mate. I better dance with Rin. not only she's an adorable killer to be around, she's also full of fun to play against. 
---
there's no skill in faking phasing, yes. but there is a skill in properly listening or predicting people, in fusing her power with that right. I've seen way too many people doing fuck knows what, I'd say they do the equivalent of Billy only using his chainsaw to travel fast, not actually down people. 
---
and her hitbox isn't broken. not even in the slightest. it's super balanced and I never question her hits. unlike both Billy and Huntress. 
---
#G A R B O
---
The other being turning around mid-chase and shining your flashlight at the killers stomach!! I know- I've seen many people do it in my games!!
---
When he’s in the game you mean 
---
Well you must be dumb enough to assume that camping is the only way to win, which clearly you must have had your ass beaten by someone who did camp, and the salt is still pouring out of your wound. What does it matter that no one streams leatherface? He’s a beginner style killer
---
I know right
---
It's kind of a rite of passage of sorts, "taking your lumps", to lose or die all the time right at the beginning. But as you come to grips with everything, get better perks, and more experience, you'll die and lose less and less and escape and win more and more. Plus, at low ranks, everybody's new, the killer included. You just gotta give it time.
---
Apparently you aren’t the “best” at anything 
---
I just laughed out loud. This is great!

I'm gonna make a post when I get to rank 20 just to shit on all those people making posts about being rank 1

Maybe......

Or when your No One Escapes Death disappears within seconds and you realize it's going to be the worst match of your life.

Dont know why youre being downvoted. What you speak is truth.

I figured you meant buy the rights of his likeness from his estate or make a rip-off of him like that damn clown that they insist isn't based off of Gacy.

When I play suvivor that's pretty much all I do aside from totems. I'm not good at escaping so. the least I can do is break hooks and totems. Little gen work here and there.

Then why didn't you just remove that one instead of spending 2 weeks wasting your time trying to complete it?

I got banned, but I'm certain someone reported me for it. I helped a shit ton of people do the prestige glitch. All of my friends who did it haven't been banned and they haven't told anyone so they're fine.

Don’t worry about it. You need to die in order to understand how mechanics works, also at rank 20 (where you start) there are a lot of beginner killers too so it’s like you go against pros anyway.
---
Your teammates probably just started playing too.
---
One advice I can give you is to search for beginners tip on this subreddit, there are a lot of helpful ones!
---
Gl and see you in the fog!
---
P.s. don’t care about game chat, if you want just drop a gg and leave

It's temp. I'm banned atm. Only 2 days, and none of my friends who didn it have been banned. Pretty sure it's report only.

You want a mentos my dude?

You must be a real hard S.O.B. sitting and watching true crime docs and listening to podcasts lol. Probably coming from someone who doesn't hunt or fish in the slightest.

Just tested it out in like 3 matches - 8 chests later - and it’s been lots of brown and yellow add-ons that get on rare items. And then for a yellow/green item, they still get yellow and brown add-ons. Only once with the green key did I get a purple add-on, but that’s it. 
---
So they’re not a powerful pair after all. I’m playing on PS4, not sure that changes anything. 
---
Everybody kind of acts like a headless chicken at the beginning. You'll learn where to run and where pallets are with experience. Yeah, there'll be some people who take it personally and punish you for it, but I wouldn't worry about them. Just go on to the next match. I'd also recommend working out what your playstyle is and what perks work well with it.
---
Believe me, I was super nervous trying to play Freddy at the beginning, considering not only is he commonly held to be the worst killer, but I was a super new killer at the time. A few months, a ton of perk grinding, and more than a fair bit of experience later, I'm 4king a lot with him.
---
No prob! Glad to help. Plunderer’s has been so awesome for me, personally. As every match my goal is to bring an item out - and with them being rare, it’s like I’ve struck gold. 
---
But ALSO - thanks to it, it’s helpful in-game. Literally just now, my 2 teammates and I struggling to get the final gen done cause they’re all super close and we’re going against the doctor. Then I find the ultra rare skeleton key, gesture to the other 2 to find the hatch, and we escaped easily! :) 
---
uh if you are getting death threats every week maybe just
---
report that to the police
---
Shit, when you said it about clown being like that pedo clown you kinda right, only this guy kinda has a different story, doesn't fuck kids, and has finger collection, but mainly they are kinda the same. You know what would be funny? Having a Bundy Rip Off bit it's a weird dude in a Teddy costume, but maybe huntress already got a costume like, nvm.
---
I mean, getting it is EZ
---
That's true, though I guess the difference is that Leatherface is loosely based on a real killer, and it's not just like... 'Hey remember that guy that killed, raped, and abused the corpses of 30+ women, many with families who are still alive?' I'm all about horror and monsters and violence and gore, but when it's too based in reality (especially with a sexual violence aspect), *especially* without acknowledgement that it's tactless, it just gets gross.
---
perm banned?
---
2 Days LMFAO
---
I know that feeling all too well, as soon as i get to 15 im right back at 16
---
Self care is dope as a killer i love seeing full teams with it. Seriously i do. I simply run nurses calling oddly i don't see many people running it. Not sure why its not considered meta when so many people are self healing.
---
I tested it out with PI, and it mostly just gives you brown/yellow add-ons. Assuming they don’t want people with rare items and then add-ons on top of it. So it wasn’t worth it. 
---
uhm. because their power is not designed to be used for actually hitting someone? you will call a Trapper unskilled even though he literally caught every single survivor on the map in his traps because he only has M1 in chase or something? 
---
Rin does need a skill to properly time her phasing and not get a pallet stun. just like a damn Billy. she needs to hit in the right moment so someone didn't vault the window. literally the same but she can't see survivors. if they have Iron Will, they can just crouch and walk away, you know? even if they were in chase there's some time for Rin to activate phasing. as soon as you see her standing still, you just crouch and walk away, like holy heck. you can't do that with Billy.
---
also her phasing is not endless. you can't just hook someone on one side of the map and instantly get to another side where someone else got unhooked. for that you'll have to use a specific add-on build which removes your ability to see scratch marks and I want to see you fukin play against smart survivors without seeing their scratch marks. 
---
and btw, 110 speed, limited speed + no instadown.
---
I love self care as killer because it actually makes the game somewhat fun
---
Good, now I know where to look in the future.
---
Oh yeah the clown has some really big Gacy vibes. One of his costumes looks a lot like Pogo the Clown, which is really tactless and terrible and I don't condone that at all. 
---
But like, just a murdering clown that cuts off fingers indiscriminately? I don't mind that, because it's totally an urban legend type of monster.

*Heavy Discordance breathing*

Its because of his shady history and his "elitist" behaviour. Try watching ardetha's video on him. Its biased but only one whos got the facts right.
---
It’s a game, just relax. I imagine that almost everyone is a bit nervous when they first start playing. A couple hours in and you’ll probably think that it’s hilarious that you were worried. 
---
Lmao, someone get this man a step stool so he can get down from that tall-ass horse.. 👇🐎😂
---
Bill fucking kills the killer 
---
No real counter play. They can take while to down you, especially without the right addons, but they will down you with little to nothing you can do about it. 
---
No wonder, his second name is camperface
---
This is going to get removed by the mods. Probably for shaming someone or possibly instigating a witch hunt. 
---
thank you
---
I have to say here that Gacy only occasionally dressed as a clown, it wasn't like he dressed up as one and went out killing like that. It was just a hobby he had. I don't remember Gacy as a clown, I remember him as a fat KFC eating fuck.

not shaming anyone or calling for a witch hunt. simply calling someone out for lagswitching and to get help on how to ban them being i wasnt sure how to go about it being this wasnt on pc. 
---
You included their name in a negative connotation. That’s enough to classify as shaming. 
---
Correct, sure you placed that trap as the trapper, but the fact the survivor ran into it had nothing to do with your skill, it’s simply a survivors mistake that the killer can capitalize on. Because you didn’t actually do anything to down him, he just ran into a trap.  I guess the lines blur if you happened to force him into a trap but that is pretty rare and hard to do against a good survivor. Compared to billy or huntress, where an action you were doing is what directly caused the survivor to get down, and usually isn’t an accident or mistake, you either hit or you don’t. And that’s based off the survivors skill and the killers skill to see if it hits or not.
---
You can always just trash it for a better one...
---
"It's not that Freddy gets bullied by survivors denying his hook"
---
Uh, yeah. Any other killer would've gotten a hook in that scenario. My obsession got up solely because I was Freddy and I had to wait out the dream transition to hit her two saviors.
---
"Freddy can help mitigate skill checks with add-ons, but it still ultimately is just luck on exactly how potent his power gets to be and that's not entirely fair to anybody."
---
That's my entire point. A killer whose entire power depends on allowing him to turn into an m1 killer with a tracking ability shouldn't have to rely on RNG to make that power serviceable. 
---
Just a few minutes ago I was in a match and chasing an injured Dwight as he was transitioning. It was nearing the end of the transition and I knew he was coming up on a vault. I swiped as he vaulted, but the transition ended after he vaulted. Any other killer would've gotten a down in that scenario. Freddy? He's got his glove swiping through nothing as the survivor runs off. Freddy needs massive help. 
---
Im gonna play adam when i get the DLC because i like his voice and backstory a shitload. Until then i main david with shirt on as he just looks cool and makes killers salty
---
thats enough to classify it as calling someone out, not shaming. theres a difference. i didnt shame them in anyway, i didnt give negative connotations either. i said they were lagswitching of which i have proof of. if you arent giving help on how to ban this person then this post doesnt concern you. 
---
Just get it and enjoy playing, you’ll be rank 20 so if you have “experienced” players on your team they have no right in judging you since they are DC’ing apes
---
Claudette and Nea deserve to be in F and Quentin moved up to C
---
The very last match I played tonight - someone burned shroud of binding. 3 of us start working on a generator, one person just steps away clensing a totem. Maybe a minute or less into the game, Legion shows face and two people disconnect. 5 generators and 2 people left? It SUCKED. Ruins the game for everyone else. 
---
Oh god oh fuck
---
Found the survivor main.
---
Did you grow up in that area or something? Because everyone else remembers him as the serial killer who dressed up as a clown, probably because of how nefarious it is to dress up as something that entertains kids, while preying on young boys--while yeah, he definitely didn't do that as dressed as a clown. It's just the weird thing that everyone remembers.
---
I don't have a glitched account though, too risky.
---
How can does that not make sense? 
---
I've grinded very hard for this account and spent money on cosmetics... Am I not allowed to consider glitching before making a decision whether or not the risk is worth it?
---
The entire point of the two extra seconds to the dream transition with Class Photo is to have two more seconds of aura-reading. You kind of *want* a longer transition with that add-on.
---
welp now people know but i promise one day you will forget and you will be one sad boi
---
Gathering items with survivor is probably my new favorite thing to do in this game rn xd
---
How many friends are you playing with? When I played with one or two other friends I found the que would take us a while too. Solo or a full squad seem to be the fastest que times for Survivor 
---
It's because you're playing SWF. I don't know why but queue times take forever for SWF on console.  Solo players will get games almost instantly at any rank.

---
Play Resident Evil 2 remake. It's a better game.
---
I usually play with one or two other friends. It’s rare for us to get 4 friends because we are in different ranks (myself and another friend are on the red ranks, while another is in the green ranks, and the other in the brown ranks).
---
I suppose it's something that makes him more memorable. I didn't grow up there I just have a hugely morbid fascination with serial killers. The Netflix Ted Bundy doc was awesome. I don't really think that the Clown had Gacy in mind specifically. I knew for months that they would add a clown to the game because people are so scared of clowns. It was bound to happen imo. The fact that they made the Clown a serial killer in his background is a bit suspect, but it just makes the most sense for why there is a circus clown in game. 
---
They’re fairly easy. I got them all except for Legion (don’t have him) and got most on first or second try. A lot of them were at rank 1 too
---
Understandable, at least bhvr gets their shit done with this guy.
---
Mm. Yeah, how dare I find sexual violence against women to be something not to take lightly.
---
What would his 3 perks be you think?
---
Here's what I got:
---
Fearless -  *Your experience with life threatening situations has hardened you to danger and dangerous entities. You hear no terror radius. Instead, this perk activates whenever the killer is within a 50/40/30 meter distance.* 
---
“We despise and abhor the bully, the brawler, the oppressor, whether in private or public life, but we despise no less the coward and the voluptuary. No man is worth calling a man who will not fight rather than submit to infamy or see those that are dear to him suffer wrong.”
---
Father to his men - *You'll get them back home, no matter the cost. When the exit gates are powered, increase healing speed and item efficiency by 50/75/100% when the exit gates are powered.* 
---
"There is not a man of us who does not at times need a helping hand to be stretched out to him, and then shame upon him who will not stretch out the helping hand to his brother."
---
Restless Warrior - *Your experience with boxing and beating your body into shape has given you some physical benefits. Allows for exhaustion regeneration at 25/35/50% normal speed while being chased.*
---
"For us is the life of action, of strenuous performance of duty; let us live in the harness, striving mightily; let us rather run the risk of wearing out than rusting out."
---
What most people have already said. Used to mean you were being camped but as my playtime increased I just started twitching on the hook more and more just for the fun of it lol
---
Survivors is always gonna be easy af. When I play survivor I'm usually also watching a movie.
---
you didn't say anything about my argument defending phasing. 
---
and with that, as Trapper you must lure people in traps on high ranks or they won't get trapped that often therefore you won't do so good unless you run crutch and clutch perks. that's why you see so many noeds and ruins on Trappers. cause people don't want to get smarter and skillful with his actual ability. 
---
and most hatchets, as I already said, are only hit due to bad connection. not like horrible one but where your hitbox is still present for Huntress while you're some other place on your screen. they actually fixed it in autumn mid-chapter patch by making survivor hitboxes normal but every Huntress player was raging so they reversed it back. also, the amount of lucky hatchets and amount of lucky insta snipes with Billy are higher than amount of lucky gen/totem grab with Rin.
---
and you're being a dick by saying other killers require less skill because their power is not designed to be m2 down option.
---
oh you're in for a hell of a shit show, my friend
---
It's fixed now. Back to being a very easy daily (unless the killer has discordance)
---
I think this might be the problem, I have the same when I queue up with my friends who are way higher ranks than me, but if I do it with friends who are approximately the same rank, we find matches way easier
---
There's nothing you can do to avoid being hit by the Legion power. The only ways to avoid getting hit are to hit a pallet stun mid-frenzy or try run under Legion when they vault a window. Stealth survivors also get the finger, because Legion's power will reveal any nearby survivor's exact location without error.
---
It gets worse. Because the way DBD handles chases, Legion can be right on your Six but your meter depletes anyway. Not to mention Legion mains have figured out they can chase you without being "in a chase" by looking at the floor or moonwalking at you.
---
Furthermore, Legion creates some boring game play. If Legion hits you, and then goes to hit another survivor, you get to sit there and mend without being in any *real* danger: Legion is obviously chasing someone else, but you still have to mend. A lot of survivors are finding Tummy Rub Simulator 2019 a little boring.
---
Lastly, and this is just my opinion as a survivor main and babby Legion player, but Legion isn't regarded as a strong killer. I regularly see scenarios where Legion has the whole team wounded but doesn't get any bang for that buck, so to speak.
---
i was about to say, "oh hell nahhhhhh" if it was  hahahahah 
---
Sounds great and absolutley not broken or anything.
---
LUL
---
And what about it?
---
When you assume you just make an ass out of yourself. 
---
See my comment above. 
---
I don't know about SFTS, but something needs to be done about crows in general. In my opinion, they're not a gameplay mechanic, they're just kind of *there*. No killer ever seriously finds survivors by looking for crows flying off or cawing. I don't go out of my way to avoid crows when I'm a survivor because I know they're not a real threat. They need a lot of work to truly be called servants of the Entity and accomplices of the killer. 
---
I would jump out my window if I got perm banned, 2,750 hours of grinding plus about £300 worth of cosmetics
---
Lol out here bitching at everyones comments. Someone has sand in their vagina
---

---
Yeah, I try to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that the Clown, like other killers, are mostly based on urban legend and things that people are afraid of. Clowns are definitely, after all, fairly frightening--it's something about how their expressions are painted on that messes with our brains, I think.
---
&amp; the Ted Bundy doc was DEF good, but so scary? When watching it, I was fine, I didn't think twice about it, but as a young single woman, it came back to haunt me around 3am when I was trying to sleep &amp; kept hearing my neighbors walking around outside by my window.
---
What material did you use?
---
Or maybe I am just not so sensitive as you. 
---
You say that like having three perks is a massive hinderance when it’s more of a common scenario that one perk feels useless/unused all game. Not to mention any hex perk that has the possibility of being removed very quickly. 
---
Yeah, it's because of this I finally bought the PC version when it's on Year End Sale and never looked back. It's much much much more enjoyable on PC. Survivor queue time is almost instant, throwing pallet down doesn't take like 10 years, then there are rarely FPS drops. 
---
Of course there are still bugs and glitches like invisible Trapper and or Billy but they're not that often. Console version don't get as much love as PC version, that's a bitter fact to swallow I guess.
---
You right. How could I forget how OP swf, DS, dead hard, and flashlights are. It’s not like killers can camp, tunnel, lag switch, bring moris, franklins demise, tomb stone pieces, etc. Sorry totally forgot about that. Maybe I should gEt gUd ;p I don’t even want to mention NOED cause all survivors have to do is cleanse totems right?? Easy fix there (no joke or sarcasm. It is a easy fix) How about moris? Lag switching? Very survivor favored i see. 
---
Bloodpoints.
---
Poetic
---
Wait, are you implying that you got your adept legion by moonwalking people and that’s why you think they’re brain dead?
---
The males are louder but the females are higher pitched which makes them more noticable so imo it balances out.
---
Just point the killer to his location by making noise nearby. This coward always hide towards the end or will just leave you behind. 
---
Hahahha, okay.

the searching is weird tbh personally tried to find games solo yesterday and couldn't find games waiting for 5+ minutes than when i searched with a friend finding games instantly. add a third friend matchmaking was horrid a fourth slightly better again.
---
and even with solo Que if i find solo games instantly today for example pings could be from around 60 - 700+ i don't know how it searches but sometimes is weird af
---
I only downvoted because you made a comment about probably getting downvoted. That shit irritates me. 
---
If you hadn’t done that, I wouldn’t have downvoted. 
---
This because the killer is the host. If you were lagging, chances are everyone was
---
It’d be cool but no, Jeff’s lore says its more than one 
---
man, between the overtly toxic player groups, shitty immature youtubers, and a community that childishly revels over something like this, i gotta say
---
they all deserve eachother
---
_but unironically_
---
Ace or Dwight 
---
Any player with half brain will tell you how survivor sided the game is. Thats not a problem in the slightest. Balance been better than ever, its just that in an asymetrical game someone will always have the upper hand. 
---
Well at the higher levels of play it's survivor oriented but I will it say both sides have some broken me mechanics and items, and lag switching works both ways and isn't just killer oriented
---
If you mean sleep on top of him, you are obviously a (wo)man/individual of culture
---
Shirtless Davids have more BDE than Myers

If it’s in messages and not the game, BHVR won’t ban for it. Report the person to Steam/Microsoft/Sony instead.

r/technicallythetruth
---
You aren't entirely wrong. When I first started I recieved a lot of, let's say distasteful messages. 
---
But it only lasted a couple hours before I got the hang of it well enough to get by. 
---
It's all ranked, so you'll be starting with the lowest ranked people (ideally) so there shouldn't be too much of a skill gap. 
---
I'd definitely recommend picking it up though. Love this game a lot
---
No I think having that option is brain dead if you can't catch someone I have dodged plenty of legions and then they just do that and I can't escape
---
Ikr
---
But the mend bar doesn't depletes in a Chase right ? 
---
So you can still keep him at bay for the same time with others without having to worry about mending

Is there anything wrong with it?

BTW this has nothing to do with DBD at all, Pug wasn't even playing DBD this stream. This kid is just butthurt because he was told to stop fighting in chat. Pug didn't even interact with him during stream. This went from being mad at me to being mad at Pug which makes zero sense. He wasn't even banned.

Ya when I do SFW we always have everyone run BT, IMO it’s the strongest perk in the game when it works.

He start up again? lol
---
I torture billy's lol Idk why I cant be hit by the chainsaw unless im lagging
---
I was using his Victorian outfit but honestly I think I’m just gonna leave him alone until they take a stab at fixing the game ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
Looks like what happened to my Bloodweb a few times. I still have yet to see anyone post something related to that. 
---
I agree. 
---
Hit someone 3 times with your power to down them with Frank's Mixtape. Since you can't be looped in any way it's incredibly powerful.
---
2 hits on the first frenzy then 1 more with another. 30 second chases with no counterplay.

Buddy, he’s right. Say it’s about whatever you want. But screaming about it on reddit and demanding a perfect patch and all is just throwing a tantrum. And you arguing with this guy over and over it became more clear that this was whining. Grow up dude, it’s just a game. And some devs. Jeez.
---
legion is legit uncounterable, he ignores windows and pallets, what else can a survivor do? stealth? no stealth doesnt work since the legion can see where other survivors are when he hits someone with his cancerous frenzy
---
Dont waste your time on him just a troll and bad seed of the community 
---
Yeah, probably
---
So did you drop them in game to counter ds, then?
---
well you cant really make a list as there really arent any official survivor sound volumes, but i would say ace is the most quiet, and i would say i have an easier time hearing davids since his character seems pretty loud to me

I really like the “mortal blow” idea. This player-base is so toxic it needs encouragement to step in for other teammates. Love how that one promotes that.
---
insidious irongrasp on leatherface, ya'll mothafuckas need jesus
---
Kind of. The issue is that the killer refills his power while chasing you and because of the way that legions power works they can completely ignore any pallets or windows which are survivors only form of survival. 
---
You basically just get shit on by a killer using zero skill with no counterplay.
---
First make it so deep wound doesn't go down while in a certain meter range. Probably keep it at 32 meters as making it his terror radius would fuck over Moniter&amp;Abuse+Distressing Multi-Hit build.
---
Then, remove Frank's Mixtape from the game.
---
After these 2 changes, we await the rework. :)

I love how the cursor was moving over to leave game then quickly shifted back.
---
Lol yea never understood that and u screw killer out of noed lol

More rarer
---
Finally.. a post that’s not someone’s terrible art or a grown person playing dress up!
---
what mdcplr said
---
Hehe. 
---
getting rank 1 is about how much you play not skill, #rek'd
---
Because getting rank in the game is really hard, and not just a time sink
---
To be fair, you’re an ass.
---
Uno problemo. 2/4 of the killers are behind a pay wall or a LOT of days worth of level ups to get those skins. I don't see them releasing even a decent free skin for the other 2 killers.
---
Besides that, pretty nice idea
---
Franks is an outlier that both killer mains and survivors agree should be removed.
---
Lag switching is an bannable exploit, I dont even know why its bought up in this conversation.
---
Honestly, when someone says the game is survivor sided is because you are at the mercy of how good the survivors are. A good group will have the upper hand, even if you as a killer is equally good. Its not about what side has more broken shit. Its about the core gameplay. 
---
Gotta cap dat FPS at 60.
---
The more you play the more you know 
---
Dwight over here looking like he's about start selling Strickland Propane and Propane accessories.
---
theres alot more bullshit i didnt mention, i could make a fucking essay about stupid op shit
---
oh yeah, also, being on a deep wounds timer, going to mend but then being found when your timer is at 1% so you can't do anything :) 
---
Oh look, it's you again
---
Rank isn't completely meaningless, but it's pretty bad.
---
To compare it to League of Legends ranks, Rank 1 is like if everybody from Plat to Challenger was represented by the same rank.
---
It's signifies that you know a bit about the game, but doesn't say much aside from that.
---
When you play a 4man rank1 swf with 2 flashlights, 2 Instaheals, 2 dstrikes and 4x adrenaline.
---
Happend to me yesterday, addon-less console Billy :(.
---
Personal experience? Hope this sub doesn’t have all bad mods, don’t want us to go the way of r/LegalAdvice or r/StarTrekDiscovery 
---
core gameplay isnt really good when most maps have like 2 pallets, i brought up lagswitching because ONLY killers can do it since they host, which will be fixed in the summer thank fuck
---
I can see that. Would make dead-hard a pretty nice counter. Right now, dead-harding during his frenzy(unless he's been using it for a bit and on the last sliver of gauge) is a complete waste
---
Top comment said it best. But I propose a different question. should it favor the killer? Or should it be perfectly balanced? 
---
One takes the game in a horror direction, or a competitive direction. 
---
And honestly, I always think the game is more fun when it’s scary and the tension is high. But that’s just me.
---
I literally have a notch all around my controller from wiggling like that, like some god damn indent in my analog stick.
---
Was that guy called pico something?
---
Sauce?
---
Yup, I’d say at least 7/10 times the first thing a killer does is check on their hex totem. Best way to find it tbh. 
---
Oh my bad, imma delete this post now thanks for info
---
There was a glitch that allowed you to get free prestiges without even levelling up that character and the devs immediately stated they'd ban people (on console too) who used this, even though previously the devs have stated that they can't ban people who cheat/hack on console.
---
I think the idea is that the first hit is free but if people dont heal thats all he gets. His power is really just that he keeps people injured
---
Yeah but that would render his ability useless, at least how it was meant to be played 
---
They just fucked legion up no matter which way 
---
Almost 300 hours and I still don't have the "bring an ultra rare without a ward" achievement...
---
 I'm really glad that it isn't tbh, all the other games in the genre have and it's nice to have a bit of difference
---
Make their ability actually utilize the fact that they're a group of four killers, instead of just having it be a boring rush down.
---
Yeah AND? 
---
Lol I got stuck today as well it was weird even the killer couldn't down me so I left 
---

---
Had this idea a while ago and I think it fixes a lot of their issues while still keeping what made them fun to play in the first place. I go in depth about why I think it would work if you're into that sort of thing.
---
Forgot to mention this in my post, but I would make frank's mixtape an ultra rare and then remove the fuming mixtape from the game.
---
Was it really Sealed Envelope, the yellow one? If it was a green envelope offering, it's right to give all survivors 25% bonus, but if not, hey a sweet bonus till they fix it!
---
No, thats a trash connection
---
\*\*Spirit would like to know your location\*\*
---
i play in a 4man, everyone has 1k+ hours, when we get "pale rose" or maybe that fucking shit spirit map the killer kost likely scapes up a 2k with NOED crutch, but on maps like thompsons house 5 gen runs are common against m1 killers, we need to make the shit maps decent for killer and surv, and the op maps decent for killer and surv, the biggest factor if we all escape or not, i would say is the map, then comes the killer, then comes if the killer has noed or not
---
The wait definitely seemed to increase recently.
---
Same here, too stubborn to re-roll and as a killer main it took me  3-4 weeks.
---
I didn't really need the points though so it didn't bother me. 
---
you become a shadow? hmmm
---
Its based god kumbi
---
He has yaoi hands
---
Yep, Sealed. Yellow and everything. And it's the only thing I can think of to be responsible. It was exactly 25% of my total. 
---
damn, its a game doesnt really matter xD
---
U throw my bill and meg on C tier wtf 
---
maybe make the drawing bigger and light it up better :)
---
Offensive Strike
---
Cleanse totems and noed won’t be an issue. And if they’re so ass then how’d you get caught to begin with? All I’m saying is relax, don’t be so entitled “PS4 god” 
---
Last game I played against the Legion wurh randoms we ran all 5 gens on him and all.got away. Fucking glorious!!
---
welcome to Dead by Buglight
---
Or, more common, the ILSoD. (do you actually get a rank penalty for killing the DBD process when it's been just loading for like 7 minutes?)
---
(assuming your post isn't "whoops, my cable slipped")
---
Game or not it’s not nice to mock someone like that
---
So you are in fact telling me the game is indeed survivor sided.
---
Most maps are better for survivors where as bad maps are just "balanced", no map is incredible killer sided. 
---
Again, people are like "But, glitching is ok because the devs didn't fix it yet!"  
---
Cheating is cheating, get rekt if you do it.  
---
Legion has a couple of issues that need fixing but this is what I'd do to fix him and make him not so annoying.
---
Change Franks Mixtape to not allow self mending during the trial.
---
Make Feral frenzy attack lose some power gauge of whiffed attacks and make the attacks hitbox a bit more narrow. So juking can more of a thing.
---
Change Deep Wounds to not tick down when within Terror radius as well as when in chase like the current version.
---
To get rid of janky tactics.
---
Make it so when you hit an injured survivor they can't self mend and Legion can now see when people are mending within terror radius
---
Double the Deep Woubd timer and make hits take of double aswell. That removes Legion fake chasing to kill survs.
---
True. My friends who got me into the game were rank 8-1, and it didn't take long for me to learn how not to be a meat shield. 
---
I actually watched almost the entire footage without knowing the guy before other than by name - there was like 3-4 Wraith and 1 Trapper games at earlier ranks, otherwise arbitrarily rotating mostly Billy/Nurse/Huntress - he dropped Billy (after one game that he *could* have lost) and Huntress (after having a bad game and only black pipping) somewhere in red ranks and mained Nurse for the last couple games. But overall really impressive, especially the consistency.
---
Sex on CCTV: spies from the shadows
---
I Freddy Krueger have a dream that my power will help me instead of hindering my efforts.
---
Id remove him from the game and give the people who bought the DLC 3k auric cells as a compensation
---
Nah, I'm not going to be chased off the internet (or this reddit) by people who feel like it's okay to attack people. But I am going to add to my blocked list, soooo. 
---
I played vs him once 
---
 I got to the same conclusion unfortunately
---
At least game will be no longer broken /s
---
Sometimes I get faced with toxic SWFs but they're really nice in the end-game.
---
No worries, I'm used to it.
---
He is Spanish as far as I know
---
I think you’ve answered your own question 
---
apart from hiding, kiting is all that survivor has to buy time for other survivors in doing gens, by taking that out of the game, you might as well spawn the survivor on the hook at the very start... And much like your argument for the killer side, survivor doesn't want to be found or generally find it "fun" to be found without any sort of counter-play just by hitting a survivor once and get a notification on your location... Fun is subjective yes that part is true, but negating any sort of participation aspect have kinda kills the purpose of playing each side much like what Legion does... Welp its my opinion tho...
---
Sorry. :(
---
The way he was toxic was actually entertaining 
---
How you? you can't depip from ranks 16-20.
---
Foreign account. Not moving. Swinging over and over (guessing at a fixed pattern?). Bad rank. 
---
You said that "Evasion is mostly taken care of after the third ban which is a machine ban. First two are account based." How does this mean that he was trying to ban evade? You still don't show any proof that he was trying to evade a ban or avoid the developers. He still posted content in which I am sure that developers or people have seen and he was not banned then. Do you have proof that he was BAN EVADING when he made additional accounts? Your other points are alright, but I want to know why you say that if you are banned once and make another account that counts as ban evading in terms of Dead by Daylight bans. As I said before, noob3 and Zubat are not re-banned for ban evading since it is not against their terms of service. Unless the developers specifically said that ochido is permanently banned after his first ban then what you have said is complete bullshit.
---
Also you saying that you don't have time to respond and trying to avoid people proving you wrong is really showing. Explain to me how he is ban evading when it is not against the rules of Dead by Daylight. Did the developers say that he is banned no matter what? Did they ban his account for a certain period of time in which they said that he could not play on other accounts? Did they say that you cannot ban evade? Please show me the evidence.
---
Rotten Fields and Shelter Woods both have a crap ton of generic tiles glued to one another, and reminder that I said incredible killer sided, not slightly. All Azarovs, Cowshed, Rancid, Thompsons, All macmillians. They are all heavy sided for survivors.
---
Btw you mentioned 8 maps, against 18 that are survivor sided lol (i may have missed some, just went from memory) 
---
This sign won't stop me because I can't read! 
---
The real concern is, why were you waking up 6 hours before lunch to play dead by daylight? 
---
But look at those nice rocks blocking it from view!
---
Also ignore me staring at her butt &gt;,&lt;
---
Actually he should have a colt M4 but Nick took it while he was, well... Dead
---
Everytime the game starts and I hear her lullaby, I get irl spine chill, it really is unsettling. 
---
Weekend mornings seem like the worst for K matchmaking though. The SWF that you do get there are more likely to be the nolifers while more relaxed players will only be playing evenings, or at least it feels like it.
---
How is he anti fun? Im not trying to be toxic or anything, just curious
---
You've been able to hit over the fence for a long time.
---
This isn't new, and as far as I know, it's not a glitch.
---
legions is the most played killer in my experience on ps4 atleast, so aids
---
My question would be then are the devs putting bots in the game to cut down on queue times?
---
"Tunneling a survivor they couldn't catch all game and then complain that survivors are op/toxic"
---
Keep in mind that the average chase can span to around 30 seconds to a minute (maybe longer depending on perks, position on the map, or the survivor's ability to loop), in that time (assuming everyone is working on gens, which is often) up to 3 gens could be at least near completed, depending on the survivor's ability to hit skillchecks (which most people have), then I would say that some games can end with one chase having lasted the whole game if the teammates not being chased take advantage of them being left alone whilst their teammate is being chased. So it's not too far fetched for most people to say that the survivors have an advantage. And if the survivor being chased doesn't act like a dick, then most killers would have no reason to call them toxic.
---
"Comparing DS to NOED"
---
Well, both practically reward the user for failing. DS rewards the survivor with an extra chance after going down, and NOED rewards the killer with an extra chance to down survivors after the gens are done.
---
"Complaining about "gen rushing""
---
Yeah, because it's not like 2 generators popping in the first minute and a half of the game starting is unbalanced or anything, right? And don't regurgitate that "Just use Ruin" argument. If a teachable perk is required to stand a chance in most games, that's not a good sign.
---
I'm down at the pub so it's well after the match. I'll have a look when I get home, thanks mate. Even if it doesn't work this time around I'll use that in future
---
 Nurse is tarrasque-level CR tho.
---
Highly doubt it. Probably just players too tired of player low level chars or people that sell accounts with maxed out killers 
---
R8S, R13K, similar - I *sometimes* get decent teammates as survivor, but as killer, they all seem to be either godlike or completely braindead. Survivors on my own meh-but-not-terrible skill level are rarer than either of these, or at least it feels like it.
---
No problem. Just by default he ignores all safety mechanisms of Survivors without any skill included (like nurse would have). You are predetermined to Go down once he fixates on you. Even in a predetermined amount of time. Unless the Legion is a total doofus he can either break Chase and make you mend yourself and stab you then or just Go into frenzy hit you, wait 6 seconds and do the same.
---
 There is no outplay whatsoever.

---
I wouldn't doubt it. How do you sell a PS account? 
---
Thanks for answering, as a killer main i never really saw the situation from the eyes of survivors and every survivor i asked got really angry and simply argued "ThEy IgNoRe VaUlTs" with no further elaboration
---
Sell the login info? Technically illegal but a lot of people still do it.
---
Considering they just implemented banning on consoles this week and afk+swing botting are bannable offenses, I don’t think there’s some grand conspiracy here. 
---
Did the same got the same result. Probably Adam bug.
---
What the hell... 😂😂😂
---
Angrypug is on the same level as Ochido, human trash. 
---
Imagine getting the Game beelining to your totem and still getting it destroyed right in front of you.
---
There is a time and a place for humble bragging and this is not it my dude.
---
I play solo and it takes at least 5 minutes, idk why the wait times are horrid right now 
---
I suspect he was on console first 
---
Hahahahaaahahahah
---
Still makes doesn't sense to log into a match to literally do nothing and gain nothing from it.
---
Fair enough.
---
Dude I just said legion could probably do without that. And the doc’s madness doesn’t affect people in lockers dude.
---
Also, we arrive again at what’s “fun” from person to person. 
---
Look, I’m going to bed. Goodnight my dear fellow. Good luck in the fog. May the devs come to a solution so that we both can be satisfied and have fun.
---
Ye 
---
That's why I love haunted grounds, turns every totem hunt into Russian roulette.
---
I play Hag, Huntress, Billy, Spirit and Nurse without add-ons and usually just use a moldy electrode on doc
---
After doing this I decided to do it to all killers and survivors. I HIGHLY recommend because its HILARIOUS.
---
Which he did technically but it took a while for devs to ban him.
---
It Sure does vary from Person the person. But the majority hates legion. Thats important.
---
Have a Good Night and sweet dreams. Dont let Freddy catch ya.
---
Yeah the recent nerfs to healing also makes me think that this game definitely highlights The Killers as its real stars of the game. So it makes more sense that the game is actually killer sided. Not it's a bad thing though, but personally I prefer playing as survivors more. :P
---
You have a point. I think it needs expanding and tweaking but I think the game has a future aside from just chases. That’s just my hope though. Who knows where the devs are trying to take this game.
---
I highly doubt anyone's getting permabanned for it
---
He had like 4 chances already
---
So you are abusing a bug that renders one of the survivors perks useless and then you go complaining on here about how you were treated after the game?
---
I can see that. Probably full of cocky bastards who refuse to believe that there are others who are as good as if not better than they are.
---
Isn't a weeb a western person acting all extra Japanese and spirit is a normal native Japanese person?
---
Ill probably fling all these together with a few other added scenes and stuff at some point when I can make it an episode long :3
---
the are people farming for xp points
---
not worthing the time because when survivors found out u are afk they will try to max everything and the last 2 of them they will never leave ,they will stay both on the hatch and wait each other to escape so the other take the hatch
---
Honestly though I am hopeful that the devs would just introduce different mechanism that kinda helps in chases before skewing it toward making the chase shorter...
---
Doc has the worst base kit in the game, so that's shocking that you'd do that to yourself. I don't really see the point in playing Hag without add ons either since all of her add ons are good. The others, I can see though I wouldn't myself. 
---
I know right, like it’s just a game. He probably does it all the time when he doesn’t get his way.
---
He is also literally a pedophile, asking for nudes from some of his underage females that he knew were underage.
---
Ah thanks for making this comment, yesterday I decided to use freddy's better addons and found out that I had most success with the class photo, I was planning on changing it, but you reminded me
---
Using too much no mither, huh?
---
So he had one bad game. Just move on and play the next on. Really can’t understand what the big deal is :D
---
And if they don't stop to self-care and just get back on gens? That's the big brain survivor play right there if you absolutely want to win, just focus the gens. The time it takes for one survivor to die on hook is way longer than it takes for 2-3 people to bang out 5 generators.
---
Yeah, and do you think it's fun for the SFW if you dodge them?
---
Exactly, like it ain’t that serious lol

I've been getting messages from kids on Xbox Live for years lol this reminds me of the call of duty kids
---
Not a pedo though
---
What do you mean you look like a survivor? I thought it was just terror radius not visual
---
his voice is so annoying i hate to mute it wow
---
Doesn’t surprise me hahaha
---
Unbiased evidence, biased conclusion, I'm guessing. Haven't seen the video myself.
---
Ds dribble isnt a bug and only works in a situation close to a hook. The other alternative is slug them...which is better then? 
---
You make it to rank 20 by doing nothing tho... also, don't forget that everyone who gets the game has at least been rank 20 once, but not many have been rank 1
---
You don't get permanently banned on your first offense unless you're doing some real bad shit. Even so, you can likely get a new copy/account if you love it so much but you have to fly under the radar.
---
Well. At least "don't play on weekends" still applies. On weekdays, avoid evenings.
---
No, nothing to do with that. A coordinated survivor group at rank 1 is just too cancer to play against. 
---
How long have you played by the way?
---
The crappy cropping makes it meta af
---
You can't derank from 15. The only way to derank back to 16 is with rank reset
---
It just seems like bad balancing. It is partially offset because killer matches are longer on average, and they don't have the opportunity to keep their add-ons (whereas survivors can escape with items, "saving" blood points). Definitely agree they should add more stealth points and survivor points in general though.
---
Pretty sure they're called emblems
---
Will you be surprised if i say there are lots of survivors who say that noed has no counters and cleansing dull totems is a waste of time?
---
oh i see you're playing on lower ranks. cause Wraith and Trapper and Clown are ain't shit on red ranks. 
---
Not long by myself. I've played on my roommate's account for about a year, just bought it myself about a month ago. Why? 
---
You don't seem to have reached rank 1 yet, if you did, you'd know that it isn't exactly the most fun rank to be at. Also, it's not hard to get rank 1
---
Now I'm shure you haven't been at rank 1 yet
---
It's true, but I feel like this is how it should be. If anything, Legion needs a nerf untill they fix his powers.
---
You need to be carefull with characters that break game mechanics, before Legion, nurse was my nr.1 most hated killer, but at least Nurse is mindgameable.
---
Forgot the last part where they slap Ochido immediately with the new Ban hammer, just because they couldn't do anything before. 
---
"you do not have any play history for this day"
---
This something I need to turn on? Can't find a setting for it
---
Ochido indeed used to be a creep, but he doesn't have an interest on young girls. In fact, before acting disgusting with those girls he flirted with he first asked if they were 18+ or not (that does not justify his behaviour tho, he's still a weirdo). The reason why some of those underaged girls got involved in it is because some of them wanted to play along with him, so they lied about their age. Then, when the drama started most of them decided to point fingers to him.
---
Either way, I'm not defending Ochido with this. He acted very dirty and stupid, and he deserves the hate he gets this community. But it's also some of those girls fault that instead of avoiding him when he went "full horny mode", they flirted with him until his requests were too excessive.
---
I know the green one gives 25% to all. This was yellow. You can't misremember what you're literally [staring at] (https://imgur.com/8BS7Cj0) as you post.
---
I used to love the rage ps4 messages, you just act really nice and get them to say more horrible things because it tilts them even more when your nice. Then file a report, Sony are quite good at banning people with a communication ban or even playing if they like sending those kinda messages. Make sure you keep the messages and after his ban, message him saying did you enjoy the ban :-)

You know something is going to happen
---
Deliverence right in yer face. And you're running We'll make it.
---
It’s not a setting that I ever had to enable, I don’t know what’s up with it. 
---
and you survive while all 3 others get's downed by it and put in the basment. GL doing 2 gens alone! 
---
The yellow one was bugged for a while and gave BPs to everyone not just the one using it. Dunno if they fixed it but from your post it seems they didn't 
---
You don't "make it" to rank 20, you start there.
---
How 'bout no? 
---
I've got 500 hours while being uncapped and never got this, wierd
---
That doesn't really work, now does it?
---
First of all. If you hook the guy who just got unhooked, you still have +2 less generators being repaired; you have the guy on the hook and all the survivors that swarm around the hook.
---
Second. Your strategy relies entirely on survivors healing themselves. It takes a maximum of 32 seconds for two survivors to heal themselves. In that 32 seconds you can have generator 80% done or completely finished and THEN followed up by fast healing when 1 or more survivors tend to wounds. It takes MAXIMUM of 8 seconds for two survivors to heal a wounded one. EIGHT seconds. That is roughly the time it takes to kick a generator and a pallet. 
---
Lastly. Wounded state is far less important than hook state. If you want to play the wound game you must be running stuff like Nurse's calling and Thanatophobia, which really aren't all that great perks for some killers who need Bamboozle, Enduring, Hex: Ruin, BBQ, Brutal Strength, Monitor &amp; Abuse..
---
Yeah, it's some nonsense. The emblem system is kinda counterintuitive for the survivors, you almost gotta metagame it.
---
Also it fucks up queue times during events because everyone wants to play killer for the extra farming efficiency
---
It's clearly Hex: No One Escapes Basement, can't you see?

Fyuck
---
Well they aint known for their smarts. And i rather hang out with them then some delusional person like you who thinks ochido got banned for making killer mains salty....
---
Their Argument: "But he hasnt done anything bad on console tho 4head" lmao 
---
It's like that kid on the playground who keeps making excuses as to why he wasnt tagged. Like NO NO NO i had an invincibility shield! NO DOESNT COUNT 
---
No idea why you're getting downvoted for voicing your opinion.. if you're looking for more people like him I'd reccomend Noob3. Monto and tru3ta1ent are also good but not quite the same
---
step one: play against a terrible killer.   
---
step two: there is no more steps.
---
Weak attempt.
---
I judge you anyway for judging him anyway. Don't judge me for that.
---
**Pace:** Pacing back and forth has helped you move faster, Walk 10/20/30% faster and Slow Vault 20/30/40% faster.
---
*"I'd rather walk then run"*
---
**Insomnia:** You have trouble falling asleep making you tired yet focused, Exhaustion lasts 20/15/10 seconds longer but while repairing, healing, sabotaging, cleansing, opening Exit Gates and searching Chests receive a 1% speed bonus every 3 seconds you are performing the action up to a maximum of 5/7.5/10%, finishing or stopping the action resets the bonus.
---
*"Too tired to think..."*
---
**Nihil:** You're lack of hope makes you not worry about the situation as much, additional effects granted by the Killers add-ons are 10/30/50% less effective on you.
---
Oh you'd be surprised how many survivors call anything that the killer does camping/tunneling.
---
I always forget the name of the add ons because my game is in spanish, so I'm used to hear and read them in english but I use them in spanish. It's a bit weird.
---
Hard to fix moonwalk since chase mechanics are weird. I'd suggest to increase the bleedout timer so much that Legion simply downs faster through multi stab than through moonwalk. (Stab will stay at 1/3 of bleedout bar)
---
The problem is mindgame becomes unavailable if nurse uses 3~4 blinks. Dead Hard? Blink again then.
---
Whose nose at the under of the nose keeps going downwards and connects directly to the upper lip, forming a beak? You have weird noses wherever you live.
---
Yes, yes it is
---
It's supoosed to be a fact, not an advice
---
Yeah, but that isn't even the prefered addon for pro nurse. If you're good at Nurse, 2 blinks is all you need. Don't get me wrong, I still hate Nurse a whole lot. It's just that a new killer has taken the top spot
---
If youre going to use the perk then ensure you go down far from a hook? Cant be mad if you run lithe and the killer doesnt chase you near a vaulting spot? Don’t get your logic here...if there is “no counter” for ds then you wouldnt be able to hook them while the skill check window is occurring...thats my thinking anyway. I didn’t come to whine I came to discuss if this is what lobbies are like on pc. I gave you the context of the game and you interpret that as whining its not my fault. 
---
Doesn't need to be lagswitch. Just hiccup or otherwise poor routing and connection and this game desyncs the crap out.
---

Based on your attitude from the linked chat history, I would've banned you for a week if you were in a channel I mod. They let you off easy. Also, your anger is directed at the mods, why are you attacking Pug? Makes no sense.

Save the best for last is his best perk.

Wah woah we wah, it's like you have ESPN or something. Great guess!

I’m just gonna downvoted everyone because apparently we don’t know what **sarcasm** is.

You want him to make compilation?

Ain't that the truth.

I never heard of this? Is there a source?
---
Thank you 🖤
---
It’s just internet points bro chill
---
*they’re 
---
Most likely because the survivor team has a total of 16 perk slots vs the killer's 4, so on their own they are weaker but paired up with many others they become stronger.
---
A good point.
---
This game won't ever get a better ranking system until it gets a playerbase that's about the size of League's.  This is about the best we can hope for unfortunately.
---
Who made this? 😂
---
Meh, in purple right now, but mostly been playing greens. Clown is my best match-up, the average Wraith and Trapper game is still an escape - I struggle a lot against Huntress in particular and Cannibal (I know he's very loopable, but he's *extremely* rare and I fucked up all 3 or so games I played vs him). Nurse or Spirit are of course objectively harder if they are good but statistically less likely to kill me so far than those two.
---
&gt;there
---
They’re *
---
But to the point, survivors call killers toxic for one of three reasons. 
---
1. The killer was toxic. 
---
2. The survivor is an idiot/bad player who is blaming the killer for whatever reason. 
---
3. They’re attempting to get under the Killer’s skin. 
---
It'll be fixed on the hot-patch which isss... I think Wednesday?
---
It’s hard to swallow advice /s
---
People are cunts wherever they play. In game and in life, get used to it is my advice.
---
&gt; BHVR clearly doesn't give a damn
---
I dc every time the enemy killer is legion and he tunnels past 2 frenzies, which is basically every time the enemy killer is legion lol. It's like you said, the devs don't care to make the game fun for survivors so I'll leave the matches that aren't fun.
---
Play whatever you want, but PLEASE don’t use franks. I don’t use it on legion just because of how dumb it is and how it ruins fun for survivors.
---
This isn’t advice actually. Do you know what advice is? It’s giving people tips on what to do. Advice is “hey, lithe and dance with me work pretty well together.” That is advice. This is just some dude’s personal opinion. Learn the difference. 
---
For better lighting try multiple light sources, 3 is a good number but two works, so a desk lamp + ceiling lamp will usually work.
---
Yup. So basically, unless you're out of a job or have a strange shift, just don't play.
---
My first ever pc game was with a tier 1 killer, and all of us was at 20, on Haddonfield. 
---

---
When facing Legion as a survivor it's a matter of when you'll go down, not if you'll go down. He's not a great killer, but he's designed to tunnel survivors out of the game. You cannot juke Legion when he is in frenzy, and he can just follow until frenzy comes back. If they know how to moonwalk, they can put you in a situation where you can literally do nothing except go down. 
---
Legion removes the skill of playing survivor from the game and people don't like playing against it. Probably the worst killer they've ever designed, imo.
---
You'll get to rank 1 soon enough then. If you just know how to loop a little you'll get there. 
---
100%, 180%, 240%, 280% actually
---
It's the only way. 
---
Because ingame there’s more tension. We tend to freak out a little more and think things through as much, causing us to make mistakes. 
---
Wobedy provides more details in the comment section, whether you believe him or not is up to you. Also no shit it will be an unnamed individual, the moment they mention names, Ochido's rabid fanbase will be all over harassing that individual (See: Ochido making his followers mass report a guy on Steam because he did not like the way that guy played).
---
Yeh.
---
and they go down immediately after *happened to me yesterday with an adam doing it right infront of a hag trap when I was about to unhook and then triggered it* 
---
&gt;when there’s errors 
---
Shouldn’t it be “when there are errors”?
---
This is this dude’s advice... even though it’s not helpful. No need to be hostile.

Thank fuck for it though, now you aren't fucked just for coming at a window the wrong way.

Oh my god you’re right I’m totally incompetent. Thanks for the advice, will take it to heart and learn to be better next time.

Well the t

This brought to you by survivors killed by Legion. XD
---
SWF which throw out the hook removal offerings and then Sabo every hook in front of me
---
I do admit this isn't the right format. But at the same time I was on the train when I came up with it and didn't want to forget it so just used whatever format I had in my phone. I sincerely apologise for my inappropriate use of this format. 
---
I just took a long stroll at your profile and you are just so adorable!!
---
Now we just need goblin slater trapper
---
Well the thing about killer perks is that a killer, with no perks, have zero ability to build momentum. In the end, at least i think, all killer perks are for the sake of building and maintaining momentum.
---
A friend of mine played against him (or a guy who pretended to be him) as is second killer match ever on pc back in 2017 during the free weekend. Ochido forced him to disconnect by not leaving for half an hour. He didn't buy the game becouse of it. This just goes to show the results of ochido deranking to play against and bully new players for fun.
---
Anyway when the game become free on ps4 I convinced him to give ot another try. Even tho we are not able to play together becouse of the different system, now he likes the game, and I'm happy that he will never have to play against ochido again
---
So basically just stay at low ranks if I want to have fun. I feel like it'll be bullying low rank survivors. I'm nothing special as killer but I have enough experience as a survivor to predict their moves. Seems kinda unfair.
---
EU. There’s a lot of russians in my area but honestly they don’t seem that bad most of the time. It was pain to translate their chat text to determine wether they were cussing or saying gg hege
---
Its really not needed. I've come to the point where i kill those who does it. 
---
Like who? I know Swind has hundreds of legit purple flashlights and other stuff hoarded, Scott has like 200 I-heads etc...
---
Only one saying that it is representative of every PC player is you. OP is asking if this is the norm, should this be expected and its completely valid question considering how much salt there is in the chat half of the time.
---
LOL yeah. It was a dumb video.
---
Yeah I dont tunnel and I go after the farmer who unhooked right when I turn around. Everyone dies on their 3rd hook and I pip twice. Now I did just have a 0k but still pipped. Obviously this wont happen t high ranks. I like playing "fair" but in high ranks it just isnt an option without getting bullied which I'm trying to avoid.
---
They never said "The totems that are out in the open" were being changed.
---
Only the good ones were improved, and some even better ones exist now.
---
This totem. This one is the Quentin of totems, and can't be saved. 
---
it's all I have atm, and I really want to play dbd.
---
I know rank doesn't matter, surely. but the consistency of being there and amount of time spent can teach you much. you will inevitably meet very skilled players that you very unlikely face on other ranks. no one actually skilled is gonna be playing full power even on purple ranks cause it's boring. each time if I miss out couple days and still on green-purple after reset, man... it's so easy I could be killing them with eyes closed. of course they'll only experience like 10% of my power, zoinks. cause there's no point going 100. and I tell ya that, I just had 4k on Coldwind with completely naked Freddy(no perks, no add-ons), yesterday I had easy 3k and a hatch escape with naked Susie on Bedham. all on rank 1. 
---
and surviving what we mostly have on red are Billies, Nurses and Spirits. now Legion added and you can see how fukin bad as players those who play them, literally got boosted with Legion unable to de-pip in a match. 
---
aaand I forgot what we were talking about so whatever I'll go back to my rum and perkless rank 1 gameplay :D
---
Is that even a possibility?
---
Take a look at this: [Geforce Now](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/geforce-now/). The way it works is that you are playing a game on a server somewhere, your inputs are sent to the server and the video is streamed over to your mac. I use it often and it works really well.
---
It is currently in beta and completely free. There is a waitlist though to request beta access and I'm not sure how long you'll have to wait.
---
BOTH. That Nea just rushed to the exit gate and teabagged, then she's gone. She didn't even try to make use of that bt effect to buy me some time. She just left me. I couldn't even use deliverance cause everyone else had already escaped. Gotta love my teammates :)
---
Hahaha that's fucking great.

That's actually shocking.

This spot was added a few patches ago I believe

I use a controller but the in-game sensitivity is too low. So I use Steam Big Picture to have my right stick emulate a mouse and adjust the sensitivity there to my liking.
---
Lol. "Don't be a pussy he has deliverance " had me in stitches. 
---
Thanks for the suggestion. I actually have this but when I tried on a game because I live in Australia, it didn't work.
---
You're right, we should be able to straight up kill the killer. Just as long as you hit a skill check
---
*it was very slow.
---
from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_and_mouse
---
&gt;  The "cat" is unable to secure a definitive victory over the "mouse", who despite not being able to defeat the cat, is able to avoid capture.
---
Definitely not a case in DbD
---
**Cat and mouse**
---
Cat and mouse, often expressed as cat-and-mouse game, is an English-language idiom dating to 1675 that means "a contrived action involving constant pursuit, near captures, and repeated escapes." The "cat" is unable to secure a definitive victory over the "mouse", who despite not being able to defeat the cat, is able to avoid capture. In extreme cases, the idiom may imply that the contest is never-ending. The term is derived from the hunting behavior of domestic cats, which often appear to "play" with prey by releasing it after capture. This behavior may arise from an instinctive imperative to ensure that the prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat.In colloquial usage, it has often been generalized to mean the advantage constantly shifts between the contestants, leading to an impasse or de facto stalemate.

Ayyyw another Legion main perhaps?
---
Devs got the ability to issue bans on PS. Nothing more complicated than that.

On a scale of 1 to Jeff, Ace is a negative 12, and is the only survivor with Iron will baseline.
---
Tapp and Dwight are also quieter than most. 
---
fug yeah, dude. I too much prefer low effort shitposts over stuff that takes talent, work, and skill.
---
(no offence OP, you did make a good meme)
---
Legion has way less counterplay than Nurse does. 
---
Doesn't make them better, since they still have to chase you for 9 months when Nurse has the ability to end chases in literal seconds, but if Legion wants you dead, you're DEAD. If Nurse wants you dead, you at least have a chance.
---
Yes, 5 seconds if you are complete fucking awful at this game. 
---
I play PS4 and I don't see Legion as much as I did when he first came out. I've been seeing allot of Huntresses Pigs

If it's involved deleting or modifying your save file it's a bannable offense, exactly as using a program

No they are definitely not all the same length. If i'm recalling correctly I think that the Nurse's is the longest, as well as Clown and Spirit being long. I \*think\* that the Hillbilly has the shortest mori animation.
---
What do you mean you suck at getting gens? I don't understand
---
What's your reasoning hoping for a legion buff? I've only been playing the game a few weeks and she seems incredibly OP to me. Interested to hear the other side of it though
---
Shame he isn't on console.
---
Good to meet another L4D fan!
---
I actually love to go to the killer shack first and surround and circle it a bit, pretending my totem was there, before walking off. Makes them waste time and draws them out.
---
4 ninjas that do 4 gens sight unseen.
---
Finall hurt some of them.
---
They all have adrenaline.
---
Ends in a shit show where they all make late game mistakes, 3-4 kills.

I would feel like an asshole to call it a GG, when we all know it didn't feel like it.
---
Empty chat. 
---
Uh, ok - if you actually are so godlike as you claim, that's good for you, I guess, don't drink too much - I would never argue to be *good* at the game, I'm more busy with shitposts, watching LPs and statistics than I actually play, just not bad as in significantly below median. :p
---
Was more directed towards the thingy with Legion landing somewhere between the stereotyped 115% M1 killers in my particular escape rate statistic not meaning I actually consider Wr/Tr unfavourable match-ups, doesn't have to be that way everywhere of course.
---
The queue times have been awful since just before the last event ended. Doesn't seem to matter what rank you are, I tried de-ranking to 10 but it made no difference to being at rank 1. Nothing consistently works, re-making the lobby, restarting the application... Like you said sometimes we are waiting for over 20 minutes. I had a bunch of friends start playing this when it was free with PS Plus but they have all left it because we can't find games.
---
They have prove thyself.
---
Tell that to all the players who got to r1 playing perkless killers without add-ons
---
Seems like it. I am very new to this game, but in my group of friends only I suffer from basement bugs and only I uncapped it. 
---
I didn't see that while I was making this. 
---
I don't think Mac and cheap mix well
---
This shits been happening waaay too much lately (ps4 on good connection and sub 80ms lobby ping)
---
If hes not running franks mixtape, legion is one of the worst killers if not the most
---
And I dont think its smart at all. I doubt they care too much
---
&gt;He just generally promotes toxicity in this game. Even to the point where people who really aren't even that good or a high rank try to act like him.
---
0 gens done, everybody is in downed state. Pretty common in such cases
---
Imagine your post and replace Freddy with any other killer besides S and A rank killers. 
---
Same thing happened to me, escept that it was just me and David left. 
---
I'm actually getting competitive in this game. I'm so happy that my rank keeps going up :)
---
I still gotta check those dlcs out.
---
oh, wow, really?! that’s kinda super cheap! that’s really good to know!!! thank you!! 
---
Another good one is m4 or something on your mouse for skill checks. It takes some time to get used to but it's a lot better than spacebar imo
---
Ok big boy, what's the genre called.
---
Fearless sounds like a good counter for Doc running Discipline notes.
---
It could be improved by showing the killers aura in a range slightly higher than Pig/Wraiths pink addons (12 meters is the addon range
---
No, but you should be able to inconvenience him.
---
Oh yeah, I feel it the same way. 
---
That’s good then , as long as you are having fun:)
---
Done this before when he popped a Tombstone *facepalm*
---
*this isn't really dead by daylight but okay it's a really cool cosplay gj*
---
I quit for 7 months. If you don't believe me, look at my post history.
---
This game is such an abusive relationship for me. It could be \*so good\* if BHVR just stopped listening to bad players whining and gave the killer the control over the match he needs to manage the frustration that comes with playing killer. The saddest change for me was the reversion of the hatch closing mechanic. There was no reason to bring back the hatch standoff.
---
I stand by my initial point. Without the grind you wouldn't be interested in the game, by giving you something to eternally shoot for and aim for. It gives you a reason to keep playing. 
---
Gonna need you to step back out of yourself and try to be self aware for a minute instead of just ranting about your own personal progression. 
---
If you had every perk, and there was no reason to play the game apart from ranking &amp; having fun. You wouldn't play as much / at all.  Facts
---
Awww, look! It's even using punctuation as if it was a real person, and not just an avatar for TBI, so cute!
---
There is no way you can react in time. Even if you get off your gen, Wraith still has his windstorm speedboost. Not to mention he can bodyblock vaults and pallets.
---
All talking about a bug.. isnt it a simply lagswitcher?
---
I prefer TONED
---
I've never experienced anyone leaving when I play legion, andim also on ps4 😯
---
Its referred to as asymmetrical horror
---
I like the trapper and wraith ones. 
---
It’s ridiculous how sweaty rank 1 is. Green/Purple ranks are the best imo. I main a p3 Laurie and every killer assumes I run DS (which I don’t, I think it’s a scummy perk that ruins games), and that I’m a living toxic shithead, when I don’t play toxic. My most toxic perk is Self-Care at that. But lord, when I play red ranks with killers, if I’m not playing Myers, Nurse, Huntress or Legion, it’s gg. It’s absurdly unbalanced.
---
Yeetus deletus
---
Remember people wanted a legion buff? I don’t know why he’s so hated now.
---
The potential spots should be so numerous that there is no point memorizing it. It's just dumb that you can memorize pallets, loops and totem spawns in this game. Its sort of cheating.
---
Nice argument really....
---
What do you mean...?
---
That's really unfortunate :( I assure you most of the people who play aren't like that though. Nothing wrong with SWF or gen rushing though, SWF is just the most efficient (and fun imo) way to play the game and gen rushing is the only objective for the survivors, you just have to do a better job at applying pressure and not letting them finish gens (there are guides on youtube you can check out, perks you can unlock like "Hex: Ruin", and one tip I'd give is to always save the 3 gens closest to each other because they'll have to do one of them to escape and if they're close enough to run back and forth to they'll have a really hard time getting one done). Flashlight squads are pretty rare, I hardly ever run into more than 1 flashlight per game, if any, and if you see them all holding items in lobby, you can use the "Franklin's Demise" perk which knocks the item out of their hand when you hit them, once you unlock it. And if a particular survivor is really being a dick and teabagging/pointing all the time, just tunnel them. If it's justified by their toxicity, there's nothing wrong with tunneling the toxic survivor out of the game.
---
Teach me your way, God Dwight

To be fair, I’ve went through three prestige’s with Freddy and two with legion. Freddy is mid-tier if anything. The only thing they should fix on him is that you can’t wake up with self-care, and the RNG for skill checks should be fixed and that’s it, he doesn’t need a complete rework. Legion on the other hand (and I’ve played on both sides), just needs a fix to frank’s mixtape. I don’t run it and I dread playing against it myself. I have 34 of them sitting in my inventory from the winter event and I’m not using it unless I see the toxic 4man swf when I play. Also, after legion hits all four survivors, (s)he should be able to chain hits, in exchange for a decrease of power time.

What you got there?

Assuming both sides have meta perks, and the Killer is playing a killer usable at high ranks (Nurse, Hillbilly, Myers, Hag, Huntress, etc.)
---
* Killer with a Mori
---
* SWF
---
* Killer on a good map
---
* Randos
---
* Killer on a bad map
---
i had to do parkour legion and just vault stuff all the time with other survivors just to rank down because ranking up with killer is ridiculously easy
---
survivor on the other hand i'm lucky to even safety pip most of the time
---
I believe the saying is... "git gud"
---
Imagine if like a 9mm was an actual item and it stuns the killer for like 5 seconds?
---
Hex: Ruin is absolutely mandatory perk for any killer that isn't a Nurse or Legion and even for them it's just that much more powerful because of the pressure (put Doctor in there as well). It's just insane how 4 generators can be completed just a bit over a minute after the game starts. I'm finally coming to the conclusion that this game is just shit. Its just BAD game. It's so fucking poorly designed into this simplistic catch-the-survivor piece of shit of a game. Killer can't make even one fucking mistake and the survivors immediately capitalize on that by getting 50% progression on a generator. And because the game is so fucking poorly done at its core there is nothing they can change in it without completely fucking it up. Maps are too small for more objectives and yet they are way too large for killer to abandon a chase and go check on a generator across the map. Survivors are too visible to do anything else other than run away from killer and the fucking scratchmarks make no sense whatsoever when one of the avenues for escape is supposed to be misleading the killer into a path the killer doesnt think the survivor would take. BUT NO THERES FUCKING SCRATCHMARKS THIS WAY, CAN SEE THEM ACROSS THE MAP THERES A SURVIVOR. It's SO DUMB that it truly baffles my mind when people are talking about this game as if it had any resemblance of depth to it.  Scratchmarks are there just to further trivialize the gameplay and it ultimately boils down to: Killer chases 1-2 survivors, 2-3 survivors repair generators. Either survivor gets hooked and 1-2 guys go to rescue or survivors just repair all generators. Oh yeah and the t-bagging. Why the FUCK does survivor have TIME to do that? The pallets should be designed so that if the survivor stays there with the pallet and stunned killer even for ONE SECOND they fucking DIE. Why is the killer such a fucking joke in this game, nothing more than interactive AI with limited mobility, limited ability and limited threat. What a great power position. Survivors hold all the reins from the start of the game till the end and the devs pretend like its the other way around. Maybe remove the fucking ranking system since you're balancing this shit game around R20 where nobody has any fucking perks, addons or clue how to play this fucking PIECE OF SHIT GARBAGE ASS GAME.

No I’m not saying you stole it. I think I phrased my comment wrong. I just meant I had the same idea. I have no doubt other people on this subreddit probably have similar ideas. I think it would be really cool if every killer had more than one Mori animation, with each one having a random chance to play 
---
The same people who decided to break their promise about optimizing the game for console players? 
---
&gt; the devs don't care to balance the game around my specific definition of fairness, so I'll knowingly make the game unfair for everyone else, then whine that the game isn't fair
---
Fearless is more of a hard counter to monitor and abuse and a few specific killers.
---
Counter 1: Myers, especially scratched mirror Myers.
---
Counter 2: Pig while she's crouched.
---
Counter C: Freddy before he sleeps you... not like you need a counter to him though.
---
Counter 4: Cloaked Wraith... again, not like you need it.
---
Counter 5: Spirits with decent add-ons
---
Thanks

When I play survivor and I see someone with the words Pleb/Creature/Dud joining the lobby, I leave... thosw people cannot be trusted and they arent good teammates either...
---
Japanese are just weeb humans anyway
---
You're right. Killers are tortured and brainwashed into the deity's tooks. And the survivors are just captured in this endless loop where the deity feast on their hope(hence hook and escape gate, to give survivor hopes instead of allowing killers to just kill). 
---
I'm shure
---
Check out the Channel 4Gamers.. they make good compilations without you having to turn the volume to 0.1% to prevent your ears from bleeding
---
Yeah, I reckon that would be good. I think it would be nice if you were to prestige a killer, you will gain a new mori, so you would have four in total. I really like your ideas for the new moris :)
---
Nobody is saying that totems should be impossible to find. Almost everyone is asking for reasonable spawn positions so that all of the spawn positions have equal quality in terms of difficulty being found. I think it illustrates really well the incompetence of the devteam when you can have some totems hidden inside Satans asshole and some are just fucking beacons shining against the backdrop of infinite darkness so even the blind man can see them.
---
I actually played against him before his PC ban a longgg time ago (I no longer play DBD like that). But he was what you’d expect in his montage and started vaulting through a window as soon as the match started to get me to chase him. 
---
To my surprise, he wasn’t as good as I thought he was (juking wise) and got sent back to the lobby 1st before I got my 4K. But he really was just your average taunting survivor that you could very easily run into VS a toxic 4-man SWF group (I’ve run into a lot worse).
---
I don’t follow his news closely, but hope he finds a different game to enjoy :(
---
The feeling when you are rank 1 and your teammates play like a rank 20 :PepeHands:
---
But they’re implying if Nurse was a weeb she’d be the Spirit
---
&gt;rank-tank
---
No idea what that means
---
It should be about terror radius.
---
I mean leader is still good because it grants a 25% boost to others healing you, so it only takes I believe 12 seconds instead of 16 to get a full heal from an ally. 
---
Bro he had been banned 3x on PC before... this is his 4th ban and thous he had 4 fucking chances....
---
Using your Rank 20 allies to play against Rank 10 Killers to boost yourself to Rank 1 :^)

I don’t know if that’s been told to us

When you decide to dick around saboing hooks and the Claudettes are "doing gens" instead of doing gens.

Me: respect every imaginary rule but controler disconects and i stay in front of hooked survivor for 0.0067 seconds

Survivor: imma have to hit you with that bullshit tonight fam
---
Dolls are a big one.
---
We don't really have any religious horror yet.
---
There's aliens, but easily could end up being kinda dumb.
---
Same with the more old fashioned ones such as robots and insects.
---
Aside from clown, we don't have many "urban legend" type things.
---
Historical horror, like plague doctor/executioner/jack the ripper, all that fun stuff.
---
"Paranoia" horror, stuff like the Thing or It Follows, though it's generally agreed disguise killers can't be balanced.
---
Not really distinct enough, but we don't have much grotesque body horror, especially recently.
---
Like most, I'd really like more beastial killers, stuff like werewolves or more old-fashioned vampires. 
---
When crouched, Pig is about the height of a crouched survivor so a lot of people will often confuse her for somebody coming to help work on a gen. That’s why P3 clothes work on her, to help cover up jet giant pig head and bright red robes. 
---
I’m assuming it wasn’t patched properly because it’s happened to me about 5 times this week. Mostly on the Haddonfield map though.
---
Serious moment I understand getting salty when you're camped the gates are open and you're the only person who the killer caught but it's unfortunate necessity of this game.
---
Had a match against a garbage Doctor who couldn't catch anyone all game. Finally downed me after I soloed 3 gens (weeeee teammates burnt all the pallets) and then face camped me.
---
I had a daily to escape. -.- I hadn't been downed once that game.  
---
Pretty fucking salty after that.
---
Real.
---
The other day, I played killer in the first time in forever. I purposefully tried to cycle hooks as much as I could. If I came across 2 people I'd go after the one that was either uninjured or had been hooked less, and if I went to an unhook, I'd outright ignore the unhooked person and go after the savior.
---
I was literally playing in a way that was outright detrimental to me at times (like ignoring a survivor if I felt like I'd been chasing them too much) and I was STILL called a tunneler in a few games.
---
Nea best killer confirmed
---
Lycanthropy based Killer, Technology Based and the Psychopath 
---
I believe it has been announced, I just cannot remember the exact time. I want to say the devs said in their stream discussing it.
---
Add devour hope and mother-doughter ring into the mix and you have my spirit build
---
Probably worth spending more for a better pc that will run more games and last a couple of years , definitely worth in my opinion
---
I want a killer based on the most dangerous game. One who dosen't kill from tragedy or from evil, but for the hunt of it. 
---
Iron grasp insidious
---
Wdym? I aint racist
---
On ps4, Not even kidding, the majority of games are boosted noed killers
---
Stop playing legion
---
Why would a pig use Insidious?
---
as someone with social anxiety this scares me
---
Dbdgonewild is an awesome subreddit hehe
---
I really don't know
---
That would be nice 
---
yep he is  banning hackers and then **making fun of them** 
---
This is completely unacceptable. Who knows how many times they have done this before? It’s actually mind blowing that someone can consciously ban players for something that they themselves are doing. So fucking stupid and frustrating to see from a game I recently just bought and enjoy so much. We need to hear action has been taken ASAP.
---
You barely have to move it I don't know why people have this hardon for trying to break their controllers.
---
Honestly no idea. He talks about them with pride. Acting so mighty being able to hand out the bans.
---
I know this is shitty but bare with me for a short story. I have a very competitive aspect within myself for certain games and dbd can sometimes be one. I play on ps4 and a couple days ago at rank 3 I played against a face camping michael who I outplayed all game running him around and then he decided to face camp me once he got me. Of course even though I escaped I felt the need to message him. All I sent him was a heartfelt "stay salty bud." Well that was a mistake, guy ends up arguing with me and threatening me that I was breaking sony's TOS (he was using complete proper grammar and full sentences in our messages btw) he continuously ignored my comments but rather reflected on my personal behavior towards him which made me salty because he was not flaming me back ( I strive off of that). Long story short I ended up making a mistake by telling him to "take your autism elsewhere" and I looked at his profile and it said he was a "disabled veteran, father, ex marine" and other stuff. Basically I felt like a complete dick, apologized and have tried to keep my salt inside me
---

This might be something for you to see?

Well you’ll have to trust me on it I guess. My friend Jurinko sent me the second one and he was playing SWF with him as he said. Us 3 were playing in KYF before, then I left and he played SWF with him.

Scott Jund played Leatherface with Speed Limiter add-on and his usual playstyle (no camping and no tunneling). It was fun, he had lots of 4Ks

This looks so disturbing.
---
I can't wait untill luck affects loot required from chests. My main ace will be so happy
---
I would have to say yes!  Even if they did fix it, somehow they would find a way to bring it back in a future patch. 
---
I find it amusing how bad their programmers are, assuming they have any...I somehow get the feeling the programmers are contractors and change every 3 months.  
---
Athletic body tho 
---
Yep. Back before I had my usual perks on Ace, I had a daily to unhook people as Ace. Sprinted full map &amp; Dead Harded to get there before second stage &amp; as soon as I was close, a natural 4% unhook (pre-Deliverance.)
---
Have fun going on a strike that no one else is going to join you on.....why are you announcing this on reddit.
---
You must be correct then. For months they refused to implement something that apparently takes a simple afternoon to start and complete.
---
well if you truly are good, and just receive a lot of flame from toxic survivors, your problem is that you care about what random internet strangers are saying to you. why would you care about their opinion? you will literally never see them again in your life
---
They are planning to add it in the future, but cureently it's not the case
---

please god buff freddy :(

make it 7k or no deal:P
---
The only other explanation is that the refused to implement something incredibly important, that apparently just takes a simple afternoon to start and complete.
---
Does it matter if it's KYF or not? Hacking is hacking
---
I'm not much of a critic, so I'm gonna say it looks really good. I like it as a funko head, but yeah add color 
---
I use a controller unless I'm playing huntress and sometimes nurse. Definitely use controller with Billy though, I feel the mouse and keyboard controls with his chainsaw are atrocious but that might be just me

Does plunderers instinct have a secondary use then?

I think he means de-rank or purposefully losing/disconnecting in the hopes of losing pips and moving down the ranking system instead of up. 
---
Pig's is shortest and Hag's is longest (?)

it should be in the appdata from there you can disable frame rate lock,vsync and settings for sensitivity 
---

People would have to be salty as fuck to send ps4 messages... Dbd has no end game chat on ps4 afaik
---
In that case:

It's possible, but only up till rank 15, if you want to go lower, you'll need to wait till rank reset
---
New Nurse mori?
---
*Arrivederci*
---
It really shouldn’t matter m8
---
it is on some killers with no map pressure at high ranks. granted, there are lots of bad survivors at high ranks but there also lots of good ones.
---
* Remove the Fog effect in the dream world for Freddy. This is my fucking world why would I make it harder on me to see, dammit
---
* Survivors slowly and passively fall asleep while in the lullaby radius, Freddy can still pull them into the dreamworld manually.
---
* Make the lullaby radius larger
---
* Make it harder for survivors to leave the dream world. I say make it so the survivors can only wake up if a friend helps them, or they heal themselves
---
* When all four survivors are in the dream world, Freddy goes into "Nightmare Mode" where Freddy can instadown survivors, and the terror radius is reduced
---
* You cannot go into "Nightmare Mode" if any survivor is dead
---
really it can see in lockers?  wow, I thought lockers blocked all, not surprised.  no wonder so many people DC wiht Legion and its funny how so many want to buff him.  Yeah that will fix it haha
---
Well you get to use that item in the match and its easier to locate the crates.
---
Pretty sure it's allowed. I've used it before and haven't had any problems.
---
I see nothing wrong with this.
---
Thats how matchmaking is suposed to work.
---
You may not like it, but thats what peak performance looks like.
---
Don't worry all the memes posted on here are trash and shit the whole subreddit gets ruined because of it.
---
KYF is a private mode. It practically single player.
---
If you dont like it leave at endgame. Why remove a feature for all cause you dont like it
---
And? You still have to go online to play dbd, and bypass the anti cheat even to hack in KYF.
---
Several people with 2000 hours played specifically stating they've been banned for nothing makes you think if the guy really only bans hackers. Of course that's something a hacker would say but I'd guess he hands out bans just because he can.
---
How would you go about reporting him?
---
I don't even think it's a bug. The game just doesn't change the collor because it could be distracting for the survivors and it would mean slightly more work for the game programmers
---
I do like it. Just pointing out it's pointless. I love all forms of salt
---
Exactly
---
I find the Nurse blink wailling a lot more unsettling than the Huntress singing.
---
Gameplay is fine, but the bugs are getting pretty bad. I had more game crashes after the latest patch, than Ive had in years, not to mention the infinite loading screen seem to happy far to regular now.  It sucks
---
why tho?
---
Leatherface chainsaw sounds are still f-up, so Id say they arent fixed at all...get BVHR LOL
---
Nobody cares about hacking because it's "bypassing the anti cheat". 
---
Hacking is looked down upon because it ruins the game fro people. If it's with friends who know what's going on, it's not an issue
---
Myers:whas that?  You wanna go brah? huh?!
---
honestly, for me, it just depends on my mood. like if i’m sorta messing around or the people really outplay me i’ll just not camp and not care. but other times if it’s a really toxic survivors (like tea-bagging) i’ll camp when the gates are open. it’s really just more if you want to or not. survivors and killers will find any way to find something to be mad about if they really want to, so i wouldn’t worry too much about it. they only time i think camping is bad is if it’s the first time the person is hooked and it’s like the beginning of the game. it’s just really unfun. 
---
mistar_z consistently makes the funniest and highest quality memes!
---
Most of my post-game chats are silent or non-confrontational. So I don't see it as a bad thing. And you can always just hide it on your side.
---
Possible use? Compliment good plays, ask for opinions/advices.
---
The devs said 19:00 UTC in their last stream. So head to google and type "19:00 UTC to (whatever your time zone is)" and that will tell you when it starts.
---
I more meant what would cause him to get instabanned? He could definitely crank out a few videos and streams before the devs catch him. And if he censors his name there’s very little chance they’d actually ban him.
---
&gt;Fact: killers can win games with no perks or add ons
---
At what? Rank 20? Or in fantasy land? You do realize that in the E-Sports tournament that only Nurse without any perks or add-ons could only kill 1 or maybe, maybe 2 Survivors. Any other Killer doesn't stand a chance especially without perks or add-ons. It's obvious you didn't see that tournament (or maybe you did but just want to be a contrarian) because every other Killer got their shit mercilessly pushed in.
---
&gt;fact: this game isnt as difficult to perform well in as you make it seem
---
It's pretty obvious that you don't use Killer. The funny thing is that I half-agree with you because it's insanely easy to play Survivor especially with the multitudes of 2nd chance/comeback mechanics they have at their disposal.
---
&gt;fact: plenty of great killers have no problems dealing with DS despite it being a strong perk
---
And what Killers are you referring to? Aside from no-names that have probably 5 followers on Twitch or maybe your butt-buddies that you know from KYF matches? Because every single Killer that has made it to rank 1 and stays at rank 1 like Zubat, Tru3Ta1ent (I know you assholes hate him but I'm mentioning him regardless), Bahroo, Marth, and etc have all stated multiple times over that (1) the balance is a joke and (2) DS is cancer. It's pretty clear that you either don't know what you're talking about or playing the role of a contrarian most likely because you use DS and don't want to see it nerfed or removed because you rely on it. 
---
Meanwhile, pretty much every single Killer would agree to have NOED removed the game and probably another really good perk or two in addition like say Bitter Murmur or even BBQ IF, key word, IF, IF DS was straight up removed from the game. 
---
no, you can definitely go back to rank 16
---
I love how im getting downvoted for this
---
Left click bot. Should've report this player
---
You can go back to rank 16, but not by depiping. You can only go back via rank reset
---
My point is that it's still hacking, and they've bypassed the anti cheat and he has the potential to go into public matches and do it. 
---
Wait give me a sec, I might be switching up rank 15 and 16
---
Sayori next survivor confirmed
---
i mean, you aren’t wrong. it’s just i’m new to computers so i don’t really know what’s good/worth it and my budget right now isn’t that much :(
---
No, the cap is 15, can't rank down more
---
Lmao *and possible two other perks like bbq*
---
That would actually be a nice change 
---
Go play on console if you don't want the post-game chat. 
---
Not being able to discuss a match in the end game lobby is so primitive. 
---
Why remove BBQ? It counters camping
---
Someone else needs to be close by as well, for KI to proc
---
The sub is dominated by Survivor Mains who live in their own reality. It's as simple to that. To these mongoloids; Survivor is perfectly balanced, DS is fair, every single Killer is massive overpowered and the devs need to nerf them ASAP.
---
 This is what these morons actually believe. Meanwhile, all I'd like is DS significantly nerfed and/or removed and matches to last longer than 5 minutes and not be forced to use Ruin. Requesting this literally makes you Hitler to these people. That's how deep the rabbit hole of mental gymnastics goes with these people. 
---
that is a very good point, playing both sides and reading this reddit will give you all the power to be the biggest and most toxic player in the world MUHAHAHA
---
Nurse nerf
---
Sure, then let's also remove the online feature, it's only toxicity and serves no purpose for the game
---
How do words like "soyboy" or "ree" imply any kind of politics? You are the one inserting that into the conversation and probably need to take a step back from the internet if words like that "trigger you" and your paper thin skin. 
---
Neither NOED or DS bothers me in any way whatsoever, so I guess no?
---
r/buildapc man check it out they will sort you out, when i was building mine they gave some good advice 
---
Im only rank 16 on pc and i dearly wish i had it as teachable already, even on this low rank i barely get a game without swf genrush. 
---
well yeah I don't use NOED and dstrike is a pain to waste my time getting rid of if someone brings it in.
---
Though it IS hilarious when people using meta perks get thrashed and others escape. I can't lie that I tend to lean towards murdering those trying to get an advantage outside of skill.
---
Dribbling is a legit tactic per the Devs.
---
Dribbling A) Takes twice as long and B) has limited range. It's a very situational counter to a perk that is otherwise uncounterable.
---
I would be a spur of the moment rager in the sense of playing battlefield on a streak and being killed by camper or a situation i felt i shouldnt have. In dead by daylight i’l say to myself how has that hit when if its a real rangy one. But I now feel the calmest ever after playin for a few hours and even getting camped I don’t the need to message them. Not sure why that is. 
---
UNBAN LORD OCHIDO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEND YOU MESSAGES
---
I absolutely agree that while playing Nurse, the most important skill is tracking and dealing with loss of LoS, but as you said yourself, tracking is gamesense, which is always being improved even when you're not playing Nurse. 
---
And while I agree that there are things you can do to make it harder for a Nurse to hit you, if the killer is pretty good, I don't think there's much you can do, and the Nurse players I mentioned are at the level imo. It's not like they rely on 3-blinks/omegablink or everyone just runs in a straigh line against them without trying to juke/ break LoS.
---
I have never played on anything but console and my experience with post game interactions have been mostly positive
---
You used to be able to complete 4 generators with 30 seconds of match starting, flashlight blinds were pretty much instant for a little bit, exhaustion perks would recover mid chase, a bunch of stuff. It’s a bit more even now but unless the killer is a spirit, huntress, or nurse it’s still pretty much up to the survivors whether they win or not. It’s the reason why you see so many of those killers in the high ranks, (and then billy bc of mobility but he can still be looped) those three killers actually have equal or more influence on whether the killer gets a hit or not at a loop.
---
They're better but yeah its still not right, and LF's chainsaw...how was this missed? Did they just not bother because they intend to do more later? Its been six fucking weeks. The game looks like its early access with all the audio issues.
---
Big dick energy
---
damn...thats tough

---
I frequently play with my boyfriend or with one other friend (so usually duo queue if I'm SWF, mostly solo overall,) and sometimes it'll randomly give us like a 20+ minute queue. If we both restart the game simultaneously then try again, we're back to 2-3 minute queues.
---
Granted, we're all in green or purple ranks &amp; usually stop playing for the month before we get to red.
---
This is just my opinion but here it is. I think there isn't enough killers at high rank. I play both sides at red ranks 
---
Im actually fine with DS. 
---
I am not fine with gens popping in 10 seconds into the match and survivors looping me through T-windows untill they force me to stop chasing them and go look at the remaining 1 gen that popped during the chase.
---
All i want them to add is pallet block. The same thing they did to windows, but with pallets. If a survivor vaults a pallet 20 times in a row the pallet should be blocked for a couple of seconds.
---
Im a bit baffled how they didnt fix his chainsaw, I played him yesterday and I didnt realize that the chainsaw makes no noise for him either. Kind of messed me up a bit as I relied on the noise when it was fully charged.  But is the chainsaw noise a buff to him, I have to say it is haha
---
I think it was a case similar to other online games where a character is released overturned but since nobody knows how to play him 100% right within the first week, he appears to be weak until everyone learns
---
 An average legion with purple add ons can still fuck you up if you uses his brains little bit.
---
And 1 or 2 more? INCLUDING BBQ? Hell, no. I don't care about NOED, but removing BBQ? Get your dirty hands off my precious BPs!
---
LOL ahahah that's creepily awesome.!
---
144.......wow I play with 25 fps on average how do you get that many frames?
---
Had a guy that claimed I tunneled him despite never hooking anyone in the match twice in a row, just because he got caught doing a gen out in the open and apparently I should have ignored him because he was hooked “recently”

I main Doctor, and I also play Hag, Nurse, Billy and occasionally Trapper &amp; Freddy
---
Pig, trapper, wraith, are all fairly short.
---
Myers, hag, leatherface, spirit, clown, and legion all unnecessarily long. Interestingly those are the better animations.
---
M&amp;K all day. Controller is not so bad for survivor, but you just get much better control with M&amp;K. Doesn't take long to pick up mouse and keyboard since you don't need very specific inputs, plus the more you play with M&amp;K, the better your muscle memory will become for playing other PC games.
---
danger zones!! brilliant idea, as simon cowl would say: youve got four yes is
---
Thank you💕 It really got out of hand
---
There are 3 hook phases: Phase 1 (First Hook) , Phase 2 (Struggle), and Phase 3 (Death). Survivors have a bar underneath their status in the bottom left of the screen to show the hook progression. If a survivor gets hooked and does not get rescued before they reach 50% progression they will go into Phase 2. If rescued they will then die on their next hook as they reached Phase 2 already.
---
The other day I saved all the RBTs for end game and all four players tried to run straight out of the gate. I was severely confused lol
---
I kind of like the idea of however long you have noed in the game, that's how long you have it at the end. Kinda puts pressure on people with noed 
---
This is good pasta material
---
This means that survivors can be killed after 1 hook if not rescued or 2 hooks if not rescued before Phase 2.
---
I fail to see a point here.
---
&gt; I’m aware the perk is in play almost every game at rank 12-1. However, it isn’t a game changer unless you let it be a game changer. 
---
You are another person who choses to live in fantasy land. Realistically, to humor your autistic ass, these are my choices:
---
Find the DS player, obviously the Obsession because - of course - Killers are not made aware if non-Obsession players have DS or not because reasons, I either chase them or I don't. If I chase them what am I rewarded with? I'll waste precious time, at least a minute unless I'm using Billy/Nurse, down them and they get away and we start the chase over again.
---
It takes 80 seconds for one Survivor to complete a gen. A chase could take about a minute depending on the perks the Survivor is using and map RNG.
---
So, if I down the DS player I get rewarded with anything.
---
If I abandon the chase, let the DS user do whatever he wants, then this person can do gens with impunity. The downside for this, which your autistic ass doesn't recognize, is that the players who AREN'T using DS(or at least not the Obsession) are now the one's who get chased especially if the Killer stumbles upon a group of Survivors. 
---
You think it's perfectly fine that a Killer can commit to a chase and get rewarded with nothing.
---
You also think it's perfectly fine that other Survivors not using DS get chased, downed and then killed because the Killer is now focusing on them. See above.
---
Fact: you have no idea what you're talking about and/or deliberately lying because you use DS and don't want to see it nerfed or removed. 
---
Huntress fits into the axe murderer category
---
oh thanks!! i’ll definitely check it out :)
---
Legion maxes his brutality every game anyways so it doesn’t really matter
---
Couldn't you say that to the survivor that gets caught with the exit gates open though?
---
No because I don’t think either perk is that big a deal. Yea they can be annoying but with ds I’ll just let them do it depending on when and where I am because it’s only once and it not hard to find them after sometimes.
---
With noed it’s easily countered by just leaving, if you see the icon and know they have it, I’m sorry guy who just got hooked I’m leaving. I see it all the time ppl run out and get the whole team killed because the 3 left don’t want to leave the one guy then come say noed is dumb and they didn’t earn those kills
---
I mean here’s the faults with the killers in North America:
---
Trapper: Disarmed or shit RNG
---
Wraith: Flashlights
---
Billy: 360’s (at worst, I can manage with my chainsaw)
---
Nurse: None
---
Huntress: Hatchets (if you can hit your shots you’re fine)
---
Myers: inability to stalk (farm is the worst)
---
Hag: crouched past traps (because they have the patience) or destroy with flashlight
---
Leatherface: Don’t get me started (imo, worse than Freddy)
---
Doctor: Unless you time the shock therapy perfectly, you’ll get endlessly looped.
---
Freddy: Self. Care. Skill. Checks.
---
Pig: you need crate of gears and tampered timer.
---
Clown: you’ll be fine if you can utilize the bottles correctly.
---
Spirit: haven’t played her enough but so far iron will is the best counter, but I can manage.
---
Legion: none.
---
Granted, killers have their faults but at red ranks it’s difficult to play at that level because you’ll get survivors that run DS and say “ez” but they need these crutch perks. I don’t run NOED on any killers either (besides scratched mirror Myers for obvious reasons), and if you’re at red ranks they’ll know majority of the totem spots so ruin/huntress lullaby is virtually useless because if it doesn’t spawn in front of them, it’ll be gone within 1 minute. Oh, and I’ve played on both sides of the game, so don’t give me that “baby killer main crying.” I don’t use crutch perks like that and I live within the red ranks at survivor too.
---
I waited and waited last night for my first game of the night. Gave up and switched to a different game 40 minutes later. No dodges.. Never even saw a lobby. Xbox.
---
I don't use either, so yeah sure remove them both, I don't rely on crutch perks
---
Then it's down to skill. I frequently play at rank 15 on both sides without Ruin and I/the killer always does well. Don't assume it's SWF just because they are doing gens

Bingo. Nothing quite says “totem over here!!!!” Like a billy chainsawing to the other side of the map in the first few seconds of the game. 
---
I mean, like I said, these figures are still very meaningful, they're just limited to your own experiences, and since it's not really possible to get anything else, these are as legitimate as we're likely to get. Fantastic work!
---
My points weren't mean to disparage the statistics at all, more to give context to them.
---
A gaming PC, It's pretty old but still good enough to run dbd.

Define "fun to verse"
---
He has no counter, for starters.  You can hit people nonstop with virtually no cool down, run at near-sprint burst speed for far longer than a surv can with SB, quickly vault pallets, windows, etc.  
---
Legion is just the least skillful killer, you have a guaranteed down by playing him regardless of anything a survivor can do.
---
Not to mention, if a survivor starts mending and you happen upon them, their only choices are to let you hit them into the dying state or stop mending and fall into the dying state.
---
He is easily the worst designed killer in the game.   
---
No problem.

Cool!
---
It's the Freddy release all over again. It's just Survivors being mad because they're bad and not much more than that. This sub is dominated by Survivor Mains. 
---
I stopped at "legion main"
---
This was already beaten to death, dude. 
---
Not yet. They're planning on adding 'em. Can't remember when exactly
---
Nah yea I agree, a lot of the art posted here is average at best and the cosplays, whilst good aren't what I'm looking for on this sub.
---
But the real question is which of the 3 skins is the best
---
Mine is hag with mint rag and myc. 
---
Hahaha, you don't get to say that what it says on the Steam page doesn't matter. It's made by the devs themselves, and is their words.
---
That doesn't deny the fact that there are definitely people who will be selfish and their playstyle will be selfish.
---
There are also perks and builds for selfish players and their playstyle. Your point?
---
Again, on the same Steam page, the devs say you can work together or just go it alone. Like I said: this isn't a team game at all.
---
Yeah, definitely agree with you there. Gens should be upped by at least 20 - 30 seconds. The window gets blocked after 3 consecutive vaults if im correct, same should be done with pallets. If the pallet is blocked i feel like it does enough to fuck over the survivor, and making them jump over a couple of times wont really waste any time.
---
Ds should only be applied when the wiggle meter reaches a certain point, i think 35 is fine as it is. Just no obsession bullshit. Everybody has the same meter, obsession or not. 
---
Why didn't you hook even one of them?
---
I mean, I'd agree, but his FASHION SENSE.
---
If he just had better fashion, he'd be 100% totally bangable, but oh my god his taste in clothes is horrifying and any self respecting gay man wouldn't be seen DEAD standing next to him.
---
David's just straight up sexy muscle fuel, Dwight has his approachable nerd look going on, Ace is dressed in a form fitting tailored suit, Tapp and Bill both get bonus points for being men in uniform. 
---
Once he gets good cosmetics, it's game over for everyone else, but he needs to sort out his wardrobe smh.
---
Damn how many flashlight blinds have you being subjected to for your eyes to bleed?
---
I bet your trapper no ruin games are pretty consistent!
---
You can disable it, if you wanna avoid reading toxic comments post game.
---
Because you can run insta-down killers around the map all game if you're good enough. You have a set time before you go down against Legion, regardless of how well you know the tiles or how well you can juke. It removes the chase mechanics from the game and it is irritating to play against. Much like playing against nurse, except she requires execution to get her hits.
---
It doesn't mean Legion is strong, because he can still get gen rushed. It's just the feeling of inevitability when being chased by Legion. 
---
So many my eyes popped out :’(
---
it's also annoying af when a gen gets done and you can't see the survivors going left or right
---
Ngl I've run that last one
---
If something cool happens during the match u can talk about it.
---
Yes, survivors are usually the worst.
---
Some time ago I was playing as Pig, and after hooking someone with BBQ, I saw a Meg spinning while standing on the same spot on the other side of the map . I instantly realized she was stuck into a tree, so I went there, I downed her, picked her up and let her wiggle so she could run and I even let her go to a teammate and get healed. 
---
I ended up with a 3k, 2 gens left and gave the last guy the hatch after downing him.
---
I went expecting some recognition in postgame chat, but oh boy I was so wrong, I got called everything.
---
BeCauSe dOInG it FaSteR mAkeS tHe BaR gO fAstEr
---
Hardly. Maybe once it comes to steam, but right now, it's no match
---
This sub is like 80% killers bud. That's why it's always so biased
---
They don't all last the same time. Like, clown is far longer than pig
---
No? Not at all. Legion just isn't fun. Playing against him is just no brain hold forward simulator. Playing as him is just no brain hold forward simulator. You can't even counter it.
---
High priority.  
---
More than fixing the game and balance it, but when you're a bunch of failure what can you do about that.
---
I'm getting Junior. So pretty brown color
---
Wanna bet the next killer is Bubba v.2.0?
---
Whoah
---
I just remembered i don't care
---
Why is cheburator1337 still working for you guys when he's a speed hacker and bans people just to make fun of them?
---
Hex: Ruin is absolutely mandatory perk for any killer that isn't a Nurse or Legion and even for them it's just that much more powerful because of the pressure (put Doctor in there as well). It's just insane how 4 generators can be completed just a bit over a minute after the game starts.
---
I'm finally coming to the conclusion that this game is just shit. Its just BAD game. It's so fucking poorly designed into this simplistic catch-the-survivor piece of shit of a game. Killer can't make even one fucking mistake without the survivors immediately capitalizing on that by getting +50% progression on a generator. And because the game is so fucking poorly done at its core there is nothing they can change in it without completely fucking it up. Maps are too small for more objectives and yet they are way too large for killer to abandon a chase and go check on a generator across the map. And the maps with multiple height levels to them? WHY THE FUCK ARE GENERATORS UP THERE. Survivors are given a full minute warning before a killer can even clamber up and reach the generator because of the terror radius bullshit. Survivors are too visible to do anything else other than run away from killer and the fucking scratchmarks make no sense whatsoever when one of the avenues for escape is supposed to be misleading the killer into a path the killer doesnt think the survivor would take. BUT NO. THERES FUCKING SCRATCHMARKS. THIS WAY, KILLER. CAN SEE THEM ACROSS THE MAP. THERES A SURVIVOR WHO CLICKED SHIFT. It's SO DUMB that it truly baffles my mind when people are talking about this game as if it had any resemblance of depth to it. Scratchmarks are there just to further trivialize the gameplay and it ultimately boils down to: Killer chases 1-2 survivors, 2-3 survivors repair generators. Either survivor gets hooked and 1-2 guys go to rescue or survivors just repair all generators. Oh yeah and the t-bagging. Why the FUCK does survivor have TIME to do that? The pallets should be designed so that if the survivor stays there with the pallet and stunned killer even for ONE SECOND they fucking DIE. Why is the killer such a fucking joke in this game? Nothing more than interactive AI with limited mobility, limited ability and limited threat. What a great power position. Survivors hold all the reins from the start of the game till the end and the devs pretend like its the other way around. The game is for survivors to lose, not for killer to win. If the killer "wins", survivors have SERIOUSLY FUCKED UP MULTIPLE TIMES. Maybe remove the fucking ranking system since you're balancing this shit game around R20 where nobody has any fucking perks, addons or clue how to play this fucking PIECE OF SHIT GARBAGE ASS GAME.
---
Oh yeah. I can't WAIT for the new killer. It's either going to be exactly the same as all other killers apart from Nurse or Legion, i.e. the new killer is SLOW AS FUCK like all others. OR its going to be like Nurse or Legion who ignore survivor survival mechanisms. HMMM OH BOY I CANT WAIT.
---
I had a game where I hooked a survivor, then he used deliverance and stood there until I hooked him again in which he suicided, that was paired with his friend dcing, leaving their two teammates to die
---
Can't we get a fifth one where BHVR actually rework it ?
---
that's great, thanks for the info
---
Ahh yes, The Bing Bing God card. Wouldn't have thought of it myself. That's clever but also painstakingly obvious.
---
its only temporary, thank god, it would be fucked if they perm banned players who just wanted to skip the grind
---
Tying DWT to TR would make M&amp;A a really good perk on Legion then. 
---
The devs said they won't make a killer who has anything to do with religion.
---
(insert We are Legion joke here) 
---
Claudette
---
Honestly, the dude is just abusing game mechanics and ranking system.
---
He isn't cheating. He should be allowed to play.
---
Yeah, he is super toxic but so many rank 1 players without an online personality are as well.
---
It's so easy to be "toxic" in this game.
---
Flashlights? Toxic. Looping? Toxic. Meta perks? Toxic.
---
Maybe if the community wasn't so filled with pussies maybe they would realize thay this dude is just annoying and everyone know who he is.
---
Banning him solves nothing, just points out the bias
---
Yeah think i just have to ignore some of the people i guess. I honestly very rarely camp, and when someone unhooks with me being 2 feet away i always focus the person who did the unhooking.
---
Always try to keep the game fun for everyone but my god. Even if i play it nice always get that one salty person who just feels to shit all over me in the end xD
---
Oops. Just realized I didn’t name the chapter. You guys can come up with that. 
---
So basically synonymous. That's new I hadn't heard that before.
---
I don't like the fact that devs ban people for abusing game bugs instead of fixing them, it's not the players fault it's in the game. If I ever encounter a shitty survivor bugging out on top of autohaven rocks I just ignore them, there's nothing to do. If someone is jumping lockers just to get my attention, I ignore them. Toxicity happens only if you take time to get triggered by it.
---
go play last year or f13
---
Yes he rekt us in like 5 minutes with a hatch standoff. He won that too because he was not smart.
---
So what if he has elitist behavior? Are dbd players forced to act a certain way? 
---
He is a cunt, but should be allowed to play nevertheless.
---
Understandable, can't think of too many ways it would go well. Still, major part of the genre, so it's a shame it'll be missed
---
Ok i see I thought i saw the "fun to verse" because there weak kind of bias. But i see your point 
---
What about the other killers?
---
just make hex totems looks like dull totem.
---
Its not that they are weak. Its that they don't have interaction or counterplay
---
In my opinion,   
---
Legion and the doctor are my worst nightmares. Legion is fast and very hard to spot on a map, he looks like any other survivor. Very hard to loop against.  
---
To add on this, after you get past rank 20, things seem to get easier for matchmaking. Something about the number of rank 20 killers to rank 20 survivors searching for games.
---
Gatta love it when people realise they fucked up &lt;3 love you too bro.
---
Devour hope only reveals itself after a person gets hit just like NOED
---
Highly recommend the series, it’s pretty good and it has a pretty big community, especially for memes
---
Insidious would be nutty
---
These kind of interactions are the best in this game honestly. It just sucks that the bad ones stand out more.
---
Insidious on Piggy
---
*angrier sounding heavy breathing*
---
Not a bad idea tbh.
---
Be doctor in treatment mode, then you can just walk in the general vicinity of your totem (make sure not to look directly at it!) and if someone’s there they will scream!
---
&gt;This sub is like 80% killers bud. That's why it's always so biased
---
# FAKE NEWS
---
Yeah, fucking right. Then why the fuck is every thread that criticizes the balance, which directly affects Survivors, like DS nerf and/or removal, extending time to complete gens, bad map design (such as the center building in Disturbed Ward or the loops in Macmillan maps) are immediately down voted and OP is told to stfu? Kiss my fucking ass you delusional piece of shit. 
---
Camping is being in the map after hooking someone
---
That’s probably for the best tbh
---
You are trying really hard to force your low effort memes today, arent ya. 
---
They've never revealed the exact %'s sadly. Believe me, I've tried to get them to answer it in their Q&amp;A's but to no avail.
---
I know people on here have manually gone through and compared, I think it was 100, bloodwebs on the same killer at 0 prestige, and prestige 3 and found a minimal difference. I sadly don't have the link but I believe the did it on the Trapper and the Spirit if you want to go digging.
---
tl:dr, Whatever the % is, it's so small that Prestiging just for rarer items is going to make you sad.
---
&gt; Yeah, definitely agree with you there. Gens should be upped by at least 20 - 30 seconds.
---
It's really the simplest solution to the problem. It's the same effect that Dying Light has. But the devs refuse to make this very simple QOL change because... Well, Survivors don't want that. If you bring this up then they relentlessly cry and say it's too hard and too boring. No, seriously. Alternatively, the devs could change it so that they have to complete 6 gens instead of 5 which would have the same effect. But nope, denied, Survivors having "fun" is more important than anything resembling game balance.
---
Angrypug is worst than ochido, change my mind
---
The first step to fixing a problem is admitting you (I) have one. 
---
Love Players like these. Both the Killer and the two survivors,always great to see Players do something "casual" compared to the usual tryhard and toxicity. 
---
Keep it up!&lt;3
---
No it is so my friend could not see my 2500 bloodpoints.

---
No
---
Blood points, shards, anything at this point
---
Did they hold true to their name? I would love to DC against you , with them! I’ve gone against too many with a Mori and the Mixtape add ons to be fun. I would rather an iridescent Huntress. 
---
Doesnt really matter does it? Still shows him as a fucking creep and that you shouldnt just try to fuck every girl you come across.
---
Ah, yes. It appears David doesn't know how to counter the tall furry. Fair point, good sir/ma'am/something in between

---
Red ranks?! Now that's EPIC 😎👌😂😂
---
I swear you're the same people who watch those "sjw gets destroyed" videos. There's multiple reports of him asking underage girls for nudes, a lot of them
---
He has also done a lot of exploits in dbd 
---
And it's their game, they probably wouldn't care if he was here or not
---
Youtubers have exposed him on yt because the girls who were harrassed talked to them. He basically was asking girls for nudes... maybe some of them were underaged (I don’t remember the video correctly), but even then that should be enough. If you want the video search on yt “Biggest manchild ardetha” and you should find it. 
---
I just have killers face camp me when im the last to be put on the hook incase I 4%.

No I only found out who he was yesterday, I watched a video for context and he is annoying to listen too. 
---
Everyone today is on him I just wanna know the story. 
---
So he was asking girls for nudes on twitch? What kind of exploits? 
---
Not a fan just curious 
---
No need for sarcasm, I'm just stating the facts and I think most people can admit that u really need it at those ranks
---
Correlation does not equal causation.
---
I get that the timing is interesting, but it's literally impossible for them to have created and implemented the system between the release of 2.5 and it's appearance. Even as a back end system its functionality would need approval from Sony and Microsoft, that alone would take more time than passed between 2.5 and console ban implementation.
---
I have no idea about the witch hunting, but I do know that there was a discussion about him soliciting inappropriate photos from underage female viewers. Whether that's true or not, I can't say.
---
I don't think that they'll ever be on sale. But it's more profitable to buy complete dlc's instead of just one of the characters
---
The only counter you have is the potential stupidity of the player playing.
---
He either is so stupid that he eats every pallet and gets noone,or he isnt and then there is literally no counterplay

---
The witch hunt refers to the way he would tell his fans to go bother people he didn't like in mass and on at least one occasion, put their effort into getting somebody banned because he wanted them banned. This is against the Terms of Service for DbD so he got banned for it.
---
The underage girl isn't related to his bans, but moreso an assessment of his character. He was somewhat notorious for asking his female fans for pictures, and then if he found them attractive, requesting nudes. The problem was that some of the girls he did this to were underage.
---
I agree 100%. I mained survivor for a long time but after trying killer I realized some of their complaints. Especially about survivor toxicity btw. Don’t tunnel, don’t camp, etc? Get called a loser, baby killer etc. in post game chat if you don’t 4k. 4K ppl mercilessly? Dead silent post game chat. 
---
What the survivor did is a nuisance, what the killer did was completely ruin another’s game. 
---
I don’t agree with either player but I think the killers that camp over tea baggers are worse than the baggers themselves. 
---
For devotions 1 &amp; 2, perhaps a small lump sum of extra bloodpoints. Past that, cosmetic options (one piece per devotion, covering all non-licensed killers.)
---
Misery love shouldn't damage the survivor by a health state, maybe the one healing them though. It could make healing sort of impossible though
---
Watch his compilations and see how he holds killers hostage and calls them funny moments. Watch Ardethas video. 
---
I would expect there to be work around but Freddy isn’t useful until endgame, where the most ideal situation is get everyone asleep, so gates open extremely slow with remember me and then add blood warden so they can’t bail. But during the game it isn’t good. Self care has the ability to completely render his power useless, but I still think he’s mid tier.
---
The difference is so small that it's negligible. You won't notice any difference at all. The only real benefits to prestiging are cosmetics and more stuff to grind for (yes that's a benefit)
---
Fairly sure that’s the joke 
---
Not on twitch, usually in WhatsApp or steam.
---
Exploits like holding the game hostage for other killers, and bringing himself lots of blood points and p3 all his characters messing with the game files. 
---
Split up from your team and pray you’re not the first one found. 
---
About the witch hunting: everytime he got destroyed or similar, he showed the steam profile of that person on twitch so that his 12 year old army would harass said person or report them. Correct me if I'm mistaken
---
literally just made a reply last night saying im not witch hunting him. 🙄
---
YOGURT
---
120 seconds can be very short though
---
I don't use them, I don't care
---
Genrush like if you were against literally any other killer.
---
eh, could be, but not taking my chances because i remember the guys profile picture under a different name and when i clicked to message him there was my previous messages. but who knows 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Hitboxes. M I rite? 
---
Same can be said why they can see survivor names in pregame lobbies and you can click on their names to see their steam profile...just kind of seems a bit inviting to be a nasty if needed
---
How about standing on scratch marks?
---
No I swear to god it’s always a baby meg
---
Someone came to unhook me when NOED was active and then of course he immediately got downed.
---
I thought about bailing for a hot second but couldn't do that to my random survivor buddy so went in and unhooked him and got downed myself. Oh well, I'd rather die with honor than survive as a POS.
---
when you realise batman likes boys in tights 
---
What's the justification when a survivor does none of those things and still gets camped? I want to hear OPs thoughts on that.
---
But this NEVER happens.
---
The games balance gets completely fucked by moris and st rank 1 killers average 45-50k bp which is enough for 1 bloodweb. With some mediocre luck you can easily get moris for several matches in a row. 
---
The killer can ignore 1/3 of their entire goal via Ebony’s. 
---
If they tunneled anyway the survivor would have a significantly more fair game as the killer doesn’t simply have to instadown them off hook to eliminate them. 
---
How long have you been playing DBD?
---
You can also choose not teasing the immortal killer that is hunting you down. 
---
Ignore the party chat, me and my friends just upload video clips to our youtube strictly to show each other funny moments of our games. 
---
Tapp
---
The killers not immortal, the entity controls what happens to them. 
---
Thanks for reposting this. Needs to be visible and the right people need to see it.
---
If misery didn't damage them one health state, these killer perks would all be pretty good.
---
For Escape plan i would slightly increase the time, and also have anyone who unhooks you not leave scratch marks
---
Finally, maybe not the ability to literally stop generators, and have survivors just get hindered by the vines
---
Everything else is good, however
---
I wrote David twice, I didn't realise I did, I will change it, but I counted him
---
Why is the survivor rate 50% then if Killers are a joke? The game is pretty even.
---
My favourite is being swarmed by them as your hooking and when you essentially delete a survivor because of they get pissy and say you camped. I DONT EVEN GET TO KICK THE GEN SOME GAMES T-T
---
Goddammit this joke is too old I shouldn't be laughing.
---
YO GET HIS A-.... what the fuck
---
Feel free to change it then, there are only 15
---
If you’re being overly offensive with class photo then you aren’t playing him to his greatest strengths. The timer seriously is not that big of an issue. Even when you tag the last guy it’s better to go back and pressure someone whos trying to wake up instead of the guy you just tagged.
---
Against solo survivors killers have a massive advantage. It honestly feels unfun to play solo survivor because since all the nerfs and changes it doesn’t really feel like the killer has to work for kills if the survivors aren’t together. Noob talked about it in one of his recent videos and it’s ridiculous what hits killers can pull off now.  
---
I play killer and it feels cheap. 
---
The game was never really that in favor of survivors when you look at the stats. It has always been 50/50 survive rate or worst. 
---
A good SWF definitely makes killer lives hell which is why I think the devs should consider giving a group chat option to solo survivors and balancing the game around that 
---
You can’t balance SWF when SWF is the only way to really have solid team work . Take SWF and you probably lose a huge portion of your player base which we don’t want. Just let the survivors communicate and do adjustments there

Are you launching the game via steam? 
---
We haven't gotten the evil/possessed nun or priest yet. 
---
No, no, we love the memes
---
You don't have to pay for windows as an FYI. You can download it from the windows website &amp; install via bootcamp and not pay for it. It just gives you a reminder to buy it to be able to personalize it. I've had it on my Mac since 2016 &amp; it still works.
---
IMO double cd addons are the way to go, you leave stun extremely fast to get the second hit normaly
---
what
---
Try repairing EAC
---
he sounded like a russian tho
---
Clown should be at LEAST S tier.
---
yup
---
Lol I absolutely love this! 
---
I forget.. Do hatchet throws trigger Franklin's or only primary weapon?
---
It's a shop exclusive cosmetic that comes around season in which you pay $99 to unlock
---
Three six T'ing
---
Probably still going to get away with it.  Unfortunately that’s the way things go.
---
Can’t you only go to 15
---
Sorry dude. :(
---
I don't think this guy is a community manager... Have you checked out his website and profile? His website is super obnoxious and so is his profile. It doesn't look like something that any company would want as the face of their company. This guy is just like those xbox live kids that say their dad is Bill Gates and that they can get him to ban you
---
Wait whaaat? I've played hundreds of hours on both console and PC and I think you're crazy if you think console is easier than PC. 
---
r/humblebrag
---
Technically should be reserved for players interested in technical mechanics, this should be hidden and on a wiki instead of a red bar. Maybe put a % for how fast it's being fixed so survivors know exactly what they are doing. 
---
How dare you compare mere Legion supporters to us, superior beings with anime profile pictures?
---
Couldn't change the title of the post but he is not a manager indeed. He's reportedly a community moderator as I've been told. Exactly though, it's not what a company would want their face to be, but unfortunately this guy really does ban people and if you look at the ban-list on his website you can see that those people have indeed been banned and him even replying on their profiles saying they've been banned. You can also look at the imgur I've posted underneath his website.
---
special exclusive cosmetics i would assume is the best way to go about it
---
Seems like a you problem.

"Me looking in the direction of hooked survivor"
---
"Killer appears out of hook aura cause I couldn't see shit in that direction" 
---
 Ddosing the obsession new meta
---
I bet she’s struggling, that fat clown fuck stabbed her right in the essenitals!
---
Incideous...
---
And by the way, this comes from a main Killer, that uses mostly Cypress moris and the others after hooking the survivors twice. I know it's unbalanced, boring and unfair, so I use it for challenges and to look at the kill scenes once in a while
---
Yes please! I want a place to throw my Engineer's Toolboxes.
---
We all memorized morsecode but you don't have to worry, most spam "Aaaaaaaaaa" and the low rank usually spam "b a b y K i l l e r"

Dont you know? If you disconnect, you win.

If only he was T-posing

Hello!  
---
The person you are reporting isn't a BHVR employee or a Community Moderator.
---
They are impersonating a member of our team, which is against the EULA as well as the Steam Guidelines.
---
Thanks for bringing this to our attention!
---
It's so eZ from pc to console, pc I way harder wtf, I've played 300 hours on pc and almost a hundred on console and console is so eZ to juke, loop and escape 
---
Usually two. Rarely 3. Never more than 3,it just messes everything up for me.
---
Thank you for responding :) I do wonder if he’s not any of that, how he has the ability to ban people?
---
I love how you made the guy Tapp with just a hat
---
Only thing I'd change is spirit with nurse. Imho spirit is actually hot
---
So you want to play a game? *oink*
---
Yeah I feel you. Had a Doctor loadout ready and at the last second accidentally change to Hag. Don't even know why they added that feature.
---
This is why Freddy is OP. He doesn't fall for such seduction. David is just a little too old for him. 
---
It must just be people he finds that have been banned from dbd and says he banned them, but that is one hell of a impersonation 
---
And Haunted Ground Tok 
---
Happy 23rd Birthday.

I doubt this

---
Nah, my internet connection really does not like. It kinda makes it hard to play online games of any kind because I'll be playing then all of a sudden I find myself booted off because my internet connection got lost. -_-
---
There are no servers, so they can't be down. 
---
I’d recommend the pig, she’s really fun to play. And she can support a wide variety of playstyles. 
---
Tunneled/bleed until hooked.
---
DS
---
1/5
---
Yeah it's happened to me a couple times. Really don't know why they added that feature.
---
Baby rage I guess
---
Ok relax :D his terror radius is not insanly big and if he chases a different person after a hit what you say he cant abuse the franks mixtape so he gotta choose.   
---
Thats why being stealthy is an option.   
---
if your good he wont find you until your almost done. survivor just forgot how to play stealthy since the meta shifted to being aggressive
---
Its from a Noob3 video, you can clearly see what happens there. I cant remember which video but i do remember it happening.
---
NOED is garbage, stupid baby killer l2p. Just because you can't apply pressure doesn't mean you should get freebie kills.
---
The reel thing is overcharge on freddy for those 200iq plays
---
That doesn't explain David!
---
As a spirit main, F for your addon loss
---
right... it's that hard to pay attention?
---
&gt;And delete noed
---
If DS goes with it, DEAL!!!
---
No addons for most people, nurse is muscle memory
---
Nice shitpost
---
2, but when I play survivor they ALWAYS use 3. Very unfairs
---
Oh yeah, I forgot that one 
---
No because it would put he survivors on totems instead
---
one of the reasons i was looking at him lol
---
There are times one must separate art from the artist.
---
she did reply you fucking nub
---
she told you that they're neither of the things you said, good lord
---
I don't see the issue with the killer being able to hit you from the other side of the hatch.
---
with certain killers they have long ass blades, which would make sense, with legion, freddy, clown, and Pig. it makes zero sense.
---
Maybe it's 16 because when you look at the list of survivors it says there's another one coming? (March if I remember right). Maybe having them listing as coming soon is messing with it.
---
Steam may handle some stuff, I'm not sure. But behavior has had server outages in the past unrelated to steam.
---
Why does the Clown smile at the perfect moment?
---
why
---
Kate and Feng at C what the actual fuck
---
Then killers should have 15, but it says 14
---
My last beads :,Dd
---
No need for the foul language. I’m just wondering how the person had the ability to ban if he’s not an employee.
---
I didn't even think about that, sounds like the way to go. Plus, Myers was the most voted on (so far)
---
Thats a not so bad idea if...
---
Big if, but if... They add a totem counter. This is a shitty band-aid solution to the gen rush meta, but it would some good ol chaos for a while. 
---
I was going to say 28 stab wounds but somebody else did it
---
Nah it hasn't people just hate him (understandable; witch hunting, exploits) so they will try to find every other reason to hate him.
---
people have explained to you that they're not actually banning
---
good god you were wrong let it go
---
ILLUSION 100
---
Oh Brenda
---
1. When multiple people run DS only one is the obsession, the others have to wiggle for the skill check to even appear making it less likely to be used unless a SWF is blocking hooks for them  
---
2. A lot of people act like the skill checks are super easy to hit but hitting a 4 'o clock DS is fairly hard  
---
3. The obsession can be dribbled or slugged (since you usually know they run DS for sure unless you're running obsession perks yourself, even then the obsession likely is running it)  
---
4. There are several perks that punish running DS or help you recover from the stun  
---
5. Let's be real, most DS users won't last more than 10/20 seconds after they hit it (still a waste  of time for the killer but that ate up 1 perk slot for them, assuming they are even able to use it at all).
---
My friends keep mentioning it I’ve just never got around to it. Tbh I kept thinking it was some Kids cartoon.
---
Yep, that's what i was thinking :)
---
Again, thats the fucking point, so survivors can move away.
---
Love it! Your art style is super cute!
---
Also friend: age is just a number
---
umm are you ok?
---
You know whats also just a number? 911
---
Google Shawnee Smith and tell me she wouldn’t be top tier here in comparison to everyone else lol.
---
This isn’t about being right or wrong. This is about an issue that possibly needs to be resolved.
---
Unfortunately you've stumbled into a survivor reddit, any buff to killers or suggestion to slow the game down "just a lil bit" will be met with extremism and downvotes galore. But don't let this dissuade you from spit balling ideas its how we can learn and improve everyone's experience. Most are in favor of finding a way to add objectives or slow the game down etc. But I believe fundamentally this games core gameplay is such a way thay any added objective throws the balance out the window and would turn from survivor sided to killer sided very very easily. Perhaps not built in NOED but I'm sure if we can all get off our entitlements we both sides (and those that 50/50) can come up with something that doesn't require the core gameplay to be rebuilt from the ground up.
---
Another killer without using headphones apparently 
---
Oh you're just a dumb troll, okay that makes more sense aha.

---
i’m the same way! i used to be a survivor main so i know how unfun it is when you get tunneled or camped or farmed and immediately put back on the hook so i don’t do that. but yeah, no matter what you’ll always get salty people 
---
You know what else is just number? 20...
---
Years in jail
---
It would great if there was a monthly reward based on your rank. Even if it's just a handful of Shards. I don't know what's the point of rank 1 now but it sure as hell isn't the challenge.
---
I mean if it’s working then there’s nothing wrong with it. If you down a guy and camp him while 3/4 gens pop then yah you’re a dick but if everyone is going for a save and no one is on gens then that’s the survivors fault not the killers, no one is progressing the game so why not defend the kill. Camping isn’t fun but if someone wins from it then they technically made the right play.
---
You made a claim
---
An actual official replied to you, saying you were wrong
---
You had another question
---
That wad explained to you
---
It is resolved. You're just arrogant and want to feel like a hero or something
---
Maybe some masochistic tendencies. They want to punish theirself even more 
---
I’d agree, duration, cd, or speed addons are the way to go
---
We were able to close the hatch in the first PTB but the Survivor side of the community bitched and moaned so loudly that it didn't make it out of the PTB. Then the devs said they want to completely redo the end game with no ETA as to when this actually goes through. In the meantime, we still have to deal with hatch standoffs and dickholes ragequitting so their buddy gets a free hatch. 
---
You know whats also just a number? 75: the size of your asshole in cm after 20 years in jail

Stop targeting me without a valid reason and calling me names. It’s extremely pathetic.

holy fuck the irony

Did someone really say “how do I turn up the AI difficulty”? 
---
Holy shit that is insulting lol
---
*sigh unzips
---
Does Franklin's work on her ambush attack?
---
Exploits? What the fuck are you talking about? What do you think exploits are?
---
Could be a DM and player conflict issue. So story time. In my dnd group a player ended up hitting on the DM's girlfriend and the girlfriend told DM. Now every other month said player dies or comes close to dying and has to make a new character every now and then or spend time somewhere healing for a few days. So a question did you fuck with the DM?
---
True. That’s why you use sloppy butcher and follow some of them discreetly. Stay out of line of sight like a shark underwater and when they stop to heal or cross your path then strike. You don’t ever want to follow them directly. Sometimes you gotta leave them which is fine
---
i believe you can safely file that reaction under "rage quit"
---
they think they're just going to get hooked and can continue to keep playing/possibly win, but the mori puts a quick stop to that
---
Lol everyone that downvoted you must be traumatized. Honestly could not give a shit about flashlight clicking and teabagging, those people usually are the first to get hooked in 15 seconds. You’re still playing the game. When you facecamp the survivor you’re doing 2 things: 1. Making the game unfun for yourself 2. Giving the survivor exactly what he wanted and 3. Making the game unfun for the survivor and everyone else in the lobby because it just became repair simulator. 
---
No add-ons at all. No additional blinks, no charge speed, nothing. She's still best killer that way.
---
you could say, they cant die because of that...  
---
if only there was a word for not being able to die...
---
Where am I targeting you and calling you names?
---
Idk to be honest. Usually it doesn't work with abilities, but maybe would work with Piggy's ambush?
---
Billy, Nurse and Huntress all have counterplay in the form of jukes and mind games from the survivor side and playing as them they have counterplay in the form of predicting a survivor's jukes and mindgames. All because these killers have very proactive abilities.
---
I'm sure someone else can speak for Trapper, Hag, Clown and the Wraith.
---
More cushion for the pushin
---
Feels like nurse .at least she's got fatigue:/
---
Its wayy better than it used to be, people cant derank past 15 so most people at low rank are low rank. Still some people are good who havnt played for a while.
---
Honestly pick any killer with normal movespeed and learn how to chase with that, experiment with killers till you find an ability to like
---
Good ol "whoever said the game was balanced" mclean. To his credit he did try and tell us optimization wasn't coming but nobody told mccote.
---
If it takes more than one minute to get a question I normally leave. This is likely a bugged lobby. Only time it takes a while as killer might be during an event.
---
Meh. Ruin is merely a time buyer. Put on presssure fast enough with Lullaby and it can be quite yummy. Look at all those failed skill checks showing me where literally everyone is. Oh look. Can't heal anymore! Oh look can't do gens now either! Mwahahahaha!
---
Combining Lullaby with Thanatophobia, Overcharge, Distressing, Unnerving Presence, Dying Light, Nurses Calling, and/or Coulrophobia is a great combo. Works best on The Doctor. Can work amazingly on The Pig as well, just use the addon that increases the time it takes to search key boxes, and also the one that increases skill checks on the key boxes. It's completely evil, but highly amusing. If I can get 5 stacks of Lullaby on either of those characters before 2 gens are finished, then I'm pretty much guaranteed the 4k. 
---
Whispers of the entity can help you with the tracking part. Hillbilly is kind of hard to learn, but if you plan on using him try to go for regular hits up close so survivors don’t juke you.
---
/u/not_Queen_bhvr can you guys please just nerf DS already? I mean, you added Legion and Survivors are bitching and moaning en masse and (FOR NOW) you guys are standing your ground. Which I appreciate. INB4 Legion gets the Freddy treatment next week. But FFS just nerf or remove DS. Grow some fucking balls and take away their cancer perk. 
---
Yup. It's just that you won't get this speed boost if you have that preset :D Because there would be no endgame
---
You are not even trying at this point lol just post the lowest effort meme as possible. Chill dude
---
What would the survivor buff be?
---
I mean when they slowed healing to slow the match down they, in the next big update, made it so prove thy self is a god perk at gen rushing. 
---
When it comes to killer buffs it's always 1 step forward and 2 steps back
---
You're targeting an employee, genius. You don't even have the moral fortitude to update your post with not_queen's response and you titled your submission as definitive despite not actually knowing
---
Equally I might say it is, no matter how much you say it isn't. If the add ons are changed, then by all means change the Wraith's too. That's pretty fair.
---
(Noob here, so maybe not the best opinion) I think it's alright.  If you want to let them go, then do it, but consider if you're doing it because you want to or if you think you should.  Everybody likes a long, fun game that's tense but you shouldn't be concerned with their opinion of you.  They're randos, so you'll probably never see them again.
---
Statutory rape duuuuud
---
Yeah, im gonna stop. For today. 
---
Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuud
---
Yeah, but I also accidentally counted Nea, so it's still 15
---
People say they heard it from Ardetha, and Ardetha says he heard it from people it happened to and a person that said he saw it happen to somebody else.
---
That's honestly about as "confirmed" as it would ever get, isn't it? You might feel the need to wait for screenshots of him actually soliciting nudes from underage people, but not many people screenshot their internet harassment so even if it's true I would be surprised screenshots exist.
---
but then be accused of smurfing or being toxic.
---
He got silver as well
---
It’s definitely annoying so I get that aspect of it and even worse when your team doesn’t actually do anything with that time lol if I see someone camping I just turn right around and go do gens.
---
Same thing for end game someone gets hooked and camped just leave because they will have noed and you and your team will get killed if you all try to go make saves
---
You know, plenty of people have told me NOED is bad on Huntress, yet it helped plenty of red rank games go from no kills to 3 kills.
---
Bill: I found this inside the school
---
no more surprise noed
---
Well, as it is I haven't gotten any wins (expected, I'm learning) which I'm not really worried about I kinda just got it to play with my friends.  It's just annoying when people only juke and taunt instead of going through the gate.  Am I wrong for just quitting, or should I have stuck it out?
---
I also saved my points as killer and managed to get to rank 7 but then I couldn’t rank up after that so I decided to finally spend my points and that made winning games so much easier. 
---
I recommend you play around with the killers and when you find one you like spend your points. For beginners the trapper is probably the easiest to use so start there.
---
Whispers of the entity is a perk that will tell you if a survivor is within a certain range of you. I varies from what tier perk you have, but it’s an all around good perk.
---
No no, it would be a different buff, probably breaking totems faster 
---
Well until the last patch it didn’t work at all so I think it’s okay :)
---
Found a Bill cleansing a spirit's totem when there was no ruin and I kept waving to get him off but NOPE HE NEEDS THAT 1000 BP
---
Nice.....
---
I haven't played any other characters.  Just played 2 matches last night and had to quit both bc the survivors wouldn't go through the gate.  I don't have my heart set on him or anything though.  If there's anyone that helps with tracking I'd be willing to try bc I've gone like 3 minutes without seeing anyone before.
---
not gonna lie, this definitely me
---
Yeah, I'm an achievment hunter, one less achievment to go. I don't feel bad about already having it because I was bound to gt the achievment sooner or later. I'll make shure to make a bug report
---
I mean it’s either that or you pull up at rank 1 looking like thanos with the infinity gauntlet, select nurse and just go wild. Only issue is that nurse gets boring fast.
---
In my opinion, Micheal Myers is one of the best designed characters in the game. He's very strong, I'd argue in the top 5 killers, but isn't broken by any stretch of the imagination. He isn't difficult to play, but he has a high skill ceiling and rewards you for investing time into learning him. In some ways he plays just like any other killer and rewards good fundamentals, but in other ways he plays totally uniquely and can do things that no other killer would be able to. The only things about him that are underwhelming are his perks. I think they did a really good job on him.
---
Yeah pretty much
---
Pretty sure this screencap is from Weezer/Weird Al's verison of Africa by Toto.
---
*Entity displeased*
---
Check Monto's Toxic Freddy. If I remember correctly the purpose is slow down their action speed as much as possible and keep them all always asleep. They literally can't do anything.
---
Thanks!  mkay, I'll try that.  I figured the generators was the easiest, but i wasn't sure if i was too focused or not.
---
Commenting cos I wanna see the results
---
Oh I know. But I feel like Lullaby works better than ruin does. I'm talking about when the hex actually stays up. By the time I've gotten 5 stacks gen progress is totally shut down. They won't even TRY to repair most of the time because it's too risky. At least with ruin you can keep going without alerting or keep tap repairing the gen if you can't hit the great skill check. 
---
Well try joing a community for dbd and find a kyf( kill your friends it's a private match) game that has a spot open and ask to play killer. Kyf dosent affect rank level or anything it's good to practise to learn killers and perks.
---
I want it 
---
Correct 
---
Oh and happy birthday! :D 
---
Borrowed time only effects camping tunnelers so I dont see the problem with it, if you have an insta down up there is even less reason to be tunneling off hook lol. Just hit the person unhooking
---
Jump Scare Myers is very weak against good SWF groups because they'll eventually have 2 people working on gens, and 2 people hiding with views from where Myers can approach, directing them when and where to run.
---
Against a standard SWF group, or randos, he's okay, sometimes.
---
I disagree. it's hard enough getting to Rank 1, and it's even harder to stay there. If you ask me; this picture depicts the gateway to hell, you've only seen a small chunk of the community at this point. (i'm NOT referring to you btw.)

montos recent freddy build is a an end game build, he's also got many other feel free to check em out 
---
*we never said that*
---
This has been my problem with a lot of killers.
---
Leatherface isn't a very strong killer, but you throw on some good addons and his chainsaw a ready in a second and he goes sanic-speeds right into your spine.
---
Not saying LF is top tier, even with addons, but the power differences addons make can be pretty fucking drastic.
---
This is getting out of hand
---
Freddy, the child rapist, not being on F Tier makes me concerned...
---
Had this exact situation against a 3 man SWF team. They all played fairly decent and I never hooked the same person twice until the exit gates were powered up. I downed a Claudette and hooked her by a door. Suddenly, one of her teammates are visible across the map, teabagging and waving at me. So, I nod, acknowledging the bait and starting towards them but they were prepared for the counter bait when I turned straight around and went back pulling her teammate off during the unhook. This resulted in the first survivor running for the original unhook and, ultimately them getting hooked as well. The salt levels and claims of camping even though the powered exit gate was nearby were tremendous. The only voice of reason was the Nea solo que that left when they began their shenanigans who stated, "Why wouldn't you have just left?!"
---
Survivors also frequently disconnect before being hooked a third time, in my experience. 
---
Don’t try to figure out why they do what they do- garbage people gonna garbage.
---
Legion really is underwhelming compared to all of the other DLC killers so far (imo)...
---
He's even boring/uninspired in design/looks. 
---
Ohcido’s final moments 
---
All I said is I’m from Britain and I’ve never seen anyone write it like that
---
I am not 100% sure but if you just die on hook or lose on purpose as a killer, it should be fine.
---
DCing to depip is an automated suspension once you reach the threshold. 
---
Except the entity could kill them at any moment, thus making them mortal. 
---
I mean its based on your experience of Freddy but I enjoy playing Freddy despite him being more difficult to play than other killers. The ability to track sleeping survivors is nice as it allows you to identify where the others are and if you manage to sleep more than one player you can slow the game down without the use of perks. 
---
He is still a difficult killer to play though as survivors more or less have 7 seconds by default to escape him before you can interact with them. Additionally, its relatively easy to escape the dream state making self care your worst nightmare.
---
Some of Freddy's perks are fun like remember me which can help greatly at the end game if coupled with noed and having blood warden is fun when the survivors realise last second that they are trapped with you.
---
This meme needs to die a fucking death. 
---
I always seem to lose the 1/3 of my Ruin totem being destroyed before they destroy either of my Haunted Ground totems. Then because I’m Spirit they ignore my totems for the rest of the game. Feels hex man.
---
Or just as the final gen is popped?
---
Or going back to save another survivor?
---
Fuck me for being altruistic, amirite?
---
Marry her

It’s in human nature to be a douche and for that reason alone I don’t think it’s reasonable to get so butt hurt over someone pressing ctrl a few times, as for flashlight spamming, who gives a shit? They’re actively wasting battery in an attempt to troll you, think of it in this way and they just look sad for doing it.

Your points are all dead on btw.

I feel the main reason people are not happy with my post is they think I see no issue with tea baggers at all. Simply stupid people not using that thing behind their forehead.

---
Blue? Are you sure about that
---
What do you mean by m1 killers?
---
Prove Thyself got buffed, Leader got nerfed and buffed at the same time, Surveillance got extra buffed, spies from the shadows got buffed, iron maiden got nerfed, technician got buffed
---
She made this one as a display item so there's no eye holes, u advise using a mesh type of thing where the gaps in the mask are
---
Feng at C? delete this nephew 
---
Wait does that mean I can't pull them out from the hatch unless they are asleep?
---
Well their average rank is 11 and your rank is 13, it’s not that bad
---
I was kinda making a joke. We all know how spaghetti coded DbD is.
---
I wonder if finding lobbies is worse on XBOX than on PlayStation. My friend and I were able to find games rather quickly this morning but like half of those games we kept getting killers that would dodge us cause all survivors would appear in the lobby at the same time. 
---
Well I don’t play as killer very often 😅 but yes. I’ve done most of my matches without using frenzy... I much prefer her that way 😂
---
You can hate on the killers poorly made gameplay but hating on people for enjoying the killers personality, lore, and look is just pathetic.
---
People say that until they end up on a map that is clearly not in the Huntress' favor. 
---
Then that NOED comes in handy when your hatchets get stuck on nothing.
---
Oh that's true - I only ever think about the casual aspect of this game.
---
No? Just because it was op back then doesn’t mean it still isn’t fucked. That argument doesn’t make sense....
---
How is that imbalanced, fair enough if its rank 1s vsing a rank 15 but those ranks arent that far apart
---
play against them 5 times in a row then we can speak again
---
move freddy and cannibal in the Z tier and Frank and Joe to S tier we're in agreement
---
He doesn't. I can guarantee you that only a small team of Associate Community Managers have the means to ban players. He is probably trying really hard to make it look that way.
---
"You didnt want to leave him a chance, huh?"
---
Its not about winning, its about sending a message.
---
leatherface in your closet 
---
Then stop camping and tunnelling off hook? Surely it can’t be too hard to down someone who’s stuck in a unhook animation right?
---
if you want the que times to be even more outrageous.
---
You mean, almost as petty as tbagging and clicking the killer?
---
Yes, you can only pull survivors out of lockers if they are not asleep. Otherwise, you need to put them to sleep.
---
The only reason they would ever release anything is to make them money. They can say that their player base is growing every year but honestly it doesn’t look like it is. They crap out shitty patches to “fix the game” and create DLC for extra money. The game has become more entertaining to watch than to play. But if you have more people watching then who is playing??
---
A self fulfilling prophecy.
---
i love being babysat by spirits lmaoo
---
It looks pretty balanced to me
---
Happend to me as well, even after he hit me i still couldn't move.
---
Careful tbagging and using a flashlight isnt bannable but working with another survivor is 
---
Ohh I know what you mean now.. when looking through walls the aura is red but when they are in line of sight they glow whiteish
---
Alright, thank you!
---
The exploit where you can quickly switch between different characters while upgrading their bloodwebs in order to prestige characters that are not level 50 at no cost. You can also obtain items indefinitely or upgrade perks to tier 3 using the same exploit.
---
He is fun
---
Just run Small Game
---
I really hope the SWF groups that teabag me at the gate after a round where I played a killer just for the daily feel stupid when they see afterwards that I had zero perks equipped.
---
&gt; You idiotic piece of shit. how do you dress yourself?
---
You are being absolutely disgusting.
---
I had a killer message me calling me an asshole in broken English cos I DC’d when he slugged me and the other guy got the hatch. The hatch survivor was on the other side of the map (not near the hatch) and was making no effort at all to come save me. I don’t care about rank or bp I just wanna play the game not wait out a clock lol. Them bloody toxic survivors at it again I guess
---
if you only wanted to be paired with rank 13s, like yourself.  Queue times will be incredibly long, talking 30+ minutes and besides, you wrecked that team.  Whats the complaint here again?
---
Removed - Repost
---
Holy shit man didn't expect such a detailed critique and it means alot dude, I'll definitely take this into consideration, thank u so much it goes a long way
---
A while ago, than god lol
---
I can link you to a video 
---
ah ok ty
---
It’s nothing compared to the effort you put into this video man, you deserve an honest opinion 
---
Easy. Perks that reduce stuns/vault/pallet breaking are a must. Addons that reduce charge time. In the first few minutes I’ve usually broken most of the pallets and they now have nowhere to run.
---
Goal is to make the chases as short as possible and down them in one hit with the chainsaw. Break every pallet is a must since they’ll have nothing to use late game. 
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
What platform?
---
Nah
---
I legit feel bad for that dude. He seems so upset.
---
Douche was the wrong word but humans naturally have the want to mess with other animals/people in ways that can harm others mentally, physically and psychologically. I’m not sure what the scientific term for it is so I just said to act like a douche because it made sense. 
---
I’ve always had a soft spot for Adam mains 
---
Sloppy does wonders for this playstyle! I’d also add that Thanatophobia is very powerful. Like you said, this build discourages healing. Either survivors suffer the -15% action speed or waste a tremendous amount of time healing repeatedly. You don’t even need Hex: Ruin with this much power to delay the game.
---
What?
---
/r/dbdCompetitiveNoNoobsNoBabyKillerzSeriousOnlyPlz
---
Not that it bothers me but the option to rebind it would certainly be nice.
---
move bacon mother up to S and get trapper to F 
---
Pretty sure there's a way to view this Reddit without the memes. In the info page there was several links for other DbD reddits and I'm pretty sure that option was under there. 
---
So you can do the moonwalk exploit 
---
Damn, that looks good!
---
No, I'm actually not, I've rarely died on console and 98% of matches I kill every survivor, if you go from 300 hours on pc to console, it's much easier, my friend played with me and he had 0 hours said that Freddy was op which he is the opposite of op, he's just annoying 
---
At higher ranks people wouldn't even miss with huntress' lullaby unless you're the doctor on a small map.
---
I got the death screen after switching to a survivor every time.
---
dude they patched that out back in 2016 :P
---
Then why was there a video about it in 2017?
---
This one specifically - https://youtu.be/w1W61coCges
---
Oml
---
seconded, this is where the true quality discussion on this game happens
---
Need to rank the three others that are Legion too. 
---
It's important. 
---
Lol at all the bad killers downvoting bc they can’t comprehend playing without ruin
---
Maybe they put the descriptions backwards. I don't know maybe I'm just missing something.
---
This is a post that represents madness perfectly.
---
Wait, now that I think about it, that's exactly what happens every time!! It happens way more frequently when I play survivor. 10 mins ago I task manager'd the game, re-opened it, tried to join a survivor lobby and got stuck in an infinite loading screen, where I proceeded to make this meme... hmmm...
---
that isn't that ba
---
Ill try to test it later
---
the movie would be over in 5 seconds
---
It used to be 10,15,20. Idk either, ill try to test if thats the actual values ingame
---
I would like the option to turn it off. It's kind of a cool addition I suppose but there have been a few matches I joined in thinking my character would spawn as what it was but I laid my controller down to go get some water or something and I come back and spawn in as a totally unexpected character. Could spice things up a bit though. Turn it into a game. Character roulette wheel. Randomize survivors. 
---
I didn't kill him tho
---
Thanks for letting us know
---
To be quite honest I’d say getting to rank one is pretty easy seeing as you’ll get there just by playing the game. The only issue is the toxicity and necessity to stick to the meta once you get there that makes it unfun. Needing to play a top tier killer or risking getting destroyed is no fun for anyone.
---
Thank you fam.  U W U
---
That is perfect, but it appears to not work, I'll keep trying I guess. Thanks.
---
Report her then. 
---
Lol I actually open both whenever I decide to play because I know for fact ima need it at least once that session 
---
You should be punished for ragequitting like a bitch. 
---
I honestly don't like the hag very much, her animations are gross, not to mention she's bad
---
Yeah,
---
The meta is single-handedly ruining the fun of the game.
---
&amp;
---
The community is single-handedly ruining my tolerance for this great game.
---
Wouldn't doing Legion be weird? One second you're inside of them and the next they're inside of you. How do they work??
---
Idk Joey seems pretty smashable.
---
What was the killers name and level?
---
You’re welcome :) I’m glad you came across my salt/rant that was specifically tagged as a salt/rant
---
Yeah I noticed that last week and thought about posting it, but I was too lazy so instead I submitted a bug report.
---
Bit of a long one, but worth the ride :) Forgive my random raucous laughter, my friends were popping off on mic (mostly inaudible) as they were watching.
---
TLDW: killer chases me for an entire match
---
I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone before you say huntress is better at basement than LF. LF has a chainsaw he swings wildly and if he hits something he continues to swing. He can shut down even full team coordinated basement saves, huntress can’t. 
---
I mean. He technically isn’t wrong. 
---
WTF
---
Apparently there’s never a wrong time to complain about anything. 
---
You were saying huntress was better at defending a hook tho? I was informing you as a huntress main no she is in fact not better at securing a kill with someone in the basement 
---
For the millionth time it’s a text bug the changes never went through 
---
That's pretty Amanda 
---
Only happens to me with the survivors
---
In Rank 20, Killer runs from Survivors.
---
I don't know. I'm used to long waits. I always watch YouTube tv on my iPad while I wait but I've fallen asleep doing that a time or two. Just completely giving up on DBD for the night without playing one game was a first for me though.
---
i like montos builds 
---
Pig's ability is basically a short speed boost (please don't kill me pig defence squad) so I think it does
---
I agree with not using franks but not the reason
---
How is it toxic? I understand it’s annoying when your team doesn’t give the killer a chance to leave before they unhook you but that’s not the killers fault and you are the easier kill so it kind of is what it is. Practice your chase game which could help so you won’t be in that situation as often.
---
Most killers have probably been nice at some point but usually it comes back and bites them in the ass and they get bagged and taunted at the exit gates by the person they tried to help out so it becomes a fuck all of them kind of thing because you don’t know 
---
Leather is actually really fun to play when you dont camp
---
I think the doctor has the time stone, because whenever I get zapped I teleport back to where I was 3 seconds prior
---
I’d say it’s sort of the appeal. If I wanted a timid quiet guy I’d go after Dwight or Jake with iron will.
---
Right? I rarely see a Nurse until one day, I get 5. The cosmetics were also similar on some of them (Halloween head) and the perks were the same as another. Same person, I believe.
---
Thanks for the little tip, but no one shows any mercy anymore.
---
Stopped playing after jigsaw came out. Came back to killer streamers bitching about how adrenaline is now a clutch perk. Perk is the same since myers patch. Yikes.
---
simon cowl is a idiot! he doesnt know what *real* tallent is. if i went on britains got tallent i would show my tallent that is coming up with great ideas for games. but he would not let me in because i don't "sing" or "dance" like he wants "me" to
---
What you mean? 
---
It's kind of funny because the same thing happened the last time he got banned but he'll probably just spoof his HWID and go back to playing on PC again
---
What is the prestige/item exploit?
---
I like it when they disconnect mid-animation. Gives me extra points lol
---
Definitely Monto, lbr. If you haven’t seen him before, I’d definitely recommend checking out his Perk Build videos. He likes to mess around with a lot of different combinations that aren’t just your typical ~meta~ perks, so if you’re looking to spice things up, it’s always fun to tru one of his builds.
---
i mean it would help if had some criticism for me.
---
You mean lag stone?
---
Leatherface is one of the best killers to level up first for a bunch of reasons. The most obvious is, of course, BBQ&amp;Chilli, but he's also a good beginner character. He's got some tricks up his sleeve which can be especially effective against inexperience survivors, but he still requires learning and utilizing the basic fundamentals of playing killer.
---
Shouldn't Freddy be on D tier though? 
---
is there smth wrong with ardetha or smth?
---
Oh, [yes there is] (https://youtu.be/WAXKsdEtJxk). :D
---
If it wasnt there would be a lot less douche bags
---
Nah I'm with you. First time it happened to me I was really confused, but I quickly caught the guy again so it didn't really even matter. It buys them some extra time, sure, but it's really no big deal. 
---
Congrats! Glad you finally spent the equivalent of 3 tacos. Seriously people just buy leatherface and quit whining over the shrine. There's much more pressing issues to whine about.
---
Remember me is easily the best killer obsession perk in the game, and is criminally underrated. That's the only obsession perk I mentioned. 
---
I'm trying to get better. Anyways, both sides hate each other and killer mains think my point is stupid and survivor mains expect killers to let then escape if they're the last one. The whole community is a pool of toxicity because everyone's made-up rules get in the way. Hell, not asking to get tunnelled could be considered a made-up rule.
---
Getting better to avoid tunneling isn't the issue here. Having point-hungry teammates that don't care about anyone else but themselves is a problem. Tunneling ruins the experience for the player receiving it.
---
I think It's just like the hallowed blight event: you need to buy the skins with real money or those event coins. Not sure tho.
---
It's great actually. 
---
I can imagine how it is prigrammed and it seems to make sense to me. When you trigger a skillcheck, the game checks wether ruin is active. If it is, then the color changes. Then when you press space (or whatever button you press for skillchecks) instead of checking the color of the current skillcheck it asks the game wether ruin is active.
---
what have you brought upon this cursed land
---
jk tho that’s really cool
---
These aren’t supposed to be free actions. Play altruistically but risk being caught yourself. Like killers camp a survivor as the gates are open but risk letting everyone walk out. 
---
https://i.redd.it/j0lnsa2h4ey01.jpg
---
I both love and hate this. 
---
If it actually worked by making you get the last box the Pig could win some maps based on getting a trap on someones' head and ignoring them the rest of the game.
---
Take that back, Freddy is daddy pedo
---
In my defense, I have (probably) thousands of hours on console, with over half the characters prestige 3 and several with every perk in the game except the newest ones. I switched to PC and if there's a way to recover even a fragment of my progress, you bet your ass I'm skipping all that grind. I just want to be able to use any perk on my main survivors and killers without wasting my life getting that progress back. If I could have had my data transferred, fine, but since that's not an option, I have no shame it returning my progress myself.
---
lol yeah it'd cost so much money
---
Oh yeah helluva journey. I remember back when the nurse was new and the Billy flick was a skill, not a bug. After climbing to rank 1 over and over and seeing P3-50 more than once. I learned one thing. Freddy is still bad.
---
Take a step back or stop when you get to that range where 360 and then swing you don’t have to do a lunge just a regular swing in the direction that they turn in to do the 360. I’m still learning how to deal with it but that seems to help me, I usually fall for the first one because not everyone does it so it catches me off guard but I just remember who did it and expect it next time 
---
Two relationships and a delayed graduation 😔
---
ok but like my eARS
---
Thanks so much! And yeah, that makes sense. I'll have to give that a shot. Tbh when I play as survivor, my attempts to 360 the killer almost always fail, so I guess I need to practice that as well 😂
---
Sounds like a good plan, I'll have to try that out. Thank you!
---
I usually use multiple totems as well to force them off gens to run around and look for them. I’ve had several times where I’ve gotten five stacks on huntress lullaby due to this. Or they’ll get that and never find ruin
---
It happens to me every so often. Usually it will eventually take me back to character select and I've lost an add-ons or offerings I was going to bring into the game. To my knowledge there's no known fix for it.
---
As long as the slash/tally mark animation is showing; you're good to go.   
---
But if you don't see the slash animation; your game is frozen. If your game is stuck at 5% and the animation is still showing, it's not your game that's frozen; it's someone else. 
---
You dare insult my credentials? Off with his blood points! 
---
Frustrated and don’t wanna watch 
---
Getting tunneled sucks but it isnt toxic. I cant blame the killer when that happens. I blame my farming teammate.
---
I swear by Ataxic Respiration and Fragile Wheeze.
---
You don't get infinite loading screens during actual game loading screens though
---
This is also true 
---
thanks for the reply, its nice to know I am not the only person having the issue. I used to never have the issue before.. must be the coding with the new patches
---
Removed - Shaming
---
I only get the infinite loading screen if I alt tab before or after a loading screen.
---
yep this sub is full of survivor main :) but whatever
---
ruin shouldn't be a perk, ruin should just be the thing that's active the entire time until someone is hooked or 2.5 minutes have passed.
---
It's just that survivors spawn next to generators, so really if you can keep a chase going for less than 2 minutes, 3 generators should be done. Not fun. 
---
loud noises and pure autism
---
They*
---
Still wrong. Clown is S tier
---
Probably a hacker, lots of people hacked legacy in. 
---
Thats weird, I can't go 15 seconds without alt-tabbing if I'm not in game.
---
Also, I find that if I'm inactive (tabbed out or AFK) in a killer/survivor pre-lobby screen then there's a huge chance that it will trigger an infinite.
---
Here to read about a issue with someone in the community and still get to see something about DS being broken LOL never change dbd never change 
---
Removed. If you want to discuss a moderator action, write a message to r/deadbydaylight. 
---
It just takes practice. I used to lose every player that would 360 me, but now I usually am able to at least continue the chase if i don't hit them then. Sometimes I just take a step backwards and find them again, if they keep going around me sometimes I just swing and move the camera around and that has led to a hit on occasion. It used to confuse the hell out of me when they'd just crouch right in front of you, but now i know to just swing if I try to move and something is blocking my movement.
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
On PS4, the hatchets need to be perfect. Even if they are half a centimeter away, you can't hit them. Combined with the fact that aiming is not the easiest thing with a controller, it's a pain in the ass. 
---
Giving a solid head shake after a knock down and hook always does the trick. Then smack the last one on hook until their body disappears 
---
Didn't watch yet, but I don't get why you or anyone would get hate for promoting themselves. How else would you get yourself out there? I don't understand the mentality of people who hate on others trying to make something of themselves. Idk if that's your intention or not but I'm gonna check it out and leave some feedback for you. That's what more people should do, look out for each other. 
---
Everytime you load into that map it fucking happens. It's getting pretty annoying.
---
Removed - Shaming. Do NOT encourage harassment
---
Because they don’t wanna face legion 
---
whut?
---
Yeah I've heard it lol, I usually dodge that map anyway since huntress main life
---
Yeah, if youre getting unhooked 10 seconds after being hooked, thats not tunneling, thats asshole teammates.  
---
Feel free to make a new thread with the titles "I got asshole teammates 10 times in a row".
---
I didnt mean anything by it. I was asking to get a sense of where you were at, not to be rude. It was a legitimate question. I apologize, I couldve worded it better.
---
If  you are a just a beginner, then this shows promise. You can actually draw a proper head with hair, which is more than most people can do (including me). I like how you drew the shirt as well, it looks near perfect for the style you're going for. 
---
The problems I have with it mostly stem with the arm anatomy, which honestly, could use some work. I'm learning anatomy as well, so I see the same issue in my drawings. The legs irk me for a similar reason, but I can kind of see what you were going for with how you illustrated them. 
---
I definitely want to see more from you as you progress (if you want to, that is).
---
Yeah I'm at that point where I'll just like spin around, take a swing, and hope it hits them. Thanks for the tip! :)
---
I remember saying that he wasn't that bad and got downvoted to oblivion
---
Made me laugh I'll give you that, sometimes the clips felt a little long which made me lose a slight bit of interest near the start, some of the memes were well implemented and caught me off guard, it's pretty clear you got a skill for editing and I always enjoy these kind of videos, I liked that you kept it short, I'll subscribe and I look forward to more videos from you 
---
You've got to work on the flick! I've started flicking my analog stick (or mouse, idk what you play on) when they 360, in the direction I think they're going to go, and give them a smack. Usually works.
---
This comment is legit adorable
---
whenever the game freezes or an infinite loading screen happens, i just play Fortunate Son until i either wait out the loading screen or shut down the game
---
Good on u for not t bagging at the exit in the end lol I woulda abused it I can’t lie
---
I really understand what you mean as I also play a lot of Huntress.
---
Legion is awesome 
---
Feng and Spirit not X tier :unlucky:
---
She's literally wearing a rotten pig head. Disgusting.
---
Finally met my first basement chest leather face on console last week. Thankful I ran dark sense that day lol  
---
Thats the point of add ons
---
Ahh nea is a tier i will leave you be then :)
---
Fuck telegraph them old bastards
---
Got to love a girl willing to get dirty ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
That’s what I wanna know
---
Yeah lol, if it makes sense I play for the highlight reel, if a map is pretty much anti huntress I have a really REALLY strong urge to dodge but usually dont, but the games end up how I expect them to, 0-2 kills and not fun
---
QQ. She still is hot. Also Spirit and Huntress should be higher. You dare not have Mama-San at least A rank!? 
---
Yea, that was my own issue with it. From the edits themselves to the way I speak is pretty similar, sadly, thats just how I speak, but maybe I can try to figure something different out, but that's the hard part.
---
I appreciate the feedback :)
---
Go for Claudette then. She loves becoming one with the earth
---
Not if the legion is running cooldown build and just goes for the M1
---
That's exactly what I thought and was trying to cut it down so that people would understand the narrative, so I'll definitely keep that in mind and lmao ur my first sub, totally means a lot I thank u very much my dude
---
np
---
Nah she's not crazy enough. I need a special type of sadistic
---
Yes, about 1 out of every 7-8 games, I'll get stuck on the loading screen. It's been this way since Legion was released on the live servers.
---
It doesnt
---
Rancor is noed's red-headed stepchild, and is often useless. If gens are done and you don't already know where your obsession is, rancor was just a bad bitter murmur. 
---
Good luck :D I mean its still enjoyable, but might make you look like a "Budget No0b" in some ways  :)
---
Huntress's pussy deep as the ocean. Also, nothing worse than getting stabbed by seventy five glass shards while you're balls deep in a girl :/
---
No matter how often I get fucked by it, I can't *not* cleanse a flaming totem. I don't understand it but I'm just not capable of passing by.
---
tier 1 was in august 2016, tier 2 and 3 were both in late december 2016
---
She's underrated. I love her.
---
May I direct you to my man Evan MacMillan
---
I want a petition to give Michael Myers a greekgodx skin
---
Sounds like the killer was trying to be efficient and 4K, sucks for you but I can't really blame them. When I play survivor I also try and rush my only objective.
---
There's a difference between the bar loading screens and the ones that don't have a bar
---
^responce
---
Oh my God I had aneurysm 
---
How to play Legion when you run out of franks mix tapes.
---
Perk Build: Bloodhound, Sloppy Butcher, any other two perks
---
Step 1: find someone.
---
Step2: hit them with frenzy twice. 
---
Step3: stand still for 2 seconds until chase is broken
---
Step 4: tilt your camera towards the ground and follow the blood.
---
Congratulations you can now down someone without any skill.
---
Awww poor have :( she also wants to be loved 
---
Shes bad? She is amazing. She is at least an A on the tier list imo. She is super strong you just need to know how to use her. She can destroy a loop immediately with her trap. But if you dont like her you dont like her. I just said that because you get ace as a survivor and hes amazing(even though you dont really care about the survivors). Shes really short so the POV is weirder. Her animations are weird. I hate when she gets stunned because of it. 
---
I was memeing from the start
---
bro I had a stroke reading this
---
She is adorable, but I'm not gonna smash someone who has a muddy vagina.
---
Don't know if there's something necessarily wrong with him but I wouldn't trust such big claims coming from him. I know Ardetha hates Ochido more than most and I tuned into one of his streams once, maybe I just caught a bad one but the guy was just shit talking the whole time. There's also conveniently no real proof. I don't know either of them very well though, so I wouldn't know exactly. 
---
And Tyler would be an excellent Freddy skin as they both are 5'6.
---
It looks like hag is pointing at her
---
Glad you at least enjoyed it :)
---
This was kind of a test to see IF i could even edit, and i found out, I suck, but at least I have the capacity to learn. Now I'll have to find out my little niche and break out of that budget category :P
---
This game is about the chase. Comparing a killer who breaks the chase mechanics to a strong survivor perk doesnt make any sense. Really shows your ignorance.
---

---
No other reddit communities for this game besides the porn sub, I'd recommend just filtering out memes and shitposts. 
---
i always see post like this but i never encounter the same survivor group back to back
---
Adam and Feng are both too low on the list
---
OK. I laughed. Have an upvote.
---
I concede that, I was thinking the only thing lfs kit has over huntress in basement games is if the whole team goes for the save at the exact same time in a group, but honestly huntress will still down at least two of them if shes good then they're back where they started so what's the point? By the time I get those two downs I'm by 2 survivors with two slugged which means they're risking getting 4 manned all because of a basement, which happened just last night while I played a string of games after commenting to make sure huntress is as good at basement as I'm feeling she is (of the 5 games 2 resulted in basement hooks but only 1 really involved the survivor team trying to rescue in an organized way instead of gen rushing) 
---
Against a good swf (which is every 2 games at higher ranks it feels like) they're not going to stand near each other during chainsaw and I've had times as lf where im juked because you go for one then other makes stairs then by the time you get there they have windows and pallets or other loops. 
---
If you stand at stairs with huntress and backup as they come you can get two survivors pretty easily because they have to run into you, and on top of that you can get the ones trying to lure you out, you can deal with them if they get there late so you can bait them in easier by putting some distance but keeping Los of stairs, you can get them if they go for windows or pallets (which there usually are) and if you get bum rushed by every survivor on their team I think that's a good thing because no ones doing gens and I'm just going to have more people on hooks by the end of it. 
---
That's why I think her basement game is stronger. She can down the injured and down the savior just like lf if he gets saw off right after rescue but on top of that's shes better at all the things that surround getting a basement hook. She can down survivors just outside of the tile trying to bait a chase and still be there to stop them on the stairs, the pallets and windows on the basement tile actually work towards her advantage and she doesn't have to sit close to the hook passively or be right on top of them going for the save as long as near the basement when the save happens and the huntress is good they're not getting away from the tile. She can do everything that lf can do but she doesn't have to be as close so less time for the survivor to escape and she more powerful on the surrounding tile itself.

My mans Dwight is below a man that wears other people’s skin i..
---
Fucking weebs.
---
A few points, if you're not enjoying the game, don't keep playing. That's where I'm at with this, not worth torturing yourself further.
---
Second thing, you don't have to win games to perform well.  Quite often, you can find yourself getting 20k blood points on a loss and it not being a waste of time.
---
Last point, consider trying survivor to learn their techniques and how other killers play. That should give you a better understanding of the game in whole.
---
Can't I have both
---
Clown because *thicc*
---
Oink
---
I play SWF and Freddy fucks us up regularly.  Can someone explain why the community considers him a trash killer? Cause we can’t figure it out. 
---
To me Dwight resembles the singer of my favorite band so I’m biased I guess..😂
---
I think I'm just too seduced by the brutality of the movies. When I look at say Wraith's mori, I totally expect him to behead his victim.
---
Legion sucks. Annoying to play against. No counterplay. Prove thyself, leader, surveillance got buffed. Legion dlc came out with some really good perks on both sides. Aftercare and distortion for survivors and discorance and iron maiden for killers. Freddys buff is being worked on. A lot of new bugs have appeared. Like never leaving the basement. Dedicated servers are being launched this summer. Lunar event starts Wednesday giving ace feng and huntress amazing new cosmetics. They decreased the punt of time it takes to hook a survivor. Was like 2.5 seconds or something like that and now is 1 second. Lockers have been buffed. They hide all aura perks. So bbq cant show you a survivor in a locker. I think that is most of the major changes
---
I can never be mad at basement bubbas
---
That's the point, breh. 
---
You make a great point
---
Finally my girl Meg gets the respect she deserves.
---
You could hide devour hope inside your stinky asshole and I'm still going to get in there and cleanse it.
---
She has nipples though?
---
Don't forget to place purple items in the trader shop.
---
its probably bannable. but the devs wont go out of their way too catch you for it
---
You have a much *MUCH* higher chance of finding the obsession during the match than you do after the gens are powered. Just because a perk comes with the obsession tag doesn't mean it's bad lol
---
If they did that, all the survivors would just hide behind trees and in lockers until the time was up. Sounds like a super annoying/boring start to every match.
---
The real solution would be to increase totem count by 5, for a maximum of 10, and allow hexes to respawn on a dull totem after like 120 seconds. Then add a perk that dropped hex respawn time by 40/50/60 seconds.
---
Oh good, so it's not just me
---
So how long would people be in que for? How many killers are actually playing when teams are on already?
---
Git gud how bout that
---
Then SWF queue time would significantly increase, making those players complain or stop playing entirely. This isn’t a fair solution.
---
And?
---
YES, HER EYES ARE ACTUALLY BEAUTIFUL :((
---
I enjoy hunting it down. It is satisfying to cleanse a lit totem.
---
&gt; i love pigs mori animation. its quick, too the point and super BRUTAL
---
Sir, have you ever seen Leatherface or the Hag's mori? Because I somehow, just call it a hunch, I don't think you have. Either that or have entirely different ideas of what "brutal" means. 
---
You seem like the kind of guy that would describe a mild papercut as "brutal" meanwhile, I'd call a car accident involving a bus load of choir boys and no survivors "brutal."

I don't know about this, Tommy
---
Cool, I'll use my Ebony Mori's then. 
---
I will say that survivors dont tend to hunt lullaby down as harshly as ruin. If ruin is active, many survivors drop everything to go find it. Few do the same for lullaby.
---
I feel like an idiot for not understanding what's happening here
---
whenever i have a survivor daily i remember exactly why i stopped playing solo survivor lol
---
The totem system is fine with me really. Sounds like this will only make it harder, the games already heavily in killers favor 
---
excuse me what the fuck
---
PUBG done.
---
you gotta make the question harder man
---
Sadly these salty fuckers exist and yes it is reportable. Killers are people 2 lol
---
Is SWF really the problem or is it just people being good at the game? I play with my friends all the time and we always die 😂
---
Iz joke pls don't attack
---
Good example of a mediocre-bad killer player who plays Legion because it turns it into a singleplayer game for them. 
---
Yup, blowing up my messages sending me screenshots of the game, fucking sad. Sorry I was nice and let them go after you got downed with 5 gens guys
---
Ok I'll bring decisive strike, adrenaline and Insta heal
---
Wrong, you don’t smash myers, myers smashes you 
---
It is if you don't farm with everyone. What you did is reportable. Either you farm with everyone, no one or leave the people who don't want to farm alone and farm with the ones that do.
---
Everybody has to be on board for farming, you can't kill one or 2 people and then farm with the rest. It looked like you were working with the survivors left alive to the survivors you kill. Once you killed 2 people you should of just ignored the message and went about your normal killer message.
---
ez.
---
It's a reference to this meme:
---
https://youtu.be/I2gvFRyPh7c
---
It's hard to see it the first time, but there is a Dwight getting grabbed by the entity in the back :)
---
I don't think so; you're not being toxic or exploiting any glitches, bugs or mechanics to gain an advantage. They can say farming ruins the fun of the game, but people think slugging, camping, and tunneling ruins the fun too and those aren't bannable.
---
You check twice the same thing that is wasting computing time even though its not much, if you take only that into consideration, it is poor programming, it also probably (not necessarily) makes a mess in the code.
---
I get that. I just can’t seem to do it. The thought of me ruining his experience or day is something I just can’t do.
---
Exactly. 
---
Me waking up with sleep paralysis. 
---
Yeah I’ve had SWF games where the killer was just real good, no Mori but EASILY 4k’d us. I’ve also had games not SWF where I’ve ran the killer, got gens and totems and we’ve all escaped. I’m not taking a shot at anyone who plays killer but if you’re good then SWF isn’t that big of a deal and you should use SWF as a way to get better anyways.
---
Not sure you're playing the same game as everyone's else. The totem system is completely broken they just have no idea how to solve it (and this suggestion aint it). Also the game has been survivor sided for a VERY long time.
---
I'm not too sure about that,  good strides have been made but by no means is the game heavily in the killers favor.
---
Then I'm camping your ass with Billy. 
---
thank you for the info now all need is the values 
---
i wreck swfs group all the time, if one dies, it seems to kill the entire teams spirit.  These supposed god tier 4 man elite swf teams are extremely far and few between.  I have yet to run into one yet and I play on the regular
---
The game will probably die if theres an option to turn off SWF 
---
Sounds like a good idea or just a button that randomizes your 4 perks I feel like that would be cool. 
---
Or even maybe challenges based on perks, like hit your DS or unhook your self with deliverance.
---
you forgot BT too hehe
---
Ok I'll just use deliverance and dead hard my way out of the exit gates
---
Freddy and “Entity Displeased” 
---
it got fixed this patch
---
Oh yeah that's right
---
Says you. Live a little. 
---
Also don't use autistic as an insult. Not cool my dude. I was joking anyway and I thought you were playing alone and now i am mot so sure.
---
How are you going to use Deliverance when I'm two steps away from the hook and there's no pallets or windows nearby? 
---
Checkmate, fuccboi. 
---
Nah mate, in this case it makes perfect sense and is the best way to not create spagetti code. The skillcheck could ask itself wich color it is and then appy the effect, but it's kind of a general rule to not make checks with sprites or colors. Another option would be to create a normal skill check and a hex skill check object, but thats just extra code for something that you could reduce. Asking abother object something takes as much time as asking yourself something.
---
Challenges based on perks would be a huge mistake, it would make new players life way harder (which is the one the daily quests are aimed at).
---
You know, I wish I did what you did. Instead I read it, knew what it said, and still clicked it anyways. Regret was found in mere seconds.
---

---
I’m sorry if I’m an idiot missing something here, but I’ve been seeing this a lot. People are saying “shure” rather than “sure”. Are people just being funny or did they genuinely try to spell sure shure?
---
I completely disagree... how is it in the survivors favor, dude I’ll play killer and destroy most of the time. I’m rank 9 survivor main and it’s most definitely killer sided.. 
---
You got something against Kate mains?
---
Freddy is a meme about being the worst killer, but he’s still a shit ton of fun. I may be biased because he’s my main, but when I’m not being bullied by survivors I’m having a ton of fun. Besides, 2 of his perks aren’t too bad. If you want to buy Freddy, go ahead, but be prepared to be bullied at high ranks. 
---
Well if they move around a Corner they lose vision so you could go all the way back with Harvest and cancel it in time so the survivor runs right into you.
---
What, to start a witch hunt?
---
Yeah but there’s always gonna be a meta so why drop to where people aren’t playing the meta? The only issue with that question is some people drop and still go meta to win and some people drop so they can mess around and have fun with the game. The first group of people is, like you said, ruining the game.
---
Bubba nerds a thong for his thiccnes😤😤😤😤

Sorry -,-
---
I've had the same rank for 2 seasons now, I haven't played a single game. All I do is KYF so I guess I'll always be the same rank
---
Just like the other guy said, it felt almost too similar to noob3. Not that it's a bad thing, I chuckled at some parts (the smash bros sound clips, and zelda chest searching are gold, keep those). Not bad editing tbh, you could tell you were a bit nervous tho but hey we all start somewhere. Other than that, yeah like you said I guess you just gotta find something that is unique to you but you're definitely taking a step in the right direction if that's your first video. I subscribed and definitely looking to seeing more content. 
---

---
Alright it’s cool, I just thought I was missing a meme 
---
good for you
---
time to move on to another game
---
this one is garbage
---
if they ban you they are doing you a favour
---
I'm not arguing code here dude... its just obvious which one is correct. It has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with color.
---
Then you're ignoring the fact that it is 100% necessary against good players. Unless you play Nurse, good survivors will do gens way too fast. I don't like it either, but that is the state of the game. Ruin is, unfortunately, a necessary evil. 
---
Leatherface isn't nearly as bad as people say. He isn't top tier by any stretch of the imagination, but I think he's better than the Trapper, Wraith or Freddy. Low mid/high low. Somewhere around where the Pig is. 
---
I would drop a nice donation but atm im tight with the money : (
---
I don’t know why people are still waiting for BBQ in the shrine. Leatherface DLC is cheap, and he comes with 3 good perks. Franklins is huge against a team that brings items or finds them, and knock out is great when you need to slug.
---
Ahhhhhh! Thats hot! Thats hot!
---
For me it seems to be related to when I alt tab out a whole ton. If I'm alt tabbed out for a long time and then switch to survivor and try to play them, this happens. Otherwise it's fine.
---
Not played her much, but she's fun and intuitive to play, and oh my god that squeak is so cuuuuuuuute! &lt;3
---
Oink!
---
what?
---
Get to the gens first... dribble survivor. Not even kidding the amount of people who believe it’s in survivors favor is very small. Just practice as a killer, find your main. You’ll see what I’m saying. If not then oh well lol
---
What don't you understand?

You...you didn’t buy four nodes before buying the teachable...?

Ochido is not fun to watch, it's the exact same shit every video.

which is the exact same reason why demi isn't fun to watch so if you like his content and be mean to ochido for the same reason ur a hypocrite i am not a fan of either of them just pointing this out
---
That only works if you’re in an open area with no loops to go to. 2 cooldowns make the stun time about 2 seconds, which is about the same time as respecting a pallet which allows the person to get another loop in especially with your 110% movement speed. 
---
oh god oh f- oh god oh f- oh god oh f- oh god oh f-
---
any of what you said, how is legion a farming killer, and what are all the ways you can be toxic with him that devs didnt account for
---
Look, I’m not defending OchiDO. I think he’s an asshole, a scumbag, and a general piece of shit, but these pedophile allegations have no real evidence. These are serious allegations that need to be looked at unbiasedly and no favoritism. The girl could very much be faking it and we’d all be accusing him of shit he didn’t do. Until we get some solid proof like screenshots or voice messages of his doing this shit, I’m gonna be cautious about this. Still a piece of shit. 
---
"it also probably (not necessarily) makes a mess in the code." Those were your exact words. The color was just me explaining the code
---
Trapper has to predict Survivor movements AND predict their predictions of his actions to place traps in effective areas where they won't get disarmed. For the Survivors they have to be careful and stay on their toes, because if they step in a trap: game over.
---
Hag is similar, but while her traps have less "Game Over" power, she has more and can use them for mobility. As long as the Hag places her traps well and the Survivors make mistakes, her power can be insanely helpful. For Survivors she's easy to loop but can be hard to shake off, since her traps can help her keep up pressure. Usually meaning longer but more interesting chases.
---
Clown throws bottles. For the Clown it's mostly general routing and looping predictions that pay off very satisfyingly. For the Survivor they have to know how to react to the Clown's actions; when to run through gas and when to avoid it. Also he laughs and jiggles. How can you hate that?
---
Wraith goes **BING BONG**. That's, like, the best thing ever. 
---
That aside he's kinda spooky like Michael so you have to be careful, and since he can be very fast and usually has an anti-looping build Survivors have to stay on their toes.
---
Survivor main but I always feel really bad when I pallet hit a Pig because that squeak is literally adorable. 
---
ｏｉｎｋ ( ´ ▽ ` ) ！
---
Because he has already asserted dominance with the T-pose. At that point I must obey Daddy David. It's *inevitable.* 
---
Chibi lost his clapper
---
Can you help chibi find it?
---
Yeah it's ridiculous. These devs are fucking useless.
---
Every match I've played as or against them almost always ends.with 0-1 kills.
---
Thank you
---
Only baby killers who dont want a challenge and want easy wins vs solo queue survivors complain about swf just get good u salty scrub
---
I want this as stuffed animal!
---
I don't really care which rank you are. It doesn't change the game when people know the basics the game is pretty much on the Survivors and how big they mess up, the only exception may be nurse but even though she can obliterate chases on the hands of a good player she is just too slow, bad move speed, bad detection, she literally announces she is travelling the map. SWF is easy mode and if you're talking solo survivor then the survivor needs to be decent and have some game knowledge then he will be in control of the game once again.
---
Fuck u right tho
---
Okay now make a "Survivor and Killer Smashability Tier List" Smashability Tier List.
---
I love Amanda. Her stun noise, her power, her perks, I love it all. I play a lot of pig and she’s probably my 2nd favorite killer next to Freddy. She’s fun, she’s balanced, and she’s adorable &lt;3

I'm always tossing and turning between Mandy, Hag and Nurse, but in the end always return to Miss Piggy, she seems just so much more fun to play. Oink
---
Yeah so you level up faster this way, saving more bloodpoints.
---
No, because I'm pretty sure it was my irl friend. It's not the killers fault anyway. 
---
I made a discord for freddy mains! 
---
Oh I agree with all that and I agree with your original post that he's basically literally an M1 killer but with some gravy to make it better, which makes him good for learning how to do killer properly.
---
But my joke was to point out that one of the things you'll learn is that LF is for laughs and not going for 100% winrate. You'll find map+survivor+addon+perk combos where Leatherface just has to pray for multiple survivor errors and still play really cheesy to win. 
---
but i wasnt taking abt the ones without the bar

He'd be completely unable to attack with his frail soyboy arms, but he'd screech constantly, unless pacified with lewd doujins, that'd be a secondary objective on the map.

I will politely decline that offer but i'm flattered
---
Literally every game has hackers, they'll always find a way around
---
That's the best way for a farming match to go IMO
---
thoughts of the huntress making the pallet stun sounds are creeping into my mind
---
If you're trying to get through the bloodweb for teachables, getting a perk as soon as possible is the best way to do it. 
---
What do you have to do for them ?
---
That sounds cool. A perk (non teachable) that gives 1 random perk every game. It would be a good way to find perks you like in actual games instead of kill your friends. Plus, who doesnt like a little randomness that doesnt affect a huge part of the game.
---
A bite for the entity is 100 sacrifices and a feast for the entity is 500 sacrifices 
---
Every player knows it’s more worth getting decent add-ons/offerings over leveling faster. Because that method is worthless once you reach the lv50 cap or try to get 1m bloodpoints so you can prestige your character.
---
I honestly wish there was a no HUD, no perks, no items or addons mode!! (skillchecks still should show up though ;P).
---
I think it would be really interesting not to have all the extra stuff and to be able to play games kinda raw. Something I'd love to try anyway!!
---
Just keep doing what you're doing man. If you keep at it and steadily improve, everything will come together.
---
Ruin is not that powerful in higher ranks. on lower tho...
---
I also popped one fast Hag game while I had the time, got all 4 iridescents and perfect scores! I love that :D
---
"Since boldness is one of the easiest categories to max what this really ends up meaning is that dull totems are ignored and left with the hope that the killer isn't running noed, which exemplifies the problem of noed being a non skillful end game crutch to grab one kill (maybe more if the survivors get too greedy with altruism) through 1 tapping with bonus speed and then camping."
---
So because you don't see a reason to cleanse totems, that makes NOED a crutch perk? K.
---
That doesn’t mean you ignore them. 
---
Oof let me link it again
---
It isn't because even if they hit great skill checks it doesn't reward additional gen progress. It always slows the game down, however much, even against the best players. 
---
https://discord.gg/FGFfdc
---
They are easy to find, they spawn in "random" locations which almost all are terrible spots. They also are able to spawn in sight of the survivor (right at the start), making hex perks very unreliable. They also are inheritable unbalanced, they are OP if you can't cleanse and they are -1 perk if its cleansed (they're really snowball perks that in my opinion offers nothing but toxicity to the game).
---
I feel like it gets worse when we played a 4 though! 2 of us play as a duo quite a lot and we find games fairly consistently but as a 4... never 
---
I think it's funny, the less people understand something, the more they start using insults.
---
I don't know the game code, however, I am a programmer and know how I would program this. Checking twice is the most efficient way I can think of that is least likely to cause spagetti code. I'm not saying it is the most efficient way, but what you're saying isn't more efficient

And that's good to know!  So you can still earn points without winning?
---
Nice
---
It happens... try to stop searching and try it again... i had the same thing happened to me, it was bugged and needed whole game to restart. 
---
I don't know if this just happens to me, but a tip for anyone else who also experiences this issue. When my game freezes task manager doesn't close the game right away, so what you can do instead is to open up your steam overlay (shift+tab) and at the top right it has a "force quit" option at the top right which closes the game immediately.
---
OP is clearly just trying to get the teachable, so no, you’re better off getting the perk ASAP.
---
Even if they just kept the aura of anyone on a hook so people can be saved, otherwise I would awesome. Maybe increase bloodpoints as an incentive for everyone.. 
---
"Hate?"
---
This discussion always comes full circle
---
The circle is complete. 
---
Unless it was the last totem. In that case, the team did good 👌
---
If it ends up giving players blood points or free prestige’s it’ll be fixed tomorrow

Dull totems aren't here to give survivors an advantage, you're missing the point when you suggest that survivors should actually get buffs for cleansing them. They exist so that matches can be slowed down on average, without BHVR having to continually lower generator repair speed, which is seen as boring gameplay. The idea is that every killer benefits from NOED existing in this game, whether they're running the perk or not, while survivors aren't forced to run around the map searching for them if they'd rather rush the objective.
---
Are they a bitch or do they not want the game to be held hostage? The killer obviously doesn't care about how much enjoyment you have so why should I care about theirs?
---
I play both surv/killer and rarely slug since I'd rather move on to the next match then run around looking for some immersed survivor.
---
This may have been posted before, it seems like it should be general knowledge, but I am gonna say it anyway. 
---
To play against Legion, survivors have to split up and do generators in a manner that doesn't stack them at the end. I know, "It breaks up the teamwork style of gameplay." However, it also counters him very well and prevents a lot of the pressure he puts on the survivors. As far as fixing the issue of his "OP" purple add-ons or how the Mend status can be abused by the killer, I don't know how to fix that other than hoping the devs can fix the timer based on distance to killer rather than being in a chase or not. 
---
Also, isn't Doctor the farming killer?
---
I was playing pretty awful as huntress for daily rituals when i hit someone through a wall, and i decided to let them have the hatch as they were the last person.  After that we started playing some survivor games together completely coincidentally - and he sacrificed himself to let me escape, and then i never saw him again in game,  if you're out there, love you Ace
---
As it should be.
---
Sure.
---
Even against rank 1's you do have some options.
---
1. Run ruin.
---
2. Play Nurse.
---
3. Lose before you get a chance to play the game.
---
Imb4 someone uses this for a greentext
---
Lol dude, I can see you are either new, or never been high ranked. juggling is situational and often you are too far away. You can't just pressure gens if everyone is good at looping. The only way to pressure gens is to hook and kill.
---
Lol no, he’s still a poorly designed killer even if moonwalking didn’t exist. His power still has no counterplay. He WILL get those hits. The only reason he’s bad is because it takes awhile for legion to get those 4 hits not including frank’s mixtape, so basically the game becomes timerbased instead of skillbased. The killer also has no pressure against injured survivors, you just don’t heal because he can injure you with his power easily anyways so why bother? Don’t blame the players for finding ways to make things broken, if you have an idea for a game think of all the variables. Something as simple and fundamental to the killer as chase mechanics should’ve been extensively looked at, playtested and then changed (and people started moonwalking in the PTB, they just decided to release the killer anyways without doing anything).
---
Dwight + locker
---
Nea + flashlight
---
Pig + teabag
---
Myers + shirtless Mori
---
Me saying bye to the survivor who had we’ll make it :( 
---
*Matchmaking* can't get a lot better.
---
*Rank* can absolutely be split up more to differentiate the "pretty good" players from the truly great ones, even if they end up in the same matches regardless.
---
Yeah I think I pretty much agree on everything that's brought up there. 
---
No, they removed the gen part. Leader doesn't work on gens.
---
We were trying some glitches in KYF with the Hag's phantoms and my friend was able to fly for 2 minutes and fall right over the wall. Got some nice screenshots from this moment.
---
Eeeeep!
---
no, it’s really bad. even at 5 hooks they can push through it even if they can’t find the hex to purge it. the perk is only used in meme builds with doctor as otherwise ruin is way better. additionally it’s on a free character (huntress) 
---
You care enough to comment 
---
Maybe Nurse is just normie Spirit 
---
Have you tried “not camping”?
---
Which killer do you find least enjo- Everyone: “Legion” 
---
It still doesn't solve the problem that one of his perks basically give away the location of other survivors once he stabs one person. Or that you can't even use locker as again, one of his perks negate that. 
---
But you need to hide to counter his relentless play style and mend but there's none that counter those effectively. You can carry Distortion but that perk is wasted on non legion killers and if you don't buy the DLC then you're out of luck. 
---
Also with the amount of tunnelling/staking Legion does, I'm not sure 3 tokens are enough anyway. 
---
I am a billy/pig main, and I seriously dislike playing hag. She is slower than other killers, any totem perk you use is gone in 2 minutes, and people just crouch over traps so they don’t activate. Really annoying to play.
---
Least enjoyable is probably billy. Main is Trapper.
---
Be meg with urban evasion. 
---
On lerys
---
Urbanly immerse around corner 
---
See someone crouching around corner in red shirt
---
Wanna go say hi to other immersed survivor
---
Start tbaggin like I always do

It's a piggy

Get stabby stabbied

Probably thinks I was BM ing

Oink oink gonna die now!!!

I saw this video and loved the help I got: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UoymuGcBzY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UoymuGcBzY)  
---
I also enjoy watching HybridPanda, Puppers and Monto. They've helped me with my playing.
---
Imma add you what's your psn?
---
Your confusing addons with perks. Perks don’t matter anymore, they are randomly in a slot instead of the order you set them as, and I fucking hate it. Addon order still matters. 
---
No they wouldn't. Rank 1 is obnoxious. A lot of the people who are rank 1 don't even want to be rank 1. A lot who could be intentionally avoid it.
---
Toxicity from other games to beginners is why I really don't wanna get the game.
---
I main Doc, but also play a lot of Billy, Hag and Nurse.
---
I hate playing Leatherface and Legion.

---
You can block them from communicating with you, but unfortunately there is no way to block them from playing with you. 
---
She's fucking underrated.
---
Multiple stabs on one survivor is more like it. 
---
It is okay, but definitely not the best. Hex: Ruin beats it by a long shot. Though if you want to run an impossible doctor build with the perks it may be worth it. It is a fun perk, but in terms of usefulness, it doesn't hold much.
---
It might be 500 in play station but its 1000 on both xbox and pc
---
Legion's power does reveal survivors within their (?) terror radius whenever they hit a survivor not already affected by the ability as long as they do not have the Deep Wounds debuff on them, but if survivors are spread out then, so much time is wasted trying to chase down each one that they will rarely get the chance to hit more than one other survivor even with duration/move speed increase add-ons. 
---
I can't personally speak on the Iron Maiden perk itself because I honestly have not seen a killer that has it equipped, (I am on PC maybe console players see this more often. Idk) I know it isn't a perk that I would personally run as killer because of the current meta of the game, but I do concede that hiding in lockers against him does not work because Feral Frenzy will show where you are if you are in the terror radius as stated previously and that is a free grab every time.
---
Damn
---
Leave the game 
---
I used a splinter once and ended up killing two survivors with 1 gen left. The three gens and hatch were really close to each other so I thought the last two were looking for it if they had a key. Fast forward 20 minutes and I’m PS messaging them where tf they are and they said that I was a good killer and they didn’t want to play against me.
---
They were both hiding behind a rock in the corner of the map.

No one would complain about totem spawns if we all used haunted grounds

That's a Monto strategy, him and his team did the same thing.

Yeah, I feel like the pedophile allegations aren't true (wouldn't surprise me if they were). But him sexually harassing fans and other content creators is true. 
---
Like Wobedy has commented about it being true (and that dude stays in his own little bubble away from other content creators), Scottjund/DamnNoHTML talked about Jendenise getting blocked after she rejected Ochido, Noob3 talking about how he asked someone for nudes and Ochido blocking them after they refused, Ochido replying to a comment basically confirming that he's a creep.
---
It’s a good and bad idea. Bad because everyone will be stacked as fuck. Good because it eases the grind. 
---
Oh no. I do it any time I see the killer so sometimes it's not constant. I have trouble with people taking me off with killer around so maybe that;s it. :(
---
The analogy I always use is that you might consider me as the killer having three friends that could free roam spectate the map at 115 movement speed, just not interact with anything. Communication is an extremely viable asset, and giving me the ability to know your position and what you’re doing even though I’m on the other side of the map is tremendously powerful. Sure, it doesn’t affect how good I’m going to be in the chase, just like how swf doesn’t actually affect how long you can run me for in a chase, but swf allows a team of survivors to make better plays and maximize time efficiency in ways they would not be able to do regularly. 
---
I’ve ran into plenty swf teams that are bad and run loops poorly enough for me to snowball pretty fast just purely off of hooks, but the whole match is a race against time for me. Without that communication, my map pressure would be strong enough for me to have a chance against them at an equal skill level, but when you give survivors the ability to coordinate saves so that 2 people are still doing gens, you require me as the killer to be so much better than them that I am downing enough people in rapid succession to force everyone off a gen to go save or heal. 
---
I’ll agree that swf is a good way to get better, but only because you’re required to be better than them to win since you’re fighting an uphill battle the entire match. swf needs to be addressed by the devs, because solo players are getting the bunt of survivor nerfs and a vast pool of killers that are conditioned to swf teams and as such load up with more than the necessary skills to beat the opposition. 
---
Case in point, swf is definitely a big deal that makes the game wildly difficult to balance. To say it’s ruining the game is definitely a little over dramatic, but to say it’s no big deal or that it hasn’t had its fair share of unintended and poor consequences is pretty wrong.
---
Thank you Grammar Nazi, I guess it is my painkillers that finally hit in.. brains don't really work well.
---
Cant wait for it to be on the shrine tomorrow
---
Been like this since the legion came out! 
---
Ok give ds as survivor base kits so killers don’t have to guess if they need to juggle 
---
This sub is a killer circle jerk lmao
---
I think so... somewhere in the settings it says something along the lines of turning tutorial hints off. Never tried it though.
---
I wanted to say mine is better but I've read you don't like bottoms so I assume you're a bottom and I'm not so thus I'm unable to complain. So out of the bottom of my heart: have a nice day.
---
Thats the Toxic Sabo Squad, is a known gimmick team. I get much more annoyed by Instablind Claudette Death Squads. It's impossible to pick anybody up.
---
I've had this problem since the mid chapter patch after spirit release.
---
Do they appear offline? If not just view currently playing when in a lobby to know if it’s him or not 
---
I won’t straight up disagree because we’ll just end up going back and forth endlessly, but I swear to god the devs said it still applies 3/6/9 percent to repair and I swear to god I’ve still seen the yellow bar come up while I was working on a gen because of leader, so I dunno who’s wrong but I’ll check at a later point tonight for us I guess, cuz in all fairness I could be wrong as well.
---
He never cheated?

https://youtu.be/yB4NV8LICTA

Spirit and pig. Least favourite, probably billy or doctor
---
Thank god it’s way too grindy as it is now and the chances of crap perks ruining your bloodweb won’t be such a slap in the face now 
---
Lol too much work. I blocked him and I’ll just be wary of wraiths in the future. 
---
Upside is once they are in the dream world, nevermind the hatch - its fuckin hard to see anything.

so mUch SMokE

I used the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UoymuGcBzY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UoymuGcBzY)  
---
My watching this video (a little old, but very relevant) and watching HybridPanda, Puppers, and Monto, I've really upped my game.
---
Whenever i see this kind of stuff i usually hit them and let them struggle free. Not fair to the survivor.not satisfying to me as a killer to get a free hook.
---
It's 500 on both PS4 and Xbox, they have the same achievements. On Steam they are different.
---
Can all yall stop posting the same damn shit every day?
---
Is it me or does her hair kinda moves when scrolling down on my phone 
---
True. Just hide in a locker when haunted grounds is up tho. Problem solved 
---
What do you mean you don’t know how people are going to get all the perks after a few more chapters? It’s not as if it’s changed, it’ll only suck for brand new players as the majority of people who have had the game for a while would already have most of the perks for at least their main survivor/killer. I’m currently on the grind to prestige 3 every character and get every perk, it’s taking a while but it gives me another objective other than just repairing generators 
---
if he wanted a singleplayer game so badly he could have just bought something like fallout or witcher 3. 
---
Thicc
---
That wouldn't make any sense, but we're talking BHVR so I don't know. I'm just going by the perk description and the patch notes, I'll have to check it out myself.

Look it's fine as long as you don't get a handjob
---
Today I had a killer who facecamped me because I destroyed Hex: Ruin.  
---
He said destroying it would be "unfair". So keep in mind play fair and don't destroy the toys of killer kids   
---
I think that's only for people on the beta. I have it and I'm on the beta but my friend doesn't, who probably isn't.
---
Yep. People suck--especially people in the DBD community because they're mostly teenagers/young adults &amp; there's no real consequence for being shitty and no reward for being a good player/teammate/respectable opponent, so the toxicity runs rampant.
---
It's both a people problem and a BVHR problem.
---
You got my vote. Seems like aa
---
Sex with your mom: Deja Vu
---
But which killer says Fuck and which one says Gorsh darnit? :o
---
I main what my flair says (dont have bloody pig yet,only p1 lv45 at the time of typing this) pig and trapper being my most played as for least enjoyable to me would probably be wraith or nurse(nurse cuz i suck with her lol)
---
You got my vote. Seems like a good way to deal with Bbq and chili. 
---
Survivors get way less bp, I’ve escaped and gotten the same points as the killer who got like two hooks 0 kills
---
As a killer main at rank 1, I can definitely say that ruin is extremely powerful at all ranks. It may not be AS strong in higher ranks, but saying it isn’t strong at all in higher ranks isn’t accurate imo.
---
Same last night after my 4 man and i waited 30 mins i was super pissed bc i had to go to bed for work in the morning...thinking of telling them I dont wanna do 4 man until its better again..been this way since the event ended.
---
My favorite has definitely been the Doctor but I've played the Spirit, the Hag, and Leatherface enough to unlock all their perks.
---
Tier 1 is 25% tier 3 is 45% its a typo. 
---
The doctor being annoying enough with skill checks, would be really annoying with this. Make sure you have the other perks to be set with doctor, though I am not quite sure what they are. Haven't played doctor in a good while. Look up Monto's impossible doctor build, it is really entertaining, and teaches you a lot.
---
That doesn't make them more powerful, which is what I specifically said. 
---
BBQ, Nurses Calling, Bitter Murmur, Rancor....
---
I really enjoy playing Legion and Spirit. I'm also a decent Hag.  My least enjoyable is Billy &amp; Leatherface.
---
If your screen freezes. The progress bar stops for everyone but the tally marks will stop fading in and out if you're the frozen one. "the animation"
---
If your screen is dead frozen, it's you. If not, it's someone else.
---
The doctor as a passive ability to his shock therapy can make skilchecks move to the corners of your screen instead of in the middle, so if you don't hear a check via lullaby and it's not in the middle of your screen it makes them a lot harder to hit than they otherwise would be.
---
Just a single idea my dude. You get the picture though
---
So that half foot gap between the ground and the bottom of the water tower isn't considered "floating"? 
---
Hello!
---
Just to give you a bit of information on how the teams are dealing with different features.
---
The team that is implementing the ban feature on console is a backend team, the Console bans were planned to be released with the 2.5.0 release. The prestige exploit just happened to be at the same time.
---
The team that is banning players are part of the Community team, they are not programmers.
---
The team that is working on optimization on console is a live team including technical directors, programmers and even Designers.
---
Hope this helps a bit!
---
I must be a blind MF
---
Random Hag traps will do that too. 
---
Don’t worry, there are tons of garbage players you’ll fit right in while you learn!
---
No love for the Chainsaw bros :’(
---
Ok, this episode is actually over an hour long.
---
You have every achievement except these ? How lol 
---
I was just expanding on how many killer perks see auras verses how many survivor perks counter aura reading. 
---
We’ve only got two that come to mine. Distortion which has only 3 charges, and the Laurie Strode one that is practically useless. 
---
You need to coop gens in order to get a lot of points.
---
2,5 gens completed with another survivor gives you max points in objective. 
---
But that's not what BobTheBox said, they said Legion was a more hated killer, which is what I was reiterating.
---
I think we both agree, we're just splitting hairs at this point.
---
Every step you take, every move you make I'll be watchin yooooouuu
---
Oink oink?
---
No I've got every achievement but the feast for the entity one. 
---
Legion who?
---
hope they’re focused
---
Yeah but while it gets you more points soloing gens is a much smarter move to actually escape.
---
Update on your ban ?
---
You can really see it on by the boxes to the left of the screen near the beginning of the clip because there is a light source behind them that is reflecting on the ground below the boxes. 
---
I main Freddy and Hag and do great with them. They're great at mindgaming. Hag is just a better trapper and Freddy is a better pig (controversial).
---
I tried so hard to like legion but he's just bad. Noed, remember me, monitor&amp;abuse, and blood warden is the only build cancerous enough to make him useful. 
---
Distortion sadly only works on oneself too
---
How can you dislike huntress! She has the most beautiful lullaby
---
That’s crazy the 500 kills was like my tenth achievement 
---
I rarely played killer tho. I just maimed survivor 
---
15 minutes and going
---
I didnt think of snap for Trapper and now im upset at myself
---
Sometimes I leave it open for 30 minutes. Huehuehue.
---
Yeah, I'm not a fan.  I also like Wraith and Pig &amp; I use monitor/abuse on Legion, so I might just like ambushing.
---
Main Clown, Pig and Trapper follow not too far behind
---
Wraith, Legion I really dislike.
---
He is a pedo?
---
The best thing about her is the cute noise she makes when stunned.
---
Tell me about something working properly in this game right now. Even the basement now is bugged ...
---
Another salty killer main who doesn’t have any friends to play the game with 
---
Nothing new 
---
Think you got it backwards
---
how in the freshest of fucks is the clown, leatherface, and the hag smashable in any way shape or form
---
I don't like the unique terror radius
---
Yeah exactly. Purposely dcing to give the survivor the hatch is a bit of a wanker move but nah no chance am I lying there for 4 minutes just cos the killer wants a 4k that bad. I value my time way too much to be doing that. 
---
That’s why you wear the brown pants. 
---
Why?
---
big rip
---
oh that's hot, that's hot
---
Oooooo what if it was an offering?
---
They weren't videos, they were comments on Ardetha's video
---
I love hearing Clown laugh at survivors who think they are gonna live the trial &gt;:)
---
Even still those huntress ones are so hard that land 100 hatchets from 25meteres away, I lack the accuracy 
---
Abort her, Legion bad.
---
I feel like Self-Care gives too few points. Yes I know everyone runs it and I’m not saying you shouldn’t heal with others. But the fact that you have to self-heal like 10 times and escape to max survival blows my mind. I wish self-heal skill checks at least counted towards healing, that’d put a dent in it. 
---
Ah ok. That explains it. I looked them up but nothing came up besides Ardetha’s video. I want the girls he “harassed” to make a video or appear in a video with actual proof instead of these accusations with no proof. 
---
Same here
---
Nah you just stoopid 
---
You disgust me
---
Not really tho. You put nea up high on the list 
---
Cause Billy is top tier. What's fun about the trapper? M1
---
Nah that would not work. If it was an offering, then it would have to either replace one of your existing perks or add a 5th one and 5 perks would be too many. 
---
Why don't y'all like Billy? Making plays with him is so satisfying and he's top tier
---
I never tbagg nor click flashlight, but get camped in 90% of my games. 
---
Same for me. It took me a while to diagnose that, but since I figured it out, I don't recall getting stuck in the loading screen.
---
Offering for people under level 15 survivor maybe? Idk not stuck with the idea but I think if they made if specific enough it would be okay. 
---
My friends and I literally made this joke yesterday. Lol upvoted
---
The spirit used decisive flash back
---
C O N S U M E T E N D I E S
---
Don't be mad I'm not impressed by your rank 15 awareness of Legion, kid.
---
It depends on what you're trying to do I guess? 
---
I always run Sprint Burst with Urban Evasion, so I can move just as fast while not running, but if you set it off before you intend to, I'll run to a gen, get it done, and I still usually have a second or two left on cool down, and you want to run while it has that cool down so you can get where you want faster, then when you're ready to use it again you can let it off. 
---
Mostly, when you're running an exhaustion perk, you only use it when you need it, like Lithe or Dead Hard and after you use it, you'll still probably be running. 
---
I guess all in all, save it until you need it. Pop it. Then run around until you have to stop to do something. And hopefully it will cool down before you need it again. 
---
This subreddit resists and actively downvotes every post suggesting sensible balancing around SWF, there's too many players using voice comm that get defensive when you suggest that it's a pretty strong competitive balance. 
---
Killer dc  a few seconds after his hex ruin destroyed lol!
---
SWF is really a problem. Did you need examples on how voice apps in this game can be a really big advantage?
---
That seems like a bug not a cheat. He did modify his save file though, so the ban he got for that was deserved
---
1 yes level up leatherface up first bbq perk will make you level up faster
---
2 do what you need to win don’t let them tell you how to play 
---
3 check the dbd wiki it has all the perks there if you wanna check em out
---
4 to outplay decisive strike you can drop the survivors on your way to the hook but only if a hook is close you can tell they have it the white lines by their name or just run rancor and never chase the obssesion and just kill them after gates are powered withought ever picking them up
---
5 get the cheap ones if you don’t care about that killer get the good ones if it’s the ones you like 
---
6.sorry don’t play spirit much so someone else should probably give advice
---
First off all, they tried desperately to play it off. He knew he did it. Also, you can't go back back on what you said. You said he didn't cheat.
---
That doctor must've gone through all 5 stages of grief during that, that was *something.*
---
I'll lock the door when I head out. D:
---
Why do you run urban with sprint burst? There's no need to crouch everywhere you go just because you can't run
---
Meanwhile, when I whack a pallet or a gen to farm first thing, the survivors flee from me. 
---
But....you're the one using third-party boosts for easier matches lmao
---
How do you drop someone? 
---
Talk about being grossly hyperbolic. 
---
Any hexadecimal works better than ruin. Because you'll find out they have ruin right when you get a skill check, which pushed survivors to look for totems, whereas the other perks, specially devour hope being one of my favs, they won't notice you have a hex until they either stumble across it, or its too late and everyone's exposed.
---
I can't, not again. I'm not strong enough.
---
Why not just try and get better without third-party boost programs? 
---
1. Pour your points into whoever you are enjoying the most. If it's Spirit(good choice btw) then pump them into her.
---
2. Just practice a bit more and you'll be getting more kills. Learn the maps and don't waste time camping unless you have someone on the hook with the exit gates open. If all 4 survivors are standing at the exit, just stroll up and hit them because they are giving you free points, they'll fall in a way that they will just exit without you being able to pick them up.
---
3. Use whatever ones you want, you will have tons of them the more you level. Eventually you'll never use the brown ones again.
---
4.https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Survivors but the ones you are seeing are probably "Dead Hard" which is a dash forward with a lot of i-frames. Another is "Decisive Strike" which lets a survivor escape when picked up if they hit the skill mark. There are a few more that you'll learn as you go along.
---
5. You will eventually get all the perks anyway which is what you want to do. Getting them early just means you can get the better versions sooner.
---
6. Use addons that increase movement speed and reduce the cooldown of phase. Listen out for survivors when in phase and you can appear literally right beside them for a pants shitting scare.
---
I doubt this would ever happen because it's roped into the mechanics of the game but, I would love no music. Would make me feel way more immersed.
---
Nah I have no friends who play this so I’m always solo
---
Honestly, no. 
---
One one side it makes the game easier for killers to listen.
---
That would be OKAY if everyones music is disabled,but nah. Just deal with it honestly
---
How is it roped into the mechanics? It’s just music as far as I know. 
---
Yeah, and you can burn straight through all three tokens if you are getting healed and the enemy is using nurses calling, and you can’t make the healer stop. 
---
Sprint burst is the best perk, then it's dead hard, then lithe, and balanced landing is the worst. Tbh it's either way, I personally like to run to a gen and let my exhaustion go back down that way.
---
Lol, I made a similar post like this before. Definitely annoying.
---
I gently open the locker...
---
Fuck off, Dana
---
If there was no music you could hear the killers footsteps or breathing easier

I honestly wish the more "brute-ish" killere could just do that. Like Trapper or Leatherface just walking through a pallet like it's nothing
---
Also Monitor and Abuse is stupid good on her too.
---
.. I read this like ed edd and eddy
---
Do you play on ps4? Perhaps just played in cold wind farm
---
Yeah he gets a FREE 16k, sacrifice 1-2 people and you're in the mid 20ks, maybe 30k was a slight exaggeration but 25k for 2 kills as doctor isn't rare, and getting the average amount of kills (2) is pretty much the definition of meh.

It's been a while since I played against a hag.
---
I only hate her because of the fucking jumpscare traps, my heart cant take it.
---
I play on a toilet
---
Yeah, guess your right. Understandable, have a great day
---
I agree hag is fun to go against and all fair and crap but her crappy traps that face you to the traps when trigged mess up chase loops vaults actions or anything

ESSENITALIA

No, this is Patrick

Before all the survivor nerfs no but now? Lol cmon there’s a reason killers hate swf it’s because it isn’t easy to deal with like solo queue survivors are. When you play killer how often do you see yourself losing vs solo survivors lol be real
---
I guess I'll stop hiding in corners when they're at the gate then.
---
yikes

Ooof you've got that all wrong. Balanced Landing, Dead Hard and Lithe and then Sprint Burst. I hate using Sprint Burst because I cant run anywhere for fear of using it before the killer catches me.
---
That was painful to watch holy hell. That doctor definitely uninstalled after that game hahaha.
---
wig I just saw.

---
Yeah I get that, but I was just wondering if it was like a meme or something

---
There's a ton of reasons killers hate when you use voice apps the game isn't designed around, here's a few:L
---
* Honey be careful, it's Myers. He's still in Tier 1 so you're OK to sprint.
---
* There's a totem active by the shed, I can't get to it atm but are you able to?
---
 
---
* He's breaking pallets near ____, don't loop him over here
---
* You're safe to work that gen, he's on the other side of the map
---
* I'm 75% finished with the last gen, go toward the exit gate instead, I got this
---
* I'll provide a distraction, you stay productive.
---
* He's camping the hook, just rush gens
---
That shit just takes some of the fun out of the match dude, nobody is saying that SWF are impossible to beat or anything just....boosted and unfun. 
---
Why tho? You're just wasting everyone's time.
---
But it just wastes time
---
I don’t really need that though. The music distracts me during a chase and causes me to fuck up. 
---
It’s a victory dance

That's on you then, no one else seems to have an issue with it

"I have been chosen. Farewell my friends. I go on to a better place" 👽
---
I would at least like the option to turn it off :(
---
2 of them are thicc, 1 of them has a nice slim build.
---
cease this at once
---
Happens a lot late at night because of the lack of people playing in your region
