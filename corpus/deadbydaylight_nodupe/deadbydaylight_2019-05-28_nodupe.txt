I really like the idea, with tight halls but lots of open gaps
---
---
---
I WANT TO DOWNLOAD THEM, BEST CROSSOVER EVER
---
Yea I got it unlocked
---
Remember, not every killer is grown. Some are little babbies. I don't normally use such a derogatory term, because I was once a baby killer. However...well, you know...some people try and basement camp as Freddy. Some people unironically play Nurse with perks like Enduring. Some people willingly play Leatherface.
---
Poor Trapper.
---
Wtf is that ending
---
I think they should be replaced with Iridescent Vocal Cords.
---

---
Iridescent Vocal Cords: Glass like vocal cords reverberating with power allow the The Huntress to no longer emit a 48 meter hum.
---
or
---
Iridescent Vocal Cords: Glass like vocal cords reverberating with power allow The Huntress' 48 meter hum to be heard across the entire map, and become no longer directional.
---
Love/Hate relationships with the game essentially.
---
My computer is a fine oiked machine. No overheating or failing components. It's just a bad console port.
---
CJ definitely brought the mori tho.
---
Tunneling is a legitimate tactic and generally needed vs a good SWF. Complaining about that is just like complaining about genrushing.
---
I think you’d need both to mind game her and even then:
---
You shine flashlight at her and she doesn’t turn around she gets blinded 
---
You shine flashlight at her and she phases (while standing still) still lighting up spike chill so you either vault and she is on the same side from where she started 
---
She turns around and phases over to you giving you notice via spine chill 
---
Or she turns around then phases then turns around making you think she went around 
---
Does that make sense ? 
---
I think it’s still mind game able
---
Nah.
---
I swear that's Ochido.
---
I was gonna say burger king Myers but you said it has to actually work
---
That's fine my man:)
---
Here’s what happened: I was playing Myers on PS4 (rank 12) and absolutely destroyed the survivors. They got 0 gens done, and I managed to get them all killed fairly quickly. After the game this person messages me calling me a tryhard. 
---
I thought the goal of the game was to kill the survivors, but apparently doing that makes me a tryhard? Lmao
---
You can with normal vids and ads, youtube just doesn't care.
---
Watch out for the uplay people but WE STILL HAVE MORE ON STEAM
---
I miss when I felt like this :( And that was only 3 weeks ago.
---
Just try to never take this game seriously, because the more you play, the less fun it gets.
---
No dude, it was memes. I'm sorry you can't see that.
---
You’re also gonna get less blood points generally
---
Thats true
---
someone did this to me on ps4 and guess who survived ... none of us! ;-; owo
---
Also "gg ez"
---
I mean..... They're basically saying that they lack skill, if you were apparently "ez" they lacked actual skill.
---
Says you
---
*disorienting
---
&gt; winning or losing is decided by the better player.
---
Uh...
---
&gt;better player
---
&gt;Adrenaline
---
Pick one.
---
I know you didn’t put my girl spirit in A tier with Trapper oh man I’m about to fight someone lol
---
Nurse's Myers (Ruin, M&amp;A, Nurse's Calling, perk of yoour choice)
---
At least it was what? All I get are the boxes with an X
---
viable strategy
---
I disagree, I have over 500 hours and I still enjoy the game like I just purchased it. The better you get, the more fun the game becomes
---
I’m running BBQ, Iron Maiden, Infectious Fright, and Distressing, mainly cause nobody is gonna hide from my ass, I also swap distressing with Rancor sometimes for the sickening taste of sweet sweet mori if it comes to it.
---
They do it on purpose to get matched with lower rank killers or, as they say in their language "because of lobby times".
---
No argument here lol, its not my kind of game.
---
Make one for no father
---
Build?
---
I guess that may be true. But they are all very capable of being op. If they arent op they certainly dont make anything any easier.
---
It’s because survivor rank is so dependent on how well your team performs now and most low levels are trash
---
Should I run it?
---
This is the main reason why I bring lightborn. I've seen some survivors use it like its their bread and butter. As of late also I see less people trying to get saves and the people with flashlights just getting pallet blinds.
---
Umbra bug is your best friend
---
I swear if Yikes becomes an actual thing.....
---
I'd be amazed and nothing else actually.
---
We're currently "on break" since yesterday until it apologizes first
---
Doctor because every game i get against a Doctor, everybody suddenly loses all of their brain cells and lets him 3 gen strat
---
Get hit and get exhausted on the ground
---
If you're running BBQ, you're not going to see where the other survivors are if you mori instead of hook.
---
For some reason this looks closer to samurai Jack to me
---
You don't unlock them again after you got them, once you got the teachable it can show up in every blood web.
---
I don't really understand what you're asking.
---
Doc + 3 gen strat &gt; Post-patch Legion
---
Good to know thank you!
---
If you're struggling with tracking as spirit, yes
---
If you're using the glasses add-on, replace with bloodhound
---
The entity will end up eating the perk or the Mori depending which one I go for. I’m asking which one I should get
---
4 minutes in your stream and you dont say anything interesting, use a shitty build, dont know how to play
---
No wonder people dont care about your stream
---
They just sound very enthusiastic
---
if you missed unlocking them they will randonly appear
---
Clown deserves at least A, that laugh is unforgettable.
---
It will show up again next level, don't worry.
---
Damn for 30 million bloodpoints i’d repost too
---
Nurse with bamboozled, brutal strenght, play with your food(the one that gives faster speed) and noed
---
It’ll reappear later as you level. Those perks aren’t gone for good.
---
Play for fun not for ranks. The rank system is borked and always has been. The day you stop caring about your pips and play in ways that are fun for you is the day you start enjoying the game for real.
---
If you grab the brown offering that is the first towards the Mori, then go for the teachable, you should have enough to get to the Mori before it is eaten
---
But those are funny :(
---
*equips diversion and gets ready to throw stones at toxic survivors*
---
Sure it has counters now, but that doesn't make it worthless, just balanced. 
---
Being able to get off the killer's shoulder, even if only under certain conditions, is still a massive advantage. It can easily get you out open gates at the end of the game, especially if paired with other perks like deliverance, dead hard, mettle of man, or borrowed time which will either bait ds out or work so well on their own that you'll escape anyways, occasionally even activating just early enough that you still get to use decisive right afterwards.
---
It's more of a last resort for when nothing else works as opposed to the go-to way of wasting the killer's time. I like that the only killers getting ds'ed are the ones who deserve to be.
---
I mean, yes, the conditions you described will keep it from activating, but I could also argue that Dead Hard is worthless because the killer might have exhaustion add-ons, or that Deliverance is worthless because you might get hooked first, or that Adrenaline is worthless because you might already be fully healed, or that all the gens might not get done, or that there could be a NOED and you could be Rancor, etc.
---
Basically, I'm just saying it still might be better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it.
---
The only "nerf" it needs is for it not to stack with infantry belt
---
How do I escape low rank survivor hell?
---
I always tell myself “ he was a bit clueless and was sandbagging I’ll just leave” but as soon as I get to the exit gate my altruistic side gets the better of me and I play I need a hero 
---
Better then escape then me lol
---
That makes no difference to me at all...explain?
---
:(
---
The flashlight and Spine Chill are meant to deny her information and give you information which is great as without either you are at a complete guess what she is doing. The Spirit can overcourse still pull mindgames, but if she has to turn around to mindgame she loses a ton of information on the survivor's movement and sight and it gives the survivor good information as if she stays turned around it means she is phasing, especially if Spine Chill is lit up but her "husk" isn't looking at you.
---
I've blinded a Spirit out of phase walk. It forces her out of it I think but I'm not certain. The one time I did it the Spirit went flying out confused (she had both add-ons that increased her lunge and speed boost after exiting phase). I've also been blinded attempting to phase and my power kept cancelling when charging but I'm unsure if it actually removes her out if she is already charged.
---
lmao Imagine if finger guns did get released, but only to killers instead of survivors. The reaction would be AMAZING.
---
This does put a smile on my face
---
Games today have been very bad with bugs. I had a wraith game that said it was a good connection but proceeded to lag around the map, hitting us from 10 meters away. Hillbilly's terror radius goes silent every time I play against him too
---
This, so much this, I hate how the game doesn't allow survivors to be specialists, you MUST be a generalist and do EVERYTHING to pip and get bp, you can't have a specific build to do one thing, like be the gen jockey or the guy who runs the killer around for 5 gens, it's silly
---
Hard mode :)
---
You just asked for tips. She's the Game's best huntress. And im pretty sure shes made tutorials. So watch her. Duh
---
That actually looks terrifying.
---
Lol I had to heal myself and guess where the skills checks were. Didn't miss one 😏
---
Implying that being a specialist and doing one thing doesn't help the team???
---
1. Because its reddit and people like to complain here
---
2. Because its DBD and people are toxic
---
Meanwhile my friend's like. "Just leave you dumdass."
---
Some offerings that are special don’t flip, like a mori won’t flip
---
Bonus Round
---
Okay, thanks for the tip
---
well i just watched quixoticgreen play hillbilly and huntress with a steering wheel. i think no one has done that
---
Oh ok thank you! So is it every time they don’t flip or is it just a 50/50 chance or something
---
Wow I can't believe you're using the crutch perk shadowborn, such a baby killer
---
E N T I T Y D I S P L E A S E D
---
Don’t respect pallets, meaning don’t wind up a hatchet at a pallet because good survivors wouldn’t drop it and it will cause the loop to extend more... 
---
Perks I and mostly every huntress would recommend is BBQ, Whispers, Nurses, Ruin.
---
Only certain offerings don’t flip. It’s mostly only the game changing ones that directly affect the outcome
---
So what rank are you and why the nerf? Im rank 7 and nurse seems balanced with meta perks.
---
Literally none of those are crutch perk and literally no one says they are (except maybe noed), seems like OP just made up an imaginary argument for his comic, smh
---
Alright thank you!
---
hell yeah brother
---
Some offerings are "secret" meaning only the one who uses it can see it. Killer side, it can be a Mori, which allows you to kill one or multiple survivors depending on which one it is. Or, a Shroud of Separation which make the survivors start the trial all separately 
---
Survivor side, it can be a biding so that survivors start together, or one that allows a survivor to start far away from the killer.
---
Spirit Fury, Brutal Strength, Enduring and STBFL on Hillbilly
---
The quality shitposting I subbed for
---
Nice meme
---
When I play Pig I just do gens with the survivors and creep around everywhere. More often than not they suicide for me.   I’ve had super funny games by doing this. 
---
It’s a little break from playing serious and I think everyone needs it once in awhile. I enjoy being a goof on this game.
---
Oh ok thank you! Also what happens if the killer puts the offering for the survivors to separate and a survivor puts ones so they are all together? Or if someone puts an offering for a map and someone else puts one for a different map
---
Just some reference for anyone looking at this, OP is mad that his stream advertisement was met with what can charitably be described as a lukewarm response.
---
They buffed dark sense!!  :O
---
It's 50/50. One will prevail over the other but it's random :)
---
Oh ok good to know! Will the other person get it back?
---
No harm no foul; I hang around 11 as well because I cannot loop worth a damn either. I try with KYF but I still just can't seem to get it. :(
---
The only thing you did with this comment is out yourself as a major camper and tunneler.
---
Complaining about DS and borrowed time in 2019 lmao
---
No. You can only get your offering back if someone gets stuck in the loading screen which causes the game to be cancelled
---
Nope, every offering is burnt before the trial
---
What if we have rituals huh?  Cleanse dull totems in 5 matches in a row and gain 45000 BP, maybe that incentive should be good enough
---
its just luck, the prestige buff is just a myth
---
Oh that sucks, well thank you!
---
No problem! Don't hesitate if you have any other questions
---
Well OP, all I can say is "good try"
---
Overcharge with freddy, it seems that it would never work, but try that;) 
---
...kill me...
---
Well that sucks. Thank you!
---
Got a p3 meg who tbagged at every pallet/ window 
---
Got caught in a trap and killed herself on the first hook
---
Oh yeah if you promote your twitch you’re in for a rude awakening.   I used to share mine and people used to be so toxic. Not the time and place for it honestly. 
---
Other than that, ignore them.
---
I'm guessing you're really young. Let me explain something valuable to you. Sometimes, people will play a game just "for fun".
---
"Fun" is a strange thing -- as it is subjective, some people have fun to casually play a game because they enjoy the content and feeling.
---
Not everybody who plays a game is trying their hardest to be the ultimate master. I have better things going on in my life, I just play this game casually for enjoyment. I'll use what perks I want because I think they're fun. I'll use which characters I want because I think they're fun. I'll use which add-ons I want to use because I think they're fun.
---
So is this OP's one experience or multiple combined to come to this outlook?
---
Yeah it kinda does. But at least you get  to keep your items and offerings if the game fails to load in properly with this recent patch
---
I've been saying this forever. It's the dumbest insult in a competitive game
---
On OP's stream post, he called someone toxic for telling him that his stream is shitty, so I imagine that he's just mad that it didn't get any attention.
---
As it should be. Don't rage, cleanse and get off 🙆‍♂️
---
the kind that oinks #amandagang

I'm interested in yours my dude. Drop link

[Here you go!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBMEL_o8rbk)
---
Why can't we just enjoy this satisfying clip?
---
Because the community's definition and implications of it being toxic don't hold up very well, yet they insist on using it as a way to put down 1 side of the playerbase.
---
Nawh, this is from no0b3's once upon a thicc jane video. he wasn't swf with them
---
Consider this: If no one cleanses, the plage essentially has a permanent tier III mikey effect. Mikey cant do much while in TIII except stab either, same with plague.
---
That's not very good at all to be honest. As a Killer, I can earn 60k BP in 10 minutes with BBQ&amp;Chili.
---
Saaaame, op.
---
“Good evening”
---
Can we make Ghostface Tbag the Survivors before he impales their backs?
---
Yeah I can see that. People troll on the internet to feel better than others. Just gotta stay positive tho! It's hard to keep putting a person down that is consistently joyful and polite.
---
This is an awesome idea!
---
You can always act like you fucked up looping or act like your locker juking in the last 10 seconds on DS It's especially great with the locker as unless you make it very obvious, the killer is likely to grab you out of the locker to force the DS. If you're on last hook you may as well use the DS instead of continue looping.
---
DS is also great with Deliverance and Unbreakable. I've run these 3 perks together and I unhook myself immediately after getting hooked. The killer often will turn around. Chase the killer around for a bit and go down about 30 seconds on DS left. If he slugs you use Unbreakable to recover and continue chasing if he still wants you. If he picks you up DS will work and extend the time of chase.
---
This really kills the momentum of the killer in each case.
---
DS pick will extend chase.
---
Unbreakable recover screw the slug.
---
If he doesn't turn around to Deliverance then your team wasted no time saving.
---
Outcome: Two survivors DC'd literally at the exact same time after standing on a hill. Exact same time they both faceplanted. (Have it clipped, it's pretty funny.) 
---
Then another survivor makes me chase them to the corner of the map where they promptly DC so last guy gets hatch, and I'm yelled at for taking the game hostage. I'd argue this was one of my shortest Doctor 3(ish)gen games although everyone disconnected before I could even get a down.
---
Too true my friend! I'm on a mission to help eliminate toxicity by posting positive things on people's posts and subscribing to small channels and it's been fun😄
---
Might wanna add a spoiler tag to this
---
To be honest, I blame a lot of the frustration on the game's design rather than the players.
---
Except for Myers is actually daddy
---
Name a more iconic duo
---
&gt;devour hope
---
&gt;cleansed with zero stacks
---
All survivor obsession perks increase your chance of becoming the obsession. It's not a guarantee though.
---
Maybe if you read the perk description you wouldnt make stupid questions
---
Jokes on you
---
Is.... Is... Is that whining i hear
---
YESH! I shitheaded it up earlier, got a 4k, wondering how some do it proper tho?? Hmmmmm….. The quest continues..
---
id recommend adrenaline, dead hard or balanced landing , self care, and MoM
---
And we've diagnosed the problem. Its fucking cold wind farms and the PS4.
---
Damnit playstation
---
Nah you must be lying - this game has no bugs
---
"Try and bully me now survivors."
---
I love seeing DBD do well, makes me happy that a pretty non-traditional multiplayer game like this has managed to succeed. I remember seeing news about the game when it got revealed and knowing that it was going to go somewhere.
---
Gabi, streamer no facebook
---
Except Plague doesn't have the most important part about Micheal; the sneak attack.
---
Myers sneaks up in T2 at 99%, pops T3 right behind them and instantly downs them.
---
That's the biggest thing that makes Myers dangerous; an instadown out of fucking nowhere.
---
Plague is like a Myers who pops T3 at a pallet and continues to get looped.
---
Having everyone be injured is powerful, sure, but as things stand she's just a worse version of Legion.
---
Ah fellow quadette. We are the true saviors and then we disappear into the fog! Never to be seen again!.....until another scream comes from a hook.
---
hold up legion gotta take a selfie so I can get 90 upvotes on reddit
---
“I see this as an absolute win!”
---
Nah. Criminal would be using it with a Jigsaw piece and replacing BBQ with another "Fuck you" perk like Dying Light, Sloppy Butcher, Coulrophobia, or even Huntress Lullaby as 5 stacks = making it nearly impossible to ever snap out of it and thus making you unable to cleanse the totem or otherwise do anything.
---
I've gotten rank 5 survivor a couple of times, for my life I cannot get past rank 16 as killer. Everybody has their strengths and weaknesses, and even then, I really am not that good at survivor. I try my best not to pallet loop, teabag or play like a jerk, which is why I'm usually stuck around 13-12, haha.
---
As a bill main, he disgusts me. He is not a real granddad.
---
Huntress and Spirit should be A tier. Huntress' is scary but also awakens something in my loins and Spirit does her best Waluigi impression.
---
[Here ya go](https://youtu.be/ads2JwIeTu0)
---
Oh ok
---
*Didn't you hear that loading into a match as Killer is Toxic?* Jokes aside you're fine it's their fault they played poorly.
---
Thanks for the info
---
I mean this is kind of false, I watch Tru3talent, Monto, and Noob3 a lot but yet once Noed is active sometimes they can't even find it so they have to rely on teammates to find it.
---
I had a few killer games where the camera rotated and i had a "surely that wasnt a survivor" walk over and yeah there was a survivor next to me nearly
---
I honestly run noed on my worst killers as i need it. I'm fairly new and need the end game advantage. Anyway if you manage to cleanse all the totems and get out you really deserve the victory.
---
Probably Legion. Sloppy Butcher slows the game down to a crawl with how easy it to first hit survivors, and he’s probably the best Killer for Third Seal.
---
Apparently some cunts have a problem with this, so I went ahead and pulled you out of the negative, can't bring you back to 1 though.
---
Can you translate to english please
---
Not really a fact though, is it?
---
Here's a fact; cleansing all of the totems prevents NOED. So unless BHVR decides to remove NOED from the game, you should probably get over it.
---
Spirit seems thiccer than usual
---
Depends on your role. I tend to be a gen jockey, so this is my favorite:
---
Prove Thyself: to counter Hex: Ruin if it doesn't get blown up in the first 30 seconds. Also maxes out your objectives BP score pretty quickly if you can work on a gen with someone else.
---
Stake Out: gives me something while hiding near the killer, and makes gens go faster, especially with Ruin. If my controller is well-synced (console) and I can consistently hit the skill-checks anyway, or I'm not being gen jockey, I'll switch this out for Borrowed Time to be more altruistic and to fuck campers.
---
Spine Chill: helps me hide if I want to avoid a chase, helps against small (or no) terror radius killers like Myers, Wraith, Pig, Legion as well as gives you a warning if Spirit is using Yamaoka's Haunting or someone with a chainsaw or massive terror radius (Doctor) is coming your way.
---
Bond: helps see other survivors who are nearby in chases, which let me jump into the chase if they are dead on hook and injured, avoid the chase altogether, or find another survivor if I need healing, or to heal someone else. Also synergizes well with Prove Thyself (&lt;3 Dweet).
---
Wow 360 and annoying killers
---
Such a cool and new interestinf video
---
Oh and the bad music really helped
---
Thanks op for the shitty video
---
**D A R N**
---
The one, that plays the most quentin is probably Geistra.
---
This is actually sick as hell
---
Its a fact when its known by everybody and true
---
I like haha
---
"You're drinking cum powder?"
---
Are you retarted or cant you speak english right?
---
But it's not known by everybody, because it's not true. Whether you like it or not, cleansing totems is the way that the devs decide that you should remove NOED. Don't like it? Don't play.
---
Dude im looking at your posts and god. Damn. First get your own shit sorted then we'll talk some more, k?
---
I know right? It’s gonna be so OP with Billy wasting 5 minutes to get onto the roof, then he will probably learn how to start throwing his chainsaw, like the Huntress with her hatchets, at the survivors below.
---
Then one door is open and the survivor is there... butt dancing.
---
I wonder if this is the same guy who messaged me yesterday, telling me Billy takes no skill
---
Stuff like this just ruins the game completely
---
I want to switch over to Huntress more,  I need WAY more practice with hatchets b4 im comfortable calling her my main. What add ons?
---
See what I love about this meme is that people keep accusing me of making this up because "who the fuck would complain about Urban Evasion and Iron Will?"
---
But nope. This was a real comment from a face camping Spirit after the Nea with Urban got the hatch.
---
Tell that to my 2:1 DC rate when I play Legion. :D
---
it shows your total bloodpoints now how much you earn
---
babies, all of them :3
---
Most ppl in purple ranks are cleansing thr hell out of them. Not even funny anymore.
---
You just summarized one of my biggest frustrations with this community. Take my upvote.
---
It counting up at the end of the match includes my prior bp? I just had the game where i got 30k and it said it in the scoring thing. Maybe im dumb
---
What have my eyes got to do with porn and wheter or not i know the actress? Are you from stupid town or what?
---
Your english is fucking shit and even I as a german whose never been to a english speaking country or around english speaking people besides the internet can tell that. I am having a damn stroke just watching your posts and all that crap english lol.
---
I know my english isnt good but yours is def. MUCH worse lmao. Theres not even a debate to that lol
---
R.I.P
---
I've been playing Plague for the past 3 hours at rank 5.
---
In that time **two survivors** have cleansed.
---
Your english lmaoooo hahahaha. "Japonese" lmao get that shit outta here kiddo
---
Lithe-Poised-Quick+Quiet. I'm TERRIBLE with chases, absolutely horrible no matter what I do, and these hello me get away 75% of the time, and keep me in a Chase long enough the other 25% of the time to actually make a difference. Then, Self care because I'm TERRIBLE at finding other survivors without Bond
---
Interesting. Because he played as Wraith.
---
Legion deserves to be much higher imo
---
Everyone else's shitpost: flaired as shitpost
---
Your shitpost: ...
---
I'm fucking stealing these.
---
Well nurse x wraith is canon. Maybe she taught him a few things.
---
I'm trapped at 8
---
Can we stop posting this please? Like the 50th this month.
---
This is really good
---
And a key
---
[**S**](/intensifies)
---
Your right, but if you have to go irl, perhaps DC Hell expires after 30min.  So you can either complete the challenges or wait 30min.
---
Challenges are faster but not fun.  But, it hopefully discourages careless DCing.
---
Now whenever someone DCs, they really did rage quit!!
---
They still have yet to give her a NICE long hair head and I am OVER it!
---
Spine Chill counters Spirit so hard I love it. I was playing against a Prayer Beads Spirit and I avoided her every time she came to my gen thanks to Spine Chill. To put it into comparison two people DCed because they got grabbed off the gen.
---
Side note: said Spirit brought Bloody Party Streamers. Fucking imagine DCing on first down against a Killer that brought BPS.
---
I think it’s cool too!!
---
Dying light only acceptable w tombstone Myers to maximize wasting everyones time with this stupid match why does this perk exist
---
I get reset back to 14 or 15 every month because I don't play killer all too much, and I can moonwalk, bait dead hards, zone, etc. against people that have almost just started playing. It's not fair or balanced for them.
---
Don't you guys have phones?
---
To quote the Billy in my last game when this exact same thing happened to me:
---
&gt;lol your cute
---
&gt;my ping is fine
---
Instead I’ll go on a salt rant about how noed is broken and dead hard adrenaline needs buffs, this whole subreddit is just the same stuff has been like this for a while, don’t think much is gonna change unless the mods crackdown.
---
They’re a one shot down then. So why be mad about not getting corrupt? I don’t get your argument sorry.
---
F in the chat boys
---
It may take longer when alone, but it's easy af to clear them all while being gen efficient if one person has small game.
---
I'm legitimately excited about the "battle pass". I like the idea of having little goals and getting cosmetics as rewards will be awesome!
---
Bubbowser
---
Now I'm imagining Ronald McDonald as a killer lol
---
Fellow survivor players I too play the aurv I or and you should NOT poeer through ruin. The totem is very hidden, but running around you can find it! Just waste alot of time the killer needs,  it will definitely jist benefit you and not the killer
---
One time, when I was noobie and was playing survivor, I was T-bagging at the exit gates. Little did I know (I was going up against Freddy) that the killer I was going up against had bloodwarden. He then later downed me and hooked me near the gates. I kobed and got myself out of there ASAP. To this day, I never T-bag against a Freddy (or in general)
---
I’ve been using the Clown lately. I don’t like playing against as a survivor so I decided to give him a shot. Been getting 4K’s with him!
---
His power is weak. You can't interact with people until they are in the dream world and if they're good at looping... they'll run you for days. You can wake yourself up with a failed skill check. You can literally cleanse his hex totems in front of him because he can't do anything about it till you're in the dream state. He's very very weak against good survivors. Freddy isn't good past rank 15 really
---
If an offering says 'secret' in description then it won't flip.
---
Plague has a religious censer, that needs to be S
---
how the hell would you abuse this? try and bat man some poor scrub?
---
Do this and she will overthrow hag as Mori queen
---
No one really cares if they suicide on hook... it’s the random dropouts that are tougher to deal with.
---
It’s obviously not a full proof system, but at least when slugging a survivor and carrying to a hook then waiting for them to suicide... that’s a lot of time they buy you to complete at least one objective.
---
Where a random DCer gives you no chance to react... one minute they are there the next minute you are 2 survivors short in an instant.  No time to react. That’s hard to deal with.
---
But if those 2 DCers decide to commit suicide... they will have to get killers attention for a minute or so (per survivor).  That’s a lot of time that the killer is distracted enough to complete objectives .
---
Well there’s 13 other killers I guess...
---
Splinter.
---
yes abuse the ability to go nowhere
---
I disagree about Aftercare, you can activate even if you simply heal the person that got unhooked or if somebody unhooks or performs a healing action on you.
---
Why you getting looped? Gotta Clown the bitch.
---
I also think pretty lady would be a cool cosmetic
---
He has to pull you into the dream world to be able to hit, down or pick you up.
---
This is so exploitable.
---
Get hooked after gens done? Survivors can unhook you and you can get to the gate before you enter dream world. There's literaly NOTHING Freddy can do to stop that outside of blood warden.
---
But survivors can 99% the exit gate, wait for him to hook you then open it and unhook you.
---
And that's just one example. 
---
Freddy could be a very powerful killer but his inability to touch you out of the dream world and during the transition fucks him more than any other killer in the game.
---
And you can exploit him for it big time especially with a good coordinated group.
---
4 man swf? Borrowed time, Exhaustion of choice, any perk of choice, Prove Thyself
---
Honestly Borrowed time and Prove Thyself are the only two I would say are must have in that kind of scenario. Play the game how you want and as long as your team is somewhat coordinated you’ll be fine
---
I call bs, u can barely find a game in rank 1
---
Angry Waluigi sounds.
---
Not unless the game bugs out.  
---
  
---
Which you know...
---
Which is why you should only use DL if you have an Ivory Mori. Get the Obsession out quick as possible.
---
Watch any survivor streamer who runs it and Dead Hard fails every stream, usually several times. Tunneling may be a legitimate tactic but is a dick move and ruins the fun of the game, like NOED. It would be nice to make the game more fun for both sides, that is why DS got nerfed and Mettle is getting nerfed, and NOED is an equivalent perk that deserves a nerf or change, because it is not a fun perk or one that requires any work to use.
---
I’m just saying of course you won’t get rewarded for not doing objectives, regardless of whether or not he camped
---
On memorial day too. Youre a real piece of work you know that?
---
That face is terrifying
---
Invested time in something you can't be sure of shouldn't pay off every time. I just take NOED as proof that walking past a totem is not the proper way to play this game. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Hunting totems isn't productive because that too is not the intention the way I see it. Reasonably speaking, only one survivor should have to come across a totem out of chase to get it cleansed, and to power all 3 gens should lead to the vast majority of the map being covered at some point or another.
---
In any case, rage and salt are bad so I just do what I can and if it fails then oh well. I made the wrong choice.
---
If only Dwight had Head On
---
Billy radius = tinkerer?
---
NOED is easier to avoid than any of the aforementioned perks though. You can literally remove it before the killer ever gets it. I always do. I've gotten dstriked plenty since the change without tunneling. If there's three or four dstrikes in a game (usually is) you will get hit with it at least once no matter how fair you play.
---
GoDdAmNiT pLaYsTaTiOn!!1!
---
LOL this some smart alec funny shit though
---
Hmmm, sounds like you should either play survivor or get good.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
There still isn’t any
---
Dont do auric cells, you get more valie from a dlc itself
---
BBQ from l eatherface is too tlgood to pass up
---
Alright, then in that case anyone running MoM on Meg is sad. You already have Quick &amp; Quiet + Adrenaline.
---
As a nea main, I apologize for that nea’s behavior
---
I said we rewarded the camper by not doing the objective of the game. I admitted the mistake. I’m confused as to what you think that meant
---
I agree
---
A kinda funny one I like to use is the "Not So Smart After All!" Freddy build as mentioned in [this guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1628612661)
---
I normally use Discordance, M&amp;A, Save The Best For Last, and BBQ but I've had some fun with replacing Discordance and BBQ with Rancor and Hex: Haunted Grounds for maximum surprises for the survivors. (Expecting Remember me, only to actually be Rancor and Save The Best For Last, seeing a Hex Totem and it being Haunted Grounds, etc.)
---
Wraith: "Heard you were talkin' s\*\*\*!"
---
Or Tapp
---
I had a Jake using Saboteur who absolutely wasted his team's time.
---
It was on the Swamp map and I was playing Freddy, he runs to a corner on high ground and I down him, turn, look around. Every single fucking hook within line of sight is sabotaged, like I can walk half the map and not reach a hook whose aura I can see.
---
What was this dude doing? Has he even been on a generator? The game has been going for like 6 or 7 minutes it feels like, has he sabotaged these 2 or 3 times each? I don't recall that many notifications, but I was busy chasing and hooking others.
---
I used him for my Blood Warden and he managed to Kobe off without Deliverance while I was hunting the other survivor (two were already dead, it was just Jake and Claudette left).
---
He asked me if I was mad, but it was more... Scorn and disappointment; rather than anyone who was actually doing generators, a Jake who managed to make me slug him once was the dude who 4%'d off the hook and escaped due to sabotaging hooks while the other three survivors died horribly due to being on generators.
---
Like that's how this image makes me feel; "who are you to live?" :P
---
plunderers instinct 3 poops out skeleton keys and rainbow maps.
---
And don't even start with being Wraith!1!! Has to be invisible to get a first free hit lmao ezz bby killer gg ez grow up git gud lmao ez n00b
---
#yes
---
Da fuq is sonic fox doing in the dbd sub
---
Huntress should be lower on the list, dodging hatchets can be very fun. Everything else checks out.
---
I wish obsession perks were designed to have two parts: one minor buff when the other side doesn't have an obsession perk themselves, and a second major buff that only activates when both sides do.
---
There are more streamers than them, even on equal level, FunGoose, Zubat, etc are able to pinpoint hex locations since they have become familiar with the overall spawning sites cuz they pay attention to the common spawn rules, of course streamers that play this game so often will become familiar faster so for us players we need to take better advantage of our time during the match, cleansing dull totems before the final gen is fixed is something every survivor should take into consideration, besides cleansing totems, dull or not, give BP so it's not like a total waste of time and the reward is high.
---
Still I think NOED should have more strict rules for the activation of the perk, since bad killers that use it are rewarded with insta down by doing nothing at all. There are other perks that have strong effects but have strict rules to get the most of their effect, like Devour Hope, STBFL, PWYF, etc.
---
That’s obviously not what i’m talking about
---
My favorite killer would definitely have to be Wraith. I find stealthy killers very fun to use and I have been maining this stealthy boi since the release of DBD on Xbox. I believe Wraith is a very underrated killer and after putting many hours into him, I have found the most skillful play style I can think of.
---
The way I play Wraith is right away at the start of the game I go and find a survivor. One thing I really like about Wraith is right away when the game starts he can start hunting survivors and easily find survivors and start chases. Sometimes I use the Bone Clapper and The Ghost addons to confuse the survivors that I sneak up on to make them think I'm elsewhere, but then I pop up out of nowhere and most of the time get a free hit on a survivor. 
---
While Wraith is cloaked he does move a little bit faster than when he's uncloaked so I usually use Windstorm addons to help a ton with gaining map pressure, another way I use the Windstorm addons is when I begin a chase and manage to get the first hit on a survivor, I quickly cloak up and get in front of them to body block them from wherever they're running to. 
---
However, Wraith is a pretty loopable killer, so the strategy I use for looping is to use the wailing bell to mindgame. The way this works is I cloak up at the pallet the survivors are looping and I face one direction while uncloaking but then when I'm fully uncloaked, I quickly use the 1 second speed boost that you get after you uncloak and then turn the other direction to the survivor and lunge at them to usually secure a free hit. 
---
My current perk build for Wraith is A Nurse's Calling, BBQ + Chili, Enduring, and Hex: Ruin (Nurse's Calling and BBQ for tracker perks because Wraith has very good tracking, Enduring to counter pallet stuns and Decisive Strike, and Ruin so I don't instantly lose the game). Other perks that work great on Wraith are Make Your Choice (Wraith has decent snowball potential plus it also gives him a free down), Bamboozle, Spirit Fury, Brutal Strength (all three of these perks help with loops), Sloppy Butcher (for a little extra game slowage since Wraith doesn't have anything to stall gens), and Discordance (to help give Wraith information on where survivors are and which gen they're doing, works great with Windstorm addons).
---
I P3’d my Spirit finally today.  She’s the only killer I (currently) play consistently because she’s soooo satisfying to play when you get good with her 👌🏻
---
They too salty to get it. Lmao
---
I wouldn't mind if it was something like stalking one survivor drains them but replenishes evil in other survivors, or it replenishes over time. Interestingly if there's less players (Like when 3V1's and such were a thing or in KYF) each survivor has more stalk juice within them. 
---
This way you could still drain people but still have to go from target to target if you're running stuff like tufts of hair or tombstones. 
---
I dunno I find it cheesey when it's like "God damn it why do I always 99% my EW and only tombstone piece some other random dude and lose all that potential stalker juice" I'm curious if it's possible to tombstone piece all four survivors if you are extremely calculated with who you tombstone and who you stalk in what order. 
---
It's sort of funny though if you're running Tombstone Piece + Judiths Journel (Faster stalking on obsession) and Dying Light. "I drained all your evil...*now you're worthless to me.*" and then tombstone the obsession.
---
yeah. it can be a hand out for at least 1 free kill.
---
Myers gets bored I guess.
---
He’s the most seen killer for me on Xbox in red ranks. If you’re struggling with the chainsaw make sure you have your sensitivity at max.
---
This is literally the reason I hold off on Mori'ing survivors if I bring a Mori, unless they're super-good at looping or generally incredibly annoying.
---
Pls give auras.
---
Also it's easier to slow the game down - sure you CAN Mori that David after his first hook, but then no one is coming to save and heal his ass up.
---
Also if you run NOED+BW you generally want two alive for endgame, one on their death hook and one to hunt down.
---
Mori'ing instead of third hooking tends to be the way I roll unless it's like a Bill with Borrowed Time or an Ash with MoM or a Laurie who is the obsession and probably has DS... Etc. Unless there's only like two generators left, in which case, I'm sorry but I need people dead ASAP. x:
---
I had a game earlier today where one of our teammates was conveniently missing. I couldn't even see their aura while I was hooked. Eventually I ended up dying, and...what do you know, it was Claudette hiding in one of the basement lockers. Then, when our 2nd to last teammate alive was hooked (in the basement), she came out of the locker and teabagged him, then hopped back into the locker.
---
happy cake day!!
---
I was playing a game as Spirit earlier and o lay had 3 perks if I remember right, two of which being Ruin and Haunted Grounds.  We needed up on Thompson’s House which is already super survivor sided as a map and I kid you not 10 seconds on before I even checked the first gen my Ruin broke.  33% chance to not get haunted grounds..they always get the right one..still killed two and got a lot of hooks tho
---
BuT Metal Off MeN and DS OP??!?!!
---
Of course I've got my sensitivity maxed. OMG I couldn't imagine playing for so long and not having my sensitivity maxed.
---
It still was long, but the survivor's DC'ed once they realized how fucked the gen-placements were and how defensive I was playing. 
---
I've had games go on for like an hour of just 3-gen which goes from a 0 hook to a 4K.
---
Hillbilly is still amazing on console yeah (on xbox at least). Although I will say that against good survivors he starts to lose his consistency because he struggles with people who loop well.
---
BBQ and sloppy are crutches?
---
That’s honestly so frustrating
---
Agree with this + maybe 1-2 teammate switch out Prove Thyself for Unbreakable
---
imagine defending the objective so the other side won’t win
---
ITT: Survivor mains complain about noed.. What else is new.
---
I've said it before and I'll continue saying that noed is perfect as is. It's literally an adrenaline counter, that's it. People complain that killers didn't earn it, we earned it the same as you earned adrenaline and the fact that you can do my totems and deny my perk (and I cannot deny your adrenaline) and you continue to complain about noed being unbalanced is unreal. I suppose it's the reason so many people dc when I'm killing. Most survivors I've encountered have a sense of entitlement that really grinds my gears and they'd rather complain about perfectly balanced perks or dc and screw over their teammates than take a few extra minutes each day to watch a looping guide or practice a bit more.
---
Still, handout like that are cheap and ask for no skill at all.
---
Lol, good hags exist. Got double pip with hag like 3 hours ago. All the categories were red (don’t mean to brag)
---
Well I'm my experience, as soon as a Survivor reaches a loop or really any object and run around it, it becomes impossible to actually preform successful Chainsaw attacks. I can get them easily in the open, but at high ranks, when you're going against experienced Survivors, they usually don't allow that to happen.
---
Sensitivity and the crystal bead light always seem to be unknowns to some players with big hours so I always mention it. Oh and it’s hell playing Billy at even 75 sensitivity.
---
Billy: Can be looped
---
Nurse and Spirit: Highly skill reliant. Really easy to make a mistake.
---
After splitting my time between PC and xbox version of the game lately (after 1600+ hours on PC and playing since before release), I never realized how much I'd miss the chat function on the post-game screen sometimes. "ggez babby killer dudududu" stuff always cracks me up and it's a lot less funny when they just directly message you and no one else sees whatever word vomit they type up hastily.
---
I like to run dead hard, prove thyself, borrow, and bond/resilience depends if I’m playing solo or swf
---
Oh boi will you be scary when you get used to nurse
---
The only reason they can laugh is because you're letting them move on with the game lol
---
Yes that is my point! I feel like I do so much work sometimes and its for nothing lol As a killer I pip so much easier.
---
You can use this for tracking, specially on the game
---
Yup lol
---
Fluffy old man deserves SS tier
---
YOU CAME TO THE WRONG SHACK FOOL
---
Surveillance, it’s one of the first teachables perks I ever got. Have it on almost every killer past lvl 10
---
Sorry dude he just has a better gaming chair
---
Of couse. Thanks,keep that in mind
---
That's Mountainous William to you, yee boy
---
Because he's hot
---
You’ve been struck by!
---
You’ve been hit by!
---
A smooth **myers**
---
Hillbilly is strongest multiplatform killer every platform can play him at a high level. Nurse is the strongest but doesnt translate to other platforms very well.
---
No xD
---
I’m a simple man I see JoJo I upvote.
---
I'd play some trivia so i could kahFUCKINGshoot myself
---
I don't believe its bannable, just really frowned upon, mostly by sweaty swfs. 
---
I do it occasionally to secure my 1 kill but eh it's up to you.
---
True, sadly a post talking about the issue would probably never reach front page. This one is special I guess, as in it hides itself among the low effort posts by looking like one.
---
I used to check in quite frequently some time ago. Didnt really write much but always enjoyed reading discussions. Now it's all low effort memes. Judging by the upvotes its what the majority wants, or everyone else has already given up like I have.
---
ooof that sandbag
---
At end game like that it's completely reasonable to camp the hooked survivor. Especially if they're close to an exit gate. The people complaining about it are just salty.
---
Hello! Sorry for the late reply! I watched a bunch of nurse tips and tricks videos and also I recommend learning her with no add ons. Aside from that, as the other commentor mentioned, you just have to play her! Don’t DC though. You’ll have a lot of games where you will get embarrassed and that’s okay. If you don’t want salt messages then turn them off until you get decent with her. Because I left mine on and wow when I got destroyed the survivors would make fun of me. But do your best and learn the survivors movements. Try to predict their movements and where they will be. Blinking to where they are currently will result in many whiffs so you have to make sure you blink to where they WILL be. It’s a lot of practice but when you learn her.. you will do so well. People message me and compliment my nurse because they know how tough it is on console. Practice practice practice! If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask and I’ll do my best to answer. If you’re wondering my build, I use: Ruin, nurses calling, BBQ, and stridor (sometimes sub for whispers or sloppy). Good luck!
---
My only problem is Freddy being anywhere but the trash.
---
*rare footage of a Dwight’s real scream*
---
Read my reply above! If you have any specific questions feel free to ask. Good luck learning nurse!
---
Nurse should be higher, freddy lower, bubba higher, plague WAY higher, only half of her is gross.
---
I was able to blink on top of Gas Haven once during The Clown patch. I remember the basement was in the building so I aimed up slightly with a max blink attempting to not get shoved into the basement.
---
I got bodied by the roof instead....haven't reproduced it since
---
Megs die/dc too fast to be toxic
---
daddy myers 💦💦💦
---
"Right person". Quit gate keeping.
---
Relatable
---
Cool. No such thing as face camping.
---
me but i just want to fuck them
---
Is it really distinguishable between bloodwebs before and after prestige?
---
I feel personally attacked😂
---
The Claudette’s are the only ones who ever pull off 360s on me. Partly because I’ve played against some skilled Claudette’s but mostly cause she goes invisible when she 360s
---
Nurse is literally dead/almost dead &amp; DEFINITELY into BDSM. Listen... we've all seen bubba try to swoon someone &amp; it didn't turn out well. Adiris? Well i mean, since half her face is gone i think we can assume that half of her is gross, and due to how she looks, you may literally fuck her in half, so not dealing with that.
---
Freddy has shown that he LOVES sex, do you know his backstory?
---
His movies prove that he LOVES sex
---
This is my mentality every game. People call me a camper for wiping a 4 man team like I'm supposed to feel guilty about how I won?
---
This was the first game Doc never saw me. I wasn’t even playing Claudette, I’m a Feng Main lmao. I’m pretty good at playing stealthily tho and I guess I spawned away from everyone else because Doc was all over the other 3.
---
Sadly we did not win that game. :/
---
Dead By Daylight isn't a very good game for tournament play
---
Lmfao! I am on PS4. But I’m assuming I’m not the only one who does that. Between rank 14-10
---
I'm fucking saving that guy if it's a Dwight.
---
fuck buttigeg or whatever the fuck his name is
---
Yeah... with kids...
---
Weeb
---
Makes sense. If he's a child murderer, I think he might also be a pedophile. Maybe he has a sex dungeon in his boiler room? I'm thinking about this too hard.
---
I definitely don’t disagree with you I thought it was interesting when they tried to cash in on the scene at the time. I was even more disturbed how everything was handled through the whole process.
---
Billy can instadown at any time and has the best map mobility in the game.
---
"Skill reliant" isn't a downside. That just means they have a skill ceiling.
---
One of my friends plays the game stoned sometimes.
---
 At least there is no game bug more than Behavior
---
Yeah, even despite the inherent flaws, it could have been handled so much better.
---
Spirits A tier 100% xD
---
Wow, these are really well made!
---
*...!*
---
I'm just learning her myself, she is difficult especially now that the sounds are broken (I saw a comment from someone a while back that they don't even look at scratch marks when phasing but use foot steps and breathing instead - HA! I bet that feels nice) but let me tell you once things start clicking a little bit she is amazing and extremely powerful.  
---
My suggestion is, forget the match for now, and just practice chasing while using her ability. Fake phasing at pallets and windows, and just study what survivors do when they think you might be phasing. It's gonna be worth it in the long run.
---
Ohh boy, I sure can’t wait to escape and never come back here again.
---
And Thinger Stranges
---
I’ve been running into a couple console nurses that are pretty decent. Its kinda at the point when I hear a nurse screech and don’t just automatically think it’s gonna be an easy game
---
So I might be right, then? I've only seen the first one and Dream Warriors.
---
Literal cancer starts, but whatever works
---
Every. Single. Time.
---
Nice! Who would the unique killer be?  
---
Another idea, maybe a cemetery with a haunted house, maybe vampire like killer, I dunno.
---
I guess the metahor I should have chosen is a small community with a large tourist population.
---
Some people just want a fun match, but you can't really do that with all the jerks acting like they are more important than you and your silly fun. Hardcore or nothing, until the season changes and the free weekends are over.
---
Does it completely discount all the skill it took to catch someone in the first place? And if they know I'm camping, doesn't it show a lack of skill on the part of the survivors falling into an obvious trap?
---
I've seen fun, successful tournaments before. Their mistake was using commentators who didn't know the game, an unclear ruleset, and rampant lagswitching
---
I would like this. Neesh we really made Pig this ultra kawaii character.
---
You really typed all that for this guy??
---
Yeah! Damn dirty killer mains punishing survivors for mistakes! That should make him think twice about downing large groups of injured survivors!
---
It doesn't discount the skill to catch them in the first place. It doesn't really show a lack of skill on the survivor's part because it actually shows skill if they succeed the unhook. And the camping part takes 0 skill at all. It is literally just watching a survivor hang. If you are really skilled as a killer, you will get multiple people hooked at once. Rather than camping, go check a generator and come back to see if anybody is trying to unhook them.
---
#y e s
---
DbD's Freddy isn't the original Freddy.
---
Original Freddy was just a child murderer because Wes Craven was afraid making him a pedophile might be *too much*, so it was just implied he was a pedophile.
---
DbD has Remake Freddy who definitely raped kids. It's a major part of the Remake's plot.
---
Nah dawg, don't ask questions if you don't want downvotes    /s
---
When you're a literal corpse and people still want to fuck you.
---
Ok. I should really watch all the Nightmare on Elm Street movies. I should also watch all tje Halloween movies. I've heard most of them are bad, but I want to see them. I own every F13 movie.
---
Nea und Feng should be in S Tier. David down to C.
---
Meg’s are just stupid
---
Camping the last hook when the gates are open is perfectly acceptable. Camping during the mid game, not so much.
---
I mean, the killer has to have killed three of the survivors, found the hatch before the last one survivor does, and then has to find them before they open the exit gates. Meanwhile the survivor just has to not die. By that point it shouldn't be even. It should lean in the killer's favor.
---
REEEEEEEE
---
To killer yeah. But as far as being a Shitty teammate Claudette wins.
---
I think it should’ve been how it used to be. Sorry but if that survivor and their teams failed to do gens then the they really don’t deserve to escape. If they had to do 2 gens in order for the hatch to open them I guess that would’ve been fine. But the killer usually finds the hatch first anyways so I guess it dosent matter
---
Again it can’t be from my side because the internet IS solid 220 ping, which I refuse to play on. If it were from my side, it’d constantly be jumping up and down. I’m not saying it’s from their side, but it’s still 220+ ping.
---
Sure, but only as long as they add a crossahair and make the throwing direction straight instead of slightly to the side.
---
Couldn't care less
---
Something akin to overwatch would be nice, play 3-5 matches at the beginning of the season, and it places you based on your rank end of last season + your performance. So if you get rolled each match, it'll drop you a couple extra ranks, but won't throw you all the way back to R20 unless you legitimately haven't played for months. Otherwise it gets too easy to game for easy matches.
---
I said max moron 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ So it could be even 100 ping. I’m from Israel, which is probably why I have shitty connection with Saudi people
---
She’s licensed. You can’t but licensed characters (yes this does apply for both killers and survivors) with IS. Only Auric cells
---
Level 50 P3 Claude here. No distinguishable difference. Prestige only if you want blood clothes, everything is is negligible.
---
Agreed. Overwatch has a good placement system.
---
One salty killer saying something does not equate it being true for the whole.
---
Look here buddy, ya mums ya dad
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o09Af\_V5qQA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o09Af_V5qQA)  This is all there is about this image. It also includes pictures of the killer info page as well as the splash art for the chapter logo. It's most likely fake, but I thought it was interesting.
---
REEEPOST
---
Same here tbh, just wanna here other people's thoughts
---
Mom said it's my turn on the xbox
---
Spirit in C?
---
Look how you masacred my girl
---
Why is that not Claudette is the real question
---
Everytime i feed blood points to my lv50 already killers, i always wonder should i prestige so that less grey add ons would appear.
---
If you want to know what Hexy uses, go watch his streams. He doesn’t like playing huntress much.
---
What I'm hearing is "you caught someone and you know the enemy team is going to come and get them, so you should leave and do something else." I don't follow your logic. Aren't I supposed to be killing these people?
---
He’s better.
---
Round 1....F I G H T !
---
I'm a simple man, I see Koichi pose, i upvote.
---
A loading screen DC.
---
Never wind a hatchet at a pallet that isn't down, unless the surv is injured, they tend to pull it a lot sooner while injured. A pulled down pallet or a window is a much better spot to commit the shot. 
---
Great way to end a chase quick in a open space is the 1-2, snipe 'em then swipe 'em, the *oak handle* lets you get right back to swinging after a throw, so if you tag 'em quick while close, catching up for the down will be much easier.
---
Don't be afraid to fully charge hatchets and wait a second or two to throw, most survs start swerving once they hear the hatchet "sing". If they start swerving at that point, center your shot between their shift points, more likely than not, they'll do the work for you and eat the hatchet.
---
Take your time in order to better improve the shot, the *shiny pin* will allow you to keep pace better while aiming. 
---
If a surv tries to put a short wall between you and them and it looks like you can take the shot, *DON'T DO IT*. The hitboxes on those things is ridiculous and deceptive, you're better off trying from a distance with those things and letting the dropoff do the work for you. That's something you'll have to learn in your own time.
---
Don't bother with the *phial* addons, you're prolly gonna wind up reloading before you run out of ammo. Likewise, don't be afraid to reload after a down and before you hook the victim. Even if you only used one, hatchets are the bread and butter for Huntress, *DON'T NEGLECT YOUR HATCHET COUNT*.
---
I do...whats the problem?
---
Chuck e Cheese next killer
---
Pig is annoying but doc is somewhat fun to play against. What a joke
---
Add me
---
What? Why?
---
I don't know who hexy is. Sloppy works on hatchets. I personally use Bamboozle, Agitation, Iron Maiden, BBQ. Best build is purely subjective and depends on how you play and what skill you lack.
---
Yes which is why you should be trying to hook others. It's better and sometimes faster to just get a series of hooks rather than 1 hook for each survivor and wait. Also, going after other survivors is more fun, gives more bloodpoints, gives more points in ranking emblems, and I think you also get more xp.
---
Absolutely. They will end the game as soon as they possibly can, so you kill them asap too. But dont misunderstand me, if you are camping your first hook, you are playing bad. If you tunel, you will face DS. But if you can take an easy kill, take it. And if the exit gate are open, protect the hook.
---
Lazer Tag arena 😮
---
I really wish there was some kinda symbol over a players head if they have a party streamer prepared to be burned. Yea you would get people to swap at the last second and streamer doesnt always mean farm, but I would rather run thrill of the hunt/blood warden(something to make the game longer) and my own sreamer/ pudding rather than a mori designed to make the game short.
---
Adrenaline, DS, BT, any exhaustion perk.
---
I'm not saying it should be even just more/less giving my thoughts on that single aspect of it. The killer should have the advantage yes but it should still provide a chance for the final survivor to escape. The exit gates being in close proximity pretty much guarantees if there is 1 person left and hatch closed they are dead. Also with new people same thing. I think something needs to change not sure what or how but just something we aren't seeing yet perhaps. The other thing is many people DC or get mori'd (less get mori'd) mid match which hurts survivors for egc as well.
---
Ok heads up don't watch this before bed it's scary
---
Tbh. Not that hexy is bad at all but id say watch umbra or tru3 for huntress related builds.
---
A+ cat sidekicks
---
Hasn't it been proven Prestige doesn't actually increase rare drops in the bloodweb?
---
Darren Wilson, the 4th mario brother
---
Look on Youtube, a lot of people have shown it doesn't affect it
---
obey WEEGEE destroy mario
---
I feel ya haha
---
Yeah and when you hit everyone else they all have to mend themself, put nurses on, walk around and look at the deep wound bar and when it stops you know someone is nearby.
---
He isn’t very good but he doesn’t suck
---
Hence C tier, she is a 7/10, but you know, is dead
---
Spirits bandages are a little high
---
Inb4 We get DIO as a killer in DBD
---
As far as im concerned the killer cannot do any attacks on your wifi, my best guess for your friends might be something with the provider. As for the dc's, its common to be dc'd from the game sometimes, its a pretty sad bug
---
Her use it yesterday in a video.
---
Just play the game, trust me rank truly means nothing. You can do all 5 gens and have zero opportunities to save anyone (coz if no one gets hooked you can’t get any points), you won’t pip. Just play, rank 20’s have more fun anyways!
---
LULW
---
Nurse is one of my favourites too. Tough to learn, but super powerful once you do.
---
If you like Nurse and Wraith, watch some videos on the Spirit. She can go invisible for a limited time, and reappear next to survivors instantly. No waiting for that bell to ring. She takes some getting used to, but it's so fun reappearing and pulling someone off a gen or exit gate.
---
First time I laughed out loud at this meme
---
but hagg be T H I C C  tho
---
Is that sprit's nipple or a shard of glass?
---
~~or both~~
---
feels gen man
---
Both? Lmao
---
Legion was never good. I’m probably not gonna make any friends by saying that, but it’s true. No counterplay =/= good. If nurse had only 1 blink and was locked at one blink, she would be very good, but she’d still have no counterplay. People in this community tend to confuse the 2. 
---
Anywho, legion is not good, but he does get a lot of bloodpoints and is really fun. If you’re looking for an effective killer, I’d suggest looking at someone else, but if you’re looking for fun and bloodpoints the yeah pick up Legion.
---
I think the legion is really good for farming. You get loads of points playing them.
---
Not a fan of the company or the affiliation, but thats just me
---
Little bit late, but I highly recommend Aftercare. Being able to know where your entire team is at all times is so incredibly good for solo play and has saved me multiple times.
---
It doesnt have to be zero gens done could be 4 gens done. The situation is just the proximity of the gates and hatch not what happened during the match. Just seeing what peoples thoughts were
---
I think this is a huge thing as killer. If youre really struggling to catch someone or know its gonna take a while, just drop the chase.
---
That wasn’t confirmed until the remake, but it was always hinted at. I still don’t like that he diddled kids but it’s whatever.
---
If you want to remain unnoticed by the killer I'd suggest iron will, empathy, calm spirit and urban evasion.
---
Claudette arent a protected class silly.
---
Moris need a fix to make them fair, but while also making them a fun and exclusive for the killer side, maybe after X hook(s) or a certain amount of gens done
---
He's a low-mid tier killer and pretty boring in my opinion.
---
What's the point of high rank lmao. It's not like you even get anything
---
Camping is fine. Don’t play by survivors rules because that’s how you end up in the corner of the map for the entire game. Camping isn’t against the rules and is completely fine. Do whatever you have to do to get kills that isn’t cheating or exploiting.
---
You don't get to see auras of mending Surviviors (mending is different from healing) and you don't get to see if the deep wound bar depletes anymore
---
Haha!!  Hello my child ♡
---
Still the killer killed everyone before the gates were powered so he deserves the kill
---
It's a sucky feedback loop, hard to stop. 2 TTVers DC'd from one of my games tonight, so I stopped by their channel afterwards and asked them to not. They accused me of stream sniping, made all sorts of comments and banned me. I know in the early days of the game, a Psychologist made a post examining how DbD triggers a lot of stress points from the playstyle, so it just keeps bringing out the worst in people. Myself included, sometimes. Just gotta do your part and keep things positive when you can :)
---
The DDos is unlikely. I would even say unheard of in DbD. Don't know what happened to your friends' wifi though. Freak coincidence? Not sure.
---
Yeet
---
And that's exactly why so many people consider this community as especially toxic
---
This has givin me a spoop
---
Urban, Quick &amp; Quiet, Calm Spirit, Iron Will
---
Noed on spirit Pepega
---
Points dont matter
---
How did I know it would be a Dwight coming out
---
It's to keep everyone on roughly the same playing field. It would be wack if a killer could just turn off shadows. Or turn down level of detail so grass doesn't spawn so you can easily spot downed survivors or killer traps.
---
Don't be too hard on yourself. I was terrible at Nurse for a long time, and I started against rank 20s. It sounds like you've played some killer before, so it may be even tougher if you're learning at a higher rank.
---
First, if you're playing on console, it might be tough. The console frame rate can make things a bit more difficult than PC, but even if you're playing PC, she's got a number of unique mechanics that you have to get used to.
---
If you're not confident in predicting where survivors will go, then you've got to do the best you can to keep line of sight until you're more comfortable with predicting their next steps. Line of sight means so much with the Nurse when you're starting out. Maybe burn offerings for maps that have more open spaces or predictable pathing.
---
Perks are also important. Start with strong tracking perks, then when you're comfortable move to the other stuff. I used Whispers at the start, but once I started getting more hits, switched to BBQ and Nurse's Calling. Sometimes I run Surveillance to see which gens are being worked on, so I can quickly blink back. Sloppy Butcher pairs well with Nurse's Calling because they'll spend more time healing, and are more likely to appear if you're moving around.
---
I would advise against using add ons, or use the same add ons every time. Blinking is all muscle memory. Using something that changes the distance or charge speed just means you're not going to land where you think you will. Personally, I usually run without add ons, but like to play 3 (or 4) blink Nurse sometime because it's fun.
---
Aside from that, just practice, and try not to let the BM'ers get you down (cause I run in to them the most when I play Nurse). My favourite thing to do as Nurse is bait someone to a dropped pallet, then charge my blink. As I let go, I look down at the ground to stationary blink, and the survivor will almost always jump the pallet, giving me a free hit. Give it a try if you get the chance. :)
---
[Hmmmm](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/agnl4a/smol_billy_is_now_a_big_boy/)
---
Yours is higher resolution atleast. Good job on blending the faces though!
---
She isnt hard, please cant people understand this? Go 1 hour in a KYF and youve learnt her, Huntress on the other hand, NO ONE has perfected Huntress yet, and no one will because of the speed of the hatchets and how high you have to aim, yet she has Intermidiate difficulty when selecting killer.
---
But nurse tho? Have you seen her hair? And not to mention she’s a big fan of bdsm.
---
Agreed. Clowns butterfly knife is quite satisfying...
---
Youve seen the movie if you cared about spoilers. Go away
---
Am a newb :P
---
Yeah I don't understand. My ping is always fine but sometimes I get game where everyone is lagging even tho my ping is gucci
---
Nurse is honestly worth all the effort to learn her though.
---
You’re a monster
---
I see this as an absolute win!
---
If you want to have devs make a patch that causes survivors to safety pip when being camped, then you’re basically saying you think it’s so important that the devs should drop everything they’re working on like new killers bug fixes and dedicated servers to fix this tiny ass problem that has many counters such as stealth perks to not get found and hooked, perks that get you off the hook, or maybe just git gud. 
---
Sorry about the rant, but you bashing another player in because you aren’t getting the answer you want is annoying me.
---
I run plunderers and ace in the hole on my feng and heck it feels good getting items
---
By the "Boy they word right about you" i assume you played a streamer.
---
Dude that blows, but it's good to see theres still some good people in this community:)
---
Gen rushing would be nuts. Prove Thyself and Bond 20k+ just for 3 gens ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
They tryna make as many survivors quit dbd as possible so the game can die a little bit quicker just so noob killerd can have some endgame fun after failing to chase survivors for 5 gens
---
how is trapper not S tier? he's literally the thiccest bitch in the game
---
You seem to care more about spoilers than movie itself. Go away
---
I mean, Huntress seems like she would be a good parent with coaching but as she stands now? Id say she would be in F tier. Bubba, if its family, I think he would do well. He would protect them with his life.
---
clown should be S+ just saying
---
It says "boy they were right by you" bc he accused me of camping when in reality I was looking for a claud I saw running around the area.
---
The Chaotic Good of Offerings versus The Chaotic Evil of Offerings.
---
I would personally think that a heavy blood point penalty would be a more fitting punishment.
---
I stand by the idea that working towards little to nothing is a punishment in of it's self. And the knowledge that all your hard work will only be worth a fraction of what it could be could really hit home for some players
---
Bubba lower than clown?
---
But who says "they" were right about you? That doesnt fit the context of the chat. I would assume a grouo of people have publicly said he is known to act this way hence why i said streamer.
---
Bad luck sport :/
---
Sounds lovely.
---
In what world would David dare to approach Kenneth? Have you seen the size of this lad? David's pathetic fists wouldn't be able to able to penetrate an ounce of his mighty belly and it would only take of fraction of his enormous girth to crush the life from David's weak body!
---
&gt;Racial Slur
---
Fucking pardon?
---
But no one is assuming anything bout anyone in the chat... "they" refers to the other survivors around a hooked survivor. The one on the hook said I was camping. While in reality I was looking for the survivors that were obviously running around him.
---
its all practice, just keep going at it
---
I'll take that as a spoiler, didnt watch the Endgame yet &gt;:c
---
Camping just makes the game not fun for the person being camped. You don't owe them anything, but if you reverse roles, it wouldn't be very fun if you played for a few minutes, and then just couldn't do anything because someone was watching you die. It's just not very sportsmanlike, and that's why people get upset.
---
Personally, I think it's more fun as killer to be constantly doing things. Chasing and hooking survivors, kicking gens, causing chaos. I don't want to patrol or camp a hook for the chance that someone might come by.
---
There's no rules to play by if they aren't already limited by the game, so you can camp all you want if that's the way you choose to play. If you do though, you'll continue getting messages from people. Maybe just turn off the chat or messages if you don't want to see them.
---
But the chat doesnt show that it just shows them calling you names. It doesnt show them coming to you side and saying yeah he wasnt camping.
---
I cant take this seriously when Freddy "Kid Diddler" Krueger isn't at Z tier
---
well put
---
Bc that wasnt the funny part I wanted to show in the post. Lol
---
I usually message the killer then and tell them where to find the missing fourth player :)
---
So the game is saying you're on par with people who've never played this game before?
---
Best: Myers, Huntress
---
Second best: Spirit
---
Second best but I got hated on for playing: Billy
---
Third best: Pig, doc
---
Second worst: Hag
---
Worst: Wraith
---
To solve the BP issue, I think that they could slightly lower the reward of dailies and in exchange, whenever you complete a daily, it gets replaced with a new one. You can recycle one daily each day and all dailies are recycled at the start of a new day. 
---
Boot up the game, get 3 dailies. Complete 2 and replace them with new dailies. Recycle one and complete 2 more. Next day, fresh dailies. This still encourages players to step out of their comfort zones and play survivors/killers that they don’t normally, and rewards players for diversifying the field
---
I think it has to so with the steady optimization console is getting. I myself a ps4 killer main have been playing nurse alot more recently and doing decent.
---
This isn't everyone obviously, it's just people like this who piss me off lol
---
Are you the billy?
---
I was gonna say this was a repost, but at least OP put on some new faces and had a better resolution so probably made it himself.
---
Plague would be solid S, those blemishes are just too hard to oversee sadly...
---
Cursed_Trial.jpg
---
Billy can do this too of you wiff a chainsaw and not hit a wall. Clearer pic if you want to upload.
---
Huh... Literally no other game does that.
---
Oinky could kick his ass by seduction
---
Waluigi got replaced because he was caught fixing Peach’s pipes

Thank you so glad you like it!! Id love to do a collab!! I do digital art so let me know
---
pebble man ascended
---
You prefer Clown over Plague? Sure, touch Plague and you'll get a disease that'll slowly and painfully kill you... But Clown is fat and has maggots in his tummy ._.
---
Had this game as myers, the claudette mostly did nothing the entire match, escaped and somehow got mad over me and said that im getting reported.
---
And yet you're still fucking replying.  Truly, you have such a busy life, that both times I've checked reddit today, almost 12 hours apart, I still see you coming back to spit bullshit.
---
I like this idea
---
He's...particular. you cant play him like other killers, and you need to try and have multiple people asleep. Hit them and leave. They break a gen to wake up so you go break it too and put them back to sleep
---
Calm spirit it is &gt;:o
---
You know the survivor was shocked af 😮
---
He's shit, but he's get a rework soon.
---
Man the new doctor buff sure look OP
---
Ouchy
---
Once mettle of man is nerfed it’ll be useless :p
---
Hey if necrophilia is people's thing, I don't judge
---
As a new player, I played my first game as billy today and realized there's an inside map. Well fuck me, got completely bamboozled.
---
Didn't several players get caught cheating and the ones watching had No clue about the game and one thought Billy's power was only meant for one shotin people and the speed boost was the main strength of the power while the instant kill was essentially a bonus effect
---
I know that Huntress is the hardest killer to master, but not that is the point of this thread.
---
Ugh that sucks. 
---
I wish BHVR would do something about players like them but I think they don’t care.
---
Huntress not on S tier
---
Okay bud
---
*shining Justice*
---
I came to give you her most powerful perk. Infectious Freight. Other than that it will be all practice. Dump a shit ton of hours into her.
---
Oh no, don't take credit away from good console nurses. IT IS that hard. Try it.
---
Doesn't mean that whole Wakanda saw it, dipshit.
---
Welcome to the club buddy
---
Since when were you a JoJo fan Kaylee?
---
I legitimately don't understand why tunnelling is looked down apon unless your playing the pig and you just tunnel the dude with the rbt
---
[Insert comment from a Freddy main where he explains why Freddy isn't shit even tho he is wrong and uses NOED like 99.999999999999% of Freddys here]
---
Thanks😊 it feels good
---
How does MoM reward smart playing? You literally just have to get hit 3 times for it to activate, there is no skill needed.
---
I thought doing totems only give you BP, not a progression in boldness.
---
They DC to counter your BBQ stacks, bruh.
---
Let me guess, you didn't pip
---
Nothing has ever been as true as this right here.
---
I know hexes contribute (which is useless if the killer doesn’t bring any..). Dunno about dulls. The ranking system is stupid coz it is 100% dependent on others. Your teammates don’t get downed? Well how tf do I get saves? Killer sucks ass at finding people? How tf do I get chased? I get hooked first and never get saved? How do I do ANYTHING. they need to change it.
---
The only reason I rank up is to not face all the facecampers and tunnelers around rank 9-13, I hit rank 1 without actually trying before the nerfs to the ranked system but now I can only get to rank 3-4 by doing the same. So just push yourself a bit, and try to get one save one heal a bit of chased time and two gens and u will be fine.
---
YeS yEs YeS yEs! ! !
---
That would be pizzeria tho?
---
In order to use a key you have to find the hatch, for wich you need to have survivors alive + 1 generators repaired
---
I wouldn't call that unfair at all
---
Specially if the one thst has it is a Solo player and not part of a SWF
---
Why do you think you'd never get a job there?
---
Yes, true. Everyone depips when killer is afk so technically DCing is better since you don't rank down anymore but I still stay for the objective bloodpoints. Actually once I got the best emblem for boldness cuz I was apparently hidden from the killer the whole game cuz he was afk. But if you get found once then rip, game thinks you suck.
---
Id say huntress is the fuuniest killer to go against because no mateer how good they are it's so easy to juke em and when you run a flashlight they will dc(i speak from alot of experience)
---
I’ve been in a game like this but don’t have the footage. Unfortunately r/deadbydaylight rules don’t allow for player shaming but you could tweet the video to the developers. There is also a customer support button within dbd that allows you to message them directly. Hope this helps, don’t let them get away with hex:ruining the game!
---
Im using Frank, not the others. If i was(and they were 18), susie would be S, Julie mmmm, B, Joey A
---
how is it fun? while i was survivor purple rank i only had noed camping and tunnelling killers. getting back to red and facing red rank killers is only way to actually have fun. i love red rank Spirits and Michaels. they don't camp/tunnel mostly and play skilled and fair. only sad thing is the amount of Billies and Nurses - smol pp players who can't afford playing slightly weaker killers.
---
Would be cool to see! Wonder how they Would do the aethstics of the map to make it unsettling.
---
Dangerous click? I hope it isn't that bent over one from r/dbdgonewild

Hey, at least he didn't eat the kids
---
NANI ?!
---
Had a match yesterday, killer instantly found me. I could escape long enough so 4 gens got finished, only to get downed because a random suddenly runs infront of me throwing a pallet down.  Got hooked and facecamped. This bitch comes to me. Waits till i struggle and then unhooks me. Runs away with mettle of man. I wish he never woke up today.

There you go , hope it works

If i were using weapons/tools Clown would be A tier, who doesn't luck a good ol' high as fuck, fuck
---
Oh NOOOO
---
Susie would be at most S- (no one can beat #1 daddy)
---
fun fact, behind frank is every other legion member
---
How’d you know?
---
They are obviously in a kyf messing around. Come on dude how can you not tell what they are trying to do.
---
What can they do though? Technically that's a playstyle, so banning/disciplining doesnt make sense
---
Bloodwebs are pretty static starting at around level 45. You'll give a mixture of Commons/Uncommons  sure, but then it becomes nearly set in stone. 6 Rares, 3 Very Rares (Prayer bead falls here) and 0-1 Ultra Rare.
---
And that's it. Prestige 0 or Prestige 3,  that's what you'll see. So for every Spirit bloodweb, you essentially  have 3 "chances" to roll a Prayer beads, and considering she has 4 total Very Rare Add-ons plus the 3 standard Very Rare offerings,  they should appear fairly regularly.
---
Since some human beings called "friends" forced me to continue watching
---
Yes I agree. Just edited.
---
No doubt lots of survivors who think their god like will try and get in games with newbie killers. Happens all the time over on Xbox.
---
The sheer amount of disrespect to my Mommy Huntress
---
the same way using Dead Hard, like you could press E like an idiot and waste it, the same with MoM, yeah anyone can get hit, but knowing how to take advantage of your extra hit requires skill to use, I've seen plenty of survivor players wasting their MoM and getting hooked.
---
They have a website 
---
Undeadgaming co uk
---
Even more sexy than that
---
I found their website

Quentin B tier?? That sleepy boi needs a solid D
---
Undeadgaming co uk I found their website :)

You fucking swine, Joey is S
---
Hey, neither does Bubba afaik! Just... Adults... And possibly teenagers...
---
Wow this was cringe
---
I was hoping Leatherface would charge in to make sure NO ONE wins
---
did you report them in game? if yes, submit a ticket to support.deadbydaylight.com 
---
if not, i don't think they can do anything? no idea tbh but you have to report in game to submit a ticket.
---
the good news is though, EAC is able to track these things. bit slow on that frankly. but using hacks that EAC tracked is a permaban so they might be already banned.
---
Spirit, Nurse and Huntress are the most fuckable killers by a mile.
---
They have a website undeadgaming co uk
---
Damn dude no need to be an asshole about it, if youre in israel then youre supposed to have a good connection with arabs and if you get high ping everytime with arabs then its your shitty connection. You could either deal with it or get the fuck out of this game, if your connection is good then you wouldnt be waiting that long for matches with good ping.
---
Well for sure, Daddy Myers is still at the top of S tier. And yeah ik the rest of the legion is behind Frank, but i just went with him, cause you know... simplicity(and laziness)
---
She’s pretty high tier if you’re into vore
---
 its gonna be the same way on either side. And alot of people will just think youre being salty for trying to say something. Ive actually had someone message me after a game thinking i "bullied" him/her, after telling them i wasnt i was just playing the game the wayvit was supposed to be played they then started asking me questions about being a better survivor. (Im not the best player, so i couldnt really help him)
---
I always thought basement protector Bubba was stupid. Tried it for the first time months ago and it was the most fun I had on dbd in a long time. Definitely recommend you try it if you haven't!

Probably the worst meme I've ever seen on this sub is this one

Did you enjoy the 7 page mudda :)
---
Calm spirit: -___-
---
Evil within tiered down I think somewhere in the background
---
shaming for camping/griefing/foul language etc ≠ showing footage of actual hacks, i believe.
---
Damn. I play Nurse, and I somehow get pallet smacked.
---
For me, I always let go of mouse 1 the millisecond the skill check sound plays, because the killer is coming and end up blowing the gen and getting hooked.
---
That Ghostface guy will make the news public that ghostface comes to DBD today.
---
I don’t think so he played it legit and the dead guy ran him for 2 gens and we completed the other three gens before he died and he chased at the exit gate in the end
---
What's an  **animateur** ?
---
But I just said if there was a way to keep track of what people are doing and maybe count the BP they earn there wouldn’t be a problem for stealthy players. 
---
They can still be stealthy as long as the contribute to the team. 
---
However, playing stealthily =/= hiding in a locker for over 5 minutes and waiting for the hatch. 
---
Yeah sadly there won’t be another queue and BHVR doesn’t care so we’re stuck with those teammates.
---
None of what you said would have needed the survivor to be active. Could have been standing there not loaded in yet for everything you describe
---
I am pretty sure that at a higher age of the kids Amanda could teach them to do drugs and younger kids love animals. She can just be moved to clown level.
---
Starting running BT today so I can wreck the scatter face camper, but more importantly, so I can prevent teammates from farming each other lol

If you have to crunch to meet a standard, that means you didn’t properly assess the scope of the project, or didn’t properly assess the skill and/or drive of your workforce.
---
From a simple overview, even ignoring employee health, that speaks ill of current management efficiency.
---
Crunch is a sign of bad management, NOT a sign of a dependable “We get the job done” company.
---
So I applaud the CEO for working on that. But am a bit disheartened that he needed employee suffering to spur him to realize the inefficiency of crunch.
---
Cleansing totems both dull and lit count towards lightbringer, believe it or not.

SEE I HAVE THE OPPOSITE! I don’t get found all game and I get no progress in that! It’s bs!
---
I got farmed my entire team like this, Oinkgirl decided to trap them and let me live. It was so good.
---
He has exceed the max token of Autodidact .
---
&lt;3
---
I just mean, you don't get to rank 4 by playing that way, so either he got to 1 and heading back down, or had a daily for leatherface.
---
I laughed so hard when I clicked on the picture l to see the entire thing and noticed that Quentin look compacted lmao
---
I wish the game could be like this more often. You'd be surprised how many players actually want to have a respectful game and enjoy it for all.
---
Why would nurse and hag be draws? They're small women
---
the one with 507 points, not the the top survior w
---
I agree but she’s the kinda chick that’s gonna have to take breaks to breathe.
---
I honestly despise the new ranking system.
---
It is impossible to rank up once the killer tunnels you or when team mates farm you. People on lower ranks are just horrible and will drag you down with them. But it is good in the sense that people who don’t contribute much to the team are not able to rank up (for whatever reason they don’t contribute).
---
Maybe I am where I belong but before the update my highest was rank 7, now I play on rank 14. I even see many streamers who were always rank 1 having trouble to rank up. It sucks and which they would undo this change.
---
If you wanna play a lose the killer solo build I would recommend Iron Will, Spine Chill, Quick and Quiet and either an endurance perk or lightweight.
---
Because sometimes after a few toxic matches full of SWF babies and salty teabaggers you want to just remorselessly destroy a few people.
---
Yes, but you said OP was tunneling, but he is the survivor.
---
Oh cry me a river......
---
Scratched Mirror is an easy get via the bloodweb tree. You should've known that the game still takes the add ons and offerings. Complain to the devs. No point complaining on here.
---
Well Killers got a significant advantage in 1v1's with the EC (Some say too much, i'm not too sure yet), and Ghostface is coming out in 3-5 weeks
---
Oh trust me, I can confirm that she is.
---
This physically aroused me
---
I think you're missing the point LMAO
---
The Dev's listen? Hahahaha. Ah, that's funny. It's worth playing if Apex is getting boring, community is still mostly toxic. That's really it.
---
I've facecamped with a Leatherface before with the chainsaw rev'd after one did the same to me, but you know, toxicity only spreads toxicity
---
Maybe adjust your playstyle then, both actions and perks. For example, the new DS is a good counter to tunneling. 
---
If you can manage to pull away from those ranks, it can get easier to maintain as your teammates pull their own weight more consistently.
---
What do you play on?
---
Devs watch this subreddit, so you know. 
---
Also there is this thing where people complain to blow off steam so they aren't mad anymore, not sure if you are familiar with it
---
Agreed, DBD on xbox can be ridiculous it just depends on the type of players you run into. Recently playing as a killer just about every other game i had at least one person DC, and as a survivor ive had a few games where the killer would just facecamp until i was dead which gave the other 3 a chance to escape. Then you call them out on it and they tell you to "get better at the game"
---
What console or platform you play on? (Community is mostly the same i.e toxic players and tryhards, but still enjoyable)
---
Is the game still worth playing? Yes and no. It's still the same where it gets awfully repetitive but also really addictive. The devs have improved some aspects but at the same time still haven't fixed Freddy, DC's are still a problem and many more issues such as perks being op like Mettle Of Man and a few others.....
---
There's multiple killers that have been added and they all are good in their own sense. Same for survivor. 
---
Dedicated servers are coming supposedly in July, but if you're an Aussie player you may as well give up. No Oceania servers mean you will be forced to play on an Asia server and get about 200ms for ping.
---
You don't say UwU
---
Builds aren't toxicity bruh, people may whine that some are OP but that's why rarity is a thing.
---
My friend is possibly the best Nurse on console so far. Best tip he told me was to try to teleport behind people a bit so that even if they try to juke left or right, the autoaim will usually hit them. He's pretty damn good
---
if i were the killer, i would have facecamped that sandbagger instead of you
---
but whatever, I'll just run Iri/infantry Huntress instead
---
Its a french word (probably from Canada) which pretty much means get people to party (animator, to animate).
---
The nurse actually used to be able to blink to the top of the killer shack way back when.
---
Doesn't matter when you're on the hook with a chainsaw in your face.
---
If you get hooked and he wants you dead, you're dead, no exceptions
---
If you're good at Looping/Dodging, half the time I'll get bored and let you go to end chase. 
---
***BUT IF YOU TEABAG ME ONCE, I AM TUNNELING YOU AND PUTTING YOU INTO THE BASEMENT***
---
This chest was obviously almost open, who worked on that? If it was the Nea I can fully understand the DC.
---
Yes and no, but they don't monitor every salt post.
---
Zap 'em while they are doing a loop, you kinda stun them as they scream so they can't vault and pull pallets. You can find a rhythm to shock during a chase and swap back to punishment immediately after the shock for a love tap.
---
One time I let a gen go, it explodes, THEN I heard the skill check noise

---
I mean, I figured that much in general, I was was talking more specifically about the salty survivors that went off on the op.
---
I appreciate your input, hope you don't get too many downvotes. I haven't tried huntress yet so have no idea but was thinking of buying her so I will bear that in mind. I played for over a year as just survivor and have been playing killer for just a few months. I main hag and am frequently getting 3/4K with her and trapper so I wanted to branch out to the "harder" ones. 
---
To be fair though, I never claimed she was the hardest and I'm a "she" 😜.
---
Kindred is a GOD tier perk solo. Always run it if i'm playing by myself
---
Second Meg. I used Sprint Burst for my exhaustion perk forever until I got the hang of Dead Hard. Great for speedy getaways! Also most people at high ranks use Adrenaline so you'll def want that. Very few situations where it's not useful as end game starts.
---
End of game report showed they only had 3.  Took a screenshot and reported just in case
---
Noice
---
It's more like you didnt show up for work one day and they take your pay for 2 days.
---
The Nurse literally chokes you AND caresses you afterwards and you purr her in C? This ain’t it chief.
---
If they are dumb enough to try to save/don't get the doors open in time there is always a chance a second or third person could get hooked
---
Hey, some people are into that sort of thing
---
So relatable, honestly
---
Tell that to the f13 tournament players. Asymmetrical games that have play off leagues are so weird.
---
Second this. I saw similar claims a few days back. Well, guess we will see if we are indeed surprised with Woidsboro High next month (which I imagine would have plenty of long hallways for ole'Bill).
---
A tiny chance yeah. That chance depends on the players. A good team would leave while their buddy is being camped. Lf is weird though. For most people he isnt too great but then I see p3 leatherfaces and they really have something figured out.
---
Okay a few things. Doing a gen with someone else is actually worse. Points doesnt necessarily mean a pip. Doing a gen solo gives less points but does more towards ranking up.
---
If you want to get to the high ranks you'll need to be at least a decent looper. But you dont need to be aggressive to accomplish that. Just be ready if he finds you. There are several good guides on YouTube that I can point you towards if you'd like.
---
I'm not going to call you out about DS. I know everybody plays differently and I almost never used the old DS. But the new DS is a solid anti-tunnel perk which is useful at all ranks and can help change a game.
---
Mettle of Man is about to be changed I believe so maybe hold off on that for a bit. Especially as his other perks aren't the best.
---
I play on console too. Looping is a little harder due to framerate issues and lag but at the same time it can be easier due to the fact that we are using a controller. It's much easier to dodge a hit (takes practice, and isn't guaranteed but can be game changing).
---
If you have any questions or want advice I'd be happy to help
---
probably a migration of Legion players since they nerfed them into the friggin ground. so they say hey, im used to the cooldown, might as well give it a try 
---
^source: ^me ^because ^i ^did ^it
---
Them? No reason other then for power mostly. I heard there was this one guy who donated money to a streamer, and a message played talking about how much they liked the guy, and the guy died in a Battle Royal game. He got so pissed at this person, because he blamed them for a loss in concentration, that he banned them.
---
So yeah people are jerks sometimes
---
I like running DS, Adrenaline, BT and Lithe mostly. Good for being tOxiC and helps Save Me a few times
---
What's the name
---
Can you PM me footage?
---
Yeah watched again, hackers 100%. You can clearly see Jake instaheal Kate with no Medkit when you chainsaw her upstairs, and not 10 seconds later when you down her again, he has another medkit trying to do the same. They also used 5 instaheals during the video, and still had some in hand. Report these douchebags lol. 👍
---
Obviously from a game on Lery's.
---
I played as only survivor for over a year before I started killer so I'm pretty good at survivor prediction. I think that's why I've had such good success with hag and trapper. I'm still noob and usually only get to start of greens before reset but the skill level does jump a fair bit I guess. 
---
I also play on ps4 and literally just watched a video about how she's trickier on console so I think I'll have to get it on PC as well. 
---
Thanks for the advice I really appreciate it. I might just through some BP on her to get Nurses Calling and wait until I'm a bit better before I play her a bit more.
---
That's the thing, a good killer is a good killer.
---
I have a friend who can basically kill any team with any killer at rank 1. He says it's all skill, and he believes killers are WAY to strong right now, mostly to compensate for the fact that less then 20% of them are ACTUALLY skilled.
---
Yes, instaheals are one time use
---
I dont like camping at all. I think people should get banned for doing it unless it's the end of the match. Even then at the end If you are securing your only kill you already lost. That one guy doesnt matter. I also get it though if you want to secure at least one kill.
---
The Entity's like "I'm not angry.....im just disappointed"
---
This tier lists are getting out of hand :D
---
Woah calm down Satan :D
---
Killers are really powerful. Most people just are garbage. That's why we see perks like decisive and MoM get nerfed. Those perks never stopped me from getting anyone yet there is a army of people who complain about certain killers then people who complain about survivor perks. We never know if a perk is op or if everyone just sucks.
---
It‘s the updated console performance. I played Nurse a year ago and it was almost unplayable due to the framerate issues and micro-stutters. I can‘t speak of the Original PS4 performance, but on PS4 Pro I don‘t have any performance issues when playing her now. It‘s just her high skill gap that makes it hard to play her. But once you practice a bit, it‘s easier.
---
This seriously needs to be fixed, it is one of the things that fucks you over more than anything other than terrible hitboxes.
---
Leaving gen to unhook someone? Skill check. 
---
Killer is coming? Skill check.
---
Wanna to scratch itchy part of your body and let go button for a second? Skill check.
---
Pizza guy arrived? Skill check.
---
Someone calling you on a phone? Skill check.
---
Fire brakes lose in your apartment? Skill check.
---
Terrorist bombing your house? Skill check.
---
I didn’t know that, thank you! And yeah I prefer doing gens alone because I agree it is worse then you do it together. 
---
I will look up some guides on YT specifically for console. I think the hardest part about looping is to stay calm, play mind games but don’t play yourself. But just like you think playing with a controller is definitely an advantage. 
---
Haha thanks for not calling me out. I got shat on by so many people because I considered the perk worthless for my personal play preferences. 
---
That is sad to hear. So will wait then. 
---
And thank you for offering your help! I appreciate that you take your time to help a stranger on the internet getting better. 
---
What is your go to build when you play as a survivor? Are there perks that you consider as absolutely necessary while some can be changed for some others if it fits the personal play style better?
---
Spirit would simply port behind him and stab him from there
---
 Disconnects are too wide for any server. So I thought they should make me feel sorry for the other team members. 
---
 What crime is it that those users simply can't escape from the killer and stay here and work hard to connect? 
---
 Killer player is also a person.
---
As a console player, I don't mind playing against Nurse. As for the rest, I agree.
---
The high rank survivors stay in crowded places. You actually can get saws but you basically have to rev up and predict where they will run by. It's super hard but even then you can do well with Billy without getting one downs. If you cant get a saw to land just use the saw for travel when you patrol gens. Even just using the increased movement to keep pressure on the people working on gens makes him better than over half of the killers.
---
Probably i need watch more streams and videos. I watched full 5hs no0b3 stream, but there wasn't any Spirit :D
---
I play game less than 14 days (i have very long break), so i must learn how to play against her.
---
 If so, new users will grow up and lose the fun of the game as soon as they encounter DC's user.  New users must be protected and nurtured if the game is to last long and not fail.
---
I got to rank 8 only using freddy. Those people who like to continue to do their objects when they know they are being put to sleep are the ones that get hooked quick. So even though you couldnt interact with someone working on your totems or whatever they either have to abandon their task or eat a hit. As long as you avoid gates being powered freddy isnt that bad.
---
I'll sum up the legion for you
---
see survivor
---
activate power
---
stab
---
if YOU hear a heartbeat look around for red symbols
---
go to them with the power still active
---
repeat until everyone is stabbed
---
now chase the survivor as a normal killer with 115% movement speed 
---
also use add ons
---
eh, i figured as much. thanks for the positivity! &lt;3
---
I think that Billy is fair. If you loop, he can not saw you. If you don't have pallets, you can dodge him. It is challenging and i like it.
---
And most of the others are serial killer lmao, you don't count psyche on a horny tier list
---
We all know they don't, bruv.
---
poor Piggy, just wanted sta- I mean oink to the kate

Survivor: *makes an attempt to leave Legions memorial hospital despite not being fully recovered from their surgery*

Legion: “There's no getting out of this now. We're too good at it.”
---
r/perkbydaylight
---
It is probably problem at red ranks. I am purple rank now and i play against all killers. 
---
When i was rank 1, there were only nurses and hillbillies. Idk if it is different after pallet nerf and new perks as bamboozle.
---
Literally played with my SWF group, I drop a BPS and my buddy drops one, killers spawns in with an unflipped item. We start close together; wasn't a shroud. Tunneled and mori'ed, 3 of the 4 of us. FFS.
---
I /NEVER/ see an Ebony Mori unless someone brings a BPS.
---
I can't wait for Corey Taylor to be added as a killer.  
---
He'll push his fingers into your **EEEYES!**
---
It's literally the same if you dc or suicide. You leave super early and fuck people over. Honestly if you died on your third hook or dc'd on the last hook there is literally no difference to anyone else except the player who leaves/dies. The survivor team will still be down one player and that's the biggest deal.
---
Pig=upvote
---
Killer exists
---
Survivor: is this toxic?
---
You can't play the same way but you can not overstate how much the 115 helped them.
---
"if any more hits come swinging out of your cunt weapon, I'm gonna have to throw every fucking pallet in this room"
---
Im just playing killer im not even gonna play around with thos fools.
---
It is possible. I didn't play for long time. I hope that i will learn how to play against her. I watch streams and videos, but there are not a lot of Spirits.
---
Rank 1 survivors don't really exists anymore. I saw one guy since the update of ranking system who was rank 2. I and most stay around rank 3-5. And you get few ranks 10-11 in a game usually who get downed immediately by Billy or spirit.
---
looping isn't toxic it's just annoying af, but I'll catch you eventually
---
It is probably very rare in current meta, but i run Sprint burst. With this perk it is easy to counter her charges. When is was new, i hated her so much. Now, i am ok with her, but NOED at the end of game is annoying.
---
And he was always supposed to be a pedophile but they changed it for the original movies because it was too dark.
---
 Team games are about using each other's time together.  
---
You've used the good word "competitive environment" and DC users are interfering with your rank-up.
---
Or in this case, 7 times 😂
---
there are things of more concern for them to work on right now, how important is a Laggy skill check. plus no one else has complained about it so it might be your computer
---
Yeah, I can never make my mind up whether to use sprint burst or adrenaline so I usually end up putting on adrenaline. I should maybe try sprint burst. My problem with it is that you can't decide when to use it. I don't always want to use sprint burst when I run somewhere.
---
*cries in spies from the shadows secret meta*
---
Your welcome! I'm tired of everyone having a shitty time while trying to play a game.
---
You dont have to look up specifically for console, it's more just the method to looping. Which is the same for console or PC. It doesnt really change. Camera angle, punishing bad plays, mindgames, etc.
---
For the most part I dont question perk choices. People play differently so some perks may work for them that dont work for me. However there are some perks that should be avoided regardless of play style.
---
I run Iron Will and Borrowed Time on every build (except when I'm messing around with friends) as Iron Will is a good perk to help lose a killer mid chase, and is extremely strong as a counter to the spirits phasing ability.
---
I run BT because I dont like leaving people behind, and BT helps with that. As well as helping people live as long as they can. (Pull them before struggle/death even if killer is nearby)
---
I used to run self care a lot but realized I dont use it much anymore so I'll be switching that out pretty soon. Just don't know what just yet.
---
Last perk changes almost daily. WGLF for the points, or DS to avoid being tunneled. Rarely do I run an exhaustion perk but those are good to help make a chase longer.
---
But there are many perks that could be substituted in.
---
We'll Make It, Exhaustion Perk, Adrenaline, Spine Chill, Bond, etc.
---
Look at this [screenshot](https://m.imgur.com/a/qRERpmJ) time 3:23 shows Jake without a medkit then 3:24 shows Jake instahealing kate. 
---
Also I counted 6+ instaheals. 
---
Only in a perfect game where everyone brings purple coins, instaheal medkits, plunderers, ace in the hole AND then finds an instaheal in each chest, could this ever happen.
---
Yeah i can agree lol, thats why i set my account to only friends can send me messages, Us Aussies get way too toxic and annoyed in this game
---
Okay, the way I see it, there's one good thing here, and one bad
---
Good: Your a Freddy Main, good on you
---
Bad thing: Fuck Dwights, as a killer, they're my priority, as a survivor... I bring the killer to em' and let them die on the hook (a.k.a I don't like Dwight at all)
---
but there are literally builds designed to be toxic
---
toxic myers
---
toxic huntress
---
toxic nurse 
---
many more
---
y u do dis
---
Okay, So because trolls and salt farmers like to make whiners whine that makes the builds they use toxic? Pretty sure that's not how toxicity works.
---
Legion most of the time is
---
&gt;see survivor
---
&gt;activate power
---
&gt;stab
---
&gt;hear no heartbeat
---
&gt;lose survivor you just stabbed
---
Might be, though it's definitely not perfect on PS4 either
---
Insidious COULD be fun. You could use it like Pig's crouch to mindgame your opponents.  It's just that most people use it to camp basement.
---
How dare you run in circles, small jumpy person.
---
Let the comments begin
---
fair enough
---
and I'm on xbox and things can  get Laggy but only with the killers connection is bad
---
oink
---
not for me, people always go together when I'm killer
---
Big enough
---
Clown and Doc are minimum B-tier.
---
Yeah I understand, thanks. I'm a sucker for balanced landing though, it's oneof my favorite perks. I normally run adrenaline, balanced landing, self care and spine chill.
---
&gt; In terms of self-care wakeups just sleep them again.
---
You then have to wait another 5-7 seconds to hit them, meaning they get to go to another fresh looping area thus extending the time looping.
---
The point people are making is that freddy is the only m1 killer in the game who actively has a delay on how quickly they can attack the survivors. Yes you can just sleep them again but this just gives the other 3 even more time to do gens.
---
If you're so good just juke the killer and finish opening the gate
---
Here's a good idea. Less harsh, but definitely would be effective! :D

I had Amanda Spawn on the other side of a wall from me when we both turned the corner I think she hated it more than I did we sat there and looked at each other then the rest of the game She’d hit everyone but me and she brought me to the hatch 🤗 since then I play dbd with that person alot to this day so it’s not too bad
---
The best thing I am seeing survivors do now is to wait at an exit gate until the killer shuts the hatch and then begin to open it when the hatch shuts. If you are lucky then by the time the exit gates are powered, the killer will just be arriving at the exit gate. 
---
Sadly this tactic doesn't work well on faster killers like Hillbilly or Spirit but it works on most other M1 killers. Make sure to pick an exit gate that is furthest from hatch (Assuming you know where the hatch is). 
---
You could also just bring a key into the game or use a perk like Plunders to increase your chance of looting a key from a chest. This can allow you to open the hatch after the killer closes it which usually the killer will not expect.
---
I absolutely hate playing against a Huntress, absolute lowest tier for me. Plague can also go down, alightly above huntress, while I would put Legion slightly up now since his rework. And I love playing against Spirit, she would go all the way up to S tier.
---
Np homie &lt;3
---
Clown anywhere but in S tier is a crime.
---
Since Clown the following killers have been released;
---
- Spirit who is a high tier killer and plays really well. Takes alot of skill to learn but she is very powerful and has high mobility. Her perks are all pretty good but I will get on to that in a sec. 
---
- Legion received a rework which turned him from the worst killer in the game to a mid-teir killer. His power allows him to injure multiple survivors in a short period of time and he doesnt take much skill to play. His perks are relatively poor with the exception of Discordance which is a really good perk. 
---
- Plague is a mid-tier killer. Her vomit is great for applying pressure on survivors by making them all broken so its like forcing all survivors to play with no Mither. The sickness spreads fast and you can infect pallets and gens to force survivors to be sick. If survivors cleanse to remove sickness you can drink from where they cleansed to get 60 seconds of damaging vomit that can hit multiple survivors. Her perks are all pretty poor.
---
Perks 
---
- Series of perk buffs and nerfs.
---
- Surveillance, Speis from the Shadows, Prove Thyself, Leader have all been buffed. Prob some more buffs I have not seen since the Clown as I only started playing around the Legion release.
---
- Remember Me got nerfed recently. 
---
- Changes to ruin, BBQ and some other perks to make them more conistent. I.E the lower tier versions are not as bad anymore. Tier 1 ruin now applies is effect to all survivors but only has 3% regression for good skill check as an example.
---
- DS got reworked to be an anti-tunnel perk. It only activates for 60 seconds after a survivor is unhooked and the stun is now 5 seconds. 
---
- Spirit Fury, Discordance, Rancor &amp; Haunted grounds are all some really good perks. 
---
- Spirit Fury + Enduring has become Meta for M1 killers. After breaking 2 pallets, the next pallet that stuns you will be auto broken. Combine with Enduring guarantees you a hit on the survivor that stunned you.
---
- Discordance + Pop allows you to see what gens have had alot of survivors working on it and utilise pop to its full potential.
---
Survivor Meta perks
---
- Mettle of man was recently added to the game. After 3 hits it charges to allow the survivor to tank a killer hit while injured. It allows them to basically take another hit without being downed but if they heal after that point they have their aura revealed to the killer. Perk is getting nerfed soon as its really strong and has been seen to be old DS 2.0.
---
- Deep wound got buffed. Survivors in your terror radius or while mending have deep wound paused meaning that its impossible for survivors to be downed from deep wound. Its just a time waster.
---
- Meta is now normally; BBQ, Ruin, Spirit Fury &amp; Enduring. Works really well for M1 killers as the Enduring and Spirity Fury combo can be really rewarding.
---
console is kind of a different game
---
Challenging for the survivors, beyond easy to land the saw after three games practise
---
One nurse since BBQ? Lel how often do you play?
---
The best chance I’ve found is to wait for the killer to leave a door, open door for 4-5 seconds so no lights are lit, hide again and wait for the killer to return and leave, then fully open gates.
---
Spine Chill helps a little, and obviously Wake Up a lot...but running perks for this seems wasteful.
---
Me: \*Pulls out phone\*
---
That one kid: You got games on your phone?
---
There definitely are. No0b3, Usylssis(?) and OhTofu are the top that I'd recommend, with the last 2 having Youtube guides as well.
---
If self care helps you survive longer, then go ahead and use it. But my games it's generally not worth using as it wastes too much time.
---
Give the new DS a try. Its lethal when combined with an instaheal or something.
---
No gas allowed tho
---
&gt; Slugging is (in my opinion obviously) not fun to do and not fun to play against which makes it toxic because anything that isn't fun for either side has to be toxic
---
Unfun gameplay is not toxic. That's not what toxic gameplay is.
---
If you felt bad why the heck didnt you go for the guy who farmed him?
---
You can only do it when all the gens have been completed. 
---
Once all the gens have been finished walk up to the exit gate power box and there should be a pop up telling you how to open the gate.
---
Is this NA? Cuz I currently play in Asia and its also really bad in red ranks, you can't really find other people playing this game in red ranks. My ping is always around 300 when I actually find a game.
---
Wait until the killer checks the get you are at, when he leaves open the gate to around 15-20% so that no right light appears. Hide until he checks this gate again when he leaves try to finish the gate.
---
The people who say looping &amp; vaulting are toxic are the same type of people who DC when they are the first to be hooked in a game.
---
He said he's good at looping the killer, not losing him.
---
The silver lining is that the killer (Who was a P3 Trapper) gave me the hatch and didn't take the free kill.
---
Dead By Daylight has less players, and a different objective style.
---

---
That Billy w i d e

Had this happen to me, too. Hadn't internalized that Adrenaline works that way now.
---
You're 100% correct on OG Freddy being a child murderer for those reasons
---
I kinda love that you're getting downvoted for this.
---
Tip for more salt, replace the yellow calm addon by the one that increase the madness gain in the static field. Very effective heheheheh
---
Idk about you but spirit is just a pocket pussy take her with you

I feel like a perk should be based off of how it performs by itself. So I'd say Spirit Fury should be lower down because of this. Also I do not agree with Spies' placement at all. At least make it D. It's not a bad perk.
---
# REEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

I'd personally put Trapper and Wraith in S but ok.

this comment right here officer

The Wraith has his shitty "pain in the ass" boss's skull and spine on his weapon as a tribute to Sub-Zero. That automatically makes his S++ tier

with RB
---
Haha sorry, im annoyed at every post that has Nurse because most of them claim she is the hardest to play. When Huntress is way harder. And sorry for assuming youre a «he».

Smh Spirit should be S tier. Better nothing.

I know if she is phasing or faking it because she stays still. I want something "wtf", not just the killer staying there to try to mindgame.
---
Imagine using a perk just to avoid 2 killers.
---
👍 Yes
---
I had one like that. I was on the hook and the Claudette was right in front  of me T bagging. She only unhooked me when I hit phase  2 on the hook and then dced..

I like this a whole lot. I have no idea why I like this the amount I do but I will embrace that.

Also the fact that you NEVER get Full-State insta-heals from Ace in the Hole.

I cry 😭

Because you are evidently a man of culture and excellent taste

100%. Far too many instaheals, and that Jake just zoomed when you tried to saw him.

I know the combo enduring/spirit fury is amazing, but I would only put enduring up there because it’s still amazing without spirit fury.

Judging by that fact that the map has add-ons and Meg only has plunderers, I would say that yeah it was Nea

UP and Distressing are good with Doctor, SftS is nice after the buff, IM can be helpful with Nurse and killers with BBQ, Agitation and IG are good if you don't want to lose time or do a basement game...

Bubba can do some sick chainsaw carving. I'm callin it.

With ruin that's incredibly important.  But nobody uses ruin anyway.  Right?

Change Billy with Doctor. Billy is overused and for me Doctor is really interactive and his add-ons change a lot the game.

Almost all the perks you mention are either good on some killers specifically or in some situations/with some meme perks.

I like your art style.

ooo, I tend to use make your choice a lot too, its a favourite of mine with my bae- i mean when i main amanda lol
---
No. No. No.
---
Clown and doctor should be S tier, I loved getting gassed and zapped
---
you are now my favourite person, teach me your ways o great one XD
---
i can see why, congrats :)
---
Honestly. You are the most immature person I’ve met on this site.
---
The rule is. If you want to camp do it, less points, but if you want him dead go for it.
---
Survivor. If you get camped, kill yourself asap, fuck that killer, doom your team and move on.
---
Or B. You stay on that hook as long as possible to give your team enough time to get three gens done
---
completely fair enough, i do very much the same in kyf with the hex roulette thing and its always fun :D
---
Indoor maps are really hard to balance because both survivors and killers need to know where they are running to make good plays (a survivor wouldn't want to risk an unsafe loop while injured, a killer wouldn't want to waste time chasing a veteran survivor into 4 safe loops all within running distance). 
---
The devs recognize this so their "fix" is making Lery's have a billion safe windows in a row, but no pallets. Gideon has no pallets or windows throughout most of the map except surprise, randomly there are 20 great loops all on one side and the basement has 4 safe pallets guaranteed.
---
ooo good idea with using spine chill and deliverance, i might just have to steal it ;D 
---
also i see how crazy powerful that wraith build can be, nice!
---
ooo nicee
---
its always amazing when they walk right past you
---
best perk setup XD
---
Nice list
---
oooo nice
---
All weebos are toxic killers tbh.
---
The time to get them in the dream world is just very long. Like if the exit gates are open and you just put a guy on the hook, it's pretty much gg for your hooked victim. It's like watching a movie and knowing it's gonna be that happy ending
---
this is harassment
---
And plus, can waste survivor's time if they insist on going back for their items. Time is everything.

This is 100% false, just so you know.

Don't know about PC but on ps4 it's super easy especially on peer to peer games like this

&gt;The DDos is unlikely. I would even say unheard of in DbD. Don't know what happened to your friends' wifi though. Freak coincidence? Not sure.

* Spirit Fury and Enduring are both underwhelming without the other. It's tough to say where they should be on a tier list given this fact (a perk relying on other perks is wonky), but it's worth making note of and clarifying, as neither would be S-tier without the other.
---
* I would move STBFL down several tiers. Its effect is underwhelming even in the best case where the obsession is the last one you find.
---
* Rancor isn't a very good perk. It *exudes* counterplay and is generally unlikely to work out.
---
* Hex perks in general are too high on the list. Ruin is a good perk because it has an effect in the time before it gets broken. Devour Hope + Huntress Lullaby do not, and the latter is especially bad, because the survivors get the debuff for it and know it exists, even at 0 tokens, as soon as they start working on a generator. NOED I think is also not that good because of how hard it falls off against good survivors.
---
* Monitor and Abuse is probably A tier. Reduced terror radius is ludicrously valuable on a lot of killers. I don't object to the idea of it being B tier, though.
---
* Thanatophobia deserves to move down multiple tiers. The action speed slow equates to generators taking 12 seconds longer, assuming all 4 survivors are injured for the entire duration of the generator. Absolutely minimal effect, even in the best case.
---
* Whispers is A tier for sure. Single best tracking perk in the game, saves a lot of time.
---
* Deerstalker is not that bad, its effect is just overshadowed by Nurse's and BBQ.
---
* Make Your Choice is probably not that good outside of Hag, but I don't have enough experience with the perk to solidly say, and the theorycraft around it is too complicated to say for sure.
---
Good list but Myers should be higher
---

---
When people quit against a rank 17 trapper lmao. They must be totes potato.
---
He was gonna be in B tier but he doesn't really have any ways to get around bullets
---
I hate the Claudette stereotype. I don't run P3 Claudette, I just run a good saviour Claud like a good little healer, and I still get tunneled, camped, BM'd, and abused by my teammates every time. I never suffer that as Quentin, or Tapp, or any other character in the game. And it's depressing because in-lore Claudette is supposed to be one of the nicest people...*period*.
---
The Chili I believe is made by him but in the 3rd one it was made the by one of the brothers and in one scene his chili won and was awarding winning chili. I mainly just went with the kinda unknown facts also BBQ and chili perk image is people being sucked into the chili bowl basically saying it's made out of flesh
---
There are so many Leatherface skins that would make an Insidious Bubba actually terrifying. Rounding a corner and hearing the scare chord as he moves and seeing THAT coming at you.
---
Thanks! i'm only a 3D artist so it was hard to get the Unreal camera and lighting working but i wanted to go spooky. 
---
If you wanna see it in a less scary form [here's the full 3D model](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/lVxW25) for you to view. i also recently made a DBD inspired survivor character, and am always looking for feedback.
---
I can't do shit when I'm stoned, and I'm a tryhard, because I'm a very sore loser. I tried to play killer on acid once, and it was disastrous.
---
Ghostface should either get a Woodsboro high map, a town based map or a map based off Stu’s House. Anything else wouldn’t fit the killer
---
Killers in the same tier are ranked in order of strength
---
yea the winner chili was made out of flesh to, that's why my guess that is the same chili as in the movie
---
I wanted to make a trailer in the style of a DLC teaser. It's not a real game but i wanted it to be as convincing as possible, so if you were to look at that trailer you'd think "oh that looks like a cool game, i'll keep an eye out for that."
---
Nope, daddy Myers

---
I brainstormed this and I may have found a way to not only retain Dying Light’s power but allow more interactivity. Strap in this is gonna be a heavy one. 
---
Dying Light: At the beginning of the trial, a lantern will spawn in the basement. Any survivor who picks this lantern up will activate the perk and be granted 50% bonus speed to altruistic actions and will immediately become your Obsession. When your Dying Light obsession dies by any means, the lantern fades, causing a 25% action speed penalty for all actions to the remaining survivors. Additionally, if no survivor has picked up the lantern and each has been hooked at least once, you may extinguish the lantern, causing the survivors to suffer the same penalty. 
---
I think this not only addresses the main issue with DL, but also gives the survivors more of a risk/reward in its activation as well as a heavy punishment for attempting to ignore it.
---
Yeah I mean besides all the.... gooey stuff... I think she should be higher
---
What other survivor perks do you hate
---
I would say Spirit is ALMOST as good as nurse at dealing with SWF especially with some of her best add ons and Hillbilly is still pretty high up there.
---
Some people are into that. I'm sure we can think of something for it.
---
My childhood has now collided with my teen years and I’m shook
---
I feel like Leatherface should be up a tier. He can down multiple survivors, destroy loops and has pretty good add-ons. I mean his ability really isn't good in chases but it is great at applying pressure when all survivors are grouped plus alot of survivors run into lockers to avoid the chainsaw swing but get downed by the tantrum. This is all coming from experience as someone who mains Leatherface. Not saying he is good though he has plenty of negatives like his slowed movement speed, besides that I agree.
---
I envy you greatly. It's gotten to the point where fooling around every other game as Pizza Dwight sounds like something I have to do.
---
Mad grit is strong tho
---
Spine Chill is one of the most skillful perks there is and you’re complaining about it. Why?
---
He shrugs off six bullets in the first film alone
---
You're not even sure and you hate him?
---
lmao I gotta practice my mettle of man counterplay more I guess
---
*Literally took 6 magnum shots and 2 bullets in the eyes and lit on fire, all in the same day and lived*
---
You’re stupid
---
this is the only killer tier list i can agree with
---
I know what looping is. like 80% of the times I play a killer game against someone who compulsively loops, everyone else dies, and they get the hatch. It doesn't help the team escape.
---
David: you when you get into a relationship
---
Wraith: all the single, attractive people who come out of the woodwork as soon as you're not single anymore
---
I'm getting this vibe that you've only ever surpassed rank 10.
---
And that’s why you don’t camp hatch in end game lol
---
Use it to see in dark places obviously
---
Eh, my friend had the game less than 24 hours after I got him a copy this weekend and decided to try a match with a level 5 spirit and after they all escaped, they thought they were cool bois mocking him afterward in chat.
---
Then people like that wonder why killers show up with ebony moris and NOED.
---
Because Behaviour is absolutely horrible at fixing their game, DC's are so common for people atm even just in the middle of the game on its own. Not to mention the amount of BS that happens in game that shouldnt happen and we shouldnt have to tolerate. Prime example, huntresses hatchets hitting through walls, Billies chainsaw hitting through windows when youve already vaulted and moved away from the window, killers hitting you and teleporting back to the other side of the pallet, dead hard launching you into a wall for no reason, or it just not working at all, so many things.
---
yeah, those players derank on purpose just to bully inexperienced killers and being extremely toxic and ruin the fun for the killer so they can feel good about themselves lol
---
It's not too difficult imho. Unless you have bad teammates or something, you only need to do gens and be able to run the killer for a decent amount of time (always be running to a vault, pallet, loop etc) for people to do gens.
---
Nearly had one of these yesterday on Spirit it but I was feeling generous and gave last batch so I was missing a couple hundred sacrifice points
---
Pig is love. Pig is life.
---
i will destroy you dont u dare touch dwight
---
My problem with Leatherface is, that he has pretty much no map pressure, and his instadown can be countered relatively easily with windows, and even pallets if you get the timing right (which isnt too hard  since he is too slow while chainsawing). His tantrum is too much of a drawback for a missed chainsaw, because of that he loses even more pressure on the survivors. But I have to admit that he can make up for it if he gets a succesful chainsaw the first time.
---
It does help the team escape because it wastes the killers time while everybody else just does gens
---
Dafuck
---
Oh I've touched countless Dwights, and some, even 2 close, like stabby stabby close. But I'll be waiting for u, just another Dwight to the collection
---
Title can be applied to this post and post on r/dbdr34
---
...what? That doesn’t make any sense, if you are being looped, why would the teammates die?
---
&gt;:-( i will destroy ur bloodline
---
I mean yeah, usually I just try to walk out of their view or just away. If they're phasing, they can't see me, and no trail. If she isn't, well, she needs to move cause I'm moving away.
---
If someone is good at looping the killer around and the killer is stupid enough to continue chasing them for long periods of time then I’d say that’s actually the BEST way to help your team escape.  If one person is effectively looping the killer that’s 3 other people that can work on gens for free/breaking totems/etc.
---
Yup. There are people out there who act like assnuggets. Maybe they’ll learn one day. Probably, maybe.
---
Now if a killer camps and tunnels me in the first 30 seconds of the game, and I by the light of god escape, you can best believe they’re getting an emote, maybe 2.
---
What do you mean? Just use stairs that are on your left
---
Didn’t need too
---
Plague is fun to play against?    
---
Guess there’s something I don’t get
---
There's no way up there, at least no way that I could find
---
Yea but they do that most of the time anyway lmao
---
You my friend are blind.
---
The stairs on your left? Also up there is a regular totem spawn just fyi.
---
He's not fun to play against, but I understand your points. Those can be frustrating for killers to deal with.
---
We love to just take your Hex and fucking cleanse them. Ugh my idols #GayRats.
---
I dunno, I'm sitting on gobs of ebony moris because I think they're dumb, but survivors like that make me want to use them just to taste the salt.
---
I get that but how in the fuck does a 7 Foot man in a white mask and overalls not get seen for that long also he has in 2018 sequel he took a rifle to the body and he got lit on fire which would probably melt a normal person but he literally shrugs it off and goes missing keep in mind Micheal is in his 60s in the sequel. Micheal has been shot,lit on fire, ran over, stabbed,  and exploded. If we take all of that into account plus Ash never fighting Micheal before Micheal could easily kill Ash in 3-4 stabs depending if he gets the full knife through plus if  Micheal can lift someone overweight so he could easily throw Ash into spikes.
---
Wow I can't believe I haven't seen that one before. The gays have failed me.
---
In Halloween 4 he gets shot by multiple cops (some with pistols, some with shotguns, some with automatic weapons) and fell into a mine shaft.
---
If it helps you have faith in the community, I don't tunnel when I'm killer. I play fair and I still kick ass. People call them "imaginary rules" but, damn it, I care about etiquette and everyone having a good, clean game!
---
Yeah, fuck Franklin.
---
I love how many people hate to play against Spirit.  As an almost exclusively Spirit player when I play killer, I am sorry, and if you aren’t a jerk, I’ll likely give you hatch if you survive to last :)
---
gl
---
She even had a second chance when you missed the first attack
---
despunk them fucking hexes hmmmmhmhmhmmllll
---
You thought it was just a bush, BUT IT WAS ME CLAUDETTE!
---
The reason they're so high is cause they're really the only ones with supernatural powers unlike most of the others.
---
That is a low effort meme sire, go on r/dankmemes and you will find plenty there
---
Yeah, but Ash deals with the supernatural on a daily basis. Their supernatural abilities all boil down to "can teleport" and Spirit's teleportation is the best, and Ash has been shown to have no issue with it.
---
Great work!
---
Hello
---
Ummm. Just to clear things up, I was the survivor on top.
---
Yeah I know it's just they'd be the ones to last the longest cause they can teleport.
---
They could do the Hamburgler too lmao
---
Literally how in gods name is that even remotely toxic or cheap in any manner lmao, that perk never gives me problems as killer
---
Wow people being dicks in dbd what a surprise!
---
Nice censor btw
---
Myers would do better than all three of them though. He has supernatural level stealth, the strength to lift grown adults by the throat, and an insanely high healing factor. He'd be a fairer match up than those three.
---
Serect your curr
---
DBD is a team game. You could be the best player in all of DBD, but if your team dies, then your chances of personally escaping are low.
---
In order for an exit gate 1v1 to happen, your team has to get crushed, and then the killer has to find hatch before you do. Your chances are intentionally low because you've already lost by a lot.
---
r/surrealmemes vibes
---
yeah, most of them hate playing against capable or at least decent killers at those ranks so they just dc
---
Why would someone dislike?
---
I'm honoured
---
Sounds pretty damn good, but nobody uses Freddy so I wouldn’t even get to use it. Other than that it sounds like a great perk
---
I find myself in the same situation lol
---
yeah and our point is we love him as he is. and you're being a big meany
---
Maybe instead of fixing generators, we have different arcade games we have to play and beat/clear a level or whatever.
---
I dont recall Michael having a healing factor but yeah he's definitely the biggest physical threat to Ash but he'd just be eating all of those shells until he gets close then Ash would just chainsaw him. Michael isn't really a strategist and just kind of goes for the kill.

You don't tank six shots, a needle to the neck, a knife to the sternum, and a coat hanger through the eye as well as a two storey drop without having some form of low level healing factor.
---
Michael is definitely a strategist, so I have to disagree with you there. He stalks people throughout the films until the opportunity arises to kill them quickly and efficiently. If anything, he'd be able to creep up on Ash.
---
You need help in the basement. After all the only source of light is the screaming souls of the people who lost hope, not really the best source of light they could pick. Really they need a lightbulb or something to help out if they don't have one already.
---
What's not to get?  
---
She's one of the most balanced killers in the game. You never know what you're gonna get with her, and that's fun in and of itself.  
---
Then there's her power, Vile (and Corrupt) Purge, which is fair and has multiple counters that rely on mechanical skill and thinking ahead, while rewarding the very same two things.
---
I know I am sure Death-Knight-9 loved having his name shown here...
---
It's marked as a shitpost for a reason, I wasn't being serious. If your a Wraith main for example, and a 12 year old aswell, your probably going go say that he's better than a Nurse (I have seen similar things). I am a Freddy main, because I find Freddy to be a fun killer to play as, and a fun killer to experiment with. But I'm not saying that he's better than Nurse, Billy, or even Doctor, but with good perks and add ons, very often, you can score a 4k.
---
Man thats sad long hair would give her a new look but I'm fine with her current hair styles even tho it screams "i WaNnA TaLk To yoUR MaNAgeR"
---
Ive always just took it as him just having inhuman pain tolerance tbh, plus at the end of some of the movies he does get taken into custody (some-fucking-how) so I'd assume he'd get medical treatment. But by stategist I mean like combat, Mike is definitely smart but he always just uses that brute strength to just demolish people, you never see Mike "throwing hands".
---
Doing gens,you?
---
Plus he makes a mean chi-oh wait.

---
I played killer for the first time yesterday and in my 2nd last game there was this one person who got the hatch and I don't think I ever saw him lol
---
Imagine saying DS is toxic
---
pretty much low and high rank toxicity while mid is pretty calm. That's why i'm stuck with toxic people, can't get to mid with my current skill.

Yeah I agree with most people here. This is so stupid.

I'm prepared and already have a SWF to play with in case we get a god killer who made a new account to bully newbies. We will destroy him/her with the power of gen rush builds.
---
Oink oink! Just rewatched Saw III yesterday so I tried to stay true to her original wound, but of course added more blood for the dead by daylight feel
---
Yep, definitely no chance this came after a game of SWF players doing this.
---
No chance AT ALL that they're players who only play in SWF together that I see all the time.
---
Definitely do not chat to most of the people that were involved in this cos the community is small and pretty tight knit in my area.

But hey, you pulling ideas out of your ass is law, so who am I to argue.

---
A similar bounce can be done on other autohaven maps that have the Truck tile, you hit the car that is to the side of the truck and you curve left, you can get upto the top of the truck's head.
---
Neither were the killer as she didn't had a chance to close it.
---
Map generation for this is pretty annoying to get, plus what billy uses both engravings in a public match?

I have to rewatch the earlier ones, it's an incredible franchise. I rewatched the latest ones as well as Jigsaw recently. 
---
I wonder if her character will have a part in the Chris Rock remake and if she'll be casted for it.
---
Awesome work though. Love the detail
---
barbecue, nurses calling, ruin and rancor
---
Have you SEEN Amanda out the costume!?
---
My little heart can hope
---
Around 2 3-4 hour sessions a week on average
---
Now, what a smart move of this clown to not close the hatch immediatelly.
---
Thanks for your advice, ima start doing this, I tend to do the gen that nearest to me when I spawn and sometimes I literally spawn right in front of a gen lol
---
Wait this is a actually a thing?
---
But if the hatch is opened, that means the last gen has been activated so THAT means that adrrnaline has already been used.... so if you down him after, he cant get back up because he already used adrenaline.
---
Ok. I respect your opinion, and with all due respect, it’s a stupid opinion. No powers on these killers? Spirit knows how to use a katana. Powers? Spirit can teleport  unseen.
---
I’ve done this with Michael So many times I’ve been reported a couple of times for it
---
Oh! Thatsa basebaurr
---
That amazing feeling...
---
True, but even if bit by bit, it would be a nice addition. The other comment in this post mentioned Devotion and Rank...maybe if you have enough playtime as a killer or something, you could get a power skin? So if you see a 5 blink nurse with the blink orbs and regular white flow, she's just your average tryhard. But when you see that 2 blink nurse with the little soul orbs, you know your ass is G R A S S.

I had a long game as Piggy and at the end there was a Kate and a Meg that was still alive. I really couldn’t find the Meg but the Kate was doing gens, so I chased the Kate. I downed her and because the game was very long, I gave her the hatch to be nice, but then I checked the locker next to the hatch and the Meg was hiding there
---
Trapper can be terrifyingly good. A Trapper that knows exactly how to place Traps can be unbeatable. But we all know that Freddy will get destroyed against a highrank swf group
---
but how can you even like being a killer without the top tier meta perks /s
---
But it's EZ though
---
Better for Freddy I guess. *shrug*
---
I feel keys would be better if the size was upped. Make it almost cartoonishly large so it's more visible.
---
Wanted: 3 more Bloody Party Streamers
---
Youd kill a baby Dwight!? You monster!
---
Perhaps change the aura of the hooked survivor to show they have deliverance ready? Make it from red to green or yellow, something obviously different to the normal hooked survivor aura.
---
Same! I am still working on mine, but it makes me feel happy when I help heal or sacrifice for someone.  I do try to also be the gen jockey, since still learning what exactly are jukes or how looping works. XD
---
Thank you very much! I’m going to be a sophomore in Art Education, so I do appreciate the compliment!
---
I find killer much easier than survivor. Survivor you need very precise timing to calculate whether you can do one more loop or whether you need to not be greedy and just drop the pallet. Killer is less about stuff like that and more about moving efficiently to cut people off, or being able to employ the occasional mindgame to cut the chase time down.
---
You are nice killer then. 
---
What is jerk? I do everything to survive, but i never taunt killer. Only if i try protect less experienced teammates.
---
Stop fingering the children
---
Worse when it’s devour hope
---
Well, actual RULES are as followed: Always Kill: Dwights, Bills, tryhard Neas, Baby Feng, Claudette and Jake, and Quentin depending on if my friend is using Vigil or not. Always let live: P3 Kate, GG Feng (full outfit), Quentin (depends on if my friend is using Vigil or not), and farming friendly bois who offer to sacrifice themselves.
---
Ik i have two people who are joining me for it once it's on gamepass. Probably gonna drop a bit due to it but i don't mind as long as us three together can have fun. We get put against a toxic legion running the most bs setup possible? We can still have fun seeing how long we can last(since we won't win against that with two new players)
---
no u
---
Self-care, Balanced Landing, Borrowed Time and DS.
---
A lot of people will say MOM, but that’s a crutch perk and it’s complete bs.
---
Selfcare so you don’t need teammates to heal, BL to help in a chase, BT to counter tunnel/camp or to help in late game and DS to counter tunneling
---
I could imagine that poor Philip wouldn't even fight back
---
Hello Daddy Myers, I want to play a game
---
Please god no oh god please no no no
---
He's gonna kobe
---
He’s definitely one of the weaker killers, but you can make him work if you play him a bit differently than the rest. 
---
Tunnelling and overcommitting to chases is the worst thing to do as Freddy. You want to constantly be juggling survivors; put them to sleep, let them go, then if you see another survivor waking them up get over there and sleep both of them. Sleep people who unhook near you, both unhooker and unhooked. Constantly sweep for survivors with your power and get them asleep. Since you’re invisible, get up on hills and buildings and look for signs of survivors on gens. Range add ons are great because you can sleep people from much further away. 
---
Don’t chase one person and leave the other three awake, you’ll just get rushed out of the match. Don’t camp, Freddy sucks at it. You also suck at totem defence so I wouldn’t recommend Hex perks. Use your ability to stall to your advantage. Keep survivors busy waking up and healing and pick them off one by one. Initiate a chase, get a hit, break a pallet, then move away and patrol gens. Your ability to stall out the match means you can clear all the pallets and become a much more effective chaser near the end game.
---
Is this considering a direct fight or just which Killers would pose the greatest threat to Ash?
---
Because Michael, Amanda, Legion, Trapper, Huntress, and Doctor could all pose a significant threat to Ash outside of a direct confrontation. 
---
Michael could kill him before he knew what was going on, Amanda would probably drug him and take him into a death trap sans his helpful saw hand or shotgun, Legion may just be 4 kids with knives but they could still creep into his house and stab him to death while he's sleeping, stepping in a bear trap would give Trapper a pretty good chance to kill Ash, Huntress' hatchets are more deadly at long range than a shotgun or chainsaw, and finally Doctor could sneak up on Ash by using his clones to mask his approach; once he gets within grabbing distance he could fry Ash from the inside out.
---
IMO Freddy should definitely be S-tier regardless; in the Remake he is 100% immortal and comes back perfectly fine (if not stronger) after being pulled into the real world and killed. Lore wise he's in the Entity's Realm because Quentin couldn't find any other possible way to keep him from hurting Nancy.
---
hey man i just tell people who i get tips from.
---
That looks like a basement build if I ever seen one
---
The greeeeeeed lmao
---
straight up fight. None of them really pose THAT big of threat to Ash considering he's delt with things much worse than all of them, execpt arguably Freddy but the Necronomican or the Kandarian Dagger would make short work of him.
---
She’s my main as well. I rotate these 2 builds- both are really great on her: 
---
BBQ, Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel, and Make Your Choice
---
BBQ, Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, and Nurse’s Calling
---
I’ve also recently been loving running the green charge time add-on (bloody hair brooch) with the green reappearance add-on (katana tsuba)
---
Hope this helps! Enjoy playing her, she’s so fun!
---
You will have 5 minutes to drink a glass of water so you stay hydrated. Or else you will be parched.
---
Why are there 2 claudettes?
---
*PLEASE NO*
---
Give nurse an S+ cause of how absurdly overpowered she is on PC and id agree.
---
I REALLY hope they don’t implement any PTW aspects into the game as I’ve already paid atleast 45-50 dollars on the game alone, plus most Licensed DLC. BHVR are practically begging for money at this rate.
---
However, looking at the free battle pass or whatever, the first page has a good outfit so if it DOES come out eventually atleast there are opportunities for people who do t have the money for paid cosmetics.
---
Keep in mind all three of those characters are undead and Spirit functions perfectly fine even though she's been dismembered. 
---
We don't know how, or even if, they can be killed.
---
"In a realistic fight"
---
I don't know, I'm pretty sure a chainsaw would do a pretty good job of ensuring that undead or not, they're not gonna be an issue.
---
I love how this post essentially says “using game mechanics to help you gain an advantage isn’t toxic” but then someone simply says the same thing but in regards to a killer perk and it gets downvoted. If you’re going to upvote a post saying “survivors using mechanics to gain an advantage” you also need to admit that a killer using game mechanics and tools given to them to gain an advantage isn’t toxic. Don’t be so obviously biased.
---
The hatch opened after the third survivor died after there was 3 gens left in the game, what are you not grasping?
---
Live or die, Daddy Myers, make your choice.
---
Why is this so accurate
---
No trust me I know.  I enjoy watching him and I’ve picked up a lot from him as well, but any time I see him mentioned someone always comments how shit he really is or how he’s a crybaby or whatever.

Boi, go read the recent patch notes

But mommy huntress :(
---
And 2 Quentin Masafucking Smith (intentional typo). idk, the website (tiermaker.com) had 2 Clauds ans Quentins, didn't notice
---
lmao, ive always wanted to see the behind the scenes for the voice over
---
**Dicc gets cut**
---
thats just people who get made at the fact he complains and says things are broken or OP.  i just watch for gameplay and opinions on certain things.
---
He didn’t even put anyone in the basement let alone hit them. They just left as soon as we loaded in.
---
Yep. The actor who played Freddy said that
---
&gt;"Wes wrote the most evil, corrupt thing he could think of. Originally, that meant Freddy was a child molester. Right while we were shooting the fist Nightmare, there was a huge scandal based around an area of single parent yuppies in California known as South Bay. Child molesters had descended on this unsupervised flotsam of seventies leftover Me-generation American children. On the spot we changed the script from child molester to child murderer, mainly so Wes wouldn't be accused of exploiting the South bay case."
---
I realise the game Freddy is based on the remake, but I try to pretend the remake doesn't exist.
---
I mean they didn’t even play. As soon as the game started they were gone.
---
ahem \*Clown\*
---
But but baby dwight
---
Idk, if Huntress shows some leg, David might do something else with that ass...
---
**Wraith should be A**
---
The other day I saw someone on here mention that they like tru3 and watching him because he’s a good player, then witnessed another person going out of his way shitting on tru3 and saying he’s better than him etc etc. lol
---
But but no
---
I mean if you are thinking like that. I have been playing since release and I've never looped once, took me 600 hours to get good at chases but now I'll go on a 2 minute chase on average using only 1-3 pallets, make sure to never stop moving and be really unpredictable, works best on Leyr'ys
---
What build do you run? I've been running Resilience, This Is Not Happening, SB, and Adrenaline. Works pretty good since i'm injured most of the game and can do gens and everything else way faster. SB lets me escape in a bad situation and Adrenaline heals me once the exits are powered and i can get out a bit easier due to the free hit.
---
Spirit is in C tier. S tier depending on how kinky you're willing to be. She has more holes than anyother killer.
---
In that case it might be one of those major bugs like the one that legion had right after EGC just came out. I was in game, and shortly after Legion slashed one person, it disconnected 3 people at once. Not intentional as my friend was in game with me and it was a legit disconnect. I reported the bug to the forums. Seems fixed now, but yea, you might have just encountered something like that.
---
idk pig is pretty fun to play against...
---
Bring No Ed, it really makes you feel good to put those toxic survivors in their place. If they complain just tell them any good team would cleanse all totems along the way of completing generators.
---
Seen a lot of nurses on xbox right now. There's a reason I'm rank 5 survivor and it's not because I'm that good.
---
Was yours 3 dcs at the same time?
---
How do you even get this bad of lag without a DC? i never get this kind of lag and i'm on console as well.
---
Hit us with the VOD bro.
---
&gt;I remember when they used to be pretty nuts but now, why would you ever bring one?
---
Yeah who else remembers when you could build a flashlight so fast at blinding that you could turn mid chase *tap* the action button and get a blind.
---
&gt;ou essentially have to stalk the killer to get the blind save which wastes a lot of time.
---
It's called balance? You waste time to rescue a friend or delay the killer.
---
&gt;In my opinion, they need a buff to either one of their current functions or add in an entirely new function but I currently have no idea on how to do this. I was wondering if anyone had any decent ideas to improve them.
---
No they don't, flashlights are probably one of if not THE most balanced aspect in theg ame. Powerful if used in the correct setting, weak if not.
---
While I don't know the full details of your situation, it sounds like that person was right. As much as doing gens is the objective of the game, just sitting around and doing nothing except generators is how you lose the game. You need to be trying to rescue your teammates and, more importantly, taking hits and hooks for them because if they're the ones that get hooked again, they're either near death or dead.
---
You have to make use of the fact that you haven't been hooked to take some hooks for your team and let *them* heal and do gens and rescue you. Otherwise your teammates die very quickly from constant rehooking and suddenly you're in a 1v1.
---
Omg, I’ve just been so mad, I haven’t thought about it, hold up, I think I remember his name
---
Logic and reason? Here? DOWNVOTE THIS MAN
---
Touché.
---
the claudette skull should be missing. she is so good at hiding that she is still hiding after her death
---
I was just reading through this argument but that idea of Michael dropping everything and racewalking away in the blink of an eye to pretend to teleport caught me off guard. In my imagination, there'd be a lot of accidental arm-flailing when he burst into action.
---
Claudettes I find are either a) really toxic and don't help at all or b) they try their best to help and actually do stuff
---
It definitely isn't toxic and is pretty much a survivor's first line of defense against killers in a chase. **However** if you teabag me on the other side you're a dead motherfucker and your ass is going on a damn hook. Fucking PS4 community is so damn toxic already it doesn't need one more person making it worse. I remember one of the first games I "won" (2 sacrifices and 2 DC's) I got hatemail from some jackass who called me a camper as they were all like 20 feet from the hook and not doing any of the generators.  Maybe it's just PS4 but half the time survivors are just really dumb and don't think to possibly do the objective to distract me instead of just waiting until I walk 10 feet away from the hook.
---
Nice to see people still remember the original Darn meme! Most people only remember/use the sequel meme with the deep fryed version.
---
*(In case anyone here don't know wtf I'm talking about; [the original](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/75rk1x/surprise/) and [the sequel](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/777p6i/spotlight/).)*
---
I find myself running it more as I find myself running into full SWF teams that all run toolboxes and gen rush like mad.  It kinda counters that as I get one or 2 people a lot of the time but I still get angry messages about it
---
yeah i know, i only realised that was there after i took the image then said fuck it, but i put the text
---
Had a Dwight hiding in a locker and wasn’t helping to get gens the whole game. Had the killer chase me and in their view, opened the locker only to get shooed away by the hiding character. Killer let me go and they grabbed the Dwight. Best moment of my DBD days.
---
OINK OINK Amanda=upvote
---
Then i think you need to go read up on the definition of a joke.
---
not to be rude or anything but....**The arm**
---
This could have a lot of potential, wow. For example, imagine powering all the gens and all the arcade games spark, go into overdrive or short out. God I wish I could work on maps
---
I swear she sounds like dwight when she cleanses
---
Crap
---
No u
---
ooo nice for all of it :)
---
Rank has some RNG to it.
---
If you play and 2 of your team auto DCs you will lose.
---
Unstoppable Piggy:  Spirit Fury, Enduring, Bamboozle and Fire Up.  
---
Oink oink!!!
---
Well,uhm,Yes,not good at that,fix that at some point,at least I hope I can
---
:0 how do i get the blue text next to my name?
---
Yup, I even happened to be recording at the time.
---
Here.
---
https://youtu.be/AiNlsy7vkuc
---
I was wondering if it is a thing when you sprint leave? It happens all the time but i haven't tested this
---
I feel no remorse after being camped and tunneled so much at that rank.
---
Miguel Muiers
---
I don’t think mine was a glitch then. The dcs happened one after another.
---
Are you a fucking child? does your mommy know you play this game.
---
Yes I am a child
---
thats actually an insane idea pogu
---
No problem! Graphic design student here, so I appreciate the dedication
---
Popular opinion: Looping &amp; Vaulting isn't toxic.
---
Unpopular hard to swallow opinion: Camping and Tunneling isn't toxic either.
---
Hyper-Ultra-Super-Hard to swallow opinion: NOED and Adrenaline aren't overpowered perks.
---
Try to swallow these pills.
---
Do you disagree? Well, then you are part of the problem.
---
Well one already had the game on xbox and the other one has seen videos and he felt like he really would like it, and so he does. He is a tad bit dissapointed that you have to pay for more killers/survivors tho
---
This is iconic.
---
Ok I'll take that into consideration, thank you
---
This applies when the game runs at 60 FPS. Then I become their worst nightmare
---
Wraith.
---
Wraith has the same skill cap as spirit and is just as viable.
---
I think the best tip is to stop caring about rank. Realizing that most of the time "gen rush" is a result of you not putting enough pressure on survivors will help, too.
---
Damn, I don't agree with a lot of this. For me it'd be more:
---
S: Huntress, Billy, Myers
---
A: Wraith, Spirit, Freddy, Nurse (with 2 blinks)
---
B: Legion, Pig
---
C: Hag, Plague
---
D: Doctor, Trapper, Plague, Nurse with 3 blinks
---
F: Nurse with 4-5 blinks
---
If you are already by the hook then by all means, get that poor boy who got pulled off, it’s the teams fault for performing such a dangerous unhook. But most killers run across the map to tunnel the person down like wtf.
---
And yea camping hurts them slightly more than it hurts you. So only patrol the hook if you don’t know where to check next. Imo ofc
---
Kinda funny how a killer could be minding their business and all of a sudden this
---
Yeah, he is god at that
---
Op misspelled Michael's name, and I made a joke about it, "Michael Myers", "Miguel Muiers", do you see the joke here?
---
It is caught up. Doesn't get all dlcs and has a big player base
---
Yeah that's my  vommy mommy right there.
---
decisive locker
---
In that situation you mori them after 2 hooks instead of after their first. If you want to be nice that is.
---
This is the quality content I come to reddit for.
---
If I know someone is by the hook waiting to get them off I'll give a quick patrol.  Most of the time I run off to do the usual gen patrol
---
Sono chino sadame
---
this intel is very valuable thank you pal
---
Yeah I did
---
Yeah, I might have pressed the issue a little to bit there, but the thing is my PC has stable FPS in DbD, more than my PS4 Pro gives. But skillchecks are worse for some unknown reason
---
I hate going against Freddy, Legion and Doctor and dislike going against Nurse cause she's exhausting.
---
Rest is whatever
---
np
---
&gt; Change #6331684  Changed store_tags  10: 4166 (Atmospheric) › 5711 (Team-Based)  11: 5711 (Team-Based) › 4166 (Atmospheric)
---
Nothing to see here
---
Do you want fuck a corpse with detached limbs? I don't. Don't get me wrong, like if she was intact she'd be with Myers, but not like this where she would probably fall apart in bed
---
It is incorrect. Pig should be higher.
---
Lmao, I played legion yesterday and I got a 4k.  His frenzy is much harder now since you cant miss. I was getting frustrated. I put some whispers on him and I did awesome with just basic R1 attacks. Lmao
---
Karma a bitch
---
decisive locker is an exhaustion perk right?
---
I thought that was Dr Phil for a second
---
I was being satirical but you guys are mad triggered. Even you. Who shit on your corn flakes?

People need to have thick skins Jeez you guys are crybabies...

BUT IF I  SEE ONE MORE CLAUD REPEATEDLY VAULTING PALLETS TO ANNOY ME, I AM GONNA FUCKING LOSE IT

I like it but don't know how well it fits the game

They use to be so few and far in between now it's at least 1 or 2 every time I play. I fear it's only gonna get worse lol.. gonna feel like pc
---
What has this sub fallen down to....
---
PIG SHOULD BE ON TOP YOU FUCK!
---
I wouldn’t insult Dwight in here,
---
that’s how you get hurt.
---
I'm glad you mentioned that.  Frankly, Hybridpanda's bitching about it doesn't carry a lot of weight since there are many killers with a power that doesn't count towards the hit.  Plus, you need to pick your spots to get hit so you don't use it immediately.
---
Its literally a bunch of bitching... like how much easier do you want killer to be?
---
If you escaped with any amount of charge, next trial you'll start with fully charged item.
---
God that original post is so heartbreaking
---
Can confirm
---
Aw man! You are the snipe god!
---
The Entity seemed sassier than usual this time.
---
Do I need to know how to spell someone’s name to know they’re an opportunist centrist dipshit?
---
She is, Myers just made himself his own tier, I couldn't stop and then he came out of the screen &amp; then things happened, so i let him keep the s tier as he ~~deserved it~~ made a valid argument
---
thats a myth, no where in her lore does it say she has the mind of a 6 year old. She wants to be a mother for entitys sake. Shes matured naturally as shes aged and any human would.
---
Every Claudette main ever
---
Thanks so much!
---
Take an Updoot!
---
What above commenter said, when you gain an item and use most of it, but not all of it and escape with said item, it will be back to full charge when you succeed in escaping. What I like to do (especially because I am a loot whore) is use my good toolboxes/medkits till the very, very last bit and try to escape successfully.
---
Pls tell me this guy had a key! I would laugh the hell out of me if he had one.
---
How would he fuck up a ghost with a katana lmao if she was alive yeah bc she was a normal girl but as The Spirit? Not likely my dude
---
Cringe
---
No shit, Sherlock
---
It's a dumb perk that only strengthens the gap between the top tiers and the bottom tiers. 
---
It's an unhealthy perk for the game.
---
For such a strong effect to have no downsides if you just 99 healing is really dumb.
---
I got plag to p3 50 without getting it once. I was getting all perks on her and it showed up as the 8th last. Feelsbad.
---
There's a pic of her without the mask somewhere?
---
Unnerving Presence?
---
Strode house disagrees.
---
It's not toxic. It's shit. I'm saying they deserve it for being bad.
---
lmfao
---
Sprint Burst is shit too
---
Mfw hag isnt in S tier
---
It's shit. Only stealth players think it's good, and stealth players are shit.
---
Just keep in mind that prestige takes all your items away. I also was a loot hoarder, and had to play dozens of games to get all my red/green/purple stuff out there before resetting my claudette. 
---
So i guess my point is don't be afraid to use your stuff, you'll get plenty as you level up that bloodweb.
---
End game collapse was added a few weeks(?) ago so now when the last gen is done (or killer closes hatch) there’s a timer for the survivors to open exit gates and escape or else they get insta death by entity. This person camped hatch and it opened too late so it looks like the entity came out of the hatch.
---
This sub is extremely survivor biased
---
Sprint Burst, Urban Evasion, Premonition, Bond. Just anything that really indicates a survivor is a stealth gamer who doesn't know what they're doing and will likely go down in 3 seconds flat in a chase.
---
I'm making this build when I get the chance. Thank you.
---
Gotcha. Thanks
---
Tbh if they were all there you could just smacked em all
---
Everyone: David is the tallest survivor
---
Adam: Hold my pebble
---
"Tryhard" Such a valid insult, So sorry that I'm not just playing with my feet.
---
Yes,check out Skemoo,he has amazing renders
---
https://youtu.be/cHlScT5KfuE
---
We stan Vommy Mommy!
---
Facts. Plague could get it man. I love my tall ass fuckin amazonian style woman and this bitch is Babylonian like bruhh middle eastern chicks are HOT. Vommy mommy could give me sloppy toppy until I fertilise her hanging gardens if you get what I mean. Plague A tier at least.
---
Same for camping really
---
Yeah he's implying she should be higher lmao
---
I wanna know what demon did the Huntress
---
On PS4 maybe, but not on PC. On my PC it'e every skillcheck every game until I lower down the settings. Though I was googling the issue, and maybe it's related to my notebook overheating, should dig on that further.
---
I got down to survivor rank 6 recently and just noped out, since solely playing against people who DC after a single hit (not even a hook), and playing solely against Nurse, Hillbilly, and Huntress killers is gonna be a no for me. I'll just step back to rank 10 and enjoy the game a bit more. Anything further ahead or further behind feels like a curse.
---
Everyone who's played killer since the game came out said it's much easier to be killer now.  Idk what you're talking about..
---
But to bitch about keys and hatch grabbing is dumb.
---
Have a ranking system that isn't complete shit?
---
"i'M gOInG To fAceCaMP hiM DudE"
---
I don't see Ghostface. (yes I know he's not out yet) but he'd definitely kick David's ass
---
A couple tips for you:
---
First, “Plunderer’s Instinct” is a great perk for getting items as it gives a much better chance at good items from them and also allows you to see the head of chests.  This is good for starting out to collect a few things when you don’t already have good perks for your survivors since it’s one you can get on any character with no prerequisites.
---
Second, I would save your Medkits for self healing because it’s much faster than self care and allows you to heal yourself without it.  Also, unless you have a rather high level medkit or have certain add ons to it, the heal speed isn’t that much faster than the base when healing allies.
---
Gonna be running my usual Red Meg with Resilience, SB, TISN, and Adren. Good luck if i can get Deliverence in time since i won't even need Adren. It's purely for the heal at endgame.
---
give me 2seconds. Making a Pig post now.
---
i play on ps4 and i rarely run into toxic survivorsmost of the time people are pretty well mannered although i do run into people who teabag fairly often
---
Do you mean ability skins?
---
Plague is too high IMO. She is just a 115 killer if they don't cleanse. It's like staying injured so Legion doesn't have much of a power. Corrupt is good, but good survivors won't let you get it.
---
Clown is also a bit high. His power does help in a chase, but it mainly serves to force pallet drops, something other killers can do as well.
---
Spirit isn't top 3. She's good, but not absolutely amazing unless you run specific add-ons. I'm NOT saying she's bad, just that she's not top. 
---
Why is Freddy so low? He is a slept on killer (pun intended). He has the best built in stall, tracking, and stealth in the game, AND has an okay chase with mind game potential only surpassed by Spirit. He is legit one of the four high to mid-high killers along with Spirit, Michael, and Huntress. Once he finds you, he isn't easy to lose and WILL drag the game out.
---
The more the merrier!
---
Nah dude, you definitely don't know what looping is
---
Just have it slightly swing whenever someone enters the basement so it can be that little bit creepier. Just a very slight swing and a few drops of blood on it would make it amazing.
---
Yay!
---
I'll keep that in mind, thanks!
---
MMM it's true-
---
It makes perfect sense. Chaotic evil even gives me ptsd, damn megHead mains..

I didn’t get Enduring on my last killer until I funneled like 5 mil BPs into him. You can get lucky or unlucky. With this many perks in the game, I think it needs to be redesigned because it’s a horrible RNG fest right now. Nothing more irritating than funneling 1 mil BPs into your killer to not get a single useful perk.
---
Lawful Good: An offering that is the max display of niceness by giving everyone BP, including the Killer
---
Lawful Neutral: It follows the Rules of Totem Spawns and nothing more (Lawful), giving a fuck about who he helps; one day you can get him in the best of places, and at the next game just have it in middle of nowhere and being cleanse while youre in the loading screen (Neutral)
---
Lawful Evil: Ebony Mori is just shit and shouldnt really be in the game (Evil), but it is, and as such, you can use it (Lawful)
---
Neutral Good: He is usually a nice guy and player (Good) and plays both sides regulary (Neutral)
---
Chaotic Good: He sometimes acts like a fucking real life meme (Chaotic) but has good intentions with his game (Good)
---
True Neutral: BP's dont give a fuck about how you play and what you play, is just the currency. Totally Neutral
---
Chaotic Neutral: Most of people, including me, are hyped about this 3-Years Anniversary and the announcements they're gonna make, but at the same time, we are all confused and dont know what to expect, it could be great, or it could be trash (Wich is a very Chaotic thing, and as it could go either way, Neutral)
---
Neutral Evil: Lag and Disconects affect everybody, is no fun to play agaisnt DC's, and is certainly not Legal as the game isnt prepared for that
---
Chaotic Evil: Trash people, just, that.
---
Seems like Make Your Choice would be really strong on nurse too, but I've only seen a handful of people run it with her.
---
Very unlikely.
---
I can’t say with any degree of certainty, but I’d assume it’s because they already have a lot of mods from those time zones, but not from others. So, having people from a other timezones would make moderating the sub much easier during nighttime in the USA.
---
Damn. Was hoping for a PTB miracle today, but it doesn't seem likely then.
---
0/10 meme. Not providing source of the ahegao face.
---
 Replace meg with an immersed p-3 Claudette which you can’t find and I’ll agree with you 100%
---
Once the hatches close, you're chances of escape are supposed to be low, because others said, your team failed. It's meant to be a hail mary akin to attempting to struggle off the hook.
---
I've seen this bug a few times as a survivor too. Though I don't know if it was just with Freddy. Everyone had their default clothing items.
---
How can you be a try hard in the game? Like you're either trying to kill them or not
---
What? I do not even downvote anyone here. Lol.
---
Nope
---
Full context I didn't camp him at all, his friend just went for unhooks at the dumbest times. So I was like 10 feet away so I just chased down the wounded guy because I had no idea where the guy who unhooked him went. Happened one more time before the guy and his friend DC'ed, noob killer too strong for them I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
What about bloody David
---
I think she is balanced too. But I hope to make her more even more all rounded. :)
---
yes
---
Not any time soon, I think. IIRC, devs wanted to look at Nurse after Freddy rework. And with new chapters and other stuff it'll take quite a lot of time.
---
If all 4 survivors ganged up on the killer and used things around the map (e.g hilt of a flashlight or things tipped off cars) then they’d kick any killer’s arse
---
its meant to represent all trash survivors, imagine wich one bothers you the most :3
---
The mod staff is currently taking applications. If you have the time, feel free to apply and see if you'll be able to contribute to cleaning this place up.
---
This is where you want to look for upcoming changes: https://steamdb.info/app/381210/depots/
---
Glad to see some people gets it :'3
---
Why you gotta bully me like that haha
---
Yes???
---
Might wanna read end game collapse a little closer lol.
---
Stop my pc is lagging
---
Really, just don't worry about rank...if you got the achievement what's the point? Play how you always wanted to. Make meme builds, try out new builds, hoard blood points. I stop having fun when I try to win at all costs. Sometimes it's fun to just rp as the killer you're playing too. One time I made a 4head Meg's night by sparing her as the Trapper because she "shipped it"..........(ew) but lols.
---
When it comes I want an entire Pig rework, power and everything.
---
Sure if you want your meme to not make any sense by all means use it however you want, but just because you have the ability to put whatever you want in your meme isn’t gonna make it make any sense.
---
How can you say spirit is not top 3? If you know what you're doing with her and there are no stupid sound glitches which there has been lately. You can end chases more quickly than any other killer except nurse. And the fact you can grab survivors off the gens even without the addon is game changing.
---
Because a meme is taking something based in reality and giving it a comedic twist. You fabricated a straw-man argument that no one makes and tried to apply humor to it.
---
My tier list would probably be Trapper and Hag on F tier, every other killer on S.
---
Maybe Leatherface on D tier.
---
Claudette, switching to toxic nea the next game: you will
---
I think they just mean that ghostface would play well on this map with all the corners and such, not that it should come out with him
---
There were stats released a while ago that showed him as getting the most kills at rank 20, but the third least (after Wraith and Hag, before their buffs) at rank 1.
---
It's easy to wake up, and the delay before he can hit a survivor is brutal.
---
She probably hopped out walked around for a little bit then hopped back in
---
He struggled to even get one kill, and in a very embarrassing way...don't know why you'd be mad. I'd just laugh.
---
So would something like overcharge actually be Beneficial because of the bonus regression or not because it’s still just better for them to not get a check?
---
ITT : Dozen of comments in a heated debate about the fuckability of a selection of rotten corpses. (lookin' at you Spirit and Plague fans)
---
I knew someone would say it
---
Dude, I know when I see a snipe god, its not just predicting where the surv is, you also knew the bullet drop of the hatchets!
---
The fall reduction always works even if exhausted. The exhaustion only affects the speedburst.
---
No, actually I was opening it and left it on 99% and was going to let nea open it but then changed my mind and wanted to finish opening but could not anymore.
---
Bell - Allows Wraith-like invisibility for 12 seconds. Plays quiet, tinkling sound. Cloaks almost instantly
---
Trap - Placeable beartrap to catch the killer in loops, could be picked back up, but break after catching the killer twice.
---
Pillowcase - Allowing 6 Nurse-style blinks over short distance
---
The stagger reduction is not affected by exhaustion so feel free to jump off of rocks ledges etc and not worry about it.
---
I didn't think that was enough, sometimes I get crows just from walking for long periods of time, so I wondered how she managed to avoid them.
---
Thank you
---
I can’t speak for everyone but I get toxicity all the time at white and green ranks, purples really the only area where there isn’t a camping NOED gamer every game
---
~~and has NOED Been buffed recently? For the past 30 games I’ve been hit or almost hit with a NOED~~
---
Legion can definitely entertain some "edgy" 10 to 14 year olds
---
 they're miserable people who wanna take the fun of the game... people who face camp and tunnel every match take the fun out it.
---
This is one of the more accurate ones I've seen. Trapper should be B tier, as he gets pretty high kills across all ranks.
---
Oh, no. I would definitely not moderate an online community, that is too much time and effort haha, but I'm sure there's plenty who honestly would be willing to moderate it.
---
That makes sense I was kinda doing that one game but I was starting to get really impatient. I’m much more suited for wraith and his maximum ZOOM power
---
May I ask what the point would be?  To fight off the killers?  Because I don’t think that would fit the game at all honestly.
---
Yeah ok dude
---
Sauce?
---
This has been one of the most controversial posts I've seen on this subreddit, I love this community
---
Pure poetry.
---
How do you do it on PC? I'm starting to think I should learn.
---
Good thing I'm a killer main, gonna get all the adept achievements I missed ( :
---
To change the gameplay up. I see it as similar to some Killer's iridescent addons, which can totally change the playstyle. The OPness of the addons is balanced by rarity
---
I only play on console my man
---
This might be the shittiest shitpost I've seen on this sub.
---
She’s only incorporeal when she teleports
---
The angry grunts? They're so hot
---
People sprinting away from failed gens has helped more times than I can count. If you stay on it and the killers close, he just goofs off and follows the scratch marks.
---
No nurse.
---
Google
---
I wouldn’t say hot lol but I like the long frustrated one the most
---
Yeah taking 32 seconds to heal is so fair... 
---
Mori hook and proxycamp/tunnel that's what everyone does who runs ebony..  
---
How often do you get a 4 solo team that works super well together?? Not often.. 
---
Oh you forgot Billy, nurse and spirit!
---
I used to love running Bond, Leader, Prove Thyself, and We'll Make it as a teamwork build, before they nerfed leader not to affect gens.
---
I kinda like that they don't talk.
---
But they are far too strong, you could bully killer to dc with 4 of this.
---
Pillow
---
Nah I what I meant was that I don't want to die on my first hook and not to depend to others for heals and shit. I don't mind dying but I just don't want to die on the first hook.
---
What are you talking about?
---
Thanks for the suggestions guys. I’ve been focusing on pressuring gens more and haven’t glanced at my rank since. I always get a little more competitive over my killer rank but I know it doesn’t matter.
---
Never heard about the vaulting part either but yes, there are posts about how "toxic" looping is on a daily basis.
---
Thank you!
---
How bout deliverance instead of adrenaline?
---
I feel that way about a lot of the killer addons... I'm like whats the point of half of them. Especially brown ones.
---
Had this happen to me the other day, except the hatch spawned right in front of me as soon as the killer ran off lol
---
I think some survivors think they’re entitled to winning.. It’s annoying. Imo it’s his fault for stopping and running back to get the flashlight, not going straight through the exit. Foolish move on his part.
---
True, the stats would probably need to be lower or have some sort of penalty for using them
---
What about Freddy
---
One day you dumbass survivors will learn not to be greedy
---
what about claudette when she gets picked up? sure, you could think of it as panic, but if that isn't the most hentai-manga-iest 'a-ahh' porn noise i've ever heard in my 42315 years of existence
---
Lately I've been messing around with We'll Make It and Solidarity. If I'm injured and unhook someone, I heal them in 8 seconds. That gives me half a heal so they can heal me in 8 seconds as well. That's only 16 seconds for two full heals. Not too shabby.
---
Lucky just yesterday I rand into a half a dozen people who dc’d over only a few games. Fast boi build wraith isn’t toxic itself right?
---
It would definetly work for some characters, but others?
---
You get to heal yourself with no limit, for the entire game. It should be longer. Name all these “nerfs” and I’ll tell you why they’ve been fair. 
---
Uhh. High ranks usually have 2/3 optimal players. 
---
And no, I didn’t forget Billy. I said good survivors. Good survivors know how to make Billy M1.
---
Fun facts, As a killer main I find purple and red ranks more boosted than Green ranks. My point here is rank means fuck all in this game and anyone thinking otherwise are quite new to the game themselves
---
that sounds really cool, dark, weird lights and lots of distracting noise
---
Which happens a lot.
---
He should not have dropped the flashlight if he wanted to keep it, leaving in exchange for a flashlight is a very good deal.
---
how dare you steal what i was about to say?
---
That one doesn’t look to bad.
---
At least give us it for Bill. I wanna hear him say “Bull Frickin Horse Shit” in game.
---
Honestly!
---
Getting looped? A survivors job is to...not die. Don't get mad at them for keeping you busy. Leave and patrol gens.
---
Getting camped/tunneled? Sucks but it can be punished with your team rushing gens and leaving so the killer doesn't pip. 9 times out of 10 your team trying to make saves turns a 1k into a 4k.
---
Don't get me started on perks. Yes, some perks on both sides can be 'annoying' but they're not toxic. Neither are flashlights and insta-heals. Deal with it.
---
Yeah, sure! It happened on PS4 in Red Forest (the old one, not the new Plague Map)
---
I hope ur mama hag has to teleport away i hate her
---
yeah pretty much nothing is toxic
---
Thats why its fun to play legion and watch the immersed players dc
---
damn boi she thicc
---
rrrlllrllrRRRRRLRRLRLNNNLRL
---
-implied rape scene intensifies-
---
The map name wasn't on my screen either^
---
They feel entitled to winning cause they’re playing survivor.
---
Who cares? If someone starts tbagging my goal switches from try to win the game to kill them. It's a consolation prize to the other survivors that weren't toxic that they get more points escaping.
---
&gt;in the third one, won an award
---
Drayton made the chili in both 1 and 2, can't say about 3 or TNG. Also, Drayton won the chili award in TCM 2.
---
I'd be on board with a negative BP result upon DCing, like -5000 (the opposite of escaping).  
---
Might help promote staying in the match if you actually stood to lose something.
---
I mean I dont run selfishcare.  But I hate when my teammates do, they waste so much time... 
---
Could you imagine using a perk as a killer that took you 32 seconds to use!? 
---
Nah Billy is broken af. He has no cooldowns, insta downs, can zip across the map. Seriously like evey streamer says Billy is broken.
---
Exactly. When you know the last survivor or the whole team is waiting right by the hook for you to leave you aren’t going to leave. Call it camping or whatever but they personally made that choice.
---
I never said she was bad. She's not. But I think Nurse, Hillbilly, and Hag are all better. 
---
Nurse: Self explanatory
---
Hillbilly: More mobile and an Insta down. Plus Spirit's equivalent, the grab, is hard to get without her beads.
---
Hag: Better defense of points. Both end chases quickly and have good mobility, but since Hag has that one advantage, she gets placed higher.
---
Spirit is NOT bad, in fact she's quite good, but isn't top 3, close, but not quite there.
---
I don't think they will add bp to the battle pass, and if they do... i think they'll leave it on the free battle pass course. I just want cosmetics....
---
The bell should be really loud
---
When you've always been rank 1 and only know the toxic side
---
Open the gate, t-bag as Kate and see...killer had blood warden, and you get no sympathy emblem.
---
Why would I need a perk to heal me as killer...
---
Ah. So your opinion of Billy being broken comes from the streamers you watch rather than your own opinion. Nice. Sorry you watch bad streamers. 
---
Loop Billy = Billy is a normal M1
---
YOU ARE DEAD TO ME
---
Wait, Freddy’s release was leaked too? I wasn’t there for that so I wasn’t aware. Has the dev team ever not leaked a licensed killer/survivor? They seem to have developed a bad track record.
---
If your killer isnt hillbilly, spirit or nurse then your gonna suffer against good swf groups.
---
Well, she's in serious pain and probably scared but some of the sounds in this game, like on Jane oddly sound like they're enjoying it lol
---
He was trying to trick you. Don't worry too much about it
---
Feng does a weird hentai grunt when she gets picked up too
---
have you heard it tho
---
you don't seem to understand tho
---
That average would improve if you looped.
---
never let the farmy bois live. Kill everyone equally, unless you're feeling nice.
---
The stagger is permanently affected. Exhaustion only comes into play when calculating if you get the sprint burst on landing
---
a drawback for each of them would be good  
---
so for bell, maybe you're hit-able and your breathing is much louder (ala old school snorting wraith)  
---
for the trap, make the setting time longer (I'm thinking 7-10 seconds, because I doubt any of the survivors are as strong as the trapper), and you can also step in your own trap  
---
and pillowcase would probably need to be "channeled" but you're slow while it's channeling (1-2 seconds of slow)
---
I feel the high rank is more toxic, but low ranks aren’t skilled enough to be toxic, because they are just trying to copy you tubers like ochido and noob3
---
How is doctor B and C teir all his power does is find people. And his add ons are pretty bad when you compare them to other killers
---
Just wondering how a pillowcase allows survivors to blink 6 times, or was it just a random idea?
---
"What the hell are you doing, Francis?"
---
"Don't be an ass Francis."
---
"You're an idiot!"
---
[Laughter]
---
The messages continued and he basically said he was going to drop it again (how would I know that) and that I should have shook my head no to him.
---
He followed that up immediately to let me know how hard he had worked to get that flashlight. Suddenly doesn't sound like you were going to drop it again...
---
I mean it's not like killers don't bully Surviviors to begin with lol
---
I'm currently running self care, spine chill, quick and quiet, and boil over. Going to eventually switch out boil over for something else but otherwise love the build!
---
She could vomit on my kitty cat no problem, I'll take that extra lubrication.
---
*Michael just stares into the crowd*
---
What are you talking about?! This was the least toxic message imaginable. Also if you play like a dick in games anyway, you should expect messages...ones far worse than this.
---
Doesn't he, canonically, have blonde hair?
---
Having to buy survivers/killers for their meta perks is already a P2W
---
And cleansing totems. Actually all of them sound weird doing that...
---
9 I think is the best I've done and I've been quite comfy at that rank
---
I don't think they will, they are apart of the handful of skins unavailable for shards.
---
Pretty sure event = get it for free during event - if you fail you have to pay up. 
---
It sucks but that's that i guess.
---
Hmm not really sure if I can remember, I do have played as Claudette and killed many but I haven't actually paid attention to her moans in particular. Sounds somewhat normal to me.
---
Learn to play one of the top killers (spirit hillbilly nurse or huntress) and then you will have no problem getting kills
---
Mine wasn't through objects like in the video, but I am 100% certain that range is too far to get hit by M1 even if he lunged.
---
Chaotic evil shoulda been ochido
---
Billy and Hag has guaranteed counterplay, Spirit is more of a gamble as a survivor.
---
Billy can be looped and certain loops are extremely hard to pull off a chainsaw curve at without speed and charge time addons. Good survivors capitalizes on this the first chance they get and it can be so frustrating sometimes.
---
Hag is vulnerable to ppl chrouching and ppl with flashlight, rendering her traps usless. Like myself, i like to remeber the areas she focus her traps on and wait for someone getting in a chase with her so i can pop 4+ of her traps, forcing her to either give up her current chase and start a new one or let those traps go to waste and re- trap later.
---
Doctah is way too biggTM. David has met his match.
---
This, I got more Gg messages then salt. 
---
😢
---
But Dwight is cute....why?:(
---
Ok, can you link the vid or show pics or something?
---
I absolutely could not figure out why you were pointing at me the whole time
---
I don't know, something about how German is a very gutteral and harsh language makes it feel even scarier having a merciless killer chasing you.
---
That was satisfying to watch. Fuck tbagging survivors 😜😎
---
Isn't this a genuine compliment...?
---
It will happen with random no matter what perks you will use
---
puppet lowkey lookin like a snack
---
What happened there is a connection issue. You briefly lost connection to the killer (or the killer briefly lost connection to everyone else). To them, you just appeared to be sprinting right into the fence after vaulting the window. This is something that shouldn't happen as much with dedicated servers. If the connection issue is on your end, it might still happen, but if the killer loses connection with dedicated servers, you'll still be able to move around freely.
---
Vaulting, no, but looping is absolutely the most toxic behavior in the game.
---
What about the Shrine? Technically you don’t need to spend any actual money if the perk comes up in the shrine.
---
lowest ive gotten is like rank 5
---
How do those people who DC after the first hit even get to high ranks? If this is not a proof that magic exists then I don't know what is.
---
Anecdotally, I think the bloodwebs up to level 50 have considerably more rare stuff on P3, but after that it's comparable to post-level 50 bloodwebs when you're not P3. So maybe OP did notice a difference within his first 25 levels.
---
I don't have stats to back that up, though.
---
This makes me want maps inspired by all the survivors..
---
Clearly you should have just let them catch you and not waste his time by looping and mind games. You are clearly at fault for then sopending so much time on you /s
---
I really like MoM, Dead Hard, Urban Evasion, Adrenaline.
---
Or if I’m feeling extra frisky, MoM, DS, Deliverance, Adrenaline.
---
Some people get very frustrated when things don't easily go their way, because being frustrated with the other person is generally easier than examining their own missteps. I know I've been guilty of it, I have friends who've been guilty of it, it's not an unnatural response, it's just unfortunately not the best response.
---
I don’t like playing against doctor, not that he’s difficult, but having to start a channel every five seconds to do something is pretty damn annoying
---
It is, Part 2
---
Holy crap. This honestly looks like something I could equip to my RuneScape character. Pass it over!
---
I want them to focus more on the Pigs crouch, maybe shift some more power Into her crouch. 
---
And I'm praying they don't Freddy the Nurse
---
Hexy bitches about a lot, runs noed, and ebony moris quite often. You hate noed, and ebony moris, but you choose to listen to him when it fits your narrative. Tragic. 
---
But you’re right. He’s more knowledgeable than me despite him just coming back to the game after a two month hiatus. If I’m not mistaken he has Freddy as much higher than a lot of other killers in his official tier list. Hmmm.  
---
I’m just gonna chalk it up to you being incredibly biased. You want survivors to have their old power of being able to obliterate killers with ease. Either that, or you aren’t actually good at the game and can’t play against Billy well. 
---
Imagine thinking survivor perks need to be as strong as Killer perks.  
---
You have a good day now.
---
M e g a n
---
I did get called toxic by two of those dc’ers fro pretending to walk away after a hook and coming back you catch the meg that has been unhooking people right behind me the whole game. Apparently according the the Meg and the hookee that’s “facecamping”
---
But shouldn't it be that his hit wouldn't register on my "ghost"? It seems extremely unfair that the whole game I'm not lagging, then suddenly this happens, and I'm supposed to believe we lost connection for that long. What if someone unplugged his wifi for 2 seconds while I vault a window? Does that mean he gets a free hit on my "ghost"?
---
He is the top survivor
---
You take the light, I take your life
---
Ironically in my swf groups the ppl in the exit gates are always trying to go back for the save and the person on the hook has to tell them to leave and save themselves
---
To be fair, those people didn’t choose to be unhooked when the killer is nearby. (Unless I’m confused)
---
I hate it when people unhook me with a killer nearby. I get even more annoyed when the killer rewards that behaviour by downing me and letting the other guy go. 
---
As I’m getting punished for someone else’s mistake. 
---
And when it happens once, it happens twice.
---
r/jesuschristreddit
---
Yeah, same, tbh I'm frustrated, even tho I did have a chance to make it out, I fucked up, I admit it
---
self care and adrenaline is all a badass needs B)
---
but for real i have the same build as u, probably the best one imo
---
__Thanks, I hate it.__
---
I'm more pissed that 30-50 people enjoy his content
---
Alright now let's do another take, without the "*harder, daddy*"
---
Lol, true, my bad
---
Yeah, it was definitely his fault.
---
I'm a survivor main through &amp; through, and though there's ways I might play a situation differently as killer, *no killer owes me anything.* Ideally, they'd play what I consider "fair" (no camping, no tunneling off hook, no Mori spam,) but they do not owe me a free survival for any reason.
---
did he say that? I didnt have time to listen to the vod
---
Yeah I know, I just needed to vent, I'm more angry that people like his content where he does this, like if he was just a player, I wouldnt care
---
The tum tums special
---
yea i have no issues with that.   vaulting looping all that.  go for it thats what you're supposed to do
---
i struggle mightily against people who do those quick turns and whatnot. especialy anyone wearing brown that blends with all maps.   i'd rather people loop me all game  than deal with these guys and their 180 turns and whatever else.
---
i usually dont chase someone for long, usually gens are being done.
---
Yes, spine chill and lightweight are really underrated.
---
He does those builds for the laughs... I hate watching him play a dick head killer but his commentry is the best..  he takes all criticism and that's what I like hes not a bitch boy like pug who bans anyone who goes against what he thinks.
---
That makes me happier
---
Some people are probably better with the bag over their head
---
Hate survivors who just stand at the exit gate. Look for noed. If no noed heal up and look if you can block or tank a hit. Be usefull, not useless.
---
THATS WHAT THAT IS?!?!?
---
You started it?
---
And once again you managed to fuck up a sentence with only 7 words in it. Congratulations.
---
I drew this for all my lesbian sisters out there lost in the fog.
---
Why lithe over balanced landing or dead hard? I barely see people using it
---
Ahhhh, scaroused, ~~my favourite~~ what a strange way to feel
---
Right now, the game is peer to peer, meaning one of the players in the lobby is the host and everyone else connects to them (typically the killer, unless you're playing KYF). This means if you lose connection to the killer or they lose connection to you, you'll appear to continue running in a straight line on the killer's screen. Since they are the host and all hit detection is handled on the killer's screen, they're still able to hit you.
---
This is something that may change with dedicated servers. If the killer is the one that lost connection, they would be stuck in place instead of you.
---
Oh look you posted the same thing for the 100th time
---
I have two favorite builds:
---
1) lithe, quick and quiet, dance with me, and adrenaline. (Id swap adrenaline with lightweight but adrenaline is literally too good)
---
2) Autodidact, empathy, spine chill, adrenaline (got this one from monto).
---
I was using self care for a while in that build but switched it out, because I seem to miss pallets very often. My character starts healing himself instead of throwing it down, even if I tap it. I look like a potato in rank 4 when this happens lol
---
Really sounds like a temper tantrum wich fits the huntress perfectly.
---
lol, thanks
---
I tried you first build a few weeks ago, but as I don’t have dance with me it sucks for that hoodini effect ;)
---
Wow, their report system sounds really bad then. Thanks for answering
---
To be fair, that was patches ago, and he was playing Hag with nothing but Unrelenting 1.
---
Okay, thank you for the answer
---
Lmao that's never happened to me do u camp pallets or ur already healing there and the killer gets the jump on u? If ur running that should never happen
---
I think she is not that bad. She either forces you to cleanse to be not 1-hit and get her OP Puke, or you dont cleanse but you're basically exposed the whole game.
---
I thought it was a regular instaheal SWF team until I saw Jake speed burst mid jog away from your chainsaw. Also the sheer number of instaheals... there's no way they got lucky enough with the RNG from chests to get that many and to have them perfectly tucked away in various parts of the map to facilitate this.
---
Alright, thanks for the answer
---
This was horrible a month or so ago when you had to let go off the gen at 99% to even get your Objective bloodpoints. 99%, release M1, instant skillcheck, gen goes back down and you don't get to finish it again before Billy zooms at you at sanic speed.
---
There were literally games that were lost because of the Objective points bug and survivors releasing at 99%.
---
Yeah dance with me is really nice with it. Of course it doesn’t always work and once the killer realizes you have quick and quiet it’s not as effective but I love running off and looking back watching the killer looking for me back at that window.
---
That's a weird reason to report someone lol. Thanks for answering
---
I'd die a happy man
---
Yeah, that makes a lotta sense.
---
While running, that’s the weird part. I’m on PS4, dunno if it makes a difference, but it’s really annoying 😂
---
Yeah, but more often than not, it's two downs instead of just trading. It sucks for the survivor, but it'd be stupid and even more detrimental for the killer. I play solo survivor the most, trust me, I know how braindead people are. But as long as the game keeps its current designs, there is no reason for a killer not to do that.
---
yeah that would be terrifying XD
---
You clearly haven’t been part of this community for long if you believe that.
---
Nah dude I think the next killer is going to be herobrine and the survivor steve from minecraft.
---
Hmm. A Public test branch was updated 20 minutes ago though.
---
You say that as if speaking from experience
---
There are definitely times when the killer faces the choice of winning like an asshole or winning not like an asshole, and when they choose the asshole route I think it can be appropriate to call them tryhard.
---
Granted what OP is describing is not one of those times.
---
Anna doesn't discriminate and will axe you all day.
---
Closing the hatch as a killer completes the generators and powers the gates. So that triggers the adrenaline perk.
---
Yea, nothing’s more satisfying than seeing a confused killer.
---
some discussions I have with survivors are just crazy :D
---
I thought the new killer was james charles.
---
Her lore is that she choked everyone in the asylum, then killed herself by tying it round her head.
---
Liquid meme.
---
Venom meme.
---
Nah, thanks for the compliment man &lt;3
---
They don’t even ban for lag switching which sucks so bad
---
That’s a lot of teachable perks I don’t actually have anyone prestiged yet cause I have a horrible habit in all games with multiple characters where is spread my playtime cause I get too bored of just one
---
No what you need to do is wait for ghostface see if hes purchasable with shards and if not then buy spirit. (most likely ghostface will not be purchasble with it because hes a licensed killer but still worth a try).
---
Alright. I felt like that was the right one but wasn’t sure if he was a pretty lady before or after that scene.
---
A W  S H U C K S
---
i review this review as 10/10
---
B-e-a-utiful
---
That's fair, I get that. As a mod &amp; friend of a different streamer who sometimes does the same thing, it's not that I enjoy when he's doing that, it's just that I know what he's like when he's NOT doing that, if that makes sense? I've told him that it's awkward for me and probably for other people in chat when he gets angry, and he KNOWS while he's angry that it's not helping anything, and yet, being human fails us all.
---
Then good luck catching this tbagging meg booty!
---
True
---
I love that fight he has with the punk girl in dream warriors.
---
that is a lot of years ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Dodging hits and looping may be a little harder on Xbox because of the controller but you’ll get used to it, I’ve been having much fun with it, I would definitely buy.
---
I do love the killer mains that call Surviviors crybabies but then lose their ever loving shit as Soon as a Survivior...crouch spams at them.
---
I define facecamping the jake and letting everyone else go as a win
---
i love dying light i only use it when i have a mori tho
---
No it wasnt??
---
It actually was a good thing
---
Underrated comment
---
Little to none I would imagine. Salt community so I would assumelots of reports used regularly. I had a game 2 days ago, I completed 1 and a half of the 3 gens that were done, and had an overall good game. 2 gens left and we only had 2 of us left, I searched for the hatch as I had a key, but my teammate got caught and the killer camped them. I escaped, and all 3 reported me. I ended with 19k points, 1 had 9k, other 2 had under 5k -.-
---
Ppl are just dumb
---
Trapping people in a corner is a dick move.
---
I really prefer rank 6-8 as a killer. 9-12 is where most of the really nasty SWF intentionally depip to. I mainly play Plague and Spirit at 6-8 and usually do well.
---
I asked you to writr it differently
---
Your the one that gor offended and still are
---
What I meant was that it’s just immature to send people messages over a game. He’s not necessarily a dick but he’s complaining that he was saying toxic things when he started the conversation.
---
The issue that I have (which is only with Noed and MoM) is that they don't reward you for doing anything. You can afk in a corner and they'll still trigger.
---
Is it getting hot in here?
---
Look at it this way: 
---
Toxic survivors can teabag you and make you upset, but overall don’t change your gameplay. 
---
Toxic killers can facecamp you and make sure you physically cannot play the game.
---
PoP, Discordance, and arguably Surveillance should be higher. PoP regresses a gen 20%. That's huge. Without toolboxes or perks a gen takes 80 seconds. To lose 1/4 of your progress AND see it regress faster is amazing.
---
Discordance is a great information perk and imo is better than BBQ for seeing people since people run Distortion, Hide in lockers and behind gens.
---
IMO they should both be B or even A
---
Yeah it's lame. :( Still waiting on quitter penalties, but have no idea how they'll work around the people who do it on purpose versus a storm knocking out your internet, etc.
---
I personally love to give a good 'ole teabag when the killer is a facecamping pos. :)
---
And then the killer DCs
---
What do we even google tho
---
Max deviousnes with pig??? Please teach me and I will suck your dick
---
Yeah, it says it's "Internal" which I'm guessing is still too early, and it'd be contradicting of them to release the PTB before the big "reveal" ;) stream.
---
Don't listen to survivors :p do whatever you want to have fun, nothing else matters. If it isn't fun, then take a break:) I find not in this game in the small things. For instance this weekend I had a survivor tbag me at a pallet, and then another. I didn't get mad, I just thought, mmm he must be new? A little later I mind games him at a pallet and got him. He dc'd while i was picking him up and it was even the first hook. That gave me enough joy knowing I made a tbagger quit as trapper :p
---
I use a lot of random builds. I love lightweight, super fun. Lately been using BT, super fun, shits on face campers: Dead Hard as outplays are fun, and the last perk is often adrenaline/self care depending on mood
---
Lol im not offended its just funny to me. Like how you massacred the english vocabulary once again with your 2 small sentences.
---
You cant even write english like a human being but expect others to do so lmao the irony.
---
So what would you like me to do differently? 
---
"Ms. i cant write 1 sentence without a mistake".
---
Alright what are some recommendations on some non teachable perks cause I only have the teachable for wraith and trapper
---
Dude what are you even talking about?
---
lol hes one of the worst killers in the whole game.  Collecting and placing traps, takes so much time, that gens will pop super fast.  Also hes the most luck dependendant killer which is  another big problem. Hes trash.
---
It can be really fun.
---
Y tho
---
legion gotta do what he gotta do to win
---
Except you have to take into account the minute of lobby time, the loading screen, AND just finding a lobby, to amount to the 16K for the '5 minutes', when in reality, it's closer to 9-10 from the start of the first game to the start of the second
---
I never liked sprint burst. I hate it to walk from gen to gen and if there is a situation where I need to hurry I have to waste it. Personal preference I guess
---
It really depends how coordinated the survivors are, i think we need to give her a few months until everyone knows all tricks with and against her. Then we see how good she really is.
---
Facts!
---
GO CRAZY, GO STUPID!
---
Is that zombies in space land from infinite warfare? It looks exactly like it
---
*I was eating*
---
lol good survivors will laugh at him and troll him all game.  The time he spends, trying to  chainsaw one of them, he could have  done more damage just using his M1, because you will almost never hit a chainsaw against good survivors, except if they make a big mistake themself.  Hes a meme,  whenever good survivors notice that they are against a leatherface they always go "oh ok its just a Leatherface ez game" that alone shows alot.
---
also legion: -rep toxic pallet loop grr *insert “hurtful” message here*
---
Will this be updated when scream releases
---
I am surprised [my](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bts5k1/fight_for_the_chest/ep5c2ed?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) commend when I explained that it was me who was opening the chest got downvoted.

Oh really?! That works out because I got that game pass deal for a $1😀
---
Tyde Thyme: see this is why Surviviors are so OP. They can still get saved!
---
Boosted I can agree with. It's usually cause the people instantly leave and play solo rather than working with the rest of the survivors.
---
\~so take of all your clothes
---
I live in an apartment complex with paperthin walls and I’m 99% positive my neighbors think I’m watching porn whenever I play this game
---
Helpful oink
---
Very well said my friend.  Have a silver!  People are too caught up in wanting the game experience to be their way, instead of enjoying it for what it is.  Complaining solves nothing. And if you're that unhappy dont play.
---
This sounds painful to play against and unfair
---
Windows of Opportunity, Spine Chill, Adrenaline and Dead Hard. My fav survivor build been using it for quite a while with great success.
---
If you watch Twitch, I recommend watching FunGoose. He's an educational streamer who plays both killer and survivor on his streams. He explains perks, good combos, add ons, etc. He's also got some good content on his youtube channel.
---
Most of it is just getting in there and practicing. Your play style is going to be different than the people you watch, so you'll need to find what works for you.
---
Do generators have specific spawning conditions similar to hooks and pallets (i.e. minimum distance requirements between x &amp; y)? If so, why are some generators placed so closely to others?
---
&gt; all the facecampers and tunnelers around rank 9-13
---
!FUCKING THIS!
---
I figured there might be a change of controls. Glad to see the frame rate won't be too terrible, I usually don't mind lower frame rate. But as long it doesn't look like a slide show, I'm good!
---
I hear ya, I rarely ever see killers that are sore losers, but I usually see at least 1 survivor that's a sore winner :p DbD is the only game where I get hate mail when I win, and when I lose :p I'm on ps4 also so these people will go out of their way to try to bring killers down.
---
Here's my take on this, if they give you a form of sacrifice, such as a med kit, tool box, flashlight, etc.., if they are last alive and have no chance to escape, I will let them escape, but if you try to bamboozle me and take the offering back, you bet my ass I won't let you escape.  
---
That survivor was whiny, and he shouldn't have offered something that he's gonna take back.
---
Just had game as spirit where I hooked a Claudette in the first 30 seconds. She got unhooked and came right through my path. Because she just got unhooked, I went after a David instead of going after her. 
---
After getting gen rushed by a 4 man swf with toolboxes, the game ended quickly. After the game, Claudette sends me about 9-10 messages saying “ez bb killer” “trash tunneler” “get good noob” “be salty” etc. 
---
I now wish I would have tunneled.
---
I ONLY WANT CANON FURRY PORN OF MY DADDY MYERS
---
Why yes, there is!
---
https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLudovicoTechnique
---
A killer that needs to hide is lockers to do anything is lame, weaker than Freddy and would just be gen rushed every game because it requires survivors to be mentally challenged to die against him
---
You cant even use it during chases
---
Jumps over one vault and gets called toxic ☹️☹️
---
Looping refers to running a literal loop around the wall next to a pallet. You run the loop for as long as you can without the killer catching you, and then drop it, either on their head, or before they get to you. Then you run to the next pallet. This is the meta way to play the game at higher ranks.  
---
You can also loop on windows, but the killer gets "bloodlust" over time in a chase making them faster, so they will eventually catch you. If you can make them break a pallet they will lose the bloodlust. This is why pallets are important. Chaining loops between windows and pallets is the optimal way to play the game.
---
:’( yikes looping near the hooked survivor 
---
but hey seems like you lost Michael or Michael lost interest in pursuing the chase
---
I would say darkness among us. 
---
Jeff has 3 decent perks and is overall a good survivor.

Why are you not playing with headphones?

Then delete the post
---
I’m buying the pig at the end of the week, try not to spend extra money too often but I got an offering to play her and uh
---
Now I need to have her lmao
---
And face camping
---
Thanks for all the tips guys I really appreciate it
---
Has always been a thing most survivors don't know about because its a rare use type of thing for the doc but yea he can interact with all objects while in treatment mode. Pre-hatch rework it led to quite the number of salty grabs on survivors who were utterly bamboozled. One of the few redeeming qualities doc has, if he wants you dead, he's the best for it, even better then bubba.
---
They can give us whatever they want as long as they wait until the finals are over
---
You know what I say to Strode house? https://imgur.com/UHT3Kjs
---
i feel like just about everyone (including myself) would love to see this &lt;3
---
The fact that Ash talks when he honestly shouldn't be, is a defining trait of his character. Don't you dare take this away from me.
---
Detection is wonky, but it works... sometimes. I definitely get stacks for protection hits
---
miguel is spanish for michael lmao
---
*cries in legion*
---
Sometimes you get the big angry,  and sometimes you get the big gay.
---
It's a rollercoaster of emotions.  Big emotions.
---
Inshallah
---
Oh well yeah this is the main thing survivors do lol. 
---
I thought this was a killer technique.
---
The killer can do whatever he wants whenever he wants
---
Fuck the lame ass unwritten rules, survivors will complain anyway no matter what
---
No, it's getting nerfed. 
---
The best survivor dlc is Halloween chapter for Laurie Strode
---
Honestly the only time I face-camp without the intention of winning is when I plan on depiping, sure helps avoid the 20+ minute killer ques. Winning is rather subjective in this game, you may think a depip is a loss for me but 1 minute ques are an absolute win for me.
---
Ash
---
Prove thyself, stake out, poised, and that one perk from feng who's name I'm forgetting are pretty underrated gen jockey talents imo
---
it is, Strode House = DC as killer
---
Haha I'm working on it😂
---
TOTEMS
---
That's awesome!!! Congrats dude😁
---
You know not everyone knows spanish right?
---
I'm a Freddy... I don't win as often as when I play other killers. Can't wait for the rework tho!
---
Haha I love your Quentin gang 😂
---
oh well, who needs to be creative when you can just take someone else's work
---
You can let go and just find another match, you are a durvivor after all, you are not hosting the game
---
Cause he ran out of marihuana
---
Brown ones are the best for Amanda, though
---
This is really informative, thanks
---
For me it depends on the survivor, if I realize they are really good I just break off the chase, those usually dont get to teabag me anyways since I don't chase them until the end. Usually though the teabag is by a survivor that is not very good, so it's an easy target to take out and then tunnel after the unhook.
---
For most players, imho, teabagging is a sign that they have to celebrate even those small victories because they likely die a lot. Same with flaming at the end of a game if they survived, it's probably a rare occurence so they have to release their negativity and rage in that rare circumstance that they finally won.
---
Just like using purple mist on the meat plant map lol
---
I loved nurses calling and bbq, I know those are teachable I just wanted to say. So with freddy it's all about information about where everybody is. His fire up perk is amazing. Let me send you a website that helped me be a good freddy
---
Still really irritated with how the end-game works in regards to perks, only perk that activates for killers is noed and only perk that doesn't activate for survivors is dark sense. Should just activate ALL end-game based perk just as if the gen were COMPLETED not fucking "BLOCKED OFF".
---
My finals aren’t until the middle of next month :(

Had someone DC today on their first hit. 30 seconds into the game, they were the first to get hit, they dropped their flashlight because of franklins and ragequit instantly. After the game ended I saw that the ragequitter was actually the one that had used white ward, which made his ragequit even better.
---
Its called a "flair" my comrade
---
Every community has its own and you can create your own flair for each community you are at, example for this one if you are on mobile you go to r/deadbydaylight then click the button at the top right corner and edit flair, in pc you click on your profile and i think edit flair is there
---
Ah okay I know the kind of survivors you're talking about now, it is pretty satisfying getting them lol
---
Sometimes it is really nice to open gates 15% faster, but I agree there are way better perks out there
---
 e e e!
---
Yeah banning doesn't really do much other than give them the final word, let them say what they want about you without you replying, etc. Kinda upsetting to see how that groups disrespect extended well beyond the post game lobby.
---
There can’t be another injured person near them and you can’t be injured, it’s a whole thing.

I'm really sad tf2's not there anymore.

According to the Wiki, it's  Amélie Leguiader.

I *love* when music does that. I wish I knew the name for it.
---
Not in DBD.  Believe me this came up when the devs said this.
---
You’re supposed to kill them all, so no problems with me. I never let them leave.
---
I can’t really talk too much smack anyway. Endgame perks are the best imo because I plan on making it to the end, and by then I need all the tools I can find
---
I've been a clown main since I started playing but I never bothered to figure this out
---
For the add-ons to after piece tonic, say you have the one that gives intoxicated survivors exhausted or blindness for 30 seconds. Does the countdown start AFTER the intoxicated duration or THE MOMENT they are hit with the tonic? If it's the former then would combining the add-ons of status effects and intoxication length theoretically make them effected by say the blindness or hindered effect longer? Exhaustion it wouldn't really work with but I mostly use the exhaustion one as a "in case of dead hard and balanced landing break the glass" thing.
---
I've had more games with a DC than without since I've started back up. Kind of problematic, given I don't like to roll with a squad.
---
Haha I feel ya there, it's nice if you can couple hope with wake up because then you get to the gates fast and open them fast
---
Trapper.
---
I love it
---
Gonna go ahead and make some adjustments to the build so you don't auto-lose against competent survivors. Keep stbfl, throw on ruin, throw on enduring, throw on spirit fury. Run green dress and class photo, run an ebony mori or the game map offering. Ignore the obsession all game beside sleeping them and kill the rest of the survivors.
---
Ok yeah, when you play killer you notice this a lot. Would someone not know this?
---
I kinda never understood why teabagging pisses people off like he is going up and down am i supposed to be offended?
---
how do you guys view these numbers on steam for any game? sorry am steam noob

Doesn’t he have it under the stairs in his map?
---
Didn’t you post the exact same thing earlier?  And then deleted it to repost it to try and get more attention?

Why whyyyy whyyyyyy omg

Makes sense. In today's time, you can get away with a lot more.

You can see it through a little gap next to his bed. Nice little extra!

If you stay healthy, I recommend Stake Out and Spine chill with Prove Thyself Incase you have a buddy and either Poised or Technician.

If you can stay injured at 99%, Resilience, Stake Out, Self Care And This Is Not Happening. If you take a hit, heal yourself to 99 and use the bonuses from Res/TINH and if your stakeout gets charges, heal and run away.

It’s only good when the exit gates are further than 10ft apart.  Otherwise you have no chance if ur the last guy and the killer closes hatch.  They need to put a min distance for exit gates.

Even harder to swallow pills: Doing these actions on a killer doesnt mean your a god at the game so DONT teabag, fair enough?

You're right it's one of the reasons I love him so much. I feel like Ghostface would catch him off guard and stab him in the ankle or something among those lines.

Sometimes she sounds like she’s in pain. But the other times you hear her “OH OHHHH” moan and it’s like it does sound she kind of likes it. 
---
Although tbh only Jake and Laurie sound like they’re in actual pain from being sliced open with a cleaver, chainsaw, what have you. Meg and Claudette sound like what a movie victim would sound like. Dwight sounds like you smacked him on the booty a little too hard. David’s in the same boat as Jane. And Feng just sounds like an anime character.

Misplays do have punishments. But at the same time I'll get punished because for some reason some maps have complete dead ends. Like springwood lerys and the meat plant. When I play with people I let them out if they are trapped and I still get them. To the player though it seems like I'm being fair even though they get a few feet away and get downed. I feel like if you have to trap someone it shows lack of confidence or ability. That's just my opinion though. That doesnt mean it's the same for everyone.
---
Don’t get me started on hag traps, every single one makes me jump out of my chair
---
Thats Just what i've done with Letherface. It's Just I don't know if she is my number one target for doing that. Next is definitely the Hag then probably the spirit.
---
I wouldn't call it a counter tho. You're just putting yourself in more danger in every game.
---
Last month I got to rank 6
---
(the only thing preventing me from getting to 5 in time was a fucking Wraith going AFK all game, thanks for the depip asshole)
---
The highest I got before that was 10 (Wich was on February of last year when I had stopped playing) and I consider myself a average at best survivor
---
It's easy to rank as surv, doesn't really take much, it's really chill in comparison to playing killer, sometimes you don't even need to survive to pip
---
Not like rank matters tho... I noticed above rank 8 people forget how to repair gens... Rank ~10 games are better... You still find morons but it seems like *most* are actually sentient
---
THIS IS GOING TO HELL IN A HAND BASKET REAL FAST
---
Shouldn't make them then bb
---
Yes, smack them and then let them get the free unhook.
---
No, but they are available for Auric Cells.
---
Haha yeah same. Unexpected traps are the worst :D that and Piggy.
---
Yes

---
This community uses the word toxic to describe anything in the game on either side. Perks are toxic, killers are toxic, addons are toxic, maps are toxic, winning is toxic and losing is toxic. Y’all really internalized that word and just use it for everything.
---
Very nice killer. I've actually found less killers doing this kind of thing since the update. They've become much more sadistic. Including myself I must admit. 
---
Taking them to the hatch only to shut it in their face. Making them crawl to the exit knowing I've taken them just far enough away that they won't make it. Tricking SWFs into a false sense of security, keeping a player down while the clock ticks knowing they won't leave, then sticking them on the hook in the last minute to activate Blood Warden. I've been so bad.
---
I own all killers and survivors, just thinking about saving time really but I;m kinda leaning to not getting it. I don;t have to play the Spirit and it will probably be the second character I level after the Hag
---
Flash lighting at every pallet and purposely getting in super long chases 😂
---
Where can I find out if the shrine of secrets perks are good or not? I missed out on dying light because I didn't know
---
But what does tryharding mean in a game with a low skill ceiling like this?
---
Jesus Christ especially at the start of the game where you don’t know it’s hag yet and you find her ruin immediately and run up only to get jumpscared. I swear I’ve almost shit myself before when that happened
---
&gt; I do have
---
Uhhhh.... why is DaddyDoctor not in SS tier where he belongs?
---
The only way to avoid meta, is to be devoid of meta.
---
it's just than when playing solo survivor you can't control what your teamates are doing and even if you manage to get 3 totems yourself during the game, the killer might end with undeserved kills in the endgame just 'cause he picked NOED and no one in the survivors team knew how much dull totems get cleansed.
---
thanks, I;m probably overestimating the amount of time I have to put into the spirit. It's just if I unlock it now I probably will not upgrade the spirit till way later.
---
As a fellow killer main, please shut up. You can’t beat toxicity with more toxicity. Just say gg and be on your way.
---
Adiris, I think.
---
I'll take both.
---
Swfs?
---
Im not so sure
---
Yup
---
It really shouldn't, imo. It'd still be powerful even if you got punished for being on hook when gates were powered
---
Nice! (: My favorite is Spirit by far.  I never get tired of playing her!
---
The Jeff voice actor tho
---
Excuse me, the trapper would like to have a word with you.
---
Doctor is a trash killer
---
Meg is the funniest imo  "Ehh, Uhh,, ehhh"
---
You get a special cosmetic for the survivor if you buy the DLC
---
Aren't most of the dbd voice actors like, in-house developers?
---
I used shrouds as a killer during the double BP weekend.
---
Surveillance is my favorite 3 gen perk 😂
---
Most of the times its a guy i havent seen once whole game, lol. But honestly, there are two gates and i cant seem to patrol them due to the distance it takes.
---
Pretty much. I kind of want the gens to get powered. Often I have to literally follow the obsession for a few minutes without hitting him so the last gen can be complete (other 2 survivors are dead) and I can One-Punch-Mori him.
---
The most obvious example is when someone DCs immediately and the killer still tunnels. They already were going to win because they weren't facing swf, and 3v1 just hands it to them even more. Doing anything but making sure everyone gets their chance to do gens, chases, and unhooks is shitty. Again the choice isnt between winning or losing, it's between winning like an asshole and winning not like an asshole.
---
(For the record I chase, down, and hook everyone three times then dick around to get full gen points while still letting them finish. Then I kill everyone at the end after sitting within terror radius the whole time so they get evader points. Solo survivor is already pretty much unplayable, I'm not going to add to the bullshit)
---
Without the basement perk
---
Nah plague is a mix of clown and huntress definitely not hag.  
---
Hag is something else lol
---
what? edit, oh I understand
---
# You get a special cosmetic for He survivor if you buy the DLC
---
Sorry, Survive With Friends. Groups of friends playing together in a party. Usually on 🎤. You will find they are often much more altruistic and over confident. They won't leave because they want to save their friend and also are very confident that they will succeed.
---
bruh
---
No man you gotta think about it this would clearly hurt the bloodpoint economy in the game.
---
Yesterday I got saved by a Claudette against a hag with NOED, me being on first hook, we both got away
---
Thanks Claud
---
I repayed you doing the same for another Claud
---
__You get a special cosmetic for He survivor if you buy the DLC__
---
I think smurfs are a different beast -- at that point they aren't just trying to win, they're trying to rig the odds unfairly.
---
There's a neat site out there that might help you with this:  [https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/](https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/) 
---
If you're ever in doubt, it never hurts to ask. I'm sure someone would be willing to tell you if there's something you don't want to miss out on.
---
it's funny you mention the gate distances. I feel like when i'm survivor, the gates are on top of each other most of the time, but when i'm killer, they seem to be miles apart. 
---
i'm a bad killer though, so that may just be a perception issue  \^_^
---
how I see it, no shrine perks are worth it exept DLC you can't buy with shards. 9k for 3 perks and a killer is worth more in my opinion, you should only get perks from killers that you know ul never buy
---
I'm not trapping them, they just arent looking where theyre going and run into a wall or a corner
---
Stop you made my typo even bigger!
---
Yeah, no. If someone DC's I'm just going to kill the last three people as quick as I can. I don't want to be playing a game I've already won longer than I have to.
---
Not to mention people DC &gt; 1/3 games. If I did it your way half my time would be spent basically farming.
---
Gotta hoard those Skeleton keys and rainbow maps dude, sorry
---
You must not have met a lot of good pillowcases
---
He stalks his prey, waiting for his next meal
---
I'm excited to see the full cosplay, keep us updated please. Any hints or clues as to the cosplay? Is it Nea?
---
Should be Nea
---
I'm talking about someone going into a bad area then the killer blocks them between themselves and the wall and gets a free down. I've had it happen before on certain maps just because I didnt know there wouldnt he a exit going that way. Same thing goes for basement saves where the killers block the stairs. It's not fun or fair.
---
How do you play out of curiosity? You can still pip if you do gens and do 1-2 unhooks and do a little chases
---
Why @ you when you're just stating facts?
---
😂😂😂
---
lol follow me my child i will show you my secret \*opens door\* here is my secret \*trapper bag and  gloves\*  these ... these will save anyone
---
Been there, failed that.
---
I play on ps4 so all I face is billies with ruin in red ranks. To me it gets boring, I like to see variety in the killers I face and purple ranks I get that. To me noed doesn’t matter that much bc I usually do the totems and I play swf with a friend who does the sameb
---
I expect a clockwork orange. Got family guy. Not disappointed
---
I like seeing Pig on top.
---
If you don't meander around like a bumbling oaf then you're not a true Bill player imo
---
If you already own the Spirit, I wouldn't recommend it. She's a good killer and all of her perks are pretty decent. It would be worthwhile to just level her up to get all of them rather than spending shards just for one.
---
Hmm...in a game where the killer's aim is to kill survivors, you think it's bad that players are stealthy?
---
I don't usually introduce myself to them, no.
---
Usually someone will start a thread here after the shrine is updated. You might have to sort by New to see it. Feel free to ask in one of those threads, or here later in the day.
---
I see Piggy, so take an upvote.
---

Thank you! To be honest, it's likely a genderbent version of Nea if not Claudette, or my own design. I have a bunch of flannel shirts and a few tank tops to wear and try on for Nea. For the bottoms, considering I want to save this idea for MAGFest next year, I'm likely wearing jeans, but since Otakon is coming up, I'll be wearing shorts. As for the perks, I'm thinking of drawing perks that mostly pertain to my playstyle and personality.
---
And I'll stand by what I said, you are choosing to win like an asshole then. Like you already would have been doing chases anyways, now rather than be an asshole you just make sure to chase and hook everyone.
---
If they are picking around not doing gens,that's one thing, but the extra two minutes it takes to let them do gens after you've already spent the normal amount of time playing the game is a small price to pay to not be an asshole.
---
u have to mindgame survivors. Big chances are when ur just about to leave to go check the other exit gate, the survivor is waiting for u to leave and will immediately run to the door and u wont make it back in time. Run halfway to the other door and run back
---
Feng: Heavy breathing
---
once you hit them, they can run past you, if youre injured, then yes, its a down and its deserved
---
There is no way I can convince you, but move Pig up.
---
/r/brandnewsentence
---
Wouldn't the crows start giving out her location? I smell bullshit
---
so are you saying you're blurry?
---
They did it two years ago. Don't see why they wouldn't do it again.
---
Ah, a fellow intellectual
---
Thanks u made up my mind.
---
Wow, I never realized it did that. That is super powerful. I feel like that perk would be powerful enough if it only worked in the case of being unhooked after the exit gates are powered.
---
Why is freddy not S, if you don't he will force you to.
---
The fact that I can see Pig in this post means I upvote it.
---
&gt;Doing anything but making sure everyone gets their chance to do gens, chases, and unhooks is shitty.
---
No one is under any obligation to placate/pad a game out because one person was a selfish pissbaby. I’m not directing anything at you, but that’s not an asshole move, if someone ruins the game, I’m wanting to go next ASAP, no matter which side and I would not expect either the killer or the other survivors to do something outside of normal play to go next.
---
rank is gay.
---
don't be gay.
---
Freddy can be only good if you enjoy your kids being sexually harassed.  
---
Doctor would give'em a nice giggle dude.
---
Yes indeed except if they are in a corner they cant run passed you. That's the issue. If you get the one deserved hit that's fair. If you trap someone it is not. Wraiths used to trap me alot near gens. It's not a situation anyone tries to end up in but it happens. If it wasnt a dick move I dont think I would have had killers move out of my way and vice versa.
---
maybe they had a daily for chasing survivors
---
Yes, both. 
---
They try to have fun their way.
---
Shitting on the killer, aswell as winning.
---
As a killer it feels like they are 'trying too hard'.
---
If ur in a corner you can still run past them, you lose collision once ur hit
---
I seriously thought I was the only one who thought this. Every time I bring this up people are like "????????"
---
Yes Mommy, please.
---
That would make sense
---
No one is obligated to not be an asshole, but acting like an asshole makes them an asshole. Little time is lost to not be an asshole, so there isn't really even a good incentive besides not caring about other people, which makes someone.....
---
I need help uncapping my fps
---
I’ve tried editing the game user settings to disable vsnyc, while it is set to false i’m still limited to 60fps, anyone able to help?
---
Some people on xbox are god tier at 360 and looping. I never played on a keyboard so idk if 8ts easier or not.
---
You're wrong. Not letting the killer get free hits is the most toxic behavior in the game.
---
Every killer can mind game. Huntress can hit people throwing a pallet, Hag can place traps near vaults. I didn't count mindgames.
---
Yes she does...
---
It's definitely possible. It will be harder, but even at rank 1, the most popular killers are only used \~20% of the time. Even if nurse and hillbilly were used just as much, that'd still only be 40%. The other 60% has to come from somewhere.
---
Hag is actually incredibly deadly- she's the deadliest killer of them all in fact. Pig is also fairly strong and consistently in the top five deadliest killers at rank 1.
---
What qualifies as a win? In a game like OW, you win if you win. Here I’m not so sure, does the killer only win if he kills all 4? Does a survivor only win if they live? What’s with the point system at the end? Do you need a certain amount of points from the 4 categories to win?
---
Is the ranked games competitive? Is there a ladder for how well you play the game? If so, how do you climb it? 
---
Are there any tips on finding the hatch? 
---
How do I hide better? Seems that whenever I get hooked and the taken off the hook, the killer is able to find me soon after. I know running leaves marks and being injured leaves blood but it’s seems like whenever I get taken off the hook, the killer appears instantly, follows me cos I’m the easier target, I run, I loop around things but the killer is able to catch up and down me again. 
---
What’s the deal with the basement? Is it just a bad place to be hooked because of how easy it is to camp? 
---
What’s Michael doing when he’s just standing there? I know I have to break los when the music plays or he instant downs me.
---
r/dbdgonewild ?
---
There are clear gaps in power between the top 3-4 and the remaining cast. Obviously if you are a main/one trick, you can make anything happen, but depending on who you Main, you’ll find smarter survivors less mistake prone that other killers sometimes depend on to gain leverage. I’d say stick with your favorite and don’t worry about getting to red/rank 1. There’s no real prize for it other than your personal satisfaction and if you sacrifice fun for a resetting colored emblem, you’ll lose your love of the game very fast.
---
Because shit like borrowed time, MoM, dead hard and instaheals exist. And at high ranks, you're almost guaranteed to get a combo of these.  Instead of letting them get the unhook, I'd rather bide my time while they're running around and waiting until I can get the right moment to hit them that the unhook then becomes unsafe. Plus, it's not wrong to camp if the other survivors are just sitting there, because they're not doing gens and a survivor is dying. If progress isnt being made against you then there's no reason not to stall.
---
LMFAO, As a kid i also would be scared from that, even now....Poor children
---
Coming from r/all, is there like a video compilation of these or?...
---
Yea i get that, but i suppose you can wait to buy it until the end of the season to claim your rewards depending on how much you completed it, so you wouldnt waste any money because youd only buy it if it was actually worth it to you at the end of the season. Idk if that made sense lol
---
I don't really think there's much in the way of disadvantages we could get here.  It looks like it's limited to cosmetics.  If they followed the cash grabbing route, it could be exclusive maps, exclusive perks, exclusive killers, and blood point bonuses.  I doubt they're going to go that route (at least not early in the lifetime of it, they'd at least wait til people got used to battle pass and considered it tame before they did that, if they were going to).
---
Why the heck are 3 people in the basement?
---
So many people say that green ranks are the best... I really don't get that.
---
Sure, the killers aren't uber tryhard but the survivors are absolute shit. I die in the weirdest ways in these ranks because the survivors are so shit. Like not unhooking me in time because they are crouching/walking, everyone spending 2 minutes looking for ruin instead of doing gens, people looking for ruin instead of doing gens whilst I am getting chased, people not body blocking etc etc
---
I play on ash but I like running mettle of man dead hard hope and diversion
---
I'm not going to agree with you when your standard for being an asshole is arbitrarily set goalposts.
---
And honestly? When I'm survivor I prefer the killer just ends the game quick if someone DC's. So I don't agree with you from either side.
---
Ye ik… still cool to see
---
Yes it was. That was the whole point, you had to have a DBD character in there somewhere, so people were putting like Claudette's head poking up or a tiny hillbilly into their images so they wouldn't get deleted. This got translated to "smol billy protecc, because mods are afraid of him". The whole thing was mocking the mods and protesting the rule.
---
Dying light isn’t really all that great, tbh. The effect is powerful but with how many anti-tunnel and camp perks are accessible, triggering it is less rewarding.
---
Wow. You got so little points for doing so much. You basically need to do two gens then quit and do other stuff I see.
---
That is a very fair point.
---
A mix is best in my opinion
---
Its just hella annoying. A valid tactic, but annoying
---
So I'd be better off running a status effect add-on with smoke size increase then
---
sigh that chaser emblem
---
it would be op for her to put a trap on your head after just one down... on the one hand survivors are lucky enough to get the trap off pretty quickly but on the other hand the most of us know the struggle and how close it can get to get to the last box. if survivors cant no longer see the boxes auras it could pretty much mean that the traps are a 100% kill if the survivor doesnt get it off on the first 1-2 boxes
---
2 is max. It then rolls over to -3 and plus 2 kills remaining gives a depip
---
Now my iPhone screensaver
---
She’s toxic for looping all game? Sounds like they did their job as a survivor tbh.
---
The chaser and evader emblems are so annoying
---
Exactly. The strongest combo imo is Effect + Longer size. I personally like Jug of Bleach and Garish Make-Up Kit. Not only are they heavily slowed, but the zone is fucking huge. With something like STBFL, you could probably get someone down before they can run out.
---
I was using sarcasm but the reason why is because they gave an explanation to it saying that the event hurt a so called "blooodpoint economy" of the game. Basically because of the event everyone after the event was using ultra rare items and addons.
---
Lmao thank you because i always wondered what truetalent was saying, now i know
---
how was legion fixed? :0 and thank you!
---
This happens for many games. I'm guessing they re-order tags based on their popularity, to make the game comes first when searching for a specific game type.
---
If you want to rank up you need to learn to run all the basic map [tiles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QYjInzLeM).
---
Don't be overly altruistic. If the killer is camping the hook, just gen rush. Don't reward camping by letting him kill your entire team. If you want to save a guy, you have to make the killer believe you are willing to leave him there.
---
The meta perks are Dead Hard, Iron Will, Borrowed Time, Adrenaline, Self Care. If you don't want to worry about hitting dead hard, run balanced landing. I personally love spine chill, not only does it give an early warning, but it directly counters Nurse, Spirit, Pig, Wraith, Myers, and Freddy.
---
As a last note, the best way to get better at survivor is to play as killer for a bit. You need to get used to how long it takes for scratch marks and blood trails to disappear. You need to be actively aware of this while you play. As the killer what gen do you really not want to survivors to finish? That's the one you should be going for when you play survivor. When a survivor takes you to school, take note of what they did. Think it through from the killers perspective. What does he want you to do? What is he afraid of you doing?  
---
Edit: Forgot to mention, Mettle of Man is meta as well now that they made it so it works against Nurse.
---
A good Billy also can have super nasty flicks that catch even the best survivors off guard, plus there is chainsaw feigning as well. He's still loopable, but isn't without defenses.
---
Crouching takes a decade with 28% speed. Plus with how short chases against a good Hag are, she has time to replace traps.
---
Spirit does have some counterplay too, albeit not always guaranteed.
---
If it feels like she's phase walking, stop running and go off in another direction. This elongates the chase and can eliminate any immediate mindgame attempts, as she has a cool down.
---
You can abandon the loop entirely, making her waste time with a failed phasw or force her to phase or chase as a 110 speed killer.
---
I'm never gonna say Spirit is bad, most people wouldn't, but I'd say she misses out on the top 3 by a bit. She can absolutely destroy, but she can just extend the chase if she messes up a mind game. Why do you think I placed her in the top 5? Cause she is good.
---
...what word was supposed to be grapes?
---
I thought I read in some patch note that they shrunk the killer's collision box for this situation.
---
To slow the game for both sides...I wish they'd just do away with totems as a side objective, and make gens more difficult to complete. As in you have to find parts to start them, or instructions.
---
And as for killer, I wish they would implement a hope gauge for survivors. Killers can do certain things to increase the bar or decrease the bar. A survivor at 0 hope will be rejected from the hook by the entity, and a survivor at 100% hope will be instantly sacrificed upon being hooked, etc. But then again, that would be a completely different game than what we are used to and will definitely not happen. Just wish the lore came more into the game-play and would force both sides to actually play with one another.
---
All these months I've been doing duration + hinder or exhausted add-ons with STBFL or any haste perk
---
Goddamn I'm a moron
---
Everything
---
its a perk i dont remember what it called but it locks off the three farthest gens from the killer
---
It's a perk called Corrupt Intervention. 3 generators -based on how far the killer is from them- are locked for 120 min at level 3
---
It’s one of the Plague’s perks. Three generators can be blocked up to 2 minutes iirc.
---
The fact that you let him open the door to get extra free bloodpoints when you could have dropped him on the spot is nice enough. The only time I get mad at the killer for killing me is when the other 3 survivors D/C and the killer has no remorse. Even still it’s not really the killers fault but at that point I do kinda expect SOME mercy.
---
Bubba is just a normal, but pretty strong person. It'd be a draw, if we're talking no weapons.
---
But.. killers are less agile than survivors. I don't get it why would killers run around in a circle?
---
I'd better find out what is causing my skillcheck issue first. Stake out is a fum perk, but I don't want to use it as a crutch to help with performance issues.
---
It is totally up to you and how you feel. I'll usually let Fengs go or anyone I feel bad for in game. You set a standard for allowing the survivor to leave and they didn't meet it. I think it's fair.
---
69th upvote 😏
---
Doorways dont work
---
It seems pretty clear to me, each thing is an aspect of the game that represents a specific alignment.
---
Adrenaline is too strong on SWF teams and too weak on solo players, like a good chunk of survivor perks.
---
Funny how it is the complete opposite for NOED.
---
Woops. I meant seconds
---
No problem! Best way to utilize Whispers is to watch the perk icon rather than the audio cue. It will light up when it's active and go dim when no survivors are near.
---
And the easiest way to remember the hatch mechanics before the last person is this: If the # of finished generators is &gt; remaining survivors, the hatch will appear closed somewhere on the map.
---
Tbagging and using emotes to piss off like my last game I got Meg that everytime I was carrying someone would wait by the nearest hook just to use 'come here' emote finish destroying hook point at me then tbag haha XD
---
Imo I would replace doctor with bubba and bubba with trapper. I'm blind so I hate trapper because I just can't see lmao. And idk guess it isn't a popular opinion but I like facing the doctor.
---
When your not cooperating, when your rocking the table while he’s operating

#smooth criminal

How I still can't do it
---
I am sorry if some of the pig players did this to you but not all of us are like that
---
WE don't condone senseless tunneling and camping
---
Please join our cult of Ms OINK
---
Nah, Freddy's here to stop ya'll
---
I dont think anything people do in game is really toxic. Is it BM as far as camping/teabagging/what have you?certainly. But toxic? 
---
Toxic is when you get that guy insulting you with every slur he can think of in the after game chat for daring to get 4kills with the killer, or being extremely rude because that baby wraith is running noed.
---
Strictly speaking, none. You only get a bloody cosmetic for prestiging and a *veeeery slight* improvement to your bloodweb quality. If you're strapped for time, I wouldn't recommend it. Prestiging is meant to give the people with way too much free time on their hands a goal to work towards. It's completely optional and not beneficial.
---
If you'd really like to prestige one, I'd recommend presting one of your favourites while leaving another killer that you like to play at level 50. That way you'll have a killer with perks to get bloodpoints on while you spend them on the other.
---
Just go corner to corner. If i purely dont know i just switch corner to corner i'll stumble upon one trying to be immersed.
---
He is a baby because he left his safe space *frowns in disappointment*
---
I do use Iron Will if I have it, when I don’t I’m loud as a dog.
---
I already have a main character
---
Hope is also considered one of the worst perks for Surviviors considering how bad it is
---
I would put the Huntress in a tier
---
T3 is faster with 3 stack play with your food, noed, devour hope (post hook), and bloodlust 3. Fast walk boi
---
😏
---
I mean most bars are fairly arbitrary. I think I laid out why I set my bar where I do.
---
Did they say something about the nurse or something?
---
We here care about the pig and how marginalized she is fam
---
Use tracking perks such as Spies from the Shadows or Whispers. Follow the survivors scratch marks (if injured then blood trails and hearing them)
---
Hatch opened to give them a face full of entity
---
You don't play the pig at all if you don't know that brown ones are one of the best ones.
---
I would if I didn't get downvoted for saying my opinion. Its like, "Oh his opinions against us, let's downvote."
---
I remember them saying a long time ago that they'll never do x3 again. Because ya know, "bloodpoint economy."
---
Nah, just her addons and the ambush sound would be good enough
---
Her addons are literal garbage most of them
---
Tbag on Hatch.   
---
All I see is justice ;)
---
I suck at survivor and I hit rank 10 pretty easily. Are you just creeping around and hiding in lockers the whole game?
---
Worth it most likely.
---
Ehh... Ya know you didn't get banned right? It's what reddit is people have the ability to downvote your comment (opinion) if they don't like it. 
---
They don't have to agree or like it, hence they can downvote it, don't worry all of us have their share of ups and downs here haha
---
Soon he will.
---
According to BHVR they are. And it would also depend on where you live. If you think thats the worst, look up Freddys backstory.
---
Good killers consider NOED bad because it doesn't fit in the 4 perk meta lineup. Once again, don't get your point.
---
Greats, its a reference to a certain someone that often says that
---
Yes it will :) Link is on the battlefy page
---
I have others but they are really bad
---
That's actually very helpful to hear from a dev thanks.
---
AHHH AHHAHHHH AAAHHHHH
---
I ran past someone doing this then 360'd and smacked their butt. The accusations of hacking were glorious.
---
She doesn't have special places or actions, she needs to be mindgamed instead of looping, that's why it's with Myers.
---
I do that too. As survivor, I message the killer GG regardless of the outcome (i.e tunnel, camp, farm, normal gameplay, win, lose) they’ll send gg back then if they remember who I was and if I did something worth remembering they’ll compliment me. 
---
As killer, I have fun with it! I love to boost survivors egos. I remember a Quentin getting amazing flashlight saves in the most unpredictable places, on a hill, through a window, random shit, and I messaged him so fast like YAS YOURE A GOD. As a survivor main, I get so giddy when survivors do good saves- I don’t get mad. It’s awesome to me.
---
She likes that nasty shit huh 😉
---
Once I forgot I was playing killer (I was hella tired, don’t judge) and I thought Jeff was the killer for a second so I panicked for a second but realized I was the killer
---
Jokes on you I can see you breathing or I smacked you a moment ago and I have bloodhound with sloppy butcher
---
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
---
Every time
---
Would you guys consider changing the Pig her mori so that the survivor boops Amanda her snoot before they die?
---
They don't seem to work for me...the perks take up a large part of the screen, and the dark borders are too big compared to the other perks. Any help?
---
Hotel? Trivago
---
I play hillbilly and I don't need to camp. But I've been trying to level other killers to get the teachable perks... I am not great with stealth killers. In between practicing and getting better I usually end up camping someone just to get some points on the board by the end of the round
---
I can't be the only one who re-read that just to make sure there weren't any typos.
---
Because it does nothing but kill the game, making it no fun for anyone. Except maybe the troll looping the killer.
---
That doesn't even make sense.
---
Ok thanks. I did all the in game tutorials and I read the evil thing but I don't really know how it works or when it is active.
---
Thank you for this
---
That’s awesome! I’m still pretty new to the game, it’s easy to think the community is just a bunch of shitheads sometimes so stuff like this is great. It makes me want to be one of those positive stories for people rather than just another toxic noob lol.
---
You fucked up, you get punished. Just dont run into a corner. Its that easy. It wont happen to someone that knows their maps
---
Genius
---
This is the best reason to bring NOED -- save it for toxic survivors.
---
Is this a new Nurse cosmetic?
---
I'm fairly new to the game, (only have about 30 something hours) and mostly play killer, so my survivor rank is pretty low. The Killer I played with was also rather low, so there's a good chance he just doesn't know about the crows on the locker.
---
Also, isn't it also only on the locker? He didn't go into the basement except to hook the guy, so I imagine it would probably be easy to miss even then. I have no reason to make the story up.
---
Edit: There's also a free weekend going on for DbD on Steam right now, so there's probably even more complete newbies running around.
---
I love Pig but I feel like she could be a lot better.
---
If I'm still around when the game ends, I always gg unless the killer was outright playing dirty (which is very rare)
---
It's fun to see the humor in things that you might initially get salty about. I had a hillbilly and bubba hacker decimate 3 people cuz they did the two killer bug but by the end of it, I could only remark... are billy and bubba gay? And they confirmed only for each other. I love when my ships become canon.
---
This is why I love Spirit so much :-)
---
Whenever a survivor runs they will leave a trail of red scratch marks on the ground, they fade away after around 10 seconds or so. You want to keep an eye out for these scratch marks as they always follow wherever a survivor ran off to. 
---
Another thing to keep track of is generator progress, if you can hear a generator nearby then there’s a good chance there’s a survivor near it. Pay attention to the 2 sets of 4 cylinders on the top of generators, if you see all 6 or 8 of the cylinders moving then that means the generator is very close to being finished, this means a survivor will typically want to finish that gen so it’s a good idea to keep coming back to it after you damage the generator. 
---
Using headphones is incredibly important in this game, sound can be the difference between all the survivors escaping and being able to kill them all easily. Survivors will breathe heavily, grunt when falling, and moan in pain when they’re injured. You can also try to hear footsteps when you’re inside a building or grass shuffling when you’re outside. 
---
Running perks like Whispers and Bitter Murmur can help you track where a survivor is/is going. There are teachable perks such as BBQ &amp; Chili and Nurse’s Calling that are also very helpful in telling you where a survivor is. 
---
Because you main Myers you can use perks such as Monitor &amp; Abuse which lower your terror radius immensely, this helps you sneak up on survivors before they even start hearing the heartbeat. Using the Dead Rabbit add-on with Monitor &amp; Abuse basically makes your terror radius nonexistent when you’re not in a chase. 
---
If you get stunned by a pallet and see the survivor running away, it is probably best to just ignore the pallet and continue chasing. Breaking the pallet can often give the survivor ample to lose your line of sight and escape the chase.
---
We need that crap as a valentine special
---
She probably did, but I'm fairly new to the game - I only have 30 something hours. I mostly play killer as well, and as a result my survivor rank is pretty low. So most of the killers I play with are newbs. I think it's likely he just doesn't know about the crows going on the lockers.
---
Edit: And on Steam, there's also a free weekend right now, so that probably means there are even more newbie killers running around who don't know a lot about the game yet.
---
She could be sure! But we need to be realistic here we can't just give her blinks haha
---
Her addons should be reworked and ambush sound should be corrected so it actually works like "an Ambush"
---
Haven't heard of PS4 before, I will check on PC, thanks
---
depends what kind of playstyle you like
---
&gt;n22370
---
Why?
---
That’s a once and a life time situation
---
Wish theyd bring em back or at least let us use them in kyf, never got to experiance it. Wondered how dark the maps really were with those offerings.
---
ello guys welcome back to another video but first rusty pot are doing a £69,000 giveaway for 69 epic gamers so buckle up your eyeballs because I’m about to plot them into the nearest tree
---
agreed.
---
That's the cutest thing I've ever seen.
---
If your one pip away it shows the rank above for some reason
---
The point that he's trying to make is that if no one runs Obsession perks someone has to be the Obsession if the Killer has an Obsession perk, and it's no fun for someone to be selected at random to be camped and tunneled all game by Dying Light.
---
Honestly it's part of the problem I have with Rancor. I've always said that I thought the perk would be a lot more fair if it didn't create an Obsession (but would still let you Mori a Mettle of Man or Decisive user) as it's not fun to get instadowned and moried through RNG and nothing else.
---
All that being said the fix to Rancor can't be applied to Dying Light for obvious reasons, and while I honestly think Remember Me is a good example of a perk that encourages tunneling (though it's still insanely unfun for the Obsession) there is literally no middle ground with Dying Light.
---
I honestly think that Remember Me is a far better example of how Dying Light *should* work and I would really like to see the perk reworked to operate on a similar token system, perhaps granting a token every time you hook a Survivor. I know this would ditch the Obsession mechanic which was kinda the "gimmick" of all of Michael's perks (similarly to how all of Hag's perks are Hex totems or all of Freddy's perks are late-game perks) but... the Obsession mechanic is fucking trash in general and I don't think we should keep it on a poorly designed perk just for the sake of a gimmick.
---
I understand it ruins the fun for the target and I definitely do it if people get a rise out of me (I'm not a robot and I get mad sometimes). I had a match where one survivor consistently evaded me and did a little dance when he did. I eventually caught that player and revved my chainsaw in front of his hook until he died. Other than that I only ever camp out of necessity or boredom. If the other team can't be found and they aren't pushing objectives, I'll sit at a hook for lack of anything better to do
---
Adrenaline 👍 that’s enough
---
Yeah, back in the day things got wild. I didn’t think they were that gamebreaking, but it was definitely something to contend with.
---
Kindred, Adrenaline, Dead Hard, DS if you have med kits or swap out kindred for self care if you don't.
---
I found an example:
---
https://youtu.be/N12vobiznuo
---
At 9:40. Is that a hacker?
---
Me saying fuck you to you as a homophobic individual with an extremely fragile heart and ego is several orders of magnitude less hateful than homophobia and transphobia and fear of drag queens. You absolutely deserve to be flamed for being homophobic and you will so long as you hold your shithead beliefs.
---
Should see the teleporting/invisibility jack the Meg used on me in the second half of this.  I have footage of that too but haven’t uploaded yet
---
But dead hard requires a button press, timing and killer prediction (and you still go down if you fuck up). Mettle is just a gimmie perk. I realize that these subs are inevitably survivor majority considering its a 1v4 game but its hard for me to take you guys seriously when you say shit like this.
---
I’m a console player, he spammed me with party invites and when I told him stop post-game he called me a try hard bamby, which I honestly have no clue what it means (I obviously know what try hard means but the bamby)
---
stupid btch. Im not even homophobic, idc about them. And i say this as a muslim. Try again.
---
I played against someone the other day whose name was something like “DCB4DieIWin” - I laughed so much. And sure enough, he dc’ed after I pulled him from a totem. Haha
---
You should take Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, Dead Hard and Unbreakable out of those perks.
---
Oh bröther I wanted to see that post game chat SO bad.
---
&gt;Poor children
---
&gt;idc it's scary
---
&gt;Im not even homophobic, idc about them
---
Also lul at you playing the religion card as if that makes you less of an asshole
---
Its becoming cheaper and you'll even get an extra copy!
---
Soo if anyone wants the meg/trapper cosmetic go for it and you get a new game to play
---
Poor children, dude they were scared af?
---
So calling something scary makes you a homophobic?
---
stfu lol
---
I think if this was a skin for huntress alot of people would just let her hook them
---
Survivor: Tries to survive 
---
Killer: What the fuck is that even supposed to mean?
---
You can if you want. I usually let the last person get hatch if there was a d/c early in the trial. But I'm also not going to penalize myself too much over survivors rage quitting.

---
You could hear the direction of the sound with headphones, game sounds much better and you can hear killers footsteps etc. + you won't possibly annoy anyone around you.
---
I think the hitbox should be narrowed to directly in-front of the locker and the survivor should be given damage immunity when the perk is activate during the locker exist.
---
That's probably it! I remember when I was new to the game it took me ages to realize what the crows meant :P
---
STBFL is lovely for hook rushers.
---
The difference is that Noed by design is meant to grant reward where it isn't merited at all, under any circumstances. Perks like adrenaline and hope are, by design, meant to reward survivors for executing good gameplay, meanwhile Noed isn't designed to do that. Noed triggering isn't contingent on the killers actions at all. But it is on the Surviviors, despite this Noed seems to be the safest hex perk in the game, as it is tied to a potential 5 candidates.
---
Surviviors can cleanse 4/5 dulls and Noed will still trigger. Meaning they tried to counter it, but someone stopped them before they could prevent it. Noed is also the only hex perk that's impossible to apprehend before it's too late. You'll never know if the killer runs it until the killer uses it, that's another issue. It's a perk too well masked and too well concealed to be balanced. My idea would be this. 
---
Upon cleansing a dull or hex totem, a small blue flame will appear in the ruins of the totem, indicating that there is a "latent totem" on the map. This latent totem is no different from a normal dull totem, and cleansing it does not give off any special indicator. However, if the latent totem is cleansed, the remaining dull totems will not give off this temporary blue flame to indicate a latent totem. If the latent totem meets the conditions to be lit, then the Surviviors are immediately alerted of what the totem is (not where it is, but what it is) and the killer obtains the benefits of the hex perk. Obviously in this case Noed would only be tied to one totem, but it would remain concealed until the conditions are met for it to be lit, and Surviviors know if they need to shift their focus onto cleansing the Noed
---
Either that, or one piece of Noed needs to go, and I'd argue it's the haste. Bc a haste and insta down at the same time is overpowered
---
your opinion matters though. it is important because it can exclude or invite people who are different from you. Take more time to reconsider your biases.
---
Y'all are just gross lmao, getting off to sounds of women in pain just cause they're attractive to you lol
---
They're not sexual at all, y'all are just nasty.
---
I had the dumbest idea that george fisher should be a new killer in DBD. his ability is to violently windmill towards survivors and one hit down them with his hair. there's no heartbeat but instead survivors hear a very low death growl that becomes louder the closer you get to him. it's incredibly stupid and i'll see myself out.
---
"Joe! He's watching that murder porno again!"
---
Sometimes I feel like they should discount them after 2-3 minutes of afk. That someone who actually deserves the hatch gets it.
---
the real problem with the obsession mechanic is that the perks are supposed to counter each other, but usually don't. survivors have obsession perks that are very good, while killer's are mostly crap and too difficult to make much use of. 
---
original Decisive was supposed to give you a strong ability in exchange for leaving you more vulnerable to being targeted by the killer, but that didn't happen. two of the original obsession perks for killers specifically reward you only if you avoid the obsession, thus decisive gave you a strong ability as a reward for being ignored. that left dying light, which is only useful if you kill off the obsession quickly, thus nullifying the other two killer perks. made no sense. 
---
And since Dying Light often couldn't be made use of until later in the game, it was weak, and rarely used. and the other two obsession perks were not used either. then we got Remember Me. no one bothered to use it, though if you did, the est way was to make sure the obsession lived as long as possible, to get lots of tokens, then died right before being able to touch a gate. again, countered Dying Light.
---
as a result, decisive strike gave a strong power with no real downside. finally, we got Rancor, which is pretty good, but still encourages avoiding the obsession til the end of the game, so why even call them the "obsession" when the system encourages avoiding and ignoring them? and now MoM compounds that a great deal.
---
**TL,DR:** the killer should logically want to target the "obsession," yet the end result is that the killer should usually ignore them, or even fear the obsession's ability to disrupt the game while being near invincible.
---
I think that Claudette has the best screams. They give me chills
---
Because they're a sexist bigot with a sexual inferiority complex. Its a great piece of art, well done op, gotta ignore the haters on reddit you keep doing you.
---
Le being moried has arrived
---
Self Care : p
---
This would make him overpowered though
---
This is Evil Laught TIer List, not Moan TIer List
---
I’d love to see bandaged Michael from H4.
---
It's awesome when teammates then hit their Decisive. There was a game I played before EGC. It was a Pig and I was the obsession with Rancor and I yeeted out early. I watched and he ended up with a RBT on all my teammates and they all used Decisive with them switching targets. She ended up using a mori on 2 of them and the last escaped lmao.
---
I rarely think "Boy, this group is really rushing those gens". Yes, it happens sometimes. But more often than not it's "This survivor is way better than me in chases... Oh, look, gens are popping". And that is not "gen rush", it's me not pressuring survivors.
---

I'd love for the dream fog to be increased but only for the survivor. Freddy can see normally but the survivors are lost in the fog.

Free weekend alt accts in a nutshell
---
Thought this was a terrible idea until I read the rest of the post. Now I want this in the game 2 times.
---
cries in stealth
---
Definitely got lucky at the end. The killer tried to grab you instead of closing the hatch. Killer cant grab you going in anymore.
---
Haha love the edit. Unfortunately, this subreddit loves to shit on gameplay videos 😂.
---
Good luck with that, honestly.
---
kill your friends and survive with friends
---
You can do this in Kill Your Friends
---
God play
---
You can under kill your friends, but it’s only fun if you have a full group of 5 people total
---
Your Feng is beautiful.
---
Could be playing on console?
---
Im not concerned with anyones negative opinion . I just like making little videos for people to enjoy:) thanks for watching
---
You can play as a killer vs your friends in "Kill your friends" mode. You won't get any progression (bloodpoints, shards) doing this.
---
You can play together as survivors in "Survive with friends" mode. You will get usual rewards playing this way
---
looping is boring and I pride myself on being better than it, I play how the devs intended. Looping is technically an unfixable exploit that they've just accepted
---
Killer: These survivors are toxic
---
Drowsiness only lasts 5 seconds. It's a similar idea to how Legion can chain his power. Also, the brown and yellow block addons actually reduce it to be even shorter.
---
That’s just how Dwight becomes stronger.  Faster.  Lockerer.
---
*laughs in bone clapper*
---
Tell that to devs. I wasn't/isn't a fan of the game, just pointed out that saying game has no active player base is pointless, when OP specifically mentioned a rework and relaunch
---
Its was pretty useful to me then and it's pretty useful now. It was more of a joke my guy.
---
you should have put evil incarnete with michael myers in tier 3 and tuft of hair after chaotic evil
---
I think I remember the 3x not sure but I always thought it was 2x.
---
While all answers in this thread (so far) are correct, this one is the only message to mention the caveat of KYF (Kill Your Friends) won't grant any progression.
---
Well, eeksdi
---
remember to swing your camera around to look behind you. awareness and information can = survival, in his game
---
I'm actually so proud of you baby Dwight
---
This is cool, you should make some more! The Huntress would look good :)
---
Doctor is a bloodpoint machine. Spirit gets them Pretty well also. Legion is a good one.
---
Just wondering if you'd share where you got those incredible perk icons!!! They look so nice :)
---
Adrenaline
---
not a new player but what’s tunneling?
---
Ugh this really triggers me... I dont see how people play this way... someone tag behavior this needs fixed ASAP
---
2018 Myers and Laurie
---
They are pink. If you going by that logic then 1 hit hatchets shouldn’t be a thing. Auto set traps shouldn’t exist. Just because there are 4 survivors doesn’t mean something would automatically be broken. It’s not like they are going to have 30 saved up to all use at the same time. Even if there is 4 in 1 game that’s only 1 game. Don’t judge something as being over powered before even putting them into real situations
---
Seconded. i break out my doctor to get a lot of bloodpoints. BBQ is essential to this.
---
Brilliant
---
I can’t do anything with the doctor except get pallet looped consistently. Another thing I noticed is that for some reason, the shocking thing doesn’t always work when I zap them.
---
I'd rather them abandon it entirely and divert those resources into DBD. I also don't think Deathgarden would gain a meaningful playerbase even if it went free to play.
---
You need immunity so the killer can't time a preemptive smack and hit you as you hop out, the grab is intended and results from you doing it too late.
---
Equip whispers and stop whining. 3k is better than no k... lmao
---
mom didn't come out till well over a year later
---
Spirit is a good BPfarm. Legion I've noticed is amazing at it. Plague is decent too iirc
---
She wasn’t really tho , we had two generators left near each other and she kept puking on them lol . So she was going in circles around there .
---
Object of Obsession will keep you from ever having to do gens. Quick and quiet is nice as are lightweight and dance with me but my go to is drop selfish care and rock hope and adrenaline.
---
This perk tier list is a little questionable.
---
Adren is definitely not S plus, it is too situational. It is only a god tier perk if you are Zubat and can guarantee you loop the killer the whole game.
---
In fact, there are no S plus survivor perks.
---
Pharmacy is not B tier lol. It is C tier at best, D tier realistically. If you are wasting searching chests with Pharmacy for a medkit, then you are not playing the game well. You are better off bringing plunderers to go find Keys or Engineer toolboxes.
---
Alert is B tier. Knowing where the killer is any time they regress a gen or break a pallet is great and has really helped with extending loops.
---
How is Deja Vu rated higher than Detective's Hunch? I would rather take Detective's Hunch for finding totems than Deja Vu.
---
A non tiltable killer, my kryptonite.
---
i want to protect you with all my life
---
New player here from the free weekend. Put in 31 hours and watch 5 hours easy of basic YouTube guides.
---
I got the plague and love playing her.
---
What is the general player base opinion of her? What are tips for playing her?
---
have you tried shocking them when they're running around the pallet? also, don't be afraid to take a hit! The longer the survivor can hold you hostage with that pallet, the longer their teammates have to work those gens
---
Do you guys are planning some ranking rewards given by the end of the season?
---
I've been grabbed mid head on because it didn't work
---
aww thanks :3
---
Don't let being called a try hard hurt your feelings.
---
It's hilarious how often this happens. It's usually a Claudette and they get mad that you could see them trying to hide behind a pole in plain sight.
---
&gt;Once all Generators are completed, the Obsession has the Exposed IconStatusEffects exposed.png Status Effect and the Killer can kill the Obsession.
---
So I guess for it to activate all 5 gens have to be completed.
---
Still looks like an oversight to me.
---
With free downs and easy to find survivors though.
---
So he's also like an opinion
---
Bro my keyboard broke but I found an alternate one 😅
---
So why not just hold it down? I don't get it
---
I'm pretty sure it's possible. I watch Tru3Talent playing as killer recently and 1 survivor DC early on and he chats during post game.
---
Stop asking hard questions..
---
Just play like you do and don't mind that people think you're an asshole.
---
Thank you for specifying "Concept." I've been tricked by that before.
---
Rancor says once all Generators are completed. NOED says once the exit gates are powered.
---
Starting the EGC doesn't finish generators. EGC only powers the exit gates.
---
Yep! Mostly at pallets and windows. Sometimes it works and sometimes I get smacked in the face anyways.
---
Oh that’s why I kept seeing the killer’s aura
---
Hex: Destroy the unworthy
---
If a player attempts to escape via the hatch with less than 100% of a generator completed...just automatically kill ~~Claudette~~ the random player. Slowly
---
They can keep it that way tbh.
---
Rancor is a very boring perk that needs a rework.
---
I am sorry but that is flat out wrong. NOED not being a reward is reaching pretty hard but saying adrenaline rewards good gameplay, just no.
---
You could be hiding in a locker 90% of the game while your team does all the work and still get the adrenaline proc. 
---
NOED is not a good perk because it is not good at the highest level. Survivor perks like adrenaline/old ds/MoM are good because if you use them correctly they are absolute game changers but NOED becomes less and less useful when you move up the ranks. Is it a perk that can rob survivors? Yes. Is it so good it needs to be nerfed? Not really. 
---
Remove the fucking thing already I am so tired of survivors crying about it all day.

As a fellow Pig main, I would agree. But I am not rating the Killers on cuteness, otherwise she would be S++++++++++++ Oinkies Oink tier.
---
BTW: How did you get a flair next to your name? I am a dumbass and have never figured this out.
---
Wow wtf....  report the fuck out of them... that just stupid, I'd dc.. f that
---
teleports behind you
---
nothing personnel kid
---
I get what you’re saying but since most survivors even at high ranks do not play optimally, my stray usually works out for me.
---
Breh I was in discord with my SWF, and when he yoinked me off, I literally fell back in my chair. Mfs laughed the whole rest of the game
---
I don't really run into any Clowns at red ranks, he can't apply any pressure very well. I still run into plenty of Legions with Sloppy Butcher + Ruin + Thano.
---
When you get to higher ranks most people won't cleanse so your corrupt purge ability won't be used as much. Try to learn the basic killers tactics killer tactics like moonwalking. Also most people don't like her very much since everyone is going to be perma injured or against a corrupt purge Plague.
---
Why do all the Claudette stereotypes apply to me a Claudette player?
---
I am just gonna be honest. I don't know. I got a moderator to do it after I failed to do it for 30minutes. And I always die to a Pig because of her cuteness. I just can't run away.
---
Noed. BBQ. Make your choice and Monitor &amp; Abuse.   Add ons are usually 1 to set traps quicker and 1 to teleport from farther.  Every now and then I'll do mud traps but that's a whole different play style
---
Bahahah this made my laugh😂💀
---
Happened so many times to me.
---
SMOOOKEYY
---
The birth of a legend.
---
I definitely reported both of them. Stuff like this is why I play killer 95% of the time now. I know this community is very much opposed to SWF, but this is what I get when I play without buddies. And thanks for the sympathy, this was a rather . . . frustrating round
---
Ah, that makes sense as to why it doesn't work. It should be changed though.
---
Thank you anyhow!
---
&gt;Decisive Strike isn't ran as often, and is easily countered by just going for the unhooker instead of whoever was on hook
---
Or just slugging the person once you've tunneled them off hook. Plus you still have some sort of an indicator that DS is in play, if there is no obsession in the match then you are 100% guaranteed there is no DS. You don't get that with NOED.
---
Rancor is a lot of fun in my opinion to use or go against. It actually brings tension into the game as survivor knowing that if I make a single mistake, I just die.
---
how the fuck did this even happen?!?!?  
---
Were they going for the save when you opened the door?
---
I really like your spin on it. Like, one a generator is fully repaired, all the arcade games next to it power on and make noise, and like the back of the prize counter could be the basement or something.
---
Great art but that isn’t how human anatomy works iirc.
---
It is weird that they did the code for similar perks differently especially when it had no bearing on anything at the time.
---
Hmm.. I don't have a problem in these ranks, you must be the problem
---
This is hilarious lol. Please do more
---
The handful of times ive DCd on PC, its always just shown me thr end game screen and let me spectate/chat
---
omae wa mou shindeiru
---
Legion bad, Legion scary
---
Dude honestly good job running pot belly around for so long while getting sandbagged
---
I mean to be fair the game is already over. Its not like tunneling early and waiting. This guy prob got his ass kicked, saw an opportunity for a free win, and decided to go do other shit while the W falls into his lap. He's not having fun, hes being a salt lord
---
If I was the killer, I'd go out of my way to go for the people sandbagging.
---
Please look back. For the love of all Gods, look back.
---
Survivors complain about what a killer is using while they are using builds like this. Lol
---
spirit has lots of interaction with survivors like giving them heart attacks
---
Doctor and legion are my go to bloodpoint farmers. Even a bad game with them still gives over 30k, and way more if you have bqq and chilli on them
---
I will , jobro
---
How? I thought legion was considered weak a little while ago.
---
Nice.
---
**MISSION OBJECTIVE: ACQUIRE BOOTY.**
---
Thanks, it’s rough when there are three killers. I stopped trying near the end because I had given up on the match and was busy watching The Office out of the corner of my eye 😂
---
So your sample size is 2 games. 
---
Probably had nothing to do with Legion.
---
better than yours

I had that, but it was Myers.

Bullshit aside, It’s just that everyone hates to play against legion. Because when you play against Legion, you play against Feral Frenzy, and THAT means pallet vaulting and Deep Wound. Nobody wants to go against that, although DCing is no way to solve that.
---
Well. If your gonna put it like that.

---
Unfortunately I believe they were working together. You sir are much more honorable. Also cheers for Freddy
---
Friendly Teabags are okay. Pointing/Gesturing is cute too. 
---
Just no rapid-crouching and running away.
---
Everyone besides Trapper and Pig is good. 
---
Nurse, Hag, Huntress and Billy are probably the best, as they get a very clean mix of Deviousness &amp; Brutality + also are very likely to get a lot of sacrifice.
---
People who say Doctor are ignorant simply put; Doctor gets lots of Deviousness, in fact he is almost guaranteed 8k deviousness, but his pwer stalls games out, a 40k game that lasts 5 mins is better for grinding than a 10 min game for 60k + Doctor is a weak killer so he has a harder time getting sacrifice points.
---
Also dont run any "BP-perk" besides BBQ, the rest dont actually give BP, you still cap out at 32k max no matter what you run besides BBQ.
---
I don't really complain about camping and tunneling because it removes alot of the fun for people, it is because as the recipient you genuinely don't get to do anything all match.
---
I would rather be looped as a killer and down the looping survivor and destroy pallets than be camped until death on hook getting to do nothing or tunneled to death and getting to do nothing.
---
There is still a fair bit of difference there for me, personally.
---
That most likely would be, yes.
---
Thank you! Very helpful answer.
---
Honestly I think Save the Best for Last is the best Killer Obsession perk in the game currently, and especially with Mettle of Man being taken into consideration it does counter that perk quite hard. STBFL presents interesting dynamics for both the Killer and the Survivor and does result in "Final Girl" gameplay which can invoke feelings of playing a horror movie, which is what I think Dead by Daylight should strive to achieve.
---
But I do agree that the concept of the Obsession mechanic should be to tie strong perks to both sides so that the Killer has an easier time Killing a Survivor who has an easier time Surviving. But currently most Killer Obsession perks provide very little benefit when chasing the Obsession (Dark Devotion - woop de doo you have one of Doctor's addons as a perk) or sometimes flat out buff the Obsession by either making them less desirable to chase (Save the Best, Play With Your Food) or just flat out buffing them. (Dying Light) Meanwhile Survivor Obsession perks still follow that "makes it easier to survive" mentality and have pretty much zero penalty to being run. In a lot of ways this is why I respect Rancor, though I still think that perk is horribly designed and seriously promotes toxicity and rewards poor play on the Killer's part.
---
I honestly hate the Obsession mechanic and think it's the worst designed mechanic in the game, and would love to see it and all perks surrounding it reworked entirely or possibly even just removed from the game.
---
NA discords always the worst to listen to
---
While it could potentially be too strong, there's also some counterplay. Having survivors wake you up denies him of tokens toward the exposed effect because it only gains tokens when they blow a gen to wake up. And when he *does* eventually gain the effect, splitting up on gens and staying away from each other negate the time on it as it only lasts 9 seconds and requires Freddy to be close enough to sleep and hit then before that time expires. To put it into perspective, Iron Maiden has a 15 second timer for the exposed effect and it's widely agreed that the exposed effect from it is useless because it's too short.
---
Shocking during safe loops is a detrimental mistake, if you dont know which loops it actually works on (it works on barely any tiles) you will just fuck yourself over.
---
Rancor should buff the obsession a bit more tbh, giving them a Dark Sense worse than tier 1 isn't really a big deal...
---
Don't give the devs anymore ideas.
---
Generally speaking, you want to avoid a situation where he's right on top of you in the middle of nowhere. If there's no pallet or window around and he's right next to you, you're probably going to go down. Your best bet would be to keep something close at all times. He has to charge up his chainsaw before he can use it so worst case scenario, they'll be forced to use a regular attack and hit you rather than the using chainsaw.
---
I don’t play much doctor but I play Spirit 95% of the time and the blood points flow pretty easily. She gets easy deviousness points just by using her power and I believe bonus points for hitting someone shortly after exiting it etc.  Spirit is also pretty good with loops/pallets as you can mind game them.
---
Freddy is C+/B-
---
I hate Legion too but I don't even find any fun in playing AS him. Pre-rework it was sort of fun to tunnel people (Although understandably it's not fun for them) but current Legion feels like "My power is to waste EVERYBODY'S TIME! *Including my own!*" given deep wound just makes them mend, and that's kinda it. You dart around bleeding everyone but they just mend, and you don't really accomplish much and then the gens are done.
---
flashlights are fine. it’s flashlight clicking that’s toxic
---
It should be fixed as of the last update.
---
Tunneling is what it's called when the killer chases the same survivor right after they've been unhooked.
---
What we do here is go back
---
Where a killer exclusively focuses on one player - an example would be chasing a survivor for an extended period of time.
---
Generally it's seen as toxic as well as a bad strategy because while you're non-stop chasing a single survivor, the other survivors are (or should be) working on the generators, improving their chances of escape.
---
Saving that for every other game I play. Lol dc,  I still get my points you’ve wasted your time
---
Legion lower, Bubba lower, Freddy higher and Hag higher then its pretty good.
---
Quality shitpost.
---
Whenever I don’t run it I rarely find the obsession and whenever I do run it I only ever find my obsession :(
---
Not if she gets out the locker and just moves a little bit.
---
true true lol
---
R E P O S T
---
Yeah pink stuff in this game should be strong that the point of them.
---
That's a lot more intimidating than attractive to me....
---
It should be a token-obssession perk, so it punishes decisive players :)
---
Cool?
---
wdym? i saw this on twitter. Sorry if it’s a repost, i’d take it down if u rly wanted me to
---
[BAZOOOOOOOKAAAAAAAAA](https://youtu.be/9DgDVg8WOxk?t=487)
---
Cant even blame him, if i had that opportunity I would take it
---
Although your main point is right (small sample size), Legion is probably the most DC-d against killer. It does have to do with legion, people don’t enjoy simply mending constantly and being outrun very quickly
---
I think McLean does the voice for quinn, think he brought that up in someone’s stream.
---
Sloppy with wraiths bloodhound add-on is like the best noob friendly combo ever. Your approach is 90% hidden so you can usually get that first strike to begin a blood trail. Also really good if your not using a headset and need to rely on visuals alone.
---
Ngl only time I ever see this is if they're swf being overly altruistic against a face camping leatherface, aka most games that rank (Xbox)
---
This has been the bane of my DbD existence for years, it’s weird, I never see this happen to gen tappers but the moment I leave a gen it explodes maybe 5% of the time, it has lead to me getting hooked countless times.
---
I hope BHVR pays attention and actually fixes this, I’ve seen complaint posts pop up here and there about it but I don’t recall any official responses, it would be funny if a meme shitpost was the catalyst to it getting fixed.
---
Or the second someone gets hooked so you can’t hear it
---
Nice
---
&gt;Rancor is a lot of fun in my opinion to use or go against. It actually brings tension into the game as survivor knowing that if I make a single mistake, I just die.
---
There is no tension, lol. You simply can't do anything to outplay rancor once it activates which means you can't help your team if they are in assistance to escape. This mechanic is boring. 
---
For that one survivor, rancor is worse than NOED which at least can be countered.
---
A funny thing my brother does is he says “Let me leave if you suck” then he leaves.
---
This sub is really bad with the downvotes. If people disagree they act like you spit in their mother's face or something.
---
And why I use my special [Freddy Build](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/btzqdh/running_a_ignore_the_obsession_build_with_freddy/?st=jw8a99qu&amp;sh=4acf8562) Just ignore McLoopyPants, hit everyone else, then once gens are done (I let them be done if I have to) insta-down + Mori.
---
Imagine saying Yikes unironically.
---
Yea unless its a high mobility killer and/or the exit gates are close together.
---
Personally feel that Bubba with Carberator's + Engraving is much better than Freddy with any addons or perk combo. Things usually snowball rapidly against Bubba, whereas with Freddy I have survived situations where any other killer would have destroyed me.
---
Hag and Huntress are both A tier. Hag is nowhere near as good as a veteran Spirit or Billy.
---
Legion is also still pretty relevant in red ranks, especially with the Sloppy + Ruin + Thano combo. But I guess it is debatable if he is really B tier, maybe B-. But I didn't want to add in so many extra tiers.
---
True true
---
Gonna disagree and put Spirit in A and Clown In B. Other than that, seems quite correct to me
---
I’m scum so I use my headset I’m tempted to use whispers instead of iron grip or bitter murmur whatcha are my other two main perks in my build
---
Who hurt you?
---
I unhooked myself on Haddenfield, vaulted a window to have a wraith on the other side hit me. I disconnected.
---
looks good to me.
---
Imagine imagining things?  
---
Also  
---
&gt;"oof. yeet. yikes. wow, did you make that up just now? that's pretty good."  
---
Literally your latest comment.
---
When he moves it’ll activate fyi
---
Or matchmaking will fuck you over and put you in with rank 1 killer who will take you out first as weakest player.
---
Veteran Spirits basically turn her into discount Nurse. If you are injured, you are not getting away. There is no way to effectively mindgame a good Spirit. I have played against plenty without Ruin. BBQ&amp;Chili or even addons and they still have no problem steamrolling entire teams.
---
Clown can't shut down every loop and doesn't apply good gen pressure, so he is still a C tier to me. Maybe C+, but I didn't want to add too many tiers.
---
Rushes their objective, shames you for rushing yours
---
Adrenaline is S+ for sure, no question. Pharmacy I agree it should be C, but I put plunderer’s at A. I never run pharmacy. Alert is okay I guess and Deja Vu and Detective’s hunch or both bad so I didn’t quite think about those
---
Haven't played Legion yet. From the others Spirit is the one I'd play to get most BPs. And you definitely want BBQ. No, scratch that. You NEED BBQ.
---
But I'd say, play the killer you like most. Because this way you'll play longer sessions.
---
And get BBQ ASAP.
---
Nurse over doctor ?
---
taking STBF so the obsession comes to you and you can get your other obsession perks to work.
---
Please. Make. Them. Real. Perks.
---
I wouldn't consider looping an exploit at this point. The game is designed around it as a mechanic. Perks and killers and maps are all designed with looping in mind.
---
Also legion top tier OK
---
Many months ago 2 teammates left with Dwight left on the hook. I had no BT but I was able to rescue him from the Clown. However I got hit once and the Dwight tried to run. I knew the Clown would catch up so I take the hit for him, going down and dying. I said I wasn't going to rescue for nothing.
---
i'm not surprised to hear that, because i'm not a very good killer. this may explain why i can't get many kills with the Doctor. Thanks!
---
Yeah its not like its a rule. Why does it matter?
---
I think you’re under estimating the use of iron will. I know it’s not popular at red ranks but, I use it, and do pretty well on maps like haddon field, coldwind vs spirits. If they’ve got that ultra rare add on that let’s them see blood, now you’ve got a pretty good point 
---
You’re right on clown, some things he can’t deal with
---
You can download them here https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wdXKknx87C7VF3KApK-5Tl1RwRFnLKsh
---
There's a link above to download them if you want. Then you can put them ingame
---
Makes you move slower.
---
The game is designed around it now because the devs realise how broken the system is, Instead of reworking maps to remove loops they just added blood lust because they knew it was unfixable. It is an exploit of the games hitboxes and chase mechanics, but not one that they do anything about.
---
Beautiful
---
Can a killer with NOED catch up to a survivor with Hope?
---
Should've DCed, nothing can be done, rather just get away from those people then finish the match
---
ah ok thank you
---
This is dbd not dnd &gt;:(
---
You'd think such problems would dissapear one you get to red ranks but nope, I'm rank 1 survivor and I keep getting matched with green ranks and its 100% lose unless the killer actually commits to chase me but even then, they probably won't do gens since they can't hit ruin skillchecks. I'm so sick of solo survivor rn..
---
I'm flattered! &lt;3
---
How dare you killing Dwight
---
Hey man it's a meme calm down. I'm not trying to spark discussion just make people exhale through their nose
---
I considered it but I’ve been disappointed so much in the past few months with this game that nothing really shakes me anymore
---
Those addons are good on Bubba, however against good survivors he's a straight m1 killer, you slow down too much when charging your chainsaw allowing survivors to always be able to get to a pallet/window in time IF they are playing smart. Freddy on the other hand can do lots against good survivors, with his stall, stealth, tracking, and good m1 mindgames. If you play smart with him (dont use double blocks and tunnel), try keep everyone in dream, switch targets constantly and use hit and run tactics the game will grind to a halt, giving him heaps of time to secure downs and hooks.
---
I can understand why you placed Hag at A, but she's 3rd in my book. Most hags play her like shit, getting one guy on the hook and putting 10 traps near him, but good hags that can predict survivor movements and set up her traps in popular pathways and crossroads will DESTROY.
---
Spirit is 4th in my book. She becomes better with addons, but she has lots of counterplay and maps crush her more than they crush Hag or Billy.
---
Legion is pretty bad right now. The sloppy+ruin+thant combo you mentioned only works against bad survivors. Ruin does jack shit as its either cleansed in the first 30 seconds or survivors will just power through it, thant adds around 12 seconds to gen times at max and nobody heals against legion anyway, making sloppy useless. He's like Plague, just stay injured, rush gens, and youll win.
---
What I see at red ranks is standard anti tunneling and chase extenders. MoM and adrenaline as standards (MoM less than adrenaline), exhaustion perk, and a free card, usually DS, Self Care, or the like.  Iron will isn’t as common as the other ones I see
---

---
I recently saw Jane running next to Kate on the post-match screen. Jane's got some serious Baywatch-level bounce going on, and it makes Kate's bewbs look like implants (not that there's anything wrong with that) because they absolutely defy gravity.
---
And Nurse
---
I reached rank 1 with both Doctor and Pig, on neither did I have BBQ, Nurse's, or Enduring. The only "meta" perks I used were NOED on Pig and Ruin on both of them.
---
Only in the stairwell. Didn’t consider the door frames, which do vary map by map.
---
So it is legal?
---
i wish he was wearing his labcoat instead. just a personal preference. otherwise, great template!
---
I thpught you meant stalking.
---
You want to keep EW2 on hold so when you are chasing you can switch to EW3 in 1 sec and kill survivors who didnt expect it.
---
That’s why u should never open a gate completely when someone is hooked, always “99” it in these situations
---
Wow you really put Leatherface to rest lmao.
---
I felt so bad for doing this I tried video editing. I'm sorry Dwight...
---
One time I squatted on hatch saying it's mine she said she wanted it so I waited last second I left she died by endgame collapse
---
I suppose its 2 things really as to why people DC against legion.
---
First its become almost a trend to DC against Legion based on his pre-reworked stage due to how unfun he was to play against. This has been fixed but people still treat Legion in the same light.
---
Second is because survivors tend to find him one of the most annoying killers to play against. His Frenzy can usually guarantee him a hit against them which forces them to mend and stay injured throughout the entire game. 
---
Its very hard to not get hit with Frenzy and mending can be really tedious for slowing the game down. Remaining injured means the player has to deal with the constant moaning of the survivor and the injured background music throughout the entire match which can get a bit irritating. 
---
The biggest reason though is likely because survivors get frustrated with having to deal with Frenzy. Although its nowhere near as bad as before, survivors still get annoyed with it as its hard to counter if they are being chased by the Legion. 
---
My personal issue when I play against Legion is that I find my teammates always self-caring in a corner instead of doing gens which not only is pointless as Legion can easily injure a survivor again, it makes gen progression slow down significantly which can slow the game to a crawl. Doesn't mean I should DC though as he has counterplay and being injured in a chase makes the chase much more intense.
---
Its not right that survivors should DC. All his issues have been fixed and he is not a difficult killer to outplay.
---
&gt;2
---
completely lol
---
Well done! Looks great
---
To try out killers you don't have.
---
It was more like a heads up that this may happend so watch out xd
---
I just entered green ranks and honestly, when I hop on my first gen and that first skill check comes up red, I already feel robbed of half the fun I could've had that game.
---
*Happily oinks*
---
Honestly i don't care, i'm a survivor main and i have no prolems with killer smacking the "luky 4%" survivors! There are a lot of people crying for that
---
You have to earn Adrenaline. NOED is a crutch for terrible killers. Lol. Moris are just plain broken, but I don’t encounter them much because I’m in purple ranks with killers making the last push to rank 1. Can’t pip when you Mori everyone after one hook 🤣
---
I do, he didn’t
---
Doesn’t come close to crouching as Piggy and getting a pallet thrown down on you by a survivor you didn’t know was there
---
Dang man that's rough. I also play on PS4 and that stuff sadly is pretty common. The community here is really great but the people who I see playing are scum bags
---
I was holding back on him...
---
Worth it.
---
\*really happy oinks\*
---
Yeah. You have to stay alive and do gens super fast. Whoa. 
---
Make a case for earning MoM.
---
According to the developer data sheets, at ranks 1-4, Iron Will is among the top 5 most used perks:
---
1) Self-Care -- Go figure.
---
2) Dead Hard
---
3) Adrenaline
---
4) Borrowed Time
---
5) Iron Will.

I wouldn’t mind. Good thing I like tall women.

I mean she legally cannot consent due to her reduced mental age.

So although physically she legal, under the Law she ain't due to inability to have the mental competence to consent.
---
Sorry to disappoint.

Oh I know this would never be added to the game. But you can’t instantly call something op without thinking off all possible situations that it will be used. The nerfs were needed and should anything even similar to this obviously it would need to be balanced
---
The delusion on rage quitters is insane. You point out they're the ones who rage quit, they just claim it's just a game.

It's just a game, and you got emotional to the point you had to literally disconnect from a match because YOU couldn't handle what was happening to a virtual character YOU were controlling.
---
Try out dlc killers
---
First, it is fiction, get over it. Second, I guess Samination needs to change everything for Huntress.
---
Thank you sir.
---
Sounds like bad luck. I have a Kate that i'd have probably hit level 80 and just recently got "Small Game".  It is random, except that perks you DO have won't show up again.
---
Essentially the more perks you have unlocked as Teachable, the longer it'll take for them to get their turn in the bloodweb.

Link doesn’t work for me but I’ll take your word for it
---
Lol neither of your comments make any sense in the context of this conversation and that's super ironic given your first one. are you fully awake right now? had your coffee yet?

But do you get the dlc killer perks or no perks at all?

There are only a maximum of two perks per bloodweb and they're completely randomized, so you might see them soon or you might see them 2 months from now.
---
I dont get people like this.
---
They aren't even playing the game....what a waste
---
i prefer doctor over nurse cuz you can easier find people with his ability
---
That would make sense if she wasn't self-taught and intelligent enough to hunt down and kill *multiple* squads of soldiers during WWI alongside fashioning poisons and making her own clothing/shelter. 
---
Its much more likely she just doesn't have socialization skills alongside her solitary life-style making her far more hostile.  Even then why *should she* be looking for sex? She can craft her own...*Ahem*...'Tools,' for that, and when you're living out in the wilds like she is? you don't have time for that kinda' thing.
---
Mr. Fairfield it appears you have a shovel in your skull...
---
How is she worse than Myers when he gets looped just as hard *and* requires setup? Myers' whole gimmick is him being able to 1 shot you, which if survivors aren't cleansing, she can do the exact same with less setup?
---
They wanted a reaction. By me playing the game normally and not raging or sending them messages or even DCing, they got no reaction. Instead they just got reports.
---
I’ve thought about swapping the normal exhaustion effect for a small (maybe 10-15 seconds) of exposed status effect, or a very short (maybe 3-4 seconds) of hindered. Exhausted doesn’t make sense for how little use most people get from it, and often it’s just ignored for the far better balanced landing, lithe, dead hard etc.
---
I see that acronym a lot what does it mean?
---
If killers can have Ebony moris that are clearly broken then survivors can MoM.
---
I can’t!! Ok? I can’t!! I swear every time I try, I end up running into something and helping the killer catch me faster.
---
No perks
---
At first I was going to agree with you, but then I remembered that The Huntress is built like a truck.
---
Even if she’s not as capable of good critical thinking, or more prone to desire sex from less cultural stigma, there isn’t really any way to take advantage of her, simply because if she don’t want none, she’ll hand you your ass. And simple is as simple does when it comes to try and be silver tongued.
---
*licklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklicklick*
---
Ebony mori - ultra rare offering 
---
MoM - Perk
---
my 2nd time ever playing huntress at rank 20 I saw my first haddonfield offering. didn't get a single hook. 2 insta heals, 4 balanced landing, i never stood a chance. 
---
never playing that map again as killer if there's an offering.
---
Must be a bunch of assholes in that rank.
---
That perk hurts so so so so so much
---
Not sure about the others, but i play single all the time
---
She is not too good, unfortunately.
---
Hmm, maybe but I would argue that she hasn't had much time to mature considering she has spent her life killing others in the Forest.
---
For someone to be considered competent to give consent, they must be able to comprehend the implications and consequences of the thing they are consenting for and have the maturity to be able to make an informed decision.
---
Although Huntress has done a lot of killing and slaughtering, she is likely to have little to no understanding of the implications of sexual behaviour or the consequences of carrying a child. Additionally, because of her savage nature, it is unlikely that she has developed the maturity to make well thought out decisions as most of her actions have likely been driven by impulse.
---
She kidnaps girls not because she is making the decision to be a mother but rather by her impulsive desire to want to become a mother. She is driven less by rational thought and more by passionate emotion.
---
Rank isn't even a reward.
---
Please tell me the female version of the given name Hunter is actually Huntress.
---
Sincerely, an European
---
No.
---
I'm glad that in the end you got what you deserved for playing IW, UE, CS Invisidette.
---
Legion and Spirit are my least favorite to play against but maybe that’s just because I’m a noob.

---
Wasnt bbq and chili incredibly broken when it came out? Like no counters? 
---
There are killers like nurse and Billy who are incredibly broken.. one has no cool downs the other ignores all game mechanics.
---
SWF means survive with friends.
---
On PS4 it's the opposite, I get an instant game as a killer, as a survivor I have to wait 5-10 minutes.
---
please sing this on the news thx
---
The only killer that can’t catch any survivor not in a sprint burst is nurse. Every other killer will eventually run down the survivors
---
I would risk my account for that Premonition icon if I ever used Premonition lol
---
It bugs you that survivors stand a chance? What?
---
I either find the hatch first or I die. Never tried the "wait at the exit gate" strategy, though. It's certainly doable on maps like Léry's Memorial Institute and Gideon Meat Plant where the exit gates are guaranteed to be on opposite sides of the map, but it's RNG on other maps. I'd imagine EGC is a joke for high mobility killers like Nurse and Billy.
---
I wish dull totems had more to them than just hoping Noed will be nullified.
---
I had an idea to nerf the gen delaying perks and instead make it so each dull totem that is still in the match slows down gen speed by x %. If you get rid of all of the totems than the gen repair speed is faster than the current one.
---
That way you always have some reason to do the totems besides points and survivors now have a real secondary objective. If you get all totems then gens should be popping super fast.
---
Tru that
---
How many pools of devotion are there per map?
---
lmfao thats great
---
I encountered this the other day, but i wrote it off under the impression my game was fucked up and i just closed it (following the match) and reopened it.
---
that man ain't got no cheeks to clap!
---
Chasing one person for a long time isn’t tunneling. Tunneling is downing someone, hooking them, waiting in proximity until the lot get unhooked then smacking them and hooking them again right away.
---
Dont be Stupid hes broken..
---
Your only proof in this is you being unable to loop him or window juke. 
---
But I’m the stupid one. l o l
---
Was the killer able to pick you guys up?
---
hello, its me your pillowcase
---
To be fair, he can do that in the movie.
---
Your only defense is you can loop him and that makes him not broken? Yeah ok dude..
---
Isn't Freddy and Doctor the same too?
---
I had a game where i was able to heal a my friend but he couldnt heal me, i didnt have the broken effect. Had another game where it was reversed and i couldnt heal him
---
Uhhh. 
---
Yes. 
---
Looping is literally the worst thing that can happen to a killer and the biggest time waster in the game.  
---
It’s alright. I assume next time we have another conversation you will have actually played the game. 
---
Catch ya later.
---
Nah, friend. Evil wheeze all the way.
---
I had a game earlier this week were I couldn't heal any other players but they were able to heal me
---
yo thats so funny cuz the nurse is supposed to be a pretty easy killer to master.
---
No Mither still exists so I will still use it. Nothing can stop that now.
---
True, but just remember that, even if he had all those meta perks, back then, he got BULLIED. I think it was quite a wake-up call for him.
---
Facecamping is exactly what it sounds like. They’re sitting in front of you on hook not even letting you get off. Usually with a revved up chainsaw
---
OMG I am so tired right now.
---
No healing at all from my game, wonder if its a hack
---
I hate the survivor mains and killer mains of this sub (the ones who never play the other side unless it’s for dailies or something).  Generally speaking, the one way type of thinking where either side goes “this perk, MUST be nerfed because I’m too lazy/unskilled to think of a counter”, but their own perks get a nerf and they moan. I get the game needs to be balanced, but just because you have to adjust to new perks in the game because you’re not used to them doesn’t mean they’re too strong it just means you don’t have the brain capacity to out perform it (you can’t be unskilled as any killer and then blame survivor perks, and you can’t be unskilled as survivor and blame killer perks). I’m only rambling a bit, but I just feel like there should be more force to play both sides in order to understand what each side goes through and to fully understand a perk.
---
Wait so I must’ve missed the patch notes, they took hatch grabs completely out?
---
Please describe the other characters. Like, what do you think Ace sounds like?
---
Laughs in rank 18
---
Doctor runs, and idk about Freddy
---
But sometimes he just doesn't want to.
---
A pip is the little markers you need to rank up. If you look at your rank there's little dashes around it. If you get all the dashes you rank up. It's the first, I think, results page after the match. A pip is one, a double pip is 2.
---
unfortunately i don't remember. :( sorry mate
---
Not Freddy in his Dream World
---
hahaha i missed these memes thank you
---
It is consistent, but dependant on which tile you equip it on before the game
---
Oh, he pm’d you.  I was confused and thought you meant he disconnected from your lobby but still was somehow in the post game chat (PC).
---
Its a killer perk, not a survivor perk.
---
A “pip” in dbd is when you earn enough points via the emblem system to get a mark towards your rank.  “Double pipping” is when you do extremely well in a match and get enough points to get two marks towards your next rank, the max you can get in one game.  Hover over your rank in the lobby to see how many pips you have/need to go up a rank (:
---
No worries bro, at least it wasn't just me
---
So when you finish a match there will be a straight bar with 3 lines going through it on one of the pages. If the bar gets filled to first line that's a safety pip, if it gets to the second line that's one pip, and if it gets to the third line that's a double pip.
---
Thank you for your answers in this thread!
---
The poor baby Dwight
---
$3:00 2 daddy Myers and a shirtless David
---
That’s an interesting question, but I’m going to assume not.  I think that’s just fancy wording for “don’t get hit” all game, but maybe they snuck that in as an Easter egg and someone else can prove me wrong :o
---
 I think 6.
---
That would be an amazing update to the current lackluster system which serves no purpose at all.
---
It’s just not getting hit.
---
I’m right there with you, it would be such a nice QOL change. If the first perk could be “north” on the hud and just go clockwise from there, I’d be a happy camper.
---
Stealth is for losers and Claudettes. 
---
Pizza Dwight FTW.
---
\*SAUCE\*
---
Yeah I want to test it out myself, but fuck no mither
---
Someone made a post that it was like 2565 total bloodwebs or something like that to get all perks t3.
---
This is my favorite thing ever.
---
Looping is not what you're supposed to do...you're supposed to fix 5 generators and leave. Yeah if you loop for a couple times until you get an opening and take off fine, but 78% of the time its trolls who just want to distract you while their friends might work on the gens and it's annoying AF.
---
Making a tier list that isn't a shit meme, nice
---
“Death is NOT an escape!”- pouty kid shoving his dinosaur nuggets and McCain fries aside
---
reminded me of this: https://society6.com/product/star-fox-andross-lylat-lowpoly-laugher_stretched-canvas
---
Nah, its made to benefit the person using it. You think that the killer seeing me with object of obsession helps them? Nah. It doesn't. In fact it usually keeps them away. Same thing with rancor. Your not supposed to benefit. Your supposed to suffer from the killer using it.
---
For the Skilled Huntress trophy on PS4, is it going to be updated to 20 downs rather than 100, similar to how it is on PC and Xbox?
---
Additionally, for the Wounded Healer trophy, do I need to fully heal someone for it to count or just heal them enough that they go up a health state?
---
Looks like izayoi sakuya from touhou.
---

---
I've gotten so close to this achievement sometimes
---
yeah the game bugs sometimes where I actually can't be healed by anyone and I can only heal myself with a medkit
---
Right? It's ridiculous how things just break down for both sides in these situations.
---
Yes exacly, forgot to point that out
---
Excuse Bubba, he's not the most intelligent of beings
---
it's to try out killers I always use Freddy ones because I can't really decide if I wanna buy him
---
I mean you're probably getting matched with a rank 20 killer too since it seems to just take the lowest rank in a SWF and match you against that rank of killers.
---
Fuck i was going to comment that... Have my upvote
---
I suppose your right, I just dislike it alot due to the lack of counterplay. I think all perks should have some form of counterplay,even if its not necessarily OP like adrenaline.
---
That said,  Adrenline is certainly in a better spot balance wise than MoM, which is functionally a free instant heal medkit vs M1 Killers
---
Here's where your logic fails: whether or not a Killer gets a 4k shouldn't be decided in the 1v1 situation. There's been a whole match before that in which your team was supposed to repair the gens.
---
The 1v1 should be basically hopeless for the same reason 4ks were never meant to be rare (although they are, considering the best Killers on each platform have a roughly 60% kill rate):
---
Dead By Daylight was designed as a horror game. The Killer is meant to be intimidating. If you always felt like you had a decent chance of escaping, the game would cease to be scary and Survivor-play would become boring.
---
You're not meant to escape, but get as many points as possible while you can. If you do escape, that's a massive bonus.
---
Bruh why tf does it matter she isnt real
---
For us it was no healing at all for anyone rip
---
Who the hell is Richard?
---
You're right. Noed does activate regardless, unless you cleanse the totems. It's preventable if you just assume everyone runs it.
---
Honestly. You're a bitch
---
Maybe we should start taking screenshots and offer to share them in the event of hackusations.
---
Yeah, I feel like I was writing what you just said long-format.
---
who said anything about consent ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

My mans has 30+ posts exclusively promoting his twitch and has -1 karma lmfao

Thats crazy, i kinda wanna try it out now.

So what happens when the expert looping, meta-perk build survivor isn’t your obsession?
---
Yeah, it does unfortunately.
---
Get Mcote in here to confirm
---
All 3 were killed by the collapse. He stood there till the end.
---
Thanks :3
---
Absolutely! I LOVE this sweater xD
---
These are questions to the community, not to BHVR.
---
It's an extra dlc. Hentai screams
---
That’s, why I’m here
---
This is exactly why I stopped caring about my rank if I kill an overly altruistic team in 2 minutes, I did what I wanted to do. Doesn't matter if the game says I did well or not.
---
DLC for the DLC
---
One thing I hate about DBD, camping killers. Totally ruins the fun and the game! And there’s no penalty...?!
---
The Office is worth it.
---
Who would be the survivor?
---
I wish there was a way to send people prewritten messages on PS4, like when you’re using BPS or a green envelope and you want other people to know so they can use good blood point offerings.
---
The baby Dwight pulled a 360 on him probably
---
Nurse is S tier tho
---
thanatophobia, a killer perk that slows all survivor actions by small percentages for each survivor injured/hooked/downed
---
It means you’re currently affected by the Killer’s perk, Thanatophobia.
---
Not if you already unhooked the survivor
---
Lemme know
---
Yep, that was my fault. I was brain-afk :(
---
Is it only these or have you made more?
---
A red icon is meant to signify debuff, so in this case your interactions were "debuffed" in other words weakened due to thanatophobia being active by the killer
---
Your affected by a killer perk, this one being thanatophobia, so your repair, healing and sabotaging speed is reduced by a small % but this increases with each injured survivor.
---
you can remove the penalty by healing all of your teammates to full health, or just ignore it as its at best a 16% penalty and thats if all survivors are injured and they have tier 3 version.
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Well crud, it makes sense to balance out the killer’s shut mechanic. 
---
Recently had a match where I didn’t take the hatch because I was afraid of the grab and got shut out😅.
---
Freddy aggressively walks.
---
Oh alright thanks!
---
so if you see it, heal ASAP.
---
&gt; a global notification to everyone , including killer, when a dull totem is cleansed (obviously a different sound than a Hex totem cleansing)
---
Not a bad idea, also they should increase the points from dull totems a bit more, to give more of an incentive to get rid of them.
---
Is it really a win though.
---
We all do
---
Yes you could
---
I think a very long time ago (Like back when NOED wasn't even a Hex Perk but was on a timer, or maybe even when it was first moved to a hex perk) it used to say Exposed the second NOED procced. 
---
Personally I like the "Surprise" of NOED. Devour Hope doesn't notify you when it hits enough stacks for instadowns until the killer actually hits someone so I don't see why NOED should either.
---
I think Small Game definitely should get a totem counter.
---
Watch this get no upvotes because the community (not the game) is entirely survivor sided
---
Understandable, but it's funny how you will be tunneled by some killers without tbagging or being injured. It's like what do you want from me lol
---
Take a hint, nobody cares
---
You need professional help if you're that triggered by a character.

Thanks for the support love you guys

Everyone hates this :/
---
It could be a possible way to fix this if the entity gets annoyed of camping killers because he (or "it"?) wants a good match and does something against it. Stunning or even taking him and pushing him a little bit would be cool, BUT ONLY in extreme cases like being &lt;8 meters from a hooked survivor for over 2min or something or standing at the same spot for too long.
---
Well I don't like your friend
---
r/okdaylightretard
---
I wish to learn more about this butt-dancing thing.
---
Bannable? Are you fucking kidding me? By this logic, blinding the killer and making them drop a hook should be bannable as well.
---
Synchronization maybe?
---
There might be another word for it
---
&gt;Give a visible counter of how many totems remain on the map   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;or  
---
&gt; a global notification to everyone  , including killer, when a dull totem is cleansed (obviously a different sound than a Hex totem cleansing)
---
Sure. Lets nerf Hex perks even more. They are obviously overpowered.
---
Hey... I Mean that's just your opinion man
---
I run Rancor on a silly "one punch freddy" build. STBFL, PWYF, Monitor, and Rancor. Chase the obsession around and ignore him, then Mori at the end.
---
:D thank you
---
In dbd I don't either. Too toxic
---
No, that's where your logic fails. You're saying that whether the killer gets a 4k shouldn't be decided in the 1v1 situation. I'm saying with the current EGC is isn't being decided in a 1v1. Because survivors have no realistic chance. You're still trying to convince everyone you deserve to be handed a 4k because you've done well this far.
---
The intended effect of the EGC is to get survivors out of the map ASAP. The hatch is meant to give the survivor an instant escape chance, but their buggy mechanics caused hatch standoffs. So they let you close it.  The hatch being closed(by your logic) should spell game over for survivors, yet it instantly powers the exit gates? Seems like they want the last survivor I escape still.
---
You're only seeing this from an entitled killer main perspective while ignoring the obvious signs that it's not working at intended.
---
Or... they stand around so long they get spiked in the torso instead ;) survivors take all points from the killer :’) that would teach them! (If only!)
---
I hope the devs could look into this soon, it would mean a lot to the players :3
---
Dude we legit are talking about having sex with a fictional character in the comments
---
:0 it all makes sense now
---
Bois we are talking about having sex with a game character, yall had enough, go sleep
---
*Dwight squinting at Adam like that one gif of Fry*: S-so uhh, why you thinkin’ about this buddy?
---
I would be crying too if some disfigured man with a machete striked me down and I were slowly bleeding out on the floor.
---
Poor Meg...
---
I agree, looping and vaulting are far from toxic how else are you supposed to survive. Some folks can't handle being outplayed or rather, outran
---
Oh I was talking about the other guy cause he kept saying poor children when they got nothing to do with the other guy
---
Fuck yes
---
My favorite use was on The Game. I hear a gen being worked on behind one of those sliding doors, so I stayed puff and activated insidious. They resume working, finished the gen, and the door opened, revealing me just as I revved the saw. 3 Claudettes, all bumping into each other in an attempt to scramble. I only got 1 of them, but my God it was hilarious.
---
That is the most insane tunnel I’ve ever seen in this game. He coulda done hooked everyone before getting to you. Incredibly bad killer and super scum bag survivors.
---
This thread is making me want to crank up my game volume to 100 so I can hear properly all the Survivors in it.
---
I use reddit on my phone and I was in the middle of a game
---
Sound has never been the same since the SAW chapter. To me it feels like now it just pings the sounds instead of dynamically adjusting as the source of the sound moves or if you move. Grass also constantly rustles and its very distracting where as before you could standing at the hatch and then you can hear the crunch of some grass and turn around and see a survivor, now it constantly makes noise and I just try to tune it out.
---
There's a fair point to be made for both sides . However with 4 survs if one gets tunneled hardbody they deserve a chance to not depip simply bc a killer is narrow minded and inexperienced, however, noed encourages flat out bad gameplay. Do you have any idea how many killers who ran noed, bloodwarden, instadown add ons,  and devour hope I've destroyed and they wound up getting no kills bc they tunneled me all game I've ran into? An embarrassing amount. That and a rank system which everyone seems to care about but literally offers absolutely no credence to progression and gameplay. I've never seen a game with so little competitive potential create such toxicity in my entire life and I've been playing games online since 1995 (DOOM II)
---
This has been a meme build for since Freddy was released what
---
That’s kinda bull but I guess it makes me less tense if I’m in the situation as a survivor
---
??
---
No, I have Spine Chill in the 4th slot in the loadout screen. Each match it shows up in a different part of the diamond. It's been on each of the four corners. There's no rhyme or reason.
---
Which perk was that?
---
I love how we got so many posts from new players recently, they are so innocent and wholesome. It's adorable. This David is adorable.
---
Are you me
---
Agreed, holding the game hostage is always a major dick move, unless there are very special circumstances.
---
Why are those perks blue??
---
Devour hope should flat out not exist. Not with noed and the fact that any killer they make now has a scrubby instadown "I win even though I'm absolute trash" add on. Like, I juked 9 iridescent hatchets in a row, guess I deserve to lose the whole game bc I made one mistake and didnt know I could get stuck on a random rock on the map. I definitely feel outplayed when I get hit from 4 feet around a corner by a Hatchet bc the killer's isp is a literal moving market in iraq
---
Are you under the perception that this will quell that type of behavior? Lord help us in the coming days.
---
Accurate for DBD on PC. Not “DBD” on console. So true, yours could be different.
---
“No, Claudette. You are the pigs.”
---
I dislike James so I appreciate this.
---
Nurse should be in her own tier
---
That would actually be really awesome! If they did that though they would definitely have to not have it be a Hex perk though. Honestly I’d be happy if there was just a notification that NOED is in play BEFORE someone gets hit. I just hate trying to save someone, taking the hit and then being left because no one knew there was NOED until it was too late
---
&gt;She most likely doesn't know what sex is.
---
There is another dbd sub and from what I saw in there she knows exactly what to do with her penis sir.
---
This deserves a fuckton more upvotes.
---
I laugh at both sides. Poor luck, bad map making algorithm, and host connection can mean more to a game than; a perk a player may or may not use.
---
Na. Nurse and Billy are both S.
---
lmao, I posted about it when I submitted and guess people thought it was fake.
---
Nurse is the only killer that isn’t dependent on survivors mistakes.
---
I honestly wish I made this my senior quote. Graduated last year:/
---
I prefer amanda
---
Man, I knew xbox players were the worst (assuming this is an xbox clip and not pc with a controller), but this is ridiculous. Should report the suvivors and the killer.
---
I mean, there are murderers that happen to be actual children irl.
---
Mettle of man... Uh fuck that perk
---
This is xb players all the time when i played on ps4 i never had this issue but playing on xb is the worst if i am not playing with friends. This is almost every game for me and it sucks i really wish they would take the time to do something about players like this. I find it hard now to even pip because players are always screwing me over its annoying i really used to love this game now its hard to even like it.
---
I am so glad mettle of man is getting changed, why does it even exist in the game
---
Maybe, but she’s dependent on the killers ability to accurately blink. Billy is just as nasty in the right hands.
---
Sounds like a good idea. It sucks that the killer can play badly the entire match and you could've done well in evading them as well as completing the objective but all of your hard work goes down the drain simply because they have Noed.
---
I don't think you quite understand what a Luddite is. If OP were sending this picture by carrier pigeon, I'd understand, but he's still using a piece of technology, his phone.
---
A tier list isn’t meant to account for how much skill is required.
---
Start by practicing with no addons except maybe the stun reduction, so that you can get her ranges and timinga to muscle memory, and go from there imo. 
---
Also, sometimes if you blink short of someone, you may not want to commit to another, as they might guess you will and run right towards you, so you get a free hit. And if you do commit to the 2nd blink, only go for the hit if you're sure youll land it, or you'll get smacked with super heavy self stun.
---
Killer could never grab you out of hatch if you were dying, only injured
---
The new data suggests that only like 40 percent of the killers are Billy and nurse tho.
---
-P1 Dwight laughter-
---
Excuse you, oink is S-tier
---
Just block his crybaby ass.
---
Gen rush wouldnt be a thing if there was even slight incentive to do literally anything else. Saboteur is so useless you have to be an actual moron or in a super tryhard swf for it to not be a total waste. The truth is, the devs are just flat out bad at their own game and have 0 sense of balance. The only time in any game there is incentive to do anything but spam objectives is when you happen upon a hex (which I ignore bc fuck free instadown haunting ground I'm not horrendous at great skillchecks so ruin is a non entity for me) or unhooking. That's literally it. It's to the point where I'd rather lose and depip than play some boring half asses stealth game. I'd rather some low level killer down me once after 20 min and pretend they're not trash than be bored asf doing gens just to pip. All getting to rank 1 does is make the game boring bc they're all 100 blink nurses and instadown killers. High level!
---
All hail Ms OINK
---
You’re right, no one gets to decide how a meme is used, we do however, get to decide that if the meme is used “incorrectly” then it’s a bad meme. This is one of those instances, imagine someone using the “pretty good job so far” for something actually good, or using the surprised pikachu meme for something actually surprising, or using the double red button meme for an obvious better choice, it just doesn’t make sense, some of these things are logical, but you can’t really compare a currency to toxic megs and one of the game devs themself
---
No idea if it was intended, but it was pretty dumb for sure.
---
Billy and Nurse are the only two killers you will regularly run without Ruin and not need it. That makes them both S tier.
---
&gt; It's so hard not to pip as killer that it's a joke.
---
Um ok then?
---
&gt; I just pick nurse, huntress, or Billy at high ranks and its ezwinsezskins since I know both sides so well.
---
Your picking the most powerful killers, so OFC its ez, but two of these killers get little use out of NOED and Nurse is well, nurse so OFC you don't need NOED. Some of us want to play other killers who aren't god at chasing survivors.
---
&gt;  Not to mention the ridiculous amount of instadown perks and add ons they have. 
---
Sure, but most killer instadown perks are shit, like Devour Hope, Iron Maiden, Make Your Choice, Rancor are pretty useless except for on specific builds, Haunted is alright, but it lasts for 60 seconds. Maybe i missed something out, but the only viable ones are HG and NOED, Compare this with the amount of viable survivor double hits, you got BT, DS, Adren, Mettle and stuff like that, which is pretty easy to trigger by going for greedy unhooks or just getting hit. Adren is alright, i guess but puts the game out of the killers reach pretty quickly at the end.
---
Addons can only be used one time, unlike survivors who can keep very strong flashlights for as many matches as they want, i have to find a new addon on the bloodweb each time and also some killers just don't have any instadown addons.
---
&gt;  If you suck. You shouldn't be rewarded ever in any game in existence
---
Well, they can always remove the hatch, as thats a reward for being shit.
---
Nurse is just on a whole nother level.
---
